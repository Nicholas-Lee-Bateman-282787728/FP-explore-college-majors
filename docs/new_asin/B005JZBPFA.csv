4713404,1,B005JZBPFA,"Most of these movies are rated R.  What that means in this instance is the movies should not be shown to anyone over the age of 2 years.  Older than 24 months the child will be thoroughly bored.  In the vernacular, these movies suck!  I will make one exception, TADPOLE is a movie that is so much better than the others it must be included by accident.  It is not great, but compared to the other nine it is superb.
Currently Amazon is offering used copies of this video for $2.50 (twenty-five cents per movie) and for this price you can afford to kill some already dead time.  Otherwise spend your time more productively like with a serious surgery.
If you buy this piece of crap and hate it, do not blame me.",1364256000,13,710,4.3007518796992485

Will perhaps go back and try them again some time.",1363651200,,135,4.4
4713406,3,B005JZBPFA,"Yes it is okay, but I've seen better selections. It all boils down to personal taste. If I had nothing better to do it would be getting a better review, but I think I've spent more productive hours.",1360281600,,198,4.2368421052631575
