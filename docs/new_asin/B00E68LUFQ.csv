8601915,5,B00E68LUFQ,"Jess Franco? And Lina Romey? Its already enough to give this combination 5 stars in any flick. Sure, in internet era you download any movie
for free and I did and I bought my own copy too. Why? If you ask why I recommend you continue be brainwashed by mainstream propaganda
because you deserve to be brainwashed. Of course, I only watched it maybe 10 times and every time I think--how the heck this guy with peasant's face is so imaginative, yes, peasant's, remember him in ""Downtown""? No? Good for you, so at least try ""Sleepless town""",1491523200,,536,4.536082474226804

8601917,4,B00E68LUFQ,"Beautiful Alice Arno is the lead bitch with hubbie Robert Woods. Lina Romay is her mute whipping girl, literally. Woods and Arno deside to seduce the beautiful 21 year old virgin, Tania Busselier, from across the street. Arno takes us through her 'wax museum' which is made up of former victims. In the end we get a bit of a twist.
It's Jess Franco exposing every inch of Arno, Romay, Busselier, Woods, and a couple extra females. It stops just short of hardcore. Decent story line, decent acting, very watchable film.

1.33:1 aspect; French with English subtitles; very good transfer; lots of nudity, full; lots of sex, all f/f except one m/f scene; one scene of whipping though not graphically shown.
One problem I did have was at the 1 hour 8 minute mark the picture froze. I had to jump forward and then 'rewind' to the spot to get passed it.",1434067200,,846,4.565789473684211

8601921,2,B00E68LUFQ,"Firstly, I'm a fan of Jess Franco's film efforts, both good and bad alike. Sure, he misses more than he hits his mark, but there's usually something there, something lecherous or insidious found nowhere else, unless we're speaking of his stuff from the mid 80's and beyond, when I think even Jess stopped giving a s**t. But his 60's and 70's body of work captures the very essence of cavalier, transgressive exploitation like nobody else's.

Unfortunately, this film, a companion piece to 'Countess Perverse' from the same year (a year he produced 12 films!), is so bad it's just that. There's no spark, glimmer or fleck of interest on Franco's part as writer, editor or director to engage us in any way, and the stablemate cast of regulars barely sleepwalk through the motions of the living with less than stellar results. It's the umpteenth time he's pilfered from De Sade's 'Justine', and it's his weakest entry in this register. Another frustrating thing is that Jess just sent back footage to his producer who added all dialogue in post-production; not unusual for Franco, but the carelessness in the (un)finished product is abysmal if not amateurish.

So our tale involves two aging 70's hipsters, a husband + wife, the latter fresh out of an asylum, and their severely retarded sex slave (Lina Romay - who else?), who are plotting to deflower and defile a neighbor's 20 year old daughter while her folks are away. Problem is, the innocent appears to be about 35 and is nothing special to look at - any trace of the Lolita she's alleged to be is absent in the altogether. And Alice Arno appears to have gained a bit of weight since 'Countess Perverse', so her sexual desirability has diminished too. And the roadside prostitute that's a victim for the depraved wife is harsh on the cornea as well, so unless your idea of a sexual fantasy is comprised of pasty, doughy broads with dumpy derrieres and no waists, the visual element is exhausted from scratch. This may sound harsh, but we ARE talking about exploitation erotica and not a Criterion release, no? This is sleaze that fails to please; it's like going to a nudist colony - sure, there's tons of full-frontal nudity, just no one you really WANT to see naked...

There's no point in getting further into detail here, as there are no details - the only redeemable moment is the film's final five minutes and, unless you're doing a fast-forward screening, most won't have reached that far, as sleep, vacuuming or dusting seem like good ideas right about now. Remember, I LIKE Franco films, and my tolerance for the tedious is legendary, so this assessment is not flippant but factual, as I've sat through a hundred of his films.

Still, props to Mondo Pete for bringing us another transgressive trinket that's never looked better for us to examine under a microscope (though in truth it made me wanna trade my eyes for a pair of running shoes), and no matter what I've said, I still would rather have these available to review + ridicule than not have them around, because all the other Franco flicks Mondo Macabro has released over the last few years are indeed gems deserving of your time, attention and immorality. This one, not so much.",1408233600,9,3201,4.751798561151079
8601922,4,B00E68LUFQ,"The Mondo Macabro DVD authoring crew have released another nice example of Spanish sexploitation maestro Jess Franco's fevered paeans to the Marquis DeSade's writings.  ""How To Seduce A Virgin"" is loosely based on elements of DeSade's ""Philosophy of the Bedroom"" and focuses on one of the favorite 'concepts'  of the good Marquis - the scenario of jaded aristocrats corrupting some poor innocent for their own perverse pleasure.  In this film a diabolical duo (played by Franco regulars Alice Arno & Robert Woods)  set their sights on 'Cecile' the (purportedly virginal) 'teenage' daughter of a local diplomat and determine to lure her into their den of iniquity. Arno portrays a 'deranged' Countess with a history of extreme perversity - in fact as the film opens she is just being released from a mental institution where she has been serving time for castrating some unfortunate guy - not to mention that she has a basement full of 'female mannequins' comprised of the preserved bodies of a bunch of women she has previously killed and mounted in her 'museum' - after seducing them.  The Countess and her paramour are aided in their debaucheries by a male servant (Howard Vernon) & mysterious mute girl ""Adele"" played by a youthful Lina Romay - in one of her first major roles with Franco.

Alice Arno really carries this one for Franco - her statuesque naked body is constantly on display throughout the tale and she convincingly evinces a sense of smoldering lust for her intended prey.  Lina's character is portrayed as a 'simple-minded' speechless sex slave and she does a credible job of staring blankly and smearing lipstick on her face to convey her fictional condition - while also fully stripping down with some regularity to join in the sexy games at the chateau.  The final piece in the erotic puzzle is ably provided by Tania Busselier as the teen ingenue 'Cecile'  who proves to be an eager participant in her own moral downfall.

As Franco movies go, this is a fairly nicely realized product.  There are good production values throughout, an up-beat jazzy soundtrack, and LOTS of nudity and sex to be enjoyed.  The sex is generally relatively softcore but there are a few fleeting glimpses that allude to actual penetration, as well as, ample examples of Franco's pubic zoom technique! Most of the erotic action tends to be of the girl/girl variety.  I found 'How to Seduce A Virgin' to be an enjoyable watch and a worthy addition to the growing collection of Franco's works that are finally being released on DVD.  From a technical viewpoint the quality of the film transfer is outstanding. There are several interesting 'extras' provided which include a couple of informative interviews w/ Franco scholars and collaborators.  This film makes a great 'bookend' to its' companion piece: ""Countess Perverse"" and would be a worthy addition to 'the collection' for Franco-philes.",1395273600,3,2893,4.985446985446986
8601923,1,B00E68LUFQ,waste of money on a story of violence and perversion.  The title misleads the reader and the story is slow to get moving and then a bit confusing.  Do not buy it if you are looking for the title to come true,1386115200,6,207,3.9047619047619047
8601924,5,B00E68LUFQ,"Mondo Macabro has released Director Jess Franco's magnificent take on voyeurism and sadism 'HOW TO SEDUCE A VIRGIN' aka 'PLAISIR A TROIS' aka 'OUTRE-TOMBE'-1973.  Made back to back with his other erotic masterpiece 'THE PERVERSE COUNTESS' aka 'LA COMTESSE PERVERSE'-1973 released by Mondo Macabro last summer with basically the same cast and a mansion location featured in 'THE SINISTER EYES OF DR. ORLOFF'-1973 ,  it shows Franco entering into a sadean world he explored many times in his films (the virginal innocent corrupted by perverted sadists for their own sexual pleasures with tables eventually turning) and just hinging on the hardcore period he would frequently visit throughout his career.  Alice Arno is absolutely magnificent as the Countess De Bressac who is released from a psychiatric ward and insists on going down to her cold basement at her mansion where she has a perverted chamber of women frozen as in wax-like effigies at the moments of their deaths. Along with her husband played by Spaghetti Western star Robert Woods(check out his warped psychedelic wardrobe), they decide to kidnap Cecile, a virginal diplomats daughter played by actress Tania Busselier for their ultimate tableau but things are not quite what they seem as Franco culminates the madness in an incredibly chilling conclusion.  During all of this, we are treated to stages of voyeurism where Arno and Woods spy on their prey with binoculars as they fornicate with each other espying Cecile masturbating on her couch as Arno purrs a great line ""I'll make her pay for what she's doing to me now'. This also is Franco's real life partner Lina Romay's first full role as a retarded mute sex slave who joins the couple in off side kinkiness.  The latter half of the film involves a sexual parlor game involving one of Franco's favorite props ,a life size female mannequin , as Arno does an erotic strip tease along with composers Daniel Janin and Robert Hermel's funky score bathed in red light and also has Romay and Busselier making love on a rug as Franco glides the camera through the arms and legs of the mannequin. It  has to be seen to be fully appreciated.  On the side lines we have actor Howard Vernon here reduced to a role of valet and French character actor Alfred Baillou who's face does not one quickly forget and who was so memorable in Director Bruno Gantillon's  delirious 'GIRL SLAVES OF MORGAN LE FAY'-1971 also available from Mondo Macabro playing a hunchbacked gardener. Extras include an extensive history of the film, Cast and Crew profiles, Separate interviews with writers Stephen Thrower giving meaning to Franco's nuances and Alain Petit discussing the history of Franco's films based on the works of the Marquis De Sade and finally ,highlights for other Mondo releases.  The transfer is just as good as a Blu-Ray with flawlessly rich colors showing off the beautiful images of Gerard Brissaud and Franco's photography and presented full screen in French with optional English subtitles.  Not a good place to start for beginners to the films of Jess Franco but a must for his fans, here we have another difficult to categorize masterpiece from the eyes of cinema's true ground breaker.",1382486400,26,3201,4.977528089887641
