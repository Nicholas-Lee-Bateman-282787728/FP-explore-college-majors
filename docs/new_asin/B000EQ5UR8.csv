8112822,4,B000EQ5UR8,"An oft overlooked film that likely lost people distracted by the smooth ambiance and convoluted plot twists. Well cast, with great performances by all, especially Sherilyn Fenn and David Hewlitt. Though it's not the focus; most of the key characters are influenced by true Beat culture (not the corny variety skewered on TV); especially Deadpan (played by David Hewlitt) who recites an improv Beat poem in one scene. This product is a Chinese import in the original English, with subtitles in Chinese and English. Very much recommended, though the price tag seems to be rising as this one continues to be out-of-print.",1326153600,,618,5.068627450980392
8112823,5,B000EQ5UR8,"Great movie if you appreciate interesting plots, characters, dialogue.  This movie was used at the University of Texas in a FTR (Film, Television, Radio) class.  Great acting by Sherilyn Fenn, Whip Hubley, David Hewlett, David Johansen.  Very clever storyline, plot.",1303948800,,266,5.6
