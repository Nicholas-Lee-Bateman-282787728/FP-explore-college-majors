8442659,4,B004V2FV8Y,This movie is actually very good. Vinod Khanna and Shri Ram Lagoo are very good. Amjad Khan is Amjad Khan. There is a weird Vidya Sinha track which doesn't go with the film but it doesn't go too far anyways. Its a remake of epic drama by Kurusowa else I would have given it a 9. M Rajan is very good as 'Yadav'. Film has fantastic background score. Even though its a remake its a good remake. This is Raj Sippy's first film. After this one he made 'Josh' which is another Amjad Khan film. If you are an Amjad Khan fan then this is a film to watch. Last few scenes of dog chase are extremely interesting. The look of the film is very trendy and confident. watch it!!,1305763200,,665,4.123076923076923
