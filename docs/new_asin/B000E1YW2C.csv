2483933,2,B000E1YW2C,"Apparently the DVD will offer 40 additional minutes or so, as its original runtime was around 3 hours (2 hours after commercials).  If only LionsGate would do this with their 2005 Hercules movie (I wrote a review, but I've been reading conflicting reports as to which version is on the DVD).  But the main question is: is the movie worth watching in the first place?  The answer is Yes and No.

Yes: It's an interesting angle as to how the ship it capsized (terrorists isntead of a tidal wave).  Also, even though it's not as big-budget as the original or the Summer 2006 remake, it's got fairly decent effects where necessary.  The characters are more or less the same, some are expanded, some don't die like in the original, and there's several new characters.  And you've got Alex Kingston acting again!  Nothing says good movie like Alex Kingston.

No: It's a shoddy attempt to cash in on both the original and the remake.  The characters are poor imitations of its 1972 counterpart and the new ones just aren't interesting enough to care about.  The massage girl, for example.  I was rooting for her death and was glad to see it happen so near to the end of the film.",1139270400,3,1172,4.555023923444976
2483934,1,B000E1YW2C,"What a hunk of junk. Really. This sad remake should be forgotten immediately. It is an insult to the memory of Irwin Allen (the producer of the 1972 film) and Paul Gallico (the author of the 1969 novel).

Since this was made for TV (by Hallmark no less), I guess I shouldn't have expected anything great.  But this is BAD.  The writing is horrific and the performances are some of the worst ever.

I do believe ""The Poseidon Adventure"" would benefit from an updated version. And with Wolfgang Petersen - the master of the sea epic - at the helm, the big screen version due out in May of 2006 (titled ""Poseidon"") is the remake I am looking forward to.

But this 2005 version starring D-list has beens should not be viewed. I will never get those 3 hours back. Don't make the same mistake.",1139184000,5,787,4.4
2483935,1,B000E1YW2C,"This is an example of too many cooks spoil the broth.  They had way too many people working on the script.  They had way to many plots going on that had nothing to do with the movie.  The love affair was so uncalled for.  The worst was changing the story to the terrorism plot.  That is disgusting and is a disgrace to the original!  I too, was very excited about this movie and was greatly grossed out with it.

I have a higher hope the remake named Poseidon coming out on May 12 2006 from Wolfgang peterson is more spectacular.",1138665600,5,529,4.23
2483936,1,B000E1YW2C,"The premise of the original Posiedon Adventure was a ship on its final voyage is overtuned by a tidal wave.  The passengers must escape up to the hull to survive.  On every level there are obstacles to overcome and not all will survive them.

The premise of this TV movie is a terrorist plot to sink the high profile ship on New Year's Eve.  But the valiant Homeland Security agent is able top uncover the plot and disarm them on one side of the ship but not the other creating the capsizing of the ship.  And the rest is the same.

But while the first is pure action film, this is pure boredom.  I was excited when I hear of this remake but was disappointed in the result.  Even the special effects are worse.

Let's see the Summer 2006 big screen remake.",1137456000,14,756,4.267605633802817

8104440,1,B000E1YW2C,"Worthless post-911 ""terrorist"" drivel.  I couldn't get past the first part.  They didn't need to add the terrorism, and it just ruined whatever chance it had.  Which is almost none since the actors in this ...  whatever it is, are horrible.  Robocop guy and Steve whatever his name is.  When did they every star in a good movie?  Exactly.  And they didn't here either.  Where is Amzn finding these?  Just terrible.",1524614400,,414,4.704225352112676
8104441,1,B000E1YW2C,Disaster movie of the week - 2 hours too long; 2nd rate cast; wooden characters; formula disaster movie script; 2nd and 3rd rate characters; implausible plot.... Check out something else that won't put you to sleep.,1524614400,,215,5.0

8104444,3,B000E1YW2C,"Not incredibly awful. It's hard to remake a classic, especially with a TV budget, but it's watchable. Pieces of the story changed and things were added, but still a good show to kill time.",1524355200,,188,4.5588235294117645

8104446,1,B000E1YW2C,"So terrible it's hilarious. Especially bad are the special effects that look like a plastic boat in a bathtub. Dreadful sets, dreadful dialogue, dreadful acting, impossible story line. Assemble them all and you have an uproarious nonsense.",1524268800,,239,5.486486486486487
