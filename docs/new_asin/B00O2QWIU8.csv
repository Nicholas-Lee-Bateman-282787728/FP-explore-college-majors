6708157,5,B00O2QWIU8,"It seems Triple H has always been misunderstood! Turns out he's a great guy who had to overcome serious injuries to return to performance level and make his comeback in the WWE, not just a guy who gets places through his connections, as he sometimes appears to the public.

The DVD is awesome. If you ever wanted to maximize your work outs and integrate stacked reps, repeating sets, week by week changes in the program to ""shock"" your muscles into steady growth, then Triple H and his trainer have done all the hard work for you. They have put together a top quality workout, mobility, and flexibility program that anyone can follow along with. You can adjust the weight levels you use and the speed you work out at until your strength builds up.

I've allowed myself to get pretty out of shape, but starting in the New Year I'm adopting this exact workout schedule (which comes with a printed 4 week plan so you don't have to choose the workouts yourself, just follow along with the pro's!).

This is a really nice piece of training material offered by Triple H, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is ready for professional improvement in their physical condition.",1419465600,,1173,4.6298076923076925
6708158,4,B00O2QWIU8,"This is a really good workout.  It is challenging without over doing it.  Only four stars for two reasons:

1.)  As some have already mentioned, Triple H talks way too long on this.  It is nice that he described the moves, but he could have shorted it and possibly even explained a lot of it AS the workout was going along.  This is very old by the second time you are doing the workout.

2.)  I sort of felt bad for him as he had to remind the group behind him to count constantly.  Apparently in each set, one of his followers was in charge of keeping count, which they almost never did consistently.  It was somewhat distracting.

All in all, however, it is a pretty good workout and I would recommend it to others.",1419120000,,718,4.2444444444444445
6708159,5,B00O2QWIU8,Great dvd. Triple.h is awesome and it was worth buying this. Each day its different workout and never got tired of it.,1418601600,,118,4.409090909090909
6708160,5,B00O2QWIU8,"This is my first review for anything I've ever ordered. I'm a bit of workout enthusiast and have used P90X and 10 Minute Trainer by comparison. There are some pros and cons to this product, regardless I still love it and for the price its excellent. Including the warm up,  your workouts will be roughly 20 minutes every day, except lower body, that workout will be closer to 40 minutes. As people have mentioned, the workouts can be a bit short, but there is an easy solution to that. Just do the workout again if you feel like you can. Personally I walk or run for 30 minutes after I get my lifts in and have noticed a difference in my leanness and muscles. Triple H preaches functionality on the workout, and the workouts are smart. They strengthen muscles like your rear delts, rhomboids, traps, and core-muscles that are weak on every individual. Triple H wants you to work on your flexibility and mobility with stretches and drills, and you get to look better in the process and for $8-10 dollars, you can't beat it. Oh, and if you're like me who works full time and goes to school full time, this is perfect, no excuse not to get in a quick workout every day. Cheers.",1418428800,15,1174,4.435185185185185
6708161,4,B00O2QWIU8,"for $7.50, this is a bargain. Here are couple of things I LIKE and dislike about this dvd.

Pros.
1. Most workouts involve weight training
2. 5 different work outs to choose from (not 6)
3. Comes with a month long routine
4. The dvd has a custom section, to have your videos of choice play one after another
5. Can silence the voice instructions and work out to music already in the dvd. (instrumental rock)
6. Low price
7. Only need a few sets of dumbbells, no pull up bar needed.

Cons:
1. The work outs are a bit too short(except for lower body), but can be intensified by doing more than just one a day
2. Triple H talks for 3 to 5 minutes demonstrating exercises in the beginning of each video,that'll get old if you're working out to this dvd
all the time
3. Some work outs feel a bit easy. ( like upper body 1), not all are intense.
4. You get 5 workouts NOT 6. one of them is a 6 minute warm up. saying it has 6 workouts is misleading.

Overall I think it's a good dvd especially if you're a beginner looking to get into fitness. or you're looking to change up your routine and trying different things out. It's cheap so you can't really complain too much. I personally liked the lower body workout, and the muscle building cardio the best, they're the most intense and are the best for burning calories... Could you loose fat doing this? I would say yes, but doing 1 short workout a day doesn't seem like it's going to do it. I would say at least 2 per day,and a decent diet... Hope this was helpful

Also if you're going to get the digital version,keep in mind that you will not get the 1 month workout routine sheet, it isn't included, and neither are the dvd features. The digital edition just plays all the way through, so you would have to skip to the work outs you want to do. Thanks for checking out my review. and Good luck!",1418342400,36,1841,4.206798866855524
6708162,4,B00O2QWIU8,"I purchased this to see if effective workouts were included on it and just to add variety to my routine.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this dvd and the information contained on it.  Everything is on one dvd there are a few annoying things about the dvd which keeps me from giving it 5 stars one of them is that the warmup should have been done before each workout segment instead of a stand alone segment which causes you to return to the remote to start the workout that you are doing for that particular day.  Another thing I hate is that the beginning segment hijacks your time and to get by HHH talking about blah blah blah... you just hit next/fast forward and can skip over it but still is a slight hassle.  Another thing is like in my title it is not a stand alone workout meaning you do this and you have to do something else like walking, running, martial arts, etc. Not that this is a bad product I actually like it and if rushed for time this can easily take the place of what I am currently doing which is a mix of p90x, rushfit, and insanity.",1418256000,,1071,4.209756097560976
6708163,5,B00O2QWIU8,"This is good stuff. I was disappointed when I got the DVD and saw how short the workouts were. DON'T let that fool you. regardless of how quick each session is you will be struggling to keep up. It's an excellent full body workout and you gotta have some light dumbbells on hand. Ten and twenty pounds will work when you begin this regimen.

  I was looking forward to more focus on chest and triceps muscle building (because Triple H is the poster boy for these specific body parts) but this is more function/mobility training which is the new fitness standard. Oh, and that 'Muscle-building cardio' is murder!",1417824000,8,611,4.638888888888889
6708164,5,B00O2QWIU8,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this DVD!  I bought this primarily for the lower body workout because of a shoulder injury, but I did preview the first upper body workout and the circuit format and moves look great and something I could try with real light weights to start to work back up to regular workouts.  What's really nice is the formats for leg and upper are totally different, there is a ton of variety for a $10 DVD.

Anyway, I am not a WWE follower, but heard about the DVD on the Video Fitness boards, I must have at least 300 dvds on workout at this point, so my comments do come from experience with DVD workouts. I do prefer strength workouts over cardio, and this one is a great addition.

Triple H is an incredible instructor, his form tips are truly helpful for both newbies and experienced exercisers. Nearly all of the talk is instructional, but he's definitely not dry, he has a sense of humor.  The cast is all men, but none of the ""bro talk"" at all, at least in the segments I have worked through.

The warm up didn't move very fast, which is what I prefer, and I was already sweaty at the end.  I think it's great he included a joint mobility section as this is something I incorporate everyday into my workouts and is not all that common in dvds yet.

The leg workout is awesome.  It's a traditional 3 set format, reps are 8/10/12, the first set is the basic move, then he shows an advanced options for sets 2 and 3.  The advanced options are not so much harder, but add good variety.  The last exercise he does a compound move of swings and an ab move.  Then even the stretch he does is really good, I learned a great new one for the IT band that feels amazing at the end of the workout.

The music works well with the dvd, it's not my style normally, I guess kind of metal type guitar, but not screechy and not intrusive. I can't wait until my shoulder heals enough to try out the upper body workouts.  I only wish there was a little ab section because I'm sure that would have been great too.

I would buy any future DVDs he puts out for sure.",1417824000,3,2055,4.206632653061225
6708165,5,B00O2QWIU8,"Triple H comes off as a great trainer for this DVD. This DVD has 6 workouts to help burn fat but mostly focuses on building muscle. The DVD does requires some dumbbells, while anyone can do the workouts without them, but you'd get better results if you had dumbbells handy. The workouts are recorded at the WWE Performance Center and workouts go from simple to intense but allow you to get better at the workouts the more you practice. It also comes with a 4-week workout schedule/calendar.

Overall this is a great workout DVD and I hope that WWE releases more of these over time.",1417478400,4,581,4.533333333333333

6708167,5,B00O2QWIU8,"Pretty good DVD, solid exercises, definitely work your mobility and function, as far as muscle growth if you work out regularly probably gonna need more than two rounds and more weight and also good nutrition but they definitely put your body to the test...",1464566400,,257,4.863636363636363

6708170,3,B00O2QWIU8,"I was extremely excited to see a reasonably priced workout series from one of my favorite WWE superstars. The workouts themselves are good, but HHH apparently left his considerable charisma and energy back at the office, because neither show up here. Other than a moderately inspiring introduction, HHH meanders through the workouts, weakly flogging the bored-looking trainees backing him up into a semblance of interest in what they are doing. It smacks of a rushed production without much preparation done.

The workouts are the high point, providing quick hits that work well with a busy schedule. There's no way HHH actually forged (or I suspect maintains) his legendary physique with such low-impact routines, but they are fun and give the average excerise enthusiast a good burn. But WWE fans will be left wondering who slippped a mickey into HHH's protein shake.",1453852800,2,869,5.163120567375887

Surprisingly this dvd was easy to follow and no more difficult than any of the routines I've done from the Beachbody.com collection. I suppose if I wasn't already in good shape, I might not of perform the exercises so easily but after completing the P90X series 1, 2 & 3, T25. PIYO. Body Beast. Brazil Butt Lift. Tracy Anderson's workout series. Fluidity. Malibu Pilates. Urban Rebounder. Gunder Peterson Core workouts. Slim & 6 routines.

6708184,2,B00O2QWIU8,"I've done Insanity, T25, and DDP Yoga. Let's get one thing straight, compared to these routines, this is more or less just a few short workouts to add to a legitimate routine.

Each workout clocks in less work than you'd figure, after subtracting the time it takes for Triple H to explain every move, and the end stretching.

The production is poor, but not piss poor. It's clear to me that WWE rushed these dvd's out with little to no thought. Triple H is constantly reading cue cards and losing his place, and it's TREMENDOUSLY infuriating to try and exercise when the counts not being done consistently and proper, and half the time with no cues while you're in a pushup position and trying not to crane your neck looking at the TV.

There's an illusion to emphasis on form, but after doing DDP Yoga and realizing how much DDP really helps you with proper form, technique, and motion, simply throwing out the words, and expecting your viewer to do every single thing properly to prevent injury is just lazy.

The intro to the DVD alludes to the notion HHH and his trainer worked hard to give you this routine. I don't buy it for a second. Shaun T and DDP put YEARS into developing their routines and it shows a LOT more in Beachboy workouts/DDP Yoga than The WWE presents here. It Could have been a great routine, but I guess that's why this DVD is also dirt cheap.",1426204800,2,1368,4.46

Save your money,as there are so many amazing dvds out there-I absolutely love the UFC Fit dvd set-it's challenging,yet high energy and the Instructor is much more engaging. I also love the new Cathe dvd Ripped with Hiit Low impact-I get a great workout in under 30 minutes and it is challenging,yet easy on my 48 year old joints!",1425254400,2,549,4.555555555555555

6708189,5,B00O2QWIU8,"This is a terrific beginners weight circuit workout.  Strenuous enough to get a good burn, but the length of the routine, number of circuit exercises, and the number of reps isn't horrible enough to scare anyone from coming back to this later.  If you're an intermediate level at-home fitness guy, the true benefit comes from doing the entire workout from beginning to end, including both upper body strength sessions; otherwise, it's simply too easy, especially with the lengthy demonstration section before each circuit.  I wish I had done this workout when I first started rather than P90X -- it's a great introduction to circuit-based cardio, gets results, and provides a solid foundation for many of the more difficult (but more popular) programs out there.",1424822400,,762,5.129032258064516

My other heavy-weights DVD's can eat up a lot of time and I didn't want to start back with oh, an hour or more per day, so this is great.  The instructions are pretty clear and the exercises are basic and familiar, though if you are brand new to lifting, I'd read a book or check out online clips for proper form just to be on the safe side.  If you are new to lifting, this DVD is a great choice -- just choose weights that challenge you and don't worry about what anybody else is lifting.

I don't follow wrestling but I still like the instructor.  Don't think you need already be a fan of his to enjoy or use this.  And you can't beat the price.",1424390400,4,791,4.058064516129032

With that said, for any smarks that are reading this and believe the DVD is kayfabe-based--it has NOTHING to do with wrestling. HHH is out of character when doing this. People need to get over themselves with regards to what they see on WWE TV and what is real. Yes, HHH is being groomed to take over for Vince McMahon in real life, but his character on TV as part of the Authority is just that: a character.",1421280000,5,659,4.314516129032258
6708194,5,B00O2QWIU8,"This video was the best possible way to start the new year. Focusing on function and mobility, these one-a-day circuits are short, sweet, *powerful* and have relieved a good deal of my joint pain while comprehensively increasing my strength. Previously I'd had trouble working certain muscle groups and this ends up targeting all the small, connector muscles nicely.

The only downsides I could list is that the DVD disallows you to reach the main menu until after HHH's initial 5 minute pep-talk. That was obnoxious at first, and could be a hindrance if you're crunched on time. But on the flipside this has somehow conditioned my body to start prepping for an exercise the second he starts in on his monologue, so it kinda evens out :-P
