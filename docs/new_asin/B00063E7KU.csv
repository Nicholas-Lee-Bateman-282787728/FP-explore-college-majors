There are definately some beautiful women walking the streets and beaches of Brazil. You can see why a lot of the supermodels come from Brazil. But a lot of the clips of the attractive women in public are too short and jumpy. The soundtrack is too loud and some of the clips are way too long. I would have preferred to hear live sound than a distracting soundtrack. It would have been nice to have seen these guys show actual footage on how they picked up these women even if they had to stage it. There are some beautiful women in the video that I wish they would have invited up to their hotel room to get some sexy footage of. Most of the women that they took up to their room were average looking and not that attractive.

8299938,5,B00063E7KU,"Someone who was interviewed on Copacabana Beach in Women of the World, Rio de Janeiro Volume 1 said that the women from the South of Brazil have European faces with Brazilian bodies.  After seeing this DVD I must say it's true.  What a combo!  Who would have thought it possible?  Anyway, guys if you are into girls with European features and Brazilian bodies, check out the South of Brazil Volume 3, the latest release by Women of the World.  This DVD is a fantastic preview of what your trip to this region could be like and what kind of women you are likely to meet while there.  During their trip to the South of Brazil, they visited 3 cities, two of which I'd never heard of, but are certainly on the map for me now.

As they make evident, the world is full of hidden gems like Curitiba, Florianopolis and Belo Horizonte but without a DVD series like this one, how the hell would we know about them?  For the curious single male (traveler or not) this DVD is a must see!",1098316800,9,975,4.318681318681318
8299939,5,B00063E7KU,"The blonde named Solage or something similar is one of the best looking women on the planet, or at least in Brazil!  She is a 9+ (don't believe in 10s), no questions asked.  With those green eyes, hourglass figure and long blonde hair, I couldn't find a flaw?  I rewound her solo strip tease and the scene where she dances naked with the other girls at least a dozen times.  She is worth a trip to Curitiba alone!

I also really loved Florianopolis. It seems that the beach scene there rivals many places the world.  There were tons of girls in thongs with sick bodies.

The girls from the last city were funny. I especially liked the elevator action.",1098316800,9,651,4.420168067226891
