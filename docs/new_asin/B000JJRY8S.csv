8151283,3,B000JJRY8S,I <3 the goofy titles of the episodes.  It's a really <bold> statement that utilizes <strong> positioning </strong>.  We should be aware of <font> changes though.  </font>,1401840000,,171,5.2592592592592595
8151284,5,B000JJRY8S,"charmingly entertaining, this set was too good a deal to pass up. i never know how much i'll enjoy a series that deviates from the source, but i found myself pleased overall with the whole thing.",1367020800,,195,4.444444444444445
8151285,4,B000JJRY8S,"While this box set is sub only, it's no excuse not to own the series. Super Gals continues with it's simplistic episodic stories of life in Shibuya with the occasional drama episode to break things up, which is where the series tends to shine. RightStuf again adds a good deal of extras to their release and they put together a great product.",1263340800,,342,4.532258064516129
8151286,4,B000JJRY8S,"Except for being in Japanese w/ subtitles, the series is as good as the first season",1262304000,,84,4.3125
8151287,2,B000JJRY8S,"the subtitles were totally done by an amateur-- they go by really fast and bleep and skip so you can't clearly read them. and i asked around, it's not just my dvd, other people have the same problem. i wish there was an English soundtrack!!!",1194566400,,241,4.377777777777778
8151288,5,B000JJRY8S,"Totally fantastic in looking into Shibuya. The clothes, the spoken language and the teenagers' hanging out are very interesting. Nevertheless, the stories are funny and with meanings. You will get 100% fun from watching this anime.",1184544000,3,231,5.444444444444445
8151289,5,B000JJRY8S,"ADV had released the first season, and one has to assume that they have no plans to finish it, so it's fortunate that The Right Stuf (ASTROBOY) has done so. As the previous reviewer stated, these episodes are in Japanese with English subtitles and NO English soundtrack; no big deal to me, but it will irk some viewers. Language issue aside, this is a truly outstanding series that any anime fan should enjoy, and learn a thing or two about modern Japanese society in the process. Some new characters have been added, and existing storylines kicked up a notch...for me, the most amusing moments center around the rivalry between Super Gal Ran Kotobuki and the cute-but-prickly debutante/Gal Mami Honda...but, trust me, there is plenty to love about this series, and Right Stuf's DVD quality is fine. So, don't wait for an English dubbed version that may or may not ever be released. Buy this now!",1170806400,8,896,4.787096774193548
8151290,3,B000JJRY8S,"The collection is high quality, but it's Japanese with subtitles.  The English dubbing of it will come out sometime later, but all twenty-six episodes of the second season are here.  Character development, which was somewhat lacking in the first season because of its major focus on Ran, is a bit more thorough; Second Place and Machida Black get their fair share in the spotlight, as well as new characters, like Tatsukichi's little brother.  The subbing isn't too bad and the stories are even more hilarious than the first series.  If you're a fan of English dubs, you might want to wait until the true English dub of this comes out.  If you don't care, though, this is a great collection!",1170288000,6,691,4.725
