7982735,5,B00008G83T,"Tom Kolb plays the guitar better than 95% of the high profile artists out there IMO and in every imaginable style.  What's more, he is a very competent instructor that has given great thought to the thought process of the student and teaches in a way that makes conceptualization and retention as easy as possible.  I have several of his books/DVDs and must say that in most respects he exceeds Koch, Wyatt, Soklow, Mitchell and the rest.

I took this DVD out of the library and am now ordering it because the attention to detail is just extraordinary.  If you want to truly sound like Zep and Clapton, and Berry, on these hits and moreover absorb their styles to some extent, this is your DVD.  True it has no tab, and true you must be at least a strong intermediate player, but if you have the patience to stick with it, Tom will make a man out of you, a guitar man that is.",1244505600,3,876,4.317073170731708
7982736,3,B00008G83T,"I agree with another reviewer who said the absence of Tab is a drawback to this instructional DVD. Tab is commonplace nowadays in instructional DVDs, so a good publisher like Hal Leonard should have and could have easily included it. I also agree with this reviewer's opinion that this DVD is for ""advanced"" players. But, if you are beyond beginner, and if your ear is good, and if you can track the fretboard moves, then you will like it. You can find all of these solos transcribed in numerous sources, but you can't get the visual information that the DVD provides. And, contrary to what the negative review said, I found the right-hand view very helpful. So, if you can figure out the riffs without the benefit of a written score, this DVD is quite helpful. If you CAN'T figure it out without a written score, then you can find the scores without too much difficulty, and use this DVD to help you master them. For me, written scores are never enough, so that's why I say this DVD may get you there faster, considering that the written score may never get you there at all. Tom Kolb is a good narrator, his playing is loose, relaxed, and accurate, and he does slow the licks down sufficiently for you to lift them, but you will definitely need to take advantage of the ""loop"" feature on your DVD player so that you can play the parts that puzzle you over and over as needed. For example, he plays the opening riff to ""No Particular Place to Go"" just once, and rather fast. It's a four-beat, three-strokes to the beat (triplet) strum of a D augmented chord at the 10th fret, but the way HE plays it, it MIGHT be eighth notes with a three-against-two rhythm (kinda like a rhumba). Later in the DVD he mentions the triplet rhythm as the basis of several riffs, and when you loop the opening riff, you can hear it that way, but here's where a written score would have resolved any doubts. Anyway, I got a lot out of this DVD, and for me, part of the fun was trying to figure things out without the score.",1145664000,8,2003,4.387096774193548
7982737,2,B00008G83T,"This is more of a demo of Tom Kolb's guitar skills rather than an intructional DVD for beginners.  It only demos 8 riffs/solos.  Here's the list:

1. No Particular Place to go (Chuck Berry)

2. Crossroads (Cream)

3. Hey Joe (Jimi Hendrix)

4. You Shook me (Led Zeppelin)

5. Iron Man (Black Sabbath)

6. Smoke on the Water (Deep Purple)

7. You Really Got Me (Van Halen)

8. Crossfire (Stevie Ray Vaughan)

This DVD does not show tabs!!  I can't believe they show his left hand playing the fretboard and then they waste screen-space by showing his right hand in a PIP box.  Whats more inportant, seeing his right hand pick/strum or seeing the tabs?!?!

Its hard to tell exactly where Tom is fretting. Its still a bit of a guess without the tabs.  Especially when he's playing fast.  Makes trying to learn from this DVD difficult.  Tom does a lot of talking to tell you what he's doing, but that doesn't help an inexperienced player.

Overall, I'm being generous with the 2 out of 5 star rating. Would be better with more riffs/solos AND TABS!!!",1117152000,17,1045,4.526881720430108
