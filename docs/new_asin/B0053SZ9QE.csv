8455629,5,B0053SZ9QE,"I have always been a fan of Bollywood cinema, and of course I am not the only one. But just recently I started to get into Tamil cinema and I love it. It is very Modest and filled with great actors and music. I recommend this movie to any bollywood fan, they will surely enjoy Kollywood. The actors Vijay and Asin(Who starred as Kalpana in both bollywood and kollywood ""Ghajini"") have great chemistry and you will fall in love with them. My only complaint is that I wish this was available in DVD rather than blu-ray exclusively.",1338249600,,529,4.463917525773196
