I recommend this for people who want to do something at home, and just a warning, you will be sore the next day!  (but that's good!)",1371513600,10,271,3.9814814814814814

5612607,5,B00BEZECEA,"I got this dvd after attending barre classes at exhale soho, nyc. The exercises are great for getting to the lean dancers body. I wanted to get healthy and tone but didn't want to ""muscle up"" . Ive tried hitting the gyms year after year but never got rid of "" lumpy knees"" and inner thigh until I tried this  . The barre method helps you use your own weight to do these exercises and the beginners cd is great for that.  The calories burn even after the hour routine. I tried comparing the calories in the exhale  barre (1300) vs a slimming series (850) with a resting burn of 860 cal vs 534 cal . my posture has improved and my knees and inner thighs are toned and butt well lifted! highly recommend the series.",1370908800,121,712,4.220588235294118
5612608,5,B00BEZECEA,"UPDATE Aug 2013: This workout gave me love handles! Not kidding. But it's a good thing ... here's why...

The tightening of the muscles up and around the top of my hip bone is so intense with this workout that where I previously had a nice (apparently) smooth round shape, the underlying muscles got so toned that the remaining fat around my midsection suddenly appeared like love-handles. Amazing results. And I expect the fat-burning that's occurring because of the additional lean muscle tissue will take care of the mid-drift fat in just a few more weeks/months. Good-bye love handles ... hello sexy! :)

I've been using this workout a few times a week for about 3 months now. I LOVE it! I've found that for me it's better if I still select to play the tutorials that come in between each of the 10-minute segments. I don't need the tutorials anymore. Instead I use the extra time to intensify my stretching. That has really helped my overall flexibility, wellbeing and lean muscle build-up.

ORIGINAL REVIEW May 2013:

This workout is challenging. I wouldn't say the workout itself is beginner level, rather the production of the video is extremely helpful for someone starting out. I say that because the tutorial segments are very clear and left no doubt in my mind about proper positions for the Core Fusion Barre method.

In fact, the voice-over throughout is very precise and helpful. I felt like I was getting a personal trainer's help to optimally position my body for the exercises. I got this video today and that's actually what I currently appreciate the most. The instructions are clear without being annoying or too ""cheerleader-y"" which I find can be distracting when I'm trying to concentrate on my workout.

I'm in my fifties and used to be a LOT more fit than I am now. Even so, I don't get winded going up four flights of stairs; and I can walk or bike for over an hour without breaking a sweat (flat terrain). So I have decent cardio fitness. But, this was definitely challenging to me ... I'm really feeling it... that inner-tingly feeling. And it made me wobbly in a good way :)

I watched all the tutorials first and found them so inspiring, I actually proceeded to do the video right away rather than procrastinate for a few days ... weeks :) The tutorial segments made me feel like I could really do this and the clarity built my confidence.

Then I tried to do it ... dang! I'm out of shape :) I couldn't finish a single one of the segments without taking a break.

I think that's actually good though. To me, that means I'm going to get my money's-worth from this. In the beginning the most value will come from the tutorials. Then as I return to fitness, I know I'll be able to finish the segments. YAY! And the tutorials are optional. I'll be able to play the workout without them once I get the positions memorized.

Here are the segments (IMPORTANT NOTE: Not all of the exercises use the barre, I'd say this DVD is about half barre, half floor & prop):

Turned Out Thigh ------ Tutorial 2:45 mins, Exercise 10 mins
Parallel Thigh --------- Tutorial 1:50 mins, Exercise 10:50 mins
Standing Glute Toner - Tutorial 1:40 mins, Exercise 10:50 mins
Glute Sculpt ----------- Tutorial 1:20 mins, Exercise 10:20 mins
Pretzel ------------------ Tutorial 1:25 mins, Exercise 10 mins
Flat/Round Back Core - Tutorial 2:35 mins, Exercise 10:50 mins
Pure Core --------------- Tutorial 1:30 mins, Exercise 10 mins

The times are rounded +/- a few seconds for ease of reading. Each of the exercise segments starts with a minute or less of marching-style warm-up except the Glute Sculpt section. There is no ""cool down"" section at the end of the video, rather there are a lot of stretches woven throughout the work-out. I really liked that. I can see where that will help restore my flexibility.

The workout focuses on the lower body and core. Your upper body gets worked out, but not overly or explicitly. Let's put it this way ... all of the burn I felt was at my diaphragm or lower. And I'll credit the tutorials for that. Because I usually tense-up my shoulders while working out... not in a good way. So, the positioning instructions helped me avoid that problem.

Two tiny things: The main menu was initially a bit confusing until I realized that the word ""tutorial"" should have really been a column header. If you get the video, you'll see what I mean. Just keep clicking to figure out how to play the segments with & without the tutorials. Not a big deal.

The other small thing is the soundtrack. Music is such a personal thing. It wasn't terrible, just not for me. I'm sure someone else would really like it. But I found the soundtrack was a bit distracting at times. I really wish these videos would have an option to have instruction-only. I'd really like to have the option to lose the slightly-annoying soundtrack if it's just not my taste. That way I could play my own music (or not) and just hear the instructions from the video.

All of that said ... I'm going to be buying more of these Exhale videos. This workout was awesome. I feel GREAT! And the energy encryption here is exactly what I'm looking for.",1368489600,303,5141,4.626783754116356

5612620,5,B00BEZECEA,"This is a great starting point for anyone who wants to try Barre. There is a tutorial, which can be skipped. This DVD consists of 7 workouts, which can be played continuously. Total: 70 minutes. What I like is that it hits every body part, as follows:
First: 10 minutes of arm work
Second & Third: Thighs
Fourth & Fifth: Butt
Sixth & Seventh: Waist and abs.
If you don't have time to complete the whole thing, you can do just the arm segment, one for the thighs, one for the butt, and one for the waist. Then the next day you can choose different segments. Don't feel discouraged if it's difficult the first time--you build up to it quickly, so just do what you can.
Another thing I like about this DVD is that it shows both a man and woman doing the exercises and from different angles, so you can tell exactly what your positioning should be. Also, stretches follow each segment, which are very helpful.",1502582400,3,905,4.392857142857143

5612653,5,B00BEZECEA,"I was looking to mix up my normal workout, so I decided to try out this DVD. I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. First, ignore the cover. The girl on the front has zero to do with the DVD. I'm pretty sure she's just a stock photo they used for the cover. There are two instructors who have been teaching and training other teachers for longer than I've been alive. They take you through every motion and explain WHY you're doing it and WHAT it is working and HOW it is helping you. The DVD is broken up in to 7 different 10 minute workouts that can be played all together or individually with or without the instructional introduction. I especially love that they stress form above all else and give plenty of modifiers to help you along the way. They flat out acknowledge that the exercises can be difficult and that it is perfectly ok to take a break or to modify to the easier movement. And let me tell you, you will probably need to take breaks and to use the modifiers. These movements are easy and intense at the same time. After about 3 minutes of the 10 minute leg workout, I'm drenched in sweat and my legs are slowly turning to jello, but man, it hurts so good. My only complaint about the DVD is that the actual workouts are voice overs, so often times they start the new movement before telling you what they're doing.",1462579200,25,1335,4.301587301587301
5612654,1,B00BEZECEA,"The quality of this DVD is awful! I was looking forward to an intro to barre-this looks like it was filmed in the 80s on VHS and poorly transferred to DVD. The sound sucks, the couple talks over one another and the workout isn't any good. Spend the extra $ and splurge on a barre3 or pure barre video. Upset I wasted $10 on this one.

5612655,3,B00BEZECEA,"Not a bad workout. I did,however pull a muscle in my back using this DVDs and would like to caution others to be careful when fully extending the legs during the exercises that have your back to a wall.

I feel angry for the producers for misleading me and therefore I don;t even really see the value that the couple deliver.

5612689,5,B00BEZECEA,This DVD helped me with my functional mobility/ balance/ tone/ flexibility. I recommend it to anyone wanting to get back to exercise or after training. I like to do 1-2 of these 10 minute workouts at a time as a cool - down after my kettlebell workouts. I don't get sore as I actively engage/ stretch the muscles and find these workouts therapeutic for muscle conditioning. I normally workout with a 20 pound kettlebell and will set it down for some martial motion like burpees/ sprawls/ and motions that used to be so tiring and too difficult. Now my balance is really good and I able to do workouts that I never thought I could handle. This DVD is great after a kickboxing and/ or kettlebell training. I also got other DVDs by Exhale and loving adding these 10 min workouts to my workouts. I feel it helped me with my balance so when I do the warrior pose and standing on one leg with a 20 pound bell I have no concern for injury or not being able to do it. My favorite one in this DVD is the standing glute exercises and a lot does happen with those small movements. I also like the core fusion power sculpt and they are more challenging then the beginner DVD but this DVD has the building blocks to empower you to do more.,1452297600,2,1226,4.288793103448276

I measured myself and found my butt and waist had shrunk.  That's when i really got into using all of the workouts.  I love the fact that the workouts are flexible and they stretch after and during each workout.  I have a sit down job, so my back muscles are always under utilized and used to cause me pain.

If I bother to put on my exercise gear, I'm going to do more than 10 minutes.  And there is a warm-up for each session, so it's not a smooth transition if you're doing multiple sections.  Some of this is not beginner level, so don't feel bad if you can't do it.  Also, there are parts that aren't consistent.  The warm ups vary quite a bit in length as do some of the segments.

5612824,2,B00BEZECEA,The wife bought this hoping to improve flexibility. The instructions are confusing and because they do them as a voice over there's no pause or explanation. Unless you're familiar with ballet I wouldn't recommend this video for flexibility/strength. I will stick with Pilates.,1402704000,5,276,5.441860465116279
5612825,4,B00BEZECEA,"First off, I think the only thing ""beginner"" about this DVD is that for each of the 10 min sessions (each focusing on a specific target area), a short warm-up/tutorial is given. The exercises/movements themselves are quite difficult to maintain for the session--at least this novice had problems! I was crippled after doing the 2 thigh sessions and the ab session. I will go back and try the DVD again but will modify the movements and session times depending on how my body's doing. I will ignore Fred when he says that your legs shaking is normal. That'll be my cue to back off. Seriously, if you're crippled afterwards and can't do it again for a week, what good is it? I personally think that since this is touted as a beginner DVD, an explanation noting that the tutorials are the beginner's help, but that the moves themselves are regular barre bodywork and modifications should be given as the participant works up to a higher level of expertise.",1401062400,,953,4.678571428571429

The moves that work the core are extremely difficult, especially for me (4 back surgeries!).

5612861,5,B00BEZECEA,These are two top notch instructors. You can feel the burn on these moves for sure. They do a good job of demonstrating and explaining the moves. I highly recommend.,1387929600,26,165,4.533333333333333
5612862,3,B00BEZECEA,THIS IS A GOOD WORKOUT BUT YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL.  IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER SUCH AS MYSELF IT IS EASY TO LOSE CORRECT FORM AND HURT YOURSELF.,1387756800,4,144,3.8
5612863,3,B00BEZECEA,Good instructional video for beginners. I was looking for a video to use when I couldn't make my barre classes. This video moves too slow for me. Great technique tips.,1386979200,12,167,4.6
5612864,5,B00BEZECEA,"great workputs, short enough to keep you coming back, thorough enough to give you results! give this dvd a try and you will be sold!",1385251200,16,132,4.32
5612865,3,B00BEZECEA,"Three of the seven exercises are NOT for the barre. They are floor exercises. I bought an exercise barre and purchased this BARRE video to do BARRE exercises. I do not want to do floor exercises. I hated them when I was 20-something and at that time switched to using Nautilus machines at the gym. I certainly don't want to do floor exercises at 50-something, which is why I won't even consider yoga.

The 4 barre exercises are great, though. Short, which means I'll actually make time to exercise every day. They had my legs shaking and burning. Small movements, nothing jarring, and great stretches. Even though some of the stretches for the 4 barre exercises were on the floor, I was able to modify them so I could do the stretches off the floor. As a result, I will keep this video. I just wish I could be certain when buying barre videos that they are actually ALL barre exercises.",1384819200,30,886,4.503105590062112
5612866,5,B00BEZECEA,SO not easy and painful but feels soooo good. I'm really surprised by how tough each part is. The workouts are only 10mi long but some of the toughest workouts I've ever done. Love it,1384646400,,183,4.257142857142857
5612867,1,B00BEZECEA,"There are better programs, after reviewing several I always find the exhale line to be less than satisfactory.  This DVD is no different.",1382400000,7,137,4.956521739130435
5612868,4,B00BEZECEA,Love it - it is a great workout video. The only problem is if you have bad knees the floor part is a little difficult.,1381190400,4,118,3.76
5612879,3,B00BEZECEA,"I was very excited about getting this dvd but am not impressed.  I'm someone who works out regularly and likes to change it up and challenge myself.  I read reviews of the DVD that made it seem like a workout that would challenge you, or at least feel it later, but that wasn't the case for me.

The couple is demonstrating the moves but the instructions are given via voiceover, which takes some getting used to.  You can choose which 10-min segment you want to do but when I did three in a row, because that was all the time I had, I didn't feel like I was given a strong workout.  This dvd is good for when I can't make it to the gym and want to do something but if you're looking for something to challenge yourself, I can't recommend it.",1380672000,4,742,4.160839160839161
5612880,5,B00BEZECEA,"I purchased this dvd because the 10 minutes were more time efficient. I thought, great, I could pick and choose how many segments to do at a time; little did I realize that neither my legs nor my butt would be on speaking terms with me after the first 10 minute session!  I do one segment about 5 times per week (along with walking  and some independent arm exercises) which doesn't sound like a lot of effort but believe me I feel every minute of it and I'm already seeing results.  The sequences have a minimal warm up included but I find that just fine along with the stretches done during and after the specific area of work.  I would say the only improvement needed would be to include some arm work.  I gave it five stars due to the simple but thorough segments and the fast results.",1379548800,11,789,4.304054054054054
5612881,5,B00BEZECEA,"I've been looking for an exercise routine and this sounded great.  Haven't started yet, but looking forward to it.  It got great reviews and I hope to be one of them.",1378944000,,166,4.32258064516129
5612882,5,B00BEZECEA,"I love this dvd. I had another barre dvd, but it went on too long, and I was never able to finish it - I'm sure I would have been able to with practice, but knowing how difficult it was was too daunting.

Anyway, I LOVE that this has a number of 10 minute sessions and awesome training tips. I frequently do 2 at a time.",1376092800,21,320,3.8484848484848486
5612883,5,B00BEZECEA,I loved this workout! Better than hitting the gym! Plus you save gas and time from having to drive to the gym. This is a real work out!,1375660800,4,135,3.857142857142857
5612884,5,B00BEZECEA,"Don't let the title of this CD, barre 'basics', fool you.  These workout are short (10 minutes each) but very intense.  I work out regularly and found all 7 of these workouts a challenge.  I do one 10 minute workout a day and have gotten great results.  I recommend this CD to everyone but caution those not familiar with core exercises; as noted before, these are intense.  You will be glad they are only 10 minutes.",1373760000,58,417,4.434210526315789
5612885,5,B00BEZECEA,The dvd came in the time allotted & I have been enjoying doing the segments.  It is manageable 10 min segments & that makes it very doable.  I intend to do 2 or 3 segments at a time now that i have been doing them 10 min at a time.  They are challenging & effective.  I'm very pleased with the dvd & the service from this company.,1373328000,5,330,3.8805970149253732
5612886,1,B00BEZECEA,"Hopefully, I have the paperwork to return it. The disc is broken.  I never considered the possibility of it not working so I do not know if I kept the paperwork.",1372896000,6,161,4.193548387096774
5612887,5,B00BEZECEA,Very little movement; but goodness does it work!!  I have a bad back and I'm able to complete this tape.  Highly recommend.  :-),1372032000,117,128,4.478260869565218
5612888,4,B00BEZECEA,"I think my understanding of barre was slightly confused. However the movements are well explained and repeated several times for clarity. If you're looking for something semi-entertaining, this may not be for you but if you want strength and balance training, the ability to focus on individual areas and customize your own program, this has some great basics for you, easy to perform with good results.",1371600000,13,403,5.121212121212121
8567437,1,B00BEZECEA,Not at all what I expected - I am doing Barre group classes and had hoped this would serve as a substitute for those times when I cannot attend class.  I didn't expect a complete match to the classes I take but this bore zero resemblance and I found it tiresome to do...the exact opposite of my classes which are exhilarating.  Would be nice if there was a way to view a clip of instructional videos before purchase.,1530403200,,416,4.32051282051282

8567442,5,B00BEZECEA,"I have almost all of the Core Fusion DVDs and use them regularly.  This DVD recycled 3 (out of the 7) 10-minute routines from the Pilates DVD, but the others were new.  Workout went by quickly and was very enjoyable.  I felt like I was working muscles that normally don't get a lot of attention.  And the stretching component of each section is a wonderful balancing to the strength.",1523404800,,383,4.507246376811594
8567443,5,B00BEZECEA,"Great workout video. I agree with the other reviewers; nicely done - helpful instructions, good for older adults, low impact, and great to help with strengthening and balance.  It is broken into segments so you don't have to do all at once; however, I find I like doing the full workout.",1521676800,,287,4.627450980392157

Instead I got  the right cover but the wrong DVD . Exhale/ Core Fusion Barre Basics is not what I need.  How do I return it?",1518480000,,276,4.269230769230769
