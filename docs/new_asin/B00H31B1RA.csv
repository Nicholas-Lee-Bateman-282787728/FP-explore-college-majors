6129629,5,B00H31B1RA,Dave Stotts never fails to deliver an informative and entertaining series.  This one is especially good.  I was wishing he would stay a little longer at each place as I was enjoying them so!  His videos are so great for young people too as he makes history come alive.  It can never be said that Dave Stotts is boring!!!,1396569600,13,320,4.372881355932203

6129635,5,B00H31B1RA,"We recently returned from a Holy Lands tour of Israel.  Although this series seems geared toward a 20-40 year old age bracket (like it's host), we found it entertaining and well-paced for us (we're in our 60s).  The occasional humor is sometimes a bit quirky and zany, but that adds to it's watchability for us. Could be a pretty dry topic otherwise.  The accuracy and educational value is high and very respectful of religious sensibilities.  As my wife commented, the series keeps the memories of our recent tour of the ""footsteps of Jesus"" alive. Excellent graphics and production values.  Highly recommended!",1467590400,5,612,5.01980198019802

6129638,3,B00H31B1RA,"Good and funny, but filled with inappropriate historic visuals graphics. If you are fine with your 4-6 year old seeing semi-nude and nude characters from historic drawings filled multiple explanatory scenes in each movie, then go for it! Not at all appropriate for us.",1454803200,2,268,5.113636363636363

8629373,5,B00H31B1RA,"These videos are incredible and should be owned by anyone who is interested in biblical archaeology. They are not boring because Dave Stotts has an incredible sense of humor that will make you spit out your popcorn in laughter. His information comes from a biblical worldview and is very accurate, thanks to the help he had from biblical archaeologists such as Titus Kennedy and Joel Kramer in Jerusalem. A worthwhile investment for any serious Bible student and helpful for those with little to no background in archaeology or biblical understanding. I have been to all of these sites in seven previous trips to the Holy Land and vouch for this series.",1486684800,,653,4.891891891891892
