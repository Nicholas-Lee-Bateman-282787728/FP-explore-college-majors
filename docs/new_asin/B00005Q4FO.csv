7950110,4,B00005Q4FO,"I think Rick Steves did a good job at presenting the highlights of Austria and Germany.  It was easy to fast forward through parts of the video that did not pertain to our travels. Although I won't be traveling to most of the places on the video, it did give me a good feel for the German and Austrian culture. I especially liked the coverage on Saltburg.",1026000000,5,355,4.298507462686567
