7807371,3,6300251802,"The 1970s were prime decade for low-budget documentaries, such as Overlords of the UFO, Mysteries From Beyond Earth, UFO Journals, etc. The Outer Space Connection, from 1975, narrated by Rod Serling, is another example. This documentary was based on the book by the same name from Alan and Sally Landsburg (Alan was the same guy who also produced the In Search Of... TV series as well). Of all these '70s documentaries I've seen, this one has perhaps the worst picture quality. Some of the scenes seem rather dark and of faded quality, you can even be certain you've seen better quality pictures off a movie projector. But I can't say The Outer Space Connection is a bad documentary, it's basically the kind of documentary recommended to those who enjoy the campy low-budget documentaries. This whole film smells of Erich von Dniken. You hear Rod Serling narrate about how aliens from another planet came to Tiahuanoco (sp?) in South America, which became the descendants of Man. You have Dr. Thelma Moss of UCLA lecturing about Kirlian photography, and how she's done everything from showing the life forces of a fossile that's been dead for millions of years to the life forces of the fingerpads of a couple kissing to the ""phantom leaf"" effect. You hear stories about how the Bible tells the stories of alien contact, and how certain fires in the skies were likely UFOs. Plus you get to see a guy communicate with a chimpanzee by some device where he pushes a sequence of buttons and the chimpanzee response back by also pushing a sequence of buttons. Like von Dniken's works, The Outer Space Connection strikes me as a documentary in which there are very wild theories, but little to back it up, and no skepticism to balance things out. In other words, it's hard to take Alan and Sally Landsburg's The Outer Space Connection seriously, just like Von Dniken. Luckily Alan Landsburg's next project is something you could take a bit more seriously, and that's the In Search Of... TV series. So basically, if you like cheesy, low-budget documentaries in all its glory and all its flaws, you'll probably like The Outer Space Connection.",1052524800,,2135,4.836065573770492
