4235172,4,B003ZSI830,"I'm not really going to talk much about the movies themselves, but my opinion is that Open Water is a good film, and Open Water 2 is a laughably bad one.

As for the decision to buy this 2-pack blu-ray ($9) or the Open Water DVD ($3) it really depends on you. The video quality of the blu-ray looks just like a DVD (or worse, due to the source material) most of the time. They also have the same supplements. So, really, the decision comes down to two things: audio quality, and whether or not you want to own Open Water 2 to make fun of it with your friends. If you are listening to this movie with a 5.1 surround receiver, I say go with the blu-ray. The lossless audio track does sound pretty good and makes you feel like you're out there floating in the ocean with them. However, if you're listening through the speakers on your TV, you will not hear any difference, so save the $6 and just buy the DVD (unless of course you want Open Water 2.)",1360454400,8,947,4.174863387978142
4235173,2,B003ZSI830,"I bought this for a Christmas present for my husband, thinking my kids ages 7-18 would also enjoy a good shark movie. We couldn't scramble for the lost remote fast enough in Open Water (1) when a naked couple appeared on the screen for what seemed like forever before we finally turned off the TV, but not before seeing pubic hair. Nudity was not mentioned anywhere in this DVD's description, a serious infraction. I can't scrub those images from my kids' minds.

The story was ok, albeit somewhat boring, until the end, which offered no satisfactory ending. I know this is a true story, but to be good, the couple's deaths should have been framed inside another person's story--coworkers, relatives, friends, etc,--to show how living people were impacted by their deaths and give the viewer some sort of payoff for watching.

The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because I appreciated the effective clean camerawork and I didn't feel like I was watching a low budget film, and there are two movies on this disc for the price of one. I have not yet viewed Open Water 2, but even if fantastic, it would not up my rating of this movie set because of the significant problems with the first movie.",1357257600,,1213,4.611111111111111
4235174,3,B003ZSI830,"dear amazon,that was a sad movie but it was good. by now you should know that if you go for a boat ride you need to tell the driver to watch out for iceberg (see titanic review). but if you ever go for a swimm in the ocean, theres a few important rules you need to observe carefully if you don't want to end up like those poor people in the movie. first, make sure you have your life jacket on. mom says its very important. she says only fools go swimm without their life jacket. 2nd, if you jump off the boat for your swimm, make sure you advise your frind on the boat and make sure that they go easy on boose and wine. mom says this will help prevent ""miscommunications and unfortunate events"". you see, thats what happen to these poor people amazon. they weren't very lucky. in the 2nd movie, they just couldn't get back on the boat! which brings me to my 3rd rule: make sure that at least 1 responsible and sober person is still on the boat and is watching you. mom says she would never go on a boat ride with that bunch of fools. anyway amazon, you be careful and you watch out for hungry sharks in the water.

your frind kent",1354838400,4,1131,4.117647058823529
4235175,4,B003ZSI830,"I got the set fast!

I have to say that Open Water was kind of blurry at some parts...but I think that was due to the efforts of trying to convert it to Blue-Ray.

Open Water 2 was awesome!",1299801600,2,189,3.8205128205128207
4235176,5,B003ZSI830,"On more than two occasions, I have mentioned that I am a huge fan of movies with small budgets, shot in a reduced number of locations, and without special effects. If you can entertain a crowd for the total length of a film under those conditions, you are a real filmmaker and storyteller. And they can make money, too, like the widely successful ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999). In 2004, a very smart film that fulfills those requisites, and that I truly enjoyed, was the riveting ""Open Water,"" which was critically acclaimed and had a good box-office. Following its success, another electrifying installment, ""Open Water 2 - Adrift"", was made a couple years later. Now, thanks to Lionsgate, both titles are available in one spectacular Blu-Ray set.

Based on true events, and written and directed by Chris Kentis, ""Open Water"" is about a couple that goes to the Caribbean to spend a holiday. Once there, they decide to go scuba-diving with a group of like-minded people. The boat goes far away from the coast in search of a great spot, which they eventually find. However, at the end of the activity, the person doing the head count of the participants inadvertently missed the couple, leaving them behind in the middle of nowhere. As you can imagine, terror follows, as these two human beings try to stay afloat and get help.  On the other hand, ""Open Water 2 - Adrift"", which is also based on true events, but helmed by Hans Horn, follows a situation similar to that of its predecessor, but is more ambitious, as it involves more people. Here, three couples, one of them with a baby, sail on a yacht in Mexico. While at the ocean, they stop for a swim; one problem takes you to next, and none of the vacationers are able to get climb back to the yacht. So, the six humans beings are on their own at sea, trying survive together, all this while the baby stayed alone on the boat.  As you can imagine, both stories in both movies make for great, imaginative, and full-of- possibilities suspense.

The cast in ""Open Water"" and ""Open Water 2 - Adrift"" was composed mostly of unknown actors, which worked out well, because the stories and directions were strong enough to carry the films. You decide which one you like most. The Blu-ray edition of ""Open Water"" includes audio commentary by cinematographers Laura Lau and Chris Kentis, and actors Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis; deleted scenes; and a making-of feature. ""Open Water 2 - Adrift"" includes a making-of documentary. ""Open Water"" (USA, 2004, color, 81 min plus additional materials), ""Open Water 2 - Adrift"" (Germany, 2006, color, 94 min plus additional materials).

4235177,2,B003ZSI830,why is it the blu ray edition has to come with Open Water 2? The movie is horrible. Open Water 1 is a great movie but will not buy this version even tho price is cheap. If they decide to release Open Water 1 on it's own I will buy it. Open Water 2 is a waste of space.,1285545600,3,268,3.559322033898305

It changed my life - spiritually, emotionally and physically. It's a must watch. Not good for kids due to excessive use of the F# word.",1456012800,,274,4.392156862745098

8410818,2,B003ZSI830,"Open Water was slow, boring and badly directed. The acting was atrocious. Heard from many it was one of the best shark movies ever made, but it was pretty horrible, and the quality of the Bluray was terrible - literally the worst Bluray I've ever watched. Worse than even any DVD I own. It literally looked like it had been shot on a flip phone from 1998 and then transferred from an old projector off the wall of a barn. I'd skip this unless you are a serious fan....of garbage. I didn't even bother watching the 2nd one as the first was so bad. I give this two stars instead of one as the film-makers had a low budget and actually producing something.",1497830400,,653,4.317073170731708

8410825,4,B003ZSI830,"Open Water was not shot with HD cameras, so the blu ray transfer looks terrible. It looks more like DVD quality. However, the movie itself is a very intense movie, which I would highly recommend. Open Water 2 looks beautiful on blu ray, but is not nearly as good as the original. Overall, good price to add both of these movies to your collection.",1458950400,2,347,4.4375
