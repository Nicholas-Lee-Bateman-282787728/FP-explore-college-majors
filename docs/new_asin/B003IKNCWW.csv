8397454,5,B003IKNCWW,"This is an exceptional Silent movie that everything about works flawlessly. All these decades later, it continues to hold up magnificently, not feeling at all dated or dull. The film conveys a very strong sense of time, place, and genuine feeling. I've watched, and very much enjoyed, dozens of great Silent films, and, to date, own about twenty, that I consider the cream of the crop and most durable and appealing, on DVD. This is definitely one of my absolute favourites in my collection. The close to 90 minutes fly by as you become thoroughly engrossed in all that's transpiring in the solidly told and well realized story. Picture quality is excellent, with just a brief moment or two here or there where you notice a significant rough spot. Otherwise, condition is beautiful. The movie is accompanied by a gorgeous new score, that ideally enhances the viewing experience. I recommend this DVD, without reservation, to anyone who is a fan of Silent movies or simply of terrific movies in general. (I am pretty certain that even someone who normally doesn't think they care for Silents, or even for black and white movies, would enjoy and fully ""get in to"" this one.) The poignant and honest performances by leads Lars Hanson and Pauline Starke, in this all-around perfectly cast treasure, are searing and heartbreakingly spot-on. This is one of just two or three Silents that has managed to choke me up and bring tears to my eyes. I believe that, if you give this movie a try, you'll love it as much as I do. I give it a perfect 10 out of 10 score!",1318723200,7,1554,4.675182481751825
