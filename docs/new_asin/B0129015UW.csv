Bringing the epoch of the 1950's worked very well as it is a subject that can be changed to different times without being a problem with the plot. I would love to have another Werther with Elina Garanca in the title role, it is now 11 years since this performance and her voice has matured in this time so it would be interesting to see a new performance.
This is a really great Werther and it is highly recommended.",1453852800,7,935,4.672727272727273
