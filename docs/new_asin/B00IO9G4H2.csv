8643971,5,B00IO9G4H2,"I've started both, then other matters interfered.  Am looking forward to getting into these movies.  I've read about them over the years, but never saw them as a child, as I recall.  In the fifties, on Saturdays, we didn't have cartoons, but they screened on TV Andy Hardy movies and oldies like Phantom of the Opera, the Little Rascals, the East Side Boys, etc.  We did see David Copperfield, Little Lord Fauntleroy, the Flash Gordon and other similar shows, and Tarzan with Johnny Weismuller.  But never did we see Elizabeth Taylor as a child, etc.",1492041600,,550,4.747368421052632
8643972,5,B00IO9G4H2,"Films  that truly show what a family can be are hard to find these days. The tendency today to make ""comedy"" that's not very funny, rather a collection of sniping or rude remarks at the expense of others' feelings, if those feelings are even portrayed. ""National Velvet"" has a remarkable woman, Anne Revere, as the wise and loving mother who encourages her daughter, Elizabeth Taylor, to follow her dreams then lets her find her own wisdom when the time comes to ""go on to the next thing.""  Mickey Rooney plays his character well and shows his growth too.  Donald Crisp is a fun character who does show his own insight at times and sees his children as separate individuals as they grow up and accepts them.  Butch Jenkins is just plain funny as the youngest of the children. "" Lassie Come Home"" is the Classic film about a dog trying to get home to ""her"" boy and the interesting people she meets on the way.  Elizabeth Taylor was even younger than in ""Velvet"" when she made this film with Roddy McDowell.  Edmund Gwenn plays a tinker who Lassie travels with for a while.",1481328000,2,1071,4.523316062176166

8643975,5,B00IO9G4H2,"I still haven't watched National Velvet, but Lassie was a big hit with my four-year-old twin nieces. It's a classic that wears surprisingly well. Image quality was good for both films.",1435017600,,184,4.967741935483871
