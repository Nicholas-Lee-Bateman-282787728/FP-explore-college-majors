8408633,1,B003Y4ZCS4,"Do you like hearing random nobodies talk about why Led Zeppelin was great & recite the band Wikipedia page to you? Then this is for you. If you like watching the band perform, then go get The Song Remains the Same or the Led Zeppelin Collection. You're welcome.",1349740800,2,261,4.458333333333333
8408634,4,B003Y4ZCS4,"It was an informative DVD. It spoke at length with sessions and blues players from the British scene (late 1960s) about what the Yardbirds were about, how they reinvented themselves a couple of times with Clapton, Beck and then Page, and how they later gave rise to Zeppelin.",1292976000,2,275,4.75
8408635,1,B003Y4ZCS4,"WARNING; It is a mere re-packaging of ""LZ: Origin of The Species""--another of the leech-filled music DVD business that features a few common video elements and photos with mostly so-called ""industry experts"" critics and a couple interview bits with other players talking about LZ.
AVOID.
If you want to know about the Universe's greatest group ever, get their official DVDs and study the magic of the men who made and played the music.
Or save your cash and troll through YouTube for videos.
These evil shabby misrepresenting products need to be stamped out soon.

AWFUL. SAD. MANIPULATIVE.  IT deserves a negative 10 review. Amazon won't let you publish a zero review anyway.",1291161600,28,676,5.026785714285714
