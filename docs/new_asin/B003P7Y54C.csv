8401912,2,B003P7Y54C,"The stregnth of this video, in the Globe Trekker tradition, is its ""on the spot reporting"" of slave auction sites in Africa and Caribbean plantations, but some of the young commentators try too hard to be cool,or ""relevent"",  for their imagined audience and the overall effect becomes sloppy.  Some of the video footage is out of place, or tangentially related to the subject, and seems to be there just because they wanted to have, for example, a commentator dressing up for a Brazialian Carnaval parade.
If you are looking for a good Slave Trade video for a History class, a better choice would be Slave Ship, by Discovery School",1383523200,,631,4.779816513761468

8401914,5,B003P7Y54C,"This film is an excellent introduction to the transatlantic slave trade that makes it accessible to mainstream audiences who remain largely ignorant of this important but painful topic.  The hosts bring the subject alive through visits to important sites, from the coastal dungeons that held slaves waiting for the middle passage to power centers in Britain and plantations of the antebellum American South that benefitted from slavery and the slave trade.  While critical of the power structure and unflinching in contronting the painful realities of the subject, the film avoids being shrill, self-righteous, or gloomy.  It raises consciousness without demoralizing the viewer.  The footage, quality of the interviews, sound track, and overall unity of the production are first rate.  I highly recommend this for all viewers, and as an educational resource for middle, high school, and college teachers.",1362096000,3,905,5.528985507246377

But is was information. I would prefer to not have
purchased this DVD.",1351641600,,118,3.9583333333333335
8401916,4,B003P7Y54C,"This video was produced some years ago.  Whilst not a current look at Nepal, it is still very informative.  Nepal is a fantastic country to visit and this will give an interesting insight into its culture.",1342137600,,205,4.666666666666667
