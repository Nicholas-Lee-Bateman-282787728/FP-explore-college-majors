7893011,3,6305676917,"The ""Product Details"" section curiously does not mention how many episodes per DVD. Call me crazy, but I like to know what I am getting when I make a purchase, including the names of the episodes.

I had to research other sites to figure out not only which episodes are listed, but how many.

Here is what I determined, for those still trying to figure it out:
A ""volume"" is one DVD with 5 episodes, usually from the same season, but not always.
A ""boxed set"" is made of 4 volumes, for a total of 20 episodes.

Episode lists by volume may be found on some other Rifleman websites.

There are 6 boxed sets currently in release, for a total of 120 episodes available for purchase. There are 48 episodes not currently released.

Also, I cannot believe that none of the other reviewers address the incredibly steep price! At $500 for a new set which includes only 20 episodes, that's $25 per episode! I love the show, but I can't justify that price...

For the producers of the DVD, it is absolutely ridiculous not to release the DVDs in broadcast order.",1337731200,17,1050,4.471204188481676
7893012,5,6305676917,"I'm in my twenties, and I love The Rifleman. It's good, clean family fun, and Chuck Connors offers an engaging and unforgettable performance as the title character. Please release a complete five-season set of this stellar TV series so that we younger generations can fully enjoy it.",1329177600,3,283,5.042553191489362
7893013,5,6305676917,I highly recommend the Rifleman series as a wonderful family show. It has old fashioned values and clean cut fun.,1322870400,,113,4.7
7893014,5,6305676917,I WAS WAITING FOR THE DVD FOR A LONG TIME. MY SET IS NOW COMPLETE.,1245888000,,66,3.466666666666667
7893015,5,6305676917,"I agree with others here who have requested that THE RIFLEMAN be afforded the quality release of a ""season by season"" in order of broadcast.  Pristine quality video and audio is necessary to us who love this show, as well as completely uncut episodes with original opening and closing credits for each episode.  There should also be audio commentary tracks on episodes as possible by any of the original cast (Johnny Crawford who plays Mark McCain would be the best if he could do this).

Any available additional extras would be most enjoyed.

This show is currently broadcast on the ""Encore Westerns"" channel and the source material appears to be in perfect condition so I know whoever owns the rights to this show has the best source prints to make this happen for us fans.

So, please, if you're a fan of THE RIFLEMAN, and would love to own this show on DVD in it's entirety, please voice your opinion here so that one day (hopefully soon) we may be able to enjoy this show again and leave generations this treasure that today's television could never come close to replacing.",1209686400,30,1080,4.663157894736842
7893016,5,6305676917,"I am happy to have a selection of ""Rifleman"" television episodes available for purchase, make no mistake about it. It is my personal favorite classic television western, and I am a very devoted to the series. I grew up watching it during my pre-school years, and have remained a fan ever since. But the current DVD offerings simply do not do justice to the legacy of that show.

 What is needed is a COMPLETE, unedited season-by-season collection of ""The Rifleman"" series. And by complete, I mean the episodes MUST include the origial introductions (there were four variations that were used during the course of the series), original TV trailers, and perhaps commentary by Johnny Crawford, Patricia Blair, etc. The current DVD offerings simply are not true to the originality and flavor of the series in this regard.

 Moreover, the current selections seem to be based upon guest star quality. Some of the very best ""Rifleman"" episodes did not necessarily feature big-name guest stars, but were superb simply because of good writing and strong characterizations from some rather obscure guest stars, as well as the regular cast.

 So many fine, classic television series are now being released in their entirety on DVD today. Is it not time that ""The Rifleman"" was afforded this same level of respect and importance? Countless fans would love for this to become a reality.",1090800000,145,1373,5.0
7893017,5,6305676917,"My rave review of the first boxed set of ""The Rifleman"" remains true for this second set of 20 episodes.  The quality remains as high as ever.  This really was a superb series.
For some reason the compilers  have, this time, decided to present the episodes in alphabetic order across  the four tapes.  I personally would have preferred to see the shows in  episode order, but I can live with the decision.
Here is the list of  contents.  The numbers in brackets indicate the Season and overall  ""Episode Number"" (e.g. ""5/164"" means Episode #164,  shown in the Fifth Season).
VOLUME 5 - The boarding house (1/22, with  Katy Jurado) - The brother-in-law (1/5, with Jerome Courtland) - The bullet  (5/164, with Richard Anderson & Harold J Stone) - Dead cold cash (3/85,  with Ed Nelson) - The hero (2/59, with Robert Culp)
VOLUME 6 - The  indian (1/21, with Michael Ansara & Herbert Rudley) - Lariat (2/67,  with George Macready & Richard Anderson) - Mail order groom (2/56, with  Peter Whitney & John Anderson) - The martinet (3/83, with John Hoyt) -  Miss Bertie (3/90, with Richard Anderson & Agnes Moorhead)
VOLUME 7  - The most amazing man (5/152, with Sammy Davis Jr & Richard Devon) -  New Orleans menace (1/10, with Akim Tamiroff) - One went to Denver (1/25,  with Richard Anderson & Jack Kruschen) - The prodigal (2/71, with Lee  Van Cleef & Warren Oates) - The safe guard (1/8, with Sidney Blackmer  & Claude Akins)
VOLUME 8 - The schoolmaster (3/86, with Arnold Moss  & Jimmy Fields) - Three-legged terror (1/30, with Dennis Hopper) - The  Wyoming story, parts 1 & 2 (3/96 & 3/97, with Dabbs Greer, Kent  Taylor & Russell Thorson) - The young Englishman (1/12, with James  Coburn)",951004800,29,1688,4.656462585034014
