8085484,5,B000BD7NKQ,"Rick Stein's Food Heroes of Britain is the quintessential cooking programme and the ultimate pre-dinner/pre-cooking motivation.
No other celebrity chef has the charismatic, almost hypnotic voice of Rick Stein. He is to cooking commentary what Peter Alliss is to golf broadcasts. I particularly love Rick's British series because it takes a real look at food production and cooking from the old world that commonwealth countries spread. Looking at how Britain's earthy, country, pastoral, village type folk and how they use centuries old food production and cooking techniques takes one back in time. If you buy no other cooking programme, buy this one. Ricardo Silverburn, children's author",1467331200,,690,5.518867924528302
