2170864,4,B00066VUAW,"A bitter, alcoholic ""religious"" father has an unnatural hatred for his wayward daughter Anna (Eartha Kitt) and when his greedy family hatches a plan to marry her off for money to the college graduate son of an old family friend, the old man nearly has a seizure. But he's brow-beaten into retrieving her by his scheming son-in-law. The father drove Anna out of the house years ago due to her alleged promiscuity and she's now a waterfront prostitute and the sometime girlfriend of sailor Danny (Sammy Davis Jr.). She's down-and-out so she reluctantly returns home with her father. But the unexpected happens and she falls in love with the young college man. Then the stuff hits the fan as the wedding day draws near as the father has plans of his own. Based on Philip Yordan's play, this b&w adaptation is juicy and well acted. Kitt is good as Anna and Davis Jr. matches her as the footloose Danny. The entire cast is in tune with the tone of the script and the underlying theme (incest) surfaces despite the restrictions of the time. Davis sings the title song and even gets to show off his dancing skills. The DVD looks good and is worth a look for those interested in rare, unusual films. Very adult for the time and very well done all around. Recommended.",1106611200,60,1259,4.6

2170871,1,B00066VUAW,"Earth Kitt was a great vocalist, but this didn't let her shine as an actress in the title character. With the exception of a couple of the minor players in this movie, a lot of the dialog and acting seemed stereotyped and either underacted, or too far over the dramatic line to be believable. Sammy Davis must have had a clause in every movie contract that he got to either sing or dance, or both. Although he plays a sailor turned cab driver, the movie works in a ""dream sequence"" in which he performs some modern dance moves. The scene was totally out of context to the role he was playing, even if you can believe that ""Anna"" was drunk and imagining him performing this modern interpretive dance sequence for no connected reason with the plot. The best actor in the film was the bartender. He seemed to be the only one who could deliver lines that sounded not over the top and naturally reactive to the rest of the actors. ""Rudolph"", the suitor and husband of Anna as ""the good girl"", is portrayed as a college graduate who doesn't seem to have an offense limit in his interactions with Anna's family, who make it absolutely clear that they're husband-shopping for their ""reformed"" bad girl. He's portrayed as being either so innocent/dumb/doesn't-get-it that you wonder how he made it through college. I watched the entire movie because of the actors and the genre, and it was entertaining, but like a badly-acted play you continue to sit through because you hope it's going to get better.",1447286400,,1493,4.637735849056604

Their performances were complex and reviting. When the film ended you realized that you had been taken to a place that was dark in the beginning, but heart warming and transformational by the end.",1406937600,4,376,4.769230769230769

2170887,3,B00066VUAW,I was impressed that a black woman was starring in her own movie.  However I expected to see more of Sammy Davis.  It was obvious they used his star power as a draw because his role wasn't totally prominent.  The premise of this movie is more about her crazy father that has the nerve to be adamant in his strict Christian values yet he's a raging vindictive  alcoholic. His overbearing ways have created this wild child.  It's a good examination of the value systems and family expectations of the era.  The comedic nuances are funny too!,1363737600,,539,4.5625

2170891,5,B00066VUAW,I am a Sammy Davis Jr fan but this would be fantastic classic cinema to any one I believe. It was such a powerful performance by all..not just the stars and I was really surprised and taken into their lives...It was so so much better than I thought it might be...the classic sets and filming was a treat...I think it is a must see classic that I only heard of recently...worth the bucks! I did find this in my local library!,1349049600,,424,4.246913580246914
2170892,5,B00066VUAW,This film is a great film and a must see!! Two great legends in the beginning of their careers; a joy to watch Sammy Davis Jr and Eartha Kitt at such a young age and time in their careers. This may not be a good movie or story because it appears to be a negative story told; but just to see them together in the early stage of their careers is worth it; well as to collect it and watch it.,1346112000,,389,3.814814814814815
2170893,5,B00066VUAW,"I forgot about this movie and how excited we were as a group of African Americans to see us on the big screen.  This movie was a big hit when it came out in the late 50's and the talk went on and on raving about Eartha Kitt and her great acting.  I enjoyed watching this time as I did years ago.

Thank you Amazon for keeping such a wonderful library of movies, music and books.",1344211200,,378,3.9473684210526314
2170894,5,B00066VUAW,"I enjoyed this movie because it really could have been about any family. It had all the essential ingredience. Love between parents and child, greed, conflict within the family and within one's self, death and regret and disappointment and a happy ending of finally finding what(to some extent) you're looking for. The acting was very well done. Eartha Kitt had a great air of sexual appeal without being over the top or looking like she was trying to hard. It looked natural and yet you saw her characters vulnerablity and old fashion standard needs in one (which I believe is in most of us) Sammmy Davis character was really different for him. No singing or dancing(for audience entertainment) only briefly connecting to the storyline. You liked him and you saw the same mixture of character in him as in ANNA, so one could see WHY they originally got together and you felt at the end he would attain what ANNA eventually did. Someone who loved her for herself. I enjoyed the movie. It was a telling STORY, with all the elements to make it POP. It was the various characters that made it  flow, without each ones role it wouldn't have made it as interesting as it was.",1337040000,2,1170,4.625
2170895,5,B00066VUAW,"This is a well made movie. Yes, some of the production value dates the movie, and we know the actors are either no longer acting or deceased, but the script is good and there is solid acting.

For those who only know Eartha Kitt from the 60's ""Batman"" series owe it to themselves to see her in this role. Sammy Davis, Jr., doesn't have much screen time, but he is nonetheless convincing. The rest of the cast is solid, and makes for a good ensemble.

I can't help but think this movie must have been somewhat progressive for the late 50's. Considering this was a high production movie released in 1958 and featured an all African American cast, it must have caused some ""buzz"" for the studio. Regardless, the movie stands on its own merits. It's effective in all the right places; you'll pull for the underdog, and loath the schemers.",1322179200,,834,4.516556291390729
2170896,5,B00066VUAW,"I love it.  I enjoyed watching this movie.  I still could not get the father.  I don't understand his attitude towards his daughter, when he was the cause of her hardships.",1310169600,,172,4.483870967741935
2170897,3,B00066VUAW,Uneven writing but great performances by cast. Eartha & Sammy are great together.  Wonderful cast. A couple of over the top performances by the parents.  Worth a watch.,1307145600,2,168,4.964285714285714

2170899,4,B00066VUAW,"Very interesting movie. I purchased this solely based on the presence of a sexy young Eartha Kitt. It turned out to be a very decent movie. The ending seemed a bit rushed so I took off a star, but it's definitely worth checking out!",1227571200,,232,4.295454545454546
2170900,5,B00066VUAW,"I read the life story of Sydney Poitier recently.  (Recommended very much)  This ""play"" was listed as one of the plays the young Sydney Poitier played in in summer stock.  That's why I have been viewing several of Sydney Poitier's films like ""A Raisin In The Sun""  (very highly recommended also).  This movie isn't quite up to ""A Raisin in the Sun"" but it's close.  The acting is superb,  the story is very involving,  the writing is clever, and the star power of Eartha Kitt and Sammy Davis Jr. is strong.  I think you'll miss a ""good 'un"" if you pass this one up---even though it was made in black and white---but don't get me started on that topic!  Boland7214@aol.",1183248000,2,668,4.491666666666666

Eartha Kitt was alright. Rex Ingram did a good Job as well.i like how this film was done. nothing was over the top.,1174435200,2,286,4.314814814814815
2170902,3,B00066VUAW,"What a delightful film this is.  Eartha Kitt really didn't impress me as the title character, but Sammy Davis Jr. was absolutely wonderful as Danny, Anna's fast-talking, wordly suitor.  Frederick O'Neal also does a fantastic job as Frank, Anna's wise-cracking and money-hungry brother.  Rex Ingram also deserves a mention as Anna's father, the man who kicks her out of the house after a youthful indescretion.  I had never heard of this film until someone recommended it to me and I'm glad I have it in my collection of old films.  For a film made during this era, it was funny without being exploitative or demeaning.",1171584000,6,618,4.847619047619047

2170905,5,B00066VUAW,"Anna Lucasta is a good movie in any era......Its superbly done and shows the great Eartha Kitt at the height of her sexual powers.......This was a sassy,sexy,beauty in her day.....She had  ""IT"" Just like marilyn Monroe did.

Sammy is at his best and brings energy and a caring side to his bad boy part.

This film also has a part with the actor James Edwards A fine actor and was really slated to play some serious roles before Belafonte or Portier but could not handle racism in the Industry and spoke out when he maybe should have kept his opinions private.

  Great Movie.. That deals with a lot of family issues.  A must see!! For anyone who appreciates that Black Hollywood era.

There are no stereotypes in this movie.  And interestingly enough, there are no white faces.  (Saying that because it was made in 1958) I found it a treat to see Eartha and Sammy during their prime.
