7844393,3,6303365094,"""Love Circles"" tells the story of a pack of cigarettes that goes from lover to lover in a chain of passionate one-night-stands. In a poetic twist, the pack eventually ends up back in the hands of the hot French woman who first had it.
It's kind of a porn version of the Kevin Bacon Game (no, he's not in this movie). In some way, hindsight provides a new interpretation of the symbolism--in this day and age, the cigarettes could represent any number of STDs.
Seeing ""Love Circles"" straight-through is a very bizarre experience. Back when the movie would appear on late-night cable, it was impossible to see more than fifteen or twenty minutes at a time without having to change the channel to avoid being caught red-handed.
When you were fifteen, this was probably the greatest movie ever made...but with the proliferation of the Internet, it's become pretty tame. Today's fifteen-year-old would consider ""Love Circles"" about as alluring as an episode of ""the Golden Girls.""
Nonetheless, it's worth watching for sheer nostalgic value.
Wait, I'd better go...someone's coming!",1052611200,4,1075,5.044943820224719
