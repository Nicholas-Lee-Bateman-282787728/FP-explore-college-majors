430976,5,6302120462,"This third Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan film was made in 1936 two years after the second and four years after the first. In it Janes cousins, a male and female, want to bring Jane back to England saying she would inherit a huge amount of money, and they will get money too if she returns; if she does not come back, they will get no money. They are accompanied to find Jane by a man who wants to capture Tarzan and display him in a circus, a desire he does not reveal.
The former film was criticized by the Catholic Church because of its display of nakedness and suggestions of sex. Also, in 1936, the film industry developed censorship. As a result, Jane was no longer wearing bikini-style very short clothes, but a dress, and the romanticism in the film was reduced. The film-makers substituted more violence than was in the former films.
Blacks are still mistreated in this 1936 film. They are called boys. No remorse is shown when on many occasions blacks are killed. Whips are used to make them comply to the desires of the whites. None are shown to be intelligent.
Some of the scenes in the film appeared in one or both prior films. Tarzan is caged in the movie. He thinks that Jane wants to go to England and leave him. Jane is captured by vicious natives.",1309132800,,1260,4.435344827586207
430977,5,6302120462,"""Tarzan Escapes"" is considered one of the best in the Johnny Weismuller series of Tarzan films. It's very entertaining with the typical mix of adventure, humor, good guys vs. bad guys, romance and the like.

 In this film, elephants are the heroes, coming to the defense of Tarzan ; the humor is provided by a member of the safari team; Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan) doesn't appear the first half hour and the action ends with some great film-noir like photography in a swamp. Along the way are an assortment of wild animals and birds, always interesting to view. It's a fast-moving 89 minutes.

Notes: 1 - The title is a misnomer. Tarzan doesn't get trapped anywhere to escape from until the last 20 minuets and he isn't in a cage long enough to warrant that title.  2  -  This film also is noted for it being chopped down a bit at the last minute. Apparently, a scene or two was a little too scary for preview audiences (giant bats in a swamp, for instance) so they edited it out at the last minute. They didn't re-shoot the material to make the transition smooth, so there are a few holes in the story's last 15 minutes. But it's nothing major and doesn't detract from the interesting adventure.",1241395200,,1194,4.530232558139535
431028,1,6302120462,"This movie has been cut from the original.  The real Tarzan Escapes had many more harrowing experiences including multiple crossed tree episodes.  This only had one, and it was even cut.  Don't buy this if you think you may be watching something you remembered as a kid on an afternoon after school.  Should not even be offered unless restored to the original...I want a refund",1201824000,,377,4.753846153846154
431029,4,6302120462,"Tarzan Escapes begins with two of Jane's cousins entering the jungle to bring Jane back to civilization so they can inherit money left to her. When they find her, they see that life in the jungle is not as savage and horrible as they expected; the treehouse is very advanced in this film. There is hot and cold running water, a fireplace for cooking meat, and other luxuries. However, Jane agrees to help her family by returning despite how upset Tarzan becomes when he hears this news. He also begins to hate the tour guide with just reason; he plans to trap Tarzan and turn him into a freak for a circus show.

This film is much more structured and commercialized than the previous two Tarzan films. The scenery is breath-takingly photographed although the studio took the easy way out in using stock film from the other Tarzan pictures for this one.

Maureen O'Sullivan is very beautiful and thoughtful here as Jane even with her fuzzy, untamed hair. Her costume is much more censored than in previous films.

Johnny Weismuller is more developed in this film than in the first two; he has more screen time and more ability to show emotion which he does very well. For the first time, we really get a sense of Tarzan's personality and his love for Jane.",1139616000,,1255,4.59375
431030,4,6302120462,"Ok..I should qualify by saying the third in the series for Johnny Weismuller.  While this film uses a lof of stock footage from the two earlier films it still stands on its own as a strong and rather violent entry into the Tarzan series.  Rita and Eric Parker, two of Jane's cousins hire a hunter to find Jane so they can convince her to leave the jungle and return home.  Captain Fry, the Hunter, has other motivations...he wants to capture Tarzan and take him back to the states to put him on dispay as an attraction, like an animal.  Tarzan is eventually capture but escapes in time to rescue the others who have been taken captive.

Not quite as action-packed as the first two films, it still has its share of harrowing moments including Tarzan's battle with a crocodile.  The chemistry is quite good, of course, between Maureen O' Sullivan and Weismuller and cheetah provides some comic relief.  Enjoyable with solid performances.",1118016000,,935,4.734567901234568
431031,3,6302120462,"The Tarzan  movies in the Weismuller series are like the Burroughs novels upon which they are based--the early works are impressive ,and as the series developed an air of routine set in .This follows on from the second of the Weismuller movies Tarzan and His Mate ,and while still enjoyable and tautly directed it is a lesser work than its predecessor .In fairness it should be noted that the work as we have it is not the movie as originally shot-preview audiences were reputedly upset by the violence ,reportedly quite graphic for its day ,and the movie was extensively re-shot .
As with Tarzan and His Mate ,this features an expedition sent into the jungle to track Jane ;her sister and her sister's  fiance are seeking Jane to advise her of a substantial bequest that needs her to return to London to attend to the formalities.
A white hunter takes charge of the expedition seeking to capture Tarzan.
The trek to Tarzan's lair is very similar to the one depicted in the earlier movie , even down to using some of the same footage in the native attack sequence .
Will Jane leave Tarzan for the bright lights ?Will the hunter's nefarious schemes work out or will right triumph ?
 You will have a good time finding out in this tautly directed and actionful movie which is quite intense in atmosphere and moves at a brisk clip .
One interesting aspect is that ,with the Hays Code having come into being after the previous entry ,this is markedly less heavy on exposed flesh -Jane's sleeping attire is decorous and the swimming scenes is minus the tasteful nudity of the earlier movie. On a down side there is unfunny comic relief courtesy of the Cecil Kellaway character and Cheetah -always for me the greatest irritant in the series -has more screen time than I would have liked .
Good fun and a strong entry in the series .",1062374400,,1825,4.574923547400612
431032,5,6302120462,"This is a tough and mean Tarzan movie. Johnny Weissmuller was the best of the loincloth-clad heroes and he gets you cheering in this one. It's good vs. evil all the way. Code of the Jungle.  A favorite of mine, this excellent film is a real testament to the notion of  ""kill or be killed."" This is a good hard-hitting action and adventure tale. It contains discriminating effects and ravishing photography. Good supporting cast. Great score. The villains once again meet their match in this realistic drama. A good one.",972086400,,519,4.7555555555555555

7821800,5,6302120462,"What I remember most about 1936's Tarzan Escapes - the marvelous third entry in the Weissmuller run - is Tarzan and Jane's tricked-out tree house. It had hot and cold running water, for cripes' sake! And a lift what's powered by elephant! I was a kid when I first eyeballed such clever contrivances and it struck me how awesome all that was. Now that I'm all grown-up... I still think it awesome! Anyway, the plot concerns relatives of Jane's - siblings Rita and Eric Parker (Benita Hume, William Henry) - who've come to darkest Africa to entice their cousin (and sudden new heiress) Jane to return home to England, else their uncle's entire fortune goes to some entomological society instead of only half going to it and the other half going to Jane. But credit the siblings for caring enough that, inheritance aside, they're genuine about reuniting with their cuz. Off we go on another jungle romp as our intrepid adventurers brave the hazards of terrain and climate and savages and rumors of great apes led by a Great White Ape. And, yet, the most treacherous element may lurk within their own encampment as their hired guide, the shady big game hunter, Captain Fry (John Buckler), secretly intends to snatch the ape-man and exhibit him in London as a freak show.

Tarzan Escapes has got a pretty interesting behind-the-scenes story. MGM was so all in with this movie franchise that when the finished product was previewed in October, 1935 and was poorly received by its audience - some scenes were too gory - the suits, instead of ordering touch-ups and reshoots, decided to scrap the entire endeavor and start fresh with a revised script and a new director, which is when MGM contract director Richard Thorpe came in. Thorpe was worth it alone for that sublime tracking shot, twenty minutes in, that reveals Tarzan's intro into the movie.

The action pretty much doesn't let up. The final half-hour alone is jam-packed with crazy action beats as Tarzan must spring himself from captivity and save Jane and her cousins who were ambushed and about to be brutally sacrificed by natives. But, high as it were on that sense of adventure, this movie sold me more on its other aspects. Three films in, Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan have worked out a marvelous alchemy. There seems to be ease and genuine emotion in their shared scenes. This movie advances and heightens their relationship, never mind that Tarzan and his Jane, on the surface, communicate in severely truncated English. I'm not surprised that O'Sullivan puts over her character's emotions so well; I've always thought she was a fine actress. It's Weissmuller who was the revelation, given his non-actory background and the limits imposed on his role. And, yet, without much opportunity for verbal expression, Weissmuller lets us know of Tarzan's unconsolable grief and bitterness at the notion of Jane's going away, possibly forever. It's nice that they have another romantic swim together. Sucks that the Hays Code was already being enforced as, this time, Jane keeps her damn clothes on.

One thing I never thought all that amusing, even when I was a kid, was Tarzan's monkey designated as the mischievous comic relief. One of the changes implemented for this re-do was the insertion of Herbert Mundin as the baddie's well-meaning, comically bumbling sidekick, Rawlins. Him I grinned at, didn't roll my eyes at.

Some gruesome stuff, too. A man from the safari is captured by tribesmen and tied to two trees, and, although it's not shown onscreen, the implication is that he's torn apart. There's also some awful racism going on - a scene in which Captain Fry goes to town whipping the porters and another one in which a porter plunges, screaming, off the cliffside but the crate he's carrying is saved, and Fry remarks, ""That was close.""

Tarzan Escapes reeks of glossy production values. MGM wasn't effing around with their lucrative franchise. The jungle photography is so convincing and the exterior sets looked so sweltering I had to turn on the fan because I broke out in sympathetic sweat. The storytelling is on point and professionally acted out. Our two leads are great, but props also to John Buckler whose turn as the nasty, conniving Fry made me want to punch him in the face just on general principle. Weissmuller is the face we still associate the most with the cinematic Tarzan, and this movie demonstrates why. It's a mean and dynamic movie in which survival depends entirely on who's strongest and most capable and most vicious. And, yes, that's Tarzan, pragmatically implementing his personal Code of the Jungle. So, yeah. Backed by a deeply invested powerhouse studio, and still partnered by one of my favorite and most beautiful actresses ever, and redolent with nostalgia and a giddy sense of adventure, Tarzan Escapes gave no reason for MGM to ease off on producing more installments in its franchise moneymaker. And that tree house, man!",1465689600,,4932,4.915966386554622
