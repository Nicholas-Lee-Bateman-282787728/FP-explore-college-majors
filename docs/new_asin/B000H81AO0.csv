Mexican comedy actor Tin Tan (German Valdes) stars as an awkward middle-aged funnyman caught up romping with young beauties (Ana Bertha Lepe, Erna Martha Bauman and Flor Silvestre) amidst various rivalries that operate on a number of overlapping levels. The first level centers on celebrating Joaquin Capilla (played by himself), the only Mexican gold-medal winner in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.  Throughout the movie his rivalry continues with the American diver/villain Gary Tobian (played by Richard Wilkie, a Mexico City College student at the time). The American beat Juaquin Capilla for the Pan American gold medal in 1955, but Capilla beat the American at Melbourne to win the Olympic gold medal. Their diving competition continues throughout the movie, mixed in with a second set of sports intrigue involving student rivalries between the National University (UNAM) and Polytechnico during American-style football games at the Olympic stadium. It is not easy keeping track of the whirling action that is full of laughs and tense sports rivalries, but it somehow works out well in the end.

8137498,5,B000H81AO0,"This film features several name actors, most notably beauties Ana Bertha Lepe and Erna Martha Bauman and leading male actors, Joaquin Capilla, Elmo Michel and Wolf Rubinski. Missing in action is longtime sidekick Marcelo. Elmo Michel plays a hilarious part, as El Ciego(the blind man) who is a Mr. Magoo type character who is always fumbling and bumbling around and wearing outlandish outfits as a result of his myopia. However, the star of the show is Tin Tan in a great performance, late in his career, that demonstrates his versatile talents as a funnyman. Forget about the fact that he looks to old to be a college student. The story evolves around the college campus and Tin Tan hooking up with Joaquin Capilla who is a serious student. Joaquin is shy about his talents as a swimmer and the ladies but soon warms up to them and makes the swim team in spite of the obstacles presented by taking Rodolfo's, the swim team assistants girl friend. Rodolfo is the nemisis of Tin Tan and Joaquin.  The adventures of Tin Tan are the usual predicaments that he always seems to find himself in. He always uses his wit and charm to get himself and friends out of trouble which is part of the fun. This is another musical comedy with several bands providing the music. The music is like Bill Halley and the Comets down- Mexico-way-type rock and roll. The dance scenes of the students is like swing or Mexibilly(just made that one up), where everyone is moving all over the place in a wild manner. The wrestling and swim scenes are pretty tight and well choreographed. If you like slapstick type humor, as only Tin Tan could deliver, than you will like this oldie. The copy I have is in black and white without subtitles.  Laguna Films and Pegasus Films are two companies that carry old Mexican movies like this if you are interested and having trouble locating that golden oldie. Anyway, this is a really fun movie and a nostalgic look at our innocence. Recommeded for many good laughs.",1172966400,,1979,4.651428571428571
