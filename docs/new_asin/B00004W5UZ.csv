7924839,5,B00004W5UZ,"Yes, the graphics are cheesy, the plot is predictable and the character development leaves little to be desired,  but consider the target audience for Bibleman is about 3-8, I can cut the producers some slack.  I purchased these for my 6 and 7 seven year old boy and girl for Christmas 2012 and they still watch them.

The lessons and morals taught on this level are outstanding.  Bibleman gives an accurate portrayal of biblical truth, yet maintains all the evil bad guy hero/good guy all kids love.

Excellent reinforcement for parents that are already teaching and training their children in biblical lessons or parents that want to provide a spiritual platform to educate their children, but may not know where to begin.

The prince of pride video is hilarious and my kids still talk about it",1382659200,,796,4.8161764705882355
7924840,4,B00004W5UZ,"This movie does an excellent job of depicting pride, a difficult and abstract concept for children, and how it affects and hurts people and relationships.  It also has a clear resolution and Bible verses throughout.  Of course there is action and music which entertains while teaching the core concepts.  Perhaps the 'rap' dance of the Prince of Pride is a bit long and gives more attention to this diabolical character than he deserves, but that is my only criticism of this otherwise instructional and fun film.",1370390400,,513,4.941860465116279
7924841,5,B00004W5UZ,Was exactly as advertised. No surprises. My students requested that I buy this one after seeing an advert for it on another episode. Couldn't find it anywhere until I found the ad. THANK YOU for making my kids happy.,1359936000,,216,4.564102564102564
