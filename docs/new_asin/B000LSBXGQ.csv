2713861,5,B000LSBXGQ,"This DVD is pretty easy to follow. The first time I tried it, I had to use the pause button to keep up with her, but after just a few times, I'm right on track with her. Although I find this work out challenging, I also find it relaxing because it forces me to increase my oxygen intake. Ana cues me exactly when to breathe, and I find that very helpful.",1219795200,,354,4.0
2713862,4,B000LSBXGQ,I've been doing the Pilates intermediate tape with Ana Caban for a month or two and wanted to try this to alternate between the two.  I've only done it a couple of times and think it is aptly named.  I found it was challenging and I was quite pleased that there were a significant number of exercises that were different from the Intermediate tape.  I find Ana Caban is very clear with her instructions and easy to follow.  Overall I'm pleased with it.,1206316800,25,452,4.409638554216867
2713863,4,B000LSBXGQ,"This DVD is really my first exposure to pilates, but I find the difficulty to be an appropriate level.  The 20- and 40-minute workouts both seem to be okay for a beginner or intermediate.",1184803200,10,187,4.5
2713864,5,B000LSBXGQ,"After taking classes, I now do pilates at home and love Ana Caban.  This dvd features some very creative and challenging pilates moves and the background is absolutely beautiful.  This would be appropriate for those who are intermediate or feel comfortable with her intermediate mat workout, and very challenging but still appropriate for beginners familiar with pilates.",1176163200,27,371,5.491228070175438
2713865,3,B000LSBXGQ,"I was really disappointed when I got this dvd because I love Ana Caban-I think she is a wonderful Pilates instructor. I have been doing Pilates for several years now and would consider myself at the upper-intermediate level, and although I really enjoy her ""Maintenance Pilates for Weight Loss"" DVD, this one was not as challenging and sort of boring, actually. I think it could be a good Beginners workout, but overall-save your money-there are definitely better Pilates DVDs out there.",1176163200,14,487,5.0246913580246915
2713866,3,B000LSBXGQ,"Some of the exercises are challenging and good. But others are confusing to follow as she does very poor explanations on movements that have very few repetitions. Her breathing instructions at times seem inconsistent with other pilates work outs. Okay but I have other videos that leave me feeling more challenged and satisfied. I do this one when I need to move, but don't have a lot of time.",1469664000,2,393,4.7101449275362315
2713867,5,B000LSBXGQ,This workout video is awesome. It's a perfect length of time that makes it easy fitting it in a few times a week! You will not be disappointed,1467849600,,142,4.107142857142857
2713868,1,B000LSBXGQ,The wrong DVD was in the package so I cannot review the product,1466812800,,63,3.923076923076923

2713873,5,B000LSBXGQ,"Whoa! The moves themselves are super easy, anyone could do them, but over and over again? That's the challenge! Even after a couple of months I still couldn't do the 'advanced' parts of the video.

Ana Caban has a great figure but isn't super thin,  which I have heard from others can be demotivational for them. She looks more like an average woman but in good shape than like a supermodel so it sort of gives you a sense of 'she can do it so can I'.

I lost 2 dress sizes in about 1 month while doing this and Rodney Yee's power yoga dvd on alternating days (5 days a week of exercise 2 days of no exercise) while eating healthy. I toned a lot of bra bulge and my tummy.",1451952000,,672,4.075757575757576

2713881,5,B000LSBXGQ,"One of my favorite exercise videos.  Ana Caban gives great instructions and after you familiarize yourself with the video, there's no need to watch it.  Her voice is your guide. I got in great shape, alternating this and some of her other videos 3-4 times a week for 3 months.",1412121600,,276,4.5
2713882,5,B000LSBXGQ,"I really like Ana Caban. Her videos give a great workout without leaving you sore and exhausted. I read a lot of reviews before buying hers. All you need is a mat. I have been doing her videos for a few months and can tell a huge difference. I lost inches when my kettle bell workouts did not do this. Being of the more ""mature"" age, these are a great workout, build strength and flexibility and won't injure you.",1410739200,,413,4.2405063291139244
2713883,3,B000LSBXGQ,"I purchased this DVD because I wanted a workout that was dedicated to the core.  This workout does work your core, but it is definitely not my favorite core workout.  The moves are all very similar and after I complete this DVD I really don't feel worked out.  I have other pilates DVDs that I really like, but this one is just so-so.",1399248000,,334,4.26984126984127
2713884,4,B000LSBXGQ,"I enjoy both pilates and yoga, and I ordered this just to add something a little different to my routine since I'm easily bored with workouts. If you're used to pilates, then nothing on this will surprise you. If you're not, then I suggest watching it through once to get a feel for the routines. Done right, you'll feel this workout, and it will feel great! Just a note of caution if you have a bad back (which I do) to move through it slowly the first time until your body can naturally adjust to the movements.",1394668800,,513,4.298969072164948
2713885,5,B000LSBXGQ,She has excellent abdominal pilates videos and work very well.  I have toned and lost belly fat using her videos.,1388102400,,113,4.65
2713886,5,B000LSBXGQ,Ana is great and I love working out to her DVD's. It is worth the price and a great workout!,1387152000,,92,3.65
2713887,5,B000LSBXGQ,"I love this workout.  When I have time to do the entire workout, not only do I feel like I'm getting a great workout, but I feel renewed.

The express workout is perfect for the morning before work.  My body loves how it feels...it's just right!",1376956800,,245,4.282608695652174
2713888,2,B000LSBXGQ,I have yet to feel the burn on my core. My core is more challenge with other Ana Caban DVDs such as Body Target Abs or Cardio Pilates. This exercise routine moves so fast I can barely get into the right positions and she is already on her second or third repetition (probably why I can't feel it). She does not do a great job with explanations in this one. I will continue to use it every now and then because I already spent the money but my advise: Save your money.,1373846400,2,467,4.086956521739131
2713889,5,B000LSBXGQ,Have tried this routine several times. It is a bit more challenging for me so tend to use others more but don't regret getting it.,1371168000,,130,4.24
2713890,5,B000LSBXGQ,Ana is amazing.  The exercises are challenging yet doable.  I very much appreciated the modifications shown by the other person in the video.  It helped me make adjustments when needed.  Her alignment and posture cues were fantastic.  If you want a wonderful Core challenge this is the video to purchase and use!!!,1370822400,,314,4.961538461538462
2713891,2,B000LSBXGQ,"I like Ana Caban, and the workout is not bad--- but it is so boring and the background music sucks. She doens't really explain the exercises all that well either. Not what i was expecting.",1364860800,,188,4.4
2713892,4,B000LSBXGQ,"And by feeling it, I mean, I felt this workout the next day. Not too long, not too difficult, great pace. Great at home challenge.",1364169600,,130,4.24
2713893,5,B000LSBXGQ,This is the best best best Pilates work out EVER. I have been doing Pilates for a long time and I have yet to see a better DVD than this one! AND AS A BONUS Ana Caban looks like a real person not a Barbie! lol,1362700800,,209,3.5652173913043477
2713894,5,B000LSBXGQ,This is one of my favorite Pilates DVDs.  It really works the right areas of my body and still allows for a good stretch.  I love that you can complete the workout in a reasonable amount of time.,1362528000,,195,4.105263157894737
2713895,5,B000LSBXGQ,"I really enjoy mat Pilates and practice daily.  I usually do the regular 32--starting with the 100.  I like this DVD because it offers a variety of exercises starting with leg:core  strengtheners.
They really give the quads and lower abs a workout !!
The express part isn't my favorite, so I just perform the main workout for 15-20 minutes as time allows.",1357776000,,355,4.693548387096774
2713897,2,B000LSBXGQ,It is a lot of the same stuff over and over again.  I wouldn't buy it again.  I don't like it too much.,1357516800,,103,3.4347826086956523
2713898,1,B000LSBXGQ,was on an intermediate pilates site and ordered the tape.  It is advanced!!!!!  It will never be used again or viewed again,1355961600,,123,4.545454545454546
2713899,2,B000LSBXGQ,"The work out itself is challenging. But, the woman's voice is sooooo annoying. Quick pace, gives a good workout, just wish I didn't have to have the sound on.",1351728000,,158,4.482758620689655
2713900,3,B000LSBXGQ,"Just purchased this DVD.  I have been taking  Pilates classes and I thought I would use this DVD over the summer.  I agree with Texalina,  I found this video to be intermediate to advanced. It should be labeled as such because it is not for beginners and the basics were not explained. I think that those who found this DVD to be easy are either in terrific shape or are not doing the mouvements correctly.
I also agree with Kathy Wright.  The camera angles are not the best. You sometimes have to wait a few repetitions before you can see the whole movement.  I guess after doing the DVD a few times this will not be a problem.  I was surprised that some commented that the pace was slow.  I found on the contrary, the pace was  faster than what I am used to in my pilates class which is slower paced but higher repetitions.",1336435200,2,825,4.2709677419354835
2713901,3,B000LSBXGQ,"As a regular Pilates practitioner, I found this video to be intermediate to advanced. It should be labeled as such because to those who have never practiced Pilates before, the basic 6 elements are not discussed, and throughout each movement, the basics are not emphasized which can lead to injury. This video, as so many out there, exemplifies why Pilates should be done in living color, with a Pilates instructor on hand to correct form, etc. ESPECIALLY when moving to intermediate or advanced sequences.

I do like Ana Caban as an instructor to those who already have a solid Pilates background.  For newbies, please go a different route.",1335657600,2,641,4.925925925925926
2713902,3,B000LSBXGQ,"This is an ok video.  I have only done the regular workout so my review is only for that part.  I bought this to use for days that I cannot make it to Pilates class as an alternate to my other Pilates video. The scenery is great, music similar to other pilates/yoga videos I've seen.  I'm not sure how to explain the level but I didn't feel like I had a very good core workout.  There were several hard moves but more for the quads than core. It was difficult to focus those exercises to the core.

2713903,4,B000LSBXGQ,Love this video. Gets heart rate up and she isn't obnoxious. Unfortunately it is not for beginners. Intermediate and up only!!,1318636800,,126,5.0476190476190474
2713904,2,B000LSBXGQ,"I find this DVD to have poor instruction, and the names of ""sets"" are unfamiliar to me. I feel like it may be outdated since it was released in 2007. I also don't like the lack of instructed warm-ups and cooldowns. It makes the experience feel disjointed. Overall it's difficult to follow what Ana Caban is doing, and the poor camera angles don't help. I also didn't feel challenged by this DVD at all, never broke a sweat even though I consider myself a beginner. Perhaps I'm not doing the movements right, but since there's no guided instruction I can't be sure.
I'm mostly interested in a quick Pilates workout I can integrate into my rushed mornings to help get me up and feeling awake.
Although I don't hate it, this DVD really just doesn't do anything for me, and I'm pretty disappointed.",1314403200,,794,4.559440559440559
2713905,5,B000LSBXGQ,"I love this pilates video for stretching and strengthening full body-arms, shoulders, neck, legs, stomach, etc. Very good overall workout.",1314057600,,138,5.95
2713906,2,B000LSBXGQ,"If you are looking to gently sculpt your abs, this might be a nice addition to your workout routine.  However, I did not find this challenging other than the teaser, which is always a challenge.  It was a nice, gentle pilates workout, but it did not cause me to break a sweat at all.

2713907,4,B000LSBXGQ,"As a Pilates enthusiast, I am always on the lookout for new workouts to add to my collection. My first DVD was the Abs workout with Ana Caban, which I found very challenging for a beginner. This DVD is more comfortable to follow after having practiced Pilates for over a year and since I am familiar with the technique, I found her instructions very clear and complete.

While I felt the pace could have been faster, the repetitions could have been higher, and there could also have been less rest between the different positions, it's a great DVD to complement an integrated Pilates lifestyle for those who are of the intermediate level.  The stomach massage series is extremely challenging (the toughest part of the workout) and I like that she includes a substantial stretch routine at the end of the workout. The 10-minute workout is great too, although I usually go for the 40-minute one or combine the two of them.

Ana Caban is always encouraging and calming during the workout and you can also tell that she is working hard to get through the moves, which gives extra motivation to us mere mortals!",1300924800,,1106,4.690721649484536
2713908,2,B000LSBXGQ,I've never really done pilates in the past but I heard it's good for strengthening your core (which I REALLY need). I think this video is too advanced for me and I wasn't really sure what she was talking about. I'll have to look up some words. I also don't have the core strength to keep up through the whole video. I wish she showed an optional way to do the pose if it's too advanced.,1296518400,2,386,4.092105263157895
2713909,5,B000LSBXGQ,I have other core pilates video but this one is the most challenging. It is not easy and if you do the main workout it might take you a couple of tries before you can complete it. My abs were burning within the first 3 min! The 15 min workout is just as awesome!,1283472000,3,262,3.8703703703703702
2713910,5,B000LSBXGQ,"I started doing the Bodyband workout and moved to Core Challenge. It is definitely advanced in most of the moves, but the results are stellar! In two weeks I got a completely flat tummy (I was doing it everyday). It is totally worth spending 40 minutes of the day to do this, it leaves you feeling refreshed and toned even from the very first workout.",1279324800,5,351,4.415384615384616
2713911,5,B000LSBXGQ,"I would agree with other reviewers who said that Ana Caban's Maintenance Pilates for Weight Loss is better, but I like to alternate this dvd every other day or so for a little variety.  Between the two the results have been amazing in toning up my ""powerhouse.""  I actually look forward to working out everyday with these dvds.  I have tried expanding with a few other pilates dvds out there and was unhappy with both.  I decided to stick with Ana Caban because she's the first pilates dvds I've tried and apparently the best for my workout taste!",1274486400,,547,4.551020408163265

I've tried Crunch Fitness pilates, 10 minute pilates and they were either extremely slow, boring or did not remind me to keep my lower back in the right spot.  Purchased as a twin pack at Target.....well worth it.",1267142400,14,378,4.295774647887324
2713913,4,B000LSBXGQ,"Not as challening on the abs as her ab workout video, but this is a great DVD. There is an ""express"" 25min workout as well as a full-length 45min workout. Both really challenge your flexibility and DEFINITELY work your core as a whole, rather than focusing just on your abs. I found that this workout really pushed my legs and back in wonderful ways. Great!",1261353600,2,357,4.507692307692308
2713914,5,B000LSBXGQ,Her cueing is right on and her tone is motivating but not annoying. You will feel this  if done properly.,1248307200,,105,4.25
2713915,3,B000LSBXGQ,"I like this workout, but it is difficult to follow for the following reasons:
1. The camera angles are not the best.  For instance, the instructor may say to start an exercise with your legs apart, but you can't tell visually whether to put them together throughout the remainder of the exercise.
2. You have to wait for one or more repetitions to find out when to inhale and exhale.
3. Instructor's pants sometimes obscure her feet, so you can't see the proper position at all times.
4. The ""meet the instructor"" section does not contain sufficient general information on pilates positions, breathing, core work and terms for one relatively new to pilates such as myself.

I think I will get more comfortable with the program as I use it more and more, as it appears this information can be derived from some portion of the instruction and then memorized for later use, but, when you first attempt to do the exercises, it is hard to discern the positions and the appropriate time to breathe.  I am also not convinced that I understand the proper way to use the core muscles in the exercises.  Nevertheless, it is a good program, and would be even better if you already knew these things, or could get them from another source.
AFTER USING THIS VIDEO FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS, I WOULD UPGRADE TO 4 STAR BECAUSE I EVENTUALLY CAUGHT ON TO WHAT WAS EXPECTED. IT IS VERY BENEFICIAL, BUT THE DIRECTIONS COULD BE MORE EXPLICIT.",1241049600,24,1419,4.596837944664031
2713916,5,B000LSBXGQ,"I have been doing pilates for at least 5 years now and I was sick of doing the same tapes over and over. I recently discovered exercise TV on demand and that is where I originally found this workout. They only have workouts for a certain amount of time so I ordered this DVD from Amazon. I got it home and was surprised the workout was 20 minutes longer on the DVD AND it came with a shorter express workout as well! I LOVED IT! I am pretty in shape and I found this to still be challenging and a really good workout. It's 40 minutes long and low impact, but if you don't have the time you can do the 20 minute express workout and still get a great workout. It not only works your abs and core but your whole body. I wouldn't recommend this for beginners however because some of the moves are very difficult and involve a lot of strength and balance. But Ana Caban is a great trainer and I would recommend her beginner and intermediate pilates DVDS to start off.",1237593600,11,962,4.17741935483871

8164086,2,B000LSBXGQ,"I am no Pilates expert by any means but I have taken quite a few classes and consider myself to be in good shape. I found this DVD to be frustrating 90% of the time. Not only does the narrator instructing you on the moves go far too fast but you also barely hold the positions for longer than 3 seconds. I felt like I was having to rush the moves the entire video. I didn't have time to focus on form or if I was doing it correctly, and before I even completed the first move she had already moved on. By the end of the work out it felt like a complete waste of time. It was like she was just told to give a crash course on some popular pilates moves but expected you to do the rest on your own. There were some great moves in there... I just wish I had time to actually do them. I gave it a two star out of five because it still does what it says it will do. It's a pilates instructional video but it's not like any work out DVD I have ever used. I wouldn't recommend this product.",1494374400,,982,3.866336633663366
