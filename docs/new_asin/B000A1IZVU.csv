The movie didn't succeed but a good try. I keep waiting for the dvd to be released. LOTS of looking and I found a used vhs on cdnow witch is better than a nothing. Annie sprinkle  does a guest scene in the film. Acting is defenetly 80's style but at the time it was great. Film is about a nerd that ends up living in the football frat house. He helps them pass a test on the promise of a date. He delivers the frat doesn't. After a wild long night the nerd wins the jocks girlfriend. The jock is expelled from school.
  Final: Great 80's Movie for the hardcore 80's collector Thank you",1189641600,4,727,4.06993006993007
