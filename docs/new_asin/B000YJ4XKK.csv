Good, practical way of looking at the baton.",1449360000,,112,4.380952380952381
8232998,5,B000YJ4XKK,"This material is just what you need if you are in a position to carry a collapsible baton. McCann addresses baton selection, carry, deployment and use both open and closed. If you pay attention you will realize that you are also inadvertantly getting a course on standard baton and kubotan techniques as well. So, this dvd is well worth it's cost.

Study it, and you will be well prepared to use this excellent alternative to lethal force.",1338249600,4,439,4.701298701298701
8232999,5,B000YJ4XKK,"This is a very good DVD, the price is reasonable considering some are asking twice as much.  The author spends some time on selection and carry, and then gets down to business.  His experience is obvious and I like how he cuts through the B.S. concerning other less than effective techniques.  He also covers, the decision between Uniformed officers and civilian use.  Identifies Red, Green and Yellow zones of attack, based on effectiveness and liability.  I think this DVD has done a great job in giving you the basics, without the fluff and useless moves. You should be able to watch this and review, practice with a partner and feel comfortable that you are a lot more prepared and confident.  Mc Cann also advises the walk away from danger mindset, which is always a better choice, as it may save you injury and a lawsuit or jail time later.  But if there is no other choice, he advises you not only the physical and metal mindset, but what to say in setting up a good case for self defense should legal action be taken.  Combining simple hand/weapon moves, you should be devastatingly effective.  I'm looking into his other DVDs on unarmed self defense.",1330387200,5,1159,4.669950738916256
8233000,4,B000YJ4XKK,"the original copy of this dvd is about $80.00. This appears to be a burned copy which I paid $40 for. I have no complaints about getting it for half, but this does not seem to be a legitimate copy. Kelly McCann is awesome and all of his products are extremely informative. Recommend the products but not this seller.",1269388800,12,316,4.372881355932203
8233001,5,B000YJ4XKK,"This two VHF video set is one of the very best on the use of the expandable(Collapsible)baton for self-defense on the street. As a retired police officer and defensive tactics instructor, I found this video set very interesting and informative. The McCann approach is based upon his Combatives for the street method rather than any formal law enforcement baton system. That does not take away from the value of this excellent video.

He covers the basics such as how to select the right baton, methods to carry, drawing the baton, blocks, strikes, takedowns and ground fighting with a baton. In conclusion, this is a fantastic video set for anyone interested in using a straight baton (no matter what kind) for practical self-defense and control on the street.

8233002,4,B000YJ4XKK,"I found this product to be in perfect condition when I received it.  I thought there were to be two dvds but I guess not.  Most martial artists and self defense practitioners choose one or two weapons they want to perfect.  I have chosen the callapsable baton based on its effectiveness and concealment properties.  This dvd is excellent for law enforcement or security personnel who want a beginner's insight to this very useful weapon.  Kelly McCann, in my opinion, is the premier self defense instructor out there.  The sad thing is it seems he only wants to train military, law enforcement, private security industries so good luck finding a seminar for us average folks!  But to his defense in that area...he is an all business type of guy and most of the ya hoos who show up at your local hotel seminar would spend more time asking questions and wasting his time on non-subject matter than just listening and comprehending what the great man is saying.  Do what you do Jim, I mean Kelly and I'll keep buying and training what I can from you.
