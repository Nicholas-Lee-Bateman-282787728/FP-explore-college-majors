8525945,5,B00872GYFS,"I just finished watching this DVD (which I borrowed from a friend) and simply loved it!!!  I feel a warm, nostalgic feeling as if I've just been to Ireland -- actually I feel like I'm still there!

Years ago my mother and I visited Ireland for a lovely ten day romp through several country B&Bs along the Irish Western Coast. Watching this video reminded me so much of that beautiful trip, and how I long to go back with my husband and daughters to experience the almost mystical beauty of Ireland!

And the food...wow!! I truly was shocked at the amount of new information I absorbed about cooking from this program.  I plan to try each of these mouth watering recipes in my kitchen.  I printed all the recipes from the convenient pdf file included on the DVD.

Chef Darina Allen and Stephen Walsh were also a joy to watch.  I thoroughly enjoyed the tidbits of Irish folklore and chuckled away at the Irish sayings peppered throughout.  Terrific program!",1352764800,2,955,4.609467455621302
