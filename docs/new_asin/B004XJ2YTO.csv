8446972,5,B004XJ2YTO,"Everything that auteur David ""Rock"" Nelson lacks in talent, skill and technical expertise, he more than compensates with sheer enthusiasm.  Nelson KNOWS his movies suck (in fact, Nelson's work makes Ed Wood look like a cinematic genius), yet he presses on, undaunted.  This is a guy who can talk nonstop for an hour, his every utterance punctuated with exclamation marks, addressing subjects that range widely from Christ's salvation to Marine Corps service to sex with a tranny...and monster movies, of course.  Nelson describes his works as ""monster movies"" rather than ""horror films"" because his purpose isn't to frighten people but merely to entertain; indeed, there's nothing scary about his movies except the lack of production value.  Nelson's movies are simply so bad that you can't help but laugh, but a few seem genuinely inspired and outright hilarious.  Highly recommended.",1518825600,,885,5.338129496402877
8446973,5,B004XJ2YTO,"This doc is an in-depth look at a national treasure:  The American Weirdo.  It's about a guy who, with far less resources than the beloved Ed Wood, barreled ahead and made the kind of movies he wanted to make.  A lover of monsters, horror and the weird, David ""The Rock"" Nelson fever dreams in a nonsensical collage of rubber monster masks, neighborhood sets and non-actors running from laughable boogymen.
We get an insight into The Rock's life through the man's own words, which only proves that every film he makes is a direct reflection of who he is:
A strange man who makes strange movies.",1515801600,2,594,4.6380952380952385
