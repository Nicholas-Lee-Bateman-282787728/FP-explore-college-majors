2355265,5,B000A36KBA,The video was a gift for my wife.  She is a massage therapist and she found the video very useful and informative.  The only additional comment she had was that she may have to get some of the introductory Qigong videos to help with understanding the basics.  There were some questions she had after watching the video which may be covered in some of the beginners DVDs.  Overall she says it is a great product.,1256688000,3,411,4.44
2355266,5,B000A36KBA,"Actually this used DVD was in great condition.  Master Jwing-Ming Yang demonstrates Qigong Massage very well.  The table of contents accompanying each section was clear, concise, and followed.  Lighting, background, camera angles, and audio were superb and professionally done.  I recommend this dvd to anyone interested in the aspects of healing massage, not just simply relaxation.  Those with advanced massage knowledge will be introduced to an interesting and exciting realm of Chinese healing arts.  This information will augument Swedish, Thai, and Shiatsu modes. This one DVD is very comprehensive regarding the techniques and applications of Qigong massage -- a souped up version of Chinese Tuina massage -- the introduction of energy work and how it relates to acupuncture/accupressure points, meridians, and their linkage to the organs, glands, energy centers, and whole body!",1228262400,4,886,5.674242424242424
2355267,4,B000A36KBA,"I WATCHED SEVERAL TIMES,STILL FIGURE IT OUT WHAT THIS IS I'M WATCHING. TO MY CONFUSION IS THAT QIGOING MASSAGE IS COMBINATION OF QI PLUS TUI-NA,BUT IT SEEMS NONE OF THAT DEMONSTRATED CLEARLY.",1181347200,,191,5.0
2355268,5,B000A36KBA,"The amount of information on this DVD is incredible.  This is a very complete and thorough introduction to Qigong Massage.  I'm sure many people will watch this DVD and beg to differ with my calling it an introduction, as the amount of information on the DVD can occupy a viewer for years.

Prior to any information on massage, the viewer is treated to a lengthy explanation of Qigong, breathing and the various methods that can enable the viewer to carry out the numerous techniques on this video.  the introduction is very well thought out and is helpful to beginners and experienced practicioners.

Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming explains how to use your breath to switch between yin and yang and how to balance the yin and yang in your body.  Massage techniques that can bring the Qi to the extremities or send the Qi to the bones are shown and the differences explained.  The video uses extensive and professionally produced animation to demonstrate various points and techniques.  As always, the production quality of the video is up to the high standards that Dr. Yang has set over the years.

Dr. Yang presents Qigong Massage techniques for two people as well as a section on self massage.  Both sections are explained and demonstrated by Dr. Yang and an assistant.  This is not one of those simple instructional videos where you watch it once and you've got it.  This DVD can easily challenge a serious student and offers enough information to the viewer that they will be in no rush for Qigong Massage Part 2 (if there is one), as they can spend years practicing and becoming natural in their use of the techniques taught on the video.

This instructional video is for everyone, not just massage students.  Anyone practicing martial arts, sports  or just sitting around watching the boob tube can benefit from the information offered on this DVD.",1163721600,21,1846,4.779179810725552
2355269,4,B000A36KBA,"I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 only because I don't believe in five star reviews.

This DVD is really good. Yes, it could be better structured or sometimes more detailed (I guess you will find the details in the QiGong Massage book), but believe me, you will still benefit a lot, even if you will learn at least one single technique of hundreds demonstrated in the video.

More than one year ago I started using a simpler method that I learned from Dr. Yang's Taiji book. It worked very well: I'm more relaxed, sleep better, have more energy than ever even with 5-6 hours of sleep. That's why I decided to do the massage every day.

Then I added a few new moves from this new DVD and it works even better !",1139097600,19,707,4.2611940298507465
2355270,5,B000A36KBA,"Great DVD which explains the Chinese view of the body as both a physical body, and a Qi energetic body. It goes on to explain what Qi energy is, how it functions in the body, and how we can influence it with Qigong and Massage.  Its very clear and straight-forward, and uses current American science to explain these ancient Chinese concepts. The quality is excellent. I can't say enough good things about this DVD, even if your not interested in massage, this has something fascinating to learn...",1127865600,16,498,4.724137931034483
2355271,5,B000A36KBA,"I have waited for this DVD for years, and it is so much better than I ever expected! I own both of the VHS that are included on this DVD: Qigong Self-Massage and Qigong Partner Massage. But, this DVD starts with an additional half-hour video which explains Qigong from the beginning, with detailed animations showing Qi circulating in the body, and explaining the entire Qi circulatory system (vessels, meridians, and acupoints).

Then the video moves into a complete demonstration of Self-Massage techniques for the entire body, shown by a youthful Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming.

Next, we see Master Yang instructing Partner Massage on a student, with great detail, including excellent tips for novice massage therapists.

After this 3-hour video is over, you can then sit and watch a very pleasant 'Glossary' of Chinese/English Qigong Massage terminology, which moves at a very comfortable pace for reading, and has beautiful Chinese classical music.

You cannot come away from this program without learning more than you thought possible in a single sitting. (in fact, it took me two days to see all of the contents of this DVD.)

Following THAT, there's still about 30 minutes of Video previews of all the other YMAA instructional videos!

There is also an 'interactive YMAA catalog' which shows all of the books/VHS/DVDs available, with contact info for YMAA Publications.

The content is really unparalleled - this is an excellent learning tool. I hope Master Yang continues to share his knowledge on the subject of massage.

The DVD production is excellent quality, with detailed navigation to every single part of the program in just 2 or 3 clicks.

Highly recommended!",1124323200,39,1669,5.129151291512915
8073726,5,B000A36KBA,"It's a very good book. I have a DVD on QiGong massage of the same author. Using them together, the book and DVD. The book is illustrated very well. Could be used without DVD as well.",1522022400,,182,4.083333333333333

8073731,5,B000A36KBA,"This DVD has 4 chapters covering the fundamentals of Qigong massage. Every chapter and section is very well explained and easy to understand.

Chapter 1 explains Qigong, Qi, Dao, Yi, breathing and hormones.
Chapter 2 explains the Upper, Middle and Lower Dan Tian and electromotive force.
Chapter 3 explains cell replacement and the 8 Vessels.
Chapter 4 explains Qi Circulatory System and the 12 primary chi channels.

After viewing and learning from the first four chapters the video moves on to Qigong Massage General Self- Massage. This explains 1) Purposes of self-massage. 2) Basic massage techniques, 3) Self-massage of the body, and 4) Self-massage of the internal organs.

The last part of the video is Qigong Massage General Partner Massage. This explains 1) Purposes of general massage, 2) Important points of Qigong massage, 3) Basic Massage techniques and 4) Massage with a partner procedures.

I practiced some of these techniques while viewing this video and was amazed at how well I felt afterwards. I will definitely continue practicing qigong massage for years to come.

8073732,5,B000A36KBA,I use parts of the video when I'm teaching my Far East massage classes.  Done extremely well.  I had owned the book for many years. The explanations along with the demo is so helpful....it makes my teaching much easier.,1364860800,4,219,4.589743589743589
8073733,5,B000A36KBA,"This is one of the clearest DVDS or books that I have seen on the subject of practical Qigong practice.
The DVD presents Qigong massage as a path to improved body health and longevity.

This video says that it is designed to be used with the book ""Qigong Massage"" which will provide more detail on the theoretical Qigong foundations. But, I looked at sample pages for the book and I think that the DVD is much better and more understandable than the book. You just can't describe massage technique with words and static pictures as well as you can with a video.

The content of the DVD is organized as follows:
  Qi & Qigong - about 30 minutes
  Self Massage - slightly more than 60 minutes
  Partner Massage - approximately 2 hours.
  Glossary

The first segment, ""Qi & Qigong"" sets the theoretical foundations for the massage practices and lays out the ideas that explain why and how it works. Qi is discussed both from a western medicine perspective based on the idea that Qi maps to bioelectricity in the body as transmitted by blood flow and also explained from a traditional Chinese medicine point of view. The goal of Qigong massage is to help the flow of Qi, resolve stagnant Qi, improve body and organ health and speed up the recovery from injuries. I am not entirely convinced that bioelectricity maps directly to Qi, but this explanation is very helpful in conveying the ideas.

The next segment, ""Self Massage"" demonstrates basic massage techniques and outline a ""self massage"" process. This part goes over goals, principles and techniques. The idea is to learn first on yourself. There are some fundamental principles to follow: Start from top and go to the bottom & also massage from the center to the sides in order to lead the Qi from the top of your head to the feet and finally to the ground.

""Self Massage"" begins with a list of massage techniques and then outlines in detail, whole body massage with a series of techniques to improve Qi movement and health. You start at the head and then go to the stomach, abdomen, lower back, legs, feet arms and hands. This is followed by a self massage of the internal organs while standing and while sitting. Once again, the goal is to improve relaxation, health and longevity.

Finally, there  is a 2 hour video on ""Partner M assage"". There is a lot of repetition here of the techniques and principles that are explained in the ""Self Massage"" segment. In addition, there is a lot of supplementary material describing how to work with another person while analyzing their health requirements and meeting their expectation.

This DVD is very highly recommended. Get it to learn more about Qi and Qigong and get it to learn how to improve your personal health and the health of other people.",1305158400,5,2749,4.683991683991684
8073734,5,B000A36KBA,"This DVD does exactly what it was designed to do--demonstrate the movements of Qigong Massage as shown in Dr. Yang's book with the same title. Does it show ALL the techniques and movements shown in the book?  No.  It would take a whole set of DVD's to do that, but it DOES cover all the major ones, and does it very well.  If you want to go deeper I heartily suggest that you buy the book in addition to the DVD.  It will give you more detail on the techniques and movements as well as the theory behind them.

MY RECOMMENDATION:  For a lifetime of health-giving benefits to yourself and your loved ones, buy this DVD and its companion book!",1287446400,6,641,4.3
8073735,5,B000A36KBA,"Once again Dr. Yang and YMAA have produced an outstanding DVD publication.  Similar to other YMAA videos, Qigong Massage: Fundamental Techniques For Health and Relaxation is a very comprehensive companion to the textbook of the same name.  At 220 minutes of length, the viewer is in for a marathon of qigong discussion and massage instruction.  However to help the viewer digest the volume of material, this DVD features easy to navigate DVD menus, Chinese translation, and English text accompanying the narration. A comprehensive glossary at the end is a nice addition; but probably of little value outside of the textbook.

The first section includes a general overview of Chinese Medicine including details about qi (chi) flow pathways and vessels. The viewer may be intimidated by the names of the cavities, gates, vessels and acupressure points presented in the video. If the viewer is not familiar with qigong basics, I would recommend The Root of Chinese Qigong or similar introductory qiqong text by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming.

Section II covers self-massage techniques. Included are explanations of the multiple hand techniques used to manipulate qi flow through muscles, pathways, and cavities. Techniques are divided into major body groups corresponding to the head-to-toe progression of manipulation of qi through the major pathways and vessels.  Internal organ and fascia massage techniques are included towards the end of this section and are demonstrated by Dr. Yang.  The self-massage techniques presented can be done along with the video.  The thought crossed my mind that a follow-along video of the same production would be nice.

Section III covers partner massage.  As in the previous section, the techniques are divided into major body groups corresponding to the head-to-toe progression of manipulation of qi through the major pathways and vessels. Front and back side techniques are shown.  Again, the multiple hand techniques used in the massage are explained.  Even without the text or complete comprehension of the cavities, pathways, and points, the accompanying narration will allow the viewer to be comfortable enough performing the massages to immediately practice with his or her partner.

For owners of the companion text, this DVD is certainly a ""must own"" as you have the opportunity to witness some of the internal organ massage techniques performed by Dr. Yang that otherwise would not be comprehensible in print and photo sequences.  Novice, amateur or professional masseurs will also find value in this DVD;  qigong massage will complement any existing massage knowledge and practice.  Martial artists or athletes of any discipline will find value in this video to help heal and recover from exercise.  Finally, I would recommend supplementing the DVD with one of YMAA's tai chi and qigong music CDs, as the pair would make a terrific gift.",1284422400,8,2874,5.323008849557522
