8392141,3,B0039OC0W0,"Goth (Gen Takahashi, 2008)

Interesting, if overlong, mystery that might have worked better as two separate filmsa character study of its two would-be detectives (the goths of the title) would have fit the movie's pedestrian pace, while the mystery aspect could have been a separate, faster-paced film. That said, it is impossible to argue with the film's aesthetic decisions; this movie is beautifully shot from front to back, and full of the kind of eye candy that will leave you looking up the names of the cinematographer and camera crew in order to track down other movies they've made. Those aspects are not enough to carry the movie, but they're enough to give it a watch. ** ",1407283200,,683,4.829059829059829

8392144,4,B0039OC0W0,"A out cast girl (Rin Takanashi) who is sort of Goth in her dark cloths
wearing way, finds a new friend (Pretty Boy Kanata Hong) who knows how to
act and look like a normie. They have a interest in a local serial killer
who is an artist at posing his victims and displaying the bodies for some or
all to see. The young lady has a odd past that invokes death and darkness
and the new ""boy Friend"" is set on figuring it out as well as finding out
all they can about the local serial killer. I have read some mixed reviews
on this film and I must say I was very happy with the film as a whole. We
have good film making as well as some good acting in this mystery/ thriller.
Well worth your while and one of the better ""J"" Horrors I have seen lately.",1326672000,2,745,3.9403973509933774
8392145,3,B0039OC0W0,"Set in a Tokyo suburb, a serial killer has been murdering young women, severing their left hands and leaving their bodies posed artistically out in open public places. His actions catch the public's fascination, especially that of two high school students, one a popular, socially accepted boy named Kamiyama, the other a beautiful loner chick named Morino. Both teens harbor a disturbing penchant for death, murder and deceased bodies. After Morino finds what appears to be the killer's notebook, the teens try to trace the killer's footprints, not to turn him into the authorities, but to see the corpses before anyone else.  I won't spoil it for those who want to see it, and it was an interesting and engaging little flick, but it's promoted as ""One of Japan's must-see horror movies"", and there's no palpable horror anywhere. Even when the murderer's identified, there's no release of tension, and we never see any horror, only it's threat or aftermath. I was disappointed in that regard, seeing as some of the most graphically disturbing horror around comes out of Asia.  Was it a bad flick? No. But the lack of tension or a climactic conclusion will leave most viewers cold, as cold as a Goth chick at a glee club rehearsal...",1278979200,7,1233,4.866666666666666
