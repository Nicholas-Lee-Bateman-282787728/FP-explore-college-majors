Cannibal Man is a difficult movie with known Spanish actors and not boring at all and The Mountain of the Cannibal God has an original plot, a nice jungle photograph and lots of hard and savage action. A jewel not easy to imitate.

8163080,5,B0000AC8L9,"Wow.  This lovely Anchor Bay 2-on-1 special deal features two great movies.  Mountain AKA Slave of the Cannibal God features two cannibal girls applying body paint to a nude Ursula Andress, which alone makes this one worth the price of admission.  There's as much animal mutilation here as Cannibal Ferox, so that will make it offensive to some.  The best part was the unexpected (fake?) bestiality scene which made me fall off my chair with laughter.  The sweaty, coked-out looking Stacy Keach (AKA TV's Mike Hammer) adds to the fun.  Cheap, sleazy, and funny if you're sick like me.
Cannibal Man, on the other hand, was a well-done, thoughtful piece of film making.  A Spanish release from 1971, Cannibal Man offers an unusual amount of gore and sickness given its early release.  Definitely splatterific.  But you also get a great story with excellent pacing and intelligent script. The title character works in a slaughterhouse, so you do get some actual cattle kill/mutilation moments.  He's more of a serial killer really than a cannibal, but what the heck.  Gore fans should click like maniacs to acquire this great DVD.",1076284800,15,1127,4.941489361702128
