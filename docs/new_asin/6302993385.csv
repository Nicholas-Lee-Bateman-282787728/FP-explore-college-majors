A gal rides a cycle, is with a guy, a gal fights a guy, a fencing scene with ballon popping, play piano, some are with guys and kiss and some are well-endowed.  A girl has a photo shoot and Jenny McCarthy is the photographer, they disrobe. A final gal is a scuba diver, in a swim suit briefly and swims.",1397260800,,397,4.1558441558441555

Little bit more all natural/athletic types than usual for Playboy I'd say coarse that depends a little on the time period.

Tamara - Ok
Natasha - Could've made a decent Playmate.
Angela - I liked her.
Sunare - Ok
Michelle - Hot girl, boring clip.  Her talking in clothes was better.
Jenna - Boring.
Catrina - Face isn't quite Playmate material but rest is.  Hot girl.
Nikki - Ok girl, sorta fun, sorta dizzying clip.
Ty - Ok girl with nice natural breasts.  Jenny McCarthy also in her clip.
Erin - Very cute despite short hairstyle I normally don't like.  Think Halle Berry Catwoman?
Amy - Nice body.",1277683200,,708,4.52755905511811
7833559,3,6302993385,"Playboy / College Girls is fifty seven minutes long was released on video on September 24, 1997. The college girls are cute in this video but the presentation leaves a lot to be desired. The nudity at times is somewhat conservative. Angela, Sunare, Michelle, and Erin talk more then show them nude. The highlight of the video is when Jenny McCarthy makes an appearance with Ty. Here is the list of ladies in order of appearance on the video.

Tamara Unverzagt\Southern Illinois University-Girl\guy sex, some skin and full nudity towards the end of the segment
Natasha Alberico\California State University-Natasha shows full nudity and then switches to her cheerleader outfit and then is shown fully nude shot in black and white.
Angela Cooper\North Carolina State-Not a lot of nudity
Sunare Cornell\Occidental College-Very little nudity
Michelle Diamond\Rutgers University-Full nudity on a piano
Jenna Nueva\School Unknown-Boring
Catrina Falbo\San Diego State University-From topless to being completely nude on the beach
Nikki Lee\Georgia State University-From topless dancing to dancing in the nude
Ty Erickson\Oklahoma State University-Full nudity, Jenny McCarthy (Playboy Playmate of the Month for October 1993 & Playboy Playmate of the Year for 1994) makes an appearance and strips down to the nude
Erin Robinson\Arizona State University-Fully nude for a very short time
Amy Summers\University of Oregon-Topless a few times underwater, fully nude outdoors and in the swimming pool later on

I did not get into this video and also the only difference between the VHS version and the DVD version is the VHS version comes with a preview of Video Centerfold: 40th Anniversary Playmate Anna-Marie Goddard. Playboy / College Girls get a C-.",1255132800,,1739,5.437037037037037

7833561,4,6302993385,"This DVD contains 11 segments (not counting the opening and closing parts) that involve 11 named women (some of the segments involve more than one woman, and some include men).  In-between the segments are pictures from college and pictures from ""current"" and past Playboy college photo shoots.  The segments are not Playboy photo shoots but instead they are fantasy sequences (or just scenes).  The segments start with an interview with the woman and then the nude sequence. Then another piece of interview then a montage of various photos (not specifically of any particular girl).  Then the next segment starts.

The first segment (other than the introduction montage segment) involves a blonde woman from Southern Illinois University (nursing student).  The scene involves the Southern Illinois student riding up on a motorcycle to a service station and seeing a man without a shirt.  While at the station the woman fantasizes about the man.  Annoyingly, while the fantasy sequence occurs, a voice over from the interview (unrelated to the action - for example the girl mentions the importance of a kiss while the scene shows her stripping) somewhat distracts from the action.  There are some nice scenes of the girl stripping and posing nude on the motorcycle (again with some voice over distracting the action).

The second segment involves a hot latino woman from California State University (exercise major).  The scene involves the woman toweling after a shower, putting on some lotion, and then putting on some cheerleading clothes (something of a reverse strip tease).  After putting on the cheerleading clothes, the girl bounces around, and then suddenly it's an artsy black & white scene of the nude girl being held by a very muscular man and posing with the man.  Once again, the voice over narration, having nothing to do with the action, is quite distracting and annoying.

The third segment involves another blonde, this one a student at NC State (and another nursing student).  Her scene involves the girl swinging on a swing and talking about how big she is, an amazon.  And then a scene where the girl is attacked by a man and she beats him with some ninja moves and then strips over his prone body.

The fourth segment involves a hot dark haired girl from Occidental College (diplomacy major).  Her scene involves her fencing and then posing in various states of undress (sweaters and lingerie and nude).

The fifth segment involves a hot red-head from Rutgers (sports bar waitress).  Her scene starts with her on roller-blades and then she plays the piano (and while the piano plays, she rolls around on top of the piano).  I'm not a music scholar, but she seems to play classical music quite well.

The sixth segment involves another latino girl, this one from a Northern Virginia school (George Mason? Northern Virginia Community College? she doesn't specify; criminology major).  Her segment involves the girl staking out a house where she spots a man and woman fooling around.  She becomes aroused by the activity and fondles herself (bad stake out person).

The seventh segment involves another blonde, this one attending San Diego University (marketing major). This time, some still pictures from the photo shoot are shown.  The action (non-still photos) occurs on a bicycle, on the beach (sunbathing top-less) and in the water (""I'm a typical California girl"").

The eighth segment features an Asian woman from Georgia State University (International Business student).  She is hot, but the strange effects (the jerky camera, weird changing background) that occur as she is dancing and stripping on stage are quite annoying and disappointing (she is an attractive woman, but it is hard to watch the segment without becoming a little ill).

The ninth segment involves a very hot reddish/blonde haired girl from Oklahoma State University.  Her segment involves her posing nude for a blonde female photographer, then photographing the photographer and then playing with the other blonde woman (or at least on the ground next to her).  A rather good segment.

The tenth segment involves a short-haired red-head from Arizona State University.  Her scene involves her posing in a black dress and then nude.

The eleventh segment involves a woman from University of Oregon (undeclared major).  She is very into water and her segment involves her swimming around.

Then a closing montage.  Not a bad DVD, some hot women and some interesting scenes, though the narration over the scenes was distracting and annoying (note, don't watch parts of this DVD during commercial breaks, you'll end up drawn into the DVD and missing the tv program).",1113264000,8,4660,5.092226613965744
