The brilliance of the writing, acting and directing was comparable to gone with the wind! The visual aspects of what my eyes enjoyed is up there with the birth of ones first child. Shaq put forth acting that is on par with marlon Brando in a street car named desire or Robert deniro in raging bull.

I honestly think that they did this on purpose to be funny.

He tries to escape by slipping into the open door of an old warehouse, but they follow him there, too. While running from them through aisles filled with all kinds of stuff, he bumps into an old boom box. By doing that, he manages to release Kazaam, a genie who has been held captive for thousands of years. In order to stay free, Kazaam must give Max three wishes. There are several moments throughout the movie where the development of the characters and storyline drag, but the rest of the movie certainly make up for it.

Shaquille O'Neal is of course a world famous basketball player and entertainer who has done it all from act, to rap to of course playing ball. I have always found him to be entertaining and believe that he is genuinely a nice guy. Well the year was 1996 I believe when Shaq let loose his rapping genie in movie theaters across the country. To be honest it is an interesting idea because of his size and celeberty appeal. But also as long as we are honest he is not the best actor ever. Still for kids this actually a good movie because when I was younger I remember loving this movie, for the adults maybe not so much.

Max is just your average kid wanting to be cool, not picked on at school, and the victim of a normal situation. That of course would be never really knowing his dad and mama has a new boyfriend. So he is having and over all bad time at this point in his life, that is until he literally falls into some good luck. When running from the school bullies one day he falls various floors and lands right on top of the magic boom box. In doing so he releases the genie named Kazaam. From there things get interesting as Kazaam tries to convince Max he is the real deal and will grant three wishes. Once he realizes what he has the time is now for Max to change his luck, if all works out.

This is a very fun one for the kiddies as Shaq really is an entertaining guy and the fun of the wishes will make it a hit with any kid. As for the adults it can still be fun if you turn off the brain but this is far from a perfect film. Let us start with the acting because our lead needed some work. Shaq is very outgoing and fun in the role and actually for his acting abilities this may be his best job, he hams it up. Still he will never win any awards for acting but at least in a non serious role he can have fun with it. Francis Capra did a good enough job as Max especially for a child actor, he has a new look now and has done some good stuff. Everyone else in the film did a good job from his parents to mama's boyfriend.

As for the writing it really needs some work from the older stand point, of course this is for kids and on that level it works. Director Paul Glaser along with fellow writers Roger Soffer and Christian Ford [who still write together] needed to pick it up a bit for the parents but for the kiddies it works. I find it hard to really dig into this because I know it is for kids, plus I liked it a lot when I was younger. Still this may not be the best choice for the serious movie fan, really it is not. This may not be the best movie ever but for those who like to turn it off it is fun, I liked it then I like it now.",1261353600,4,2662,3.9515828677839853
895386,1,6304501676,"So let's see. Shaquille O'Neal stars as a rapping genie . . . and it already goes downhill from here. The first major flaw of Kazaam is Shaq. Look, he's a very good basketball player (I liked him when he was still with the Los Angeles Lakers), but he is definitely not a very good actor. His performance is really bland and his emotions don't look like emotions at all, except when he gives that creepy smile. And then, there's his rapping. I've only heard Shaq rap a couple of times in my lifetime, and it had to include this. There are scenes in which the title character is giving a live concert in a club. There is also one scene in which he does a random rap number in the middle of the film with Max (the kid protagonist). If you think it sounds really bad, wait until you hear the lyrics. The lyrics . . . MY GOD! These aren't real rap lyrics! They sound like kid stuff! But hey, it's supposed to be a family film, and the lyrics are supposed to be family-friendly . . . I'm going to go listen to Jay-Z and Swizz Beatz right after I publish this review.

But these aren't the only flaws in the film. No, you also have the kid protagonist Max. I swear, this kid has got to be one of the most annoying characters in family-film history! It's really hard to care for him. Same goes for the villain. He's so two-dimensional even for a family film that he makes other family-friendly villains look like Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men. Then, there's the special effects, which are some of the most horrible ever seen. In one particular scene when he is on his flying bicycle, you can tell that Shaq is right behind a green screen. I guess they were trying to save some of the money that were put into this lame movie.

So yeah, the critics and half of the Amazon reviewers are correct. This is one of the worst movies ever made. I would say that this is just as bad as Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and Batman & Robin. Don't even think of pressing the Add To Shopping Cart button.

895387,5,6304501676,Shaq gives an inspiring performance and this classic comedy will make you laugh. Definetely a movie you want in your collection,1241827200,,127,5.095238095238095

895389,5,6304501676,"Shaq Diesel (aka Shaquille O'Neal) has done what few professional athletes have ever accomplished - successfully crossed over to the big screen.  I like the cover of this movie.  Still have yet to see the whole thing, but not because I didn't want to watch it - I keep getting interrupted, and I'm starting to get a little frustrated.

Based on Shaq's other endeavors (rap albums, sense of style, etc.) I can GUARANTEE this movie is high caliber.  I feel like Shaq really likes kids, which is fun.  I'm sure the movie is fun too!",1134604800,2,529,4.526315789473684
895390,2,6304501676,"SHAQ is one of my favourite basketball players. His dominance in the paint is spectacular. That's probably the only good thing I'm gonna say about SHAQ'S performance. When I first saw this movie at a video store, Shaq was on the front cover with a big ass smile and he's coming out a boom box, I was like `damn this could be kinda good' so I got myself a copy, went home, put it on and started watching it. After I saw it, I was like `what the hell was this all about?' I mean, I'd rather watch the Barkley and Shaq fight again or the Lakers being swept in the playoffs by Spurs in 1999. I believe the plot of Kazaam is focusing on this little punk kid called Max and his family problems rather than seeing Shaq truly perform. It was such a shame to see a great idea thrown to waste, I mean, the producers or director or the script writer could have improved a lot. Having Shaq to be a genie is a damn cool idea, I mean, think about it, the sky is the limit.

The only cool bits I liked were when Shaq came out of the boom box and he's singing that rhyme and you see all these punk kids get scared of a badass 7 foot genie. The other thing I liked was when he slammed the fat man in the hoop (Funny he never took a free throw). All the rest was stupid.

Regarding to Shaq's acting. I can't really argue on that. Reason being, Shaq is not an actor in the first place, doesn't mean he can't get away with performance. The way I see it, Shaq is acting like he is performing to an audience on TV, similar to comedy shows i.e. Eddie Murphy. I know some people think it's ugly. But I'm not going to criticise Shaq, on his acting career, everybody knows he's not an actor, and to criticise him negatively as an actor is insulting to actors because people forget about what acting really is. Some people don't take acting seriously, they think it's easy or anybody can do it, trust me, it's not, you have to study for this like any other major, such as biology, dentistry, engineering etc... you can't just act, unless your gifted, the point is, Shaq aint even an actor, so anybody that has negative comments can drop it. You wanna criticise a real actor? You can talk about other people in the movie business.

In conclusion, I believe Kazaam is for 3 year olds. Certainly not for kids over 5, and defiantly not for teenagers and you damn right it's not for anybody over 20.",1113609600,,2367,4.197802197802198
895391,1,6304501676,"Jesus forgave us. Jesus forgave us all. He was unmercifully staked to a crucifix and left to slowly die, only to rise again and have to bare witness to the up chuck of a film entitled Kazaam. He gave us all a second chance and unfortunately director, Paul Michael Glaser used his second chance to create this blasphemous work of the devil. Well let me tell you, Jesus is mad at us once again and I don't think he will ever forgive us this time.

Kazaam depicts NBA star Shaquille O'Neal rapping??? and acting??? in scantily clad genie attire. Shaqs acting??? makes a drain-o enema actually seem like a pleasurable experience. It even makes his free throw ability shine in comparison. I'm still dumbfounded how someone that made such timeless greats as ""Shaq diesel"" and my all time favorite game ""Shaq-Fu"" could bomb so bad on a movie with a script as awing as this one.

You can pick up a previewed VHS copy here on Amazon.com for $0.85. I find it funny that a blank VHS tape will run you $1.00. I saved myself some money by buying a few copies of Kazaam instead of blank tapes and used them to record ""Small Wonder"" reruns. This is the only reason one should purchase Kazaam. If anyone is thinking of buying a copy and actually viewing it, don't! You would be better off using that $0.85 to buy a hand full of rusty nails and chewing them for the approximate running time of 1hr 45mins. Thrust me your time and money will be much better spent this way.

I gave this film??? 1 out of 5 stars only because Amazon.com doesn't allow you to give 0 stars. I wish I could rate this 0 stars. In fact I wish I could take away stars from some of the other reviewers. Hey, maybe Mr. Kazaam can help me out here.

Mr. Kazaam grant me these three wishes:

1. Give this movie 0 stars

2. Don't allow Shaq to ever act/rap again

3. Erase this movie from my memory banks for it has scard me for life.",1104537600,16,1886,4.295774647887324
895431,5,6304501676,"Shaq is truly God's gift to the world. He can sing, he can act, he can toss free throws. Let's face it, the man can do it all.

Kazaam is a movie unlike any other. Now some would say that Shaq's acting is so wooden he could play Pinnochio, but I argue with that. Shaq was playing a genie, a magical, rapping, abracadabra, hocus-pocus genie. The hippest, illest, defest, genie you ever laid eyes on. It is not for us to rate this film, it is for us to thank Shaq for taking the time to make this movie.

Now some would say that he can't even act his way through a 30 second commercial for Nestle Crunch or Burger King. I argue the point again. Shaq has the intelligence and mastery of the English language that we mortals can only hope to achieve. He is the reigning king of entertainment.

Others will also say that the man is slightly retarded and that if not for his great height, he would be lucky to ride the back of a garbage truck in Chicago as a sanitation engineer. I say those people have a real attitude problem.

Shaq can do it all. I am looking forward to his opera album, his cooking show, his line of BVD briefs, and last but certainly not least, I am looking forward to Shaq teaming up with Ice-T. Shaq will take over lead guitar duties for the reformed Body Count. Of course I hope his Broadway run doesn't interfere with the world tour.

Rock on Shaq, it's your world. We only breathe your air.",1103068800,45,1411,4.230483271375465

895433,5,6304501676,"For years the pundits said he would never make it.  ""go home"" they said, ""your finished in this buisness.""
But being the fighter he was, Shaq carried on.
When he announced to the world he would begin a career in acting, the world thought he could never make it.  But make it he did.  His debut movie, Kazaam, proved once and for all that Basketball players can act.
His star performance in Kazaam was topped only by his rap career.
Silencing his critics, Shaquille went on to perform in many great commercials, such as Burger King and Radio Shack.

If he's a method actor, he has successfully demonstrated a new method that no one has ever seen before.  I also went to NYU film school and this movie was used in class as an inspirational tool.  Forget about the whole genie aspect.  I mean, a seven-foot black dude comes out of a bottle and grants wishes!  This movie deserves 30,000 stars.

Shaquille O'Neal is a very talented actor and rapper, plus i heard he plays a little basketball. I wonder if he's any good.  There are many hilarious scenes in this instant classic. My favorite part is when shaq makes it rain candy. I LOVE IT!!!

895436,1,6304501676,"Shaq is easily the most dominating player in the NBA right now. He does things other people can't do. He should stay to playing ball and leave the movies to someone else.
Kazaam is simple enough story. Shaq is a stupid genie who ends up becoming some kids servant. He ends up becoming friends with the kid and they have to avoid getting in trouble and a bunch of other stupid stuff.
The movie wasn't all that funny. The funniest scenes are watching Shaq. He is so huge. His pure size becomes funny. Watching him act is the second funniest part of the film. He is so horrible. He can't use emotion at all and he can't flat out act.
Kazaam was best described in Scary Movie. In the beginning of the movie Carmen Electras character is asked whats her favorite scary movie. She answers with Kazaam. The guy says back that Kazaam isn't a scary movie. Carmen says, you haven't seen Shaq act. This movie really is that bad. I wouldn't waste my money buying or renting it.

It is now becoming notorious as one one of the worst movies ever made, and it deserves that status. Usually genie movies suck, and this one was no exception. Anything with a basketball player who tries to start an acting career as a genie in a boom bow has to be bad; and it is. It's even got the most corny sentimentality you'll ever see in a movie, and it's message about second chances in life it absolutely awful. This is even insulting to kids. I mean please people if you have any humanity left in you, you would not punish your children by making them watch this horrendous thing. It's garbage, and if easily one of the worst movies ever.

Shaq should have won an emmy and an oscar.  It also portrays middle eastern characters in a positive light.  Who knew that they weren't all terrorists?  That kid represents a modren hero of our time who triumphs over poverty and hate.  It is a pity that Shaq is no longer acting.  ShaqFu 4 ever!

Francis Capra is a brilliant genius and the way Shaq plays so many different characters left me completely in awe. I have no idea why this film was passed over for an Oscar.
When I was doing a character study for a part as a rapping genie in a Broadway production of Mrs. Saigon, I watched this film repeatedly. Eventually the film became a huge part of my life and watching the film helped me overcome a painul divorce and an addiction to painkillers. This movie is fun for both kids and adults and if I were not serving 15-20 in prison right now, you can bet that I would be sitting in my living room with a bag of pretzels and a diet root beer having the time of my life.",1071619200,7,810,4.198717948717949

Amazon sells the above listed movie titles on DVD too by the way check em out I sure did.  Does every movie have to have a deep abiding soul changing message.  Does every movie you see have to obtain the highest possible production values every moment or its DRECK <GARBAGE>!  Sometimes all I require of my movie is that it be fun with a cute ending message and KAZAAM delivers royally.
Come on people lighten up.  This movie was just meant to be fun nothing else.  Kazaam has a cute little message of a child's hope sustained in the midst of adversity by a special friend a meassge delivered rather well.  Kazaam's bad singing hehehe its just fun remember it's one of those hey Genie dude don't quit your day job things.  I am an adult and I loved this movie.  Shaq did a great job in it.  Shaq gave the Genie a wild special urban flavor, compassion and dignity that is way different from all traditional Genie depictions that I found refreshing.  Shaq was a hood Genie, everyone in the Hood thinks they are the next Ghetto I M A COOOL Dude rap super star.  A hood Genie living in a boom box would not logically be any different from all the rest of the rap star want-ta-bee's hence the movie keeps to its urban theme.
Kazzam is for kids or the adult who has managed to remain a kid at heart anyone else has done more than JUST grow up they have gotten old in the worse context.  There is no more fun inside you if there are no connections to the joys and pains of youth this movie taps into.  If your heart is still young you will love Kazaam if not I pity you.
P.S. Amazon sells lots of high tone movies too by the way!  I've brought a few in my time.  Go for it.",1071014400,10,1850,4.169014084507042

The story is very well-written - it's about a genie, a very large genie.  This movie would have been good even without Shaq.  However, with him as the star, Kazaam is a fantastic movie.
This is the movie that made Shaquille O'Neal a huge movie star.  The script is very well-written, and accentuates Shaq's acting abilities.  Every time Shaq speaks, you'll realize just how intelligent he is - it's kind of like listening to Einstein lecture.
Also, I think it is hilarious (you will too!) that he's so much bigger than the kid who rubbed the lamp!  Everytime they are both standing, I almost lose it - it's gut-bustingly funny!

If there's anything to take a stab at Shaq in *any* way, he just shows a clip or 2 from this movie on his show. So, I went out and rented this movie (with about 10 others to disguise it) to make fun of it, and I had a laugh-a-minute riot! How many times did you just want Kazaam to die a horrible death when he started rapping? And the writing was atrocious -- do **NOT** show this movie to little kids! You will put them at risk for brain damage with lines like: ""Francais? I love it 'beaucoup, beaucoup, beaucoup'!"" and ""You smell like a hippopotamus butt."" Many others follow, as well. And the ending was horribly melodramatic -- I will not spoil it so you can see it for yourself. Overall, I would like to thank Conan O'Brien for discovering this horrible movie that every family can enjoy...making fun of.
P.S. I think Touchstone Pictures is so embarrassed for putting out a piece of trash like this, I don't even think that Conan needed to have these clips furnished by the studio for his show. 0.5/10",995846400,3,1172,4.260089686098655
