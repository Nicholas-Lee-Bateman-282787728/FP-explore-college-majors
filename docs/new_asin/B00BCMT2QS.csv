5578373,3,B00BCMT2QS,"a million stars for the beautiful girls
and the beautiful ones i love so much

you can't compare this at all
with the beautiful ones
from season 1 and 2
it's a totally different world

it will take me eternity
to show you how much i love you
all of you...

and i gave it a three?

the package is really flimsy
only a third the size of the season one box
with all three disks crammed together
sealed in a way that made it hard to open
with no mention as to whether
the video journals were included or not

they are not...
but they are on the individual dvds
that include five episodes each:
ride easy, back in the saddle, etc...
i'll be buying those...

haven't opened it yet
when i saw it i was sad
cause i want the best for them
and all of them
who love you...",1422230400,,761,3.973684210526316

5578375,2,B00BCMT2QS,"I don't own this DVD series, but I did watch them when they were on TV. I like the horses. But most of this series is more like a new Saddle Club. I know its a new generation playing them, but there are so many things that don't add up about it if it's supposed to be season 3.

Things about Prancer's old leg injury, Veronica was poor at the end of season 2, Phil and Stevie were boyfriend/girlfriend in season 2, Red was a young man, not a middle aged uncle, the property is different. Just so many things in this series that don't match up AT ALL! And Belle, the black horse had a star. I may be missing some things, but there were just so many things that should at least still be as similar to the original series as possible. And Max was married to a reporter woman named Deborah. I never once saw her in this new series. Many of the things mentioned here are not at all similar to the original series.

This is a new Saddle Club. When the first cast ended their show series, in my opinion, that was the end of the original Saddle Club. This should be called Saddle Club: New Generation. Or Saddle Club: Season 1 of a new series.",1405987200,2,1135,4.131221719457014

5578378,5,B00BCMT2QS,Simply the best! My daughter cannot get enough of this series. It is perfect for tween girls who love horses and teenage drama.,1392249600,,127,4.565217391304348
5578379,5,B00BCMT2QS,"Truly shows that a quality family series can still be made even in this day of age!!! :-) It's important mentioning this series continued on EVEN AFTER THE DEATH OF ONE OF IT'S ORIGINAL LITTLE ACTRESSES from Seasons 1&2 (who, unfortunately, got hit by a train and died in real life. :(  )",1391385600,,288,4.433962264150943
5578380,5,B00BCMT2QS,"While this Season 3 of the Saddle Club did not disappoint, it was different from the original first two seasons of the show. The actors are all different, and the farm/location where the show is filmed is different. However, it is if this new series is either trying to copy the original series, or it simply picked up where the last one left off, though it is hard to tell which one. The episodes don't really follow events from the book series, but they are still fun to watch and all very horse related. I would recommend this show for anyone who was a fan of the Saddle Club book series, the first tv series, or anyone who loves horses!",1390521600,,640,4.341666666666667
5578381,3,B00BCMT2QS,My daughter did not enjoy this season as much as seasons 1 & 2. Just one of those things you wouldn't know until you watched it. She likes the Saddle Club overall but was somewhat disappointed in this one.,1388275200,,205,4.282051282051282
