8318875,5,B001LNOMQ8,Death And Diamonds was released in 1967. It starred George Nader as FBI agent Jerry Cotton in this fine B-Film. This time Jerry infiltrates a gang who gets involved in a Diamond heist. In color again this is entertaining for Jerry Cotton fans. Fans of George Nader will like this the most.,1469923200,,289,4.576923076923077
8318876,3,B001LNOMQ8,"OK West German-made English-dubbed spy-type adventure.  Nader plays Jerry Cotton, an FBI undercover agent who acts somewhat James Bond-like, with smiling self-assured panache.  This time around he's after a diamond-stealing gang.  The Sinister Cinema is a very good transfer.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1440547200,,311,5.844444444444444
8318877,3,B001LNOMQ8,"Decent transfer.  George Nader is totally believable as a g-man - wish I could say the same for his English accent which nearly murders the whole film.  Also the script has his character-in-a-character act completely annoying and totally suspiciously (also, admittedly very valiant in protecting the leading lady) in an attempt to ferret out who is the chief villain.  A few weird exploitation twists offer some interest, and the end offers unusually honest, yet ambiguously sexual twist on the typical 007-and-girl-go-on-vacation ending.  Did they decide to be friends with benefits forever?  Or just BFF?  Unclear.",1315612800,2,616,5.431578947368421
8318878,5,B001LNOMQ8,"You just can't go wrong with George Nader as FBI agent Jerry Cotton, and a killer soundtrack by composer extraordinaire Peter Thomas! You're lucky these films are even available, and you can thank Sinister Cinema for that! More than a bargain!!",1274745600,3,244,4.975609756097561
