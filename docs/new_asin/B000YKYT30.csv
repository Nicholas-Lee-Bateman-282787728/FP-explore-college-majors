3032322,5,B000YKYT30,"This film captures the grace, beauty and tension of the stage production. My ballet loving granddaughter was inspired to dance through the night--she was a featured dancer in the Nutcracker this year--and although she is still too young to wear toe shoes, she is not too young to imagine herself as the ultimate swan of Swan Lake.",1327104000,,330,4.807017543859649
3032323,5,B000YKYT30,"First of all I totally DISAGREE With that Lady V's comments on this DVD, I have collected many versions of Swan Lake DVD'S and Blurays, this is by far the best, in terms of dance technique, custume, and overall stage presentations. it is the ""Russian"" Swan Lake you can't judge it using someone's personal view. the image quality and even lightnings are not as good as many other versions of swan lake but, this is made from 1984 Film, there was no DVD technologies nor Bluray, and dance and custums are very Russian, this what the original! if you like the modern, simplified, often modified Swan Lake, then go some where else, there are tons of them on the market. if you are like myself then you will enjoy it.",1324598400,2,713,4.492307692307692
3032324,4,B000YKYT30,"Yuri Grigorovich who directed Bolshoi for thirty years and choreographed eternal works as Spartacus, Ivan the terrible,Romeo and Juliet, The Legend of Love, et coetera, gave his wife, prima ballerina Natalia Bessmertnova, a chance to, once more in her career,perform the role Odette/Odile in a new wonderful dimention, this time in his own Swan Lake. And if he did rechoreograph Petipa's first and third acts, he also kept some of Ivanov's unsurpassed choreography. He gave the male roles (prince Siegfried and the jester) another weight and lavishingly inserted in the ball scene beautiful pas de deux. Bessmertnava dances throughout the ballet miraculously conveying her immense skill and sensibility to both Odette(graceful and sensitive) and Odile( fierce and seducing).Only Bolshoi could afford to have small parts danced by first rate dancers which is the case. A most memorable Lake, though dated (costumes and scenery). Tchaikovsky's score vividly, passionately performed under Zhuraitis's conducting.",1271203200,,1009,5.688741721854305

3032326,3,B000YKYT30,"To call this the Ultimate Swan Lake is very misleading.  In fact the DVD itself does not carry this title.  It is merely ""Swan Lake"".  It is a pleasant enough production and the corp de ballet are lovely with excellent technique.  But Alexander Bogatyrev has no stage presence at all and although his turns are good, his jetes are very lacking - he seems to forget he has a second leg, and never lifts it into arabesque properly, it just hangs down.  The decision to take some of the beautiful and dramatic music from the last Act and bring it into the 2nd Act is so wrong. other than the beautiful corp de ballet and strong supporting dancers, this is a very mediocre performance, made all the more disappointing by the hype that it's the ultimate....  For a true ULTIMATE Swan Lake, take a look at ABT's Swan Lake starring Gillian Murphy and Angel Corrella, with Marcelo Gomes in Act II as the Evil Sorcerer.  THE ABT version is the best production I've ever seen, and the dancing is exquisite in both technique and artistry, and the ending is the most moving you will see.",1242518400,31,1075,4.482051282051282

3032329,5,B000YKYT30,"Performance of a great quality! The orchestra plays so fine,with a rich and beautiful sound. A special attention should be paid to the soloists- the violin and cello leaders,as well as the oboe player whose play meet very high standarts indeed.

Natalya Bessmertnova is my favorite prima-balerina. She is so perfect that when you watch her,you completely forget what a difficult physical act is the dancing and how many hours stand behind a single performance.
She embodies the spirit of the balley. She dances with her heart and soul,not with her body. Natalya Bessmertnova gives an excellent interpration of the White and Black Swans. She is so tender,unearthy,angelic in the role of the White Swan,and decisive and strong-willed as the Black Swan.
The other balley soloists perform also at a high level.
My sole regret was that the recording was not taken during a live performance.",1206144000,28,885,5.061643835616438
3032330,5,B000YKYT30,"This is a wonderful, classical version of Swan Lake.  It has all the elements and parts I want to see in this ballet: most of the dance segments and artistic excellence and balance. Right from the beginning we can tell this is going to be a great, energetic ballet as Prince Siegfried comes onto the stage in the very beginning and joins his tutor and jester in a lively pas de trois.  it is choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, Natalia Bessmetnova's husband and the director of the Bolshoi Ballet at that time. He was a great choreographer and was especially gifted at staging the classics so that they fit the standards and requirements of today. The role of Odette and Odile is danced by Natalia Bessmertnova magnificently. She always danced with a combination of technical excellence and dignity. Another remarkable aspect of this performance is the uniform excellence of the dancing. Nowhere is there the slightest imperfection! Additionally, I was very impressed with the combination of youthful vigor and mature stature of all the dancing. All of the ethnic dances are included, and the Black Swan pas de deux follows the Petipa version. Rothbart is also given some great choreography here, something that is often neglected in other stagings. The sets and costumes are also at the highest standard--absolutely gorgeous. The image and sound are very good, as well, but keep in mind that this is a ballet movie on color film, so it has that special quality that film imparts. If you don't mind a Swan Lake on film, this is a fine Swan Lake to have in any collection.
Sadly, on February 19, 2008 Natalia Bessmertnova died of a grave, protracted illness, just a few weeks after the release of this DVD. After her retirement from the stage, she had been teaching until her illness.",1204934400,43,1782,4.8202614379084965

3032357,4,B000YKYT30,"This 1984 staging by the Bolshoi has a controversial happy ending in contrast to the usual death of Odette and Siegfried, but otherwise it demonstrates the essence of ballet at its best in the tradition of Diaghilev and Balanchine.  Natalia Bessmertnova is still soft and lyrical in the dual role of Odette and Odile. Her eminently feminine quality makes her the ideal interpreter of this classic. The elegance and magnetism of Siegfried is masterfully portrayed by Alexander Bogatyrev.

The cameras show the stage from appropriate distances allowing to see the dancers moving in space, i.e. not only the expression of their bodies and in correlation with each other, but also the dynamism of their stage crossings, which are somewhat neglected in the ballet-movies.  The facial expression and thus close-ups are secondary in the performance dance rendering the age and thus and the difference between the ages of the dancers irrelevant including 42 years of age of Bessmertnova versus only 25 of Bogatyrev.

3032360,3,B000YKYT30,"This one is the Bolshoi, but it's better than the other movies of Bolshoi ballets, where it seems all that was done was to set up a few cameras around the theater and film a live performance, complete with audience reactions. This one is somewhat more innovative, and the audience only applauds at the very end. Still, it makes me eager to find a copy of the DVD by the American Ballet.

There is a story, I suppose, but you'd hardly know it from the dancing. Prince Siegfried falls in love with Odette, who is under a curse that turns her into a swan by day. She wears a white tutu.

In Act Two, his mother (the queen) is trying to get him to choose a bride, I think. When Odile, who is apparently Odette's evil twin, shows up in her black tutu, we are supposed to understand that he mistakes her for Odile. Problem is, she is danced by the very same ballerina. Now it turns out that the prince can break the spell on Odette by pledging his love to her, but since he mistakes Odile for her and pledges his love to her, it seems Odette is doomed. But somehow he defeats the evil magician and love conquers all.
