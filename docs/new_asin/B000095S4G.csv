7989694,4,B000095S4G,"For a newbie like myself, this is a great video to have.  I watch the thing piece by piece, stop it rewind it and watch sections over again.  The basic benchwork, the tracklaying, the scenery, it's all good and informative. The only things I wish it had was close captioning and just a tiny bit more on putting the kits they specify together.

Overall, this would be good for novices who wants to get beyond the annual trains around the christmas tree and have a permanent layout.",1168473600,6,480,4.494252873563219
7989695,5,B000095S4G,"Wanna learn how to build a Model Railroad but wanna keep it simple? Well this is the Video for you then! Actor and Model Railroad Enthusiast Michael Gross hosts this Video on Building your First Model Railroad! I don't have this Video but it was a Bonus Video on one of the DVDs I got from Kalmbach Publishing. ""Layouts, Modeling Tips, and Prototype Railroads."" This video gives you the basics on building a model railroad. Track, Scenery, etc... Michael doesn't offer too many tips however he tells you how to weather your buildings to make them look realistic. Michael doesn't really show you this stuff, he just narrates it and a guy named Dick shows you how to do the stuff Michael tells you. It is a pretty simple layout to build and mine is actually bigger than this one and more better too. And if you want to build a better layout, check out David Methlie's Stoney Creek & Western on January 2006-March 2006 issues of Model Railroader. In those three issues, it shows step by step how to build The Stoney Creek & Western. However this Video will do good for a beginner. I recommend it for Beginners.",1136332800,3,1107,4.54
