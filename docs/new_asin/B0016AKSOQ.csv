3155370,5,B0016AKSOQ,"""Patriotism"", Yukio Mishima's short film from 1960's Japan is the dismal account of the honorable suicide of a Japanese army lieutenant and his wife in the aftermath of a failed military coup. The lieutenant, played by Mishima himself, is a perfect patriot, relinquishing his life and the life of his pretty young wife to avoid killing his co-conspirators in the failed coup. The young couple share a last night of sexual intimacy before carrying out their suicide pact.

This film is a landmark in cinemat. Aside from being a remarkable political film, quite outlandish in concept and execution for a film made in Japan at this time, ""Patriotism"" is also a sort of an artistic rehearsal for writer/actor/director Yukio Mishima's actual seppuku in November, 1970. Much like the lieutenant in ""Patriotism"", Mishima was part of a resistance movement protesting political changes in power. He gave a speech on the balcony of the Tokyo headquarters of the Eastern Command of Japan's Self-Defense Forces, and when it failed to inspire a return of power to the emperor, Mishima commited ritual seppuku. In addition to ""Patriotism"", Mishima had several other films, poems and works of fiction dedicated to the subject of honorable suicide at the time of his actual seppuku.

Mishima's suicide was indirectly responsible for the film retaining such sharp visual clarity in spite of its age. After his death, his widow ordered all copies of the film destroyed. She felt no need to relive her husband's suicide again and again, and kept only one copy of the film sealed in an air-tight tea container. For several decades, the film lingered mostly as a myth, kept alive by copies of copies passed around Arthouse Film circles. Upon Mishima's widow's death in 2005, the mint-condition print of the film was unearthed. Criterion wasted no time wrapping up this gem and packaging it for mass consumption. The Criterion package includes the new, gorgeous transfer of the film, interviews with surviving crew members, and a thin book that contains Mishima's original short story.

I am a big fan of Criterion's bonus features. Whenever appropriate, they include the literary basis for the film in the film's packaging. For ""Patriotism"" Criterion included the entire text of the original short story. I cannot understate this enough: ""Patriotism"" the short story is WAY harder to read than the movie is to watch. Watching Yukio Mishima realistically play-act suicide is not as bad as having the experience described in the first person. While the movie is very visceral, it is softened and given meaning by soft classical music and tender cinematography. The short story is brutal and unflinching. I had to take breaks from reading it to let my stomach settle, and I'm the kind of guy who watches films like ""Cannibal Holocaust"" regularly. It's easily as intense as anything Chuck Palahniuk has written, and predates his nihilist stylings by 30-40 years. If you get this movie, you owe it to yourself to read the short story. It's a unique experience. You can read the text of the short story for free at: [...]

All in all, ""Patriotism"" is one of the best Criterion treatments of a classic arthouse film yet. The film, the transfer, the special features and the packaging are all top-notch and make ""Patriotism"" a worthy addition to any DVD library.",1257724800,,3333,5.0108303249097474

The film is only 27 minutes long, and has no dialogue (though it has ""written"" narration).  It's really a striking piece of work, and quite startling at times.  It is also very gory and bloody, and can even make today's gorehounds grimace.  I think the violence and blood in this film are much more effective is because they actually mean something, as opposed to many films today who seem to push the uncomfortable gore quotient with no reasoning or rhyming behind it.  Yukio Mishima was an incredibly prolific, intense, brilliant, convulted, complex, and artistic individual, a man of many faces, masks, illusions, and realities, and this DVD is an absolute must for any of his fans.  If you're not a Mishima fan, you should still rent/buy this disc, as you may become one.  The film deals with many Mishima themes, that of patriotism, loyalty, the code of the Samurai, loyalty, modern vs. feudal Japan, etc., and the film is really quite good.  It's staged on a Noh stage, which gives it a very distinct feel.  If it was done in a realistic manner, it would have been immensely boring, but Mishima makes good choices by filming it in this manner.

Granted, this film is not the greatest of Mishima's artistic output (that is his Sea of Fertility tetraology), but it's still absolutely fascinating and holds up quite well today.  The music in the film is a bit overdone, but as the film progresses, one adjusts and it becomes less intrusive.  The DVD also includes snippets of Mishima interviews, and it's absolutely brilliant stuff.  Where many ""artists/writers"" give interviews today and say very little, Mishima encompasses worlds in the few words he says.  His talk about death, heroism, heroic deaths, politics, etc., etc. are very provocative and still valid today.  He certainly wasn't shy about expressing his opinions, but as many people shout to express their opinions, Mishima's opinions are ones that mattre and really make one think on a deeper level.  There is also a 45 minute documentary on the making of Patriotism, with the original crew and producer assembled.  They reminisce about the making of the film (which only took 2 days to film), and how Mishima was pretty well organised for a first time director.  It's a very good companion piece to the film.

8262028,4,B0016AKSOQ,"I got into the work of Yukio Mishima in the mid 1980s when Paul Schrader released his film about the author. As is the case with most films about a particular subject, a documentary was released on TV about the same time and was a very fascinating account of the mans life and work. In the doc they recounted this film he made in the mid 60s and when I saw that Criterion had released it, it was a no brainer for me. It was the same high standard that Criterion has always packaged, a gate fold case, one disc presentation, a thick booklet and a certain amount of supplements on the disc itself...always never enough it seems. :)  The film itself: I am solely commenting on the English version of the film as there is an option of watching the Japanese version. As with 95% of all short films it has its pros and cons. The story is told in the style of Japanese No theater. I know very little of this art form so I cannot comment on whether the film adheres to the parameters of the medium, I will only comment on it as a film experience.  CONS: As with most short films it is not emotional engaging but very interesting to watch or rather look at. Meaning you are always aware you are watching the film and not lost in the experience of it. It is too long in parts, especially the title cards which are presented in a hand written scroll-like effect. It is very pretentious, but that is a given with most freshman filmmakers who do not attempt to make a popcorn-esque movie but an art film. But this may also be the effect of the No theater influence as well in this case.  PROS: It is very well photograped in B&W with some stunning shots here and there. Very artistic in execution. It stars Mishima himself and he did consider himself an actor of sorts and did do many roles for others which did satisfy that thirst within himself. It is an interesting story that he wrote and a concept that was familiar within his writing and his own personal make-up. Some would say it bordered on obsession, which is the minefield most artists live and work in anyway. What is most interesting is the obsession with hara-kiri that Mishima had for most of his life and which is the main focus of the film. It also foreshadows his own death by this same means in 1970 which he consciously planned out/for in the later part of his life. As is with the artist, he had a very poetic concept of the ritual and presented it in the film as such. He also realized the very real aspect of the act of hara-kiri which is very bloody and watching the film one is shocked at how graphic it really is. This film was made in 1965-6 predating the 69 R rated WILD BUNCH famous for its blood soaked ending. In reality, the poetic side of the act that Mishima planned and which played out on November 25, 1970 did not happen. The military crowd he wanted to rally by his side (with the short inflammatory speech he gave) failed to do so and instead they heckled and shouted back at him. Having failed at that aspect he went inside and embarked on his own act of hara-kiri which also did not pay off with the poetic aspect he had hoped for. After disemboweling himself, not in one swift gesture as is the preferred way, he naturally struggled to complete the painful and bloody act. The second part of the act is a that a man with a samurai sword is standing at the ready to cut off his head to end his suffering. His young male partner was assigned the task and had to hack a couple of times to complete his task leaving a bloody mess on the floor. Mishima had his dramatic ending but not in the fluid fashion he had anticipated.  I am not from Asian descent but I fully understand the concept of the Bushido code. I have seen many US sailors interviewed which witnessed kamikaze attacks on their ships and they stated that it totally baffled them, not only at the time, which is understandable since it was a shocking and new way of battle, but even now decades later they cannot wrap their minds around willfully killing themselves for their cause. They understood fighting for your country and dying in doing so but not committing outright planned out suicide attacks. This of course was the glaring difference between Japan and the US during the war and which escalated the brutality between them. By the time of this film, that romantic militarism that Mishima clung and wished a return to, was a simply a bad memory for most modern Japanese who  wanted to put the war behind them. I understand the falling on your sword concept, painful though it is, but the kara-kiri method really tests not only ones willpower but also ones physical strength of cutting open your stomach from side to side. What I cannot understand is the gruesome side of it. Japanese art and way of life is basically so clean and methodical, which goes against the very bloody and messy affair that leaves the body in a closed casket situation.  I loved the film and as a result began to read his novels and learn about his life and dramatic death which is interesting and even now decades after, still a taboo subject in Japan.",1511740800,,5075,4.38788522848034

8262031,5,B0016AKSOQ,"The packaging for Patriotism is elegantly designed. The DVD case resembles a book in the fine paper used as a cover and the print of Mishima as Lieutenant Takeyama, seated, darkly lighted, staring at a dagger in front of him.  The DVD case is similar in design and is accompanied by a book that contains the story Patriotism, production notes by Mishima and an essay by Tony Rayns on the making of the film.  The booklet is nicely illustrated with still pictures from the film and a group photograph on Mishima and his co-star with the production crew.

I have been curious about Patriotism since I first saw Paul Schraders film back in 1985.  I was unaware that Mishimas widow had all prints of Patriotism destroyed, except for the negative. The film was far more artistic in rendering its subject than I expected. The opening where a ghostly outline of Mishima is caressing his wife was an interesting touch. The lighting is very beautifully handled with beautiful shadings of light and dark. I think that non-Japanese viewers should see the slightly longer English version before viewing the Japanese version. It is advantageous to have read the story written out in English on the scrolls.  The new high definition restoration enhances the film beautifully.  I was naturally wondering how the act of committing seppuku would be depicted on the screen.  It was blood but not unnecessarily gory, and the intent by Mishima was not to shock but treat ritual suicide with some poetry.  This is especially true of the final frames of the film where the Lieutenant and Reiko ((Yoshiko Tsuruoka) are shown in a kind of apotheosis, joined forever in death.

The extras are interesting.  The 45-minute documentary with members of the films production staff provides a lot of insight into the making of Patriotism. The audio only extra of Mishima giving a speech in English to the  Foreign Correspondents' Association is interesting in all of the candid comments he provide his audience but also for his command of English.  The last extra is a short interview Mishima gave on war and death.  The interview was amazing for his comments and also that he did not look directly into the camera, perhaps feeling uncomfortable being filmed.

This set is a must for anyone with an interest in Yukio Mishima but anyone with an interest in art films will find this an amazing film.",1405468800,,2366,4.838709677419355

8262033,5,B0016AKSOQ,"This is a very short film directed and starring the writer of a short story that it is based on.

A husband decides to commit seppuku, or hara kiri, rather than having to kill his friends, and his wife agrees to kill herself alongside him.

It's beautifully shot, very simple, and is very graphic, considering how long ago the film was made.

I picked it up as a fan of the Criterion Collection. It is one of the most graphic films I've seen released by them.

The DVD set includes the Japanese and English version (scrolls spread out and moved by the director). There's a few cool special features and a booklet with the digipack, which includes the short film.

It's a great movie, but probably not worth everyone's attention given the subject matter and graphic suicide of the stars.

I'd recommend paying no more than 12 for this, which is a bargain since the short story alone can fetch about the same price.

If you are a glutton for novel(la)->film closeness, this film is one of the few well done adaptations that matches the film you see in your head, as some readers do, compared to most films, which is pretty cool if you're into that sorta thing. No complicated love story thrown in that doesn't exist in the book, so yeah!",1355011200,,1235,4.511210762331839
8262034,5,B0016AKSOQ,"What can I say about this short film?  It's 27 minutes of some of the most amazing filming I have seen.

The Criterion version has an 'English Version' in which the scrolls are replaced with English words.  It doesn't really affect the actual film... but I still viewed the Japanese version in which captions translate the wording.

The extras are amazing.  There are two interviews with Mishima from around this time which are just plain eerie.  He discusses Japan's defeat in the war and what that meant to him as well as his views on death.  Again... just eerie.  There are also several blocks of an audio only Q&A session by the Foreign press in which Mishima answers in very good English.  There is one more interview with the surviving crew from the filming.

The film itself is gut wrenching (literally).  Filming in black and white was the right choice.  The set is arranged in a Noh theater style with sparse settings and stylized touches (such as the snow on the tree).  Mishima actually provides a great performance.  His Co-star Yoshiko Tsuruoka is also very good.

There is a bit of a graphic moment where Mishima actually opens his belly, but I couldn't Not watch.  It's kind of gruesome, but being in black and white gives it the appearance of ink, and as it stretches on the floor like a spilled inkwell.

Even if Mishima had not committed Seppuku later in his life, this film would still be haunting and mesmerizing.  The fact that Mishima visited the same fate several years later only adds to the shock of this film.

Also of note: this film was lost and all surviving copies ordered destroyed my Mishima's widow.  This copy was found in a tea cellar in 2005 and luckily Criterion got the thumbs up to restore and release it.  Something with this much power and magnitude deserves to be preserved and viewed by generations to come.",1297209600,7,1850,4.630769230769231
8262035,4,B0016AKSOQ,"Patriotism is an amateur short art film.  It was shot on a single set in black and white.  Without dialogue, the sound track is a complete and unbroken excerpt from Wagner's ""Tristan und Isolde.""  The subject matter is the ritual suicide of a Japanese army officer and his wife.

I will admit to having a weak stomach.  Between the nihilism that passes for entertainment in America today and film buffs who refuse to look away in disgust, we have an entire cinematic culture of violence, epitomized by films I won't even watch like Hostel.  Yes, I have a weak stomach, but that doesn't mean I can't tell the difference between a shoot-em-up action flick, a horror film, etc, and it doesn't change the fact that death, pain, and murder are parts of life.  Therefore, I find writer/director Mishima confusing and both fascinating and revolting.  This has been true ever since I saw ""A Life in Four Chapters"" in high school and started reading Mishima's work.  What do you make of someone who actually conflates sexuality, death, youth, not as a poseur but in his own mind?  Aside from Mishima's own suicide, Patriotism is his clearest expression of this tendency.  It is appropriately difficult to know what to make of it.  The film consists almost entirely of a scene of lovemaking followed by a scene of disembowelment.  The actors are attractive and youthful, and the camera lingers over their bodies, as it does eventually over their bloodstains.  The film is technically good and affecting, but not enjoyable.  It is difficult to watch.  Has it expanded my understanding or my artistic appreciation?  I'm not sure.  I can't recommend it or pan it.  It exists out there, and you can choose to look or not.  I for one place no value on choosing to look, although I had to myself.

As reviewer Neil Kambeaze points out, Criterion has put together a great package that includes a printed booklet with the original short story in the DVD extras.  The short story goes even beyond the film as Mishima attempts to get inside the head of the dying man and explore the experience of pain and death, something more thoroughly done in prose than on screen.  I agree with Neil that the short story is stomach churning, and I almost regret reading it.

If you are not a Mishima enthusiast, you might want to skip this one.  Also, if you have not seen or read anything of Mishima before, I would definitely not start with Patriotism.  Four stars for great packaging and technically well-made film.",1276819200,3,2486,4.723255813953489
