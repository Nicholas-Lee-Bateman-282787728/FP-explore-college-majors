8732314,3,B0151SDZRU,"This video documentary was a labor of love for me. I spent countless hours in pre-production, researching with the producer, going to different venues and shooting 75% of this documentary on a handshake, and a promise that once it was released I would be compensated. Needless to say.....here it is for everyone to enjoy.
I only gave it 3 stars because the original cut was better in my opinion.  I feel the film shifted it's original intention of showing how and why these people decide to make this significant change in their lives and later compete in a in a beauty competition to something that was re edited to revolve more around certain characters in the film which lost this documentary's original focus.
It was shot in standard definition 4:3 format at the time.",1506211200,,772,4.7611940298507465
