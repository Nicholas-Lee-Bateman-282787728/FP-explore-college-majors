1701038,5,B00006422R,"This set contains my all-time favorite Farscape story, the two-parter, ""Infinite Possibilities"". It relates the end of what I consider to be one of the newest, freshest ideas ever realized on any television series; the possibility of the lead character dying for real, at any moment. It positively ratcheted-up the tension on the series.
Since there is no description of the episodes listed on Amazon for Season 3, Volume 4, I'll provide the data from the ADV website.
""Infinite Possibilities Part 1: Daedalus Demands"" (Episode 314)
An Ancient - again taking the form of Crichton's father Jack - appears on Talyn and accuses Crichton of sharing wormhole stabilizing technology with the Charrids, a vicious race allied with the Scarrans. Crichton realizes that Furlow, the mechanic from Dam-Ba-Da depot who once repaired Crichton's module, is the real guilty party. With a Scarran Dreadnought on the way, Jack must unlock the wormhole technology in Crichton's brain to build the ultimate weapon - but must first confront the evil Scorpius Clone in Crichton's mind.
""Infinite Possibilities Part 2: Icarus Abides"" (Episode 315)
After disposing of the Scorpius Clone, the Ancient 'Jack' unlocks the secrets to wormhole technology in Crichton's mind-allowing them to build the 'ultimate weapon' to destroy the Scarran Dreadnought before it escapes with Furlow's data. Seeing the value of the weapon, Furlow kills Jack and takes off with it. In the ensuing chase, Crichton is fatally exposed to the highly reactive Partanium that fuels the engine. With nothing left to lose, Crichton volunteers to launch the weapon at the Dreadnought, experiencing first hand the terrifying power of wormhole technology.
""Revenging Angel"" (Episode 316)
A fight between D'Argo and Crichton over the malfunction of D'Argo's mysterious new ship ends with Crichton knocked unconscious. The Scorpius Clone in Crichton's mind tries to convince him that revenge against D'Argo is the only way to settle the conflict, but John prefers to resolve it in his own head, acting out a Crichton vs. D'Argo cartoon battle set in Road-Runner land. Meanwhile, the ship malfunction leads to the activation of a self-destruct sequence that threatens to blow Moya to pieces.
""The Choice"" (Episode 317)
Grieving for Crichton, Aeryn travels to a planet of mystics and frauds and makes contact with a man who claims to be Talyn Lyzcak, her father. Talyn puts her in touch with Seer Cresus, a creature who is able to 'channel' the dead Crichton. Meanwhile, Stark and Rygel search for Aeryn, but first come across an old enemy. Lurking on the planet with malign, warped designs of her own is Aeryn's mother, Xhalax Sun.
""Fractures"" (Episode 318)
Not far from Moya and Talyn's expected rendezvous point, Moya picks up a badly damaged Leviathan Transport Pod carrying a Scarran, a Hynerian and a Nebari - all escaped prisoners - and their Peacekeeper hostage, complicating the long awaited reunion between Moya and Talyn's crew. When the Scarran is shot, it's clear that someone on board is a traitor.
Pick up this set now! you won't regret it.",1059350400,55,3094,5.153081510934394
1701039,5,B00006422R,"I have yet to find an episode of Farscape that I don't enjoy.  There are some really great ones, but all of them are good.
I recommend Farscape to everyone!
SAVE FARSCAPE!",1058572800,2,171,4.34375
1701040,4,B00006422R,"3.1 and 3.2 are both quality boxes and the show seems to be pulling me in again (like the first season did), with more ""space scenes"" and some darker episodes with more battles. The stories seem to be a little more cohesive this season as well with less holes. There were a few in season 2 along with a couple bores. Also, there are more edible stand-alone stories (especially in 3.2).
Kreis is becoming a good character, Scorpius got a little old (and confusing) though sometimes his character is interesting and complicated enough to draw me in. I'm not sure why, but the absence of Zhan may be a good thing. Aeryn is so effin hot, her straps carried the show for me at times, and the leather pants are Millimeters lower this season. yeehaw.",1054598400,,743,4.511111111111111
1701041,5,B00006422R,"Although it is not listed here on Amazon, or even on the back of the DVD case, on the episode ""Green Eyed Monster"" (the episode which star Ben Browder wrote) there is an audio commentary track with Ben Browder as well as the director of the episode Tony Tilse.  Ben gives insights into his ideas behind the episode, as well as many behind-the-scenes hints about not only this episode but upcoming ones as well.
(The powers-that-be on the show were so impressed with Ben Browder's writing on this ep that he was asked to write another episode, which will be coming up in season 4, called ""John Quixote"")
I would buy this DVD without any extras, as this series is so fantastic.  However, as I am something of a ""commentary junkie"", I wanted to pass on the info to the other Amazon customers.",1053820800,8,789,4.510489510489511
1701042,5,B00006422R,"The makers of Farscape, not afraid to take chances, truly had outdone themselves.  Fresh after losing a beloved character (Zhaan) and gaining a new passenger aboard Moya (Jool), David Kemper and the writers keep the surprises coming.  Like a boxer delivering a flurry of punches to a dazzed opponent, the viewer is constantly being rocked by pleasantly surprising (sometimes uncomfortable too) storylines.
Different Destinations: Has a bit of a Star Trek feel to it, as John, Areyn & Jool are visting a memorial, are somehow transported into the past.  They find themselves in the time which the memorial was dedicated.  In a small Peacekeeper settlement surrounded and out numbered by the Venek horde.  Unsure how to get back and trying to help the beleagured settlement, their actions are changing past and present times.
A solid episode if not spectacular episode, though the  performances are, as usual, quite good.
Eat Me:  Crichton, D'Argo, Chianna, & Jool in their damaged transport pod are trying to return to Moya, find another Leviathon.  Hoping to find the parts necessary to repair the pod they take a chance and land.  What they find aboard is truly disturbing.  A very good episode that is quite scary by Farscape standards, with an ending that is amusing, confusing and leaves you wondering where the hell are they gonna go with this idea?
Thanks For Sharing:  Moya catches up with Talyn only to find him badly damaged from an attack by a Peacekeeper retrieval unit.  Moya's crew goes to a nearby planet trying to obtain supplies to help heal Talyn's wounds.  What they find is political intrigue and the identity of the Captain leading the retrieval unit after Talyn & Crais.  Another suprise that leaves the viewer with several questions and anxiously awaiting for the answers.  A solid episode that is the foundation, along with ""Eat Me"", for the rest of season 3.
Note: The last two episodes on this disc, the crew is seperated into two groups.  One group stays aboard Moya while the other joins Crais aboard Talyn.
Green Eyed Monster:  The first episode written by Ben Browder,  starts with the gunship, Talyn, and it's crew of Crais, Areyn, and Crichton encontering a live Budong.  For those not in the know, a Budong is sort of a giant space whale.  Before they can react, Talyn is swallowed whole by this huge creature.  Meanwhile, Rygel and Stark are in a transport pod heading to a rondezvous with Talyn.  They only find the Budong, which Stark correctly surmised, has Talyn within it.  The real meat of the story is the character development between Crais, John, Areyn - and yes - Talyn.  Lani Tapu as Crais especially shines in this episode.  One of the best episodes of the 3rd season.
Losing Time:  A form of energy gets aboard Moya and finds refuge within the body of one of the crew.  Shortly afterwards, another energy being comes and enters Pilot's body.  This being informs the crew that one of them is being controlled by an energy rider, a criminal that must be stopped.  The being within Pilot has been hunting it and asks for help in capturing it.  This episode was the least remarkable one by Farscape standards, meaning well above average by normal TV standards.
In this review I tried not to give away the major surprises.  To those unfamiliar with the show or haven't seen these episodes, I can only say that I heartily recommend you purchase this set and every other Farscape DVD.  Its money well spent in anyones Sci-Fi DVD library.",1052611200,19,3476,4.799663299663299

1701236,5,B00006422R,"One of the best scifi shows ever on tv.  So good I bought the series on DVD.

Made in Oz but centers on American pilot.  Very creative and well written.  Actors are excellent.  Once you start, you will be hooked and probably binge watch.  You have to watch the final movies to get the entire story.",1477699200,,298,4.232142857142857
1701237,5,B00006422R,"This stands alone as a great action packed sci-fi adventure of epic scale for those new to the series.  That it concludes the series makes it even better.  I feel that most loose ends were tied up nicely.  As someone who only recently binge watched the entire series for the first time I can not understand the negative reviews for Peacekeeper Wars, it was a pretty seamless transition and only a few subtle clues such as stars aging made it apparent it took years to finish.  It was very entertaining on its own right and the cgi was as always superb.  Some of the makeup did flag and wasn't up to previous Henson standards but still better than most out there now.  It really is a fantastic series, that starts off slowly but like all other great scifi series ends on a bang.  The product itself was good, came in clear, no problems of quality.

we won't see such a series again, no corporation will allow artists and writers the years to develop such costly quality programming nowadays, its all packaged in small episodic 'seasons' and out the door if veiwer count drops an inch.",1477612800,2,1083,4.517948717948718

1701369,4,B00006422R,"I loved the show.  But as it progressed, even though Browder's portrayal of John's partial unraveling is genius in its evolution, the show in general became too arc-centric and obsessed with wormholes.  The conclusion, though a single feature utilizing an arc makes sense, continues that.  It's a bit rushed, much like the last season, and, like the last season, it seems to include some things just for the heck of it. It's certainly not on par with the first two seasons.

Only one complaint: there is no information on the ""two-disc set."" I expected that that the finale was in 2 parts as it stated 180min (3 hours long).

1701464,5,B00006422R,"Here are four great reasons to love The Peacekeeper Wars:

1. The inner-dialogue which takes place inside Critchons mind between John and Harvey.

Some of my favorites in this category include The Einstein Parody, the Arms Dealer Vignette, and, in previous episodes, strolling on the sand amidst the Babes of Bondi Beach, and tossing Harvey into the Rhino Lunchbox.

2. The intensity and versatility of Claudia Blacks emotional range on display.

She lights up the screen with her passion, her sorrows, and her furies, which is the key to the fire-generating capacity of that relationship upon which the entire series depends.

3. The embedded political message in the movie, courtesy of John Howard:

Three is not such a scary number, and the prominent display of the wedding ring.

4....and you do realize, don't you, that we never saw Ka DArgo die, right? Then there is also the matter of Grayza's pregnancy...

1701504,5,B00006422R,"This movie gives closure to the cancelled-too-soon wonderful science fiction series Farscape. It ties up the story threads that were left hanging when the show was abruptly cancelled after four seasons, leaving a huge cliff-hanger. I would recommend watching the four seasons before watching this movie. I loved the movie...found it very entertaining and loved the ending. As others have said, the movie does cram an awful lot into a relatively short period of time...they essentially had to fit a fifth season into a couple hours of film. But it's well worth watching, and I didn't mind purchasing it...for me, it's a keeper anyway. Recommended for Farscape fans.",1447286400,,664,5.157407407407407

1701574,4,B00006422R,"This is the culmination of the Farscape series.  Picture quality is far from best in the DVD version if your spoiled by Bluray, understandable as the series aired on Sci-Fi channel in standard definition first.  If you just want to see it, this is the cheapest medium.  My recommendation, get the Bluray version that has been digitally remastered, and contains the whole Farscape series including the movie, if you are looking at long term ownership.

The movie is the icing on the cake for the end of the series.  Kinda sad to see it end, this is a cult classic for Jim Henson productions.  Acting is great, the characters have excellent chemistry, the props and storyline are top notch.  As with any great sci-fi series, sometimes a little too sophisticated for the common rabble.",1438905600,,782,4.791044776119403

It's a show that I accidentally came across reruns of on TV when I was in High School. I kept watching the episode and laughing about how cheesy it was and by the end...I found myself hooked. That's how it starts with sci fi shows ha ha. I am particularly fond of these ""Collection"" DVDs rather than the season DVDs. At the time the full season DVDs were not available and I worried that I was going to end up spending more money in the end but I was wrong. It turns out I didn't lose out on anything and I am so glad to have them now. Each collection has it's own picture of the Leviathan on the side that is only a full picture when each DVD case is put next to the other. With collections of all the seasons I have beautiful artwork to display on my DVD shelf. I highly recommend this show to sci fi lovers and these ""collection"" DVDs as well if they stick around. Each and every collection comes with extras so rather than just one ""extras"" DVD per season, you get 3! Pretty awesome deal. :)",1422403200,,1097,4.130841121495327

1701997,4,B00006422R,"It's true that this is a condensed story, presenting in under 4 hours a story that should have developed over an entire season... but i did greatly enjoy it and it does make a good finale to this generally excellent television series. When series are cancelled, we don't always get a finale, especially a year or two later. This turned out pretty well, all things considered.

i won't review the actual story, directing, acting, etc, in any depth, because it is up to par with the rest of the series (the prior 4 seasons). Actually, it has a bit less ridiculous nonsense compared to some of season 4, so if season 4 stretched your suspension of disbelief a bit too much (lava...), then you'll be okay with this, once you get past the season 4 cliff hanger's resolution in the first few minutes (this is fantasy, not science, even though it presents as science)... as well as the humorous misplacement of the fetus... (eye roll). But it was still quite an acceptable end to a great epic series. An emotionally involving, and ultimately satisfying, conclusion to the series-long story of wormhole tech knowledge, military conflicts, and character conflicts/development. Would it have been better as a full season? Probably.

If you own Farscape seasons one through four, you need this to complete your collection. It's worth it.",1418774400,,1326,4.8628318584070795

1702032,4,B00006422R,"Farscape: The Peace Keeper Wars was sci-fi's channel mini-series attempt to bring closure and satisfy fans of its epic show Farcape.  Fans can certainly find a lot to enjoy here and general sci-fi fans can find a lot to appreciate here although they may be a bit confused.  However confusion always seemed to be an appeal of Farscape.
This DVD presents the mini-series as one monumental film.  I prefered it in two parts.  There's a lot going on in its sprawling story to digest and a ton of characters involved.  A strength of the series was introducing vivid, colorful characters for story arcs and its carefree/playful spins on sci-fi in general.  Its central character would often refer to Kirk or Spock as well as other favorites.
The major story points of this film include two warring alien races attempt to master wormhole weaponry and the impending birth of Crichton and Aeryn's child.  All in all there's plenty of adventure and wisecracking, which was the hallmarks of the Farscape series.  And there's plenty of effects and puppetry from producer Henson.  Ben Browder and Claudia Black make engaging sci-fi heroes.  Co-stars Gigi Edgley and Anthony Simcoe are also fun to watch as the endearing aliens Chiana and D'Argo.",1416873600,,1232,4.936893203883495

1702147,3,B00006422R,"I bought this, because it's not on Netflix streaming, and I couldn't live with the ending of the regular series where  Aeryn and John were killed.

I honestly didn't think that Farscape was really that great to begin with, but science fiction in TV is pretty hard to find as it is, so you take what you can get. Ben Bowder is actually quite a terrible actor. Either that or John Crichton is just a bad character. Basically he just yells instead of talks, you know what I mean, he pulls out his blaster and is like, ""EVERYONE BETTER CALM DOWN OR I'M GONNA START SHOOTING!"" I mean it's very annoying, but it also ends up being endearing once you've watched the show for so song.

So this finale movie is basically just a conclusion to Farscape. It's nice that they made this since so many other shows just get cancelled and that's it, you never know what happens. But since Farscape wasn't that good to begin with it's just more of the same. I'll certainly never watch it again, but I feel that it's something I should have watched.

After making my way through the blu-rays, which were produced by another company, Lion's Gate disappoints with the lack of bonus features. No commentaries? Come on now. Put Ben Browder with anyone and let him geek out. It will be great. Put Claudia Black with anyone and she amuses with both hilarious smack downs and thoughtful commentary on her character.

It is very clever and exciting, which is refreshing because there really aren't many clever shows or movies these days. I thought the first couple episodes were a little formulaic but still entertaining. I then become engrossed in the story and the excellent performances by all of the actors, especially Ben Browder and Claudia Black.

Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Gigi Edgley, Wayne Pygram - every actor in the series was beyond excellent.  The muppet element, which seemed a little silly at the outset, worked so very well in providing a way to include aliens that did not walk and look like humans in costume.  All in all, the only bad thing about Farscape is that it ended all to soon.  What incredible chemistry, imagination, and story-telling!  I don't expect ever to see another science fiction series that lives up to this one.",1404604800,,620,4.747663551401869

This is one of the best sci-fi series that has made it to TV!  I often wonder who decides the fate of the series...they blew it with Farscape!  At least this Movie allows for the possibility of sequels.,1399507200,,378,4.28169014084507

1702699,4,B00006422R,"Farscape the TV show obviously ended on a nail-biting cliffhanger. I'm glad Peacekeeper Wars came along to wrap up some of the key story threads. Unfortunately, it comes across like a watered down version of the TV show. It'd been 18 months since the show ended when this show aired and the time tells. A few of the actors couldn't quite get into character - or their voice. D'Argo and Pilot both sound very different from the TV show. More importantly, the plot seemed bizarrely contrived at times. I won't give away any spoilers, but at times I felt like solutions to problems came too simplistically. I will say that the ending redeems the film. John Crichton's character arc reaches an amazing conclusion, really heartfelt. For that reason, and for the joy of getting some resolution, the film easily gets 3.5 stars.",1397088000,,820,4.78169014084507

1702701,5,B00006422R,"maybe I shouldn't complain too much since they at least did this last ""mini-series"" to wrap things up, but this show was too good to end as soon as it did. there were so many things they could have done with show going forward and after all, how many season did StarGate run??
the only thing I did not like about the show was they kept killing the characters off and then bringing them back to life. if you are going to kill someone on the show, leave them dead and bring in a new replacement if needed... of course you may want it to ""look"" like someone ""may"" be dead, but to say you can bring anyone back to life just because it is a Sci-Fi show doesn't cut it....",1396656000,,666,4.091603053435114

But for the most part I was just grinning and laughing and even almost teared up.  I didn't agree with how it ended.  But a good story had a great ending.  And I'm satisfied with it.

I completely enjoyed the entire DVD - started watching it with the intention of breaking it up into 3 parts but 3 hours later....

Other reviewers have said that the time span between Farscape season 4 and The Peace Keeper Wars was noticeable, but I thought the story and acting was seamless.  Farscape is kinda funky already, right?  Who's going to notice minor details that fall well within the norm?

Don't watch this without watching the rest of the series as it won't make much sense.  Definitely NOT a stand-alone.

The entire series is rich with excitement, adventure, and mind-twisting, gut-wrenching, heart-breaking emotion. In Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars, the essence remains constant. It's an incredible roller coaster. If it weren't for my honesty, I would have rated 5 stars. Call me what you want, but leaving a few questions to ponder in the end is what makes an ending superb. I would have wished for a slightly open-ended outcome to the plot. Without giving anything away, this movie truly concludes the Farscape saga. I could not detect a single element in the movie out of place, it was very well written. I can assure anyone wondering, it was not a rushed product as I felt Serenity(Firefly, although it was nearly equally as impressive) was. Sure, it was meant to span over an entire 5th season, but the writers were able to get every piece of information necessary to complete the story in one 3 hour slot.

The show has the unofficial distinction of being The Absolute Weirdest Sci-Fi TV show in history, as evidenced by the uncommon tropes, plot devices, and inspired use of practical effects and puppetry. ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" valiantly ties up the cliffhanger ending of the fourth series, whilst giving fans a bit of closure regarding the relationships of the crew. Self-referential cameos abound in this often tongue-in-cheek DVD, and no character is one-dimensional, except perhaps Jothee, who was a brilliant spanner-in-the-works during broadcast, but fell flat here (perhaps the actor wasn't the same here as in the series).

The series was very good and I can't understand (as was the feeling for many fans) why it was suddenly cancelled by the SyFy channel, but I was glad to see the Peacekeeper Wars movie that allowed the series creators to close out the loose ends that the series left when it was cancelled.  I liked all the actors in the Farscape series and was glad to see they all came back for the movie.  The DVD also had a few extras included that made it even more enjoyable to watch.  If you were a fan of the series, then this movie is a must see.  Very enjoyable and well done.",1385424000,,773,4.026143790849673
1703155,5,B00006422R,"It was a good wrap to something that could have kept going, the story lines could have been changed up moved and restarted. Endless.",1384992000,,132,4.541666666666667
1703156,5,B00006422R,"I loved Farscape. A head of its time, the series, the movie. Characters, costumes, the creatures, the spaceships, the weapons, the plots. The creativity just blew me away. Still sorry to see it all end.",1384819200,,202,4.8
1703157,3,B00006422R,"Did anyone else notice how different The Peacekeeper Wars was to the series? Ironically I never watched the series when it originally aired except for a few episodes here and there and was totally lost because I had no idea what was going on. It felt like the Muppet Show Gone Wild.

I had the same lost feeling with the other shows on at the time: SG1, Babylon 5, and Lexx because unfortunately these were arc centered shows and you had to start from the beginning to prevent getting lost.

Fortunately I had strong recommendations from friends who normally don't like these type shows give it the thumbs up so with my Netflix account I started from the beginning and after the normal bumps with any new TV show, they quickly found their footing and I was hooked by all of them. I bought the entire series for each show before watching them all on Netflix because they have a policy of skipping the next video in your queue if it isn't available and that wrecks havoc with keeping an arc storyline in order.

Farscape was the only series that I bought outright without watching on Netflix. Instead I started out with The Peacekeeper Wars. It was on sale for about $10.00 US so I gave it a try. It wasn't bad so later on when the finances were better I splurged for the entire collection. I couldn't believe they cancelled this show because for all intensive purposes it was hitting the mark 99% of the time.

It definitely needed a fifth season because it too quickly tied up the loose ends and it was quite obvious the actors failed to get completely back into character which I noticed clearly the second time I watched it after watching the entire series nonstop; they seemed to have been very tired in this movie because their usual sparks were gone. Chiana looked different somehow like she put on some weight but a few years later in the SG-1 Season 10 episode 200 she briefly reprised her role and she looked exactly like she did in the Farscape series. I spent too much time trying to figure out the differences with her character every time she was onscreen and was very distracting throughout the whole miniseries. Claudia Black had problems also, most notibly being her accent changed. The others had changed also but it seems like they were all very tired and were ready to move on to other projects since they knew this was finally the last time they would be working on this series.

Unfortunately I have no information concerning TV programming in Australia so what the Australian actors did after this is a mystery. I assume Ben Browder went back to North or South Carolina to resume his interests in NASCAR racing before he and Claudia Black were approached for their roles in SG-1. For the most part, Ben portrayed Lt Col Cameron Mitchell just like CDR John Crichton. Claudia on the other hand played Valla Maldoran completely unlike Aeryn Sun to the extent of petty thief and comic relief most of the time; there was the episode which introduced her in Anubis Super Soldier armor which was strikingly similar to her Prowler flightsuit and was beating up Daniel Jackson instead of John Crichton (due to Browder/Mitchell was not on/with SG-1 yet).

The 3-star rating is for the rush to close loose ends and for the actors failing to completley get back into character. The series on the other hand easily get 3.5 - 4 stars.",1384819200,,3341,4.597315436241611

1703199,4,B00006422R,"For me, I had to struggle to get through almost every one of the episodes of the fist three and a half seasons. Here's why. Someone once warned ""don't eat the Brown Acid."" If you watch this series (and you should) you will be convinced that not only did they eat the Brown Acid, but all of the peyote to.

That said, I'm a diehard sci fi fan, that kind of snob that demands that everything in the story be at least plausible. I realized late in my viewing, that if I was going to stick it out, I would have to abandon that platitude. Sadly, I couldn't, but something wonderful happened on the way to OZ. All of a sudden, the writers sobered up enough to say to each other ""we gotta cut down on the Brown Acid and peyote."" Once they did, real character development took place, some plausibility came to bare and the story took real shape.

When I started the show, I was convinced I'd never see it through. By the third season I hated it, but two thirds through season three I really liked it. By season four I was sad it would soon be over and by the end I was left wanting more. I was so turned around and involved in the show I paid $10.00 for the Peacekeeper wars. Last night when I finished the Peacekeeper wars, I realized I hated to see those wonderful characters go. At that moment I  became like all of the rest who bothered watching this show hoping that someday the powers that be would do a reunion show all of these years later.

If your going to watch Farscape, it might be a good idea to indulge yourself in a few Fellini movies or watch the movie Heavy Metal to prepare. Also, open your mind until it nearly rolls out of your head on to the floor, then you might be ready. What ever you do, watch it, and for god's sake ""don't eat the Brown Acid.""",1382745600,2,1762,4.158357771260997

The cast, the crew, the set, and the scripts. It's just hard to narrow down what made this show so great. Sadly I don't think we are ever going to see a show of this caliber ever again. This particular part of the show is The Peacekeeper Wars. After the show was canceled they put together a mini series to end the show in a way that would let the fans have closure. That in of itself explains a lot about everyone involved in this series from the exec's to the fans no one was willing to let the show just die. This show offers some much needed plot point resolves as well as letting John Crichton and the crew of Moya bring the Series to a truly epic close. When I say epic I mean EPIC.

What I didn't like which plagues the whole series is the almost constant fake swearing.  It gets real old after the first episodes and adds no entertainment value.  The sprinkling of adult partially disguised sexual content is what would be considered ""edgy"" without going over the top which compared to ""Lexx"" is mild, is still too much for my taste at times.  For those who cannot watch anything without strong sexual content throughout, it should please them.

Did hear there was a movie however not certain I was up to watching it as most movies to wrap up a TV series usually fail to meet with the expectation and standards set by the series.  This movie did not... it was exactly what it was meant to be, one giant episode to wrap up most of the major arches.

It was really fun to see the stars in Stargate!",1356998400,,107,4.4
1703738,2,B00006422R,"Have just watched the entire series (4 seasons) over a 4-month period, usually 1 a day, and immediately noticed actors not in character.  dialogue seems wooden,  Obviously actors 18 months out of role, and presumably some changes were made in how this was writen/produced/directed vs. the tv series.  All that said, this doesn't feel like watching farscape.  Characters are very wooden, as if their unique characteristics were written out or just not there at all.  The make-up, of all things, is the most understandable, given the personnel issues.

The best sf comparison I could make to explain what I am describing would be to refer to Star Trek V - The Final Frontier (where you have all the actors, but all the characters seem odd or not quite right).  A second one would be Babylon 5 - Legends of the Rangers (so many show elements/tone/seriousness very unlike the original series or crusade).  Do networks/the funders put some kind of campy-officer on these network movies to make sure they make actual fans groan when they see it?  The question isn't rhetorical, if outside money paid/fronted the money to make it.

It is very unfortunate that Vivendi cancelled the show, because a fifth season would have given people a vastly better story, both quantitatively and qualitatively.",1356912000,6,1289,4.981308411214953
1703739,5,B00006422R,Disc was perfect and delivery was quick. I remember watching this series when it was first on and rewatching it has been wonderful. SciFi needs more shows like this.,1356825600,,165,4.724137931034483
1703740,5,B00006422R,If your a true SciFi fan you can't miss this one.  The Farscape series was a  pioneer for its day.,1356739200,,98,3.85
1703741,5,B00006422R,"The Peacekeeper Wars is the long-awaited finish to the bizarre, yet wonderfully addicting sci-fi series Farscape. Having watched the show retroactively (you can find it on Netflix), I was at first mortified that I couldn't simply stream it like I'd streamed the rest of the series. What happened to Aeryn and Crichton? Who were those bizarre aliens? How could they end the series like this?!?

Thankfully, this 3-hour miniseries was available at quite reasonable prices everywhere and after a short waiting period, I got the chance to watch an abridged version of Season 5. And I can say that, despite the reduced run-time and jam-packed plot, the miniseries delivers on all fronts.

It moves fast and would be hard to follow having not watched the rest of the series, but then again, watching the last ""Episode"" of any television series would be confusing. The most important part is that the finale remains true to the ""heart"" of the series (with two minor and not terribly relevant exceptions).

John is the crazy awesome astronaut we've come to know and love, Aeryn is still the most badass lady in sci-fi, D'Argo is just as awesome as ever, Rigel is the strange mix of useful and useless that makes him annoying and believable at the same time, Chiana is just as fun, wild, and loveable as ever, and the rest of the cast continues to impress.

This being a finale, the stakes are raised to unimaginable heights as the long-standing galactic peace finally comes to an end (that's not really a spoiler because the series is called the ""Peacekeeper Wars""...) and John is faced with the ultimate question - what is the price of peace and is such a thing possible in this strange and wonderous universe?

Old friends return in a fantastic yet entirely believable ways, powerful enemies plot and move in their expected earth-shaking manner and the whole series ends with an explosive and hard-earned finish.

My only complaints are that the voice of Pilot was off (some of the special features mention that they'd lost the exact method for distorting Lani Tupu's voice) and that Jool's look was altered (forgiveable) and her character seemed entirely unlike her previous portrayal (less forgiveable). Fortunately, these were the only things that detracted from the otherwise excellent finish and I can't stress enough how minor they were.

If you're a fan of Farscape and are aching to find out how what happened to these beloved characters, buy it right now! You won't be disappointed. If you're not and want to know what the big deal is, check out the series on Netflix and forgive the 1st half of season 1 (it gets so much better from there that it's almost unrecognizeable). When you get to the end of season 4 and are left with your mind completely blown and hurting for more, pick up this miniseries and give the crew of Moya the finale they deserve!",1356566400,,2855,4.790650406504065

This movie was a great way to tie everything up.  The makeup was different and you could tell that some of the actors spent some time away from their characters, but for the most part it fit in quite well.  A few questions were raised in the movie, but nothing that would keep you up at night.

The series itself is awesome for really delving into the concept of 'what is alien?' and 'madness'. I have never seen a show so bravely tackle these and other controversial issues before. They pull no punches, and everything happens for a reason and develops the characters. Even the whimsical scifi indulgences serve to broaden the universe these characters travel, and thus enrich them and the story in turn. I can't speak enough about Farscape. One of the greatest shows this millenium!",1350345600,,591,4.92

Honestly the way they ended the series & brought this movie in to wrap it up, well I expected Much Less & was happily surprised!
Farscape really surprised me as a series. It was way better than it was ever advertised & considering the garbage & stupidity that SyFy plays now it should have ran several more seasons! Oh well I guess people can tune in & watch idiots paint their faces (to wrestle or win a make up contest) but as for me I'm still looking for the next great SciFi series that has a great story line, good effects and that holds my attention beyond the first commercial!",1348444800,,739,4.285714285714286

This movie, Farscape: Peacekeeper Wars tells us what happened after the last episode of the series. It puts an end to the questions that arose after the series ended.  Not only does it provide a good ending, but it really plays on the heart strings of the viewer. All in all, this was an amazing movie and I would recommend it to anyone who has been a follower of the Farscape series.  My rating out of 10 (0= worst and 10= best), I would have to give this movie a 9. A must see for any Farscape lover.",1340928000,2,641,4.153225806451613

Usually, I do not like the ""specials"" that go with a film -- it sort of breaks the magic.  But in this case, after following the series to its resolve in this film, it adds to the magic.  It is fun to see what the characters look like without their make-up, and strange enough, how their true personalities somewhat mirror their screen characters.

This film completes your collection.  Buy it. You will not be disappointed.",1340236800,,653,4.935779816513762

1703951,5,B00006422R,"I really had low expectations from Farscape before watching the series. I had imagined ""Muppets"" as the alien of the week, and ""Red Shirt Muppets"". I bought TWO of those old DVD's with TWO episodes each on them, figuring that was not a lot of money wasted if I didn't like it. I bought TWO so I would give it a fair shake. I was hooked after the first half of ""Premier""  So, I bought the complete series. Watched every episode TWO times, bought ""The Peacekeeper Wars"", watched it TWO times. Now I am looking forward to reading some of the paperbacks.

  Solid series from beginning to this wonderful end with ""The Peacekeeper Wars"". To everyone that was hooked at the beginning and campaigned to get this one made, I give you TWO thumbs up and my appreciation. Without you I would never have had my Farscape experience.

  One of the best parts of The Peacekeeper Wars was that they actually gave the back story to new viewers without ruining the movie for those that already knew it with a half hour ""flashback"" that would have left less time for the story to unfold. A perfect wrap up, for an as close to perfect as you can get sci-fi show.

  On a side note, I am so glad that like ""Gollum"", Rygel was kept alive and on the show to do his ""Dominar"" duties at the end. I really like writing that can make you actually dislike a puppet. Many times I had hoped for his demise, I am glad it never happened.

  I know how late I am with this, especially since Ben Browder and Claudia Black went on to wrap up Stargate SG-1. I am so glad that I let the reviews here on Amazon influence me to give this series and this movie/mini-series a chance. Thanks.",1337212800,,1650,4.300970873786408
1703952,5,B00006422R,"The fact that a major character dies in this wrap-up miniseries should be no surprise to Farscape viewers. They killed off the lead characters every 3 episodes during the series, probably one of the reasons why the ratings never improved by the end of four seasons.

I chose to put off buying this until I could watch the entire boxed set television series sequentially. This I completed just this weekend, and have now watched The Peacekeeper Wars for the first time. This is an ending that satisfies. There is a lot of nuance and drama throughout these 3 hours, and we even get a moral lesson to all the puppetry and betrayals the series was comprised of.

For five years (counting the time between the series and this DVD set), Farscape has revolved around a single plot: wormholes. Specifically, the wormhole technology that IASA astronaut John Crichton had placed in his subconscious from the wormhole aliens. (That's right, Deep Space 9 fans, the ""original"" Farscape stole that idea from your show. That's okay, Crichton uses a lot of plans from science fiction he remembers, particularly Star Wars. But I digress.)

Even here, as a coda to wrap up the demise of the television series, the plot is about those pesky wormholes. The resolution to that story is inventive, and in the greatest keeping with the highest science fiction tradition. If you look at Farscape on an episode-by-episode basis, a lot of it didn't mean anything. Chianna stripping, people slapped into silly flashing light torture chairs (stolen from Kirk's original Star Trek), mental adventures with Harvey, the show didn't always click. This movie's greatest triumph is that it draws everything together. The wild, madcap journey made sense, after all.

Today, the Science Fiction Channel (ludicrously called Syfy) features mindless dreck like Ghost Hunters, where a bunch of morons hide in the dark while another makes a bumping noise. That might be cheaper to run, but it's a sign of just how far that network has fallen since their bungee-boss cancelled Farscape. As the Save Farscape campaign told us belatedly, the world is a poorer place without Farscape in it.

Watch this movie, and see why. (Oh, and that major character death? Off-screen. Meaning they can always come back to life. Hey, it's Farscape!)",1336348800,,2290,4.984293193717278

I had the entire Starburst collection except for S4C1, which I could not find anywhere for the longest time, like it did not exist.  Now I have it, sent from a dealer in Austraila through Amazon, and I am extremely pleased.  Thanks Amazon !!",1336262400,,297,4.363636363636363
1703984,5,B00006422R,"First off, I have been a Farscape fan since the show began in 1999.  I watched the first two seasons religiously every Friday night, but then I was deployed with the Army for a year, and once I returned Sci-Fi Channel wasn't offered where I was stationed.  So, I failed to see the last two seasons, or even knew that The Peacekeeper Wars was made.

Then last year (2011) I happened to notice the series DVD's on the shelf at a store.  I immediately bought all four seasons, and anxiously awaited any more forthcoming seasons.  Little did I know that four was all there was.

After I finished watching the fourth, and final season, I proceeded to skim through the bonus footage.  I noticed a section titled ""Save Farscape"".  I pressed play, and to my dismay, realized that I would never get to see the conclusion to...in my opinion...one of the best and most creative shows ever to grace the small screen.

The next day I began searching the web for Farscape information.  Lo and behold, I saw on Amazon that they had made a movie in 2004 to conclude the Farscape Saga.  I purchased it, and watched it the night it arrived.

I'll break my review of it into two groups, hits and misses (I'll attempt to refrain from providing spoilers):

The Hits:

1. A final conclusion to the storyline that left fans inexplicably hanging.
2. The entire main cast returned (minus Virginia Hey), plus the reintroduction of many of the supporting characters from various seasons with the original actors portraying them.
3. Action packed!  Maybe a bit much so for Farscape, but necessary to convey this compressed storyline to fruition.
4. All the cheesy one-liners that fans have come to know and love.  The tongue-in-cheek nature of the show is part of what made it so addictive to watch.
5. Great character interaction!  The mainstay of the series was built on character development and interaction.  The actors, writers, and producers always did a fantastic job of taking these alien beings, and portraying all of their human characteristics.  In such a fantastical setting, the emotions and motivations of the characters were always very ""humanly"" realistic.
6. A fitting end that matched the theme and content of the series.  It is a true shame that this show was not allowed to finish the storyline as it should have been with a much deserved fifth season.

The Misses:

1. Character voice changes.  Lani John Tupu's voice as Pilot sounded more like Bylar Chrais at moments.  I'm not sure if it had to do with different voice synth technology or if he couldn't remember how to do Pilot's voice.  Francesca Buller, who played Minister Ahkna changed the entire voice of the character from a soft spoken, but confident manipulator, to a screaming, high pitched harpy.  Again, not sure why this occured.
2. Make-up changes.  Several of the characters make-up was different, possibly the original make-up team could not be gotten back together, or they were just out of practice.
3. Overly cheesy moment.  True fans of Farscape expect a bit of cheese in the show...it's part of what made it fun to watch.  However, there was one scene, and I won't specify...but it will be easy to identify...where they went above and beyond.
4. Only diehard fans will have a clue as to what is going on.  I don't really have a problem with this as I believe the movie's target audience was the diehard Farscape fan, but if you haven't watched the show; you will not want to buy this movie as you will be lost from moment one.
5.  Lastly, a bit too compressed.  However, I understand that the writers and producers were trying to compress a 22 to 24 episode season into roughly 4 episodes, so I don't really fault them.  The problem is, without some of the backstory a fan is left wondering about certain things (and I won't add spoilers) that must have taken place in between the end of season 4 and the beginning of The Peacekeeper Wars.  Unfortunately, fans will probably never know the answers to these questions.

All in all, I rated it 5 stars, not because it was perfect, but because I loved the show, and I was so happy to finally get to see the end of the storyline.  Even though I would rather the show have never ended.  The flaws, to me, are minimal, and are overshadowed by the fact that too often fans of shows are just left hanging when a series is cancelled.  The fact that Brian Henson, Rockne O'Bannon, and all of the actors were able to come back for one last ""Hurrah!"" and finish the story so that the fans would be happy makes the flaws in continuity all too negligible.

For those reviewers who seemingly hated it, ""Me thinks thou dost protest too much!""",1335312000,,4642,4.628361858190709

1703989,4,B00006422R,"I followed this entire series and loved 90% of it. The movie was a little over dramatic, some of the voices did not sound the same..(Pilot) and they changed a couple of the character's appearances without giving any explanation. I was going to love this no matter what, just because of my love for the show, but it was very obvious they were trying to crunch in too many things last minute.",1330732800,,390,4.430555555555555
1703990,5,B00006422R,Great show.  All of the Lexx fans out there will enjoy this set.  Sci fi with an Australian sense of humor that holds up to more than one viewing.,1329091200,,146,4.0
1703991,5,B00006422R,"I was a fan of Farscape when it was on the old SciFi(SYFy) channel, and when it just vanished, I was disappointed. I think what was different about this show were two things: just how good Claudia Black is as an actress-with no disrespect to the other cast members-but also, their aliens seemed like REAL aliens.
The end of the fourth season just left ashes and other assorted bad tastes in my mouth. When the Peacekeeper Wars came out, everything was up-tempo; the action, the interaction between the characters, the colors, the CGI, everything. It was so much better. However, as with any tragic drama, somebody had to die. Everybody I know who is familiar with the show never saw the death of D'Argo coming. Even that was handled with great care.
All in all, I found the Peacekeepers Wars to be exciting, fast-paced, and very entertaining.
I don't understand why this show had to end. I'm sure the characters would agree that it could've gone on indefinitely. There are so many story lines and back stories that could've kept it going for at least another 5-7 years.
I find myself asking that about a lot of science fiction shows that are really, really, good: why did this series end? I felt that way about Star Trek: Deep space 9, and I definitely felt that way about Farscape.
If you want to be truly entertained, and see the old gang again, please get this DVD. It is really worth it. From beginning to end. There is no down time.",1328486400,,1437,4.552123552123552
1703992,5,B00006422R,"I got hooked on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape/dp/B002GP7ZWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape</a>&nbsp;after a friend recommended it to me. Her description of it made it sound a bit like a goofy televised sci-fi comic book, which is not exactly to my tastes in science fiction. However, I quickly became a convert after watching the first few episodes. Another reviewer here said it perfectly: ""It's lame in all the right ways"".

By the time I had watched the entire series on Netflix, I knew I had to have this wonderful series on DVD, so I purchased the set from Amazon. I was disappointed, though, that the fifth and final season had not been made. Why they cancelled ""Farscape"" one season shy of its intended five-season run is beyond me, as it is such a creative and imaginative show. I suspect, though the usual culprits - money and ratings - were the culprits.

As with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firefly/dp/B0000AQS0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firefly</a>, though, the makers of ""Farscape"" were kind enough to their legions of fans to put together a great movie to wrap up the series. ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" never made it to the theaters the way the ""Firefly"" wrap-up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serenity/dp/B000BW7QWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serenity</a>&nbsp;did, but no matter.

""Peacekeeper Wars"" is a movie/three-hour miniseries that neatly wraps up all the loose ends that were dangling after the Season Four cliffhanger ending, and does it by telling an extremely entertaining tale full of final confrontations, resolutions and battles. Of course, it wouldn't be ""Farscape"" if there wasn't plenty of tongue-in-cheek goofy humor, so naturally there's plenty of that as well.

I won't get into the plot here, as there's many reviews that rehash various plot elements. Rather, I'll just say this. As absurd as the premise of the series is (and I mean ""absurd"" in the most complimentary of fashions) I ended up caring about the characters (well, except maybe for Rygel). The scriptwriters and actors put a lot of effort into making the crew of the living ship Moya into multi-dimensional beings who are actually worth caring about. That's what good television is all about, and ""Peacekeeper Wars"" is a perfect ending to a show that is a wonderful blend of entertainment and character development.",1328313600,2,2462,5.811634349030471
1703993,4,B00006422R,"I've recently fallen in love with Farscape. It's lame in all the right ways. This movie, or miniseries collection or whatever, is the culmination of everything from the TV show. It doesn't quite manage to wrap up all the little plot lines (Rygel doesn't get his throne back, etc), but it provides an ""end"" past the fourth season. However, in my opinion, there is absolutely nothing here for anyone unfamiliar with the series. Without the TV show this stuff makes almost no sense.",1327708800,,479,4.783132530120482

1704025,5,B00006422R,"I bought this off the German Amazon site. The reviews on that site mostly did not like the quality as a Blue Ray disk. The image has a slightly pasty quality. The disk uses an MPG2 video codec instead of the typical AVC video codec. Also they used 1080i instead of 1080p video. I would guess the slightly pasty quality results from the overuse of DNA noise reduction. The image has a very smooth noise free look,again a sign of DNA noise reduction. I don't know what the source master was but I would guess an HD broadcast master because it's on the disc in two parts rather than one as on the DVD release. On the plus side the image is sharp and the color and contrast are quite good. Overall the image is a vast improvement over the SD DVD's. The website says it's a Region 2 disk but the one I received was region free. Some U.S. Blue Ray players will play the disk out of the box. But it uses a 25FPS video rate so most BR players will see it as PAL format and won't play it. I have an LG BD630 which converts PAL to NTSC and because the disc is region free played it without any problem. My Sony BR player wouldn't even recognize the disc. There is computer software that will make the disk playable on any U.S. BR player. Overall I would recommend this disc any serious Farscape fan. It doesn't appear to be a copyright sanctioned disc since there's no credit given in the disc menu. It will have to do until an official BR release comes,if ever.",1325894400,2,1452,4.226618705035971

1704032,4,B00006422R,"As Farscape fans know, Syfy doesn't just cancel shows, they first lie to both the fans and the show's producers about how many seasons/episodes they're going to give the shows and then suddenly go back on their word. While other networks let folks know that they could go either way on struggling shows, Syfy keeps adding a level of cruelty by making people think they have one specific plan, then suddenly yanking the rug out from under them, so fans get caught by surprise and producers don't have time to give their shows a proper end.

With Farscape, Syfy told everyone they'd ordered two more seasons of the show, but then suddenly cut one season in half, claimed it was two seasons, and canceled the show, which ended in the middle of a story (it was only after tremendous fan pressure that the network finally produced a mini-series to wrap up some of the story).

1704054,5,B00006422R,"While obviously produced as a reaction to the fan-base demand for at least one more season of Farscape to wrap up all the series' loose plot threads (WARNING, SPOILER ALERT: especially the death of John and Aeryn), the Peacekeeper Wars miniseries nicely delivers most of those threads wrapped up into a nifty little bow.

Frankly, it would be more satisfying of course to deliver the final chapter of the saga across a season-long story arc, with even more in-depth and detailed explanations and character cameos, but Peacekeeper Wars fills the bill for any die-hard fan of the series.

When I first decided to invest into watching Farscape, I wasn't sure puppets from Henson's creature shop would be realistic enough, that I would be able to suspend disbelief deeply enough.  But I was wrong - Farscape delivers a satisfying epic space saga in all ways imaginable, including special effects, believable puppet-driven characters (Pilot, Rygel, etc.), incredible craft, space and planetary scenes.  But it's the plots and story lines that make the series, with beautifully paced character development, new freshness induced with every season, and a very satisfying conclusion to the whole epic that I found appealing.  Peacekeeper Wars is a great conclusion, and while it may seem a bit abbreviated to some (only a four episode miniseries), it's good enough for the vast majority of us (and is certainly infinitely better than nothing).  Invest into it.  If you haven't seen it, but have seen the series, or if you're planning on buying the series box-set, then this final chapter is a must purchase - you'll certainly be left empty and unsatisfied without it.",1320624000,,1659,5.077205882352941

I was sad when they took it off the air as well as several of my friends at work that also watched the series.  The Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars dvd had several sad key moments when characters die and these are characters that you have gotten used to seeing in the series but it made the movie and awesome finale.

1704062,4,B00006422R,"Let me begin by saying this: This was not how the Farscape series was intended to end.  The Sci-fi Channel pulled funding from the promised 5th season just before the 4th season aired, despite solid ratings.  Because the 4th season had already been filmed, the series ended with a ""To Be Continued..."" screen.  What resulted was a massive public outcry from fans of the show, resulting in this: The Peacekeeper Wars.

Now that I've provided some background, I can actually review the product.  Peacekeeper Wars is good.  It's Farscape, and I love me some Farscape.  The acting is great, the writing superb, and the premise is unique and fresh.  In short, it has all the things that made the series so great, so if you like the series, odds are you're going to like Peacekeeper Wars.  That said, if you haven't seen the series, this is most certainly not the place to start; watch the show first.  If you have seen the show and didn't care for it, you may want to pass on this.

My only problem (and it isn't really a problem, really) with Peacekeeper Wars is that it seems like everything is rushed or crammed.  This is understandable; the creators had to shove in a lot of the stuff that was planned to be spread within a whole 22-episode season into a few hours in order to tie up the loose ends; though the ending is left a little open for the possibility of future Farscape stuff, so cross your fingers!",1313884800,,1407,4.496062992125984
1704063,5,B00006422R,It was a shame when the series was cancelled before they could produce a final season to close up all the loose ends of the show.

Well worth buying for anybody that saw the series.,1312848000,,343,4.014705882352941

1704097,3,B00006422R,"Peace Keeper Wars is definately better than the ending of season 4, but is loaded with bad writing, production and directing.
to start with, if Braca would take command away from Grayza for attempting to start a war in season 4, then Braca would have surely taken command away from Scorpius for starting the war then turning traitor.
Then we have the whole bringing Criton and Aeryn back, no problem with that, what is reduculas is the baby was in Rygel, the baby was crystalized and was not brought back to human form with Criton and Aeryn, if the baby was brought back while in Rygel, then it could have been put back in Aeryn and brought back. There is no way to nurish a baby if it is in your stomach, so the baby growing in Rygel's stomach was impossible.  Not to mention the size of the device to transfer the baby.

In the final battle, it is mentioned that all small arms be broken down and made into bombs and only heavy arms used (knowing the pulse pistols will not hurt Scarran) yet Criton keeps his and is killing Scarrans with it (this could not happen) and Aeryn kills War Minister Akhna with 1 shot from a pulse pistol.

I purchased this and watched it 1 time, could not bring myself to watch is again. The only reason I give it a rating of 3 and not a rating of 1 is because it is better than season 4 ending",1307577600,4,1324,4.246031746031746

That being said, I did not love this movie. The thing that irriated me the most was the makeup. It was painfully obvious that the original make up crew was not on set for the movie. Chiana and Scorpious looked especially horrible. Sikozu was the biggest disappointment in regards to makeup. The story meandered and was confusing. The birthing scene reminded me of a campy 80's comedy. I don't know how this movie is getting so many great reviews. Sadly, it does not deserve them.

The movie does have some redeeming qualities though. The visuals were stunning and true to the tv series. The ending was extremely well done. The best quality is that it's a Farscape movie. The actors are amazing and deserve much more credit than they are given. Ben, Claudia, Anthony, Gigi, Wayne, Lani, Paul... they all deserve Oscars.

I wish I could say that I loved this movie but I cannot. I liked it. Maybe it will grow on me if I watch it a couple more times.

It is wonderful, because you know that one John will win Aeryn's heart.  And if that is true, what will the other John do?  Add the fact that PeaceKeepers are still on their tail, at the same time Scorpius is getting closer to finding out how wormhole technology is working, and you have time running out for John and his friends.

All three editions have pretty much the same commentaries and the like but I like the extra little bits the Starburst editions gave. The only problem I had with the starburst editions is that some of the early runs of the disk sets were double sided disks which gave my dvd player fits and caused me some headaches as I had to flip the disks. (Note that by double sided I mean there was stuff on both sides of the disks and after watching one side you flipped the disk over and watched the other side. If you can you may want to make sure you are getting a set with four disks with material only on one side as these played better.)

1704160,5,B00006422R,"Farscape was the first sci-fi series I had watched. What deviated it from others was the fact it was more mature and darker than other series I had seen or heard of during the 80s and 90s.

Season 1 is a slow starter to the series, Season 2 gets it going, and both Season 3 and 4 bring the darkest and deepest elements of the story into the fray. When Sci-Fi (now SyFy) cancelled the series just as Season 4 was prepping to air due to a reduced fanbase between Season 3 and 4, the repercussions for its cancellation were severe. The fans clamored for the unfinished story to be finished. The series' creator, Rockne S O'Bannon, had planned to do 5 seasons from the start. So, what Sci-Fi did was allow the series to be concluded in a mini-series due to financial backing from various institutions as a result of fan clamor for the premature ending. A two part mini series that summarized the main plot of Season 5, with no character development or build, was the result in Farscape: Peacekeeper Wars.

When those episodes released in two nights, both sequential to one another, they were regarded as the highest rated shows aired on those two days. It's been 6 years since the series concluded on TV.

This DVD has the length of 4 episodes, which are over 3 hours in total length. So, do not expect a short special for what you pay.

The story, although abridged, does a great job of keeping things professional, consistent, and cycling along at a brisk pace from the cliffhanger ending left at the end of Season 4 to the brilliant conclusion at the end.

Anyone who is interested in the entire series would do well to note that the Farscape Complete Series does not have the Peacekeeper Wars (which is why this is packaged separately). Lions Gate Entertainment secured the rights to it when it was produced while Hallmark Entertainment held the rights to the series. So, if you buy the Complete Series, you'll need to buy this DVD as well to have the complete set.

Considering the pricing on the DVD sets right now, spending not that much more from a brand new PS3 or 360 game for a complete series is worth the money for a cult classic sci-fi series.",1294099200,,2153,4.493606138107417

After some fund raising, petitioning and of course the help of Brian Henson, Peacekeeper Wars was produced in 2004 which compressed season 5 down into a 4hr finale. (3hr run time)

About Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars,  the movie picks up pretty  much right where season 4 ends and begins to long task of tying up plot lines and bringing the show to a conclusion.  The movie didn't pull any strings and you could tell they went all out with production values giving it their all so that Farscape went out with a bang; and it did!

** The important thing here is that Peacekeeper Wars is not a stand alone movie.  It is highly recommended that you look into Farscape Seasons 1 - 4 first before purchasing this product.  Not only will this movie make far more sense, it also won't ruin the show for you by giving away many plot lines.

-- Overall this is definitely a must see movie for any fan of Farscape.  Just like the show, this movie starts and never lets off the accelerator; giving you strong plots with great pacing and acting!

++ Farscape: The Complete Series package does not include this movie (despite it saying complete series) mainly due to production rights. A&E/Jim Henson Studios finally got the rights to publish the Season 1-4 shows; while I believe Lions Gate and Sony(? don't quote me on it) owns the rights to the movie.",1293494400,,1943,4.461756373937677
1704164,5,B00006422R,"I own every relevant piece of Sci Fi there is and Farscape trumps them all in my far fetched sense of fun. This was supposed to be season 5 with a conclusion to the series added to wrap it all up. I found it to be ultimately satifying in the way that most others fail miserabely at. If you like Farscape it is a must have. If you have never seen Farscape buy this DVD but do yourself a favor and get 1-4 first. There is a very nice A&E set that is priced more then fair( looks as good as any of my Bluerays in an upconvert player).I loved the entire thing more then any Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Andromeda, Earth Final Conflict, Lost, and so on.",1292112000,,652,4.1015625

Yeah it had a lot of action...and a birth in the middle of the fighting in which the baby didn't cry at all!!!  The story was a little confusing at times even for someone that just finished watching the series.

We lost one of my favorite characters and I wish that hadn't happened.  It was unnecessary.  After demonstrating the wormhole weapon to both the Scarrans and the Peacekeepers they decided to broker a peace deal instead of being killed by this deadly wormhole.  But these two races are too power hungry and would never ever have a real peace treaty, especially the Scarrans.

In the end we don't know what happens to the characters so it's not a real conclusion.  It was O.K., not great, not bad...just O.K.",1286409600,3,817,4.466216216216216

1704188,5,B00006422R,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape/dp/B002GP7ZWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape</a>&nbsp;as a whole is a quirky, funny, dramatic, heartfelt, and rewarding, but somewhat obscure science-fiction show, particularly when compared to the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B001TH16DI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-SG-1/dp/B000TJBNHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate SG-1</a>. However, it boasts a devoted fan-base whose efforts after the SciFi network abruptly cancelled the show after the cliffhanging conclusion to season four (despite promises to the writing staff that they would get at least one more season) ensured the creation of a miniseries to wrap up the loose ends that were left dangling and resolve the character-arcs of the main characters.

The result was ""The Peacekeeper Wars"", and before we go any further, rest assured that if you aren't familiar with the preceding four seasons of Farscape, you'll have no idea whatsoever what's going on here. This is a show strictly for the fans, and the culmination of four years worth of intricate storytelling. If you're intrigued, you'll have to wend your way back to the start of season one: rest assured, you've got quite a ride ahead of you!

The series begins with the remaining crew of Moya (D'Argo, Chiana, Rygel, Stark and Noranti) carefully collecting the crystallized remains of Crichton and Aeryn (and their unborn child) that were strewn at the bottom of a water planet at the end of season four. Having been resurrected by a race of people that are renowned for their peacekeeping abilities, Moya's crew decide to utilize them in the escalating conflict between the Peacekeepers and the Scarrans, two races that are bent on seizing wormhole technology to use as a weapon against the other. And where is this technology to be found? It's locked inside Crichton's brain, giving him leverage over each side whilst simultaneously painting a huge target on his back.

To say more is to give away the final chapter of a story that's been steadily brewing for nearly four years and counting; the final big bang in an epic journey in which what's at stake is nothing less than the wellbeing of the known galaxy and the birth of the protagonists' longed-for baby. It's in turns epic, intimate, suspenseful, thoughtful, hilarious, tear-inducing, revelatory and inevitable, and the longer you've been on board the Farscape bandwagon, the more effecting it really is.

Of course, it's hard not to watch it and wonder what might have been. ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" is essentially the entirety of what the writers had planned for the proposed series five, all condensed down into four hours. On the plus side, this means that we have a tighter, more fast-paced story, with a higher budget and absolutely no filler material. The sense of urgency is palatable, and the plot winds tighter and tighter as options begin to run out for our heroes. On the negative side, with such little time involved in the telling of the story, the characterization is a bit shortchanged. John, Aeryn and Scorpias take centre stage (though even Scorpias is nudged to the side toward the end) and although the writers are very careful to give each one of our beloved cast the chance to take their moment in the spotlight and do something truly heroic, there's simply too little time to give all of them meaningful development.

As said above, if you don't already have an understanding of these characters from the television series, you'll find it difficult to find a reason to care about them. The miniseries is about closure, not growth, and what you see here is the accumulation of four seasons worth of development. D'Argo, Chiana and Rygel get plenty of great moments, as do Stark and Scorpias, but newer characters such as Grayzer, Noranti and Sikozu are relatively minor, and plenty of questions concerning them are left unanswered. It is with them that one keenly feels the lack of a fifth series, as seeds that were sown in the forth season concerning Sikozu's genetic engineering and Noranti's mysterious third eye have by necessity been cut down before their chance to reach fruition.

But in other areas, the writers excel. Though Chiana's newfound psychic abilities and her consequential blindness are glossed over almost immediately, we do see the return of D'Argo's estranged son Jothee and get a poignant resolution to their relationship. Rygel goes through a rather hilarious - er, traumatic experience (he's come a long way from the greed-obsessed Dominar from the first season), and there's even a return appearance from season three regular Jool and season two guest star Grunchlk. And who else was immensely chuffed to see Braca finally come into his own after spending the entire show as someone or other's butt-monkey?

In terms of continuity, there are some inexplicable bits. Why have Jothee's facial prosthetics been changed so radically? Why does Jool greet Crichton with a passionate kiss? And what on earth has Sikozu done with her hair?! But for the most part the creative team have done an exceptional job of recreating the look and atmosphere of the show whilst widening it in depth and scope.

Would a fully-fledged season five have worked better than a movie-length miniseries to wrap up Farscape? Possibly, but for what it's worth, the cast and crew do a fantastic job with the opportunity they've been given, and the gratitude they hold toward the fans for making it possible is obvious. The biggest plotlines of the series, namely the tempestuous love affair between John and Aeryn, and the struggle between John's consciousness and Scorpias's neural chip are brought to satisfactory conclusions, leaving the audience with a profound image of hope, peace and further adventures to come - for the Farscape characters, if not for the viewers.",1284854400,2,6025,5.381760339342524

Some people have dvd players that have trouble with the double sided disks. Make sure that you know what you are buying if double sided disks are an issue for you.

I have watched the entire Farscape saga and then the Peacekeeper Wars --- and did not know the background as told by one of the reviewers here that the series was cancelled prematurely and that this movie was made to give closure to the series.

My mistake. First I bought Peacekeeper Wars, to see how the series ended. Then I bought the whole series and watched it, sometimes five or six shows in a row. As a total Babylon 5 fan, I thought that was the best science fiction show I'd ever see -- Farscape was just as good. The key to the show is that you like the characters and care about what happens to them. In addition, the show would deal with themes and make points without hitting you over the head with them. I'm sure in some quantum universe out there John Crichton and Aeryn Sun are still rocketing around the galaxy -- I only wish I could share it with them.

On the other hand, if you ARE a Farscape fan, then you also know that you HAVE to watch Peacekeeper Wars because of the abrupt (and very unsatisfactory) ending of the series finale.

To make a long story short, Peacekeeper Wars is necessary to tie up all of the loose ends of the brilliant sci-fi series Farscape.  The ending is exactly what you expect will happen, albeit not quite as happy for all of your favorite characters as it could have been. Peacekeeper Wars uses familiar plot devices, action sequences and (sometimes frustrating) interpersonal conflicts of the diverse crew of Moya that you fell in love with long ago.  Unlike Serenity, which arguably wrapped up the even more unfairly under-rated Firefly series, Peacekeeper Wars is very faithful to the mechanics of the original program, and there aren't that many jarring surprises.  Of course, unlike Serenity, Peacekeeper Wars is NOT a stand alone feature and will only confuse you if you haven't bothered watching the entirety of the Farscape series.  (And let's face it, you should anyway...it's good for your sci-fi karma.)

The only truly sad part about Peacekeeper Wars is that once the credits roll, you know that the story is finally over.  Of course, in every good sci-fi flick there is always the possibility of future open-ended 'adventure', but in this case, at least you get to lay the series propertly to rest.

Well, lucky for me, and FARSCAPE fans everywhere, a year after the final episode, the fabulous cast and crew were able to make FARSCAPE - THE PEACEKEEPER WARS, which was a much better, long waited, cherry on top ending to the beloved FARSCAPE series.

1704340,5,B00006422R,"The story (mine ;), I saw this at the store and decided it looked pretty cool, so I bought season 4 and the end movie 'Peacekeeper Wars'.

I didn't realize that I'd already seen some of the episodes (for previous seasons) when I got it. As you can tell from the title, I'm crazy about it! :D

This is a very cool show and has some very interesting special effects / aliens due to the Jim Hensin company. (Though once in a while it's a little creepy that Kermit is related to these guys. :/  lol)

There is quite a bit of 'sexuality' however, so I would not recommend it for the younger audience.
(Personally I'm rather conservative so I would say - for some episodes anyway, not all - maybe 17 and up, and overall pg13. Of course that means everyone else would probaly say pg or maybe pg13. Just to give you an idea.)

The only downside is that after watching the last season I still wanted to see the other seasons and they tend to be fairly pricey. Due to the fact that adv sold the rights to SONY and SONY hasn't begun to bring them back out yet, so there aren't many copies of the seasons available.
I didn't realize quite just how lucky I was that I managed to get the last 3 seasons for less than $64 each (starburst editions even -those r the newest editions available.) at first, but I do now. The first unfortunately usually ranges from $90 - $550. They're supposed to be good quality, but sheesh! That's ridiculous.
So I shall have to continue to wait for SONY to get their act together and get some brains and bring back the first season. So very sad.

I hate to say this, but the wait is still worth it. Farscape rocks! I will wait, and I will see it all someday. :)",1243641600,,1678,4.211838006230529

But given 3 arns to wrap everything up they do an amazing amazing job, and even leave it open ever so slightly for possible returns (granted with the time passed at this point getting the cast back could be tricky) But this conclusion to what I consider one of the greatest most tragically cancelled shows ever is simply astonishing. This movie pulls you back aboard Moya for one powerful run. The characters are all back, and the chemistry is all there. I actually missed the show the second the credits began.

1704368,5,B00006422R,"...of one of the best sci-fi shows of all time. I won't say ""end,"" but if that's how posterity remembers PK Wars, it could have done much, much worse.

Peacekeeper Wars, in short, does a superb job both tying up all dangling plot threads from the Farscape series and leaving openings for wherever the franchise goes next. The special effects, considering that it's a miniseries, are spectacular. The writing is even better--PK Wars loses nothing in the transition from show to miniseries. The characters are their same, bizzarre selves, except on a bit larger scale. The caliber of performance, from everyone involved, is excellent--but that was only to be expected.

That said, PK Wars is NOT a good selection if you're looking to discover Farscape. You will likely leave your experience extremely confused, irritated, and perhaps a bit ill from the overall weirdness of it all. Farscape, unlike Star Trek or many other shows, cannot be picked up at any time--it is very much an arc show, and each episode, although not necessarily a ""sequel"" to the one before it, very much builds on the character relationships developed previously. The dynamic between all of the members of the spectacular Farscape cast cannot be immediately understood; it's usually too complex and bizzarre for that. PK Wars is very much the conclusion to one ongoing story, (that is, the arc of the original Farscape series) and can no more be watched first than ""Return of the King"" can be read before the other Lord of the Rings books. That's just...ooh, a terrible thought.

So, the best possible soltion: Watch the rest of the series first! (This is assuming the reader is new to the show. If you are already a Farscape fan: trust me, PK Wars is completely worth it. Every bit as witty and fast as the best parts of the show, and extremely poingnant. Absolutely well done!) Farscape is primarily a show based on relationships and interactions; the plots are fantastic and gripping, but would mean very little without the chemisty and/or tension between the characters. Given the proper time and order to develop, these dynamics will reward the watcher with one of the most complex and thoroughly enjoyable emotional tangles ever to grace your television. (or laptop, or iPod, these days...) But ONLY then. Give the book a chance before you read the epilogue; the ending is only as good as the middle makes it.

And this particular middle makes for one of the best--and most fun!--sci-fi chapters ever written, acted, or viewed. You won't regret your patience.",1223856000,,2537,4.906759906759906

Clearly, the producer and editors addressed this problem and made it functional, but it is still a difficult hurdle to cross for the uninitiated.

The movie is luscious visually and intriguing with what will save the galaxy from an all-out war between the Peacekeepers and their 10x larger competitors--the reptilian lords with some nasty interrogation capacities.

1704441,5,B00006422R,"I love Farscape. Even episodes I don't like, I still love because the show at its worst was still better than anything else I've found on television before or since.

This collection from Season 2 begins with arguably the best stand alone episode of the series. Out of Their Minds takes the conventional scifi tactic of having characters switch bodies and blows it out of the water. The entire crew switches bodies not once, but twice. As the episode progresses the audience is treated to some of the best acting of the series as the actors embody each other to perfection.

The Look At The Princess trilogy is the first three episode arc Farscape has attempted and the first of two this season. While not the strongest trilogy of the series, plot lines are advanced, characters evolve and in typical Farscape fashion the suspense, thrills and stakes are extreme.

In My Three Crichtons, Ben Browder gets to stretch his considerable acting muscles and play not one, but three different incarnations of John. That alone makes this episode worth watching. Throw in a very thought provoking ending and the episode is worth it.

Beware of Dog is an episode I love not for the main plot so much as the character development that effortlessly occurs with it. John and Aeryn's love story-which got a major boost in the LatP trilogy-gets a further nudge here. John's descent into madness as a result of the neurochip Scorpius implanted in his brain continues at breakneck speed.

Lastly, Won't Get Fooled Again takes us back to Earth, only something is very, very wrong. This time around, John immediately realizes he's not really on Earth. Familiar faces show up playing very different roles. The Scorpius Clone offers him advice and encouragement, letting him know what's really going on. The episode is darkly hysterical, with an emphasis on the hysteria.

All in all, this collection offers some of the strongest episodes of the season (and series) along with a few episodes I consider weaker. But as I said, any Farscape is amazing and every episode keeps me glued to the screen-even for the fifth or sixth viewing.",1196294400,,2112,4.852777777777778

If you look at the other seasons on Amazon you will see the difference. The Starburst Editions for the other three seasons are only $22.

The best way to see Season One, unless you are willing to pay the elevated price, is to find someone who owns it and borrow their discs.

Farscape is a ground breaking science fiction series that should be seen by all. Even though it was canceled five years ago, there is still a huge fan base that is eager for more. In 2004 a miniseries was created that tied up the cliff hanger at the end of Season Four, but was still not enough. Recently the Sci-Fi Channel has announced the production of Farscape Webisodes, which will continue the story.

Farscape is edgy and inventive. It blows Star Trek and Stargate SG-1 out of the water. It is not only a sci-fi show but a love story, an action-adventure thriller, a horror, and even a mystery. It grabs you and makes you wanting more. It is one of those shows that cannot be seen from the middle or the end but the beginning. Everything is important and every detail will create an impact.

We learned even more about John's hidden wormhole knowledge and more about Jool's ancestors and their link to the human race. I won't say too much for those of you that have not caught up with the series but please keep in mind it is indeed a great end to a very fun adventure. Alhough it was a great ending, there is definitely room for more.

Incidentally there is talk about Farscape webisodes so it seems to me that the adventure will continue if Ben Browder and Claudia Black can sign on for the much talked about webisodes.",1188777600,,604,4.541284403669724

While I would have absolutely LOVED a season 5, this will do.  This is also one of the 2 movies that made me cry; the other being The Passion.  I will not spoil it for those who maybe have not seen this yet, but I am not one who normally cries over a movie or mini, but I wept like a baby after watching this.

Really like the romance between Aeryn and Chricton, because it's not typical, and loved Chiana becauzse she is so cheeky! ;)

This is another example of the Sci-Fi Channels mis-handling of a great series; and it was to be replaced by, ""The Dream Team?""  How pathetic was that?

Yes, if you've never seen the series, you are not going to be able to follow this show, what do you expect?  It was supposed to be a ""final"" episode, and what a great series it was.

Although I have found other Jim Henson productions engaging - I especially liked Labyrinth -- I found this one to be seriously lacking in depth of character.  They were walking paper dolls. Only 'Pilot' showed any real personality.

There was a plot twist at the end that I found interesting - even ironic - but it wasn't enough to redeem the movie.  I'll be putting this one back up for sale: not a keeper.",1181433600,,633,4.3760683760683765

And when you first see the alien puppets, its hard not to laugh.  But the show is a load of campy fun and the character development is deep and fascinating.  The show is actually quite sexual and there is a lot of action and in fact my one complaint is that there's too much action.  The crew seems to bounce from one life threatening event to another and we rarely see how they are making any money or buying food/fuel.  Firefly was much better in this regard where the crew was constantly looking for work.  I highly recommend this series to anyone remotely interested in Sci-Fi or even plain old romance.",1179705600,,732,4.306569343065694
1704489,5,B00006422R,"As a diehard Farscape fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this second Starburst into the Second Season.  The 7 episodes contained are ""Dream A Little Dream"", ""Out Of Their Minds"", ""My Three Crichtons"", ""Look At The Princess Part 1; A Kiss Is But A Kiss"", ""Look At The Princess Part 2; I Do, I Think"", ""Look At The Princess Part 3; The Maltese Chrichton"" and finally ""Beware Of Dog"".  You also get a 30 minute interview with Virginia Hey entitled, ""Building Zhan"" as well as Deleted Scenes and Bloopers from Season 2, The Farspeak Game which challenges your knowledge of some of the vocabulary used in the show,and Actor biograpies for Anthony Simcoe (D'Argo) and Virginia Hey (Zhaan), The Moya Menu, A segment of cool Farscape Facts, Alien Encounters and Alien Races Multimedia Gallery using cuts from the shows and a production design gallery of drawings.  There are more things in there from this season as well as season 3, making this a rather busy 4 disc set from ADV Films.

I was very happy to be able to catch all three of the ""Look At The Princess"" episodes one after the other as it is almost like having a Farscape Movie before the ""Peacekeeper Wars"" came about.  The episode of ""My Three Chrichtons"" was also a stretch for actor Ben Browder, playing three different versions of his character, each sharing characteristics but in some rather unexpected sideways slants. The Episode of ""Out Of Their Minds"" also is unexpectedly filled with some tongue in cheek humor as the characters are shifted about in their bodies one from another and take up the personalities of each other with some rather unexpected results as well as curiousities satisfied.  If you can't afford to get an entire seasons' run, the Starbursts are a good value for the dollar.",1179014400,,1750,4.759075907590759

Other shows have suffered a bad ending because of being cut-off (Enterprise) but because this movie wraps up a plot line the show was heading toward there is a sense of completion. Its a shame they killed a good character (seems to be a common feature in endings).

I didn't like all the puppets and people in crazy suits and makeup at first, but once I got a few more episodes in I really LOVED it.  I just ordered the second season, and I'm totally hooked.

1704532,5,B00006422R,"I am continually amazed at the inventiveness and distinctive character of Farscape. Notably, Farscape is a series in which puppets have leading roles (giving Farscape a greater breadth and depth of alien behaviors and appearances than other sci-fi series like Star Trek) and where the characters' personal storylines are given time to develop and flourish. Farscape is also distinctive through its solid casting, well-written scripts, and unusual additions to the sci-fi TV pantheon: a living ship bonded with a species that serves as guide and translator, hybrid species carrying behaviors and components of both their respective parents, and romances that flourish among the members of altogether different races.

The plot is fast paced, sometimes requiring the viewer to make some jumps in time and logic to catch up with a new episode's plotline. Despite this, nearly every episode of Farscape is enjoyable on a visual level with or without explanation of prior plotlines. Best of all, the Starburst series is affordable, and despite the product description, contains four single-sided DVDs, all with highly entertaining special features. Long live Farscape!",1173398400,5,1163,5.4972067039106145

1704535,4,B00006422R,"It's gets a 4 ONLY because the case it comes in is so bad, otherwise it's a 5.

You already know Farscape if you have made it to season 4, it's great and original. Albeit Season 4 is the weakest season of them all, so I'm going to tell you about the product and not the show.

ADV as many know totally screwed up the first 6 releases of Season 1 and 2 with there double sided problematic disc. So they fixed it with Season 3 and Season 4, but could ADV have picked a worst case design? I have yet to get a case were the tabs that hold the disc in weren't broken on at least one of the disc if not more. Everyone (case) a received came with loose disc and broken tabs, everyone! The overlapping disc make it difficult to get them in and out and while they seem to fall off the tab holders fairly easily they at the same time seem really hard to get out once they are secured by the tabs. I thought more than once I was going to break a disc getting them out.

Farscape is a 5 without doubt, season 4 extras are a little less but that's not a big deal to me. I just wish ADV the company that released the Starburst edition had a little quality control. Granted the Starbust is for the most part, affordable and packed with extras, but that doesn't give you a pass on quality. As I understand it, as of this writing Sony has aquired the rights to Farscape and ADV will not be releasing anymore sets. Perhaps Sony will re-release them in a quality set that is problem free.",1172275200,5,1469,4.076124567474048
1704536,4,B00006422R,"Farscape has always been the anti-Star Trek and the disk are no exception.  Everybody has really strong personalities and are always butting heads with each other.  Some of the scenarios are unique while others are very cliched but handled in a quirky way that makes them feel new and interesting.

In ""Different Destinations"" while visiting the site of one of the great battles in Sebation history, Chrichton and friends get transported to the past and get to live through the actual battle.  The episode reminds me a bit of ""Army of Darkness"" with Crichton and Aeryn fighting to save a castle under siege.  And, true to Farscape form, while trying not to disturb the past and therefore upset the future, the crew manage to get a key war hero killed before he can fulfill his destiny, leaving them and theur friends in the present in a heap of trouble.

In the aptly named ""Eat Me,"" a madman who likes eating people's brains and a group of Sebation scavengers with the mentality of animals are on board and doing major damage to a Leviathan with a Peacekeeper control collar.  Imagine if Hannibal Lector were written by the Farscape crew, and you might have some idea of what this guy's like.  This episode also witnesses the death of not one but TWO of Moya's crew.  Well, sort of.

In ""Thanks for Sharing,"" there are two Crichtons.  All testing indicates that they are identical.  No original, no clone.  They play rock-paper-scissors for hours, always ending in a tie.  And Crichton finally begins to get why the others find him annoying at times when he starts to get on his own nerves.  Meanwhile Moya's offspring Talyn is getting himself in trouble again, and Aeryn's mother Xhalax Sun is heading the Peacekeeper retrieval squad sent after Talyn.

The second and third episodes on this disk are key episodes in this season.  If you skip ahead before watching these you will get lost.

Not that this makes a film not worth watching. Having said that I wish the producers had hired some science adviser's to check the science out of the stories as much of it is unplausible science. This would have costed them little.

Overall I would say the series is well worth watching although I do think it is not as good as some similar shows like B5 or firefly. Still after you have seen them. This is worth a look.",1169942400,,687,4.3671875

I was on the way out, company showed up, the dog got out, etc.  Coupled wth the incessant commercial breaks on the afore-mentioned channel, it spelled disaster for my attention span.  I'd start to go along for the ride, but lose interest between commercial breaks that ran on and on.  Plus, as I recall there was a glut of Star Trek, Star Wars, Stargates, etc. at the time, and I was a bit cynical and burned out on sci-fi in general.  I didn't pay enough attention, and didn't give it a chance.  In short, I blew it!!!

Fortunately, I recently had an opportunity to sit down with disk one in this series and within five minutes of viewing the pilot episode, I was hooked.  It's sci-fi adventure at it's very best.  Mind-boggling, eye-candy special effects, wonderful and exotic characters, and something we don't get enough of in science fiction anymore-excellent acting and quirky, original story-writing!  This seres was produced in Australia by Australians, and it's obvous they enjoyed the creative freedom to cut loose.

some thoughts: 1. Chiana's character doesn't really get much of a send-off does she? 2. We find that Grayza is hugely pregnant at the begining of the movie, but nothing ever becomes of that. 3. The ""traitor"" is discovered but her character's motivations really don't make sense if you think about some of the things she says in the course of the movie.

While some die hard fans mark my reviews unhelpful as I report the disc quality and not the quality of the show! (I figure you know what you are buying! and would better like to know the quality of what you are getting.) The series is a solid 5 in my book, and has always been so, but not the first 6 collections due to the double sided, dual layer format that caused so many to be returned, as with other folks here I too had to return 4 of the 6 before I was able to get a collection that would play properly. WITH THIS COLLECTION ... ADV finally saw the light! They released the collection on single sided disc, and while I'm not happy with ADV as I asked if there was a problem with them long, long ago and they just acted as if it was the first time they heard anything. I had to contact them as I was having trouble getting a RMA AGIAN for a bad disc, by correcting the release and putting them on 4 disc instead of 2 they have all but admitted there was in fact a PROBLEM! Even though they would not admit it months ago. I even have an email from them stating there was no plan to release them on 4 disc! I guess they got as tired of complaints as buys got of returning them. The single sided collection is far better than the prior as you would think in quality, no skipping, no popping, no freezing, nothing but good solid Farscape fun and entertainment, without having to try and skip over bad spots or fiddle with to get it to play.

We can only hope that ADV will offer a trade in offer on those releases already out to upgrade to the problem free collection. Sure it will cost them money, but it cost those of us with bad disc time and money to find one(s) that worked. (A 80 mile roundtrip drive for me in rural Kentucky) The very least they could do is to offer a replacement collection at cost for the first 6 collections. As of this writing I do not know if they plan to release the first 6 collections (2 seasons) on single sided disc or not, however a wise company would. My guess is you will find a lot of 2 disc collections on eBay if they do. Again a great series finally on enough disc to justify buying it. Plenty of extras over the boxset releases, albeit again many are repeated from disc to disc and collection to collection, overall good video and audio quality for hours of viewing.

1704592,5,B00006422R,"I just started watching Farscape and the Starburst Editions have been great for me.  I would recommend this for anyone new to the series.

The extras are beyond what I thought they would be, with a great number of audio commentaries for your listening pleasure.  (Check out the Claudia Black and Ben Browder commentary for ""Throne For a Loss"".  It's a scream!)

They do spoil some things for you in the special features and/or commentaries, but nothing that will ruin the entire series for you, only minor details that could mean nothing to you and/or you'll forget about later.  If you absolutely detest spoilers of any shape, form or size, just watch the episodes first before going through the extras and you'll be fine.

So, I need not drone on about the show itself.

So, the set. The ONLY thing I can think to complain about is the number of episodes. It has approximately the same number of episodes on it that the others do, so it's not disappointing in that regaurd, I just wish there was less disc-switching that needed to be done.

The renders seem fantastic. I've a relatively old DVD player and it had no problem reading and playing the disc (which I seem to recall reading another reviewer complain about in a previous Farscape set). Also, I must say that I'm not 100% thrilled with thier methodology for packaging the discs. Having to take Disc 1 out to get to Disc 2, and remove Disc 3 to get to Disc 4 is kind a pain in the butt, but a minor inconvenience when weighed against the sheer amount of entertainment the set contains.

The special features, as always, are intriguing and entertaining, and answer quite a few questions that avid fans may have.

I won't spoil anything, but be prepared for a hilarious, bizarre, and fun-filled ride that keeps you guessing (and cheering).

1704627,5,B00006422R,"What I love about Season 4, especially the first four episodes, is that John Crichton finally gives the UT the proverbial finger. For most of his time in on Moya, he's running, hiding, getting his @ss handed to him, and wondering ""why can't we all just get along?"" Having to survive alone on a dying Leviathan like Robinson Crusoe teaches him a few things. The most important seems to be that the universe is not a nice place and it never will be. From that point on, John Crichton is out for himself.

And I love it.

Now, don't get me wrong, I love John Crichton in his hippy free love days, too. The most interesting aspect of Farscape to me is watching John's journey from wide-eyed, gee whiz kid into the shoot first, ask questions later guy he becomes. Season 4 just ushers in another (the last?) leg of the wild ride.

Season 4 is a bit of a bumpy ride. While there isn't a single episode in this season I don't adore, the storytelling gets a bit muddled in the middle. That said, the first few episodes, up to Promises and Aeryn's return to Moya, are amazing. Abso-frelling-lutely amazing.",1151020800,4,1097,4.447761194029851

The last three seasons have been released on what is called the Starburst Edition. These DVD collections put an entire season on three DVD sets instead of five. That means you get about seven episodes per collection as opposed to just four. Also the Starburst Edition DVDs have a retail price thats about 40% less than the standard collections.

1704651,5,B00006422R,"I agree somewhat about what the reviewer below me says about season 4, but not all of it. I am a huge farscape fan, but for some reason, when the second half of season 3 aired on the scifi channel, I missed a lot of those episodes. I think I started watching again at the end of season 3. I bought the third volume of season 3 a couple weeks ago and watched it. Surprisingly, I think I had only seen the last 2 in that volume of episodes. I disagree with the reviewer below me about that volume. I honestly think that some of those epsisodes were not good at all. I think the one about John being unconcious and imagining a cartoon world where he can take revenge on D'argo was probably my least favorite episode of farscape...ever! The only thing that held the season 3, third volume were the last 2 episodes.

Now, for season 4, which honestly, I think is my favorite season of the entire show. John and the crew from Moya actually go back down to earth. The scarrans come into the show for the first time as a real force to be reconed with. Although many have a problem with the way season 4 ended, I actually love the season. It seems a growing trend in shows these days where the bad guys eventually turn into better/good guys. Scorpious goes through this transition in season 4. He goes the way of crais. He is pretty much kicked out of the peacekeepers and has to join johns crew on moya. Irony at its best. Anyway, this is a must have for any farscape fan, myself included.

I became a Farscape fan near the end of it's third season.  I had been hearing about it for a while so I decided to check it out, I was hooked instantly.  Farscape had it all, Action, Drama, Horror, Comedy and Suspense.  I quickly bought up all of the previous seasons on DVD so that I would be up to speed when season 4 began.  I was later shocked to find out that Season 4 would be that shows final season.  When the show ended I was heartbroken but then I heard about The Peacekeeper Wars miniseries.  Farscape lives again!!!

1704653,5,B00006422R,"I'm sure most of you reading this are familiar with the off-camera saga of Farscape, namely the SciFi channel undercutting and cancelling Farscape prematurely.

Thankfully the creators of the series were given the opportunity to finish the story and to do that they had to compress a whole season of story into just three hours (four hours when broadcast on TV with commercials and promos).

Obviously it would have been nicer if we had a whole season for this story to unfold but we didn't. The mini-series may not be perfect, but given everything I said already, the creators/directors did a pretty good job in compressing as much as possible in such a short period of time.

Fans of Farscape will no doubt love this. For those not familiar with Farscape, the best thing to do is start from Season 1, 2, 3, and 4 and then this DVD. The DVD sets are available here on Amazon at reasonable prices or if you are patient you could watch the reruns on TV, but that's a slow pace (one episode per week).

1704654,5,B00006422R,"The bad news about Season Four of FARSCAPE is that it wasn't as good as Season Three, but that is absolutely not a reflection on Season Four's quality.  Season Three of FARSCAPE is not merely the best of FARSCAPE's four seasons, but one of the finest seasons of any show in the history of television.  I'm not sure that any show took as many risks as these guys did that season and the remarkable thing is that so many of the risks succeeded.  The whole arc of the inadvertent creation of two utterly identical John Crichton's and their separate fates--one to get paired with Aeryn Sun on Talyn where they would consummate their romance before his death, the other to be separated from Aeryn and to have to deal with her grief upon returning to Moya and her dilemma that the man she loved was both dead and yet still alive--was without parallel in both television and film.  In my opinion that season is one of the highlights of the history of television.  Season Four, on the other hand, is merely outstanding, a first rate season, but inevitably a bit of a disappointment compared with what before.  It is like Babe Ruth hitting 54 home runs in 1928 after hitting 60 in 1927.

Nonetheless, Season Four starts off somewhat anticlimactically after the fireworks of Season Three.  The season ended with everything in chaos.  Talyn and Crais were dead (though the actor who played Crais, Lani John Tupu, continued on the show as the voice of Pilot), Scorpius's worm hole project utterly destroyed, and the surviving John's romance with Aeryn seemingly unable to continue because of the enormous conflicts she has undergone.  Season Four also starts off by introducing several new characters or at least establishing them as permanent ones.  The final episode of Season Three found a mysterious old woman on Moya who seemingly came from nowhere, whose name we later learn is Utu-Noranti Pralatong.  In the first episode of Season Four we meet Sikozu, played by the beautiful Raelee Hill (though her make up isn't completely flattering to her), a remarkably intelligent woman whose many unique physical skills and overall agenda is only gradually revealed throughout the season and the subsequent mini-series.  Commandant Grayza was introduced at the end of Season Three, but she returns in Season Four as not only the major antagonist of the crew of Moya but of Scorpius as well.

The episodes making up this set are probably the weakest of Season Four.  None are actually bad, but most of the highlights take place in the last two-thirds of the season.  The first episode, ""Crichton Kicks,"" which takes place on a different, dying Leviathan, is a good start to the year, but isn't as good as what went before or what would come later.  The two-parter ""What Was Lost"" was a good sequence that once again was not as strong as the arcs that preceded or followed it.  In these episodes we do bid farewell to Jool, which pleased me simply because I couldn't abide her screaming (literally--her screams could melt solid metal) or her unfortunate hair prosthetic.  In this two-parter Grayza apparently kills Scorpius.

The biggest event of the end of Season Three was the ""coin toss"" that decided that Aeryn was going to leave Moya.  Of course, no one had any illusions about whether she would return, only when.  The final episodes in this set deal with her return to Moya, suffering from the overheating to which Peacekeepers are susceptible, with a fugitive she had promised to protect for having saved her life:  Scorpius.  Her time away from Moya has led Aeryn, who is pregnant, to reconsider her feelings for John (and allowed healing over the fate of the other John) and she lets John know that she is open to renewing their romance.  Interestingly, John's response is to get a drug from the Old Woman that numbs his feelings for Aeryn, though his motives for doing so are not revealed until later in the season.  Meanwhile, all we know is that John refuses to get back with Aeryn.

Season Four as a whole is a very strong one, though most fans of the show understandably find it somewhat disappointing following the sustained brilliance of Seasons Two and Three.  In fact, it is very nearly as good as Season Two, the brilliance of Season Three causing it to suffer by comparison.  Still, there is no point where this isn't a first rate show, which made its cancellation following the end of the season all that more difficult to comprehend.",1144281600,12,4440,4.759791122715405

1704690,5,B00006422R,"Warning!  Multiple Major Spoilers!

I personally regard FARSCAPE as the finest Sci-fi television series ever (with the caveat that FIREFLY had the potential, at least, to at least match it).  And I regard the third season of the series as the main evidence of its brilliance.  The heart of Season Three is contained in this and the next set in the DVD releases, episodes that cover what happened after John Crichton was cloned.  There is an old Chicago band called The Three Johns (one member is John Langford, front man of the punk band the Mekons).  In my mind I think of Season Three being subtitled ""The Two Johns.""  These episodes plot the separation of the two Johns and the complete flowering of the romance between Aeryn and the John with whom she is paired with on Talyn.  One half of the episodes follow the group that ends up on Talyn and the other half those who remain on Moya.  Most of the interest, of course, is with what happens with Aeryn and her John.  On the one hand any fan will be delighted that John and Aeryn have finally managed to break down the barriers to their relationship, but on the other hand will feel the poignancy of how this is going to effect the John who is still on Moya.  When I saw this the first time I couldn't conceive how they would resolve this almost impossible situation, though the death of the John with Aeryn in retrospect seems obvious.

The writers and producers took tremendous chances in the plot here.  I can think of no parallel in storytelling in either film or TV for the developments in the romance between John and Aeryn in these episodes.  Guy gets girl yet at the same time loses her to someone else, and it doesn't help that he has lost her to himself.  It is an absolutely tragic romance, yet in ways that one has never seen before.  Although it is not contained in the episodes in this set, the cold and detached manner in which Aeryn responds to the surviving John's greeting in the later episode ""Fractures,"" when Talyn and Moya finally rendezvous again, is one of the saddest, most poignant moments in the run of the show.  They gambled mightily in letting the narrative take the turns it did, but it was a gamble that paid off mightily, in creating one of the most unique plot lines in the history of television.  This is simply brilliant television storytelling.

Almost all of the episodes in Season Three are at least very good (with the exception of the excreble ""Revenging Angel"" that will start off Volume 3.3 in the DVD sets, a poorly conceived and even more poorly executed animated episode, which ends up looking like a very poor imitation of Warner Brothers cartoons), many of the episodes here are exceptional.  ""Green Eyed Monster,"" written by Ben Browder, is one of my favorite shows in the entire series, in which Talyn nearly kills John because of his relationship with John, and in which John seriously misunderstands Aeryn's relationship with Crais.  And the two part episode ""Infinite Possibilities,"" which sees the demise of one of the John's (with Magda Szubanski, best known to American's for her starring role in the two BABE films, reprising her role from Season One as the conniving mechanic Furlow).  But to tell the truth, individual episodes aside, the real greatness in this season comes from the story as it develops through multiple episodes.  The whole truly is greater than the sum of its parts.

The truly great thing about these sets are that they reproduce the more expensive original DVD releases in far more affordable form.  At these prices, these are truly bargains.  You get a huge number of special features.  In fact, the FARSCAPE releases have as many or more special features as any TV show I know.  And beginning with Season Three they corrected the great sin of the Starburst releases for Seasons One and Two:  no more double sided DVDs!  To accommodate more discs, they have made the cases slightly thicker, but I prefer that and having to deal with four single sided discs than having two double sided discs.

This is a must own series for anyone interested either in quality long story arc television or extremely innovative Sci-fi.  This is just a superb series on every level.  Except as animation.",1138060800,14,4221,4.668470906630582

What I've always loved best about Farscape is the risky storytelling. Farscape wasn't afraid to do anything or go anywhere and nothing illustrates that better than the story that unfolds in the last four episodes of season 2.

I'm also thrilled that a commentary has been added to Die Me, Dichotomy. I'd had my fingers crossed that I would get to hear Ben Browder and Claudia Black's thoughts on such a pivotal episode.

Collection 2.3 ushers Farscape to a new level. I'm incredibly happy with the dvd and I'm so happy with the extras ADV has included. One can hardly even debate over the 'worth it' factor with these Starburst editions considering the cheaper price and extensive extras that are included.",1132704000,6,918,4.9480519480519485

They only caution I would have is that if you're unfamiliar with the main story, it will ruin it to know the outcome of the story before you've seen the previous episodes.  Otherwise it is an exciting show.",1130457600,,363,4.246376811594203
1704728,5,B00006422R,"Although FARSCAPE had no bad seasons and no set in this series will be of anything less than completing enjoyable, this set contains what is arguably the ones where the show evolved into what it in fact was:  the most innovative Sci-fi series in the history of television.  In particular, in these episodes the story arc that would extend from the three ""Look at the Princess"" episodes to the final minutes of the miniseries would be in place.  For it is in these episodes that John and Aeryn's romantic interest in each other, which had previously been latent, is made explicit and we begin getting the first concrete hints that something is not quite right with John's head, though we won't learn precisely what until late in the season.  All we know for certain is that John has begun to see Scorpius even when he knows that he isn't there.

Like many fans of FARSCAPE, I've only now started turning in my old recordings of the show for DVDs now that we are finally getting acceptably priced copies of the show. Although there have been other TV series that have appeared in overpriced editions-THE X-FILES springs to mind-FARSCAPE was the only one in its original edition that could be said to be prohibitively so. I'm not sure about other fans, but there was simply no way that I was able or willing to pay for a set that listed for well over a hundred dollars. One could make some complaints about the new Starburst edition-for instance, I'm still not clear on why they have to dribble these out two discs at a time, instead of releasing an entire season at once-but two things one cannot carp about: the cost and the number of extras. As to the former, I've been about to find each disc in the Starburst so far from various resellers listed on Amazon for no more than $16 apiece. As to the latter, each of the three sets making up each season is stuffed with a variety of special features. Some of the special features feel a bit like filler, but a number are substantive.

As in all these sets, the final side of the second disc has many interesting special effects.  Here the longest is a long interview with Virginia Hey that took place after the demise of the series, with her hair regrown and skin decidedly not blue.  Even though she was 52 at the time of the interview, she honestly doesn't look as if she could be a day over 35.  People talk of good genes, and she has them aplenty.  As long as the interview is, it is incomplete, and will presumably be completed in another set.  There is also a blooper reel (my favorite is when D'Argo bumps against a huge rock column and it moves forward-ooops!) and some raw footage of ""The Flax"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"" from Season One, which is great to see what the scenes look like on the set before special effects have been added.

All the episodes on this disc are excellent (though I cringe a bit when I see the identity-switch episode ""Out of Their Minds""-why must every show employ this hackneyed plot device when it never leads to anything good, with the notable exception of the stunning two-parter on BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER where Buffy and Faith switch bodies, the exception that proves the rule), the highpoint of the set and one of the highpoints of the entire series is the three-part ""Look at the Princess.""  Although on one level it is about John's nearly being forced to become a prince (and statue) on a planet over which Scarens and Peacekeepers struggle for mastery, in reality it is about John and Aeryn.  Although there had been flirtations in the first season and a half, and in one virtual reality episode apparently spent on earth a night of passion, their feelings had more or less remained sublimated.  Here, however, the three-part saga begins with John and Aeryn on his shuttle, with her showing him piloting tricks, when things get more than a little passionate.  Breaking off from their kiss Aeryn yells that she will not be a slave to his hormones, when clearly her hormones are every bit as guilty as his.  While John seems pretty clear on how he feels about Aeryn, the former Peacekeeper, suffering from a lifetime of being taught not to have strong feelings for others, is having a difficult time figuring how to come to terms with how she feels for John.  When the crew descends to a planet about to celebrate a royal wedding, they discover a practice whereby someone places a drop of a liquid on the tongue of a member of the opposite sex, briefly touch tongues, and then kiss.  If they are genetically compatible, a sweet taste will result; if incompatible, a bitter taste.  The ambitious prince, younger brother of the woman who is heir to the throne, has poisoned her DNA so that any Sebacean who kisses her will prove incompatible.  When she kisses John, however, who being human somehow is immune to the poison, a sweet taste results and John suddenly finds himself about to become royalty.

In the end John avoids all the intrigue to either kill him or make him a regent.  Back on the ship a scene occurs that demonstrates as well as any in the run of the show what makes it so special.  Although it has as many or more special effects as any show ever made, a host of aliens and exotics settings, and as much action as even the most avid action nut could hope for, the most exciting scene occurs in a quiet moment between John and Aeryn back upon Moya.  Seeing each other alone for the first time after their ordeal, John talks happily to Aeryn until he finally call attention to her persistent silence.  Aeryn breaks off her exercise, reaches for something nearby, and then holding up one of the planet's compatibility vials walks slowly towards John.  Both of them quiet now, she hands the vial to John who places a drop on her tongue and then on his own.  They kiss as the music rises and then break off suddenly as it lowers.  She turns around to face the camera, a blank expression on her face which holds for a second, and then breaks into a smile that barely represses the joy is obviously feels, John also breaking into a grin as she walks away.  Though FARSCAPE had so much window dressing, the show in the end was really about whether two people have the right chemistry.  Though the show went for four seasons and a miniseries, John and Aeryn's kiss has to stand as one of the half dozen great moments in the history of the show.  From this moment on, it isn't a question of if John and Aeryn will get together, but of how long it will take.  But we all know that if there is one thing that television shows love to do it is to postpone the inevitable.

The other major thing we see in these episodes is that Scorpius has a hold over John that we hadn't previously known.  True, in one episode he had imagined seeing Scorpius on Moya, but in this episode Scorpius explicitly states that John hasn't even begun to understand what he has done to him, and we find that when John attempts to kill Scorpius he is suddenly unable to go through with it.  Then on the final episode of this set, ""Beware of Dog,"" John again sees Scorpius when he knows he can't be there.  These are the beginning intimations of what John would later call Harvey, the inner presence of Scorpius due to the chip he inserted into John's brain when he was in the Aurora chair.

All shows take some time to mature and find their greatness.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (which, by the way, gets a mention in one of the Princess episodes, when John complains that when he awakens after being a statue for 80 years everything he cares about will be dead, even Buffy) was a very good show its first season and for the first third of the second, but in the episode ""Innocence"" became a great show.  Likewise, FARSCAPE was a very good show for its first season and a half, but after the Princess trilogy clearly had achieved greatness.",1129507200,12,7815,4.487649964714185

1704734,5,B00006422R,"This is the first release in the Starburst edition of FARSCAPE and while it is unfortunate that they didn't get it right the first time around in releasing the show on DVD, better late than never. Overwhelmingly the biggest problem with the first DVD releases was cost: unless you were an adult with a considerable amount of disposable income, they were simply too expensive. Although I have long been a huge FARSCAPE fan, the price truly was prohibitive, and as a person with a very wide range of interests, I had trouble justifying spending such a large amount of money for only one television series. Fortunately, the Starburst edition is extremely affordable, and contains all the special features available in the original versions. They are also vastly more convenient. I never could understand releasing only two episodes at a time in bulky packaging, and I'm delighted that this new version will take up about as much room as your average TV boxed set. My only complaint is that the episodes are presented on double-sided discs. It isn't clear to me why they couldn't have been singled sided, though there could well be very good reasons. My hope is that they will eventually put out each season in a single box. Although I will own the entire series by then in the individual releases, it will be easier for newcomers to buy them in that format, and this is a show I very much want to play the evangelist with, converting new fans to the considerable charms of the series.

I have a theory about television in the nineties that involves how TWIN PEAKS, THE X-FILES, and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER revolutionized what was possible in the medium. An addendum to this theory is that FARSCAPE was the first show to exploit the potential that these three shows demonstrated was possible. First, TWIN PEAKS showed that it was possible to produce a non-police procedural that maintained continuity from episode to episode while developing a story arc over a long period of time, while at the same time upping the aesthetic standards for what was possible in television. TWIN PEAKS was truly the first American television series that had many of the same values one could find in feature films. A couple of years later, THE X-FILES continued this level of aesthetic while developing an even more satisfying multi-season narrative arc. TWIN PEAKS great flaw--and it was a serious one--was that instead of resolving narrative details, they instead kept introducing new ones, so that by the end of the second season the story was collapsing by the multiplying of mysteries. THE X-FILES has narrative problems of its own, namely its lack of continuity over the course of the years (e.g., it was often precisely clear who the Cigarette Smoking Man was the father of, what the true fate of Mulder's sister was, or whether there was a true alien colonization program, until things were rather artificially summed up at the end), but it for the most part did a masterful job of telling a magnificent story over the course of nine seasons. But even then the show somewhat got things wrong, for the overarching assumption seemed to be that what we really liked was the stories, while in fact what we really loved was that the stories involved the interaction of Mulder and Scully. But the focus in the series was story first, and character development second. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE STORY was the first show to get everything right. The show told a great overall story as well as great season-long arcs, while throughout it all focusing more on character development than plot.

FARSCAPE is arguably the second show after BUFFY to get the formula right. Although the show has some amazing story arcs, in particular in Season Three, which I think one of the boldest seasons in the history of television, not once did the focus ever slip from the central characters to the story. In the midst of all the puppets and sets and CGI effects and aliens and make up and special effects, FARSCAPE is always more about John, Aeryn, D'Argo, Zhaan, Chianna, and the others than it is about the story in which they are involved. (Homage is paid to BUFFY, by the way, in two explicit references to BUFFY over the four seasons, first when John frets that he may be stuck as a statue for so long that not only his family members but even ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer!"" will be dead and then in Season Four when he asks Scorpio what it takes to stop him, whether silver bullets or ""Buffy!"")

These first of three sets comprising Season One is stuffed to the gills with special features, more than just about any other TV show I know. Special features have never overly impressed me, though I like good ones. Great special features can never atone for a rotten show, but luckily here we get great features for a great show. Every single episode features its own commentary, and I love the way that you really get to know the principle performers through listening to them. This show was not merely a job for them, but a project to which they were completely committed. The number of additional special features truly is staggering. I know of no other TV series to appear on DVD with anywhere near the same level of special features.

But it mainly comes back to price. Finally we have an edition of FARSCAPE that almost anyone can afford. I heartily recommend this series to anyone who enjoys Sci-fi. I concur with those who consider it the finest Sci-fi series ever to appear on TV, but I would hasten to add that this has the potential to appeal to non-Sci-fi fans. For instance, women usually are not regarded as the target group of a Sci-fi series, but FARSCAPE had a massive female fan base. The reason is the way the show focuses on characters and the interplay between the individuals. But the main reason to see the show is that this is one of the rare ones that got everything right, and this despite the fact that it took more chances than just about any other show in the history of TV. Luckily, even when they took chances, things usually paid off.",1125014400,88,6023,4.684608120868744

1704761,2,B00006422R,"I experienced Farscape as a marathon, 2 week journey through 4 seasons worth of DVDs, and the final miniseries on DVD.

At times Farscape was laugh-out-loud funny and cry-out-loud sad. It was true love and true loss. It was passionate and detatched. It was Shakespeare and slapstick, nail-biting and euphoric, smart and bizarre, rage and revenge.

It always maintained the wonder of a child, looking at the world for the first time.

It had a heart

Most importantly, it had a soul.

Unfortunately, ""Farscape - The Peacekeeper Wars"" had almost none of what made the four seasons great. It was 13 to 22 episodes worth of plot and characters (Season 5), compressed into four.

Any time a story is compressed like that, something has to be lost. The producers and writers seem to have chosen to focus on the plot that they had written, rather than accelerate and complete the emotional journey that they had been developing in Season 4.

What we wind up with is a fairly bland trip, with characters reduced to the point of irrelevency. The only part of the miniseries where Farscape's ""soul"" shines through is the last half an hour.

It is impossible to fault the crew. They were given the basically impossible task of wrapping up the cliffhanger ending to the fourth season, along with the series, in only four episodes. My rating is two stars not because it was bad, just because Farscape was so good.

Ultimately, this is a sad, but necessary, end to one of the most evocative shows I have ever loved. It makes me wish I had the 20 million dollars it would have taken to fund a 13 show 5th Season.",1116288000,24,1597,4.614840989399293

1704764,5,B00006422R,"Warning:  Spoilers ahoy!

When FARSCAPE was cancelled after Season Four and one of the great cliffhangers in TV history (John Crichton and Aeryn Sun becoming engaged to marry, but immediately afterwards being turned into a pile of crystallized pellets by a mysterious aircraft that flew over their boat), fans of the show responded with outrage.  Had there not been a renewal of the series, or a mini-series, or even a feature length film to wrap up the loose ends of the series, it would surely have gone down as the least satisfying series finale in history.  The demand was there, especially after the audience for the show actually grew after its cancellation (so much so that in a Summer of 2004 TV Guide poll of the top cult shows of all time, FARSCAPE surprisingly managed a #4 ranking, immediately behind BUFFY, THE X-FILES, and, of course, STAR TREK).  So, when it was announced that there would be a mini-series, FARSCAPE: THE PEACEKEEPER WARS, to wrap up the series, the news was greeted with ecstasy by fans of the show.

So how'd they do?  Overall, pretty well.  Let me start with one of the few negatives:  this is pretty clearly a mini-series into which most of the ideas of what would have been the fifth season was stuffed.  There is through much of it a rushed feeling, as if they had to cover too much narrative in too brief of a time.  This is especially true at the beginning.  In a Season Five, the recreation and reconstitution of Aeryn and John, which took up only the first few minutes of the mini-series, would have been the subject of at least a couple of episodes.  And Aeryn's brief hesitation to marry John in the mini-series would have taken up perhaps half of Season Five.  In other words, the mini-series suffers slightly from a lack of room and the luxury of taking their time in unrolling the narrative.

What THE PEACEKEEPER WARS does not suffer from is a surfeit of ideas.  After all, they are stuffing an entire season's story arc into four hours instead of twenty-two.  As a result, we get a rich, fast-moving, idea-laden epic that manages to resolve all of the major plot lines of the series, while at the same time keeping sufficient openness for feature length film or spin off television series.  I do miss the patient, slowly developing moments (remember the scene from Season Two when John is trying to talk to Aeryn after having narrowly avoided getting married to the princess, Aeryn doing dips on a bench in the background refusing to talk to him, then slowly, silently stopping her exercising, walking slowly to him and holding up the vial that contains the liquid that, when applied to the tip of the tongues, allows two people to know if they are genetically compatible, their applying it to their tongues, then kissing, then the long, long delay followed by Aeryn's turning poker faced around, and then finally a smile breaking out on her face?-this mini-series simply does not have the luxury for an exquisite moment like that).  But these guys are on borrowed time; they have a story to tell, and they tell it quickly and they tell it well.

I won't go into all of the plot details.  I will recount some of the things that I most enjoyed in THE PEACEKEEPER WARS.  I loved the beginning, with a CGI Rygel swimming about the bottom of the lake where we witnessed the demise of John and Aeryn at the end of Season Four.  I had more or less forgotten that Rygel was basically a frog, and seeing the usually immobile creep swimming about so nimbly was a lot of fun.  The scene where the crew is fighting a host of enemies at the same moment that Aeryn is giving birth while continuing to blast away and getting married to John is classic FARSCAPE, taking absolutely everything way over the top.  I loved how Aeryn, the former Nazi storm trooper, had softened, and experienced instant love for an infant she would never been allowed to have had she remained a Peacekeeper.  I loved the final resolution of the Scorpius arc, and even felt a pang of regret when Harvey and John say goodbye for the final time.  I loved Chianna's new look, having gained new eyes after suffering blindness in Season Four.  I loved the fact that she and Ka D'Argo finally managed to patch things up, after she crushed him at the start of Season Three.  Would they have married?  Who knows, but there was clearly a desire on the part of the writers to heal things between them.  I loved Ka D'Argo's death, though I detested the fact that he died.  The almost jocular way he talked with John reflected how far their friendship had come from Season One, when he seemed more likely to kill John than befriend him.  And after having watched John and Aeryn engage in one of the most tortured near-romances in the history of TV for four seasons, it was marvelous to see them together, comfortable with one another, content and unconflicted at finally being a couple, exalting over their new son.  There was a great else besides that was great to enjoy, but these were only a few.

Apart from the rushed aspect of the series and the fact that Ka D'Argo died, there was not a great deal that I didn't like about the series.  There was, however, one.  At the end of Season Four, Sikozu Shanu was not clearly a good or a bad character but had the potential in Season Five (had it taken place) to evolve into either.  In the mini-series she evolves into a completely reprehensible character.  Her treachery was a bit of a shock.  I also had serious problems with her physical appearance.  Raelee Hill, who plays Sikozu Shanu, is a remarkably beautiful woman (most Americans only know what she looks like in make up, but she might be in real life the most attractive of all of the FARSCAPE women).  But the hairstyle and make up they deploy on her in the mini-series was shocking.  Despite having seen Raelee Hill's name in the credits, I seriously wondered whether they had a new actress was playing Sikozu Shanu.  It was a bad, bad look for her.  Perhaps in the course of a full season Sikozu Shanu's treason would have been developed more convincingly, but here it felt implausible and unconvincing.  It was one of the few false notes in an otherwise excellent mini-series.

Now for the big question:  was this up to the extremely high standards set by the series?  Yes and no.  Clearly it was well-conceived, and many of the individual moments were marvelous.  In the end, it is the difference between having 182 minutes with which to work versus over 900 minutes.  As it is, I think it is a wonderful extension of the series as a whole.  I think there is also enough evidence here to indicate that Season Five would have been very good indeed.

Is there a future for FARSCAPE?  Though it labored in relative obscurity during its run on TV, more and more it considered to be one of if not the finest Sci-Fi series that TV has seen.  Star Ben Browder has stated a willing ness to work on either a film project or on a spin off series, though his involvement on STARGATE SG-1 obviously complicates things.  My gut (which admittedly has no connection with the world of reality) tells me that we have probably seen the end of the FARSCAPE saga.  Had they seriously been considering continuing the series in some fashion, I simply cannot imagine them deciding to allow the death of Ka D'Argo.  Mind you, no one would be happier to see Moya and her companions exploring new corners of the universe, but I suspect that this mini-series will be the last we see of the guys.  Nonetheless, I am profoundly grateful that they did this marvelous mini-series not just to wrap up the various story lines of the series, but to allow us to share some final adventures with some characters we had come to love very much.  FARSCAPE is one of my favorite series ever, and I'm delighted that the powers that be allowed it to end so very well.

Finally, I want to praise Hallmark for bringing this mini-series out on such a remarkably affordable disc.  I honestly feel that the full season DVD sets are criminally overpriced (there truly is no hyperbole in that statement).  The outrageous price tags are absolutely not morally justifiable, and I can't conceive that they are economically justifiable, since few can afford them (if FARSCAPE is ever made available on sets that discount to around $38 a set, then this series will experience another leap in popularity).  In fact, THE PEACEKEEPER WARS might be a tad under priced.  We might have been better off if they had put it on an extra disc and added more special features and commentary.  As it is, we have a high quality reproduction of the television mini-series with little or no special features, but with a truly outstanding price.  I just wish each of the four regular seasons were comparably priced.",1109894400,21,8759,4.5933075933075935
1704765,5,B00006422R,"It was so much more than any of us were expecting. As an ardent Save-Farscaper, I was stunned and overjoyed when this amazing franchise was revived for three more hours of mind-blowing entertainment.

There is not a single thing in the mini series that disappointed me. A couple of plot points were more comical (and possibly slightly contrived/ridiculous), but hey, that's Farscape, right? They've had their fair share of wacky.

All in all, I give the mini series 6 out of 5. The only problem I have is that it didn't disappoint me enough to let me down gently. Instead, it has geared me up, ready for the next chapter in the saga! Please, Brian Henson, never give up!

As for this DVD release, I like the idea of combining the two parts into one movie ++ length piece, but it was done at the expense of some picture and sound quality. The extras are good without being spectacular.

However, if you have NOT YET BOUGHT THIS ITEM: Get the Region 2 PK Wars (Available from amazon.co.uk, of course). For those of you who are wondering why, I have two words for you:

DELETED SCENES

But either way, anyone who has ever enjoyed an episode of Farscape needs to put the PK Wars DVD (Region 1 or 2 - and hopefully, soon, 4) first on their shopping list!",1109376000,15,1249,4.456140350877193
1704766,4,B00006422R,"If you are looking for great science fiction that is fun to watch and intelligent, Farscape is a great choice. This is an amazing series with a great deal of humor, action, drama, and (best of all) a story arc. I love the idea of the Human as alien, which has not really been explored in Sci Fi television. The characters are well developed, multi-dimensional, and fun to get to know.  There are plenty of twists and turns to keep one interested. There was enough money put into this series that it looks great from day one and keeps on rolling.

I enjoyed this series when I could find it on the Sci Fi Channel but was not as devoted as others. I have been anxiously waiting for the series to come out on DVD at a reasonable price so that I could buy them, which has finally happened.

The one thing I do not understand is why they are releasing the series using double sided DVDs.  Babylon 5 put out all 5 seasons on 6 single sided DVDs with 4 episode on each DVD and still included commentary and bonus materials for the same price as the entire first season of Farscape Starburst set Season 1.  The way the Starburst DVDs are working out, there will be 6 DVDs but they are double sided.  A bit of an unnecessary pain for viewing since I have to get out and turn over the DVD after two episodes. Call me lazy, but I would prefer not to have to flip the DVD.",1109116800,7,1360,4.1915708812260535
1704787,5,B00006422R,"Farscape surprised me. A lot. When I first saw it the series was well into its second season. I kept hearing about how good it was but never actually sat down to try it. I am glad I eventually did. Farscape (for those of you reading this who don't know) is probably the most diversely written science fiction show I have ever seen. Lots of shows have a certain pacing and feel to them. Even the great shows (like Babylon 5 and Star Trek:TNG) often felt like standardized in the writing style. Not so with Farscape. The show felt like they were shooting from the hip in that respect. I think that's one of the reasons it was such a great show.

Add to that some VERY impressive special effects including incredible CGI scenes, creative makeup effects, and of course the Jim Henson Creature Shop coming up with some of the coolest aliens ever. Of course I cannot forget some fantastic acting by the staff, and that's another reason why this show works so well... the chemistry between the characters (muppet or otherwise).

Now about this Starburst Edition. I was one of the people who balked at the way Farscape was being offered in DVD format. Only a few eps on a disk that cost over $20 at the time and then that monster of a season box always costing more than anything else I have seen. I am sorry for those of you who feel cheated with the ""double dipping"" but I have to agree with some reviewers here in saying this new edition is good for the franchise and good for the fans. Besides you guys do essentially have the same shows we're getting anyway. :-)

From what I'm told the Starburst Edition has the same documentaries as the first printing of the season shows along with some extras. I haven't heard all the commentaries (the one on the premier ep kinda bored me... they were just talking away without really contributing any insightful info) so I cannot really say if they are really good overall or not. I can say the additional interview with Brian Henson (not on the original set) is a treat for those who endured through the ""Save Farscape"" campaign.

The data files on the characters are only marginally informative. I think you can get more info from just watching the eps if you ask me. The trivia bits from each ep however was more entertaining and informative. I think that pretty much covers the extras that weren't already covered from the original releases.

I have heard some people say the Starburst Edition is remastered visually and audio, but I can't seem to notice that much a difference. If you're worried about quality and have the original then just keep what you have and save your money (unless you REALLY want those commentaries and bonus interviews).

All in all I absolutely LOVE this new edition. The price won't break your bank and you get a lot for your money. It looks like I can get an entire season for around $45. Can't beat that. I wish they released all the volumes for the season at once. Like someone else said, that's not the smartest thing to do. Killing your momentum like that.

If you don't have any Farscape DVD's yet then by all means NOW IS YOUR TIME TO GET THEM!!! If you already have the Farscape seasons on DVD then I quess it's your call whether or not the new material and remastering is enough to merit the change.

1704789,5,B00006422R,"This is mostly an echo to previous comments but I'd like to add a review as well.

First of all, Farscape is really a very, very well done show. I was recommended to watch it by a few friends and was very sceptical about sci-fi. I always assumed sci-fi was for... geeks. And it didn't seem like something I could be a fan of. But I finally gave in and I eventually downloaded the first few seasons online. The first few episodes I was sort of iffy about, but as I went on I grew to love the show. It really is amazing and totally unlike (it seems) other sci-fi shows.

I was actually saving up for the first seasons on dvd, but then I came across the Starburst additions. I'm very happy they're making them, even if it is double dipping. I do feel bad for the fans that spent the money on the first ones, but it is good for those of us who could of never really afforded to pay that much. Plus I think re-releasing with a much more affordable price will get more fans as most new fans to a show would never pay that much for something they don't know a whole lot about. But at the price of 12.99$ to 19.00$ it's not such a problem.

So, five stars for both the show and the Starburst Editions!",1107475200,4,1193,4.089743589743589

Farscape is one of the few series where I have found rewatching totally rewarding, and Peacekeeper Wars is no exception.

I can't imagine anything in the genre ever taking it's place (unless they ever finally make a GOOD version of Dune... but even then, it would be stiff competition!)

I loved Peacekeeper Wars - don't get me wrong... but the reviewers praising it as ""perfection"" just doesn't fit what I saw. On the other hand, the reviewers blasting it as awful obviously had their expectations raised to a level where nothing would have been able to fulfill their heart's desires... I'm somewhere in between.

While the show itsself was great, and finally filled that terrible gaping void that was left in my scifi heart when I saw the last Season 4 cliffhanger finale - it was still... an entire Season 5 squished into 4 hours. The writers, as always, did a terrific job in dialog, action, and fun - but they were given the unenviable task of trying to tie up alot of loose ends, and give us what they had originally planned to give us over the span of 22-25 hour episodes.

So, in conclusion - great show. I'm buying it, and I'll watch it over and over, and show as many friends and family as I can get to sit down long enough to see it :) But, as much as I did love it, in the end, there wasn't enough time to end it properly.

Was the mini series a good way to end the show?  Not really, but cosidering the alternate option of... nothing, I guess I shouldnt complain.  The production values are great, and the everything feels like your typical farscape episode.  Nothing changed too much between the last episode and what was made here (except for sikozu's wicked new hair and some insane CGI effects).  4 hours just wasn't enough time to squeeze in all that happens though.  It almost feels like your typical michael bay movie what with the constant battles and an ending that could have been in any big budget studio movie out there.  But what made farscape such a great show is that they took those basic elements of your summer event movies and put in all the intelligence and emotions that 2 hours just can't give you in the theatre.  The mini series became that event movie and in order to give you all the ""money"" scenes, they had to remove all the suspense you would have got in the 5th season.

Within a year Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars started filming and it delivered in spades. It was an entire television season put into 4 hours and it doesn't drag. Would you understand the Peacekeeper wars without having watched the series? Mostly not. Would you be bored watching it? NOPE! This is the most explosive, hands down most fun, mini-series I've ever seen. Its also got probably the funniest moments ever in Farscape history.

The Peacekeeper Wars finishes it all up beautifully. The loose threads were pretty well tied off, and the series ends in a very up-beat way.

If you followed Farscape through, and missed this, you NEED it. If you did not follow it through, there will be many things that do not make sense. However, it is still excellent ...",1102896000,,596,4.613207547169812
1704858,5,B00006422R,"Undoubtadly the most creative show to ever hit cable TV, Farscape was a return to what sci-fi was meant to be.  To say the show's many loyal fans were disappointed when the show was abruptly canceled is an understatement, and it's cliffhanger ending set the stage for this epic mini-series which premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel.  Picking up where the show left off, John (Ben Browder) and Aeryn (Claudia Black) are brought back from the dead after being blasted to bits, and are set to be married with their child well on it's way.  However, Scorpius (Wayne Pygram), the Peacekeepers, and a few others waiting in the wings are going to interrupt the couple's bliss, with the wormhole technology the ultimate prize.  Watching the Peacekeeper Wars is like having an old, beloved friend over for dinner: you enjoy every minute of it, and are sad when your time together is over.  The acting, direction, special effects, and story are nothing short of amazing; making it all to clear that Farscape will be forever missed.  Characters that have been here since the beginning will die, sacrifices will be made, and in the end, freedom will reign throughout the universe.  All in all, this is a satisfying end to Farscape, and fans should definitely consider this a must own.",1102377600,4,1268,4.815668202764977

We waited for so long and finally got it, with an even bigger budget for some of the most spectacular scenes I have ever seen, tv and movies.  Plus the fact that it picked up new fans who had never seen the show is excellent as well.

After the super cliffhanger from season four where John proposes marriage to Aeryn, they are blasted to bits by an unknown alien in a ship.  This starts of with Rygel swimming gethering all the pieces.  They are put togoether (thank god!) by the one who did it, by accident.  There we are met by many of the characters we know and love in an awesome reunion and are launched into an all out war between the Peacekeepers and Scarrans.  Both want John's knowledge of wormholes to make the ultimate weapon.  And let me tell you, oh boy.  What a weapon!

I actually boiught iit for 12.99 and got the first seven eps of season one.  If it continues the same way, i'll get the whole seasons for less than 40 dollars!!!  And let me tell you, This show is wonderful.  Best scifi show ever made.

The special features are great too.  Commentaries by the cast all over the place and documentaries and the such.  It's ep without commercials is 50-51 minutes in length, multiply that by 7 and its well worth 13 bucks, or even 25.

This set spans from John Chritons (human) experiment to use the gravity from earth to launch his module (Farscape I) into space at very swift speeds.  This ends badly when he is hit by a wave of radiation and sucked through a wormhole where he comes upon a battle against the Peacekeepers (intergalactic tyrannical law) and a Leviathan escaped prisoner transport.  Needless to say, he accidentally kills the son of the Peacekeeper leader and joins the prisoners and are on the run.

(The delivery of the baby during a firefight is an absolute gem...)

per the Henson site: ""Watching Farscape is like riding a rollercoaster blindfolded. We don't want you knowing where the curves are, where the big drops are because if you know that, it's not as scary.""

1704864,5,B00006422R,"In all my 28 years, I have rarely seen a movie that I watched 5 times in a row, and still wanted to see it a weeklater, and amonth later.  As people who know mewill tell you, I am NOT easily impressed, and I usually point out all the idiotic flaws in a movie as I watch it.  This movie had  one exceedingly far-fetched scene, but I can forgive that in comparison to the overwhelming power that this miniseries has.  I know I'll want to see it again a year later, 10 years later, or 50 years later, without question.

This miniseries is filled with so much action, so much drama and powerful emotions from such a superb ensamble cast, so much thought-provoking, deeply philosophical questions, with a touch of tasteful romance, humor and tragedy, that watching this movie is like experiencing the full fury of a hurricane!  If you've never seen FarScape before, then DO NOT START HERE!  You likely won't understand most of the references, and when you do see the other episodes, there may be less impact.  On the lower levels, I was sweating, my heart was pounding, I was excited and amazed and entertained like I have not been before.  On the higher levels, I was engaged in thought about philosophical issues, about relationships, about wars and strategies and tactics.  The thirst of my imagination is fully quenched by the Jim Henson Co. effects, which really brings the world alive in an organic sense that simply cannot be achieved with computer graphics alone.  The mini-series/movie was fully satisfying.

The only ""complaint"" I have isn't really a complaint so much as a dull ache in my heart.  I wish it was longer.  But the way it is now, so much happens, that they keep up such a frantic pace for 3 solid hours, that they could have fit it in twice as much time at the regular FarScape pace,which is already 5 times more than the average SciFi episode, and 10-20 times more the average sitcom.  I can't believe they kept up this pace for 3 hours.  Stimulants must have been involved.  ;-)

Of course, let's not forget one of the most important and often overlooked aspect in films: the writer(s).  The writing is superb, which allows for the actors to give such strong performances, and which ties together all of the special effects.

IMO some scenes were so graphic (in a totally non-violent, non-sexual sense), that they pushed the envelope of censorship on (American) TV, because they turned my stomach.  This was a tribute to the special effects and sound!  I am not squeemish in any sense of the word when it comes to movies.  You're talking about someone who will happily eat food and watch a zombie or slasher movie, and never lose my appetite, much less gag or turn my stomach.  Spaghetti, sausage and meatballs go great with an afternoon of watching brains and intestines get flung around and someties devoured.  :p

Unfortunately I can't buy FS: PW now because it's not for sale!  So I have to resort to other distribution channels.  ;-)  I mean, WTF, I would have paid for it after the first 30 minutes if it was available.  :-)  Those F***ING commercials (TV advertisements for those non-American readers) were so annoying when watching a story of this magnitude, pace, depth and breadth!  This wasn't even on Amazon a couple weeks ago (unless I missed it).  I'm surprised it got here this fast!  I'll surely have it in my wishlist and ready to buy as soon as I can afford it!

I would give it 6 stars if they let me, because this one really stands out above and beyond the rest.  For anyone who knows FarScape, even just by watching a few episodes here and there, you know what to expect with plot twists and loose ends.  Expect five times more from this.  ;-)",1101168000,14,3685,4.577981651376147
1704885,5,B00006422R,"Farscape, or Muppets in Space, as I used to call it.  Well, despite being somewhat disinterested in this series over the years, the recent Peace-Keeper Wars mini-series has peaked my interest in this series.  After the abrupt and sudden cancelation of this series, with an unresolved cliff-hanger, I was kind of unwilling to purchase this series on DVD only to have an unfinished series on DVD.  (This is the same reason why I haven't purchased Firefly, and maybe B5: Crusade).  Well, since the series has finally gotten its wrap-up, if you will, I have decided to give this series a try on DVD.

I've seen a few episodes over the years, thought they were interesting, but as fans know, you almost have to catch it from the beginning and all the way through.  So once I stopped watching way back in the first season, I lost track of the show.

Well, this new re-release of the Starburst Editions is a brilliant idea for a couple of reasons.  First we get 7 episodes instead of 4 for about the same SRP.  Plus we get more extras.  How can you beat that?  Second, packaging them this way saves space.  Instead of 5 double-wide keepcases per season, this style of packaging will encompass an entire season in just 3 keepcases.  7 episodes on two, 8 on the other, for a total of 22 episodes per season.  And from what another reviewer said, we also get better transfers and sound quality than the previous releases.

This first volume was released on Nov. 16th, the second one is due on Jan. 18th (same day as the PKW disc) which means expect another release about every two months.  So expect the entire series within about a two year period.",1100995200,57,1639,4.5426621160409555
1704886,5,B00006422R,"Here is a professional review of the Farscape TV Series.  It explains this show better than I can!

. ""Farscape"" remains the best show on TV because it's unpredictable, because actions have consequences and because nothing stays the same from week to week. If a disaster strikes one week, it's not forgotten the next, and the writers have constantly surprised viewers. This is a rare series that puts a single human being in a universe of aliens.

It's literally ""Stranger in A Strange Land"" (though it's unrelated to that Robert Heinlein novel). ""Farscape"" is a metaphor for the alienation that people experience and our efforts to connect with one another despite it.

Ultimately, ""Farscape"" is about whether we can put the community's needs above our own and what we learn when we succeed or fail. And with the brilliant sets, effective aliens, witty dialogue and cool effects, each episode is like a short feature film.""

1704887,5,B00006422R,"Farscape is a very accessible Science Fiction/Fantasy series like no other. Sharp and witty writing plays out in a sometimes irreverent world filled with fantastic multi-layered characters portrayed by enormously talented live and animatronic actors always being thrust into situations that only John Crichton could find himself in--and only the rest of the Moya crew can get out of--together.

Originally broadcast several years ago, I quickly got enamored of Farscape during the recent marathon rerun that lead up to the PK Wars mini-series(that fans helped bring to fruition). I (gasp!) didn't have cable TV back then, or I would have been a fan sooner. Missing out on the 4 seasons it was on the air and watching and enjoying them at the tail end of 2004 just highlights how timeless this show is. A classic.

I'm grateful that the Farscape Starburst Edition is being trickled out for new fans jumping on board. The show is an addictive combination of drama and humor and completing the Farscape Starburst Edition collection is a must.

Single sided discs would have been better, just so they can be loaded up into multi-disc players and no flipping is necessary.

Those who bought the earlier full season sets can surely appreciate the fact that they have immediate access to the entire life of the series--and have been enjoying them for a while now.

Re-releases aren't bad if it helps Farscape gain a new audience that for whatever reason wasn't able to enjoy this gem back then. This show should never have been cancelled, and hopefully this rejuvenated momentum means additional mini-series will be made to extend the legacy.

My main wish for now, though, is that that they put the extra hour of footage that was cut from the TV version into a DVD version.  I especially want to see the deleted scenes between Scorpius and Sikozu after he confronts her about being a spy.  Raelee Hill has said they have a meaningful discussion of their relationship and that it explains her character's actions.

1704920,5,B00006422R,"Between 1999 and 2003, the unique sci-fi television series ""Farscape"" was aired on the Sci-Fi Channel in the U.S.  Filmed in Australia primarily by Jim Henson Productions with assistance from several Australian production companies and some funding from the Sci-Fi Channel, the series developed a strong following and was under contract for a total of five seasons.  However, various funding & political issues forced the premature cancellation of the show following the fourth season (a total of 88 episodes), much to the dismay of loyal fans who (for the most part, including myself) were greatly disappointed by the inconclusive events left in the final minutes of the final fourth-season episode.

However, under the leadership of Jim Henson's (1936-1990) son, Brian Henson (Jim Henson Productions' president & CEO), Jim Henson Productions was able to secure full control over ""Farscape"", allowing it to produce a four-hour mini-series in 2004 to provide a better closure for the existing four seasons than the final events of the final fourth-season episode.  Entitled ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"", the four-hour mini-series was ostensibly equivalent to what the planned fifth season would have been, albeit much shorter, but in no way less wonderful or engaging as the original 88 episodes.  On the contrary, thanks to Brian Henson's efforts (which included directing the mini-series himself), ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"" was a fantastic, engaging and powerful conclusion for one of the best sci-fi television series that has ever been produced.

Seamlessly beginning where the final fourth-season episode ended, all of the cast members from the final fourth season returned in ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"".  This includes the no-nonsense Earth astronaut John Crichton (Ben Browder), his fiance Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black), Ka D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe), Chiana (Gigi Edgley), Rygel XVI (voice of Jonathan Hardy), 'Pilot' (voice of Lani John Tupu), Scorpius/Harvey (Wayne Pygram), Sikozu Shanu (Raelee Hill), Joolushko Tunai Fenta Hovalis (Tammy McIntosh), Stark (Paul Goddard), Utu-Noranti Pralatong (Melissa Jaffer), Skarin Emperor Staleek (Duncan Young), Skarin War Minister Akhna (Francesca Buller), Peacekeeper Commandant Mele-on-Grayza (Rebecca Riggs), Peacekeeper Captain Meeklo Braca (David Franklin), Ka D'Argo's son Jothee (Nathaniel Dean) and wormhole alien dubbed 'Einstein' (John Bach).

With exquisite special effects, superb direction, an engaging & consistent plot and excellent acting, I rate ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and very highly recommend it to all ""Farscape"" fans.  Some of the many memorable scenes in ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"" include Rygel's efforts to help restore John & Aeryn and the subsequent consequences, the various battle scenes both in space and on the ground, John's solution to war, and the birth.  Many thanks go to Brian Henson and the many wonderful actors and film crew that brought ""Farscape"" back to life.  On a side note, Ben Browder has received four Saturn Award nominations from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, of which he won one in 2002 for ""Best Actor in a Television Series"".",1100044800,393,3227,5.5653061224489795

1704922,5,B00006422R,"We all know the drill. JC, astronaut, is shot through a wormhole and joins up with a crew of a ship, a living ship, as they blast through space one season at a time. Along the way they run into multiple baddies, destroy a wide array of bases, depositories, and even a few civilizations, and they also become something of a family. Sometimes that makes for humor, sometimes for seasons of sadness, and sometimes for thrilling adventure.

Such is Farscape.

For those who don't know about the series all that well, it is one of the few I'd tout as a complete product that can't be hyped enough. Following the exploits of John C. and the crew was a thrilling whirlwind to take part in because it evoked so many emotions and rewarded you, the viewer, for riding shotgun through the wormhole. You saw the transitions from character introduction plots and awkward travels to the becoming of crew labelled with words like ""notoriety,"" ""infamy,"" and a message filled with the hope for a better tomorrow. You even had the ""little things"" handed to you, from references to brushing teeth and how alien lifeforms could communicate, and you got it all with an Earth twist. Personally I've never pulled for ""the good guy"" before, not really one to touch base with the cliche characters in most shows, but the crew of Moya was different. They actually touched me with their plights and the ways they could always turn a bad situation into something worse and still come out alive, and I found myself addicted to it by the end of Season Two. That all seemed to come to an abrupt end when the plug was pulled on the series, though, and many people weren't happy with the cliffhanger ending. So, amidst a flurry of protest and the knowledge that Farscape sells, the Peacekeeper Wars was born.

Vaguely commenting, the storyline picks right up where we left off, taking into consideration a few things I didn't think of and setting off a war that everyone watching knew was going to come. You could smell it brewing, the Scarrans threatening too many people and Scorpius standing too close to that end, and when it falls it falls beautifully. I was actually taken by all the digital love the series was shown in this miniseries, shocked in a way by the amount of currency I saw circulating in those lovely ship battles, and I loved it. Added to this is the continuation of the tale of the main characters, with even Rygel getting a little news of home and the promise of things to come. And those these comments have to be vague, I can say with certainty that the storyline flowed and wasn't forced. If you liked the series, you'll love the taste of this brew as well, with all its emotional kicks in tow.

One other thing to note in all of this is that EVERYONE was back and taking part in this epic piece. I'm not talking about the crew and the main biggies, either, but I'm instead filtering through the ""little guys"" and happily noting their faces. Bracca, possibly one of my favorites, is joined by an array of people that take part in the series, again rewarding people that were perhaps wondering where they'd all gone. By and large, it is a complete set of faces to admire (and without that ""guest spot"" taste).

So, in a nutshell, buy this BUT ONLY if you've kept up with the series. If not, it would be akin to reading the final chapter in a book and trying to taste the textures. To those who wanted it, though, it has come and it felt good to have more. By the frelling gods, I'm still pumped up from seeing it.",1099785600,217,3505,4.4960753532182105

Like ""Angel,"" Farscape was cancelled before it's time and is sorely missed. There isn't much in the way of Good Television anymore, especialy genre Television, so we at least got a four hour miniseries to tie up the loose ends.

The miniseries was a gift to the fans who rallied to get the show back after Sci Fi abruptly cancelled it. It's everything you would want in a finale and more. Great story, amazing character moments and a wonderful script.

1704955,5,B00006422R,"With the final episode of the series leaving all of the fans a bit lacking, and the huge amount of campaigning that was done to bring the show back, this miniseries was an answer to all that.

And what an answer it was.

Wrapping up many of the questions left behind after 4 action packed seasons, and bringing back to TV the characters that so many people fell in love with, The Peacekeeper Wars keeps up with the tradition of excellence that fans of the series have grown accustomed to.  The plot line, though condensed considerably(this could have easily have been a Season 5 for the show) it still gives people a sense of closure to the series, but opens up new doors as well.  The writing is excellent and the direction is fantastic, better than anything seen on tv or even in movies in a long time.

As for the acting, everyone did a more than excellent job with their roles, Ben Browder and Claudia Black once again show everyone why they are and always will be the sexiest and funniest, if not actionable, couple ever to be seen on TV.  Wayne Pygram comes across better than ever as the dark anti-hero Scorpius, and also as the bumbling sidekick Harvey who still resides inside John Crichtons mind.  All of the friends that people have made over the past 4 seasons return, and none of them give us a bad performance.

With Peacekeeper Wars you'll laugh, you cry, and you'll cheer, and your heart will break.  It's the best mini-series I've ever seen, and I only hope that we see more of this wonderful show.

1704956,4,B00006422R,"While a most excellent ride, I give this miniseries 4 stars rather than 5 as it doesn't quite match the series' best moments. This is probably due to having to compress the main story from an entire season into a 4 episode miniseries.

Also I felt that Sci-fi channel butchered it a bit, being a bit happy as regards cutting scenes to make room for ads. The feature time on this DVD is listed as 4 hours, whereas the Sci-Fi airing was only 3 hours long after you took out the ads. Hopefully if the DVD specs are accurate, the DVD version should prove far more enjoyable and be worthy of 5 stars.

I'm not sure if I'd recommend this DVD to Farscape virgins. While there is quite a lot of standalone plot and exposition, you don't get to see the characters in all their glory, and Farscape is above all a character driven story. For fans waiting for the resolution of the cliffhanger from the last series and hoping to see tie-ups of loose plot threads, this miniseries delivers. Harvey in particular gets a fantastic farewell scene. And the ""this is your playground"" scene at the end really summed up what the series was about.",1099180800,10,1126,4.461165048543689

Crichton still possesses, locked in his mind, what many believe to be the key to victory: the secret of wormhole technology.  He and his friends enlist the aid of a nearly extinct race of legendary peacemakers to settle the conflict, but, cornered and desperate to save his new family, Crichton will ultimately be forced to produce the weapon that everyone has been clamoring for.  However, is it what they expect?

One of the best TV series ever finally gets the send-off it deserves.  With the exception of a couple particularly implausible moments, this is classic, top-notch Farscape all the way.  I understand that the Sci-Fi Channel got great ratings for this mini-series, with the second night surpassing the first.  Here's hoping for more Farscape.  As The X-Files demonstrated in its final seasons, the pressures and responsibilities of parenting don't mesh well with a weekly adventure series, but more mini-series events would be very welcome indeed./",1099180800,14,1230,5.1457286432160805
1704958,5,B00006422R,"""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"" ties up the loose ends from the series including the cliffhanger from season four. Crichton and Aeryn aren't dead after all and are restored through the hard effort of D'Argo and the rest of the crew from Moya. There's one problem; The Scarrans and the Peacekeepers are both headed to the planet where the crew have taken refuge.

Scorpious still wants his Holy Grail--wormhole technology that can be used to build a massive weapon against the Scarrans. Unfortunately, the Scarrans want the same thing. Crichton has no choice but to do something he never wanted to do in the first place--build the weapon but who will he give it to?

With top notch production values, a great script by Rockne O'Bannon and David Kemper, sharp direction by Brian Henson and great performances from the returning regulars, ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" manages to close ""Farscape"" on a grand scale never imagined before. Unfortunately, the four hour TV movie must compact a story arc that was original designed to occur over a much longer period of time. It doesn't detract from the drama but there's many additional dramatic options that can't be explored because of the limited time frame.

I have to applaud the Sci-Fi Channel for airing the conclusion but still can't believe the idiocy of their decision to cancel one of the best most provocative series on TV. While the channel did a great job with the Dune films, they really blew it with ""Farscape"". At least fans finally got their conclusion. If not for us fans, this would never have been produced (Sci-Fi Channel certainly wouldn't have done it on their own).

The first disc includes the three hour moviein its entirety. The second disc features all the extras including a 30 minute documentary about the making of ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" which discusses the cancellation and conclusion of the series nearly two years after the last episode (a cliffhanger)aired. There's also a conceptual art gallery featuring designs for the ships, alien landscapes and costumes for the grand finale. There's also a section of storyboards from key sequences in the film (including the opening, harpooning sequence among others).

1704962,5,B00006422R,"With ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"" premiering on the Sci-Fi Channel on October 17th my timing was pretty good for finishing the fourth and final season of ""Farscape"" on DVD.  After seeing John Crichton (Ben Browder) and Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black) in the trailer talking about ""unfinished business,"" the 5th and final collection for Season 4 explains exactly what they are talking about (in fact, that clip comes from the series final first run episode).

But before the cliffhanger finale we have the three-part ""We're So Screwed,"" which begins with Moya's crew attempting to rescue the pregnant Aeryn from the Scarrans and then escalates into something bigger and better.  Episode 19, ""Part 1: Fetal Attraction"" (Written by David Peckinpah, Aired February 28, 2003) has Scorpius playing the front man in the rescue attempt at a Scarran Border Station when the ship holding Aeryn is docked.  Rygel pretends to have the deadly disease Hynerian dermapholiica, forcing the station's medical officer to order a lockdown.  But when the pretense is about to be broken, Utu-Noranti Pralatong makes the disease real, which is another threat to Aeryn and her fetus.  So Jenek decides to transplant the fetus into Chiana, who is immune to the disease because she is a Nebari.  This is not exactly the sort of complication we need this close to the end.

Episode 20, ""Part 2: Hot to Katratzi"" (Written by Carleton Eastlake, Aired March 7, 2003) has Moya's crew heading for the secret Scarran base because when they rescued Aeryn they ended up leaving Scorpius behind and he has all that wormhole information in his head.  As if that were not enough of a problem when they get to Katratzi they find Commandant Grayza in the middle of peace negotiations with Staleek, the Scarran Emperor.  Crichton shows up and declares he has come to sell knowledge of the wormhole to the highest bidder and that he is wearing a nuclear bomb that will explode if he gets hurt or worse.  Meanwhile, his crewmates are trying to save Scorpius, or kill him, before he breaks.  Exciting, huh?

Episode 21, ""Part 3: La Bomba"" (Written by Mark Saraceni, Aired March 14, 2003), reveals there are plans within plans within plans.  Crichton has rescued Scorpius only to be betrayed, but Scorpy is not really after Crichton.  He wants to use the wormhole knowledge to destroy the Scarrans and their invasion fleet, while Crichton is still walking around with a nuclear bomb that could come in handy at the right moment.  I was reminded of the second season of ""24"" by this episode in that if you are going to make a nuclear bomb a big part of the plotline then you should not cheat and avoid having the thing go boom.  There are some wonderful character moments in this one when the crew think they are once again facing death.

The final episode is entitled ""Bad Timing"" (Written by David Kemper, Aired March 21, 2003) not only because it takes a shot at the Science Fiction channel for canceling its signature series when clearly there was a fifth season's worth of stories needed to resolve everything, but because the usual Farscape bad luck applies to Crichton and Aeryn when they finally try to sit down and have a quiet little moment where they can deal with their relationship.  Of course there are other problems.  Moya's crew learns that Scorpius is working with Captain Braca, so they strand Scorpy and Sikozu in deep space so they can go back with Braca.  Then there is the fact that the Scarrans are about to send their invasion fleet through a wormhole to Earth and the only hope for Crichton to collapse the wormhole and save his home planet is if his module is flown by Pilot.

""Bad Timing"" could have served as the ultimate ""fini"" for ""Farscape"" given the Earth invasion plotline and a final scene between Crichton and his father, but then the very last scene gives us another ""Farscape"" cliffhanger at Crichton and Aeryn's expense.  If I did not know we are getting a mini-series to continue the story next month then I would have been as outraged and agitated as all the other ""Farscape"" fans who suffered through the shock of cancellation.  The four episodes on this final DVD really do focus on the Crichton-Aeryn-Scopius (fill in the blank) triangle, with everybody else left pretty much in the background (although Pilot gets a big moment for once).  While ""Farscape"" did not have the master five-year plan of ""Babylon 5"" it certainly did have a sense of progression through each year, something the original ""Star Trek"" could not claim.  This series should still be the crown jewel of the Sci Fi Channel.  ""Stargate SG-1"" is a superb series, but you need lots of flashy aliens in a galaxy far, far away to be your signature show.",1094083200,18,4716,4.775862068965517

1704974,5,B00006422R,"I will admit that I didn't watch this show until the sixth or seventh episode when both my brother and boyfriend insisted that I watch.  As a die hard Babylon 5 fan, I thought nothing would engage me in the way B5 did. I was wrong.  In the four years that Farscape ran, we saw these characters grow and change and become the crew of Moya, as well as a family.  we cared about them and understood them. It was serialized, as was Babylon 5, which is why it was so good.  Situations triggered future events, and gave it a sense of continuity.  These last few episodes show how much they changed.  At first all John wanted to do was go home, but made the ultimate sacrifice in the end to save his planet and both Peacekeepers and Scarrens.

If you want something that is just standalone episodes, go watch Outer Limits. Serialization works because it brings the viewer into the storyline, even the latest Star Trek has become more serialized.",1092355200,7,938,4.450292397660819
1704975,2,B00006422R,"I watched it in the beginning and enjoyed a few episodes, but it just got weirder and WEIRDER. Nowadays, I can't even watch it because I would have had to see every other episode to understand what the hell is going on. No stand-alone stories at all, but just seemingly, bad ones. I buy them all (as an archivist) even though I have basically stopped watching them. But I watched these recently, and again was dissappointed. There is just nothing here for me. As a reference, DS-9 is my all-time favorite show, followed by the tragic ""Firefly"", and of course, good ole TNG never failed. I like SG-1, we'll see about ""SG-Atlantis"", it seems a little stupid so far (but I said that about Deep-Space in the beginning too). Farscape isn't worth anything these days and I'm glad they're canning it. It's stupid, there aren't super cool space scenes anymore (or much less -too costly I'm sure), the stories seem so bland, I have no idea what Scorpious is doing there, none of it makes sense to a casual observer. That's unfortunately, why I think it has failed. Sorry fans, don't hate.",1092268800,5,1079,4.625
1704976,4,B00006422R,"The end game for the fourth and final season of ""Farscape"" emerges in the four episodes on this DVD as Crichton and Moya's crew learn that one of their members has to be rescued. The four episodes here pair up, with the first two dividing the crew by gender and giving each an opportunity to get away by Moya for what is supposed to be fun but ends up being much more serious. The second two establish a new and surprising relationship between Crichton and Scorpius:

 Episode 415, ""Mental as Anything"" (Written by Mark Saraceni, Aired January 31, 2003) finds Scorpius taking the boys to a training camp to learn a little mental discipline from Katoya. However, they discover that also there for the training is Macton, the Peacekeeper who murdered D'Argo's wife, Lo'lann, and then framed him for the killings. Of course, D'Argo wants to kill Macton but there are doubts about what happens and we are treated to a series of flashbacks about what may or may not have happened. Providing closure like this for D'Argo is certainly an indication that the end of the show is in sight.

 Episode 416, ""Bringing Home the Bacon"" (Written by Carleton Eastlake, Aired February 7, 2003) gives the women of Moya their time away when they visit a space station in order to get a camouflage device for Moya. Their surprise is that they also discover a secret meeting between Commandant Grayza and the Scarrans. With the threat of a Scarran Dreadnaught on their tales, Moya's crew needs to discover the beacon on board their ship, which leads to another great ""Farscape"" shock.

 Episode 417, ""A Constellation of Doubt"" (Written by David Kemper, Aired February 14, 2003) begins the search for Aeryn while Crichton is watching a videotape of an expose from Earth television about the alien crew's visit. This episode was filmed after the cast found out ""Farscape"" had been cancelled by the Sci Fi Channel and it adds a certain poignancy to the performances. Fans are either going to love this episode or find it an unwarranted digression, but I like the issues raised by the faux documentary, which does a good job of covering the range of responses humans would have to the aliens while giving Moya's crew their own chances to comment on the ways of Earth. It was nice to see the usual paranoia and delusions of supremacy of Earthlings is confronted with the prospect of advanced alien technology showing up in sub-orbital space.

 Episode 418, ""Prayer"" (Written by Justin Monjo, Aired February 21, 2003) reveals that Aeryn is on a ship on its way to the Scarrans secret base at Katratzi, where she is being interrogated by Jenek, a Scarran of the Ruling Order. Meanwhile Crichton and Scorpius make a return trip to the alternative reality of ""Unrealized Reality"" to try and discover Katratzi's location so they can rescue Aeryn. But the chief part of this episode is that Aeryn is being tortured and her baby is being used against her, because we know that even bound to a gurney you do not bet against Aeryn.

 At this point we have reason to believe that all of the elements for the endgame of the fourth season are in place. Crichton has a purpose and being allied with Scorpius is going to make things pretty interesting. I pity the Scarrens when Moya catches up with them, but I also am not stupid enough to predict a happy ending for this series and its characters.",1091145600,8,3357,4.6938775510204085
1704977,5,B00006422R,"On ""Farscape: Season 4, Collection 3"" we get to a point in the series where the show could have jumped the shark. After all, in the very first episode Commander John Crichton, out testing his new acceleration theory, is flung through a wormhole into a galaxy that is really far, far away, and for three-and-a-half seasons while dealing with Crais, Scorpius, and all the other problems (not to mention his crewmates on Moya) Crichton has been trying to find his way home. Well, on this DVD, we get to the episodes where he finds himself back home. Fortunately, the results are what fans of the series would hope for and, as we have come to expect, the proverbial much more.

 Episode 411, ""Unrealized Realities"" (Written by David Kemper, Aired August 23, 2002) sets the stage by having Crichton sucked through a wormhole where he gets interrogated by a being who has a connection to the Ancients. On the one hand we have semi-deep philosophical discussions about the nature of time and alternative realities, while on the other this is another episode where the ""Farscape"" cast get to play each other. These fit together because they are teaching Crichton the rules by which the wormholes operate, and this makes many things possible. So this episode not only stands on its own but at the end Crichton is floating above Earth.

 Episode 412, ""Kansas"" (Written by Justin Monjo, Air Date January 10, 2003) starts with Moya joining Crichton above Earth. The good news is Crichton is home, but the bad news is that he is fifteen years in the past and his father is about to commander the space shuttle Challenger on its ill-fated final voyage. The solution to this is for the aliens to hide out in an abandoned house while they try to fix the past. This means kidnapping the young John Crichton, in whom Chiani takes a helpful interest, and learning English so that they can explain things to the local cops. Then we get to the end and things get really interesting.

 Episode 413, ""Terra Firma"" (Written by Richard Manning, January 17, 2003) has Crichton finding out that the Earth has changed about as much as he has since he left. The show wisely takes 9/11 into account in the ways in which Crichton's family, friends, and government react to his return and his shipmates. But then there is also the Skreeth that Grayza has sent after Crichton and how our hero is bumping heads with his father over how the alien technology should be shared with Earth. I really wish this one should have been a two-parter or the start of more of a minor story arc.

 Episode 414, ""Twice Shy"" (Written by David Peckinpah, Aired January 24, 2003) is a letdown in comparison to the high drama of the other episodes. You have to get to the next disc and ""A Constellation of Doubt,"" which is the ideal episode to complete the Earth quartet. Chiana insists that Talikaa, a slave girl they encounter on a planet where they are making a trade, be bought and brought on Moya. This turns out to be a bad thing and a rather ordinary ""Farscape"" episode, although the setup for the next big twist in the story of John and Aeryn comes at the end of this one.

 Of course, we know that ""Farscape"" is going to get cancelled during the fourth season, which is rather infuriating when you see how the series is uping the ante at this point. Lots of things are falling into place for the finale story arc and you just want to enjoy the ride for as long as it lasts. You also want to make sure you are all caught up on ""Farscape"" before the mini-series on the Sci Fi Channel comes out this fall.",1090972800,5,3558,4.536661466458658

So they dumped the best show they ever had in favor of Crap. SG-1 (namely) is garbage compared to Farscape. As far as the Sci-fi channel goes I do not watch it anymore except when the Peace Keeper Wars comes out. I have every single DVD of Farscape. It is a well-acted Fresh show with excellent dialogue, hip and funny. And when they found out the show was being canned did they let up?

Farscape has been so far the only show that has made me say DAAAAMMMMNNNN at the end of a season",1090886400,14,1181,4.184210526315789
1704979,4,B00006422R,"I didn't see the show during it's initial run but have caught up and fallen in love with this show through DVD. I am hoping others can discover the show the same way I did.

I think of the show as Sci Fi with an edge that never plays it safe. Mix in some humor, some wonderful characters and some amazing writing and you got something richer than even Trek has been able to do recently.

The last season was a mixed bag but gets better as the season progresses. I don't think anyone won't be shocked by the ending cliffhanger which is one of the best of this series or any other show in comparison.

1704980,5,B00006422R,"How to star my review. Well lets get AdvFilms release of the dvds out of the way. While there releases have been great the only reason they get five stars is because of the show. Advs dvds for farscape have been lacking, while you get the episodes uncut and with a little added footage the extras are laughable, but at least a little is better than none.
  Season 1 - Well season 1 is the start of something great. We get character developement story lines that confound the imagination. The main storyline of season 1 is that Captain Crais is desperatly hunting the Moya crew to get at John. At the conclusion of the season Crais becomes that which he has been hunting, a fugitive from the new Peacekeeper villian Scorpious.
  Season 2 - This season we get more into relationships between crew members. John & Aeryn as well as Dargo & Chiana. Scorpious is after John now for a diffrent reason than Crais was, he wants him for th wormhole tech in Johns head. At the end of the season is were John risks it all in order to save Aeryn.
  Season 3 - Starts off great, but in my opinion the two Johns and splitting the crew between Moya and Talan made this season a little less perfect than the rest. Although it had some really great episodes this season.
  Season 4 - The greatest season of farscape. This season John returns to earth, He has greater control of wormhole tech, Aeryn is pregnant, John & Aeryn get engadged to be wed. The only bad thing that came out of this season was its cancellation after filming of the season concluded.
  Farscape Peacekeeper Wars - The savefarscape campain has worked. With the help of loyal fans there will be a continuing story. From what I have read this miniseries will tie up alot of the current loose ends but leave new loose ends. Hopefully if the fans of the show can get it good enuff ratings then maybe scifi channell will either order a new complete season like they did for that crappy show Battlestar Gallactica. If not a new complete season maybe a half season or even more miniseries. LETS HOPE FOR BIG RATINGS SO THE FARSCAPE STORY CAN CONTINUE ON!!!
Well this concludes my first an to this date only review. I am sorry I couldn't be more discriptive on the seasons but there is just to much to cover and I am only aloud 1000 words. Tune in October 17, 2004 for the miniseries.",1089936000,10,2330,4.410256410256411
1704981,4,B00006422R,"This is the start of the fourth and final season of ""Farscape,"" and with this first five episodes Moya's crew reassembles and John Crichton gets some good news and bad news by the end of this 2-DVD set. As always you will find some fan friendly extras along with the episodes:
Episode 401, ""Crichton Kicks"" (Written by David Kemper, Aired June 7, 2002) starts off the season back in the Uncharted Territories with a bearded Crichton reunited with Chiana and Rygel aboard the decaying Leviathan Elack.  A group of Grudek mercenaries intent on harvesting the Leviathan's rare neural tissue mercenaries show up and have to be stopped.  Moya's crew is not back together by the end of this one, but at least Crichton shakes off the cobwebs and starts getting acclimated to the idea that Aeryn is out there somewhere carrying his baby...or is she?
Episode 402, ""What Was Lost, Part 1: Sacrifice"" (Written by Justin Monjo, Aired June 14, 2002) has more of Moya's crew showing up on a planet where Interion scientists are conducting an archeological dig.  Then Commandant Grayza shows up and uses a sensual spell to try and get to Crichton's secrets and the Old Woman, convinced Crichton will crack, figures killing him would be a good thing.  Fortunately they put the second part on the same disc here as the story continues.
Episode 403, ""What Was Lost, Part 2: Resurrection"" (Written by Justin Monjo, Aired June 21, 2002) has the Farscape gang trying to stop the Peacekeepers on Arnessk from recovering an alien weapon of mass destruction while Crichton tries to resist Grayza's sensual assault.  D'Argo and Jool have a plan, but you know how well those things work out.  Fortunately, the dying Leviathan Elack makes for one heck of a trump card and it looks like maybe Crichton will not have Scorpius to kick around any longer (yeah, right, but Moya does lose a crewmember).
Episode 404, ""Lava's a Many Splendored Thing"" (Written by Michael Miller, Aired June 28, 2002) has the crew still searching for Moya but being forced to make an emergency landing on a desolate planet.  There Tarkan freedom fighters capture Rygel inside a cavern filled with lava after Sparky's love for shiny objects gets him in a stick situation once again.  Chiana and Sikozu become the new bickering couple for the series but manage to avoid coming to blows for the time being.  This is a comic relief episode that, for many reasons, strikes me as a tongue in cheek homage to the original ""Star Trek.""  But I am probably reading too much into it.
Episode 405, ""Promises"" (Written by Richard Manning, Aired July 12, 2002) starts off with good news and bad news.  The good news is that Moya is finally reunied with her crew and Crichton gets to see Aeryn.  The bad news is that she is in the company of Scorpius (you thought he was gone for good?) and in the throes of Heat Delirium.  To prove his good intentions, Scorpius finally removes ""Harvey,"" his neural clone, from Crichton's mind.  Then a giant Lukythian Ship rockets up to Moya, preventing starburst, and its captain accuses Aeryn of being part of team of assassins who killed the Prime Lukythian.  The Lukythians infected her with Heat Delirium and will provide an antidote in exchange for the names of those who ordered the hit.  If this was not enough fun, Grayza has a prototype Peacekeeper missile for killing a Leviathan.",1089849600,3,3359,4.76551724137931
1704982,5,B00006422R,"Season 4 of Farscape has some of the best episodes of the entire 4 season run.  One of the greatest SciFi shows of my time, and it was cancelled.  The SciFi Channel cancelled Farscape because of its inability to grow outside its fanbase and that the show was becoming to expensive.  I believe it was that latter that heralded the downfall of Farscape, because as Internet sites proclaim Farscapes fanbase has grow and continues to grow.
The episodes of this collection are the final 4 of the series.  Like all the season before it, Farscape leaves you with a cliffhanger ending to end all.
With great dialogue, excellent actors, superb writting, and a take on outerspace that was unique to itself, its a wonder why the show was cancelled.
If you like Andromeda, or Star Trek, you should check out this show.  You will love it.

(I initially thought What The... but a friend sent me the first couple of discs of Season 1 - from then I was hooked)

1705018,5,B00006422R,"I've been watching Farscape since it began and it's one of the best secrets on TV!This DVD collection answers some of the questions and resolves some of the issues in true Farscape fashion.  In ""Unrealized Realities"", Critchon learns how dangerous his wormhole travelling can be, as well as ends up back at Earth.  The situation escalates in ""Kansas"" where Critchon and the crew must deal with the ramifications of his wormhole travel. ""Terra Firma"" is probably the best of the 4.  It has elements of previous episodes ""A Human Reaction"" and ""Dog with 2 Bones"".  Finally on Earth, Critchon has to reconcile his former life with the life he has now and realizes the old saying is true: you can never go home again.
Tensions between Aeryn Soon and Critchon are resolved in the mercurial ""Twice Shy"" as we find out the truth behind Critchon's actions and it's outcome.
At the end of the 4th season, it was disappointing that we may never see the resolution to many subplots that have been developing for 3 years.  It's one of the few shows that can't actually be judged in any category, it's so good. Even better that the loose ends are rumored to be taken care of in the 4 hour miniseries Farscape: Peacekeeper War.

1705020,4,B00006422R,"After a good half season, things really take off in this collection of episodes from the show's fourth season.  The first episode, ""Unrealized Reality"", starts it all off with our hero John Crichton getting taught about the true danger involved with his knowledge of wormholes, along with a rather shocking conclusion.  One great kick of this episode (especially for the hard-core fans)is the cast's appearances as different crew members throughout the episode.  The next two episodes, ""Kansas"" and ""Terra Firma"" are as good, if not among the show's very best.  Even the ""ship in a bottle"" episode ""Twice Shy"" is pretty good.  For a show that was about to be cancelled, you wouldn't be able to say it was on account of quality.  Highly recommended.",1080864000,2,748,4.944

1705047,5,B00006422R,"Farscape Season 4 got off to an incredibly rocky start with mediocre episodes like ""Crichton Kicks"" and ""What Was Lost"" Parts 1 and 2.  With the exceptions of ""Promises"" and ""I Shrink, Therefore I Am"", the rest of Season 4 up to this point was less than satisfying.  But with the episodes on this DVD edition, Season 4 finally gets interesting, and delivers some of the most intriguing, intellectually stimulating, and emotionally charged episodes of Farscape ever.
""Unrealized Reality"" is a hard episode to wrap one's brain around, especially since Farscape does not normally go in for much techno-babble like other science fiction shows.  But there is a firm purpose behind it. The wormhole alien Crichton communicates with is trying to show the dangers of wormholes and how they can travel to not just different places in space, but different realities.  Altering those realities can have drastic consequences.  This episode really brings the whole wormhole arc running through the series to a full explanation, and is an important predecessor to the next episode.
""Kansas"" sees Crichton and company pop out of a wormhole over Earth, but the year is 1985.  Warned by the wormhole alien that his mear presence in that time might change things, Crichton and his friends travel down to Earth to find out if things have been changed.  To his horror, Crichton finds that his Father is now set to be aboard the ill-fated shuttle Challenger, and must change things so he doesn't go.  The dramatic essence of this episode focuses on Crichton, with his attempt to change things back to how they should be, along with his confrontation with his former self and his late-Mother.  The comedic elements focus on how Crichton's friends encounter Earth and its customs for the first time, such as what they think the middle finger means and the correct use of the term ""bite me.""
""Terra Firma"" has Crichton and crew return to Earth, but its Earth of the present.  Crichton is welcomed home as a hero, but his alien comrades are subjects of freak-show style fascination and suspiscion.  Crichton also finds that things are not the same as they were when he left Earth, as the writers brilliantly incorporate the aftermath of September 11 and how it has affected the points of view of the people Crichton left behind.  Aeryn also gets to meet Crichton's family, while trying to find a way to win back Crichton's trust and find out if he still loves her.  This episodes is an important one in Farscape's history because Crichton finally finds his way home, thus bringing an arc that has been present from the show's premiere to the forefront.
""Twice Shy"" is a standard action-adventure episode, but is done quite well and the alien attacker is well developed and genuinely creepy.  Behind the action is emotional turmoil as Crichton and Aeryn finally begin to confront where they are, and what is REALLY holding them back.
All in all, a great DVD edition to Farscape.",1079740800,5,2952,4.8662674650698605

Revenging Angel is easily one of my favourites on the dvd.  Funniest episode of anything I have seen in a while.  While on death's door and in a coma, John creates a Looney Tune type world to cope.  With John as the Road Runner and D'argo as Wile E Coyote, this episode will be sure to keep you laughing for a while.  Amazingly, this extremely light and humerous episode is followed by one of the darkest and serious episodes in the show, let alone the season.  Yet despite the change in tone from Revenging Angel to The Choice, the plot fits easily and smoothly and was well thought out.

1705053,4,B00006422R,"Well, as this final season of ""Farscape"" is brought to DVD, a few changes come along with it.  The most obvious is the widescreen presentation of the episodes, but the other noteworthy change is (unlike the show's previous gloom-and-doom season premieres) some much-needed laughs after several emotionally tough and dramatic episodes.  Our hero john Crichton was left alone at the end of the previous season, but when we see him again, he has managed to find a dying Leviathan to call home and find time to study his knowledge of wormholes (while growing a Jim Morrison-esque mane to boot).  But, things can be quiet in the world of ""Farscape"" for so long before circumstances drag him out of exile and into reunions with his old friends.  But the biggest shock of all is the one person John Crichton distrusts more than anyone may need Crichton's help to survive.  While the first five episodes in this set bring our band of misfits back together, it also sets up a tense atmosphere that plays out rather well throughout the season.  Mind you, the REALLY GOOD stuff of season four isn't on DVD yet, but the epsiodes, including the two parter ""What Was Lost"" and the dramatic reunion of John and his love Aeryn in ""Promises"" manages to keep things interesting.

Parents: there are issues of a mature nature brought up in ""What Was Lost"" Parts One and Two that might not be suitable for younger children.

The previous three seasons of Farscape on DVD have looked fantastic for the most part, but these discs suffer from severe compression artifacts.  I don't know what ADV has done differently, but unfortunately it really shows.  In some scenes the compression is so great that the entire frame ""refreshes"" only at half-second intervals, giving the whole picture a sort of stop-action appearance.  Look at Disc 2, ""Lava's a Many Splendored Thing"", at disc time 34:58-35:01.  The clouds in the background just jerk across the scene.  And at 36:15-36:20, where Scorpy and John are talking, the entire frame just jerks forward at those same half-second steps.  What puzzles me is that excerpts from these same shows in the Special Features (Behind the Scenes with Rebecca Riggs) appear with much greater clarity, color, and realism, and without compression artifacts.

1705086,5,B00006422R,"From the start, Farscape has been an amazing show, far better than anything else on T.V. It's dark tone and mixture of science fiction and fantasy, coupled with alien characters who, at times seem more human than many of us make this an engaging space opera. Now that the DVD collections have reached the fourth season, I find myself becoming wistful again.
The fourth season, particularly these five episodes attempted to completely reintroduce the main characters to a completely new audience without alienating it's core viewers. A daunting task, but Farscape pulls it off (regardless of what the ratings may have said). Season four continues the show's trend of improving, and not underestimating it's audience.
Bottom line: If you're a science fiction fan, than you have to at least check out Farscape. If, like me, you're a longtime fan, than this set is a must. It completely sets the tone for season four, which became one of the most cerebral and surreal of the series four year run.

1705089,5,B00006422R,"Sweet: I'm stoked to see the first 5 eps (an ingenious move) of the 4th season are included...read on for details.
Bitter: this is the first set of the last season before Farscape's forced hiatus[].
If you're new to the series, don't be intimidated by ""4th season"" listed on the cover. The block of episodes included was designed to introduce new viewers to the characters & the uniquely skewed world of Farscape.
The 3rd season ended (as those who've been following the series...via TV or DVD's...already know) with the group having parted ways...some voluntarily, others not, & one in quite a predicament (okay, it's obviously Crichton, who can find trouble staring out a window daydreaming). This set is the 5-part premiere showing how Moya's crew regroups. It begins with Crichton's space age/mad scientist bachelor life style (""Crichton Kicks""), and leads to Aeryn's (& Scopious'?!) arrival on Moya (""Promises""). In between the rest of the crew show up, new characters are introduced & the villains restart their pursuit with renewed vigor.
Farscape often has a feel of watching a great movie as opposed to a TV show, and the 4th season is no different...better at it actually. The fact that this DVD, as well as the previous DVD sets, play through all eps on a disc only adds to this feeling. It sucks you in with it's characterizations, drama, action, & humor w/o commercial interruptions or delays between the episodes. I am certain long time viewers who were frustrated with the Aeryn being MIA when the episodes originally aired (it took 5 weeks to get the same story on this set), will gain a new perspective & appreciation of this storyline while watching them back-to-back. Farscape is always more enjoyable when watching episodes in groups.
I personally can't wait to get my hands on this set, & especially the sets including the 2nd half of the 4th seasons, which contain some of the best TV I ever seen.
Enjoy!!!",1068768000,31,1928,4.8810975609756095
1705090,5,B00006422R,"The major themes of Season 3 of ""Farscape"" were that of separation and death, which is amply proven by the episodes on this pair of DVDs that provide a resolution to the two Crichton story arc and finally brings Moya and Talyn back together:

Episode 14, ""Infinite Possibilities Part 1: Daedalus Demands"" (Written by Carleton Eastlake, Aired July 27, 2001) has the Ancient who shows up as Jack, Crichton's father, shows up on Talyn to accuse John of giving his wormhole information to the Charrids, who are allied with the Scarrans (i.e., as bad, but not quite as powerful).  Crichton connects the dots and knows that it has to be Furlow, the mechanic we met earlier, who studied his module and must have pieces together enough to duplicate the technology.  As Crichton tires to access the infromation in his brain by getting past ""Harvey,"" the remnant of Scorpius, things get progressively worse in this episode, which is why it is ""to be continued.""  (4 Wormholes)

Episode 15, ""Infinite Possibilities Part 2: Icarus Abides"" (Written by Carleton Eastlake, Aired August 3, 2001) does offer some good news as Crichton is finally free of the Scorpius clone and unlock the wormhole technology in his mind.  Unfortunately that Scarran dreadnought is still on its way and Crichton has to work with the Ancient, who looks like his father Jack, work on a weapon that can defend them.  Unfortunately Furlow is still trying to take every side involved for everything she can and the price of survival this time around is as high as it has ever been.  (5 Wormholes)

Episode 16, ""Revenging Angel"" (Written by David Kemper, Aired August 10, 2001) is in the running for the funniest ""Farscape"" episode ever.  Crichton and D'Argo have another one of their stupid fights, but this time John ends up in a coma.  Meanwhile, just to make things fun, a strange ship is bent on destroying Moya.  However, this is nothing compared to what is happened in Crichton's mind, where the Scorpius clone is trying to convince him to take revenge against D'Argo.  That does not sound like much, but I should mention that these flights of fancy are animated in the grand style of Chuck Jones cartoons; i.e., think Coyote and Roadrunner lost in space.  After the end of the previous episode, this is a welcome bit of comic relief before we continue the downward spiral.  (5 Wormholes)

Episode 17, ""The Choice"" (Written by Justin Monjo, Aired August 17, 2001) has the grieving Aeryn traveling to a planet of mystics, seers, and frauds to try and contact Crichton.  However, once there she learns she can make contact with someone who could be her father.  There is some question as to whether or not this is really Talyn Lyczac, but there is no doubt that lurking in the shadows is Xhalax Sun, Aeryn's mother (who we though Crais had killed earlier in the season).  So much for the idea that your parents can provide conflict when the man you love dies.  (4 Wormholes)

Episode 18, ""Fractures"" (Rockne S. O'Bannon, Aired August 24, 2001) shows that the long awaited reunion between the divided crews on Moya and Tayln is not going to be any bed of roses.  But first Moya's crew encounters a trio of escapees from Peacekeeper prisons: a Nebari, a Scarran and a female.  This proves to be another one of Season 3's ""road not taken"" episodes since we see parts of the ""Farscape"" crew refracted in these visitors.  However, all that really matters is that Aeryn and the other Crichton get to see each other again.  (5 Wormholes)

You have to be impressed with any television series that manages to kill off half of the original characters halfway through a season, especially when most of those characters actually stay head.  Especially when each of those deaths is made especially meaningful.  Traditionally one of the great kisses of death (a.k.a. as ""jumping the shark"") for a series is when the male and female leads, who have been resisting get together, finally get together and the entire dynamic of the show changes.  As we see by these episodes, in Season 3 of ""Farscape"" they manage to have their cake and eat it too.",1067904000,2,4094,4.751060820367751
1705091,4,B00006422R,"You could just wait until next year and buy the whole boxed set of Season 3 (which is worth having), but I couldn't wait another minute - I buy the eps as soon as they are released.

Episode 312 may interest you because the 'aliens of the week' are a duo that taps into classic mythological themes. If the budding romance between Aeryn and one of the Crichtons is what turns your crank, then this episode is for you; it bored the dren out of me, and the frelling cheesy jazz that accompanied the costars' horniness helped to make this ep look shallow (especially if one remembers the energy between Gilina & Crichton in 'PK Tech Girl'). Yup, a little bit of sexuality is part of most sci-fi, but when a TV series starts to overplay that card, it's at the expense of time that could be spent further revealing the universe in which the characters live. I'm a Scaper, but that doesn't justify giving every episode 5 stars.
The highlight of Episode 312 was Stark's streak of initiative and freewill...

Episode 313 is totally untamed, unlike any previous episode (except maybe 'Won't Get Fooled Again'). While some may not care for its decadent, footloose style, I feel that it was refreshing to see how far the show could be pushed in certain directions. A night out on the town can bring out a side of your friends that you rarely see! The humor implemented in Episode 313 is unique to the series up to this point, and really throws the viewer off balance by showing most of the characters in a different light, and through its creative splicing of the camera and audio work. The bad guys are finally no more than a couple of geeks dressed in clubby clothing. It is also wild to see how Crichton interacts with Francesca Buller, his real-life wife, who plays a truly annoying character named Raxil. This IS a 5 star ep, and it's a great one to watch with your friends and a round of drinks (with umbrellas in them).

The extras include a 17+ minute interview with Gigi Edgley and a far too short one with Guy Gross, the man who comes up with the music that perfectly fits the scenes of this now legendary show.",1067472000,6,2109,4.458549222797927
1705092,5,B00006422R,"If you ever thought that Crichton (Ben Browder)was looney tunes, this set will provide you with that final proof you were seeking. Collection 4 has a quintet of some of the finest episodes produced during this season. The two part Infinite Possibilities resolves the ties together episodes from the previous seasons involving the pursuit of wormhole technology. As many fans of the show are aware, a second Crichton was created earlier in the season. The two Crichtons go their separate ways. One Crichton becomes involved in a fight to prevent the Scarrangs and Charrids from exploiting the wormhole technology to invade other parts of the galaxy. Crichton might have to give up his life to prevent the invasion.
Revening Angel is one of the sharpest and wittiest episodes of the season. An injured Crichton imagines his conflict with D'Argo is taking place in a Warner Brothers/Chuck Jones Roadrunner like cartoon.
With The Choice a greiving Aeryn travels to a planet of mystics to communicate with her deceased father and Crichton. She runs into a few surprises along the way and manages to make peace with her past.
The extras are, like much of the series, quite generous. There's a commentary provided by actress Claudia Black for ""The Choice""; an interview with Anthony Simcoe (D'Argo) and trailers. I haven't been impressed all that much with the deleted scenes. These scenes are on international versions. They don't provide much in the way of additional plot and aren't really a loss but are interesting for fans.
My only complaint is why ADV films has elected to released these in miniboxed sets. I'd prefer to have a boxed set of the entire season with special features as opposed to this more expensive proposition. This really does a disserve to fans of the series. I could see offering the miniboxed sets after the fact for fans who only want certain shows. It's rather odd. I've also found ADV's website less than responsive to problems with various discs so if you do have problems, save your receipt and make the retailer accountable. ADV won't get back to you in your lifetime.
All in all I'm quite pleased with the Farscape releases so far.",1062201600,,2159,4.885558583106267
1705093,4,B00006422R,"This collection of ""Farscape"" starts off with the two-parter ""Infinite Possibilities"", as Crichton (or one of him, anyway; long story behind that) discovers more behind his knowledge of wormholes and how it could radically affect the balance of power in the galaxy.  It's one of ""Farscape""'s finest episodes, and ends in a truly heart-wrenching finale.  On the opposite end, ""Revenging Angel"" goes into a Looney-Tunes inspired direction, while the dark and brooding ""The Choice"" leads into ""Fractures"", a relatively calm adventure which lays out the remainder of the third season (and boy, it's a doozy).  As the series' fate is currently in limbo, it's good to kick back with these episodes, especially since the next set of episodes (like the last two-parter of the season) ends on a very high note.
