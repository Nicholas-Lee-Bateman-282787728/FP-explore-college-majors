I suppose you C=A=N get complete season sets, but these special col-
lections  are enough to keep my interests; not expensive; and HIGHLY
entertaining.

The release date is my 65th birthday.... WHY NOT?",1402617600,5,280,4.9361702127659575

6358862,5,B00JHH1Y1G,"The episodes in this collection are the same ones that you get buying the Amazon Instant Videos for Season Eleven. There are ten episodes. I think out of the ten, the Newton's crane cradle one is my favorite in this collection. Location, Location, Location runs a close second, as it goes behind the scene for some of the past experiments.

6358863,3,B00JHH1Y1G,"My family loves mythbusters, especially my 8 year old son. We own many if the other collections and love them. We were a bit disappointed by this collection,however. The first episode Newtons Crane Cradle is a repeat from another collection and two other episodes are not ""real"" episodes. They are overviews of what they have done on other episodes... Not My favorite collection.",1410652800,2,379,5.031746031746032
6358864,5,B00JHH1Y1G,Our ten year old is really into this show and we like to watch it as a family. Finally getting the dvds as our netflix is going to run our internet bill through the roof.,1408665600,,170,3.8857142857142857
6358865,5,B00JHH1Y1G,"This was a great collection of Jamie and Adam taking on some amazing myths and mysteries. I love watching this show with my oldest daughter and taking guesses on what they will find in the end. Usually we are not 100% correct, but we try our best. This collection had some great episodes and we really liked the one about the rocket sled, but you have to watch to see for yourself. With over seven hours you will be kept busy for a long time to come! If you are already a fan this is definitely one to add and if you have never watched this series before, pick this up to start your collection today, you won't be disappointed!

8651031,4,B00JHH1Y1G,"We really liked the Mythbusters series when we first saw them, but after Scotty left the build team and Carrie became the only woman, she got really annoying IMHO - very ""cutesy.""  After a while the ""clever interactions"" - particularly from the era of the Build Team - seemed to take the focus over from the actual science, and we just got tired of it, especially when they wouod do things just to be mean to each other. What kind of role mode is that? But, we still did enjoy the science part.  Maybe the thing to do is to not watch too many of the episodes from any one collection too often.",1451347200,,593,4.238938053097345

Also, it doesn't hurt that they blow a lot of stuff up!!! Kids & adults will love the myth debunking/confirming process, & teachers can use it at school.",1449619200,,293,5.0

8651035,3,B00JHH1Y1G,They put the Wrecking Ball Newton's Cradle episode on this AGAIN.  It was JUST on collection 10.  How could they be THAT careless for the money they charge for these little collections?,1448323200,,185,4.75
