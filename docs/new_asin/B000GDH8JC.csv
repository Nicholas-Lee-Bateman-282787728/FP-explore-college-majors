2605080,5,B000GDH8JC,The DVD was shipped very quickly.  We received it in good condition.  It looks brand new and we are very pleased with all aspects of the purchase.,1244592000,,146,4.37037037037037
2605081,4,B000GDH8JC,"I was disappointed to find out the River of no return parts 1 and 2 were not included in this package, but otherwise this Season is excellent it has some very memorable episodes.  But I would recommend this to a friend.  But please make a note it is actually season 3 from the original series on network, which the always seem to forget to count.",1232323200,2,346,4.3076923076923075
2605082,1,B000GDH8JC,"Don't get me wrong. I love BAywatch, but I simply can't watch the series on dvd. I feel like I just threw money away, like being cheated on. The theme song has been altered, as have the end credits. And as if that wasn't enough, many of the music clips during the episodes, have other songs. It simply doesn't work, as I've come to love the music montages. I want the true show on dvd, with the original music and montages. If shipping to the US weren't so expensive, I'd ship the three season I have straight back to Fremantle. This is not what I paid for. I guess I'll have to buy the German version.",1188259200,2,602,4.198275862068965
2605083,2,B000GDH8JC,"The picture quality is worse than that of the reruns on TV [Analog Cable, ""Low"" definition]. The fact that the show is from the 90's isn't an excuse - I've bought DVDs of show from the 60's [some of them ""colorized"" B&W], and they look much better. I agree with all the criticisms about the theme - even if they couldn't get the rights to the original theme, they still could have found something much better.

Hopefully when they release the other seasons they'll do a much better job.",1177113600,2,486,4.46067415730337
2605084,2,B000GDH8JC,"I bought this season (which really should be season 3) of Baywatch episodes because I am a die hard fan of the show. However, this set of DVD's was very misleading and poorly made. If the show started in 1989, then this set is Season 3 not Season 2. The very first 2 episodes of this season which weren't on the DVDs should have been included. It was the episode where Mitch and Hobie got up to the river to go white water rafting gold country and Shauni gets kidnapped by some gold theives. Plus Eddie and Shauni get married at the very end of the 2nd episode. Very disappointing! The theme song, ""I'm Always here"" performed by Jim Jamison is not the title theme getting replaced by something very cheesy that doesn't even fit the show. None of the music video songs are the same because I remember every episode from that season like it was yesterday. I will buy the other boxed sets, but the only reason why is because Baywatch was my favorite television show. If First look entertainment is going to make more boxed sets, please bring the old theme song back and place some of the missing episodes on future discs or you will have more disappointed customers. I only gave this set 2 stars because it was my favorite show at the time.",1163980800,13,1237,4.406113537117904
2605085,3,B000GDH8JC,"the seasons are out by 1 the 1st 2 episodes are missing and the original music has been replaced. and is total off  the action of the credits.

But the video and audio is good, pitty you have to wait and buy all of the 10 syndicated seasons to get the full network one, and how long until the 1st 2 episodes from pack 1 and 2 and by the looks 3,4,5 are released, or are they just going to be released as movies",1162771200,2,410,3.869047619047619
2605086,4,B000GDH8JC,"Excellent Transfer to DVD. Video is crisp and sound is above average. Season 2 DVD is actually Season 3 ( I am guessing because all the stars David Charvet, Nicole Eggert, Pam Anderson are featured). You also get 3 episodes from Season 1.

Baywatch was the most popular TV show on the planet in the 1990's. Apparently, Hasselhoff couldn't secure rights to certain songs, so the wonderful original theme song has been replaced by a Hoff original (which is horrible).  For under $20 this DVD collection is well worth the price.",1162771200,7,525,4.758241758241758
2605087,2,B000GDH8JC,I was a fan of Baywatch for most of the 11 seasons it was on TV so I was glad to hear it was coming out on DVD . I bought season 2 only to be dissappointed. Not only are the seasons or episodes not in sequence but that the original music has been replaced. The opening theme song has been changed to some slow boring song that does not match up with the action of the credits. Season 2 episodes of this DVD are actually season 3 and then you get 2 episodes of the 1989 original which should be in the season 1 DVD. I won't be wasting any more of my money until this problem is corrected and the show is put back to it's orginal form.,1162252800,28,633,3.876923076923077
2605088,5,B000GDH8JC,Very entertaining series.,1464998400,,25,7.666666666666667
2605089,1,B000GDH8JC,"How dare they remove Eddie and Shauni; they were the heart of the show. Their romance was so beautiful and made the show so great. I hated it that they got rid of Billy Warlock(Eddie), Erika Eleniak(Shauni), Tim McTigue(Harvey) , Richard Jaeckel (Ben), and Monte Markham(Capt. Thorpe). When all of these characters were still on the show, they had great stories and especially great stories of Shauni and Eddie's romance and also great inspirational stories of saving lives and honoring lifegaurds. I hate it that they made all of them leave the show.  The real seasons 1 and 2 which still had all these characters were the best and glory days of Baywatch. When Pam Anderson, Nicole Eggert, David Charvet, and Kelly Slater came to the show in the episode ""River of No Return"" parts 1 and 2, that was the beginning of the end of the REAL and GLORY days and years of Baywatch. Matt Brody and Summer Quinn played by Charvet and Eggert tried to fill the void of the departure of Eddie and Shauni but they just failed miserably. And Pamela's character or C.J. was just there to make the beach look more sexy--not to save lives really. Oh, not to forget, I especially hated it when Alexandra Paul came to the show as well as Stephanie Holden. Her character was horrible and annoying. I wanted Mitch to remarry his wife and not marry Stephanie or have a relationship with her. Boy, did they destroy the show when they fired or let go all the original characters and hired these new, can't act actors and actresses. The point when Eddie and Shauni left and all the other original characters except for Mitch and Hobie; this show hit rock bottom and really became horrible. It wasn't really Baywatch at his point anymore--it was really Bikini or Babe watch!!!!!!",1438473600,,1753,4.65483870967742
2605090,5,B000GDH8JC,Season 2 was a good season. I think some of the episodes are out of chronological order on the discs. It's the ultimate fun guilty pleasure!,1432771200,,140,4.423076923076923

Apparently they just threw this out and very bad at what they did.",1372032000,,161,4.03125
2605096,1,B000GDH8JC,Ok so I was so excited to get season 2 of baywatch. I already ha season 1 and 3 from a few years ago I ordered from amazon. I started watching this supposedly season 2 only to come to find its the same as season 1. They just changed the cover but it's all the same episodes. I will never order from amazon again,1362700800,3,311,3.875
2605097,1,B000GDH8JC,Baywatch Season i and Season 2 are the same i need a return label to return Season 2.  They have the same shows. i want to return it for season 4.,1358208000,3,146,3.7096774193548385
2605098,5,B000GDH8JC,I Received Baywatch Season 2 as expected. I used to watch it all the time on TV. I am trying to get as many seasons as I can.,1353715200,,125,3.5
2605099,5,B000GDH8JC,i love this movie thankyou for sending me this dvd. it came on time which is a good thing. thanks  lisa,1342224000,,103,3.9047619047619047
2605100,1,B000GDH8JC,Disappointed in what is said to be season 2 is really season 3 and is missing the beginning of the first 3 episodes.,1340582400,3,116,4.086956521739131
2605101,5,B000GDH8JC,"This was a gift for my disabled brother. The Baywatch series was one of his favourites when we were growing up, and it was great that I could find it for him. He spends quite a bit of time watching DVD's. I know that he enjoys Baywatch.",1336694400,,236,4.042553191489362
2605102,4,B000GDH8JC,Baywatch - season 2 is a good series about lifeguards and has good stories and cast. I now have seasons 1-3 and will be purchasing more as they become available at a good price. Only one problem - disc four has definite problems with episodes two and three - I could not watch them in their entirety due to defects in the disc.,1334534400,,327,4.2063492063492065
2605103,4,B000GDH8JC,"This show is super cheesy at times, but I love Baywatch and the cheesiness just helps make the show what it is. I am happy that I bought the Australian Import of the show. It plays perfectly on all of my DVD players. This is the 2nd season of the series (1st season in syndication). The picture on the cover is incorrect. This cast was not the cast in season 2 of the show. I am upset that the music is changed, but I fast forward through the opening credits after I've seen them once anyway. The opening song being different is the main thing that bothers me about the music being changed. Songs changed within the episodes don't really bother me. This version at least has all of the episodes, which to me is very important as the US releases have different music AND 2 of the episodes were left out. Also, I've read that some people are upset about the quality of picture, but this was a 90's TV show (not a show in HD), so I think the quality is just fine. I do wish there were extras and I also wish the music was what was original to the series. However, if you want the series, and you want a version that will play on US DVD players, the Australian release is definitely the way to go. So I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because of the music being different and because there are no extras.",1315440000,4,1307,4.169960474308301
2605104,1,B000GDH8JC,"What the heck is this?  The music is the first disappointment, and this is not season 2.  The episodes are mixed in with a later season.  For reasons like this one, I really try to get DVD's from the library.  I am so glad I didn't buy this.  The picture quality is good to me.  Maybe because I am older than when the show originally aired, the show seems slow to me.  I have found this with some of the shows I actually bought, like the Dukes of Hazard and Greatest American Hero.  They just aren't the same.  I rate Baywatch as a 1 because of the changing of the music and because the shows seem like they are in random order.",1300060800,2,628,4.081967213114754
2605105,4,B000GDH8JC,"I enjoyed Baywatch as a child, only the first two seasons, so was really excited to enjoy the best season's (I think, lol) the only downfall I had with this, was it was missing the last esp of Shawnie & Eddie...when they got married. I know that happened the first esp of season three...but the extra esp they added on this DVD set, was the 2nd esp of season three...so that was the only disappoint I had.",1279065600,2,405,4.2727272727272725

2605107,5,B000GDH8JC,"I was a fan of this show in the beginning.  The only bad thing is that the music is different and not as good.  I miss the original music, but the episodes are still as good as I remember.",1244851200,2,188,3.7948717948717947
