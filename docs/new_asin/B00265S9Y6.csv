8351958,4,B00265S9Y6,"Trapped is a story about a man played by Henry Silva who thinks he's the authority of a house... er, make that small town in the mountains, and can do whatever he pleases.  The townspeople gradually become more and more afraid of his obsession with authority.  One day he catches his wife cheating on a man.  He storms into the bedroom and basically whips the man around, and also slaps his wife around a little too.  Henry does more than just beat on his wife's sex partner.  He humiliates the guy!  He throws him into the basement and locks the door when he's done.

When Henry and his friends are partying late at night (and stomping on the floorboards so the guy can feel the rumbles below!) Henry drags the guy out and continues the beatings and humiliation.  At this point in the story Henry's friends support his actions.  Well... most of them anyway.  One guy and in particular an older woman who lives in this small village are strongly against trapping this man in the basement and tormenting him.  They think Henry's going too far.  The woman even mentions the wife's sleazy ways and how she's just as responsible for what happened as her bedroom partner.  But it's Henry rules.  He calls the shots!  Henry does take out his frustrations on his wife later though.

They humiliate the guy so much they even throw tar and feathers over his body.  He escapes through the woods, and the chase is on.  Meanwhile a bunch of college students (2 males and 2 females) happen to be hiking in the woods during this time.  They freak out when they hear gunshots close by, so they run and hide behind a bush.  Just then the tar-covered man runs by.  The college kids say ""I've never seen a chicken like that before"".  Just kidding about this part. :)

Actually the college students are really scared.  They have no idea who this man is and why he's being shot at.  Eventually Henry and company catch up to the guy and beat him to death.  Meanwhile the college students are hiding on a cliff above watching the whole event.  They make a big mistake when they head into town and the police station to report a murder because this is a small town and the cops support the townspeople.  The college kids don't understand why the sheriff hesitates to help.  Perhaps the college kids should've traveled several miles down the road and the next police station to report the murder.

These college students are curious and persistent.  They head into the cave where the dead body is hidden but... Henry and company return!  Yup, they return to the crime scene.  The sheriff pays a visit to Henry, and even though the two have the same mother and are half brothers, they're not exactly on the same page.  With that said, the cop is willing to work with Henry halfway, and even though the subject of murdering a man isn't brought up, the cop's willing to allow Henry enough time to cover the body.  The sheriff knows Henry killed a man but perhaps given Henry's dangerous side, he doesn't question it.  That much is true.

Anyway now the college students are thrown in Henry's basement.  It should be noted that the actual trapping doesn't pertain strictly to being locked inside a basement, because soon we have chase scenes that involve the students being freed by one of Henry's men who realizes Henry's only going to kill them and that ain't right.  The ""trapped"" also refers to being trapped in the woods and unable to escape from Henry's character.

This story's really good, but it gets a little comical in an unintentional way like only an 80's movie can later on.  The one college student tries to free his girlfriend and climbs the house, only for a bad guy to be aware of his presence and shoot at him.  When the bad guy runs outside and the college kid seemingly trapped on the roof with no place to go, it just so happens the guy runs out of bullets at this moment!  This results in the college kid kicking over an antenna pole and it goes through the guy's chest.  Too bad Henry sees it, and now he wants a piece of the kid (and wanting him badly enough to drive his truck through the house, whoa!).  But SPOILERS, he too dies in a funny way.  First he's tarred and feathered much like Henry's wife's sex partner.  Then he's set on fire in the house when the kid throws a lamp on him, and he falls into the basement as the house explodes. It's a bit much.

We also have another college kid who comes into the equation.  He's driving a red sports car and wants to visit his friends, however the cop warns him not to travel up that path realizing Henry is busy tormenting his friends.  He encourages the kid to turn around and drive away.  The kid being stubborn doesn't listen, and too bad for that!  He may or may not make it out of this ordeal.

Overall Trapped is a great movie.  The acting's top notch, the suspense is high, but the only complaint is the silly outcome for Henry and some of the events leading up to it.  I guess I could complain the teens weren't tormented enough while trapped in the basement and this part of the story was neglected a bit, but I won't.  Otherwise pretty awesome movie.",1496620800,,5109,4.451995685005394
8351959,4,B00265S9Y6,"This is a brutal movie about backwoods hill people who live according to their own laws. Their leader, Henry Silva at his unpleasant and sadistic best, takes the law in his own hands and lead a mob to hunt down his wife's lover. Violent complications follow.

The story is unoriginal but captivating and Fruet's no holds barred directing keeps a good pace throughout the entire movie. The dialogue is good and amusing. There is nudity, banjo music, humiliation, plenty of man hunt scenes and bloody violence.

Highly recommended viewing for fans of Deliverance and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",1386201600,,593,5.040816326530612
8351960,5,B00265S9Y6,"You hear of so many movies referred to as cult classics, or lost gems, only to find the movies merely mediocre or underserving of their cult status. Trapped, also known as Baker County USA, is a great movie, plain and simple. What makes it so great? Well, while there's all the elements one might anticipe from a film that falls into the sub-genre of Hicksploitation (backwoods justice, nekkid white trash hotties, chases through the woods, beartraps etc) and Henry Silva on all time top form as top dog in a small hill town where nobody dares question his authority, its the insight into the hierachy of said town that makes the movie exceptional. That plus those good one fashioned things like story and well developed, believable characters, goshdarnit.",1340668800,,756,4.9140625
