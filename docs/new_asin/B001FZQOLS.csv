3589639,4,B001FZQOLS,"A good variety of arias sung by some of the very best in the opera world today.  Good entertainment.  Would have liked to have heard a little more from Ms. Gheorghiu, however.",1355788800,2,175,4.4375
3589640,5,B001FZQOLS,"This was a gift for two opera buffs who are singers themselves and they were
positively delighted with the artistes and the program selected.  The clarity of
the actual DVD also impressed them.  They have given me this feedback and
the 5 star rating. ""A thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining item!",1353628800,5,297,4.92
3589641,5,B001FZQOLS,"Bravo Kultur, Bravo Domingo. This DVD is special, especially for the presence of Domingo, Alagna, and Gheorghiu, but more so for those artists who joined them in this concert. Robert Lloyd, the British bass-baritone presented a seasoned rendition of Mephistopheles in the duet from Faust. His glorious voice shines brightly after 35 years on the stage. Dwayne Croft displayed the wonderful talent which won him the Richard Tucker prize at that gala a few years back. Susan Graham, our Metropolitan National Auditions winner, continues to show off the talent that has earned her international acclaim. Leontina Vaduva, the Romanian soprano continues the tradition of great singers from the eastern European countries from which we have Milanov, Ghiaurov among others. Another seasoned performer heard here is the Chilean Veronica Villarroel. The native of Santiago has not lost the vibrant beauty for which she has become known displayed in the duet by Mascagni. Lillian Watson is not the least among the plethora of talent on the DVD. Her delightful coloratura is displayed as Sophie blends so beautifully with Susan Graham's Octavian. Domingo is in great voice, still fresh and full of passion. Roberto Alagna has talent to spare and fits the role of Don Jose well as he is doing so in Carmen this season. Angelo Gheorghiu continues to show us a talent which will be with us for many seasons to come. A DVD that is worthwhile for repeat enjoyment.",1268265600,25,1448,5.062761506276151
3589642,5,B001FZQOLS,This was origonally known as the Gold and Silver Gala celebrating Domingo's 25th anniversary with the Royal Opera and the 50th anniv. of something at the Royal Opera. The selection of arias and songs is very good and the singing is excellent.,1264464000,17,242,4.785714285714286
3589643,5,B001FZQOLS,"This concert dvd just arrived today and I couldn't wait to watch it.
The gala was given in England a little over a decade ago. Placido
Domingo was at his very best, and so were all the performers.
I especially enjoyed his duet with the gorgeous Romanian singer Leontina
Vaduva, from ""L'Elisir d'Amore"". Vaduva also performs a song from
Donizetti's ""Don Pasquale"". She has a gorgeous voice and so much charm.
Other highlights for me were the Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna duet
from ""Carmen"", and Angela's solo song ""Muzika"".
This is a perfect concert! Highly recommended!",1228262400,37,576,4.948453608247423
8303145,5,B001FZQOLS,"Watching and listening to Placido Domingo is always a treat.  He has amazing stage presence -- very relaxed, friendly with good audience communication.  This program of arias includes Domingo and others, though clearly Domingo is the center of attention.  The video and audio quality are quite good.  The program is varied.  The performances very good.  At nearly 1.5 hours this DVD is an excellent value.",1474070400,,405,5.153846153846154
