It is 60 minutes long.  There is a warm-up at the beginning then the yoga starts.  The warm-up lasts a little less than 5 minutes.

There is a resting pose/meditation at the end that is around 10 minutes.

The instructor walks among the class giving instruction live rather than via voice over.  Most of the participants look very toned.

There are a lot of standing poses in the beginning then some floor ones.  Poses I remember are high lunge, warrior 1, chair, twist with high lunge with or without hand on floor then with or without bind, twist with chair, shoulder stretch with legs spread, triangle, revolved triangle, standing forward bend, downward facing dog, and 1 where you stand and hold your leg in front of you and twist.  The hardest one was where you started in squat and went into crow but it was tilted or twisted to each side with your upper body only down on the floor.

Floor poses included mostly seated work including pigeon and quadriceps stress, seated forward bend, bound angle or butterfly stretch, and various twists while seated.  Of course there were a lot of chatarungas and upward facing dog and some planks.

The instructor did talk some about letting go of what upsets you and showing your best side to the world and only brief talk about the universe.

Overall I would say it was enjoyable and I felt stretched afterwards, although did not break heavy sweat.  Recommended!",1366156800,,1439,4.704
