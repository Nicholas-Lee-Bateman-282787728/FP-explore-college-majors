he made it interesting.",1410220800,,142,4.071428571428571
2683397,3,B000K7O9ZA,Enjoyed watching the movie.  Good but not exceptional.,1406073600,,54,5.75
2683398,4,B000K7O9ZA,"Decent adaptation of Hammond Innes book, though there tends to be a lot of internal thinking by the central protagonist in his works that gets left behind.  Political incorrectness of whale hunting may keep this Columbia film off DVD unless it is an on-demand release.",1397174400,,268,4.955555555555556

2683400,5,B000K7O9ZA,"Allan Ladd is not one of my favorite tough guys but he does do a good job at acting like one. In this movie he falls for the daughter of a whaling business owner who is also the captain of one of the vessels and he gets involved in the inner conflicts of the business. I liked the ocean scenes and whaling vessel shots. Cool settings, romance and lots of action, all the elements in a movie that I enjoy.",1379808000,3,404,4.0625

8154620,3,B000K7O9ZA,"They're all dead so u can't hurt their feelings now. The acting is so predictable its painful. Jill Bennett, at the end is the best thing to happen since she added the first bit of interest in the movie, the heroine that Ladd never fullfilled.",1441324800,,243,4.4222222222222225

8154622,3,B000K7O9ZA,"Action and adventures on the high seas as Alan Ladd travels to South Africa to pound a little sense into a fellow that swindled him in a gold mine scam.  While on the plane he is very much attracted to Joan Tetzel, a young lady on her way to South Africa and then out to a whale hunting expedition to find out about her father's death.  His business partner says he committed suicide, but she's not buying that story and is determined to find out the truth.  Ladd signs on as first mate so that he can get to know her better.  Well done flick with great whale hunting scenes.  Stanley Baker plays the evil former boyfriend and villain of the piece.  A role he always plays well.  Entertaining and well worth the watch.",1421971200,,718,4.313432835820896
