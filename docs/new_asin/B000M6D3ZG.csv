8166815,3,B000M6D3ZG,Not as good as Egypt or London in the Warner Oland series.  Other than Keye Luke it lacks memorable character interplay but it's still enjoyable  entertainment.,1446595200,,160,5.115384615384615
8166816,4,B000M6D3ZG,"I was disappointed with the prior film, Chalie Chan in Egypt, however this one worked far better. While it still had some of the pacing issues of 1930s films, it also had a fairly engaging story with a twist ending.

More importantly, it had Keye Luke as Lee Chan as he provides some comic relief in a few scenes, but also some good physicality.  Chan has some nice endearing moments in addition to being the great detective. So once again, Oland delivers the goods.",1401580800,,466,4.535714285714286
8166817,5,B000M6D3ZG,"A Chinese friend of mine watched ""Charlie Chan in Shanghai"" and confirmed that Charlie is speaking Chinese - specifically, Cantonese, in a respectable accent - at the banquet.
Hardly anyone takes a foreign language, other than Spanish, in the US these days, but if you know French, there is a funny exchange in ""Charlie Chan in Monte Carlo.""
Charlie and his son chance upon a parked car in which a dead man is found.  The police appear and the son tries to explain the situation in his high-school French.
He mistakenly tells the police they have shot (tirer) the man, instead of having found (trouver) him and the Chans are promptly arrested.  Inside joke!
If you are getting started in these movies, by all means watch ""Castle in the Desert,"" perhaps inspired by Scotty's castle in Death Valley.  ""High production values,"" as they say, and again attention to detail - a key event is the flight of an arrow, and if you stop the action at the appropriate point, you'll see it really does happen.
 The novels, by Earl Derr Biggers, are not very good.",1371772800,3,1049,4.654054054054054
8166818,4,B000M6D3ZG,"This is a 1935 film starring Warner Oland, a non-Oriental, as Chan. A friend of his requests that he come to Shanghai to help him in an important matter, but does not tell him what it is. While on the ship to China, he receives a letter threatening his life if he lands. Chan has no time to find out his mission from his friend before his friend is killed. He requests that the local police let him help solve the murder. Attempts are made on his life and he is kidnapped. A friend of his friend seems to be implicated in crimes, but is he? His number one son, as usual, adds humor to the tale when he tries to help his dad. Chan continues to make witty statements in this film, such as the following:

 A holiday mood like fickle girl - privilege to change mind.
 Motive (of a crime) like end of string - tied in many knots and may be in sight, but hard to unravel.
 Talk cannot cook rice.
 Silence best answer when uncertain.
 Distance no hindrance to fond thoughts.
 Cold (egg) omelet like fish out of sea - doesn't improve with age.
 One man cannot move mountain, but two can start digging.
 Only foolish dog follows flying bird.
 Shot in dark sometimes find eye of bull.
 Hasty conclusion like leg of mule - kick backward.",1321920000,3,1227,4.268398268398268
8166819,4,B000M6D3ZG,"The movie Charlie Chan in Shanghai is a very entertaining and somewhat different Charlie Chan movie.  If you enjoy watching Charlie Chan movies, you would definitely enjoy Charlie Chan in Shanghai.  I have seen most of the Charlie Chan movies starring both Warner Oland and Sidney Toler.  Charlie Chan in Shanghai has some different aspects with Warner Oland singing to children and actually speaking Chinese.  Keye Luke, Charlie Chan's number one son is very entertaining and Charlie Chan has to keep him from running up the telephone bill talking to his girl.  The murder mystery twist is also very interesting.  I think you will like.  I did.",1289692800,,645,4.97196261682243
8166820,5,B000M6D3ZG,"""Very proud of offspring. As you say--Scram!"" -- Charlie to Lee

This entry in the Charlie Chan franchise boasts an attractive cast and  nice settings, in addition to a good story. Swedish born Warner Oland is right at home now as Earl Derr Biggers' detective, with young Keye Luke establishing with charm the continuing efforts of his offspring to help ""pop"" and play detective too. Number one son Lee (Keye Luke) has plenty of opportunity to do just that with Charlie on the heels of an opium smuggling ring in 1930's Shanghai. The accent is a bit more on the action side in some moments, the humor derived from Charlie's reigning in of young Lee's love life via his phone.

Charlie no sooner arrives by boat when a man named Woodland with important information for him is cleverly slain. His niece Diana (Irene Hervey) has romantic thoughts for young Philip Nash (Charles Locher) who quickly finds himself the chief suspect when a second attempt is made on Chan's life. It seems Woodland was a British Agent who had discovered too much. His American counterpart arrives but things get no clearer when Charlie and Lee are briefly kidnapped. Charlie takes nothing at face value, of course, and enlists two innocents in order to ferret out the ringleader.

Charm, an exotic atmosphere, and the fine cast of players surrounding Warner Oland and Keye Luke Fox put together elevate this entry to a most excellent status. Like Biggers, his literary creation, Charlie Chan, could be quite the romantic where youthful love was concerned. The detective from Hawaii had many children of his own, and nearly always helped the struggling young couple find true love at the end of the mystery. Charlie Chan in Shanghai is no exception. A very nice time at the movies.",1265846400,,1756,4.823920265780731
8166821,3,B000M6D3ZG,"This movie is very much a 30's detective type.
The British secret service in Shanghai trying to stop the illegal flow of opium. The friend of Charlie Chan is killed by a rigged boobie trap
and he and his son set out to find the killer.
The smuggling ring is led from San Francisco
and the intrigue is  pretty interesting.
Since I know some Chinese American pretty well, this movie is at times offensive in the stereo types used.
This particular movie isn't as bad as some of the others.",1248480000,,486,4.4
8166822,4,B000M6D3ZG,"Charlie Chan in Shanghai has one of my favorite opening scenes in the series. A group of young children are playing leapfrog on a liner deck. The camera slow pans back to reveal that Charlie Chan is folded over on the deck waiting for the youngsters to leap over him.

From that playful interlude, the mood soon darkens as a stranger slips a note into Charlie's pocket warning him not to get off the ship in Shanghai. Naturally, Charlie isn't perturbed . . . until threatened by the thought of having to make a speech at a welcoming dinner in his honor that night.

At the dinner, his local contact leans over to tell Charlie that he has important news to share. They agree to meet after the event. But death intrudes. Charlie doesn't know where to go next because his contact had not alerted him to what the issue was that summon Charlie to Shanghai.

Charlie begins investigating the murder on his own and seems to have ruffled more feathers. With quick wits he escapes from a kidnapping.

Much humor is supplied by the presence of eldest son, Lee Chan, played by Keye Luke, who repeatedly slows down progress by hogging the telephone with his girl friend.  The other gags involve Lee dressing as a beggar and conducting surveillance on Charlie's behalf.

Eventually, Charlie realizes that he's up against an opium-smuggling ring and starts to track the ring down through the men who kidnapped him.

The ending is full of suspense and action.

Part of the fun of this story is that Charlie gets a chance to speak Chinese and to be on home turf compared to the Europeans and Americans who are doing business in China.  It would be great fun to see a remake of this movie, updated for today's China.  Presumably, the smuggling would involve pirated copies of Microsoft programs instead of opium.

The plot is a little on the light side, and the mystery isn't quite mysterious enough to be completely satisfying.  But all Charlie Chan buffs will be glad to see this movie.",1203292800,2,1971,4.616045845272207
