8157772,5,B000KKN0B6,A brilliant contemporary adaptation of Ibsen's classic drama. The script makes ingenious use of Ibsen's material in a distinctly modern context without losing any of the rich characterizations that distinguish the original. Superb cinematography is another highlight. The performances are uniformly deep and filled with nuance. Highly recommended.,1428969600,,347,6.25
