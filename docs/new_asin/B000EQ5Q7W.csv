8112665,4,B000EQ5Q7W,Well there are some sick puppies in this world from necrophiles to cannibals this one got a few.,1488672000,,96,4.388888888888889
8112666,2,B000EQ5Q7W,"If you are like me, and enjoy watching serial killer documentaries, true crime stories and the like, you are probably thinking this is a good buy. You would be wrong. This is the shortest, least informative, cliff notes version of any interview ever. There are other movies out that have so much more detailed and interesting information. Maybe if you collect such things or are obsessed with Dahmer this might be a good addition..",1466467200,2,431,4.837837837837838
8112667,5,B000EQ5Q7W,Very interesting.,1434499200,,17,8.0
8112668,5,B000EQ5Q7W,this movie is true and I think stone Phillips interviewed Jeffery before his father pasted mr Philips made the statement that cold chills went up his spine the entire time he was talking to Jeffery even with his father present Jeffery was killed about 2 weeks later in prison and the movie showed some real details of what he did to his people he preyed on if you like true movies this is a must for your collection,1395360000,,415,4.333333333333333
8112669,3,B000EQ5Q7W,"Liked the one-on-one interviews with the Killers; got some new information there. Wish I would have looked at DVD length, because it's too short.",1368057600,,145,5.083333333333333
8112670,5,B000EQ5Q7W,I bought this to add to my serial killer documentary collection. I think it's out of print now and I got it cheap. Unlike BTK confessions. I don't know how the hell I'm going to get that one. I'm not paying 80 bucks. Anyway mainly I bought this to replace an old VHS tape of a son of sam special on a&e. Although being around 15 minutes shorter than that one i am happy since it contains pretty much the same info as the that one. And I don't think the a&e program will ever be released on DVD. The dahmer part of the disc is good too. Stone Phillips interviews dahmer and his father Lionel. They both field questions and ask each other a few. All in all a good release if you're into true crime.,1303171200,,696,4.087591240875913
8112671,4,B000EQ5Q7W,"very interesting ,but kinda short,still worth it for under 5 bucks,could have been 2.5 or so hours,its not like there is a shortage of info ,he ate people for crying out loud,still found out some thing new ,i do every time i watch a documentary on these complete weirdos....",1299024000,2,274,4.612244897959184
8112672,5,B000EQ5Q7W,"Cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer and Son-of-Sam serial killer David Berkowitz are two of the most notorious names in the annals of American crime. This disc from NBC News brings new details to both their stories with exclusive jail-house interviews of the murderers. Dahmer is interviewed by Stone Phillips in prison, and comes across as a little boy who hopes he doesn't get in too much trouble for what he's done. Berkowitz, in his interviews, offers new theories about his crimes -- he says he had help, and that the other killers are still out there. To me, he's convincing. You decide. Great bonus features: extra interview moments with Dahmer and with his father, Lionel - who has tried for years to figure out what HE did to create a son who could commit such crimes.",1141689600,11,765,4.7164179104477615
