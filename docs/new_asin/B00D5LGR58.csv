8589708,4,B00D5LGR58,"3 Karloff early Karloff movies~ Hard to find and worth the watch. NO staring roles but he often steals the show. Worth the price~

1. The Criminal Code~ one of his better early movies. Brooding career criminal Galloway (Karloff) holds a grudge as he schemes revenge....as he rots.... in the big house. He earns a ""trustee"" job working for the warden (Walter Huston). He kills the ""stoolie"" in a carefully staged murder. When a cell mate/ witness ends up in the ""hole"" /solitary confinement.... for him he decides he can kill of the guard he hates and clear his cell mate. Howard Hawks gem. VERY good movie.
2.  The Guilty Generation~ Karloff is a despised Italian Bootlegger who's own son hates him (Robert Young) even changed his name to avoid any connection with his despised family. Young falls for the daughter (Constance Cummings) of his father's worst enemy.  The Romeo and Juliet angle holds the plot together. Karloff is on the screen very little. As each family ruthlessly ""bump off"" family members one by one. The end has a good twist ending. This is the least entertaining of the three.
3. Behind the Mask~ The Feds will do anything to break up a big narcotics ring. They plant (Jack Holt) in the same cell as Karloff who is a stooge for the Narcotics Gang. Holt breaks out of prison and ends up at the house of a gang doctor. Again Karloff has a minor part but is fun to watch as the gang flunkie. Added fun are what were then NEW technology~ a phone voice recorder ~ a fluoroscope used to x ray through clothes to check for undercover G mens Badges and Weapons. This turns from a crime movie into a horror movie when the Narcotics ring leader has his own hospital and surgery to get rid of any ""loose ends""  and Holt is a very loose end. This is a very good movie. Holds the interest.

This set is not the best of Karloff but is a good look at his early movies including minor roles. Karloff was born in England and immigrated to Canada where he did Theatre and was over 40 years old before he became a big star in Frankenstein. All Three of these movies were made before Frankenstein.  One of the Bonus DVD sections gives a very interesting Bio of Karloff including where he got his stage name. I give this set 4 stars over all and video quality of the set if first rate. NO close captions.",1472342400,3,2304,4.422169811320755
8589709,4,B00D5LGR58,"These films are quite good, and will certainly entertain and perhaps educate those who only know Karloff from the Universal horror pictures!",1425340800,5,140,5.409090909090909
8589710,3,B00D5LGR58,"For the price, this set would be a hard sell.
The films are all over the map in the Karloff filmography.  THE CRIMINAL CODE is one of Karloff's best performances.  Maybe his best pre-FRANKENSTEIN film.
Be warned that he is not on screen all that much in two of these.  One should purchase this depending on how much of a Karloff completest one happens to be.  I would say the price is a bit too high for most Karloff enthusiasts.",1405209600,13,429,4.325
8589711,3,B00D5LGR58,"TCM trying to make money off Boris Karloff name when in fact in these 3 movies he is not the headliner or the second.  His average time on the screen is approx. 5 minutes for each movie. These are fair ""B"" movies There are several other sets that would be a better investment.  Also, interesting TCM did not publish my review!  So if you are a Boris Karloff fan don't waste your money on this!",1376697600,16,393,4.213333333333333
8589712,3,B00D5LGR58,"Personally I have not seen The Criminal Code or The Guilty Generation but I just watched Behind The Mask from 1932.
It's not bad. A little slow getting started, things take a while to progress, worth the effort though.
Karloff is actually a supporting character, not the lead. It was nice to see him in an ordinary role as opposed to a monster role. Apparently in real life he was a very kind, friendly man who was very devoted to his family.
The storyline for Behind The Mask is pretty good. It's about drug smugglers who hide their wares in coffins buried n the graveyard and the secret service men who are out to reveal the crime while punishing the offenders.
Quite a surprise for 1932. I stuck with the movie and I'm glad I did.
I think this set would be a great addition to your Boris Karloff collection. It would be nice if the price were reduced somewhat though....",1376006400,9,873,4.428571428571429
