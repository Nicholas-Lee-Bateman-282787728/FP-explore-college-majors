4430039,1,B004MFT1PO,"I RATE this item's quality in 3 manners:

As a film based on a graphic novel.  Great interpretation of the French language comics.  Awesome humor, think The Mummy movies with a better storyline, and deeper characterization.  There is a particularly European feel to it, obviously.  Some would call it French, but I think European does both the movie and Europe more justice.  Great casting, good directing, satisfying special effects.  I'm looking forward to the sequels.

As a recorded media item.  My previous review was deleted, I hope that this not happens again.  The quality of the disk is weak.  I will wait until it is released in the U.S. for a better quality edition.  And I suggest for people reading this review to do the same.

As a product that was sold to me by an Amazon seller.  The item arrived quickly, fast delivery.  But due to the lack of quality of the item, as stated above, I would not buy from this seller again.  Essentially, the DVD got here quickly, and I was quickly disappointed by it's low recorded quality.

In summary, wait for an U.S. release.

Thanks for the opportunity to review this item twice.",1311292800,6,1133,4.66497461928934
4430040,5,B004MFT1PO,"This movie is a riot from start to finish. It is drawn from a comic well known in France, but you don't really need to know that to enjoy the film. The DVD contains both the original French and a dubbed-English version; I chose to watch it in French with English subtitles. The story, set in 1911, centers on Adele Blanc-Sec, a daring adventure writer, and her quest to find a cure for her sister who suffers from a hatpin through the brain (!). Add some resuscitated Egyptian mummies and a pterodactyl for starters.

The film is permeated with special effects, mostly done by BUF Compagnie (which also has contributed to AVATAR, THOR and many other Hollywood productions) and which I find to be top-notch. The story doesn't end on a cliff-hanger, but it leaves open the possibility of a sequel. The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc-Sec was adapted and directed by Luc Besson, whose prolific output includes La Femme Nikita and The Fifth Element; he knows how to come up with something satisfyingly different.",1309996800,2,1016,4.805714285714286
4430041,4,B004MFT1PO,An extraordinarily good movie experience. I watched it in French with subtitles and  thoroughly enjoyed it. Luc Beeson rocks!,1308182400,3,125,5.578947368421052
4430042,5,B004MFT1PO,"Thank heavens, and it doesn't suffer from the predictability and cliches of Hollywood that almost every movie from that town does nowadays.  One never knows where The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc-Sec will end up next, and that's half of the fun.  Pterydactyls, mummies, and raising from the dead have never been as fun, or as fashionable.  Louise Bourgois, as Adele, is wonderful. And for those of you, like myself, who don't speak French, the English dubbing is well voiced (although not necessarily always well synchronized).  It's nothing more than a silly, fun romp, but it is a very good silly fun romp.",1299369600,37,619,4.980582524271845
4430043,3,B004MFT1PO,"""The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc-Sec"" (""Les aventures extraordinaires d'Adle Blanc-Sec"") is a French comedy/adventure film written and directed by Luc Besson known for ""Lon"" (""The Professional) and ""The Fifth Element."" The film is based on the popular French comic series (1976 - ) created by Jacques Tardi (usually known simply as ""Tardi""). The film's story about a beautiful and resourceful adventure novelist may remind you of some Hollywood films (such as the Indiana Jones franchise or ""The Mummy"" series), but Besson keeps the heroine's story firmly grounded in comedic situations.

Set in the early 20th century, a 2010 cinematic adaptation starts with a pterodactyl egg displayed in the Paris museum that is hatched by Professor Esprandieu (Jacky Nercessian). The episode is followed by Adele Blanc-Sec (Louise Bourgoin), heroine of the film and popular novelist traveling in Egypt looking for the mummy of a certain doctor. Her search is interrupted by Dieuleveut (Mathieu Amalric, unrecognizable under latex makeup).

Though it is fun watching Louise Bourgoin as the spirited heroine in various costumes (and also in a bathtub, though not explicitly naked), the film quickly sinks under the weight of so many underdeveloped episodes and tiresome characters. Even considering the cultural differences, Luc Besson's heavy-handed attempt at jokes is not very effective, trying too hard to make us laugh. The scenery-chewing performances of Mathieu Amalric, who understands exactly what he should do as a larger-than-life villain, is delightful to see, but after a too brief appearance at the beginning of the film, he stays away from the screen for the most part of the meandering story.

This is not a complete mess, I admit, but ""The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc-Sec"" is not likely to attract many audiences, whether Luc Besson fans or not.",1297468800,9,1872,5.382252559726963
4430044,5,B004MFT1PO,"This Indiana-joneseque movie is a well produced, directed, acted and shot crowd pleaser. The cinematography is by THierry Arbogast, whose filmography includes The 5th Element. This was a $40m production (very high by European standards) so the set pieces and props are fantastic. Its very funny in many places, and some of the action is spectacular. Its appropriate for kids above 10 I would say. This DVD is excellent also. It comes in a slipcase, and the DVD is of high quality. It gives you both the French and English language versions. I watched it in French with English subtitles with the wife, then watched it again in English with my son.",1296950400,22,647,4.785714285714286

This film, as with most Luc Besson films, features a great blending of action, adventure, chaos and comedy. Here, in early 1900s Paris, we have our heroine Adle Blanc-Sec (Louise Bourgoin)  who can arch an eyebrow with the best of them  fighting pterodactyls, several-thousand year old Egyptian mummies and French bureaucracy; all in an effort to save her terminally incapacitated sister. And, in typical Besson fashion, nothing goes as planned! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO:  2.34:1  Color  1080p  MPEG-4 AVC (32.9 Mbps)

  The movie's image is sharp to, on frequent occasion, very-sharp (with fine detail, such as, patterns in clothing, hair-styles and wall-coverings being easily discernible). The image also has very good contrast and very good shadow-detail (as seen in the many outdoor nighttime scenes, in the dark interior of the tomb of Ramses II, and the dark interior of the prison). Also, colors are richly rendered, and very life-like (even, in the many dark scenes). Lastly, there are no obvious artifacts such as banding, specks, white dots, hair-lines or color fluctuations. Overall, this movie's presentation on blu-ray has very good picture quality, and should satisfy the vast majority of viewers.

AUDIO:  DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (English & French, 48 KHz, 24-bit)

  Though I don't speak, nor do I understand, French  but, also not being a philistine  I selected the French language soundtrack (which, interestingly enough, was NOT the default soundtrack for a movie that was made (mostly) in France  with native French speakers!), along with selecting the English subtitles, and was richly rewarded with a VERY fine audio presentation! It features very deep bass, very active and highly directional surround channels, clear well-placed dialog, ambient sounds that effectively convey the location of the on-screen action and setting, and some well recorded music. This soundtrack is a very good example of the art of sound design in film  and, it should satisfy the VAST majority of listeners (both French-speaking and non-French-speaking, like myself).

In my case, I even invited a friend to come watch it with me because I think Adele Blanc-Sec is one of the cleverest movies I have ever seen.  It borrows from most of the adventure movies of the past 30 years and does so in a way that is satirical yet pays homage.  I laughed out loud throughout the movie, even as I watched it the third time.  Luc Besson, who directed the ""Fifth Element,"" which is also a very enjoyable movie, directs this ""romp"" and hits the nail on the head unerringly from beginning to end.  My only regret is that I had to take my attention away from the action to read the subtitles.  However watching the movie twice helps cure this problem.  Plan on seeing ""Adele"" at least twice.

4430119,5,B004MFT1PO,"Why this movie disappeared in the USA seemingly without a trace baffles me.  This is about as perfect a young adult action movie as I have ever sat through.  It is NOT a children's movie, but someone age 12 could handle it with ease.  It ranks IMHO with the Indiana Jones series and certainly out-performs all the other archaeological action-adventure films I have seen.  Perhaps the whole thing is simply too smart for it's own good.
The character of Adele Blanc-Sec is not the nicest of ladies but she gets done what is needed.  It was refreshing to see a character who wasn't too wholesome and had enough flaws to make them a three-dimensional character.  As performed by Louise Bourgois she comes across as human, and over time her motivation is revealed.  The period setting in Paris (and elsewhere) 1912 is wonderful and the production values on the film are marvelous.  The CGI work -extensive as it is - fits into the plot without detracting.
Most importantly, it has the dynamic directing style that Luc Besson is known for, but too often 'dumbs' down for the American audience.  This is one of those times where he is on fire, and the movie has a magnificent visual style.  Typically, there is a forward motion to the film that never stops.  I enjoyed this movie from the first frame to the last and have recommended it to all my friends, especially those with children.
Admittedly, I have never read the comics so I refrain from making any comparison, but as a stand-alone movie I really enjoyed this.  It gets my highest recommendation.",1436400000,10,1548,4.692592592592592

I didn't expect to. It was with some reservations that I rented this French movie on Amazon. You see, it's got a dinosaur in, one of those flying dinosaurs, and mummies, and I don't normally go for fantasy stuff. And frankly, even though much of this movie is preposterous, it was great fun and I was pleasantly surprised.

First of all, the heroine. She's wonderful! She curses at camels, has no patience for dumb-butts, and has a witty retort for nearly every situation. I think my favorite was when she kicked a villain in the nuts and told him, ""Whenever you use it, you will think of me,"" or something like that. LOL You have to see it to ""get it"" but I guarantee you'll get a kick out of it.

And she dresses fabulously. The year is 1911 so it's a bit Steam Punky.

She's a journalist/author who treks the globe fearlessly. For this movie she heads to Egypt to raid a tomb--not for the gold, but for a mummy she believes is a doctor whom if he comes back to life, he can heal her sister. But the man she needs to bring the mummy back to life is on death row because of this drama with the dinosaur...and so she must get him out of that situation first...and that comes with its own set of laughs.

Laughter. This movie made me laugh quite a few times. The police officers are hilarious; her failed attempts to get the professor out of jail; the mummy...the witty quips, there's a lot of funny moments and while one may think a talking mummy is silly, the movie isn't overdone or cheesy. It's just the right balance.

I wish there was a sequel. The ending leaves one in suspense. I thought perhaps it was a new adventure starting, that would be finished in another movie...and I'm not going to reveal anything more than that. Having watched this incredible, tough, feisty woman ride a Petrodoctyl (sp?), curse at a camel, and fend off bad guys, I have no doubt she'll get herself out of the mess the ending puts her in.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: This charming and beautiful French tale whisks you away to the fantastical world of early twentieth-century Paris, where loveable heroine Adle Blanc-Sec saves the day without breaking a sweat, which combines the thrills of Tomb Raider with the fashions of La Boheme, then look no further. The Extraordinary Adventures of Adle Blanc-Sec has it all: dinosaurs, Egyptian mummies and a female adventurer with a spectacular collection of hats. Based on the comic strip by Jacques Tardi, the film traces the journey of madcap novelist Blanc-Sec [Louise Bourgoin] dry white, like the wine who spends her days travelling to perilous and far-flung corners of the world in search of material for her next book.

We meet Adle Blanc-Sec in Egypt, 1911, where she has trekked into the desert to the tomb of Pharaoh Ramses II. The intrepid explorer enlists the help of oddball Professor Esprandieu [Jacky Nercessian], who claims he can raise the pharaohs doctor from the dead to cure Blanc-Secs dying sister, who was impaled on a hat pin in a freak tennis accident. Meanwhile, in Paris, the nutty professor has proven his powers by hatching a baby pterodactyl from a 136 million-year-old egg in the natural history museum. Tasked with ridding the city of the winged beast, Clouseau-like Inspector Caponi [Gilles Lellouche], turns to Adle Blanc-Sec, who has returned to Paris with a shrivelled mummy in tow. Cue much hilarity, glamorous costume changes and a series of close scrapes as she fends off arch-nemesis Dieuleveult [Mathieu Amalric] and the advances of a besotted botanical scientist.

Director Luc Besson [Leon and La Femme Nikita] has tried previously to bring Tardis sketches life, but admits this was one of the strangest films he has ever made. Despite the genre shift, Bessons production retains the aesthetics of a comic book through authentic costumes and attention to detail that is a fitting homage to Tardis dream-like world.

Louise Bourgoin is played with a breezy, almost klutzy charm by Bourgoin, Adle is a feisty, unflappable and brilliantly caustic heroine. The lunatic plot finds her in Egypt, turned tomb raider to find the mummy of a famed ancient Egyptian doctor. If Adles scientist friend can bring him back to life, this mummy may just be able to cure her sister  languishing in a coma after a freak accident. As well as outrunning balls of fire, Adle Blanc-Sec must evade her arch nemesis [Mathieu Amalric, virtually unrecognisable in shrivelled, syphilitic prosthetics].

Back in fin-de-sicle Paris is recreated in ravishing detail. Adle Blanc-Secs scientist tests his technique on a dinosaur egg, wreaking mayhem on the city by bringing to life a pterodactyl. There is a lot to enjoy in this frantic farce, not just the sumptuous locations, but some pleasingly grisly touches. like the gothic spectacle of Adle Blanc-Secs sister lying in a coma, a nail protruding from her head  and some wonderfully groovy mummies, who wake up speaking fluent French, incidentally. But it all plays on one note of droll humour, which while pleasingly mordant and all styled really brilliantly.

Louise Bourgoin had little acting experience prior to playing Adle Blanc-Sec, having previously been a TV weather girl, but her on-screen charisma and instinctive comic timing means shes unfazed by the bigger stars and eccentric plot, and is undoubtedly one to keep an eye on. Its just a shame Amalric didn't share more screen time with her, as Luc Bessons strategic tight shots of his unsightly, twitching face up close to Louise Bourgoins radiant complexion are simultaneously so wrong and yet so right. Luc Besson likes to focus on the face in his films, to get right up close to share the subtlest of expressions and the wildest reactions. I particularly enjoyed watching Jacky Nercessian as Esperandieus close-up whilst he appears to share the mind of the pterodactyl (watch out for that).

The whole concept, humour and executed plot are, admittedly, sometimes silly and might not be cherished by all, but to me it was absolutely fantastic, but overall the film is so brilliant good-natured that whether the audience are smiling delightedly or groaning inwardly, all will be enjoying its visual beauty and plucky spirit, which is essentially wrapped up in the character of Adle Blanc-Sec herself. My eyes are peeled for hopefully a sequel on the horizon, but I will not hold my breath.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Presented in the original aspect ratio of 2.35:1, with an awesome 1080p stunning encoded images, that looks absolutely stunning and was clearly shot with top of the range digital cameras, as there aren't any of the problems you generally assertion with digital films such as less than convincing contrast levels, digital breakup and poor definition in dark scenes with bright lights. Throughout the film and in every location, the contrast levels are superb, with inky blacks and no loss of detail when the light levels drop. Colours are reassuringly strong, vibrant and well defined, without any bleeding. Oddly, the English subtitles are burnt in, rather than optional, something which will disappoint and frustrate Francophones who would like to watch this in French without subtitles. However, they are well written and quite faithfully translated, although it is quite funny to see some peculiarities in the translation, so when Andrzej tells Adle Blanc-Sec his name and says it's Andrei, with a J as in Jardin, the subtitles change that to 'Andre, with a J as in Jaguar', an alteration which makes perfect sense. Thankfully, the subtitles are also easy to read as they are white with a black outline so they stand out even against a light background. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast  Asia.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  You have the choice of two French tracks on the Blu-ray disc, which is either 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio or the LPCM 2.0 Stereo Audio and as you'd expect, both are excellent with crystal clear dialogue and present the dialogue, score and atmospherics extremely well. There are numerous action oriented scenes where the 5.1 track is clearly the one to choose as the front and rear surrounds and subwoofer really emphasises the action on screen with excellent directional sound and separation surround sounds. As you'd expect from a Luc Besson film, the score is provided by Eric Serra who has scored other action films including LON: THE PROFESSIONAL, NIKITA and GoldenEye and his experience pays off here with an extremely accomplished composition. It does a fine job with upping the tempo during the action sequences, playing up the more humorous scenes and underscoring the quieter, and especially the more tender moments between Adle Blanc-Sec and her sister Agathe Blanc-Sec [Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre].

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Four Exclusive Beautiful Limited Edition Artcards.

Special Feature: Making of The Extraordinary Adventures Of Adle Blanc-Sec [2010] [480i] [4:3] [26:04] A fairly in-depth look at the making of the film and is unsurprisingly, like the other extra features on the disc, a piece made for a French audience and is entirely in French with English subtitles. It begins with The Genesis of the Story, featuring interviews with Luc Besson, the original director and comic book creator Jacques Tardi and producer Virginie Besson. It then goes on to the central character, with Luc Besson describing why he cast Louise Bourgoin, with an interview with her and shots from the set and posing for publicity stills. It then progresses to The World of Adle Blanc-Sec and other elements of the comic strip and film in the featurette which is well worth watching with some revealing interviews, behind the scenes footage, how they used CGI for the pterodactyl, mummies and to make the Paris in 2009 look like Paris in 1911/1912 and the extraordinary use of SFX make-up and prosthetics to age people, make them look a great deal fatter or otherwise completely change their appearance so they resemble the character in the comic strips.

Special Feature: Exclusive Interviews: Here we have Luc Besson, Louise Bourgoin, Mathieu Amalric, Jean-Paul Rouve, Jacky Nercessian and Gilles Lellouche [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] Included in this section is interviews with Luc Besson [480i] [4:3] [14:51]; Louise Bourgoin [480i] [4:3] [15:50]; Mathieu Amalric [480i] [4:3] [19:49]; Jean-Paul Rouve [480i] [4:3] [16:02]; Jacky Nercessian [480i] [4:3] [14:44] and  Gilles Lellouche [480i] [4:3] [17:18]. Each Interview does not play as one lot, but are quite lengthy and have to be selected individually.

Special Feature: In the Studio [2010] [480i] [4:3] [4:59] This follows on from a part in the interview with the very shy Louise Bourgoin, in which she said she cannot sing, and her mother said ""Whatever you do, don't sing', and shows her in the recording studio adding her vocal talents to the song which plays over the end credits.

Special Feature: Cinemoi interview with Luc Besson [2010] [480i] [4:3] [25:43] This is an English-language interview conducted by Jason Solomons, probably for a programme called Mise en Scne, and this is a more general interview about Luc Besson's career, focusing on The Extraordinary Adventures of Adle Blanc-Sec.

Special Feature: Music Video [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1.51] Here we have a very French quirky and eccentric video presentation, which showcases Luc Bessons quirky style of film presentation, plus you also get now and again selected scenes from The Extraordinary Adventures of a Adle Blanc-Sec. Unfortunately, they do not give any details who the young women is performing and singing in the video.

Theatrical Trailer [2010] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1:33] This is very well put together and should prove interesting enough to make most viewers want to check out the film.

Sneak Peaks: Source Code [1080p] [2:06]; Mars Advert [480i] [0:34]; Attack The Block [108p] [2:05] and Wrigleys Extra Advert [480i] [0:30]

Finally, The Extraordinary Adventures of a Adle Blanc-Sec is a return to form for Luc Besson, certainly the best film he's directed for a decade and one which is extremely well paced, has the right amount of drama, action, adventure and fantasy and an excellent ensemble cast led by a remarkable film debut by Louise Bourgoin. I would largely ignore the BBFC's advice about the 'sexualised nudity,' as it's patently not the case and the film is suitable for all the family, as long as they don't mind subtitles! With superlatives picture quality, two extremely good soundtracks, plus over an hour of extra features, this is well worth buying. I see little point in purchasing just the DVD release as for a few  Sterling more, you can buy the dual format edition which contains both the Blu-ray and DVD discs. Depending on how much you value packaging will determine whether you buy the standard release in a keep case or the awesome and totally brilliant Limited Collector's Edition SteelBook. Highly Recommended!

A comic book adaptation that's somewhere between The Mummy and The Fifth Element, with some Raiders tossed in, It could have been a whole lot more fun and charming and magical than it is. It's broadly comic, in a very French way, yet never funny, unless maybe you're French. The clunky subtitles don't help. It's hectic and slapstick, yet oddly dull for long stretches. The storytelling is messy and fragmented, even for Besson, so that it takes three-fourths of the running time for the plot to get going finally. Most of the acting is a conscious throwback to French vaudeville and pantomime -- again, I think you'd need to be French not to find it mostly annoying and terribly unfunny. The best characters are Adele, played by the game and lovely Louise Bourgoin, and the wonderful mummies, who don't show up until that three-quarters mark. It looks great, it's got scattered fun moments, the last 30 minutes make you wish the previous hour had been as good, and I'll watch Bourgoin in anything from now on. But it doesn't come close to living up to its magical, fantastical potential.",1416441600,2,1174,4.703883495145631

4430143,4,B004MFT1PO,"Luc Bessons masterpiece entitled The Extordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc-Sec has the viewer intrigued from the moment the opening credits start playing. The determined and exhilarating music makes the viewer wish they were going with Adele on her quest to revive her severely injured and unresponsive sister. Adeles sophisticated character goes to many extremes such as breaking into a prison, stealing a mummy, and collaborating with Dr. Esperandieu who has the power to mentally control a pterodactyl.
This movie was released in April 2010, and has received 4.1 out of five from Amazons ratings. The stunning Adele Blanc-Sec is played by French actress Louis Bourgoin. Even though Jacky Nercessian was sixty years old when he starred in this film as Dr. Esperandieu, the phenomenal make-up crew successfully makes him appear significantly older. Laure de Clemont-Tonnerre plays the sister of Adele, and despite the fact that her character is not very active, she is at the center of the plotline. While watching this movie, the viewer does not understand the logical sequences behind Adeles adventures to revive her sister, but the viewer simply believes she is doing the right things for her young sister to return back to normal functioning.
This movie starts off with Adele traveling to find a mummys tomb with scruffy looking men. The men only care about the treasure while Adele is searching for a mummified doctor who she plans to bring back from the dead. Her hopes are that this primitive doctor will use his ancient healing skills to bring her sister to life. While barely escaping the tomb as it explodes in flames, Adeles adventures have just begun. She needs the help of Dr. Esperandieu to bring the mummy to life, but he is in jail because is associated with the pterodactyl traumatizing the town. After breaking the doctor out of jail, Adele is ready to use the knowledge and power of the doctor to save her sister.
 The soundtrack of this movie is actively played throughout the film. During some moments, the soundtrack is used to complement the scene. For example, the music marches along with Adele and the men as they ride on camel-back toward the mummys tomb. In most parts, the music represents Adeles feelings or actions. An example of this is when Adele is trying to free the doctor from prison. It takes her multiple attempts disguised as different characters to successfully break him out. Each time she enters the prison as a new personality, the soundtrack changes to match it. So, the music is different when she is a sloppy lunch lady at the prison versus when she plays a nun who talks to prisoners.
 This movie should be recommended to others. The Extordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc-Sec would be an excellent family film. This movie is excellent because adults can laugh at the extreme measures of Adele and understand the emotion behind the sisters death.

4430149,4,B004MFT1PO,"This movie is a French spoof of Jules Verne-style science fiction -- or Indiana Jones, if you prefer a cinematic comparison.  Adle Blanc-Sec (""like white wine"") is a globetrotting reporter on a mission to revive her sister from a coma caused by a preposterous accident.  To accomplish her goal, she loots an Egyptian tomb and recruits an oddball scientist/spirit medium.  In the process she has to deal with newly-hatched pterodactyls, evil mad scientists, jailbreaks, crazy big-game hunters, and her frustrated editor.

The movie has a definite French tone, besides being set in Paris.  With six years of French in school, I could understand most of the spoken French -- very clear sound quality -- but the English subtitles were welcome. Some of the jokes are probably funnier in a French context, such as the policeman whose lunch is interrupted over and over.  For me, the movie was for chuckling rather than laughing.  Slapstick and general absurdity abound.  Oh, and the nudity other reviewers mention as having been restored to the director's cut?  Adele is soaking in a bathtub and suddenly sits up with an insight, then gets out of the tub.  Barely R-rated.  The censors need to get a life.

Overall, a lighthearted, fun movie if you like the science fiction/adventure genre.

The pterodactyl unfortunately is a bit wasted - it's more of a device to get to another point in the plot, and more could have been done with it.  The mummies are the high point; it's a pity it takes so long to get to them, as they're a hoot when they show up.  Amazing how Egyptian mummies can speak flawless French...

My dad's favorite film is Raiders of the Lost Ark and he compared this film favorably with it.  The one small caveat I would attach is that there is brief - very brief, blink-and-you'll-miss-it - exposure of female breasts. She's in the bath, that's about as scandalous as the film gets. It's not an overly violent film, it's just a rip-roaring good adventure with an interesting story line.  And, yes, Virginia, there are subtitles. So, if you are completely averse to such movies, then you have been warned. Personally, I'd rather have subtitles than dubbing.

4430167,5,B004MFT1PO,"I found this movie back in 2011 not long after it had come out, mostly because I had read the graphic novels and wanted to see what a movie version looked like. The only version they had then was the French 2010 release in DVD, which I bought. I liked it very much, but in 2013 I saw they released a Blu-ray version, so I bought that version, thinking I'd get the same movie but in a higher quality format.

My original 2010 was 112 minutes long and had both the original French language version that one could watch with or without subtitles, plus it had a dubbed version so I could watch it in English as well. The dubbed version was well done with excellent voice actors.

The Blu-ray version was not the same movie. It had been cut to 107 minutes, even though there was no notice anywhere I could find that mentioned it was edited. I then saw they brought out a Director's Cut Blu-ray, but all that did, as far as I can tell, was restore a few seconds of a scene where Adele is sitting in the bathtub thinking, then stands up and you can see a few seconds of her bare breasts before she turns away. I didn't buy the Director's Cut, but it is listed at 107 minutes as well, so it is still a cut version of the film.

Amazon has this bad habit of applying all the reviews to every version of a movie, so quite often you can't tell which version the reviewer is talking about. Sometimes they mention which version, but most of the time the reviewer does not.

I count 12 versions of this movie for sale by Amazon right now, but only one of them is the original 112 minute uncut version as far as I can tell. If you want that one, it is the DVD that has [France, 2010] in the title and has a cover with a picture of Adele on the left, a picture of the mummy on the right with his hand on the bottom center of the cover, and the pterodactyl flying in the top middle of the cover.

4430174,3,B004MFT1PO,"I have a few of Luc Besson's movies in my library and, when he's good, he's really good. This one, though quite imaginative and full of whimsy, seemed to be aimed more at a younger audience.

Here's the scoop. Adele is woman before her time of the early 20th Century. She's educated, adventurous and aggressive. Her sister is slowly dying from a long hat pin stuck through her head. Adele needs to revive the mummy of a famous Pharaoh's doctor to fix her. But the doctor she uses to revive said mummy accidentally resurrects a Pterodactyl instead. The Pterodactyl wrecks havoc all over Paris and the adventure gets stickier and stickier.

This is a fun film. The period depiction is nifty and the ever spiraling story keeps the viewer on their toes. But I felt as though this were drawn from a children's book (maybe it was) so it seemed too light outing for Besson. These types of adventures have been done before in the ""Indiana Jones"" movies or Stephen Sommers' ""Mummy"" films. They had a bit more gravity. There was a genuine sense of menace in those movies that was absent here. As tense as the story tried to get I couldn't worry for Adele and her cohorts. You knew it would all work out in the end. Don't want to scare the kiddies now do we?

In typical Besson fashion this film has a good look to it. The color palette, set decoration, costuming are all top shelf. He does a fine job directing and the editing and other production values are good. For me this just seemed too old for kids (there were some scenes that were a bit grizzly and some mild sexual references) but too young for adults so it was stuck in the middle. Not a bad movie by any means but not one I'd feel compelled to revisit.",1401148800,,1704,4.4031746031746035

The story and characters are superb. The story is incredibly enjoyable with twists and turns that do not follow the typical Hollywood design (probably because it is not a Hollywood production). Yet it does not fall short of Hollywood standards when it comes to visual effects or editing.

The best part of this entire production is Louise Bourgoin's performance as Miss Adele Blanc-Sec. She is composed elegance mixed with rugged gumption. Adele is a French female Indian Jones, and I love her!

The Director's Cut is the only version I have seen and it is the only version I wish to see.

4430214,5,B004MFT1PO,"Paris, 1912. A prehistoric pterodactyl egg has hatched due to the efforts of a mad scientist, its former occupant wreaking negligible amounts of havoc throughout the city, while the President and a cast of gloriously off-the-wall characters attempt to stop it. Meanwhile, we are introduced to Miss Adele Blanc-Sec, the journalist/adventurer on an expedition to Egypt. Her mission is to locate the mummy of Patmosis, an ancient doctor whose advanced expertise she hopes may revive her ill sister. She has enlisted the help of said mad scientist, one Professor Esperandieu, to aid her in this endeavour... though with the inept Inspector Caponi and big game hunter extraordinaire, Saint-Hubert, ""assisting"" with the investigation into the pterodactyl, things don't quite go according to her plan.

While the entire cast delights, Louise Bourgoin is so superb in the role, that despite the language barrier, she manages to convey the finer points of Miss Blanc-Sec subtleties of character, so that I never felt I was simply reading subtitles, but truly engaged in this movie. The same can really be said for the entire cast, but she was simply marvelous. One needs not understand a word of French to break out into laughter just by the nuances of her tone. And if that were not enough, Adele Blanc-Sec is a female character who exudes intelligence *and* classiness... well, usually.

Based on the French language graphic novel, the 'Extraordinary Adventures', is pure self-indulgent fun which does not for a single instant take itself seriously. The humour here could be accomplished by none other than the French, though possibly if Monthy Python ever produced a mildly steampunkish movie, it might resemble something like this. It was more fun than I have had with a movie in ages, has instantly become one of my favorites, and I am kicking myself over deciding to rent instead of purchase.

4430228,4,B004MFT1PO,"Originally released in 2010, this big-screen adaptation of Jacques Tardi's acclaimed graphic novels is every bit as potent as any of the ones being made in the U.S. from the likes of Rick Riordan, Stephenie Meyer, and others.

In 1912, reporter and adventurer Adele Blanc-Sec embarks on a journey to Egypt to unearth the mummy of Ramses II's personal doctor. Her plan is to bring the mummy back with her to France, where she'll raise him from the dead and ask for his assistance in healing her catatonic sister. Little does she know of the perils awaiting her when she returns to Paris. While she's been away, a 136 million year old egg has hatched in the Natural History Museum. A wild pterodactyl now flies the skies in search of its next meal. Only Adele possesses the knowledge to tame the prehistoric beast.

Director Luc Besson successfully blends together the excitement of adventure movies like ""The Mummy"" and ""Indiana Jones"" with an emotional depth usually only found in foreign romantic dramas. He finds a perfect balance of quirkiness, action, comedy, romance, and crisis. With these ingredients, Besson creates a truly unique fantasy film that will appeal to female and male audiences alike.

Louise Bourgoin is perfect in the role of Adele Blanc-Sec. The role appears to come naturally to the actor, as she hops on the back of a pterodactyl for a ride or falls through the floor of a pyramid inside the coffin of an ancient pharaoh while dressed in a petticoat and bonnet. It's very much like witnessing Mary Poppins work as an archaeologist instead of a nanny.

The special effects and CGI used in ""The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc-Sec"" look just as good, if not better at times, than anything we see in American-made films. The pterodactyl and mummies we see are frighteningly lifelike. This keeps the audience from being taken out of the viewing experience or getting distracted from the storytelling.

The movie is rated PG for some violence, language, brief sensuality, and rude humor. There's really only one scene of a ""dancer"" wiggling around on a man's lap making sensual noises for parents of youngsters to deal with. The rest of the content isn't anything we haven't already seen in a Harry Potter or Indiana Jones film.

""The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc-Sec"" will appeal to fans of Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, and other film adaptations of YA novels. Imagine any of those movies given an injection of French sophistication and classiness and you get a good idea of what to expect. It also puts a female in the lead role of an adventure film, which we don't see very often and will no doubt please many women (and men).",1377561600,2,2668,4.839912280701754

I didn't listen to the English soundtrack, opting instead for the French with English subtitles.  Unfortunately, the English subtitles aren't exactly translations of the French as much as paraphrases.  The French is funnier.  The special effects work seamlessly into the action, and the actors create totally realistic, albeit somewhat farcical parodies of their character types.  Well worth watching.

The dubbing, though done by a servicable lot, reminds me of what I'd expect for a Japanese animated film. Everyone does a good job, but it lacks something of the original (I only watched some scenes in French and I think the actors likely carried it a bit farther in the original). Basically, the dubbing loses some of the color and emotion of the original. It does not appear they made a version with English subtitles, but if that is available I'd go with that.

I think they may have tried to make this a family friendly film. For example, one scene with brief nudity was edited down to a much chaste version. You'd have to be the judge if it is okay for your kids to watch, but the dubbed version refers to naughty things in an arch way. Some kissing, a couple of fellows knocked over by the lead, etc. A few people die off screen and one or two on, but it is done in way that isn't particularly horrible.

4430234,4,B004MFT1PO,"Like the Belgian comic book series ""The Adventures of Tintin,"" ""The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc Sec"" is a beloved comic book series in France. ""Tintin"" became two animated series and a 2011 Steven Spielberg motion-capture Hollywood spectacular, while ""Adele"" was adapted into this more modest (though certainly flashy) French live-action feature in 2010.

This new DVD of ""Adele,"" directed by Luc Beeson (""The Fifth Element""), includes an English dubbed version as well as the original subtitled French language version. The bonus features are in French with English subtitles.

Usually it's not recommended to watch the bonus features first, but in this case, if you're not familiar with the Adele character or the comics, it actually enhances watching the film and gaining excitement for the experience.

Some have compared ""The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc Sec"" to an Indiana Jones movie, and there are indeed some scenes that resemble the first in the film series (Adele runs through a pyramid from an explosion much as Indy ran from the giant ball), but it's a different kind of narrative.

Right from the opening narration, ""Adele"" is a highly polished satirical farce, consistently poking fun at pompous types. There's a bumbling duo in this film that are reminiscent of the spies in ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.""

But there were no pterodactyls or mummies in ""Chitty."" And even though you'll see them in ""Adele"", they may surprise you. Adele herself, as played by Louise Bourgoin, is a bit of a smart aleck. In her turn-of-the-century posh frock, Adele nay resemble Mary Poppins or Truly Scrumptious, but with a more irreverent attitude.

Beeson apparently cast Bourgoin because of her talent for mimicry and ability to play multiple roles. She was also primarily a TV rather than a movie presence so the most audiences would accept her as Adele and not as a big name movie star.

Though the film rambles at times (it's based on two graphic novels), ""Adele"" is a jaunty romp that never takes itself as, say, the recent ""Adventures of Tintin,"" which had humor but had anything but a light touch.

The most serious and heartrending moments in ""Adele"" concern her disabled sister, the freak accident that caused it and how it motivates Adele in her various quests and gives the story a thread.

Speaking of Adele's sister, there are a few deleted scenes in the bonus features that showcase the zany side of the two trouble-prone young ladies in their earlier days. There's also a feature about Bourgoin's singing of the end title song, a peppy tune that has a very European sound, very unlike pop in the U.S., at least of recent years. It's very catchy stuff.",1376524800,7,2684,4.973214285714286

In this movie, there is a huge bird egg in a museum that hasn't hatched. They keep it there for visitors to see. It was never supposed to hatch and one day, it hatches and something that looks like a huge pterodactyl comes out. It screeches and people try to capture it but it is just too fast for them. At one point, a group of people are all lined up to see something in a tomb and they release something, I can't tell you what it is because that will ruin the movie for you. Later, the cops want to hang Adele for things that she has been saying and she is only concerned about finding something to heal her sister. Adele finds a mummy that people think no one can ever find. Then, she talks to it and no one believes her. When the people of the town see the mummy they are really scared. In one part of the movie Adele is in a cave, sees a fire behind her and gets inside a sarcophagus to save herself.

My favorite part in this movie is when the mummy dresses up in a suit and asks someone for directions. The guy says ""of course"" and faints. I really like the music in this film. It's great.

The main characters in this movie are Adele Blanc-sec (Louise Bourgoin), Dieuleveult (Mathieu Amalric), Inspector Albert Caponi (Gilles Lelouche), Justin de Saint-Hubert (Jean Paul Rouve), Marie Joseph Esperandieu (Jacky Nercessian) and Professeur Menard (Philippe Nahon).

This movie's moral message is that no matter what, you should always do whatever is best to help your family and friends.

I recommend this movie to ages 11 to 18 and I suggest you go with your parents because it is really intense. You should really watch this movie if you like adventures.

***Plot SPOILERS alert***

In 1911, intrepid reporter Adle Blanc-Sec (Louise Bourgoin, marvelous) is dispatched to Peru to write a piece on the last Incans. But, in keeping with her own personal agenda, Ms. Blanc-Sec instead journeys to Egypt and unearths the mummified, 5000-year-old remains of what once was an Egyptian physician to Pharaoh Ramesses II. Ms. Blanc-Sec hopes to resurrect the physician mummy. He's her last chance of curing her comatose sister (following a most unfortunate tennis accident).

Back home in Paris, after 135 million years of gestation, a pterodactyl egg hatches and a prehistoric bird is soon terrorizing the City of Light. It's just one more thing intrepid reporter Adle Blanc-Sec must deal with upon her return. First, she requires an aged professor who purports knowledge of bringing the dead back to life. What are the odds that the professor exhibits a psychic link to the pterodactyl? What are the odds he's in prison and sentenced to death? This weighs on intrepid reporter Adle Blanc-Sec only in that his being behind bars just will not do. Sit back and eyeball her several improbable attempts to break him out of stir. It's a nifty sequence that channels Bugs Bunny. For the unflappable Mademoiselle Blanc-Sec (intrepid reporter) it's all in a day's work.

Certain characters in the narrative suspect an anarchist plot but, instead, the ridiculous themes of parapsychology and ancient Egyptian super-science are trotted out. Speaking of these ancient Egyptians, I find these revivified mummies, in their brief appearance, to be even more interesting and engaging than the film's other odd side characters.

Anyway, the cops want to hang her for these things that she has been saying and she needs something to heal her sister. Adele finds a mummy that people think no one can ever find and then she talks to it and tells someone she found it and they don't believe her. The people of the town see the mummy and are really scared. In one part of the movie Adele is in a cave and she sees a fire behind her, and gets inside a sarcophagus to save herself.

My favorite part in this movie is the part where the mummy dresses up in a suit and he asks someone to guide him there and the guy says of course and faints. I really like the music in this film. It's great.

The main characters in this movie are Adle Blanc-sec (Louise Bourgoin), Dieuleveult (Mathieu Amalric), Inspector Albert Caponi (Gilles Lellouche), Justin de Saint-Hubert (Jean Paul Rouve), Marie Joseph Esperandieu (Jacky Nercessian) and le professeur Mnard (Philippe Nahon).

This movie's moral message is that no matter what, you should always do whatever is best to help your family and friends.

I recommend this movie to ages 11 to 18 and I suggest to go with your parents because this movie is really intense. You should really watch this movie if you like adventures. Reviewed by Valdi B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews go to kidsfirst.org",1375315200,,2129,4.420918367346939

You really have no clue where the movie is going, which is really what half the fun is. The movie is beautifully done and the cinematography is simply stunning. On top of this there is some great acting in this as well. There is a ton of action throughout and the movie kept me engaged from beginning to end. In looking further into this movie, I have to say that I had no clue that the movie had a tie to a graphical novel series, but now in seeing this I looked further into this and the novels were great too. Overall, I was really impressed with the movie and the acting and you will be too!

4430240,3,B004MFT1PO,"While I'm not familiar with the books that this movie is based on, it does make me curious about them.  Instead of introducing the main character (or plot) right away the movie starts off slowly by introducing the supporting characters and their roles in this early 1900's adventure.  The special effects and visuals are top notch though I find many of the characters have exaggerated features. The audio is a mixed bag with the obvious dubbing and the narrators volume should have been normalized to make it blend in with the movie a bit more.  The background music is enchanting and makes me wish I could understand the French lyrics.  The voice acting is good and the English translation is spot on with swearing and all.  The movie is rated PG and has some (fully clothed) passionate scenes and violence.  Younger kids may get frightened with the walking and talking mummies, but those were the highlight of the film.",1374019200,,921,4.761006289308176
4430241,3,B004MFT1PO,"I was really looking forward to seeing ""Adele Blanc-Sec"" back in 2010 when I first saw the trailer.  However, the movie was never distributed in theaters in the US.  Probably because it's just not a very good movie.  There are a few sequences during the film that redeem it.  While I watched the tennis match scene I thought that if more of the movie could be as good as this part, then we'd have a pretty good action comedy.  It's a shame, too.  It could have been a refreshing and fun addition to the genre.
The middle of the movie felt like it dragged.  The star was very beautiful, but other characters would appear in such heavy makeup that it seemed like she was acting opposite a collection of puppets.  Other visual elements of the movie felt right.  It's set in an interesting to look at period in Paris.  Some of the sets and props are visually interesting and feel like things I haven't seen before.  This copy is dubbed in English, and I don't think the process of dubbing helped the jokes.
It felt long.  I've watched other movies by this director over and over again.  After finishing ""Adele Blanc-Sec"" I was sure I'd never watch it again.  But I was glad to have sated my curiosity because I am a Luc Besson completist.",1370995200,,1234,4.426666666666667
4430242,4,B004MFT1PO,I wasn't sure if this would be worthwhile but because I like the director I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised.  Entertaining movie.,1358640000,2,140,4.833333333333333
4430243,3,B004MFT1PO,"I liked this movie for the most part.  What works in the movie is all the characters and actors except one.  Unfortunately, the one happens to be the lead character / actress.  Who the heck knows how in the world she got the part.  Not only is she boring, but she is also unlikable.  Luckily, many of the other characters are quite interesting and well-acted.  Such as the two professors, the detective, and the portly man, the government men, among others.  While the lead actress just sucks the life out of every scene, the other actors still provide a reason to watch.

The special effects are good (except for the bit with A riding the P).  Probably a good lesson for the director that if a special effect does not work, either cut the scene, or roll up your sleeves and try again.  The settings are good.  The mood and humor are very European of course.  Parts of the movie will also remind the viewer somewhat of Jeunet.  By the way, those who like period fantasy like this should also enjoy Vidocq with Gerald. Depardieu.",1356998400,2,1028,4.491891891891892
4430244,4,B004MFT1PO,"After seeing this film, I find myself wondering why there wasn't a wider release in the US. It's an incredibly creative story. Louise Bourgoin is outstanding as Adele Blanc-sec, a fast talking, quick witted adventurer/archaeologist. It had some rather campy CGI in it, but it was easily ignorable. This particular edition had a few typos in the subtitles, but other than that, I enjoyed this immensely.",1356220800,,402,5.106060606060606

Directed by Luc Besson, (who is also behind&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fifth-Element/dp/B000S6BKSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fifth Element</a>, which should tell you a lot about this film's visual flair), ""The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc-Sec"" is whimsical in nature and frenetic in pace, and the heroine pulls off things that make Indiana Jones's survival of a nuclear explosion by hiding in a fridge seem plausible. It's great.

Set in Paris, 1911, Adele is a French explorer and journalist scouring the globe for a cure to her sister's catatonia (brought on by a hat-pin to the brain, though I'll let you see the exact circumstances of this for yourself). Against her publisher's wishes, she heads to Egypt in order to uncover the tomb of Padmosis, said to have been the physician to Ramses II. But what good is a doctor who has been dead for thousands of years? Well, it turns out that Adele is friends with an old professor who has unlocked the secret to resurrecting the dead. While Adele is away, he decides to practice his technique by hatching a pterodactyl egg from the prehistoric museum. By the time Adele returns to Paris, the pterodactyl is terrorizing the citizens of the city and the hunt is on to shoot it down. So Adele's plan is simple: find the pterodactyl, rescue Professor Esp&eacute;randieu from his impending execution, have him bring Padmosis back to life, and then ask Padmosis to heal her sister. Obviously, it's all easier said than done.

Adele makes for a wonderful heroine. Though she encompasses all the usual elements of a typical action heroine: vivaciousness, charm, determination, and dry wit, she also manages to display a few surprising traits as well - namely impatience and rudeness. Adele has things to do, things that need doing *right now*, and if a porter or a cab driver or a camel is going too slowly for her liking, then they'll get an earful. She's very rarely friendly to anyone unless they're giving her what she wants, and she races from one situation to the next without any regard for either manners or the law. Yet she somehow manages to make it hilarious, for her charm and liveliness making her behaviour endearing rather than irritating - especially when you take into account actress Louise Bourgoin's sly little smile. Nothing else exists for Adele but her mission to heal her sister, and there's a telling exchange with a nemesis in the opening sequence in which she's asked whether she plans to steal Padmosis in order to heal of mankind. She answers: ""no, just my sister.""

The film is also a visual feast for the eyes, with imaginative camera-work, detailed set-pieces, beautiful costumes and gorgeous cinematography (courtesy of Thierry Arbogast, another alumnus from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fifth-Element/dp/B000S6BKSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fifth Element</a>). Only the computerized special effects are a little dodgy, but they don't last long and they're certainly not the focus of the story. It's also littered with an array of minor characters who weave in and out of Adele's story, helping or hindering her on her quest, giving us the sense that the world she inhabits is rich and full, involving more people and stories than just her own. In this, it's rather reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amelie/dp/B004SEUIXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amelie</a>, whereas the visual style and odd plotting gives it the air of a live-action&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hayao-Miyazaki/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hayao Miyazaki</a>&nbsp;film.

I would consider the film appropriate for children, depending on how they can handle the task of reading subtitles and what parents may think of a (very) brief nude scene of Adele in the bath, but for the most part there's no reason to think that a child wouldn't enjoy all the colour and excitement on display here.

Naturally, I recommend ""The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc-Sec"" for its twisty plot, great heroine and beautiful visuals. (Oh, and the mummies at the end that nearly steal the show).

He never repeats his films, but they all
surprise and tickle in different ways

THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF ADELE BLANC-SEC
is a strangely sweet movie. Based on the historical
gaslamp fantasy comic series by Jacques Tardi, it features a feisty French
adventuress who's seeking a ""cure"" for her
catatonic twin sister.  (Said sister became catatonic
while playing an increasingly spirited game of
tennis, getting hit by a tennis ball
and falling on her hairpin.  But never mind that.)

In her quest for a cure, Adele steals a mummy, rides a
pterodactyl by moonlight (nice hommage to ET),
frees the Pharaoh and his mummified entourage
to enjoy a midnight ramble through Paris, and finally
takes a voyage...into oblivion?

This gentle kid flick from Mr. Besson did bring
a smile or two, a quiet laugh now and then.
Definitely recommended for Besson fans.  Now I suppose
