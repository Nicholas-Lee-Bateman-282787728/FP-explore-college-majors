Little we know of these resilient people which deserve all our respect.",1446940800,2,355,5.454545454545454

If you just saw the cover of the DVD or brief synopsis from some professional reviews, you may assume this program is specifically about the oppression of the Roma (gypsy) people during WWII.  In fact, that is not the case.  It covers a great deal of ground in a brief period run time.  Systematic annihilation of Roma people has taken place many times in history.  More recently, oppression of Roma people has become easier since the fall of many totalitarian regimes allowing the rise of neo-Nazi or other hate groups.  Many parallels are drawn with other events of genocide in recent history such as in Bosnia, Darfur, and Rwanda.  This is used to illustrate how people and governments use various excuses to track, oppress, deport, and even kill a population. Nevertheless, this program is about the Roma and Americans will find it very helpful to understand the ""gypsy"" people.  Something we little understand.

For those looking specifically for a WWII story, you may be just a little disappointed.  However, there are brief mentions early on and a period half way through the program where extensive interviews of individuals recounting their experiences are given.  These interviews are mostly include memories of concentration camps and even one man's account of sitting in DR Mengele's chair as a little boy.  I have to admit, I am not sure his description of the experiment is anatomically possible and still survive.  I don't doubt it was a horrific experience though.  The devastation of Roma communities was an eye opener.  Though the number of Roma killed in WWII is estimated at 500,000 (a small number compared to Jews), the percentage on the other hand represented 90% of the population in some countries compared to estimates of 40-60% of Jews (according to the figures in the documentary).

One of the most moving takeaways I had from this program was that fascist regimes or oppressive governments in the west are often devised by the educated class and sold to the ignorant in order to oppress the targeted group.  That is a little simplistic and not 100% accurate, but the spirit of the message is very important that these things happen in enlightened and educated cultures.  The program can run slow at points but I still think it has very valuable points.  I suggest a rental.",1416960000,3,2403,4.9181141439205955
