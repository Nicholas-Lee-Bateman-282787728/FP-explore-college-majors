2205308,1,B0007939Q6,"I'm a big fan of Scooby but these episodes were played to death on cartoon network especially The Harlem Globetrotters and Laurel and Hardy.i wouldn't be surprised this is all the Scooby movies they put out, I mean the Tom and Jerry Collection wasn't complete and Uncut which totally sucks. Here's something that's strange Hanna Barbera put out the classic cartoons why cant they put out the new cartoons like The Addams Family cartoon that was shown in the early Nineties and Bill and Teds Excellent Adventures. Also were is the Smurfs MR T Dragons Lair and Space Ace and Pacman along with Saturday supercade and The 13 Ghosts Of Scooby Doo. Never mind what they want to put out they should listen to what the fans want instead were the ones that buy them.",1110326400,5,757,4.614814814814815
2205309,5,B0007939Q6,"I've always been a big Scooby Doo fan ever since the show first premiered in 1969 when I was just 6 years old.  In 1972, ""Scooby Doo, Where are You?""  became ""The New Scooby Doo Movies"".  The show was now an hour long instead of 30 minutes and each episode had the gang meet a new guest star each week.  This format lasted from 1972 through 1973 and featured 24 total episodes along with a Halloween special.  Unfortunately, instead of giving us ALL 25 episodes, Warner Home Video has chosen to give us a ""best of"" collection of 15 episodes.  Why not do all of them is a mystery for Scooby and the gang but I guess beggars cannot be choosers.

""Ghastly Ghost Town"" guest stars the Three Stooges.  The gang is forced to seek help on foot in the desert after their van is forced onto a sand dune by a low-flying, king-sized bat. They come across Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly-Joe DeRita, whose amusement park is really the one in need of help.

""The Dynamic Scooby Doo Affair"" with Batman & Robin.  When The Mystery Machine breaks the gang bump into smugglers, Batman and Robin, a little old lady, and a punching clown filled with counterfeit cash. A tip leads them to the carnival. . .where they find Joker and Penguin behind the kooky counterfeit caper. As is usually the case with these villainous villains, our heroes wind up in a funhouse hideout.

 ""The Frickert Fracas"" with Jonathan Winters.  Hoping they will have a vacation from haunted houses and spooky characters when Jonathan Winters invites them to stay at Maude Frickert's farm, Scooby-Doo and company soon learn differently when the place becomes overrun with vandalizing scoundrels and living scarecrows.

""Guess who's Knott Coming to Dinner?"" with Don Knotts.  When the gang stop at Moody Manor to get directions, they find themselves mistaken for Captain Moody's neices and nephews by an assortment of characters who all resemble Don Knotts.

""The Spooky Fog"" - with Don Knotts.  A spoof of Knott's show Mayberry R.F.D, wherein a unique form of small-town hospitality is in store for Scooby-Doo and pals when officer Don Knotts invites them to spend the night at the best hotel in Juneberry: the local jail!

""The Ghost of Bigfoot"" with Laurel & Hardy.  While visiting a ski lodge, the gang run into bellhops Laurel and Hardy, who attempt to help the gang uncover the mystery of the ghost of Bigfoot... but Laurel and Hardy are even more cowardly than Scooby and Shaggy.

""The Ghost of the Red Baron"" with the Three Stooges. The gang re-teams with the Three Stooges to ground the ghost of Baron Ludwig von Richtofen, The Red Baron, the evildoer of daring who has scared off all of Mr. Sawyer's crop dusting pilots in an effort to pressure the farmer into leaving his land.

""Ghostly Creeps from the Deep"" with the Harlem Globetrotters.  Scooby and the gang run across the clown princes of basketball, The Harlem Globetrotters on the eerie banks of a haunted swamp so that their boosted team spirit might protect them from the supernatural spirits being released by the ghost of Redbeard The Pirate.

""The Caped Crusader Caper"" with Batman & Robin.  In Batman and Robin's second appearance on this series, Scooby and the gang try to foil Joker and Penguin's attempts to steal a flying suit from a goofy scientist.

""The Lochness Mess"" with the Harlem Globetrotters.  The Gang travel to a small New England town to visit Shaggy's Uncle Nathaniel but walk into the middle of a mystery complete with the ghost of Paul Revere and a spooky sea serpent. With the aid of The Harlem Globetrotters, they uncover a plot whereby Morgan, a local crook, is trying to scare the townsfolk into moving away in order to hide his discovery of a treasure ship.

""The Mystery of the Haunted Island"" - The Globetrotters are back again.  The gang and the Trotters are taken by a spectral ship to a deserted island.  They take refuge in a deserted mansion where statues come to life, books fly off the shelves, and ghosts and secret passages are everywhere.

""The Exterminator"" with Don Adams.  The gang pick up Don Adams who is running an extermination business and take him to his next job at Horror Hill, an eerie, foreboding-looking ramshackle which is also the home of old horror film star Lorne Chumley.

""The Weird Winds of Winona"" - with Speed Buggy!  The Mystery Machine breaks down and the gang find themselves running into Speed Buggy and his friends. It's up to the two gangs to discovery the mystery of the winds that blow through the town that they've been stranded in.

""The Haunted Candy Factory"" with Mama Cass.  Mama Cass, Scooby-Doo and company are caught in a ""sticky mess"" at her namesake candy factory when two green cotton candy globs attempt to ""cover"" stolen gold bullion with caramel, chocolate and nuts.

""The Haunted Carnival"" with Dick Van Dyke.  The gang takes a trip to the carnival to escape their ghost-chasing troubles, only to find Dick Van Dyke owns and operates the park. . .which is haunted.

I'm not sure how Warner's chose these particular episodes.  Maybe there was something to do with obtaining the rights to shows with other guest stars.  I would have preferred to see the episodes which featured the Adams Family, Phyllis Diller and Tim Conway myself as opposed to all the Globetrotter shows, Speed Buggy and Mama Cass.  This set is aimed at us baby boomers since most kids today are not going to have any idea who people like Don Adams and Mama Cass are but they are still fun and I've not seen many of these in over 30 years.  Great to see these on DVD!  Actors doing voices for animated films and shows is quite common today but it wasn't so common back then and it's fun to see animated versions of these great comics with their own voices.",1110153600,169,5736,4.671314741035856
2205310,3,B0007939Q6,"I grew up watching the Scooby-Doo Movies and I was so happy to hear that the series was finally coming out on DVD....that is until I found out that they only included 15 out of the original 25 episodes. Some of the episodes Warner Bros decided to omit were my favorites...including the ones with the Sonny and Cher, Addams Family, Phyllis Diller,Davy Jones and Jeannie. Instead what they did was include 4 episodes that they had already released on DVD 2 years ago( the Harlem Globetrotters and the Batman episodes). What a rip off! People at Warner Bros. if you're reading this , I just want to say one thing.....in the future when releasing the other scooby doo series on DVD, don't give us another ""Best of"" just give us the complete series!  And please do release the rest of this Series sometime soon...I still ccan't believe you edited out Sonny and Cher!",1109289600,18,861,4.627450980392157
2205311,4,B0007939Q6,"doing something I hate that others do on this site - reviewing a dvd that hasn't been released yet and I have not viewed.

I would like to say that the Scooby Doo Movies featuring the guest stars were my favorites.  So I will definitely buy this....my daughter is also a big Scooby fan.  My only complaint is that if you are going to make a box set of the movies with Guest Stars put them all on the disc.  I can't understand why they haven't included them all.  I would think if they were going to do this they would call this Vol. 1 - it is not.",1109116800,6,547,3.981651376146789
2205312,3,B0007939Q6,"I gave this 3 stars because I am a huge Scooby fan and was a really disappointed to see the episodes that make up this DVD set. Heres the break down:

Disc 1

The Ghastly Ghost Town (with The Three Stooges)

The Dynamic Scooby Doo Affair (with Batman & Robin)

The Frickert Fracas (with Jonathan Winters)

Guess Who's Knott Coming to Dinner (with Don Knotts)

Disc 2

The Spooky Fog (with Don Knotts)

The Ghost of Bigfoot (a.k.a. ""Scooby-Doo Meets Laurel & Hardy"")

The Ghost of The Red Baron (with The Three Stooges)

The Ghostly Creeps from the Deep (with The Harlem Globetrotters)

Disc 3

The Caped Crusader Caper (with Batman & Robin)

The Lochness Mess (with The Harlem Globetrotters)

The Mystery of Haunted Island (with The Harlem Globetrotters)

The Exterminator (with Don Adams)

Disc 4

The Weird Winds of Winona (with Speed Buggy)

The Haunted Candy Factory (with ""Mama"" Cass Elliot)

The Haunted Carnival (a.k.a. ""Scooby-Doo Meets Dick Van Dyke"")

Don't forget that this has some ""Stardusted"" special features, probably found on the fourth disc:

Featurette: The Hanna-Barbera Kennel Club Roasts Scooby-Doo

Featurette: Uptown With Scooby-Doo and The Harlem Globetrotters

Featurette: The Girls Rock!

I am just glad they are releasing this series but if I made a best of compilation, I would have picked one episode of the returning guests (i.e. one harlem globetrotter rather than all three since these episodes have been previously released on DVD). This way I could include the great guest episodes like Sonny and Cher, Josie and the Pussycats, Phyllis Diller, Davey Jones, Addams Family, Sandy Duncan and Jerry Reed. These episodes I feel far surpass the Don Adams, Dick Van Dyke, the ""Guess Who's Knott Coming to Dinner (with Don Knotts)"", ""The Ghost of The Red Baron (with The Three Stooges)"", ""The Mystery of Haunted Island (with The Harlem Globetrotters)"" and the Laurel and Hardy episodes.",1106784000,627,1913,5.019108280254777
2205313,2,B0007939Q6,"After the extras-light release of the first and second seasons of the original Scooby Doo Where are You, you might have expected the Scooby box-sets to continue in a similar vein ie. the good shows.  Instead we are given 'the best of (bad news for completists) The New (hardly) Scooby Doo Movies (oh, dear)'.

The 'special' guests with a few exceptions will be unrecognisable to modern audiences (Who is Speed Buggy daddy? Mom, do you know who Phyllis Diller is?) and the show, even in the 1970's was pretty weak.

Extras have yet to be announced but apparently there is some sort of decoder competition type thing - obviously to get you to buy the thing.

I had hoped that the releases would have continued with the basic Scooby Doo mystery shows instead of moving on to the gimicky ones but at leaset we are still being spared Scrappy Doo!",1106697600,4,841,4.586666666666667
2205314,1,B0007939Q6,"So far I've been very pleased with the Hanna-Barbera collections, but this is really a poor choice. There were 24 one-hour episodes of ""The New Scooby-Doo Movies"" produced, there are 15 on this set, what about the other 9 episodes? Will there be a second volume? Why didn't they just add a fifth two-sided disc and give us the complete series? BOOOOO!",1104796800,16,351,4.67741935483871
2205315,3,B0007939Q6,"I got these for the kids, but also out of nostalgia. Sadly the show doesn't transfer well to digital format  and it had a very jerky quality to it",1515196800,,146,4.0344827586206895
2205316,3,B0007939Q6,"I don't understand of I bought this new or used. I wouldn't have mind buying used if it was marketed that way. The discs are not scratched but the box is completely beat up and pieces from the inside fell right off.

I know it says the ""best of"" this show but reading the episode guide on the box it looks like they are missing plenty of great episodes. I want the ones where they meet the Adams family, Josie and the Pussycats, Jeanie, Sandy Duncun. It looks like they have some good episodes and some I don't remember watching as a kid but why wouldnt they make a collection with all of the videos on them?

I will have to give more of an update after I watch the dvds.",1515110400,3,671,4.114503816793893
2205317,2,B0007939Q6,"We got these for our eight year old, who loves the Scooby gang, and found they haven't aged well. Fred makes sexist comments and assumptions that go unchallenged, the Cass Elliot episode is one long fat joke, and much of the humor is intended to come from pop culture references she doesn't know. If looking for classic Scooby, I'd recommend buying The Scooby Doo show, which she enjoys a lot more, instead.",1514592000,,407,4.666666666666667
2205318,5,B0007939Q6,"These 43 minute episodes feature famous guest stars like Don Knotts, Dick Van Dyke, Don Adams, Cass Elliot (Mama Cass), the Harlem Globetrotters, Batman & Robin (with the Penguin & Joker as villains), the Three Stooges (not the real voices of Moe, Larry, and Curly Joel), and Laurel & Hardy (not the real actors voices) as well as others.

There are some episodes missing due to licensing fees. You won't find the Addams Family or Jeannie here unfortunately. The episodes in this collection come from the two seasons broadcast in 1972-73.

Special features include trailers of various cartoons like The Flintstones, 9 minute spotlight of Thelma & Daphne, and a couple of other 2005 featurettes with stars of that year reflecting on Scooby Doo for a few minutes.",1513468800,2,761,4.9375

2205417,4,B0007939Q6,"It was hard to decide whether to rate this product four or five stars.  I love Scooby Doo and it is great to be able to watch this great series again.  However it is not complete.  How wonderful it would be to have the complete series, particularly as some of the missing episodes are also among my favourites, including the ones starring Davey Jones, Phyllis Diller and Jerry Reed.  Nevertheless fifteen episodes are better than none, and the ones included are still great fun and bring back many happy memories of when I was a kid.  What I particularly loved about the New Scooby Doo Movies is that the episodes were each an hour long instead of the usual half an hour.  They were double the fun, especially with such guest stars as Don Knotts, the Three Stooges, the Harlem Globetrotters and Laurel and Hardy.",1431129600,,812,4.56551724137931
2205418,3,B0007939Q6,"I've always been a Scooby Doo fan, and am especially attached to the older shows from the 60's-80's, and had to add this to my Hanna Barbera Collection. I like the episodes on it, but a good portion of the ones I really liked are missing from it. Yes, I can understand that they couldn't get the rights to put the episodes having Davey Jones, Sandy Duncan, Sunny and Cher and a few others, but not having Josie and the Pussycats and Jeannie and Babu? What, the company couldn't get the rights to put their own creations on the set? I would have liked to see some extras such as seeing what it's like working with some of the actors, but again, they probably couldn't put it due to not being able to come to negotiations with the actors or their families.

As a Hanna Barbera/Scooby Doo fan I suggest getting it, but to complete the set, you might want to fire up your DVR.",1430265600,,872,4.284848484848485

2205453,4,B0007939Q6,"We love scooby!  The only reason I give this set a four star review is because it only has selected episodes on it.

2205464,3,B0007939Q6,"I don't want anyone to misunderstand this... What is included is great, but unfortunately many of the original shows were left out by Warner... I am sure they have their reasons but for the price of this collection, it is very hard to give more than 3 stars. Especially when the shows omitted are some of the best ones...

If it were half the price I would give it 4 stars, and if it were complete I would give it 5. That said, I still think this is worth having if you are a Scooby fan. My kids love it, and it is nice to have longer episodes; especially ones without Scrappy! This is all pre-Scrappy, and it is fun having so many stars thrown in with the gang.",1395705600,4,662,4.131782945736434

It could be possible that many of the celebrities (or their estates for the deceased ones like Jerry Reed and Sonny Bono) featured on the show may not have given their permission to use their voices or likenesses for home video release. Or they could have asked for too much money in royalties to be worth it. In the 60's and 70's no one could have imagined that people in the future would be able to buy whole seasons of TV shows to watch at home on small shiny discs.,1387497600,2,539,4.294117647058823
2205488,5,B0007939Q6,These is my favorite series from the Scooby-Doo series when I was a kid. I used to watch these a lot on Cartoon Network as a kid in the 90's they decided to move all their old classics to Boomerang their sister channel.,1387324800,3,219,4.116279069767442
2205489,5,B0007939Q6,"I purchased this collection back in the spring and I have watched it numerous times. The program, as it aired on TV, featured a much different opening sequence. The sequence I grew up seeing featured the various guest stars/celebrities appearing in the opening, too, but the sequence that appears in the openings of the cartoons featured on this project feature scenes taken from various episodes found on the collection.

Before going any further, one thing I should mention, this project is clearly titled The Best of The New Scooby-Doo Movies on both the DVD box and in the description on Amazon's product page. If a potential customer purchases this and EXPECTS the ENTIRE series and is therefore disappointed that all the episodes aren't included, it's the customer's fault for not reading the title of what they were purchasing.

That being said, there are 15 full length episodes of the hour-long series. Minus commercial breaks that occur on TV, the hour episodes are essentially 40-45 minutes each. The 15 episodes are spread out among 4 discs. There are four episodes on the first four discs and three episodes on the fourth disc. A minor quibble from me is the erroneous labeling of 2 of the celebrities. Once you purchase the collection and take it out of it's box you'll see various illustrations. There is a section titled All-Star Cast and it has the guest stars faces in front of images of stars. The people that put the collection together show the faces of Laurel and Hardy...but they have the names listed under the wrong person. Underneath Stan Laurel's face it reads 'Hardy' and underneath Oliver Hardy's face it reads 'Laurel'. Hardy is the one that had the small mustache. Laurel is the thin one.

I liked all of the episodes but the ones that I liked the most are the 2 episodes with Batman and Robin (the Professor Flaky character is hilarious); the 2 episodes with Don Knotts; the three guest starring The Harlem Globetrotters; the Jonathan Winters episode; the Speed Buggy episode and the episodes featuring The Three Stooges. In ""Spooky Fog"", Scooby and the gang find themselves in Juneberry (a parody of Mayberry, but set in the West). Don Knotts portrays the local deputy and the sheriff is named Dandy Griffith (!). In Don's other episode, ""Guess Who's Not Coming to Dinner"", he goes through a series of disguises in a haunted house setting...believing Scooby and the gang to be bad guys...but he ends up revealing himself to be a private detective on a case involving an eccentric's fortune.

Batman and Robin appear in an episode involving Joker and Penguin participating in a counterfeit operation. Scooby and the gang assist the super heroes and everything comes to a conclusion inside a house that literally flips upside down. In the Dynamic Duo's other guest appearance, Joker and Penguin have to be stopped from stealing an inventor's flying suit invention. That episode features a character named Professor Flaky who often jumbles up his words while nervous. ""This is a kine fettle of kish"" translates to ""this is a fine kettle of fish""; ""Net Nocessarily"" translates to ""not necessarily""; ""Do-namic Dye-O"" translates to ""Dynamic Duo"", etc. etc.

Jonathan Winters portrays himself and voices a character based on his Maude Frickert creation in ""The Frickert Fracas"". It's in this episode that Maude tells Fred that he reminds her of her idol, Glen Campbell. The episode's plot revolves around a magical formula that supposedly causes chickens and other animals to grow to an enormous size. The formula turns out to be a hoax, though.

One of the more surreal episodes happens when Scooby and the gang team up with Speed Buggy and his human friends. It's surreal in the fact that Scooby-Doo (the original 1969-1971 series) spawned a long list of mystery solving cartoons from Hanna-Barbera throughout the '70s and into the early '80s and it's fascinating/surreal to see both sets of mystery solving characters share the same screen time. Tinker, a character in the Speed Buggy franchise, could pass as Shaggy's brother or cousin. Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Velma, and Daphne pair up with Speed Buggy, Tinker, Mark, and Debby to solve the mystery of a howling wind in a town called Winona in an episode titled ""The Weird winds of Winona"".

That kind of thing happened in another episode, not featured in this DVD collection, which had Scooby and the gang meeting Josie and the Pussycats. The thing that made that episode more surreal is the fact that Scooby's original concept, a group of teenage musicians solving mysteries between rock and roll performances, eventually became the premise of Josie and the Pussycats and the concept would later re-surface in the Jabberjaw series. In these three cartoons: Josie and the Pussycats, Speed Buggy, and Jabberjaw, there were characters that could pass as relatives to Shaggy: Alexander Cabot, Tinker, and Clam Head.

It would be something of dishonesty to say that I don't mind that all the episodes aren't here. I DO wish that a complete series had become available by now (it's been 8 years since this collection made it's debut in 2005) but knowing that this collection is a Best Of release, I knew going into it that all of the episodes wouldn't be available. A lot of my favorite episodes ARE on this collection...only a couple aren't. The one guest starring Jerry Reed is great...as is the one guest starring Sonny and Cher...but apparently a release featuring all of the episodes will never, ever come to be...and this is the only commercially available project of this particular series of Scooby-Doo episodes, too.",1384732800,32,5600,4.95

Die hard Scooby Doo fans who have already acquired the original Scooby Doo Where Are You, The Scooby Doo Show, Scooby Doo Dynomutt Hour, and What's New Scooby Doo, and a series of DVD films.

What is best thing to appreciate about this collection?
The animation style and quality most near Scooby Doo Where Are You.  Its an extension of that series before its gradual changes first noticed in The Scooby Doo Show before its present ADD friendly pacing with What's New Scooby Doo.

What is the worst thing about the collection?
The script and voice acting are repetitious and often a bore.  There is a lot of silence between lines to stretch out running time while many of the gags and jokes are lame by the original Scooby Doo Where are You? standards.  Some cuts seem looped and I can take so much Mama Cass food jokes, rest her soul.

What makes this collection different?
As the theme of the series, the angle was the use of guest stars, from real actors (such as Don Knotts), real actors late in their careers or near death (Three Stooges), real actors that have long passed on (Laurel and Hardy), fictional characters (Batman and Robin), to talking race cars.

Rate the collection
As novel and wonderful to see the gang, the episodes struggle to fill an hour of TV time.  The writing gets bogged down in repetitive scenes and dialog that goes nowhere.  There are painful pauses between lines of dialog that evaporates the mystique experienced in any other Scooby series.  Still, some episodes such as the Batman and Robin are mildly entertaining.

Why the Best of?  Where's the rest?
Lawyers, those wonderful people who make sure we live in a world with a level playing field.  You don't know it, but you really do benefit by having episodes erased from history as if they never existed.  The truth lies in rights and monies involving the episodes with certain characters not getting enough dough-ray-me.  So bad, the opening sequence was re-edited.  No, Scooby wasn't scared of the Adams Family, he was running from a ghostly knight with a lance.

How much is this worth?
Not the original $55+.  An executive, too delusional, was wearing a tie too tight.  He probably hated Scooby.  Anyhow, the price has dropped considerably.  Though, at the time of this review was posted, it has climbed up a few dollars.  If you wonder why, there is a Cartoon Network promotion inside that is at least seven years old!  Seven years.  My DVD was in a warehouse unsold for seven years before it made it to me.  Talk about an inflated price point!  (The promotion has expired BTW)

If you love Scooby Doo, its time to get and relive your childhood while sharing it with your children.

I love Scooby Doo. At least I love the original Scooby Doo mysteries. I could vaguely remember the New Scooby Doo Movies with the Harlem Globetrotters and Don Knotts. However, after watching some of these episodes, especially the ones featuring the Three Stooges and Laurel and Hardy, I realized why I only remembered the HGT and Don Knotts.

2205544,3,B0007939Q6,"This is how a failed attempt to obtaining rights can go. This ""The Best of 'The New Scooby-Doo Movies'"" DVD set was released because Warner Bros. could not get the rights to use the images of the following characters: The Addams Family, Sonny & Cher, Josie and the Pussycats, Phyllis Diller, Sandy Duncan, Davy Jones, Jerry Reed, the cast of Jeannie (the animated sitcom), & Tim Conway. All together the complete 2 seasons of ""The New Scooby-Doo Movies"" would have a total of 24 episodes all running an hour long each.

Even a new opening was created to uphold the rights by removing the following characters from the opening: The Addams Family, Batman & Robin, The Globetrotters, The Three Stooges, and Laurel & Hardy. The interesting thing is the last 4 mentioned (Batman & Robin, The Globetrotters, The Three Stooges, and Laurel & Hardy) were in this DVD set.

All in all this is an okay DVD set with great mysteries containing 15 episodes of the characters that were still able to be used (Don Knotts, The Three Stooges, Batman & Robin, Laurel & Hardy, The Globetrotters, Dic Van Dyke, Cass Elliot and Don Adams.) Some of the guest stars appear in more then one episode but still fun to watch.

It is more then likely that this will be the only DVD released of the series so if you are a Scooby-Doo collector this is something you want to include in your collection.",1250035200,11,1370,4.60655737704918
2205545,2,B0007939Q6,"I was lucky enough to find this (used) at a flea market. Before I begin the actual review, I realize that the box clearly reads ""Best of...;"" which means, for whatever reason, that it will be incomplete.

First and foremost, why Warner Brothers Home Video and HB chose to edit the great introduction, I may never understand (if someone has an actual, feasible answer, I'd be willing to hear it).

Also, this is just me personally, but I didn't think that it was necessary to include all three guest appearances by the Globetrotters (among other reasons, all three of these episodes were already released to DVD). Besides, repeat appearances(Three Stooges, Don Knotts, Globetrotters, etc.) took up nine of fifteen episodes on the discs and left out room for, in my opinion, far superior episodes like ""Mystery in Persia,"" ""Haunted Showboat,"" ""Phantom of the Country Music Hall,"" (Jeannie, Josie, and Jerry Reed, respectively,) and ""...Meets the Addams Family.""

That being said, I appreciated the inclusion of the ""Batman & Robin"" episodes (again, maybe one would have done) and ""The Weird Winds of Winnona"" (Speed Buggy). Also, ""Ghastly Ghost Town"" (The 3 Stooges) was a better episode than I remembered.

Of course, people are going to disagree with my personal picks for the series and therein lies the problem with a ""Best of..."" collection. We don't know what Warner Brothers used as a measure for the ""best"" episodes and, for all we know, they named it ""Best of..."" because ""These-are-the-episodes-we-were-willing-to-pay-for..."" wouldn't fit on the box cover. BTC/BCI (the company responsible for the DVD relases of Filmation's cartoon catalogue) released a lot of best of collections but always as a precursor for the full series. I realize that ""The Best of the Scooby Movies"" was released several years ago now, but there is always still hope for us Scooby fans.

That being said, if found for a decent price, it's clearly a nice selection of cartoons for collectors to enjoy, considering that they are willing to overlook the nuances of the heavily edited opening sequence and the episode selection.",1247961600,6,2108,5.08092485549133

Like most 80's kids, I grew up enjoying Scooby-Doo and many other Hanna-Barbera characters. The Best of the New Scooby-Doo Movies is a nice collection of episodes from the popular TV series. I regret that either more collections and/or the entire 2-season set of The New Scooby-Doo Movies hasn't been released.

According to Wikipedia:
""Upon attempting to release The New Scooby-Doo Movies on DVD in 2005, Warner Home Video was unable to negotiate agreements with several of the episodes' guest stars to have those episodes included in the DVD set. As a result, the DVD was released under the title The Best of the New Scooby-Doo Movies, and features fifteen episodes culled from both seasons.

Furthermore, the images of The Addams Family, Batman & Robin, The Globetrotters, The Three Stooges, and Laurel & Hardy were voluntarily removed from The New Scooby-Doo Movies' opening titles, as their rights were controlled by their copyright owners. In Batman and Robin's case, this is despite the fact that they and their comics publisher, DC Comics, are part of the same Warner Bros. family as Scooby-Doo and the Hanna-Barbera library.""

I hope that Warner will be able to release the rest of this series in the future. That way, fans can enjoy episodes featuring the following guest stars: Phyllis Diller, Josie & The Pussycats, Jeannie, Sonny & Cher, Sandy Duncan, Tim Conway, The Addams Family, Davy Jones, and Jerry Reed.",1213488000,10,1615,5.579591836734694

When being pursued by the bad guys, the same backgrounds appear repeatedly as Shaggy and Scooby flee.

Scooby Doo Meets the Adams Family  1972

A Good Medium is Rare  1972  starring Phyllis Diller

Sandy Duncan's Jeckyll And Hyde  1972

The Secret of Shark Island  1972  stars  Sonny and Cher

The Haunted Horseman of Hagglethorn 1972  starring Davey Jones

The Phantom of the Country Music Hall 1972 starring Jerry Reed

Scooby Doo Meets Jeannie (of I dream of Jeannie) 1973

The Haunted Showboat  1973 starring Josie and the Pussycats

The Spirited Spooks Sports Show  1973 starring Tim Conway

2205572,4,B0007939Q6,"The New Scooby-Doo Movies, along with ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"" and the ""Scooby-Doo Show"", are my favorite Scooby-Doo cartoons. I grew up watching all of these shows in the 1970s, and I was very happy to see this collection put out on DVD.

The format for these episodes is different than ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"" (twice as long, plus the guest stars), and I find it quite enjoyable. There was a certain camraderie between the gang in the original series, and it seems to carry over here beween the gang and the guest stars.

This set contains some great episodes - the ones with the Harlem Globetrotters, Speed Buggy, Laurel & Hardy, Don Knotts, and Batman & Robin are my favorites. I especially liked Guess Who's Knott Coming to Dinner, The Lochness Mess, The Ghost of Bigfoot, and The Weird Winds of Winona.

The picture has been cleaned up well for the most part. There are a few scenes where artifacts (dirt) are visible. The soundtrack is mono (Dolby Digital 1.0), but it sounds pretty good. The packaging was also impressive.

I do have two complaints though:
1) Some of my favorite episodes are missing, including Scooby-Doo Meets Jeannie and The Haunted Showboat. One of the other reviewers mentioned that this was due to legal reasons with the guest stars involved. Hopefully this will be resolved soon so that we will have the remaining 9 episodes on DVD.
2) Lack of special features. I would like to see interviews with the great voice talent (like Don Messick & Casey Kasem), and something on the history of the show (who came up with the idea, etc.)

Overall I liked this set, and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Scooby-Doo, especially the early years.",1142121600,7,1686,4.644295302013423

Those were, in my opinion, 3 of the top 5 best of all time movies. I only remembered foggy snippets of them, but treasured memories at that. Ones I was sad they didn't include and don't know why were the Sandy Duncan, the Hagglethorn Hall and Shark Island. Those were the 6 I wanted to see the most, and I got 50 % on this DVD which isn't bad. I hope they will eventually release the others, as there is a lot of Harlem Globetrotter and Don Knotts episodes.

But he didn't seem too bitter about it since a lot of small kids knew who he was from these cartoons - doesn't hurt that he still looks young.

I get a kick out of watching these adventures although not the same rush as when I was a kid - seeing Don Knotts and Shaggy together, that was star power.

2205579,5,B0007939Q6,"It seems a lot of the previous reviewers have been upset with Hanna-Barbera for not releasing all 25 ""Scooby Doo Movies"" episodes, instead opting for a ""Best of"" collection.

My understanding is that H-B had no choice. When stars agree to guest on a special, they usually sign long, thick contracts that stipulate how the material can be used. The company that owns these shows usually must get ""clearance"" from stars if the materials are going to used in some way that was not part of the original agreement.

In the case of the Scooby Doo Movies, there was no way to anticipate the release of DVD collections 30 years later. Thus before H-B can release any of these episodes they must ""clear"" them with the individuals involved. I have read several reports that H-B could not get clearance from all the celebrities (or their estates) involved. Thus some episodes of the Scooby Doo Movies are still in limbo, until they get clearance for them.

I hope this helps clear up the questions about H-B's approach to this release, which despite the missing episodes, is really a fantastic collection for anyone who fondly remembers Saturday mornings in the early 70s.

2205581,3,B0007939Q6,"First off, I just want to say that I love Scooby Doo and I'm glad they released this wonderful series on DVD, but... a ""Best Of"" series? This is definitely not a good Best Of DVD. How come all 3 Harlem Globetrotter appearances were released on DVD, but they didn't include the episode where Scooby Doo & Gang  met Josie & The Pussycats? Surely that counts as the Best Of. My second problem with this DVD is that the 3 Harlem Globetrotter appeaerances have already been previsioulsy released on DVD, yet here they are released again. Alot of the Scooby Doo DVD releases tend to have the same episode on more than 1 DVD. If you are a true fan of all things Scooby Doo/ Hanna-Barbera, I recommend this to you. But the price is enough to make you want to wait a good year or two to add this to your DVD collection.",1112227200,3,810,4.259740259740259
2205582,2,B0007939Q6,"Firstly, I have to comment on the price. WAAAY overpriced for what is being offered. Heck, I love Scooby as much as anyone, but I love him enough to want the COMPLETE SET of these and not some random pairing by some big wig in a very expensive suit I am funding.

Next of course I have to comment on what WAS picked... no Jerry Reed? C'mon, that episode practically defined this leg of the series. They seemed to pick the safe ones once again underestimating the fans.

I wouldn't mind dropping fifty on the COMPLETE SET but as it stands now, I'll wait to pick this up used, if at all, sad. Otherwise, I must say we Hanna fans are on a roll huh? I mean I haven't picked up Flinstones Season 3 quite yet but I am in disbelief on having the honor of getting them at all, a great time for Hanna fans! I'm not trying to be ungrateful for the Scooby set offered here but see no reason to suddenly cut corners and go ""Best Of"", etc., which almost never is anyway. I take it though by having this Best Of that there will be no follow-up.

Now... where's Yogi Bear and Huckleberry Hound...??? Just another small nit of mine... as much as I love the Top Cat set (luv ya TC!) and found the Wacky Races to be a bit lukewarm (being honest), I truly do not see the logic in releasing those ahead of the flagship stars like Yogi and company. Flinstones, yes. Jetsons, ok. But Wacky Races ahead of Huckleberry Hound? nEvEr!! Can't wait to have the HH when he keeps getting pestered by that mosquito!! C'mon W/B!",1111708800,,1496,4.242105263157895
2205583,5,B0007939Q6,"""The Best Of The New Scooby Doo Movies"" is an excellent collection. A must have for any Scooby fan. Warner Bros. has done a nice job putting this together. This is what the studio considers to be the best in this series. We can only hope that they will soon release ""The Rest Of The New Scooby Doo Movies"". If you enjoyed the first and Second Seasons of ""Scooby Doo Where Are You"", Dont pass this one up, you will not be disapointed.",1111708800,,433,4.228915662650603
2205584,4,B0007939Q6,"I pre-ordered mine 2 weeks ago.  I examined the episodes included and couldn't understand why the folks didn't include the omitted episodes.  They included some good ones but they should have at least kept the pink/red ending backgrounds together like the Don Knotts ones and the Sonny & Cher, etc., and the blue ending backgrounds together like the Don Adams, Tim Conway, Josie, Speed Buggy, etc.  I gave it 4 stars because I love seeing the older cartoons being released.  I now would like to see the original Space Ghosts, Frankenstein Jr/Impossibles, The Herculoids, Mightors, the Batman/Superman Hours (1968), JLA (1967), Secret Squirrels, etc.  I can't wait for the Perils of Penelope and the Dastardly & Muttley ones.

2205585,3,B0007939Q6,"While I am pleased that studios are digging deeper into their vaults and bringing back these classic shows, why should I pay for more ""best of"" when I want ""complete"". The Scooby Doo Movies gave us longer episodes, with some big name guests (for 1972) and made one great show. 5 stars out of 5 for content, but -2 stars for the poor distribition methods.",1111276800,9,354,4.461538461538462
