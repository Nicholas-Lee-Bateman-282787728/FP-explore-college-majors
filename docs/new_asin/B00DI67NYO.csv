5818212,1,B00DI67NYO,"I was very optomistic about this film and thought it had HUGE potential. I was right about the potential, it could have been a fairly good story line but they killed it with ""campy-ness"". Poor photography and editing, poor acting, foolish character names, crappy soundtrack except the song that closed out the movie. It could have (should have) been so much better. The best line in the movie was ""you'd better be ready to drink some whiskey boy"", that would be my advice before you watch this rotten tomatoe. Don't buy it, wait for it to come on cable under the free movie section and you'll thank me later. TWO THUMBS WAY DOWN from a guy who was VERY optomistic about it. Dennis Hopper is spinning in his grave!!!",1380067200,19,715,4.550387596899225
5818213,5,B00DI67NYO,"I was excited about seeing a follow-up to the original ""Easy Rider,"" after four decades, but what made this new film more interesting was that it explains a few things before the original 1969 movie took place, while focusing mainly on being a well-developed sequel. Phil Pitzer is terrific (certainly has the LOOK!) as Captain America's (Wyatt's) brother and the rest of the cast (Jeff Fahey is over the top in this film) turns in a nice job, too.

Because of the language and occasional violence, I would recommend this for 18 and over.",1378425600,9,538,4.723404255319149

5818215,3,B00DI67NYO,"Easy Rider The Ride Back is an interesting sequel of the original film.  It reveals Wyatts younger brother Morgan living in Mexico, who ventures to Arizona in an attempt to mend his relationship with Wild Bill, their father.  The tone of the film is a polar opposite of the previous feature, centered on the familys past and how Wyatt and Morgan became who they are.  Morgan is much like his older brother, who has recovered and restored Wyatts Captain America chopper.  Along the journey, Morgans friend Wes joins the ride, a character reminiscent Wyatts friend Billy.

The film is okay and mimics some aspects of the original with the riders traveling scenic two-lane roads.  Phil Pitzer, who portrays Morgan, bears an uncanny resemblance to Peter Fonda while riding the Captain America chopper in the same leather gear and amber sunglasses.  The film differs in that flash backs of significant family events dominate the story rather than the riders experience with traveling the American southwest.  The ending is open ended, apparently designed for another sequel.  Overall its an interesting attempt at continuing the story of Easy Rider, but it may not satisfy most fans expectations.",1469318400,,1191,5.097938144329897

5818218,2,B00DI67NYO,Not too good. The only reason I watched it was because it's winter in Massachusetts and I can't ride my motorcycle. I understand there's some kind of backstory to it about somebody buying the rights to the original Easy Rider and making a solipsistic sequel that had nothing to do with the original.

5818253,5,B00DI67NYO,"Easy Rider the Ride Back shares all of the drama the First (Easy Rider 1969) movie characters were running from. It is not only a motorcycle film, featuring bikes from 1945 through the 50's and 60's, it is also a tribute film to our Veterans. A family torn apart from the chaos of the 1960's is re-united with love and forgiveness. The story of the life of Wyatt Williams to his murder in 1969 leaves nothing out and gives more insight to the original movie. This movie has all of the bike-action a biker movie could have. It is a drama with a serious plot, so "" heads up,""  don't light that joint till after the movie has been viewed.",1406073600,2,635,4.291666666666667

5818255,1,B00DI67NYO,"As to why this was made.  If you can even get over there being an Easy Rider Sequel, you can then turn your attention to the plot itself.  Except you probably can't because the movie goes around in circles and doesn't make sense.  Why are there all these new siblings for Captain America?  Who the hell is that guy?  Why do I care about Captain America's dad being in the war?  You too can constantly question what the hell you are watching when you dare to seek this craptastic movie out.  Also, maybe it was because I watched it on Hulu, but I couldn't hear half the dialog even though the music was blaring.  If possible watch with subtitles if you care about getting every word in.  I really don't understand why the director/actor wanted the audience to get a family back story.  Did anyone need one??  Why didn't he just make his own movie about senior citizens riding hogs across the U.S. instead of linking it to a movie classic?  Take a stand and don't let Phil Pitzer make anymore classic movie sequels.",1402012800,8,1013,4.445652173913044
5818256,1,B00DI67NYO,"The only reason I watched this is for preparation of the next episode of the ""How Did This Get Made"" podcast.  Otherwise, there is NO REASON WHATSOEVER to submit yourself to this terrible, terrible movie.

The original is a groundbreaking, influential piece of cinema.  This movie is a meandering, plodding, cliche ridden piece of garbage.  How bad is it?  It's so bad that the next time I see Jeff Fahey in anything, I will have traumatic flashbacks to the hour and half I was subjected to this story, not unlike the father in the movie's night terrors of WWII.

Unless you like long, pointless scenes of old men riding motorcycles, I cannot find any redeeming quality to this movie.",1401840000,,684,4.705882352941177

5818258,3,B00DI67NYO,"If you've read other reviews that say it's the worst movie ever, it's not.  It is not on the level of ER by a long shot but if you get past
the intro it does get better just because of the interest in the back story, mostly of the family.  Wyatt is a peripheral story line but enough to get the gist of where he came from.  It ended  abruptly and left a feeling of being incomplete.  Other folks have said that it was supposed to be a multipart follow up series.  What with how long it took to get this released and the quality I doubt that any others will see the light of day.  I gave it three stars just because I did like seeing the back story.  If you're over critical and have no patience for details then you might just rent it.  That being said, the first 15-20 minutes even tried my patience and there's not many movies I don't enjoy.",1396137600,4,843,4.0606060606060606

5818260,4,B00DI67NYO,"Being a big fan of the first Easy Rider movie I couldn't wait to see this one. I had being hearing rumors for several years while in Sturgis about the sequel being planned, and then the  completed movie finally available. I had also gotten the opportunity to meet Dennis Hopper one summer evening while he was in New Mexico filming in the Jemez Springs area. Well, I wasn't impressed with the film. The leading characters did a good job, the scenery was good, the bikes were awesome, (looked like the original bike) the plot was a bit lacking, but the sound track was awful. One of the strong points in the first film was all the good songs! I mean, come on, Born to be Wild! Magic Carpet Ride, The Pusher, Don't Bogart that Joint, all fit the film perfect. With this one, I can't recall one tune.
But, it was still worth buying and watching. A must have for any motorcycle rider.",1389657600,,880,4.398773006134969
5818261,1,B00DI67NYO,"It was cool to see the Captain America bike again, but that was the highlight of this piece of film. The acting was terrible with most if it seemingly read off a cue card with no rehearsal. The sound on the video was bad, going from barely audible in the scenes that seemed to matter, to super loud. Save your money and buy the original Easy Rider.",1389398400,7,348,4.208955223880597
5818262,1,B00DI67NYO,"Just watched Easy Rider: The Ride Back.
My thoughts;

Editing - Bad
Directing - Bad
Music - Bad
Acting - Bad
Camera Work - I think someone bought a dolly and thought they knew how to use it after reading the manual.
Story - Made no sense. The ending was the best part since it meant the movie was over and it was horrible!

It's like they found everyone that made all the bad biker movies in the sixties, brought them all together, and told them to make a bad motorcycle movie and they took it literally. A waste of 1 hour and 38 minutes of time.

I give it 1 star and that's only because of the Captain America Chopper. Still the best looking chopper ever built. Without that I would give it 0 stars.

5818264,3,B00DI67NYO,"As  a biker since 1945 and having crossed this nation many times I loved the original, the acting was first rate, the situations believable, and  the call of the open road loud and clear. Not so with this sequel. Cliche after cliche, misplaced dated vernaculars, bad boy biker gangs looking for trouble, not real. I've camped out by biker gangs and never had to ask my two friends for help Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson stayed packed and hardly considered. Bikers are not typically bad, just free, and that's what scares most folks.

Nothing more than a vehicle to reconstruct the iconic poster photo from the original movie with 2 bikes and 2 guys that look a lot like Hopper and Fonda.

8593496,3,B00DI67NYO,"The movie isn't a masterpiece like the 1969 Easy Rider but then again you cannot top perfection. We could talk about absolutely horrid sequels such as Bill And Ted's Bogus Journey or Waynes World 2 which I have only seen part of and I had to quit about five minutes in to keep from losing my sanity. Like More American Graffiti in 1979, which George Lucas wrote and produced, but didn't direct, his friend Bill Norton did it was a very interesting film, done with flashback sequences and of course the NY/LA crowd hated it and George Lucas himself couldn't understand why, as he had directed the first one in 1973 and had carefully guided Norton's picture. Goes to show you that even someone as brilliant as George Lucas can't hit the bullseye every single time.

Easy Rider The Ride Back for being made by relative amateurs and without fantastic dialogue turned in a decent movie. I watched it twice and it actually left me understanding Easy Rider 1969 better after the movie was over. In Easy Rider, this is in 1969 mind you at a time when the Hells Angels MC ruled California and you have these two biker friends, non-affiliated with any club involved in a major drug deal, that always bothered me about the original script considering that in 1969, the Angels would not have allowed nobodies to make a major cocaine deal from Mexico to California and not have gotten a taste.

Easy Rider The Ride Back fills in many of the blanks left by the original. First by introducing Wyatt's octogenarian father Wild Bill, who had been a bike builder/racer in the 1930's before WWII and during WWII had rode combat motorcycles before being severely wounded in North Africa and given a medical discharge, which he never quite forgives the Army for. Back on his farm outside Springfield Ohio, Bill goes onto have a rather normal life, he is back farming and building/repairing/racing motorcycles. He has three sons Virgil Wyatt and Morgan who he thoroughly imbues with a love of motorcycles so deep it permeates their very being, and everything in their life comes back to motorcycles. All of the sons are accomplishedwelders and fabricators, helping Wild Bill farm and work on motorcycles. The last piece of the puzzle is filled in when Shane is born and then the boys mother kills herself, suffering from postpartum depression. Wyatt who is about fifteen at this time runs away from home and being that finding runaways in 1960 was a difficult task, Bill makes no effort to find him. In 1968 Morgan and Virgil, fresh from Vietnam, join Wyatt in California, where Wyatt had made his living working with motorcycles in racing stunt driving and working on them. There Morgan makes friends with guys in the Mexican Mafia, and relocates to Mexico and Virgil helps Wyatt build the Captain America bike and Morgan fabricates the jacket and some of Wyatt's Jewelry in his spare time, when he wasn't dealing Mexican Grass. Virgil then returns to Ohio. This was typical of many Vietnam Vets, traveling around after they were discharged so that part of the story fit pretty well. When you see Easy Rider I, you can tell the Captain America Bike is literally virgin because it is so perfect,  You literally got the feeling watching the first one, that the bike was literally the culmination of everything in Wyatt's life to that point and this movie drives that point home.

I give it three stars but there are some pretty glaring holes.

 Hole number 1 is clearly the ages of the boys. Virgil's spot as the oldest doesn't hold water. If Virgil was born around December, 1944, he would

likely have graduated HS in 1962 or 1963. In those years, the only American GI's in Vietnam were the Advisors and certain Special Forces groups, at least thats from what I read. This would have been made more realistic had Wyatt been the oldest child and Virgil's birth was in late 1945-1946. At that point he would have graduated in 1964 or 65 right as LBJ committed the USA completely to the war following the Gulf of Tonkin. There are a few other holes but all things considered the movie did pretty well. For those people wanting a profound moving event from this movie get some perspective. The movie is taking place in 2009, Morgan is SIXTY and his friend West Coast is probably near the same age. His sister Shane is about Fifty give or take. Over Fifty you're not into rebelling against THE MAN you are living life trying to make your way through every single day and if you're over fifty, you're not likely to be snorting cocaine with naked prostitutes, you're more likely to be taking some Oxycodone for your severe back pain from 40 odd years of riding hardtail motorcycles. At that point of your life, family issues and everyday survival is paramount. Yes the movie can be seen as boring by some, because over fifty, the average man or woman's life isn't as exciting as it would have been at twenty-nine, which is how old Peter Fonda was in Easy Rider 1.

See the movie for what it is. A story about a family left in shambles by suicide, rape, Vietnam, Wyatt's senseless murder and Morgan living in exile in Mexico, probably hiding from American law enforcement. Wild Bill is left in his mid 80's with nothing but nightmares from WWII regrets and hate for almost everyone born after January 1, 1946 ie Baby Boomers who he regards aside from the guys who served in Vietnam  as chickens-t whiners who spat on their nation's flag. Wild Bill is a strong man, and he hates everyone who isn't as strong as he is, especially Morgan. He dislikes Shane because she married a pretentious rich a------ but he adores her son who is currently in Iraq, trying to follow the example he and Virgil set. The irony is Wild Bill never really knows his children, nor does he really care to know them. He is satisfied with seeing others through the mythos he created around them. Although never said Wyatt and Morgan both blamed Wild Bill for their mother's suicide, as they saw him as an indifferent hateful man who never stopped to look around him and consider others. Wild Bill is so typical of many of the WWII generation males, who placed a high value on being stoic, emotionally unavailable, and conformist to a fault because of the Military.
