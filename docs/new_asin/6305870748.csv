For someone who trains in the Gracie style of jiu-jitsu, this movie presents the viewer a unique opportunity to see the behind-the-scenes footage of  Rickson Gracie's preparation, philosphy and training.

1086388,5,6305870748,"This is an excellent documentary.  Rickson Gracie is the best fighter that's ever lived, and the video chronicles his mental and physical preparation leading up to Japan's Vale Tudo 1995.

1086391,5,6305870748,"Rickson comes off as a tradition respecting man with strong family ties representing the beauty of his family's well known art of self defense. In smashing machine, Kerr has no real family takes lots of drugs and hangs out with a tramp. He's depicted as a product of modern american culture existing only to capitalize on his physical superiority while it lasts. Its too bad they never fought, because i'm betting Rickson by armbar.

A few impressions were that Rickson was very familial in his encounters with all the people he was associating with in the course of the film.
Royler is a real irritant, the delusional american fighters always complaining about something, japanese fighters displaying honesty and enthusiasm... when the shootfighter's dad asks how old the champ is, 30 he says, ""Oh well he's in his prime"" the dad says.

With that line the shootfighter's intuitive father inadvertently sums up the essence of choke... traditional knowledge cultivated through generations on display NOW, by a man in his prime.",1290124800,,1026,5.06508875739645
1086392,4,6305870748,"This documentary covers the preparation of Rickson Gracie for the Vale Tudo tournament held in Japan. It contained some good interviews with him and with the other top competitors. Of course Rickson won the tournament, and all his wins were via the rear naked choke. I am assuming this is why the documentary is called Choke.

I wish Rickson Gracie would have competed in the UFC. After Royce Gracie, we wish some new Gracie's would participate and continue their family's legacy. The difference today is that most competitors know Jiu Jitsu quite well. If the Gracies improve their stand up fighting, they will be unmatched in the UFC.",1283299200,,636,4.888888888888889
1086442,5,6305870748,"This is an excellent DVD! Much better than I expected it to be.  The production quality is excellent. The story gives a lot of insight into Rickson Gracie's approach to training; some insights that I didn't have before depsite the fact that I am familiar with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. There were also insights into the backgrounds, motivations, and training approaches of the other fighters as well. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the DVD and will likely watch it several times over.",1281744000,,478,4.975
1086443,4,6305870748,"I bought this DVD some time back because Rickson Gracie is just awesome, one of my idols after the UFC made Gracie Jiu jitsu a household name among martial artists. Although this DVD is a documentary and does not have full fights, it's still good DVD to have for all martial artists, and Gracie fans. See how Rickson trains and prepares himself, and his thoughts before and during the tournament. I think it's a must have DVD because it shows one of the greatest in his prime. And you can also see how other fighers feels about fighting Rickson.",1270771200,,545,4.515151515151516

Actually i bought it because im a brazilian jiu jitsu athlete and a big fan of Rickson Gracie, but i think the video could have shown more training aspects, what its really interesting for me. As a documentary is ok, but once more, its not worth the money,it could be a little bit cheaper.",1223769600,,455,4.181818181818182
1086447,5,6305870748,This movie is right up there with The Smashing Machine. Great look into MMA at its roots. Hopefully a new documentary like this surfaces in the future because they sure are great to watch.,1199750400,,188,4.5588235294117645
1086448,5,6305870748,This is a great look into a few days and hrs inside the legend known as Rickson Gracie.  Anyone who really knows BJJ and it orgins knows Rickson is arguably the greatest fighter ever.  This video really shows you how great Rickson was for his time and shows how far advanced he was.  This video left me wishing I could see more of Rickson and wondering what if he competed today.  It is a great inside look to how the baddest man alive flet and dealt with pre fight gitters.  Long Live Gracie Jiu Jitsu!,1183852800,,503,4.252631578947368
1086449,1,6305870748,"I just started learning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and think its a great and amazing fighting style, but this movie didn't really capture my interest at all.  It could be that I just don't watch BJJ or MMA or whatever at all, but the fights were pretty short and mostly disappointing.  I did see the general idea behind Gracie fighting style in action, which was good.  However, to me (someone just starting to learn BJJ), this wasn't all that exciting.  I didn't get to see a lot of moves, and many counters happening.  Similarly, to someone who only likes martial arts enough to watch the occasional Jet Li movie...well, there's a reason that movies show striking martial artists rather than grapplers, its just more exciting, so this documentary wouldn't really appeal to those guys.  And to people who do watch a lot of MMA and real fighting, I'd guess that watching UFC would be a lot more entertaining.

However, I do think that this must be a more significant video for its ""historical"" value.  My understanding is that BJJ wasn't well known back in 95 when this vale tude (or whatever its called -- no rules fighting) tournament happened.  So for that reason Rickson must have been a big deal and something exciting at that point.

Don't get me wrong, I think that guy is awesome, but the movie was no good.  Good fighter does not equal good movie producer.",1172361600,,1358,4.640167364016737
1086450,4,6305870748,"A good look at the life inside and outside of the ring of an mixed-martial-art contestant, Rickson Gracie.  His family helped popularize the concept of MMA competition for North American audiences with the debut of the Ultimate Fighting Champsionship back in 1993 in Denver, Colorado.  Even though Rickson is probably the strongest Gracie in terms of physical and technical abilities, the family chose Royce to compete in UFC to demonstrate that a physically small person can defeat much larger opponents using superior grappling techniques.

If you're a fan of MMA, this is a good DVD to watch to see how competition has evolved over the years.",1171929600,2,645,5.066037735849057
1086451,4,6305870748,"I gave this documentary 4 stars because I have a personal interest in grappling/mma/the gracie family, that being said I would give it 3 stars for anyone with no general interest in the subject matter.

I especially enjoyed the insight into Rickson Gracie's training and personal life. You can't help admire the man for the amazing athlete and family man he is.",1170892800,,361,4.82258064516129
1086511,5,6305870748,This video is very good from a couple of different view points.  It shows the human side of the fighters and the reasons why they have chosen to fight. It shows the families and the concerns and support they have for the fighters. This video also shows how different styles of martial arts stack up to each other. In particular you can see how Rickson Gracie and Brazilian Jujitsu completely dominate the tournament. This is a very good video and I would recomend it to all martial artist.,1161993600,2,489,4.556818181818182
1086512,5,6305870748,"Rickson Gracie is the esteemed Gracie family champion. His skills and deep philosophy are heralded by family members, training partners, students, and opponents. He is truly a one of a kind individual, but very much like an ""average"" man his age. In the documentary ""Choke"", Gracie allows cameras into his mental and physical preparation for the Japan Vale Tudo 95 tournament. There is great footage of Helio Gracie and of his opinions and observations on Rickson and fighting in general. Also, Rickson's family is covered too; bringing the human aspect to a warrior that has dangerous encounter on the horizon. But it is Rickson himself that is the show and displays a kind of candor that the viewer can relate to. Here is a fighting machine in a dangerous sport, but the man within the machine is as spiritually grounded as they come.

Covered also are two other fighters, Koichiro Kimura and Todd Hays. Kimura is a shootfighter willing to risk his health in an event with limited rules. He is confident despite doubt from others. Todd Hays is a kickboxer with goals of Olympic Gold in bobsledding. His intentions are to cash in on the tournament to fund his future dreams of glory.

A good look into preparation of an MMA event along with excellent behind the scenes footage too. For fans of documentaries for sure, for fans of MMA...a must!",1158537600,,1344,4.788793103448276
1086513,5,6305870748,"This is a great look into the life of Rickson Gracie, the most legendary MMA fighter of all time.  I strongly recommend this movie to any true MMA fighters....those that see beyond the octagon walls of the UFC.

I wish that Rickson was about 10 - 15 years younger so that he was fighting in PRIDE now.  He was the first of the well rounded fighters and I can only imagine what he could do if he was in his prime right now.",1153699200,,422,4.0602409638554215
1086514,4,6305870748,"The film centers on the 1995 Vale Tudo World Fighting Championships in Tokyo.  We see snapshots of the lives of three of the competitors -- Rickson Gracie (the defending champion), Todd Hays (an American kickboxer) and Koichiro Kimura.  Although for fans of NHB (no hold barred) fighting the tournament itself is fun to watch, I think many viewers will appreciate this background.  If you're a fan of MMA (mixed martial arts), you've probably seen lots of the action.  But knowing a bit about what these competitors are like as himan beings, why they are there (there are some surprises on both points), gives context to the whole event and makes it much more engaging.

The tournament itself features eight (8) fighters in a single elimination tournament.  In addition to seeing the fights, we also see competitors back in the locker room, where the tension is palpable.  The fights themselves are engaging.  Fans of MMA will see that the sport has evolved, and these fighters show they have been students of the very early contests, but they are not as well-rounded as the fighters of today.

If you have more than a casual interest in MMA, you will enjoy this film.  If you are just looking for bloody brawls, get a tape of knockouts.",1151280000,,1237,4.765258215962441
1086515,5,6305870748,"This movie has become a classic in the mixed martial arts. It covers Rickson Gracie's training for for the Vale Tudo Japan tournament of 1995. This tournament paved the way for tounaments such as Pride in Japan, just as the UFC improved the sport's popularity in the US.

Rickson's presence at the tournament was important as the Brazilians had developed single combat to a fine art. The Gracies were (and are) the epitome of development of the style and Rickson was the family champion.

The outcome of the tournament is not hard to predict. What is useful to see, here, is the training for the tournament. The training his hard but precise and the story shows that Gracie is a family man and all-round good guy outside the ring.

Rickson is analytical and understands that what he does isn't violence as his intent is to win in competition, not necessarily to injure his opponent. That is the take home lesson of competitive martial arts.

This is a must see.",1137801600,7,961,4.668639053254438
1086516,5,6305870748,"This movie is an excellent, and far more realistic view, of no-holds-barrred fighting. The movie follows the life of Rickson Gracie (pronounced Hickson), and his training and philosophy for fighting. In short, the viewers are given a glimpse into a man, who could probably be classified as the most complete fighter in the world, laughing and enjoying the company of his family and friends.

Then, after learning about Rickson and his training regiment, the producers of this film track the training and philosophy of other men who are scheduled to fight Rickson in a winner-take-all tournament in Japan. They all have different motives, different things that they are putting on the line, different styles, but only one man will come out on top.

This is a must see for fight fans and for people who enjoy good documentaries.",1135468800,2,826,4.978260869565218

1086518,1,6305870748,"I seen the documentary and I think that he seems like a nice guy in person and a family man, but the way he fights it is like he's going to kill his opponent when he punch the weak part of the body, the kidneys. His training is art but the way he fights is no art at all. I have experience Grappling styles, similiar to Gracie's Jiu-Jitsu and I think it is no art when you freaking choking someone by the neck and punching the kidneys, you might as well kill the guy.",1108080000,5,467,3.978723404255319
1086519,5,6305870748,This MMA fighting documentary was a great introductory into the world of Mixed Martial Arts.  I trully gained a great deal of respect for Rickson Gracie and all of the other MMA fighters as they protrayed great courage and determination in this movie.  I really enjoyed watching the training and the personal side of Rickson and the other fighters.  Great movie! I highly recommend it...,1097798400,2,387,4.923076923076923
1086520,5,6305870748,"This superb documentary shows the why Rickson Gracie is such a
successful and impressive martial artist. An examination of the
lifestyle - including diet, stretching and breathing exercises, meditation,
fight strategy, workouts, and family commentaries - which allow one
 to view the day to day preparation of this legendary fighter.
Similarly, we see up close and personal accounts of his opponents
in this particular Pride event. Very revealing and noteworthy the
differences in habits and lifestyle leading to the later results.
Some good fights, some less than hoped for. Yet Master Gracie

1086590,5,6305870748,"Rickson Gracie ""Choke"" is more than just a fight video - it captures the anxiety, preparation, and visceral intensity behind the competitors as they prepare for competition.  View at the Ultimate Fighting Championship with a much deeper background.
The video captures the preparation for, and competition in Vale Tudo Japan 1995, a mixed martial arts competition where almost anything goes.  (""Vale Tudo"" is Portuguese for ""Anything Goes"", but the rules are not quite that extreme.)
The video takes an in depth look at 3 of the participants.
1 - Todd Hays is an all around gifted athlete, with a background in kickboxing.  His mixture and fear are apparent as he attempts to use this event to pay for his Olympic bobsleading dreams.
2 - Koichiro Kimura is a Japanese amateur shootfighting champion, who wants nothing more than to test himself against the best.  You get to meet his parents, who are affraid he'll die in the ring.
3 - Rickson Gracie is the defending champion, as well as the best of the famous Gracie family.  It's no suprise that he gets the lion's share of the publicity.
In addition to the gritty reality of the fighting, you're introduced to some humorous back scene footage:  Rickson's desire for a belt in addition to a trophy brings some chuckles, as does his last minute desire to hit the restroom.  A near blind Yuki Nakai is both valiant and funny when he screams, ""Rickson, I'm coming for you!""
If you're looking for a technique video, this is not it.  If you're looking for 2 hours of fighting from the best guys out there today, again this is not the video.  If you're looking to understand the mind of the fighter, in the context of the ring, this is the only DVD out there.  I was rivited from start to finish.",1070150400,28,1741,4.641693811074918
1086591,5,6305870748,"If you're curious about ""ultimate fighting"", this is a high-quality documentary to learn what it's all about, and follow the story of one of the best MMA (mixed martial arts) fighters of all time, Rickson Gracie.
However, MMA has changed hugely since the UFC started (showcasing Rickson's brother Royce Gracie) in 1993.  ""Choke""'s Japanese tournament in 1995 was still early days.  While Rickson was (and is) one of the best MMA fighters ever, his opponents weren't as competent as the top fighters are today.  The Pride tournaments in Japan and the UFC in the USA showcase the world's top MMA talent fighting today.
You shouldn't watch Choke looking for insight into strategies the very best fighters use in unarmed combat, because aside from Rickson most of the competitors in Choke were relatively new to the sport.  That said, Choke is a much higher quality documentary than almost anything else you'll find, and it is much more accessible and entertaining to the casual MMA fan.  (It's also a must-see for any fan of Rickson Gracie.)

The only real complaint I have is that it would have been nice to see Rickson's techniques used against more experienced fighters.  The beginning of the disc is about Rickson's training and his lifestyle.  The last half is about the Vale Tudo Tournament of '95 held in Tokyo, Japan.  Eight fighters including Rickson enter the single elimination tournament and fight matches until one fighter is remaining.  There is not a lot of fighting, but it is great to see behind the scenes what goes on in the locker room while the fighters are waiting for their next match and what their opinions are before and after the fights.",993600000,9,769,4.659259259259259

You will get a look at his unique training methods that have made  him the man he is today, and he will offer his philosophies of jiu-jitsu  and how jiu-jitsu is his life.

When it turns its attention to Todd  Hays, etc. it gets a little boring, but it's worth it just to see the  interviews and behind the scenes footage of Rickson.

Buy  it!",949449600,,315,5.3061224489795915
1086650,5,6305870748,"Choke is a great documentry about professional fighters, The fights themselves and the preparation that goes into the fights as well as training techniques that Rickson Gracie uses and an insight into Gracie  jiu-jitsu as well as making you understand what a fighter goes through when  he wins and when he loses, Overall a great video to purchase if you enjoy  fighting and other contact sports, 5 out of 5.",945216000,2,407,4.785714285714286
1086651,4,6305870748,"I must say that the video itself is a little underwhelming.  As one can read from other reviews it follows Rickson and two other competitors as they prepare for a Japan Vale Tudo.  After watching the video i thought to  myself, i don't care about these other two competitors, i bought the video  to see Rickson train and be interviewed.  While there was some of this  present, i found myself wishing they would have included more footage of  Rickson training.  For those of you that have heard of or maybe even seen  Rickson once or twice this is a good tape to watch to learn a little more  about him.  For others, who have seen interviews with Rickson and have seen  him fight in GIA, Japan vale tudo and the Pride competition its nothing  new.  Well to sum this review up, let me put it like this.  If your a big  Gracie fan, especially a Rickson fan, buy this tape. After all, its only  16.99, if it were like 30.00 i would say forget it and hope you see it on  A&E sometime.  If your not a huge fan, you would not be shooting  yourself in the foot if you did not buy this video.",924220800,4,1083,4.190243902439025

Also heard him on Joe Rogan's podcast recently.  20 years later, wisdom continues to spew from this cat. He's a deep deep man.",1406246400,,269,4.115384615384615
