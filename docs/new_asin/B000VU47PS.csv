8752054,1,B000VU47PS,"This video is only 10 minutes long, which was not included in the product description.  Due to its short length, it was more like an infomercial than a serious travel video.  While it provides highlights on a few sites in Istanbul, I was hoping for something that would have had more substance.  It seems that you need to purchase two or three videos to get a fuller picture and some of the videos appear to have repeated information.  For example this video includes a segment on the Hagia Sophia while there is a separate video dedicated to that building.  So if you are looking for a fuller description be prepared to purchase more than one.",1192665600,7,644,4.565217391304348
