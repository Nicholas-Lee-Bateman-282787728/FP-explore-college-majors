LET THE WOMEN VOTE is the story of the Women's Suffrage movement and its late 19th Century spread from four western states: Wyoming (originally a teritory), Utah, Colorado and Idaho, to full national ratification by 1920.

Wyoming's male voters approved the measure in 1869 when it was a territory. Congress allowed the law to carry over when statehood was granted. In Utah, the 1871 voting rights for all were revoked after a decade at the Federal level until Mormons were willing to recognize the illegality of polygamy. Wyoming also later passed a revocation initiative, but Gov. Campbell vetoed this measure. He was upheld in the state legislature by a one-vote margin. Suffrage was rejected by both Idaho and Colorado on a first attempt, but passed some years later. It was an uphill battle all the way after the first two victories.

Conclusion as to why this movement took hold in the territories: women helping to tame these areas had to be as tough as, face all the hardships and do many of the things that were required of men. Equal voting rights seemed only correct to frontiersmen who witnessed their tenacity during those difficult days.",1304726400,,1335,4.898230088495575
