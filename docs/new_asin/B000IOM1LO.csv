8146597,2,B000IOM1LO,"The actual title to this movie is ""Carnaval en Veracruz"" which was filmed on location in the cities of Jalapa and Veracruz in 1940. The main characters are Manuel Medel, Agustn Izunza, and Eufrosina Garca. This is not a Cantinflas movie per se, though he is featured in the movie. Mario Moreno clips were actually edited into the movie. Mario sued causing a delayed release. If you will notice, Manuel and Mario are not seen together interacting in the movie. They were a great team in the late 30s (As es mi tierra, guil o sol, and El signo de la muerte). Too bad it was short lived. As for the DVD itself, I have the one released by ""Rebel Crew"". As mentioned by another reviewer, the audio is completely dubbed and poorly done. The scenes are very dark. The cover should feature the 3 main characters! If the original audio is available, this movie should be digitally remastered. I gave it only 2 stars because of the DVD quality.",1317772800,,934,4.5
8146598,5,B000IOM1LO,"I am sure back in 1941 this was a wonderful movie. Now has been dubbed and the new audio track has replaced the original sound. That is awful because most of the comedy relied on the original voices and now has lost some of the appealing. Adding to that, the songs are not the same they sing in the movie and God knows what else is not the same as before, maybe even the script. I say this because of the lip sync, which shows the Trio singing something completely different from what you hear.
The movie is good (if you are not to picky, though) and is in spanish. The quality is not very good, what means they only replaced the audio but didn't improve the video... too bad...",1257033600,,678,4.223076923076923
