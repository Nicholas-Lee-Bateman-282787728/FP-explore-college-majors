8339362,5,B001S2Q5Y4,"Flora is a librarian relocating and on the way gets robbed.  Resorting to hitchhiking, she is picked up by a plumber who is on his way home to get to his wedding. He is also towing a cow which is wedding present from his aunt.  Flora tries to be helpful with caring for the cow but it got away from her and that's when all the mishaps happen.  I like that the more the two characters get to know each other, they find out things about themselves as well.  So it's like the other person is mirroring what the other is not seeing.  It's a story of destiny getting in the way when they least expected it.

The movie is in German with English subtitles and it filmed in the beautiful countryside.  It sort of reminds me of the movie Leap Year, which I also love, but is set in Ireland.  I recommend this film if you want to watch something heartwarming without being too sappy.",1297987200,2,873,4.216867469879518
