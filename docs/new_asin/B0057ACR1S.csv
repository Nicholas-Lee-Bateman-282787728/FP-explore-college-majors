8460438,2,B0057ACR1S,Bad dvd quality and hard to navigate the menu.,1455753600,,46,4.222222222222222
8460439,4,B0057ACR1S,"inexpensive, tastefully done film project by young actresses. enjoyed watching despite bad acting and filming technique. good alternative to watching television",1369353600,,160,6.666666666666667
8460440,2,B0057ACR1S,I enjoyed the dvd until I found out it was missing episode 13-15 which includes the season finale! I was not happy about that after spending good $ for the entire season. I had to track down the episodes and still haven't found 13 yet!,1365638400,,235,4.2444444444444445
8460441,3,B0057ACR1S,"Everyone that has watched the Lovers & Friends show already knows about the bad volume & lack of experienced actors/actress. I got over that and followed the story. The story was alright in this season, but the way it ended, how the writer/director just left the story line hanging at the end was unsettling. I have yet to see Season 5, but I plan on it...one day. If its anything like this one without a sufficient, complete ending, Im done.",1360022400,,442,4.5375
8460442,5,B0057ACR1S,I love this series and I believe that this production is a great success. It's unfortunate they don't play this on tv. Some would much rather put nonsense up there than good stuff like this.,1353715200,,190,4.457142857142857
8460443,5,B0057ACR1S,"This is a great show, I recommend watching the webisodes if you can find them.
This video was fun to watch, but a few of the episodes were out of order and the
picture quality was lacking.  Other than that the actresses were wonderful.

All the Best,

8460444,3,B0057ACR1S,"The storyline on this show is great. It is a true to life depiction of the LGBTQ community, however, the production is cheap and the acting leaves a lot to be desired. Once you get past that, the show is awesome. I think it is great to support up and coming directors and casts.",1343001600,,278,4.166666666666667
8460445,4,B0057ACR1S,It was refreshing and interesting to see characters that looked like me in reality situation that I could relate..  I definitely want to see more of these ladies and this sit come in the future.  I recommended this sit come to my friends.,1342828800,,238,4.511627906976744
8460446,1,B0057ACR1S,"I really should have listened to the review  posted prior to buying this dvd cause it was right on the money. The reviewer tells No lies. After watching seasons 1-3 this fourth season was heavily anticipated by me. And boy was I let down. There were new actors who couldn't act and new story lines. There were little follow up to issues that occured in previous series. And to be honest some of the story developments were so far fetched they could of added aliens to the story and it wouldn't of been any more ridiculous than what was on film. The sound on this dvd is even more terrible than previous series. They might have brought in some new characters but the sound of the wind blowin was a character they decided to keep. It would be nice to see a lesbian couple on the show who actually stayed together and went through trials and tribulations. I hope that season 5 brings in new writers, sound techs and send the current actors to acting classes. Season 4 was the Super Bowl of Hot Messes on film.",1323129600,3,1006,4.379679144385027
8460447,2,B0057ACR1S,The LNF show became one of my favorite shows when I first started watching the episodes on youtube so naturally when Season 4 was set to be released I couldn't wait to see what happened..and now I'm can't believe how disappointing it turned out to be..I won't spoil it for everyone who hasn't had the chance to watch it yet..but I will say the editing was just as bad if not worse than the last 3 seasons..the storylines were a little up and down and off and on..it leaves you with so many questions at the end it's ridiculous..I was expecting alot better but you get what you pay for I guess..I just hope there's a season 5 to followup otherwise following this entire season has been a complete waste..just as the L Word ended their last season in the worst way possible..LNF is a definite runner up..,1317859200,3,802,4.425675675675675
