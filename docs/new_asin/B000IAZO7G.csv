8420302,5,B000IAZO7G,"This DVD is very aptly named and I for one would highly recommend it... ""The Ultimate DVD of New Zealand"" is as it says...3 wonderful videos of New Zealand on 1 DVD...very good value for a start!! The first video is entitled ""Naturally Its New Zealand""...this is a documentary that takes you through the country as a typical tour may be...I found the narration informative and the video footage excellent. The second video on the DVD is all about the Native Maori people on this country. This is presented by a well spoken historian and covers the history of these people. The third video is a superb example of New Zealand's great outdoor. ""Great Walks of New Zealand - The Able Tasman National Park"" follows a typical 5 day guide tour through this wonderful coastal track. I've walked this South Island track and can truly say that is it is a wonderful part of New Zealand. This DVD shows many aspects of New Zealand that I've found help aid my love for this country...Highly Recommended Viewing!!!",1209945600,13,1000,4.6875
