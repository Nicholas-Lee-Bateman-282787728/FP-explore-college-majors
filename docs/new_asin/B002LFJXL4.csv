3945816,5,B002LFJXL4,"I absolutely LOVE watching Michael in the questioning part at the end. You get to know him in a different way from the usual. I just hope they come out with a volume that will have the rest of it. I don't know what the other people are rating on, but I thought the whole V.2 was excellent!",1259280000,,289,4.0
3945817,2,B002LFJXL4,"I bought this DVD really just to be able to see and hear Michael, and hopefully to learn something new. The only part of the DVD I enjoyed was the first set of three, which was a part of his at home interview collection. That was fun to see. The other two parts consisted of 3.5 hours of part of Martin Bashir's interview and some sort of interrogation of Michael from 1993, regarding his music and whether or not he wrote or co-wrote them and if he stole any of them. It was ridiculous and sad to watch but I couldn't turn it off. I felt bad for Michael and wanted these lawyers to leave him alone. I wish this and any and all of those other horrible things said and done to him never happend. I would not recommend this volume. I did enjoy most of volume 2 however. He was a beautiful human being inside and out. I miss him greatly and will always love him. He will forever and always be in my heart.",1258934400,25,902,4.101694915254237
3945818,4,B002LFJXL4,the interviews re ok..there is no occcult messages.. for those who think there are.  its just a copy of the paper the phycic used..,1258934400,,131,4.458333333333333
3945819,4,B002LFJXL4,"Since my first comment on these DVDs, I have purchased them and enjoyed them. In the booklet that came with it there is a page about the seance, this time I cut it out at another reviewer's suggestion. That way I was able to enjoy the rest of the disc. And, I like it very much. So I recommend it for these reasons.
There is no occult content on the disc itself.

This is what I first wrote about these DVDs:
""Be warned this unauthorized CD says it has a seance on it and is using a Ouija board to ask MJ questions. After reading these notes on the cover, I sent it back unopened. If I had know this, I would not have ordered it.

MJ was against this kind of thing based on his religious convictions. Jehovah's Witnesses believe people cease to exist when they die, but will be raised later and that is what the Bible really says also. I am exceedingly sad that Michael Jackson has died and I wish every day it was not so, but this is no comfort. One day we will see MJ again, but not now.""",1258416000,4,990,4.0717948717948715

I thought I'd give some brief information on the DVD. The back of the case says:

""Michael Jackson the Interviews Vol 2 presents a 4 hour DVD programme showing various in depth interviews which reveal an honest and frank insight into why Michael became the world's biggest superstar. Presented together for the very first time is this essential collection which also includes - The King of Pop, a 32 page book. This newly written book is a tribute biography and discography which includes a special tribute section on the Staples Center memorial in Los Angeles. We have also transcripted a very recent seance where Michael is asked questions that were responded to using a Ouija board, a fascinating connection that will bring peace of mind to many of Michael's fans.""

This was in fact my favourite disc of the Mega Box set, so I would recommend it to everyone. It has some very personal and revealing footage with Michael that made me feel very warm and happy inside.",1257897600,20,1824,7.712918660287081
3945821,1,B002LFJXL4,"The fact that we don't know...is reason to question whether we want to pre-purchase it.  Why the secrecy?  Why isn't it published up front about the identity of the creator and content of these interviews?  That is reason enough for us not to buy...until we know who and what we are supporting.  Like someone said, it seems that everyone is out to make a quick buck at the expense of the legendary MJJ.",1256947200,2,402,4.465753424657534
3945822,3,B002LFJXL4,"If this is the tapes from Rabbi Schmulley I would not buy them,Schmulley lied about whay he ""cut ties"" with MJ. He was a spiritual advisor and I do not believe these were tapes that were meant to be heard. I did read some of the book-standing in Wal Mart and it is amazing listening to MJs take on things...however shmulley should ahve known it would be twisted by some readers and media (just see how they tore into what he said about Madonna) Another Rabbi has come out and slammed Schmulley for printing his book-counseling sessions are always recorded but they are not to break confidentiality.
  I don't know what this is or if it is even that-just ssyin.",1256947200,8,660,4.491666666666666
3945823,3,B002LFJXL4,"The content of these two discs from an interview I saw is that they contain information that were not for the public, but for Michael's private library at the time of recording.

MJ's spiritual leader at that time did these recordings with him.

His spiritual leader who really was at his side leading him spriritually in his daily life was a cherished mentor and friend as well as his family.

A few years later, he felt Michael was not going a way that he was presenting to  him toward a more responsible way to himself.  Therefore, he went on with love in both of their hearts for each other.

Michael answers open ended questions and wants them to be  recorded.  I heard some of the tape.

For example.......Michael was talking about growing older and he metioned Princess Dianna and that noone would ever have another image of her except of her in her beautiful youth.

And that after a certain age and a very close age from where he was (from what is sounded like# that he would live without anyone ever seeing him again.  He did not want anyone to see him aging, aged or anywhere in between.

He would live as a recluse to all media and the public.

He speaks to numerous topics and in a very conversational manner.

This is real life sit down, talk about your thoughts about so many things and why you have arrived to them if you know at all!

Any fan would want to get their hands on these as it #just as I listened in to a bit of this) was like he was in the other room and talking to a friend as they were having a really deap conversation that night.

YOU WANT IT!",1256947200,3,1576,4.273648648648648
3945824,1,B002LFJXL4,If any of the interviews have Martin Bashir in them then count me out. It's probably not even an offical Michael Jackson release.,1256688000,6,129,4.6521739130434785
3945825,2,B002LFJXL4,yes it would be nice to know what we are buying and who we are supporting. Once again just putting MJ's name on it to  profit. = (,1256428800,10,130,3.642857142857143
3945846,5,B002LFJXL4,Product was excellent! The DVD arrived in a timely manner and was so worth what I paid for it. I sent one to my sister and she loved it too!,1346112000,,140,3.7
3945847,4,B002LFJXL4,"I love all interviews with MJ as he could always hold his own. Always smiling, always polite. I bought both 1 & 2 and really love the one with opera talking between clips after his death. Its heartwarming, funny, entertaining and sometimes a bit sad. But all in all, its a great thing to have if you are an MJ fan.",1313107200,,314,4.163934426229508
3945848,5,B002LFJXL4,"I liked listening to the 1993 deposition from Interviews vol. 2 because I got to hear from Michael all about his creative process and how he went about composing his songs. Unfortunately, mainstream reporters didn't ever ask MJ about this, just more shallow or sensationalized stuff, so this is what we do have to learn about this. I am glad it is on film, even is it is grainy quality deposition film!! I loved hearing him describe writing a song and him singing the parts too.",1284508800,,478,4.569767441860465
3945849,2,B002LFJXL4,"Here they come...
  People who wish to cash in on someone elses' success. This movie is far from what I expected. The 2+ hours from that cheap grainy camera for his deposition was one complete waste of film. Had I read this in someones' review I would've given things a second thought. The interview with Martin Bashir was so-so. I don't recommend this film to any true Jackson fan.",1278806400,,382,4.521739130434782
3945850,2,B002LFJXL4,"THIS DVD GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE MICHAEL JACKSON IN A NEW LIGHT, BUT AT TIMES THE DVD WAS DISCOLORED AND POINT LESS.  IT WAS ALSO BORROWING AND IT WAS MISREPRESENTED OF WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT.  I THOUGH THE DVD WOULD BE SHOW MORE OF PAST INTERVIEWS HE DID ON TELEVISION.  I DON'T REGRET BUYING IT BUT I JUST EXPECTED BETTER.",1272326400,,329,4.190476190476191

3945852,5,B002LFJXL4,"The 1993 interview, or should I say integregation, started off good then after a while I got angry with the people asking him such stupid questions. However, I am somewhat a little confused. If they keep going back to his testimony back in '89 than why is he being questioned again in '93? If the lawsuit took place in '89 and he was asked about it then why is it necessary to be asking him in '93? Besides, wasn't '93 also the year of his first molestation charges?",1263254400,,466,4.306818181818182
3945853,3,B002LFJXL4,"I got this in the mega box set. Some of the interviews are really good. Some of them the quality stinks. The Japan one for instance I had to turn my volume up to blast off in order to hear it. I loved the interview at his home where he shows us his llama Louey that was precious and he seemed happy at times in it.  I didn't understand the point of the deposition interview after he had  oral surgery and was obviously in pain. They asked him after a break if he had taken a pain killer (duh!) and he said he had. The pill took effect and he was groggy and had trouble remembering what he had said on a previous deposition. What was the point of this?
I found it disturbing and cruel to show him that way!  I cried when they showed the left out scenes from the Bashir (horrid man) documentary. Michael on his bed so sad and hurting. If only he had found someone who loved him enough to really help him I believe he would still be here with us.",1262822400,,943,4.032085561497326
3945854,5,B002LFJXL4,"i purchased this dvd included in my mega-box set that i got - i thought it was absolutely wonderful.

it starts out with mj narrating home movies about himself - when he was little having snowball fights, dancing at his home, his first christmas in which elizabeth taylor surprised him and decorated the whole neverland ranch for the holidays, fun takes of him having water balloon fights and being pushed in the pool, dancing on the high dive, jumping on his trampoline, having an easter egg hunt, he scene where he receives a present from elizabeth taylor of gypsy (his elephant) and then gives her a really nice drawing in return, explains how he had a day for his father at neverland where he and janet got thier dad a boat, how his friends put on a day for him to go shopping in a regular grocery store (which is something he never gets to do since fans always end up wanting autographs) - it really was fun to watch. it's neat to see footage of mj going into hospitals as well and caring for the children.

it then goes to the footage of the martin bashir interview that was captured by michael's own camera - so it is the unedited, good version of the footage. that was really cool to watch, too.

then it goes to a deposition in which mj answers tons of questions about whether he actually wrote ""the girl is mine"" and ""we are the world"" or stole them from some one else - he was also questioned about ""thriller"" - which i found fascinating to watch, but felt sorry for him, too, because the lawyers questioned him for so long and were so picky on phrasing that i could tell he was getting tired - he had just had a concert the night before and was hoarse so he kept having to drink water and clear his throat a lot. it was very cool to hear him tell how he actually goes about writing songs and it was awesome to hear him give examples of that by making the noises from his seat - there was a part where he was giving an example of how he hears every part of a song in his head and he sat there and made noises for the song ""who is it"" - amazing!

i am glad i purchased this as a part of the box set instead of by itself since it worked out financially better to do so.",1259366400,11,2178,4.154028436018957

8372582,1,B002LFJXL4,"great about Michael. The booklet inside is maybe something worth knowing about, but the DVD isn't giving much that hasn't been seen over the years. I didn't want to give it 1 Star, because it's Michael and NOTHING about him says, 1 Star. The rating of 1 Star is about the selling of these DVDs. I will not be sold on these types of DVDs again.

Please stop doing this! Stop making cheap crap to sell about Michael. He was and still is the most dynamic human being to ever have walked, danced and existed period on a stage and on this Earth. These videos are worthless. The interviews are not relevant at all. It's been DONE too many times.

Michael was about CLASS and PERFECTION and these videos you keep making are about putting a few dimes in your pocket. You are serving no real PURPOSE.",1389571200,,791,4.374149659863946
