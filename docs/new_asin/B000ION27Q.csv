2659631,5,B000ION27Q,I can not say enough great things about this movie. Everyone should see this movie and know it only takes one person to make a difference and all you have to do is reach out and get involved. GREAT MOVIE!!!,1175299200,,206,4.175
2659632,2,B000ION27Q,"I saw Ron Clark on Oprah's favorite teachers show. He was dynamic and innovative and so I ordered his ""story.""  I found it to be a trite and hackneyed version of the typical teacher in the ghetto.  Meryl Streep did a much better job in ""Music of the Heart.""  James Edward Olmos in ""Stand and Deliver"" was far superior, as was Richard Dreyfus in Mr. Holland's Opus.""  This video was a waste of my money and time.",1173916800,7,411,4.298701298701299
2659633,5,B000ION27Q,"As a pre-service teacher, I think this story is absolutely wonderful. The special features, which include interviews with Ron Clark, are great. He is so PASSIONATE! I will graduate within a year and begin teaching. This is a movie I'm sure I will pull out many times when I am worn out to refuel.",1171497600,3,296,4.5
2659634,5,B000ION27Q,"I was so excited when Matthew Perry was nominated for a Golden Globe for this performance. I wish he would have won, he really deserved it. Excellent story for anyone to see, families, teachers, students. And don't forget to watch all of the special features, the real Ron Clark is a delight!",1171065600,2,292,4.634615384615385
2659635,5,B000ION27Q,"I can't say enough about how wonderful matthew Perry was in this movie, award winning performance",1167177600,,97,5.125
2659636,5,B000ION27Q,"This is a wonderful film.  I'm really glad they brought it out on DVD, even though it's already been shown on network television.  I love all the extras.  My family was glued to the screen watching, even my 5 year old son.  (My 9 month old daughter was just sitting, chewing on a cloth.  But she did murmur a bit at the rapping.)

I would recommend this for purchase, and rental both.  It's truly phenomenal what this teacher can do with these troubled students.  I love the fact that they're building a school in his name as well.  Fantastic!

2659637,5,B000ION27Q,"I've been a social worker for years and when I saw this movie on television I do have to say I had to stop and think for a moment.  I know there are great teachers and great social workers, but the story line went along with what I believe: you have to start where they are.  If not you are just doing a job and working with children and their families is not just a job because you are in these peoples lives and if you can't find a way to get through you search for a way that you can. I myself during my years of social work found myself after using all the materials where I work had I found myself at book stores, on line researching; anything to help work with the children and their families in order to help not ""fix them"".  I did not think that my job was to fix others and I wasn't satisfied unless the family/child was impacted enough to make a change.  I know that not all cases you can make a change, you cannot get through to them but I think it's our responsibity to try and try again.  This movie I think showed that we all need a chance and also more chances because inside of us there is a person who has talent, and like the movie we need to show them they have the talent and just to take the time and that they are worth the time to explore their talents and gifts.  I apologize for the spelling and grammer mistakes but I jut woke up, sorry about that :)  I do think this movie is a must see for anyone!!!!!!",1164585600,29,1430,3.9964912280701754
2659638,4,B000ION27Q,"With education being so very key in determining the path of a child's future, teachers obviously play integral roles as educators, advisors, mentors, and surrogate parents. Ron Clark is an outstanding example of the underappreciated and underpaid teachers who quietly, selflessly ply their trade the world throughout. Ron Clark has garnered national attention for his tireless work with the rural North Carolina and inner city Harlem school systems. He's been invited to the White House on 3 separate instances and has been honored by the President and Mrs. Clinton. He has been on the Today Show and the Oprah Winfrey Show. His book The Essential 55, about his classroom rules, is a New York Times Best Seller and has been published in over 25 countries. This Johnson & Johnson-sponsored television movie, shown on TNT, tells his story.

SPOILERS begin: In 1998, teacher Ron Clark (Matthew Perry) leaves rural North Carolina and moves to Harlem, New York to toil in the inner city school system. But he finds it difficult to get a teaching position and must, in the meantime, work as a lowly costumed waiter at a theme restaurant. A door finally opens when a disgruntled teacher quits his job at the Inner Harlem Elementary School. Specializing in raising the standardized test scores of his students, Clark opts to educate the most unruly class of the 6th grade.

Initially, he has a hard time trying to reach his hardbitten kids, suffering their scorn and lack of interest. There are even bets taken by the kids as to how long he'll last. But Clark perseveres, continually asserting his ""we are family"" creed and enforcing his multiple classroom  rules. His attempts to get the class's attention prompts him to develop fresh teaching techniques, such as his chugging down chocolate milk every 15 minutes if the students were quiet (with the possible reward of Clark puking for the kids' entertainment), or having them promise to try to learn if he takes up double dutch. He even has a try at rapping to help them learn the U.S. Presidents. Slowly, gradually, after some rough spots, his class warms up to him as the students discover that their teacher actually cares and that learning could be fun. But the biggest challenge lies ahead as Clark preps his kids for the May aptitude exams.

The film is mostly about Clark's exploits in school, with little time given over to his personal life. During the length of the film, he maintains his waitering job at the restaurant, all the while carrying a torch for lovely waitress Marissa (Melissa De Sousa), who already is saddled with an actor  boyfriend. Thankfully, while the romance is touched on, it doesn't take precedence. End SPOILERS.

This is a Matthew Perry vehicle all the way, and he drives this film with a self-assurance that isn't really a revelation. His acting talent has been apparent for a while now, as shown in his turns on Friends, his various feature films, and his acclaimed guest star spots on the West Wing (let's just ignore Serving Sara, shall we?). Here, he eschews his Chandler Bing goofball role and turns in a concertedly earnest and sincere effort. Good job, Matthew Perry.

These kids are certainly depicted as more disruptive and more rough-house than those in tamer films such as To Sir, with Love and Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. The kid actors are uniformly superb and real. Standouts are Hannah Hodson as the sassy Shameika (really excellent) and Brandon Smith as the troubled Tayshawn.

The Ron Clark Story merits superlatives of the highest order. The film is poignant, gentle, heartwarming, and inspirational. True, the ending is a bit hokey, but what the hey. Films like The Ron Clark Story, Stand and Deliver, and Lean On Me need to be made and put out every now and then, just to remind everyone of the importance of our society's oft overlooked linchpin  - the school teacher. And Ron Clark - for his dedication, his diligence, and his caring - needed to have his story told.

Even if he really shouldn't rap.",1158969600,72,4008,4.837956204379562

I bought this dvd for my daughter who is becoming a teacher and thought it would be helpful for her to help understand children and some of the learning disabilities some children face.

2659896,4,B000ION27Q,"This kind of movie often involves a teacher, a coach or any other kind of leader who changes a group of people -people disregarded by society or by an administrative body- and encourages them to triumph/win the big game/score high on exams. This genre of film has its own special fanbase.

It's not my cup of tea since it is too obviously manipulative and sentimental. However, the people for whom I bought this film -people in that special fanbase- enjoy it. That is why I give it four out of five stars.

Recommended for people who also love any of the following films:

Well, the price was under $5 and when added to a few other movies on my list of 'I'm looking for', easily reached the $25 worth of qualifying DVDs/Books to get Free Shipping. This is a good fun movie of an experienced suburbs teacher looking for more purpose and moves to the big city to teach in an urban poverty type school with a classroom of disrespectful trouble teens from broken or restrictive homes - students preforming far below their potential. Based on a true story it is a remarkable store of how Ron Clark grew as a teacher and turned around and helped a mostly rowdy bunch of teens make something of themselves. .",1366502400,,775,4.3517241379310345

2659917,5,B000ION27Q,"Unlike the flippant remark by the person who has never seen the movie that somehow made the title comment, as someone who HAS seen the movie, I believe it to be remarkable.

This is the story of a celebrated teacher who realizes that, in teaching in suburbia, he is filling a spot that any number of excellent teachers would love to fill; he decided that where he should be teaching is in the inner cities, where good teachers were truly needed.  He wanted to be able to give to those to whom few want to give. As a white teacher, he was at first completely mistrusted by his entire class.  He changed the lives of many in his class from students who didn't give a whit about learning into students who received perfect scores on their state tests.

If all American teachers were like Ron Clark, the US would not be last among the top ten educational systems among countries of the free world.  The US Educational system is a despicable wasteland of adults conned by psychologists that if we are demanding of our students we will destroy them and if we hold them back when they do not perform, we will destroy their psyches. Graduating US students are the stupidest in the world.  Why is America happy with that stigma?

And let us not forget parental responsibility for this, or should I say lack of responsibility. Not taking responsibility at all for their children or what they are or, in many cases, are not doing with regard to their education, many US parents are more concerned with getting the big promotion and being able to buy things than providing for their own children.  I do NOT mean providing for them materially - many US children have too much of that. I mean providing for their psyches, letting them know that they care whether or not their children do well in school and that not doing well in school is a punishable offense, drilling some responsibility into their own children: in short, taking a personal interest in their children and their education.

The Ron Clark story does more than entertain.  It teaches America the standards to which they should be aiming and subsequently succeeding.",1360713600,,2118,4.63903743315508

The fact that this is all based on the true story of Ron Clark is even more inspiring.  These are the true teachers and educators who overcome the obstacles that hinder education and bring our society down.  These are the people who make education work in spite of the system which should nurture and value it.

It shows that people can connect despite of their differences, older-younger, socio economical levels etc. It does have serious, mature issues which might shock some younger viewers. My preteen is 11 so she was surprised and saddened but not overly shocked. It is also an amazing portrait of just how far children can go when someone believes in them.

The dream wasn't just for himself, it was that indifferent and disadvantaged young boys and girls, against great odds, could become successful in life if only they could believe it was possible. Not only were the odds great against any of his students going beyond elementary school, the odds seemed even greater against Ron Clark making it through his first year of teaching in the toughest school in Harlem. But he had a dream and he was 'naive' enough and idealistic enough to believe he could reach that goal. While optimism and belief are essential, it is also helpful to have talent and Ron Clark is a very gifted and creative teacher. He was willing to experiment with various ways to reach this rebellious kids who wanted nothing to do with school or him. If making a fool of himself trying to 'double dutch' jump rope would get their attention, then so be it. The kids were more important than his ego. His relationships with parents should be an example for any teacher who really wants to make a difference with their students. This is one of those truly inspirational films and stories that comes along once in a great while. Not only has he helped students reach their potential but he has written a best selling book of classroom rules called THE ESSENTIAL 55 for teachers. We may not all have the same talents as Ron Clark but we can all be inspired to use what we have to the best of our ability and for the benefit of others.

I would have given it more than 5 stars if I could have.  Although the whole movie was super, one of my favorite scenes was when Ron learned to double dutch just to gain the confidence of his students (which by the way he actually did learn to double dutch). I thought Stand and Deliver, Lean on Me and Take the Lead were exceptional movies but this one was one step up from those.

I read recently that Ron Clark just took a bunch of kids I think it was to Europe or around the world, it was  a dream of his, what an amazing human being. People should read and learn.",1217721600,,448,3.806451612903226
2660146,4,B000ION27Q,"""The Ron Clark Story"" is exactly what it says: Ron Clark's story.  Like ""Mr. Holland's Opus"", this is based ona true story of a teacher determined to make a difference.  Ron Clark is in the inner city, where kids act tough and stubborn, and often get into trouble.  Ron was told not to expect much.  But his determination to hang on and somehow inspire these kids won out in the end...to the surprise of the other teachers and the principal.
Rather predictable storyline, but it's inspiring.
If you enjoyed ""Mr Holland's Opus"", chances are that you would also enjoy the ""Ron Clark Story"".  It's an any-age movie.... young, old, or in-between... anyone who needs a reminder that one person can make a difference in the lives of many!",1217635200,,732,4.6875
2660147,4,B000ION27Q,Great inspirational true story.  A remarkable man who went above and beyond to reach & inspire his students.  A must watch for teachers prior to starting the new school year.,1213747200,,174,4.766666666666667
2660148,4,B000ION27Q,"When movies tell stories about teachers, why does it always seem the same (with the exception of Half Nelson)? Here's usually how it goes, teacher is assigned to a particularly unruly group of students. It was hell during the first few days. And then there's going to be a turning point where everybody realizes that the teacher cares for them so they start to pay attention. And then boom... everybody's life is change... forever...

As tired as that formula is, I can't help but really like this TV movie. Sometimes being conventional is OK as long as you're doing it right. And I think this movie hits all the right notes. Being based on a true story of a relatively known educator does not hurt either. But I have to give credit to Matthew Perry, who even though will forever be Chandler to me, puts his comedic timing and his surprisingly low key dramatic chops into good use in this movie.

Some aspects of the story sometimes seemed to be too good to be true. And in the tradition of film adaptations, I wonder how much of the movie was altered for dramatic purposes. But that should be the least of your worries, I find this movie hugely entertaining and easy to watch. Definitely not a bad way to spend a few hours on.",1209340800,2,1227,4.473214285714286

We need more teachers like Mr. Clark who genuinely love kids and will put them in their places when needed! Mr. Clark taught the kids to believe in themselves and that made all of the difference in the world. Read the books by Ron Clark because they will be useful in the classroom and at home with parents!

The story may seem a bit cliche, but unlike some other movies with a similiar plot, this one is based on a true story. It's so inspirational and will have you laughing, crying, and even cheering for the characters throughout the entire movie.

2660152,5,B000ION27Q,"Having worked with at risk children and teens as both a counselor and a teacher, I must say that The Ron Clark Story is about as close to real as a movie is going to get. This movie hits on all cylinders for inspiration and drama as well as comedy in some of the moments of reaching his wayward students. I identify with most of what he attempted to do in order to get thru and actually teach his class, because it is the same arena of tactics that must be employed to truly teach these types of kids. But lets not forget that all kids need to be understood and our education system is buckling under the pressure of inevitable change that must happen so that there are less at risk kids to have to teach... especially all in one class. Ron Clark is a hero of the greatest kind.... a REAL one. Ron, if you are reading this, keep up the GREAT work. For the rest of you, make sure to see all of the special features so that you can meet the real Ron Clark and see his accomplishments rewarded. 5 stars +",1206921600,,1001,4.112244897959184

2660185,4,B000ION27Q,"You may think that caring teachers are in abundance, but believe me, they aren't.  As a teacher myself, who also served 2 years in Kazakhstan with the Peace Corps, I've seen more than my fair share of teachers who have simply given up.  They have resolved to simply go through the motions and just get through a day.  That isn't teaching.  It isn't even close to it.

More than ever in our society, we desperately need teachers who care; to take and active interest in kids who feel that they don't matter because nobody cares about them.  The scary fact is that the perception of these kids is not often wrong.

And so comes along Ron Clark, a young teacher from North Carolina who finds that New York City is in a desperate need for teachers, particularly in their inner city schools.  Most teachers would see this as tantamount to entering a war zone, but Clark sees this as a golden opportunity to do something.  He shows up to find that one particular sixth grade class at an elementary school in Harlem has gone through six teachers before the Christmas break.  He's offered the honors sixth grade class.  Ron wants the troublesome group.

This is an amazing story of how a young teacher was able to not only teach this class of students, but to also establish a connection with them.  In short, he had to prove to them that he was going to be there for them no matter what.  He proved to them that he cares.

Matthew Perry is obviously well known as Chandler Bing on the hit comedy, ""Friends,"" but few know that he can also be a very good dramatic actor as well.  He doesn't play Ron Clark as being too serious, because the real Ron Clark isn't.  He plays the part as well as it can be played.

The movie is done in similar fashion as other such films such as ""Stand & Deliver"" and ""Lean On Me.""  But you know what?  I never tire of such films.  You know why?  Because of what I said earlier.  There are so few teachers out there who can do what Ron Clark has done, that it's like finding a spot of gold in a flowing river.  They truly do inspire.

The only thing that I wished for this film, was that I wished it could have been longer.  I realize that this is a TV movie, but I still wished they could have spent more time showing Clark with his different styles of teaching.

Perhaps one of the best scenes in the film is when he shows up at a student's house to help her with her homework.  Suddenly, a neighbor shows up and hands off three children for her to look after.  ""I can't do my work right now.  I have to make dinner for the kids,"" she explains.  ""I'll cook dinner.  You do your homework,"" replies Clark.  The girl can hardly believe that someone is doing this for HER!  It is truly touching.

Be sure to watch the special features on this DVD.  See an interview with the real Ron Clark, his work on his brand new academy in Atlanta, Georgia, and his truly epic trip with 15 of his students to South Africa.

If you don't feel touched by this film, you may want to check and see if your heart is still beating!",1203206400,11,3032,4.256140350877193

2660188,4,B000ION27Q,"I purchased this movie sight unseen because I am a teacher and the capsule review interested me.  I didn't realize it was a TV movie, not a theatrical release.  It is based on true events in the life of Ron Clark, a teacher who had great success working with difficult students in elementary and middle schools in the South and in Harlem, raising test scores to previously unattainable levels.  The movie is very fast paced and entertaining, and will move most viewers repeatedly, but it glosses over what he did specifically, reducing it to simplification in order to keep the pace fast.  While I think most viewers will enjoy the
film and find it inspiring, I think you will have to read the book by the same name to find out most of what he did to accomplish so much.  It is in the tradition of ""Stand and Deliver"", and ""Lean on Me"".",1199318400,,836,4.437908496732026

Everyone is born with his or her kindness. That maybe the main reason for Mr. Clark's student's changing their minds. Together with Mr. Clark's creation and his encouragements to his students, he gets to be successful.
Mr. Clark knows clearly that the children are all very kind in their heart bottoms. Then he tries to use his true love and expectations for them t make them moved. We all know that one's habits or minds are quite difficult to change. Although during it Mr. Clark also feels depressed, things get to be better after his perseverance. Then, Mr. Clark hasn't been limited in the traditional way of teaching. He combines the history events with rap, which was so popular in the children. And the effect is so obvious. The children can remember them easily.
Besides, the children get to be more confident because of his encouragement. Once one has been confident, his or her potential ability comes out easily. Then they are sure to do a good job. That's just what they do in their exam.
In my point of view, Mr. Clark's true love, perseverance, creation and encouragements bring him to his success. And it seems that them are true of many other things.",1482969600,,1332,4.624472573839663
