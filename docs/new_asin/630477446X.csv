924186,4,630477446X,"This was a very engaging period drama based on some true events which occurred during the war.  Although perhaps the movie is a bit fanciful, it presents (with an Irish sense of humor included) a picture of history that is little-known to the American audience.  I would definitely watch this again and again.  Byrne fans may be a bit disappointed that his role is not greater in the story, but even so, it is very, very good. (Oh, and there are horses in it toooooo!)",1207094400,2,468,4.482352941176471
924187,5,630477446X,"I really loved this movie with very strong performances from the lead actors and the debut of dance star Jean Butler is truly fantastic and the dance gig she performs is worth 5 stars on its own and i am suprised Bill  Campbell isn't a bigger star that he is, Angus maCfadden showing what a  fine and underated actor he is as the German and the dvd is very good as it  includes a decomentary of the real life camp of WWII,i highly reccomend  this movie if you like real life ar stories as it has  everything,action,comedy,romance ,fights etc and includes many excellent  performances from UK Tv stars including Joe McGann and John Gordon  Sinclair,but for me it is the astounding beauty of Jean Butler`s  performance that lights up the screen and makes this movie a must.",949017600,6,771,4.576642335766423
924188,5,630477446X,"although there was not much fighting(killing) in this movie, i love it the way they showed more of the relationship between two different sides without actually killing each other. and plus wow that Jean Butler is  beautiful, i love her in the riverdance! yeah go Jean go! hehe! good movie,  get it! all i can say",947462400,9,313,4.571428571428571
924189,5,630477446X,"I've seen the movie twice by choice because it  presents (I believe) a  place in time of which the world knows little. I believe the producers,  director and actors faithfully portrayed four important cultures in an  unusual setting during WWII, the Irish, English, Americans, and Germans. I  merely stumbled on the movie while surfing with my dish; I was held  spellbound during my first and second viewing. The film and concept are  absolutely fascinating, historically significant, and well done.  END",906681600,11,504,5.2125

7877204,1,630477446X,"I had the PAL version of this DVD but was disappointed to have to put up with the pan and scan full screen transfer of the film.
I was delighted whilst browsing on Amazon.com, to find there was a widescreen 1.85 to one version available from a private seller. I bought this straight away and it arrived today 06/12/2014. To my dismay I found that this was not as described, and it also was a pan and scan full screen version.",1417824000,4,425,4.2592592592592595

7877206,5,630477446X,"This film deals with the British and German pilots, and Navy men, interned in an Irish prison camp during World War II. Ireland was neutral, and obliged to imprison any belligerent military personnel, keeping the two sides separated. A great film, with a lot of good actors, and River dancing, just for you. Get it, Watch it, Love it. J. Russell",1400544000,,345,4.672131147540983
7877207,5,630477446X,"I love Gabriel Byrne.  I consider this a light comedy even though the background story is not funny.  RAF pilots being show down and landing in Ireland where they are detained for the duration of the war. Ireland was neutral.  An agreement was made with Britain that they would not release RAF pilot back into duty in England and would not release German U-Boat survivors back to Germany. The men (both sides) were in a detention camp where the RAF pilots and German survivors were separated by barbed wire. The men could get passes to leave the camp daily and so there was interaction outside the camp.  There was also Romance - Jean Butler of Riverdance fame was great.  On a personal note, On a visit to a relative in Ireland, he told me that he remembered these camps during World WarII.",1386720000,,791,4.542253521126761
7877208,5,630477446X,Love the scenes and sets in this movie. A great insight into life in Ireland during WW2 (which was neutral).,1380585600,,108,4.45
7877209,5,630477446X,During  World  War  2  the  Irish  government  as  part  of  it's  policy of  neutrality  had  an  agreement  with  London  and  Berlin  that  any  combatants  caught  in  Ireland  from  either side  would  be  interned  for  the  duration  of  the  war. The  film  centers  around  a  love  triangle  with  two  pilots  one  German  and  one  Canadian  falling  in  love  with  a  local  Irish  girl. Security  at  the  camp  is  very  lax  which  allows  for  plenty  of  mixing  between  the  allies  and  the  Germans  as  well  as  day  passes  which  allow  the  interned  soldiers  to  mix  and  socialise  around  the  local  town. This  is  where  our  2  main  characters  meet  and  fall  for  Jean  Butler's  (of  Riverdance  fame)  Character. The  film  is  both  funny  at  times  and  serious  and  all  in  all  is  a  really  great find.,1338508800,,854,4.440298507462686
7877210,5,630477446X,"'The Brylcreem Boys' is an excellent addition to your WWII library, giving insight to what it was like to be a POW in Ireland during the war. It showcases animosity and compassion between the Germans and the Allies sitting out the war in the same camp and their struggles to regain their freedom.",1324771200,,296,4.60377358490566
