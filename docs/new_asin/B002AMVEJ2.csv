3889924,5,B002AMVEJ2,"Another very interesting angle on the workings and machinations of the Law. This time the focus is on the District Attorney's angle and counterpointed by the Court appointed legal aid lawyers' point of view.

It is also a scary reminder that justice is really blind and imparts rulings according to the agenda of the DA's office and does not often take into consideration the merits of the case and mete out mercy with justice.  Luckily, a jury can be a better option for a fair result. But,not always!  And so the story goes on!  Very addictive.",1275091200,6,546,4.65625
3889925,5,B002AMVEJ2,This is a continuation of a wonderful series. It didn't miss a beat. It's as good as the first season. I loved it.,1274745600,4,114,4.0
3889926,5,B002AMVEJ2,"Being an avid fan of Steven Bochco drama, I picked up a dvd copy of ""Raising The Bar - The Complete First Season"" when it was first released, back in June.  His first rate writing and production credits continue, along with the stellar cast he chose to breathe life into this, his latest legal drama.  Whilst visiting the U.S. recently, I tuned in to TNT and caught up with some Second Season episodes.  Suffice is to say, I am looking forward to a Complete Second Season DVD release.  Steven Bochco's contribution to lifting the standards of television drama are very much appreciated by this loyal popular culture/media enthusiast.

YEEEHHH!!!! As of Tuesday 23rd February 2010, it has been announced ""Raising The Bar - The Complete Second Season"" has a DVD street date.  Well done Lionsgate!!!!",1260316800,21,797,4.866666666666666

3889932,5,B002AMVEJ2,"Totally realistic in its legal, procedural and courtroom accuracy. Very unrealistic as too the Public Defenders being only good and Prosecutors bad. Simply not true and show definitely bias. There are some bad defenders and some very noble and ethical prosecutors in the world. Five stars because it was an honest picture of how the system works. It was also very good on its representation of Judges.",1410307200,,401,5.0

3889934,5,B002AMVEJ2,"Unfortunately this show didn't last as long as I would have liked. It had superb acting and wonderful story lines, and making it more realistic by not always having the good guys triumph. I t also lets you get a peek at how sneaky D.A's can be when prosicuting someone. What seasons of it there are, are definitely worth buying.",1402444800,,328,4.483333333333333
3889935,5,B002AMVEJ2,"I love it.  I was very sad when the show wasn't re-newed.  All the actors were very good in the roles they played. I saw all but two shows when on tv, I've watched them all again since buying the dvd.",1395100800,,200,3.8536585365853657

3889937,5,B002AMVEJ2,"My review is about the show in its entirety not just this episode. Raising the Bar made the work and life of the public defenders come to life. If the show is 50% realistic, I truly don't know how public defenders live with all the heart break. Yes, there are guilty, violent offenders that we are grateful when they are caught and put in prison.  But, watching how our criminal system handles a mother who steals a $3 bottle of milk for her starving children or police officers who harass an innocent woman because they think she is a witness to murder although she was in her apartment and didn't witness the crime. These police officers go as far as getting an emergency order (but untrue) that puts her young children into foster care so she has to chose between getting her children back versus making a false witness statement. My father had a career in law enforcement and he was honest to a fault so I know these tactics do happen in real life.

It is too bad Raising the Bar only ran for two seasons. It is a wonderful drama.",1394323200,,1034,4.380208333333333
3889938,5,B002AMVEJ2,"Wow--every show is wonderful !

Don't miss a single episode.

3889940,4,B002AMVEJ2,"I have never watched this series before, but i had to for an ethics class, and i actually like what i seen in this episode.  The episode was ""Making Up is Hard to do.""

I don't give it five stars, because to me, a series has to be up there like ""House,"" and i don't think this compares at all to House...

3889942,5,B002AMVEJ2,"I have rarely seen such a combination of great acting, great directing, and inspired story in a TV series, or in a movie, for that matter. When the three ingredients of story, directing, and acting click and flow, I am drawn into the world being depicted and begin to enjoy the show rather than being distracted by self-conscious acting or uninspired directing or story that doesn't allow me to lose myself in the show. This show was refreshing and a gem. In my humble opinion it's certainly on par with the massively more popular Damages or Mad Men, although not as much of a production. It's a shame not many people got to see it and that it was cancelled. Some other network should snap it up.",1316822400,,696,4.488188976377953
3889943,4,B002AMVEJ2,I enjoyed this movie.  It was a keep you on the edge of your seat drama. I like law and this gives a interesting side of it.  Just how a lawyer should fight for his/her clients. Great job!!!,1311465600,,190,3.973684210526316
3889944,3,B002AMVEJ2,I almost quit watching because the Judge's character seemed downright mean and focused on making decisions that didn't make any sense. Hope they kill her off. I also didn't understand why a gay guy would want to have an affair with her. I am glad that Jerry got a haircut. This went up a star just for that.,1308441600,,307,4.310344827586207

3889946,4,B002AMVEJ2,I absolutely enjoy this series.  Looking at things from the Office of the Public Defender gives you such a different viewpoint and makes you realize nothing is ever just black and white.  Keep it coming with a third season!,1289692800,7,223,4.6923076923076925

8359869,5,B002AMVEJ2,"This legal drama has a great mix of characters who are Public Defenders from all walks of life. There's the ongoing driving nature of a talented Pubic Defender who recognizes the Don Quixote in his fervor of advocacy for his clients....and more which are fun to discover as you watch, and I'd not want to give anything away :-) As many TV shows go, with each episode the characters develop more depth and in turn we become more engaged in the stories. Season 2 was even better than Season 1. Gifted Public Defenders going up against somewhat talented Assistant District Attorneys who are the prosecutors, and the fun of some eccentric judges. I enjoyed this show, and hated to see it end. It's not ""Suits"", ""Boston Legal"", ""Private Practice"" or ""Ally McBeal""...but it's good. Worthwhile TV.",1441584000,2,790,4.8161764705882355
8359870,3,B002AMVEJ2,"A truthful look at the impossible facing public defenders. They lack money, and bargaining chips and also face distain of judges. However storyline concerning actors is quite lame. One gives the office 3 million dollars, another adopts a clients baby. Too bad the writers didn't have the conviction to emphasize courtroom drama.",1440979200,,328,5.326923076923077
