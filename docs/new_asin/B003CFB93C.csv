8656856,5,B003CFB93C,"Sexy and dangerous is the lethal recipe that our hero, Kera Moore (played very sleek and sexy by amazing actress Tarjatta Rose) feeds the nefarious blood sucking vampires in Night of the Jackals! This film pays great homage to the campy horror films of Saturday Night, before cable/satellite, local network television station's creep shows yesteryears. DeWitt Jones intellectual weaves answers to the ""what if's"" regarding the possibilities of monsters plaguing our streets. It's obvious that DeWitt Jones is a big fan of science, politics and cheesy horror films. However he actually put science in fiction with great believability regarding neurological sciences. A lot of rules are broken which passes by you because the story does not focus too much on technique than great story telling. A brilliant tour de force of work by two hot sexy sisthas taking it to the Man!!! Look for a break out performance by Angela Dobbs as Detective Rose. Scary, exciting, and finally FINALLY black women are not exploitative in this horror film they are forced to be respected!",1271203200,,1065,5.126436781609195
