5903337,5,B00ECIS3W8,What a  great story based on a true avent.....This show showed how humans still care about our four legged friends.....,1391990400,,119,4.95
5903338,3,B00ECIS3W8,"Story on how a community mobilizes to save two horses trapped in snow. Good overall story, but could have benefited from a little more editing and focus. Too much time spent on how hard the family at the core has it and how much economic hard times hit them and their community...I would have played down those themes and focused on the core story. My 4 yr old daughter likes everything horses, but this film didn't capture her attention. Not a bad movie, but not quite good, just ""okay""",1391990400,,487,4.48314606741573
5903339,4,B00ECIS3W8,"I liked this movie because it was an enjoyable family watch. Everyone, from pre-teens to adults, will get something from the movie.",1389052800,,131,5.0
5903340,5,B00ECIS3W8,"This is such a great movie, we have watched several times now & will again.  We have a lot of your really good movies, a very nice & large collections",1388620800,,150,4.0
5903341,2,B00ECIS3W8,Not worth your time or money.  Just a goofy story line.  Could not wait to finish it.  Bought it thinking it was a family story and it may have been but a dumb story.,1387152000,2,166,3.823529411764706
5903342,5,B00ECIS3W8,"This was an uncomplicated,yet moving story of how an entire community came together to save two helpless horses.  It even has a moral at the end!  I enjoyed the camaraderie shown between the two actors who played the Dad and daughter.
It highlighted the special kid of bond that I shared with my Dad!",1385596800,3,300,4.537037037037037
5903343,4,B00ECIS3W8,"Teh 1st 30 minutes is all TV movie, not bad but not great either but from that point on watch out it gets real good. almost as good as the true life story  book was to read. I highly recommend",1384992000,,192,3.8
5903344,5,B00ECIS3W8,"This movie was one of the best family flicks I've seen this year!  The acting though not academy award quality, was superb.  All the actors, including the horses and their stunt doubles were perfectly cast.  For a true story movie, it held pretty close to the real life adventure.  I liked the dynamics of this family's life... .living and working together, working out problems and difficulties together.  It was impressively a real life family situation.  Aidan Quinn has matured as an actor these days and comes across totally credible. A job well done.  Buy this DVD and make your life just a little bit better.",1384473600,12,615,4.8
5903345,5,B00ECIS3W8,"Drags a wee bit and melodramatic in others but it is such a feel good, family movie I had to give it 5 stars.

8603872,5,B00ECIS3W8,"Maybe if those Canadian horses had gotten stuck during, say, Victoria Day or Boxing Day, there wouldn't have been such an onrush of a sense of community. But it happened on Christmastime when folks were at their most sappy and most won't to see good in their fellow man. The Horses of McBride (a.k.a. Christmas Rescue) first aired in 2012, and it's based on a true happening. In real life, in December of 2008, the Jeck family of McBride, British Columbia rallied their neighbors to go pick up shovels and dig out two abandoned pack horses trapped in deep snow near the summit of Mount Renshaw.

What's uncertain is how much was truth behind the family tension that confounds the Davidson family in the movie (Davidsons = Jecks). Times are tough for the village of McBride. Both the local mills had shut down. The Davidsons were hit particularly hard. Churlish mountain man Matt Davidson (Aidan Quinn) has no recourse but to sell the ranch - which is so remote it can't access the Internet - and move to PG (that's Prince George) where prospects may not be so bleak. His wife Avril (Kari Matchett) and son Kenny (Edward Ruttle) are down with the plan. The one fierce holdout is his daughter Nicki (MacKenzie Porter). See, she loves their rugged life. The bitter conflict that surfaces between her and her dad lends some bite to the plot going forward.

But some things simply matter more than a trifling family feud. The plight of the confined horses compels them to an unspoken truce as they go see about helping. Come the concerned animal lovers and environmentalists and a veterinarian dispatched by the SPCA - except he's more an expert on dolphins - but, in the end, it's Nicki whose stubborn streak frustrates her dad but then inspires him and then inspires everyone else. Temperatures sink to the 30s and below. Winds buffet up to 80 kilometers an hour. Mountain cats and howling wolves prowl. There's a scene in which our gruff mountain man remarks that he's imparted to his children ""a little common sense and a tiny piece of this planet."" Yes, to the second bit, no to the first bit. Common sense is keeping a wide berth from what Nicki sets out to do. Unfazed, she starts digging and digging and digging. She figures the only way to free the buried horses is to dig a trench all the way to the logging road. It's three kilometers to the logging road.

The elephant in the room is that A Heartland Christmas, inspired by the same event, aired first, in 2010. That doesn't at all diminish the heart and the watchability of this movie. It's an above-average holiday movie, abetted by heartfelt performances that bleed raw emotions and bolstered by stunning cinematography that captures the ruggedness and indifferent menace of the snowy mountainous landscape. There are lessons to be learned about teamwork and selflessness and how an unflagging spirit can shine on and inspire others to extraordinary efforts. The Horses of McBride presents a genuine drama flecked by the occasional stray bit of comedy. Word was, back in 2008, the unlikely excavation captured the heart and imagination of the Canadian folks. It was on the national news. Word was, in McBride, all Christmas festivities were suspended as everyone rolled up their sleeves and snagged a shovel. Canadians are such nice people. If Michael J. Fox, Cline Dion, Alanis Morrisette, and Bieber were in McBride at the time, I've no doubt the first three would've grabbed a shovel.",1488412800,,3447,4.7899159663865545

8603875,4,B00ECIS3W8,"Perhaps a bit on the Mushy side. But I thought it was well done. Definitely a ""feel good movie"". Especially so, when you consider that it's based on a true story!",1485907200,2,162,4.258064516129032
