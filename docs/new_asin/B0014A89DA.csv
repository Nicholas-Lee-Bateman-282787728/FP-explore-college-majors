8254775,4,B0014A89DA,I recently got into Water Polo from watching it on the Olympics. This is a good DVD but it is a little pixelated from watching it on a by 20 inch screen. I would image that this problem would get much worse if you were to watch it on a forty inch screen. $85 is obviously way to much to pay for this product but it is worth the $25 that you can spend by buying it on NCAA on demand.,1264809600,,382,3.728395061728395
