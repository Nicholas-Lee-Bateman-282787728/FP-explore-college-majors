8525329,5,B0085A9K8A,"This DVD delivers on all 3 points as promised: 1) Tai Chi 24 Compact Form; Cheng Man Ching Short Form and yes the Tai Chi-Qigong-Shibashi 18 Movement Form.
Per another review, if you're only getting the Shibashi Form, you have a defect disk and should get a replacement disk. My disk had all 3 form segments.
All forms are reasonable explained with narrative and captions of the movement names where appropriate. I wish the DVD had an insert of the movement names. But, you can go to ""Tai Chi Nation"" web site and find a list of the movement names.
