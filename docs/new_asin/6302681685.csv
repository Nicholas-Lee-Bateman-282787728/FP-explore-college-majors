496381,4,6302681685,"It's been a few years since I've seen this, but I remember it being  enjoyable, a little bit of everything : comedy, drama,  music. A somewhat  predictable story line but overall well done....with some good country  music to boot.  I've always liked George Strait, and was pleasantly  surprised by his seemingly effortless ability to act. He is completely at  home in front of the camera, very  natural.  Leslie Anne Warren turns in a  great supporting performance, too. One of her more memorable roles. If you  like George Strait, you'll love this movie. If you're not a fan, you  will  be after you see this film!",965433600,5,615,4.742857142857143
496382,5,6302681685,"Have you ever seen a movie that absolutely changed everything you thought a movie was supposed to be?  This is the one for me.  There is a little of everything.  Some parts are funny, some parts are exciting.  There is  action, comedy, drama and one of the most wonderful love stories you'll  ever know.  The last seen will leave you breathless.  Bring the kleenex.  I've seen it 33 times and I sstill get chills.  If you haven't seen it yet,  do yourself a favor, buy or rent it today.",917395200,3,486,4.348314606741573
496383,5,6302681685,"If you like country music, comedy, and a bit of romance thrown in, you'll absolutely love this movie.  The first time I saw it I fell in love.

496705,3,6302681685,George Strait plays the biggest country star in the world.  And after getting fed up with all the lights and smoke during a concert.  Walks away leaving everybody especially his manager in a panic.  Because of all the glitz and smoke she decides a member of his band can take his place nd no one will know the difference.  He kicks back and meets a girl and starts working on her ranch for her.  He seems like a natural on a horse and has kind of a laid back personality and does rather well in this.  Mostly this movie is for George Strait fans.  It has an excellent sound track that sold zillions of copies and won awards too.,1514505600,,628,4.226890756302521

497313,3,6302681685,"Pure Country is a 1992 film about country music. It stars George Strait, Lesley Ann Warren, Isabel Glasser, Kyle Chandler, and Rory Calhoun. It was directed by Christopher Cain (Young Guns).

The story is about a modern-day country music superstar named Dusty Chandler. Disillusioned with the kind of pop-rock-country music he feels  hes being forced to sing, he suddenly walks away after a concert performance in order to find himself and get back to his roots. He  visits his grandmother, and then takes his old guitar and sets out on the road

His devious and conniving manager, Lula Rogers, is beside herself. She sends some roadies out to find Dusty before the next scheduled stop on the tour. She decides to make a contingency plan in case Dusty doesnt make it back in time. She concocts a scheme involving a roadie impersonator and a lot of lip-syncing

Meanwhile, Dusty has found a place to board at a horse ranch. Here he can think, write songs, and play his guitar. He quickly notices and falls in love with the ranch owners daughter

Pure Country is strictly average fare. Obviously designed as a vehicle to kick-start a film career for George Strait, it didn't succeed in this regard. The story line is simply too mundane and clich&eacute;-ridden, and Straits performance, while not exactly bad, is mediocre at best. Warren, Glasser, Chandler, and Calhoun all deliver very good performances, however. And the music of George Strait, which features the hits Heartland and I Cross My Heart, is simply superb.

Despite the many serious flaws in the film, Pure Country still manages to be pretty entertaining. Its good, escapist bubble gum for the mind that I enjoy watching from time to time.  Recommended.",1464652800,3,1715,4.9100346020761245

497438,5,6302681685,"Great movie with an interesting plot. A lot of  truth can come out of the movie depending on how you watch it. Watch it with the whole family as there really is no cussing or live sex going on. Just real life issues one would face as a classic country western singer caught up in the loud music, fancy flashy clothes, & glamor of light & smoke of todays modern world. This movie is clean enough for the whole family to watch & might even teach a few about moral bonding & one returning back to one's roots (as Dusty's Grandma may say) & making amends for wrong doings. The movie was really made for the entire family & I know I shed both a tear & a smile after watching for the 1st time.
& the 2nd time.
 & the 3rd time.
  & the 4th time.
Probably the sweetest part of the whole movie is the end, Dusty wins the heart of his love Harley back & Dusty's widowed Grandmother Ivy is shown flirting with  Ernest Harley's widowed Dad.",1457481600,,928,4.133333333333334

498409,5,6302681685,"This movie is a sweet story.  It is loaded with performances and music by George Strait (King George).  It is also a sweet and old fashioned love story.

The story seems so true to who George Strait is.  Someone once asked me what the big deal was about George Strait's music, and I told them that he always sang like he was still performing in honky tonks, mixed right in with people, (much the way George Jones always sung).  And this movie shows that feeling of how a big country star named Dusty gets tired of the lights, the glitz, the smoke, the craziness of it all.  At the beginning of the movie Dusty is in the middle of a performance and he stops singing and nobody even notices.  So he just walks away after the performance.  He disappears, goes back to his grandma's, picks up his old guitar and goes back to his roots, along the way finding a feisty woman named Harley who he falls in love with.  It's just a sweet story with great music.",1406160000,6,951,4.297752808988764

498597,5,6302681685,"If there ever was an allegory for the way music stars should live their lives, Dusty's story In P. C.  matches the way the King of country music still lives his.  No glitz. Just good country. Clever music lyrics.  Up-tempo tunes at times. Then sad and wistful.  And songs of love. Ah for the real country music of the '90's.  A decent job of acting by Mr. Strait in the film.  My wife and I must have paid a bundle to view ""Pure Country"" in several different theaters when it first came out.  And I still have the official movie poster used in the display window of a local theater when ""Pure Country"" was playing, in late '93 or 94, I think.  I taught literature as an English professor for a long time.  Even just a few years ago when I mentioned that  ""Pure Country"" was one of the best movies ever, the youngsters, especially the female ones would smile real big and tell me they loved this movie, too.  As Mr. Strait's entertainment career winds down, this film will remain as a testimony to the way things used to be when country music was true country music.  What a legacy Strait leaves.  What a cool guy he is--and you can grasp his charisma--and his greatness in this film.  Paul Jones",1391126400,3,1195,4.34841628959276

498704,2,6302681685,"This is one of those tried and true formulaic films that has legions of fans, mostly in the south, thanks to the lead turn by the famous George Strait.  Sad to say, outside of that beautiful theme song (`I Cross My Heart') this film fails to be anything other than a notch in Strait's belt.  His performance is void of all emotion, and the clich ridden plot cannot rise above the film's flaws.  The pacing is terrible and leads to a rather bland and emotionless ride that wears thin mere minutes in and drags on far longer than it should have.  This is not an engaging or a rewarding film, and Strait isn't the only `actor' messing up here.  Even Lesley Ann Warren muddles everything to the point of being an irritant.  My sister loves this.  It's `pure country' and that excites her, but for anyone not connected to the core of the film (mainly their love for all things George Strait) then this is going to a giant waste of time.",1376006400,,931,4.377906976744186

I laughed, cried & wished I was Harley Tucker when he was singing to her in front of the crowd!  My only complaint is George Strait is no actor but his warmth through his music and his sexy smile pull him out of that alright. I will never forget going to the movies to see this. I ""Cross My Heart""(favorite George Strait song ever)!!!",1372636800,,417,4.2784810126582276

498826,4,6302681685,"I listen to a little Country Music now and then. As a younger person I used to listen to a lot more but my tastes have gradually changed over the last six decades. However, I was shopping for DVDs in the Wal-Mart five-dollar bins and came across ""Pure Country"" starring George Strait, Lesley Ann Warren and Isabel Glasser. Well, I figured, that might make a nice addition to my music DVD collection, particularly since that modest collection had no country entries. Into the shopping cart it went and onto the TV it went last night.

My first impression of the movie was negative. The sound was awful. I have a big-rig stereo (100 watts/channel, 7 speakers including dual 12-inch woofers and an 80-watt powered sub-woofer) and the sound came across as loud and muddy. The acoustics of the hall must have been terrible. I couldn't make out hardly any of the lyrics and even couldn't recognize the song itself. Yet, the people in the movie were all having a great time with it. Then a funny thing happened. The band manager talked to a another person and English subtitles appeared beneath the image. I chuckled. They were badly needed, that's for sure! But even funnier, those English subtitles stayed and were there even through all parts of the movie where there wasn't music in the background. I'd never seen a movie like this, at least not an American movie in America and with English subtitles. Well, they were helpful with all that noise and also helped with the strong country accents exhibited by  some of the actors. Strange movie.

The acting was low grade and it took me a long time to get used to it. Well, they were portraying country folk and they came across as, well, country folk. It took a while for me to adjust, but I gradually came to feel that I was deep in country territory. I'd have to say it was effective, but I'm still not certain if it was intentional or the side effects of really bad acting. My feeling is, it's the latter. All of this probably comes across as snobbish and disrespectful, but I enjoyed this movie very much. It took a long time to win me over, but by the end of the movie I regarded it as an excellent movie and I think you might especially enjoy the movie if you're deeply immersed in Country Music and used to country people. I guess I'd have to say that it's a somewhat crudely done but a very enjoyable movie.

First off, I put the DVD in my player on the widescreen side. Unfortunately, no matter which side I put the disc on, it was full-screen format. Second, the sound isn't that great. The movie hasn't been enhanced in any way, shape, or form. The sound is that of a VHS and those gross little white specks from older, non-enhanced films make quite a few appearances. I was hoping it would have been upgraded to be compatible with surround systems. Lastly, and thank God it's fixable, subtitles are always turned on when you start the movie. At first, I thought I accidentally hit the button, but when I turned the movie off halfway through and resumed later, I found that it was something to be dealt with every time.

While I did enjoy the movie, I'm not happy with the DVD release.",1351987200,2,894,4.315476190476191

499206,5,6302681685,"Quite a few years ago now I picked up a DVD in a video store here in Australia called Pure Country. Hooked by the back cover's promise of a romance, and being a published romance author myself, I just couldn't resist it. Right from the start of the movie, the first-rate songs and big production numbers sung by the handsome country star had me enthralled. Fascinated by the unfolding story, I settled back to enjoy it all. And then my husband walked in, took one look at the screen and said, ""That's George Strait"" and I said, ""Who?"" I had no idea who George Strait was. I'd never heard of him, and I'd never been a big fan of country music. ""He's big in the States,"" my husband said, and I made a mental note to check out this George Strait on the internet after the movie was finished.

But first, the movie. To be honest George is a better singer than an actor. But putting that aside, I found myself falling in love with the plot, the characters, the songs, and the touches of humour. What woman wouldn't want to fall in love with such a handsome stranger who turned up on her ranch? And wouldn't the man who has everything but love, fall hard for the woman who saw him for himself and not as the biggest country music star in the States?

There were a couple of defining moments in the movie that really make it a wonderful romance for me. I don't think I'm giving away any spoilers by mentioning the scene where Harley is line-dancing and sees Wyatt sitting there at the table watching her. She smiles at him - and the world recedes as something passes between them. There's also the scene where Wyatt and Harley are dancing together, and you can see they are falling in love. And that ending! I won't spoil it but you're in for a treat.

And after the movie? Yep, I went straight to the internet and looked up George Strait. Oh wow! I can't believe I'd never heard of the man before or his songs. Now I've got nearly all his CDs and I love listening to them. And whenever I listen to the Pure Country CD, I find myself remembering the movie.

Highly recommended. A keeper for me.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/His-Ring-Her-Baby-Silhouette-Desire/dp/0373730217/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">His Ring, Her Baby (Silhouette Desire)</a>",1289001600,,2282,4.6975

 So after the show, Dusty just walks off the stage, and goes back to his childhood home, to revist memories. Then while revisting his old stomping grounds, Dusty falls in love with a beautiful, rodeo girl named Harley, who has no idea of who Dusty really is!

 I loved the beautiful country roads, and the old downtown barber shop, and diner, and Grandma Ivy's home, and I just love George Straight, he is so good looking, and I believe, that he is very much like the character ,that he plays in the movie, except that George, is also a rodeo cowboy in real life, and I love his pretty singing voice, and his music!

499284,4,6302681685,"Pure Country is a good movie if you like Country Music--as played by George Strait. Strait acts in it, something he hasn't done before or since, and plays a character named Dusty Wyatt Chandler who is a big Country star.

Dusty feels like he is not really playing the kind of music he wants to--his act is packaged like a 70's arena rock band with pyrotechnics and bright lights, and the show is so tightly choreographed that even if he drops out and stops singing in the middle of a song, no one even notices. He takes a hiatus to get back to his Pure Country roots. Earl Blackstock (John Doe of Los Angeles punk rock group X), his drummer, tries to find him--followed by Lula Rogers (Lesley Anne Warren) his manager, who has desperately tried to replace Dusty with road crew member Buddy Jackson (Kyle Chandler). Buddy's a wannabe singer and aspiring songwriter. Buddy lip syncs to a tape of Dusty and they are able to pull off an entire show, but no one is happy about it--except perhaps Buddy, who thinks he is now a big star.

Meanwhile Dusty is wooing rodeo rider Harley Tucker (Isabel Glasser), while working as a ranch hand on her father Ernest Tucker's (Rory Calhoun) ranch. Will the two love birds (Dusty and Harley) ever get together? That is the question. Will Dusty return to show business, albeit playing pure country music the way he wants? That is the even bigger question. If the story sounds a little hokey, that's because it is. But the story is really nothing more than an excuse for some really good music, after all, George Strait has an incredible number of hits, and he has been successful while remaining true to his country roots.

George Strait should stick to what he does best--singing, but in a role that so closely resembles who he is, he did a great job. One thing though: even though he had a beard, ponytail, flashy clothes, and a fancier cowboy hat as the ""before"" Dusty--the impure Country singer--he still didn't dance. If George Strait ever starts dancing, then it's all over; but wouldn't it have been truer to the story if he had? In fact, the central metaphor of the film was the dancing chicken Earl and he had seen at the County Fair; where they peaked backstage and saw the barker cuing up the chicken music with one hand while turning on a stove underneath the stage with the other. They wondered: why didn't the chicken just jump off the stage? (What? And give up Show Biz?!?!?)?

John Doe was good as the loyal sidekick Earl Blackstock, but I felt sorry for him having to deliver the corniest lines in the movie:

----------------------------------
Dusty Wyatt Chandler: Man, I should've known you'd find me. How'd you do it?
Earl Blackstock: Oh, something to do with trees and roots. You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Dusty Wyatt Chandler: Grandma Ivy.
==================================================

----------------------------------
Lula Rogers: [Earl is leaning against the back of Dusty's tour bus, breathing in the exhaust fumes] Earl, *what* are you doing?
Earl Blackstock: Just tryin' to feel like I was back in California.
================================================

Was this the same man I shared a bottle of Jack Daniels with at a wrap party for a documentary on William S. Burroughs given at Survival Research Laboratories? The man I watched as stage manager at the Russian Center in San Francisco lead seminal Los Angeles punk band X, singing duets with his wife Exxene while pounding out the beat on his bass guitar with drummer Don Bonebreak, and the phenomenal Billy Zoom on guitar? Well, of course it was, and Doe was probably having the time of his life due to an early interest in Country Music, what with the obvious parallels to punk rock, and he fit right in with the musicians, who were played by George Strait's actual group.

Lesley Ann Warren was fantastic as band manager and impresario Lula Rogers. She was a cougar on the prowl, always keeping an eye out for fresh young talent. The friction between Dusty and her was palpable:

-----------------------------
Lula Rogers: If it wasn't for me, you would probably still be singing in some run-down rat hole for a bunch of fat cowgirls from Iowa.
Dusty Wyatt Chandler: Yeah, and if it wasn't for me, you would probably be a waitress there.
==============================================

This was the last movie for Rory Calhoun, who has hundreds of film and television credits going back as far as 1944. He has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for film and one for television. He has also served time in San Quentin. He added a lot to Pure Country, or grits ain't groceries.

In the beginning of the film you hear a young boy singing about the joys of pure Country Music. One would assume that this is meant to be a young Dusty, and indeed, it is the voice of George Strait's son, George Jr., AKA Bubba. He sings it totally out of tune, which made me wonder if George Strait's talent skipped a generation--or maybe he sounded just like his son when he was his age, but through hard work and dedication he developed his voice to the point that he is at today--a star Country Singer with tons of hit records to his name.

499308,4,6302681685,"George Strait has been a headline country and western star for a long time now, and when he made this movie, he showed he was more than capable of holding his own in good company. What a shame this was his only film !
Colonel Tom Parker was a friend of Strait's manager and told him that George Strait had the same kind of charisma on film that the great Elvis Presley had,and that a movie career was his for the asking.
However, the long delays between takes, the endless sitting around on the set was not appealing to George and he was never keen to repeat the experience.
However, playing a singer who is sick and tired of the remoteness of his live performances, huge stadiums and lots of special effects, and no real contact with his audiences,  was a role tailor made for an artist as good as George Strait.
His character Dusty, decides to escape the mindless existence he is currently living and walks away, hitches a ride and heads for anonimity.
It is while he is ""on the run"" that he meets a young woman rodeo rider, well played by Isabel Glasser who takes him home where he awakes with a cruel hangover to meet her family, including her father the late Rory Calhoun in one of his last roles.
The soundtrack of Pure Country was a best selling album for George Strait and stands on its own as a fine album. The song, I Cross My Heart sung at the end of the film became a favourite request at weddings, a beautiful love song indeed. Other great songs include Thoughts Of A Fool, The King Of Broken Hearts, Heartland, When Did You Stop Loving Me, and all are  worthy of countless replays.

499371,5,6302681685,"I am not a Country Music fan. In fact, I don't seriously listen to any music... maybe Mozart and Bach. And this movie was made as a star vehicle for the most successful Country Music singer in our time. It has lots of songs, sung right through, and a hit CD with studio versions. So why have I watched it over ten times since I found the VHS in a remainders bin at the video rental? Why have I persuaded visitors and family members to give it a try with me? Why have I emailed the writer asking about details?

This movie has a tinsel cover, but little of the light that shines out of it comes from the dance hall. It is fundamentally a movie about values. The shining human values of hard work, duty, prudence, loyalty, friendhip, and most of all the meaning of human endeavour. ""You don't disturb a man when he is working!"" Even the marvelously contemporary and deeply moving love story, with its climax in perfectly romantic lyrics sealed with a kiss, is a layer of Fabergee enamel on the pure gold of what it means to be a North American man or woman of the classic mould. That is: strong, silent, wise, and good. ""Follow the roots.""

This is a writerly movie. The story and to some extent the script are paramount. The biographical accidents around the time the author wrote the test are relevant. His mother had died. His career seemed empty. And meaning eluded him. Somehow, he managed to pull not only his own life together, but to see clearly through ""all the smoke and the lights"" into the heart of our culture ""the heartland"" of our land. [As a Canadian totally identifying with the values, I take references to ""America"" in the continental rather than the national sense.]

499373,5,6302681685,"Pure Country is a wonderful review of history, not because the film is historical in nature but because it is part of the early Strait years and helped to establish what George Strait country music was and would be.  The acting is visibly acting and the storyline is classic with little attempt at original plotting.  Essentially, the successful artist has lost his grip on where he started, leaves the stage long enough to visit his home, takes the advice and love of the grandmother who reared him, finds himself and a sweetheart, then returns to dismiss the foolish imposter who would like to be in his place, and the ending is happy for everyone with the artist even forgiving his longtime friend for attempting to control and use him; everyone is redeemed to some extint.  When you have had enough blood and guts, this is a sweet story with the added presence of a man who has been a sqeaky clean role model for at least twenty five years in the entertainment world.  It is okay if you don't cry at the end, just count how many times Strait kisses this actress.  This was a refreshing review.

After George Strait got married he told his wife that he'd never kiss another woman.  I say this because in a typical movie with a romantic plot line there is usually lip-locking going on.

499443,5,6302681685,"PURE COUNTRY is not so much a Country story as it is a statement about where Country Music was heading at the time the movie was made.  Remember?  Garth Brooks was climbing the charts faster than a chimp up a banana tree and he was doing it with what?  With un-country-like special effects including bizarre light shows, pyrotechnics and smoke. Many other Country stars followed suit.

To a purest like George Strait the rock-and-roll-ization of Country Music was tantamount to the vilest heresies.  What better way to speak out against it than with a movie that depicts a Country singer who has lost his way and rediscovers his roots and his life?  PURE COUNTRY makes an eloquent statement against the crossover efforts of Brooks and others while telling an enchanting story about the simplicity of the Country life.  The music, as would be expected, is fabulous and the cast performances, including George Strait doing some riding and roping, are terrific too.

As far as the statement is concerned, I agree wholeheartedly with Strait's assessment of things.  Leave the lights and noise and smoke to KISS and other groups and performers who made that type of outlandish performance famous.  For me, as the movie title implies, I prefer PURE COUNTRY.

One night after Dusty stops singing for three bars during a concert he figures out that it's the ""glitz"" and not the ""hits"" that fans are coming to see. This rude awakening causes him to take immediate stock of himself when he begins to feel like a ""dancing chicken"" in a traveling road show. And so he abruptly sets out on a search to find his roots and to recapture the love and passion he once had for performing. One night by way of a drunken stuper in a cowboy bar he meets the georgeous Harley Tucker (in a scene stealing performance by Isabel Glasser) and tries to defend her honor but he can barely stand up. So after losing a fight she takes one look at that killer smile and says.....hmmmm.....I think I'll bring this one home with me tonight. When Dusty's manager Lula Rogers (another scene stealing performance played by Lesley Ann Warren) finaly catches up with Dusty and sees her ""competition"" she sabotages the budding relationship by lying to Harley. When Dusty finds out what Lula did he lays down the law and Lula repents and finds Harley and comes clean with her. Then at his Vegas show Dusty (George that is) procedes to sing to Harley one of the greatest country ballads of all time ""I Cross My Heart"" in a spine tingling performance that will make you want to jump up and watch the movie all over again!

It is so possible to see how a man can get so caught up in the road shows glitz and fans that he ends up blanking out.  So many entertainers ruin their lives because they lose all sense of reality.

The plot is obvious and overused, the songs all sound like each other, and there's one character who never speaks in anything except stupid and overused analogies.

499490,5,6302681685,"With the large amount of smut, ultra-violence and graphic language in movies today, ""Pure Country"" is a breath of fresh air for anyone looking for a movie that is entertaining for young and old alike.  The film, which debuts country superstar George Strait's acting ability, is a quality film with a fun story that takes a look at the world of country music from the singer's point of view.
George Strait plays Dusty Wyatt Chandler, a Garth Brooksesque superstar whose show has outgrown everyone's expectations, especially his own.  While performing at a massive arena to a sold out show, he has an epiphany that the fans are so caught up in his hype, in the pyro-technics and the fireworks and all the flash and dance, that they fail to notice when Dusty stops singing for several seconds.  Downed by the realization that people have forgotten his music, and angry with his manager, Lula Rogers (Lesley Ann Warren), after a disagreement about how his show should be performed, Dusty takes off, hitch-hiking his way back home to his small-town roots, leaving Lula, the band, and indeed, his entire entourage, scrambling to find him before their next show.
When he returns home, he re-discovers why he began on the musical journey that took him into the big time, and at the same time meets and falls for Harley Tucker (Isabel Glasser), a proud but struggling ranch owner whose ranch is in risk of going under.
The story takes the audience on a journey into America's heartland, where front porch philosophy, strong family values, and the need to return to your roots are the more important parts of a ""pure country"" life.  Through the experiences that unfold in his time off, Dusty discovers that there he must be responsible to the people that depend on him, but he must be true to himself and his music as well.
With a ""feel-good"" ending that's sure to please, this movie is chock full of George Strait's music, including the hit ""I Cross My Heart"" which went on to become a number 1 hit for the singer after the movie's debut.
This is a great film for all ages, and a movie parents can feel comfortable watching with the kids.  (NOTE: Minor ""make out"" scene near beginning of the film (nothing inappropriate, but as I am labelling this a ""family"" film, I want parents to be aware for younger audiences)).
In a time when the world seems to be reeling from a lack of values, this is a great film that really is ""Pure Country"", with a down-home feel good story for the whole family.

499491,4,6302681685,"This is the only George Strait film performance I have ever watched, and I am impressed.  Although it was released nine years ago (1994) I only viewed it last night for the first time.

His performance was very good. He acts as well as he sings!

The supporting cast, including Lesley Ann Warren, who played Lula(his manager), Isabel Glasser (as his girl friend, Harley), John Doe (his best buddy, Earl), all turned in sterling performances as did the other cast members.
I was unfamiliar with all of the cast except Lesley Warren, whom I have seen in many movies, and who always does well in my opinion.

Not all singers can act as well as they sing, but this was a good story, well acted, with a positive ending.  It was a pure joy to watch throughout, and the direction by Chris Cain was very good,as was the story line by writer Rex McGee.

499494,1,6302681685,"I saw this ""movie"" at the theater when it was first released and thanks to extensive therapy I had all but finally forgotten about it. I just came upon it as I came to Amazon to buy the new G. Strait concert DVD. I am a big fan of George and I can't wait to see the concert but this movie was one of the few I couldn't make myself stay in the theater and finish. I left my mother and wife and took a nap in the car in the Texas heat rather than subject myself to anymore of this insulting movie.
This may not be a 'white trash' movie but why is it that most of the reviews were of the VHS version? I didn't think anybody still had VCR's left in their trailers.
One scene that nightmarishly comes to mind was in a concert hall or bar and a couple is standing directly in front of the stage and every time they speak to each other the music would conveniently turn down so that they wouldn't have to raise their voices. Now that's realistic!
Maybe I lived in Texass too long to be impressed with the big belt buckle thing but George is too tiny to be carrying a buckle the size of those 19"" TVs you all are watching this horrible movie on.
I can't imagine why he hasn't made anymore movies with such an easy to please audience.
Very predictable. Very unrealistic. Very weak script. Poorly directed.

If you like George Strait and own his records and listen to him alot you will probably find this movie intresting like I did. If you do not know who George is It's really up in the air what you will think about this movie. This is simple nice clean romance story that everyone can watch. The acting although is half way there the writers did not take the story very far. You know what will happen in this movie it is just so predictable.

499496,4,6302681685,"First of all, George Strait is not a polished actor, and does not pretend to be. Yet for years Hollywood types, including Col. Tom Parker, (Elvis's manager) encouraged George to make a film. Talent scouts saw in him a handsomeness, a stage presence, and a likability that fans always knew. But George consistently turned down the offers, preferring to concentrate on his special brand of country music. Finally, a script was fashioned he could relate to. In certain ways, the plot holds to similarities that Strait adheres to. I have been to several of his sold-out concerts. And some of what he chaffes at in ""Pure Country"" is true. He does not like, and does not feel comfortable with the smoke, the lights, the ""volcano blasts"" deemed essential by some of his contemporaries. An intensely private man, his character of Dusty, relentlessly promoted by his ambitious manager Lula Rodgers, (Lesley Ann Warren) mirrors a view of a dissillusioned country superstar refusing to be a manipulated ""dancing chicken"" anymore. His spontaneous side trip off the concert circuit leads him back to his small town roots, where he rediscovers the passion that helped him attain superstar status. Shaving off his beard and pony tail in an attempt to remain anonymous, he meets the beautiful Harley Tucker (Isabel Glasser). Instantly smitten, he hides his stage identity from Harley and makes no attempt to dazzle her with his status as a country music superstar. Indeed, he is just Wyatt and both start to fall deeply in love. Lula, however, will have no part of that, and conspires to undermine the relationship to get Dusty back on the road. Almost all of the songs in this wonderful movie are sung by Strait, and can be found on the Pure Country CD. For an album to be assembled so quickly to meet the requirements of film deadlines, it has gone on to become one of his best selling albums. One of the great mysteries of country music is why the catchy song ""Overnight Male"" was never released as a single and as a consequence never received radio air play. Rare is the concert where his fans do not clamor for him to sing it. Oh well. ""Pure Country"" is pure entertainment. If George Strait never makes another movie, he can be dang proud of this effort. Thanks for the memories George.",1016582400,11,2275,4.762025316455696
499567,4,6302681685,"I bought the video to Pure Country after listening to the soundtrack album. The movie is well-done. George Strait plays Dusty Chandler, a country music superstar who gets tired of the loud sound and overhyped special effects(smoke and strobe lights) in his shows. After an argument with his manager, Lula Rogers(played by Lesley Ann Warren), Dusty says to his best friend, Earl(John Doe), ""I'm just gonna take me a little walk,"" and he does that. He returns to his old hometown, cuts off his beard and ponytail, and tries to get back to his down-home country roots, going first to his Grandma Ivy's house and then to the bar where he once played. After Dusty leaves town, Lula tries to keep his show going at all costs. With some important concert dates coming up, including one in Las Vegas, she hires Buddy(Kyle Chandler), a member of Dusty's road crew, to lip-synch his songs. Most of the band members have doubts, but Lula goes ahead with the plan. The first concert date goes smoothly, and Lula justifies what she does by blaming Dusty for walking out. Lula also hires a private detective and goes off herself to find Dusty.
Meanwhile, Dusty goes to a night club, where he meets the young rancher Harley, the other principal character(played by Isabel Glasser). Harley's boyfriend gets jealous upon seeing her with another guy, and a fight starts. After breaking his rival's nose, Dusty is knocked out in the parking lot and wakes up the next morning. He accepts Harley's offer of breakfast and later finds himself taking roping lessons. Before too long, with the help of Harley and her brothers, he becomes a good roper, and it turns out that his skills are needed. Harley's dad, Ernest(Rory Calhoun), is in danger of losing the ranch, and he is depending on Harley's winning her event at a big rodeo in Las Vegas to stay afloat.
I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but it turns out to be a fairy tale in which things eventually work out well for everyone. Harley wins at the rodeo, saving her ranch. Dusty comes back, patches things up with everybody(except Buddy, whom he gets rid of after learning how much publicity Buddy's lip-synching act has gotten) and puts on a great show in Vegas--minus the ponytail, beard and fancy costume. Lula at long last gives Dusty an emotional apology. And despite Lula's efforts to break up his romance, Dusty gets his girl(Harley) in the end.
Though George is the movie's star, Lesley Ann Warren, in my opinion, steals the show as the crafty Lula. Lula professes to be concerned about Dusty and his band members, but everything she does(using Buddy as a stand-in, hiring a private detective, and following Dusty) shows me that she's really in it for the money. It is only after watching Buddy's TV interview and seeing Harley, who turns out to be Dusty's true love, that Lula breaks down. We're not told much about Dusty and Lula's non-business relationship, although those who saw the movie(including myself) will see, from the barroom photo Dusty looks at, that she played in his band before he got popular and that she was his old girlfriend. John Doe's character, Earl, also plays an important role, though it's a minor one. He reminisces with Dusty about the old days(when they went to the carnival and watched the ""dancing chicken""). He defends Dusty against Lula's accusations that he(Dusty) walked out, and, being the loyal friend that he is, he walks out himself and follows Dusty to Harley's ranch.
Director Chris Cain and writer Rex McGee did a very good job on this film. Their failure to develop Dusty and Lula's relationship further is the only flaw in an otherwise fine movie. The acting, though there aren't many well-known actors, is first-rate, and George sings a lot of great tunes, including the hit ""I Cross My Heart"", on an awesome soundtrack. I think, too, that George, who had never acted before except in TV commercials, does a very convincing job as Dusty. I became a George Strait fan after watching this movie. I think that even those who aren't music fans will like it. It's a great portrayal of country music, and it also is a good slice-of-life movie.",1015545600,66,4138,4.740638002773925

499569,5,6302681685,"Admittedly  there have been white trash movies, but this definitely is NOT one of those!  This is a remake of  ""A Star is Born"" but the treatment of the subject is timeless, as well as timely.
 Many music stars have tried to broaden their careers and incomes, and venture into movies. Some have been bad actors, and succeeded anyway(in the case of Elvis), and some have done well and their work has stood on it's own merit. Randy Travis(I'm not a fan) is one, and now-so has George Strait.
 The movie was very satisfying, and very believable. The story revolves around a country music star who collides with his manager-a long time friend. Perhaps an old girlfriend-as the movie implies. Along the way he  finds his true love late in life.
I like this character, because he doesn't use bad language, isn't abusive, and doesn't lust after every female in sight. He has principles, but he also has A couple of warts that cause temporary setbacks in his life.
There are charactors with stronger libidus, but they orbit around the main charactor, thankfully.
 As would be expected, there is a strong music track, but the music is not intrusive. The music is well timed with the scenes, and helps the viewer to follow the plot-as it should.
 The ending is a happy one-and we aren't usually surprised. I'm sure the critics found the plot ""predictable"". I have decided after viewing this movie, that it works because of the fabulous job of casting that was done and the fantastic job that all the actors did to bring their characters to life.
 To viewers who fear they would be subjected to yet another music star ""trying movies"" think again. Strait is not only real-he's a damn good singer and a hell of an actor.  I could find no major flaw in this movie. It was stellar entertainment.
 I don't consider myself a movie fan, but this movie joined my collection not long after it's release on VHS, before we ever had DVD. Not  only that, but I plan to add this picture to my DVD Collection, when I finally get a player to view it on.

I believe George Strait is very talented, and he really projected a presence in this film.  However, the storyline just didn't cut it for me... it's ridiculous how this woman meets Dusty (played by George Strait), and doesn't know he's this famous country singer... especially since she goes out to country and western clubs.  Hmmm... just a little too far-fetched... surely she would have seen a poster of him somewhere in one of those clubs... and how could a country performer just hang out at a country and western club and not be noticed by the others.  But that's just one hole in this poorly-written film.  George Strait looks great in this film, the music is wonderful... but the story... well, it's a good story, put together badly.

As Dusty becomes more popular as a country music singer, his manager (Lesley Ann Warren) stages all his tours with smoke, strobe lights, and really loud music to where no one can even see or hear the ""real"" country artist.
