5087208,5,B007HS8WI0,"Conrad Veidt was an excellent film actor who learned his craft in his native Germany. He is probably best known for his role in THE THIEF BAGDAD.However great this was, he truly shines in POWER (1934). Banned almost everywhere in Europe it was warmly re ceived in Vienna. This film is not anti-semetic but a serious condemnation of what was happening in Germany with the rise of  Hitler and the Nazis Party. The British refused to show the film as to not offend Geremany. It was redone in 1940 with a total anti-Jewish flavor. But take a chance: look at Veidt's work in the 1934 version. You will not be disappointed! Note: he also appeared with Bogart in the great CASABLANCA!",1357344000,13,677,4.595041322314049
5087209,5,B007HS8WI0,"If you only know the aggressively anti-Semitic JUD SUSS that Veit Harlan fashioned as propagnada for Joseph Goebbels, you owe it to yourself to see this far more layered British version of the novel made (astonishingly) in 1934. Conrad Veidt gives a bravura performance in a film that veers occasionally toward melodrama, but which remains grounded by the reality of truly disturbing period details. Also, if you only know Conrad Veidt from either THE CABINET OF CALIGARI or CASABLANCA, you'll appreciate even more what a great loss his early death was. He was every inch an actor's actor, not unlike Charles Laughton and Paul Muni. [And - as a true bonus for a theatre buff - you'll also get to see one of the few film performances by James Barrie's original ""Captain Hook"" (Gerald du Maurier).]",1350518400,10,796,4.860294117647059

8516866,5,B007HS8WI0,An incredibly moving performance by Conrad Veidt! His presence and ability are unmatched as he brings this story of struggle for religious equality and freedom to striking life! One of his greatest performances and one not to be missed by any fan! Truly an overlooked jewel! A well-written and beautifully shot film with grand sets and wonderful performances throughout! :),1432684800,3,373,5.233333333333333

8516868,5,B007HS8WI0,"~It's a wonder in today's economic-tyranny that such a splendid specimen of Nazi-era b&w-cinematography is being allowed public viewing,  -as it very concisely depicts how the Talmudicly brainwashed Hebrews have gone about subversively infiltrating every Anglo/Aryan nation with their greed-driven schemes to divide & concur naive non-Hebrews.  This should not be confused as anti-Semitic, -which inane term is actually a flagellant misnomer (-as 80% of Jews are non-Semitics!) concocted by the Beni'Berith Zionist-agents when the Rothschilds cunningly hyjacked our usTreasury in 1913, and swiftly installed their subversive so-called FederalReserve-sys. & IRS-henchmen, as well as their notorious ADL.  Sadly, the resulting globalist America of today is a pathetic warmongering remnant of our founders great quest to liberate us from the ever conniving Rothschild-bank'sters;  --much as Chancellor-Hitler strove to liberate the noble, albeit now 'Jew-occupied' nation of Germany, from the perverse subversion of Hebrew bank'sterism, in the form of both revealed anti-social Communism and Capitalism.
The film begins with coronation of Karl'Alexander, Duke of Wrttemberg, a selfish man whom has fooled the people, -and deceptively swears an oath to obey the laws of the dukedom- ""according to traditional Wrttemberg loyalty & honesty"".  The Duke soon becomes frustrated because Wrttemberg's provincial Council righteously refuses him the funds needed to maintain a lavish lifestyle comparable to his neighboring sovereigns;  --in particular, he wants a personal-bodyguard, and opera/ballet groups.  Yet lacking funds even to purchase coronation-gifts for the Duchess,  the self-engrossed Duke foolishly sends a courtier to Frankfurt to borrow money from a devious Jew named- Joseph S Oppenheimer (-agent of the ruthless Rothschilds).  The sly Jew Su$$ soon opportunistically suckers the gullible Duke so deep in debt that this Trustee of the Public-faith is induced by the Jew to impose nasty Jew-taxes, which disrupt the natural process of free-enterprise economics, -which had enabled the happily well-managed township to prosper without the adverse oppression of Property-taxes!
Unfortunately, had this film been allowed to screen in 1940-America,  --its revelations echoed by highly regarded HenryFord and Chas. A.Lindbergh would have doubtlessly prevented the tragedy of Jew-promoted WW2, -which was essentially genocide upon Aryans.
Today, most astute individuals are aware that the Hebrews powerful propaganda-machine (-which includes print-publishing, and FCC-controlled Radio/TV-stations as well as our usPublic-Libraries!), -had zealously brainwashed the public into believing the Jews outlandishly hateful anti-German 12-zillion Jew-deaths by transformation into lampshades & soap, --as a cover-up for the Jew-orchestrated slaughter of freedom-loving anti-Communist Germans during WW's-1&2..!
In summation, it is good that this historic educational-film is reemerging, whereby great free-enterprise organizations, such as Amazon-com and YouTube.com, and usConstitution supported free-speech, --enable ethical public-discussion to prevail despite constant efforts by so-called 'progressive liberals' (aka:  democrats/communist) to deny us our right to express our opinion in the manner we are doing here.  ThankYou for your thoughtful consideration of my historic viewpoint, -for as the plot of this film reveals, people must retaliate against the self-anointed robber-Barron Jew-kings extorting our earnings, in their warmongering primitive-minded psychotic ancient quest to rule the world through economic-tyranny...!
Sincerely,  ~Robair of So. Calif.",1414281600,2,3663,6.287425149700598
