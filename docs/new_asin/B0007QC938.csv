2230963,5,B0007QC938,"I was very pleased with this video because it is especially good for people who are recuperating, or someone who is just getting started with exercise, or for the elderly (but could help anyone), or to target work on a particular body part. Even though the stretches, movements, and exercises appear to be extremely simple, they are effective and perfect for someone who has been stagnant for whatever reason. The best part of this video is that each body section has an A group of exercises, and a little more advanced B group. There are also many exercises/stretches in each section, but each one is done only 4 or 8 or 12 times so the routine doesn't get boring. It moves quickly, but is simple to follow, so it's easy to keep up.  I bought this to help with my recovery from foot surgery (I'm 50). I'm not yet strong enough for Yoga, and purchased this to get my strengthening started (because the doctor would prescribe only four weeks of physical therapy). I have also found the section for my back to be effective. I love the variety of exercises and the pace of this video because I get bored easily with most exercises videos. I also order one for my mother (she's 82) and she has found it helpful also.",1253577600,5,1212,4.484162895927602
2230964,4,B0007QC938,"This was recommended to me by a marathon runner. I have bad knees and arthritis in my hands. The workouts are helping both. There are beginner and advanced workouts for lots of body parts and I've done some of them. I don't like the music or the background bunnies who don't always show good form. He starts talking and teaching before the video switches from the segment title to the actual video, so you can feel a bit scrambly getting into position. I don't much like his voice. But the exercises and stretches are in line with my physical therapy. All in all, I'm glad I bought it and use it.",1238630400,12,596,4.378378378378378
2230965,5,B0007QC938,"This DVD by instructor JB Burns is also known as JB Burns' Freedom Restoration Series.  It contains a series of rehabilitative workouts addressing seven different areas of the body.  For each area, there is a ""Series A,"" which is more beginning-level and a bit less intense, and ""Series B,"" which includes more intermediate exercises and more active stretches, for at total of 14 workouts on the DVD.  Most of the workouts are about 15 minutes long, although some are as short as 11 minutes, and a few are as long as 23 minutes.  All of the workouts feature Burns with two female background exercises (the women are different in each segment), and the only props that are needed are a chair and a mat for the floorwork.  I have broken down each body area in greater detail below.

BACK
The back segments were the longest at about 23 minutes each.  The A Series focuses mainly on lower back and core stretches; it includes some beginning crunches, prone moves, work on all fours, and a few kneeling and standing stretches to finish.  B Series takes it up a notch with intermediate pelvic tilts, crunches and bridge work.  It also contains more exercises for the hamstrings and more intense low back stretches, including some tough work in the prone position.

SHOULDER
Both series consist of about 12 exercises.  In Series A, the stretches are more basic, moving the shoulders through all planes of motion.  There is also some isometric work.  Series B is more active, with many of the exercises being the same as moves that you would typically do with weights.

HIP & KNEE
Series A focuses includes exercises to mobilize the kneecaps and strengthen the quads.  It includes various hip stretches, including isometric and hip flexor stretches, and the series is performed almost entire on the floor.  In contrast, Series B features stronger stretches for the hips and hamstrings, and it consists mostly of standing work.

ANKLE & FOOT
This is the only section where Burns and the women do not wear shoes; each segment is about 13 minutes long.  Series A starts out with manipulative work for the toes and ankles.  Continuing in a seated position, there are various stretches for the toes, ankles, and feet.  Series B offers similar stretches, but from a lying position; this segment ends with additional standing moves.

HAND & ELBOW
Both A and B contain 12 exercises and are about 12 minutes long.  The A Series begins with a finger massage and continues into many different types of wrist stretches, including some isometric movements.  In Series B, there are more active finger stretches and then a different sequence of wrist stretches.

ABDOMINAL
These series are short at about 11 minutes each.  Both A and B follow a similar pattern:  the series begins in a standing position for a brief stretch, then moves to the floor for a series of abdominal crunches and bridge work.  Series A includes isometric moves, whereas Series B includes more intermediate/advanced crunches.  Both series end with a brief stretch.

FLEXIBILITY
Both of the series in the Flexibility portion offer a sequence of stretches for the entire body, and thus these segments would work well for stretching after a workout.  The two segments are actually quite similar, covering areas such as wrists, low back, mid/upper back, chest, groin, hips, hamstrings, and ankles; perhaps the only differences are that Series A includes neck stretches, and Series B goes into the stretches a bit more deeply.

As the DVD case notes, these workouts are designed to rehab the body, and so they would be excellent for anyone suffering from a sports-specific injury--for example, the shoulder rehab for golfers.  However, the entire DVD is ideal for anyone who would like to improve posture and increase flexibility.  I know that I will appreciate having this DVD on hand both for when I feel the need to get some extra stretching in or especially whenever I might be experiencing any specific aches and pains that need to be addressed.  The only thing that I did not like about this DVD was the music; the case describes it as having ""great music and high energy,"" but I found the fast-paced music jarring for a workout billed as gentle and rehabilitative in nature.  Otherwise, however, this is definitely a valuable addition to a home exercise video library, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",1225324800,64,4362,4.8724559023066485

2230967,5,B0007QC938,"This is an excellent dvd.  I wake up with back, and/or shoulder pain, almost daily.  I always feel better after doing the back and shoulder exercises.  The movements are gentle, and effective.  No special equipment is required for the segments  I've tried (shoulders and back) - a big plus! - I just need me, the floor, and (sometimes) a straight-back chair.  I don't think that any special equipment is required for any of the workouts on this dvd.  JB Berns does a great job at being the instructor/motivator.  He gives understandable exercise directions and explanations, mingled with encouragement and brief anecdotes about the exercises.

I am very glad I purchased this dvd, and I recommend it.",1157500800,35,700,4.9655172413793105
2230968,5,B0007QC938,"I saw on the page that 82% of customers buy Shiva Rea's yoga DVD and I felt like I need to clear one thing on behalf of this DVD. While I love Ms. Rea's tapes this DVD actually does what it claims - rehabilitation. I work in the computer industry and my problem started with elbow, upper back and neck and now it's reached down to my lower back and knees as well. When I got this DVD I was disappointed just because I was expecting more Zen like music and Yogi-like teacher. The instructor looks is a guy who looks like more of aerobics/strength traning type. But as soon as I try the hand/elbow exercise, this DVD became my favorite. First of all hand/finger/elbow exercises are largely ignored in most of fitness DVD/VHS. But if you suffer from tennis elbow, tight fingers or any computer-related symptoms you'd know how those areas affect your whole body. And the exercises are effective. I sometimes bring the DVD to the office and do the hand exercise in lunchtime. So far I've only talked about Hand/Elbow, but I also love Ankle/Foot Restoration part. It feels great after a long day. Overall this DVD is very effective and well worth the price.

Here are the Main Menu - each restoration has 2 workouts. DVD is about 7 hours.

Back

Shoulder

Knee & Hip

Ankle & Foot

Hand & ELbow

Abodminal

Flexibility

2230969,5,B0007QC938,"I love this video. It's perfect for anyone that isn't very mobile. I would consider myself sendentary - I do walk and go up and down stairs, but I have a bad back and bad knee so I haven't been very active lately. This video is definitely helping me to feel more flexible again, and I can tell I'm building core strength to help my back.",1331078400,2,337,4.121212121212121
2230970,4,B0007QC938,"This is the second DVD I bought from Urban Rebounder and both were bad DVDs. By that I mean the physical DVD was bad, not the content. That's why I'm giving this DVD four rather than five stars. Otherwise, it would be five star.

These workouts are unique. They're not the typical rehab exercises. And, they really make you feel better and ease any pain you're having. (That's assuming the type of pain you have will respond to exercise and is not more serious.) There are two workouts for each body area. One is a light version and the other one somewhat more advanced. There are seven areas of the body addressed by the workouts.

I would have liked to see one for the neck but it isn't offered.

The exercises are excellent. They are sort of a combination of some yoga and isometrics. They're all easy and anyone should be able to do them. The workouts are fairly short and yet long enough to do good.

J.B. Berns knows his stuff and he's an excellent instructor. I love his isometric DVD and this one is every bit as good. The menu is a bit cheesy and not well done and each section runs into the next one. The Urban Rebounder company doesn't yet have a handle on making a quality DVD product and that's too bad when they offer such great content.

Highly recommended.

2230971,1,B0007QC938,"Twice we ordered the DVD ""Rehab Your Body at Home"".  Twice we were sent the correct box and correct label, but the DVD itself was ""Extreme Metabolic Exercise"".  Not exactly what the doctor ordered for a 69 year old woman.  We were very disappointed in the quality control, or lack there of, which was exhibited.",1320537600,6,311,4.618181818181818
2230972,1,B0007QC938,"I'm planning knee surgery and planned to do some rehab both before and after.  Despite the packaging and DVD label, the DVD contents were  URX-MT: Urban Rebounding Extreme Metabolic Training.  It looks to me like they had a production run problem and mixed up the DVD and labeled them wrong.  Because I had opened the shrink wrap I called the manufacturer directly and reported the problem.  They promptly sent a replacement to me, but that one also had the same problem. The package said 'Rehab Your Body', but the contents were again URX-MT.  I called them back and reported that the replacement had the same problem.  I request that they open the package and check the contents by viewing the DVD before sending me another.  It's for me and not a gift, so I don't care if the shrink wrap is gone.  I have yet to hear back from them since that complaint. URX-MT is extremely intense workout on a mini tramp, not at all useful to me or anyone in need of rehab for a knee replacement.  There was a section showing clips from their other products, one of them being 'Rehab Your Body at Home'.  That little clip looks like what I was looking for.

This is a clear case of a manufacturing mistake.  They duplicated URX-MT and labeled it 'Rehab Your Body at Home'.  I hope they will eventually send me what I ordered, but I fear it will arrive too late to be of much use to me.

Steer clear of ordering this until they can send you what you want.

Update:  The manufacturer did follow-up and send me the correct DVD.  The content looks good and what I was hoping to use.  They should have the problem corrected for new orders.  If you get a package with the wrong content, I suggest you contact the company directly using the email address on the DVD case and request a replacement.",1319932800,20,1778,4.429012345679013
2230973,1,B0007QC938,"This Rehab Your Body at Home was recommended by our family doctor to help rehab my husband's back (herniated disk) and my knees. The description on the case says the workout is gentle, slow motion, static contraction techniques, non-jarring, no weights, no machines, other things that one thinks of when rehabbing.

45 minutes into the video, they have not once warmed up and do nothing but intense cardiac workout on mini trampolines (USING WEIGHTS) to nothing but rhythmic brain-seizure inducing music.

I have been gypped and am very angry that it was sold as a rehab type video when it isn't. Isn't that false advertising?????

For an incredibly low price, this DVD replaces those sessions, allowing me the freedom to schedule the time to do them. I can play the DVD on my computer, laptop, or DVD, whichever is most convenient at the time. I like the fact that it covers so many areas where I have pain: shoulders/neck, lower back, knees, hips, my tennis elbow, and flexibility, plus more. I start with the A exercises hoping to one day advance to the B exercises.
The exercises are ""free exercise"" meaning no equipment needed, perfect for exercising while traveling. Plus, if I have to gather equipment to exercise it is just one more excuse to not exercise.

My Story:
I was suffering from tennis elbow on both arms from pulling a fireman's high rise pack up a to a fourth story window.  It affected my arm and hand strength.  I couldn't hold a gallon of milk with one hand, let alone pour from it.  I had many other limitations because of this injury.  I am an athlete and work out all of the time and this injury put a damper on most of the activities I love, even my precious long mountain bike rides.

I have lived with this issue for a year and was ready to go to a Physical Therapist which I was dreading because of the precious time it would take but I was getting desperate to get out of pain and regain mobility and then...

...I bought this DVD after reading a positive review and I am so glad I did and want to thank that other reviewer as well.  JB Berns clearly knows his anatomy, physiology and his injury rehab as well.  This guy is no dumb jock trying to get rich off of his programs.  He seems to really be passionate about helping people and sharing his knowledge.

I started out by getting his Urban Rebounding Mini-Trampline system for some at home aerobic activity and to break up the winter work out doldrums and stumbled upon this ""Rehab Your Body at Home"" DVD.  I'm so glad I did.  By the way the Urban Rebounding mini trampoline DVD's are fun.  Jumping on the mini-tramp is so much fun.  I feel like a kid again.  Bouncing is a fun way to burn calories and the DVD's keep it interesting.  I wish there were more mini-trampoline workouts by JB Berns or anyone for that matter.

I have never written a review before for any item I have purchased through Amazon or any seller.  I am almost glad that I got this injury and found this awesome at home solution just so I can now encourage any one out there who has similar injuries to get this DVD and use it.

Next, I am going to work on the knee rehab for a really old running related injury.

8050413,2,B0007QC938,"I've previously been an avid yogi, and hot power yoga was my favorite go-to for a long time ...however, after a few stressful years, I have fallen out of the practice, and have been suffering form a lot of hip pain and stiffness from sitting long hours at a desk job, and an old knee injury is acting up.. Even doing gentle yoga brings me pain, my hips are so incredibly locked up, so I thought I'd get back to basics and do some rehabilitation. After reading the reviews here on Amazon, I settled on this one.

First of all, I have to say this DVD came today and I've only done the hip and knee series so far. However, I'm HIGHLY disappointed....the music is incredibly annoying and the instructor is even worse - he repeats everything twice, and the 1980's style titles between each exercise is too much. I find the timing of the stretching WAY too fast - there is no warm-up whatsoever so you're supposed to stretch cold muscles for about 20 seconds - but my body is aching for a MUCH longer hold and MUCH deeper breathing with it. I'm wondering if maybe this is just a different method of exercise that I'm not used to, but it doesn't seem like its going to be effective.

I desperately want to feel better though, and be able to get back to the power yoga, so I will try to get past my annoyance with this guy and continue with this for a few weeks to see if the exercises actually help...all these other positive reviews must be based on something real, I hope.

8050415,3,B0007QC938,"I'm giving this 3 stars only because I've only done the hand & elbow rehab on this Dvd so far. As for this claiming 7 hours of total rehab on this is entirely false! I don't understand how no one else has pointed this out yet (glancing through reviews). This is about 3 hours 28 min total with all the workouts (including series A and B). Once you've selected a workout it plays A and B series together. But you also have the option from the menu to start series B on each section which will start you half way through the A&B video for each section. Really disappointed with how short the exercises for the hand and elbow is. It's 24 min total (A & B combined). I got this video to rehab my elbow and  foot. Even doing the hand and elbow section, there are only a few that I even felt in my elbow. The rest were all hand exercises. I was under the assumption there was an hour total for each section which is just not the case. I will give this a go and definitely use it. But just irritated with the false advertisement of ""7 hours"".

As for the customers out there that are interested in this video, here are the REAL time lengths for each section (this includes A&B series together):
Back Rehab- 46 min 35 sec
Shoulder rehab- 26 min 2 sec
Hip & Knee rehab- 31 min 14 sec
Ankle & Foot rehab- 26 min 50 sec
Hand & Elbow rehab- 24 min 28 sec
Abdominal rehab- 23 min 27 sec
Flexibility rehab- 30 min 8 sec

= 3 hours 28 min (about)

I have gone through each section thouroughly to make sure I'm not missing some magical section that has this 7 hours of video. But they are just falsely stating its 7 hours by adding the ""series A"" and series B times together on the menu. But the series A videos include series B, so its just adding the same videos together to get a total of 7 hours. Hope this helps prevent disappointment to anyone else ordering this :)

I've included a pic of the menu and a pic of selecting ""Series B"" for the back rehab which you can see starts you half way through the video, since the first half is series A. 3rd photo is selecting ""Series B"" for hand & elbow which again you can see it starts you half way through the video since the first half is series A.",1470528000,7,2182,4.100702576112412

I've got a knee injury so I did the Knee and Hip parts A&B only.

Basically he doesn't explains at all how to do the movement right. Since I do Yoga, I've heard multiple times from my teacher and DVDs & Yoda books that I read, that certain variations are very harmful and should be avoided. Here the trainer mentions none of them. E.g. if you place the palm of your other foot on our knee it is harmful, it should be either on the thigh or the calf, not the knee. (Even one of girls was doing her squads (squat?! as he calls it) wrong. Her knees were coming further than her toes, these are the basics!)

8050421,5,B0007QC938,"Seriously, no home should be without this DVD, it's worth 10 times the cost if you've ever had an injury or any type of ache or pain that just wouldn't go away. I bought this on a whim one day when it showed up in my selections. My husband had been limping around for a month every morning after pulling something on the treadmill. I had just finished physical therapy on my upper back and was already suffering from stiffness again. I have a long-standing tight hip problem, and Raynaud's issues in my hands and feet.

The DVD has 7 hours of material. I've tried only a fraction of it, but am so impressed with what I've used! First - I started with the shoulder exercises to loosen up my tight shoulders. They work. I try to do them several times a week as I don't always have the greatest posture sitting at a desk all day. Pain is gone. My husband uses the foot and ankle exercises each morning, and is no longer waking up with tight muscles (achilles tendon issue? not sure, he's too stubborn to go to the doctor.) I've had on and off soreness in my hip for 10 years. Anti-inflammatory medication helps, but I no longer like to rely on medication. This is one of the aggravating type of things that never seems to be bothering me when I'm at the doctor's office, so I don't remember to ask. I did the hip and knee exercises. No relief, which was surprising, but I also never got relief from stretching my hip flexors or psoas. So, I moved on to the lower back exercises. Whoa! Relief! Who knew. Whenever I get a twinge in my hip now, I run through the lower back exercises, and I feel better.

The final reason I find this DVD so valuable is because of my Raynaud's Syndrome. The hand and foot exercises really get the blood flowing to my extremities. After having two bad infections in my toes in the past two years, because of a lack of circulation, I find I need to do something more to improve the amount of circulation to my extremities. Daily aerobic exercise doesn't seem to be cutting it, but these specific exercises do work. My hands will be cool and almost numb when I start, and will be warm and flexible when I'm done.

I haven't had to use the rest of the exercises on the DVD, but I'm sure I'll need them at some point, and they'll be just as useful. There is a general flexibility section that I'll be trying soon. I'll update my review as soon as I've gone through it.",1340409600,10,2390,4.29490022172949
