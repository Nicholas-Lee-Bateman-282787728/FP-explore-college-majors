1221177,5,B00000ICUW,Tucci and Platt at their best.  Silly wonderful slapstick.,1433203200,,58,5.444444444444445
1221178,5,B00000ICUW,"Very funny, farcical period homage to the old-time comedy duos and screwball comedies of the 30's & 40's!  The cast is amazing-- a lot of very funny & talented actors including Oliver Platt & Stanley Tucci, who have great comic chemistry together as the co-leads (I only wish they had done more sequels with these characters, in the old tradition of comedy teams like Abbott & Costello who always played essentially the same two misfits in many different farcical situations that were over their heads); also the very funny Scotsman Billy Connolly, as well as Alfred Molina as a pompous, bombastic theater hack who is in the best tradition of the kind of blowhard, buffoonish comedy foils who always seemed to the bane of said old-time comedy characters such as the Marx Brothers and Laurel & Hardy!  Steve Buscemi is also in it, playing against type as a comically over-the-top depressed big-band crooner who finds love with an equally depressed mousy young socialite.  Mind you, their are one or two scenes in which the language & the sexual innuendo can be a tad more ""salty"" than it used to be in the old-time farces that it resembles, but not overly so to the point that it takes away from the overall silly fun of this enjoyable & smartly-written farce!  Highly recommended!",1431216000,2,1280,4.778280542986425
1221179,2,B00000ICUW,Thought Oliver Platt and Stanley Tucci couldn't miss. However not a fan of this era.,1429747200,,84,4.666666666666667
1221180,5,B00000ICUW,Great movie,1420675200,,11,5.0
1221181,5,B00000ICUW,"I saw this movie in the theaters back in the 1990s and was looking for it for a long time. Unfortunately in almost 16 years I have never seen this movie on TV, even though it has tons of famous actors and is a very funny movie.",1417996800,,227,3.851063829787234
1221182,3,B00000ICUW,"Cute, but both actors have been in better and more substantial movies. I like both of these actors a lot, and it feels a bit small for them.",1415836800,,140,4.035714285714286
1221183,4,B00000ICUW,"The spirit of Andy Rooney and Judy Garland hovers over this meeting of terrific actors in a hectic storyline. When an early scene features an uncredited Woody Allen, you do begin to wonder if the point of it all was for congenial actors to have some fun together between more calculating career moves.

Stanley Tucci directed and co-stars with Oliver Platt as two out-of-work, out-of luck actors who enrage Shakesperean star Alfred Molina. They hide out in a large packing box on the docks, which is loaded aboard a cruise liner while they sleep -- the very liner where the offended actor will try to kill them. But he's not the only one; Tony Shaloub plays a strangely serene first mate resolved on blowing up the ship.

Music, vaudeville, and slapstick routines from the 1920's receive almost continuous tribute. When everyone is gorgeously dressed for a supper-club evening, expect the worst. Suicidal crooner ""Happy Frank'"" Steve Buchemi will have his breakdown. Billy Connelly will...well,it's as if someone said, ""Come be in my movie! We'll figure something out for you!""

I have neglected to mention plot linchpin Lili Taylor and Isabella Rossellini, but they won't  mind -- they're having much too good a time. The credits, which are numerous (did everyone work for scale?) roll over a spectacular dance scene on the promenade which only seems to build. Kids will like the slapstick -- it is their heritage -- and all viewers will go to bed happy. And pleasant dreams will be had by all.",1413072000,3,1495,4.874015748031496
1221184,5,B00000ICUW,Very dry humor. Loved the movie so I bought it!,1412812800,,47,3.8
1221185,5,B00000ICUW,"This is a very funny film with an all star cast. Stanley Tucci is a favorite of mine, so I admit, I'm biased.

I bought this because I remembered it from when it was first introduced. And decided to buy it because I'm a real film buff and collector. There are not very many really original films these days with this kind of cleverness. Parts of it are really hilarious and guaranteed you'll feel great after watching it!",1412380800,,421,4.397435897435898

1221207,5,B00000ICUW,"One of the best little-known farces EVER. I am a huge fan of Stanley Tucci and his crew (all of whom are in this movie). Oliver Platt is genius as always. This movie is so fun and entertaining, I can't believe it didn't get more acclaim. If you like comedy in the style of crazy, hilarity ensues, door-slamming, mistaken identity comedy of errors you should probably own this on DVD.",1407974400,,383,4.485714285714286
1221208,5,B00000ICUW,"This movie may not be for everyone, as a few misguided reviews have shown, but it is hilariously funny, made even more so because even in the most outlandish parts it is underplayed. The entire cast simply lets the humor arise out of the characters and situations, and refrains from trying to be funny while they are doing it. Tucci and Platt have a marvelous comic chemistry together. Many of the funniest moments come about because they and their rich supporting cast know how to pause and let the humor gently draw the laughter from the audience. There is plenty of slapstick, such as the results of Platt's claustrophobia, but the actors always let it come out of the characters pursuing their objectives, unaware of how funny what they are doing is.
If you are one who likes this movie, you will probably find yourself rewatching it on a regular basis. It always raises my spirits.",1400544000,,886,4.685897435897436
1221209,4,B00000ICUW,We had loaned this movie out to many people; and then we lost it. This order was to replace the one we lost. It is a great comedy to watch over and over again.,1397347200,,159,3.7058823529411766
1221210,1,B00000ICUW,"If there was a no star star  I would have chose that as it was I had to choose I hate it.  How could two funny guys like Platt and Tucci
come up with this stupid senseless excuse for a movie.  They should have called it Impossible instead of Imposters.",1394928000,,252,4.0
1221211,4,B00000ICUW,"Tucci and Platt are great together and some of the scenes are very funny.  It won't go down in history as a movie great, but it has enough stuff to put a smile on one's face.",1392940800,,174,3.8333333333333335
1221212,5,B00000ICUW,I recommend this gentle but lighthearted spoof. It is the kind of movie that makes you just keep laughing and leaves you feeling good.,1389052800,,134,4.625
1221213,5,B00000ICUW,"Oliver Platt and Stanley Tucci play two con artists who fall asleep in a storage container while fleeing the police only to wake up to find themselves on an ocean liner about to set sail for Europe. What follows is a series of misadventures as these accidental stowaways attempt to blend into the passengers and crew of the ship while trying to avoid an acclaimed stage actor whom they insulted the night before the voyage began and who is on the same ship. Somehow they are taken under the wings of Lily (played by Lili Taylor), who is in charge of the ship's crew, and who tries to protect them from detection. Through a series of misadventures they meet several strange characters, including a recently-widowed woman, who is out to find a wealthy single man , a couple who are on the voyage in order to fleece an Arabian prince, a gay tennis star, and a suicidal singer named Happy Franks (played by Steve Buscemi). As well, they uncover a plot by the first mate to blow up the ship.

All in all, the film is fast-moving and does a great job of holding the viewer's attention with its slapstick comedy and its great acting.",1386979200,,1126,4.492682926829269
1221214,5,B00000ICUW,I love this movie. My son and I watched this and laughed so hard.  I bought him his own copy when he went off to the military. it was a great night.,1385856000,,148,3.625
1221215,5,B00000ICUW,"Keith Simanton, the Amazon critic who reviewed this movie, does a poor job on this one. The movie is hilarious. It does indeed call back to the screwball comedies of the 30s and 40s, and it does it well. The script is excellent and the chemistry among the players is unusually high. Note that Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 62% from critics, and 75% from viewers.",1385769600,,358,4.4393939393939394
1221216,5,B00000ICUW,"Large ensemble cast makes this a treat to watch over and over again.  Hilarious characters; a silly, but smart comedy!",1355184000,,118,4.9
1221227,5,B00000ICUW,"This film is fantastically funny, and brilliantly acted, filmed and written. It is HARD TO FIND on DVD, yet here it was. Got the dvd quickly, in perfect condition.",1344038400,,163,4.655172413793103
1221228,5,B00000ICUW,"Not to denigrate Keith Simanton and Ken Marks--Lord knows I've written some clueless reviews in my time--but these guys simply don't get what The Imposters is all about. This is old-school comedy, pure and simple--a string of set pieces given to some very funny people in a plot so flimsy it's pointless. The Imposters is both an homage to classic film comedy and a pastiche of Hollywood musicals; it knows you know it's a big put-on, but it does it anyway, like a guy disguised as a woman who knows he won't fool anybody but has to wear the dress anyway (which, of course, actually happens in the movie).
Did you ever go see a stage show just because a friend of yours was in it, or several friends, and what made it funny was because you knew they were having fun up there? Everyone in this film is having such a great time doing it, the best way to enjoy it is to stop thinking so much and just go along for the ride. Alfred Molina gets to play the biggest, most self-impressed ham actor you've ever seen. Hope Davis is a sad little mouse who suddenly blossoms into a romantic heroine just because she's found her soul mate in the suicidally depressed singer Happy Franks, a part Steve Buscemi was born to play. Billy Connolly is wickedly hilarious as a Scottish athlete and man's man who thinks Oliver Platt would make an ideal wrestling partner, preferably naked. And these are just a few of the conversations in this tipsy cocktail party of a movie.
The Imposters is not trying to impress anybody, least of all film critics; The Imposters is putting on a big show, knowing it's all fake, knowing the real world is still just as depressing as always, but for a little while forgetting all that and visiting a magical place where people get what they deserve and happiness is just a chance meeting away. Make of that what you will. I love this film. It sticks with me, and just remembering it can make me laugh.",1343779200,7,1915,4.4586894586894585
1221229,5,B00000ICUW,"How can you not like this movie? It's very funny, light-hearted, and it seems all concerned had a ball. It really did remind me of the screwball comedies like ""Bringing up Baby."" Stanley Tucci is one of the most watchable actors in the world, and Alfred Molina as the drunken, blowhard thespian is just hysterical. I bet you'll like it!",1317254400,,336,4.616666666666666
1221230,4,B00000ICUW,"The Imposters is  a hoot!  All those marvelous actors  creating this  grand  caricature of  early movies  make for real comic pleasure.  I'm  a big
Stanley  Tucci  fan and he really  outdid himself on this  film.",1317254400,,212,4.714285714285714
1221231,5,B00000ICUW,"This is one of our favorite movies that we've rented for years and finally bought the DVD.

Over the top performances by everyone, great music, more fun than a ferret down your trousers!",1281398400,,186,4.636363636363637
1221232,4,B00000ICUW,"I was a little reluctant to rent this movie, because I heard as lot of mixed reviews. I finally saw it and now I love it. I didn't really like the beginning. Nothing wrong with it, it was just a little slow to me maybe. Once the story started into fall into place I loved it. It's funny, smart, and it has great music. My favorite part is probably the end with Hope Davis singing and the entire cast dancing during the rolling credits. I thought they were great. I'm probably going to buy this now.",1273363200,,498,4.197916666666667
1221233,4,B00000ICUW,"It's silly and clever at the same time.  Each state room on the ship presents a fine mess for these two boobs to get out of.  It suceeds as a Bob Hope/Bing Crosby ""Road"" picture, and, in my opinion, is as good as any of the vintage screwball buddy films.  I had some of my own buddies of mine over to my place for chicken dinner and too much wine, and I screened this movie for them. It was a big hit.

I agree that it's a little slow in starting, but there must be a setup for this type of film, and the slow start fills the bill. I don't recommend The Impostors for those who need a running gun battle in the first 5 minutes of their movies.

One of the fun parts is spotting about 20 actors who you have seen elsewhere.  ""Oh yeah, that's what's her name from West Wing.""  Or other movies and TV Shows.  For instance, that guy who plays Ben on Lost shows up here.  I think it's best NOT to look at the cast listing before watching this movie.  So many good actors having so much fun. I won't spoil your fun by naming any more.

The soundtrack is terrific too.  Lots of Astor Piazolla-like accordian and kind of Hot Club of Paris type music.

Tucci and Platt obviously have a great deal of affection and respect for the madcap movies of the past.  Their flick fits right in.  Timeless.",1269648000,,1286,4.129032258064516
1221234,5,B00000ICUW,"Please forget the amazon editorial review- he has no clue what this gem of a movie is about. No offense to him whatsoever. This movie still makes me laugh so much I have to pause the DVD several times EVERY time I watch it. It's pure silly fun and it's like a cinematic glass of champagne- Dom Perignon, please !

What is this movie about ? The so-called bygone era of the '30s with the tradition of the theatre deeply tied into it. The last scene brings both together in one of the best endings I've ever seen. It never takes itself seriously so why should we ? That's one of the things I love about The Imposters- it's a never-ending play on expectations and assumptions.

It's a challenge to write about movies or anything really, that references its own milieu. This isn't a movie about movies, thank goodness- instead it takes the aspects of an era of cinema and theatre that makes the writers, director and everyone involved in the creative process inspired to create their own version of an era that we have made nostalgic rather than alive and present. What a better way to celebrate that era but with a movie in our time that brings all that history right into this very moment ?

I do hope Stanley Tucci and company make more films like this. After Big Night and The Imposters I can watch anything they make ! And Oliver Platt in drag, alone, is worth the entire movie !",1240272000,,1380,4.403921568627451
1221235,5,B00000ICUW,"This is one of my all time favorites! A collection of brilliant performers ham it up to create this stylized and off-the-wall adventure filled with kooky, zany characters. I LOVE the fact that they apparently had a ""Jambon D'Or"" (golden ham) to award daily to the most ridiculous performance. This is what happens when talented, imaginative people collaborate to see how much fun they can manage on a production!",1234569600,,412,4.9855072463768115
1221236,4,B00000ICUW,"When you get two very funny guys (here it's Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt) together, the competition can cancel out the funny; here, however, we have a sophisticated piece of screwball slapstick that will light up any night. When two out-of-work actors decide to hop aboard a luxury liner in the '30's, it's a slew of sight gags and silliness that had me gasping. It's like a Vaudeville production of ""Grand Hotel"" and ""Clue"" on the Deep Blue. Get a tux and spend the bux for this one!",1234483200,,486,4.534090909090909
1221238,2,B00000ICUW,"When viewing this product on line, it was stated that this DVD was ""like new condition.""  I'm not sure that I agree after recieving this DVD that had quite a few scratches on it, two of them pretty bad.  It does play well, and that is the main thing I wanted.  Listing it as ""slightly scratched"" would not have changed my mind about buying it, but I feel I was misled on the condition.",1232582400,,385,4.175675675675675
1221239,5,B00000ICUW,"The Impostors has been my favorite movie since I first saw it on VHS nearly a decade ago. It has retained its treasured place in my heart despite competing with the likes of American Beauty, Iron Man, The Fifth Element, and The Forbidden Kingdom, to name but a few of my other top cinematic picks.
Why, you may ask? Because the comedic timing is flawless. The dialogue is polished until it shines, multifaceted and gem-like. The actors are clearly having a blast; the sets are at once endearingly familiar and enticingly exotic; the costumes are perfect; and Platt and Tucci have the same chemistry that made Laurel and Hardy so famous. This movie is exquisite, and though I've seen it again and again, I still laugh hard enough to cry every time.",1222128000,,747,4.666666666666667
1221240,5,B00000ICUW,"This is, hands down, one of the most under-appreciated comedies of all time.  Maybe my sense of humor is off, but I thought this tongue-in-cheek tribute to old Hollywood, the Marx brothers, and Broadway camp was fantastic.  Yes, it's over-acted.  That's part of the point and the charm.  Relax and enjoy - do not over-critique - and you're in for a lot of serious laughs.

1221241,5,B00000ICUW,"This is one of most hilarious movies! It keeps getting funnier every time I see it. The cast is amazing, the story is fun, and the dialogue just cracks me up. I highly recommend anyone to watch The Imposters. It's a guaranteed good time!!!",1203724800,,239,4.454545454545454
1221242,4,B00000ICUW,"Had I not hosted a free screening of this film almost a decade ago, I would have never seen it. Stanley Tucci wrote, directed, and starred in the film alongside Platt. It is a bizzare comedy about two out-of-work actors that stow away aboard a cruise ship amidst some even more bizarre characters.

You will find it hard not to laugh. How much you laugh, however, will depend greatly on your sense of humor. Fortunately, the actors and actresses play their parts so well, that the film is able to pull off a number of scenes that would have crashed and burned with different stars.

You might think me crazy as the story unfolds, but I guarantee you'll find a laugh somewhere.

Alfred Molina, Tony Shalhoub, Steve Buscemi, Allison Janney, Isabella Rossellini, and Billy Connolly are also on board to make sure this cruise sails into uncharted waters. Even Woody Allen makes a very humorous cameo appearance.

If you are looking for something different to watch and don't limit yourself to high budget blockbusters, become acquainted with THE IMPOSTORS.",1188345600,,1052,4.860335195530726
1221243,5,B00000ICUW,"Well, I've rented this thing so many times, it's time to buy it and give it a place of honor in my small collection. I think this is one of the best ensemble comedies made in the past twenty years. Sure, everyone in it is hamming it up, but they're all so talented that they pull it off.

I admit, I have friends who were not crazy about this movie, especially the first part pre-ocean liner. But I think the main two guys are very funny with their little scam at the baker's shop, and Tucci's ""beggars"" speech, even in what could be considered the setup for the meat of the movie. I thought the beginning credits over the muted restaurant scene was hilarious. And once they are on the ship, look out, all sorts of talented actors are trying like heck to out-overact each other. My favorites are Billy Connelly (""That's where we'll wrestle, my semi-Grecian lad!"") and Campbell Scott (""It has made me also... moist.) Isabella Rosellini, Steve Buscemi, Hope Davis - they're all fun.

You have to be able to get into the mindset of the thing, suspend your disbelief, and go to that naive, silly place in your brain. If you are a person who can do that, get this movie. Otherwise, maybe not.",1170806400,,1187,4.440366972477064

1221246,4,B00000ICUW,"Tucci, one of my favorite (and I think most underrated) actors, does a fine job emulating the styles of Woody Allen and Frank Capra in this homage to the madcap comedies of the 30's.  The brisk pacing, snappy dialogue and exaggerated characters make the film a treat.

Dozens of terrific cameo performances by stars like Isabella Rosselini, Campbell Scott, and even the great Woody, himself, are sprinkled throughout.  Authentic art-deco sets, costumes and music are pluses as well.

It's the best attempt at the genre in many years, but one still longs for the comedic talent of Hepburn, Lombard or Cary Grant.",1095984000,3,611,4.96078431372549
1221247,3,B00000ICUW,"This comedy should have been great.  Actually, it starts wonderfully, with Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt playing unemployed actors during the Depression-era, and the opening credits show a brilliant Laurel and Hardy-like silent comedy.  Then, the film traces their struggle to keep their heads above water, with assorted episodes of their life, one of which include a big surprise cameo of W.A. who plays a henpecked stage director.  So far, everything is really great.
Then ""The Impostors"" gradually loses its power though it never fails to be charming.  The pair go to see one of the most terrible stage of Hamlet (done by Alfred Molina), and after being mistaken for criminal for assaulting this ham, they accidentally find themselved on the ocean line leaving for Paris.  On this ship, Tucci and Pratt meet many, many strange characters.  I only cite the names of actors: Steve Buscemi (as suicidal 'Happy' Frank, who entertains us with crooning), Isabella Rossellini, Lili Taylor, Cambell Scott, Tony Shalhoub, Billy Connolly, Hope Davis and others.
The star/director Stanley Tucci is always amusing with manic turns, and so is Pratt, but the screwball comedy situaltion which directors like Ernst Lutbisch was good at needs quite a sophisticated and tightly-woven script.  ""The Impostors"" doesn't have that, and as the film nears to the end, it becomes more like a farce, which itself is not bad, and I like that kind of comdey, but the lack of polished story is painfully obvious when we see Connolly plays a tennis pro (and Greek) whose character is based on now hackneyed gay jokes.
""The Impostors"" is not a bad film.  It shows intelligence of the director, and there are some brilliant moments.  But it stops short before the lofty aim of ressurrecting the old-style comedy.",1065744000,3,1785,5.04421768707483
1221250,1,B00000ICUW,"First off, something I liked: The production value of the film and the DVD transfer is very good. Sadly, this is the best I can say about the film.
The film itself? A good premise poorly executed. Firstly, the previously-mentioned overacting is wholsesale replacement for actual acting by all the characters. Any real acting in The Impostors is torpedoed by ""performances"" so over-the-top you're expecting John Lovitz' ""Great Actor"" character from SNL to stride onto the screen, waving his arms and yelling, ""Stop it! Stop it!"" The worst offenders are Steve Buscemi, Alfred Molina and Isabella Rosselini, whose performances are nothing but overacting to the extent the character is nothing but air. You watch the film with a sort of horrified fascination, unable to tear yoursaelf away from this train-wreck of talent by so many actors who should have known better. The overacting stuns you until it inevitably bores you.
What acting there is (spasms of it by Oliver Platt and more evenly by Lili Taylor) is acceptable, but still nothing to risk a dime for. To say the characters are written one-dimensionally leaves no room to describe their portrayal. Archie and Jughead get more character development than the two main characters in this film. Director Tucci completely failed to engage my attention with any of the characters. They were dull, monotonal, uninteresting and I didn't give a fig for them.
Stanley Tucci does a fine job of playing Stanley Tucci. Unfortunately, Stanley Tucci as himself is not a compelling actor. Oliver Platt, one of my favorite actors, does his best to powerboat his way through heavy seas of melodrama and actually succeeds in bits and pieces. Given this film, that says a lot.
What purports to be a tribute to screwball comedies of the 1930s-1940s turns heavy-handed, stupid; and--worst of all--boring. This movie is a dog, and a dead one.",1060387200,3,1875,5.032154340836013
1221251,5,B00000ICUW,"I rented this movie on a whim one night ... I watched it 10 times in three days !  It was amazing !  The humor is very Marx Brother-ish, and the cast is amazing !  This is a true crowing moment for Stanley Tucci.  I had seen him in other movies, but he always seemed to be "" that guy in that movie "", very familiar.  But this is a glory moment for him.  This is a must won for an comedy fan !!!",1049760000,8,394,3.630952380952381
1221252,4,B00000ICUW,"The original title would have served the audience a little better, although the 40 minutes of set-up takes place in the Big City.  That's fine... the set-up is wonderful.  The few folks who gave such poor reviews would have understood much better what they were in for.
A friend of mine describes this film as ""a feast of overacting"".  Clearly a compliment, especially if you saw him say it... he grins from ear-to-ear and almost cracks up with the mere mention of the title.
I remember (the beautiful and talented) Isabella Rossellini on Late Night With Conan O'Brien talking about The Impostors.  According to her, director Stanley Tucci urged the cast to ham it up and offered a weekly contest... each week whoever over-acted the most would win the Golden Ham award.  Isabella was proud to say she was one of the winners (and you can tell which scene it is for).  Oliver Reed must be rolling over in his grave that he couldn't have been in the picture.
Each successive scene is more zany than the last.  From the brilliantly executed opening credits (which could be a great short film) to the chases in the bar to the wacky character introductions to the closing credits (the actors leaving the film studio whilst dancing) the film is an absolute treasure.
Just when you think it cannot get any sillier... it does.  Of course, all these great reviews (not to mention my obvious gushing) might leave you expecting much more.  Don't get carried away with the reviews... just think of the very British television farce Fawlty Towers.  If you liked that you'll probably love The Impostors.  This isn't a clever and witty little film... and it *never* attempts to be anything other than a cute and silly little comedy.  That said I walked out of the theater gasping for air and in pain from laughing so much.
At the current Amazon price...it's an absolute steal.",1034553600,3,1860,4.70679012345679
1221253,4,B00000ICUW,"It is no surprise that The Impostors didn't do much at the boxoffice. In a time when gross-out comedies are the rule, this stylish, charming effort is definitely the exception. What modern audiences may not realize is that comedy covers a rather broad area. Way back in the 1930s, W. C. Fields was doing now classic movies which were rude, crude and very funny, depending on what you finds amusing. In those days - and for the next fifty years - many different types of comedies were made. Perhaps today the media tends to want to believe the public's tastes are universally the same. I know that Hollywood's marketing strategies seem to come from one common pool of thought, which is why it often cannot market anything not fitting a certain mold.
The Impostors is a fond tribute to a gentler form of humor. Writer, director and star Stanley Tucci has proven with this and 1996's Big Night that he is one of our brightest independent film makers. His biggest attribute is his ability to make us laugh at certain stereotypes without ever being cruel. His is a loving touch.
The time seems to be the 1940s. Tucci and Oliver Platt play Maurice and Arthur, who are best friends and very out of work New York actors. Maurice is tall and thin and seems to be the heart of the pair, while short, chubby Maurice is its brain. Trying to con a baker out of some pastries, they wind up getting tickets to a production of Hamlet instead. During the performance the star, whom they can't stand anyway, winds up getting too drunk to finish the play. Later, in a bar, they are caught by the actor doing a rowdy impression of him. He becomes irate, and in the ensuing chase, the two somehow wind up as stowaways on a luxury liner. Naturally, the star winds up being one of the boat's passengers.
The ship is peopled with delightful eccentrics, including a broke socialite and her depressed daughter, a deposed queen, a gay tennis star, a psychotic Arabian sheik and a couple of fortune hunters. For the most part, the crew is equally mad, and Maurice and Arthur find themselves trapped in this madhouse at sea.
The film is full of sight gags and one-liners, most of which work. Lili Taylor, who later this year will appear as Eleanor in the remake of The Haunting and as Janis Joplin in the movie of the same name, is delightful as the sympathetic social director. Steve Buscemi nearly steals his scenes as a heartbroken crooner ironically named Happy Frank.
I really enjoyed this little jewel, and a most viewers with a sense of the absurd should, too. I even liked the movie's tag line. ""Why be yourself when you can be somebody else""? I am really looking forward to Mr. Tucci's next effort.",1016841600,25,2678,4.56964656964657
1221254,4,B00000ICUW,"There are certain films that sometimes don't appeal to a mass audience because so much of the humor is directed to a narrow audience that many people just cannot appreciate the full range of wit. It's not the audience's fault, people don't always enjoy something they don't understand. Nor is it always the filmmakers's fault, sometimes they err in believing the audience knows more than they actually do. I often find myself enjoying these films, but not always fully appreciating them until sometime later when a refrence is made clear to me. It's like ""The Simpsons"", a lot of the jokes only a very small minorty of the audience is going to pick up on. Thus is the case with THE IMPOSTERS.
THE IMPOSTERS is a delightful and charming little film that is full of wit and humor and proves for an entertaing 100 minutes of movie viewing. However, there are a lot of people who just won't understand the movie. The film stars Stanly Tucci and Oliver Platt as two unemployed actors who after insulting a world-famous ""bad"" actor, find themselves stowaways on a cruise ship bound for Paris. Tucci and Platt are a great comic team and I hope to see them work together in several projects to come. However, much of the movie is a tribute to the comic genius of Laurel and Hardy (a classic duo that lies in the realm of oblivion of the modern mass paradigm) and the Marx Brothers (a classic comic group that most people believe to be related to that guy named Lenin and thereby, should be avoided) two groups of genius which modern audiences just don't appreciate. Also, much of the humor of the film only appeals to those who have experience in the entertainment business (who else can fully appreciate the ""making faces"" scene or the humor in literally acting to stay alive) and makes a lot of the humor inaccessible to a wider audience.
With all that said, the film is still a delight to watch. Enjoy the film for what it is and in a few months you may find yourself chuckling at an obscure reference you just got.",1015977600,6,2010,4.55524861878453
1221255,4,B00000ICUW,GREAT SCREW BALL COMEDY WITH THE GREAT CAST FROM BIG NIGHT. I LOVED THIS MOVIE AS STANLEY TUCCI IS ON A ROLL AGAIN AFTER BIG NIGHT. BEST SCENE IS THE DANCING TO THE SONG  (I GET IDEAS). ENJOY.,1014422400,,192,4.052631578947368
1221256,4,B00000ICUW,"The trailer for The Imposters is shameful--it in no way indicates the freshness, the subtlety, and the hilarity of one of Stanley Tucci's efforts (on the heels of Big Night and preceding Joe Gould's Secret). I long put off watching this movie simply because the trailer was so overdone.
Thanks to a two-fer offer at the nearby Hasting's video store, however, I took the chance and rented it. Being the bourgeosie pig that I am (a trait pointed out to me by one of the movie's Leninist characters), I reveled in the European settings, the Twenties-era costuming and tunes, and the general lushness of the surroundings. But unlike most aesthetic efforts, in The Imposters the clothes and the backdrops and the jingles are pleasant but not distracting. As a review piece in Vanity Fair toasted, ""Long may they Charleston.""
From the very first scene, Tucci and Platt--two starving actors who constantly practice their craft in public, at home and ultimately on a cruise ship where they've accidentally stowed away--are funny and sharp and never boring. Their misadventures in conning a bakery chef out of some goodies, badmouthing the star of a local production of Hamlet, hiding from the cops on an ocean liner and uncovering numerous nefarious murder plots are punctuated by momentary examples of Tucci and Platt as two truly decent guys and good friends. Tucci's work here more than validates his past appointment as a spokesperson at Sundance.
Rarely have I seen two male film characters whose friendship doesn't rot into misogyny (In the Company of Men) or just plain ugliness and evil (Very Bad Things, Your Friends and Neighbors). Tucci as a screenwriter does not appear to tap into those veins, thank God.",1010534400,,1709,4.979020979020979
1221257,4,B00000ICUW,"Imposters is a head above the leading name brand movies.  It's witty and even side-splitting hilarious at moments.  The leads are wonderful actors who make the most of their juicy roles.  That goes for the German, too.  A fine film for the discriminating viewer.",1004140800,,262,4.886363636363637
1221258,4,B00000ICUW,"After the dubious merits of Big Night (in spite of winning awards, etc.), Stanley Tucci crafted this perfect gem of a comedy.  While Big Night seemed to strain for its laughs, this one's a flawless laugh riot.  At the beginning of the film, Tucci, very clever in his writing, evokes Laurel and Hardy--he's paired with Oliver Platt and the two are so redolent of the famous comedy duo of the past it's uncanny.  In fact, in one scene, Tucci's expressions are a dead ringer for Stan Laurel's.  I nearly fell off my chair!
In another scene, one of Tucci's disguises calls to mind Groucho Marx and while he doesn't mimic Groucho's lines or behavior, the look is also reminiscent enough to bring up a chuckle or two.
But it's not the calling to mind of past comedians that supplies the bulk of the humor--it's the clever situations.  Tucci and Platt, playing unemployed actors, fall in with as diverse a group of characters as you could hope to find on board a pleasure cruise ship.  Bearing in mind that the setting is the 30s, the dialogue snaps, crackles and pops, and the actors are all great.  Campbell Scott as the perfect German, Steve Buscemi as the suicidal entertainer, Hope Davis as the morose daughter of Dana Ivey who plays a now near-impoverished widow, and Billy Connolly as an award-winning athlete who glories in the, shall we say, perfect attributes of the male species--you can see that everybody was having a blast doing the movie.  They all relish what they're doing and it shows.
This is not a meaty work, but in its froth it's so tempting and side-splitting, it's definitely worth seeing--if not owning.  In addition to which, there is a cameo by a surprise, uncredited personality (quite well known) who adds his problems to the frustrations of Maurice and Arthur, the two unemployed thespians.
Great job, Stanley!",1002067200,7,1833,4.757097791798107
1221259,2,B00000ICUW,"I really need to view this one a few more times to do the beginning justice. The opening was compelling, but I kept wondering where Platt and Tucci were going with it. Things kick into gear once the action moves to the ship. I'd see it again for the performances of Lili Taylor and...of course!...Steve Buscemi. I appreciate the dark humor of Buscemi's character Happy Franks trying to off himself and failing at every turn (one of the attempts was with a magician's prop). Oliver Platt is sublime in the ballroom scene, as he tries frantically to warn would-be victims of the various plots and they just don't get it.",999302400,,618,4.627272727272727
1221274,5,B00000ICUW,"Just sit back and wait to be entertained.  On second thought, you may need to actively participate in this one.  The humor is not for the simple-minded.  It reminded me of an old Marx Bros. movie.  Someone else described it as a madcap farce.  Excellent description.
I rented it after I heard Campbell Scott say he was in it-that was enough of an endorsement for me.  I had just seen him in Hamlet (his own version, also very good) and Dying Young so, yes, this was an unexpected side of him.  But so, so worth watching! I'd love to see this same troup of actors do more together (Daytrippers also stars Hope Davis [Emily in The Imposters], Stanley Tucci and Scott - also excellent).
Watching it a second time will surely reveal some things you missed the first time.  Enjoy!",992822400,4,775,4.485714285714286

When I look back upon my life, the two hours I want back first are the 120 interminable minutes I spent watching 'The Imposters.'  It is neither funny, clever, enjoyable or insightful.  Its vaunted 'tribute' aspect - the take that it is a riff on the golden age of Hollywood - is highfalutin nonsense.
Tucci did well and showed promise with 'Big Night.'  How he got from there to 'The Imposters' (in one film!) is beyond comprehension.  Maybe 'Big Night' was just the equivalent of a career .235 hitter suddenly hitting .320.  Maybe 'The Imposters' was an anomaly and he can get his mojo back for the next one.  Either way, there's a sense of career momentum stalled and opportunity squandered.

1221278,1,B00000ICUW,"Maurice (Oliver Platt) and Arthur (Stanley Tucci) are two wannabe stage actors who just can't seem to get a good gig but can locate a fine mess.
After going  to see  Hamlet, featuring Jeremy Burtom,  an actor they  despise, Arthur and Maurice go to a pub and discuss their horrible theatre  going experience with their chums. No sooner do the nasty words come out of  their mouth, when the actor,  Jeremy Burtom (played by Aflred Molina)  should overhear the conversation which blasts his rendition of Shakespeare.  From there, Maurice and Arthur are pursued through New York City by Mr.  Burtom and his entourage in a most Chaplinesque of chases. Finally they  become stowaways on a cruise ship bound for Paris. They must now disguise  themselves in order to not arouse suspicion. And so they become stewards on  the ship, hence the name Impostors.
The irony of the story is that while  the two unemplyoed actors are using their thespian ablities to be the best  cabin boys they can be, they come across none other than Mr. Burtom. Who  would have thought he would be on the cruise. The truth of the matter is  however, that the mediocre Elizabethan imitator is hardly the worst of  their worries. The impostors must devise a way to foil a terrorist action.  Tony Shahloub is reunited with Tucci for the second time since their 1996  gastronomic repetoire, Big Night, where the two are brothers trying to get  a gourmet restaurant off the ground. This time nonetheless, Shaloub's  character is Voltri, the terrosrist posing as a crew member; and the only  thing getting of the ground this time is the ship which he intends to blow  up in a political declaration.
I know what you're thinking, this sounds  too heavy to be a comedy. The fact is that it is not the plot which will  disappoint filmgoers. Instead, it is the rather endless arrays of silly  frolics up and down the ship, along with rather trite attempts at old  melodramatic comedies the likes of Abbott and Costello for tight  situations, and Mel Brooks due to the carried-away, ""stretched- to-  the- max"" milking of scenes.",959040000,5,2087,4.748603351955308

The setup:  Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt are two hapless, out-of-work actors who find  themselves on the lam on a cruise ship, where numerous intrigues and  misunderstandings are under way. These secondary stories eventually get  entangled and lead to a madcap ending. The first half is stronger than the  second, but there are classic moments throughout.
I hope this ensemble  continues to work together, especially the comedy-writing duo of  Tucci/Scott, who are both so adept at playing out absurd moments of  miscommunication. If they do, it could really rejuvenate the spirit of  comedy.",958953600,8,798,5.2204724409448815

1221281,4,B00000ICUW,"The opening scenes for The Imposters are some of the most sublime I've seen in recent years. They play like a silent comedy, with melodramatic classical music on the soundtrack. The opening credits alone make this film  worth owning. And although The Imposters never truly lives up to those  scenes it remains constantly funny and unique(in these days of ironic self  referential teen comedies).
  I would have prefered it if our two main  heroes had never gotten on a ship, its too limiting for the scope that had  been suggested by the early New York scenes. But that should not be enough  to deter you from this film. Where else would you meet a drunken  Hamlet(Alfred Molina), a gay Scottish wrestler (Billy Connely), a suicudal  singer named Happy Franks(the always ace Steve Buscemi) among a  host of  other bizarre creatures. This is like those overrated comedies of the 1940s  except its funny and beautiful to look at. Which brings me to the art  direction of this movie, which looks a lot like the wonderful Bullets Over  Broadway. Infact The Imposters is a lot like that film but with the comedy  played much broader.
  I previously watched Stanley Tucci's fantastic  gastronomical delight Big Night(5 STARS), while this film is not quite that  good, I am now officialy a fan of his and await his next offering Joe  Gould's Secret when it comes out here.
