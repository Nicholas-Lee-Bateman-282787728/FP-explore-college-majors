  * Bonus Disc: Exclusive Future Sailors Documentary.

The 2006 is the Might Boosh Live DVD. So if you are buying this you won't need to purchase that. I didn't realize this when I ordered this (already had the first live DVD) not that it changes my mind on getting this as well, I just now have to go through the trouble of finding someone else I know who can view PAL and NON US dvd's. You'll really want to check out the reviews on the UK site.",1323734400,16,756,4.593984962406015

8144091,5,B000I5XNBK,"I admittedly didn't read the full description when I purchased this(I just really wanted to see the Future Sailor show). So, I didn't realise it also had the first Mighty Boosh live show as well. I was very excited to discover that and enjoyed not only the shows but the backstage antics as well.",1458518400,,296,4.5
8144092,5,B000I5XNBK,Check the region code before you buy this. It's worth the buy even with just the card game.,1428883200,,91,4.111111111111111
8144093,5,B000I5XNBK,"I feel like this is one of the Boosh's best moments. Despite it containing a lot of content seen in their radio and television performances, this feels like the Boosh unconstrained by television and radio morals - raw, improvised, and energetic.

For those in North America: this disc worked flawlessly in my computer's Blu-Ray drive, despite being from the U.K.",1420934400,4,362,5.033333333333333

8144095,5,B000I5XNBK,"Please put this box set along with the Childrenmen documentary for Region 1.  Anyways, if you are a fan of the Boosh...Get yourself an all region player or a program for your computer to play the two live concerts.  They are awesome and you will find yourself watching them over and over again.  I have turned friends on by showing the concerts and then the tv shows.",1405900800,2,367,4.447761194029851
8144096,5,B000I5XNBK,"As far as I know, this is the last thing they did as The Mighty Boosh together.  A wonderful last piece if you have the DVDs and books.",1368144000,2,135,3.8214285714285716
