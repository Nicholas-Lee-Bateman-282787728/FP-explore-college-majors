5915182,5,B00EI3XANO,Diagnosis Murder is still great!  It is wonderful getting to see Dick Van Dyke act along side his son Barry.,1382659200,,108,4.4
5915183,5,B00EI3XANO,I enjoyed these movies. I really really enjoy this series. It came well within the stated shipping time. I would recommend these movies to any one who enjoys mysteries.,1381708800,3,168,4.827586206896552
5915184,5,B00EI3XANO,"I have been waiting for a long time for the rest of the series to come to DVD.  I purchased the first three seasons as soon as they came out, but then nothing.  It was very upsetting.  Now, I am a happy camper again.  Can't wait for the other seasons to come out.",1381622400,,263,3.9056603773584904
5915185,5,B00EI3XANO,"Again, I am happy that I can enjoy the Diagnosis Murder series for a long time to come.  They are terrific",1381536000,,106,4.0476190476190474
5915186,5,B00EI3XANO,"A wonderful heart warming and intelligent detective series, light years away from the modern preoccupation with cold, dark characters and crewel, sinister and often violent plots.  If you enjoy seeing the best of humanity dealing with the adversities and selfishness that life can throw at one from time to time, then this is the series to watch.  Intelligent, uplifting and highly engaging.",1381190400,,391,5.290322580645161
5915187,4,B00EI3XANO,"Anytime you partner Dick Van Dyke and tv-It's a hit!!! You get the comedy aspect Dick has always brought to tv and a show you are not embarrassed to watch with your kids. As a kid, I loved the show and couldn't wait to get it!",1380672000,,226,3.9347826086956523
5915188,5,B00EI3XANO,"WE all know the show, and who  played in it. IF you want to complete your series like i'm doing then step right up to amazon and order. your money is well spent for a show that has just about everything you want in a show. I want to tell you about some of the shows in this set, BUT,  you have to get it to see for your self. The guest stars are people that had their own shows, and that makes diagnosis murder a top 10 show. I wonder who is going to get hurt !!! How do the doctors solve each murder in the  show ?. I'M getting ready to watch season 5.",1379808000,4,553,3.75
5915189,5,B00EI3XANO,"It has been a very long time since my name went on the ""notify me when this product is available"" list for the balance of Diagnosis Murder, one of my all-time favorite television series.  I bought the first three seasons as soon as they became available, but was forced to anxiously await the others.  Each season contains some of the most memorable episodes and having a complete collection to view as often and whenever I wish is my goal.  It was a frustrating wait for seasons four and five, and I only hope that the remaining seasons are released more promptly.  This is a fantastic cast who feel like family to those of us who watched them on TV each week and I now say, ""Welcome home!""",1379462400,8,691,4.417322834645669

5915197,5,B00EI3XANO,I am collecting the entire series.  The thought that it ran for 10 yrs while he was 65-75 yrs old is just amazing.  It is great evening entertainment with laughs.  Gotta love him.,1393372800,,179,4.363636363636363
5915198,5,B00EI3XANO,I love this show so much!  I have been waiting so long for the rest of the seasons to be put on dvd.  The only thing that I don't care for is that the seasons that have put out recently are in two parts.,1391558400,,203,3.590909090909091

5915200,4,B00EI3XANO,"Been looking for the Murder Two episodes ever since they took DM out of syndication.  The additional episodes are just a bit of frosting.  Like the Dick van Dyke tv series, this series is overpriced but all I needed was this portion of this season.  For that it was a good buy.",1388361600,,277,4.288461538461538
5915201,1,B00EI3XANO,I like the show and wanted to own it.  I am sorely disappointed in the lack of Closed Captioning or Subtitles.  Why are manufacturers allowed to put out DVDs without this necessary feature?,1388275200,,189,4.696969696969697

5915204,5,B00EI3XANO,"What can I say.  It's Dick Van Dyke, and great mysteries.

5915205,5,B00EI3XANO,"I believe that I should have waited for the complete fourth season but when this season became available, I jumped at the opportunity to purchase it. I loved the series and am pleased to have the DVDs to play whenever I want to view them",1384473600,,237,4.288888888888889

5915207,5,B00EI3XANO,"Excellent, as always.  Some of the endings took me completely by surprise.  The acting and script writing are good, and these will really hold your attention.",1383523200,2,158,5.038461538461538

8605521,4,B00EI3XANO,"The fourth season part two continues in the same vein.  There are murders.  Dr. Sloan (Dick Van Dyke) solves them.  The rest of the cast tags along.  Some of the costars prove useful.  Ben Matlock (Andy Griffith) and Joe Mannix (Mike Connors) show up as though they all live in this alternate universe that allows for this.  Norman Briggs (Michael Tucci) is almost blown up as he departs the series.
Very entertaining.",1511136000,,418,4.736111111111111
