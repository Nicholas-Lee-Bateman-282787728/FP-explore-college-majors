7959484,1,B000063JZK,"I had no expectations for this film. I just wanted a no brainer action flick with some good looking women in it. (WARNING - spoilers ahead) The story which was the strongest part of the film dissapointed me in the end when you find out the main heroine used to be a man who was deeply in love with main villain (also a man). Once this was revealed I began to lose interest in the female lead actress. The action was slow, boring and when the end of the movie finally came I breathed a sigh of relief and gave the dvd away and I have certainly not missed it.

I have to say this though, if you want to see something different and are not just in it for the girls and violence this might be and intersting movie for you. Like I stated the story is the strong point its the acting, pace and action which just doesn't hold up.",1163721600,9,822,4.074074074074074
