7888205,3,630537158X,"This movie stars Chi Kuan Chun whom I prefer more in supporting roles. It is a solid movie,but lacking in some areas. The plot pretty much revolves around trying to find out the identity of the evil murderer named Golden Mask. The movie does have a few twists and turns and is a well done solid movie.",973814400,,301,4.298245614035087
7888206,4,630537158X,"Fierce Martial arts, with a very intense plot line, and an amazing villian (or should i say villians?) make Golden Killah a surprise in my mind.  I have red a few reviews on other sites and they have given it no credit.  In  my mind they are all wrong.  Finally a Martial arts film that keeps you  thinking, and double guessing yourself, while at the same time boggles your  mind with some fantastic fights.
Golden Killah, Golden indeed",964656000,,436,4.5256410256410255
7888207,2,630537158X,"This movie was pretty much average in every department.  The story , the acting, and the fighting. But the only bad thing is the horrible picture quality. I mean this version is worst than VHS tape, its so blurry. The  only reason to buy this movie on DVD is to get the chapter selection so you  can go to any fight scene in the movie , and to add it to your Wu Tang DVD  Collection. I would have given this movie a higher rating if the picture  was better.",955756800,,457,4.033333333333333
