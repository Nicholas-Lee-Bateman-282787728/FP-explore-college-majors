8619726,5,B00FZHS43I,"I am a Parelli student working on my level 4 and ordered this video to add to my library of excellent horsemanship videos and books.  Kalley is a great presenter and this DVD is high quality and with my bad hearing, I've had no problems understanding and hearing what's being said.  If you are a Parelli student and do any colt starting or work with young horses, I highly recommend this video.",1389225600,,394,4.458333333333333
