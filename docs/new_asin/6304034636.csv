7860060,1,6304034636,"Just about every documentary I've watched about The Beatles (many!) were produced in a way to make you feel as though you were right there during the Mania in the 60's.

Not so with ""The Beatles Story.""

The approach of this documentary is the equivalent of a museum exhibition: A clinical approach - showing a clip from Ringo's mother and stepfather talking over a panorama of how that house and street look in Liverpool today (to give just one example).  I felt as though I was an observer and not part of the action.

One would do better to watch ""Anthology"" to get a complete picture of The Beatles.  If that's too much, try another video, ""The Compleat Beatles.""  Though the latter was made in 1982, it's still thorough and more real than this.

Major thumbs down.",1143072000,,769,4.569343065693431
7860061,1,6304034636,"I second the opinion of another reviewer who also gave this film one star. Whatever artistic reasons film makers had in mind, it is simply impossible to make a decent film about the Beatles without including a piece from their song. And it smells cheap! I'm not well informed Beatles expert, but I know the names of George Martin and Derek Taylor. No words by these people, instead all film is based on interviews with two-three others who were indeed witnesses but in no way took part in the Beatles art.
This is a budget film, do you want it or not. And the Beatles deserved something better.",1011830400,12,594,4.5092592592592595
7860062,5,6304034636,I thought this movie throughly explained what it was like to be a Beatle. I give it five stars for the HOT guys and the explicit details!,1011571200,,137,4.111111111111111
7860063,1,6304034636,"If you are some kind of bad documentary junkie who can't get enough of the VH1 Behind the Music ..., this is the video for you. Beatles fans, stay away! I'd really only give this ""specialty"" item one half star. Not one note of Beatles music is on this tape (the makers obviously didn't have the time or money to actually get licensed fab four tunes). Instead, we get a blend of elevator muzak and other sound-alike liverpudlian bands, neither of which could fool a toddler into thinking it was them. Not since the Ed Rudy ""live"" rip-offs of the 1960's have I seen such a blatant violation of the Sacred Beatles'  name. I spit on this tape. Adding insult to injury, a bunch of ""groupies"" share meaningless tidbits of information with us, none of which having much relevence to Beatles' history. Aside from some rare interview material it is utterly useless and a terrible disgrace. BEWARE!",996537600,37,888,4.656050955414012
7860064,5,6304034636,"This movie is GREAT! If you would like to purchase any beatles movie i reccommend this one. I would rather have this one then help, magicical mystery tour, or yellow submarine. This is the greatest beatle movie EVER!",992736000,3,216,4.7105263157894735
7860065,5,6304034636,"Although little in the way of new information or unseen footage is found in this video, I STILL enjoyed it.  This was a delightful retrospective and a Magical Mystery Tour back to the Beatle Year, 1964!  I especially loved the early footage from the rock clubs in 1962 to the Beatles' arrival in America in 1964.  This is just a nice little video that will never fail to entertain and delight.  I give it a YEAH, YEAH, YEAH and two thumbs up rating!",973900800,5,449,4.373493975903615
7860066,3,6304034636,"I really anticipated this video being a die-hard fan of the Bea tles. But there is precious little new information and footage. There is too much  commentary from people that I am not interested in. This reinforces my  feeling that the producers needed something to fill in the gap. The video  runs about 60 minutes and at times fleshes out film we are all familiar  with but very briefly. If you are new to the Beatles or have a casual  interest and don't want to spend the money for the Anthology ,you might  enjoy this. As for me this was just a momentary fix!",966988800,13,563,4.365384615384615
