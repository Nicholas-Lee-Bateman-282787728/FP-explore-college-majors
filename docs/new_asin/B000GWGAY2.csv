2620352,4,B000GWGAY2,"My ratings for the Fangoria Frightfest Films:

These are not detailed reviews. Just my quick thoughts.

Hunger (4.5) Intense with good acting.
Dark House (4.5) Silly but a really fun ride.
Grimm Love (3.5) Well made but off putting story.
Fragile (3.5) Well acted but a tad slow.
Tomb (3.0) Take it or leave it.
Road Kill (2.5) Not as good as I hoped.
Pig Hunt (2.5) Needs more of the ""Ripper"".
The Haunting (2.0) It's dubbed!",1281312000,3,426,4.51948051948052
2620353,4,B000GWGAY2,"Fragile takes place in a Hospital soon to be abandoned as it is being closed down. Calista Flockhart comes on as a Night Nurse to help out during the transition and discovers something is not right. Overall it was a bit slow for my taste during the middle but picks up. Fragile is a nice change as it is a well made Ghost Story. Fragile is so far the best of the Fangoria Frightfest series I have viewed and I have seen four: Pighunt, The Haunting (HORRIBLE and dubbing actually was so bad I laughed) and Road Kill. Calista Flockhart is good and overall the acting in this film is as well. The Hospital itself is quite creepy. Worth watching for sure :)",1281225600,6,653,4.317073170731708
2620354,4,B000GWGAY2,"In a soon-to-be-vacant children's hospital, new night nurse Amy Nicholls (played by one of the more fragile-looking actresses of our time, Calista Flockhart) begins the task of readying the patients for their move to another hospital on the same island. The opening scenes with a particularly prescient orphan named Maggie (Yasmin Murphy) set the audience up for the spookiness to follow. Apparently, mysterious broken bones are not the only things to haunt this hospital.

Spanish writer/director Jaume Balaguero wastes no time, presenting the audience with thunder, lightning, vibrating drinking glasses, and messages spelled out with children's blocks by an unseen presence. Nurse Amy is remote, neurotic, and using some type of medication--emotional problems, perhaps? After a terrifying episode in a renegade elevator, she doubles the dose of capsules from a maddeningly anonymous bottle.

Children in the hospital refer to a mechanical girl--Charlotte--who ""lives"" on the second floor, which was abandoned 40 years ago. Just as the audience begins to question why these children, who seem healthy, are hospitalized, it is revealed that Maggie has cystic fibrosis.

Amy's predecessor left her position at the hospital suddenly, and when Amy visits her home to question her about some suspicious happenings, she learns that the nurse had died in a car accident the previous day. Soon Amy, who is haunted by her own ghosts, begins seeing the manifestations the children have witnessed and that the staff either denies or ignores.

The cast is well able to handle this familiar, yet creepy, tale that examines both emotional and spiritual haunting. Thoughtful performances elevate ""Fragile"" above the level of so many thrillers and horror films.
It's a worthwhile ghost story that chills to the very end.",1279584000,17,1806,5.4163701067615655
2620355,4,B000GWGAY2,"Although almost all of these ghost stories have a formula they follow, what separates the yawners from the good ones is a good cast of actors and this one has that in spades, plus a great director.
Watching this movie is time well spent.",1261526400,,237,4.409090909090909
2620356,2,B000GWGAY2,"This movie starts out like some sort of glorious hybrid of several non-Movie horror classics - Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting Of Hill House"", the videogame ""Silent Hill 2"", a smattering of Koji Suzuki's ""Dark Water"" collection, and with elements of Steven King, William Peter Blatty, Stanley Kubrick, Ira Levin and so forth.

And then, somewhere around the halfway mark of this 97-minute exercise in disappointment, it all goes horribly wrong, and the gorgeous cinematography, interesting premise and truly creepy and tense feeling of impending doom are wrenched cruelly away from the viewer, and are replaced with one of the most anticlimactic second halves I've ever seen in movies.

Amy Nicholls (Flockheart) is an American nurse with a tragic past, recently come to Mercy Falls Children's Hospital on the Isle of Wight to take up the post of staff nurse. She befriends a troubled little girl named Maggie, whose imaginary friend is a whole lot more real than either Amy or any of her colleagues could imagine.

Firstly, the acting's not the main draw in ""Fragile"" - Flockheart, Richard Roxburgh and Gemma Jones do very good jobs in their roles - Flockheart must be praised for a convincing first half performance, and then for doing her level best with the apalling script in the second half. The kids are child actors - not terribly good ones, but not so bad as to make you want to switch off - and, while there are one or two dreadful performances turned in by the likes of amateurish Colin McFarlane and histrionic Elena Anaya, all in all, the actors, while decent enough, take a very marked back seat to the talents behind the camera.

Xavi Gimnez's eerie, haunting, expressive cinematography and Jaume Balaguero's outstandingly tense direction deserve huge praise - even in the let-down latter half of ""Fragile"", the visuals retain a charisma and a genuine tension that are worth seeing. The special effects are good, too, with next-to-no CG animation to muck up the reality of a surreal situation, we are totally hooked by the desolate, rain-swept countryside vistas and the long, foreboding corridoors and wards of a near-abandoned hospital.

Sadly, the visuals can't save the script - it's a mess. Given the beginning, it's like this movie ought to have had a different ending - more Hitchcock, more Hideo Nakata, and a hell of a lot less Hollywood Horror - but somewhere along the line it was decided to tack on an ending that's someone's idea of ""accessible"" - and this does ""Fragile"" the biggest disservice, by turning a carefully crafted sense of mystery and despair into Just Another Horror. Amy's burgeoning romance with Dr. Marcus isn't resolved, neither is the mystery of her sad past - and the ""twist"" in the tale is revealed with such bald flatness that you might just turn the DVD player off before the final credits roll.

Don't bother seeing this movie, it's certainly worthwhile in the beginning, but the intense and crushing disappointment of the latter half will negate any satisfaction you'll have amassed.

Avoid.",1187308800,2,3044,4.956862745098039
2620357,2,B000GWGAY2,"This is another churned out horror flick that fails to deliver. After its promising start the movie spirals down into the farcical. It actually brought tears of laughter to my eyes. Wow,just writing this review brings the whole stupidity of it back to me. Save your cash.",1160265600,,271,4.787234042553192
2620358,3,B000GWGAY2,"You may not believe me, but it is true. Calista Flockhart, best known for her delightful (or irritating, depending on your perspectives) turns in the popular TV series `Ally McBeal' is now in a Spanish horror film (in which all the characters speak English, though). Director Jaume Balaguer (`Darkness') successfully delivers a spooky mood of a rundown hospital on the Isle of Wight, where a sad-faced American nurse Amy (Calista Flockhart) is transferred from London for the night-shift work.

But we know better than she does. In the effective opening sequences, we know that there is something weird going on in The Mercy Falls Children's Hospital, very old facility that is going to be shut down soon; that is, one of the patients, little girl Maggie says `she is coming' and a little boy experiences a nasty and painful thing.

`Fragile' is most scary in the first half, where everything is put in the right place, all contributing to creating the creepy feeling of a haunted house. The tricks themselves are not new, but all nicely handled - such as strange noises, the sealed and deserted second floor, a mysterious `mechanical girl' and some old history of the building. Cinematographer Xavi Gimnez (`Darkness' `The Machinist') did a fine job, capturing the creepy images of the dark interiors of the hospital.

But as in `Darkness,' Jaume Balaguer tries to do too much in the second half. The film implies not only Amy's tragic past, but the love interest for her, a doctor played by dull Richard Roxburgh, and the more it tries to encompass, the more plot holes start to be seen. And as to the acting, sorry to say this, but the kids are better than the adults. Calista Flockhart shows a surprisingly good performance at first, downplaying the role of tormented Amy, but sadly she starts to overact in the last half, where she keeps screaming and rolling her eyes.

You notice `Fragile' shares the same theme as `Darkness' - missing children, for example - and probably `Fragile' will be better received by American audiences than the other  (if it is not heavily cut, of course). It is deeply flawed, but is still a good choice for a sleepless night.",1158451200,2,2161,4.814016172506738

2620368,4,B000GWGAY2,"If theres one thing I really believe in, its that all actors should have at least one or two horror movies in their resume. I loved Nicole Kidman in The Others, and Christina Ricci in Cursed, so when I heard Calista Flockhart had starred in a haunted house movie called Fragile, I had to get this movie. She plays an American nurse studying in London who is called down to help close Mercy Falls Hospital on the Isle of Wight. Her character is played with a back story we never really learn anything about, but then we really don't need to learn anything because once the movie starts moving forward, it runs forward so efficiently that it never once bogs down with exposition. The hospital Calista arrives at is old, outdated and falling apart, much like most stereotypical haunted sites, but she soon learns she is replacing a nurse who was scared so badly that she quit. In the childrens ward, she meets a distant young girl named Maggie (Yasmin Murphy) who gradually fills her in on the strange stories of the hospital. Actor Richard Roxburgh goes against playing a psychotic character for once, portraying the night physician, Dr. Richard Carey, one of the hospital staff members sympathetic to the plight of the kids, and slowly delving into the locations past for the identity of the spirit. The kids are terrified by a presence they call Charlotte who is breaking their bones at night to keep them from leaving and is getting more dangerous as things keep progressing. Director Jaume Balaguero does an excellent job setting up the atmosphere and scares slowly at first and building up to a pitch where Calistas character goes from suspicious to curious and gradually terrified as she realizes the children are in danger, rescuing Maggie from the top floor as the hospital seems to crumble around them. Its everything a good haunted house movie should be; thick with atmosphere and light on the special effects with the highlights on the character performances rather than on the ghosts. Unfortunately, there is nothing here to appeal to the gore hounds who prefer blood and violence. Fragile is an intense intellectual ghost story with atmosphere, a strong cast and a top-notch plot that moves along briskly.",1426032000,3,2216,4.849604221635884

2620373,3,B000GWGAY2,"I like ghost stories, and I have seen a lot of them.  There are certain patterns, rythms that most of them follow.  This is good, I think,
(and this is just my opinion), when a writer and or director uses the conventions to surprise us, and totally mess up eveything we
thought was going on in the film.  Given the quality of the entire cast of the film, everyone. including the child actors, I was really
hoping for something not just scary, but, at the far extreme, groundbreaking.
Unfortunately, this film was just too safe.  It takes place in a hospital that is getting ready to close.  Why it was still open to this
point, I don't know, but due to a disaster that filled up the other hospital. (this was supposed to be on the Isle of Wight. so maybe
there was only one other hospital in the area), they of course left the sick chidren there for a couple more days so that Calista
Flockhart's character could get a temp nursing job, and maybe find out what what the heck was so scary on that closed second
floor.  That's not a spoiler, they mention the horribler second floor right away.
I guess it's good that if they weren't going to close the whole  building. they at least closed that darned second floor.
Anyway, the film goes into familiar ghost story patterns.  It feels as if the movie itself is a residual haunting, with darkness,
scary sounds, and secodary characters who die on cue.
I don't feel like the film had enough ghostly or horror effects, except maybe at the end, where what's happening is finally
revealed.
There's a nod to ""Don;t Look Up"" with the two psychic women, a better film, though, I must say, I still don't quite get it.
Or ""The Man with Two Brains.""
Soooo, to wrap up, I upped the film a star because of the actors doing a good job through some bland material, and because
it did fufill its job of being a ghost story in the (very) classic sense.",1399593600,,1882,4.387931034482759

2620378,2,B000GWGAY2,"After sitting on the shelve for seven years, Fragile, has finally been released, as part of the Fangoria Frightfest. It's a strange movie that takes place in a decrepit children's hospital off the coast of England. The hospital is about to go out of business, when weird occurrences start taking place, leaving them short staffed. To fill the void, they hire an American nurse who quickly realizes that something at this hospital is very wrong. This film was very creepy, especially at the end, but it wasn't particularly exciting. It's extremely slow moving and tries to make a relevant point, but it's contrary to the whole premise of the film. The tagline states that the dead stay near the things they love, but in this film the dead are terrorizing what they supposedly love. As for the acting, it was pretty good despite the fact that half the cast were just kids.

2620389,4,B000GWGAY2,"FRAGILE (Frgiles) is a terrific dark scary creepy atmospheric intelligent ghost story. Made in 2005 and released as an episode film in the Fangoria Frightfest, this decent film was overlooked in the theaters but deserves more attention now that it is available on DVD - allowing it to be viewed in the safety of the home!  The story is written by Jordi Galceran and writer/director Jaume Balaguer  who demonstrate a rather sophisticated knowledge of a little known malady called Osteogenesis Imperfecta, a genetic disorder that makes the bones very brittle and easily (and frequently) broken.

The story begins on a foggy dark night as temp nurse Amy Nicholls (Calista Flockhart) steps off the ferry onto an island to fill in for a children's hospital that has been condemned but must keep one floor open until the island's other hospital recovers form over crowding following a significant accident.  She is met by the kindly Roy (Colin McFarlane) who escorts her to the dilapidated hospital where the administrator Mrs. Folder (Gemma Jones) takes her on a tour, explaining that the second floor is sealed and has been for some years, and introduces her to the day nurse Helen Perez (Elena Anaya) who in turn introduces Amy to the eight children, all with significant illnesses, who will be under her care.  There is one child - Maggie (Yasmin Murphy) who keeps to herself and is obviously terrified, her closest friend had been the nurse Amy is replacing.  Amy and Maggie bond and this bond serves as the thread that opens the doors to the terrifying mysteries of the hospital.  Noises are heard after lights out and Amy gradually learns form Maggie about the 'mechanical girl' who somehow influences the activities of the hospital.  There is a doctor assigned to Amy's ward - Dr. Robert Marcus (Richard Roxburgh) - who assists Amy and the children.  But Amy must find out if the fears Maggie has are founded and so she visits two old ladies (Freda Dowie and Matyelek Gibbs) who inform Amy of the story of one child and nurse who could be the connection tot he terror: the child had osteogenesis imperfecta and her ghost remains present in the hospital. Once Amy discovers this information she shares it with Dr. Marcus and the two face the decision as to how to manage the increasingly terrifying events at the hospital.

Calista Lockhart, the fine Australian actor Richard Roxburgh, the always excellent Gema Jones, and the surprising debut of young Yasmin Murphy make this film work.  Their performances are top notch, and the cinematography by Xavi Gimnez and the musical score by Roque Baos maintain an atmosphere of terror that is credible and keeps the audience on the edge of the seat.  Give this little film a chance- it is much better than the other films in this series!  Grady Harp, August 11",1312675200,,2806,4.845188284518828
2620390,4,B000GWGAY2,"Fragile is about an evil female ghost that haunts a childrens hospital. That's about it.

I have to say, the presentation is absolutely fantastic. Watching this movie reminded me of the creepiest hospitals of the video game series Silent Hill (especially in the very first SH game- you simply MUST explore the endless amount of freakiness that dominates that particular hospital!).

Fragile surprised me with a few other interesting features.  The widescreen view really elevated the greatness of the unnerving suspense.  It also made the atmosphere more enjoyable.  I suppose my one complaint is that I chose to watch this movie in the middle of the afternoon.  Had I known it was *this* good I would have waited until nightfall.

Anyway, I had mixed feelings with the storyline at first. I mean come on, it's about sick children having to put up with a persistently violent ghost, and having this one nurse (the star of the movie) constantly coming in and making sure they're able to fall asleep peacefully without any disturbances involving the ghost. It's enticing yes, *certainly* enticing, but at the expense of sick kids? Well, I was able to overlook the inclusion of sick children as the film rolled along.

There's a semi-scary elevator segment that's quite spectacular to watch. Sure, it's nothing particularly amazing that you probably haven't already seen in several other suspense or horror movies involving elevators that suddenly stop functioning, but it's pretty good nonetheless.

I absolutely *loved* whenever the nurse would visit the hospital room where the sick children were sleeping. The atmosphere was incredibly thick and worked like a thing of beauty. It reminded me of the Grunge quite a bit.  Terribly disturbing things happen, and they always happen just when you're looking for some terrifying surprises.  Excellent writing.

The only reason I'm not giving Fragile 5 perfect stars is because the storyline is very very basic. I expected something a bit more in the way of complexity, and well, I suppose it was full of twists and turns (especially the ending- a SHOCKING ending I must say- without spoiling what happens) but I was quite impressed with every other aspect. Worth watching for horror fans.",1311724800,,2233,5.087671232876712
2620391,4,B000GWGAY2,"I've watched a couple of the Fangoria Frightfest movies and I think Fragile is one of the better offerings. Though the storyline is a bit predictable, there are enough chills and plot twists to make this a compelling horror movie. Calista Flockhart plays Amy Nicholls, who takes on the job of night nurse at a remote children's hospital somewhere in England. Her predecessor had apparently left the job suddenly, and it soon becomes clear to Amy why this is so. There are mysterious goings-on at this children's hospital - the forbidding Gothic structure, the sealed-off second floor (which has been closed since the late 50s), unexplained injuries afflicting the young patients, and a strange little girl named Maggie who forms a close bond with Amy. Amy soon learns that a malevolent spirit is haunting the hospital, refusing to let the children leave (the authorities are in the process of evacuating the children from the run-down hospital) and the children have dubbed this spirit the ""mechanical"" girl. As Amy digs deeper, she learns the true nature of the haunting, a result of events played out several decades earlier. But will Amy manage to save the children before it is too late?

The cast does a credible job in their roles. Flockhart plays the night nurse with a measure of credibility. Plagued by demons of her own, Amy is quite a mess psychologically, yet tries her best to hold on to sanity as she works to help the children, especially the vulnerable Maggie who seems to be the central focus of the spirit. Then there's the cynical male doctor, Marcus (Richard Roxburgh) who tries to find a rational explanation for the strange events plaguing the hospital, until later events convince him otherwise. Gemma Jones (who has played some prominent roles in British period dramas such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sense-Sensibility-Special-Edition/dp/0800141660/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Duchess-of-Duke-Street-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B001ADXWYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Duchess of Duke Street - The Complete Collection</a>) plays the stern Mrs. Folder, who oversees the hospital, and knows more about the history of the hospital than the others. This movie will appeal to fans of atmospheric horror movies and those who love stories about haunted buildings.",1308960000,,2460,5.814404432132964
2620392,4,B000GWGAY2,"Finally the Fangoria Frightfest gets it right.  Their latest collection of eight hasn't really been that impressive--until this eerie ghost story.
Relying on its creepy hospital setting and a well-crafted screenplay, FRAGILE spins a frightening tale of a spirit named Charlotte.  Charlotte is not that sweet and she doesn't want anyone messing with her children.
Calista Flockhart is marvelous as Nurse Amy, who has her own personal demons, with good support from Richard Roxburgh and Gemma Jones.
I haven't seen THE HAUNTING or THE HUNGER yet, but so far FRAGILE is the best of the FRIGHTFEST.",1300233600,,594,5.177083333333333
2620393,4,B000GWGAY2,"The other reviews here have covered the story well enough already so I'll just add that if you're a fan of good old-fashioned, psychological ghost stories such as The Changeling, Ghost Story, and more recently The Ring, then this is a very worthwhile film to set down and take in on a Saturday afternoon or - even better - late-night! Special mention on the soundtrack by Roque Banos - the opening theme totally set up the mood of the movie and reminded me quite a bit of the work of the late, great John Barry. ""Fragile"" held my interest from beginning to end and is a creepy film definitely worth multiple viewings.",1299974400,,617,4.517857142857143
2620394,5,B000GWGAY2,"Fragile's most effective point is showcasing how different two people's idea of love can be. There's a stunning twist in the movie that makes the ending work very well. Calista Flockhart does a decent job as the leading protagonist Amy Nichols, managing  and deliver on the role of a new nurse flung into a disastrous situation in the midst of moving a  small wing of sick children from a dilapidated hospital to a different facility. Left alone as the night nurse after her predecessors sudden departure she's effectively as baffled and concerned as the audience as the supernatural elements build. While her over-acting on a few of the more emotionally intense scenes can get old, the genuinely frightening build of suspense and escalating violence of the situation keeps rightfully reclaiming the spotlight. It does feel like there's parts of the movie that were cut out for time or budget and I'd love to get my hands on some deleted scenes or a director's expiration of what was left out.

With a creepy location, slow building suspense, and relatively good acting, Fragile, was exactly what I wanted out of a ghost story. I watched this by downloading the rental last night and I must say I loved the price, the ease, and the simplicity of Amazon-on-Demand. It didn't take that long, with a few clicks everything was set up and by the time the husband and I were done bringing in groceries and had popcorn the movie was ready for us. I haven't been this genuinely pleased by a ghost story in a very long time. It's definitely worth the rental cost or purchase cost.",1298160000,3,1571,4.726277372262774
2620395,5,B000GWGAY2,"In a children's hosptial, many things seem to be goign wrong. The tale starts with a child finding himself injured and with no one to explain this hurt, and the tale gets darker from here. Apparently this thing, whatever it is, has been talked about for years in the hospital and things have been getting worse lately. It corresponds with a move that is taking place form this hospital to another, and it seems to get worse as time progresses. One nurse quits over this, too, frightened by something she has seen and the kids talk about seeing a girl, a mechanical girl, that lives on an abandoned floor of the hospital.

Of all the Fangoria movies, this had to be the most frightening. There were parts in it that actually dug their way into you spine and made you shiver, and I personally didn't expect that. What I expected was what many of the others gave you, a campy experience that reminded me of something I might have seen when I was younger, but no. This was the one movie I can say that actually made me feel like I was watching some true horror.

What made this movie were the setting, the atmosphere, the way everything was set up, and the actors. The setting was a hospital that looked like a horrible place with lots of bad memories, and the movie plays off this. It creates a great background and this place delivers even more as the world grows dark. The people in the place act well, too, and this is a great thing considering how you are counting on children to do the things that they sometimes miss out on. Here, there do it grand. And, finally, there is the story.

While you think you know what is going on really quickly, you do not. It has a great twist at the end that is twisted and turned, and this made me think ""that was great"" when I finished. I expected the very ending to be more dark but that did not come out, but the way the whole of the chase leveled out more than made up for it. Really, with the cost of these movies not being much it really made up for the way things were.

I have to give this movie a high grade because, really, it was worth the time I spent wathcing it.",1288224000,4,2113,4.248756218905473
2620396,4,B000GWGAY2,"This movie doesn't break any new ground in the ghost story genre. But it's scary enough. Its portentous gloom reveals its secrets in taut rubber-band pieces that snap back at you - as you know they must. But you never know exactly when or where you'll get hit.

Calista Flockhart plays her part pretty much on one note - the note of haunted melancholy. She looks haunted even as she arrives on this misty island off the coast of England to assume her role as nurse at a children's hospital. However in the Director's Commentary included on this DVD, the Director points out that there's a reason for her to be suppressed and apprehensive from the start, and that reason comprises a second mystery for the film to unfold.

The film's conclusion doesn't quite jibe with the manifestations that terrorize the remaining children and staff in this closing hospital. But you can't demand strict logic from a ghost.

My main disappointment with the movie is that it wasn't filmed in a real abandoned hospital. I got this DVD hoping that some authentic old, crumbling hospital would be used as the setting for the haunting and would become as much a character in the film as the old, closed Danvers State Mental Hospital became in the truly terrifying movie ""Session 9.""

However the ""hospital"" used here is clearly a combination of stage set and CGI creation. In the commentary, the Director explains that a real abandoned English boarding school was used as the faade of the presumed hospital that Flockhart was approaching. However they couldn't find or afford any suitable interior for the haunting itself, so they had to build one. That's too bad, because a ghost is so much an emanation from its original surroundings that it can't be transplanted into just any prepared bedding. The location scout for this film should perhaps have come to Chicago to consider the vast old Victorian Cook County Hospital, abandoned for years now, as a setting for the film. Or maybe the movie crew was afraid it would find too many real ghosts waiting for them in such a place.",1287360000,,2059,4.759103641456583

2620398,4,B000GWGAY2,"The horror genre used to be a favorite of mine, but then most of them became silly or so gory as to be nauseating.  Gore is NOT scary:  it's simply sickening.  This film is far above today's typical horror/ghost movie.  Amy (Calista Flockhart) is a nurse hired for the night shift at a children's hospital which is soon to be closed.  Most of the children have already been moved to another facility but Amy befriends Maggie, a troubled young girl, who the others claim can be difficult.  Maggie tells Amy that Charlotte--whom she refers to as the 'mechanical girl'-- lives on the closed second floor and it soon becomes evident that Maggie is afraid of Charlotte.

'Fragile' is eerie and creepy from beginning to end, with very little gore and lots of frightening and haunting elements.  The ending has an unexpected twist concerning the identity of the 'mechanical girl', along with a touching element taken straight from the story of 'Sleeping Beauty.'

Calista Flockhart turns in a great performance as the Nurse Amy, who comes to the story with a troubled past.  Yasmin Murphy, the beautiful youngster playing Maggie surely has a great future in the movies.  I was surprised to see Ivana Boquero, the young star of 'Pan's Labyrinth' in a small, non-speaking, but very crucial role.  If you like horror/ghost stories, 'Fragile' is one of the few well worth your time!",1284768000,,1371,4.836909871244635
