8502393,5,B006OT0TJI,"Great game, alot of offense, back and forth action. Great win for my Ducks, though I was there in person, reliving was wonderful. Rose Bowl is special place, great colors, atmosphere is so much fun. Entire game is on DVD, no commercials(thank god) A must for Duck fans.",1362528000,,269,4.625
8502394,1,B006OT0TJI,This is garbage.  The video quality is so low that it looks terrible even on a tiny laptop screen.  It's hard to imagine that anyone would officially license this thing.  I have seen bootleg dvds from Iraq that are higher quality than this.  I love buying from Amazon but now every time I buy something I will wonder if I am buying garbage like this!  Thanks for wasting my time Amazon LLC.,1335225600,,390,4.361111111111111
8502395,1,B006OT0TJI,"The video quality on this DVD is horrible, it might as well be VHS or beta for that matter. One would think the time and effort to burn the HD version would be no longer than a low quality version.",1334361600,,197,3.95
8502396,4,B006OT0TJI,"I assumed since the main sponsor was an HD television manufacturer (Vizio) and the DVD is billed as ""The Official Broadcast"" (which was broadcast in HD) that this DVD would be in HD.

The lack of HD video and 5.1 sound (stereo only) is disappointing.  To be fair neither the listing, nor the packaging claim HD picture quality or 5.1 sound.  The object the camera is focused on is clear when it's not moving too fast (i.e. NOT an Oregon player-BURN!). Everything else is grainy.

While I'm disappointed with the quality, this game way too momentous and and amazing to return the DVD.  3.5 stars.

8502397,4,B006OT0TJI,"I'm going to break this review down into two parts: The game itself and the DVD presentation.

The Game:

This is one of the most exciting games I've ever watched! I explicitly remember watching it the day after New Year's and knowing I'd be buying it on DVD even before the 1st quarter was over. If you like defense, this game isn't really for you, even though there are some good defensive plays here and there. If you like offensive shootouts, however, you'll LOVE this game! The offenses pretty much roam free in the first half, and while the defenses settle in a little in the second half, the offenses continue to shine into the final minutes of the game.

Rating for the game itself: 5/5

The DVD:

The video quality isn't great at all. When the camera is just focusing on stationary players, the quality is great. However, as soon as the ball is snapped, it becomes a little blurry, almost like you're watching a 3D movie without the glasses. I watched the DVD on an HDTV, and my other football DVD's have great video quality, so it is certainly this DVD that has lower quality. The complete broadcast is there though, and the extra features are the trophy presentation and post-game interviews (neither of which I've watched).

DVD presentation: 4/5

So in summation, the game is GREAT if you like offense. It is one of the most exciting and evenly-matched games I've seen (as were many of the big bowls this season). The video quality is lacking and may be a little distracting, but overall the DVD is still worth the price just to relive this exciting game!",1330128000,3,1568,4.578571428571428
