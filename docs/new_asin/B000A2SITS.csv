Brad Dourif (with compassion and remarkable acting skill) gives a bravura performance as a man with cerebral palsy who has no family and lives in a medical facility for the severely handicapped. Due to lack of funds to staff the institution, a proactive social worker (Rae Dawn Chong) sponsors a program with a local prison that enables prisoners to participate in a work-release program where they are each assigned an individual patient to attend to. They are each chained to their wards' wheelchairs, hence the title. This film was also released with the alternate title ""Common Bonds."" Michael Ironside plays a good-hearted street felon, imprisoned for vandalizing a police car while the cops were forcing a prostitute to provide them with free sex. Ironside is assigned to be Brad Dourif's attendant. After an uncomfortable period of adjustment, the two forge a friendship. In the course of the film they face many challenges, including attacks from a vicious inmate (Bruce Glover). This sadly neglected Canadian film should be on everyone's must see list! Kudos to director Allan A. Goldstein (who has created a classic film) and to Dourif, Ironside, Chong and Glover who serve him well plumbing the depths of their acting repertoires. I have seen this great film many times, but I have yet to receive the DVD. I hope the DVD quality does justice to this cinema masterpiece. After I receive the DVD I will emend this review accordingly. Enjoy this great film!",1508371200,,1538,5.01171875

I watch it everyday. It has no deleted scenes or behind the scenes. The movie by itself is great.",1456704000,,292,3.9661016949152543
