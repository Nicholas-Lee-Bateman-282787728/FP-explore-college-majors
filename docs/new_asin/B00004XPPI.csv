1368679,2,B00004XPPI,"I was a big fan of Cruel Intentions so when I heard of the T.V. series that was supposed to air last December I was excited, but then quicky dissapointed to learn that it had been cancelled. Well it recently aired on cable the other night and it was really not as bad as most people would think for a kind of straight to video movie. It is a prequel so you get to see how Kathryn and Sebastian really met and what ends up leading them to their little games they play with innocent guys and girls. Unfortunately none of the actors from the Cruel Intentions movie are in this sequel/prequel but it really was not that bad!! I can see how they would not air the series on T.V. cause it definately is not suited to be on regular T.V. but I found it to be funny and entertaining. It kept me interested the whole time. Watch it and see!",980208000,11,830,4.12962962962963

Except for Amy, the movie lacked the star power and acting chops of the original cast, but I thought it was a decent followup. It might have been more in character for Adams to have been the sweet virgin a'la Enchanted, but she played the devious vixen well.",1449532800,,426,4.3375

1368724,3,B00004XPPI,"As I write this it has been over a decade since this Straight to Video movie came out. I watched it again recently and Getting on the net looked at older reviews of it. Back then Amy Adams was unknown,and people did not like her portrayal as  Kathryn Merteuil. Now looking back I still enjoy her and the movie  and it is what I call a TIME CAPSULE film .What do I mean by this? There is a scene where the male character gives a gift of a cell phone to a girl and they make a big deal out of having one. Even though its only a movie it shows Kids having real face to face  discusions and not banging away on smart phones and texting constantly like in this day and age. Even still this movie is not that old as movies Go and as films from this era it sure is slick looking. There are alot of scenes with pasty well dressed females in limos and big sunglasses. It also has nudity which is something else you don't see much of in 2013 teen land. For aesthetic reasons THUMBS UP.",1380412800,,975,4.041450777202073

1368727,2,B00004XPPI,"Cruel Intentions 2 feels like it's trying to be a comedy, but never really hits the nail on the head when it pertains to actually making me laugh.

It's about these rich and spoiled attractive teenage girls that get their kicks playing mind games with a certain boy.

It might sound appealing reading the description, but the underwhelming delivery of the storytelling and the overall nonexistent interest factor makes any potential the movie had lose momentum *very* quickly.

Sometimes an extremely funny joke will come out of nowhere, but this only seems to happen as a way to make sure you're not drifting to sleep by the boring storyline.

This film is definitely one of many that totally breathes the time period of 10 years ago when storylines involving teens seemed to focus on undeveloped character development, along with the laughs and the storytelling not quite worthy enough to make a movie out of it.  This happened *so* many times back in the late 90's/early 00's it's not even funny.

It's probably the extreme unbelievability of all the characters involved that makes Cruel Intentions 2 feel like a big fake waste of your precious time.  That's my impression of it at least.  No no, it's the terrible writing.  It's BAD, trust me.

A few laughs aside, I can't recommend such a dreadfully boring movie to anybody.",1281916800,,1329,4.84070796460177
1368728,3,B00004XPPI,"Cruel Intentions II was originally written as a TV series version of 1999's deliciously evil original but FOX Television canceled it over `obscenities' before the first episode ever aired. The producers quickly re-edited the first three episodes of what was to be called ""Manchester Prep,"" added a few juicier scenes, and released it straight to DVD as a prequel to the first movie. The acting isn't as good nor are the players as beautiful, but Cruel Intentions II nevertheless has a certain charm that rises above it's overall mediocrity. Unburdened by the star-power of Sarah Michelle Geller and Ryan Phillipe who would have never gone for some of CI II's racier material, the writers were free to push the boundaries of the mean girl theme. Kathyrn Merteuil rules her private school via a secret society that decides who is popular and who is not. She uses raw sexuality and blackmails school officials to have her way. Sebastian Valmont, just as in the original, is her foil. The `cruel' twist at the end was very surprising and certainly hot. If you enjoy youth-driven night time soaps like Gossip Girl, One Tree Hill, and 90210, you'll definitely revel in Cruel Intentions II and mourn the weekly TV show that might have been.

What makes it hot: Kathryn is the conniving little thing we love to hate... or hate to love. She's pure evil, and we like seeing her win.

Memorable line: ""Worship works best on your knees...""

Does she get away with it? Yes, Kathryn's downfall doesn't happen until the events of the first Cruel Intentions movie. But don't worry. Kathryn's sexy evil cousin Cassidy Merteuil shows up in part 3.",1279929600,,1629,4.831541218637993
1368729,5,B00004XPPI,"""Cruel Intentions 2"" is filled with many of the same ingredients that made the original film a must-see: gorgeous actors, back-stabbing characters, lovely scenery, and a fun plot. All the characters from the ""mother film"" are being played by different actors in this prequel. The movie explores how Sebastian and Kathryn first met, became step-siblings, and how their cat and mouse game ends up nearly destroying each other. Sebastian is still a lady's man and Kathryn uses this to her advantage to destroy her step-brother. ""Cruel Intentions 2"" will never win accolades for being an Oscar worthing movie, but it's great fun and enjoyable. The DVD is a dual-layered disc that has the feature in both widescreen and full screen formats. There is not much in the way of bonuses, but talent files and bonus trailers from other films are included. Subtitles are in English, Chinese, Korean, and Thai. This film was followed by the even better ""Cruel Intentions 3"".",1252540800,,960,5.00625

1368741,3,B00004XPPI,"This movie is an alright prequel to the first movie; however, the pictures and designs are amateurish.

1368742,4,B00004XPPI,"This prequel was a great little guilty pleasure. Although I wouldn't have minded seeing Sarah Thompson naked though. The movie is a prequel and explains why Sebsatin became the pimp that he did. Some great lines, a surprise ending all add to the fun. Just rent this movie or buy the DVD watch it with your girl or your boys and enjoy.",1207008000,,334,4.403225806451613
1368743,2,B00004XPPI,"Well, the only reason to watch this rather lackluster rmovie is that this was Amy Adams's first movie as the female lead, and she plays such a totally different character from almost all her other movie roles.  Adams is a star on the rise and has specialized in characters exuding genuine sweetness, charm, and earnestness with roles like Giselle in ""Enchanted"", Susan in ""Talledega Nights"",  Ashley in ""Junebug"" (for which she got an Oscar nomination), and the flamboozled Brenda Strong in ""Catch Me If You Can"".

Amy Adams does not particularly shine in this supposed prequel role here as Kathryn Merteuil, the same character played by Sarah Michelle Gellar in the original ""Cruel Intentions"".  Adams  has these big, round, intensely blue eyes,  a huge smile that breaks out easily, and such a soft, sweet voice that no matter how hard she tries, she just can't come across as being a dark and evil character.  Cold, snippy, stuck up, and in the midst of a menstrual cramp is about all that comes through here in this movie.

Sarah Michelle Gellar in the first Cruel Intentions did have this dark quality about her with the hint of pure evil that made her version of the character so much richer.

Robin Dunne, as the prequel Sebastian Valmont, also is much softer and nicer than Ryan Phillipe's version.

There isn't much to this movie, and the problem is the script, which doesn't know where to go with the characters.  Being a prequel, Kathryn and Sebastian presumably would be more innocent than later on.  And their parents would be in the picture also.  And that pretty much limits the plot of the movie.

There is the one obligatory gratuitous nude shower scene.  And the funniest part of the movie is the line about girls and horses.  That's about it.",1196380800,,1761,4.743421052631579
1368744,1,B00004XPPI,"It is absolutely cruel to have anyone endure watching this movie. It is the worst movie that I have ever seen. The ending was so disappointing that it will be hard for me to get excited about seeing another movie. It was filled with pointless nudity,profanity, sexual explotation, and there was no redeeming value in anyone in the movie. One is not a low enough rating for this movie. It was a waste of effort and money for those who had any attachment to it.

1368745,1,B00004XPPI,This movie is pretty odd and little mix-up parts but it's ALMOST the same as the first movie. I always like the first movie better than this one. I ordered this movie because of Keri Lynn Pratt and that I really loved the first one and I was hoping this movie would be great one but it's not. I still have this movie but I hardly watch this movie because my boyfriend really love this movie so I don't bother sell it. Our things is ours so.

You can see why it's direct to video. i understand the characters are the same because it is a prequel. But the dialog and plot were virtually the same.

1368776,2,B00004XPPI,"This movie ends with so many loose ends, it might as well be a plate of spaghetti. The 'surprise' ending with the threesome, and then the limo sex with the ritx ditz was just unbearable. COuld any girl be as naive as the $850 million dollar freshman? She hiccups, launches gum across a room, drinks two Long Island ice teas, then throws up at the thought of a boys tongue in her mouth.
I remember the girl who played Kathryn from 'Drop Dead Gorgeous', though she can act, her carrer is not gathering much steam. She plays her part well and it's nice to see bad guys (or girls) win once in awhile, but this movie left me with a feeling of 'who cares'?
The only real chuckle I got was the facalty member who won't help Kathryn, but is more than willing to help the boy coming up behind her. That and the poker game with the servants and the after math.

We don't need to know how Sebastian became what he was in the first one. (Confused yet?) The first one explains perfectly well, and this was basically just to cash in. It was actually a TV series to begin with, but Fox cancelled it after seeing Cherie being a naughty girl on a horse. There was really no point in releasing it on DVD, making stupid people like me thinking were getting something good out of it. And it even uses some of the same lines as the first one! ""Massage the tongue"" sound familiar to anyone?! The whole kissing scene between Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma Blair in the first one. A couple of the lines are repeated from the first, and for no apparent reason, two girls are shown in the shower topless. Just to ""entice"" Sebastian. Just an excuse for guys to see it obviously.

Thankfully all so called political correctness goes flying out the window and no where in sight for this movie. There is too much political correctness being forced upon us. It is very 80s. Take the shower scene all i will say is double your pleasure. For anyone who thought the shower scene in Porkys was hot. You ain't seen nothing til you seen this shower scene. Only problem i have is NO EXTRAS such as NO Featuretes of any kind..
  Now to the main reason behind this movie. THE GIRLS.ALL are the HOTTEST SchOOlgirlS you have ever seen in a movie..And nice coz all of the actresses are really in their 20s and near round 30 but can easily pass as teenagers..Which is good for those of us that are older then 18..Coz we can get HOT watching them and not feel guilty..A Guilty Pleasure INdeed..And when it comes to one of the schOOlgirls named Cherie (we call her ""Cherry"":) Clayman..Wonderfully Innocentally Flirtfully Played by Actress Keri Lynn Pratt...I challage any red blooded straight guy to watch this and not get HOT watching her..She is sooo HOT that i find it Very Hard to stay withIN the amazon.com review guidelines but i respect them so i control myself here. But take my word for it she is my fantasy and totally HOT and steals every scene that she is in. Not only is she sexy but she is hilarious..Wish see more of her in this movie and in other projects..When you see this movie you will know what i mean by saying i never wished i was a horse but now i do..And the ending scene in the back of limo did this actor get paid for this?? I would have done it FOR FREE..Hint Hint Hint..Song ""Good Morning Little SchOOlgirl"" comes to my mind when i think of and see Her. Ok with that i think i stayed in the guidelines good enough but believe me it was HARD..LoL..Get this movie & enjoy it..Also check out at amazon.com you can also buy a set with both movies..Buy it that way if you don't already have one..(BuFFy SarahMichelle is in the first one:) And enjoy the HOTTEST Little SchOOlgirls that any guy would freaking die for..Every man's fantasy..But remember ""Cherry/Cherry"" is MINE MINE MINE!!!!!!

1368793,5,B00004XPPI,"Cruel Intentions 2: Manchester Prep's origin is a bit weird, like a singer who becomes a soap star, CI2 was a television show that became a movie - albeit a straight to video movie.  Originally this film was meant to be a two episode pilot for a show to be called `Manchester Prep'.  This helps explain the quirky nature of the picture, its poor production values, miscasting, plot inconstancies, underdeveloped characters and the unshakeable feeling that about 20 scriptwriters worked on the film. I am amazed the same guy; Roger Kumble, wrote and directed CI2 as well as the original.  Despite its many many faults, if you can sit out the first third of CI2 (where it takes itself very seriously) the second two `acts' are well worth it.  After watching about 40 minuets of what I though to be utter rubbish and deeply regretting the [money amount]I spent hiring this movie, I was just about to give up on CI2 but fortunately I stuck it out and it suddenly got very very funny.  Then it got very very cool with a great twist and more lesbian kissing.  It would be very easy to write this movie off as being crap but I can't help but feel that there is an uncredited scriptwriter out there who knows far more than they are telling and turned this very ordinary film into a masterpiece by having their way with the plot while the directors back was turned.",1060905600,3,1356,4.514285714285714
1368794,4,B00004XPPI,"Troubled boy, Sebastian, plays troublesome pranks that end with more finality than he seemingly bargained for; placing him in ""hot"" water while making this reviewer laugh. Troubled boy then goes to stay with father who is living with rich wife and  the focla point; rich daughter, Kathryn, who has it and accordingly is it ""all."" Head of the class in popularity, dancing the ditches of demise in seething, she seems bent on making or breaking anyone she chooses.
And that seems fine to troubled boy at first, because the new life, it seems like the promise land. Herein, troubled boy is smart enough to try and begin anew, placing everything that he has done on the blank slate called ""bribery"" and forging himself a new ""he."" The only ""snag"" with that is the fact that he thinks that he and Kathryn should find out who is the master of the house. He thinks he should teach her a lesson that she perhaps knows, one on domination, and thus a duel begins.
And the game, o the game, that's what its all about.
While I can agree with the critics in some ways and say that this movie wasn't original and that it wasn't like the first Cruel Intentions, I do disagree with them regarding how the movie was played out. The reason I say that is because the punchline to the build of everything, the breaking of the shell that was once called dignity in the playground of souls, it is done well.
Cruelty, that is the name of the game and, honestly, these people know how to play.
From the very beginning, the viewer is thrust into a world where things aren't exactly as they seem. Multiple players are playing games on multiple levels, some not really knowing they are players in the process at all, and nothing is sacred. And the way they go to extremes to destroy one another, all for a little spite, it places a warm spot in a heart that paid money to see some damage being done.
Regardless of proposed ""intentions"" by watchers, this movie wasn't geared to teach me a lesson on good triumphing over the vile plots of some manipulative soul, nor was it supposedly going to showcase an arena in which the outcome has already been decided. No, the ending of the movie, by those standards, would leave many people sitting at home and questioning why. And, honestly, that's why I thought it was worth watching. The ""scripting"" of something that happens at the ending, it doesn't produce the same drab results that make everyone wonder why the game was played in the first place. Instead, the bottle produces a little bit of wickedly-spawned lightning, and that is always good for the wandering soul.
Perhaps the production ""value"" has decreased and perhaps there is more of the seemingly unlovable aspects that R-rated moviegoers seem to imply that they don't want to see - a girl being driven to the big ""O"" in public by being duped into thinking that the proper way to ride a horse is more stimulating than it should be and (gasp) nudity - but these things happen in the big kid's ballpark. Frankly, its part of the game being played and it makes everything more manipulative - not to mention more meriting in the ratings category. In fact, that's why, in some ways, some of the games had an evil chuckle behind them because, again, nothing is sacred.

The sequel is a total rip-off from the first movie with obvious changes. Instead of playing the doctor's daughter at the beginning, Sebastian played his old principal's wife. And then Sebastian falls for the Headmaster's daughter like in CI. The actors they took to re-enact the characters don't compare at all. It's a shame when you think of the excellent job Sarah Michelle and Ryan Phillippe did. There's no plot to this story, too many swear words and too much nudity and just bad dialogue and bad... everything.

This movie featured bad acting the plot was a cheap imitation that didn't make sense and the shower scene and the scene with the horse was unnesesairy and innapropriate.

Cruel Intentions 2: Manchester Prep seems like a cheapened form of Cruel Intentions.  The first was classy, bold, and stylish.  The second was crass, obnoxious and just bad.
Sebastian seems a little more sympathetic in this version (we actually get to see the parents).  He is just a very smart kid with a promiscuous father.  He is not the cultured snob of Cruel Intentions.  His step-sister Kathryn is now a spoiled brat who seems somewhat of a klutz at trying to be cultured.  This is definitely a step down from Gellar's Privileged B-tch of the first movie.
The film is full of the swearing and nudity that were nicely absent from the first.  One can feel that nudity and swearing were the main reason for this film being made.  The idea that it was to kick off a Manchester Prep series would be disappointing as the movies ideas would not translate to the more restricted television format (although the original CI might have made it).

When I saw the the faces of the new cast I was definitely not renting it. Then i was flipping channels one night when i just left it on. Those actors and actresses looked soooo young! Wow !amy adams had a tough act to follow, but i thought she did very well. robin dunne did not look the part and did not play the part well. the movie was very erotic. Maybe it was even sick. But the fact that the people looked so young with all that stuff in there made it interesting for me (not something you would see everyday).

1368814,1,B00004XPPI,"The central mistake of this movie lies in attempting to imitate the original Cruel Intentions production: attempting being the key word. Indeed, everything that made Cruel Intentions an enjoyable viewing experience is lacking in this poorly made and somewhat pointless prequel.
First, there is no real plot: the `story' merely drifts from one scene to the next with no sense of purpose or direction.
Second, the characters are unconvincing and shallow: the first Cruel Intentions set high standards in terms of acting and succeeded in producing extreme, but broadly convincing, personas in the form of Sebastian and Katherine; this prequel in no way reflects those standards.
Third, the art of the original Cruel Intentions was to mix a heady combination of sexual innuendo, power lust and downright nastiness into a more complex and intricate storyline: in other words, although the movie was somewhat racy, there was a point to every scene and action. Cruel Intentions 2 could not be further from this: graphic scenes and smutty jokes are there to serve as just that - graphic scenes and smutty jokes. The result is a rather immature, and quite unfunny, production that comes across as insipid and, at most times, rather boring.
In conclusion, even as a stand alone movie Cruel Intentions 2 would be weak; however, when compared to the original it isn't worth even the most cursory of glances.",1042416000,6,1395,5.069565217391304

I thought I'd give it a shot as my friend had only just told me that it ws the best movie ever (I think he watched it for the girls though). I moderatly enjoyed the first one andI didn't expect much other than the average below grade teen flick but what I got was a suprise in my opinion. Sure it had it's crude elements and some scenes had completly no relevance but over all I though this movie had more sophistication than most other movie of it's genre it was willing to experiment with dialogue that would have literaly no effect on the teenage audience some classic examples are the ""Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde debate"" and the line ""What is this Ben-Hur, do they beat you here"". I feel that this moved in into a watchable movie terrioty and the write-director certainly deserves credit for what he trys to accomplish with this picture.
As for the ""horrible acting"" yes most of it was below average but I felt that Robin Dunne did a fairly good job in the role of Sebastian. His facial acting was great and the way that he said some of the dialogue had smiles cross my face. The servants were potrayed in greatly steriotypical ways but I thought that was pretty classy too.
Don't get me wrong I am not one of those film reviews who dismisses great films like Schindlers List and Midnight Cowboy as garbage and only watches movies like this, I feel that I have seen enough movies in my time be be able to give accurate reviews on my thoughts about them.

Now the bottom line of this movie is to use some *cheesy* nudity and some quotes right out of the first one (Cruel Intentions). Cruel Intentions was a genius i workship that movie i loved Katherine Mourtiel (Mer-Toy). This movie does not even show you the character of Katherine rather it ruins it. The lines use such as ""the premiere...of Manchester Prep"" used before in the first one. The movie (no kidding you) reminded me of a soft-porn mixed with a parody of Cruel Intentions. OMG the worst thing I found about the movie is the actual ""Manchester Tribunal"" and the cheesy line which were actually taken right from the first one. Another thing that could just bother the heck out of you is the fact that the movie is not accurate! Sebastian is forcasted in the story to always have known Katherine and then finally move in with her. Sebastian ((Robert Dunne)) played his character to the fullest of this cheesy movie that no wonder was a direct to video release. Ok the ending was the worst I have ever seen, the worst. (sighs) the movie was so inaccurate and so cheesy it ruined the first one in a way. Poor Katherine and Sebastian, it's like watching a fake movie on your life.

The acting doesn't even live up to the B-rate movie it is, and the script sounds like the writers found it at the bottom of the original Cruel Intentions set's wastebasket; the prequel even rips off even some of the same lines and tries to pass them off as original! The story is basically non-existent, and the main character Robin Dunne is especially insipid as a carbon copy of Sebastien without the emotion.
The other characters are just as meaningless and leave you with a sick feeling of regret that they didn't take the time to fully understand and appreciate the characters they were supposed to play. And the supposed 'twist'?! Are you supposed to be left feeling anything but happiness that the film is finally over?

My point is, this movie relieves feelings of lose and regrets because of the exposed intricacies and stratagem used by the characters in this movie. It's narcistic, funny and cruel but very sweet too. Most of all, it brings forth the message that before we can love others, we must first learn to love ourself.",1009843200,,635,4.72972972972973
1368834,4,B00004XPPI,"I just saw this movie the next night after I saw the original one. Now I was not expecting it to be on the same caliber as the first but it really was good. True like other reviews said, Amy Adams who plays Katharine is not very attractive but she handles the part ok. Also you really are not watching part 2 of this film. What you are really watching is how part one really started. How Sebastian became part of the family. And you learn where he got his diary also and why he uses it for his said purposes. I loved the first one alot, and to be honest I liked this one to. Now true this went straight to video but then again considering the budget that is not a problem anyways. You also learn why Sebastian acts the way he does towards girls, and who he gets it from also, let me just say it does not run far from his real family. The other characters in the movie are great. Danielle who is the school virgin and the head masters daughter is really a great actress and performed beautifully. You really fall for her in this movie. But that's all I am going to say about her for I do not want to ruin the end of this move. Yes as other people have said they do use some of the same lines from the first movie, But HELLO, remember this is suppose to be happening before the first movie. So those who gripe about that really do not understand this movie at all. This is without a doubt a good rental indeed. And for that matter its not a bad buy either depending on the price you can get. And for those guys wondering what they show as far as sexual scenes. Well that's a disappointment. The only thing is there is a shower scene with to girls who are cousins and they kiss for about 2 seconds other then that they just talk in the shower and you see them from the waist up. That is it for the nudity. And thank god this time we don't have to see Sebastian's but in this flick. The movie was well shot; the colors are very sharp and crisp. And the sound is excellent. This movie makes excellent use of the 5.1 Dolby digital soundtrack. There is so great use of the surrounds in this movie. Another issue with this movie is that for the amount of money that was spent on this movie you really would believe that it could have been in a theater. And also you have to talk about realism. In the first one every one you deal with has money and privilege, in the second you have a main character who does not have all that money and is not part of the ""click"" and that adds depth to the movie which you do not see in the first one. Also the second one here really is more believable also. The first one takes a little believing. And there are to many things in the first one that should have happened but did not. I mean look at the deleted scene on the first one. Sebastian should have hit Katherine but you don't see that in the real release but he does hit her in the deleted scene. And that makes sense after what she puts him through. Also remember she tells Ron that he hit her, and when you watch that you are thinking you did not see that. Also in the second one you learn much more about the characters. And Of course there is the Cecil character the second one, I for get her name but she is stupid and says retarded things, but they are much more believable then in the first one. Selma says things that no one her age would say in the first one so it loses it credibility. Now I am not saying that the second one is better than the first but believe me its not that far off. For example if you have scene a Broadway show, with the original cast and you like it, then you see the touring version, of course its not exactly the same but the over all feel is still good. I really hope every one give this movie a chance it's really not that bad at all. I was not bored at all, and actually sat through the whole thing with out pausing it at all. Also the one is much more wicked than the first one. People actually say what you think they are going to say also. Think of this part 2 as the behind the music of the first one where you really learn about the characters and why they are the way they are. And you also find out where and why everyone has money too. Over all this is worth a buy and a rental. (...) And I was really surprised at how good this movie was. So give it a chance.

I'd also like to mention that at the end of the movie, which I saw on DVD, I took the time to actually view the trailers.  The one for the CRUEL INTENTIONS 2 showed many scenes that weren't in the movie.

1368849,1,B00004XPPI,"This is definitely among the top two or three worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Like some of my fellow reviewers, I really enjoyed the first *Cruel Intentions* and was hoping for something at least somewhat comparable to it in the sequel. This was *not* the case. I admit that I should probably have been clued-in by the cheesy and trashy cover art on the video sleeve, but what can I say--I was still hopeful.
Overall, the acting was awful. Robin Dunne and Mimi Rogers were actually the best of the bunch, despite his complete lack of both physical and character resemblance to the first Sebastian and her soap-opera-esque interpretation of Tiffany Merteuil-Valmont. Amy Adams was *terrible* as a childish Kathryn Merteuil, her only apparently redeeming quality seeming to be a very slight facial resemblance to Sarah Michelle Gellar. Otherwise, one moment she's brilliant, evil, and talented; the next moment, she's stupid, self-conscious, and clumsy--*completely* at odds with the original.
Most films (even the darker ones) have at least some comic relief. The first *Cruel Intentions* was no exception with its occasional quip, the scene in the retirment home, and the childish, dopey character Cecile Caldwell. What, however, was up with the ridiculous attempts at humor in this one? I could have used a *lot* less of the stupid wordplay, the foul-mouthed elderly woman on the sidewalk outside the Merteuil-Valmont home, and--most of all--the incredibly offensive and seemingly *endless* parade of ethnic stereotypes among the Merteuil-Valmont servants. Did I miss something? When did mocking people's cultural heritage become funny again?
Finally, it was rather annoying to watch a sequel that does little other than repeat situations and phrases from the first one. The opening scene of *2* was a *complete* rip-off of the first one, as was Kathryn's ""befriending"" of classmate Cherie. Outside of those two instances, the movie kept popping up with quotes from the original (""Keep your friends close and your enemies closer,"" ""It's a pity you're not [cute],"" etc.). Can't we move on and be original?
I can think of little else to say about this movie. In its meagre defense, I did rather like the ""twist"" at the end (obvious as it was), the fact that they kept the main theme, and the use of the same house. These three things combined, however, still can't bring my rating for this terrible movie higher than a single star. Maybe someone will (hopefully?) make a great *Cruel Intentions 3* that effectively erases this terrible first sequel from the public consciousness.",992217600,6,2588,5.091764705882353
1368850,2,B00004XPPI,"Roger Kumble had a good idea.  Before it came out, I often wished for a prequel to the original CI.  Unfortunately, this film doesn't do justice to the original, which is disappointing because it could have been extremely good. The characters include Kathryn and Sebastian, as well as two ""new"" characters who seem to be patterned after Annette and Cecile.  Danielle, the ""Annette"" character starts out all right, but as the film goes on, she becomes too earnest and innocent to be believed.  Sherry, the ""Cecile"" character is even more clueless than Cecile (if that's possible) but she lacks the amusing charm of Cecile.  She comes across as annoying.  As for Sebastian and Kathryn, they act extremely out of character from the originals.  The characters' dialogue wants to be as sharp and witty as the original, but fails in many ways.  Unfortunately, the director/writer tried to fix that by paraphrasing several of the lines from the original and even inserting a few verbatim (""This doesn't *taste* like iced tea.""  ""It's from Long Island."") (""You could be a model.  It's too bad you aren't sexy.""  ""I could be sexy!""  ""All right, show me sexy."").  They even tried to recreate the infamous kissing scene, only it involved Court (who's mentioned in the original but never seen) and Sherry with Kathryn doing the coaching.  Kathryn and Sebastian have virtually no chemistry in this film.  Also, one who is familiar with the original may have a hard time believing that Sebastian wasn't wealthy before coming to live with his father and step-mother.  There are a few amusing points in the film, including Sebastian's first dinner ""alone"" and a poker game involving the servants, but otherwise the movie just doesn't stand up to the first one.  Overall, this movie is moderately effective as a lead-in to the first one.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing it, but fans of the original CI may want to rent it out of curiosity.  If you've never watched the first Cruel Intentions (starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon), then I highly recommend watching it *before* this one.",991526400,,2102,4.97134670487106

This movie takes the steamy, exotic scenes to a whole new level. Although the original Cruel Intentions did revolve around sex there were lines they did not cross. Cruel Intentions to not only crossed them, but they ran. It provides cheaps laughs and fan service involving two twins in the shower and a young girls first horse-riding lesson turning into anything but pure.

My only problem with it was the lame jokes (plenty abound)and recycled plot lines and jokes (""this sure dosent taste like a iced tea"", ""Its from long island"")  Coming from the same team except for the actors, Who incedently aren't that bad, its just the material they have to work with, I expected a little better.  Some of it was interesting but overall not a very good prequel.  And they show like 20 scenes in the preview that aren't even in the movie, including those scenes might have made the movie more interesting and a little longer that 87 min.",984960000,2,648,4.428571428571429
1368874,1,B00004XPPI,"CRUEL INTENTIONS is my all time favorite film.  I have memorized every line from that movie and still watch it on a regular basis.  I had heard about MANCHESTER PREP, the TV series based on the movie that got axed before it even aired, and just expected it to go away without a fuss.  Then I heard about CRUEL INTENTIONS 2 and upon further investigation learned that it was the TV series made into a movie.  I rented it, not expecting much, because not ONE person from the original was returning and the cover looked really corny.  I put it in, and in the first five minutes I felt cheated.  It was basically the beginning of CRUEL INTENTIONS set in a principles office with actors no one knows.  This seemed to be the underlying theme of this movie, because every five minutes some character would half heartedly spout out a line that we all heard in the original.  The story line is EXACTLY the same (devirginizing the naive one, and falling in love with the headmasters daughter-sound familiar?) as the CRUEL INTENTIONS plot.  What makes me even madder is, despite the fact they tried to tie in this movie with its precedor, it made no sense when compared.  These were two movies with the same story line that couldn't be less connected if they had two different titles.  Besides making no sense compared to the original, it also makes no sense compared in itself.  The ending for example, was just the writer trying to introduce the element of suprise when really he ended up butchering everything.  It made no sense.  I wouldnt recommend this to the people who starred in it.  They should be ashamed that they bring such shame to the orignal.  And whats most suprising it was written by the same guy.  The acting was bad, as was the chemistry between the actors, the script was worse, and it didn't work in with the orignal.  Stay away from this.  If you want to be seduced (see tagline for the film) then go watch a porno flick because thats basically all this is minus any originality or sense.",984787200,5,2001,4.523676880222841
1368875,1,B00004XPPI,"Being a big fan of the original Cruel Intentions, I was quite curious when I'd heard there would be a prequel. I'd heard it was to explore Kathryn and Sebastian's early relationship, and was very much intrigued. I didn't think it was going to be quite as good as the first, but I thought it ought to be worth two hours time at any rate. In short, my time would have been better spent hitting myself repeatedly in the head with a brick. The original is an extremely well-written, beautifully acted adaptation of the classic novel and movie(s) ""Dangerous Liasons""(If you haven't seen the film starring John Malkovich and Glenn Close, I highly reccomend it...and for those of you who like that sort of thing, Keanu Reeves is in it, too.). I've seen it several times, and have enjoyed it more with subsequent viewings. Its prequel is everything the original is not. Apart from being improperly titled (a prequel should not contain a ""part 2""...Since it is supposed to occur before the first part) It is poorly acted and horribly written, playing on some of the more clever lines from the original and butchering them to fit some pointless re-hash (pre-hash?). The actor playing Sebastian Valmont, while not nearly as good as Ryan Phillippe, may have some potential, if he can get over his James Van Der Beek phase, but other than that, the movie is absolutely devoid of talent. The only amusing character in the film is it's equivalent of Cecile Caldwell, an amazingly vapid young woman named Sherrie, though she has none of the innocent charm of Selma Blair (the actress who played Cecile in the original). In fact, the amusement comes only from watching her bumble her way across the screen. The biggest shock came when the credits rolled, as I learned the writer/director of this absolute travesty of a film was Roger Kumble, the same man who did just a wonderful job on the original. It just goes to show what people will do for the right amount of money. Do yourself a favor, if you enjoyed the original, buy Cruel Intentions 2 if only to set it on fire. That's what I'm planning on doing.",984614400,3,2090,4.651351351351352
1368876,4,B00004XPPI,Now I liked the first one better but this one still was well acted and very interesting. Although I think it would have done good on tv I think it was very good and kept your attention with great dialouge and wity talent. I reccomend this movie.,984614400,,245,4.23404255319149
1368877,3,B00004XPPI,"Cruel Intentions 2 is not real bad. The acting isn't ultimately superb, but it fairs well. As all know by now, CI2 was originally the planned FOX tv show, Manchester Prep, which was spun off from Cruel Intentions. When FOX saw how risky the content was, they decided to not add it to their fall line-up in '99, or any other line-up beyond that. I, myself, was very dissapointed as Cruel Intentions is my top favorite movie of all time. CI2 is basically about how Sebastian Valmont really got into ruining people's lives, a quest that was set by his ""psycho stepsister"" Kathryn Mertieul. I must say that Amy Adams did a good job portraying Kathryn, but nobody will ever beat Sarah Michelle Gellar at the role. Also, Keri Lynn Platt who plays Cherie did her character and very good was the most hilarious person. CI2 is also a bit more toned up than the original, as in there's more of the nudity business . . . and the grabbing business. But it all fits into the plot, which was also great. All in all, CI2 is a fair sequel, and will undoubtedly do well on video and DVD.",984528000,,1070,4.381909547738694
1368878,1,B00004XPPI,"The first ""Cruel Intentions"" was was nasty, slightly campy, good fun.  It was well-made, and well-acted.  Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillipe, Reese Witherspoon, and (especially) Selma Blair knew EXACTLY how to handle the material.  It's a funny, and kinky, guilty pleasure.
None of the above is true of the prequel, ""Cruel Intentions 2.""  This is a LAME rehash of the original elements.  The cast (none of whom return from the first film) are unremittingly bland.  The story basically shows how Sebastian became corrupted and ended up like he was in the original film.  The highlight of the film involves twin sisters in a shower.  Most guys will probably find it the highlight.
One final note: the only 'special features' are a couple filmographies and the film's trailer.  Interestingly, about half the shots in the trailer are from scenes that didn't make the final cut.  Weird that the producers decided not to include any deleted scenes on the DVD...at least it would've increased the value somewhat of an otherwise virtually useless disc.",984441600,,1046,5.064327485380117
1368879,3,B00004XPPI,"Now, I liked the first CRUEL INTENTIONS starring Sarah Michelle Gellar (it was entertaining in a sick, twisted kind of way, and the production values were great), but I didn't even know they made a sequel until I saw this on cable! Well, after watching it, now I know why I've heard nothing about it. This was apparently supposed to be a television series called ""Manchester Prep"", but it's clear why it was rejected -- the subject matter is just too risque. There's more gratuitous nudity and sexual innuendo in Cruel Intentions 2 than in the original film.
This movie stunk worse than a New York subway car in August without any air conditioning. You thought the lesbian kiss scene in the first movie was a little over the top? Man, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Cruel Intentions 2 is really nothing but a soft-porn B-movie. The first movie was a ""modern retelling"" of the ""classic"" story Dangerous Liaisons. Cruel Intentions 2 is a ""prequel"" that leaves almost no taboo unexplored. Since this is a ""family"" site, I will not go into any graphic detail here. Suffice it to say that virgin eyes should not behold what transpires in this movie (Scenes like an innocent freshman girl getting aroused while learning to ride a horse, twins in a shower, Valmont's stepmother giving him a massage...you get the idea).
Anyway, consider this a public service announcement: beware if you turn on your tv and are flipping through the cable channels and you come across a little movie called CRUEL INTENTIONS 2. Or if you see this on your videostore shelf. Or if you were thinking of buying this film. The production values and the acting and the story are nowhere near as good as the original.
