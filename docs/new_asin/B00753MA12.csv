5055331,5,B00753MA12,Nice to see what Tom Berenger is doing these days.  This is a good thriller and we are happy to have it.  We waited months for it to be released and we are not at all disappointed.,1379721600,,180,3.8378378378378377
5055332,1,B00753MA12,"Well I was actually enjoying until they had to show a bunch of nudity. We could have gotten the idea without that. Lame.
A spin on the old saying... Those who can't.... watch.",1375056000,3,175,4.333333333333333
5055333,3,B00753MA12,"The movie was ok, far from being a blockbuster.  Based on a true story, I didn't expect much. I bought this movie because it was the first movie in which my grandaughter had a speaking part. She was so young & cute in the movie, but overall I found the acting stiff & unconvincing. The plot was boring, also. Should have been a TV movie.",1366329600,,337,4.184615384615385
5055334,4,B00753MA12,"This a movie that you watch when you need to relax but still multitask. The acting is mediocre. The story is the classic tale of family greed and murder with an all star cast. The widow (Tatum O'Neal)framed for the murder of her husband of six months(Tom Berenger)by his brothers, and the judge (Peter Coyote)who is on the take and presides over the legality of the will. James Brolin portrays Joshua Sloan the detective assigned to the murder investigation and who in the end saves the day.",1362096000,,491,4.655172413793103
5055335,2,B00753MA12,"In the battle of adult actresses Tatum O'Neal vs. Jodie Foster, Tatum throws herself under the bus with this performance. The movie opens with a death and then goes back six months earlier. Hayden (Tatum) marries into the wealthy Emery family who own Kansas City real estate. The wedding was very pretentious and the acting reminded me of porn star quality. Frank Emery (Tom Berenger) is a surgeon. His brothers manage the real estate which Frank owns.

Hayden discovers they are evil slum lords and wants to change it. She convinces Frank, who fires his brothers and the next thing you know Frank is dead, with a new will cutting out Hayden, and Hayden is framed for his death.

That is the bare bones plot. The court room scenes are laughable as Hayden takes the stand and is grilled by Moon Unit Zappa dressed all in black, apparently a stipulation in her contract. The movie reminded me of a soap opera series, with trite dialogue and cutout characters. The occasional jazz soundtrack didn't seem to fit the film.

The plot wasn't that bad, it was just executed so badly it makes it unbearable to watch. Alan Moskowitz, who writes for TV series was the script writer. Actor/writer/director Brent Huff directed this mess. He is still best known for his role in ""The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik Yak.""

Parental Guide: No sex. No f-bombs that I recall, although I did a lot of fast forwarding. Uncredited distant stripper nudity. 1 1/2 stars",1355529600,28,1458,4.68359375
5055336,1,B00753MA12,"Tom Berenger. James Brolin. Peter Coyote. They must have done it just for the money. It may have been based on a true story but this is absolutely the worst written, worst directed, and sad to say worst acted movie I have seen in a long time. And Tatum O'Neal needs a high school drama class. I wasted my money, don't waste yours.",1348444800,2,330,4.253968253968254

5055356,1,B00753MA12,"Tried but couldn't get thru it. The sound quality was terrible. The brothers female attorney sounded like an elephant in high heels. so much echo.  Tatum O'neil was 50 when she was cast as a young and beautiful possible gold digger .

5055360,1,B00753MA12,Absolutely horrible. I guess they spent so much money on big name actors they couldn't afford a competent director or writer. Dialogue was very amateurish. The guy who wrote the review about reminding him of early soaps was dead on.,1506211200,,232,4.825

5055362,1,B00753MA12,Good grief.  Not sure what was worse.  The acting was beyond bad for veteran actors.  The script was horrible.  The sound and music was nearly as bad as the acting....Beringer and Oniel need to never try acting again....,1505174400,,220,4.7105263157894735
5055363,2,B00753MA12,"BAHAHAHA.  Berenger is just a terrible actor.  Always.  Tatum was good as a child but too ""forced"".  This movie reminded me of the early(very early) soap operas on TV.  The early All My Children or even Dark Shadows (for those who remember).  And the section where Tatum's character ""remembers"" what seemed like five days of marriage????  The music was horrible.  Again, late 70s, early 80s TV sequel type music.  Just terrible.  I was being generous with the 2 stars.  Trust ME",1505088000,,478,4.777777777777778

5055377,4,B00753MA12,"I am surprised that this only rated a 3 star (average).  I enjoyed this movie and the story was well written, with exception of a few points of the plot; but what movie doesn't have that.  Surprisingly, T. O'Neil was good in this film - I had my doubts, but she pulled through.  surprise ending, for me.",1495065600,,303,4.280701754385965
5055378,3,B00753MA12,"Kind of an interesting plot, marred by a cheesy script and stupid dialogue. If this movie did not have Tom Berenger and James Brolin in it I would never have watched it. Although the director could probably take some lessons from the students in a half way decent graduate film program the pros stood out (like Peter Coyote, Berenger and Brolin) and gave solid performances as usual. In all fairness to Tatum O' Neal (who was miscast as a young naive trophy wife) it's really hard for your face to display emotion when you have that much Botox in it, but she looked pulled together and had some moments during the last half of the film. This is a LifeTime Channel made for TV movie. I'm not saying you have to lower your standards to enjoy it, but it might help.",1490400000,4,762,4.411347517730497

Poor Tom Berenger. He is still handsome, but not even he could rescue this sorry excuse for a movie. The characters were so laughable that you just didn't care that Tatum O'Neal was framed for her husband's murder and definitely didn't believe that her character would try to be a savior to all the poor minorities living in the run-down buildings that her husband's family owned and managed in the city.

I give the movie 5 stars because of the suspenseful detective plot the producer introduces into the movie. And overall the movie is 5 stars but if you don't stick it out and really watch it then you may give up on the movie after the first 20 minutes. I'm not going to lie, I fast-forwarded past the first 10 minutes of the movie but I decided to give it a chance and I'm glad I did.

5055635,2,B00753MA12,"Here is how this movie got made (or so I told myself when the movie had ended).

Two ambitious eighth-graders wrote a script for English.  It earned a well-deserved A for them, because it was graded according to eighth grade standards.  Then they sent it to Hollywood, where they experienced the miracle of their lives, because it was purchased, and several thousand dollars were budgeted for it.

These writers had watched just about every re-run of ""Dragnet"" and were enamored of its minimalist style.  Their effort to copy that style explains the many choppy scenes in the movie.  So minimal were they in plot development that the audience was given no background to understand the character of the wife.  What, for example, made this person of stone-cold warmth suddenly get over-wrought in her concern about the poor?  Their approach likewise explained why the audience was given zero context regarding the basis for the brothers' degraded and implausible behaviors.  This tribute to Dragnet often resulted in lines written more for their (faint) effort to be clever or cryptic, than for their contributions to plot depth and continuity.

An eighth-grade buddy of the script writers lucked out with the job of casting.  Due to having had only eight-grade type romantic experiences, this director overlooked the notion of ""chemistry"" between the husband and wife characters.  Instead, the eighth-grader chose two actors that she liked, who (score!) would agree to work with the movie budget: Tatum O'Neal and Tom Berenger.  They unfortunately came across more like uncle and niece than newlyweds.  Nor was too terribly much discernment expressed in the casting of Berenger's two brothers.  They each appeared to have been born to completely different mothers and fathers.

Their eighth-grade friend with the most school play experience was tapped to direct.  Unfortunately for Tatum O'Neal, the director instructed her to conduct herself like a Stepford Wife.  This forced O'Neal to, for example, show the same expression on her face when she greeted her brand new husband, as she wore when accosted by a policeman after a funeral.  For reasons unknown, Berenger was often directed to pause excessively before delivering one of his lines, almost as though he had forgotten the line and was getting it told to him in an ear piece.  (But perhaps the movie length needed extending, and his pauses helped with that!)  Whenever the director was unsure about how to guide the characters, he'd say a bunch of different things, but they always boiled down to this: ""over act.""  The characters took this direction well.

For this director, the main goal seemed to be simply getting through the scenes, such that doing so scored a success.  Consequently, story development, compelling emotional content, and scene believability were throw-away considerations.  As for scene credibility (or the lack of it!), I could write a book. Instead, however, I'll mention only the scene that was so unrealistic it made me laugh out loud.  It was set at a private club where there was gambling, as well as prostitutes.  How the director told the hookers to move during those scenes was so awkward and stilted that I felt horrified (for the actors), but I was also entertained to the point of guffawing over the ludicrousness of it all.  In those short little scenes, if there was ever a peek into an eight-grader's view of prostitutes, it was there.  Prior to that section, I'd been suspicious that eighth graders were behind this movie effort, but when I saw how those scenes were directed, I knew that my hunch had been spot on.

Over-all, the director (being only in grade 8) is to be forgiven for not knowing that making the audience like the main characters, or at least be drawn to them, is integral to good movie-making.

Here is a picky footnote.  Early in the movie, Kansas City, the setting for this movie, gets described as one of the most beautiful cities around.  However, while the movie showed a a good variety of Kansas City scenes, including its skyline, it never did deliver to us what I would call Kansas City's ""beauty.""  So dear Kansas City loving movie makers: why write a line like that into a script and then not deliver it visually?",1421971200,6,4239,4.949080622347949

5055640,5,B00753MA12,"Let me just first say that I'm more than a little partial to the M.O.W./Lifetime True Crime Genre. Further, I'm more than happy that there are so many of them included free with the Amazon PRIME membership. While I'm a huge movie buff and certainly appreciate the value of a solid script, fine acting and quality production values, there is no denying that films are pure escapism. That said this film genre is very satisfying to me when I simply want to get comfortable and spend some time living other people's lives.

Last Will was a true surprise to me. I was thrilled to come to the end of it and feel that I enjoyed it so much that it prompted me to submit a review (something I rarely do).

For starters let me just get the weak parts of this production out of the way:
A few of the characters were incredibly flawed, beginning with James Brolin's hard boiled detective. At first, it's damn hard to understand, when he is already predisposed to hating the two sleazy Emery Brothers and, after a long history of dealing with the Emery family corruption in Kansas City; why is he so so adamant in focusing on the Tatum O'neal character as the prime suspect in her husband's murder? It's just so clear that he's off in the wrong direction, not to mention that they go out of the way to set up the bad blood between he and the two sleazy brothers. It just gets a bit confusing for a while.

Bear in mind, this is a true-crime script so I have no idea how faithful the production was in following the documented court transcripts and news stories from this case so, the few plot holes that develop from time-to-time can come from a variety of factors.

Those complaints aside this film has all of the qualities that I seek when indulging in the guilty pleasure of an M.O.W. The story unfolds with all of the proper tension of a good truer-crime movie. The dysfunctional wealthy family, the beautiful Kansas City locations, the expensive costumes and the beautiful, star-studded, cast offer all of the distraction that you could possibly need in two hours.

To top it all off, It was absolutely satisfying to see Tatum O'neal, Tom Berringer, James Brolin and Peter Coyote all attached to this project and still looking terrific. In particular, it's always satisfying to see that Tatum O'neal can still ""bring it"" (and look terrific) when she is provided with decent material.

Finally, nobody ads more to a project like this than casting Patric Muldoon in the role of the handsome, morally challenged, family narcissist! It's a role he was born to play and he does so to perfection...all the way to the moment that he takes a bullet to his forehead courtesy of Mr. Brolin's sharp shooting skills There is no better finally to two hours of debauchery and backstabbing than having the good guy win in the end!

Tatum O'Neill's acting reminded me of a soap opera. The story line deals with three brothers. One(Beringer) is a physician, whose father willed him about all the money. Then there are his two brothers, angry and bitter that they didn't get their fair share of the fortune. Tatum O'Neill plays Beringer's wife, who learns of the brothers' criminal activity.

5055691,3,B00753MA12,"This isn't the worst movie ever and its far from being the best ever too!
I rented this because it had Berenger, Coyote and Brolin in the cast and I had high hopes that it would be a good drama/thriller.
The story is about a woman (O'neal) who marries a wealthy and powerful man (Berenger) who's family is connected with everything in Kansas City. The new wife throws a wrench in the works of a new high rise condo complex that the other two brothers run. This action leads to changes in the will and O'neal will inherit everything leaving the two brothers penniless. That's the setup for the story before all heck breaks loose in a power play move.
 I was somewhat disappointed with the writing and the direction, but by far the worst part of this production was the acting with the worst of the worst award going to Tatum O'neal. I could not believe her performance especially in one scene when she gets angry stomps her foot and has a mini temper tantrum. The story was neither a good drama nor was it much of a thriller due to the acting, transparent plot and the less than stellar writing.
The movie had very little cursing, and very tame gore and violence, but did have a couple of scenes of topless women and a man having sex with a woman exposing her backside.
3 stars for this average drama and nothing more.",1399766400,9,1317,4.397540983606557
