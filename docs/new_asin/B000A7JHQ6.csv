2378403,3,B000A7JHQ6,"Unfortunately this is where Red Dwarf really started to lose it's stride. After the highs of season 5, season 6 looked like a blip, but compared to season 7 it was genius. Worth getting really only for completeness.",1138838400,,215,4.684210526315789
2378404,5,B000A7JHQ6,"What an odd and wonderful series Red Dwarf is. Many years ago I turned on PBS and saw this strange show for the first time. It was one of the very first episodes and after about 15 minutes I had to turn it off as I thought it was one of the stupidist shows I had ever seen.

Years later as I was channel surfing, I once again found myself watching Red Dwarf. This time it was somewhere in season 3 and I was enthralled. I couldn't get enough. Since then I have seen every episode and bought every video tape (including the 2 smeg ups videos). Even the first season was great once I had a handle on the whole story.

When series 7 came out, I wasn't very happy with the ""new"" look. The video grade was changed (more like cheap film) and Kryton's head seemed oddly (more oddly?) different.

There were other changes (mentioned in most other reviews) but in the end, I thought this was a very good season and I wanted MORE!

For me, season 8 was the best as everything was brilliantly made new and fresh and gave me many laugh out loud moments. I wish it wasn't over.

I am not as excited about the movie (just like Firefly) as I would prefer many tv episodes as opposed to 1 ""re-telling"" of the story. Still, I will be first in line at the theatre.

Lastly, if you have not seen this series and like Sci-Fi, and British comedy, RUN (don't walk) to your local media store and buy this series or catch it on your local PBS station (probably on Sundays).

I will (of course) purchase the DVDs when they come out as a complete collection.",1137974400,3,1532,4.208191126279863
2378405,4,B000A7JHQ6,"I won't bother defending series 7 against its detractors. It's my personal favorite, tied with series 1. I think the new format allows the actors room to breathe and grow. Especially Duct Soup which is the closest to drama the series will get. The show is hilarious all the way through, and looking beyond the infamous cliffhanger of Nanarchy (which brought the return of Holly!) there's not an episode that is less than brilliant.

Now, as for the DVD. For some reason they've decided to change things up a bit. The format of Disc 1-Show Disc 2-Features was apparently too restricting, so now they've split up the shows and made a 3-disc set. Disc 1 has Ep 1-3, along with the extended versions therein, and Disc 2 Ep 4-8. Why not 1-4, 5-8 I'll never know. I could care less about the extended episodes frankly. They special features, while interesting, are surprisingly sparse compared to the last few DVDs. Also, the episode by episode behind the scenes amounted to nothing but defending the series.

All in all it's fantastic though. Can't wait for series 8 so I can complete my collection. :)",1136851200,3,1097,4.708333333333333
2378406,5,B000A7JHQ6,"I didn't know anything about the background production of the show until I read all the reviews here. I only know from what I watched  when this series was released on PBS. What I noticed were the following:

More colorful sets

Much better special effects

A new female lead which really helps balance out the show

8 episodes instead of 6

The only negative was Chris Barrie (Rimmer) missing in a few episodes

So I really don't understand what these people are talking about how the show being drastically different. The show drastically changed during season 3 as well with the introduction of Kryten. And then did another change during season 4 when Red Dwarf was lost. I mean look at the Cat, he changed from a fish obsessed narcisist to an effective pilot of Starbug with a keen nose sensor. To me these changes kept the show upbeat with more variety. I absolutely love Seasons 7&8 and they're my favorite seasons because we now had the lead characters interacting with more than just a single new person per episode. The show has always changed drastically from season to season. Season 7&8 was no different. And I don't think it ever lost its magic.",1136678400,8,1158,4.647058823529412
2378407,4,B000A7JHQ6,"What with

1. Loss of writer

2. Loss of one major character

3. Effects and models problems

4. Not filming infront of a live audience

5. A 3 year gap between series

It was really inevitable that series would be different to what we are used to. As a comedy in its own right its good and very funny but as series 7 in red dwarf its not as good as whats gone before

Chloe annett as kochanski i did not mind but for me plot wise its obvious that she is far to uptight and posh a kochanski then compared to clare grogan. And i would jave thought lister would not like a person like that.

The extras are great with a fantastic read through by chris barrie of the lost episode identity within and a great making of which is worth the price alone.

In the end its still a funny series duct soup in my opinion being the stand out episode

Just do not buy this expecting it to surpase previous series",1134777600,8,897,4.074285714285714
2378408,5,B000A7JHQ6,"First I'd like to say that if you like the first six series, then you must watch the seventh and eighth series. I know a lot of people have written bad reviews about series seven(and eight) but I believe those people are the types that do not like change. Yes Chris kockanski is played by a new lady (Chloe Annett)and Chris Barrie leaves after the 2nd episode. Well not really leaves he is in an episode later on called Blue. Yes Kryten does get ""menstrating-woman"" syndrome. Yes Doug Naylor (writer) is not involved as much in the creative side of the show. However, laughs are still there! I will say that the first four seasons were more of a comedy based on sci-fi. While the later series are a Sci-fi based on comedy. The ""look"" of series 7 and 8 are far superior to the ""gray"" sets of series 1 and 2. I love this series! I love all the Red Dwarf series! Basically if you are casual fan I would give this a rating of 3 stars. Never seen it before I would give 3.5 stars. But if you know Krytens middle name or who Fionna Barrington is (warm composte series 5), 10 out of 5 stars is what I would rate this series(if for no other reason than 8 episodes instaed of 6!) Later smeg-heads!",1134604800,8,1188,4.237885462555066
2378409,1,B000A7JHQ6,"In case any of you are scratching your head at the above comment, let me explain. ""Jump The Shark"" is a phrase that describes the moment when a TV show loses its spark, when it becomes stale, unfunny or just plain boring. There are numerous well-known reasons for this happening (members of the cast leaving, new members being introduced in an attempt to bring new life to the show, writers leaving..) and amazingly, Red Dwarf managed all of these in the space between Season Six and Season Seven.

We've all seen TV shows go down the pan, but I don't think I've ever seen a show take such a drastic, no-holds barred drop in quality as Red Dwarf did here (and continued to in Season Eight). Make no bones about it - Red Dwarf was a GREAT TV show. Endlessly quotable, it gave us superb characters like the anal, self-important Rimmer, the slobby yet humane Lister, they evolved the Cat from a one dimeonsional James Brown spoof into a real character (and even gave him one of the best running ""Dwayne Dibley"" character gags), and, of course, added Kryten in Series Three who became the heart of the entire show.

And then, in the blink of an eye - Rimmer leaves, Kryten becomes whiney, irritating and almost the most loathsome character in the history of the show.

Ah yes - I said almost. Enter Christine Kochanski, supposed to be Rimmer's replacement, but where Chris Barrie is funny, Chloe Annett just isn't. Quickly scrubbing out the entire show's history (where we saw a different Kochanski - Clare Grogan, as sweet, sexy and someone who you could imagine someone like Lister falling in love with), she became spoilt, irritable and downright unlikeable. Plus, for six whole seasons we were told Lister had only ever spoken to Kochanski a handful of times, always being too shy to actually ask her out. But no, come this series they HAD dated. So basically forget everything else that had happened before that, then. Just another reason to shake your head at the downward spiral of this series.

The writing suffered too. Rob Grant left, leaving Doug Naylor and other hacks to ruin the fun. The live audience was binned too, giving us a hollow, totally obvious laughter track. And, believe it or not, it just got worse and worse.

Like I've said in other reviews, sometimes this is just no fun. To witness a once brilliant program turn into this sub-standard garbage was painful. And yet I re-visited old demons to review it just for YOU. You lot really lot don't deserve The Curmudgeon.

2378410,4,B000A7JHQ6,"The first time I watched series seven of Red Dwarf I found it terrible. The usual suspects - the laughter track, the lack of Rimmer, and the arrival of Christine Kochanski.

I bought the DVD only to complete the set (with number eight to come). However, on second viewing the series has its funny moments and the storylines seem fresher than series six (though this isn't as funnier). Despite the flaws, series seven is still better than most TV comedy on offer (as another reviewer stated). Christine Kochanski, played by Chloe Annett, does bring new life and helps fill the vaccuum left by Chris Barrie.

Red Dwarf's long run (eight series) is not only down to good comedy writing and performance, but also its adaptability to evolve - giving it a new lease of life now and again. I'm sure time will give a truer picture in how important this series is in relation to the others.

Apparently, according to reviews, series eight is truly terrible, but I haven't seen it so I cannot pass comment on it.

If you are a fan of Red Dwarf then you will probably be familiar with this series anyway. However, if you have just come across this excellent comedy, then I suggest trying the earlier series first to get the best of it.",1133568000,5,1224,4.55
2378411,4,B000A7JHQ6,"Red Dwarf Series VII is very different than any Red Dwarf to come before it. Rob Grant, half of the team that till then had created and written all Red Dwarf episodes, left the show and the strain on remaining writer Doug Naylor clearly shows. Some of the writing slack is taken up by others, including Robert Llewellyn (Kryten), who has written a few successful books on his own, but the feel of the show is never the same from here on out. The humor is now less dense and arguably less sharp at times, and the situations in which the characters find themselves often do not have the same comedic quality of the older shows. Additionally, Chloe Annett is introduced as Kochanski. While competent, she is far different than any of the actesses that originated the part like C.P. Grogan, and her addition to the cast takes time away from funnier established characters, like the Cat, who is brilliantly played by Danny John-Jules. To add to the list of unwanted changes, Chris Barrie was not fully available for this series and so is absent much of the time.

That said, if you love Red Dwarf, you'll probably feel obligated to own these later shows anyway. There are still occasional brilliant moments, and the cast is still funny and committed to their roles, even if the writing is now very uneven. Series VII is better than Series VIII, which takes Red Dwarf even further away from it's original comedic fundamentals.

As in Series VI, in Series VII the crew are still living aboard Starbug and still chasing the trail of their larger mother ship, the Red Dwarf. Episodes in Series VII are:

1. Tikka To Ride

Lister ignores Kryten's warnings about the hazards of time travel and takes the crew on a quest for more curry that will change history.

2. Stoke Me A Clipper

Ace Rimmer returns to Red Dwarf to enlist the aid of Arnold Rimmer to continue his galactic fight for justice. Can Arnold actually be up to the challenge of becoming the greatest hero in the multi-verse?

3. Ouroboros

Lister discovers his true origins in a well-written episode full of paradox.

4. Duct Soup

Lister tries to make Kochanski feel at home and Kryten becomes a wee bit jealous, with expected comedic results.

5. Blue

Lister actually finds he misses Rimmer and Kryten invents a creative and hilarious solution to the problem.

6. Beyond a Joke

The search for spare heads for Kryten leads the crew to a dangerous encounter with Simulants and GELFS.

7. Epideme

A deadly and sentient virus infects Lister and drastic measures are needed to destroy it.

8. Nanarchy

Kryten's ""nanobots"" (microscopic robots) are found to be the culprits in the disappearance of their home ship, Red Dwarf, and may also provide a solution the disability with which Lister was left after the previous episode.

In spite of all the changes to the show after Series VI, Red Dwarf Series VII is still better than most anything else on television. It's only when one compares it to earlier Red Dwarf that it seems disappointing. Previous Red Dwarf DVD releases have had excellent extra features, with hilarious outtakes (Smeg Ups), featurettes, hidden features, deleted scenes, and more and this set will be no exception. There's also a ""lost episode"" called Identity Within, performed by Chris Barrie and raw footage included in the extra features, so Red Dwarf fans will find plenty to love on this release.",1131321600,68,3375,4.758147512864494
2378412,4,B000A7JHQ6,"So Red Dwarf 7 is almost upon us, this one being one of the most debatable ones of the entire series.  Grant Naylor becomes half the man he used to be in this series (Grant Naylor is a made up person from Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, the two writers of Red Dwarf who have a bit of a spat and split up so only one of them writes this series), Rimmer decides to leave (Chris Barrie was in others things and decided to leave) and Kochanski comes back, but in a different form (Claire Grogran was on MTV and they get Chloe Annette instead).

This doesn't sound a great start to begin with, and to be honest with you I do think this is the weakest series so far.  However I do think they other series are all fantastic so being the weakest means this is only good (of course I should point out I am a major fan!)

The episodes are:

1. Tikka To Ride

2. Stoke Me A Clipper

3. Ouroboros

4. Duct Soup

5. Blue

6. Beyond a Joke

7. Epideme

8. Nanarchy

This series takes Red Dwarf in a different way to the rest - of course it would have to with Rimmer leaving and Kochanski coming back - but I still enjoyed it.

The depressing thing about this series is that after this one we only have the final series 8 to look forward to and hope that they manage to finish the film by the time that is out so we can enjoy more Dwarf!

Overall 4/5, less then the other series (5/5 for all the rest IMHO) but still very funny and better then most other series out there.

My favourite episodes are probably the Tikka to Ride, where they run out of curry and travel back in time to Dallas, 1961 and beam into a book depository... (not saying any more then that - you can watch it to find out) and Blue just for the Arnold Rimmer song (He's Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer Without him, life would be much grimmer He's handsome, trim, and no one's slimmer He will never need a Zimmer He's Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer)

In short, if you have all the other series, buy this one.  If not... go buy them first, THEN buy this one :)",1130544000,38,2006,4.086956521739131

One thing I have seen is people complaining about it's silliness, or the cheezy plot, or the effects. For all those people, all I have to say is this: It's Supposed To Be!!! It is a sci-fi comedy series people. Most of the cheesiness is intentional, as well as the silliness, the outright hilarity, and even the effects...well, that part might have been more to do with the budget. lol. But honestly, that might have actually helped this series, since they purposely wanted that cheesy sci-fi quality to go with there gags...lol.

Even the actors themselves were clearly enjoying their roles as they played them.

Still, this episode gets 4 stars.  It would be a 5 if not for that minor problem.",1300665600,,378,4.666666666666667
2378455,3,B000A7JHQ6,"As mentioned in the previous review, Red Dwarf abruptly went off the air following transmission of its sixth season at the end of 1993. A criminal case involving actor Craig Charles and the breakdown of the working relationship between writer-producers Rob Grant and Doug Naylor proved disastrous, and although both problems were eventually overcome (Charles was fully exonerated; Rob Grant departed to become a novelist leaving Naylor in charge) it took a long time to sort it all out.

Other problems also seemed to conspire against Red Dwarf's return. As of the sixth season, Red Dwarf was pretty much the sole reason for the continued existence of the BBC's special effects and miniatures department, and with the show on indefinite hiatus the department was closed down, meaning that future special effects requirements would have to be handled by private firms and thus on a far more expensive basis. Actor Chris Barrie had also gone on to enjoy even greater success as the title character in BBC-1 sitcom The Brittas Empire, which was a much simpler and faster show to shoot than Dwarf. As a result, he decided not to appear in Red Dwarf on a full-time basis in the next series. Possibly even a bigger change was the removal of the studio audience, with the show now being fully pre-recorded and only the tape being shown to a studio audience later on. This clearly throws off the rhythms of the actors in the show, with some lines obscured by audience laughter and a few out-of-place pauses for laughs that weren't as big as was hoped for.

Despite these problems, the show's ultimate return was not in doubt. It was BBC-2's single highest-rated TV programme, it was one of the biggest-selling BBC series on video (of any kind) in the 1990s and during the years it was off the air the BBC received numerous enquiries as to when the show would return.

Season VII aired on BBC-2 in early 1997 and it was immediately clear that this was a different show to what had come before. Chris Barrie's character of Rimmer departed in the second episode, though he appeared in several further episodes in brief flashbacks or cameos. Despite a higher budget, the show also struggled with its special effects requirements, with very primitive CGI and some seriously shoddy model work replacing the very accomplished miniature filming and digital effects of Seasons 5-6.

To help secure funding for the long-planned Red Dwarf movie (the prospective backers for which had asked for a major female character to be added to the roster), Naylor decided to add the character of Kristine Kochanksi to the crew on a full-time basis. Kochanski had appeared in several previous episodes in Seasons 1, 2 and 6 played by Clare Grogan, but with Grogan unavailable the role was recast with Chloe Annett. This move wasn't initially popular with the fans, as Annett's previous role had been in the quite spectacularly awful Crime Traveller, but Annett actually turned in a good performance and eventually won over many of the fanbase.

With all of these behind-the-scenes changes it is perhaps inevitable that the quality of the scripts suffered quite badly. Season VII isn't quite the unwatchable pile of cack some hardcore fans describe it as, but it clearly hasn't had the same care and attention paid to the writing as in previous seasons. The extremely rapid dismissal of the Season VI cliffhanger is a little disappointing, but the completely nonsensical technobabble reasons given to explain why Starbug is now many times its former size are very strange indeed. That said, the rest of the opener, Tikka to Ride, in which the Red Dwarf crew inadvertently change history when they travel to Dallas in November 1963, actually has quite a clever premise and a strangely affecting conclusion. It also just about manages to fall on the right side of good taste.

The second episode, Stoke Me a Clipper, is a bit of a disaster. A James Bond-style opening sequence featuring Ace Rimmer sky-surfing on the back of a crocodile is quite entertaining, but the rest of the episode is weak, illogical, badly contrived and deeply unfunny. The third episode, Ouroboros, re-introduces Kochanksi (or rather, a version of Kochanski from an alternate reality) and sees Lister's ex-wife (from Emohawk) showing up again. It's a little bit funnier, but still not up to the standards we expect from the show. Duct Soup, a 'bottle' show set in Starbug's flooded engineering decks, is probably the highlight of the season with some good dialogue and a few good laughs reminiscent of earlier seasons. Blue, in which Lister realises that he misses Rimmer, is also quite amusing as Kryten sets out to remind him precisely what Rimmer was like.

Beyond a Joke starts with a great sequence in which Kryten, annoyed with the crew for missing supper due to being in a VR 'Jane Austen World' simulation, invades the simulation in a Russian T-73 tank and kills everyone (resulting in the largest explosion ever filmed for the series, due to over-eager army demolitions experts who were fans of the show trying to impress the actors). After this it nosedives into the ground with a lot of guff about 'nega-drives', more rogue simulants, more GELFs and a second 4000 series mechanoid who isn't very funny. Epideme has a good premise - a sentient virus that chats to its host whilst it tries to kill him - but the virus has a very annoying voice and the script doesn't really go anywhere after establishing the initial idea.

Nanarchy, the Season VII finale, finally has the crew locating Red Dwarf and learning what happened to the ship when it disappeared. It's a mixed bag of an explanation, being amusing and SF-oriented, dealing with the hitherto unexplored-on-the-show science of nanotechnology, but it's also reliant on the idea that Kryten, a robot whom we have been reminded many times as having being built for the express purpose of cleaning lavatories and was extremely cheap, also had inside him billions of nanobots capable of rearranging atoms. It doesn't really make any sense. Anyway, there's another cliffhanger ending, the return of Holly (the original, played by Norman Lovett) and overall it's a decent enough ending to the season.

The seventh season is a mixed bag, it has to be said. The visual effects and writing are radically inferior to what has come before, although the acting (from both the regulars and guest stars such as Brian Cox) remains strong. The addition of Kochanski to the cast also works surprisingly well, somewhat better than I think most people were expecting at the time. At the same time, this season was also made with significant background problems, and in that context it could have turned out worse. The biggest problem, and one that was unavoidable, is that the series really hurts without Rimmer as part of the mix. Luckily, Chris Barrier had such a blast filming this season that he agreed to return full-time for the eighth, which contributed to that season's somewhat higher quality.",1258761600,3,6990,4.916949152542373
2378456,3,B000A7JHQ6,"Some fans of RED DWARF were truly upset by the changes in Seasons Seven and Eight of the show.  In Season Seven Rimmer played a much smaller role while in Eight he was no longer a hologram.  Chlo Annett joined the show as Lister's former girlfriend Kristine Kochanski and while she did a nice job, she broke up the all boys club of the first six seasons.  In Season Seven the action was on the Space Bug while on Season Eight they finally get back to Red Dwarf, but one on which nanobots had restored all of the former crew members that had died in the show's first episode.  But while all of these represented major changes, the most important was the breakup of the Doug Naylor and Rob Grant writing team.  Grant did not continue with the show and whether because of that or whatever, the comic tone of the show changed dramatically.  As Craig Charles expressed it in an interview in the special features disc, the show ceased to be more of a sitcom and became more of a dramatic comedy.

I can't count myself among the more fanatic RED DWARF fans.  I find it moderately entertaining and moderately funny in its best seasons, but perhaps because I was not among its biggest fans, the changes in the final two seasons bothered me a lot less than it seems to have done others.  There wasn't as much at stake for me as there was for others.  But I had no trouble finding large swathes of it to be quite humorous.  Interestingly, even though Chris Barrie (Rimmer) was not a fulltime cast member in Season Seven (or perhaps because he wasn't fulltime and they were determined to make his moments as funny as possible) the funniest moments in the season belonged to Rimmer.  The Season Seven second episode gave Rimmer a bit of a farewell by having Barrie play Ace Rimmer, and it was one of Chris Barrie's best episodes ever.  Then later in the season the Star Bug's crew undergoes ""The Rimmer Experience,"" which is nothing so much as a Rimmer musical puppet show.  For my moment, that is the single funniest moment in the history of the series.

Season Seven was on Star Bug, but the bulk of Season Eight was on the newly reconstituted Red Dwarf.  I commend the producers for wanting to do something different, but frankly it just didn't feel like RED DWARF with a full crew.  Nor did it feel quite right with Rimmer being a human being rather than a hologram.  There were also fewer truly funny moments. Though both seasons suffered from having less brilliant dialogue than the first six seasons when Rob Grant and Doug Naylor were crafting the scripts.  The first six seasons were always more about talk and brilliant dialogue, while the next two seasons relied more on situational and visual humor as well as extended gags.

All in all, I'm glad that Seasons Seven and Eight were made rather than not made.  They aren't quite as good as Seasons Three through Six (the first two, prior to Kryten's joining the show, simply weren't up to the level of what came after).  Still, there were many good moments.",1246579200,3,3004,4.524074074074074

  put simply it's a SCI-Fi/COMEDY series (BRITISH) about a guy, his cat, the person he hates most in the whole universe, his android. a ""HUGE"" MINING ship 5 miles long and set of cercumstances that forces him to end up being ""the last human being alive in the universe!"".

  just in that respect your saying we'll if everyone is dead, how can they possibly come up with scripts for episodes. as to date 8 SEASONS have been made. hopefully they will continue with more series.

  works are being made for a theatrical release, but i'm not holding my breathe. would be nice though. the circumstances that the crew of the mining ship ""RED DWARF"" get into are hilarious.

  if just fresh enough with new ideas, old ones. poking fun at just about anyone and everything. if you want something a little different this is the SERIES for you!! enjoy

The show still takes itself more seriously than it should this season, just like season 5 and 6  (more six than five)and has darker moments more frequently.  And has anyone else noticed the subtle transtion of the cat?  How hes become, well, not ""cat-like"" so much anymore?  See Series 1 for the Cat at his peak.

He is at first only accompanied by a pet cat (who later evolutionizes into a human ""cat""), the ship's computer (female), and a hologram who you will come to love to hate.

I always felt the show should have ended after Series 6, with the irony of the crew killing themselves.  But anyway...  After talking with my girlfriend, another life-long fan, I decided to pick up Series 7 to further complete my collection.

Regardless of how you feel about Series 7, I gave the item 5 stars because it is put together fantastically.  There are tons of extras, including extended, remastered versions of three episodes...  So much stuff that they had to make it three discs.  So yeah, if you like Red Dwarf and Series 7, then this DVD set is worth the money.

2378470,3,B000A7JHQ6,"Every TV show gets to a point where it just needs to stop and this is where Red Dwarf needed to stop. Series 7 is very very different to the previous 6, in some ways it's good and in alot more ways it's very bad. For starters Chris Barrie decided to leave which left a major gap in the cast and co-writer Rob Grant also decided to part ways with Doug Naylor and co. The whole look and feel of the show changed big time which left us with a show that was more like a comedy drama than a situation comedy. Chris Barrie was replaced with the paifully unfunny Chloe Annett as Listers long time love interest Kochanski and there was no live audience. All in all series 7 seriously lacked the comedy punch of the previos 6 and the lack of Rimmer left Lister with no one to bounch off. Kryten suddenly turned gay and the Cat just became more and more irratating as the season progressed. It's not all bad however there were some really good episodes in this season such as the excelent 'Tikka To Ride' and 'Ouroboros' one of the few without Chris Barrie that actually worked and 'Stoke Me A clipper' is lots of fun 'Blue' is worth watching just for the munchkin song at the end. The rest are mostly awful in particular 'Beyond A joke' witch i found to be embarrasing and the awsomely dull 'Duct Soup'.

The writing is fantastic, great storylines and production.  The only thing I will say about this season, is the cgi effects.. they were pretty bad considering what we are used to seeing.  On the other hand there are three episodes that are available in a remastered version with new effects which is nice..
