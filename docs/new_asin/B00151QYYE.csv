3136806,5,B00151QYYE,"Like many Stooges fans, I was pleased (and relieved) that Sony Pictures did not hesitate in releasing another volume of classics. Chronicling the end of the Depression era/pre-WWII years, the boys were now firmly established as a comedy team (although critical accolades were few) and continuing to hit their stride.
It should be interesting to see Volume Three, when the boys were lampooning the Japanese & Hitler during the War years.",1211241600,6,436,5.154929577464789
3136807,5,B00151QYYE,"THIS DVD HAS BEEN VIEWED IN FULL FROM AN ADVANCED COPY I RECEIVED FROM SONY PICTURES ON 5/16/08:

Either you get the Three Stooges or you don't. There is no middle ground.
It seems that everyone from Jay Leno to University of Arizona Professor Jon Solomon have chimed in on the subject. Essays, numerous books and college lectures have addressed the topic. There are two distinct classes of people. Those that love the classic comedy team and others who scratch their head and wonder why.

During their impressive career, The Three Stooges made 190 short subjects for Columbia Pictures. Add to that their 6 full length features; film cameos; television appearances and 156 cartoons with live wraparounds and their output is staggering.

With last year's Three Stooges Collection Volume One 1934-1936, Sony/Columbia Pictures finally began releasing the Stooges' crown jeweled two-reelers fully restored and in chronological order.
Fans rejoiced! Naysayers found something else to get excited about.

There is good news in Stoogeville as Sony's second volume of restored shorts hits the street on May 27. The Three Stooges Collection Volume Two: 1937-1939 contains 24 titles presented in their original release order.

Each short in this compilation has been digitally remastered and the soundtrack has been fully restored. Never before have these 70+ year old films looked or sounded so good. Gone is each pop, scratch, hiss, splice and wobbly frame. The contrast has been lovingly corrected. Granted, there are times when the picture fluctuates in contrast (when the camera is sped up to make images move faster), but that was limited to the technology for the time.

Most importantly, it shows the team at their peak. Moe, Larry and Curly were never more vigorous than during this period. While there are a few shorts that miss their mark here, many are high energy romps. The fact that numerous directors were in and out of the mix during this era didn't hurt the series.

Here's a blow by blow (no pun intended) analysis for the shorts included on Volume 2:

""Grips, Grunts and Groans"" (****) opens the set and previous VHS and DVD releases were grainy and terribly dark in contrast. The soundtrack
was flat and there was no bass on it, giving it the sound of an AM
transistor radio. It's one of the best shorts on the set and shows
just how far the pacing had come along since many of the shorts
that it preceded. If you ever wondered where they got the idea for the
world of WWF wrestling, look no further. After Larry and Curly brain
prize fighter Ivan Bustoff (played to perfection by Harrison Greene), with a set of dumbells and a falling locker, the boys substitute Curly to wrestle in his place. With the aid of Wild Hyacinth perfume, Curly becomes a force to be reckoned with. CLASSIC LINE: ""Wait a minute. If I'm
gonna get beat up, I want to get paid for it.""

""Dizzy Doctors"" (***) This fan favorite has the Boys selling Brighto.
Naturally, they don't know it's medicine and peddle the stuff from
car polish to spot remover. When they discover Brighto's proper
use, they invade Los Arms Hospital and run amuck trying to cure
assorted patients. CLASSIC LINE: ""You boys really want to know
what it's for? It's for sale, now get busy selling it.""

""Three Dumb Clucks"" (***) is a great idea that could have been executed
better. The premise is promising: the Boys have to break out of jail to
stop their father (played by Curly in a dual role) from marrying some
golddigger and return him to 'Ma'. The short suffers from pacing problems
that keep it from becoming a true classic. CLASSIC SCENES: The
hat fitting and elevator/hallway chase.

""Back To The Woods"" (**1/2) suffers from slow pacing and too many
scenes that weigh it down. It does have it's highlights, but they are too
few and thus is one of the weaker titles in the cannon. The Stooges are
sent to help the colonies against Indian attacks. CLASSIC LINE:
 ""All my life I've been looking for a maid like thee, toots!""

""Goofs and Saddles"" (***1/2) The Stooges are Wild Bill Hiccup, Buffalo Billious and Just Plain Bill in hot pusuit of Longhorn Pete in this western parody. The Boys made several western themed shorts, with this entry being one of the standouts. CLASSIC LINES: ""You got your special deck of cards?""""Soitinly"". ""We won't need 'em."" CLASSIC SCENE: Passing cards under the table with their feet.

""Cash and Carry"" (***) While pathos worked better for Chaplin, there's plenty of gags and snappy dialog to make up for the corny Jimmy and his illness subplot. The Stooges invest Jimmy's leg operation money in a map that leads to finding ""buried teasure"" in a house (conveniently located next to the US Treasury Building). CLASSIC LINE: ""$500, hmm, that's almost a million.""

""Playing the Ponies"" (***1/2) Down and out restauranteurs Moe, Larry and Curly trade their business for Thunderbolt and enter him in a race. Curly discovers that the nag runs fast after eating the hot peppers he swiped from the eatery. CLASSIC LINE: ""Adam and Eve on a raft."" ""Hey, scramble those eggs."" ""Wreck 'em.""

""The Sitter Downers"" (****) This classic has it all. Great gags, fine pacing and a solid storyline. The Stooges go on strike and camp out in their fiancees' home, much to the dismay of their father. The nation sympathizes and gifts come pouring in. When their ready made house has to be assembled, the wives lay down the law: no honeymoon until the house is built. CLASSIC SCENE: Moe and Larry's chase sequence.

""Termites Of 1938"" (****) In a mix up, Mrs. Vantwitchet hires the ACME Exterminators instead of ACME Escorts. Thinking they are hired to rid pests at an upscale party, the Stooges wreak havoc on the guests and the posh home. CLASSIC LINE: ""I wish to hire your best men."" ""We're all pest men.""

'Wee Wee Monsieur"" (***1/2) Behind on their rent, Curly hopes to sell his painting, but when he clobbers the landlord over the head with it during an argument, the Boys are on the run and sign up for the Foreign Legion (thinking it's the American version). Recruited to guard General Gorganzola, he is kidnapped under their watch. They need to bring him back alive or it's cutains for the Stooges. CLASSIC SCENE: The Stooges
dressed as dancing harum girls.

""Tassels In The Air"" (****) One of my favorites! Hired as janitors, the Stooges get in a jam by stenciling the wrong office door titles. Moe is mistaken for Omay, a famous interior decorator. The Curly goes bananas theme (pop goes the weasel; seeing mice; Wild Hyacinth perfume) is reworked when he sees tassels (he was tickled with a pussy willow as a child). The pig Latin bit is priceless! CLASSIC LINE: ""You mean I'm umday in pig language?"" ""You're umday in any language.""

""Flat Foot Stooges"" (**) One of the flatter (no pun intended) shorts. The Stooges are inept firemen. This short misses its mark with a silly story line that involves a gun powder eating duck (silly, even by Stooge standards), who lays an exploding egg and a weak ending that had no effort put into it. Significant for the first use of 'Three Blind Mice' as the opening theme music.

""Healthy, Wealthy and Dumb"" (****) A great Three Stooges vehicle. After winning the Coffin Nail Cigarette radio contest, the Stooges check into the snazzy Hotel Costa Plenty, get plastered; ruin the suite; get terrorized by a monkey; duck the hotel manager, and get railroaded by three comely female golddiggers. All this in 17 minutes! CLASSIC LINE: ""Gentlemen, this bed goes back to Henry The Eighth."" ""That's nothing. We had a bed that went back to Sears Roebuck The Third.""

""Violent Is The Word For Curly"" (***1/2) This fan favorite is best known for the 'Alphabet Song'. The Boys are gas station attendants mistaken for three college professors. They wind up at Mildew College to teach the all girls school a thing or three. CLASSIC LINE: ""You'll just love our student body."" ""Your's wouldn't be so bad either if you took off 20 pounds.""

""Three Missing Links"" (**) One of the weaker films in this set (not to mention the Curly era). After being fired as studio janitors, the Stooges are hired as actors and are shipped to the jungle for the shoot. Uninspired gags, weak pacing and a silly sub plot involving 'love candy' drag this one down. CLASSIC LINE: ""There's great grammer for ya. I'm not me.""

""Mutts To You"" (***1/2) Moe, Larry and Curly run the K9 Dog Laundry Service, a great place with Rube Goldberg type contraptions. When the Stooges find a baby on a doorstep, they take the tyke home fearing he's been abandoned. Lots of great gags, one liners and wild pacing allow the Boys to shine while relying less on their signature slaps and pokes with winning results. CLASSIC LINE: ""Is he on the bottle yet?"" ""I should say not. He don't smoke, drink nor chew.""

""Three Little Sew and Sews"" (*1/2) A disappointing and uneven short that even a manic Curly can't save. The Stooges pass themselves off as Admiral Tailor and his two assistants in hopes to catch a German spy. There is one good gag that rehashes the spring in the butt and one CLASSIC LINE: ""I'm gonna change my socks--what an experience.""

""We Want Our Mummy"" (****) Everything that makes a great Three Stooges short is packed in this classic. Hired by a museum to find the remains of King Rootentooten, the Stooges hire a taxi to Cairo and hook up with crooks who are trying to beat them to the punch. Lots of great gags (Curly's mirage sequence is a standout) and  CLASSIC LINES: ""And if the curse does strike them, it will be a blessing to humanity."" ""I can't be a mummy, I'm a Daddy.""

""A Ducking They Did Go"" (***1/2) The Stooges are on the run for swiping watermelons and elude the cops by stumbling into the office of the Canvas Back Duck Club."" Run by two swindlers, the Stooges rope the police force (and the mayor) to join. When the resort is void of ducks, it's up to the Boys to round some up, pronto. CLASSIC LINE: ""Have you ever sold anything?"" ""Why, soitinly. Anything we could get our hands on."" ""The gentleman said sold, not stole.""  NOTE: Sadly, there is a period when the sound is out of sync.

""Yes, We Have No Bonanza"" (****) One of the best of 1939, which was a stellar year for the Stooges. The boys work in a saloon and find the buried treasure that their boss stole from the First National Bank. CLASSIC LINE: ""Me, coming home from a hard day's work. I whistle for the dog and my wife comes out."" NOTE: There is a period when the soundtrack loses its low end that results in a flat/tin sound. It should be noted that it is still an improvement over previous releases of this short.

""Saved By The Belle"" (***) This is one of the forgotten nuggets in the Stooges' arsonal. Stranded at their hotel in Valeska, the Stooges are aparral salesmen who get mixed up as spies. With the aid of the lovely Rita, they try to save their hides by delivering the map needed to win the cause. CLASSIC LINE: ""Oh, no you don't. What kind of fool do you take me for?"" ""Why? Is there more than one kind?""

""Calling All Curs"" (***1/2) The Stooges are the owners of a dog hospital. When their VIP patient is kidnapped, it's a madcap chase to track down the dognappers. CLASSIC LINE: ""Success."" ""Success."" ""Mazel Tov.""

""Oily To Bed, Oily to Rise"" (****) When Jules White (as Director) wanted to, he could helm gems like this without relying soley on the cartoony, slapstick violence he was so fond of. To help Mrs. Jenkins get her deed back from three crooks who gyped her (they discovered oil on her propery), the Stooges are burning the trail to retrieve the deed. CLASSIC LINE: ""Don't look now, but I think we're about to be killed.""

""Three Sappy People"" (****) Once again, Jules White directs a classic that ends the era of the '30's. Posing as Dr's. Ziller, Zeller and Zoller, the Stooges are hired to cure a rich, spoiled heiress (played with finess by Lorna Grey) of her eccentric ways. This is one of the best of their 190 short films and is loaded with great gags: the statue
reflex scene; the powder puff/biscuit bit; the tamale scene; the cream puff fight. CLASSIC LINE: ""Why don't you get a toupe with some brains in it.""

3136808,5,B00151QYYE,"The Stooges are in prime form on this DVD set! Volume 1 had some clinkers as the boys were setting their pace and developing their comedy style. But here they are a well tuned comedy machine!

In just a little over half a year we are treated to a second volume!  It will take five (5) volumes to complete the Curly shorts (and hopefully include his feature Rockin In the Rockies), and three more volumes to complete Shemp.  If Sony continues to the end, volume #9 will have Joe Besser.

Let's all support Sony's efforts and Buy, Buy, Buy these volumes.  Hey, get some extras to give to friends and turn them on to the Three Stooges!  They are not expensive to give!",1209859200,14,665,4.365853658536586

3136810,5,B00151QYYE,"We Three Stooges fans will be looking forward to another great collection of adventures of Moe and Curly Howard and Larry Fine. This set is an even two dozen instead of just 19 shorts like the first set contained. In GRIPS,GRUNTS & GROANS,Curly(real name Jerome Lester Horwitz) is elected to sub for an ill wrestler who bears physical resemblance to Curly. In DIZZY DOCTORS,the boys are ordered by their wives to go to work instead of just eating and sleeping all the time. They sell a potion called Brighto which they think is an all-purpose cleaner but is actually an internal medicine. In GOOFS AND SADDLES,the boys are out west and Curly is playing cards with a few other guys(not Moe or Larry). In BACK TO THE WOODS,the boys are pilgrims hunting for food. In THREE DUMB CLUCKS,The boys,in jail,receive a note from their mother saying the boys' father has divorced her and is engaged to a younger woman(Curly plays a dual role in this film as himself and the father). The boys do all they can to prevent the wedding from taking place,and Daisy,the father's fiancee,accidentally marries Curly! Clyde Bruckman's script for this film was later recycled for the 1953 remake UP IN DAISY'S PENTHOUSE with Moe's and Curly's brother Shemp playing the dual role. In CASH AND CARRY,the boys ransack garbage in a landfill and discover $62 in a tin can that actually belong to a physically disabled boy and his mother(they are collecting $500 for the boy's operation for Jimmy,the boy,to walk freely again). The boys pay a pair of crooks they meet,$200 for the privilege of digging up a hidden treasure. It turns out the boys accidentally broke into the U.S. Treasury,which is felonious and results in life inprisonment. Since the act was unintentional,the boys were pardoned by President Theodore Roosevelt(he served in 1937). In PLAYING THE PONIES,the boys sell their restaurant to go into horse racing after learning in a newspaper that a horse-race driver received ten grand for winning a race. A spicy snack called Pepperinos made the boys' pet horse(driven by Larry) rapidly run and win. In THE SITTER DOWNERS,the Stooges build a home for their new wives as well as themselves. They go on strike much to the womens' disdain. In TERMITES OF 1938,the boys,like they did once before,wreck havoc at a dinner party trying to kill the infesting unwelcome visitors. The Stooges are Frenchmen in WEE WEE MONSIEUR. They rescue a shah who was held hostage. In TASSELS IN THE AIR,the boys are painters and Moe impersonates an artist named Omay. The real Omay later appears,enraged. HEALTHY,WEALTHY & DUMB has the boys as guests at the posh Hotel Costa Plente after Curly wins $10,000 in a poetry contest. They wreck a bed and furniture and after taxes,the boys go broke leaving them nothing to pay the hotel bill with. Three beautiful girls who are occupying a room near the boys',want the money. This was later remade as A MISSED FORTUNE with Shemp playing Curly's parts. In VIOLENT IS THE WORD FOR CURLY,the boys are gas station attendants,posing as three professors at a girls' college(the professors themselves were the Stooges' customers). In THREE MISSING LINKS,the boys are janitors who are fired and hired for supporting an actress in a movie. In MUTTS TO YOU,the boys are dog-bathers who discover an unattended baby who they put in their care until his parents reclaim him. In THREE LITTLE SEW AND SEWS,the boys are tailor shop attendants as well as navymen. Curly poses as an admiral after the real admiral's suit shows up at the shop. FLAT FOOT STOOGES has the boys again as firemen(first use of the children's song THREE BLIND MICE which became the signature theme thru the last of the short series). In WE WANT OUR MUMMY,the boys are detectives who are sent to Egypt to bring back a mummy for a museum curator's collection. The boys join a phony duck-hunting club in A-DUCKING THEY DID GO. The club was organized by a pair of swindlers. The city mayor and a few of his colleagues are members. In YES WE HAVE NO BONANZA,the boys dig up money that was actually stolen by a pair of crooks. In SAVED BY THE BELLE,we see the boys in some foreign country,with the help of a beautiful girl named Rita,locating a lost map that leads to a treasure. In CALLING ALL CURS,the boys as veterinarians,search for and find a dog stolen by a pair of crooks. The crooks show up at the veterinary clinic,posing as newspaper reporters. The sick dog's owner was so horrified after learning of the dog's kidnapping. But Garcon(gar sone),the dog,is found,alive and well,in parenthood with his mate and their litter. In OILY TO BED OILY TO RISE,the boys succeed in saving a woman's property. She sold it and later regretted it. A trio of crooks were about to have the deed recorded,and the boys swindle it away from them in time so the recording would never happen. Curly,a wishing wizard,has all his wishes granted. Cigars,apple pie,meeting three beautiful girls(the woman's daughters named April,Mae and June) and marrying them! This was later remade with Joe Besser as OIL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL in 1957. In THREE SAPPY PEOPLE,the boys are switchboard operators who attend a black tie birthday party. The birthday woman,who is relentlessly happy and laughing,is believed by her husband to have a mental disorder. So the boys,as psychiatrists,look the woman over. She loves Curly's silliness as well. I dedicate this item to the memories of Moe(1897-1975),Larry(1902-1975) and Curly(1903-1952)",1206316800,85,5469,4.900755124056095

3136812,5,B00151QYYE,"I was happy to see volume two of The Three Stooges released so quickly after the first volume. Here we get more of Moe, Larry, and Curly in the late-Depression pre-war years. Once again the individual episodes are being released chronologically, which is good. Not so good, though, is that once again it appears we will get no commentary or extra features. The first volume had first rate video and audio - far superior to anything I had seen on any other DVD set featuring the trio - so I expect this set will also be excellent in that regard. The following is the listing of the episodes that will be available in this set:

3136892,5,B00151QYYE,"Seriously, there are not a whole lot of things I can say about this collection of timeless, classic Stooge episodes that has not already been said before. However, I really must say that this collection from the last few years of the 1930s is full of some of the best moments in their career that any Stooge fan could ask for. After all, the early years with Curly are where it is at.

What is especially notable about this collection is the inclusion of the episode Violent Is The Word For Curly from which the super-famous B-I-Bickey-Bi song came (please correct me if I spelled that wrong), and still has millions singing along to this day. Another one which is worthy to note is Goofs And Saddles, which contains the parts where Moe, Larry and Curly disguise themselves as bushes to spy on the bandits, befuddling them in the process, and not to mention the part near the end of the episode where the meat-grinder turns into a makeshift Gatling gun, enabling the boys to help subdue the bad guys. Not once have I been able to watch these parts and not find myself fighting to stop myself from having an accident in my pants from laughing so hard. Another stooge fan favorite included here is We Want Our Mummy in which they expedite to Egypt to find the lost mummy of King Rooten-Tooten and a kidnapped professor. Again, as predicted, their antics inadvertently subdue the villains in their tracks. In Grips, Grunts And Groans, how could anyone not find themselves rolling on the floor with more laughs upon Curly going crazy at the smell of Wild Hyacinth and beating the living daylights out of everyone within reach? Honestly, I could go on and on for days about all the episodes in this season. After all, it is the Stooges in their prime. Whats NOT to love?

Honestly, whether they are smacking each other around, poking each other in the eyes, ruining parties, making a mess, destroying things, or just creating pure havoc in general, the Stooges NEVER disappoint, no questions asked. They have invoked laugher in millions the world over for several generations, and will continue to do so for all generations to come. Quality comedy like this NEVER gets old, it DOES NOT have an expiration date, and it can NEVER be recreated or reinvented. Calling the Stooges legends is simply an understatement, and NONE of the childish junk on Disney or Nickelodeon that passes off as comedy nowadays can EVER compare to the Stooges and will certainly never, and I mean NEVER stand the same test of time. I should not even have to say that, because that is just common sense!

Anyways, just buy this already, and as always my fellow stooges fanatics: NYUK-NYUK-NYUK and WOO-WOO-WOO-WOO-WOO-WOO!!!",1425254400,6,2693,4.725531914893617

3136901,5,B00151QYYE,"This volume was the very first volume that I've bought (not from here). The Stooges crack me up every time I watch them. This volume includes: ""Dizzy Doctors"", ""Three Dumb Clucks"" ""Playing the Ponies"", ""The Sitter Downers"", ""Violent Is the Word for Curly"", ""Oily to Bed, Oily to Rise"" and ""Calling All Curs"".

My favorite shorts in this volume are:

Three Dumb Clucks
Goofs and Saddles
Cash and Carry
Playing the Ponies
The Sitter Downers

3136902,5,B00151QYYE,"Yes, I'm a girl. And YES! I absolutely ADORE The Three Stooges. They were simply geniuses of comedy. They took what Ted Healy started and ran with it, and they ran and ran, navigating all obstacles in their path with an agility that their onscreen personas would have envied. The act survived the breakup with Ted, the illness and subsequent tragic death of Curly, the return of Shemp, then Shemp's wholly unexpected death in the back of a taxi cab in 1955. Moe almost gave up then, but he and Larry battled on to the end of their 24 year contract with Columbia with Joe Besser as the third Stooge. And then, when it seemed there was no more left to give, television revived them and they were off on another global adventure, this time with Curly Joe, and the outpouring of love they received from the whole world made up for all the troughs and obstacles and tragedies- oh, but if only Curly and Shemp had been along for the ride in person rather than in spirit. Oh, how I wish I had been around in those days. I believe Moe and Larry answered all their fan mail and were so warm towards their fans. I would have loved to tell Moe he's my favorite Stooge, his perfectly choreographed slaps and exaggerated scowling and snarling has me rolling on the floor (and sighing with total fangirl love!)
Now, with regards this purchase. You cannot go wrong with Volume 2! This pair of DVDs contains '24 digitally remastered shorts presented in their original release order' from 1937- 1939. These were their glory years, the years before Curly got sick, when they were at their slap happy best, their fittest and funniest. (I also recommend Volume 1, 1934- 1936.) If you're interested in an episode listing, here it is. 1937- Grips, Grunts and Groans/ Dizzy Doctors/ Three Dumb Clucks/ Back To The Woods/ Goofs and Saddles/ Cash and Carry/ Playing the Ponies/ The Sitter-Downers. 1938- Termites of 1938/ Wee Wee Monsieur/ Tassels in the Air/ Healthy, Wealthy and Dumb/ Violent is the Word for Curly/ Three Missing Links/ Mutts to You/ Flat Foot Stooges.
1939- Three Little Sew and Sews/ We Want Our Mummy/ A-Ducking They Did Go/ Yes, We Have No Bonanza/ Saved By the Belle/ Calling All Curs/ Oily to Bed, Oily to Rise/ Three Sappy People.
Hmmm, just reading that episode listing makes me want to go watch the DVDs for the third time since they arrived just two days ago. Hooray for the Stooges, the immortal Stooges. Long may they rule the comedy waves!",1417910400,,2446,4.5995423340961095

3136932,5,B00151QYYE,"This collection of stooge shorts kicks off with one of the funniest comedies ever put to film. ""Grips, Grunts and Groans"" is in my eyes an improved version of ""Punch Drunks"" as the boys tackle the subject of professional wrestling and the stooges display that they were the original innovators of hardcore violence.

The closing minutes with Curly going nuts and knocking out people with a ring bell will have you rolling. Easily one of the stooges best films.

If I had any reservations about this particular collection, is that this was the time period where Charley Chase began to direct many of the stooge shorts & he was hardly my favorite director. He seemed to have a softer approach to the stooges & in particular, ""Mutts to You"" seems to strive to put the stooges in the ""cute and whimsical"" category--a category I would rather not see the stooges in.

Also, this time period is when Jules White would begin to step behind the camera & direct and the closing year of 1939 is when Jules and Del Lord would began to crank out classic after classic and continue into the 1940s.

Overall, I rate this 4 1/2 stars.",1399161600,4,1118,4.575

I admit I do cringe at some of Moe's ""Attitude Adjustments ' and some of their Pre- PC statements but that is part of that era. I have all of the sets up into 1952-54. After that that's where it started to lose it shine though Joe Besser did have his moments. These are all un-cut and complete which was cool for me as I've never seen most of these episodes. The episodes I did see were commercial hacked and Snow filled on UHF Channel 52 in the OC. So if you're a 50+ kid like me you don't have to have your Brother on the roof adjusting the antenna ( ""Turn it to the left a little.. No back a little !"" ).

3137008,5,B00151QYYE,"I currently have Volumes 1, 2, 3, and 6, all of which rate 5's, but in comparing these to each other, Volume 2 edges out the others for the top spot.  During the years covered by this Volume (1937 to 1939), it is obvious that the Stooges had perfected their style of comedy.  Their comic routines roll along at a rapid pace and the scripts are funny.

Out of this set of comedies, there are two which are atypical for the Stooges.  The first, is ""Flat Foot Stooges.""  From the title, you might expect the Stooges would be policemen, but no, they are firemen.  If you are a fan of comedies from the silent film era, you might recognize the striking similarities of this Stooge's short to Mack Sennett's Keystone Kops style of comedy.  Perhaps the use of ""Flat Foot"" in the title is a subtle reference to the idea for the script. . . .

The second unique Stooge's short is ""Cash and Carry.""  Most of the film is typical Stooges fare: they attempt to help a young woman and her polio stricken son raise enough cash to pay for an operation.  What's unusual is the ending: the Stooges meet the President of the United States!  When the door to the meeting room is opened, you see President Roosevelt sitting - cane by his side - facing away from the camera.  After FDR grants Executive Clemency to the Stooges, Curly gushes, ""Gee Mister President, you are a swell guy!""  Was it really FDR?  No, he was played by Harry Cohn.

Picture (DVD): 3 to 3.5 .  Sound: low volume.  Subtitles and Languages: none.  Special Features: previews.",1339977600,3,1526,4.447653429602888

The Three Stooges (Moe, Larry, and Curly) are comic legends, as anybody who isn't living under a rock knows.  I grew up watching this stuff on TV.  This collection is presented in full screen format and is 415 minutes in length (about 7 hours).  The picture and sound have both been remastered.  The picture quality in glorious black and white is crystal clear.  The sound is clear as well.  I like all of the shorts in this collection.  These guys came along at the perfect time, during the Depression years of the 1930s.  America needed to laugh at that time.  Really, America needs to laugh now as well, as we're in the midst of another depression.  This collection can certainly help lift your spirits.

My favorite Stooge has always been Curly, but all three guys are great, of course.  From face slapping to head knocks to eye pokes to nose pinching, these guys will entertain you for hours.

3137048,4,B00151QYYE,"The Three Stooges shorts presented here run from January of 1937 with ""Grips,Grunts and Groans"" and end with December of 1939's ""Three Sappy People"".This issue like its' predecessor has been remastered beautifully in a Hi-Def transfer and onto DVD.They have never looked this good...ever.
This second issue sees the Stooges on the rise as far the quality of their material is concerned. While there are many good shorts and sequences up to and including this volume,one can see that many of these films were just stories made up in order to hang gags upon with little or no connection to the next sequence. The fluidity of the stories were improving however but this would be always be a point of contention with The Three Stooges and their shorts. Another drawback was their re-use of footage and gags from previous shorts. Watch the end of ""A Ducking they did Go"".It looks like they ran out of an ending idea and tagged on a clip from a previous short from the first volume in this series;the trouble is it doesn't work. The first short it was used in made sense but here the guys go from clowning around a duck pond in a forest to jumping through brush and onto wild steers in a desert-like area,that cart them away willy nilly. The use of stock footage would plague the Stooges throughout their careers and especially in their later ones in the 50s and really cheapened the laughs. Another thing the Stooges always did was walk a fine line on the hitting and other physical violence;usually instigated by Moe. If executed just right it was funny but if the timing or sequence in which it was done wasn't just right,it was tasteless and definitely non-funny.
No one ever could accuse the Stooges of being hoi-polloi or shooting for the balcony with their style of comedy. It was low comedy with a touch of the Marx Brothers and Mack Sennett thrown together and no one could do it better than Curly,Larry and Moe. Volume Two is the Stooges on the rise and the next volume would see them come into their own. Until then enjoy these ""Three Sappy People"" doing what they do best;being the very funny guys they were.",1274659200,2,2114,4.625
3137049,5,B00151QYYE,"This is a review for the second Three Stooges chronologically ordered two disc set
entitled The Three Stooges Vol 2: 1937-1939.

These two discs contain the 24 comedy shorts that Columbia Pictures released
during the years 1937, 1938 and 1939.  These were the years that the Stooges really
found themselves with titles like ""Healthy, Wealthy and Dumb"" and ""Grips, Grunts and
Groans,"" as well as ""Termites of 1938,""

While hitting their stride the Stooges, like many other classic era comedians, had
fun with the idea if not of finding a profession, at least finding a job.  So many
of these films, like Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp, are about trying to earn a buck
in as comic a way as possible.  And in these films, the Stooges succeed in a fashion
on a par with some of their better known contemporaries.

Sure, some of the bits are repetitive, but these short subjects were not meant to be
watched one after another in your living room, they were meant to be watched in a theater
one at a time with a like minded audience

Again, the Stooges demonstrate amazing variations on the theme of comic revenge.
Revenge on mostly imagined hurts or insults as carried out by Moe to Larry and Curly.
Or revenge carried out by all three Stooges to an unsuspecting world, not that
that world didn't deserve it. Because for the most part it was deserved, ""and how.""

I remember many hours of hilarity watching these guys with my brother when we were kids, and then going to school and emulating some of the slapstick gags that are a hallmark of these classic comedy shorts.  Of course they are stupid and rediculous.  I always thought that was the whole point anyway.  The episodes I have watched so far have been expertly mastered so that they look just like the originals.  I have enjoyed quite a few evenings watching these classics with my son who loves them as much as I did when I was a kid.

3137074,5,B00151QYYE,"A few years after their 1934 Columbia debut, the Three Stooges were hitting their stride in the two-reel comedy field - due in part to the slapstick mastery of director Del Lord. The short subjects in this 1937-39 DVD collection showcase Moe, Larry and Curly at the height of their knucklehead powers. ""Dizzy Doctors,"" ""Wee Wee Monsieur,"" ""Three Little Sew and Sews"" and ""We Want Our Mummy"" remain among the all-time Stooge classics. A few Columbia two-reelers from this period were directed by the underrated Charley Chase, with ""Violent Is the Word for Curly"" a particular standout. Even the lesser efforts - ""Back to the Woods,"" ""Saved by the Belle"" and ""Three Missing Links"" (producer Jules White's directorial debut) - have moments of brilliance thanks to the inimitable Curly Howard, who remains a comedic dynamo. Sony's digital upgrade finally does justice to the Golden Age of Stoogery.",1263427200,2,894,5.08843537414966

In the 1937 episode ""The Sitter Downers"" I have noticed there is a missing scene.  When the Stooges wives tell the stooges to ""build a fire for breakfast while they go to the store"" Curly accidentally burns the plans for the house.  This scene has been cut from the short, but is still referenced later.  Moe tells Larry ""if that puddin' head hadn't have burned the plans we'd have saved plenty of work"".

Considering this is an official release by Sony I was very shocked that there are missing scenes.  Were these just remastered versions of syndicated (cut) episodes?  It makes me wonder what other episodes have scenes cut.

I know its nothing big, but an official release shouldn't have omissions like this.  That's why I only give it four stars instead of five.",1252713600,7,882,4.56687898089172

3137081,5,B00151QYYE,"Sony should be congratulated for finally doing the right thing and releasing all of the Stooge shorts in order, without any lengthy delays between each set, after years of sporadic ""themed"" releases.  This set starts in 1937, when they weren't quite in the classic mode yet, but soon segues into their early classic era.  I once heard it suggested that 'The Sitter-Downers,' their last short of 1937, really marked the beginning of their golden era.  I think I'd have to agree that the transition began somewhere around there, particularly now that we have all of the shorts in order to watch.  This set also contains two of the Missing 60, 'We Want Our Mummy' and 'Three Little Sew and Sews,' the two shorts on here I was most looking forward to seeing since they were among the few Curly shorts I hadn't seen yet.

Once they got into their classic era, they just kept getting better and better, having put all of the final finishing touches on their screen characters, comedic style, and screen relationship.  Some of my favorite shorts on this set are 'A-Ducking They Did Go,' 'Three Missing Links,' 'Flat-Foot Stooges,' 'Three Dumb Clucks,' and 'Violent Is the Word for Curly.'  I've even heard it suggested by some people that the lattermost short contains the world's first music video, since it's a lip-synched performance of a song in video format!  There are a couple of doozies here too, though; 'Back to the Woods' has got to be one of the worst shorts of the Curly era.  I've also never cared too much for 'Grips, Grunts, and Groans,' though at least it's not the awful 'Back to the Woods.'

Again, Sony should be commended for releasing these Stooge sets in such a speedy fashion, and finally releasing the shorts properly.  I do wish there would be some bonus material, but I tend to agree with those who speculate that the bonus material is being saved for the late Shemp and Joe eras, to try to boost up the sales of those less-than-great shorts.",1242345600,2,1962,4.674418604651163

It is fun to watch the group's timing and cinema sophistication grow.  Moe once stated that the secret to a good Stooge short was to put the trio in a situation that they were out of place at - and that included about everything.  From firemen to vets to college professors, this group features the trio in top form.  A great set to watch over and over again as one can see little bits of business evolve from a throw away gag in one short to a major set piece in a later one.  It is also great to see them complete and not whittled away as was the case on most TV broadcasts.  As expected, Moe is bossy; Curly is unpredictable; and Larry is the glue that keeps the team humming... and the shot of Larry floating in a bathtub using balloons while smoking a cigar is still one of the best Stooge sight gags.  While it is true there are two types of people (those who like stooges and those who don't), those who do like them will love this set as much as the first one.

3137110,5,B00151QYYE,"What can one say?  They simply were the best of the best!!
This DVD set continues from years 1937 to 1939 with the Stooges prime comedy. Two of my favorites from this period are ""The Sitter-Downers"" as well as ""Playing the Ponies"". These guys were the greatest. Quality of the set is superb. If you have never seen the Stooges, you are in for a real treat. If you are in need of a good laugh (and who isn't these days)I urge you to get this set, curl up with a bowl of popcorn and prepare to laugh yourself silly.

3137142,5,B00151QYYE,"I bought the first collection, and it was so great that I was even more happy to see the second one there to buy! The best shorts which have never even been on DVD, Cash and Carry and The Sitter Downers, are hilarious and should have been out long ago. The appearance of President Roosevelt (an actor, of course) and the Stooges saluting them at the end of Cash and Carry is quite a moment. I highly, highly recommend these collections- it has been far too long to get them ALL, in the right order too!",1228780800,2,502,4.239583333333333
3137143,5,B00151QYYE,"Well ""Three Stooges"" fans can now exhale because Sony Pictures has released the second ""Three Stooges Collection"" volume two from 1937-1939 with the same amazing video and sound quality as found in the volume one set. Once again fans will be happy to find that all 24 shorts in this outstanding two-disc set are in chronological order and In my opinion they're isn't a bad one in the bunch. By 1937-39 the ""Three Stooges"" were finding their groove and the quality of their shorts was a testament that bigger and better things were still to come from the trio.

As a ""Three Stooges"" fan who purchased the first ""Three Stooges Collection"" volume one the 1934-1936 years I wondered if Sony Pictures would continue to release future sets with the same level of quality shorts found in the volume one set or if this was another studio ploy to screw stooge fans out of their hard earned money, yet again. In the past Sony Studios has been famous for releasing products with inferior quality and sometimes canceling future installments for no reason leaving fans with incomplete sets.

Of the 24 shorts presented in volume two many of them really stand out ""Grips, Grunts and Groans"", ""Healthy, Wealthy and Dumb"", ""Three Missing Links"", ""Calling all Curs"" and my personal favorite ""Violent is the Word for Curly"" are filled with hilarious high jinks as only the three Stooges could serve up for their legions of fans. Volume two is also somewhat of a milestone for the Three Stooges as we are treated to the new stooge theme song as first heard in the short ""Flat Foot Stooges"". The debut of ""Three Blind Mice"" melody as the Stooges new theme song, which replaced the ""Listen to the Mockingbird."" theme is a welcomed change and it enhanced the stooge shorts from then on.

Once again Sony Pictures has done an incredible job with the video and sound remastering and they should be commended for their efforts. The digitally remastered video transfers are simply amazing; no longer do these shorts look like they were made over 70 years ago and the completely restored soundtrack is the best I've ever heard. Missing from the newly remastered shorts is the debris, grain, dirt and sound hissing that used to plague these wonderful shorts. The set contains 24 shorts on two single sided discs packaged in slim cases. The disc artwork and packaging is fantastic to say the least, making this set even more attractive and highly collectible for fans to own.

On a final note Stooge Fans will be pleased that these newly remastered shorts are finally presented complete and uncut, politically incorrect and in all they're Black & White splendor for fans to enjoy over and over. Hip Hip Hooray!

3137144,5,B00151QYYE,"After purchasing the first volume of the Three Stooges collection and watching it with family members, I was pleasantly surprised that the second volume was out so soon!  I pre-ordered it as soon as I could and, after viewing each short from 1937-1939, was not disappointed in the least!

The first volume had a few (but ONLY a few) clunker episodes as the Stooges and their directors were still trying to find their niche, but this volume is air-tight in both acting and directing, as the Stooges really find their formula in appealing to the baser instincts of Depression-Era film-goers (as movies were one of the few things they COULD afford for entertainment).

In my opinion, this is (overall) the best volume of the four that have been released so far, as there isn't a bad episode in the bunch.  If you enjoyed the first collection, or just love the Stooges in general, buy this product with confidence that it will give you many hours of side-splitting laughs!",1226448000,,968,4.744047619047619
3137145,5,B00151QYYE,"This was my second order Volume 2.  The first was for me, and the second was for Lorna Gray, who was in several Three Stooges shorts (including ones on this disc).  She was thrilled that the shorts are being digitally restored, and presented in order.

All the makings of a 5 star release...EXCEPT, unlike the first set, Sony Pictures decided to put their loud and annoying logo between EVERY short. The logo is much louder than the films themselves and can be quite jarring.
I highly recommend this set to any and all fans of The Three Stooges...just keep your finger on the MUTE button when each picture ends.",1224547200,8,490,4.51685393258427

3137149,5,B00151QYYE,"This second release of movie shorts of The Three Stooges is a must buy for all die-hard Stooges fans. Just as in volume one, every short the team made between 1937 and 1939 is here spread out over two discs in the original order in which they were released. They have all been digitally remastered so the sound and picture quality is top notch. Having been a Three Stooges fan since I started watching them as a kid in the 1960s on television, this collection is a real treat.  The Three Stooges were one of the greatest comedy teams in the history of cinematography. Curly Howard was a comedic genius and a true original.  The Three Stooges should have been making full lenth motion pictures instead of these 18-22 minute shorts. Im sure if they did, their motion pictures would have rivaled those of The Marx Brothers and Abbott and Costello. Bravo to Sony Pictures for releasing these disc's. However I think that one master box-set of every movie short the Stooges ever made from 1934 into the late 50s should have been put out a long time ago. The bottom line, if you are a true fan of The Three Stooges, then order this collection from Sony, and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.",1222300800,,1172,4.523584905660377

Having been in the home video manufacturing business (both tape and disc) for many years, the care taken in restoring these comedy classics on DVD is to be commended.  I have a close friend who is a prominent lawyer and also a Stooge fanatic. Over the years he has collected everything available on the Stooges (at considerable cost) all on VHS.  Now he has the DVD's with their dramatically better quality, and a real problem figuring out what to do with 120 videocassettes and all the extra storage area that will be freed up!  For all of you Stooge fanatics who are contemplating a purchase, take it from someone in 'The Biz' and pick up this collection without delay.  Highly reccomended!!",1219968000,3,814,4.771428571428571

I recently bought dvds of the Stooges, only to learn they'll be releasing all the shorts in order from 1934 to...well I hope they release them all, even though the Joe years will be the worst selling set. While some of the gags are repeated often, I still love them. They are always good for a laugh. I like the pace and price they are releasing the sets but the speical features are a mystery. The Stooges have been around for over 70 years and alot of footage can be found on cheaper dvd sets all over the place. I enjoy having all the shorts in order but there is enough Stooge footage out there that could make some really good extras. Overall, well worth the price-considering the Stooges first came on dvd with only 6 shorts for $20 or more and now you pay $20 for 24 shorts or so from year to year. Highly recommended for fans of comedy or anyone looking for a good laugh.",1215561600,,1030,4.207070707070707

The restoration and re-mastering of the video and audio make these very enjoyable and you feel as if you have a time capsule into the past. This collection also features some of the more memorable performances by Curly. The fact that Sony released these in chronological order means that there are no repeats or overlaps. So I hope Sony keeps on restoring and releasing these dubious masterpieces. If you want a good dose of the Stooges, buy this DVD, you won't regret it. Pick up volume one as well while you are at it. I did!",1214956800,,695,4.2727272727272725
3137208,5,B00151QYYE,"Volume 2 is an improvement over Volume 1, mainly because the Stooges have really hit their stride after having done 19 shorts previous to this. The slapstick is turned up a notch & Curly's routines have now come center stage. This set has 24 shorts that include: Three Dumb Clucks in which Curly has two parts; Goofs & Saddles where they are scouts in the West; Dizzy Doctors that features the infamous Brighto; Termites of 1938, one of their famous exterminator routines; Mutts to You in which they're accused of being a baby snatcher; We Want Our Mummy, their famous skit searching for Pharoh Rootin-Tootin; & Three Sappy People where they are mistaken for three famous psychiatrists. All the routines are outstanding &, unlike the first volume, there aren't any so-so shorts here.

If you want some side-splitting slapstick then Volume Two is for you. It's unfortunate but there isn't any bonus materials, not even captioning. The remastering is excellent though an occasional flaw gets through but nothing that's distracting.",1214784000,2,1029,5.052941176470588

3137210,5,B00151QYYE,"The Three Stooges shorts are FINALLY getting their just due by being released in chronological order and with superb picture quality and sound.
  This is definitely where the stooges hit their stride and each of these comic geniuses developed his individual role in the trio. Moe established himself as the leader who was so sharp with a verbal or physical assault. Larry was the neutral one who mostly reacted to the other two and was usually on the receiving end of Moe's abuse. Finally, we have the quintessential stooge Curly whose comic timing, body language, hilarious facial expressions and unforgettable sayings (e.g. NYUK, NYUK) brought it all together.
  Most of the shorts during this period were directed by Del Lord and Jules White and it can be clearly seen how their presence behind the camera raised the Stooge shorts to a new level of hilarity. From causing a riot in the old West in ""Goofs and Saddles"" to swinging the alphabet in ""Violent is the Word for Curly"" you can be sure that the Stooges will deliver the laughs.
  Keep these collections going because there have been far too many Three Stooges DVDs that were so poorly organized and had the same shorts being released on multiple DVDs. At last, the fans get the Stooge episodes the way that they should have been released in the first place.",1214524800,2,1318,4.758771929824562

These films can't help making you laugh and enjoying the skills of all three players and all of the other supporting players who appear in so many of their flicks.

The restoration on these shorts, as in Volume 1, is absolutely gorgeous.  Some of my personal favorites, like ""The Sitter Downers"" and ""Yes We Have No Bonanza"" are included on this set, with Curly at the height of his numb-skull powers.  With this and the previous collection you can now own 43 out of 190 total classic Three Stooges short subjects in chronological order for an amazing low price in the absolute highest quality, most pristine condition they've been seen in since they were new in theaters.  Again, great work Sony!

As a small trade-off there are no extras or commentaries on these sets.  I would still pay more for these sets if they contained such material, but to be honest most Three Stooges facts and trivia have been revealed and analyzed hundreds of times over during their various TV incarnations and specials over the years.  I say, keep 'em coming just the way they are Sony, please!  I want to own them all!

It's been great finally seeing these shorts in chronological order and being able to notice subtle and not so subtle changes, like the opening theme. The first 8 episodes in Vol 1 all had different opening songs before the verse portion of Listen to the Mockingbird became the official one. In late 1938 and early 1939 Mockingbird flip-flops with 3 Blind Mice before 3 Blind Mice becomes the main theme. I always  preferred Mockingbird myself. As in Vol 1, the picture quality in Vol 2 is great. Vol 3 is also going to be a must have with A Plumbing We Will Go, You Nazti Spy and I'll Never Heil You Again.

And you get 24 shorts for about 20 bucks - a stark contrast to the older Stooge DVDs which would have just 5 shorts for the same price. This period (37-39) arguably captures the Stooges at their best, but everyone has different opinions on that. If it's not their best period, almost everyone would agree it's one of them.

Stooge fans and fans of classic comedy need to buy these so the remaining Stooges shorts get the same treatment. As long as these volumes sell well, we'll see more of them.",1211760000,7,629,4.517543859649122
3137245,5,B00151QYYE,"The Three Stooges were decades ahead of their time.
Their type of physical comedy that they pioneered is the absolute hardest to do.  Jack Black, Jim Carrey, Steve Carrell, Mike Myers, and even the Wayans brothers, all owe their entire careers to this legendary comedy team.
After years of poor transfers and the same repeated shorts on extremely high priced sets of only a few episodes at a time, Sony releases yet another volume of what is hands down the ultimate Stooge fans must-have set.
This treasure trove of shorts, many of which have almost never been aired and have not seen the light of day since their original theatrical exhibition back in the late 1930's, is the only special feature you need.  If you have any younger children or teens that are fans of newer comedians I strongly urge you to introduce them to the men that invented today's type of comedy.  Sure, they might initialy balk at the original Black & White presentation of the shorts, but I can give you a 100% guarantee that once they start watching these legendary masters go to work, they will want to repeatedly visit this wonderful timecapsule of a bygone era that trancends the two tone color of these films.  The greatest tribute to these masters of Comedy, is knowing that newer generations are getting introduced to them.",1211414400,5,1306,4.740088105726873

It should be interesting to see Volume Three, when the boys were lampooning the Japanese & Hitler during the War years.",1211241600,6,436,5.154929577464789
3371304,5,B00151QYYE,"THIS DVD HAS BEEN VIEWED IN FULL FROM AN ADVANCED COPY I RECEIVED FROM SONY PICTURES ON 5/16/08:

Either you get the Three Stooges or you don't. There is no middle ground.
It seems that everyone from Jay Leno to University of Arizona Professor Jon Solomon have chimed in on the subject. Essays, numerous books and college lectures have addressed the topic. There are two distinct classes of people. Those that love the classic comedy team and others who scratch their head and wonder why.

During their impressive career, The Three Stooges made 190 short subjects for Columbia Pictures. Add to that their 6 full length features; film cameos; television appearances and 156 cartoons with live wraparounds and their output is staggering.

With last year's Three Stooges Collection Volume One 1934-1936, Sony/Columbia Pictures finally began releasing the Stooges' crown jeweled two-reelers fully restored and in chronological order.
Fans rejoiced! Naysayers found something else to get excited about.

There is good news in Stoogeville as Sony's second volume of restored shorts hits the street on May 27. The Three Stooges Collection Volume Two: 1937-1939 contains 24 titles presented in their original release order.

Each short in this compilation has been digitally remastered and the soundtrack has been fully restored. Never before have these 70+ year old films looked or sounded so good. Gone is each pop, scratch, hiss, splice and wobbly frame. The contrast has been lovingly corrected. Granted, there are times when the picture fluctuates in contrast (when the camera is sped up to make images move faster), but that was limited to the technology for the time.

Most importantly, it shows the team at their peak. Moe, Larry and Curly were never more vigorous than during this period. While there are a few shorts that miss their mark here, many are high energy romps. The fact that numerous directors were in and out of the mix during this era didn't hurt the series.

Here's a blow by blow (no pun intended) analysis for the shorts included on Volume 2:

""Grips, Grunts and Groans"" (****) opens the set and previous VHS and DVD releases were grainy and terribly dark in contrast. The soundtrack
was flat and there was no bass on it, giving it the sound of an AM
transistor radio. It's one of the best shorts on the set and shows
just how far the pacing had come along since many of the shorts
that it preceded. If you ever wondered where they got the idea for the
world of WWF wrestling, look no further. After Larry and Curly brain
prize fighter Ivan Bustoff (played to perfection by Harrison Greene), with a set of dumbells and a falling locker, the boys substitute Curly to wrestle in his place. With the aid of Wild Hyacinth perfume, Curly becomes a force to be reckoned with. CLASSIC LINE: ""Wait a minute. If I'm
gonna get beat up, I want to get paid for it.""

""Dizzy Doctors"" (***) This fan favorite has the Boys selling Brighto.
Naturally, they don't know it's medicine and peddle the stuff from
car polish to spot remover. When they discover Brighto's proper
use, they invade Los Arms Hospital and run amuck trying to cure
assorted patients. CLASSIC LINE: ""You boys really want to know
what it's for? It's for sale, now get busy selling it.""

""Three Dumb Clucks"" (***) is a great idea that could have been executed
better. The premise is promising: the Boys have to break out of jail to
stop their father (played by Curly in a dual role) from marrying some
golddigger and return him to 'Ma'. The short suffers from pacing problems
that keep it from becoming a true classic. CLASSIC SCENES: The
hat fitting and elevator/hallway chase.

""Back To The Woods"" (**1/2) suffers from slow pacing and too many
scenes that weigh it down. It does have it's highlights, but they are too
few and thus is one of the weaker titles in the cannon. The Stooges are
sent to help the colonies against Indian attacks. CLASSIC LINE:
 ""All my life I've been looking for a maid like thee, toots!""

""Goofs and Saddles"" (***1/2) The Stooges are Wild Bill Hiccup, Buffalo Billious and Just Plain Bill in hot pusuit of Longhorn Pete in this western parody. The Boys made several western themed shorts, with this entry being one of the standouts. CLASSIC LINES: ""You got your special deck of cards?""""Soitinly"". ""We won't need 'em."" CLASSIC SCENE: Passing cards under the table with their feet.

""Cash and Carry"" (***) While pathos worked better for Chaplin, there's plenty of gags and snappy dialog to make up for the corny Jimmy and his illness subplot. The Stooges invest Jimmy's leg operation money in a map that leads to finding ""buried teasure"" in a house (conveniently located next to the US Treasury Building). CLASSIC LINE: ""$500, hmm, that's almost a million.""

""Playing the Ponies"" (***1/2) Down and out restauranteurs Moe, Larry and Curly trade their business for Thunderbolt and enter him in a race. Curly discovers that the nag runs fast after eating the hot peppers he swiped from the eatery. CLASSIC LINE: ""Adam and Eve on a raft."" ""Hey, scramble those eggs."" ""Wreck 'em.""

""The Sitter Downers"" (****) This classic has it all. Great gags, fine pacing and a solid storyline. The Stooges go on strike and camp out in their fiancees' home, much to the dismay of their father. The nation sympathizes and gifts come pouring in. When their ready made house has to be assembled, the wives lay down the law: no honeymoon until the house is built. CLASSIC SCENE: Moe and Larry's chase sequence.

""Termites Of 1938"" (****) In a mix up, Mrs. Vantwitchet hires the ACME Exterminators instead of ACME Escorts. Thinking they are hired to rid pests at an upscale party, the Stooges wreak havoc on the guests and the posh home. CLASSIC LINE: ""I wish to hire your best men."" ""We're all pest men.""

'Wee Wee Monsieur"" (***1/2) Behind on their rent, Curly hopes to sell his painting, but when he clobbers the landlord over the head with it during an argument, the Boys are on the run and sign up for the Foreign Legion (thinking it's the American version). Recruited to guard General Gorganzola, he is kidnapped under their watch. They need to bring him back alive or it's cutains for the Stooges. CLASSIC SCENE: The Stooges
dressed as dancing harum girls.

""Tassels In The Air"" (****) One of my favorites! Hired as janitors, the Stooges get in a jam by stenciling the wrong office door titles. Moe is mistaken for Omay, a famous interior decorator. The Curly goes bananas theme (pop goes the weasel; seeing mice; Wild Hyacinth perfume) is reworked when he sees tassels (he was tickled with a pussy willow as a child). The pig Latin bit is priceless! CLASSIC LINE: ""You mean I'm umday in pig language?"" ""You're umday in any language.""

""Flat Foot Stooges"" (**) One of the flatter (no pun intended) shorts. The Stooges are inept firemen. This short misses its mark with a silly story line that involves a gun powder eating duck (silly, even by Stooge standards), who lays an exploding egg and a weak ending that had no effort put into it. Significant for the first use of 'Three Blind Mice' as the opening theme music.

""Healthy, Wealthy and Dumb"" (****) A great Three Stooges vehicle. After winning the Coffin Nail Cigarette radio contest, the Stooges check into the snazzy Hotel Costa Plenty, get plastered; ruin the suite; get terrorized by a monkey; duck the hotel manager, and get railroaded by three comely female golddiggers. All this in 17 minutes! CLASSIC LINE: ""Gentlemen, this bed goes back to Henry The Eighth."" ""That's nothing. We had a bed that went back to Sears Roebuck The Third.""

""Violent Is The Word For Curly"" (***1/2) This fan favorite is best known for the 'Alphabet Song'. The Boys are gas station attendants mistaken for three college professors. They wind up at Mildew College to teach the all girls school a thing or three. CLASSIC LINE: ""You'll just love our student body."" ""Your's wouldn't be so bad either if you took off 20 pounds.""

""Three Missing Links"" (**) One of the weaker films in this set (not to mention the Curly era). After being fired as studio janitors, the Stooges are hired as actors and are shipped to the jungle for the shoot. Uninspired gags, weak pacing and a silly sub plot involving 'love candy' drag this one down. CLASSIC LINE: ""There's great grammer for ya. I'm not me.""

""Mutts To You"" (***1/2) Moe, Larry and Curly run the K9 Dog Laundry Service, a great place with Rube Goldberg type contraptions. When the Stooges find a baby on a doorstep, they take the tyke home fearing he's been abandoned. Lots of great gags, one liners and wild pacing allow the Boys to shine while relying less on their signature slaps and pokes with winning results. CLASSIC LINE: ""Is he on the bottle yet?"" ""I should say not. He don't smoke, drink nor chew.""

""Three Little Sew and Sews"" (*1/2) A disappointing and uneven short that even a manic Curly can't save. The Stooges pass themselves off as Admiral Tailor and his two assistants in hopes to catch a German spy. There is one good gag that rehashes the spring in the butt and one CLASSIC LINE: ""I'm gonna change my socks--what an experience.""

""We Want Our Mummy"" (****) Everything that makes a great Three Stooges short is packed in this classic. Hired by a museum to find the remains of King Rootentooten, the Stooges hire a taxi to Cairo and hook up with crooks who are trying to beat them to the punch. Lots of great gags (Curly's mirage sequence is a standout) and  CLASSIC LINES: ""And if the curse does strike them, it will be a blessing to humanity."" ""I can't be a mummy, I'm a Daddy.""

""A Ducking They Did Go"" (***1/2) The Stooges are on the run for swiping watermelons and elude the cops by stumbling into the office of the Canvas Back Duck Club."" Run by two swindlers, the Stooges rope the police force (and the mayor) to join. When the resort is void of ducks, it's up to the Boys to round some up, pronto. CLASSIC LINE: ""Have you ever sold anything?"" ""Why, soitinly. Anything we could get our hands on."" ""The gentleman said sold, not stole.""  NOTE: Sadly, there is a period when the sound is out of sync.

""Yes, We Have No Bonanza"" (****) One of the best of 1939, which was a stellar year for the Stooges. The boys work in a saloon and find the buried treasure that their boss stole from the First National Bank. CLASSIC LINE: ""Me, coming home from a hard day's work. I whistle for the dog and my wife comes out."" NOTE: There is a period when the soundtrack loses its low end that results in a flat/tin sound. It should be noted that it is still an improvement over previous releases of this short.

""Saved By The Belle"" (***) This is one of the forgotten nuggets in the Stooges' arsonal. Stranded at their hotel in Valeska, the Stooges are aparral salesmen who get mixed up as spies. With the aid of the lovely Rita, they try to save their hides by delivering the map needed to win the cause. CLASSIC LINE: ""Oh, no you don't. What kind of fool do you take me for?"" ""Why? Is there more than one kind?""

""Calling All Curs"" (***1/2) The Stooges are the owners of a dog hospital. When their VIP patient is kidnapped, it's a madcap chase to track down the dognappers. CLASSIC LINE: ""Success."" ""Success."" ""Mazel Tov.""

""Oily To Bed, Oily to Rise"" (****) When Jules White (as Director) wanted to, he could helm gems like this without relying soley on the cartoony, slapstick violence he was so fond of. To help Mrs. Jenkins get her deed back from three crooks who gyped her (they discovered oil on her propery), the Stooges are burning the trail to retrieve the deed. CLASSIC LINE: ""Don't look now, but I think we're about to be killed.""

""Three Sappy People"" (****) Once again, Jules White directs a classic that ends the era of the '30's. Posing as Dr's. Ziller, Zeller and Zoller, the Stooges are hired to cure a rich, spoiled heiress (played with finess by Lorna Grey) of her eccentric ways. This is one of the best of their 190 short films and is loaded with great gags: the statue
reflex scene; the powder puff/biscuit bit; the tamale scene; the cream puff fight. CLASSIC LINE: ""Why don't you get a toupe with some brains in it.""

In just a little over half a year we are treated to a second volume!  It will take five (5) volumes to complete the Curly shorts (and hopefully include his feature Rockin In the Rockies), and three more volumes to complete Shemp.  If Sony continues to the end, volume #9 will have Joe Besser.

3371307,5,B00151QYYE,"We Three Stooges fans will be looking forward to another great collection of adventures of Moe and Curly Howard and Larry Fine. This set is an even two dozen instead of just 19 shorts like the first set contained. In GRIPS,GRUNTS & GROANS,Curly(real name Jerome Lester Horwitz) is elected to sub for an ill wrestler who bears physical resemblance to Curly. In DIZZY DOCTORS,the boys are ordered by their wives to go to work instead of just eating and sleeping all the time. They sell a potion called Brighto which they think is an all-purpose cleaner but is actually an internal medicine. In GOOFS AND SADDLES,the boys are out west and Curly is playing cards with a few other guys(not Moe or Larry). In BACK TO THE WOODS,the boys are pilgrims hunting for food. In THREE DUMB CLUCKS,The boys,in jail,receive a note from their mother saying the boys' father has divorced her and is engaged to a younger woman(Curly plays a dual role in this film as himself and the father). The boys do all they can to prevent the wedding from taking place,and Daisy,the father's fiancee,accidentally marries Curly! Clyde Bruckman's script for this film was later recycled for the 1953 remake UP IN DAISY'S PENTHOUSE with Moe's and Curly's brother Shemp playing the dual role. In CASH AND CARRY,the boys ransack garbage in a landfill and discover $62 in a tin can that actually belong to a physically disabled boy and his mother(they are collecting $500 for the boy's operation for Jimmy,the boy,to walk freely again). The boys pay a pair of crooks they meet,$200 for the privilege of digging up a hidden treasure. It turns out the boys accidentally broke into the U.S. Treasury,which is felonious and results in life inprisonment. Since the act was unintentional,the boys were pardoned by President Theodore Roosevelt(he served in 1937). In PLAYING THE PONIES,the boys sell their restaurant to go into horse racing after learning in a newspaper that a horse-race driver received ten grand for winning a race. A spicy snack called Pepperinos made the boys' pet horse(driven by Larry) rapidly run and win. In THE SITTER DOWNERS,the Stooges build a home for their new wives as well as themselves. They go on strike much to the womens' disdain. In TERMITES OF 1938,the boys,like they did once before,wreck havoc at a dinner party trying to kill the infesting unwelcome visitors. The Stooges are Frenchmen in WEE WEE MONSIEUR. They rescue a shah who was held hostage. In TASSELS IN THE AIR,the boys are painters and Moe impersonates an artist named Omay. The real Omay later appears,enraged. HEALTHY,WEALTHY & DUMB has the boys as guests at the posh Hotel Costa Plente after Curly wins $10,000 in a poetry contest. They wreck a bed and furniture and after taxes,the boys go broke leaving them nothing to pay the hotel bill with. Three beautiful girls who are occupying a room near the boys',want the money. This was later remade as A MISSED FORTUNE with Shemp playing Curly's parts. In VIOLENT IS THE WORD FOR CURLY,the boys are gas station attendants,posing as three professors at a girls' college(the professors themselves were the Stooges' customers). In THREE MISSING LINKS,the boys are janitors who are fired and hired for supporting an actress in a movie. In MUTTS TO YOU,the boys are dog-bathers who discover an unattended baby who they put in their care until his parents reclaim him. In THREE LITTLE SEW AND SEWS,the boys are tailor shop attendants as well as navymen. Curly poses as an admiral after the real admiral's suit shows up at the shop. FLAT FOOT STOOGES has the boys again as firemen(first use of the children's song THREE BLIND MICE which became the signature theme thru the last of the short series). In WE WANT OUR MUMMY,the boys are detectives who are sent to Egypt to bring back a mummy for a museum curator's collection. The boys join a phony duck-hunting club in A-DUCKING THEY DID GO. The club was organized by a pair of swindlers. The city mayor and a few of his colleagues are members. In YES WE HAVE NO BONANZA,the boys dig up money that was actually stolen by a pair of crooks. In SAVED BY THE BELLE,we see the boys in some foreign country,with the help of a beautiful girl named Rita,locating a lost map that leads to a treasure. In CALLING ALL CURS,the boys as veterinarians,search for and find a dog stolen by a pair of crooks. The crooks show up at the veterinary clinic,posing as newspaper reporters. The sick dog's owner was so horrified after learning of the dog's kidnapping. But Garcon(gar sone),the dog,is found,alive and well,in parenthood with his mate and their litter. In OILY TO BED OILY TO RISE,the boys succeed in saving a woman's property. She sold it and later regretted it. A trio of crooks were about to have the deed recorded,and the boys swindle it away from them in time so the recording would never happen. Curly,a wishing wizard,has all his wishes granted. Cigars,apple pie,meeting three beautiful girls(the woman's daughters named April,Mae and June) and marrying them! This was later remade with Joe Besser as OIL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL in 1957. In THREE SAPPY PEOPLE,the boys are switchboard operators who attend a black tie birthday party. The birthday woman,who is relentlessly happy and laughing,is believed by her husband to have a mental disorder. So the boys,as psychiatrists,look the woman over. She loves Curly's silliness as well. I dedicate this item to the memories of Moe(1897-1975),Larry(1902-1975) and Curly(1903-1952)",1206316800,85,5469,4.900755124056095

3371309,5,B00151QYYE,"I was happy to see volume two of The Three Stooges released so quickly after the first volume. Here we get more of Moe, Larry, and Curly in the late-Depression pre-war years. Once again the individual episodes are being released chronologically, which is good. Not so good, though, is that once again it appears we will get no commentary or extra features. The first volume had first rate video and audio - far superior to anything I had seen on any other DVD set featuring the trio - so I expect this set will also be excellent in that regard.

3371389,5,B00151QYYE,"Seriously, there are not a whole lot of things I can say about this collection of timeless, classic Stooge episodes that has not already been said before. However, I really must say that this collection from the last few years of the 1930s is full of some of the best moments in their career that any Stooge fan could ask for. After all, the early years with Curly are where it is at.

What is especially notable about this collection is the inclusion of the episode Violent Is The Word For Curly from which the super-famous B-I-Bickey-Bi song came (please correct me if I spelled that wrong), and still has millions singing along to this day. Another one which is worthy to note is Goofs And Saddles, which contains the parts where Moe, Larry and Curly disguise themselves as bushes to spy on the bandits, befuddling them in the process, and not to mention the part near the end of the episode where the meat-grinder turns into a makeshift Gatling gun, enabling the boys to help subdue the bad guys. Not once have I been able to watch these parts and not find myself fighting to stop myself from having an accident in my pants from laughing so hard. Another stooge fan favorite included here is We Want Our Mummy in which they expedite to Egypt to find the lost mummy of King Rooten-Tooten and a kidnapped professor. Again, as predicted, their antics inadvertently subdue the villains in their tracks. In Grips, Grunts And Groans, how could anyone not find themselves rolling on the floor with more laughs upon Curly going crazy at the smell of Wild Hyacinth and beating the living daylights out of everyone within reach? Honestly, I could go on and on for days about all the episodes in this season. After all, it is the Stooges in their prime. Whats NOT to love?

Honestly, whether they are smacking each other around, poking each other in the eyes, ruining parties, making a mess, destroying things, or just creating pure havoc in general, the Stooges NEVER disappoint, no questions asked. They have invoked laugher in millions the world over for several generations, and will continue to do so for all generations to come. Quality comedy like this NEVER gets old, it DOES NOT have an expiration date, and it can NEVER be recreated or reinvented. Calling the Stooges legends is simply an understatement, and NONE of the childish junk on Disney or Nickelodeon that passes off as comedy nowadays can EVER compare to the Stooges and will certainly never, and I mean NEVER stand the same test of time. I should not even have to say that, because that is just common sense!

Anyways, just buy this already, and as always my fellow stooges fanatics: NYUK-NYUK-NYUK and WOO-WOO-WOO-WOO-WOO-WOO!!!",1425254400,6,2693,4.725531914893617

3371398,5,B00151QYYE,"This volume was the very first volume that I've bought (not from here). The Stooges crack me up every time I watch them. This volume includes: ""Dizzy Doctors"", ""Three Dumb Clucks"" ""Playing the Ponies"", ""The Sitter Downers"", ""Violent Is the Word for Curly"", ""Oily to Bed, Oily to Rise"" and ""Calling All Curs"".

Three Dumb Clucks
Goofs and Saddles
Cash and Carry

3371399,5,B00151QYYE,"Yes, I'm a girl. And YES! I absolutely ADORE The Three Stooges. They were simply geniuses of comedy. They took what Ted Healy started and ran with it, and they ran and ran, navigating all obstacles in their path with an agility that their onscreen personas would have envied. The act survived the breakup with Ted, the illness and subsequent tragic death of Curly, the return of Shemp, then Shemp's wholly unexpected death in the back of a taxi cab in 1955. Moe almost gave up then, but he and Larry battled on to the end of their 24 year contract with Columbia with Joe Besser as the third Stooge. And then, when it seemed there was no more left to give, television revived them and they were off on another global adventure, this time with Curly Joe, and the outpouring of love they received from the whole world made up for all the troughs and obstacles and tragedies- oh, but if only Curly and Shemp had been along for the ride in person rather than in spirit. Oh, how I wish I had been around in those days. I believe Moe and Larry answered all their fan mail and were so warm towards their fans. I would have loved to tell Moe he's my favorite Stooge, his perfectly choreographed slaps and exaggerated scowling and snarling has me rolling on the floor (and sighing with total fangirl love!)
Now, with regards this purchase. You cannot go wrong with Volume 2! This pair of DVDs contains '24 digitally remastered shorts presented in their original release order' from 1937- 1939. These were their glory years, the years before Curly got sick, when they were at their slap happy best, their fittest and funniest. (I also recommend Volume 1, 1934- 1936.) If you're interested in an episode listing, here it is. 1937- Grips, Grunts and Groans/ Dizzy Doctors/ Three Dumb Clucks/ Back To The Woods/ Goofs and Saddles/ Cash and Carry/ Playing the Ponies/ The Sitter-Downers. 1938- Termites of 1938/ Wee Wee Monsieur/ Tassels in the Air/ Healthy, Wealthy and Dumb/ Violent is the Word for Curly/ Three Missing Links/ Mutts to You/ Flat Foot Stooges.
1939- Three Little Sew and Sews/ We Want Our Mummy/ A-Ducking They Did Go/ Yes, We Have No Bonanza/ Saved By the Belle/ Calling All Curs/ Oily to Bed, Oily to Rise/ Three Sappy People.
Hmmm, just reading that episode listing makes me want to go watch the DVDs for the third time since they arrived just two days ago. Hooray for the Stooges, the immortal Stooges. Long may they rule the comedy waves!",1417910400,,2446,4.5995423340961095

3371429,5,B00151QYYE,"This collection of stooge shorts kicks off with one of the funniest comedies ever put to film. ""Grips, Grunts and Groans"" is in my eyes an improved version of ""Punch Drunks"" as the boys tackle the subject of professional wrestling and the stooges display that they were the original innovators of hardcore violence.

The closing minutes with Curly going nuts and knocking out people with a ring bell will have you rolling. Easily one of the stooges best films.

If I had any reservations about this particular collection, is that this was the time period where Charley Chase began to direct many of the stooge shorts & he was hardly my favorite director. He seemed to have a softer approach to the stooges & in particular, ""Mutts to You"" seems to strive to put the stooges in the ""cute and whimsical"" category--a category I would rather not see the stooges in.

Also, this time period is when Jules White would begin to step behind the camera & direct and the closing year of 1939 is when Jules and Del Lord would began to crank out classic after classic and continue into the 1940s.

Overall, I rate this 4 1/2 stars.",1399161600,4,1118,4.575

I admit I do cringe at some of Moe's ""Attitude Adjustments ' and some of their Pre- PC statements but that is part of that era. I have all of the sets up into 1952-54. After that that's where it started to lose it shine though Joe Besser did have his moments. These are all un-cut and complete which was cool for me as I've never seen most of these episodes. The episodes I did see were commercial hacked and Snow filled on UHF Channel 52 in the OC. So if you're a 50+ kid like me you don't have to have your Brother on the roof adjusting the antenna ( ""Turn it to the left a little.. No back a little !"" ).

3371505,5,B00151QYYE,"I currently have Volumes 1, 2, 3, and 6, all of which rate 5's, but in comparing these to each other, Volume 2 edges out the others for the top spot.  During the years covered by this Volume (1937 to 1939), it is obvious that the Stooges had perfected their style of comedy.  Their comic routines roll along at a rapid pace and the scripts are funny.

Out of this set of comedies, there are two which are atypical for the Stooges.  The first, is ""Flat Foot Stooges.""  From the title, you might expect the Stooges would be policemen, but no, they are firemen.  If you are a fan of comedies from the silent film era, you might recognize the striking similarities of this Stooge's short to Mack Sennett's Keystone Kops style of comedy.  Perhaps the use of ""Flat Foot"" in the title is a subtle reference to the idea for the script. . . .

The second unique Stooge's short is ""Cash and Carry.""  Most of the film is typical Stooges fare: they attempt to help a young woman and her polio stricken son raise enough cash to pay for an operation.  What's unusual is the ending: the Stooges meet the President of the United States!  When the door to the meeting room is opened, you see President Roosevelt sitting - cane by his side - facing away from the camera.  After FDR grants Executive Clemency to the Stooges, Curly gushes, ""Gee Mister President, you are a swell guy!""  Was it really FDR?  No, he was played by Harry Cohn.

Picture (DVD): 3 to 3.5 .  Sound: low volume.  Subtitles and Languages: none.  Special Features: previews.",1339977600,3,1526,4.447653429602888

The Three Stooges (Moe, Larry, and Curly) are comic legends, as anybody who isn't living under a rock knows.  I grew up watching this stuff on TV.  This collection is presented in full screen format and is 415 minutes in length (about 7 hours).  The picture and sound have both been remastered.  The picture quality in glorious black and white is crystal clear.  The sound is clear as well.  I like all of the shorts in this collection.  These guys came along at the perfect time, during the Depression years of the 1930s.  America needed to laugh at that time.  Really, America needs to laugh now as well, as we're in the midst of another depression.  This collection can certainly help lift your spirits.

My favorite Stooge has always been Curly, but all three guys are great, of course.  From face slapping to head knocks to eye pokes to nose pinching, these guys will entertain you for hours.

3371545,4,B00151QYYE,"The Three Stooges shorts presented here run from January of 1937 with ""Grips,Grunts and Groans"" and end with December of 1939's ""Three Sappy People"".This issue like its' predecessor has been remastered beautifully in a Hi-Def transfer and onto DVD.They have never looked this good...ever.
This second issue sees the Stooges on the rise as far the quality of their material is concerned. While there are many good shorts and sequences up to and including this volume,one can see that many of these films were just stories made up in order to hang gags upon with little or no connection to the next sequence. The fluidity of the stories were improving however but this would be always be a point of contention with The Three Stooges and their shorts. Another drawback was their re-use of footage and gags from previous shorts. Watch the end of ""A Ducking they did Go"".It looks like they ran out of an ending idea and tagged on a clip from a previous short from the first volume in this series;the trouble is it doesn't work. The first short it was used in made sense but here the guys go from clowning around a duck pond in a forest to jumping through brush and onto wild steers in a desert-like area,that cart them away willy nilly. The use of stock footage would plague the Stooges throughout their careers and especially in their later ones in the 50s and really cheapened the laughs. Another thing the Stooges always did was walk a fine line on the hitting and other physical violence;usually instigated by Moe. If executed just right it was funny but if the timing or sequence in which it was done wasn't just right,it was tasteless and definitely non-funny.
No one ever could accuse the Stooges of being hoi-polloi or shooting for the balcony with their style of comedy. It was low comedy with a touch of the Marx Brothers and Mack Sennett thrown together and no one could do it better than Curly,Larry and Moe. Volume Two is the Stooges on the rise and the next volume would see them come into their own. Until then enjoy these ""Three Sappy People"" doing what they do best;being the very funny guys they were.",1274659200,2,2114,4.625
3371546,5,B00151QYYE,"This is a review for the second Three Stooges chronologically ordered two disc set
entitled The Three Stooges Vol 2: 1937-1939.

These two discs contain the 24 comedy shorts that Columbia Pictures released
during the years 1937, 1938 and 1939.  These were the years that the Stooges really
found themselves with titles like ""Healthy, Wealthy and Dumb"" and ""Grips, Grunts and
Groans,"" as well as ""Termites of 1938,""

While hitting their stride the Stooges, like many other classic era comedians, had
fun with the idea if not of finding a profession, at least finding a job.  So many
of these films, like Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp, are about trying to earn a buck
in as comic a way as possible.  And in these films, the Stooges succeed in a fashion
on a par with some of their better known contemporaries.

Sure, some of the bits are repetitive, but these short subjects were not meant to be
watched one after another in your living room, they were meant to be watched in a theater
one at a time with a like minded audience

Again, the Stooges demonstrate amazing variations on the theme of comic revenge.
Revenge on mostly imagined hurts or insults as carried out by Moe to Larry and Curly.
Or revenge carried out by all three Stooges to an unsuspecting world, not that
that world didn't deserve it. Because for the most part it was deserved, ""and how.""

I remember many hours of hilarity watching these guys with my brother when we were kids, and then going to school and emulating some of the slapstick gags that are a hallmark of these classic comedy shorts.  Of course they are stupid and rediculous.  I always thought that was the whole point anyway.  The episodes I have watched so far have been expertly mastered so that they look just like the originals.  I have enjoyed quite a few evenings watching these classics with my son who loves them as much as I did when I was a kid.

3371571,5,B00151QYYE,"A few years after their 1934 Columbia debut, the Three Stooges were hitting their stride in the two-reel comedy field - due in part to the slapstick mastery of director Del Lord. The short subjects in this 1937-39 DVD collection showcase Moe, Larry and Curly at the height of their knucklehead powers. ""Dizzy Doctors,"" ""Wee Wee Monsieur,"" ""Three Little Sew and Sews"" and ""We Want Our Mummy"" remain among the all-time Stooge classics. A few Columbia two-reelers from this period were directed by the underrated Charley Chase, with ""Violent Is the Word for Curly"" a particular standout. Even the lesser efforts - ""Back to the Woods,"" ""Saved by the Belle"" and ""Three Missing Links"" (producer Jules White's directorial debut) - have moments of brilliance thanks to the inimitable Curly Howard, who remains a comedic dynamo. Sony's digital upgrade finally does justice to the Golden Age of Stoogery.",1263427200,2,894,5.08843537414966

In the 1937 episode ""The Sitter Downers"" I have noticed there is a missing scene.  When the Stooges wives tell the stooges to ""build a fire for breakfast while they go to the store"" Curly accidentally burns the plans for the house.  This scene has been cut from the short, but is still referenced later.  Moe tells Larry ""if that puddin' head hadn't have burned the plans we'd have saved plenty of work"".

Considering this is an official release by Sony I was very shocked that there are missing scenes.  Were these just remastered versions of syndicated (cut) episodes?  It makes me wonder what other episodes have scenes cut.

I know its nothing big, but an official release shouldn't have omissions like this.  That's why I only give it four stars instead of five.",1252713600,7,882,4.56687898089172

3371578,5,B00151QYYE,"Sony should be congratulated for finally doing the right thing and releasing all of the Stooge shorts in order, without any lengthy delays between each set, after years of sporadic ""themed"" releases.  This set starts in 1937, when they weren't quite in the classic mode yet, but soon segues into their early classic era.  I once heard it suggested that 'The Sitter-Downers,' their last short of 1937, really marked the beginning of their golden era.  I think I'd have to agree that the transition began somewhere around there, particularly now that we have all of the shorts in order to watch.  This set also contains two of the Missing 60, 'We Want Our Mummy' and 'Three Little Sew and Sews,' the two shorts on here I was most looking forward to seeing since they were among the few Curly shorts I hadn't seen yet.

Once they got into their classic era, they just kept getting better and better, having put all of the final finishing touches on their screen characters, comedic style, and screen relationship.  Some of my favorite shorts on this set are 'A-Ducking They Did Go,' 'Three Missing Links,' 'Flat-Foot Stooges,' 'Three Dumb Clucks,' and 'Violent Is the Word for Curly.'  I've even heard it suggested by some people that the lattermost short contains the world's first music video, since it's a lip-synched performance of a song in video format!  There are a couple of doozies here too, though; 'Back to the Woods' has got to be one of the worst shorts of the Curly era.  I've also never cared too much for 'Grips, Grunts, and Groans,' though at least it's not the awful 'Back to the Woods.'

Again, Sony should be commended for releasing these Stooge sets in such a speedy fashion, and finally releasing the shorts properly.  I do wish there would be some bonus material, but I tend to agree with those who speculate that the bonus material is being saved for the late Shemp and Joe eras, to try to boost up the sales of those less-than-great shorts.",1242345600,2,1962,4.674418604651163

It is fun to watch the group's timing and cinema sophistication grow.  Moe once stated that the secret to a good Stooge short was to put the trio in a situation that they were out of place at - and that included about everything.  From firemen to vets to college professors, this group features the trio in top form.  A great set to watch over and over again as one can see little bits of business evolve from a throw away gag in one short to a major set piece in a later one.  It is also great to see them complete and not whittled away as was the case on most TV broadcasts.  As expected, Moe is bossy; Curly is unpredictable; and Larry is the glue that keeps the team humming... and the shot of Larry floating in a bathtub using balloons while smoking a cigar is still one of the best Stooge sight gags.

These guys were the greatest. Quality of the set is superb. If you have never seen the Stooges, you are in for a real treat. If you are in need of a good laugh (and who isn't these days)I urge you to get this set, curl up with a bowl of popcorn and prepare to laugh yourself silly.

3371639,5,B00151QYYE,"I bought the first collection, and it was so great that I was even more happy to see the second one there to buy! The best shorts which have never even been on DVD, Cash and Carry and The Sitter Downers, are hilarious and should have been out long ago. The appearance of President Roosevelt (an actor, of course) and the Stooges saluting them at the end of Cash and Carry is quite a moment. I highly, highly recommend these collections- it has been far too long to get them ALL, in the right order too!",1228780800,2,502,4.239583333333333
3371640,5,B00151QYYE,"Well ""Three Stooges"" fans can now exhale because Sony Pictures has released the second ""Three Stooges Collection"" volume two from 1937-1939 with the same amazing video and sound quality as found in the volume one set. Once again fans will be happy to find that all 24 shorts in this outstanding two-disc set are in chronological order and In my opinion they're isn't a bad one in the bunch. By 1937-39 the ""Three Stooges"" were finding their groove and the quality of their shorts was a testament that bigger and better things were still to come from the trio.

As a ""Three Stooges"" fan who purchased the first ""Three Stooges Collection"" volume one the 1934-1936 years I wondered if Sony Pictures would continue to release future sets with the same level of quality shorts found in the volume one set or if this was another studio ploy to screw stooge fans out of their hard earned money, yet again. In the past Sony Studios has been famous for releasing products with inferior quality and sometimes canceling future installments for no reason leaving fans with incomplete sets.

Of the 24 shorts presented in volume two many of them really stand out ""Grips, Grunts and Groans"", ""Healthy, Wealthy and Dumb"", ""Three Missing Links"", ""Calling all Curs"" and my personal favorite ""Violent is the Word for Curly"" are filled with hilarious high jinks as only the three Stooges could serve up for their legions of fans. Volume two is also somewhat of a milestone for the Three Stooges as we are treated to the new stooge theme song as first heard in the short ""Flat Foot Stooges"". The debut of ""Three Blind Mice"" melody as the Stooges new theme song, which replaced the ""Listen to the Mockingbird."" theme is a welcomed change and it enhanced the stooge shorts from then on.

Once again Sony Pictures has done an incredible job with the video and sound remastering and they should be commended for their efforts. The digitally remastered video transfers are simply amazing; no longer do these shorts look like they were made over 70 years ago and the completely restored soundtrack is the best I've ever heard. Missing from the newly remastered shorts is the debris, grain, dirt and sound hissing that used to plague these wonderful shorts. The set contains 24 shorts on two single sided discs packaged in slim cases. The disc artwork and packaging is fantastic to say the least, making this set even more attractive and highly collectible for fans to own.

On a final note Stooge Fans will be pleased that these newly remastered shorts are finally presented complete and uncut, politically incorrect and in all they're Black & White splendor for fans to enjoy over and over. Hip Hip Hooray!

3371641,5,B00151QYYE,"After purchasing the first volume of the Three Stooges collection and watching it with family members, I was pleasantly surprised that the second volume was out so soon!  I pre-ordered it as soon as I could and, after viewing each short from 1937-1939, was not disappointed in the least!

The first volume had a few (but ONLY a few) clunker episodes as the Stooges and their directors were still trying to find their niche, but this volume is air-tight in both acting and directing, as the Stooges really find their formula in appealing to the baser instincts of Depression-Era film-goers (as movies were one of the few things they COULD afford for entertainment).

In my opinion, this is (overall) the best volume of the four that have been released so far, as there isn't a bad episode in the bunch.  If you enjoyed the first collection, or just love the Stooges in general, buy this product with confidence that it will give you many hours of side-splitting laughs!",1226448000,,968,4.744047619047619

All the makings of a 5 star release...EXCEPT, unlike the first set, Sony Pictures decided to put their loud and annoying logo between EVERY short. The logo is much louder than the films themselves and can be quite jarring.
I highly recommend this set to any and all fans of The Three Stooges...just keep your finger on the MUTE button when each picture ends.",1224547200,8,490,4.51685393258427

3371646,5,B00151QYYE,"This second release of movie shorts of The Three Stooges is a must buy for all die-hard Stooges fans. Just as in volume one, every short the team made between 1937 and 1939 is here spread out over two discs in the original order in which they were released. They have all been digitally remastered so the sound and picture quality is top notch. Having been a Three Stooges fan since I started watching them as a kid in the 1960s on television, this collection is a real treat.  The Three Stooges were one of the greatest comedy teams in the history of cinematography. Curly Howard was a comedic genius and a true original.  The Three Stooges should have been making full lenth motion pictures instead of these 18-22 minute shorts. Im sure if they did, their motion pictures would have rivaled those of The Marx Brothers and Abbott and Costello. Bravo to Sony Pictures for releasing these disc's. However I think that one master box-set of every movie short the Stooges ever made from 1934 into the late 50s should have been put out a long time ago. The bottom line, if you are a true fan of The Three Stooges, then order this collection from Sony, and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.",1222300800,,1172,4.523584905660377

Having been in the home video manufacturing business (both tape and disc) for many years, the care taken in restoring these comedy classics on DVD is to be commended.  I have a close friend who is a prominent lawyer and also a Stooge fanatic. Over the years he has collected everything available on the Stooges (at considerable cost) all on VHS.  Now he has the DVD's with their dramatically better quality, and a real problem figuring out what to do with 120 videocassettes and all the extra storage area that will be freed up!  For all of you Stooge fanatics who are contemplating a purchase, take it from someone in 'The Biz' and pick up this collection without delay.  Highly reccomended!!",1219968000,3,814,4.771428571428571

I recently bought dvds of the Stooges, only to learn they'll be releasing all the shorts in order from 1934 to...well I hope they release them all, even though the Joe years will be the worst selling set. While some of the gags are repeated often, I still love them. They are always good for a laugh. I like the pace and price they are releasing the sets but the speical features are a mystery. The Stooges have been around for over 70 years and alot of footage can be found on cheaper dvd sets all over the place. I enjoy having all the shorts in order but there is enough Stooge footage out there that could make some really good extras. Overall, well worth the price-considering the Stooges first came on dvd with only 6 shorts for $20 or more and now you pay $20 for 24 shorts or so from year to year.

This collection also features some of the more memorable performances by Curly. The fact that Sony released these in chronological order means that there are no repeats or overlaps. So I hope Sony keeps on restoring and releasing these dubious masterpieces. If you want a good dose of the Stooges, buy this DVD, you won't regret it. Pick up volume one as well while you are at it.

3371705,5,B00151QYYE,"Volume 2 is an improvement over Volume 1, mainly because the Stooges have really hit their stride after having done 19 shorts previous to this. The slapstick is turned up a notch & Curly's routines have now come center stage. This set has 24 shorts that include: Three Dumb Clucks in which Curly has two parts; Goofs & Saddles where they are scouts in the West; Dizzy Doctors that features the infamous Brighto; Termites of 1938, one of their famous exterminator routines; Mutts to You in which they're accused of being a baby snatcher; We Want Our Mummy, their famous skit searching for Pharoh Rootin-Tootin; & Three Sappy People where they are mistaken for three famous psychiatrists. All the routines are outstanding &, unlike the first volume, there aren't any so-so shorts here.

If you want some side-splitting slapstick then Volume Two is for you. It's unfortunate but there isn't any bonus materials, not even captioning. The remastering is excellent though an occasional flaw gets through but nothing that's distracting.",1214784000,2,1029,5.052941176470588

3371707,5,B00151QYYE,"The Three Stooges shorts are FINALLY getting their just due by being released in chronological order and with superb picture quality and sound.
  This is definitely where the stooges hit their stride and each of these comic geniuses developed his individual role in the trio. Moe established himself as the leader who was so sharp with a verbal or physical assault. Larry was the neutral one who mostly reacted to the other two and was usually on the receiving end of Moe's abuse. Finally, we have the quintessential stooge Curly whose comic timing, body language, hilarious facial expressions and unforgettable sayings (e.g. NYUK, NYUK) brought it all together.
  Most of the shorts during this period were directed by Del Lord and Jules White and it can be clearly seen how their presence behind the camera raised the Stooge shorts to a new level of hilarity. From causing a riot in the old West in ""Goofs and Saddles"" to swinging the alphabet in ""Violent is the Word for Curly"" you can be sure that the Stooges will deliver the laughs.
  Keep these collections going because there have been far too many Three Stooges DVDs that were so poorly organized and had the same shorts being released on multiple DVDs.

The restoration on these shorts, as in Volume 1, is absolutely gorgeous.  Some of my personal favorites, like ""The Sitter Downers"" and ""Yes We Have No Bonanza"" are included on this set, with Curly at the height of his numb-skull powers.  With this and the previous collection you can now own 43 out of 190 total classic Three Stooges short subjects in chronological order for an amazing low price in the absolute highest quality, most pristine condition they've been seen in since they were new in theaters.  Again, great work Sony!

As a small trade-off there are no extras or commentaries on these sets.  I would still pay more for these sets if they contained such material, but to be honest most Three Stooges facts and trivia have been revealed and analyzed hundreds of times over during their various TV incarnations and specials over the years.  I say, keep 'em coming just the way they are Sony, please!  I want to own them all!

It's been great finally seeing these shorts in chronological order and being able to notice subtle and not so subtle changes, like the opening theme. The first 8 episodes in Vol 1 all had different opening songs before the verse portion of Listen to the Mockingbird became the official one. In late 1938 and early 1939 Mockingbird flip-flops with 3 Blind Mice before 3 Blind Mice becomes the main theme. I always  preferred Mockingbird myself. As in Vol 1, the picture quality in Vol 2 is great. Vol 3 is also going to be a must have with A Plumbing We Will Go, You Nazti Spy and I'll Never Heil You Again.

And you get 24 shorts for about 20 bucks - a stark contrast to the older Stooge DVDs which would have just 5 shorts for the same price. This period (37-39) arguably captures the Stooges at their best, but everyone has different opinions on that. If it's not their best period, almost everyone would agree it's one of them.

Stooge fans and fans of classic comedy need to buy these so the remaining Stooges shorts get the same treatment. As long as these volumes sell well, we'll see more of them.",1211760000,7,629,4.517543859649122

Their type of physical comedy that they pioneered is the absolute hardest to do.  Jack Black, Jim Carrey, Steve Carrell, Mike Myers, and even the Wayans brothers, all owe their entire careers to this legendary comedy team.
After years of poor transfers and the same repeated shorts on extremely high priced sets of only a few episodes at a time, Sony releases yet another volume of what is hands down the ultimate Stooge fans must-have set.
This treasure trove of shorts, many of which have almost never been aired and have not seen the light of day since their original theatrical exhibition back in the late 1930's, is the only special feature you need.  If you have any younger children or teens that are fans of newer comedians I strongly urge you to introduce them to the men that invented today's type of comedy.  Sure, they might initialy balk at the original Black & White presentation of the shorts, but I can give you a 100% guarantee that once they start watching these legendary masters go to work, they will want to repeatedly visit this wonderful timecapsule of a bygone era that trancends the two tone color of these films.
