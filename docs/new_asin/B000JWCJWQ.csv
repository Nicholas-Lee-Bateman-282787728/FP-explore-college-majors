It is done in a low budget set in what it seems like a living room, along with the instructors quacky ensemble along with a group of students ranging in age which would seem OK, except for the vocal point being on this older woman during the whole practice. It was just wrong on all levels and if perhaps it didn't have the gimmicky outfit and bad music, it could actually be put in use. Too bad, I was looking forward to it...I guess I will stick to my Yoga on the Edge with Sara Ivanhoe...",1271289600,,680,4.159090909090909
8153480,5,B000JWCJWQ,"This DVD is set in a living room or something, but you only see Gurutej & a gong, flowers & curtins behind her & 4 female students of different races & most look between 17-25 & an older woman about 40-50 sitting on mats in front of a brick fireplace with flower & decorations.

This dvd is more set like a class, though the rest of the setup is like her other DVDs. She has the same soft voice, relaxed pace & humor. She explains with great details (but never boring) about the exercise & how it helps your mind & body. In between the 15-20 exercises is short in/out title w/artwork of the next exercise. Music plays when the exercises are done by the studentds.

The exercises are like her others.. kundalini but not hard, fast cardio like Mantra Girl, Ravi Singh/Anna Brett or Gurmukh, more relaxed, but full flexible movements that almost anyone can do.

The workouts are about 60 min with a 6 min seated chanting meditation w/folksy tempo guitar chating music & a 10 min laying down w/her playing crystal bowls & the gong.

Bonus:

Four 6 min meditations with explained hand mudras with beautiful, calming music & beautiful up-close high quality photos are played.

8 minutes on conscious eating & diet.

After doing this, I felt more relaxed & calm & a bit more solid/grounded.

For those who like the way kundalini feels but find the other teachers/dvds too exhausting or looking for something for light days, this would be for you.",1176854400,19,1439,4.571984435797665
