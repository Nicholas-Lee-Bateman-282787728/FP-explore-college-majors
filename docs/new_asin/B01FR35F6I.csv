7751376,3,B01FR35F6I,"Luke (Taylor Bottles) and Jennifer (Emily Goss) move back to her Kansas home town after an incident in Chicago which leads us to believe Jennifer is mentally unstable. Her condescending mother Meridith (Cathy Barnett) is eager to help out her resisting daughter. Soon there are ghosts, but they only seem to effect Jennifer, who also has issues outside of the house. They drag the ghost story on way too long until I thought this was going to be a Rosemary's Baby film which would have been better than where this went, which was nowhere.

The ghosts are explained by Walter, the atheist (Jim Korinke) in a confusing mess that even Jennifer couldn't buy. The ghost seemed to center around the bedroom closet, whose door doesn't fit the door seal due to house settling. And what was with the mute neighbors? Was that supposed to tie into something?

In fact, this movie could illicit some interesting conversation, or even make for a good subject for a school paper to be turned in - especially for a psychology course.

7751385,2,B01FR35F6I,"**some spoilers I guess?  Maybe?**

Something odd about the way this film was shot made it feel low budget, but it engaged in some very compelling bits of subtle, paranoia-laced horror early on, particularly with the way people continuously stared at Jennifer, in a way that could easily just be normal yet when amplified through the uncomfortable eyes of the protagonist, come across almost paranormal in how unsettling it is.

When it does start up with its Haunted House Shenanigans, it tends to do so in a way in some rather straightforward ways, with noises and shadows and visual hallucinations, all done in a style to make it rather unclear as to whether its an actual haunting or all in Jennifer's mind. Certain physical feats (such as a broken wooden door) seem too extreme to just be in her head, but are extremely plausible to actually be just in her head (the door was old and likely damaged from mildew and humidity).

The film does a great job despite its low budget look and feel at hooking you in and keeping you as perpetually tense and paranoid as Jennifer. There seems to be a breakthrough with the character Walter at one point which further adds to the mystery as to whether this is even some manner of ""ghost"" or some other inexplicable phenomenon.

Where it completely falls apart is near the end, in a conversation/expo-dump with Walter, where he goes and explains that it isn't an actual ghost haunting but... ""Energy""

Namely, Jennifer's ""energy"" is like, just so intense, you know, so it, like, manifests in spooky ways.

You see, like, her like ""energy"" like interacts with other people's ""energy"" and other thing's ""energy"" and that causes Jennifer to savagely beat herself up and destroy everything. Because since she wants to not live in the house, her ""energy"" is causing her to self destruct and destroy everything around her in a fitful desire to move out of the house.

Leaving aside the fact that energy doesn't work that way, this pseudo-science ""magic"" feels extremely close to astrology, with the idea that people's ""energy"" or more accurately ""midichlorians"" vibrate in some magic way that cause actual physical effects in the world, which in turn also has magic that interacts with them.  If this were the case, everyone's magic energy would be blinded, deafened, and drowned by the overwhelming nuclear ""energy"" of the sun every single day.",1526774400,,2382,4.8617283950617285

7751406,3,B01FR35F6I,"SPOILERS....

It was an interesting premise: Hateful woman's energy affects everything around her, no matter where she goes. It was interesting that it turned out to be a Future Haunting, she was seeing her ghost/husband everywhere because in the end, he died in the house. But I was irritated, frankly, that such a horrible woman lived, got to keep the baby that she's most likely going to abuse for the rest of his life, while the people who tried to help her, her mother, her husband, the psychic friend all basically had their lives ruined by this woman.

Points for originality in the premise, but I would have preferred that the house killed HER after she gave birth to the baby and then the husband and the baby lived in the house happily forever because the husband always liked the house and the house really never had any reason to dislike him. To have the house kill him right at the end when it clearly had no interest, or any ill will toward him, for the whole movie, just didn't make sense.

This was very boring. No real suspense. No jump scares other than jumping from her constant blood-curdling screams. The only boogie man is a human shadow that shows up from time to time, creeping around the room for a second or two.

The leads husband, (a reject from the casting couch of Twilight 2017?) did his part to make the movie boring by constantly telling his wife to ""STOP THIS!""  Yes, he never believed there was any paranormal activity....but just ABNORMAL activity in her head.

The acting was good and the performance by Emily Goss was by far the best. My only gripe with this film would be the ambiguous ending. The explanation or hint of what may be the cause of what's going on with the home wasn't satisfying and the end involving the husband totally felt out of place or at least confusing. I'm not against ambiguous endings but there is too much unclear regarding the hauntings, was it energy or something else? The energy deal had to be important to the plot because of the emphasis.

7751429,4,B01FR35F6I,"Raised expectations can be poison to a shiny little gem of a movie. Any reviews that seem harsh on this movie must have come from expecting too much. This is actually a brilliant little homemade flick. On a very low budget, with actors who are almost unknown, this is better than it should be. The overall plot, which is fine, is made better by multiple strong performances. Emily Goss is unerringly superb. Jim Korinke as Walter is amazing in a small part that he made into something special. His scenes with Jennifer (Goss) take the movie into a whole different league. Is there a ghost? Are ghosts even real? Or is Jennifer mad? Better yet, is Jennifer a latent telekinetic causing all the ""ghostly activity""? Not answering those questions made this a fun ride. It wasn't boring or a slow burn, but it is a quiet and thoughtful movie. Moments get intense, but the intensity isn't slam bam (much) or gory. It's a creepy ""in your head"" mystery and a steady stream of chilling small things that all add up to disturbing. I liked the directors' guidance and tone here. And a shout out to Taylor Bottles.

7751435,5,B01FR35F6I,"Incredibly interesting film! Found it on Prime while searching for new horror movies to watch - I'm a lifelong horror junkie. This film more under the category of a psychological thriller than horror, with intense and suspenseful scenes, but that's just splitting hairs in genres - it truly fits into a few different ones. When most people see horror, they expect lots of gore and silly jump scares. Maybe that's what some of the other lower reviewers were expecting. This was much deeper than that - kudos to the filmmakers for going out on that limb! Also, great job changing up the typical ""haunted house"" story. My mind ran circles with what was going on - and while at one point I was close (maybe circling the ideas), I still didn't guess it. Makes you think a lot while watching it. I thought the ending shots were wonderfully done and the perfect way to end the film. The little tricks with the camera here and there, the jumpy movements between angles, kept me on my toes. Beautiful work!

Emily Goss is hands-down one of the best actresses I've never heard of. I couldn't take my eyes off her when she was on screen. I'm definitely looking forward to more of her work! In fact, all of the acting was superb, which you don't find all that often in indie flicks. Filmed in Kansas - I kept thinking I recognized the area, and found out it was in Leavenworth! Being a Kansas girl, it made the film all that more enjoyable to me.

7751438,4,B01FR35F6I,"I really liked it. Spooky, the main character is a flawed and relatable person. She is unhappy because she is not allowed autonomy. She didn't want a baby but isn't permitted to come to terms with it. She didn't want to go to Kansas, too bad. She didn't want a damn party, and is shamed for expressing that (seriously, what 7 months pregnant woman DOESN'T want a house full of strangers tramping within days of moving?). This theme continues, she can't even have a good moment with Hermon without her mom reminding her that her favorite times with her daughter was when she got to doll her up and throw her on stage like a performing monkey. The ending isn't resolved, but it seemed right for the film.  You don't actually know if things are going to get better, but that's life.  My only complaint is that fake psychic.

7751440,2,B01FR35F6I,"This movie had some good and bad points.  On the good side, the music track was decent.  The acting was well done, especially by the mother and main character.  However the movie left me feeling very dissatisfied.  The characters were all very unlikable, and I didn't find myself connecting to any of them.  It makes no sense to me that during this entire movie, the mother practically ignored her growing baby, as did the father.  There was just something very off about it.  The husband never showed an ounce of love, compassion, or understanding for his wife, even though he didn't seem particularly evil either.  This wasn't a story that had a protagonist or antagonist, and things were not slowly revealed, as per usual in horror movies.  I think that is why it is so unsatisfying.  A good horror movie will start off happy, with people living a normal life, and will slowly descend into chaos and will eventually come to a conclusion where things are revealed.  The bad horror movies will fumble through without revealing more over time, will not be clear in the ending, and will have no rhyme or reason to them.  I felt like that here.  We sort of felt as though the husband might be overly friendly with the wife's best friend, but that never turns into anything.  There are people at the party who seem like ghosts who are never explained.  There is a woman who talks about her twins who have selective mutism, but nothing comes of that really either, and we never figure anything out about the dark entity in the house (which has to be more than energy, since it has a shape and form, leaving handprints behind and opening doors.  Maybe they are trying to explain this away as a poltergeist, but that word is never mentioned.  I just felt as though there were so many loose ends, so many random things brought up that never were explained, as though the story line splintered off into 10 different directions with no real compass as to where it was going.  As I said, I never felt emotionally connected to any of the characters and I felt that they acted strange towards each other and their new child.  Not my cup of tea at all.",1499817600,2,2139,4.537859007832898
7751441,5,B01FR35F6I,"This is an amazing movie, although it's really more of a psychological drama with an ooky-spooky ghost house setting. If you're here looking for a scary movie in a more classical sense, you will be sorely disappointed by House on Pine Street.

In House on Pine Street, our pregnant protagonist finds herself living in an increasingly tense atmosphere as her ""haunted"" house that everyone else thinks is her imagination drives her to near madness. We never see a real ""monster""/psycho slasher dude/etc. It's always unclear exactly what's going on until the very end (pay attention so you don't miss it!)

If you accept House on Pine Street for what it is, you'll love it. Some of the moments, especially near the end, are incredibly tense. The ending, though ambiguous, is as satisfying as I think you could get from a movie like this. The acting was quite good. The pacing was sort of slow, but the payout is worth it, in my opinion.

This is especially worth a watch if you can get it free on Prime!

The first part of the movie was promising, but the second part ended with some moralistic lecture from a local psychic who was not even a psychic. :) The main character, Jennifer, is not strong enough to speak straight about her needs and wishes, so she let other people decide for her. As a result, she finds herself in a house she does not like and in a situation, she cannot accept.  This, as I understand, leads to a lot of suppressed anger and disappointment, that starts to manifest itself through paranormal events in the house. In the end, I guess, this paranormal energy even helps her to get rid of the husband, so she could return to Chicago (the only thing she wanted).

Yeah, the explanation is that the flippin' house is haunted! Okay, maybe not in this case as the ending was a little ambiguous. Anyway, a decent psychological thriller with not-so-subtle undertones of misogyny. Jennifer's mother treats her with zero respect (until the very end, for whatever reason), her husband is not supportive at all, and she's berated by the psychic chiropractor for her 'attitude.' My question is, in what world does she live that DIY abortion is her only option? Is it the filmmakers' fantasy world? Because, with the arguable exception of Texas, it's still legal in the U.S., at least for the time being, to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. Jennifer is outspokenly unhappy about the direction of her life, and her punishment for not being an accommodatingly cheerful incubator is violently losing someone she loves. Creepy little movie about the worst pregnancy EVER.

8761263,3,B01FR35F6I,"I'm not sure that this should have been placed in the horror file - to me it was more like a 'dark drama' type of film. The plot centers around a woman who's about to have a baby, her meddling mother and her too-skeptical husband. She begins to experience 'disturbances' in her new house - but when she turns to the people closest to her (as most of us would do) for help, they gently chide her and dismiss her concerns as 'pre-birth stress' (including her closest friend). This is pretty much the whole thing - the three go back and forth, each character stubbornly clinging to what they believe is really going on until tragedy hits at the end.
Too many loose ends here; too many questions and not enough explanations at the end. Was there even a spirit in the house at all (if there was then I must have missed them)? What was the history of the house? Why would a good husband (whose wife is 7 months pregnant with their first child) side up with his mother-in-law if his wife was really going through a difficult time? And Walter... what was the point of him being in the story at all, if he was really a fake psychic? To add to the girl's already-overloaded stress levels?
And one more thing. If I was 7 months along, and I had experienced ANYTHING like the lead character did upon moving into a new house, I would be out of there - whether my husband believed me or not. Pack a bag, call a cab - I would gone in a heartbeat. Seriously now: you're about to have a baby (which on its own can be somewhat stressful, due to the  physical changes a woman experiences during pregnancy); you hear strange noises and are creeped out in your new environment, you need to get out of there! The heck with Mom and Sweetheart - you have a child to think about! Too much family drama, and not enough information about the 'ghost' in the house. Not bad, but it didn't have that spine-tingling, skin-crawling effect I look for in movies like this.",1534636800,,1938,4.338842975206612
8761264,5,B01FR35F6I,"The reviews for this film are very mixed, but as a fan of horror (esp haunted house and possession films) I found it to be a small, fascinating, excellent production that is about psychological terror not always supernatural in nature, following a long line of female gothic narratives in both fiction and film. Our protagonist, Jennifer (or Jennie, depending upon who is addressing her--this seems an important detail in terms of her own agency and those who diminish it with a little girl's nickname) is a woman whom no one listens to--not her mother, not her husband, not even her best friend--and who is trapped in a situation she literally cannot escape from, at the center of which is an unwanted pregnancy. The central question is whether the house is independently malevolent, or if Jennifer is controlling events--or perhaps somewhere in between, i.e., Jennifer's own wishes and frustrations that drive what Walter, the fake psychic, calls the negative ""energy"" already present in the house. This uncertainty, for me, is what makes the film effective. In particular, I wa struck by the scene late in the film in which Walter verbally abuses her, shouting: ""You hate everything. Why are you still here? Why don't you LEAVE?"" Directly thereafter, one of the major tragedies in the film happens, which does, in fact, allow Jennifer to leave. Here the previously hapless Walter (who we learn has his own melancholy for a lost loved one, but who is a failed medium who can't connect with that loved one), communicates his own violent anger toward Jennifer, echoing the real-life desire of some men that women would just ""disappear,"" apparent in the high incidence of violent crimes in our society against pregnant women, committed by someone they know. Another striking moment that brings together Jennifer's own frustrations/abuse and that of the supernatural forces of the house is when she yells ""STOP"" at a critical point in the house's violence against her. Here, she takes control of her surroundings (the house stops its abuse of her) just as her body goes out of her control (her water breaks).  I don't think it's too much of a stretch to see this as a rape allegory, and Jennifer fighting back against her attacker. Given that we know nothing about the actual circumstances of her pregnancy (was it accidental? did Luke somehow compel her to conceive against her wishes? did she think she wanted a baby but then changed her mind), this scene is all the more powerful.

Like other reviewers, I would like more on some other elements in the film--such as the mysterious twins next door, though I see their mother's tragic story (as she tells it to Jennifer) as another version of Jennifer's future that she is being compelled to accept, one marked by silence and loneliness as a parent. Jennifer's best friend has an apparently happy situation as a mother, though it is Brad who ""sees"" the ghosts in the house, and it is her friend who openly laments the work of motherhood. In both of those stories, there is no apparent father, which is interesting given how terrible Jennifer's husband Luke reveals himself to be. Ultimately this is a film that owes obvious debt to Rosemary's Baby (in one shot in which Luke and Jennifer's mother guide her down the hall, an actual visual debt), The Yellow Wallpaper, and a host of other fiction and film titles in which a woman's body is made to be out of her own control and which the horror is not supernatural, but all-too real (Malefecent is an interesting predecessor here). The portrayal of Jennifer's own apparent breakdown, and the discussions of her previous breakdown, combined with the circumstances and aftermath of the birth of her son late in the film, are potentially more terrifying than any of the numerous effective, subtle special effects that portray the more traditional horror of ghosts in haunted houses. In short, this film is not about a haunted house but rather a haunted life--as Jennifer says, ""The house is in my head.""",1534032000,,3998,4.88659793814433
8761265,4,B01FR35F6I,"This was a very good haunting story. Very entertaining. Looking at many of the other reviews I see that many people are expressing frustrations that the main character is not a stronger female heroine type, willing to stand up for herself more affectively against her over-bearing mother and loser husband. However, I think that this was an important aspect of the plot in and of itself. The important aspect is that she isn't in control of anything. A baby has taken over her body. Spoiler alert: she even attempted an abortion back in Chicago and was unable, for whatever reason to pull that off. She's been moved, practically against her will, back to the town in KS, where she grew up. Her over-bearing mother is now close by and able to better manipulate her. Her husband is a weak cup of tea that the mother is further manipulating and a couple of allusions where made that the mother & the husband may actually be having an affair! Now an opportunistic entity is also joining in on the bullying of the main character. Good fun.",1532995200,,1034,4.625
8761266,5,B01FR35F6I,"This was very good, and left you wondering if it was all psychological or really a haunting. I don't know why this doesn't have a higher rating---I guess too many wanting overexaggerated gore. The main actress did a good job, the neighbor was very monotone and odd, I understand she's supposed to be but it felt amateur and the main character's mom was a b**ch and the husband a d**k but it made for an interesting movie..",1531872000,,422,4.4935064935064934
8761267,3,B01FR35F6I,"So this is a pretty decent run of the mill ghost story as far as they go, especially for one that's not a big budget film. However, the main character ""Jennifer"" is one of the most unlikeable characters I've ever seen in a movie.  You have no reason to feel compassion for her cause she's a bit of a bitch and just not someone you would like in real life.  I understand that she is an offshoot of her mother who is the same way, but watching this i just couldn't help but dislike her the whole time.  As a main character she really has no redeeming qualities and it was so off putting.  I believe that the main component in most movies is that in some way you can feel a connection with the character, good or bad.  There are lots of bad guys in movies we all like, and lots of good guys (and gals) - but she is just  plain unlikeable.  I am sure the actress playing the part is a sweetheart and for that she could get an oscar, 'cause if she was supposed to play unlikeable - kudos.",1530403200,,983,4.062176165803109
8761268,4,B01FR35F6I,"The creepy factor of this movie is right on target.  The acting was good and the way the story was told kept me guessing all the way through.  It might have been a 5 star movie but I was left unsatisfied with the ending.  There didn't really seem to be an ending, or at least no good reason for the things that had been happening in the house.  (I reject the one possibility that was given that didn't fit the facts.)  Even with my dissatisfaction with the lack of a story behind the haunting, I still enjoyed the movie and will likely watch again.",1530403200,,548,4.230769230769231

There is never a why given. Or any reasoning behind any of it, which is totally frustrating. Who cares about any of it if we aren't ultimately made to understand why? The mother character was insufferable and the creepy chiropractor/not-really-a-medium was very bizarre. The lead actress was a total doormat - taking everyones crap and then some. What could have been a great thriller fell totally flat.",1530230400,,523,4.811111111111111
