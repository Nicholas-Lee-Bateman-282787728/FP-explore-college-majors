7797275,4,1571203907,"This DVD is a great instructional for beading on fabric, I really did learn from her step by step visual instruction, better than a book for me.  I just would like to see beading on a stuffed doll, that is one of my reasons for purchasing this DVD.  Didn't get that instruction.  I can still use all the information shared here, so I still feel it was a good buy.",1251676800,3,363,4.1571428571428575
7797276,4,1571203907,"This is a wonderful book for learning how to bead on fabric. It is very detailed on all the items you will need, especially helpful for the new beader. I was very impressed.  But, my DVD was faulty halfway through so I couldn't see the last half of it.  I got another one, but that was faulty too.  I would like to get a new one, but I'm a little leary to try. Do you have any suggestions!!!!!!!Deloris Christianson",1174867200,7,415,4.227848101265823
7797277,4,1571203907,"If you're a visual learner, you will be thrilled with Mary Stori Teaches You Beading on Fabric. It's a 90-minute DVD that will take you through all the steps to successful beading (embellishing) on fabric.

Mary doesn't take anything for granted. She assumes her students want to learn from the beginning and she gives us the basics from the different types of beads and their finishes, the necessary tools, the various knots, to the stitches themselves. Each bit of information is delivered slowly (so we beginners can 'get it') and in a clear and concise manner. It's like having a personalized and private lesson with a pro.

I found the information on how to determine if a bead is colorfast easy and helpful. And I learned the value of stabilizing the fabric with other fabric, using atting or a frame. She discusses the best way of sewing, how to store the beads while you're working and so much more. Each tip and technique given will make sewing easier and much more fun.

The Quilt Gallery was stunning and I wanted to head for my studio and get my supplies organized so I could begin my next project. The great thing about Mary Stori Teaches You Beading on Fabric is that my private lesson is never over. If I forget something, or if I'm not sure about a technique, I can pop the DVD in and watch it again and again, until I've got it right.

Armchair Interviews says: Stori's DVD is a keeper for your creative project library.",1158537600,12,1437,4.558139534883721
