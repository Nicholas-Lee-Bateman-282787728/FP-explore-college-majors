663974,4,6303451578,"I enjoyed the powerful performances turned in here by Miss Powers and Miss Bankhead.  Bankhead appears to be having a ball as a bible-spewing nut case, who proceeds to torture the daylights out of her deceased son's ex-fiancee after she comes for a friendly visit.  The beautiful Stefanie Powers is perfect as the tormented prisoner of the wicked old battle-ax.  A very good ending as well.  A movie well worth your viewing time.  Keep an eye out for Donald Sutherland as a dim-witted servant.",1011830400,16,493,4.821428571428571
663975,4,6303451578,"Die! Die! My Darling! is a great movie. The basic story is that this chick (Stefanie Powers as Pat) goes to pay her belated condolences to the mother of a man she was once engaged to (mother being Tallulah Bankhead as Mrs. Trefoile), but who had died. The mother..., decides to hold Pat captive after learning about her plans to marry (or remarry, since Mrs. Trefoile considers Pat and her son to be married in the eyes of the lord). Sinner, repent! So, Mrs. Trefoile keeps Pat a prisoner, on a diet of scripture and not much else. Bankhead is great as a fundamentalist who is so fundamental she's in a religion all her own! If you want your supper in her house, you better get down on your knees, bow your head and sit through about 20 verses of scripture. And then, if you're lucky, you'll get a miniscule portion of some bland concoction. Remember, the Lord wants us to lead simple lives!
In light of her personal life, the fact that Tallulah Bankhead plays a religious fanatic is just so ripe with irony. Her performance, while not up there with the old hag horror movies of Crawford and Davis, is still pretty solid and surprisingly not as campy as I expected. Yeah, if you didn't know who Tallulah was, you might not detect the booze-drinking (even on the set of this film), ...lady that she was. Also of note is a young Donald Sutherland as a mentally handicapped servant at the Trefoile house.",1002758400,7,1401,4.4980392156862745
663976,5,6303451578,"Let's make this clear right from the start: I LOVED ""Die! Die! My Darling!"" Not only does ""Die!"" contain (in my opinion) Tallulah Bankhead's finest on-screen performance, it also showcases a very young and sprightly Stefanie Powers, in her best screen-turn, to date! I'd read about this film in ""Famous Monsters of Filmland"" but never had a chance to see it until a few years back. It's everything I thought and more! ""Mod"" Patricia (Powers) is visiting England and feels she must drop in on poor withered Mrs. Trefoile (Talloo). Mrs. Trefoile, you see, is the mother of Pat's dead fiance, Stephen. Pat, feeling sympathy for the old bat, decides to pay her respects...before stealing off with her new fiance for a roll in the hay. Ah, but Mrs. Trefoile has other ideas! She's a religious fanatic, you see, someone who conducts Bible studies that would make Tammy Faye Baker cry ""uncle!"" When Pat arrives, the terror begins! Not for the squeamish, and Talloo is in top form! Watch for Donald Sutherland as a loony handyman...he plays a very convincing moron!  All in all, ""Die! Die! My Darling!"" is a fine example of Hammer Studios horror--the VHS transfer is beautiful, and I simply cannot wait for the DVD!  This is definitely IT, dahlings!",994723200,8,1241,4.821596244131455

This Gothic chiller from  Britain's Hammer Films is one of the studio's finest psychological  thrillers richly enhanced by the mighty Bankhead's macabre, all-out  portrayal which makes this film rank right up there with PSYCHO/BABY JANE,  and the other popular shockers of its day.

A young Stefanie Powers is very pretty but bland, the yin to Tallulah's yang, if you like.

664140,3,6303451578,"I'm glad I rented Die! Die! My Darling! before I bought a copy sight unseen . I nearly did just that too . This is the first and only Hammer picture I've seen where I was terrifically underwhelmed . Don't get me entirely wrong though . As a Hammer completist , I'd spend a VERY modest sum to own this particular entry (new)  . Prices are going to have to plummet though .
Admittedly , I'm no authority on Ms. Bankhead . I've probably never seen another film of hers . She's good here . My problems lay elsewhere . The whimsical soundtrack strikes me as wholly inappropriate . I also feel it's a stretch having an average sized , feminine women overwhelm and strong-arm our fit and youthful protagonist (Ms. Powers) . When a gun first appears on screen , wielded as it is by a senior citizen , my lack of interest truly took flight . The requisite older fellow (a marksman with no reason for being so in the plot) forever crudely trying to shag the entrapped woman through negotiation . The retarded fellow always , with grating consternation and (there again) whimsically , spilling the beans (Donald Sutherland) .
Enough already . You get the picture (or should via rental) . It was , most assuredly , not my cup of tea . Ms. Powers looks gorgeous as always . Having just seen Ms. Powers in the far superior Crescendo (Hammer films) with James Olson , this strikes me as mediocre , warmed over comedy/drama . Do buy Crescendo (and fast) as the price is spectacular . Read an excellent review of Crescendo at Cinema Retro . (7-31-14) .",1406764800,,1535,4.424028268551237

I don't like to go on about a film too much, but the stage play ""Looped"" is actually written about a scene in this film that needed to be looped as the dialogue from a part of the film needed to be clarified. Valerie Harper gave ""Looped"" great justice on stage recently, and the role was assumed later by Stephanie Powers, who was in the actual film being portrayed. How amazing.

We also see a young Donald Sutherland in this film, the premise is precise and unpredicted. The outcome is out of the blue.

664189,3,6303451578,"DIE! DIE! MY DARLING! (aka ""Fanatic"") was Hammer Studios' most offbeat thriller.  Operating like a bizarre cross between ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" and ""Carrie"", it gave legendary Tallulah Bankhead (""Lifeboat"") her final big-screen hurrah; and co-starred Stefanie Powers as the young woman in peril.

Pat Carroll (Stefanie Powers) decides to take an afternoon to visit the mother of her dead one-time fiance, Mrs Trefoile (Tallulah Bankhead) at her run-down house in the English countryside.  What starts out as a pleasant housecall soon dissolves into a nightmarish ordeal as Pat is taken hostage, the aim to ""cleanse"" Pat's soul in order for her to be reunited in the next world with Trefoile's son.  Soul cleansing apparently involves being tied up in an attic for several days, starved, tortured, beaten and preached to by Bible-thumping Trefoile--Mrs Margaret ""Carrie"" White would be so proud--and her small, scrappy band of helpers (Yootha Joyce, Donald Sutherland and Peter Vaughan).

It's a nasty, gritty thriller; full of sweat and menace and entirely different from other films being made by Hammer during this period, which tended more towards glossy Victorian-era thrillers.  Mrs Trefoile is a dream role for any actress with camp sensibilities, and Ms Bankhead delivers appropriately.  Stefanie Powers is a worthy adversary, although her strange pseudo-British accent in the initial scenes is quite distracting.

A must for anyone who enjoys Hag Cinema (ie: movies like ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"", ""The Anniversary"", ""Trog"", ""Strait-Jacket"").",1243555200,3,1569,5.508333333333334
664190,5,6303451578,"I hope Tennessee Williams got a percentage when they released this Hammer horror film, because it's pretty much the exact same story as SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER, just changed a little to accommodate the limited acting range of my favorite, Stefanie Powers.

You'll remember SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER in which Elizabeth Taylor is clapped in a mental hospital awaiting a lobotomy, under the dire eye of Violet Venables (Katharine Hepburn).  Taylor is a mess, but mostly she's in shock from the trauma of having gone to Mexico with Sebastian, Hepburn's adored and now deceased son.  In DIE DIE MY DARLING (in England known as FANATIC), Powers is an American girl in England who takes the trouble to pay one last courtesy call to Tallulah Bankhead, the mother of her dead fiance, the man Powers was supposed to marry before his mysterious death.  At the bottom of each picture, the secret remains the same, the homosexuality of the dead boy, the imprisonment and brainwashing of the girl who knows too much about it, and the anger of the mother who had her boy taken away from her, with all the promise of the dynasty continuing disappearing with him.

In each case Powers and Liz Taylor have a male champion who rides in at the last minute to save them from the evil mother's lobotomy/forced Christianity threat.  Taylor had Montgomery Clift, as the psychiatrist more and more drawn to his patient, while Powers is now engaged to a second Englishman, this one much more manly.  The freaks of the mental hospital who menace Taylor throughout the middle scenes of SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER have their own equivalents in the servants staffing Tallulah Bankhead's giant Tudor mansion in the Cornish countryside, including Dinald Sutherland as a true Igor type.

Stefanie Powers has one fantastic outfit after another, except that Tallulah Bankhead objects to jewelry, mirrors, even salt and pepper in her evangelical madness, so little by little Stefanie (as Pat Carroll) is required to look more and more prim and proper, though the inmates bash her around so much all her clothes are ripped and sleazy.  Eventually some secrets of Bankhead's past emerge, and apparently she used to be an actress of some sort, for she owns about 50,000 glossy headshots of Tallulah Bankhead in her glamorous 1920s and 1930s days when Bankhead was queen of the West End and a Paramount contract star.  I never figured that one out but one look at Bankhead's secret atelier of glamor, her den of self-worship, would have presumably turned her little son Stephen gay back in his vanished childhood, and so maybe she is acting out of guilt, the way that, in SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER, at a certain point Katharine Hepburn realizes that the whole Mexican mess where the young boys eat Sebastian might have had something to do with her own faults as a mother.  I don't know, it's sort of blame the victim time!  In any case, everyone, even Donald Sutherland as Igor, out-acts our heroine Stefanie Powers, and yet we root for her escape with great fervor.",1210032000,4,3007,4.8515625
664191,5,6303451578,"Die! Die! My Darling is a well done albeit somewhat campy film from the mid 1960s that looks a bit tamer today than it probably did when it was first released. Nevertheless, we get stunning performances from the great Tallulah Bankhead, Stefanie Powers and Peter Vaughan; and the suspense builds up very well.

The action starts when Pat Carroll (Stefanie Powers) arrives in England to meet her fianc, Alan Glentower (Maurice Kaufmann). Pat insists that she must have a final meeting with her former fiancs mother, Mrs. Trefoile (Tallulah Bankhead). Alan doesn't like it; but Pat insists--you get the impression that Pat is used to getting her way. Pat drives off in Alan's car to meet Mrs. Trefoile--and when she arrives at Mrs. Trefoile's, the REAL action starts.

Mrs. Trefoile turns out to be a fanatical religious zealot who's also just plain crazy; she holds lengthy Bible meetings and ultimately imprisons Pat against her will when she finds out Pat wasn't going to marry her late son Stephen. Pat tries desperately to fight and escape; but Mrs. Trefoile and her ""staff"" are remarkably adept at keeping Pat locked up. Pat is even forced to write a letter to Alan explaining that she is detained so that he doesn't get suspicious and go to the Trefoile residence to see what's going on there.

Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. Does Alan try to go after Pat or does he believe her letter? If Alan doesn't come, will anyone save Pat from a likely death? What about Mrs. Trefoile--will she really murder someone with the gun she always carries around with her? No spoilers here, folks, you'll have to watch the movie to find out the answers.

The cinematography works best in the scenes where Pat is running outside to try to escape as she is chased by Harry (Peter Vaughan), one of Mrs. Trefoile's servants. The choreography works well in the scenes in which Pat struggles to be free of her captors.

Unfortunately, the DVD has no real extras to mention. All we get is three trailers for Mr. Sardonicus; Straight-Jacket; and Homicidal. Oh, well. The movie is so good that I will overlook this disappointment; this movie really held my attention well.

Overall, Die! Die! My Darling! Has a great plot that gives us some camp mixed in with a horror flick about imprisonment, torture and insanity. Tallulah Bankhead acted brilliantly and she truly carried the film. Look for some great performances from Stefanie Powers and Peter Vaughan as Pat Carroll and Harry the servant respectively; and honorable mention goes to a young Donald Sutherland playing a mentally handicapped man who works on Mrs. Trefoile's estate.

I highly recommend this film for fans of horror films, fans of camp and the actors in this movie, too. This was Tallulah Bankhead's last movie; and she went out in grand style!

664261,3,6303451578,"Die!, Die!, My Darling! (Silvio Narizzano, 1965)

How can you not like any movie called Die! Die!, My Darling!? Especially when it contains Tallulah Bankhead's final onscreen performance, as a religious wingnut determined to preserve the purity of her dead son by imprisoning his former fianc&eacute;e, Pat (Stefanie Powers), in her secluded house. Pat, however, is engaged again, and new fianc&eacute;e Alan (The Abominable Dr. Phibes' Maurice Kaufmann) is sure to notice her disappearance eventually. (Isn't he? You never know, this IS a Hammer horror film, after all.)

Ah, the scenery-chewing! Powers and Bankhead are great foils for one another, with Bankhead lording it over Powers (and the rest of her equally insane household) while Powers tries to find various methods of escaping, getting a note to Alan, or anything else that might help her out of her jam. There are other characters of note-- specifically, rising star Donald Sutherland in one of his early roles for Hammer-- but the movie would be just as fun if it were just Bankhead and Powers in one room. No one will ever confuse this for immortal cinema, but if you happen to catch it on the Saturday afternoon creature feature, you'll find it a pleasant surprise. ***",1178841600,3,1236,5.024390243902439

But I don't know if they meant it or not, but they actually got a lot more than the sum of it's parts. Despite the rather sleazy script and some cheesy effects, we have a believable performance from Stefanie Powers as in danger girl (really, we have had too much exposure to Ripley and Buffy- if someone showed up casually firing a handgun near your cranium, you'd cower too!) paying a duty visit to the mother of her recently deceased boyfriend, played in a really surfing-the-edge performance by Tallu.  As the demented religion-crazed Mrs Trefoyle, Tallulah is by turns delicate, regal, trashy, insane, sexy, ludicrous and commanding. In her later years, she's unconstrained from the 30's idea that she had to be the American Dietrich, and she commits to film the sort of daring performance she did on stage that made one reviewer comment he'd go to her plays because she was always skating on thin ice- and he wanted to see if she'd fall through.",1121731200,15,1173,4.889447236180905

664267,4,6303451578,"After the release of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) terrified viewing audiences (and raked in the dough), homicidal murderers became the soup de jour for exploitationeers as crazed crackpots, lunatic liquidators, erratic executioners, berserk butchers, and deranged death dealers flooded the silver screen, all in an attempt to entertain and cash in on what most of us wanted, that being a jolly good fright.  Within the genre, studios found women could be just as scary (sometimes even more so) as men, which helped revive the careers of a few starlets, thought past their prime, the most famous being Bette Davis (What Ever Happened to Baby Jane, Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte) and Joan Crawford (Straight-Jacket), but one shouldn't overlook the performance of one Ms. Tallulah Bankhead (Lifeboat) in her last on screen role as Mrs. Trefoile in the Hammer Studios produced Die! Die! My Darling! (1965) aka Fanatic.

The film, adapted for the screen by none other than Richard Matheson (The Incredible Shrinking Man, House of Usher, Pit and the Pendulum, The Legend of Hell House), was directed by Silvio Narizzano (Georgy Girl) and stars, along with Ms. Bankhead, Stefanie Powers (Hart to Hart).  Also appearing is Peter Vaughn (Straw Dogs), Maurice Kaufmann (The Abominable Dr. Phibes), Yootha (sounds like a character from a Godzilla film) Joyce (A Man for All Seasons), along with a youngish Donald Sutherland (Kelly's Heroes) as Joseph, the mildly retarded, almost ghoulish looking groundskeeper.

As the film opens, we see a smart young couple, Alan (Kaufmann) and Patricia (Powers), traveling in an even smarter looking coupe.  They just arrived in England by boat, and are soon to be married.  Thing is, Patricia had been engaged before, although her betrothed, Stephen, died in mysterious circumstances, and Patricia promised to visit Stephen's mother, Mrs. Trefoile (Bankhead), if she ever made it to the British Isle, very much against Alan's wishes, but it is something Patricia feels she must do in order for her to move on with her life.  She makes her way through the English countryside, coming upon a rather large, slightly dilapidated house, home to Mrs. Trefoile and her few servants.  Initially coming for a short visit, Patricia finds herself spending the night (and more) as Mrs. Trefoile sees it as her duty to `cleanse' Patricia's wicked spirit, making her suitable for her dead son (you see, Mrs. Trefoile believes engagement and marriage are the same thing in the eyes of the Lord, so they're actually related now, even though Patricia never married her son).  Creepy stuff, huh?  It gets worse...Patricia tries to leave, but Mrs. Trefoile will have none of that, and locks Patricia in the attic, so that she may infuse the spirit of the Lord into her soul, through a steady diet of starvation and scripture (if it weren't for tough love, I'd have no love at all).

One thing I noticed right away about Die! Die! My Darling! is a really well done and intelligent script, infused with slight touches of humor and a sense of realism built into the characters through careful and fairly meticulous development.  Also, I thought all the actors did a fine job, especially Ms. Bankhead, who really acted her wrinkled behind off presenting a domineering character whose motivations seemed murky at best (is it salvation she seeks for Patricia and ultimately her son Stephen, or revenge?)  Her religious zealotry seemed genuine (she doesn't use any condiments, not even salt, as she believes food shouldn't be `adorned' and eaten as God intended...mirror, mirror on the wall...wait, there are no mirrors...oh yeah, they promote vanity you dirty sinner) and thoroughly realistic (similar to Piper Laurie's character in the Brian DePalma's 1976 film Carrie), while in a lesser movie it would have come off as silly, one dimensional, and less than believable.  She wasn't necessarily evil, but her belief was so strong and all encompassing that she felt what she was doing was right (delirious dementia can be the most dangerous, fearsome kind of monster of all).  I really loved the fact the she was even too `religious' for her own church, preferring to hold services within her own home as she found the rector to be an unsavory sort since he remarried after the passing of his first wife.  I thought Stefanie Powers also did very well, struggling to escape, finding herself being drawn deeper and deeper into the morass of Mrs. Trefoile's `tough love' campaign.  I felt sorry for her, for her predicament, but also because she seemed to spend a lot of time getting slapped around.  Even the secondary characters were developed nicely, presenting suitable reasoning for their enduring the lifestyle forced upon them by their mistress (well, except for Joseph, who really needed no development as his was a life of simplicity, blissful ignorance, doing what he was told, subsisting mainly off the charity of others...and what was up with that maid?  She was like freakishly strong...oh yeah, if you like `cat' fights, there's a decent one in here).  Narizzano's direction suited the story well, and he kept the story going, delivering the goods at the appropriate time, and building on the tension an suspense inherent within the story.  I really liked the austere house most of the story took place in, and thought it was used well to complement the film as a whole.  Yeah, the film is camp, but pure and unadulterated (just like Mrs. Trefoile likes her food) camp.

Presented here is a really good looking wide screen (1.85.1) print, re-mastered in high definition.  The picture is clear, but I did notice some minor white `speckling', probably due to age deterioration.  The Dolby Digital 1.0 sound is quite good, but English subtitles are available for the hard of hearing.  The special features are surprising few, with only three trailers (none for this film), all William Castle films in Mr. Sardonicus (1961), Straight-Jacket (1964), and Homicidal (1961).

664268,5,6303451578,"DIE DIE MY DARLING was one of Hammer's diversions into ""psychological horror"", and it is a very interesting and well-made film.  Scripted by the talented Richard Matheson, the story unfolds lazily, although we know the minute Stefanie Powers meets the irrepressible Tallulah Bankhead, the fun is about to start.  Bankhead's remarkably smoky voice propels this fanatical old woman, and her performance is remarkably restrained; I think she did better in some ways than Bette or Joan in their ""horror"" movie days.  I actually came to hate the woman with each ridiculous dependence on her Biblical reasoning for tormenting Powers.  Powers herself does an excellent job in going from the sweet young thing to the venomous hussy who wants to tell Bankhead exactly what kind of girl she is.  Yootha Joyce as Anna, and Peter Vaughan as her lecherous husband Harry, are very good in supporting roles; Donald Sutherland's idiot role demonstrates what a versatile actor he was going to be.
The film's opening credits, with the cat chasing the mouse, and the unusually bouncy jazz score, indicate that what's about to happen is being done tongue in cheek; yet the movie has a dark underlying evil that crescendos into a descent into madness.
This is a good, sturdy film.",1079222400,7,1259,5.0047846889952154
664269,5,6303451578,"Stefanie Powers is Patricia ""Pat"" Carroll, a beautiful young american woman visiting England with her fiance. While there, she decides to keep a promise she'd made to her late boyfriend's mother (Tallulah Bankhead) and pay her a visit. Bad idea! You see, mum is actually a hyper-religious maniac who's been going increasingly bonkers in her moldering old mansion. Pat arrives and the fun begins. Mrs. Trefoile (mum) is distressed by Pat's attitude and worldly ways. She had figured that Pat would remain a devoted ""wife"" to her dead son, saving herself for him in heaven. Pat does not measure up to mum's expectations at all! So, with the help of her housekeeper Anna (Yootha Joyce) and Anna's lecherous husband Harry (Peter Vaughan), mum sets out to ""save"" Pat by kidnapping, starving, and torturing her with hours of monotonous bible teachings. When Pat finally stands up to her, mum pulls a gun on her! Now, THAT'S some old time religion! Pat's clothes are shredded, her make-up destroyed, and her jewelry confiscated. Mum has a ""simpler"" life in store for her. Thankfully, Pat is not a complete mush, and does try to escape many times. Her character is fairly realistic and sympathetic. Mrs. Trefoile is of course the demented center of this story. Her hidden basement room contains the truth of her existence. What's in there? Why does she go there late at night? DIE! DIE! MY DARLING! is a tense cat and mouse flick with some nice sharp turns. I loved every minute! Check out Donald Sutherland as the gardener! Highly recommended...",1076112000,5,1538,4.896551724137931
664270,5,6303451578,"This is a film that is great fun if you like Tallulah Bankhead and camp. Bankhead didn't make very many films, especially in her later years, but she did this one basically for the money and because other distinguished actresses (Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Olivia de Havilland, etc.) were making horror films.
In ""Die, Die, My Darling"", a Hammer production (originally titled ""Fanatic"" in England where it was filmed), Tallulah plays a religious zealot who cannot get over the death of her son. When her son's former fiancee (Stephanie Powers) arrives to pay her a visit, she becomes more and more enraged when she finds that Powers has participated in all kinds of ungodly things like falling in love again and heaven forbid, wearing make-up! She then traps Powers in her attic where she torments her. It's all quite over the top, offering a minimum of suspense, but it is, nevertheless, quite entertaining.
Bankhead filmed the movie just a few years before she died. She was plagued by a number of health problems at the time (most of them caused by too much drinking and smoking). She wears no make-up, her hair was dyed gray and put in a bun and there were many harsh, unflattering close-ups. Before the film was released, it was shown to Tallulah and a small audience of her friends. After her first scene, she stood up and told everyone, ""Darlings, I must apologize for looking older than God's wet nurse.""
""Die, Die, My Darling"" is a hoot to watch. The role had to have been 180 degrees from Tallulah herself, but she pulls off the role flawlessly. She delivers Bible verses in her sonorous voice in a rapid-fire manner. Her double takes, as in response to Powers appearing in red dress and red lipstick, are hilarious. It was Tallulah's only appearance in a color film and she is practically unrecognizable except for her distinctive voice, which gives her away.
It is great to see this film restored to dvd. The picture has never been sharper - you can actually see a fly buzzing around Tallulah in one scene where she is lying on her bed! The film featured a muted color palette and they appear true and not saturated. The sound (Dolby Digital monaural) is decent for a film over 40 years old. The extras are a disappointment though and feature only three trailers (""Homicidal"", ""Strait Jacket"" and ""Mr. Sardonicus"").",1061337600,32,2328,4.750617283950617

7848687,4,6303451578,"I enjoyed this 1965 horror film that starred Tallulah Bankhead in her only color film, looking old - she died soon after filming the movie from too much alcohol and smoking. Ironically, she plays a crazed religious zealot in the film who is opposed to anything relating to enjoying life, including drinking, smoking, and even seasoning foods and the color red. She even feels that her minister is not religious because he married a second time two years after his first wife died; she feels that once married, one is married forever. She believes, wrongly, that her son died as a virgin and is waiting for the last woman he dated, who she feels is so close to her son as if the two were husband and wife, and her son is waiting in heaven for his wife to join him. The woman is played very well by Stefanie Powers. The old woman feels that Stefanie is not pious enough and imprisons her and tries to force her to become pious.",1495756800,,925,4.415204678362573
