2613879,2,B000GI3KGW,"Be Careful... I was thinking i had order the MOVIE, But, I got the PLAY instead...It was horrible .... BUT, the MOVIE is wonderful....",1233532800,,134,4.625
2613880,4,B000GI3KGW,"Frist, if you don't like ribald black comedy, this is not for you.  If you don't like a lot of soulful singing about the Lawd, this is not for you.  Out of the three plays, I enjoyed ""Madea Goes to Jail"" the best.  What I found riveting and so, so true was her/his advice to the nephew about love and relationships.  I think Tyler Perry is my soulmate because every word of advice he spoke, I have said, thought and lived by the very same...from the ""letting it go to the leaves and seasons.""

Now about the singing.  It can get a little long and drawn out with the testifying and sanctifying, but I did enjoy the ""back in the day"" solos.  One of the cast members will really shock you with his rendition of Frankie Beverly's ""Before I Let You Go.""  And Cheryl ""Pepsi"" Riley does a great job doing one of Chaka Khan's tunes. Oh, and Tyler can do a lil sumpin, sumpin, too!

If you don't want to sit through the entire play, just fast forward to the ""counseling"" scene to hear some good, common-sense advice about love and relationships.  You will learn something or you better ask somebody!",1168300800,7,1090,4.351485148514851
2613881,5,B000GI3KGW,"The plays are funny and make you think about your own life. Great story.

I watch them over and over. I have the DVD Collection.  Tyler Perry is Brilliant.",1166054400,4,155,4.310344827586207
2613882,4,B000GI3KGW,"The Tyler Perry Collection: 3 Pack DVD Collection contains ""Madea Goes to Jail"" ""Why did I get Married"" and ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman; The Play"". I personally liked the Madea goes to jail and Why did I get married much because they both made me laugh a lot while spilling a little bit of reality here and there. Although all of Mr. Perry's plays contain some of the same scripts(if you've seen all of them like I have, you can pretty much recite some of the words with the actors because they seem to run the same way all the time) Also the basic idea is generally the same. Its usually a dysfunctional family (usually the women) trying to overcome their past hurt.

Before I go into the movie review I'd also like to comment that Tyler Perry's plays and movies are primarily for the laugh and if one gets a lesson or two out of them, then it's even better. I think Mr. Perry knows his audience and targets just that. Not to mention that up until a few years ago, Mr. Perry was himself homeless and struggling to get by, so most of his writings come from that experience. As much as one or two of the scenes in his play open some old wounds about slavery and the stigma, I still think they are not totally out of place. I also think that we need to start encouraging the black people who try to break through out there and give constructive reviews instead of being invective.

With that out of the way here we go as far as the plays are concerned. Madea goes to jail pretty much finds Madea in jail for being naughty while she has her nephew and his wife staying over at her place. A lot of things go awry when the nephews baby was rushed to the ER in need of a blood transfusion because of a bathtub incident. I suppose you're wondering where either of the parents were...Well find out in the play. While in jail, Madea made some friends too and all of these people get tied together somehow in the play.

As for Why did I get Married, the play is about some married and single friends who have a tradition of having an annual retreat to rejuvenate their relationships and themselves. Well it turns out that the year Mr. Perry wrote about a couple was having marriage problems and everyone (except the wife's friend) was trying help keep their marriage from falling apart while trying to be as objective as possible. Anyway, it's a good one and it made me laugh a lot.

Diary was my least favorite for a host of reasons. The picture quality wasn't that good, the story line wasn't as strong and neither was there much to laugh about. And I'm willing to credit this to the fact that it was Mr. Perry's first big project, but they've got better with time. So that said I think they're all worth watching at least once. Just remember they are more about the laughs than anything else (that's why I watch them). Plus it's a good way to support a rising black star painting the face of black comedy different. I'd watch Tyler Perry production any day rather than all the dirty talking comedy out there from people like Chapelle, Cedric, Chris Rock etc. I suppose these people already have a thing for selling dirty talk. Tyler Perry products are clean fun.",1165363200,11,3155,4.360544217687075
2613883,1,B000GI3KGW,"How has this man found an audience for this swill?  I was subjected to two--two! of his hideous videos as a member of a captive audience (some boor decided to foist his idea of entertainment on everyone who purchased a ticket on the same long-distance bus tour he took).  Black man in drag plays loud, intimidating, violent virago--it wasn't funny in 1906, and it isn't funny in 2006.  I am baffled and angry that Tyler Perry has resurrected this ugly staple of an unmourned past.  There was no plot.  (In ""Madea Goes to Jail,"" all pretense of a plot simply ceases somewhere in the midst of the interminable second hour.)  The writing was worthy of a seventh-grader.  The platitudes were non-stop--again, particularly in ""Madea Goes to Jail.""  And the cues for the sad attempts at ""songs"" were so obvious that I almost wept, because I knew that another assault on my ears was coming.  When are black people going to stop celebrating violence, particularly the violent punishment of children?  When are black people going to stop gyrating in orgiastic delirium at the mere mention of ""de Lawd""?  And where did black writers/""composers"" like Perry get the idea that if you scream it loud enough, you need neither poetry, beauty, harmony, nor symmetry?  We don't need violent Aunt Jemimas in 2006, and, if you value your history, your intellect, and your hearing, you don't need ""Madea.""",1165017600,,1384,4.842553191489362
