6254337,4,B00I9CSXIW,"I liked it, I don't know, there is something about Sam Rockwell  I can't get over, but makes him unlike any other actor.  The first half of the movie was kinda slow and boring, and I was feeling disappointed wirth Rockwell,  but got better when Sam was allowed to come out of his cage (both in the plot and in his acting).  For reference, I did not like The way, way back, and I'm not sure why another reviewer compared this to it in a negative light.  I am in my 30s.",1403049600,,468,4.043478260869565
6254338,4,B00I9CSXIW,"Interesting movie for people in the field. However, I think it paints pharmacists in a negative light, however  over-dramatic and far-fetched it may be.",1398384000,,152,5.333333333333333
6254339,4,B00I9CSXIW,"Super funny. Sam Rockwell does a great job of playing his somewhat downtrodden character.  And Olivia Wilde complements him well. Overall, an easy, funny, low stress movie that's only an hour and a half long.",1398124800,7,208,4.942857142857143
6254340,3,B00I9CSXIW,"In a small idyllic town, the village pharmacist knows everyone's secrets. Doug Varney (Sam Rockwell) has a fitness compulsive wife (Michelle Monaghan) an unruly child (Harrison Holzer) and an irritating narrator (Jane Fonda). Stuck in a rut he meets rich wife Elizabeth (Olivia Wilde) who breaks Doug out and instills confidence in him through an affair and pills.

The film reminded me of a generic Magnolia indie. Let's throw together some quirky characters, get a couple of names, create an unlikely scenario, toss in a few cliches, an appropriate sound track and stir. There was nothing overly entertaining in the film, yet at the same time I wasn't bored waiting for something to happen. For those who can't get enough of the clever and quirky indies, you might get a quick fix from this film.

6254342,3,B00I9CSXIW,"Lots of verbalizing shocking thoughts we often think so an interesting narration.

6254343,4,B00I9CSXIW,"This comedy, narrated by Jane Fonda and co-starring Olivia Wilde from HOUSE, is in part about the brain's chemical response to our unexamined beliefs and choices and asks the question, ""If it's too inconvenient or bothersome to explore the ""unexamined life,"" could taking a few pills lead to ""better living?""

Stereotypically, a man will begin his midlife phase by getting a motorcycle or a red sports car in order to feel alive again before realizing that his acting out is a call to begin the inward journey of shadow work (ie:  forming a link or vine between between one's unconscious and conscious).

In this movie, the red sports car takes the form of pills which tricks our protagonist's brain into responding as if he has already been transformed acquiring a mature attitude of love for self and others.  As seductive a siren call/song proposition pills may be, needless to say, the soul doesn't like to be controlled by pride or egocentricity as vividly portrayed in The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde.  But since this is a comedy, the story has a happy ending but I think it needs to be pointed out that typically only a shaman might be able to employ such aids for healing/transformational work.  Our humourous middle-aged protagonist is a pharmacist by profession, symbolically filling in for the role of a shaman.

""The unrecognized need of the soul for spiritual ecstasy remains ... add to this the ingestion of so-called consciousness-transforming drugs and we can see that while the ego may achieve a temporary release through various methods such as these it does so at what may be a terrible price, for these methods ... do not lead to the development of consciousness but to the reverse:  the lowering of consciousness ..."" pg 285 from John A Sanford's Mystical Christianity

Although there are a couple of scenes of black comedy in the film, I don't think this is a black comedy as most of the humour  covers many of the usual exchanges that take place between modern suburban couples.  The movie starts off a bit on the slow side but it gradually picks up.",1395273600,2,2083,4.774373259052925
6254344,3,B00I9CSXIW,"As a Sam Rockwell fan I enjoyed his performance he did a very good job but for some reason(writing, directing or chemistry) it wasn't his best work, overall the movie was ok. The chemistry between Sam Rockwell, Olivia Wilde and Michelle Monaghan was good........in spots but it just didn't carry throughout the whole movie.  The one thing that I didn't care for was narration by Jane Fonda, that was a head scratcher for me, it just did not work.  If you are a big fan of The Way Way Back and are expecting(hoping) the same you will be disappointed.",1395014400,2,549,4.5353535353535355
6254345,4,B00I9CSXIW,"""Better Living Through Chemistry"" (2014 release; 92 min.) brings the story of Doug Varney (played by Sam Rockwell), who is stuck in an unhappy marriage, and who has just bought the pharmacy from his father-in-law. One evening, Doug is making house deliveries of prescriptions, and one of those deliveries is to a McMansion, where the doorbell is answered by Elizabeth, a beautiful yet bored and unhappy housewife (played by Olivia Wilde). It's not long before Doug and Elizabeth hit it off, setting Doug on a path of personal discovery. In a parallel story, Doug is dealing with his 12 year old son who is going through a tough stretch himself. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the big screen debut of Geoff Moore and David Posamentier, who co-directed and also co-wrote this original screenplay. Second, this is one of those 'little' indie movies that just could, as the movie doesn't take itself too seriously yet before you know it 90 min. have come and gone. Third, the character of Doug is of course crucial to the success of the movie. Originally schedule to be played by Jeremy Renner (who bowed out due to schedule conflicts), Sam Rockwell, whom we saw excel just last year in ""The Way, Way Back"", gives a commanding performance as Doug, and basically carries the movie on his shoulders. There are many other smaller choice roles, including of course Olivia Wilde, but check out also Ray Liotta as the husband of Elizabeth (max 15 min. of screen time), and Jane Fonda as herself at the very end (in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it role, but she does provide the voice-over along the movie). Fourth, the movie was filmed in and around Annapolis, MD, which looks just gorgeous. Last but not least, there are a lot of great songs in the movie soundtrack, including Donovan's ""Season of the Witch"" and lots of indie music. But Queens of the Stone Age's ""Better Living Through Chemistry"" is NOT in the movie.

This movie opened today without any pre-release fanfare or hype at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. The late matinee showing I saw this at was surprisingly well attended, given the low profile of the movie and the simultaneous release on Amazon Instant Video. All that aside, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. ""Better Living Through Chemistry"" is definitely worth checking out, be it in the theater, on DVD or on Amazon Instant Video.",1394755200,10,2480,4.81924882629108

6254350,3,B00I9CSXIW,"The voiceover kinda ruined this movie for me.  I guess it was meant to give this story the feeling of a fable but it just felt intrusive, as in, ""What are you doing talking during my movie?""  Casting was off on this one.  Though I love Rockwell, I felt his natural charisma came through too much for a guy who's supposed to be pent up, beaten down, repressed.  Didn't feel right.  I didn't like Moynahan's (more of a hippy chick then a perfectionist housewife), Wilde's or Liotta's casting either.  The characterizations and writing were off.  They were near fits but not perfect fits.  I'm also not comfortable with the cheeky endorsement of recreational prescription drug use and the casual dispensing of a peripheral character...(what?  his life is less important because he doesn't have a prestigious job?).  This movie is watchable but I think it's more for the suburban crowd.",1461801600,,882,4.859060402684563

He then meets a woman who opens his eyes into what he's been missing. Mr. Varney then embarks on a drug and alcohol fueled affair that leads to great comedic achievements from the cast.

6254359,3,B00I9CSXIW,"This is not a new set-up. Mild mannered dude feels frustrated and trapped. An opportunity arises for him to step up to the plate. But it's a hot plate and our erstwhile hero might experience the big burn.

Here's the scoop. Pharmacist Doug Varney (Sam Rockwell) has just inherited his father-in-law's pharmacy but dear old dad-in-law is still dictating terms. Doug's wife (Michelle Monaghan) treats him like a doormat and his son is a bit weird. Something clicks between him and a gorgeous new customer (Olivia Wilde) and between the wild love making, pill popping and liquor a devious plot is hatched whereby these two might live happily ever after. Can they pull it off?

I like Sam Rockwell a lot but he's hit and miss on the projects he chooses and this just isn't good enough for him. He does well enough with what he has, but what he has just isn't all that good. It all seems so obvious and the few surprises it holds aren't very big. Plus some of it I didn't believe. He's too meek and straight laced to do some of the things he does. And I don't see him as becoming Mr. super lover, even with her coaching. The climax really hurts to watch. It's stupid and clumsy and I didn't believe it for a second. Ray Liotta appears in a cameo and his lines were so unbelievable even he couldn't pull them off. Nope. This is mildly enjoyable fluff at best. Annoying cliche at worst. How you sign on this cast for this gig is beyond me.

It doesn't hurt to watch it but if this is anywhere near the top of your 'to watch' list, you might want to re-think things.",1431043200,2,1558,4.36551724137931

Then he saw her face; customer Elizabeth Roberts (Elizabeth Roberts) is everything he ever wanted. She leads him down the rabbit hole to explore sex, drugs and possibly murder.

8640069,4,B00I9CSXIW,"BETTER LIVING THROUGH CHEMISTRY is a rollicking look at relationships, responsibilities, and personal discovery along a very funny, yet deeper, route thanks to exceptional writing & outstanding performances!!!

The stars of the movie are Sam Rockwell, Olivia Wilde and Michelle Monaghan.  Supporting cast is the young actor who plays the son wickedly & disarmingly well, and in smaller roles, Ken Howard (R.I.P.) and Ray Liotta, with a cameo by Jane Fonda (who also does some narrating).  Sam Rockwell stars as Doug Varney, a much trod-upon pharmacist, whose father-in-law was the original owner of this small town shop and is giving Varney a hard time with letting go of it.  Varney's beautiful, overbearing & competitive wife is played quite adeptly by Michelle Monaghan, in one of her best roles.  Upon making one of his own drugstore deliveries, Varney meets the disillusioned, drug-enabled & alcohol fueled trophy wife of Ray Liotta, Olivia Wilde, also playing her role beautifully & believably.  In other hands, this character could come across as a clever ""snakecharmer"". However, Olivia Wilde plays her with vulnerability.  I've discovered from several ""indie"" movies that Sam Rockwell is a charismatic actor who completely disappears into the characters he plays & this is no exception!

It's upon this meeting that Doug Varney, with some help from this charming, addled customer, becomes a willing participant to discover the medicinal ""candy-trove"" of which he has been the keeper, but never a dabbler.  Complete recklessness & freeing himself from any & all work & family responsibilities, Doug Varney embarks upon a hilarious & outrageous life of newfound freedom.  Now, this, in itself, in other less capable hands (writers & actors) would be a pretty funny comedy.  However, there are nuances & these characters are real & fleshed out, not paperboard cut-outs.  This is how it is a ""dark"" comedy.  Doug decides to not just embark on some cantankerous drug-fueled fun, but to get back at everyone who he's tried, at cost to his own personal ""self"" to satisy & please, but in the end, not pleasing them, nor fulfilling himself.

There are as many twists and turns, ups and downs as the best rollercoaster ride ahead for Doug Varney, and without any spoils, let's just say you owe it to yourself to go along on this ride of personal discovery...it's a very funny, poignant & endearing ride!!!",1490054400,2,2404,5.099489795918367
