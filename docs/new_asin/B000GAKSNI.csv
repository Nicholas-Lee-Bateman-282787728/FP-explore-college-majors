I would have liked to see more of Heath, but I was still quite satisfied with the product, overall, and would recommend it to others.",1211155200,2,406,4.638888888888889
8130114,5,B000GAKSNI,"I have enjoyed the interview on DVD discussing Brokeback Mountain with Ang Lee and Heath Ledger, I have seen the movie in the Theatre and now own it, and have watched it many times. I never seem to tire of this unique and heart wrenching love story.  I touches deeply and has so since the first time I saw it - I have read the short story, I have the book by Annie Proux and many articles on this wonderful, touching story - I have this interview now, and it is part of my library/collection on Brokeback Mountain. I have lived this story myself - I know these men - I am one of them. The truth is, many of these stories are out there, some will never be told because of the bias, prejudice, biligernce and hatred that still exits, even though many of the ones who feel this way, have themselves had such a moment in their own lives - This is not an isolated incident.",1188777600,6,868,4.166666666666667
8130115,4,B000GAKSNI,"I was very interested in hearing more about the filming of Brokeback Mountain.  This interview gave me a deeper look into the filming of the story and the director and acter's views of it.  If you are a dedicated fan, it is worth the money.",1182816000,5,240,4.311111111111111
8130116,5,B000GAKSNI,"Charlie Rose brings you through two very insightful and thoughtful interviews with both Ang Lee and Heath Ledger.  If you're a fan of the movie, or even if you're not, listening to the director's  motivation, and an actor's perspective on this incredibly moving film is worth the watch.

I highly recommend it to any Brokeback Mountain, Ang Lee or Heath Ledger follower.

Thanks for reading.",1178496000,15,391,4.969230769230769
8130117,5,B000GAKSNI,"I didn't see ""Charlie Rose with Ang Lee and Heath Ledger"" when it aired.  I made the purchase when I learned of the interview and it became available.

I'm one of those the film ""hits you in a deep place.""  I've never been ""hit"" by a film before.  I began collecting published materials and information about the film and followed award ceremonies when the film was among those in the competition.

The Charlie Rose interview is more serious than most.  It starts with the theatre preview followed by the Ang Lee interview.  They are interviewed separately and those interviews are mixed with film clips.  They answer questions about filming scenes, the story, working with actors and writers, and why each took on this task.

There is information in these interviews not found in others.  The 57 minute DVD is one of the best of the things that I have collected about ""Brokeback Mountain.""",1168646400,20,890,4.758169934640523
