Maurice Bishop is David Atlee Plhillips, Rose Cherami is a real character along with the French connection. In one of the previews, the man you see on the cover says, ""If you can tell story that closely resembles the truth, then you control the situation"". That is what the government has continued to do, without exposing the agencies who participated in the assassination. Only certain parts of the movie are dubbed in English, most of the film is in English. Some good scenes of New Orleans and the French Quarter. This is a well made film, top notch. It moves very well and does not lose your interest. In many ways historically accurate. Gives the mob a little too much credit for the assassination. Take it for what it is worth, a very good movie. More accurate that most of what you see on TV.",1449360000,,938,4.556213017751479
