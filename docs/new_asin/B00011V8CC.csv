8005179,4,B00011V8CC,Though a bit on the young side and heavy on Fan Service; the plot and dialogue were solid with few exceptions that made one wonder if something had been left out or went by very fast.,1382659200,,183,4.111111111111111
8005180,2,B00011V8CC,"I was forced to watch this anime. I've seen the complete series about 4-5 times now. It's all the funimation channel ever shows, and for some reason it's always on. I still don't know what this anime is about. I still don't understand the plot other than Eclair and Lumire work with some secret forces, they go against orders and leave the forces, they are then wanted,and then somehow become allies again and end up working for them. I don't get it, it just doesn't make much sense. The plot has more holes in it than a golf course. Then there's the characters, who honestly don't make much of an impression on you. The only reason Eclair and  Lumire do is because they are the main characters. I did like Alv though she was probably the only interesting character (she should be though because she is the villian), but I still don't understand why she is so angry all the time. Another annoying thing is Lumire and that whole underaged girl fetish. Half the time they are throwing Lumire fan service in your face. LOOK! IM A GROWN MAN I'M NOT INTERESTING IN 10 YEAR OLD GIRLS! It's disgusting and it's really is annoying. There's a scene when she is shown as an adult (don't ask me how, this show doesn't make sense), and she looks pretty good. So good I might of gave this show 3 stars if it was like that the entire anime but it isn't. It's like this show is aimed at pedophiles thus the name ""Kiddy"" Grade. It really gets old, and the story is more confusing than ""Neon Genesis"" but unlike Neon Genesis this show is far from a masterpiece. This show is worth watching the same way I saw it; it just so happend to be on, and a better show was comming on after it. I couldn't imagine actually buying this rubish. Heck, even watching it for free on the net is a waste of time.",1236816000,3,1778,4.323353293413174
8005181,2,B00011V8CC,"this was not that great its a little boring play magazine gave it an A theirs animation that funimation comes out with thats really not that great. I have this boxset and theirs really talking in it and some action, in 2004 after hearing it come out on tv i thought it was going to be interesting with fun action and comedy but when i got the boxset i sad this is a waste of time funimation will tell you their animation is good but they say that to get your money but otherwise this was okay.",1208736000,,493,4.092783505154639
8005182,5,B00011V8CC,"First this looked to me like the normal ""Girls with guns and Toys"" plotts.
But with the end of the first quater it went - mysteious, dark and deep.
Finished the second Quater now - and its already in the so called top list for me : Cowboy Beebob, Elfenlied, Trigun ...

Characters have more than one OTHER side in them, the Stories are nice.

Can only hope its going on in this way for the second half :)",1189123200,,404,4.10126582278481
8005183,5,B00011V8CC,"Kiddy Grade has a lot of action it takes place in the future it is about two girls Eclair and Lumiere who work for an organization called G.O.T.T. The organization is ment to keep the peace with the galaxy. They have cybernetic enhancements which give them cool abilities. Eclair the brunette has an ability called ""Power"" with gives her super speed and strength. Lumiere the blue haired girl has an ability called ""Puppet"" which gives her controll over electronics such as robots,ships,guns, etc. all I'll say is that they, Well mostly Eclair has a some secrets and a dark past. So if your looking for something new it's worth the buy plus it comes with these collectible cards.",1186185600,2,679,4.762711864406779
8005184,5,B00011V8CC,"This was a wonderful show. Its Sailormoon meets Neon Genesis Evangelion with the fun fighting scenes, somewhat mature content, and social issues it deals with. Its all the fun of both series; not too ditzy and not too dark. The soundtrack was lovely and the animation was perfect. Despite some occasional nudity and boring dialogue, the show was great and this set has everything you could want out of it. The collector cards are a nice touch.",1185235200,,443,4.766233766233766
8005185,4,B00011V8CC,"I picked this up ""sight unseen"" and am glad I did. It was very well done and had a good storyline. It jumps from present to past in an extended ""flashback"" that some might find confusing if they're not following closely. It has aspects of old and new styles of anime that blend well to make an entertaining and amusing story that still can be thought-provoking.",1184198400,7,361,4.484848484848484
8005186,4,B00011V8CC,"Yes, it's actually happened. After releasing Kiddy Grade in 8 individual DVDs, and later halved in 4 ""File Collections"", Funimation has finally done the sensible thing in the Anime industry: released a box set for a series it has flaunted for what seems like years. But of course, this is expected from Funimation, which milks it's DVD releases for every dollar it can earn - releasing the minimal episodes per volume.

As fans already know, ""Kiddy Grade"" is the story of G.O.T.T. agents Eclair and Lumiere as they try and preserve order sometime in the distant future, where mankind has formed the ""Galactic Union"" in order to avoid interstellar wars. But as the two young women soon realize, the universe is a big place - and they may just be another drop in the bucket - or are they?

While ""Kiddy Grade"" presents an enveloping and philosophical storyline, the overall quality is mediocre. The plot itself may not make sense to some viewers, and is very hard to follow. Also be advised this series relies heavily on Fan-Service to keep viewers hooked - not that it's horrific, but it's there. And with good reason - character design and series art are fabulous.

What may surprise most is the quality of the English Dub. Funimation regulars and Voice Acting vets Colleen Clinkenbeard (Riza Hawkeye, ""Fullmetal Alchemist"") and Monica Rial (Kirika, ""Noir"") provide the voices for Eclair and Lumiere, and do a fairly good job in outclassing their Japanese counterparts. ""Kiddy Grade"" also features impressive performances from other recognizable Funimation voice talents such as Laura Bailey (Lust, ""Fullmetal Alchemist""), Dameon Clarke (Scar, ""Fullmetal Alchemist""), and Alison Retzloff (Conan, ""Case Closed"").

To summarize, if you're looking for a series that's great to watch (look at), this is a sound investment. If you're looking for a remake of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" or ""Ghost in the Shell"", you won't find it here.",1154736000,26,1927,5.069400630914826
8005187,4,B00011V8CC,"I'm sure many of you are dissapointed on the Starter Set with the Limited Edition Kiddy Grade Baseball Cap. But without it, you don't miss much of it. Well, let's get to the goodies.
After watching the entire DVD, don't judge this title yet as there is more to come that will astound you even further. Animation wise, knowing Gonzo always did their best in what they do. Although the opening episode is slow, its worth the chance to look into it without regrets. The only down side of this package is the DVD only has 3 episodes. What gives? FUNAnimation is probably following Japan's packaging (which also features 3 episodes per DVD).
Still, its worth it and once you start off, you won't regret it.",1081468800,2,701,4.571428571428571
8005188,3,B00011V8CC,"I watched this in fansub form last year and it was interesting enough for me to actually download the entire series as it was released. However, don't expect some poignant story that will enlighten you to the workings of the universe or anything. It's just entertaining. In the first few episodes it seems that the main focus of the series is Eclair's (the main character) panties. Lots of panty shots in the first several episodes then it starts to slack off on them. The characters are likeable and the episodes are interesting enough but I wouldn't say this anime is for everyone.",1077062400,4,583,4.7254901960784315
