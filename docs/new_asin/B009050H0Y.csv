5200300,4,B009050H0Y,"I thought the movie, Yossi, played out very well.  The only thing that bothered me was it's tentativeness, Yossi, forever overlooking the come-ons of people in his life and capitulating to the 'final' offer only at the end of the film! I could not believe he was so naive to see these 'come-ons'but obviously he was?  I would recommend itand it would have been a 5 star one (IMO)had it shown more love scenes between him and Tom.",1370044800,,429,4.487179487179487
5200301,5,B009050H0Y,Really good movie thanks to the participation of Ohad Knoller whose is capable of expressing multifaceted emotions with his eyes. A little sad also because despite the possibly happy ending he really never let go of the past and his new love interest has no idea of the baggage he's bringing into their budding relationship.,1369872000,,324,4.909090909090909
5200302,4,B009050H0Y,"A surprising, charming, thoughtful movie....an interesting follow-up to the original.  Realistic in its portrayal of heartbreak following the tragic death of a loved one, and the physical and emotional price paid by the surviving partner.  It's always uplifting to think that everyone has a second act and a second chance at love!  A very cute movie which I highly recommend..however, it definitely helps to have seen the first one to put everything in context and to understand the doctor's current outlook on life.  It's always refreshing to have a happy ending in a gay movie..so many seem to have the opposite.",1369785600,,614,5.0495049504950495
5200303,5,B009050H0Y,"I can only add another bravo to the positive reviews already posted for ""Yossi.""  The unhurried and completely human telling of Yossi Gettelman's healing after the loss of his great love and all the regrets that went with the tragedy makes the story wonderfully credible.  Yossi's meeting after 10 years with the parents of his dead partner is heartbreaking, but is the beginning of the recovery of this wonderful and deeply grieving man.  The second part of the film--the meeting with a free-spirited young soldier who recognizes Yossi for the good man that he is a great statement of optimism and salvation and will bring a tear to the most cynical of readers.

""Yossi"" is a very fine film about a gay man and is, at the same time, a film for anyone who likes a fine film about the human heart.  Highly recommended.",1369612800,,817,4.645833333333333
5200304,5,B009050H0Y,"For all of those who saw and were deeply touched by the 2002 Eytan Fox film, YOSSI & JAGGER, this sequel simply titled YOSSI will resurface all manner of fine memories of the original. Not only is this a fine follow-up film, a glance back at a gay love affair the took place in the Israeli Army that ended in the death of one of the lovers, it offers a story of the healing of grieving as well as the dramatic changes that have taken place in Israel concerning the current acceptance of gay men serving opening in the military. Times are changing, at last.

In the ten years since Dr. Yossi Guttman (the sensitive actor Ohad Knoller recreating his original role) lost his lover in the war while fighting he has become an honored but overworked cardiologist, living alone, having gained weight, and his only social life is connecting with same sex dates on the Internet. One of his dates (who responded to an earlier photo of Yossi) is Yariv (Gil Desiano), a young hunk who when Yossi comes to Yariv's house shows disdain for Yossi's misrepresenting himself and settles for a quickie just to get Yossi to leave. Yossi's other 'social life' comes from the nurse Lea (Nuria Lusinzky) who has a crush on him and makes advances that Yossi rebuffs. After a minor error in the OR Yossi's fellow doctors insist he take a vacation to recuperate his exhaustion. Yossi sees a woman in the admitting area, recognizes her as Jagger's mother Varda (Orly Silbersatz), does her echo cardiogram, and subsequently drives her home (Varda does not know Yossi). After Yossi's friend newly divorced friend Moti (Lior Ashkenazi) tries to get Yossi a female sexual encounter, Yossi decides to take the recommended break from the hospital, but before he leave he visits Varda and her husband to share with them his affair with their son: only the father is sensitive to Yossi's past and shares Jagger's room with him.

Yossi departs for a vacation to Eilat and on the road he meets four young Israeli soldiers - Nimrod (Meir Golan), Fefer (Shlomi Ben Attar), Benda (Amir Jerassi) and the openly gay Tom (Oz Zehavi) - and gives them a ride to a resort in Eilat. There Tom represents all the buoyancy of young love that recalls the Yossi/Jagger affair and the meeting of these two needy people alters Yossi's life and future.

The entire cast is splendid and the screenplay by Italy Segal provides a fast moving, sensitive, and very touching resolution of an emotionally injured man's life, giving him a fresh start in a different world. There is humor, many touching moments, and sense of understatement that pervades the films of Eytan Fox. The film is in Hebrew with subtitles: the subtitles are very difficult to read so be prepared (if you don't understand Hebrew) to pause the film now and then to capture the meaningful dialog.

5200306,5,B009050H0Y,this is one of the best movies I have seen in a while.

5200307,5,B009050H0Y,"Purchased this through amazon.uk.com.  Couldn't wait for the U.S release date. So Yossi has grown up. No spoilers. There where parts that I questioned about the actor playing Yossi's decisions in behavioral responses. None the less, this movie moves really quickly and at one point I was wondering how they were going to fit in the new character. Great job allowing us to follow up.  The extras are just as good, there are facts about homosexuality in films in Isreal that I didn't know, with regards to the original movie. Well worth the purchase.  Only wish it came out on blu ray. That fact really pisses me off....why not release this on blu ray?",1360454400,6,650,4.684210526315789
5200308,2,B009050H0Y,"Yossi is a sequel to but not a continuation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yossi-Jagger/dp/B0001KNHAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yossi & Jagger</a>, and I don't care that this movie doesn't carry that romance to new heights of ecstasy. This is a story of what happens to Yossi later in life, and the fact that ten years later Jagger isn't still an integral part of it is both normal and fine with me.

What does offend me greatly is the way Yossi is presented as if his being over 30 and slightly heavier than an anorexic fashion model makes him gross and repellent, incredibly lucky if any man even slightly younger or thinner looks at him without vomiting or at least sneering. Obesity is far too extreme a term, and even overweight is unreasonable. Yossi is a normal size, and he is by far the sexiest man in this movie. It's any other man who's lucky to get him, not the other way around.

The movie's second great offense is Lior Ashkenazi, as Yossi's pseudo-friend and fellow cardiologist Moti. Somebody in addition to Ashkenazi himself evidently finds him overwhelmingly attractive, but not me. I can't stand him. The most disgusting, most infuriating movie scene I've seen in years has him bringing a girl into the bar restroom where Yossi is peeing and trying to work up a sleazy threesome even though Yossi clearly isn't interested.

I know Moti is supposed to be disgusting, as are several others in this movie; but I already know that most people - especially straight men (and, unfortunately, most young gay men, like a smug, insufferable jerk Yossi meets online, and even the supposedly hot but arrogant and ugly soldier Tom who forces himself on Yossi near the end) - are disgusting, and having offensive behavior rubbed in my face doesn't entertain me.

I love Ohad Knoller, and the older and beefier he gets the sexier he gets, but he's wasted in this sadly and annoyingly shallow movie. Eytan Fox laid an egg this time.",1358467200,6,1984,4.966867469879518

5200316,5,B009050H0Y,"I had originally seen Yossi and Jagger about 3-4 years ago and did not know that there was a sequel to that movie.  It was good to see how much the writer had Yossi grow over the 10 years between the two movies. The story was well written and definitely reflects the attitude of modern Israel concerning being gay (at least according to my gay friends who live there). It was a poignant and heart-felt portrayal of a 30+ year old man who is finally willing to 'come out' and openly enjoy the company of another man. Ohad Knoller, who plays Yossi in both movies, gives a nuanced performance that deeply involved me in his character. I definitely recommend this warm romantic story as a enjoyable evening with a good friend or partner. I have sen this movie multiple times and each time it brings tears to my eyes. As a straight friend os mine says; ""It is a great gay 'chick flick'"".",1459209600,,882,4.411042944785276

He's also not hot but manages to find a hot young guy and they connect.  You can believe that their relationship will

You don't need to have seen Yossi & Jagger for it to make sense or move you, but it helps - not so much in plot but in understanding the depths and source of Yossi's grief.  Ohad Knoller and Oz Zehavi are so wonderful in it and they have a lovely, understated chemistry.  I wish this film had been around when my grandfather died.

5200322,5,B009050H0Y,"If `Yossi & Jagger` mesmerized with its passionate lovers caught short in war, then its long-awaited continuation, `Yossi` will charm with its sensitive portrayal of a man struggling to love once again.

Years after his military service and traumatic loss, Yossi has become Dr. Yossi Guttmann, a serious, introspective cardiologist.  Withdrawn, bearded and pot-bellied, Dr. Guttmann lives for his work, completing his duties with a robotic efficiency.  Oblivious to the head nurse`s crush on him, he follows the lead of the charming Dr. Moti (an aging, yet ever-handsome Lior Ashkenazi) as the latter attempts to revive some life into him.  Moti suspects that his friend might be gay, but nonetheless sets him up with some female companionship.  This of course ends disastrously as Yossi finally determines to face the source of all his angst, his refusal to let go of his deceased lover.

In a beautifully rendered scene, Dr. Guttman confronts Jagger`s parents and lets out the truth he has held inside for so long, that he and their son were lovers.  Ohad Knoller`s Yossi is a confused mess who wavers between emotional collapse and incoherency as he circuitously rambles towards his confession.

Having unloaded his secret, Yossi struggles to start anew.  While he looks for connection in the all the wrong places,  with on-line porn and humiliating hook-ups, Yossi soon decides to escape from his failures to the barren, dangerous  wastes of the Sinai.  As fate or chance would have it, en route he picks up a group of young IDF conscripts headed for a holiday at the Red Sea resort of Eliat.  One of the four is Tom, a sexy, young gay man who takes an interest in the gloomy Dr. Guttmann. While Yossi hides under beach umbrellas (he skips on the Sinai) with Thomas Mann novellas, Tom does his best to pull Yossi into life.  And like an ice-block in the desert, Yossi melts quickly.  Their ensuing courtship unfolds in a sweet, funny and heart-warming manner.  Tom sees the beauty that lurks underneath Yossi`s bulging belly and stern, doctorial manner, while Yossi pushes himself to take a risk.  The result is a second-half that turns into a sweet story of rebirth that works despite its sugary optimism.

The first half of `Yossi` is the better (and darker) half as the desperate Yossi threatens to slip into an abyss of despair and paralysis.  Yossi`s repressed pain and frustration are conveyed with his every sluggish movement and burdened glance.  Knoller`s Yossi perfectly captures the torpor of being caught in a whirlpool of your own making. You feel as if Yossi is slowly being trapped within his own labyrinth.  Even the cinematography expresses this with its chiaroscuro shadows and dark colors.

The second half of the film beams light and levity.  Yet, Tom (the sexy Oz Zehavi) proves he has more to offer Yossi than just a delicious body.  Despite their crushy awkwardness, Zehavi and Knoller manage to keep it real.  You don`t know what will transpire between these two, but at least Dr. Guttman has returned to the living.

`Yossi` is a tale of rebirth, old skin peeling off, the new peeking through.  Yeah, there`ll be a bad burn or two but Yossi`s deathly pallor is tanning quick.  The Fox/Uschovsky team has found a formula that works.  Their stories of difficult loves, impossible situations, and the men caught up in them carry a universal and lasting appeal.",1431475200,,3386,4.911971830985915

5200334,5,B009050H0Y,"This endearing movie far exceeded the content and emotional impact of its predecessor, Yossi & Jagger. The plot is resumed nearly ten years later; the protagonist, played credibly by Ohad Knoller, is an emotionally secretive heart specialist who must discover true meaning in his work-obsessed life, face the consequences of the loss of a lover, and bring his haunted past into synch with his future. When off the job, his lean personal life devolves around fatty take-out and cyber gay porn.  His gutwrenching past is jarringly resurrected by a patient who is actually the mother of his deceased lover.  Yossi, as many older, single gay men, wears an air of despondency and aloneness; his venture into on-line dating proving to be an utter fiasco, partly of his own creation.  His closeted behavior yields rumors of his gayness at work and a disastrous foray with a colleague to a straight pick-up bar.  A subsequent visit with the parents of Jagger to disencumber his crushing feelings for their son are met with sheer denial by the mother and a reluctant tolerance by the father.  On a spontaneous holiday to the beaches of southern Israel he befriends a young, flirtatious soldier, which after a Disney-like day in Eilat, leads to a first kiss, despite Yossi's qualms regarding his own age and overweight physique. This modest film takes its characters seriously, with a healthy dose of playfulness.  The film's only flaw seems to be its artistic style, or more accurately, its lack of same: its visual effects and plotting resemble a cable TV offering.  Despite its intelligent, empathetic, and poignant scrutiny of love and loss, the balance between practical considerations and being totally indifferent is delicate; the director frequently veers towards the latter.  The scene in which Yossi undresses and in turn embraces his body image is edited to hide his nudity and thereby removes any hint of emotional relief.  This minor shortcoming is, however, overcome by the facial expressions, speech cadences, and physical posture of Yossi to depict weariness and misery.  I would actually view this again in the near future.",1399852800,,2130,5.094827586206897

A new patient has arrived at the hospital for a diagnostic procedure.  Yossi recognizes her as Jagger's mother.  this brings back a lot of memories and sadness for Yossi and we immediately realize that Yossi has not had true love in this life since the loss of Jagger.  During a vacation near the sea, Yossi meets Tom, a younger soldier.  A relationship soon develops.  At this point one is left hanging, because the filmmaker leaves ends the story just as the relationship becomes physical.  The viewer can come to any one of several conclusions.  I personally feel that relationship develops more deeply based on the fact that Tom was attracted to Yossi's intelligence and culture.

Having lost his lover in combat, Yossi spends his few leisure hours watching porno films on a computer, trying and failing to find dates, and making a pilgrimage to Varda's (Orly Silbersatz's) house - Varda being the mother of his deceased lover.  Eytan Fox's film is a stark depiction of loneliness - there is little or no music, and the camera scarcely departs from Yossi's face as he looks at his shapeless figure and wonders whether he will be able to escape the trauma of his loss.  However the film takes an optimistic turn as Yossi travels to a resort, and on the way meets up with a group of soldiers.  One of them, Tom (Oz Zehavi) takes a fancy to him - even though it takes a long time for Yossi to shed his inhibitions and respond in kind.  In a consciously vulgar seaside resort, full of manufactured entertainment and artificial swimming-pools, the two of them spend the night together and subsequently take a life-changing decision.

5200348,4,B009050H0Y,"Ive heard a lot of good things about the gay-centered drama Yossi & Jagger, from the early aughts, but I never got around to seeing it.  Still, I ran across the sequel the other day and decided to give it a watch.  I know what many are thinking, and that is that you really cant watch a sequel without seeing the first film first, but Ill say this; Yossi is a standalone film and really doesnt need the first film to be appreciated on its own.  In fact, this film has enough shading of backstory to fill in the audience on what they missed in the first film, and in my eyes this almost works entirely as its own feature, without the presence of Yossi & Jagger.  This isn't to say that the films don't work together, and even work together better (like I said, Ive only seen this film) but if I didn't know that there was a film that came before this, I wouldnt have guessed with while watching Yossi.  This feels very much like a singular story, and for that I was grateful.

This doesnt mean that it works entirely, but Ill get to that in a minute.

Yossi tells the story of Dr. Yossi Gutmann, a gay man hiding (or more not disclosing) his sexual orientation from his colleges and pretty much living a quiet and uneventful life.  He has lost love (the death of his military lover Jagger) and this has scared him emotionally, leaving him a ghost almost.  He wanders through his life, sad and alone, seeking senseless escapades online and crawling deeper inside his shell of shame and regret.  Then he meets a group of young soldiers, and one a whim starts up a sort of relationship with one, a friendship from a distance that awakens Yossis thirst for life and love once again.

As a whole, Yossi is a nice film.  It is anchored by a beautiful performance by Ohad Knoller, reprising his role from Yossi & Jagger and shading Yossi with so much internalized anguish.  Watching his bloom near the films end is beautiful to see, and this is a real testament to the honesty Knoller brings to the role.  Still, Yossi also feels somewhat like a non-event.  While the film does have that nice climax, bringing Yossis struggle full circle, it almost feels like too little too late.  We wait the entire film for something to happen, and when it does the film ends abruptly and we are left wondering why we waited so long for so little to actually happen.  The film has questionable pacing because of this fact (it drags a little in parts) but is so light you almost don't feel that.  Like I said, it is a nice film and Knoller is fantastic.

Still, when its over, that is that and you move on, not looking back once.

I will say this though; seeing Lior Ashkenazi was a real treat for me.  Ashkenazi gives one of my FAVORITRE performances of the aughts in Late Marriage and seeing him in another film (I stupidly have not kept up with his career) was a surprise, but a great one.  Hes also still a stone cold fox, so I did wish that he had a larger role here (especially since his role was soprovocative).",1390176000,3,2995,4.358558558558559
5200349,4,B009050H0Y,It was good to reunite with Yossi and see how he was doing 10 years after Jagger's death. Ohad Knoller brings us into the lonely sad world of Yossi and shows how he starts to blossom.,1388966400,,183,4.111111111111111

Now I finally get to watch Yossi and Jagger and this movie again back-to-back on Amazon Prime - it was an incredible experience.  I like that settings being 10 years later which reminds me of the ""trilogy"" of Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight.  I like that the character development of Yossi.  The acting was superb.  In the first half of the movie, you can really feel the agony in Yossi through his expressions: the loss of a lover, the loss of youth, the loss of trust, the loss of happiness, the loss of a macho, manly, young stud appearance, and his continued struggle with coming out of the closet, which is incredibly on point because of the generation Yossi belongs to, compared to Tom's generation.  The movie depicts the very struggle of gay men who don't fit the stereotypical physique and social status.  I love the movie reference to Dancer in the Dark in that the first half of the movie is to show how mundane and dull and lifeless of Yossi's life.  Then I love the reference to Brokeback Mountain where he visits Jagger's family and the dad invited him to see Jagger's room.

Eytan Fox was masterful in bringing the myriad nuances of this complex and disillusioned character to the big screen.

He is still self loathing and we never really see any passion as was so wonderfully present in the original film.  ""Yossi"" was a disappointment to me, but Fox does present an acurrate portrayal of ""gay Israel "".  I would only recommend to those curious or rather obsessed with sequels.

5200377,5,B009050H0Y,"I'm a big fan of director Eytan Fox's work, especially his first feature, ""Yossi and Jagger""  That movie told the ultimately tragic story of two male lovers in the Israeli army.  ""Yossi"" is a sequel to that film, though you don't have to know anything about the prior movie to follow or enjoy ""Yossi.""

The character Yossi is a lonely doctor working in a large Israeli hospital, who can't really make a connection with anyone.  A chance encounter reawakens thoughts of his lost lover and enables him to get a bit of closure on that relationship.  Or if not closure, exactly, at least it shakes him up a bit to maybe move out of his comfort zone.  He befriends some soldiers on leave and meets a potential love interest.  But even with taking some new chances, Yossi still has trouble forming a connection.

Ohad Knoller gives a great performance as Yossi. It's not an easy role, and Knoller makes us feel for him even though sometimes his actions (or inactions) make us frustrated with the character.

This is not a fast paced film, but an amazing character study.  Highly recommended!",1375315200,,1085,4.663157894736842

5200386,4,B009050H0Y,"10 years later we meet Yossi again - 34, still closeted (barely) and quite a bit heavier.  He is mired in a morass of his loss - the love of his life, Jagger - and engulfing himself in his work.  There is much to like about this film, but unlike the earlier film, which was shot like a documentary and very honest in its directness of portrayal, both of the love story, and the other relationships of the soldiers, this film is more cinematic, though still staying close to its honest portrayal of the characters.
We first see him now as a doctor specializing in the heart.  Then there is his friend and colleague, Moti, played by the excellent Lior Ashkenazy, says 'he looks like an operating table'. Lior's role of supportive friend - enough that he is ready to engage in a 3-way with Yossi in a bar's toilet in order to pull him out of his funk, is one that makes you sit up and say ""Wow"" to yourself!!
Ohad Knoller has gained a lot of weight for this role, and he carries the gravitas of his loss believably.  He still mourns Jagger.  The scene when he reconnects with Jagger's parents is moving, and provides a believable catalyst for Yossi's escape.  The film tends to move a little slowly in places (for me, as a non-Israeli gay person, the cabaret scenes seemed to be too long and heavy), but the comedic moments are brilliant and touching on the issue of same-sex partners and being a widower was deftly handled.  Also, the sometimes-brutal quality of Jewish directness balances here with Yossi's nearly painful hesitancy and reserve.
Also, Oz, the younger 'love interest' is very interesting here.  Yossi offers a ride to a group of young soldiers who missed their bus.  There is nothing 'cruisy' about his action.  Along the way, ""Tom's"" openness about his sexuality, his mates' clearly accepting attitude and Yossi's past serious military background all meld as we watch Tom become the pursuer : he senses in Yossi a deeply powerful kindred connection, and his tender yet confident approach with Yossi is believable and masculinely tender - no ageism here from him nor his military friends, who jokingly, and affectionately tag Yossi with the nickname ""Mozart"" (an ironic tie back to ""Jagger""?) because of his love of older style music.  If only there were such younger gay men in America!
Note : There is some male nudity here (though not 'full frontal'), so if that offends you, be prepared!
All-in-all, a film I enjoyed, and wonder if there will be another film 5 or 10 years down the line titled ""Yossi & Tom""?! I would, in all honesty, like to see it.",1374019200,2,2568,4.6219780219780215

5200395,5,B009050H0Y,"Having seen Yossi and Jagger, I was really eager to see the sequel, Yossi.  Eytan Fox is one of the most brilliant directors on the planet.  The stories he creates with minimal budgets are so true-to-life ... so honest, that they are universal.  No matter what country, what language, what sexual orientation, his stories have impact.

Ohad Knoller again plays Yossi, ten years after Jagger died in the earlier movie.  He has sublimated his feelings into a medical career.  While successful in his career, his life is wasted.  The first half of the movie shows us a static and unhappy life, but Knoller's skill as an actor keeps us engaged.  A chance encounter with Jagger's mother (who doesn't recognize him) seems to reawaken him.

The scene where Yossi tells Jagger's parents about his shared love with their son was heartbreaking.  Yossi's bottled-up emotions come to the fore and Jagger's mother's curt response to his confession reminds us that a son's gay love isn't always welcome.

En route to Sinai, Yossi picks up four soldiers heading to Eilat.  Yossi decides to stay in Eilat (reminding us of a promise he made to Jagger as he lay dying), and in the succeeding days is seduced by a gorgeous young soldier played by Oz Zehavi.  The second half of the movie has a lightness and sweetness that is so appealing.  Zehavi is as charming as he is beautiful.  It takes all of both to melt Yossi, but he eventually succeeds.

I read in an interview that Fox intended the ending as a gift to Yossi.  It's a gift to him, certainly, but to all of us as well.  Redemption from grief is possible and a new day and new love can be found.",1373155200,2,1635,4.5793103448275865

5200400,4,B009050H0Y,"This movie made it clear to me that Ohad Knoller is a fine screen actor.  I  have also seen him in Beaufort, Amir & Harel, The Bubble, and Yossi & Jagger - but in my opinion, his performance in Yossi was far superior to any of these.

Given that many reviewers have written very convincingly about the major themes of the movie, I will only describe a few things that were especially enjoyable and touching to me.

I simply loved the attraction/tension between Tom and Yossi as they spoke outside Yossi's hotel room, each of them planning a different diversion for the evening (DJ Tiesto vs. Keren Ann). With the following scene  -  Keren Ann's melancholic love song as voice-over to the view of colorful lights reflecting on the Eilat gulf - I was reminded of Jagger's erstwhile insistence that Yossi go with him to Eilat and ""share a queen bed."" I then recalled the occasion of Jagger's death: Yossi was in charge of the army troops
when they went to fight that night, and Yossi was with Jagger as he was dying. It was no accident that Yossi sought out a profession with responsibility that also focused on physically caring for others.

At the Keren Ann performance, two major changes simultaneously develop: Yossi allows himself to demonstrate his sadness (he cries) and the relationship between the two men begins to evolve. As Tom approaches Yossi from behind, Yossi seems to have regained his aura of strength - but also demonstrates his vulnerability. From this point on, I could *feel* the attraction between the men. Although previously, Yossi's weight was deemed unattractive (as shown in the online dating meetup early in the film), his size now seems to represent his solidity and strength - and a source of attractiveness.",1372464000,,1736,4.785953177257525
5200401,4,B009050H0Y,"A movie that make you Feel the emotions, and make you think. It would be good to see the 1st movie Yossi before maybe seeing this one so you can see why Yossi is the way he is.",1371945600,,176,3.6578947368421053
5200402,4,B009050H0Y,"I'd fairly written off the ""gay"" genre after sampling one too many of its nauseatingly shallow American specimens. But then comes along this very fine sequel to show us how a parsimonious script, a relaxed pace, soft lighting, and restrained performances, can combine to make for a simple but pleasing obverse to Death in Venice. I stop short of five stars only because the ending is too corny, the soundtrack too American, and someone failed to realize that Mr. Zehavi is too beautiful for tattoos.",1371772800,,499,4.882352941176471
5200403,5,B009050H0Y,"Having seen and enjoyed the original film Yossi and Jagger by the talented Israeli director Eytan Fox, I was anxiously awaiting this sequel, and it did not disappoint.
Excellent performances by the entire cast and another feather in the cap of Eytan Fox for his wonderful direction. Anxiously looking forward to his next film.",1371772800,,326,5.055555555555555
5200404,4,B009050H0Y,This is a romance that has good  characters in the principle roles.  Perhaps it ended in the only possible way.  I enjoyed it and recommend it.,1371686400,,143,4.423076923076923
5200405,5,B009050H0Y,"Anyone who has suffered the sort of loss that Yossi has will ""get"" this movie. Yossi's day-to-day grind with nothing to look forward to, his allowing himself to go to seed, his belief that no one could love him again, his fear that if he comes out of his shell or comes out of the closet, he will be scorned by his friends and co-workers  -- all these suggest that he's defeated from the start. But he's not. There's a small flame burning, and this movie follows his painful progression. Yossi reaches an important milestone when he makes contact with Jagger's parents and confesses to them his love for Jagger and the truth of their relationship, something Jagger himself would have done had he lived. This marks the moment of Yossi's actual coming out with mixed results -- Jagger's mother rejects, Jagger's father innately understands. From then on, the changes occurring inside Yossi speed up until he's able to respond to a younger ""out"" soldier who sees in him the value he is unable to see in himself. Eytan Fox's direction is flawless, as usual. Ohad Knoller gives a heart-breaking performance as Yossi, and Oz Zehavi is charming as the young soldier who could bring ""joie de vivre"" back into anyone's life.",1371513600,16,1215,4.731132075471698
5200406,5,B009050H0Y,"It helps to appreciate this film if you have seen the earlier more serious film Yossi and Jagger. Yossi and Jagger introduces the character of closeted Yossi who loses his lover Jagger because of war, and he is only able to verbalize his love when Jagger is dying. Even after Jagger's death nobody knows the depth of their relationship.
Forward ten years to Yossi the film. He is now a doctor who is alone, sad, and still grieving for Jagger. This film is somewhat lighter in tone in that there are comic moments as Yossi tries to get into the gay scene with less than satisfying results.
He meets a young soldier with whom he has an immediate connection. The young soldier is able to bring Yossi back to really living and loving. There are second chances if you will take them. Ultimately this is a very sweet romantic film.",1371254400,5,825,4.506666666666667
5200407,4,B009050H0Y,I like to original movie and wanted to see more of what happen to Yossi.  The movie could have been longer in showing Yossi's life before he started to come out of his lonely life after the death of Jagger.  His new life has just started when the movie ended.  I hope to see another sequel to this movie.  This  movie reminded me much of Israeli life and the general tolerance of Israeli's to gay people.,1371254400,,404,4.2631578947368425
5200408,5,B009050H0Y,"I liked the seriousness and depth of this film which is a powerful depiction of the lasting impact of loss and grief, no matter what one's sexual orientation might be. The film takes on the subjects of love and loss respectfully. Perhaps because it does not derive from the U.S., which perplexingly has offered inconsistent quality (acting, directing, and writing) and often devolves into camp, over-dramatization, or cliche, this film crosses none of those lines, is subtle, kind, and satisfying emotionally. The end of the movie - no spoiler here - leaves you wanting more; wanting more story, wanting more for the characters, and wanting another film in less than 10 years (fingers crossed).",1371168000,,694,5.0964912280701755
5200409,5,B009050H0Y,This was a beautiful film with the sensitive handling of a slightly older and heavier man who is sad and depressed until he meets someone who appreciates him.,1371081600,,158,4.678571428571429
5200410,2,B009050H0Y,I was disappointed with the direction the movie took.  It was too maudlin and didn't give the viewer any greater insight to the main character than the first movie.,1371081600,,164,4.655172413793103
5200411,2,B009050H0Y,"Eytan Fox has a great track record of getting the most out of his actors, creating interesting stories, using music to augment the films in interesting ways, and adding lots of auxiliary characters to his scripts that add to the enjoyment of the films. In Yossi, his latest offering, all the aforementioned qualities are presented in a great cast and storyline.

The problem with the storyline however, is that it seems highly unbelievable to me. The lead character's significant depression is a good example. I know that they have antidepressants and quality psychotherapy in Israel. To be this depressed, as Yossi seems, for a 10 year period, without someone along the way suggesting getting help, seems ludicrous to me.  It also doesn't make sense to me that he appears to have friends and acquaintances that attempt to help him out with his depression, seem to get nowhere with it, and yet continue to attempt to keep working on him. Most people would move on.

The creepy part of the story is how he handles his heart patient, his dead lover's Mother. He shows up at her home, unannounced, tells his sad story, and burdens her and the lover's Father with all his stuff, stored up over the past 10 year. The Father seems a decent sort and attempts to help him out. But his Sad Sack routine should not have been visited on his patient. He should have been dealing with it in a more appropriate way.

It was hard to believe that the young soldier, Tom, who made a serious play for Yossi, would have been realistically attracted to him. From the looks of him, and his bubbly personality, and major attractiveness, choosing someone as depressed and with such poor self esteem as Yossi would have been a choice  way down on the list of possible applicants for his heart.

It would have been very interesting if Eytan had gone into the psychology of why Tom would find Yossi attractive and pursue him with such ardor. Clearing up that information would have added a great deal to the film and helped make the story much better. Instead, he slapped on this happy ending to the film, way too soon, without examining the psychology behind it ,and what lead up to it.

Unfortunately, the film was a disappointment that could have been much better with a longer and more inclusive story. Eytam sure had the actors and the story idea to do it.",1370908800,3,2335,4.6392251815980625
5200412,5,B009050H0Y,Chad Knoller was fine actor. Honest depiction of a real problem. It was affecting  his job and his health. Subtitles were easy to follow. Excellent sequel.,1370908800,,155,4.961538461538462
5200413,5,B009050H0Y,It's very realistic to portrait a person who is gay and single and 30ish and overworked. I really like it. Highly recommended!!,1370736000,,127,4.818181818181818
5200414,5,B009050H0Y,"The sequel to the Yossi and Jagger storyline meets all expectations I had. It portrayed the struggle of an individual unable to come to term with his loss and thereby leading a miserable life. A chance encounter with someone makes him aware of what he had been missing, allowing him to to embrace life and love and live in the moment",1370649600,,333,4.475409836065574
5200415,5,B009050H0Y,"Each Eytan Fox movie I have watched has been worth the time spent. Some more so than others. I found this continuation of Yossi's life interesting because he does not seem the dominant, powerful character he was in Yossi & Jagger. His character is well developed and progresses in an understandable and reasonable way, although not always as expected. Eytan Fox seems to usually leave just a little mystery and room for interpretation, which I enjoy. His movies are usually rich in human warmth and visual beauty. In Yossi I would have enjoyed a little more intimacy/sensuality, but it was still great without it.",1370649600,,613,4.903846153846154
5200416,4,B009050H0Y,Not sugar coated but real life. As a gay man I found it to be a realistic portrayal of life. The outcome is not always as happy as shown but quite often is  in todays world.,1370390400,2,173,3.8055555555555554
5200417,5,B009050H0Y,"I enjoyed the first film as a view into the Israeli Army ,and the complexity of being a gay indiviual there  at that time,not to mention the problems it posed for the main characters. In the end it was Bittersweet as Yossi finally realized the sadness he had reaped while keeing his relationship a secret,and never truly professing the Love that he felt for Jagger. In this sequel we find that although he has spent 10 years of his life,fulfilling his professional goals,his emotional life has been put on hold with a seeming endless series of experiences that lacked intimacy or meaning. All this very well presented ,developed , written, and directed by Fox. Yes it's believeable. The best part is that just as we might have hoped for him , this time around he's learned a valuable lesson,and the ride we take with he ,and his new teacher is well worth it.",1370390400,,858,4.607843137254902

It proves the love, tru-love, will find its way no matter what the circumstances.  NJMJr!",1370304000,,394,4.36986301369863
