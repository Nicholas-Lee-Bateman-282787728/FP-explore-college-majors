Very educational, positive, playful, has kids and faces.",1389312000,,197,4.6571428571428575
8160753,5,B000LC3RXO,"My son loves all of the Lots To Learn Videos.  Unlike most vidoes, the Lots to Learn vidoes keep his attention the whole time.  Buster and Gatto are so cute and make him laugh, and the songs are very catchy.  Best of all, they are educational so I don't feel guilty sitting him in front of the TV because I know he is going to learn.  I highly recommend all of these videos.",1226880000,,374,4.082191780821918

After trying everything else out there, these Lots To Learn DVDS, including this latest one exploring Animals, prove to be the best, most entertaining and creative. Good old fashioned fun for the whole family.",1217808000,,282,4.895833333333333
8160755,5,B000LC3RXO,"My boys, 2 and 4, absolutely love the Lots to Learn series of DVD's.  Each DVD has segments that teach a variety of concepts.  Each has a complete song with coordinating motions and also their version of an ABC song, and this video includes animals in the alphabet.  We bought the first one when my boys were almost 3 and 18 months and they ask for them every day.  I highly recommend these DVD's for children with short attention spans who are very visual.",1204156800,2,457,4.404761904761905
8160756,5,B000LC3RXO,"Lots To Learn added even more of the puppet dog Buster in this third DVD, and the kids are mesmerized.  They laugh, sing and learn all at the same time.  I got the triple,  all 3 DVDs for my neice.  Great quality.",1192060800,,213,4.0
