Every cartoonish Jew there is in movies appears here in its most unpleasant typecast. The scheming/screaming mom, the tacky princess, the slimy groom, the bickering old couple, the niggardly miser married to the bejeweled fat lady with the hooked nose, you name it. Surely, the plot revolves around Suzie becoming her own woman and choosing the man she loves, much to the chagrin of her reluctant parents. Predictably, she choses Love over Faith, but the way Judaism is depicted makes you wonder what took her so long. The movie sways all too often between merciless satire and downright bigotry, up to a point where one has to wear an armband in black uniform to find it amusing -let alone poignant. For a much better movie on the same subject, try watching LEON THE PIG FARMER; that is if you can find it.

P.S.: One of the most annoying clichs in movies is the background chord to denote the ethnicity of a character whenever it appears onscreen. Asians get tubular bells, Irishmen get the pipes, Spaniards (even Mexicans!) get Andalusian guitars, and Jews, a clarinet tune. In this movie there is not one single Jewish scene without one. Enough already; point taken!",1278892800,2,1346,4.873362445414847

I so wanted to bring a copy home to share with my family and friends but Uk DVD's aren't compatible with American DVD players.  Hopefully, soon.  Can't wait to see it again.",1158451200,4,334,4.892857142857143
