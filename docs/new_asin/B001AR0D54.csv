3464887,3,B001AR0D54,"This film has a plot that has appeared in so many westerns that it is almost embarrassing to describe it. Lou Diamond Phillips is called a ""lone rider,"" we find out at the end of the film, because he is not married, but obviously, we are expected to understand that he will all alone stand against evil forces, which does not happen in this film. He has a buddy and family and friends. He is returning to have peace finally after fighting in a war.
The plot is that an ex-army man (a hero in this film) returns home (retired in this film) and finds that his boyhood friend has taken over the town as well as his girlfriend, who he married, and now wants to take the home and business of his parents. He has already forced other town people to sell to him. Now, Lou will stand up to him, and there will be a fight, including dynamite.",1461196800,,833,4.2125

3464929,3,B001AR0D54,"Nicely done...BUT does anyone know if this was originally shown on the Lifetime channel? I ask because it is very similar to a western TV movie I caught up with recently that they produced starring Luke Perry called ""The Pledge."" In fact, ALL of Lifetime's westerns that I've seen are ""revenge"" westerns. Again, they're well done - but extremely predictable.",1405987200,,358,4.983333333333333

3464934,4,B001AR0D54,"Not as good as "" A Trail To Hope ROse"" but none the less it is a well rounded western and what I would consider a ""SLEEPER"" wath it, you will not regret it.  LDP is , as usual at the top of his game.  I loved it....",1388448000,,215,3.4583333333333335
3464935,1,B001AR0D54,This is truly awful.  It's like those bad b movies that scifi channel makes for tv only it's a western.  I'm not sure what makes a movie appear this bad but whatever it is this one's got it.  I last about 12 minutes and couldn't stomach any more.  It's cheese.,1384473600,,260,4.14

3464952,4,B001AR0D54,"Good movie for the price; always liked Lou Diamond Phillips in Western movies. Good story line and good action, and it shows some of the truths of prejudice against Native Americans that occurred well into the 20th century.",1354665600,3,223,4.894736842105263
3464953,3,B001AR0D54,"This is a made for television western that is on par with many.....70's or 80's style television westerns.  While not deplorable, it is far from what I was looking for, or expected given the high reviews here.  There are some good performances.  And some not so good.  The story-line is interesting but not overly so.  It does get better as the movie progresses.

Lou diamond Phillips does a good job in his role as Bobby Hattaway, decorated calvaryman.  He retires and returns home to find his childhood friend Stu (Vincent Spano good performance) has turned into the classic greedy, corrupt, and power hungry monster without any conscience that is so common for this genre.  As this becomes more evident throughout the film, conflict between the two escalates culminating in the showdown that is always necessary.  Tom Schanley's character Mike Butler, an army bud of Bobby's, adds some needed color and turns in a very good performance, though small as it is.  Timothy Bottoms as the sheriff gives a good performance as well.

Anyway, to me, this was not as good as is implied here, but better than the more critical reviews.  It's worth watching and owning, cheap, say $5 including shipping and should be rated about 3.5 stars.  If you ignore the high praises sung here, and do not expect a stellar western, and view it from that perspective, you will most likely enjoy this and watch it very infrequently as a change of pace.  Thanks!",1348617600,9,1439,4.796747967479675
3464954,4,B001AR0D54,"This is an action western with Lou Diamond Phillips.  He's up to doing his usual fantastic acting job. It's a ""Keeper!""",1348099200,,119,4.666666666666667
3464955,2,B001AR0D54,"This is the worst kind of made for TV / straight to DVD trash western out there. I can't believe this ever got a positive review. If you're looking for something that blows this nonsense out of the water, try ""Open Range"" with Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner. It's a real shame, because Lou Diamond Phillips is capable of a lot better.",1341014400,,335,4.419354838709677
3464956,4,B001AR0D54,"First up, I confess to being a fan of the westerd genre, particulary those from the 50s and 60s. That said, I enjoyed Lone Rider. It is most definitely not a revionist western. Modern, certainly but with a respect to the golden age. The white hat/black hat theme is continued here. As are most westerns this one is about the baddies getting their comeuppance at the hands of a reluctant hero, in this caseLou Diampnd Phillips. He carries the part well, as he usually does. Everything you could wish for is here, horse chases, shootouts, robbery and naturally murder. I almost forgot, two lovely female leads. The location shooting is filmed beautifully. I recommend this one to all lovers of good westerns. Enjoy!",1330300800,4,713,4.804878048780488
