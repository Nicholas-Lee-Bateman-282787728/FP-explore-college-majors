8179052,2,B000NK0P0M,"A great story by Zane Grey and I am sure it was a fine film with a great production value, fine location photography by
master cinematographer Bert Glenon(of ""Stagecoach"" fame).  Unfortunately the quality of this particular DVD was rather poor.
The most of scenes are ""washed out"", I felt rather uncomfortable watching it.",1379980800,,322,5.0754716981132075
8179053,5,B000NK0P0M,"This is not a B western..it is an A film. Jack Holt was a leading man during the silent era and early sound films. He is aided by Billie Dove, Noah Berry Sr., Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and a cameo role of a young super star to be Gary Cooper....look for him as a bad guy.  Jack Holt was the father of Tim and Jennifer Holt and the inspiration for the original drawing of the square jawed,  crime fighter - Dick Tracy.

Filmed on location, where the master story teller, Zane Grey set the play, it is one of the best silent westerns you can find. It rates up there near The Iron Horse,  The Winning of Barbara Worth and The Thee Badmen.

It is a favorite of mine in my collection of western films; silent and talkies. If you appreciate Hollywood's golden era, and value the silent cinema, you'll enjoy this film.
