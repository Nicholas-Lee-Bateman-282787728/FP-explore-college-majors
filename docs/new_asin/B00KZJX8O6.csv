6454797,4,B00KZJX8O6,"This is a story about a boy who likes to skate and is shy. It is the story about a girl who has a small crush on her football coach and baby sits his son occasionally. The boy and girl like one another but there are other elements and bouts of teenage drinking happening. This is the sort of film that explores whats happening in the teen culture,  in a way the ""behind the scenes"" of music acts like Smashing Pumpkins, Silversun Pickups and all those videos you watch where teenagers are experimenting with sex, alcohol and drugs.

What makes this film different?
The likable protagonist, the varied nature of its characters, the OUTSTANDING MUSIC and the unpredictability of the story. There is this uneasy feeling of a storm coming towards the end and the viewer may appreciate the gravity, intensity with which it all takes place. It acts all casual, all the while something brimming in the under-suface.

Great camera work. Very good dialogues. The story would not have been easy to explicate without the amazing acting, the cool nonchalance of its screenplay and so on.

I strongly recommend it. Jack Kilmer was the hero of the film for me. I laughed out loud in one scene and repeated it too.",1407456000,4,1199,4.6415094339622645
6454798,4,B00KZJX8O6,"""I'm not Bob!"" April (Roberts) is a shy student struggling through high school. Her love life consists of being torn between her crush Teddy and her soccer coach (Franco). Her friend Emily isn't shy about sex and begins a relationship with Teddy's friend Fred who is a real loose cannon. Together the 5 of them try to make it through the year alive. This is a hard movie to talk about with out either going into too much minute detail or giving away parts of the movie. The best way to talk about this is by saying that this is another coming-of-age movie. I once again have to repeat my statement that Emma Roberts will eventually win an Oscar, my guess is sooner rather then later. After movies like this and Adult World it's only a matter of time. Speaking of that movie if you liked Adult World you will like this one as well. It has the same type of feel with a little but of Perks Of Being A Wallflower thrown in. Again there isn't really a whole lot I can say about the actual movie without being boring or giving away too much but I can say that I really enjoyed this and I recommend this. Overall, if you liked Perks Of Being A Wallflower then watch this, you will love it. I give this a B+.",1407369600,2,1200,4.221739130434782
6454799,5,B00KZJX8O6,"Palo Alto is not an easy movie to watch.  James Franco has depicted a society where drugs  and boredom are rampant and affluent teens drift through a world, largely ignored by the adults who ought to be helping them.  Teddy (Jack Kilmer) steals the show as a sensitive but directionless suburban teen who is perpetually wasted and never far away from trouble.  When he hits another vehicle while driving drunk and stoned, the police track him down to his own driveway.  The woman in the car with the policeman (the victim of the hit-and-run) gets out of the car and, upon seeing Teddy, exclaims Its a kid!  - an observation which seems to escape everyone else.

Teddy, it turns out, has done this sort of thing before; but instead of a stiff penalty, and despite the fact that Teddy is totally disrespectful to the cops, he gets another slap on the wrist: community service at a childrens library and face-to-face apology to the woman he hit with his vehicle.  In the restaurant where he meets to apologize to the woman, she totally excuses his actions, to his evident surprise, because he is an alcoholic, and cant be held responsible for this disease.  An old man sitting next to Teddy in the booth, probably the womans dad, says, Yeah, but if you're an alcoholic, and then you drive drunk, you're an a..hole.  Teddy smiles secretly to himself (because its true), but totally buys in to the alcoholism way of explaining things; it lets him off the hook, but it does not help him in any way because it fails to connect with him as a person, rather than a category of persons such as teen or alcoholic.

Time and again in this movie we see the authority figures not caring for their charges - moms, dads, probation officers, coaches, - all treating the youngsters as categories of people, but not treating them as people.  This is what it feels like to be unloved (a theme which emerges).  When Teddy comes back from his sentencing, his mom gives him a perfunctory hug in the kitchen and says some kind of be good, I love you phrase, which allows everyone to move on and ignore the real problem.  The ultimate betrayal, that of a teacher sleeping with a student, is a similar act of uncaring exploitation.  Nobody comes off well here.  Girls at parties being promiscuous because they think thats what they ought to do, parents always on the phone, absent, pretending to care but not caring much, and teachers saying things like my job is to listen, but not meaning it .. this is the world these youngsters inhabit.  It is a world of posturing and lies, and the kids see through it, even if the adults dont.

I may or may not watch this movie again.  Its difficult at times to stick with it.  But Im glad I saw it, and Im certain that its an important movie.  The cinematography and camera work here are outstanding, and the ensemble of characters are well chosen.  There is some very subtle acting amidst the stupidity, and a lot of loneliness and despair from kids who have been bathed in adult temptations and then left to their own devices.  In the end, there is some hopefulness, but it does not come from the adults.  Watch this movie.",1407196800,100,3140,4.536412078152753
6454800,2,B00KZJX8O6,"Around the time of the Tribeca Film Festival there seemed to be a lot of buzz about this movie. Showings were sold out, James Franco was in trouble for hitting on a minor, and it somehow became the star movie for the festival. Fast forward a few months later and I finally get to see it and, well I don't understand the hype. See reasons why below.

Characters & Story
The film splits the focus three ways: One plot dealing with April (Emma Roberts) who likes Teddy (Jack Kilmer), but spends most of the movie instead messing around with her soccer coach Mr. B (James Franco); then you have Teddy dealing with getting probation for a hit and run, as well as dealing with his friend Fred (Nat Wolff) and the odd situations he puts them in; and lastly there is Fred who is the ultimate douche bag. Someone who isn't redeemable in any sense of the word, and yet strangely gains the affections of this nice girl Emily (Zoe Levin) who finds him cute and entertaining. At first anyway.

Praise
Being that I focus more on the story and characters than how something is shot, honestly there isn't much to praise here. Roberts is the same teenage girl she usually is, and neither Kilmer or Wolff really have the type of stories which draw you in. However, I will say Wolff is guaranteed to upset you so if you consider an actor making you hate their character something praise worthy, well that perhaps is the sole praise I can give this movie.

Criticism
If just because this whole film seems like a really crappy show that was probably pitched to MTV and rejected. Starting with April, as with many of Roberts roles she plays someone who seems so angst ridden and annoying that you just want to tune her out. As for Teddy, when he is not paired with Fred his story seems aimless, and the young man who plays him seems to have more in the way of looks than talent. Though perhaps it isn't so much him as his story. Then, as for Freds plot, the character himself is insufferable and is just one of those bastards who make it so the sole reason you keep watching the film is just to see him get his comeuppance. Of which we don't really get a true moment of satisfaction where his douche ways comeback on him.

And as for the overall story, it pretty much is watching a bunch of teens party, drink, smoke, and repeat. Sprinkled in there we may watch April deal with the ever so creepy James Franco, Teddy deal with community service, and Fred mess around with Emily, but none of these stories are developed to the point where they are interesting. In the long run, I would argue the power of the name Coppola, the fact both James Franco and Emma Roberts have star power, and because Hollywood loves a good film about teens drinking and doing drugs, are the sole reasons this movie was made.

Overall: Skip It
Films like these help remind me that it isn't just blockbuster films which can come off lazy. Also films with modest budgets can seem like there was no attempt to standout and present fresh ideas or stories. Though what this film probably taught me the most is that all you need is a recognizable name, which brings financial backing, if you want to put a film out. Leading to one of the key reasons Im labeling this as something to skip: Its overhyped, underdeveloped, and looks like it mimicked all the most boring aspects of similar films and mashed them up together. Thus creating a film which may only keeps you interested for you are hoping someone kicks Freds ass eventually.",1407024000,4,3481,4.45839874411303
6454801,4,B00KZJX8O6,"In her directorial debut, 27-year-old writer/director Gia Coppola recalls her niece, Sofia, more than her grandfather, Francis Ford.  The film, Palo Alto, based on short stories by co-star James Franco, is an anxious daydream of a film chronicling the coming of age of a few troubled teenagers in the titular Northern California city.  Among them is the smart, yet shy April (Emma Roberts), who engages in inappropriate flirtation with her older soccer coach, played by Franco.  The film is not defined by a sense of propulsion, but rather its sincerity, its concern for its characters' ethical conundrums, and a general air of authentic melancholy.  Everyone delivers a capable performance without overshadowing the other members of the ensemble; after years in the spotlight, this is far and away Roberts' most engaging and relaxed turn.  There are a few questionable storytelling and stylistic decisionsa disturbing house-party gang rape is related as an afterthought via almost wistful voice-overand the film is never as beautiful, moving, or sensual as the masterful The Virgin Suicides (a hard comparison to avoid), but the latest-to-the-game Coppola otherwise acquits herself nicely, confidently drawing the audience into the private lives and longings of the adolescent characters.",1407024000,2,1289,5.522842639593908
6454802,4,B00KZJX8O6,"""Palo Alto"" (2013 release; 98 min.) brings the story of a group of high school kids. As to movie opens, we see best buddies Fred (played by Nat Wolff) and Teddy (played by Jack Kilmer, yes son of Val--who also appears in the movie) sitting in the car in an empty parking lot. Fred eventually rams the car into a wall from short distance, freaking Teddy out. We also get to know April (played by Emma Roberts, yes Julia is her aunt), who is on the girls soccer team, coached by Mr. B. (played by James Franco). Soon a theme emerges: what most high school kids care about is to party, get wasted and smoke pot, and that's about it. After one of those parties, Teddy, driving under the influence, hits another car. He barely avoids juve and must do 150 hrs. of community service in the local library. At this point we're a good 20 min. into the movie and to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the big screen directing debut of Gia Coppola, yes THAT Coppola. Francis Ford is her grandfather and Sofia is her aunt. Gia was a mere 25 years old when this movie was shot. You can't help but wonder at the parallel between this and ""The Virgin Suicides"", Sofia's debut (when she was herself only 26 or so). Second, the movie is based on James Franco's book ""Palo Alto Stories"" of a few years ago. I have not read that collection of short stories, so I can't comment how close the movie has stuck (or not) to the original stories. Third, Jack Kilmer absolutely steals the movie with his performance of the vulnerable Teddy. We surely have not seen the last of him. And Emma Roberts of course confirms all the good things that we have seen of her before, although hopefully she won't be playing a 16 yr. old high school kid much longer (she's now 23). ""Palo Alto"" contains so many ""big"" and ""promising"" names, and while it certainly is an intriguing debut, the movie fails to truly set itself apart from other ""coming-of-age"" movies. For me it feels like the sums of the parts don't make up the whole.

I saw ""Palo Alto"" in early May at the Lincoln Center Film Society in New York, and the matinee screening where I saw this at was strongly attended, somewhat to my surprise. Bottom line: ""Palo Alto"" is worth checking out, shortcomings and all, be it in the theaters or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1402963200,13,2386,4.420454545454546
6454803,5,B00KZJX8O6,"The movie is not for everyone. A very accurate portrayal of the darker parts of life for those of that age, (at least in that area I can say). If you're ready to analyze the actions and dialogue this movie will be great. If you're looking just to kill time and be entertained, this might not be for you.",1501977600,,303,4.1525423728813555
6454804,3,B00KZJX8O6,The only reason this movie is getting 3 stars is because I had a similar experience in high school as the kids did in the movie.  Other than that I would not recommend this to most people.  It is bizarre and extremely strange and jumps around between charters to much and does not provide a sufficient backstory for any of them.  If you do watch it though just remember... Don't be Bob.,1501891200,,386,4.333333333333333
6454805,3,B00KZJX8O6,"Had great potential, but...it just missed. The Fred character was so horribly repugnant that the ending was more a relief than anything else. The two teenage leads weren't really all that bad, just hopelessly closed to self-examination and the honesty it would take to change. They seemed to have good hearts and mostly benign intentions. Idiots, though. One big shortcoming of the film is that it completely sidestepped the issue of WHY they were like this, when they had benign (though bad) parents and so many advantages. Their motivations were not adequately explored, especially with April. They were realistically drawn and portrayed, the story just didn't go deep enough. The acting, though, was outstanding all around. Overall, the movie was very realistic, and did well in avoiding the usual pitfalls with movies like this. But Fred should've either been drawn sympathetically or cut altogether. He just had no redeeming qualities, and seemed like a narcissist. Even knowing the truth, it was impossible to empathize with someone so selfish: he only cared about his own suffering, and just didn't give a damn what anyone else was going through. In stark contrast to the others, he showed zero compassion for ANYONE else throughout the entire film, not even his alleged best friend. Worse, he seemed predatory, even leaving perverted drawings in a children's book at a children's library...very creepy. Good ending.",1500940800,2,1423,5.218340611353712
6454806,4,B00KZJX8O6,"(For the most part.)

Here are some things to know about this movie:

Gia Coppola (Francis Ford Coppolas granddaughter) directed, her first outing. She also wrote the screenplay based on James Francos short story collection also entitled Palo Alto. She was 25-years-old at the time.

Emma Roberts who plays April and was 22-years-old when this film was released in 2013 is Julia Roberts niece. Her father is Eric Roberts (467 credits as an actor).

Palo Alto, California is an upscale Silicon Valley community and home to Stanford University.

Franco, who plays soccer coach Mr. B, is from Palo Alto. He has a degree in English with a concentration in creative writing from UCLA.

There are no helicoptering parents in this movie.

Initially I had a lot of trouble watching this because of all the unnecessary cigarette smoking apparently as product placements. Its sad that some producers cant get funding without taking big tobaccos money. However, Ill give that a pass since some of the smoking had relevance to the storyor stories. The viewer can see that Coppola cleverly weaved parts of Francos various stories and characters into a mostly coherent whole that plays as a larger story.

The other problem for me was the intensity and raw teenage emotional abandonment depicted. This is life lived in the fast lane when you're still living at home and have an incredible need for experiences, sometimes regardless of the consequences. In this regard Palo Alto can be compared to Nerve (2016) which also starred the very pretty Emma Roberts.

6454811,4,B00KZJX8O6,"I had just seen Virgin Suicides before this, and though this is Gia Coppola's debut directorial film, I see a lot of similarities in the two films.  Like most coming of age films, it touches on all the usual themes- sex, drugs, and mischief in the midst growing up.  It doesn't shy away from reality and it is finely acted by all actors in their respective roles.  The one downside is the overall plotline...the film always feels like it's building up to something but fails to actually get there.  It touches on a lot of different subjects through varying subplots but struggles to resolve itself by the end of the film.  You're left feeling an emptiness for the characters in the sense that their stories were left in a vague and disarranged plot. In short, the filmmakers & writers embarked on a raw, melancholy depiction of life; successfully portraying the lives of young teenagers but failing to end the film with anything that will leave with you after watching.

The silver lining is the actors particularly Emma Roberts and Jack Kilmer.  The directing is also well done...but that's is to be expected coming from a Coppola.",1495324800,,1132,4.744897959183674

6454856,5,B00KZJX8O6,"Aside from the overflowing of negative reviews here, Palo Alto has been one of the best movies I've watched this year alone. As someone who's about to graduate college, I resonated with this film so much in that it captured my often monotonous, alcohol-fueled life of high school. If you're one of those who favor drama-packed movies with standardized plot lines, this movie isn't for you. Palo Alto is beautiful depiction of the fleeting moments of teenage youth, when we're all experiencing things for the first time -- those times I personally hold of great value. I praise Gia Coppola and James Franco for producing such a well-constructed movie.

Gia, Franco, and some seriously dumb stories, and nothing to do with the title, nor or city, this depressing convoluted mess is a nonsensical dystopian hell and the lowest rung of teen morons wasting life.

It is a good thing that Gia Coppola has family money to rely on! As the directing on its own is enough to make your stomach churn and feel like you've been food poisoned. And what stories would like thse could or would inspire a movie? Very-very sad, that if this is even a sliver of James Franco's boring and depressing childhood in -- very multifaceted and fun city to grow up in -- Palo Alto, then a story (or stories) best kept in that box in his parents attic.

The young teenage girls are the equivalent to sexual roadkill in a world dominated by straggly little fowl mouthed boys and disrespectful lowlife adult men. The two main characters are depicted as ignorant push-over types who can barely stand on their own two feet or think for themselves and are therefore taken advantage of at every turn. The only ""parents"" or adults depicted here are manipulative, abusive, sexual predators and the kids are just desperate little punks that everyone--adults and peers alike--wants to abuse. It's sad, and disgusting.

I will say that the film makes a pass by the point that amongst coming of age in America where needing to feel like a desirable, sexual being is young kid's focus in their lives, kids are caught up in their own recklessness out of desperation to be ""cool"" while being told to plan a future for themselves.

Palo Alto however lacks the writers Freaks and Geeks had that came up with ways for a stoned loser such as Daniel Desario to be entertaining, while showing audiences he wasn't ever likely to achieve much with his life.  Palo Alto is based on the novel written by Franco, I haven't read that one and don't plan to after seeing this film, perhaps it is better than this movie but that wouldn't be hard.  Basically this film revolves around the self destructed lives of four teens, two male, two female.  One male isn't that bright and the drugs inside him don't make his decision making any better. He seems like he might be a nice kid if given the right direction but unfortunately for him his best friend is an even bigger loser than him.  The two have a conversation of what you would do if you killed someone while driving high, then not long after get to put that into action when they side swipe a car at an intersection.  Meanwhile a hot girl has a reputation for sucking anything in other male student pants and never really gets why no one really likes her or treats her with respect.  Another girl is being groomed by the school soccer teacher (Franco) who books her to babysit, at times even when the kids aren't home.

There's really nothing going for this movie, it's not entertaining, it doesn't have likeable characters that you care what happens to them, nor does it give any sort of realistic representation of teenagers today.",1431734400,5,1677,4.54485049833887

Crisis comes to everyone at some point in life, and this film depicts several characters whose crises occur in high school.  The plots of the various characters were understated and rather inconsequential by normal Hollywood standards and that is the reality for most people.  The focus is rather on the very real fears and pains these kids face.

The culture is depicted faithfully and believably.

6455210,5,B00KZJX8O6,"Gia Coppola is a gifted filmmaker. This film is a joy to watch. What she does with the camera and the dialog in Palo Alto is magic.
Though most of the movie delves into dark and desperate nooks of Silicon Valley teen life, Coppola's deft, poetic touch creates poetry on the screen throughout.

 In one of the opening scenes, a few of the girls on James Franco's (the Coach) soccer team are sitting around on the field, post-practice,  making malicious small-talk just out of earshot (maybe) of the Coach. The genuineness of the lines and delivery is extraordinary.

Coppola's ability to draw from the deepest depths in her characters is highlighted in a couple of scenes that stick in my mind.

One is a queasy, anti-romantic scene between the Emma Roberts's-character and her Coach. The scene is presented in a short, dreamy succession of still shots that pass by like a fitful dream. It's been on it's way since that early, post-practice, scene where the girls were gossiping and lacing their shoes. In terms of screen film board ratings, very little is shown. In terms of character revelation, the fleeting images show everything.

The other scene, a tour de force, consists of a skirmish by a swimming pool with featuring a menacingly swung whiskey bottle and a girl in the pool, occurring near latter portion of the movie. The depths the director draws from both the antagonists is amazing. I was on the edge of my seat from second to second about what each character might do next. It is a scene so fraught with believable emotion, I wonder if it clash wasn't a painful experience for the actors to portray and then, later, recover from.

After seeing the movie, I went to buy the book. I wanted to see how much of the movie's brilliance came from the book (James Franco wrote it). Give most of the credit to Gia Coppola. She ties Franco's disjointed monologues into a coherent, quick-moving story with a fascinating interplay of characters.  Still, credit Franco for enlisting and supporting Gia Coppola, and for writing an ambitous book full of possibilities for the right movie director. His choice of Coppola to direct the film was brilliant, based, from what I read about it, on his familiarity with her work as a photographer.

Where the book plays Palo Alto as a sick Silicon Valley teen dystopia, Coppola colors the the town's darkness with wonder. In the end, Coppola isn't satisfied to make Palo Alto anything less than a mysterious, adventurous love story, in which the incredible seems to come true fairy-tale-like, right before your eyes. The ending, culminating in a beautifully-conceived receding-camera shot, on the heels of a secret just revealed, is as good as anything ever in the flicks, I think.",1427846400,2,2722,4.824034334763948

My Own Private Idaho, Jawbreaker, Half Nelson, The Basketball Diaries, Heathers, Brick, Kids, The River's Edge-- hell, even Superbad--tackle these issues with more aplomb.

 If you watching because of Franco take note he is only on screen for a short period of time and the love scene was hella awkward.  Emma Roberts is difficult to swallow as naive. Frankly, she exudes bitchy from her very core.

I watch tons of films and its a rare one that makes me want to bang my head on the keys of my keyboard, but the neon signs pointing to the symbolism in the movie made me squirm a bit in my seat in embarrassment for the filmmakers.

The montage storyline of Palo Alto borrows from the high school angst of Fast Times and Superbad, without any of the levity - but overall it works. It is worth watching for the excellent performances by Jack Kilmer, Emma Roberts and Nat Wolff. Jack Kilmer is part Beck, part Michael Cera, part Johnny Depp and is the center, although loosely, of the movie.  He is a budding superstar.  James Franco's performance is tortured and Val Kilmer's brief role as the stoner stepfather is a pimple you wish would go away.

Definitely could have used more depth of character for the protagonist and for other major characters. I'm giving an extra star because a) Coppola's directing works for me, b) Franco/Coppola knew to keep the teacher character viewed as inappropriate instead of trying to make the student character into an enticing sexual figure. And c) I appreciate trying to mask some of the sexual violence against women scenes, but I argue that if you're going to employ these scenes, there should be a reason, not just to remind young women to mind their chastity. It's worth watching if you like the genre, enjoy Coppola styling, and/or need a film to critique - especially if you're a women's studies scholar.",1416614400,,922,4.841772151898734
6455642,4,B00KZJX8O6,"While reading the reviews of others for this film, two things were repeated often: namely that the movie is ""poignant"" and ""boring"".
That maybe so, but it is still better than most c(r)ap that comes out of Hollywood these days.  On the aspect of ""poignant"" I would even go further by stating that the film has nihilistic undertones.  There are three main ""love"" stories here.  One dealing with the mutual, yet undisclosed, affection between two high school seniors April (main female character) and Teddy (main male character). Second one is the crush April has on her soccer coach played by James Franco, who also finds April irresistible.  Third story involves, Teddy's friend Fred and school's quiet nymphomaniac (who enjoys giving head) Emily.  My favorite of the three was the story between April and James Franco, too bad it was short and not so elaborative as the other two.

What holds this film together is an outstanding, very indie soundtrack. The tunes make this film more bearable to watch.
Actually, the best part of this film is the music, good looks of Emma Roberts, and good acting by James Franco.

In short, the film deals with several issues, to name some: luck of parental support and love, peer-pressure, first love, destructive life style, and hidden homosexuality and even sexual molestation...

6455713,5,B00KZJX8O6,"Seldom do American films contain such potent levels of tenderness and truth.  There are, of course, the exceptions, particularly from the 70s, like Midnight Cowboy, or a real favorite for me, Save the Tiger (but I suppose I'm biased toward that decade).  Oh, I'm well aware of American films packing the power of this combo of tenderness and truth.  They've popped up every decade since D.W. Griffith was cranking a camera.  Having said than, tenderness and truth (or, really, the cocktail of them) just seem more prevalent to the cinema of Europe, or Central and South America, or even the little of what I've seen find its way out of the Middle East.

Palo Alto opens with this one-two punch in its first two minutes and never stops delivering this blended quality, even as it rises to comic highs and dips to lonely despair, especially the despair of the beautilful and emotionally-starved Emily (Zoe Levin), who is not a main character but who is arguably the most poignant character among the film's ensemble cast.

I will spare a summary of the movie, except to say there are three protagonists: Teddy, played astutely by Jack Kilmer in his debut screen performance, April (Emma Roberts) in what so far must be her richest performance, and Fred (the multi-talented Nat Wolff) who manages to deliver some of recent cinema's most brutally honest dialogue with a candor that makes all our seasoned and genuinely great actors appear jaded.

Every scene, every set piece is worth relishing, many for entirely different reasons--the film is not a one-note story; quite the opposite: Gia Coppola is exploring a palette of themes and characters that, while various, feel all of a one thanks to the unflagging tone, which is as palpable and confident as any the great P. T. Anderson has delivered.  And I do think P. T. Anderson IS great.

I have no idea if the young Coppola will be able to repeat such a feat, to ""bring out"" again.  I hope so.  I hope this was not the serendiptous fluke of a first-timer.  If it is not, she may prove to be the most formidable Coppola since her grandfather's work of the 70s.

I will finish this now (because I don't much care for writing these things) by saying that I am an English teacher who shows too many films to my students--a habit justified by the fact that I show only movies they've never seen and often never heard of for the simple result of growing their world views--and EVERY student in the three classes who saw it, LOVED it, so go ahead and multiple my five-star review by about one-hundred and twenty.",1415404800,2,2554,4.674107142857143

Not sure why movies try to convince us that the kids doing all the partying are really full of pain and angst inside. I'm guessing the kids who don't get invited are lonelier.

6455822,5,B00KZJX8O6,"To me, this movie was about April and Teddy, and how their lives deteriorated as they made bad choices.

In the world of Palo Alto, everyone suffers from a sort of existential despair, where everyone is rich and successful, but there isn't a lot of meaning to be found in life.

One thing that can have honest meaning is love, the sort of animal magnetism between two people who really compliment each other. Enter April and Teddy. They both feel the lack of each other. But as they fail to make the effort to bring themselves together, they orbit the other characters in their world, more lost souls with a gravity that pulls floating people in and exposes them to the trauma of meaninglessness.

Finally, when the two break free from the s***y orbits they'e sucked into, they have something to look forward to, some meaning, which makes the meaningless deterioration of their former companions seem unappealing in comparison.

In that way, I thought it was a really coherent screenplay, and it has a positive message at the end. Also, the acting was pretty legitimate and it really wove the magic of the way the world feels in childhood around me for the duration.",1414195200,,1166,4.700980392156863
6455823,2,B00KZJX8O6,"I can""t believe I watched this movie after suffering through Franco's egocentric book.  The film will be viewed differently based on age and experience.  While one viewer may see it as simply a mirror of their high school experience, others will get something else out of it. It wasn't fun, interesting or entertaining. Maybe a fictional documentary of a fictional place in time ? Or maybe more accurately,""Gia's First Film"" assignment based on ""Franco's First Book"".  I can understand the reviewers comment about the wealthy being able to produce their own narcissistic projects simply because they can, shortcutting the normal culling process of artistic expression that assumes a finished film has been found to be worthy enough to be released to the public or at least dvd. A ""vanity"" project. As I really hated Franco's book, I didn't hate the film as much thus the 2 stars, it should have been 1.5 stars

Personally, Jack Kilmer (Teddy)  is a nice combination of both his parents.  He looks alot like his mom and exudes her sensitivity while his dad's voice is apparent. ( I did get a chuckle that Teddy's last name was Morrison - deja vu his dad Val as Jim Morrison)  The casting mirrors the different influences every child struggles to reconcile from all sides. At home there are adult pressures and at school - peer pressure, the issues of puberty, and the real pivitol ethical decision- What kind of person do I choose to be?  Do I chose my destiny or do I just let it chose me?  Do I want to be known as a kind ethical person or a bully who gets what he wants? This is why there was such a disconnect in behavior with Teddy (Jack Kilmer). His ""acting out"" behaviors seemed contrary to what appeared to be his nature. The other teens were going through the same growing pains. Maturing under pressure is the universal experience of every teen . The differences are from amount and severity of adult issues they are forced to deal with.

Unfortunately, the pains of becoming an adult is interfered with by flawed and predatory adults and adult issues. I don't think there is a child in existence that hasn't had to deal with some adult taking advantage of their trust and vulnerability in some way. Their ability to repel adult interference is entirely based on what tools they were, or were not given by parents, school or church to deal with very real ethical issues and boundaries that protect them. Even just recognizing grooming  of children takes education.  Many adults don't recognize manipulation and just plain don't look carefully at what is happening in their child's life and what choices they are making. Note the complete lack of consequences or even comment from parents in the film.

The coach situation was especially disturbing because James Franco was so physically similar to Emma that she could have been his daughter. There are alot of emotionally stunted adults in the world and nothing speaks more obviously than a person that is unable to relate to a partner their own age. An older man with a much younger wife doesn't disturb anyone any more. Every student knew about the Coach, not one reported him.  Not one parent wondered where their daughters were after school or checked. All the responsibility for protection relied entirely on the child who should never have been in the position of protecting themselves. They are left to draw their own conclusions and end up forcing and victimizing other vulnerable people, and themselves again, as the character Fred did the sweet needy Emily.

6455838,4,B00KZJX8O6,"I had heard a few good things about this movie, but it was mostly under the radar in my circles. Between the beautiful Emma Roberts  (We're the Millers, Wild Child) and Margaret Qualley (The Leftovers), and then Franco I thought I would give this a try. Ends up, it was worth giving a try but a few notes:

James Franco wrote some stories that this based on, but it's directed by Gia Coppola. Gia does a great job, but there are a couple of subtleties that Sofia Coppola nailed early in her career (Lost in Translation) that were not quite as smooth here. I can't go so far as to say anything was heavy handed, but there was a...fluency???that seemed to be missing.

Emma Roberts nailed her part as an insecure, beautiful, talented young woman struggling with her transition from ""girl"" to ""woman"", James Franco delivered a solid performance as a charismatic and handsome high school soccer coach manipulating her into an illicit relationship. He's just young and charming enough to make the come-ons feel like the straddle the line between smarmy and pervy and outright creepy manipulation.

That line takes an outsized role in the movie pulling off the central tension of the plot - is he a predator taking advantage of the baby-sitter or is he a young adult making horrible decisions. One is creepy and uncomfortable, one is regrettable and illegal. Either way, your opinion of Mr. Franco going into the movie, will likely determine your rating of the movie in the end as Emma Roberts delivers a great performance as an in transition teen with a cast and screen play full of relatable moments.

Those looking to see more of Ms. Qualley after her superb performance in The Leftovers will be disappointed. Her character is absolutely incidental and you won't see much of her at all.

Worth a watch, not worth 5 stars.",1414022400,2,1818,4.719242902208202

6455852,5,B00KZJX8O6,"Gia's directorial debut rivals that of Sofia's, yet in a much more grittier and angst-ridden manner than the gloominess of Virgin Suicides.

Palo Alto abounds with the symbolism of either choosing to remain an aimless, hell-bent teen, or to follow the quieter path. In fact, we literally see this distinction at the movie's end. So for those saying they got nothing from it or saw no point in it, the only conclusion I can draw is that they were simply not paying attention. Yes, the movie is anecdotally a coming-of-age story, but to describe it as simply that and nothing more-- because that sort of story has been done to death-- is to strip it and skin it of its real power. Gia shows us clearly that there is as much to explore in the teenage world as there is of the future to unfold.

Personally, I was completely engaged by these explorations of teen life-- drugs at a party, driving home wasted, hooking up with the wrong girl or guy, being enamored by the bad influence, getting busted, dismal encounters with authoritative figures-- all of which are represented beautifully and with the just the right amount of despair, and, under Gia's calm direction, these explorations become eye-opening microcosms of the modern teenage wasteland. This film reminds me, now at 28, how lucky I am to be now at 28 after doing all the stupid stuff I did when I was younger.

Emma Roberts is perfect for and in her role, as are Franco and Jack Kilmer. The real star of the show, though, is Nat Wolff (who isn't Bob ((and now you'll have to watch the film))) with his pervading, devilish charm. With his performance alone, the film begins and ends smoothly, subtly, and powerfully. You come to love him as you once loved rebellion, and his character's unraveling is as fascinating to watch as it is terrifying.

And Val Kilmer's cameo is absolutely hysterical.

Another strength of the film is that we are given both a male protagonist and a female protagonist, where their arcs continually overlap and lean on one another, but also remain autonomous.

To skip this film is to miss one of the year's best. Truly engage with it and I promise it will genuinely affect you.",1413936000,4,2164,4.651832460732984

for a directorial debut it felt like he was mimicking the style of ""Elephant"" or ""The Virgin Suicides"" but at least in those story scripts something major happened which made the ""day in the life; following the angst"" story-line easier on the audience. because you got to see how people changed after the 'catastrophic moment'.

maybe it's my fault for having higher expectations?

6455926,3,B00KZJX8O6,"It's kind of hard, if you have seen her aunt's film Virgin Suicides, to not see Gia Coppola's Palo Alto as a sort of Virgin-Suicides-Lite. I am a huge fan of Dev Hynes (Blood Orange / Test Icicles), who provided a perfectly adequate soundtrack, but even the musical score was a lot like a less dark version of what Air provided for the Virgin Suicides. Another film that comes to mind is Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation, in the way it toys with the idea of a younger/older relationship without pushing the concept beyond a mere highly stylized tension-builder.

I don't like rapey scenes, and I'm normally glad when a film like this dodges the option of depicting this in a literal way, but in this case it made the movie less brave. I am not really buying this plot being fed to the press, about how risque it supposedly is for James Franco to have written this story while also being the actor portraying it's most leturous character. It was Gia's decision to give him that challenge anyway. Sure, it's a questionable move, but mainly it failed to distract me from a plot that just kind of sat there. I completely appreciated all the performances and the scenes looked fantastic, much like Lost in Translation, there was not a single movement, pose, gesture, or scenery that was at all out of place, and for the most part the script was sound, but it didn't really all come together for me, as far as any sort of grand artistic statement. Maybe that was the point. The tensions were too safe, the state of humanity was not commented on, and really the film was about nothing. Maybe in that way it said a lot about adolescent life and the sort of depressive malaise of it all, where the social dramas carry more weight than the experiences which should most traumatize a rational person. I am not saying Virgin Suicides had a point, per say, but it's weight felt a lot more real, it seemed to be about something, and if you were to label Palo Alto as ""chiling,"" that would be a stretch. The tensions were sedated.

The plot was meandering, at best, though it's ensemble cast really pushed the source material to it's style limits. It was a slickly cool film to be immersed in for a while, but I question if it ever came together. Bling Ring was saved by being a true story, though it's formula was ultimately consistent with all the films I have mentioned here. There are a lot of movies I love which trail off in the end, like ""Take Shelter"" with sort of a cliffhanger type ending, but this one didn't end with any sort of tension or resolve, and it's traumas were not really trumped up to be that traumatic. Some movies, like A Place Beyond The Pines, only seem to trail off at the end, but provide rich food for thought. I didn't experience that here. For me, as a child of the 80's, Palo Alto read as a very stylish Twilight-era Heathers with most of the violence and comedic irony drained out.

Virgin Suicides sort of made it's point and had a sense of some sort of resolve to the tension, but it's style application here, to Franco's attempt to see Lost in Translation from the youth perspective, comes off as little more than an Instagram filter desaturation of the danger inherent in Harmony Korine's early work, like ""Kids."" Perhaps this film was intended as a multi-level style ode to the films I mentioned, sort of like how the movie Drive payed homage to at least a half dozen other films, but for me it just didn't come together enough, and I felt the same way about Bling Ring. The Copolla family is really gifted at this sort of semi-edgey teen film filled with mopey hipsters, but this was really no better than Spring Breakers (another Harmony Korine thing), which was another film that was a fun ride, but ultimately seemed to lead nowhere, and make no point about anything. I guess the point of these mumble-core films is to be non-objective, AKA pointless.",1412121600,3,3882,4.519203413940256

6455928,5,B00KZJX8O6,"Palo Alto is a promising debut for Gia Coppola as it captures beautifully the lives of a group of intresting teens in California. These teens are interesting because while they may make a few bad choices, they are surprisingly passionate and involved. But this movie isn't about the town or the plot. It's a film that requires a great deal of observation especially in the characters mood, desicions, and tendencies. It's perfectly acted (equally among the entire cast but I was extremely intrigued by newcomer, Jack Kilmer), the music does a wonderful job of making the mood evident, and the cinematography and directing is impeccable. This is a movie that makes you think, its a movie that makes you truly care about the characters in it and their futures. Palo Alto showcases an honest portrayal of these teenagers.

6455948,4,B00KZJX8O6,"Overall, a really really solid movie. I think maybe the people who don't like this movie are reading it wrong. It's not supposed to be high concept, with a super tight plot. It is supposed to be pretty loose in its plot. I really liked the patchy feel to it, and above all, the honesty of the characters, the emotion, and the dialogue. The acting kind of sucks, and is the biggest drag on this movie. Nat Wolff gives the only out and out good performance in the movie. As charming as Emma Roberts is, I believe I am officially tired of her, as she just plays roughly the same character in every movie. There are some problems with the emotionality of the movie - i.e. hugely impactful events are just kind of passed off, but overall, it is believable, and it delves into teenage degeneracy, but in a way that is not menacing, degrading, or offensive. The characters are responding to how bad the situation is, not nihilistically and carelessly creating it. James Franco is pretty solid, although not entirely likable, and his part is surprisingly small. Jack Kilmer rides the dialogue well, but he is not the next Brando. (I don't like Brando, but you see what I'm saying.) Overall, this is a Harmony Korine movie without the degeneracy being offensive. It is a nice, personal and honest tale. I usually hate the degenerate tales, but I can remember being a teenager in the 1990s, and feeling roughly the same way.",1409616000,2,1414,4.592885375494071
