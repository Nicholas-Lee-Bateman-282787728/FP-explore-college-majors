8205618,4,B000SK5YWG,"Arika has gained admittance to Garderobe Academy, but there are people have it in for her. The incident with the uniform was only the beginning. Maki set a trap for her in swimming class that went terribly wrong, and the Queen also dislikes her. In this volume, the Queen and Arika end up getting in a bit of a bind. The only way for them to survive is to form a contract. Upon sealing their contract, they are able to escape. Since they dislike each other, they keep it a secret and try to find a way to nullify their contract. This DVD has a little more action and character development than the 1st one, but I still don't think this series will live up to the original My Hime.",1356307200,,680,4.2384615384615385
8205619,5,B000SK5YWG,5 STARS again because the action/adventure with comedy. IT was worth watching & buying +it is well done and well made. Once again ARIKA makes it funny with others. Now i do not like the speeches of war and death. But the themes about making friends i like very much.,1355961600,,266,4.34
8205620,4,B000SK5YWG,"I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable.
In its way as good as the original My-Hime. Buying from sellers of good used dvds I bought this collection for a price a little less than a collection box set would normally cost. The shipping cost can be reduced if you go directly to the sellers web site when ordering more than one item. Make sure you can trust them.",1253577600,,510,4.322916666666667
