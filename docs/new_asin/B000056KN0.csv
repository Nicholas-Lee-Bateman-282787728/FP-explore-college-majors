1397729,5,B000056KN0,"Well, I've seen the subbed VCDs before and I enjoyed them. If you liked Cardcaptor Sakura and you're ready to graduate to something with highschool characters, this is the anime. Like Cardcaptor Sakura, wands and cards are used but not in the same ways. There's romance and perversion and lots of comedy and flying underwear... You'll have to see for yourself. I loved it very much! It's reccomended if you like other Mahou Shoujo anime.",980726400,2,437,4.84
1397730,5,B000056KN0,"This is one of the best anime series out there.
Totally underrated and under-appreciated.
Its likening to Sailor Moon is not unprecedented. (Ikuko Itoh and Junichi Sato were key creators in both.)
It is true you only get 2 Episodes on each of the first 3 discs (the OVA) but don't believe reviews that say it's too short. There are 14 episodes from Maho Tsukai TV (made after the OVA) on discs 4 to 7 which makes this a longer series than Serial Experiments Lain and/or Hellsing and at this price, a much better buy!",1050883200,10,516,4.442105263157894
1397731,5,B000056KN0,"Magic User's Club (Maho Tsukai Tai) is one of those anime titles that hasn't really made a big name for itself. Which is a shame as the animation is top notch on the OVA episodes. (1-6 on DVDs 1, 2 and 3) This is thanks to the input of Ikuko Ito (Sailor Moon , R, S and SuperS) This is the work she made instead of staying to work on Sailor Moon Stars. The colours are bold and cheerful and the animation is smooth and fun.
The series itself comes in two parts; The OVA episodes and the TV episodes. The OVA is far better visually and by means of storyline, but both are funny and follow the exploits of humourous and loveable characters.
This is a series that should be more popular but isn't. Something I attribute to the 'more mature' content and the sub-standard english language version. Luckily the japanese dialogue version with english subtitles is selectable.
Anyone who enjoys the likeable aspects of Sailor Moon and the adult humour of Uncut episodes of Tenchi Muyo! will love this series. (and the subbed version features the voice talent of Masaya Onosaka who has played Jadeite in Sailor Moon and Vash The Stampede from Trigun)",1042329600,14,1141,4.543689320388349
1397732,5,B000056KN0,"Magic Users Club gives off the feeling that its going to be a cheap anime, with some good laughs. Actually, the animation is great, and it's insanely funny. It's always a bit weird, but they manage to pull everything together to make it great. This is the best new anime out there and a MUST SEE! Everyone I know that has watched it LOVES it, and it's growing in popularity!",1028505600,6,374,4.357142857142857
1397733,5,B000056KN0,"This series took me a while to get into. It's sort of confusing if you don't pay attention to every single episode.
One day, a giant bell comes out of the sky and takes over the world. But people quickly learned that if they did nothing, the bell would leave them along. so now a few years later, everyone is used to it. Takakura, president of the magic users club (a deerly under-rated club which has to borrow space from the manga club) likes to impress the female members, and accidentally promises to destroy the bell himself.
Usually eveyone just ignores Takakura's boasts, but this time Sae (a new female member) get's jazzed up and convinces them to go and tackle the bell, ewven though they can't even fly their brooms yet.
Alot has to happen in the first episode, so the characters start out rather flat and simple. But as the show progresses they become much more 3-dimensional. The english dub is also fairly decent. Something rare these days. Lisa Ortez gives a fine performance as always, and Jammie McGoginal does a bang up job as Takakura (the perverted club president).
As for the Dvd, it's very well put together and has some good features such as creditless openings and artwork. Also, from disk 2 through the end, each dvd has an outtake reel with the english dub actors. A rare and hilarious feature that more anime should have. They even have a ""slates"" reel which are the original japanese text scenes (they put text over some so you can understand what's going on, so they included the original scenes as a bonus).
if you're looking for mindless entertainment, this is it. If you like perverted jokes, this is it. If you like a fun story, this is it. If you like serious stories with blood and guts, look someplace else.",1028246400,9,1743,4.589743589743589
1397734,2,B000056KN0,"The thing I do like about this series is the humor is kinda charming. Wow... I wonder if most teenage boys really think like that. Somehow I feel a bit sorry for Takakura,...but anyway...
I just can't understand it:  what's with the aliens?! It seems that every other anime series has to have megalomaniac evil aliens trying to take over the world, and only a group of cutesy Japanese teenagers can save us! Needless to say, this series has abundant cliches.
Also, I thought Sae's teddy bear was creepy, and I didn't understand the part where all these teddy bears dance in the forest. It was supposed to be cute, but it just confused me and creeped me out. And the end credit part was just bizarre... and usually I thrive on the bizarre!

1397735,4,B000056KN0,"Magic User's Club is a silly, goofy story which works well, but suffers from too many cliches.  The premise is simple: Takakura heads the struggling high school magic user's club; in a foolish effort to impress the three new female members, he decides to use magic to defeat an invicible alien invader.  Takakura's constant fantasies about the girls, even in the midst of fighting aliens, is the core of the show's humor--along with his embarrassment at the constant advances of the club's male vice-president, Aburatsubo.  The main female character is Sae, the typical earnest, pure-hearted klutz.  These characters are simply too familiar, straight from the anime cookie cutter.
Fortunately, the characters do exhibit some growth, and the execution of the show rises above the generic elements.  The show's humor constantly skirts a good taste boundary, particularly when Takakura's thoughts run away with him, but it never crosses the line.  I would suggest a higher age rating than the 13+ indicated on the disc, given the sheer volume of imagined undressing and staring (but note, there's no actual nudity on this disc).
One peculiarity with these discs: this series spans 7 discs, but it's actually two shows.  The first three discs each contain 2 half-hour episodes--this is the original Magic User's Club direct-to-video series.  The last four discs contain 4 or 3 episodes each (of about 23 minutes) of a followup TV series.  There isn't a whole lot of show packed onto this first disc, but I still recommend it if you're looking for goofy, undemanding humor.",1021248000,3,1568,5.09375
1397736,1,B000056KN0,"Lots of people like this series, but I can't personally call it better than ""mildly amusing."" In fact, it's generally so ""fan service"" and insipid humor based that it's barely even watchable. If you like ""Those Who Hunt Elves"" you'll probably like this. If not, don't plan on being able to stomach this more than once at best. Buyer beware.",1012262400,4,340,4.683333333333334
1397737,5,B000056KN0,"This series is great!  It is most certainly the number one most funniest series I have ever seen!  You'll laugh!  You'll cry!  You'll laugh some more!  I'd give it infinite stars if I could!  The only thing I don't like about it is it's too short: only a total of 6 episodes were made!  But I guess that in a way that's good because then you don't have to spend way too much money to see the whole series, like you would with some other anime.  Anyway, you should definitely get this DVD, along with the others.  I can't recomend it highly enough!  It's great!  It's funny as hell!  If you don't get this DVD, believe me, you are only hurting yourself!  Believe me, you have NEVER seen anything so wildly outrageously halarious!

1397739,5,B000056KN0,"If you look past the perversion as just FUN FUN FUN, then the series is for you!
This is one of my favorite OAVs series (Oh! My Goddess being another)!  This tells the story of a Magic Users Club at a high school.  Now this club only has.. 5 people (including the president), not to mention that one of them rarely comes.  In this day and age, there is an alien object that came from space which people call the 'bell.' The world couldn't destroy it at all and then they just let it be because they thought the bell was harmless.  They had all these things come out to join society (which just look like big round balls).  They appeared normal, I mean, they even stopped at crosswalks with the other pedestrians!
Well, the Magic Users Club is headed by a big pervert who just wanted to look cool to the other underclassmen (who are all girls).  He said that he was going to take out that bell and our naive main character, Sae, always believed him.  So they all actually went to try to go after the bell but difficulties arrived.  Anyway, I don't want to spoil anymore, just wanted to give you some background info.  This is a really fun, great anime.  It's simply magical and I think anyone would like it.
The OAVs have 6 episodes in all with a TV series to continue it which Media Blasters will release after the OAV.",982886400,15,1319,4.303643724696356

Aliens from outer space have come to Earth. The U.N. was defeated effortlessly. Fortunately, the robotic aliens only live on Earth and observe human society. The members of the Kitanohashi High School Magic Users Club have taken it upon themselves to drive the aliens away.

TV Series Synopsis
After defeating the aliens, The Bell was transformed into a giant cherry tree. The Magic Users Club has decided to relocate the tree, and free Tokyo from the insane constantly growing piles of flower petals. Afterwards, the Club is being stalked by a stranger with mysterious intentions.

This anime is kind of odd. The story is very thin. It's driven by comedy, which is usually about boobs. It's an older series, so the animation leaves a lot to be desired. The animation actually improves a little in the TV series compared to the OVA. The voice acting is pretty mediocre as well. The story that seems to move very slowly, picks up and gains more depth about halfway through. I found myself liking it more and more as it moved along.

I was expecting more b/c of all of the 5 star reviews. There is no way this series deserves 5 stars. Not a single aspect of Magic User's Club was extraordinary. At the same time, nothing about this show was bad. It is pretty average overall. But b/c I laughed a lot, I'll give it 4 stars. The most appealing aspect of this show are the characters. The 5 main characters are all pretty cool and lots of fun. I think that they saved it from mediocrity.

It's not a very expensive purchase, so if you're interested check it out. I think it's hit or miss though. If you're looking for a good magic anime, Puella Magi Madoka Magika is great, but very serious. I think that at the time it came out, Magic Users Club may have been a bit more appealing. Now it's buried under dozens of other titles that shine so much brighter.",1359158400,,1864,4.5222551928783385
7932111,5,B000056KN0,"This series is broken down into two parts a six episode OVA and a 13 episode TV series.  The six episode OVA is amazing telling a story that is pretty epic.  The story is about an alien invasion that cannot be stopped by human technology however Takeo,the president of the Magic Users Club at a local high school near where the alien mothership is stationed, has vowed that the club would use magic to defeat the alien invasion.  The characters are for the most part are very charming, the story is very engrossing and the depiction of magic vs technology is very well done.  The only real problem i have with the series is that it is not for children due to several perverse jokes throughout the series; Takeo is constantly fantasizing about the women in the club, Aburatsubo(the other guy in the club) is constantly making passes at Takeo to the point of being criminal, and I'm not real sure what the deal is with Akane, she's constantly seen with guys that look to be in their 20's even though she's a freshman(making her about 16) and she's always with a different guy which makes her look like a bit of a whore.

The 13 episode TV series picks up where the OVA left off and is about the characters in the aftermath of the confrontation with the alien invaders.  There isn't as much of a story in these episodes but it's pretty good for character development.

Over all i would say this series is a must have for any anime fan and should be purchased while it can still be found",1344902400,,1483,4.410256410256411
7932112,4,B000056KN0,"Magic User's Club, or Mahou Tsukai Tai! (`I Wanna Use Magic!'), as it's known in Japan, follows a group of high school students who are a part of the Magic Club, a school club in which the members learn to cast spells and ride broomsticks. The club is led by Takeo Takakura, a quirky nerd who is constantly attempting to fend off his frequent perverted fantasies, as well as the unwanted affections of Ayanojyo Aburatsubo, the club's effeminate vice president. The show focuses on Sae Sawanoguchi, a clumsy and comparatively unskilled but well-meaning member of the club. She is joined by her best friend, the frank Nanaka Nakatomi, and the flighty Akane Aikawa, her underclassman. This box set includes both the complete OVA series as well as the TV series, a continuation of the OVAs.

Magic User's Club seems silly and shallow at first, but blossoms into a touching, engaging anime as it progresses. Although humor is very often pushed to the show's forefront (the jokes predominantly involving Takeo and his colorful fantasies involving the female members of the club), Magic User's Club actually has quite a bit of heart, and things get significantly juicier and more dramatic as the OVA and TV series close in on their finales. Sae is extremely clumsy, but her personality and character development are presented in a more endearing, relatable way than most typical anime klutzes; as the series progresses, she grows into an extremely powerful magician, and becomes increasingly more confident.

The OVA series features the club members deciding to take on The Bell, a mysterious alien spaceship that has remained parked in the skies of Tokyo for years but is seemingly unstoppable due to its ability to incinerate any inanimate objects (including all forms of aircraft or weaponry). In the TV series, the members of the Magic Club are tormented by the increasingly ominous Jurika Jinno, a mysterious new student who joins the Magic Club and begins toying with its' members emotions, confronting them about their respective unrequited loves and other confused, selfish desires.

One major asset the anime boasts is its gorgeous, emotive animation-Ikuko Itoh, the chief animator of this series as well as two seasons of Sailor Moon and Princess Tutu, positively brings the characters and scenery to life. It's truly some of the most detailed, expressive hand-drawn animation I've ever seen, particularly in the OVA. MUC also has a great soundtrack, with songs and scores befitting of their accompanying settings and themes.

The 6-episode OVA series is great as it develops and does a solid job of introducing the characters, but the real character development begins in the TV series. MUC is surprisingly diligent about developing each of its characters, and there are few other anime that follow the daily lives of teenagers, displaying their fears, desires, insecurities and aspirations in such a beautifully honest manner.

The more emotional aspects of the show are occasionally overwhelmed by the risqu&eacute; gags and silliness, but when the humor works it works well-one of the most consistently funny running gags in the show involves the camera slowly panning in on a room as two or more club members make a series of statements and noises that allude to something sexual, but ends up being something completely innocent; also, some of Takeo's fantasies are genuinely hilarious. There's no full nudity or anything extremely explicit, so things are kept to a PG-13 standard. Magic User's Club is something of an acquired taste and a bit of a grower, but once its appeal sinks in, you're guaranteed to be wanting more of this exquisitely entertaining, charming anime.",1285891200,,3681,5.107973421926911
7932113,3,B000056KN0,"This was on my wish list because other reviews made it sound so good.  It was recommended because I liked Love Hina and Kiki's Delivery Service.  Unfortunately, Magic User's Club just barely doesn't make the grade.
It looks like the creators wanted to make a space epic, then decided to turn it into a romantic comedy, and finally had to settle with a wacky fanservice comedy.  The first episode suffers a few changes of tone before one of the main characters is defined enough to understand him.
I'm watching it with my two daughters, currently aged 6 and 9.  They don't understand the more mature moments, but if that sort of thing offends you you'll definitely want to avoid this show, especially with its homosexual overtones.
There's just enough plot and character development to keep me watching until the end.  It's generally cute, despite the whiny nature of its female lead.  There are better things to watch with your kids.
Especially with only two episodes on each of the first three disks, these DVDs will go on my ""trade"" shelf.",1084060800,5,1041,4.7555555555555555
