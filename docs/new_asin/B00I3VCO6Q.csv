8638921,1,B00I3VCO6Q,Every disc in the series I received is defective. Real bad audio and visual defects. I won't take a chance on buying anymore dvd's from Amazon.,1495324800,,143,4.538461538461538
8638922,5,B00I3VCO6Q,It works for  me.,1456617600,,17,3.25
8638923,4,B00I3VCO6Q,"Enjoyable, if shallow, viewing.  Always good to watch an episode or two when nothing else is going on.  Annoying characters usually disappear in a couple of episodes so it's worth it to keep watching.",1443916800,,200,4.852941176470588
8638924,5,B00I3VCO6Q,"Great series, fun to watch over again!",1441152000,,38,4.571428571428571
8638925,1,B00I3VCO6Q,One disc in each season would not play. Very frustrating. Returned the whole collection .,1416528000,,89,5.0
8638926,5,B00I3VCO6Q,"I am from Miami where most of the series was shot. I loved the show and the casting was perfect. Story lines were good as well but there were a lot of ""Miracles"" performed by Mike. Hot wiring cars in 30 seconds, an unlimited supply of perfect cell phones plus hacking into ANY computer is seconds. Still very entertaining.",1416096000,,322,4.47457627118644
8638927,5,B00I3VCO6Q,Great show! Burn Notice is GREAT!,1403568000,,33,4.666666666666667
8638928,5,B00I3VCO6Q,"A well written/well acted series set in Miami FLA...what more could you ask?  Glad I have the series to watch whenever I get to missing Michael & Fe too much.  Didn't much care for the ending...too mushy for my taste, but I suppose they needed to end up safe & sound if not more than a tad boring...",1402185600,,299,4.137931034482759
8638929,5,B00I3VCO6Q,I love the series and was so excited to receive it so quick and the price was extremely affordable too.  I began watching it as soon as it arrived.,1401494400,,147,4.068965517241379
