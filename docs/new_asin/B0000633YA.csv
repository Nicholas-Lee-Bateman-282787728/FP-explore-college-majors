7958482,4,B0000633YA,"Yes it's true. Alex- You know, Jen's fiance who we thought died in the first episode is back. And he's not a happy camper. In fact he's pretty darn angry cuz he thinks the Time Force Rangers have changed the future. Not a good thing in the Time Force code book. He's come back to see that time doesn't change, but in doing so he could end up ruining his relationship with Jen for all time. ""Dawn Of Destiny"" is a dawn of destiny for both Alex and his 2001 counterpart Wes. This video is pretty epic in what it is trying to achieve. It seems that we could have seen more emotion from Jen in seeing Alex again, but due to the imminent danger in the story this doesn't happen, and with good cause. Frax has something a lot more powerful than the Power Rangers' zords. So sit back, relax and tune into the action on screen. This video isn't the best Power Rangers has to offer since it mainly focuses on the typical upcoming zord battle. If only it focused more on the tension between Jen and Alex. Still, I bought it, and I definitely don't regret doing so. Check it out and make up your own mind.",1029369600,2,1094,4.214285714285714
