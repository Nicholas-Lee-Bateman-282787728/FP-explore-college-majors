2288591,5,B0009F43FY,"Mary D. Ca.  Finally season two of ""Once and Again.""It constantly amazes me how the best material for television is taken off the air way too soon while complete drivle is left on year after year. I'm glad to see that Once and Again is being put on DVD even though they should have kept it on TV for more than three seasons. It's some of the best writing and acting ever to grace a television series. Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz who are both talented directors created this series together. They also were respondsible for THIRTY-SOMETHING which I am still waiting and hoping will be put on DVD. I am one of many people that thinks the airwaves leave much to be desired. This show is a richly acted and constructed drama about real people and their lives of triumph and struggle. I hope anyone that reads this will give Once and Again a chance, It is truly art imitating life at it's best. I also hope they release season three and release all four seasons of Thirty-Something. I have watched television for forty plus years, always looking for anything of real quality. Once and Again and Thirty-Something are two of the finest TV dramas ever. I hope if your into great quality that you view these treasures.",1114992000,8,1218,4.561643835616438
2288592,5,B0009F43FY,"I bought the first season of ""Once And Again"" on DVD the day it was in released.  When I first heard that Buena Vista was NOT going to release Seasons 2 or 3 of OAA, I was upset.  Season 2 was my favorite season.  The episode ""Booklovers"" is one of the best hour long episodes I have ever seen.  It is a mini-movie, self contained and worth the price of the entire box set.  Even if you have never watched an episode of OAA, you will enjoy ""Booklovers."" The Emmy VHS screener of that episode used to go for near $50 on ebay. -I know, I got outbid once :(  I've pre-ordered Season 2 and look forward to reading that Season 3 will be released as well.",1114732800,16,649,4.070866141732283

2288594,5,B0009F43FY,I did not know much about Once and Again until I decided to rent them through Netflix - after watching the first disc I was hooked and went to bought Season 1. I am not a big fan of tear jerkers - but man this show touch me deep inside!! I have been waiting for Season 2 to come out - and found out that it will be out in August!! YAY!! This is awesome. Please Buena Vista - come up with Season 3 so that I can complete the series!! What a WONDERFUL news!!!,1114560000,6,457,3.8210526315789473

2288597,5,B0009F43FY,"ONCE AND AGAIN was one of the best written shows on TV in recent years, but thanks to the brilliance of ABC, it got moved several times during its all-too-short three seasons, and the final season was further trashed by being shortened, rather than letting the creators spin the various plot threads out to some sort of logical conclusion. Now we hear that Season 2 is about to be released in August, along with a rerelease of Season 1, and that is sensational news. For the many viewers who never got to see this remarkable series, now is your chance to catch up and revel in some amazing writing and some deeply-felt performances by a sterling ensemble cast, led by Sela Ward (an Emmy winner for this) and Billy Campbell (who should have been). In this ever-burgeoning market for TV on DVD, let's hope that Buena Vista gets behind this show and markets it correctly, and that the truncated but still terrific Season 3 follows closely on its heels.",1113782400,11,949,4.621301775147929
2288598,5,B0009F43FY,"I'm extremely happy to hear this season is FINALLY being released. Although, I'm skeptical about it actually being available in stores like the first season. It was too hard to find! No wonder it didn't sell very well. Let's hope this really does get released and finally answers many prayers of fans of this wonderfully real show. *ahem, there's still one more season Buena Vista!

I have purchased the whole series of thirty something but would like it if Once and Again have the whole series available as a package like Dr Quinn. When will this be released.

Looking forward to an update.",1286323200,,420,4.739726027397261
2288606,5,B0009F43FY,"I say yes.  No number of great reviews can do this great show justice.  In a land where most of TV is either a competition or a procedural, this show is one of the most genuine, most beautiful pieces of episodic story telling I have ever seen.  So heartfelt and beautiful, you can just tell that the people who made this show weren't necessarily in it for the money.  There are no gimmicks, no sensationalist story lines, no plot or celebrity casting stunts, just honest, profound and very entertaining family drama.  The acting is beyond incredible.  The cast is nice to look at, yes  but they can all act and are so convincing in their roles.  Sela Ward and Billy Campbell have more chemistry on this show than I have seen between two actors in a long time.  The kids are all amazing and play the size of their chatracters just right without a hint of haminess or precious young actor schtick. Marin Hinkle as Lilly's (Sela ward) sister and Suzanna Thompson as Rick's (Billy Campell) ex-wife are both a revelation. And if you like Grey's Anatomy, then watch Patrick Dempsey get to do some real acting on his three guest appearances on O&A.

Not many shows know how to manage their many characters like this show did.  Not everyone is in every episode and yet at the end of all three seasons, you felt like you got to know each and every one of them very very well.  This show is both generous and concise.  It never misses a beat yet keeps the perfect pace so that nothing feels like padding.  I don't think anything will ever come out on TV that will be quite as special and exceptionally well executed all through out like Once and Again",1281571200,2,1641,4.444816053511706
2288607,4,B0009F43FY,It was nice to finally find the second season of this show. It went off the air way too soon! Nice to find a new copy of the dvd's!,1267660800,,131,3.5517241379310347
2288608,5,B0009F43FY,I love this series. Great Story and Acting! But where is the FINAL Season? It has been years since the Second Season. I want my closure!!!!!!!,1254355200,2,142,4.5
2288609,5,B0009F43FY,"The biggest difference between Season One and Two of ONCE AND AGAIN is that while Season One continually came back to Rick and Lily's romance as the anchor of the show, Season Two shifted the action to the characters as a whole.  If Season One was all about Billy Campbell and Sela Ward, along with their extensive supporting cast, Season Two saw the cast transform into a true ensemble.  Instead of Rick and Lily's story overshadowing all others, there are multiple fascinating storylines.  This would change even more in Season Three when their story would frequently not even be the primary one.

What I like about ONCE AND AGAIN is that it is a family drama that isn't, like the endless teen-oriented dramas on the WB and the CW.  You get shows like GOSSIP GIRL where the adults are thrown in almost as afterthoughts, or other shows where the adults behave in ways that are almost like you imagine teens think adults behave.  But ONCE AND AGAIN at no point, even in the arcs focusing on kids, feels like a teen drama.  The show also displays a rare intelligence in its writing.  The show does not often resort to clich&eacute; or hackneyed story, and often had some nicely fresh arcs.

The only thing I really dislike about this series are the black and white ""asides,"" where character are interviewed away from the central action.  Sometimes these have a documentary feel.  Sometimes they have feel oddly disembodied, as if we have entered an astral plane of sorts.  Sometimes it feels like they are talking to a psychiatrist.  I just detest these digressions.  MY friend who is a huge ONCE AND AGAIN fan doesn't dislike them as much as I do, but agrees that they are exceedingly odd.

It is absurd that these DVDs are out of print.  I have only been able to see this thanks to one of my closest friends who not only has Seasons One and Two on DVD but who has recorded Season Three.  If not for her, I would not have been able to see the entire series.  She has for years been checking over and again whether ONCE AND AGAIN will ever see Season Three out on DVD.  Frankly, I would like to own my own copies of all three seasons.  So now I'm hoping for the whole thing to be issued/reissued on DVD.  It is a shame that this fine show was cancelled prematurely.  Now it is a shame that it isn't available at all.  Except through the kindness of friends.",1244332800,,2356,4.466042154566745
2288610,5,B0009F43FY,"How rare to have a complex network drama that doesn't rely on shocking revelations nor overly sweet  sentimentality.  This show managed to sow the everyday lives of families that struggle with real life issues.  The effect divorce has on children, the pressures of financial worries, the conflicts between personalities.  Even though many of the characters in the 2nd season had to deal with difficult and darker issues, it still remained realistic.  I miss the show and haven't found anything equivalent since.",1229212800,,511,5.2592592592592595

2288612,5,B0009F43FY,"After buying and watching the first season, I HAD to get the 2nd season and I loved it.  In my opinion, most shows have their strongest showing in the 2nd season.  Characters and actors have found their footing and the writing have gained its confidence.  There usually isn't enough time to create too many loose ends in the first season.  It allows the 2nd season to be brave and to become the backbone.",1199577600,,404,4.493150684931507

I just read that Buena Vista Home Entertainment's license is going to expire soon, and ABC is looking for a new distributor to pick up the show for DVD distribution.  But it's up to the fans to let ABC and any potential distributors know that the fans are waiting and are excited at the prospect of finally (!!) getting Season 3.

2288616,5,B0009F43FY,"It's hard to believe that ""Once and Again"" ever graced our television screens with programming now at an all-time low.  It was truly brilliant televison.  Never given the audience or the critical respect it deserved, watching episodes of ""Once and Again"" all over again, I was reminded about how intricate the writing was, the strength of the nuanced life-like performances of all cast members and most especially the most believable pre-teen and teenage characters in televsion drama history.  I am still stunned that this program never racked up Emmy Awards even for Outstanding Drama Series.(Sela Ward was honored in the first season as Outstanding Lead Actress, however)  If you have never seen it, watch it.  You will laugh, and find the journeys these characters take very real and poignant.  I still find the episodes from Season two the best..most especially a gut-wrenching performance by (""Grey's Anatomy"") Patrick Dempsey as Lily's schizophrenic brother Aaron.  Nothing since the finely written drama series of the early 80's (""Hill Street"", ""St. Elsewhere"", ""Cagney & Lacey"")has moved me more.",1167523200,7,1105,5.316091954022989
2288617,5,B0009F43FY,"When I read the reviews for the pilot episode, I was thinking this is to good to be true.  But I was immediately blown away after watching the first 3 episodes and was captivated by it.

For sometime now, I have been searching around for the 3rd season of ONCE & AGAIN.  As many of the fans of the series state, this was and still is an incredible show with great actors, directors, and writing.  Why the Network canceled such a great show is beyond my comprehension.  Could it be that the series was bounced around from night to night that eventually contributed to its demise?  I think it was.  But then again, networks have show developers that come up with ideas such as these ridiculous reality based [...], and yet they think of this as quality entertaining television?

This series was a breath of fresh air in the midst of a time period where every network was creating and producing ""Reality Series [...]""!

PLEASE RELEASE SEASON 3!",1164585600,12,941,4.553571428571429
2288618,5,B0009F43FY,"Watching ""Once and Again"" is one of the most painful television shows to watch, let along watch again.  This is not because it is a bad television show, but because when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of divorce it is the most painfully realistic television show that has aired to date.  I would like to be able to identify with Rick, but my personal situation is more like that of Jake, and instead of focusing on the romantic relationships between the adults I keep paying more attention to the pain of the children when they talk about what divorce has done to them.  Watching ""Once and Again: The Complete Second Season"" on DVD, the character I found myself paying attention to more than the first time around when the series aired on ABC was that of Zoe Manning.  There is a moment when she reads her parents, Lily and Jake, the riot act regarding being the youngest and not only getting hand me downs from her older sister Grace, but also ending up with less years where the family (""Scribbling Rivalry"").  Anybody who has been in a family that has gone through a divorce will find this show hits home time and time again.  If you have been spared that particular experience, then I really do not know why you would want what these people go through.

If the first season of ""Once and Again"" is about Lily Manning and Rick Sammler falling in love, then the second season is about how that relationship has a ripple effect with their family as the inevitability of the relationship forces their children and ex-spouses to a new level of acceptance.  There is actually more abut Lily and her new job (e.g., ""Scribbling Rivalry"") and Rick working on a mega-project for Miles Drentell (""Edifice Wrecked""), than there is about them being with each other.  While Lily and Rick are happy, for the most part, everybody else is wallowing in misery to varying degrees, and throughout the season getting all the kids together and on the same page proves to be problematic again and again (e.g, ""Feast or Famine"").  The major irony is that the dyad I am most interested in is Karen and Jessie, especially knowing what is going to happen to Karen in the third season and what Evan Rachel Wood has done since this show ended (although I am equally impressed by Julie Whalen as a young actress as well).  So I tend to pay attention to what each of those characters are doing, albeit for different reasons, but with more of an appreciation of how Jessie is her mother's daughter, which is not always a good thing (""Best of Enemies""), especially since Jessie is having trouble adjusting to high school and stops eating (""Food for Thought"").

Having Miles Drentel is a mixed blessing, because while watching David Clennon is always a pleasure, when he becomes a wedge between Rick and David it is like watching Michael and Elliot on ""thirtysomething"" all over again.  But it does inspire a true moment of vision for Rick (""Ozymandias 2.0""), and by the end of the season it becomes clear that the purpose of having Miles around is to bring Rick down to the point that all he can offer Lily is himself at the end because his professional reputation and business are pretty much shot.  This becomes important because it means Rick and Lily do not have the money to find a house where their merged families can have enough space to breathe, let alone live.  But dramatically the whole bit of Karen and her law firm trying to stop Miles, and Rick, from building their project is more interesting (""Edifice Wrecked""), especially when it seems Rick might end up going to prison (""Won't Someone Please Help George Bailey Tonight"").  When the psychiatrist that Jessie is seeing points out that only married people get as angry as Rick and Karen get at each other, it seems so obvious.

This really is a year of one step forward and one step backwards for most of the characters.  Jake is the big hero when an emotionally disturbed bus boy shows up at the restaurant with a gun (""The Other End of the Telescope""), but bails on Tiffany when she wants him to be a father to their baby (""Forgive Us Out Trespasses"").  Judy comes up with the great idea of ""Booklovers,"" despite Lily's negativity, but needs the entire rest of the season to figure out Will Gluck.  Eli has found something he likes and is good at with his music (""I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down""), but is unable to build on it as his problems with school and romance continue.  Note: why Rick and Karen wasted time letting Eli apply to the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana is beyond me, because I have taught there and my oldest daughter is graduating from there this December.  I have to tell you that unless Eli is going on a basketball scholarship, he is not getting it to that school and thinking he had a chance was a totally unrealistic expectation.  So, my question is whether the people who put the show together know this was a big mistake and it is an insight into Eli's parents, or simply me once again reading way too much into the situation.

My only real complaint is that this time around it becomes clearer to me that Lily is really way too judgmental.  At least when she does not immediately accept Rick's proposal (another painfully true moment for me), she does not leave him hanging for long and I liked the way he found out she had accepted his ring.  The fact that season two ends with the wedding (""The Second Time Around"") might seem like the end of the story, but only if you make the mistake of thinking ""Once and Again"" was simply about Lily getting remarried.  It really is about trying to make two families one, which is why fans are sitting around waiting for the third and unfairly final (and incomplete) season to come out on DVD.",1154649600,17,5722,4.5625

Wood went on to star in the incredible film, Thirteen, I just knew her career would take off after this show ended third season. In the second season of Once and Again, her charater Jessie struggles with anorexia, her scenes are so touching and raw, what a gifted young actress, she was the main reason I tuned in every week, just remarkable. Sela Ward is good in everything she is in. My fave episode is the Thanksgiving episode. Patrick Dempsey guest starred as Ward's mentally challenged brother from time to time.

2288625,4,B0009F43FY,"I was a huge fan of Once & Again's brand of adult melodrama, but it's worth noting that season 2 was the weak link in its illustrious three years.  I was never nuts about the Atlantor/ Miles Drentel plotline that dominated Rick's (Billy Campbell) year - his ambition was interesting enough, his crises of conscience and ""darker side"" weren't as much.  Campbell does a rousing do-gooder, but in truth, he was always Once's least interesting character, and made a better as a supportive rod in the background than lead.  I was also not nuts about Lily's stint as trailblazing editor's assistant - not because Sela Ward's plotlines were insubstantial (for proof, take one view of her rabblerousing sexual harrassment episode ""Suspicion"" - which likely netted her deserved Emmy for the year), but because Jennifer Crystal Foley's artist/brat-in-a-power-suit-and-pigtails Christie was always more annoying than welcome.  But if some of the bigger plot machinations didn't work, Once & Again moved hearts left and right with its smaller moments and extraordinary support cast.  Grace (the extraordinary, underappreciated Julia Whelan) stealing from Jessie in spite of herself (""Thieves Like Us""), Judy's love of Salinger and singles' nights (""Booklovers""), another terrific guest appearance by Patrick Dempsey (""Aaron's Getting Better""), and, especially, the emergence of Evan Rachael Wood as a major young actress - her heartbreaking work in ""Food For Thought"" steals the season.  Capping things off appropriately, the season ends in ""Second Time Around,"" a wedding episode that's square, earnest, and simply so moving, your deepest melodrama-loving dweeb is unleashed, laughing and crying in spite of itself.",1140134400,7,1704,5.484732824427481

2288627,1,B0009F43FY,"really, i can't say enough about how terrible this show is. i have a sad suspicion that the creator or ""my so called life"" had only one idea, and after that success just kept trying to recycle the same stuff. it doesn't work the second time around, because ""my so-called life"" would have been nothing without the amazing claire danes. all the high school drama she was involved in made the show spectacular; the adults were like empty shells. i assumed back then that they were supposed to be that way because from a high schooler's point of view, adults really are not people.

however, ""once and again"" is all about the adults and the kids are more peripheral. and still, the kids are the only halfway-likeable characters. the adults are simply insufferable. i keep hoping that maybe the writers were being ironic and intended for all the characters to be so insufferable, plastic, simple-minded... but really there's not a touch of irony anywhere to be found. these empty shells are our protagonists and we're supposed to somehow identify with them.

it is hard to look at most of them, all issues of writing and acting aside. ""rick"" has a teeny little mouth and a big stick up his ... and the names of everyone else escape me at this moment because they are so boring. the sister is somewhat cute and somewhat worth empathizing with.... but the fact that she wants what her sister has, or wishes she was her sister, is completely inconsistent with her character.

i also need to point out that the kids, grace and zoey, have the exact same hairstyles as the two daughters in ""my so-called life."" they are the same ages and have basically the same personalities as well. they even wear similar outfits!!!

this series is a bad testament to the very lowest common denominator. perhaps that's why it has such a huge following. i pity the poor suckers who think this is as good as tv can get.",1130544000,4,1892,4.605341246290801
2288628,5,B0009F43FY,This is a great story of two blended families. Sela Ward plays her character Lily perfectly. Sela is one of our greatest treasures. The supporting cast is just wonderful. This show was one of the high points of TV for me. No other show even comes close! I can't wait for season 3 to come out on DVD!,1129420800,3,299,4.172413793103448
2288629,5,B0009F43FY,"I am a huge fan of this series.  Just like the first season..the writing is outstanding in the second season.  The 'hostages in the restaurant' episode was a little over the top, but on the whole, a great season.  Where is Season 3??",1129248000,,233,4.372093023255814
2288630,3,B0009F43FY,"After a very long wait, I was excited to finally have the opportunity to get Season Two of ""Once and Again"". The show is fantastic.

However, I returned the DVD set because of glitches. Everytime that a camera angle changed, the screen would flash. Then, the video was in slow motion for about one-two seconds. This happened every time that the angle would change!! Very annoying and distracting. So, I returned it for a new set. Same problems with the new set. I guess it's a problem with all of the Season Two sets. Too bad. It definately detracts from a wonderful drama.",1127692800,,573,4.563106796116505
2288631,5,B0009F43FY,"I live in the UK and was never fortunate enough to see Season Two or Three. Indeed SKY DIGITAL, the UK's ""Premier"" provider of TV, chose to chop the original run of Season 1, with about 8 episodes to go. I had to purchase both Seasons from Amazon in the US of A.

I'm a young 37, never been married and have no children. That didn't stop me labeling this program one of the best I have ever viewed. Understand, I come from an appetite of 24, The X-Files and Ally Mcbeal, but one can not fault the superb acting from both leads, believable story lines and exceptional all round production.

So why did it not catch on? Simples answer, too intelligent and thought provoking for the vast majority of both the UK and American viewing audience. How many Seasons did Buffy run for 8, Angel how many, nonsense TV seems to rule the dictates of Network ideology. All too often will the TV Networks cancel a programme due to poor audience figures. They don't for one-minute think that the treatment of said programme plays a role in those figures.

Back to the series itself. Utterly brilliant thought provoking TV, superb acting and production.

It was destined to fail the moment it started.",1127520000,8,1183,4.539906103286385
2288632,5,B0009F43FY,"Once and Again is the only family drama that doesn't leave me feeling cheated and manipulated.  The writers aren't afraid to let scenes develop and get to the heart of what's really going on, instead of just hinting at it and slogging on to the next sell-out scene, as happens on most shows.  Better yet, the actors can sell it.  Everyone complains that TV is crap and not worth watching, but very few people are working on shows that defy the norms of bare-faced pandering and trite sentimentalism.  Here's a complete, twenty-two-episode season on DVD that defies those complaints.",1125792000,10,582,4.848484848484849
2288633,4,B0009F43FY,"How long do I have to wait for season 3 to come out?  This is a fantastic show with a very loyal fanbase and we will buy the third season the very second it comes out.  A few more extras and perhaps some behind-the-scenes, alternate scenes, and deleted scenes would be great as well.

Season 2 unlike season 1 brings the kids, particularly Julia Whelan and Evan Rachel Wood together, working out this strange new relationship that's being thrust upon them by their dating parents - future step-sisters.  I am simply amazed at the incredible talent these two girls, young women, display especially when you consider the emotional moutains and valleys they had to traverse.  I know some adults who who display only two emotions; mad and apathetic.  Whelan and Wood are well-matched as conflicted characters.

What's brilliant is that as Wood's character, Jessie, is thrust into her first year of high school (yeah, I noticed they aged her up two or three years from season 1) and thrust into a new relationship with the Mannings; Lily, Judy, Grace, and Zoe.  With each of the Mannings Wood makes us see perfectly which role she assigns them (all subtextually).  With Lily she sees the enemy because this is the woman who is the ""new"" mom, Judy is the cool aunt who relates to Jessie and her issues, Zoe is the younger sister who is just happy to have someone new to be with.  But it's with Grace that Jessie finds herself the most conflicted with.  As with high school she wants to feel like she ""fits in"" and she works this out via Grace's approval or disapproval.  When she finds anger with something the Manning's have done or something in her life is embarassing (therapy), it is through Grace she pits all her ire.  When she's happy she looks to Grace to confirm that it is something she should be happy with.

It is too bad this show was cancelled.  If it were kept on I am very sure that Julia Whelan and Evan Rachel Wood would have been nominated and won many awards for their excellent work on this series.

Please let season 3 come out on DVD soon.  I can't wait another 2 years.",1125446400,10,2087,4.522666666666667
2288634,5,B0009F43FY,"This series could be a little too cute at times, or could force matters a little too conveniently in the characters' interactions...but more often it was funny, even genuinely witty, and spot-on in its observation of how even with the best intentions and open-hearted affection people can willfully misunderstand and unwillingly hurt each other.  As the 40-SOMETHING follow-up to THIRTYSOMETHING, the 10-something MY SO-CALLED LIFE, and the 20-something RELATIVITY (and each previous series better than the last one, even if the first was the only other to survive its first season), the creator-producers and their team have hit a pinnacle here that will be hard to overtake with whatever their 50-SOMETHING show is likely to be (not that this series begins to slight the other characters aside from the once-divorced lovers at the center of it; like RELATIVITY before it, it pays rewarding attention to an ever-larger circle of people in and out of their lives).  This series was part of what might be the best period US broadcast television has ever seen or will ever see, and even with stiff competition was my favorite series...even the advent of GILMORE GIRLS and to a much lesser extent AMERICAN FAMILY didn't quite make up for our loss of it in 2001.

The packaging of the set I have, however, leaves much to be desired...the disc-trays are falling away from the cardboard backing already, and the folded carboard/trays only reluctantly fit back into the box.  I've noticed a few very minor skips on my set, with no obvious flaws on the discs, but will be checking them on other playback equipment.  One (1) commentary track and basically no other features seems excessively meager.",1125014400,2,1690,5.0

Once and Again is simply astounding.",1124928000,3,334,4.9818181818181815
2288636,5,B0009F43FY,"Amidst the backdrop of ugly, offensive, stupid noise that network television has taken up as its standard in recent years, Once and Again plays out with the brilliance and sophistication of a great jazz ensemble. If it is a normal function of abject mediocrity that produces the average situation comedy or tired, unremarkable drama, then what might result if the most gifted creative forces from the various disciplines of television writing, production, directing, and acting were to converge on a single project?  How good could TV be if the right people were involved from the outset and, maybe, got a little bit lucky on top of it?  Once and Again suggests an answer.

  This was an hour-long drama that lasted three seasons and aired on ABC from fall 1999 to spring 2002.  Its careful, measured pace follows a similar timespan in the lives of two Chicago-area families splintered by divorce.  Sela Ward stars as Elizabeth ""Lily"" Brooks Manning, who is separated from her husband Jake (Jeffrey Nordling) and now lives in the family house with their daughters, Grace (Julia Whelan) and Zoey (Meredith Deane).  Billy Campbell co-stars as Rick Sammler, an moderately successful architect with his own firm (more or less) and a three-year-old divorce from Karen (Susanna Thompson), mother of Eli (Shane West) and Jessie (Evan Rachel Wood).  The essential development of the series is that Rick and Lily meet, begin dating and somehow, over the course of two and a half years, manage to hammer out what they have into a hybridized, modern American family, a kind of Brady Bunch for the new millennium.  Spinning around them are numerous peripheral characters, among whom notables include Lily's perpetually single sister Judy Brooks (Marin Hinkle), Rick's long-time fried Sam Blue (Steven Weber), Jake's on-again off-again girlfriend Tiffany Porter(Ever Carradine), and Lily's mother Barbara (Bonnie Bartlett).

  To read a description such as the one above is to be supplied with most of the essential facts but to miss out on everything that's really worth knowing about the series.  For example, it's probably more useful to mention that, of the actors listed, each and every one delivers a stellar, pitch-perfect performance that humiliates most of the actors who usually snap up the Emmys.  No other television show I've seen has been populated with characters so solidly embodied by the actors who portrayed them, that at the end of a season, I felt as if I'd spent a year living with them instead of watching them on TV.  It's amazing to observe how vivid and multidimensional they are, as if they have mass, heat up the air around them, and will continue to go on living their lives every day, whether the cameras are rolling or not.  When you wake up in the morning and realize that you're worrying about Judy or Eli, you know it's not TV as usual.

  Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz may not have built a ratings giant that would go on for too many seasons and make them billionaires, but they did something that, in my estimation, is far more noteworthy; they created a polished, masterful production where the soundtrack, color palettes, and careful, patient camera work consistently generate a viable space for their characters to live and breathe, a space that doubles as a stage with a great view from the bleachers.  For example, much has been made of the black-and-white scenes, in just about every episode, which typically feature one character speaking frankly, at the camera, as if to an unseen psychotherapist.  These scenes work not despite the artistic pretention of the black and white, but because of it.  Executed with a suprising blend of restraint, humor, sensivity and wit, they give us these well-timed, cogent, honest glimpses at characters expressing -- at times struggling to express -- their private thoughts to another, one who sees and will judge but cannot act out.  Sometimes the lines separating these realms would break down, as in the episode ""Food for Thought,"" in which Zwick began a guest stint as Dr. Daniel Rosenfeld, a therapist counselling Jessie, first about her eating disorder then, later, about other things.  I like to imagine how Zwick must have felt, sitting in that chair, facing Jessie Sammler, talking with her, because after Season Two, you feel like you know Jessie and her world, and the people who inhabit it.",1123286400,44,4371,4.987603305785124

I waisted no time buying the first season and made numerous phone calls to ABC (I always got the answering machine) hoping to get a projected release date for Season Two.
