7903551,4,B000005ZV9,"The Superbook Bible videos were originally made in the early 80's, maybe even earlier.  I am in my 20's and grew up watching these videos as a little kid, and I absolutely loved them.  By today's standards they are cheesy, but they introduced me to the stories of the Bible and were at least entertaining.  I was intrigued by the fact that Christopher and Joy went back in time to personally experience the stories.  Gizmo was their loyal friend and companion, the neat part about him is that he was just a toy that Christopher had in his room who came to life with the aid of Superbook.

Superbook was good when I was little, but probably won't appeal much to today's kids who have much better quality productions to watch like Veggietales.

But for what it's worth, I still have my VHS copies of Superbook and I pop them in every now and then to relive the memories!",1116547200,,868,4.427672955974843
7903552,1,B000005ZV9,"This video is one of the worst videos we have seen yet.  The animation is poor at best, the story line about a little boy and girl who travel back in time to see Samson, a true strong man, goes awry right from the beginning when the boy lies about lifting weights.  We thought this was going to be a ""Christian"" video for children, but were stunned to see (within the first few minutes of the video), a robot who ""shoots"" some ""bad/mean"" Philistines for ""roughing up"" Samson's Mother.  Then, the show only got worse when Samson met Delilah and Delilah began to speak -- and sounded exactly like Mae West, ""Big Boy"" and all.  That Delilah portrayal was the last straw, we shut it off.  Truly disappointing. Poor quality, obviously not written or produced by Christians.",1039651200,,768,4.576642335766423
