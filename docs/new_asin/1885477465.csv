Attwood captures many of the key characteristics of Asperger's, with clear and easy to understand examples.  It is presented in a way not so much to pathologize but to help others understand this complicated disorder.  With a better understanding of the inner workings of an Asperger's child, it makes it much easier to work with and deal with them on a day to day basis, as well as giving ideas for how to help someone with this disorder function more effectively in the world.",1437264000,,641,4.646017699115045
