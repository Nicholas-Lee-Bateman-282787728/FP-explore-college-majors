267978,5,6300215857,While the bear special effect definitely needed help it's a pretty fantastic movie for the whole family.  Definitely one of those types of movies that you remember from your childhood and want desperately.  It was definitely worth purchasing and my kids love it.,1204502400,,262,5.069767441860465
267979,3,6300215857,"Generally enjoyable and solid Western.  Perhaps I would temper some of the high praise found in some posts below, especially bearing adult viewers in mind, but overall I liked it.

But the thought that kept running through my mind was that I would love to show it to a group of Cub Scouts, about Webelos' age (9-10).  I don't mean that as any kind of putdown (my son is an Eagle Scout), I just felt that they would be the ideal audience for the film.  Too much younger and it might scare them and cause nightmares; too much older and they'll start mocking the 'fakey bear'.  By the way, speaking of special effects, I think it is almost impossible to portray a menacing animal convincingly in a movie (especially before computer-generated capabilities).  Besides ""Jaws"", when has it ever been successfully done?

I did very much approve of the film's traditional values (another reason it would be great for Scouts to see).  And even if I wouldn't consider it a prime example of the dramatic craft in its highest form, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for fathers to watch with their young sons, especially those drawn to the great outdoors.",1189555200,2,1144,4.685
267980,5,6300215857,"This movie remains my all time favorite western classic. I work with teen boys, teaching and training them in the traits and habits needed th be successful men.  I use this film to help drive home my message. Clint Walker, as Big Jim Cole, epitimizes the essence of manhood. He exhibits honor, courage, compassion, integrity, strength, fidelity, respect, self reliance, love and mercy. As a family man he is the spiritual leader of his household.  His wife, Angie, respects and adores him. He is unabashed in his love for her. His children love and look up to him. As a man he has the strength of character and courage to face an assortment of deadly challenges bent on destroyng him and his family. He engages his enemies with determined resolve, steady nerves and manly strength.

His adversaries include, a huge grizzly (satan) who is bent on  devouring his live stock and his family, a wealthy and greedy land owner who wants his land; it was once his and he wants it back, and Cass Dowdy, a large, seething, menacing and steely-eyed man who has been nursing a deadly grudge against Cole; he wants him ruined, destroyed, humiliated or dead.

Jim Cole's deadly trials would almost ruin him financially (He could lose his ranch) and his marriage (How much can a wife take?). His best friend is killed by the grizzly and the wealthy land owner (keenan Wynn) does all he can to hasten Jim's departure from his land.

Alas, when Big Jim's wife can no longer bear the possibility that either satan or the evil Cass will do her husband in, she in desparation, fear and frustration, issues an ultimatum:  Either Jim quit his quest to kill the bear and quit the ranch or she will pack up the kids and leave him. This brief and rare confrontation with his wife is followed by what I think is the best quotation of manly resolve I have ever heard:

""Angie, there ain't a man alive that doesn't got trouble. How he handles that trouble is what counts. In every man's life there's a Cass or a Satan, one kind or another, trying to whip him, beat him down, destroy him.  He can't run away from it. He's got to stand strong and fight! What ever it is he's got to fight! That's how God made a man.""  Angie will soon apologize for her temporary loss of faith and stand staunchly by her man. Jim ultimately prevails against Cass, Satan and the greedy land owner and is able keep his ranch.

I think that our children, boys and girls, need to be exposed to films like this one. Jim Cole represents all the qualities of authentic manhood missing in our current society of effeminized and weak men. I am 55 years old and I watch this film at least 3 times a year and have been doing so sice this film came out in VHS. It is , for me, highly inspirational.  I am waiting for it to be reproduced on DVD. If you have children, particularly sons, this film is a must see, again and again and again.",1140566400,8,2877,4.438330170777989
267981,5,6300215857,"I grew up watching this movie with my dad.  On Friday nights he would ask what movie I wanted to watch and I would always say ""The Night of the Grizzly"".  There are a few scary scenes with the Grizzly but nothing to graphic.  It's a story of a hardworking family getting through the rough times.  A great movie for the entire family to enjoy.",1136678400,5,342,4.2153846153846155
267982,4,6300215857,"This atypical ""family Western"" tells a story that was probably more common on the frontier than every cinematic shootout ever filmed.  Former lawman Big Jim Cole (Clint Walker, best known as TV's ""Cheyenne"") inherits his grandfather's small ranch and brings his family to settle on it.  His first 24 hours in town aren't promising: he learns that the ranch was originally won from a powerful neighbor, Jed Curry (Keenan Wynn), who still covets it for his sons, Tad and Cal (Ron Ely, Sammy Jackson); he has to use almost all his savings to pay off a loan against it; 12-year-old son Charlie (Kevin Brodie) gets into a brawl with some local boys; five-year-old daughter Gypsy (Victoria Paige Meyerink) gets ""skunked""; longtime deputy and friend Sam Potts (Don Haggerty) gets cheated out of $10 by the young Currys and their buddy Duke Squires (Med Flory); and the ranch turns out to be a near-ruin.  But Jim is determined: this is good land, he says; with their purebred bull Duncan, he and his wife Angie (Martha Hyer) will raise ""some good cattle and maybe ten or twelve more kids.""  Then comes full spring and the awakening of the neighborhood nemesis, a huge grizzly bear known as Old Satan (""If that beast ain't Lucifer himself he's sure his first cousin,"" says banker Cotton Benson (Regis Toomey), an early friend of the Coles).  Satan's first visit to the Cole ranch results in a dead bull, the panicked flight of Sam's beloved mule Becky, and the injury of the family dog Solomon.  Jim and Sam go hunting and manage to hurt and intimidate the animal, but as fall arrives he returns and wreaks even more havoc, not only against them but at other places in the valley.  Now the cattlemen put a bounty on the bear, which draws hunter Cass Dowdy (Leo Gordon), formerly a deputy of Jim's, who bears him an old grudge and yearns to see him ""busted, flat broke, and beat.""
Much of the charm of the movie is in the picture of a close-knit family making a home for itself in a new land, and in the well-drawn, well-acted characters, including Hank (Jack Elam), the town loafer, Wilhelmina ""Bill"" Peterson (Nancy Kulp of ""The Beverly Hillbillies""), who keeps the general store, and Hazel Squires (Ellen Corby), Duke's tiny, feisty mother.  It's true that the ""bear"" in several of the close-ups is obviously a man in a bear suit, but there are also some impressive shots of a genuine grizzly, as well as some gorgeous trans-Divide Wyoming scenery and a generous helping of humor.  While there's little man-vs.-man shooting (I won't say none), three fistfights provide some action, and the steadily rising tension between Jim and Angie as the stress tests their marriage, the threat of losing the ranch, and the looming menace of Dowdy keep the suspense going.  This would be an excellent movie for ""family night"" viewing; it's been one of my favorites for over three decades.",1049155200,28,2870,4.7565392354124745
267983,5,6300215857,"Although 'Night of the Grizzly' was released by Paramount, it's easy to mistake it as a Disney film! Long on family values and gentle humor, this adventure yarn is the kind of 'live-action' feature that the studio specialized in throughout the fifties. If you don't think a film that kids can enjoy will be your 'cup of tea', you might be in for a surprise! This is a terrific movie!
Ex-Marshal Jim Cole (played with rugged charm by 'Cheyenne' Clint Walker) moves his family onto a small ranch, hoping to get away from the dangers of his previous line of work. His loving wife, Angela (popular '60s star Martha Hyer) is overjoyed by their new life, and the kids soon develop a bond with the beautiful countryside, and the small town nearby.
Not EVERYONE is happy about the arrangement, however; town bigshot Jed Curry (Keenan Wynn) wants Cole's land, and his sons are soon attempting to provoke Cole, in an unsuccessful attempt to force him to leave. When a montrous killer grizzly appears, and starts killing off Cole's livestock, Curry sees his opportunity; as the primary shareholder at the bank, he makes it nearly impossible for the rancher to get loans to replace stock.
The grizzly, nicknamed 'Satan', terrorizes the countryside, killing men, horses, and farm animals, and Cole methodically begins hunting it, in hopes of getting the $750 bounty that would 'save' his ranch!
The arrival of bounty hunter Cass Dowdy (played with cold-blooded menace by Leo Gordon, a veteran screen villain) further muddies the waters; Cole had once arrested him, and Dowdy spent two years in the 'pen', vowing revenge! Adored by the eldest Cole child, Charlie (Kevin Brodie), Dowdy announces he will kill the grizzly and accept the bounty, simply to ruin Cole! The pieces are now in place for a thrilling finale, as Cole, Charlie, and Dowdy confront the enraged beast, in a scene eerily similar to the climax of 'Jaws'!
The film offers a supporting cast of Hollywood 'pros', including Jack Elam ('Cannonball Run'), as bizzare but sweet Hank, who is 'adopted' by Cole's young daughter, Gypsy (the wonderful Victoria Paige Meyerink, in her second film); Nancy Kulp (TV's 'The Beverly Hillbillies') as the spinster owner of the local mercantile store; Ron Ely (TV's first 'Tarzan') and Sammy Jackson (TV's 'No Time for Sergeants') as Dowdy's sons; and Regis Toomey ('Burke's Law'), as the sympathetic banker.
This is a film to cherish, and enjoy, again and again! Gather the family...They'll thank you for it!",974160000,73,2495,4.957040572792363
267984,5,6300215857,"This is one of Clint Walker's best films. Walker portrays Big Jim Cole, a retired Sheriff who brings his family to a new life on a new ranch. But, a local killer Grizzly Bear has other plans when he continues to kill off  Jim's livestock. The hunt for the bear is exciting and there are a few good  laughs in it as well. Also good supporting performances by Jack Elam, Ellen  Corby(Grandma on the Waltons), Ron Ely(T.V.'s Tarzan) and Keenan Wynn. The  location where the movie was filmed, the San Bernardino National Forest, is  beautiful. A great family film.",930873600,24,560,4.616161616161616

Almost 40 years later, and after watching it again, I still like it very much. The main character, Clint Walker,  was in his prime at the time the movie was made. After doing all the Cheyenne TV westerns, Clint Walker was the perfect actor for the part of Big Jim Cole. With a supporting cast of Jack Elm, Leo Gordon, and Ron Ely, and breathtaking scenery of the Sierra Nevada mountains, this film is great for family viewing. I purchased to Blu-ray version and have been pleased with the picture quality of a 1966 motion picture. It does not have two-channel stereo sound. But that is the only drawback so far. I am glad Paramount Studios released it on DVD and Blu-ray in 2012. As far a classic westerns go, this is one of the better ones!",1435881600,2,842,4.29559748427673

Before watching again the other night, I figured it would be one of those movies that seemed good when you were a kid but wouldn't hold up to adult scrutiny...especially against modern movies with huge budgets. I was wrong...it was actually just as good if not better than when I was a kid. This really is just a good movie. It has everything....strong role models for everyone,  a cute kid, good guys, bad guys, a seriously scary monster and best of all...a showdown between titans Clint Walker and Leo Gordon.

I was a guard there, and the entire ""audience"" was mesmerized by this movie.  We never heard a peep out of anybody.  I later married and my wife and I and two kids saw it in the '70s at a drive-in.  It was just as great the second time, and we have watched it umpteen times since then on TV.  (It's on tonight.)  I'm ashamed to admit we had to read these reviews to learn the actors' names of Regis Toomey and Leo Gordon, because these two great men have been in gobs of movies forever, but seldom headliners.  This movie truly had an all-star cast.

Trouble almost from the get go starts when the local bully wants Cole property and is out to get it. Then Big Jim has to fight for his very life against Satan the Grizzly bear and Cass Codey  Jim's former deputy who killed innocent man and served prison time.

Watched it the same night I got it and it was just a good as I remembered it being. Love the interaction between little ""Rosebud""  and Jack Elam.

269431,5,6300215857,"""Night of the Grizzly"" is an outstanding and underrated Western from 1966. As ex-sheriff Jim Cole, Clint Walker embodies the substance of manhood, so rare in our current generation. He models bravery, honor, integrity, fidelity, strength, compassion, self-reliance, mercy, love and respect. He possesses the stamina and boldness to face an array of threats poised to wreck him and his loved ones, including a greedy neighbor who wants his ranch and a rogue grizzly dubbed ""Old Satan."" He says to his wife: ""Angie, there ain't a man alive that doesn't have trouble. How he handles that trouble is what counts. In every man's life there's a Cass or a Satan, one kind or another, trying to whip him, beat him down, destroy him. He can't run away from it. He's got to stand strong and fight! Whatever it is he's got to fight! That's how God made a man.

It took forever but -- thankfully -- this was finally released on DVD.

The film runs 102 minutes and was shot in the Big Bear region of San Bernardino National Forest, California.

As a child, I had loved this one too, even though the bear sorely lacked realism that today's technology could have supplied. This was a family movie about a family man having to make dangerous choices and decisions for his family. The multiple layers of conflict added to the story. The humor was delightful. The little girl who played Big Jim's (Walker's) daughter was delightful, whether chasing the ""pretty kitty"" or scrutinizing a caterpillar with Jack Elam, who showed his versatility as an actor here.

269620,5,6300215857,"This is a rare western that doesn't involve cowboys, Indians or the cavalry! Instead, Jim Cole (Clint Walker) has given up the life of a lawman to live the peaceful life of a rancher in Wyoming. Unfortunately, he must contend with a giant, rogue grizzly named ""Satan"" by the local people.

Clint Walker is one of those actors who ended up in supporting roles or in ""B"" movies. In this role as ""Big Jim"" Cole, Walker does a fine job portraying the peaceful man who is forced into a contest of strength and wits with a giant bear that not only devours his cattle, but takes the life of his longtime friend. The film itself revolves around Walker's character who left the life of danger and violence of a frontier lawman only to find danger and violence from another source - nature. It becomes a life-or-death contest between ""Big Jim"" and ""Satan"".

Martha Hyer is a steady performer in the role of the western, pioneer wife. The usual ""character actors"" make appearances in this film such as Jack Elam, Keenan Wynn, Nancy Culp and Ron Ely. The film location is suitably beautiful and rugged while the production itself is well acted and directed.

I did enjoy this film and felt it a fine showcase for Clint Walker's talent - something he rarely got to show to the fullest. I recommend this film with five stars.",1389052800,,1311,4.5702127659574465

At present, I don't have a VHS player so my fun is on hold.  Ah well, a lesson for me to check my orders more closely and a reason to get access to a VHS player.

He was soft spoken, but his words and tone were rock solid. He a protector of his family, and steadfast in his ideals. I thoroughly enjoyed the bonus interview of Clint Walker. I'm surprised he did not make more movies.

I highly recommend this movie as a ""family movie"". It protrays family values, it has a ""good guys - bad guys"" element set in a western theater. There is sorry in the loss of a family freind, comedy in the skunk sprayed daughter, fumbling sons of a wealthy tycoon, and a cattle owner. Buy it!!!",1357430400,,671,4.161538461538462

270091,4,6300215857,"I am a fan of Clint Walker and the Cheyenne TV series.  This movie is one of his best in the Western style.  I like to think of it as beyond Cheyenne.  If there was a continuation of the story of Cheyenne Bodie, this would probably be it.  Cheyenne married, a father, and trying to settle down into ranching life, but nature and his earlier life catching up with him.  The scenery is beautiful.  The casting is familiar, including Leo Gordon and Jack Elam.  And Clint Walker even gets to sing.  A well done, enjoyable movie.",1356739200,,524,4.385416666666667

270095,5,6300215857,"I just love this movie and I have always been a fan of Clint Walker.  He was a true movie star in the sense that he truly cared about the persona he reflected to others.  He believed in God, asked for his direction before each movie, strove to reflect a strong image of right over wrong and values and morals that you do not see in stars today.  The personal interview with Clint which was attached to this film, was amazing.  The movie is a terrific western with lots of action, laughter, and heart warming love of family and neighbor.  Definitely worth the money as you will want to watch it again and again!",1354233600,4,610,4.315789473684211

I looked for it at Amazon and not only found it, but was able to receive it in a few short days. What a great deal! This movie depicts the way pioneers and homesteaders lived, and the challenges they faced, whether from a skunk or a rogue bear. Clint Walker is perfect as the key character, with Jack Elam lending support.

This is presented in a wide screen format - not really, it is cropped to appear wide screen so you have missing content like mountain tops chopped off, and standing people chopped at the knee. This movie is based on the true story of Old Mose, a bear(s) who terrorized ranchers in the South Park region of Colorado. As other reviewers have commented, this is an excellent  movie.  In Night of the Grizzly we see people as beasts, beasts as people, and a co-mingling of interaction between the two only rarely seen on film.

270289,5,6300215857,"I cheered (softly, being in a library) when I saw that ""Grizzly"" has finally been made available on disc!  This atypical ""family Western"" tells a story that was probably more common on the frontier than every cinematic shootout ever filmed. Former lawman Big Jim Cole (Clint Walker, best known as TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cheyenne-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000EQ46H8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cheyenne - The Complete First Season</a>) inherits his grandfather's small ranch and brings his family to settle on it. His first 24 hours in town aren't promising: he learns that the ranch was originally won from a powerful neighbor, Jed Curry (Keenan Wynn), who still covets it for his sons, Tad and Cal (Ron Ely, Sammy Jackson); he has to use almost all his savings to pay off a loan against it; 12-year-old son Charlie (Kevin Brodie) gets into a brawl with some local boys; five-year-old daughter Gypsy (Victoria Paige Meyerink) gets ""skunked""; longtime deputy and friend Sam Potts (Don Haggerty) gets cheated out of $10 by the young Currys and their buddy Duke Squires (Med Flory); and the ranch turns out to be a near-ruin. But Jim is determined: this is good land, he says; with their purebred bull Duncan, he and his wife Angie (Martha Hyer) will raise ""some good cattle and maybe ten or twelve more kids."" Then comes full spring and the awakening of the neighborhood nemesis, a huge grizzly bear known as Old Satan (""If that beast ain't Lucifer himself he's sure his first cousin,"" says banker Cotton Benson (Regis Toomey), an early friend of the Coles). Satan's first visit to the Cole ranch results in a dead bull, the panicked flight of Sam's beloved mule Becky, and the injury of the family dog Solomon. Jim and Sam go hunting and manage to hurt and intimidate the animal, but as fall arrives he returns and wreaks even more havoc, not only against them but at other places in the valley. Now the cattlemen put a bounty on the bear, which draws hunter Cass Dowdy (Leo Gordon), formerly a deputy of Jim's, who bears him an old grudge and yearns to see him ""busted, flat broke, and beat.""

Much of the charm of the movie is in the picture of a close-knit family making a home for itself in a new land, and in the well-drawn, well-acted characters, including Hank (Jack Elam), the town loafer, Wilhelmina ""Bill"" Peterson (Nancy Kulp of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beverly-Hillbillies-The-Ultimate-Collection-Vol-1/dp/B0009OUBPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beverly Hillbillies: The Ultimate Collection,  Vol. 1</a>), who keeps the general store, and Hazel Squires (Ellen Corby), Duke's tiny, feisty mother. It's true that the ""bear"" in several of the close-ups is obviously a man in a bear suit, but there are also some impressive shots of a genuine grizzly, as well as some gorgeous trans-Divide Wyoming scenery and a generous helping of humor. While there's little man-vs.-man shooting (I won't say none), three fistfights provide some action, and the steadily rising tension between Jim and Angie as the stress tests their marriage, the threat of losing the ranch, and the looming menace of Dowdy keep the suspense going. This would be an excellent movie for ""family night"" viewing; it's been one of my favorites for over three decades.

The DVD version includes a video interview with Walker, who talks about his early career, how NotG happened to get made (he calls it his ""favorite"" of all the films he made), incidents of the filming, and the other cast members.

 Clint is still with us and living in Grass Valley CA(visit his website, he often responds to emails).
Walker was certainly the biggest and most imposing actor ever to appear onscreen, not excepting the body-builder types like Arnold and Reeves. He was perfectly proportioned(compare him to 6', 210lb Ely standing together!)Note: He was and still is an avid exponent of exercise and proper eating. He was also very under-rated as an actor. Very natural. Great screen presence(compare to current crop of stars)and he had a terrific speaking and singing voice.  Great character actors here,(the REAL actors!) in every scene. Especially enjoyed Jack Elam as a good guy, for a change, and nobody does the baddie like Leo Gordon. Regis Toomey, Sammy Jackson and Keenan Wynn...how could you go wrong?
Gorgeously filmed in the Tetons. Uplifting(except for grizzlies, I suppose) and really worth purchasing. Reminds me of when movies were made for all-age viewing, exciting, and left you feeling good.
