6708332,1,B00O3GUZ3Y,"This was one of Republic's last serials, and it's clear no one thought this production mattered.  Episode after episode gets bogged down with a lame fistfight.  Check out the serials from the 1930's and earlier 40's instead.",1451088000,2,224,5.027027027027027

6708341,5,B00O3GUZ3Y,"This was the re-edited feature version of one of the Commando Cody movie serials. It is a fun way to watch if you don't have enough time to watch the whole serial, but it does feel a little rushed because it condenses three hours of story into just over one hour.",1492905600,,263,4.176470588235294
6708342,5,B00O3GUZ3Y,"My father-in-law loved it! He first saw them in the theaters - Nostalgia is a great present.

I also enjoyed them quite a bit.",1482796800,,126,4.25
6708343,3,B00O3GUZ3Y,"This is an edited 62 minute version of the 1952 12-chapter movie serial ""Radar Men From the Moon"" which ran about 160 minutes, including all of the repetition of opening credits and reprises of the previous episode's cliffhangers.  In the 1960s, Republic edited 26 of their serials into ""features"" and these ran on TV, but this is not that version, which was entitled ""Retik The Moon Menace"" and was 100 minutes.  Because the serial fell into public domain, I can only assume that this version was created by the folks at Alpha Video, since an internet search turns up no other references.  This version comprises all of Chapters 1 & 2, about half of Chapter 3, several minutes of Chapter 10, and all of Chapters 11 & 12.  Although no attempt was made to explain certain plot points that now are rather abrupt, it's still reasonably coherent and includes most of the best material from the original version.  And it plays continuously, with no cliffhanger breaks. The picture quality is acceptable, but nothing great (which is par for the course with anything from Alpha Video).  It's certainly not among Republic's best serials, but it's cheesy, goofy fun, with some good miniature work by the legendary Lydecker brothers and the usual over-the-top fight scenes.  The story is ludicrous and the acting is awful, especially from the lead.  Nevertheless, I thought it was an enjoyable was to spend an hour.  And if you have a DVD player that runs at 1.5x speed, with sound, it's a better way to watch it -- the actors speak very slowly, so you can understand everything.  On the other hand, if you'd like to experience this type of thing in a much better presentation, I recommend the recent Olive Films  Blu-Ray or DVD 2-disc set of ""Commando Cody, Sky Marshal of the Universe.""  It's just as cheesy, but you'll see the same flying suit and space ship material with top drawer digitally remastered image quality.",1480636800,2,1912,4.778115501519757
