4396936,5,B004KGQPGS,"Love this movie a whole lot, it is a martyrs story of a devout and holy metropolitan who refuses to give Ivan the Terrible a blessing until he repents and stop his evil acts. This refusal leads to persecution beyond belief for the Metropolitan, his nephew, and his nephews kin. Very graphic however it shows the brutality of Ivan the terrible and what the Martyrs suffered. Subtitles are very well done, the whole menu is in English!",1427068800,3,433,4.636363636363637
4396937,1,B004KGQPGS,"Have loved all Yankovsky films I have ever seen but three minutes of this was just too bloody and  brutal. It may have changed later on in the film but I didn't want to see if it did. If you want a Yankovsky film, and  he was Russsia's greatest actor, try An Ordinary Miracle, Two Comrades Were Serving or A Hunting Drama.  The first is one of the five greatest films of all time.",1410566400,,380,4.108108108108108
4396938,5,B004KGQPGS,"You can either watch this brilliantly filmed,superbly acted,raw,brutal movie that is so typicaly Russian,or you can bend over and have someone wire brush your backside and come away with near identical reactions. Cold and painful,history says it is suppose to be a true representation of the people and of the times. It is a quality production,on par with US standards and is most highly recommended.",1329955200,,400,5.1692307692307695
4396939,5,B004KGQPGS,"This movie doesn't pull any punches when depicting the real life atrocities committed by Ivan The Terrible. If you're squeamish, this isn't the movie for you. This film is a fascinating look at one of the most brutal dictators in history, and his relationship with his friend and also nemesis, Phillip, who later became a Saint. The acting is superb. Perhaps the story is too close to reality, because those who don't know anything about Ivan might be confounded after watching the movie -- a lot of what he does in the film doesn't make sense. This is exactly how his life was as an absolute ruler. Great movie. This DVD was excellent also and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1295740800,8,669,4.630252100840337
4396940,5,B004KGQPGS,"Whether or not you have an interest in Russian history and in particular, Ivan The Terrible, this film is worth seeing. The acting is masterful with both main actors Pyotr Mamonov (Ivan) and Oleg Yankovskiy (Philipp). The film is an alternating battle between vengeance and mercy, and a look into the inner conflict between two powerful men who shaped the course of Russian history. The directing was a bit uneven at times, but the acting and beautifully done cinematography more than made up for it. This DVD is excellent. Picture and sound were clear, and the English subtitles were perfect.",1295740800,4,593,4.94

8432963,1,B004KGQPGS,"A number of the artists that made this film have worked together on other projects, some of them quite brilliant. This film is likewise technically well-made but otherwise it is... awful. We suffered through it as long we could stomach it, then turned it off. We suggest you don't even bother turning it on.",1509667200,,307,4.703703703703703
8432964,5,B004KGQPGS,Amazing,1507766400,,7,7.0
8432965,4,B004KGQPGS,"If you are not used to the darkness that frequently shrouds Russian literature and films, please stay away from this one. If you are, the story line and depiction are brilliant. Over and over again, in old Russian culture, we come upon the theme of redemption by suffering, and it is present here as well, though only implicitly. How far that redemption actually extends, is a matter of debate. At the very end, has Ivan undergone a catharsis or a foretaste of eternal reprobation. Watch the movie and come to your own conclusion.
The outwardly stoic expression of an inwardly troubled man is captured well in the accompanying detail of a painting by Nikolai Nevrev (public domain, Wikimedia).
I have to disagree with one reviewer's praise of the subtitles. The English is highly deficient, and there are even letters and words, not only in Russian, but actually in Cyrillic script. I can't understand why he called them ""perfect."" Fulsome praise for an obviously deficient aspect can lead to skepticism on the reviewer's other comments.",1506297600,8,1037,4.9655172413793105
8432966,5,B004KGQPGS,A very unique film about Ivan. This is nothing like  Eisenstein's movie. Here Ivan is shown as a more merciful tsar until the last 30 minutes of the film when he ''flips out.'',1506038400,,176,4.333333333333333
8432967,4,B004KGQPGS,Well made film. It is amazing how ridiculous people were with religion. Crawling through the streets ha!,1504656000,,104,5.176470588235294
8432968,3,B004KGQPGS,Fascinating if a bit overwrought view into an important era in Russian history.  The telling gives as much insight into Russian history and culture as the story itself.  Worst English subtitles EVER!!,1504310400,3,200,5.21875
8432969,5,B004KGQPGS,amazing movie can get long at some points but a great dipiction of an orthodox saint/ martyr and the crazy ivan the terrible.,1502668800,,125,4.478260869565218
8432970,5,B004KGQPGS,"The other reviews have many great points, so I will focus on what impressed me most. Ivan, played by Pytor Mamanov is pure genius. The Tsar's diordered thinking is depicted without cliche. His high mindedness and slyness and paranoia seem perflectly timed. How it imposes on the psyches of the people is also moving. When westerners try to write about Russia, it can only be an educated guess. But here we have Russians telling their most infamous tale without holding back. It is beautiful and powerful because this is their history told in their own voice.",1501113600,9,558,4.822916666666667
