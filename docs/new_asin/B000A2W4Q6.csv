Why would anyone buy this product if even the movies contained in it are not even listed?  Does anyone monitor this?  Today, there is nothing on this page that even mentions a single detail about what is being offered for sale.  2 Reviews of the product exist.  2 simple brief reviews that go into no detail about anything.  No details, not even the names of the movies in this set are mentioned anywhere.  What would you get if you bought this collection?  Why not even a list of the movie names?",1265846400,6,626,4.469026548672566
8073319,4,B000A2W4Q6,"I thouroughly enjoyed watching the Harrison Ford Collection.  This collection is one of best of his works.  I really liked the way these three movies are down.  They are full of action, suspense, drama, and lots of action.  Its a definite purchase to have in one's collection.  I liked it and would recommend it to you.  Go get it and own it.
