8402603,5,B003QUBTEC,"This is a magnificent recording from Maestro Riccardo Muti, I understand the ""first chapter"" released out of a series of eight ""Concert Lessons"", where Maestro Muti will explain to us eight masterpieces from great composers (Berlioz, Verdi, Schubert, Rossini, Cimarosa, Mozart, Paisiello and Dvorak). In this first ""concert lesson"", Maestro Muti wisely explains to us this masterpiece from Berlioz and also allows us to realize the great importance of conducting, working together with ""Orchestra Giovanile Luigi Cherubini"". Congratulations for this excellent and unique recording and we really hope the next seven chapters coming up; which of course will be useful for those people studying music but also for any fan of the art of conducting.
