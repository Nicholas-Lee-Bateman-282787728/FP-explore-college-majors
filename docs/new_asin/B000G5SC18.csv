8472670,1,B000G5SC18,"Unfortunately, another ""don't waste your money"" Does everyone with a video camera think they are qualified to do a travel film??? Or does it have something to do with vacation travel & tax write offs? I don't know but this is another example of bad production, sound, visuals, content... Sorry for being harsh but I was excited to order this (video/dvd material on the subject of Sicily is hard to find) and looking forward to receiving it and then was really let down. Don't waste your money!",1171324800,4,493,4.67816091954023
