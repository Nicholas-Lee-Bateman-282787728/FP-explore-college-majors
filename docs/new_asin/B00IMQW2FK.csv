8643449,1,B00IMQW2FK,"Maybe my fault for not realizing that this was NOT a movie but a documentary.  If you are big on history perhaps you would enjoy, but if you are looking for a love story acted out, this isn't it.  Had I been a little less anxious to place an order I may have realized that there are no actors listed.  Since I often buy British films the actors are not always known to me and I have apparently become careless in my reviews.  I found the editors remarks to be misleading also, although it is pointed out that they were in love, it could hardly be a love story.",1456012800,,560,4.110091743119266
