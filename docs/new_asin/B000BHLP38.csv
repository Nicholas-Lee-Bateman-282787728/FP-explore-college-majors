8086798,4,B000BHLP38,"Well in ireland where i live yes it is released. Strange........things always seem to be released in america first. ANYWAY the dvd.firstly let me start by saying i am a hugh chili peppers fan and know almost everything there is to know about them. This dvd is a documentry of the chili peppers carreer and although a bit short at 68 mins.its good and interesting,but........i think youd be better off buying their biography 'by the way'as it is similar but with more detail.however if your buying your first chili peppers dvd just buy live at slane for some real magik that will convince you that they are an unbeatable unstoppable force.but yes phenomonom is good if you want a solid outline of the career of the planets most incredible band.boy this review sure is long.one letdown of this dvd is not many interviews with the band themselves. i love RHCP.THATS ALL FOLKS!!",1136592000,27,874,4.756578947368421
