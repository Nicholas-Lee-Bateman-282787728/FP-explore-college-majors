8252756,5,B0013SYI4W,Have wanted to make this for a long time--never have done steeks-watched this as soon as it came--I learned so much!!,1489449600,,117,4.619047619047619
8252757,5,B0013SYI4W,Knitting with ease after watching DVD. I'm familiar with Meg and her mother Elizabeth's pattern writing...tricky to follow at times. I highly recommend this item as it couldn't be more clear in assisting the knitter. Meg's teaching is wonderful!,1393891200,,245,5.3076923076923075
8252758,5,B0013SYI4W,"Normally I would think twice about spending the extra 20$$ for a DVD that I may only use once,, but I have wanted to knit this garment for a long long time,,,,and I didn't want to take any chances on it.
 I wanted it to be done right b/c this was a gift and I am really picky on how my finished garments look,,,they have to look like a lovely handknit garment and not homeade,, there IS a difference!
I did order the yarn suggested from the company,and was really taken aback w/ how very much yarn has gone up in the past few years! ( talk about sticker shock!!) I do happen to think 75$ for a vest is a LOT of money, but I had to consider the fact  that he will be wearing this for many years. Ok,,,,,I ordered the yarn that the book suggested ( but you can use just about any yarn you wish,,,,keeping in mind that if you steek it MUST be wool)

Another concern of mine and reason to order this DVD was about where to add the short rows for no ride up in the sweater and a few other things.

This is a great garment to learn to use the steeking process b/c it is a quick knit,, and you get right to the heart of the matter w/ steeking.
Meg does show you how easy it is to do this as well as other tips I would not have had if I simply followed the book,,,,,,so..... if you want to learn how to steek, this is a great place to learn~

I did find that this DVD to be very helpful, and now that I own it, I plan to make more than just one of these vests
In fact; I do plan to make myself a few more for winter ,, but use a merino yarn that is soft and will not be scratchy when I wear it as an indoor vest instead of using the suggested yarn which I used for the first vest for DH~

He will wear his vest while hunting or skiing this year w/ a jacket over it and be very toasty warm, but I wanted to make myself a vest w/ the very soft merino's or merino/silk yarns I love so I pulled out a few different yarns I owned and set out to make one for myself~ I have toyed w/ the idea of making one in hunters orange in case it isn't so cold outside that he has to wear an orange jacket over his vest.

 For myself,,, I used my size by using the EPS numbers and ease I wanted, and then added  waist shaping for myself~

Turned out really cute and nicely fit for myself also,, w/ the extra waist shaping I added, a perfect garment to wear w/ a turtleneck or blouse, I really love it!
I am planning on a few more for Christmas gifts this year,,,,,they really are super quick to knit up yet look really nice and finished off  when following the directions.
 The shawl collar is cute,( or handsome depending on the recepient), the cables are very simple and if you work it up in your size and favorite yarns ( shaping if you wish) you will have a really pretty vest that does not look "" outdoorsy"" at all!
Of course the first version I made for DH is in fact a really handsome looking vest and he loves it and will wear it often.

All in all,,, it was worth the extra money to get it b/c I will be using it much more than one time, and Meg's DVDs are really nice to have on hand as teaching tools for yourself or others~ Happy Knitting~",1345680000,4,3125,3.910094637223975
8252759,5,B0013SYI4W,"I love the EZ method of making a project your own, with your yarn at your gauge.  That said, I did like the bit more hand-holding that this DVD provides for the written instructions in Meg Swansen's Handknitting book. I am an experienced knitter, I knit cables without a cable needle, but yet, there was a very clever tip on this DVD about knowing when it is time to cross the stitches.  It made the DVD completely worth the little extra expense.  Plus there are kitties and you get a taste of Meg's design process.  If you want to make this lovely vest, I'd highly recommend getting this DVD.",1232841600,4,593,4.412844036697248
