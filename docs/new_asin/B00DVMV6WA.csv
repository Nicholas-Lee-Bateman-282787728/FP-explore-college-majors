8598358,5,B00DVMV6WA,"This Blu Ray DVD opens with a flight from Oslo Gardemoen airport to Longyearbyen airport on the Norwegian island of Svalbard north of the Artic Circle and not so far from the North Pole. Each subsequent flight operates to and from Gardemoen with the exception of the closing sequence of a flight to Cologne, Germany. As usual the Just Planes visuals are interesting and informative. Five of the flights are on board B737-800 aircraft with one on a B737-300, providing an interesting contrast between old and new. The Blu Ray process makes all visuals especially sharp and cockpit instruments are easy to read. This would be a good choice for anyone's collection.",1459641600,,662,4.919642857142857
