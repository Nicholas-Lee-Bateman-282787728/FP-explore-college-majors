8590659,3,B00D8N8QB6,"Very disappointed.  I couldn't even get through the entire workout the first time because the background music was so irritating.  I finally tried it a second time, got through the irritating music and it kind of goes away towards the end.  I have not used it again.  Being that it was not cheap, I will deal with the music and write down the entire workout and then mute the DVD and still work out to it but with my music.  I loved her book ""The Swing"", I loved the ""Top Forty"" and I love the ""Give and Take"" DVD and I would probably love this DVD if the music wasn't there.  Maybe they could redo without it??",1384905600,8,611,4.17948717948718
8590660,5,B00D8N8QB6,"Two great workouts on this DVD; with an instructor who knows her stuff.  Stop wasting money on other Kettlebell workouts that you will only do once; her DVDs will get you training , while having fun.  I was a martial artist for 18 yrs. & have an eye for form & Tracys form is right on.  Without good form you'll end up with injuries; which will knock you off training.  If you want to train with Kettlebells, Tracy is the instructor to go with.  This DVD is fun & the workout is over before you know it & you will have done hundreds of swings.  I really recommend any of her DVDs.",1371859200,10,580,4.133928571428571
