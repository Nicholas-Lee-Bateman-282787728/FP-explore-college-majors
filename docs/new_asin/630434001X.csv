Our family used them in a study of Anceint History & there were way to many classical naked pictures for young children scattered through out the movie. Some of the speakers also did not seem to really know the God of which they spoke.,1405382400,,308,4.237288135593221

My preference (and thus only 3 stars) is for the National Geographic program, though, as relevant texts (including apocryphal and traditional)from Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are brought into the discussion to shed light on the subject in the NG approach.
