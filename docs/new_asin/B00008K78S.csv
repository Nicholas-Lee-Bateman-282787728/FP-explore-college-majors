7985401,1,B00008K78S,I'm not sure if the acting or plot was worse in this movie. I read the reviews before my purchase thinking it couldn't be that bad....but it was.  The CIA and FBI should use this type of movie for interrogation purposes.,1134950400,,220,4.365853658536586
7985402,3,B00008K78S,"Necropolis Awakened (Garrett White, 2002)

Garrett White's debut film, Necropolis Awakened, had a small budget. Okay, a really small budget. I'm not sure exactly what the budget was, but I'm guessing that the $7,000 on which Robert Rodriguez made El Mariachi was an A-list Hollywood budget, by comparison. Did I mention the budget was minuscule?

The box says Necropolis Awakened is ""Pulp Fiction meets Day of the Dead,"" but I'd have to say that the copywriter was a little over-ambitious (and probably didn't have too much wide-ranging experience in movies). Necropolis Awakened is a lot more like El Mariachi meets The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies. And the one thing, aside from both resembling this movie in major ways, those two films have in common is that, while most people find them unwatchable, there are a small cadre of those who think they're brilliant. I have no doubt that Necropolis Awakened, too, will find a place on the shelf of sacred low-budget films in a number of households.

The story: a team of assassins, headed up by the insane Judas (Duke White), have been hired by the head of the Genentech Corporation, Nefarious Thorne (Brandon White). Thorne has been using the town of Sky Hook, Oregon, as an experiment, creating undead from the townspeople. He's eliminated them all in one way or another except for the reclusive drunk, Bob (Duke White). That's what Judas and his sidekicks, Gog (Brandon White) and Detroit (Brandon Dubisar), are here for. Once Bob's out of the way, the undead can boil up out of the depths of Sky Hook, Oregon, and take over the world.

Well, except that when one boils up out of Sky Hook, Oregon, one is likely to have a pretty long walk before one gets to civilization, much less taking over the world. That's the kind of subtle weirdness the movie has going on underneath the surface. White uses the isolation of his locations to great advantage, as he does a number of other details where his movie differs from every other zombie movie you've ever seen (when was the last time you saw zombies that didn't try to consume human flesh?). There's a lot of potential lying untapped in the zombie-movie market with variants, as Hollywood recently discovered with the fast-zombie craze. White, however, had started in on the variant-zombie market before Hollywood got there. Surprise, surprise, an independent filmmaker came up with something first. Perish the thought.

As well, White has studied the horror-film camerawork playbook, and it shows. A lot of independent and no-budget films look amateur not only because they're not using professional quality film stock, but because the cameraman just doesn't really have the observancy to have picked up on subtle shots while watching old horror films himself. Both White and cinematographer Coren Slogowski have obviously logged a whole lot of hours in front of the video deck taking notes. Many of the shots that work, when done right, in horror films are here. This is an amateur production, but an amateur production by a gifted, but inconsistent, crew.

The inconsistency comes most times while in front of the camera. Most of the actors (as with Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead, the actors and the crew are often the same folks) are uniformly bad. Necropolis Awakened is a study in overacting. However, it does have some moments of brilliance even in this regard; Duke White (whose early soliloquy after Bob first encounters Tiden in the film is the movie's single worst piece of overacting) brings a twitchy, backwoods-redneck feel to Judas that really works. Judas, however, is the only character the audience is likely to see as anything more than an overacted cutout.

Also, certain cuts made (watch the deleted scenes in the DVD extras) lead to certain pieces of the finished film not making quite enough sense without the deleted material, but it's impossible to fault an indie film for that when Hollywood makes the same mistake on almost every film it releases.

Overall, it's hard to call Necropolis Awakened ""watchable,"" and it's impossible to call it a horror film. But if you look at it as an action comedy by a group of people who, given a budget and some real actors to put in front of the cameras, have potential out the ying-yang, then Necropolis Awakened is a valuable archival document. Garrett White and his brothers are going places (and taking Slogowski with them, hopefully), and a whole lot of worse first steps on that road have been made than Necropolis Awakened. ** ",1095984000,6,4556,4.921875
7985403,4,B00008K78S,"I'm a sucker for low-budget straight to video titles, so upon reading some of the reviews on this site I decided to pick up Necropolis Awakened and give it a chance.
Since the movie's plot has already been covered I'll skip straight to the extra's. For a relatively unknown movie I was surprised how packed the disc was, featuring commentary, a making of, deleted scenes and a short "" Monster. ""
The making-of proved to be my favorite part of the disc, as it shows just how creative you can get with such a small budget. All the actors playing multiple parts took me off guard ( I didn't even realize it until the movie was over ) and the cast and crew seemed like they were having a good time throughout, burning plastic faces, flipping cars and shooting "" rocket launchers. ""
The short "" Monster "" is much the same as the movie, a fast(er) paced horror movie that is ( sort of ) based on Frankenstein and has Duke White playing not two but three(!!) of the main parts.
All in all I found the extras ( and the movie - overthetop acting aside ) to be great for all us wannabe filmmakers out there wanting to see how a lowbudget movie is made, it's a definate recommendation if you'd like to see what its like to make a movie in under 10k.",1078876800,2,1238,4.25
7985404,1,B00008K78S,"The premise and some of the special effects were good, but the acting was awful! I cant' believe so many people loved this movie.  I can honestly say it was the worst movie I ever have seen.  My husband and a movie going friend of ours also hated it (and he normally likes quirky movies).

One of the reviewers I read said, ""Wow, look what they did on a $7500.00 budget."" Maybe they should have used some of that money for acting lessons for Duke White! I still think that they made the movie with intentional bad acting!
I bought this movie solely on these reviews (which I have done many times before) and this is the first time I was steered very wrong.  A word to anyone wanting to buy this movie, save your money and don't do it.  It is not even worth renting! I wish I could have given it zero stars!",1077840000,4,806,4.174193548387096
7985405,1,B00008K78S,"...I couldn't watch any more of this ridiculous shlocker after the first ten minutes.  The acting goes beyond awful.....so if it's good, I'll never know!!!",1076284800,4,155,5.2
7985406,5,B00008K78S,"Necropolis Awakened opens with a car chase through wide-open sage plateau country. Two cars full of white shirted henchmen are hot on the trail of our hero, Bob, the last sentient resident of the town of Skyhook. Just as Bob is within their grasp, one of the Assassins pulls a gun and fires on his own, sending their car careening into the dust.
What follows is a chronicle of Bob's effort to defeat the evil plans of Nefarious Thorne and his undead zombies. Thorne, the leader of a company called Neo-Genentrix, has chosen Skyhook for his evil experiment and only Bob and his nephew can stop them. The two remaining Assassins, after executing their traitorous partner, are hot on his trail.
Part of the delight of watching this flick had to do with knowing it was mader for under $7,500, but beyond that, I was surprised at just how good Necropolis Awakened was.
Sure, the plot if pretty standard zombie-flick fare, but what impressed me was the ambitious effort at details. A couple of action sequences are impressively staged and shot, particularly a rollicking free for all on an old Ford Pinto. Nefarious Thorne is truly creepy, as is the scene featuring the zombiefication of the traitor Assassin. I also loved how the filmmakers managed to use a lot of the cattle range equipment at their disposal ( squeeze chutes, hay barns and so forth. ) to create atmosphere.
The result is a pretty heroic effort. Necropolis Awakened packs a lot of jury-rigged ingenuity and ambition, as well as the odd rocket launcher, into it's 93 minutes.",1074211200,3,1537,4.760299625468165
7985407,4,B00008K78S,"It's amazing how many different kind of nobudget direct-to-video movies there are. Most share two common traits, they're made for next to nothin' and they're crap. thankfully only one applies here. i was amazed at how much work was done in this movie by only three people. the commentary and behind the scenes were great and for such a low budget movie, there were alot of special features. always a plus. you must be warned though, don't expect a hollywood look here, its definately low budget and it shows. but the ambition is great and the performances are so over the top its hard not to laugh. all in all a great little nobudget movie.",1067299200,,640,4.573913043478261
7985408,1,B00008K78S,"Five stars what do you guys have points on this movie.  Easily some of the worst acting and cheesiest special effects I've ever seen in a zombie movie.  I don't understand why it is so hard to make a good zombie film these days.  What was Night of the Living Dead.  Shoe-string budget, unknown actors, no special effects, little makeup, and B&W and it's the greatest zombie film ever.  The time it stole from my life is one thing but I actually paid for this.  $20 for a movie I watched once, then slamdunked into my garbage can.  Unless someone gives it to you or you find it somewhere like in my dumpster, don't bother.  LATERZ.",1063152000,3,630,4.370689655172414
