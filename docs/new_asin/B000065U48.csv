8230065,1,B000065U48,"The makers of this video make a practice of endangering people around the country, and filming it.  They continue the practice.  Been an Amazon customer since 1992.  This item does not make me happy.  You may be placing your company in financial danger if these wackaloons kill someone.  Stop selling this item.",1356739200,,311,4.903846153846154
8230066,3,B000065U48,"This is the first film of the Mischief series, and it shows.  They're starting to decide what the ""Mischief thing"" is, and it's just too unfocused.  I appreciate the enthusiasm of showing tons of different action clips, but there are so many, that it becomes a mash up.  Here's what's in it: Random street racing clips, donuts in the snow, jumping a rental car (pretty funny, fyi), detroit auto show, offroading a rental (hopefully) car, skateboarding, motorcycle stunting, drag racing, dirt biking, drag racing crashes.  There's also a classic clip that you may have seen on youtube: there's a massive street race that get's shut down by the police where they trap everyone in and start towing and ticketing.  Some guys in an MR2 form a plan with a couple other drivers to escape and avoid being ticketed.  I was happy to see that again.",1328918400,,838,4.744827586206896
8230067,4,B000065U48,I have to admit the first one was good but not really good but part 2 and 4 are really good Im looking to buy the other one right now.  If your in to street racing you will like this and all the other.  It is the best of all the import racing videos that I own.,1083542400,,261,3.56140350877193
8230068,2,B000065U48,"This movie is filled with short drag races.  Quater mile, Eighth, muscle cars, rice burners, even suvs.  They also have s part refered to as ""auto abuse"". I acctually found this segment dissappointing but on the other hand i'm a bit more wild.  Not something that can be watched more than 2 or 3 times",1071100800,,301,4.4363636363636365
8230069,5,B000065U48,"Mischief is the first of 3 volumes. Its packed with tons of action including burnouts, donuts, bikes, and hot imports. If your into street racing than this is the video, you might also want to check out the other videos from mischif coming soon. Its the best 60 min. video ever. This is the real fast and fuious.",1057104000,,312,4.396551724137931
8230070,4,B000065U48,"Don't listen to the complaint about less than average film quality. While I can't object to this, to get movie quality shots, you would need movie quality equipment. This would have to be set up, adjusted, and prepared; things that would be nearly impossible to do to catch shots of street racing. This a sport that is a fast-paced and on the moment, and leaves as quickly as it comes. The only thing that can realistically capture this kind of footage is a handheld camcorder. While you may complain about the quality of the picture, this is the best it could get for this particular type of film. If you were to ask me, I would tell you that this is extremely entertaining. It's rough and gritty appearance only adds to its underground appeal. To the those that would judge this harshly, consider this one of those guilty pleasures that you watch but don't tell your friends about. To everyone else, this a great film to watch and great fun as well.",1048896000,3,951,4.534883720930233
8230071,1,B000065U48,"They got it right on the cover. It says ""This video blows"" i guess I should've heeded the warning. I would've been better entertained by dropping my money in a paper shredder.",1048809600,2,175,4.5
8230072,2,B000065U48,"If you are into AMATEUR mediocre video's, buy this one, if not, DON'T and buy the BEST MOTORING DVD and VHS videos",1044403200,4,114,4.2272727272727275
8230073,4,B000065U48,"This DVD is one of the coolest 'documentaries' that I have ever seen.  It seems like you're right with the authors, whether it be avoiding the police or whipping around through traffic in exotic cars.  This fast paced DVD will keep you glued to your seat wondering ""what will they do next?""  The music combined with the footage is right on.  From the beginning to the end this DVD stands out from most other documentaries.  If you're into the 'underground' race scene I highly suggest this DVD.",1039219200,,494,4.632183908045977
