5392258,4,B00A7F0LDY,"You know it's coming - but when homicide hits in this movie, it comes with the speed of a rattlesnake strike. It's swifter than the eye can capture, and it's more sinister than any thuggish attack could ever be.

After a shocker of an opening sequence, the movie proceeds at a slower pace for a while. We see the very socially awkward and involute Bess yearning after the handsome jock in her school. The tension builds as we wonder how far her obsession has taken her in the past and is taking her in the present. Almost everyone is suspect though.

This is a good effort at a psychological thriller. The protagonists really talk with each other - or at least exchange more telling texts. So we get to know them better than we do in the average thriller that's being cranked out. Their motivations aren't always very clear or consistent, and the writers perhaps did some reaching for a different, interesting resolution. But I think you'll find this movie worth your time.

One warning: Don't look too closely at the jacket of the DVD, so no part of the ending will be revealed to you.",1366070400,5,1086,4.530612244897959
5392259,3,B00A7F0LDY,"The film centers around Bess (Crystal Reed) and her crush on Scott (Lucas Till). Bess is the socially awkward new kid. She seemingly lives alone in a house while working at a book store. Scott has looks, brains, and athletic ability. All the girls drool over him. Jules (Sarah Bolger) is his girlfriend who he breaks up with because he needs to concentrate. (Seriously, can you believe a guy wrote this?)

Other people include teammate Casey (Preston Davis) who believes Scott is a ball hog. Scott's dad is protective and is always going out to work. And Jeffrey (Reid Ewing) has a crush on Bess. Their relationship is encouraged by an older woman and confidant (Meredith Salenger) who works at the bookshop.

Accidents happen to people around Scott. We get to see the arm or hand of the person who is revealed to us about an hour into the film when our fairly decent mystery turns into ""Misery.""

I couldn't help think that the song ""Love Stinks"" would have made a good title track had they made this film 30 years ago...before the target audience existed. The film covers the many aspect of teen angst as we see it cross the line from ""cute to creepy."" As part of the older crowd, I had to laugh when two teens standing on opposites sides of a glass door opt to have a conversation by texting. Open your mouths!

At one point Scott finds a note in his locker. The movie didn't give me tie to read it. I had to pause the film.

I like quirky crush films where we know who the killer is and see the odd if not comical things she does. This isn't that film and it would have worked better my way. This is a film for those girls whose first crush still weighs heavy.

This was better than most thriller films I've watched in theaters.  Very subtle creepiness builds until the finale -- and you'll never see the twist coming.  Really cool, I think you'll enjoy.

5392270,3,B00A7F0LDY,"The movie was fairly interesting and a cut-above-average than the usual suspense film these days right up until the last part. The protagonist was portrayed sympathetically and, surprisingly, it was a man in distress.  However, the circumstances in which the culprit was revealed led to a rather stereotypical ending.  It's hard to imagine how it might have been executed better at the end. Then, again, it is easier to be a critic than a film writer or director. It might have been nicer to provide even more depth to the characters, pparticularly the protagonist, his father, girlfriend, admirer, and, of course, the ultimate culprit.",1440115200,,636,5.105769230769231

Its tricky because they have the same look except the age differences (look at alone the movie poster). I always thought movie like this always happened all the time; One of the reason we had so many missing person these days. Obsession is very creepy. I would rather be obsess with my cats than to be obsess with a person. You will never going to be happy as long as you kept on holding to one person that will NEVER be yours.

5392280,2,B00A7F0LDY,"I am not in the teenage bracket so I gave an extra star for that.  I watched it with my daughter though and she was bored.  One of my all time favorite movies is Fatal Attraction WHICH IS WAY BETTER THAN THIS FILM!! This film copied greatly from that Kathy Bates movie Misery.  The problem more than anything else is that the film was boring.  If it were exciting it wouldn't even matter how silly it was concocted.  The girl you think at first will be the psycho but isn't reminded me of Jodi Arias, she was really good in her role but just couldn't save this film from going down.  Admittedly it was so dull and I watched it after been up too many hours so I kind of went in ""half sleep orbit"" after the ""big twist I read about in other reviews"" which was still dull but would never be inspired to watch this disaster again.  If you want to watch a really great thriller of this genre I suggest BASIC INSTINCT OR FATAL ATTRACTION.  I purchased this off other reviews that spoke to how great this was so I went in with an wide open mind but perhaps too high of expectations.  All this being said though I still think somebody sixteen or seventeen would like it; the guy everybody was hot for was great looking.",1397001600,,1211,4.230434782608696

Crush (2013) *1/2 / 4
D: Malik Bader
C: Lucas Till, Crystal Reed, Sarah Bolger, Meredith Salenger, Caitriona Balfe, Reid Ewing, Leigh Whannell, Holt McCallany, Camille Guaty
P: A star athlete becomes the object of obsession for a secret admirer who's willing to do anything, including murder, to eliminate to the competition.

Fatal Attraction light for the teenage demographic. Crush is one of those films that I can easily imagine a bunch of teenage girls watching while at a slumber party.

Lucas Till is dreamy. Crystal Reed is angsty. There's a few false scares throughout, but nothing too terribly suspenseful. The dialogue, the interactions between the characters and the overall characterizations have been simplified for its target audience. Ohhhh .....and there's a twist.

Surprisingly though, Crush is well made and well acted. A lot better made and acted then the genre requires of it. However, it's too mild mannered in its approach. It's unimaginative and an unnecessary addition to the genre. It's teen audience will, at the least, find Crush watchable, but that's because they really don't know any better. Horror & thriller aficionados will be bored as Crush is just another relentlessly lackluster example of the genre, the type of PG-13 type dreck that fans bemoan about online.

5392285,3,B00A7F0LDY,"I enjoyed this movie. I know people bash on it a lot, but sometimes you have to accept movies for what they are. This movie was meant to me a teen thriller, an adolescent version of fatal attraction so to speak. Sure the film does not have the best acting, the plot has been done before, and the film is a bit predictable, but I did not expect this movie to be oscar worthy or change my life. I expected it to be a teeny-bopper thriller. And that's what I got. Not the best movie but not a waste of time.",1387065600,2,504,4.0
5392286,3,B00A7F0LDY,"CRUSH is slow-moving, virtually humorless, without a lot of serious tension or big turnabouts, and a bit hard to follow. A lot of people obviously like the twist at the end, but all I can say is that it didn't surprise me that much. Nevertheless, the ending IS a lot more effective and conclusive than many of them. CRUSH is also realistically filmed and acted and gives a convincing view of the darker aspects of adolescence, capturing its angst, jealousy, loneliness, and love hexagrams very well. The way the girls in the film all look sort of alike is initially confusing but really serves its purpose in the end. All things considered, CRUSH is like a fairly good Lifetime film on PCP.",1383350400,,690,4.663934426229508
5392287,5,B00A7F0LDY,"Everything in this movie seems to set up for just another good movie, describing a shy, sweet girl's descent into madness and obsession. Except there's a lot of nice things done with it. The girl is geniuely threatening, the stalking dynamic is explored. If it was a girl, everyone would be worried, but here Scott gets shouts of ""You're not so special !"" when he starts telling people about what happens. Everyone condomes Bess's behavior and no one really gets how self-destructive this is. Then comes the twist, and it manages to keep all the strengths of the movie and add no weakness. The ending for the side-characters is suitably moving and cute, and everything in the main plot is gruesome and mysterious enough, even though you wouldn't know that untill you watch it for the 2 first acts.",1383264000,,797,4.741007194244604

5392291,4,B00A7F0LDY,"If you've seen the 90's Silverstone movie ""The Crush"", you might think like I did upon reading the title that this was some sort of remake.  Well it's not, though it's the same premise; psychotic crushes.  While the theme isn't original, ""Crush"" is executed in a surprising and refreshing new way.  I also got some new insights on a few things that I thought I'd share, namely:

- Running is hazardous to your health, so just say no to running
- Cell phones are not idiot proof
- Bangs are back in style for summer
- Bicycle abuse is rampant, we need legislation to stop these atrocities perpetrated against our two wheeled friends
- And last and most important, the stalker of your stalker is your friend :)",1373846400,2,708,4.5078125

5392295,3,B00A7F0LDY,"In a movie intended to keep the audience guessing who the killer is until the end, putting her photo on the box cover really lessens the suspense.  I guess the box graphics people don't talk with the plot people!",1371340800,,212,4.435897435897436
5392296,4,B00A7F0LDY,"CRUSH explores the oft-used theme of a predatory female terrorizing the popular high school jock.  Methodically paced and apparently predictable, CRUSH pulls a whopper of a 180 and pulls the biggest I GOTCHA in modern horror cinema.
The moment before this deception occurred, I told my wife ""I wonder..."" and kaboom, I was right.  That twist did demonstrate the writer's cleverness in working his audience and makes CRUSH a tidy little thriller.  Lucas Till brings a sense of honor to a usually clich role; Crystal Reed has a disturbing edginess as mousy Bess and Sarah Bol;ger displays both sexiness and naivete in her role of Till's true love.
CRUSH manipulates the viewer quite shamelessly and sets a new standard for cinema stalkers.",1370736000,,737,5.024590163934426

5392298,4,B00A7F0LDY,"I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I rented it thinking I'd kill a little time with a goofy slasher flick, but instead Crush caught me completely off guard: it's that rare suspense flick (not quite a horror film) which deals with/ is aimed at young adults but takes its time in creating interesting characters instead of just rushing headlong to some cheap payoff.

The structure and really all of the plot elements will be very familiar to any fan of the genre- but ""Crush"" is elevated by crisp direction and pacing, a very good score, fine and even nuanced acting by all of the leads, (especially the actress who plays Bess; no matter how desperate and bizarre her behavior seems to get, you never stop feeling empathy for her) and a screenplay that genuinely strives to create real people.
There's just no laziness here: it's obvious that everyone involved truly cared about this movie and how it turned out.

I'm not saying this is a masterpiece of cinema by any stretch, and they don't quite stick the landing at the end- but this has to be the best ""teenage crush turns deadly"" movie ever.

Highly recommended. 4.25 stars out 5.",1370044800,,1154,4.619512195121951
5392299,3,B00A7F0LDY,"The movie is boring.  The plot isn't original.  It's about a girl who has a crush on a soccer player who doesn't return her feelings then bad things start to happen to his friends.  What made the movie a snoozer for us is there isn't any suspense.  The tormenting of the friends is very mild compared to other movies in the genre.  His friends open their curtains to find writing on their window stating ""He's Mine"".  Ohh then his girlfriend's nude pic gets sent to everyone in school.  And the most frightening is when his iPhone gets dropped in the swimming pool.

The twist ending where the stalker isn't who you think she/he is didn't do much to redeem the movie.  I would recommend a rental as opposed to purchasing it outright.  If you want a ""fatal attraction""/crush gone wrong movie I would recommend Fatal Attraction or Crush (staring Alicia Silverstone).  Fatal Attraction and Crush (with Alicia Silverstone) are older movies but they are well done and suspensefull.  Yes, a bit precictable but if it is well done then it will suck you in and you won't care.",1369958400,,1068,4.622340425531915

5392301,2,B00A7F0LDY,"The ending is the worst. But the rest of the movie is not that bad. The whole movie they try to keep you guessing what is happening and what is going on, but they cant find a way to get you intensely involved with the story line. If you are the type of person that loves a thriller movie to sink into your skin and have your mind guessing....then don't waste your money on this movie. This is more the type of movie to watch when you cant find anything else to watch and you want to find something to pass the time. Or you should show this movie to tweens in high-school to show them what a bad example of crushing looks like haha",1368057600,,630,4.048
5392302,3,B00A7F0LDY,"I really loved a great deal about this movie and I still think it's very worthwhile.  However, there is a flaw that prevented it from becoming a small cult classic.  They try way too hard to keep the audience off balance.  I never thought I would call that a flaw.  This is a very rare instance where they should have kept the plot slightly more derivative and stuck with the formula.  I won't give spoilers.  I kept thinking through the first half of the movie how much better it seemed than impressions I formed from reading reviews.  It's just that a certain moment arrives in the movie and it simply changes the atmosphere, not because it was implausible, but because it simply tried too hard.  Twists and surprises are great.  Sometimes too many spoil the strength of the punch line.  Too much of a good thing.  It's like when I made this girl I liked in college two cheesecakes for her birthday.  I was completely genuine, the cheesecakes were awesome, but sometimes it's just too much and you can guess the effect.

THE GOOD: With that out of the way, I want to say how much this movie really had going for it.  Crystal Reed is very, very good as the creepy quiet girl with the crush.  Yet in the fantasy scene where she imagines herself with confidence, the transformation is astounding and she is so gorgeous and nice it's heartbreaking.  It's just a fleeting glimpse for the audience to see what could be, yet is not real.  Lucas Till as the object of her desire is also terrific.  The temptation to turn him into such an adonis that the audience secretly hates him was thankfully avoided.  He is appropriately handsome enough to attract a fanatic admirer, athletic yet still very sympathetic.  He is a good guy.  I have loved Sarah Bolger ever since I saw her in Tudors and she definitely isn't a disappointment in this movie.  All the performances were spot on and deserve all the praise that can be given.  Still, Crystal Reed as the primary is really the one that sells it.  The characters and plot are really well fleshed out and would have carried the movie, without that one or two extra twists I mentioned.  I really thought the music soundtrack to this movie was great too.  All in all a terrific movie with much to recommend it.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  It starts simple enough that I don't have to give a lot of details.  A high school soccer star attracts a ardent admirer (some would say stocker).  But this young man also has a very beautiful and popular female friend who is trying really hard to be more than just a friend. The popular girl becomes an obvious rival and obstruction to the admirer from afar.  Further complicating the situation is a hot high school teacher who also has a thing for the young soccer star and the audience is not entirely sure whether he will ignore her inappropriate attention.  Things get out of hand when someone mysteriously begins to dismantle the lives of all the women with any connection to him.

Go into this movie with a realization that it won't be perfect and you may like it a lot.  You might want to rent it first.",1368057600,8,3086,4.500900900900901

5392306,4,B00A7F0LDY,"What might have been yet another low-rent teenager-gone-berserk chiller turns out instead to have been created with considerable skill in the writing, acting, cinematography, and direction.  The story also has a topical ""sexting"" angle, as it includes an embarrassing photo sent around maliciously to everyone in the school - an issue that has been much in the news lately.  Both the story and the actor's characterizations show some real depth.  I was especially impressed by the work of Lucas Till (of whom the director said ""the camera loves him"") and Crystal Reed. Director Malik Bader makes the story flow fluidly and seamlessly, creating an atmosphere of foreboding and claustrophobia throughout.  Best of all, the film's cinematographer shot the movie with the Red One camera (I think it is the camera I spotted in the ""Making of..."" documentary), which makes for flawless, detailed, deep, and beautiful pictures.  It looks splendid on Blu-ray.  I shall be on the lookout for the next work from these talented folks.",1366934400,,1023,5.16969696969697

Since they never show the perpetrator's face when any of the violent stuff happens it's pretty clear that there's going to be a twist--but it ends up working anyway.

If this movie would have been released to the theaters, I think it would have done very well just by word of mouth. It was presented very well for a low budget movie an also had solid acting. I have seen films featuring Lucas Till and have been impressed with the way he delivers his characters. I think he is someone who is going to have very good career with movies. I don't want to give anything away from the film, so I will leave my review at this.",1366070400,3,620,4.175
5392310,3,B00A7F0LDY,"Scott had it all until a sports injury crippled him during senior year. Now, he has to balance rehabilitation with friends, schoolwork, and a mysterious new crush, whose obsession with him threatens to destroy everything! From the very beginning, CRUSH plays into the same tired old cliches that frequent the thriller genre, first by introducing us to a group of well-groomed but utterly predictable teen stereotypes who make few attempts to gain our support. Lucas Till takes on the role of the pretty boy athlete against Crystal Reed's oddball loner, whose strange behavior leaves no room for ambiguity in the first and second acts. Right when it seems that everything has been figured out, however, writer Sonny Mallhi and director Malik Bader throw us for an unexpected loop that few will see coming. Some may say that the twist ending is a cheap cop out with insufficient clues, but at least it makes for a nice surprise. Although it is lacking in many regards, CRUSH travels at a brisk pace and offers a decent enough cast to carry the audience through to completion.
