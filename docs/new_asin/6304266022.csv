818205,2,6304266022,"Alright, this is an event that starts out really well but then ventures it's way down to ...-ville. The top three matches were Mysterio vs. Malenko, which was an action-packed, high energy affair with innovative moves and great submissions from Malenko. Next is DDP vs. Eddie Guerrero, which was an entertaining match, even though the finish was quite anti-climatic. The third best match of the night Syxx vs. Jericho, which was watchable, but you can tell that they are still somewhat inexperinced, and they later put on much better matches. The rest of the event was pretty poor, and I was disappointed because on the back of the box it advertises a Liger vs. Ultimo Dragon match, which is nowhere to be found. The main event is god awful, with so much stalling that you can fast forward through the first several minutes and not miss a second of the action. Do not get this event, as there are much better tapes you can get from 96 WCW.",1014508800,4,939,4.595238095238095

Good luck because when the WWE network launches in a few weeks. ALL, yes ALL WCW, WWF/WWE, and ECW pay-per-views will be accessible for $9.99/month.

Lets see....hmmm do I wanna buy a tape or a disc for $300,$400 or more and then wait for several weeks for it to arrive at my mailbox or would i rather pay $9.99 a MONTH to get those same pay-per-views right at my fingertips instantly!

7865988,3,6304266022,"The Curiserweight title match between Dean Malenko & Rey Mysterio Jr. was a strong high-flying show-stealing bout even if it was a bit slow. The Battle for the Ring match between DDP & Eddie Guerrero was so-so at best but still not good. The Jeff Jarrett-Giant match was a typical David-and-Goliath battle but more boring. The Syxx-Chris Jericho match was really solid for what it was. The Arn Anderson-Lex Luger match stinks in terms of wrestling,storytelling & everything else in between. The tag team match between The Faces of Fear against the team of Steve McMicheal & Chris Beniot was pretty good despite the flawed finish. The World Tag Team title match between The Outsiders & Harlem Heat was a boring pile of trash. The World title match between Hulk Hogan & Randy Savage was awful.

7865991,4,6304266022,"Thanks to the wonderful source of the internet, I was able to relive one of my favorite WCW events of all time. This was during the time that the nWo angle was really picking up & was at it's best since it was more like a hostile takeover instead of it being just another stable with one to many members like how it would get very soon after this. With that being said, another positive fact about this event was that all of the matches here had proper build-up instead of just random fillers that tend to happen during the nWo era of WCW.

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Rey Mysterio vs Dean Malenko. These two had been feuding for a while to the point where Malenko stole Rey's mask. This was a great opener as we all know that the WCW cruiserweights are the best way to get the show started off on a good note. Unlike their previous encounters, this was more of an aggressive style added to the great wrestling from Malenko & the usual but fun high-flying action from Mysterio.

Diamond Dallas Page vs Eddie Guerrero. This whole storyline was all about the Battlebowl ring which was actually kinda funny for it's time. Besides that, this was a good match as both men worked well together despite their unique styles but the real highlight of this match was the fact that DDP was being cheered despite him being the heel in this rivalry.

The Giant (nWo) vs Jeff Jarrett (WCW). The first match of the WCW/nWo feud as the issue here was that Ric Flair (who was the United States Champion) was going to be in Jarrett's corner while Giant actually stole the belt from Flair since Flair was injured. This match wasn't much as Giant dominated the majority of the match with Jarrett getting a shot here & there but Flair was the main attention here with his behavior to the point that he got involved in the match.

Chris Jericho (WCW) vs Syxx (nWo). The second battle within this feud where the main story being told here was to start the rivalry between Jericho & corrupt referee Nick Patrick as that became a factor during this match. Anyways, this was still a good match as both men worked well together.

Lex Luger vs Arn Anderson. This feud heated up at Fall Brawl the month prior where Luger lost the fall to the nWo during War Games to the point where Anderson called Luger a quitter. Another good match here & one of Luger's better performances throughout his career as he added a much more aggressive approach than he has in the past to the point where he even used a chair to wear out Arn's back & did the torture rack but refused to let go of the hold in order to injure him.

Chris Benoit & Steve McMichael vs The Faces of Fear. Benoit was the workhorse here in what was a decent match that was only there to continue the rivalry between Benoit & Kevin Sullivan as they fight for Woman.

WCW Tag Team Champions Harlem Heat (WCW) vs The Outsiders (nWo). One moment to notice in this match was that most of the crowd was actually behind Hall & Nash to the point where there was a ""Razor"" chant. Good tag team match here as not only both teams worked well together but this was the best showing that Hall & Nash had as a team as they were really clicking here with Booker T & Stevie Ray. The ending had Col. Parker handing his cane over to Nash for him to use it to win the titles for the first time in WCW.

WCW Champion Hollywood Hulk Hogan (nWo) vs Randy Savage (WCW). Other than the fact that both men switched roles, the storyline here was similar to their WrestleMania V match along with Miss Elizabeth being in the middle again. The start of the match had some comedy as Hogan was trying to wrestle with his toupee & glasses on while Savage was just ready to pounce on him like an animal. Anyways, this was one of Hogan's best matches in his WCW career as Savage was usually capable of bringing out the best in Hogan. The ending had Nick Patrick screwing Savage out of the title & Ted Dibiase & The Giant interfering that lead to Giant chokeslamming Savage on the floor to allow Hogan to get the heel victory.

After the match, Giant woke Hogan up with a bucket of ice water when out of nowhere, Rowdy Roddy Piper made his WCW debut to have a confrontation with Hogan that was the beginning of the build-up towards their Starrcade match.

In the end, this was one of those events where WCW got it right & stuck to the business of showcasing great wrestling while either pushing new or ending storylines so this is an event that I highly recommend to check out as I think it was the best one from the nWo era.",1255305600,,4517,4.3349112426035505

7865993,4,6304266022,"Another VHS I found in an old box.  This happened back when the nWo was still a fresh concept & at it's strongest because this was when WCW still acted like it was an ""hostile takeover"" instead of it just being a stable in WCW...to the point to where Ted Dibiase did the nWo interviews & they had their own entrance way through the crowd.  I think this honestly was the peak of the nWo in WCW as it started to get boring after this & overloaded after this.  Anyways, this was 1 of 2 of my favorite WCW (not NWA) PPV's of all time because here, all the matches had a story behind it with real buildup instead of the usual ""just throw some guys on the card to stall time"" formula they did alot during the nWo era in WCW.  Alot of the matches ended fueds & set up new storylines as well.  Again, this was one of the best periods in the history of WCW.

Cruiserweight Champion Rey Mysterio vs. Dean Malenko - This was my favorite match from their series of matches in WCW & one of the greatest crusierweight matches in WCW.  They were fast paced & very intense.  Hopefully, WWE will release this on the next Rey Mysterio DVD.

Eddie Guerrero vs. DDP - Despite the funny storyline (they were fighting over a ring), this was actually a good matchup as they're styles matched up pretty well together.  If you watch the crowds reaction to DDP, you'll see why his babyface turn started the next night.

Jeff Jarrett w/Ric Flair [WCW] vs. Giant [nWo] - The buildup here was between Flair (who was the U.S. Champion for some reason) & Giant but Flair got injured so Jarrett took his place (setting up his storyline involving the Horsemen as well).  The match itself was nothing special as Flair's antics on the outside the ring overshadowed the match.  Flair ended up saving Jarrett in the end leading to Giant winning by DQ.

Chris Jericho [WCW] vs. Syxx [nWo] - This match was good but the point here was to start up the Jericho/referee Nick Patrick fued that would go on for the next month.

Lex Luger vs. Arn Anderson - The storyline here was Anderson challenging Luger's dedication after Lex lost War Games the previous month; while Luger wanted to prove that he wasn't a quitter.  The goal here was to give Luger a more aggressive edge and they did that as Luger was merciless against Arn's back by hitting it repeatively with a chair & not letting go of the torture rack after the match was over.  The match itself was good as it was Arn Anderson's last PPV match.

Chris Benoit & Steve McMichael vs. Faces Of Fear - This match was just a background to further the fued between Chris Benoit & Kevin Sullivan over Woman.  The match itself was nothing special but watchable.

WCW Tag Team Champions Harlem Heat [WCW] vs. Outsiders [nWo] - This was the only time I can recall these teams facing each other & it was real good as both teams resemble each other real well.  Good tag team match between these two but the ending happened when Col. Parker handed over his cane to Nash who ended up using it to win the titles.  This would also lead up to the Sister Sherri/Col. Parker fued for the next month as well.

WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan [nWo] vs. Randy Savage [WCW] - The way this match was set up was similar to their WrestleMania V match with Hogan & Savage switching roles & you didn't know who's side Elizabeth was on.  There is some comedic stalling at first because Hogan tried to wrestle the match with a toupee & glasses on while Savage just wanted to kill him.  Once they got past that, this was one of Hogan's best WCW matches (and lets be honest, he didn't have alot of them).  As with all of Hogan's matches while being a heel, he had help to win the match in the end as Nick Patrick cheated Savage out of a winning 3 count followed by Giant coming out & chokeslamming Savage for the win.

Afterwards, Hogan (who was knocked out) had to be awaken by having cold water thrown on him before Rowdy Roddy Piper made his WCW debut & had a verbal confrontation with Hogan starting their fued.

In the end, this event did what a major PPV event like this was suppost to do.  Delievered good matches, all the matches either ended current storylines or set up new ones.  Either way, this was one of the best overall PPV's from WCW during the time period of the nWo so I would recommending checking this out if you could.",1172534400,,4320,4.35705368289638
