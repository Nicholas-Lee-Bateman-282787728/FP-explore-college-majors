7916017,1,B00002NDMB,Not too many people know how BunnyYeager took advantage of Bettie Page. She was certainly no friend to her. She made a lot of money off Bettie Page and paid her no royalties.,1487721600,,174,4.303030303030303
7916018,2,B00002NDMB,"It is 100 girls and it is all done in a span of about 40 minutes. We get a few black and white pictures, a topless photo and a 20 second biography read by Bunny and on to the next girl. There is some colored background film. The girls are full figured and mostly from the Miami area.

It was what I expected except it was too short for my dollars.",1460505600,,347,3.887323943661972
7916019,5,B00002NDMB,enjoyed Bunny's work the first time.,1404777600,,36,5.166666666666667
7916020,2,B00002NDMB,"Pin ups from the fifties in black and white. Merely interesting as an objectification of women in its time, but hardly worth perusing for inviting pix of the female form.",1386720000,,170,4.7
7916021,2,B00002NDMB,This movie is like someone just shot a video of the book with live action film added in. You will be disappointed!,1370995200,2,114,4.2272727272727275
7916022,5,B00002NDMB,"This is more of a look into Bunny Yeager's world(But in know means is a biography about Yeager) as she recalls her models, most of them from her book and really its like a making of although there is very little about the process of how the book was made. there are some parts that look as though they are actual footage from her old photo shoots and some (well i would have to agree with others) reenactments of how the shoots came about but all and all its a great film if you are into this sort of thing!",1283558400,2,507,4.08
7916023,3,B00002NDMB,"If you're looking for a biography of Bunny Yeager, this is not it.  I would describe this DVD as ""footage of someone looking at the BOOK of the same title--literally flipping the pages and panning the photos within the book--spliced in are some snippets of footage which might have been taken from actual photo shoots but FEEL more like re-enactments""  Bunny mentions all (or nearly all) of the models in the book and one or two sentences about how the models' attitudes and experience level worked for her--like how she discovered them or their physical attributes ""____had blonde hair and crystal blue eyes and a figure perfect for lingerie modeling.""  Barely any information is shared of any real substance.  I wanted a backstory or grit or more of Bunny's experience as a woman photographer.  There was none of that.  I teach photography and was looking for something more historical about this genre, I'd appreciate some other recommendations.",1167523200,13,948,5.006369426751593
7916024,3,B00002NDMB,"Bunny Yeager was a one-time ""Playboy"" model who ended up making more of a contribution behind the camera during the Golden Age of Pin-Up Girls.  Yes, that is Bunny with the famous Betty Page, Queen of the Pin-Ups, on the cover (Bunny is on the left, Betty on the right, for those of you who got lost somewhere between Betty Grable and Marilyn Monroe).  This DVD is basically an interactive pictorial put together by Yeager, who offers commentary accompanying photographs and short films of the girls she photographed during the 1950's and 1960's.  Of course most of the photographs are in black and white, but there are color shots as well.  If you are a collector of Betty Page photographs, or those of her less successful counterparts, you will find this of passing interest.  Equal parts insight and titillation.",1008979200,,815,4.83453237410072
7916025,3,B00002NDMB,"This was a bit dissapointing -not all that much of Betty Page, in this one -still pretty darn kinky, I wasn't allowed to watch this by my girlfriend, even though my queen is Betty, and Betty alone -hope she'll realize that,  someday. nice flick, buy it for a nice slow afternoon.",946771200,3,279,4.470588235294118
