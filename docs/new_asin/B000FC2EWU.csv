2560265,4,B000FC2EWU,"Beautifully sad love story, a moving story of love overcoming even death.  A great ghost story for a broken heart.  Nice cinematics, good soundtrack, and the story of a girl who was reborn for her once rockstar boyfriend only to find the boyfriend died and was trapped in what could be called purgatory, makes for a unique twist to a not all common theme.  Mizuki's character is one any girl who's had her heart broken can relate to.  I only give this movie four stars though, because I think it was mistagged.  I don't think it belongs in a horror section.",1205366400,,557,4.475247524752476
2560266,4,B000FC2EWU,This is a good movie. If you only want to see Hyde then you will be upset. He is not in the movie to much but when he is he is great. The story mainly flows two high school students and the lead girl's boyfriend as they try to help her solve a mystery. I don't want to give to much away but if you are into ghost stories and the super natural then this is a movie for you.,1194307200,3,372,3.6625
2560267,5,B000FC2EWU,"My assumption is that we've all seen this base on the fact that Hyde's in it (perhaps not, of course).  While his is quite good, he's not the star.  It's more of an ensemble piece, and everyone does a great job.  The fact that it's a first rate ghost story, with Shinto/Buddhist overtones is a plus!  Well worth the time!

Highest rating!",1193788800,,338,4.387096774193548
2560268,5,B000FC2EWU,"I'm not sure how a reviewer figures this is anything like Harry Potter.  I suppose both are fantasy.

The souls of two young women separated by 19 years and exact phases of the moon, plus some personal items, become locked together in an abandoned mansion, one after death, one after an accident that knocks her into a coma.

A younger schoolgirl finds this apparition, and must resolve the mystery of who she is and where she came from.  She and a classmate must find the lover of the first woman, argue with and convince the boyfriend of the second (Mizuni), and work with this ghost that only one of them can see, who doesn't recall her life on Earth and doesn't believe it existed.  The ending is a fight of life vs afterlife, with a very real death awaiting the real world Mizuni.

My only two criticisms are that the two decade old ""indie"" band sounds very contemporary pop, and the denouement is a little long.  But the acting is first rate, the camera work striking and gorgeous and the plot well-developed, believable and not overplayed.  I caught it at a fair by accident, and my daughter and I sat watching until 1 am.  Very good, very classy, and a wonderful tragedy with a warm resolution.",1183680000,4,1202,4.527777777777778
2560269,5,B000FC2EWU,"i bought this movie 5 days ago and watched it last night, now you have to be good at reading subtitles but i belive they should keep this stuff natural and not english dubb everything they produce so if you like live action japanese flix as well as anime, i suggest this movie.",1169078400,,277,4.245283018867925
2560270,5,B000FC2EWU,"Hideto Takarai, or more popularly known as HYDE, doesn't appear as much as his fans would like him to in this movie, but when he does, his acting is nearly perfect! The character of Adam suits him well. Although he's better known for his music, HYDE proves he can do acting well too.

I recommend the movie ""Moon Child"" if you like this one. Although, in my opinion, it's not as good as ""Kagen no Tsuki ~Last Quarter~"", it's a great movie for HYDE fans, as well as Gackt fans.

Whatever you do, buy this movie, and you won't be disappointed. HYDE fan or not, this is a must-see.",1167264000,2,578,4.293577981651376
2560271,5,B000FC2EWU,"I was attracted to Last Quarter for its resemblance, on the DVD cover, to quality J-Horror movies.  It turned out, however, to be a tear-jerking, stunningly beautiful supernatural love story, with a haunting soundtrack.  The visuals ranged from ordinary street scenes in metropolitan Japan to computer graphic altered state sequences in such a way that it became obvious that the film was making a comment on the emotional condition of contemporary Japanese youth.  It is full of hope and light.  The essence of this vision is unforgettably expressed in the smiles and tears of Chiaki Kuriyama.  She plays a 19-year-old girl who, because of devastating emotional shocks in her own life, is vulnerable to exploitation by a couple of dead lovers attempting to reincarnate. Several highly emotional scenes in the film will, I believe, go down as classic scenes in cinema.  Chiaki carries everything off with absolute sensitivity. I think she will soon establish a reputation as the most unique romantic lead since Ingrid Bergman.  I suppose, however, that because her facial structure allows her to display a rather unprepossessing frown, as in Kill Bill and on the cover of i-D Magazine, she is also being thought of as a monstrously tough chick.  This is not her. If you want to see the real Chiaki, watch Last Quarter.",1158796800,13,1318,5.013761467889908
2560272,5,B000FC2EWU,"Last Quarter stars Hyde (japanese rock star) and Chiaki Kuriyama best known in the states for her role as Gogo in Kill Bill.

It is a beautifully filmed story. This is not an action movie. Everyone is cast very well. Also, Last Quarter is based of a manga of the same name.

The story is focused around a girl who is unsatisfied with her life. She is drawn to a mansion and finds a musician there called Adam. He is very otherworldly. Because of her discontent she doesn't want to leave and soon is unable to. After she is in an accident, her (frequently) ex-boyfriend and two other young people try to help her find her way home. Themes of rebirth and karma are expressed through her relationship with Adam.

This is a movie to watch if you are in the mood for some tears.",1152230400,18,773,4.317241379310345
2560273,5,B000FC2EWU,I bought this so that I have a copy for my daughter to watch. I love this movie! Very tragic and romantic!,1357862400,,106,3.8636363636363638
2560274,4,B000FC2EWU,"Also known as The Last Quarter. This is one of Ai Yazawa's mangas that was made in 1998-1999 and is only 3 volumes long. It is a story about a girl named Mizuki, who doesn't have the greatest family background as her mother committed suicide when she was very young due to the fact that Mizuki's father had cheated on her. Mizuki doesn't really like her father and her step-mother eventhough her step-mother tries to be nice to her all the time.

On Mizuki's 19th birthday, she is having a great time until she finds out that her boyfriend is cheating on her with her bestfriend. She runs away from the party only to find that somewhere she can hear a beautiful song. She follows it and there she finds a musician named Adam, who is 20 years old. He said he was from England and is just visiting Japan for a couple of weeks. When Mizuki decided to leave, shes surprised to find that Adam asks her to stay.

As the days go on, Mizuki decides that she is in love with Adam. She withdraws from her private life i.e. she stops going to school and going to her part time job. When Adam invites her to live at his house, she stops going home. One day, she comes home and Adam and his belongings have dissapeared from the house. All of a sudden her cell phone rings. It was Adam. Mizuki is a bit surprised he had her cell phone number since she never gave it out to him. He apologizes for leaving and tells her he would take her with him and all she had to do was meet him at a junction. She, then, runs home and packs all her belongings and runs to meet him at the junction. When she gets there, Adam is standing across the street and eventhough its a red light, she decided to run to Adam.

*May contain a possible spoiler ahead*

While this was going on, her ex boyfriend was walking the streets with his friend. He was trying to look for Mizuki whom he could not locate for the past few days. He wanted to apologize to her for what he had done. He saw her running across the street about to be hit by a truck. He runs to her...but it was too late. She gets hit by the car (or truck?) and all of a sudden, Adam ""dissapears"".

*SPOILERS ENDED*

This story is about love, lost souls, purgatory, waiting souls and reincarnation.

I never read the manga but I really am going to try to find it online (since it was never translated to English). I think the movie definitely had the potential to be more interesting than it was...that's why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I want to read the manga because I love Ai Yazawa and I think she is a great mangaka so the manga must've been a 100 times better.",1357171200,,2599,4.175648702594811
2560275,5,B000FC2EWU,"I love Ai Yazawa's work and I admire the stories she creates. I was scared that I would not like the movie, but I loved the manga so much I chanced it. and I do not regret it. It was a great movie.",1330214400,,197,3.604651162790698
2560276,5,B000FC2EWU,"The fact that L'arc~en~ciel's Hyde is in it made it all the more desirable.  Lots of mystery, being reborn and the soundtrack will have you watching it again and again.",1324425600,,168,4.6
2560277,5,B000FC2EWU,I had watched this movie without subtitles few years ago and this time with the translation I finally understood some parts of it. Absolutely good movie.,1315785600,,153,4.923076923076923
2560278,5,B000FC2EWU,"Someone on Youtube recommended this movie to me after seeing a comment I left on Moon Child. These days I'm watching & listening to more Japanese pop culture than American (because let's face it, America's pop culture has pretty much been done & redone) & when I mentioned that, they sent me the link to Last Quarter. I watched it & right around the end of the movie, I was crying my eyes out. I've seen it so many times now, I hardly even need the subtitles anymore! This movie is great for watching with the family, friends, or your significant other.",1302825600,,553,4.431372549019608
2560279,5,B000FC2EWU,"This movie is very beautiful, a bit bittersweet, but still, very beautiful. I fully recommend it. I specially recommend it for those who are fans of either Ai Yazawa, or Hyde.",1271203200,,175,4.67741935483871
2560280,5,B000FC2EWU,"Very nice product, sent in excellent time, would possibly buy from this person in the future.",1246233600,,93,4.875
2560281,5,B000FC2EWU,"Admittedly, the only reason I wanted to see this movie in the beginning is because of Hyde since I'm a huge fan of his. But then I read the manga it's based off of (Kagen no Tsuki) and I was completely hooked on the story. It was the first manga I've read that made me cry. And while there are a lot of differences between the manga and the movie (like characters being removed, certain events happening sooner and changing Adam from a blonde haired, blue eyed British rock star to a half Japanese half British rock star) but it still was the same basic story and it was still just as good. The movie was just as beautifully told as the manga, and the actors were all really good. Hyde wasn't in it as much as I would have liked, but after reading the manga, I expected this. Still, it's now one of my favorite movies. I'm not going to write what it's about, because well, there are already reviews that do that, but if you love a tragic love story, this is a must see. I would also recommend reading the manga if you can, because it's more in depth.",1240790400,9,1050,4.202970297029703
2560282,5,B000FC2EWU,"This is actually a very sad love story sweetly sold. I saw it many times and I still feel the sadness, the desperate feelings of not being able to be with the one you love, and the sweetness of being loved even in another life...",1231891200,,229,4.111111111111111

8120537,5,B000FC2EWU,This movie was absolutely perfect in every way the story was great the characters were amazing and Hyde was perfect in this film and the ending had a beautiful ending that caught me off guard and had me crying I would recommend this film to everyone!,1486080000,,250,4.456521739130435
8120538,5,B000FC2EWU,"i enjoyed the movie itself, the reviews are right its a little tear jerker. I loved the info cards about other shows, it was nice seeing whats up in anime land ( its come to eat more of my soul) All in all good experience shopping.",1485907200,,231,4.043478260869565
8120539,5,B000FC2EWU,"I watched this online about a week or so ago and decided I needed a copy. I love this film a lot, I ended up reading the manga after and it made me notice a few things I had missed while watching the first time. I watched this because of HYDE  mainly and I am so glad I did! If you get a chance to view this movie do it. Lastly I am addicted to ""The Cape of Storms"" by HYDE it is so beautiful, I even bought HYDE's album Roentgen specifically because it has that song on it! I also have Moon Child which stars HYDE and Gackt and is an amazing movie!",1420070400,,549,3.8157894736842106
8120540,4,B000FC2EWU,"As a Hyde fan I had to have this. I loved it! The story was dark and full of symbolism. If you can follow metaphoric stories like this one, you'd find it a gem as I have. Others tend to ""not get it""",1418342400,,198,3.627906976744186
8120541,5,B000FC2EWU,"I have nothing to say except you will not regret this purchase! I even bought one for my best friend. It will make you feel so many emotions and have some really deep thoughts about love, life and what happens to us after we die.",1399248000,,229,4.111111111111111

8120543,5,B000FC2EWU,"Wonderful story line. Someone suggested I see this and I got it used for a super good price. I had low expectations for it due to the fact I am not big on subtitled foreign films. I was, however, pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed it and the subtitles were easy to read and keep up with the movie itself. Nice little gem to add to my collection.",1393459200,,349,4.223880597014926

8120545,5,B000FC2EWU,"Such a great film! I must check out HYDE's work. But nevertheless I've taken a personal interest in Chiaki Kuriyama, ever since I saw her portray herself as  Takako Chigusa in Kinji Fukasaku's film Battle Royale. and also Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol 1. ""First Quarter"" was great from begging to end. There was never a dull moment,I truly enjoyed this movie.",1359504000,,355,4.819672131147541
