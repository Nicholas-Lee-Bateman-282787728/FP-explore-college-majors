8189751,5,B000P7V5MK,"I have the 3 DVDs that Denise has produced and they are great workouts.  She is very personable, with a thorough knowledge of fitness.  The location where these DVDs were filmed is stunning and it makes up for such an enjoyable workout.  She uses an array of fitness equipment, from physio ball, resistance tubes, free weights to foam roller and there is something for everybody.  There is no music, which I wish she would have included, but these DVDs are so worth it.  Because these were produced in 2006, they are not HD quality, but still pretty good and widescreen format. She also sells the DVDs on her website.",1464307200,,617,4.623853211009174
8189752,5,B000P7V5MK,"The exercises in this DVD are geared towards rehabbing injuries, but they are also excellent for just working the muscles. Denise Beatty, the instructor, is a Canadian exercise physiologist so she is familiar with which muscles are being worked; she does not dumb down the terminology, but does not patronize us either. She has a very friendly demeanor, and the background setting of the Canadian Rockies adds to the viewing enjoyment. I liked that she emphasized regaining strength rather than ""getting sexy,"" which many of my other DVDs repeat to the point where it is annoying. Although this DVD is called Fitness Fix beginner, but I think it could grow with anyone, as there are two women working out, and one usually shows a more difficult version of the move. Highly recommended!",1280793600,2,785,4.954545454545454
8189753,5,B000P7V5MK,"This DVD has a lot of useful content and is chaptered so that you can get to just the bits you want.

I purchased this DVD to address a lower back complaint and the exercises are all well explained and very sound. I recognise some of the exercises from Physio & Pilates and feel very safe performing the exercises. There is always a modified version to follow. I have only been using this for a couple of weeks so I have yet to see an improvement in my lower back, but already my flexibility has improved.

The instructor is easy to follow and very pleasant, making sure to explain things carefully and the outdoor setting is stunning.",1221350400,3,635,4.418803418803419
8189754,5,B000P7V5MK,"This is a very good beginner DVD with plenty of modifications to make the exercises either easier or harder.  As an instructor Denise Beatty is EXCELLENT.  I found her to be very personable, motivating and easy to understand.  I wish she would come out with a DVD that is just stretches and foam roller work.",1190160000,5,308,4.5636363636363635
8189755,5,B000P7V5MK,"In her Fitness Fix series, Denise Beatty, an exercise physiologist, coach, and personal trainer, has put together excellent functional exercises, all of which have been approved by physicians, chiropractors, and physical therapists for safety.  The Beginner DVD is intended for those who are not very active or who or recovering from injury/illness; it is also designed for those with back, knee, hip, or shoulder problems.  The overall focus is on balance, functional strength, and flexibility.

This DVD utilizes a wide variety of equipment, including a stability ball, a small ball, dumbbells, tubing, a balance disk, and a foam roller.  However, Denise and her background exerciser, Kim, always show different options; Denise often uses no equipment, whereas Kim displays more advanced version of the moves.  The Main Menu of the DVD contains the following four options:  Introduction (a brief overview by Denise), the Fitness Fix (links to the exercises), Equipment (overview of all equipment used), and Credits.

The Beginner menu breaks down the exercises into the following two sub-menus:

Exercises
*Balance Warmup Fix - 11 min
*Upper Body Fix - 23 min
*Lower Body Fix - 22 min
*Core Fix - 22 min
*40 Minute Fix

Cool Down
*Upper Body Flexibility - 4 min
*Lower Body Flexibility - 6 min
*Foam Roller Massage - 15 min

The Balance Warm-Up begins with a review of six Bs of posture (Base of skull, Breastbone, shoulder Blades, Belly button in, Bottoms up, Breathe) and then moves into some simple balance work such as balance on one foot, squats with knee lift, and arm circles on one leg.  Both the upper and the lower body portions contain traditional exercises (eg, bicep curls, triceps kick-backs, squats, lunges), but these moves are made more functional by the addition of a balance element (either the stability ball or balance disk) as well as a strong core emphasis.  The core segment includes stability ball and plank work.  The 40 Minute Fix contains select exercises from the upper body, lower body, and core portions with no warm-up or cool-down.

The Cool Down segments, consisting of flexibility work, are the same on all three DVDs.  The Upper Body Flexibility is performed seated on the stability ball and thoroughly stretches all of the major muscle groups.  The Lower Body Flexibility also uses the stability ball; in addition to standard muscle group stretches, it contains moves that uniquely target areas such as the groin, inner thighs, and IT band.  Finally, in the Foam Roller Massage segment, Denise leads you through a deep tissue massage for the entire body.

There is no music during this workout--rather, it is more like a one-on-one personal training session with Denise.  Her enthusiasm for this work shines throughout the DVD, and she is extremely encouraging and motivating.  She and Kim are exercising outdoors against a beautiful lakeside Canadian backdrop with mountains in the distance.  Overall, this is an incredibly versatile, extremely well thought out DVD that provides endless options for beginning and recovering exercisers--highly recommended!",1185148800,17,3096,5.189134808853119
