Super couple and down-to-earth. The video brings back the ones they showed but also the unique side of those volcanologists so driven by the adventure it was hard to not go with them. This is more a memorial of them and their passion. Very biased so I recommend everyone buy this product!",1415232000,,436,4.75

I would recommend this to my mother and anyone who is a true Nature lover.",1366502400,,187,3.4761904761904763
7874926,3,6304610181,"The video footage on this DVD is fascinating, but the quality of the video conversion (or original recording?) is poor, and the movies seem to have been edited choppily from perhaps a much longer film. Worth watching though, as the video footage is unique.",1349654400,,256,4.840909090909091
7874927,5,6304610181,"The Krafft's pair of volcano documentaries are a must-have for volcano enthusiasts.  The video is fantastic and the audio hasn't been wholy substituted with music or commentary - it's totally cool to actually get the hear the eruptions as well as see them.  The second documentary is the best in terms of continuity and contains fabulous footage of pillow basalt formation underwater at Runion Island.
My only disappointment with these documentaries is that they are somewhat dated in terms of commentary and the editing is rather abrupt - leaving you wondering about certain volcanoes and outcomes.  Some pieces of the best footage are repeated a few times within the first documentary as well.  This material begs for a fresh commentary and editing - this would create a superb film out of the excellent original.",1086393600,5,815,5.059701492537314
