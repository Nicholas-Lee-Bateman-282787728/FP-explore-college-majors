8660331,4,B00KNVF8CG,"""A Woman in Grey"" from Serico Pictures Corporation, directed by James Vincent, was released in 1920.  It is one of the few surviving serials intended for adult audiences and one of the last before they became primarily juvenile entertainment.  It remains a fascinating serial, though video editions are from an edition with significant cuts, which may be all that still exists.

The plot is fairly complex.  Wilfred Amory (John Heenan), retired State's Attorney, has purchased the house in which he was born, believing he will find proof in it that his father did not die poor.  The house had been unoccupied since the housekeeper, who had inherited the property, was murdered.  Her foster daughter, Florence Haynes, was convicted of the crime, but died in prison, and Mary Edwards, the housekeeper's servant who testified against Florence, has disappeared.  Amory's secretary, Tom Thurston (Henry G. Sell) goes to inspect the house and finds someone has wound and set the Grandfather clock, which only the housekeeper and the servant knew how to do.  He also finds a woman, Ruth Hope (Arline Pretty) claiming she too is ""inspecting"" and admits that she wound the clock.  She also knows about the Amory family code, which is believed to be the key to the fortune left by Wilfred Amory's father.  But Ruth Hope isn't the only person looking for the code; J. Haviland Hunter (Fred Jones), a ""man of mystery"" will use any means to get the papers.

Thurston, of course, falls in love with Ruth Hope, and saves her from many perils, though I really like that he gets the stuffing knocked out of him whenever he gets into a fight with J. Haviland Hunter.  Despite the ""independent"" production, this is a well-made film with an excellent cast.  It has a fair amount of ""silent movie acting,"" plenty of secret panels and remarkable escapes from certain death, yet the story remains mostly believable and holds interest through the fifteen chapters.

The three video releases I know of this serial all appear to be from Blackhawk's film edition.  Blackhawk, or its successor NTA, operating under the ""Republic"" banner, issued it on VHS in the late 1980s.  The introduction from the film noted that:

>  The original serial included many scenes later repeated as
>  flashbacks, as well as lengthy drawing-room scenes laden
>  with titles.  To quicken the pace and reduce the tedium of
 > non-action scenes, Blackhawk's version of A Woman in Grey
 > has been skilfully edited, but you won't miss a thread of
 > any subplot, for the essence of every chapter has been
 > faithfully retained.

That probably made sense when the serial was issued on film, owing to the cost of the medium.  There is also some question regarding correct film speed, but in any case Blackhawk's episodes run only about twelve and a half minutes each, suggesting quite a bit of the original is missing.  Blackhawk's VHS tape had some flicker and murkiness, doubtless from the source print, but otherwise adequate image quality for its time, and a splendid, energetic piano accompaniment, probably by William Perry, though there is no credit for it on the video.

The two DVD editions are from the same edit as Blackhawk's VHS.  Comparing versions is a little frustrating, since each has parts that look better than the others.  Of these three, Alpha's (ASIN: B00KNVF8CG) is generally sharper and shows more detail than either Grapevine's DVD or the Blackhawk VHS, though as noted by Ron Wise in his review, some of it looks washed out, and for those parts the other editions are slightly preferable.  Episodes run about twelve and a half minutes each, like those on Blackhawk's VHS tape.  Framing cuts a bit more off the edges than the other editions, but most of the text in the credits and titles remains on-screen.  Alpha adds their logo up to the ""Synopsis of Preceding Episodes"" and uses a still frame for some titles, such as the cast list for Episode Three, usually for no apparent reason.  And since all fifteen episodes are crammed onto a single-layer DVD-R some minor digital compression artifacts are present, but would probably be noticed only on a large high-definition display, not recommended with these DVDs.  Still, if image quality was the only consideration, Alpha's would be the best of the editions, by a small margin.  But silent films are not really ""silent"" and the accompaniment provided by Alpha is from scratchy LPs of ""classical"" music, almost randomly dubbed and distracting rather than supportive of the action.

Grapevine's edition (ASIN: B007I6CW1E) is on two single-layer DVD-Rs.  There was a Grapevine release on VHS, and their transfer looks like it made with VHS expectations in mind.  Sharpness is no better than Blackhawk's VHS tape.  Some scenes are so dark that it's hard to tell what's going on, and this also seems to increase the flicker.  However, while the edit is the same, the episodes run about 20% longer, 15 minutes each, yet the speed of the action does not seem slow.  My guess is that Grapevine got the film speed closer to what it should be.  The framing is at least as good as Blackhawk's, and while the same can't honestly be said of the accompaniment, the old recordings of orchestral ""silent movie music"" are well-matched to the action, if some of the breaks between selections are a bit rough.

This is a serial that is worthy of a proper transfer from an uncut print, if one still exists.  Until a miracle like that happens, either DVD illustrates the serial's strengths.  The Alpha DVD is cheap, but I find the decent musical accompaniment track on Grapevine's edition makes it easier to watch, despite the poorer image quality.",1499040000,2,5654,4.872251308900523
8660332,3,B00KNVF8CG,"""A Woman in Grey"" starring the very pretty Arline Pretty (her real name, by the way) is one of the greatest silent serials ever made. Unfortunately, this DVD is not so great.

The visual quality of the entire serial is pretty dismal.  Most of the time the picture is washed out with fuzzy focus. Also, the generic classical music used as background music is barely sufficient, and rarely fits any of the action taking place on the screen.

The positive points are that the DVD cover art is nicely done, and the entire serial seems to be presented here. Considering that most silent serials in their entirety are lost, having ""A Woman in Grey"" in its complete form is a reason for celebration.

This DVD of ""A Woman in Grey"" is watchable, it's just too bad that the picture and music are not better.",1496448000,2,798,4.520833333333333
8660333,5,B00KNVF8CG,"*** First of all, I should clarify that English is not my first language, so I apologize in advance for my grammatical mistakes ***

Well, I must confess that this was a blind purchase and what really made me buy the DVD of ""A Woman in Grey"" was primarily the beautiful cover art with the picture of Arline Pretty on it. I wasn't familiar with Ms. Pretty (who was indeed stunning, more than just ""pretty"" actually! But that was her real name, according to what I've read) work nor even silent serials, therefore I wanted to give it a try. I've always heard of ""The Perils of Pauline"", ""Fantomas"" and such, but since all of those are currently more expensive, I decided to start by ""A Woman in Grey"", given that the Alpha DVD is very affordable ($5,98 plus shipping cost).

If you're reading this and/or are a fan of silent serials, it's pretty likely you are already familiar with the plot of this one, so I will mainly refer about the quality of the DVD, which is what I usually want to learn about when I read reviews myself.

Before buying this, my big concern was the print quality, since the series is over 90 years old now, and I tended to think it would look all blurry and dark, consisting mainly of shadows and silhouettes. Well, yesternight I finished watching it, and I can't remember a single scene that was unwatchable. True, it's far from a Kino or Image restoration, but it still is very good and clear, and you can even tell the features and expressions on the actors faces, which is always essential to me, especially when it comes to silent movies. You can also clearly notice the movie sets, landscapes and anything else without much effort.

Even though the running time of the DVD is supposed to be 61 minutes only, this is not true: it contains the full series on one disc, 15 episodes altogether, which makes around 180 minutes, about 12 minutes per episode. As for the score, it's basically pre-recorded classical music, some very well known compositions (just don't ask me which ones, LOL. Not expert at all) that, fortunately, fit the actions quite well most of the time.

My only complaint -a minor one- would be that some intertitles, kind of long, pass by a bit fast, but you can always press the pause button of your control remote, and they're the original ones, which is something good. However, when the characters are reading a letter or message, you get a close-up and the scene stands still for several seconds, so you won't miss a thing.

If you enjoy all the silent movies clichs like I do, then you'll like this series. No woman trapped in train rails, as far as I remember, but still plenty of others. But remember: this was made in 1920, when everything was still brand new. As for the acting, it was surprisingly good by everybody, especially the lead actress. Arlene Pretty was indeed very talented, had a great screen presence and apparently did her own stunts. Such a gorgeous, expressive, enigmatic face she had, especially those big, gorgeous eyes!

Honestly, I'm even less familiar with the rest of the cast, but I liked well enough everyone's performance. It's kind of refreshing when anyone looks the part, especially when the bad ones look and act menacing and even insane!

If you're thinking of buying this, do it! I don't think you'll feel disappointed. After all, the price is very good and you get the complete series for less than $6. Just be reasonable and don't expect a crystal clear print. However, like I already mentioned above, it's very nice and watchable, and it's a true cause for celebration that this series survived in its entirety. It must have been very exciting to watch it back in 1920 and, honestly, it still is. Totally recommended.",1417824000,10,3708,4.624620060790273
