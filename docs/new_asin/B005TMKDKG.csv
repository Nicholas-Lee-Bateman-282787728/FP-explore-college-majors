8486429,5,B005TMKDKG,"This disc features abstract and near-abstract videos by the auteurs at videotics.com, where a number of the more recent Videotics shows can always be viewed. Every track here pulses with color and rapidfire change. Perhaps most accessible is the 2nd cut, an hour and 20 minutes of pulsating colors accmpanied by a free jazz quartet. This imagery was created largely through video feedback, though videotics also uses fractals and other algorithmic processes elsewhere. The other pieces on the two-hour dvd are mostly warpings and meltings of videos shot of various animals [chimps, elephants, sea lions] painting pictures. The title track I find enjoyable on repeated viewings, though perhaps the types of distortions used could vary more; the chimp's strong desire to eat the paint always makes me laugh! This is a disc whose strengths are its uniqueness and originality, and the beauty of some of its imagery.",1335139200,,911,5.204081632653061
