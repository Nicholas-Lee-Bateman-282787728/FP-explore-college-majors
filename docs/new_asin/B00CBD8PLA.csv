5711197,5,B00CBD8PLA,I have looked for this movie for years - it is my favorite Bobby Darin movie. His song Amy - from the soundtrack - is the best. I took a chance and typed in the movie title and found it on Amazon and ordered the DVD immediately.,1398297600,,228,3.872340425531915
5711198,3,B00CBD8PLA,"When I want to order a DVD online I want to know how the digital transfer is, or whether the original aspect ratio of the movie has been preserved. You know the overall quality of the DVD. As for the story,the acting, etc.most of us buyers either fully know about it or at least have a basic idea.

That is why I'm almost always disappointed to read the reviews here, because a great majority of reviewers try to do their Roger Ebert imitation instead of telling us what we would be purchasing in terms of technical quality. So please would someone tell me about the quality of this DVD without getting into all the Ebert stuff?

Thank you.",1389744000,2,640,4.415254237288136
5711199,5,B00CBD8PLA,"Bobby Darin was one in a billion: his talent was immeasurable, and it was enhanced all the more by his charisma. He could sing any genre of music, act with the best of them, and was the greatest nightclub performer America has yet produced. Sinatra and Martin used to go see HIM.  Sammy Davis, Jr. said Darin was the only entertainer he'd never follow on stage. The only thing Darin lacked was health and time.",1385596800,2,410,4.466666666666667
5711200,5,B00CBD8PLA,"I rate this average Western five star because of Bobby Darin. For one thing he wrote and sings the lead song the beautiful ballad, ""Amy."" Secondly, I like his easy acting style as the gun shy sheriff. Most of all, he's one gorgeous bundle of eye candy in his Conferate uniform, and later, cowboy cords.",1384992000,,302,4.509090909090909
5711201,5,B00CBD8PLA,I always wanted a good copy of this movie. It doesn't disappoint. Bobby Darin is the jewel in this film.,1384992000,,104,4.25
5711202,5,B00CBD8PLA,"I saw this western in our hometown's movie theatre when small towns still had a movie theatre.  The late Bobby Darin had begun to develop his acting talent.  He had proven he could sing; he proved he could act, too.  The late Leslie Nielsen played the villain and did a wonderful job in his role.  The song ""Amy"" as sung by Mr. Darin so touched me that I named my only daughter Amy.  I was thrilled to see the film on dvd.  My vhs tape had worn out.  You will enjoy this film, especially if you are a collector of the Western Genre.",1384387200,7,532,4.106796116504855
5711203,5,B00CBD8PLA,I have never seen Bobby Darin in a Western movie.the wife was in impressed with it also. Not bad from being singer to being a cowboy.,1383868800,,133,4.153846153846154
5711204,3,B00CBD8PLA,"Sorry, but I just can't accept Darin ""cleaning"" up Abilene.  It's not unlike putting PeeWee Herman in the role.  That being said, the film is O.K., with Donnely Rhodes as a wonderful bad guy.  Later on, he was an excellent funny character on the TV series ""Soap.""  The DVD is significantly better than the Good Times  VHS tape (recorded at the Slow speed!) from many years ago.  If you want to see Darin acting, I recommend ""Pressure Point"" with Sidney Poitier.",1369958400,,461,4.62962962962963
