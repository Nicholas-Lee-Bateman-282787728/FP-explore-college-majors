190953,1,157252250X,"This has got to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. It took me three days to watch what I thought would be a masterpiece judging by the great reviews. The film is far too long and slow and does not show the beautiful scenes that one would expect. ... as he insists on dragging out each scene for no reason at all.  This is no Nicholas and Alexandra, Mayerling etc and I would strongly advise buying it.  Finally the Italian overdubs with German being howled in the backround by the extras in the film just go to show how badly made this film is.",996364800,3,560,4.128440366972477
190954,5,157252250X,"An absolute perfect film by craftsman Luchino Visconti about the ""Mad"" King of Bavaria, Ludwig the second, played flawlessly by Helmut Berger. We go thru Ludwig's entire reign as King up till the time when he meets the love of his life,Empress Elizabeth (Romy Schneider, who's performances deserved an Oscar nomination, her pressence brings a certain uniqueness to every scene), his associating with Richard Wagner (Trevor Howard), and his angagement to Sophie (Sonia Petrowa). Every scene in this movie is perfectly done. The acting is amazing and superb, the costume designs by Piero Tosi and the production designs by Mario Chiari and Mario Scisci are fantastic and beautiful. The musical score by Schunann, Wagner, and Offenbach complements each and every scene by adding the emotional impact on every scene. The cinematography by Armando Nannuzzi is masterful and dazzling. And of course the directing by Visconti is incredible. He setsup everything in a way only he can. The screenplay by Enrico Mediolo and Visconti is intriguing. I can't think one of bad thing about this film, every second of it is flawless. Even though it's about 4 hours, none of it is wasted. But, I'm afraid due to the lenght of the film, some may avoid seeing it. This is the same fate Bertolucci's ""1900"" suffered. Also, this isn't as widely known as other Visconti films such as ""The Leopard"", ""Death In Venice"" and ""The Innocent"". Which, I can't understand why. This movie, in my opinion, is better than all three movies I just mentioned! It's an embracive,heartfelt, bittersweet movie, that stands as one of the greatest of all time. Every movielover should hurry up and buy this movie. No one will be disappointed with this movie, I can 100% assure it!",977356800,39,1738,4.975945017182131

This historically faithful bio-drama was in English, while the recent release is dubbed Italian with English subtitles.  (Practice your lip-reading and you will find in this edition the lip movement is English.)  I find it difficult to comprehend why this Visconti masterpiece was released with dubbed Italian, and why the editing was so savage.  The most serious omission is the entirely deleted epilogue which reveals that Ludwig's corpse had multiple bullet wounds when it was retrieved from Lake Starnberg.  Why cut these minutes of historic fact ?  This film was conceived as a masterpiece, but now it is turning into a compounded major mystery.

190957,5,157252250X,"After viewing the film Wagner with Richard Burton, I decided to learn a little more about King Ludwig II of Bavaria, and rented Ludwig at my local video store. This film is a masterpiece! Visconti's use of darkness and  shadows added to the already tragic figure of the ""mad king"".  Helmut Berger was  absolutely amazing as Ludwig, the tormented, sad monarch  who found himself more enchanted with the music of Wagner that with the  role he played in history. He longed to be the The Swan King instead.  Unfortunately the video appeared to have been filmed in English, then  dubbed in Italian, then subtitled in English!

190958,5,157252250X,"Here is another reason you shouldn't listen to the film critics.  How can someone have a good knowledge about films (if he really knows SOMETHING about films) not appreciate this fine piece of cinematic art? I saw this  film on television another night.  It was breathtaking! So hauntingly  beautiful!  I love the way it directed the story, so vividly, so gentle.  Although this is a very dark story, and a tragedy, too, you don't feel  being punched violently on the heart, which is a very nice way to tell this  kind of story.  The idea of cinematic art isn't really to bring the shock  and excitement to the world, it's about story telling, about the truth of  humanities. And I think this film did achieve that very goal. It portray  Ludwig's complicated character from various angles. He is a dark character,  his blind passion of music and art drove him into deep despair and his  countury in crisis, but see how heartbroken he was when he saw his illed  brother.  He is not a bad person, just born at the wrong time, wrong place.  The finale was a bit cut short, I felt there should have been something  more.  But I'm telling you, this is one of the finest film I'd ever seen.  Don't worry about the background knowledge, just take your time, see it  with your heart.",944611200,8,1275,4.504385964912281
190959,4,157252250X,"Ludwig is the story of Ludwig II (Helmut Berger), the last King of Bavaria who died under a cloud of mystery. Born in 1845, Ludwig ruled from 1864 to 1886. After ascending the throne when he was 18, he displayed an interest only in opera, constructing elaborate castles, and handsome young men. Obsessed with the music of Richard Wagner (Trevor Howard), Ludwig sponsored the composer, but Wagner betrayed the king by falling in love with his cousin, Elisabeth of Austria (Romy Schneider), a woman with whom the king had a platonic relationship. The brooding king eventually succumbed to madness.

Director Luchino Visconti (The Damned, Death in Venice) combines historical fact with melodrama, emphasizing the excesses of Ludwigs reign   his appreciation of architecture, fondness for sweets, and liaisons with any man who caught his eye. Though the facts of Ludwigs tenure as king are incorporated, it seems as if Visconti is rushing through them in order to get to the good stuff, in this case cinematic spectacle that fans of Downton Abbey would applaud. Costumes, grand staircases, the soundtrack of Wagner and Schumann compositions, horse-drawn royal coaches, and period furniture dress up the movie beautifully, but  at three hours  the film is much too long. It is more a voyeuristic glimpse at a controversial monarch with quirks and eccentricities than a definitive portrait of the king and Bavarias fortunes under his leadership.

The 4-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack offers two viewing options: the full-length theatrical version or as five individual parts. Bonus features include an interview with the screenwriter; a half-hour portrait of actress Silvana Magnano; theatrical trailer; brand new interview with Helmut Berger; and an hour-long documentary of director Luchino Visconti.

190967,3,157252250X,"I rarely post reviews and will keep this brief. The movie itself, particularly in this full theatrical cut (almost 4 hours long) is a beautiful masterpiece about the fascinating ""Mad"" King Ludwig of Bavaria  presented with relative historical accuracy.  Having visited most of his castles and having read biographies about Ludwig and Empress ""Sisi"" Elisabeth, I was eager to view this release.  However, upon my initial viewing, I was taken aback by the dubbing/subtitles presented in this DVD.  Earlier reviewers mention that a common practice of Italian film makers at that time was to film without sound and use voice overs in the language of the intended target audience.  The movie was originally filmed in English (which is easily discerned by watching the lips of the actors).  Previous reviewers say that they viewed the original release in English (probably voice overs, but English nonetheless).  This DVD release has been dubbed in Italian with English subtitles available. I am unsure why the English version was not released on DVD (perhaps it was not the original theatrical cut?).  In any case, reading subtitles robs one from the full experience of watching the film.  And to hear Romy Schneider in a deep, throaty Italian is off-putting.  Given that no other DVD options are available, however, I would still recommend this release, but be aware of what you are purchasing (I was not).",1390521600,8,1402,5.08296943231441

Ludwig did not take the country of Bavaria into bankruptcy by building his castles (as so commonly thought).

Shot on location, the narrative structure wonderfully paces the rule of King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Helmut Berger infuses his portrayal with ambiguity, further heightened by nascent homosexuality: Is he mad or a genius? This idealistic Moon King is not a ruler for a united German republic. Associations with the feminine and embryonic state abound. With twitching hands and shifting eyes, Ludwig's mannerisms alone chart his retreat to a world of fantasy.

However, one wishes this film were in English like the its two predeceesors in the trilogy: ""The Damned"" and ""Death in Venice"". I do not mean to offend any Europeans. But you might be able to appreciate Berger's incredible acting skills better. If you think about it, the two roles are not dissimilar. In ""The Damned"" he gradually descends into a sort of madness. Perhaps it had too much of an ""international cast"".  I own the 2-tape VHS edition at 231 minutes. The DVD edition is 237 minutes. More later.",1279065600,3,660,5.055045871559633

190982,4,157252250X,"""Ludwig"" (1972) is the full version (237 min) of Luchino Visconti's film about the life of King Ludwig II of Bavaria. This King preferred the nights over the days and the film is subsequently filmed mostly at night. This pale skinned man living the life of a recluse in his castles created a sort of mythical image of himself.  Just as he lived in a sort of fantasy, disassociating himself from the affairs of the world around him it is mentioned that this King felt that the most important thing he could give to his people was to facilitate in the creation of beautiful things. Ludwig rebelled from his post as a king with its rigid rules of etiquette and decorum by seeking refuge in the the arts through his support of Wagner, actors, and the creation of his myriad number of castles.

With the extremely dark palette Visconti seems to be referencing back to early horror films. It's not hard to imagine the pale gaunt King as a vampire of sorts. Ludwig preys on the the young men that he surrounds himself with. This is an interesting subtext given that Bram Stoker, the author of ""Dracula"", seemed to have an ambiguous relationship to the actor Henry Irving, whom he based the image of Dracula on. In another reference to early horror films Visconti depicts in the last scene men searching for Ludwig at night with their torches. This is reminiscent of the famous scene from ""Frankentein"" when the townsfolk are searching for the Frankenstein monster. The ambiguous portrayal of Ludwig, who is simultaneously shown as victim and predator,  and as a misunderstood outsider, perhaps reflects Visconti's ambivalent views about living in a Catholic society that ostracizes those whose sexual inclinations are outside of society's norms. Visconti also seems to be attracted and repelled by Ludwig, who was evidently quite a handsome man in his youth, but who is portrayed later in life like one of the living dead, with his pallid skin and mouth of decaying black teeth.

This particular DVD set is in Italian with English subtitles, with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The film is newly restored and re-mastered with over two hours of features, including a documentaries about Luchino Visconti, and Silvana Mangano, as well an interview by Carlo Lizzani of Piero Tosi.",1263945600,8,2266,4.847545219638243
190983,3,157252250X,"This film is great only for the visual details: It was shot on location so you actually get to see the interiors of the Ludwig castles: The bedroom at Linderhof, the throne room at Neuschwanstein, the hall of mirrors, which rivals Versailles' at Herrenchiemsee, and also the costumes are outstanding, particularly in the early part of the movie at Ludwigs's coronation wherre the trains, the tiara and the condecorations are all perfect, polished and in place. For this historical record alone, it is worth watching, and also because these castles were the lasting legacy of Ludwig to his people. The main flow of tourists to Bavaria for most of the 20th Century, and still today, is due to the existence of these magnificent creations. As much as the expenses were critiziced at the time, and used against him later in relation to his dethronement, it has paid off many times over as an investment in benefiting his people and I dare say in this respect he surpassed all of his ancestors.
In another cultural contribution he also remains unsurpassed, though he has never been acknowledged as fully as he deserves: He is largely responsible for the greatest music composed in Germany at the time, namely his patronage of Richard Wagner was an ESSENTIAL part of the development of music and he alone was able to see it, and to insure that it not only survived, but flourished, a very difficult enterprise since Wagner had a knack for creating controversy and conjuring animosity.
 However here also the problems begin. There are a lot of important points in Ludwig's life that are not sufficiently clearly covered, which is not comprehensible in such a long film, for example we are never shown a performance of Wagner, as Ludwig had it done: With him completely alone in the theater and applauding from the Royal Box, which was not only historically correct, but would have highlighted both his eccentric personality and his strong determination for artistic patronage. Instead we see a theatrical performance, that looks like a rehersal and no Ludwig watching in the Royal Box. There is no scene that takes place in the Turkish Pavilion at Linderhof, which was one of Ludwig's favorite and most successful artistic creations. He often dressed in full Royal regalia for events at the Pavilion. There is also a very sketchy coverage of his affairs with men. The whole thing is 'suggested' more than it is stated. I found that for four hours of film footage and the fact that it was made in 1972, it should have have been more specific and detailed on this issue, which was after all, a major component of the king's life. More importantly, it should have been shown as a separate issue from his mental instability, which was obviously a hereditary problem, most particlularly because the two have been thrown together to maliciosuly denigrate the character of the king as 'decadent' , first by the clique that had a vested interested in deposing him, and ever since by the politics of repression and distorrtion that were applied to the historical record till the advancement of gay liberation in the last century was able to inform and clarify these readings .  Helmut Berger is absolutely riveting in his performance as Ludwig, his characterization is profound and convincing in every frame. Romy Schiender is wonderful as Ludwig's cousin, The Empress Elizabeth of Austria, with whom Ludwig was infatuated in the unique fashion that homosexual men have always idiolized, praised and showered adoration and  devotion unto divas and fabulous women who act like they are, through the centuries, and NOT in love with her as has been written in the past to purposely disguise and misconstrue the king's homosexuality. Trevor Howard is great as the manipulative, astute, and roguish Richard Wagner. Silvana Mangano was aptly decorative and restrained in her role as Cosima von Buelow, Wagner's mistress at the time.
The only problem with the film, and it is a problem, is the length. Probably under the influence of Wagner, who was a great composer but lacked all sense of theatrical timing, Visconti has over extended the scenes to an unecessary degree that inevitably stimulate boredom and frustration in the viewer. I can not believe that some reviewers consider this extremely long 4 hours to be 'shortened' and if there is indeed a longer version, it should only come out with a warning in RED in the packaging.",1249257600,51,4411,4.926075268817204
190984,2,157252250X,"I used to be crazy about Visconti's turgid movie concoctions, which I must report sadly do not stand the test of time.  Helmut Berger in overdrive as the mad king, and Helmut Griem as his loyal pretty face. Romy Schneider and Silvana Mangano as moving decorative objects (count the number of times Romy steps out of coaches). Tedious tirades from irrelevant characters.  But worse, a very coy
approach to the whole subject of the king's attraction to males, which in Viscontis' view serves as compensation for his two great unrequited loves: his cousin the Empress and Wagner.  Part turkey, part architectural documentary.  By now, a historical curiosity.",1248825600,9,655,5.093457943925234

This movie is brilliant in a way that Ludwig II of Bavaria, the mysterious fairy tale king who build Neuschwanenstein, is portrayed just as strange, unbalanced and crazy as he most likely was in real life. One feels pity for him throughout, with his Wagner obsession and his devotional love for his cousin, the famous empress Elisabeth of Austria. And Visconti delivered again a movie worthy of his fame. One comes away in turmoil about this tragic figure ... But to be honest the best scenes are the ones with Romy Schneider, without her the movie would only be half as good.",1232755200,2,828,4.594594594594595
190986,5,157252250X,"Hooray!  Koch Lorber has decided to restore this magnificent, terribly underrated and misunderstood masterpiece by Luchino Visconti, one of my favorite Italian filmmakers.  This is the full length, four hour version.  When it was released here in the states initially, it was cut almost in half to two measly hours, which destroyed Visconti's stately pace and vision.  Even the VHS copy (which ran about 10 minutes shorter than this copy) was in the wrong aspect ratio (it was 1.85:1), and it cropped Visconti's excellent framing.  This DVD is in the proper ratio (2.35:1), it's at the proper length (there is no six hour version as some have said on this thread), and the transfer looks magnificent.

This is a sad, poetic, elegaic film that has scenes which are often startling in their poetry and beauty.  Despite Ludwig's sheltered and indulgent life, he is vastly unhappy, indulging in fantasies and building extraordinary castles (many of which still remain in Bavaria).  Visconti portrays him with sympathy and empathy, and has made one of his greatest films.  Helmut Berger is excellent as Ludwig (Visconti had great taste in actors as well as lovers), Romy Schiender is wonderful as Ludwig's cousin (whom Ludwig loves), and Trevor Howard is great as Richard Wagner.  It has some of the most exquisite, painterly cinemtography in any Visconti films.  You really owe it to yourself to see this great film, whose reputation should soar after people see this DVD.

The DVD has a few documentaries, including one called Luchino Visconti:  Life as in a Romance.  It's a rehash of a documentary that appeared on its own DVD called Luchino Visconti: A Portrait.  It's a poorly made, very short documentary, and doesn't even get close to the brilliance of Visconti or any of his works.  It's an extraordinarily superficial work.  The other documentaries are slighly more interesting, though I've seen better special features on DVD.  Regardless of the disappointing special features, the film Ludwig is worth watching and owning.  It's one of Visconti's most extraordinary films, arguably his last masterpiece.",1228608000,20,2110,5.134897360703812

The scope, cinematography, and character development is excellent. The gradual deterioration and dethronement of Ludwig is very well represented.
The question as to whether Ludwig is a genius or a madman- or a combination of both- is handled sensitively and intelligently. The portrayal of his enduring love of his cousin (Romy Schneider in one of her finest and most controversial roles) is excellent, as is the portrayal
of the wily genius, Richard Wagner, by Trevor Howard, Ludwig, played adroitly by Helmet Berger. is victimized by a lack of royal mentoring and the very common inbreeding that often afflicted European royalty. All in all, the historical representation is enlightening as exemplified by the backdrop of Bismark's consolidation of the disparate German kingdoms into modern Germany in 1870. I was ALSO impressed by the representations of Ludwig's castle without rooms, and his underground grotto with swan boots in a spring. The film gets pretty bizarre at times, and the ending in particularly puzzling and strangely justified.

I've seen this four times and each time I find something new and interesting. On the other hand, the film is long with subtitles which may turn off much of the American audience. I feel this movie is most like another Visconti masterpiece ""The Leopard."" which also depicts the
demise of the preeminence of European monarchies in the nineteenth century. Also the obsessive homoerotic element is reminiscent of Visconti's
adaptation of Thomas Mann's ""Death in Venice. For someone who loves first rate European ""art films;"" Ludwig is a real boon!",1224979200,66,1667,5.2434456928838955

190993,3,157252250X,"I have read a considerable amount of material on the life of the tragic Ludwig II of Bavaria. Enough to be totally captivated by the man and his dedication to a life of art and music. For sure, he had many flaws like other leaders, but he was a man made for a future era and was born before his time. This Visconti film had tremendous potential to bring out the truth about this famous eccentric who was in love with the night and was only interested in building castles to fill a romantic vision of Germanic mythology. Unfortunately it fails to communicate properly about the man to the audience. The actor chosen for the role, Helmut Berger, was good. The potential was there, but it falls short. I was much more intrigued by the scenes of Ludwig that were filmed for Richard Burton's ""Wagner"", and in those short glimpses we understood much more about Ludwig than you will discover in this long film. Especially helpful were the scenes that showed discussions between staffers under Ludwig's employ and the plotting of greedy people. ""Wagner"" came close but was limited because it was after all a movie about Wagner's whole life. This attempt from 1970 started on the right track with location scenery but appears to be disconnected regarding scenes of Ludwig's life leaving us out of the plot. So much so that to some it appears to be a lot of dark photography of a brooding Ludwig hiding in his castle until the guards come to place him under arrest. Someday I expect the King will be given the full film treatment that he deserves but until now that day has yet to arrive.",1085961600,9,1578,4.559859154929577
190994,4,157252250X,"Ludwig, the mad king of Bavaria, was a very interesting and sad person. He built fantastic fairytale castles and a wonderfull sleigh all in gold that is very ornate.

190995,4,157252250X,"Ludwig is known to most of us as the Mad King of Bavaria who loved Wagner, spent extravagant sums building castles even though his country was going bankrupt and eventually was deposed by his countries ministers for his ineptness at matters of state and died tragically by drowning himself in a lake.  In the hands of Luchino Visconti this well known bit of history becomes a kind of parable of the high-minded artist living at odds with the rest of the world who care only for their material well being.  Its a little bit ridiculous to have this talentless boy king represent anything but a talentless boy king but its also gorgeous to look at. Luchino Visconti's Ludwig is sexually uninterested in women. Nonetheless he falls in love with his cousin Elizabeth(Romy Schneider) and who wouldn't. Elizabeth as played by Romy Schneider is something to behold. She is smart as a whip and playful and passionate and elegant and seems to intuitively understand how to make the most of her position in the world. Ludwig is only 19 when he takes the throne and is attracted to this creature who possesses all the qualities he does not. She is worldly and perfectly at ease with her position, he is a hopeless dreamer uncomfortable living within worldly dimensions and constantly longing for the impossible. At first he just seems naive but as he grows older he does not outgrow his dream-infused nature he simply cultivates it by building ever more extravagant castles with the vain hope of bringing these dreams to life. Recognizing in himself a notable lack of talent Ludwig becomes patron to Wagner in the hopes of bettering himself, this relationship and his relationship with other artists of his day lead only to disappointment for Ludwig is a hopeless and ineffective dilettante. Ultimately he becomes a recluse indulging in drink and fantasy very similar to the decadent poets which were the rage of the 1860's-1870's period in which Ludwig ruled. Visconti, who was himself an aristocrat, obviously sympathises with Ludwig and shares with Ludwig a love for ornate interiors. This isn't Visconti's only tale about a suffering artist with unusual sensual tastes, he covered this ground in Death in Venice. What makes Ludwig so unusual is that as leader of a nation he had vast sums of money at his disposal with which to indulge his tastes. Ironically even though he bankrupted the nation he was supposed to be ruling  he seems to have been a popular king. Ultimately his downfall coincides with Bavarias downfall and the beginning of the end of an era when one family (the Hapsburgs) ruled half of Europe. A beautiful film as all of Visconti's films are but this ones for art lovers not history lovers--Visconti obviously shares Ludwigs love of ""art"" and disdain for more practical matters like Prussia and Austria. A little more history would have given this film a little more muscle. As it is the film is as consumed with beauty and platitudes as Ludwig was.",1042761600,3,2961,4.8478260869565215
190996,5,157252250X,"I don't believe Visconti ever did a film that wasn't perfect. His ""Death in Venice"" is the only case where I love the film as much as the book. Of course ""Ludwig"" is long - and I believe the complete version can only be found in Europe - but in the end I only wished it was longer. There is a longer cut, but I don't think it's available on video - I saw it, years and years ago, on the TV. This amazing film shows us a man that, powerful as he is, is also fragile and confused, passionate and frightened. The few bad reviews I red are due only to complete different concepts on filmaking: if you were born and bred in the PS2 / MTV world, than this will be boring as [heck]! Bo to the ""old"" people like me, it's a rare treat.",1018224000,3,726,3.945578231292517
190997,3,157252250X,"Ludwigs tale of loneliness, despair, depression, imprisonment almost makes its telling in this instance  far from  being eligible for a neo-Greek tragedy classification. Mr Visconti seems to overdirect throughout: we have splendid, splendid scenes, one following the other. But these very same scenes appear to be jump-cut with the result that the viewer can hardly internalize what is going on!
Then there is the overuse of filters, making the scenes so dark that they are hardly intelligible. When they are intelligible, these scenes seem to have a silly, empty meaning.
The narrative line is carried along by Berger (so who else?), but the poor man is given very little to work with. Example: Ludwig becomes aware of a household lackey, why we are not quite sure. Poor lackey goes about his work: all the while Ludwig broods. The audience is never quite sure why. The young mans assets are never observed as Ludwig may have observed them with stolen glances.
Berger has been directed to appear weak and somewhat effeminate. For dramatic action the audience demands much more for the tale of the film to take on the tragic proportions we spoke of above. So we are left with an inconsequential ending when it could have been an ending worthy of using parts of Vangelis Mythodea as music for the final spiritual torture and climax.
Had another actor attempted the role, the possibility of his being directed to be a little larger than life would have given the audience a real feeling for the tragic forces at play. The scenes with cousin Elizabeth are just not believable. She, however,  carries things along. But her responses to this piece of limp celery are not believable. They would have been believable, had Ludwig been somewhat of a stud. Had he been, the impact of the forces that tore him apart would have been all the more real and deeply affecting.
We did like the movie. The costumes and sets were magnificent. That is sort of like saying that one likes a restaurant because of its ambiance. Again, direction! What of the scenes in which Ludwig is preparing to be crowned king? In particular, one scene has a number of women of the court literally bunched together with their long trains in the close space of an antechamber. Their closeness to one another made one think of a dressing room at a venue in Las Vegas rather than a space in palace.
It is these continuing jars, shocks to ones sensibilities that helps to render this story telling rather low grade in impact.
Theres no question that Ludwig had a problem and a story; but we not once during the film gave up our disbelief of the action in front of us. We hoped that a character would come out of the Visconti gloom who would make the action plausible. Never came.
In all, the film will provide opportunity for endless speculation as to how this sad tale should really be presented.",1014595200,5,2856,4.719438877755511

This is a great film, not just visually (gasp-inducing cinematography and locations), but also as a complex psychological study featuring a brilliant performance by Helmut Berger in a demanding, enormous role that covers the Bavarian king from idealistic, sensitive youth, in love with poetry and Wagner, to middle-aged, debauched madman. This movie was butchered in its original release, its length cut in half for American audiences, but finally we can now see it as it always should have been presented. There are so many highlights, rich in atmosphere and psychological insight. Romy Schneider is a beautiful and powerful presence, and Trevor Howard makes the perfect Richard Wagner. Despite its four hour length I was never bored and I've now seen it four times, so obviously I consider it thoroughly compelling viewing.

7797958,3,157252250X,"One of the progenitors of Italian Neorealism, director Luchino Visconti often found his pendulum swinging in a more melodramatic direction.  And that's certainly the case with Ludwig (1973) an overstuffed buffet of royal politics, sexual repression and a hint of madness.  Helmut Berger inhabits the role of ""Mad"" King Ludwig II of Bavaria, whose artistic obsessions and homosexual tendencies pushed him into a life of paranoid isolation.

At nearly four hours in length (the TV version adds another 17-minutes), Visconti certainly had the freedom to leave no stone unturned.  But his emphasis lies with the underlying cause of Ludwig's fragile mental state, caused by thwarted passions and a government that coddled his eccentricities in exchange for a free hand.  Ludwig's legacy, after being deposed and driven to suicide, are the extravagant castles that remain a huge tourist attraction in what is now Germany.

Inheriting the throne at the age of 18, Ludwig (Berger) has dreams of surrounding himself with the greatest artistic minds in Europe.  His first recruit is composer Richard Wagner, who Ludwig supports at great expense.  But the realities of government and economic costs of the Franco-Prussian war soon make the new King's creative priorities seem excessively foolhardy.  His sole confidant is his cousin, the Empress Elisabeth of Austria (Romy Schneider), who admires his passion but mocks his navet.

Backing out of an arranged marriage, Ludwig's sexual preferences soon become common knowledge and he retreats even further in a self-imposed exile in which music, art and architecture become his sole pursuits.  But as the map of the world begins to change, Bavaria soon finds itself forced to make new political allies.  And the fate of the ""Mad"" King becomes almost a foregone conclusion.

Visconti and Berger were lovers at the time of filming, and the story revolves around Ludwig's fear of admitting his sexuality.  It's a valid point of view, but one that quite often overwhelms the film to the point of excluding other interesting political and social events.  Ludwig - the man and the film - are insular creations full of unhealthy self-loathing.  Time spent outside of the main characters head is a welcome relief, but all too rare.

On a technical level, the film is a lush tapestry of Old World visuals, using the decadently opulent architecture as a background.  From hidden grottos to massive halls, Visconti beautifully captures Ludwig's inspiration on film.  Still at the top of his game (Death in Venice won several BAFTAs the year earlier), the director mixes elegant compositions with often jarring operatic performances.  The result is, depending on your tastes, a discordant mess or an innovative composition.

Either way, Arrow Films presents the film with an equally decadent amount of extras.  Besides the 4K restoration of both the theatrical and TV cuts, additional material are spread across both discs, including a must-see hour-long biography on the director's career, interviews with producer Dieter Geissler, screenwriter Suso Cecchi d'Amico, and actress Silvana Mangano.  A few Soundtrack Extracts, trailers and liner notes are included as well.  There are several soundtrack options, but the English language track works best with subtitles popping up as needed.",1493683200,,3313,5.314779270633397
7797959,5,157252250X,"This review is for the new 4-disc Blu-ray edition of Ludwig by Arrow Academy (there are many older reviews for different versions of this film, some of which could not play on region 1/A players):

Ludwig (1973) is possibly my favorite film by Visconti, possibly a tie with the Leopard (1963). In many ways, I see Ludwig as an alternate take from the Leopard on a deteriorating ruling class. This film has several haunting moments complemented by the lush colors (contrasting with the dark subject matter). Helmut Berger's acting is excellent, as well as Romy Schneider (the Empress of Austria). I think this film is a must have for any fan of Visconti.

While I was nervous when ordering this film since my past experiences with foreign films that were distributed by companies that weren't Criterion were not good, I was still eager for this new version of Ludwig to be released since the only other option was an older DVD that would often go for $50 or more. My concerns were unfounded because this edition of Ludwig is fantastic and on a similar quality level as those produced by Criterion.
The transfer of the film is well done.

The set includes the film on two Blu-rays (at 4K and 1080p) that play on region A Blu-ray players as well two DVDs (720p) that play on region 1 DVD players. If you are an American buyer, you do not have to worry about this edition not playing. The film itself has two versions: A full-length theatrical version divided in two parts and a five-part version intended for TV (which is the same length as the full-length version). The set also comes with a booklet (similar to what comes with some Criterion films) and is contained inside of a good quality box.

I highly recommend the film Ludwig and this edition of it. I hope that more of Visconti's films are given the treatment that the Leopard, and now Ludwig, have received.",1492300800,12,1864,4.622356495468278
