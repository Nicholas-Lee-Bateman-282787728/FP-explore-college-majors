2196460,5,B0006V4KY0,"Though it isn't given the National publicity as the Sopranos, the Wire undoubtedly is much better.  I say that not taking away from how good the Sopranos is, but the fact is the Wire is not only showing you Baltimore's Hood, but every ghetto hood across America.  From D.C. to Philly to the brick city in Jersey, to the 5 boroughs in NYC, to the dirty dirty down south, to them wards in Texas, all the way to Cali.  Granted, most of the characters in the Wire dress and talk East Coast, the struggles and lifestyles are no different in the drug game.  The Wire is not afraid to show you the gully side of drugs, police corruption, political corruption, and dishoner amongst men and women who break bread together and will off each other or their families over principle.  This is basically a reflection of what our society has become and The Wire doesn't try to sugarcoat it or hide that fact.  Probably why it's on HBO and not on regular TV (Is there such a thing as free regular TV anymore?).  The acting is top notch from everyone including extras.  This set gets watched just as much as my Godfather, Heat, Goodfellas, Casino or Scarface movies do.  It's on the same level.",1134518400,13,1177,4.462616822429907
2196461,5,B0006V4KY0,"Great introduction, Jeff.  My only addition would be that ""The Wire"" is one of the funniest shows on television, too.  From Snot Boogie to moving desks, to fax's from the port, to beer cans on the roof, to Ziggy's duck, you will laugh at the gallows humor until you cry.

I can't wait for the fourth season.",1134000000,2,307,4.350877192982456
2196462,4,B0006V4KY0,"First season was amazing. So true, so raw, so ghetto and still beautiful. Second season tried to do the whole racial mix thing and went anti-government. Well, I guess it's our new war. Still, the second season lost it's touch a bit.",1127606400,,232,4.5476190476190474
2196463,5,B0006V4KY0,"I'm jealous: the Amazon editorial review above is a 100 percent bull's-eye, and I wish I had written it.

This IS the best show on HBO (or on television for that matter).  The writing has a richness and precision that is not describable and the casting is as perfect as I have ever seen. The storylines are intricate and gripping, the characters are layered and real, and the acting is beyond description -- there isn't a weak performance, or even an average one, anywhere.  From top to bottom, The Wire is brilliant.  Its craft is stunning and its heart is profound.

More good news: the third season is up to the standard of the first two.  With due respect to Hill Street Blues, the Sopranos, and many other greats, this is the best work I have seen on television.  The Wire is without peer.",1122768000,7,794,4.472222222222222

2196465,5,B0006V4KY0,The Wire is one of the most raw and realistic shows that portrays all angles of the dope game and street life. It takes place in Baltimore and shows perspective from the police and the drug dealers. The only downside to watching this series is that the episodes are addictive and one can easily spend 3 hours watching all the episodes on a disc.,1117238400,7,345,4.40625

2196469,5,B0006V4KY0,"One of the best series on TV.  Runs at least neck and neck, I think better then the Sopranos.

The characters are fascinating and complex.  Some of the best story telling and acting I've seen in a long time.  The characters personalities are compelling and captivating.  You just get hooked.

I was a Soprano's snob.  I just felt it was the best thing on TV and safely tucked away in Jersey so I didn't have to think about the crimes affecting my life.

Before I viewed The Wire, I guess I didn't want to be bothered with the whole urban crime thing, especially so close to home.  I felt like what on earth could these kids, with pants hanging down to there knees and rap music blasting have to say that's intelligent?

I found that the crime hierarchy is so much like the Sopranos, organized to the point of being genius.  I found just like the Sopranos there is a Family like element, but a brutality that is unbelievable.

There are characters you will love but know they are paid to kill.  Characters you find ultimately ruthless almost with animal cunning.  Then you will find some characters eloquent in there lifestyle and speech.

Among the characters in Season one, a young dealer who lives in a condemned building with about 6 little elementary school kids.  He buys food for them and sends them off to school.  He's lost with no parents like those kids.  The show isn't preachy in any way.  It just is.

Also The Wire is about both sides of the coin.  The police officers, politics, and lifestyles are just as riveting.  Cops that drink too much, have an awful family life, fighting with ex's, or not giving a damn.

I think it's not as popular as the Sopranos because there aren't a lot of big time stars in it although there are local actors and cameos by some well known artists.
Please take a look at this outstanding series; you'll be glad you did.",1173312000,,1864,4.465875370919881
2196470,5,B0006V4KY0,"I finally picked these DVD sets up after hearing over and over again that this is ""the best show on tv.""  Obviously I was not disappointed.  I'm only halfway through the first season and I already ordered the third season, I'm that hooked.  It's amazing that the show can feature so many different characters and plots while still keeping the viewer invested in said characters and plots.  Unless TNT is actually your definition of drama, you won't be disappointed in this show.",1172188800,,478,4.7926829268292686
2196471,5,B0006V4KY0,"I can't say enough about this series its realistic story lines, excellent casting (got to mention - nice looking ""Phine"" brothers)!  It's simple the best.

Owning the first 3 seasons has saved the day.  There is NOTHING like this series to draw you into the lives of those characters in Baltimore.

2196474,5,B0006V4KY0,"The Wire is the best serial drama ever made - period! Fast paced, intricate, complex, and multi-layered, it is like television on crack, once you're hooked, you're hooked and there never seems to be enough.

My husband turned me onto The Wire at the beginning of the fourth season. Fortunately, we have HBO on Demand so I was able to watch the full third season to catch up. I started watching the third season on a Saturday afternoon and could not stop watching until I had reached the last episode, I think it was sometime around 4am on Sunday morning and I still wanted more!!

Both the first and second season boxed sets were exceptional, containing LOTS of extras, like episode commentary, interviews with the cast, producers and writers, both well worth the price.

I highly recommend The Wire to all those who wish to be entertained rather than sedated by their television programming.",1168819200,,892,4.779220779220779

2196476,5,B0006V4KY0,I received the 1st and 2nd seasons of the wire as a gift. I had not seen any of the first season. The story and the plot of each show is so true to life. I am a narcotics investigator and I have not seen any t.v. drama that portrays the street life as it really is on the street. My whole family and office has become addicted to The Wire as well.,1168300800,,347,3.767123287671233

Wonderful acting, wonderful story lines, and added the real life element makes this one of the best shows created.",1168300800,,299,4.303571428571429
2196479,5,B0006V4KY0,"I hesitate to try to typify THE WIRE in a wee Amazon review, as the show's extraordinary realism and excellence are reflected in so many different components, it would take a feature article to do it justice. For example, this crime program is populated by police officers and criminals who are in many cases, the ""genuine article,"" and there is no obvious difference between these real-deal folks and the show's ACTUAL actors. Thus, we can score one for verisimilitude.  (Actually, score two.)

I'd also like to point out that if you're a fan of this show and you haven't read teleplay writer and novelist George Pellecanos's work yet, get to it. (Oh, and cancel that holiday you were thinking about spending in Baltimore. The place is apparently a corrupt hellhole.)",1161043200,4,768,4.9

Intrigue, betrayal, politics, greed, The wire show, in full extent, what is going on in all the main cities, not only of the U. States but, also, in all countries around the world.

The wire is a story about men, our fear, denial, hesitation and, here and there, outstandig overcome of our own deficiencies...

The show is so good that I decided to buy the dvds.

2196484,5,B0006V4KY0,"I'm hooked!  This is one of the best police dramas on TV hands down!  Brilliantly written and totally believable.  While The Wire is hard-edged it's still has comedic qualities.  I love the fact that this drama showcases the direct and indirect connections between every person on the show.  The Wire also gives a platform to the 'urban'characters that you don't see on network television.

8043518,5,B0006V4KY0,My favorite show of all times and it was a gift from my wife. It's loaded with extras and comes highly recommended. One thing to keep in mind is it's not a street show as much as it's a cop show which originally aired on HBO so it's also a little more gritty than you're run of the mill show. It was received by the time guaranteed and in new condition as promised...,1324166400,,367,4.041095890410959

8043520,5,B0006V4KY0,"My friend, Rose, told me I'd love The Wire.  She was right.  She said it was a great show and that I'd be caught up in fabulous dialogue and I was, but there are three other reasons that this HBO Series haunts my thoughts, three reasons I'm going to explain without giving away any spoilers:

1. While it's a magnificent modern story, it's told in the classic hero's journey style.
2. It feels real - the setting, characters, situations, and story all feel as if somewhere it's playing out in real life.
3. It fulfills my own obsession regarding the potential transition of the novel as television series.

The Hero's Journey

Joseph Campbell, noted for his study of the monomyth, posited that all the greatest stories from cultures worldwide had similar elements and could be framed by a structure called the hero's journey.  In this journey a reluctant hero, usually an outsider from his own kind, must undertake a hazardous journey where he confronts the demons of the world and the demons in his own mind.  In The Wire there are three separate heroes from three distinct societies in modern Baltimore, Maryland.

The first is Jimmy McNulty, an Irish detective who has an aversion to authority and doesn't care what bridges he burns in his obsessive quest to close a case. Not just any case though, McNulty must solve the big case, the important case, in order to exorcise his self-destructive internal demons of alcoholism and relationship sabotage.  Throughout the series you get the feeling that he's always on the ledge windmilling his arms to keep from plummeting to his death.  In his journey, McNulty has to fail more than he succeeds and he has to come to terms with the fact that he's not going to make that big score without help.  He has to discover somewhere within his nature the ability to be loyal and he has to accept his own fallibility before he can really do some good.

The second hero is a junkie named Bubbles.  His journey is all too common, it's the rock bottom dive of addiction and the struggle to drag himself up one day at a time. He's our advocate for the victims of the drug society, ignored by authorities until there's an exploitation opportunity, abused and bled dry by dealers and thugs.  From Bubble's perspective we learn the true meaning of despair and yet we also see the few shreds of beauty in war-torn Gangland, U.S.A.  Precisely because he'll never be missed if he dies, because there's never-ending line of junkies to take his place, we're tied to Bubbles.  We're seeing him as a human being with the potential to journey back from the depths of Hell and rejoin our America.  He has the farthest to go and the most difficult tasks ahead of him, Bubbles is the quintessential underdog.

The third hero at first appears anything but.  He is Omar Little and his self-described occupation: ""I robs drug dealers.""  He's a stick-up man; Jesse James of the drug community.  He hits dealers and money men and all the corner boys scatter when he walks down the street.  ""Omar's Coming,"" is a common refrain as the boys scatter like roaches encountering bright light.  He carries two trademark weapons, a pistol-grip 12-gage shotgun and a Desert Eagle 50 caliber pistol.  Omar's journey is that of a hero with a code.  He's one of the most honorable characters on the show and despite his role as an obvious outlaw, he doesn't break that code for any price.  It's true that he's a predator, the most dangerous shark in the bay, but he's also the force that balances good and evil, for who else are the drug dealers going to fear?  Oh, did I mention that Omar is openly gay?  Flaming and scary as hell, especially when he wants to go out for his Honey Nut Cheerios.

I've never seen a story that successfully brought three separate heroes along their quests and managed to interweave these stories until now, until The Wire.  In that way it's masterful, exceeding the master, James Joyce and his classic hero narrative, Finnegan's Wake.

The Wire Feels Real.

David Simon was a police reporter at The Baltimore Sun for twelve years.  It's this experience that gives the story and creative concept its validity.  But it seems that wasn't enough for Simon to create the show.  Various consultants and crew members come from the very societies showcased in the series. He has former drug dealers and cops and junkies advising him on what it's like, how it feels, how it looks, sounds, and smells.  The show is nothing if not detailed.  There aren't grand cops and robber shootouts or magnificent courtroom closing speeches because in real life a shootout lasts only long enough for a bullet to find a target and rarely does a case make its way to the courtroom when out of court settlement is expedient.

When Bubbles pushes his shopping cart down the street, you hear the needles crack under his beat-up shoes. When Omar appears out of nowhere to respond to a message on the street, he scares you, you can smell his sweat and nicotine.  When Stringer Bell meets with his developers you can feel the tension like a man out of place, trying to fit in.  It's like Deadwood was in its attention to detail.

The Novel as Television.

Simon is an experienced book author (Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood) and when it came to The Wire he ""saw it as a visual novel, with each season a distinct chapter exploring an aspect of inner-city life.""

That's what I've often said, that a great novel can only really be told visually through a series-length television show.  A two or three hour movie can't do justice to the characters, plots, subplots and tension of a novel.  The Wire has proven it, because this is the perfect vehicle for telling this perfect story.

Enjoy it.  It's a beautiful piece of art.

8043525,5,B0006V4KY0,"A gritty realistic telling of life in the city of Baltimore meant for those who drive through Baltimore on I-95 or over fly over it, but never care about the life on the streets.

The language, which if taken out of context would be shocking, is as necessary to setting the mood as the backdrop of city landmarks and abandoned buildings.

The bad guys are not all bad, but there is little excuse-making forthcoming by the writers.  The good guys are not all that good and their excuses sound too hollow to be believed.

Wathcing it on dvd is superior to the week to week viewing on HBO since it is meant to be like chapters in a book.  The going seems slow in the beginning of each season and the pace too frantic at the end, but the real story is charecter development.  You cannot help but wonder what happens to these charecters lives when the season is done.

The ensemble cast is surpassed only by the writing.
