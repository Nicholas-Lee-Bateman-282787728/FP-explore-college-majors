8688242,5,B00PJ8QOOE,"An astounding film that brilliantly captures the mesmerizing power, creativity and 'intelligence' of Nature, as its perfect processes work together to create an island from an underwater volcano 'hot spot.' Absolutely fascinating! The photography and editing are excellent and are woven together to reveal one of the greatest stories on Earth. Throughout the movie's narrative, countless related tidbits of knowledge are integrated seamlessly. This movie should be required viewing for everyone so that everyone can, just as I did, humbly acknowledge where we humans fit in the scheme of things.",1434412800,,595,5.622222222222222
