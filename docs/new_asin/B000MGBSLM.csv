2730911,3,B000MGBSLM,"I purchased this dvd because I had seen the movie years ago and wanted to have this one in my collection. It's a true story, which I like. It just needs more umph! in the movie.",1255305600,,177,3.9444444444444446
2730912,4,B000MGBSLM,"Cheryl Pollak portrays up and coming model Marla Hanson, a far too trusting novice who comes to New York in 1986 with dreams of stardom. After pounding the pavement and working at a local watering hole, her star begins to rise. Capturing the eye of photographer Eric Warner (Dale Midkiff), he invites her to his studio to create a better portfolio for her. She meets his lighting assistant, Steve Roth (a perfectly cast and very creepy Kirk Baltz), who immediately develops a fixation for the midwestern beauty with deadly consequences. She accepts a sublet room in an apartment he owns and rents out to several models not realizing what she's getting into. Soon he's stalking her and after being nice too long, she tells him to take a hike. Furious at her rejection, he arranges to have his friends attack her and slash her face with a razor. But she is attacked a second time during the trial when the defense tries to blame her for the attack.

One of the better true life crime stories brought to television (it was even really filmed in New York City), it was first aired in 1991 as ""The Marla Hanson Story."" Unable to reignite her modeling career, Hanson turned to championing victim's rights.",1187654400,12,1199,4.682464454976303
2730913,5,B000MGBSLM,"I love anything with Dale Midkiff in it. I have heard the story so it was very interesting. It was a little drawn out but knowing she was a survivor kept me watching. If Dale wasn't in it, I would not have ordered it.",1179964800,8,217,3.9545454545454546

2730979,4,B000MGBSLM,"For the period depicted, the film was realistic and thought provoking. Since it is based on a true story, it might spur someone on to research the real model and learn more about the behind the scenes story. Without intending to, the film also shows that we are not raised with good judgment about people who are predators.  We fail to ignore our intuition, especially women, and allow ourselves to get hurt.  The film should have a note in the post-logue to read the work of Gavin De Becker: The Gift of Fear; Protecting the Gift, etc. These would be an excellent way to avert similar danger. Most people are still unaware that violent crimes are primarily accomplished by people we are at least acquainted with, and not the stranger scenario that much of the old advice is based on.

Restoring trust between people requires that we face hard realities that unhealthy people will cross our path, and the path of our children. Denial abut this, and lack of preparation for when that happens, is a recipe for harm.",1426636800,4,1013,4.648044692737431
