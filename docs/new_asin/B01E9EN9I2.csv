Fight smarter, not harder is the underlying theme. It's packed with useful and relevant tools to add to your fight tool box.  I highly recommend Jeff Burger's ""Attack the Attack"" video to both the serious student and the martial art veterans like myself. Seriously folks, you want this one!",1463443200,3,450,4.818181818181818

7733505,5,B01E9EN9I2,"I trained with Jeff many years ago in traditional karate. I lost track of him over the years, but recently met up with him at a seminar. I was impressed with the knowledge and expertise he gained over the years, and his trips to China and Thailand. He is friendly, easy going and always willing to help. Combined with a great sense of humor, make him an excellent teacher. I found his DVD ""Attack the Attack"" filled with useful information, clearly explained and well demonstrated. Regardless of your skill level, this DVD will be a valuable addition to your library. Kudos, Jeff on a job well done.  S.

7733506,5,B01E9EN9I2,"Jeff Burger is a highly experienced, talented Martial Arts Instructor who's innovative and practical approach makes this video a Gem!
I use material I've learned from Jeff in my own seminar presentations. This video is solid!",1501027200,,225,5.277777777777778
7733507,4,B01E9EN9I2,This video is not bad. It has inside and some drills for those interested in this. I'm not too confortable with some moves in certain circumstances.,1494115200,,148,4.730769230769231
7733508,5,B01E9EN9I2,As a 5th DAN Jeff Burger brings his expertise in a number of martial arts to this video.  For martial artists looking for straightforward applications this video provides that information.  Each technique is clearly explained and demonstrated with a partner.  This video meets the needs of a student with intermediate to advanced skills and training.  Highly recommended.,1487116800,,371,5.456140350877193
7733509,5,B01E9EN9I2,This video presents the information in a very systematic fashion.  Although most of the material looks likes it comes from the Inosanto/Locasta method of FMA boxing.  This does not detract from the video as the material is presented in a very clear cut manor.,1483315200,3,259,4.863636363636363
7733510,5,B01E9EN9I2,"As a Law Enforcement Officer for 13 years and a trainer at our academy I would encourage anyone interested in realistic common sense self defense, to buy this DVD. Coach Jeff has Extensive knowledge and training in martial arts and has also competed in the ring. He is a master at breaking things down and helping students understand the underlying concepts. Good Luck and enjoy this DVD!",1476662400,,388,4.8059701492537314
7733511,5,B01E9EN9I2,"This is a great DVD for both beginners and experienced martial artists. The overall presentation is clean, relaxed, and with a nice pace. A great balance of explaining principles and demonstrating techniques for those principles. I felt as if I was in the training hall, taking a seminar and class with fellow students. Having other students both demonstrate with Coach Jeff Burger and with each other was a nice way of seeing the application of principles and the subtle adjustments for those students. This video didn't feel pretentious or made for only those who have prior training. There is nothing complex presented. All simple movements and principles that practitioners of any art can work to improve their skill set. I would even have people with no training watch this video if they've shown desire to learn some skills to help protect themselves.",1475884800,2,857,5.042253521126761
7733512,5,B01E9EN9I2,"This is an excellent entry into any martial arts dvd collection. The presentation is clear and the information is excellent. It goes well beyond the common defend/counter headset common in training, and opens up a huge range of alternate options involving playing with angles, structure, and timing. The drills will help you literally do more things with the same number of beats or movements.

The drills do focus almost exclusively on the upper body, but if you watch actively and pay attention you can easily extrapolate and apply the ideas to the legs, or to other styles and ranges of fighting. That means the content of the dvd has application well beyond the ~90 minutes of explicit instruction. It's a solid package if you just watch and copy, but if you're willing to put some brain-sweat in as well, there's a lot to play with.",1473984000,,837,4.772413793103448
7733513,5,B01E9EN9I2,"His fist flew menacingly through the air toward my face. Instinctively I parried it, grabbed his wrist, turned under his momentum and threw him across my shoulders over onto his back. Though he was 50 pounds heavier than me, and taller by several inches, the fight ended in a split second because my reaction was automatic and aggressive.  Thats the point and focus of the new 93 minute DVD, Attack the Attack by Jeff Berger, an instructor in Karate, Ju Jutsu, Muay Thai, and Kung Fu for over 30 years. The training material is meant for easy retention and quick mastery, with loads of demonstration.

Attack the Attack begins with the principial aspects of the program: mental, conceptual, and physical. Berger goes on to cover the importance of growing competent through practice, and visualizing the outcome. He also discusses and displays the potential picture of an attacker coming at various speeds and angles, and where to be as soon as the attack arrives. Then he breaks down various blocks  both constructive and destructive, as well as evasions and strikes, while emphasizing that the goal is to do them simultaneously. The information is simple, with sufficient explanation that can be followed through with immediately. Instead of filling the mind with multiple steps and forms that will breakdown in the middle of an assault and adrenalin-dump, Berger hands the viewer short, unfussy actions that can be quickly accomplished.

Attack the Attack is an easy to understand visual instruction on self-defense. If you want to augment your personal safety, or are just beginning to think about self-protection, this is a good, inexpensive place to begin. Also, if you're running a martial arts school or dojo and want to supplement your students training, obtaining a copy of this DVD would be the right thing to do. I highly recommend Attack the Attack.

Thanks to YMAA Publication for providing, upon my request, the free copy of Attack the Attack used for this review. The assessments are mine given without restrictions or requirements (as per Federal Trade Commissions 16 CFR, Part 255).",1473379200,,2099,5.054913294797688
7733514,5,B01E9EN9I2,"The DVD is very simple there is not a lot of flash to detract you from what is being taught. Just a white background and blue mats. Before this DVD I never heard of Jeff Burger, I have seen him in another DVD I think it was Rory Millers Joint Locks as one of the performers. There is always someone who falls under the radar that not too many people know about that is willing to take the time to show and teach their knowledge. Jeff Burger is that relative new comer that has that new spin on an old concept. Its always cool to learn new stuff or be able to enhance skills from the unknown martial arts as well as the seasoned veteran.
The principles being taught itself are straight forward and easy to follow. Each principle is broking down from the worse to the best with a small explanation to each one. One of the principle I like is Kyushu Mikiri, the idea of evading and hitting the attacker on their recovery is always a good principle to master. One of the other thing he is talking about is making sure to understand and watch for the two beats attack which at least for me I often time ignore or I genuinely forget about.
Each method is divided into chapters with a little demonstration of movement along with the technique. All the attacks are off the jab or cross (left and right) with the majority of the attack completed with the constructive and destructive blocking principle which Jeff Burger explains into better detail. Jeff Burger has two other performers test and drill the technique with a very good success rate. All in all a great DVD from a relatively unheard but very intelligent martial artist. Attack the attack is one of those concepts that is talked about a lot but is now available to study and review on DVD.",1471046400,2,1742,4.413043478260869
7733515,5,B01E9EN9I2,"Attack the Attack by Jeff Burger is an excellent DVD which simplifies counter-attack methods to use when attacked. Mr. Burger and his associates demonstrate moves in a clear and easy to follow way and he explains why these moves work. Burger takes from several different martial art sciences to get his points across. For example, he starts with the basics from Myomoto Musashi: Recognition; Decision; Mental Jump; Speed and Total time. The reasoning and explanations are then given by Burger and shown in demonstrations. He use methods from Muay Thai and several other forms, as well as his own, to teach his method of counter-attacks.

The entire DVD is interesting and knowledgeable with good explanations so that the student can easily learn. Each exercise is repeated in slow time and real time and done clearly.  The demonstrations and walk-throughs are efficient and well thought out. To get the most from this DVD, the student has to Practice, Practice and Practice. From the methods taught by Burger, this should be a pleasurable experience.

There are also some excellent after-words from Jeff Burger following the regular lessons.",1469836800,,1141,5.1567567567567565
7733516,5,B01E9EN9I2,Jeff Burger is a truly talented AND extremely experienced martial artist with decades of practical experience.,1469491200,,110,5.9375
7733517,5,B01E9EN9I2,"Very content rich and an invaluable addition to any student or instructors library.  The packaging can make this look like a street fighting, kick-butt type of video but this is really good foundational instruction for martial artists of any style.  This is 2 hours focused on the first .2 seconds of a fight or sparring exchange.  Starts with a quick overview of the principles of reacting to that first punch coming your way.  This section is too quick and Master Berger could have spent more time here, but the payback is that he moves quickly into very practical non-nonsense techniques adaptable to any style.  And it just keeps coming.  Regardless of your style, I highly recommend this as a source of dozens of reaction drills for your students to sharpen their timing and initial response.  Jeff Burger is clearly very skilled, respectful of all styles, and doesn't have the egotistical ""only I have the answer"" stuff that gets in the way of so many of these types of videos.  The biographical section at the end is fun and gives you a sense of who Jeff Burger is.",1469318400,,1072,4.695187165775401
7733518,5,B01E9EN9I2,"I really loved this DVD.  Some of the techniques were review for me - as they are drawn from Philippine systems, or Muay Thai, but there were subtle little ""tricks"" that really added to my knowledge.

The program is a wonderful encyclopedia of methodologies for hand work.  I think the principle I enjoyed the most was about choosing which method to use based on the position of your hands relative to your opponent's - on the inside, outside, etc.

Jeff definitely knows his business and has an impressive Curriculum Vitae.  As a martial artist, something was especially gratifying in watching the interview/bio with him at the very end - because he gives great respect to his teachers.  I always enjoy studying with a respectful martial artist.",1469145600,2,746,4.880952380952381
7733519,4,B01E9EN9I2,"this is a straight forward dvd on training your defensive reflexes. Mr Burger incorporates element from Muy Thai,Wing Chun and other disciplines to teach you how to defend and strike an opponent.

7733520,5,B01E9EN9I2,"I have always said that for every famous martial arts master, there are 10 more who are equally as skilled and knowledgeable who aren't well known.  Coach Jeff Burger is one of those young masters.  Attach The Attack is far more than just a loose collection of various techniques that you can use against an aggressor.  Attack The Attack takes on timing, distancing, perception speed, positioning and so on BEFORE he describes his first action.  This is scientific breakdown at its finest.  I have always held the belief that if I learn only one thing from a book or DVD, that book or DVD paid for itself.  After 50 years of martial arts practice I can say that this DVD has paid for itself over and over and over again.  Buy it and study it.  You'll be glad you did.",1467244800,8,767,4.428571428571429

7733522,5,B01E9EN9I2,"This DVD is worth it for a lot of different reasons - the footwork, body mechanics and the destructive blocking is my favorite.  He doesn't just tell you what to do, he explains the how and why.",1467158400,2,194,4.243243243243243

The lighting, sound, and video are all very well done. Coach Jeff can help you raise your game to a higher level.",1527638400,,309,4.421052631578948
8758109,5,B01E9EN9I2,"This DVD is a great complement to any seasoned fighters arsenal and offers a great foundation for beginners as well.

I was first introduced to Jeff Burger as he was involved in many of Rory Miller's DVD's. Rory speaks very highly of him so it got my interest when I saw he had his own program out.

Jeff goes step by step through drills for evasions and counters, the most interesting of which involve the concept of sen no sen ( Attack the Attack ) originally a swordfighting concept. If you've studied traditional Karate or Jeet Kune Do you may have come across similar teachings and here they kept true to that original intention. These techniques are efficient, powerful, and often sneaky. And since people have different styles there's enough variety for everyone to find what works for them.

There's a lot of information here that I know took years to accumulate. That alone makes it very a valuable, compact package which will shortcut years of training. It's really a step in the right direction for traditional martial arts instruction as it focuses on techniques with a realistic sense of timing. Sorry. You won't be twice as fast as the other guy, so if you have less moves, make them count.

Looking forward to future DVD's from Jeff. I'm hoping he does one on Karate one of these days.",1526515200,,1300,4.663755458515284

8758112,5,B01E9EN9I2,"I've had a few years of training and watched quite a few videos.
This one is special to me in so far as it addresses directly 'striking on the half-beat.'  Btw, I've read the Tao of Jeet Kune Do.  But, how to do it.
Left - Right, Left - Left - Right, Block - Right.
How do I sneak a punch in on that dash?
One way is to be an incredible boxer, slip then strike like lightning.  Maybe move into the opponent, as described in Rory Miller's ""Infighting.""  Throw the opponent with some 'Chinese Fast Wrestling For Fighting,'  or capture with some Chin Na as described in Yang Jwing Mings excellent creations on the subject.
Another method - the simplest, most direct -  is the application of skills described in 'Attack the Attack.'
I think that the most direct methods for striking on the half beat are those described by Burger in this DVD.
Let me explain.
Moving into an opponent is scary; only a superior fighter can do it without fear.  Executing a throw or capture (with a freeze, optimally) requires a massive skill disparity between aggressors.  Passing a strike can be dangerous in marital arts because you give your opponent a free limb past your skull.  Blocking (read controlling) a limb and striking in the same movement, well that is just drilling.  And simple drilling.  No complex motor skills.  No need to rely on superior training.  Just train the movement (singular)!
Another view:
You throw a block/strike and your opponent steps aside or blocks?  No harm.  You step in and the opponent is superior?  Harm.  You try to execute a capture or wrestling technique?  Your opponent may strike head, genitals, or lock.  Great harm!
If you would like a method for striking on the half-beat, or just defending, then this DVD is well worth your money and time!",1516406400,2,1766,4.620578778135048
8758113,5,B01E9EN9I2,"Excellent instruction video. I especially liked the importance placed on foot placement and movement. I also especially liked the example of training for self-defense to learning to tying one's shoes, you do it until you no longer have to think about it you just do it. All the techniques are simple and direct and very workable. I highly recommend this dvd.",1515801600,,358,4.885245901639344
8758114,4,B01E9EN9I2,"""Attack the Attack"" is a tour de force of striking methods for those interested in understanding the differences of most mainstream methods.  Mr. Burger is clearly a great striker and his knowledge of the nuances of various styles is impressive.  If you want to understand martial arts striking methods on a deeper level put this video in your library.""
