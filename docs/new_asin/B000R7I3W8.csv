3880567,3,B000R7I3W8,"Interestingly enough, I got this release more for the Sonny Chiba film.  While I couldn't stomach the maudlin and overblown Whitney Houston remake, I was genuinely curious, after enjoying some other Chiba films (Bullet Train in particular is a highly recommended entry) to see how this one went.  And while it is a huge improvement over the lousy Hollywood pastiche that followed, it's rather more dull than I would have hoped or expected as a longtime fan of Japanese action cinema (both chambara/samurai and 'modern day' 70's crime flicks).

On the other hand, Sister Street Fighter was great, and a real gem of its type - highly recommended for fans of the recent Pinky Violence set and films like Zero Woman: Red Handcuffs.  Good stuff.",1254096000,3,740,4.896
3880568,5,B000R7I3W8,This was the first double feature I have bought under this title and I must say it was the start of a new film viewing habit. I bought a 20 film box set labled Grindhouse as well and I couldn't even see the people in the films due to a horrible tape to dvd transfer. If you're looking for the quality to accompany the stink of such rotten awesome movie cheese then this is the Grindhouse to get with.,1208044800,2,400,4.075949367088608

The plot revolves around L Hng-Lng ( Li Kry), the female martial artist of the title. When her brother L Wn-Qng is kidnapped by drug lords, she seeks revenge. The drug lord's colorful collection of ""killers"" includes a toga-clad group of Thai Boxers called the ""Amazons Seven"", along with representatives of almost every martial art. Hng-Lng breaks into the drug lord's compound with the help of Seiichi Hibiki (Sonny Chiba) and other members of the Shorinji Kempo dojo. After all of his minions are defeated, the drug lord himself battles Hng-Lng, wearing a steel claw in imitation of Han, the villain from Enter the Dragon (1973).[1]

First let me give the pros of the film. The plot is simple and easy to follow, the female main star is like able and has some level of screen presence. Unlike other female martial artist Etsuko Shihomi is trained in martial arts and stunt work as well and her fighting ability shows up in the film. She is my favorite female fighter and is far above the rest. The film also star Sonny Chiba also one of my favorite martial artist as well kicking butt as usual. The film has a of fighting if you want action then this is the right place. I love the back ground music for the film and it has great themes that play through the film. The fighting is easy to follow and the movie has good camera angles and camera work. The film has a lot of unique quirky characters for the main character to fight.

Now the cons. Okay first of all the film does have a decent amount of nudity. There is at least one scene of a rape that goes by quickly. The film is violent and has some blood and a few people getting stabbed or severely injured. The story line is not horrible by any means,but is standard for the time period it came out and is very simply. If you are looking for a deep story line then look some place else. While Sony Chiba is in the film he does not play his character from the Street fighter films. I loved the weird enemy characters,but some people might find them off putting. Some of the more interesting fighters shown in a brief scene of the film do not even fight the main character. There is one striking female martial artist that does not show up later on in the film. I kept waiting for them to fight. The main villain is some what uninteresting and uninspired. One key issues is what version of the film you purchase. Besides the main character played by Etsuko Shihomi many of the other characters were uninteresting and I wish they had done better in that aspect. The amazon video version of the film only comes in a dubbed version that has not been remastered and looks decent,but is inferior to other DVD version of the film that have been released which are remastered and give you the option of picking subbed or dubbed and is the best way to watch the film. I have both versions and the remastered version in the sister street fighter collection dvd box set is the way to go.

In conclusion it is a good film with lost of fighting by perhaps the best female film fighter I have ever seen on screen. Not a perfect film,but if you want to see a solid fighting film with a like able actor and don't need a Shakespearean story line then give this film a try. I have my review in video form if you want to check it out.",1514592000,,3702,4.83596214511041
8358155,3,B000R7I3W8,"If you're a martial arts movie connoisseur, this is worth a watch.  What a gem.  If you're not, it's kind of goofy.  I had to laugh many times at the silly phrases and fake fighting.  It has like every cliche in the book.  Perhaps in 1974 it was original material.  It has an amazing female heroine, such a strong character that I'm surprised it wasn't more famous back in the day for touting women's rights (in the 70's when bra burning was a thing).  It was fun and funny.",1491609600,,474,4.258426966292135
