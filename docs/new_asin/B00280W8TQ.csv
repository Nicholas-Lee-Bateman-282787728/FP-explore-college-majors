8355380,5,B00280W8TQ,"2 Dvds for the price of 1:  1 is a dvd that attempts to explain the dragon myth by examining different real reptiles who have dragon characteristics, and the other is a dvd about what happened to the giant crocodiles:  Do they still exist?  This dvd concludes they still do.  Very enjoyable and informative with 1 dvd examining in depth the Komodo Dragon and the other one examining both the Nile and Salt Water Crocodiles.  If you like giant reptiles, you'll enjoy this!",1297814400,,471,4.626506024096385
8355381,5,B00280W8TQ,I watched this on TV and knew I had to get it for my grandson. He loved the show and he has a great interest in animals and nature!,1264982400,,131,3.5517241379310347
8355382,5,B00280W8TQ,"Romulus Whitaker proves to be as engaging a character as his name might
suggest - a dedicated dragon hunter with a gift for communication.
This DVD turned out to be double value,  as in almost two hours of
high quality video,  it covers two related fields - ""The Dragon Chronicles"" and ""Supersize Crocs"".  This is a valuable addition to my
own collection,  and is highly recommended for entertaining and
educational family entertainment.  ? A worthy successor to the sadly
missed Steve Irwin?",1246924800,,492,4.951219512195122
