Need I say more? Better when it is a prison girl movie. but hey, that's just me. This is an African-American cheese fest filmed in Atlanta. Predictable and poorly written and produced.

8146812,1,B000ION2F8,"Some movies you just don't want to admit, in public, to having seen. THE SORORITY is one of those movies. It's not that THE SORORITY tells a story we've seen a dozen times already, or that the script is pathetic or that the acting is even worse, or even that the effects are cheap and silly. With THE SORORITY it's all of those things.

College-bound Isabella has decided to attend the college where her sister had been a student until her apparent suicide the year before. Isabella isn't convinced Elizabeth hung herself so, suspecting foul play, she decides to follow her sister's footsteps as closely as she can, including enrolling in the same classes and pledging the same sorority.

The only problem is, this sorority is full of devil worshippers. Another problem is, those students who refuse to join their ranks turn up burned to death. Isabella doesn't want to worship the devil, and now that she's discovered how her sister really died, her next objective is to bring down the satanic cult, or die trying.

Like I said, we've seen this movie before. Several times, I'm sure.

So what sets THE SORORITY apart from all the other evil sorority/fraternity movies? Nothing. Absolutely jack.

So the story is old news. What about the acting? Riiiiiiiiiiiiight. Acting. That's what they call that? Funny, I thought acting was supposed to convey a sense of realism, believability, suspension of disbelief. This movie felt more like I was watching a first-week rehearsal or, at times, a table reading, but with blocking. The only one who even seemed to be trying was L. Michael Burt who played Isabella's boyfriend Cal. He had a slightly commanding presence and a gave a certain innocent charm to his character. But for the most part, Burt's talent was drowned out in a sea of bleh!

The script was also a shambles. Director/Screenwriter Bodie Norton tried to capture the ""urban"" dialect of a mostly-black college and a 99%-female cast, but what came out was a bad parody instead. How many clichs can we fit into one script? And when you add bad writing to bad acting, the result is even worse.

Let's mention the effects, shall we? While THE SORORITY was copyrighted in 2005, the digital effects looked more like 1983. Then again, according to one site, the budget for this movie was $700, so take from that what you will. I don't know if it was really that low, but judging by what I saw on the screen, I wouldn't be a bit surprised to find out that's right.

THE SORORITY runs 104 minutes and I detested every single one of them. There wasn't one moment of film I didn't cringe through. There wasn't a line of dialogue I didn't want to hang my head in shame over. Nor was there a single effects shot that didn't embarrass me for having witnessed.

Shame on Bodie Norton and everyone involved in making this movie. I'm all for making magic on almost no money, if the makers are truly capable of such a thing, but everything about this movie screams student film, and I'm talking student film from a D-student. C- at best.

In its defense, I do have to admit that, while THE SORORITY is a bad bad bad movie, the story at least made sense. And that's more than I can say for most of the works of Todd Sheets, so if nothing else, THE SORORITY's got THAT in its favor. That's not enough to make it a good movie, but it's a start, right?",1342483200,,3335,4.580536912751678
