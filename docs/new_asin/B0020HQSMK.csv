3830458,3,B0020HQSMK,"I was once in an art history tutorial when a fellow piped up and asked whether the three legged stool the Madonna was sitting on was symbolic of the Holy Trinity. I recall the tutor looking politely doubtful while the rest of the class fell about cackling unkindly at the poor try-hard. His crime: striving and over-reaching to see meaning in a purely incidental relationship. Well, maybe it was incidental - maybe he was right, who knows? - but I laughed all the same.

Nevertheless, his disposition would stand that chap in good stead should he ever chance upon Carlos Reygadas' Silent Light. This film admits of - requires, even - an over-reaching to see meaning, and as such will not be everyone's cup of tea. I'm still not sure whether it was mine.

To be sure, there is a certain sort of buff to whom Silent Light will appeal greatly - he who is rejoices in straining to unpick a film-maker's message will be in heaven: such industry is obligatory since Carlos Reygadas has opted to communicate his message in the most eliptical way. Reygadas is, you see, an auteur (a fact which will fill you with glee or despair, depending on the significance you see imbued in things like three legged stools).

In many places, the Meaning of Silent Light is to be found not in dialogue (there isn't much) nor its delivery (the actors - real Mennonites - aren't professionally trained, and frequently may as well be reading out technical manuals for all their performances convey) nor, really, in what happens in the film (in fairness, after a *very* slow build up, things do happen), but rather how it is *seen* to happen.

There is meaning, that is, in frame composition. It is significant that the camera itself is often visibly part of the film - not just in camera position and width of angle (though they are frequently telling) but in the existence of lens flare, in that the camera itself pushes long grass off screen when tracking a character at ankle level, that its lens is spattered by water cascading off a tree and when a wide-angled tracking shot noticeably fish-eyes the parallel horizontals of a building. In a more careless film maker, you'd assume these were continuity errors, or at the most purely incidental relationships. Not, I suspect, here. There is a long slow shot (indeed, there are hundreds of long slow shots, but one in particular) forward out the windscreen of Johan's pickup - itself doubling as a visible lens - as he drives down a dirt road. When he turns off the road, the truck pivots around the camera as if it is on a gyroscope, the camera continuing to point on its original bearing, only now pointing at the side of Johan's face. The effect is that the viewer cannot help but be aware that there is a movie camera sitting on the passenger seat in Johan's truck. Cinematography 101 would teach that first principle of filmmaking is to create quite the opposite impression.

Not here: The lens constantly intrudes, and when it doesn't we see through windows, through windshields, through ajar doors into private affairs. We are always aware we are intruding.

What to be drawn from this? We are conscious, always, of the aperture - that we are observers, voyeurs in an intensely private world (an extramarital love affair) inside an intensely private world (a devoutly religious family) inside an intensely private world (a Mennonite comunity) and, like the camera, we shouldn't be there.

Profound, I suppose, but I'm not sure what finally to draw from it. I feel much the same way about the film as a whole.

There's something clever about this, but it's too clever: self-consciously self-conscious, and tiring - divining which production artefacts bear messages and which do not is hard, and exhausting. In many places I gave up.

I didn't understand, for example, the significance of a momentarily lost child, discovered safe and sound and watching an old recording of a Jacques Brel TV special, in French, in a van. Why? And why a long dead Belgian folk-singer? Could a director who takes such care to speak via lens flares and camera angles have been so careless to throw in such a scene apropos nothing? And what to make of the end, wherein a studiously realist film suddenly goes surreal, apparently capable only of figurative interpretation?

Some high brow critics loved this film - the one through whose recommendation I came to be watching it, Nigel Andrews in the Financial Times, was so taken by its luminescence to declare it ""the impossible made possible by grace and faith"" - but for me it was too empty for that. Much has been read into the celebrated opening and closing shots but, again, I couldn't quite see the cleverness (and as you'll notice, I'm prepared to be as creative/fanciful as the next chap in my interpretation), and so let dusk fall not that much wiser than I'd been when daylight broke a couple of hours previously.

3830459,2,B0020HQSMK,"... is the director doing things that mainstream directors wouldn't do, but apparently only for its own sake.  I had high expectations going in.  But I don't really care how many critics praise this film, or how good the director's sense of composition may be (and I admit that it is), the pace is excruciatingly slow and the acting is generally awful, which ultimately undermines the entire film.  Period.  There is a fine line between using the lingering camera to capture/express certain ideas and simply engaging in self-indulgence, and in this instance, the director crossed that line so many times in this film that by the time I reached the controversial ending, I just didn't care anymore.  If you are looking for a thought-provoking film that is actually worthy of the praise it has received, a slowly-paced endeavor that also offers stunning cinematography, genuinely interesting characters, and no easy answers, I would instead recommend 'The White Ribbon.'",1275868800,6,968,5.140127388535032
3830460,5,B0020HQSMK,"This film acts like a purgation of the junk-fest sensation and clich language and plots of our normal cinema. It takes us out of the real world and puts our senses through a sieve, through a habit of perfection,distilling an uncreated light. There is a movement in world cinema, to utilise non-professional actors and natural light together. The opening (and closing) shots open us up to a slow action shot almost in real time from constellations in a black sky to dawn shots of the rising sun,with all the attendant sounds of crickets,cicadas and cattle lowing. This is a filtered and idealised human nature set in a Mennonite community of Plautdiesh -speaking people who are attuned to the season's cycles, through cattle farming and crop harvesting. The film is composed of beautiful tableaus of widescreen natural vistas,earth and sky meeting on wide horizons, well captured on the many driving sequences,backed up with a soundscape of waving grass and trees,crickets,birds and running water. Johan is sitting with his wife and six children giving silent grace with a ticking clock. Beneath the harmonious surface there is tension between the couple. His wife Esther takes the children out and he breaks down in tears when alone. He has been having a two year affair with Marianne,another Mennonite (single)female. The imagery in this film induces a kind of trance-like contemplation. His infatuated mood expresses itself through him driving round his friend Zackaria to some raunchy music. He goes on to meet Marianne in a long kissing scene which ends in them making love. He is well supported by his friend and father,who thinks it is fate or the devil's work but does not condemn him. Johan thinks every man makes his own fate. We cut to a beautiful scene of the family bathing together. In such scenes the inner peace in the community is brought out. But his wife who he has told of his infidelity is close to tears as she loves him just as he does her,but he feels God intended Marianne for him. We see the family at a cornharvest in some stunning scenes and the machine moving through the fields of corn. Johan,Esther and the kids say silent grace by their pick-up.

Johan feels torn and tells his wife he has to see Marianne,so she tells him to take the children to the dentists too. He engineers it so that a man looks after the kids in his camper van with it's own TV set they can watch. He steals away and makes passionate love with Marianne for the last time. Marianne saying she is at her happiest and saddest since `Peace is stronger than love' and expresses pity for Esther. In a bleak driving scene in the pouring rain Esther asks to get out to vomit. She runs from the car to a tree and breaks down holding it. She has a sense of loss:she used to be a part of everything,fully alive next to Johan. Now heartbroken,she dies of heart attack. She is next laid up in a coffin after being washed by her mother while her family say their last good-byes. The community sing mournful hymns. He talks to Marianne saying he'd do anything to turn back time. Marianne asks to see Esther and tears drop onto Esther's cheek as Marianne kisses her. What follows is a kind of resurrection episode,but is probably metaphorical,a wish fulfilment happy ending. You can either reject or accept this ending but remember this has a religious setting.",1272153600,3,3349,4.715017064846417

I don't know who made this, I don't know what he was trying to achieve, and I don't know what it was based on or anything else pertaining to what the director was trying to portray (the film did not illuminate any of this too me either, unless its theme was boredom and suppression). But I think a movie should stand on its own without anyone having to have any sort of credentials to understand the point of the film, or even appreciate it.

With all that said, this movie stunk. It was slow, badly acted, empty of any real content, and not at all anything I would wish to be a voyeur to. At the end, (SPOILER ALERT), his dead wife is brought back to life by his mistress' tears? WTF? And do we get to see any sort of reaction to this miracle from her husband or other family members? Of course not. That would actually require some sense of creativity, or intelligent dialog. What a cop out.

I hated this movie. The whole scene in the water with the kids was just awful as well. What group of children would just sit solemnly in a pool of water and do nothing. No splashing, no giggling, no fun. Give me a break! I think one kid tries to show another how to splash and we see a few meager smiles. To me the whole scene felt like a forced attempt at appearing ""artsy"" or ""enigmatic"".

It has a certain grace, story, look, authenticity, and pureness that all make this film so unique and wonderful. This is a love story that is subtle, without melodramatic over acting, but the message is strong and vibrant. I can't really describe it in words very well, it's the kind of movie that really transports you to and makes you feel like you are there, really emphasizing on the characters and space. It makes you feel that the director REALLY knows what hes doing, and that he got it right. Technically there are some scenes that make you think, ""how did they do that, that was amazing"", or ""that shot was awesome"". It's a drama, yet there are some little funny moments because it feels so real, and just like real life, funny things happen even when were sad.

3830464,3,B0020HQSMK,"Carlos Reygadas has made 3 features, Japon, Battle in Heaven, and this film.  I disliked Japon for the reasons I disliked Silent Light (I didn't see Battle in Heaven).  Reygadas's films seem like they're artistic on the surface, but they're shallow exercises in style and don't have that deep feeling and sincerity of the masters he's trying to emulate (Tarkovsky and Dreyer are the main ones he's attempting to emulate).  This film is essentially a remake/update of Carl Th. Dreyer's greatest work Ordet.  Reygadas changed the location and topography, but anyone who has seen Ordet will recognise the story arc here.

The film has some excellent cinematography, some good performances (especially by the main character's father, who looks like Johannes from Ordet, which was probably not lost on Reygadas), but overall, the film is a fraud with an ""arbitrary"" miracle thrown in at the end.  The miracle in Dreyer's Ordet was truly stunning, and it made sense in the context of that film.  Dreyer's Ordet also flowed very well.  It was slow and stylized (it wouldn't be a Dreyer film if it wasn't), but Dreyer was such a magnificent artist and filmmaker that the slow style of his fits his work perfectly.  Silent Light, by contrast, is plodding and uneven, and the miracle scene (which uses some of the same framing as Ordet does) feels like it was thrown in just to juice things up.  While it is interesting when you watch it, and you feel somewhat moved by it, you feel cheated after the film is over, like you're just being manipulated by Reygadas into believing you've seen a deeply spiritual film.  You haven't.  Reygadas is just preying on the viewer's sense of spirituality, and that's why you think you've seen something profound.  It's a shallow attempt at an art film, much like Reygadas's first film, Japon.

The film is not a complete disaster.  You get to see the Mennonite culture in Mexico (they speak a dialect of German in this film, and there is some Spanish spoken later), the opening and closing shots are really beautiful, the hymns they sing at the funeral are very moving, but the film is ultimately a shallow manipulation, not an art film.",1253145600,9,2164,4.8108108108108105
3830465,2,B0020HQSMK,"Michael Ondaatje once said that there is a limit to what films can do in getting below the surface of things. This might well be said of Silent Light. On first reflection it seems a mystery how this film, the third by Carlos Reygadas, actually manages to work some magic on the viewer without recourse to establishing conventional feelings for its characters. There is no script here which allows a way of rendering people in any depth whatsoever; dialogue is spare, relaying information in brief clusters of signifying words. ""This is the last time... Peace -- is stronger than love... Poor Esther,"" a character says after lovemaking. The very fact that dialogue relays information stiltedly, instead of communicating in a more natural way, is a stylistic attenuation which doesn't build a convincing case for itself in the course of the film, though eventually a bare minimum of dialogue does enable us to discern the basic dilemma here: the issues a married man faces in keeping a mistress (or not) in a specific sectarian community.

On the other hand, within this sense of economy there is a vital sense of how light affects appearances -- all the varying qualities of light as those which in themselves might generate emotion. But that this happens to the extent which is fulfilling as an experience, as many critics seem to think, is questionable. Here, characters function as IMAGES of people -- rather than AS fully-dimensional people -- just as trees and landscapes function in most films as images of trees and landscapes, that is, without further requirements. There is a kind of purity resulting in all of this, and it's as if a mystery of the generic (not archetype) is revealed: as if each image appears as a pure template -- of itself: this IS the image of trees in a field at dusk, this IS the image of a woman sitting across from a man in a passenger seat of a car, this IS the image of a man alone at a table crying... There is a self-consciousness at play in the sensitivity of the cinematographic light, and thus a heightened sense of physical presence. And the performances by non-professionals are rendered in a way which recalls Bresson, but with a more pronounced distancing. Yet at the same time, and unlike Bresson, the characters just don't register as fully inhabiting a world.

Having said all that, I wonder what connection Mr. Reygadas estimated for his project with respect to Carl Theodor Dreyer's film Ordet, which appears the intentional factor in making his own, largely according to the conjunction of the same main event (a miracle) in both films. Silent Light is actually only a very slight homage to Ordet (shared miracle notwithstanding) for all the supposed similarities many critics have wished to concoct between the films. It seems hard to reasonably qualify Reygadas's re-approach to this ""miracle of faith"" (not to reveal it here), which one had no trouble accepting from Dreyer, who was a man of deeply religious sensibility -- a sensibility generally and notably absent in Reygadas, a crucial point which leaves the comparison of both men itself wanting.

A rather important omission in general from the critical assessments of the film, is the remembrance that in making Ordet, Dreyer did adapt a play -- through which the matter of revealing the inner states and spiritual conditions of the characters depend on words and the nuances of meaning in language; we are communicative, expressive beings (urban or rural), after all. One of Dreyer's supreme gifts was to compliment the emotional weave of the ongoing verbal exchange between characters with visual compositions and lighting, illuminating what was outside of the spoken. This perfectly complimentary method (one even more refined in his last film, Gertrud, also based on a play) -- between word and image -- exemplifies the interdependence out of which the meaning of his work arises.

In contrast, Reygadas favors the laconic approach of images over words, and has difficulty producing the same depth of total response from the viewer. If he did indeed intend to seek out the inner lives of his characters, albeit in a way apart from language, he hasn't achieved much more than a surface of imagistic mystique, wherein things tend to signify only themselves (as ""templates"") without deeper resonance. On balance, however, it is notable that there is a distancing due to the subtle stylistic effects one can feel even when watching Dreyer's film; a feeling of being at a remove from the events unfolding, even while one senses being suspended in a spiritual dimension, yet in the end, one which still somehow feels like *real* everyday life. This unusual effect also seems to be present in Silent Light.

Interestingly, when the miracle of the former film appears here, it is not a moving event in and of itself; and yet paradoxically, it effectively becomes such -- due to the exquisitely clear, lucid visual presentation: the transference, of the technical qualities of modulated light, upon subjects, into a ""miraculous appearance,"" is total. The face of the smiling or crying one is the the face illuminated and transfigured by this light -- the entire process of which is ostensibly the real subject of Reygadas's film.

But in Dreyer's cinema, the mutually dependent transference of meaning between words and images makes for a more deeply satisfying experience, far beyond mere technical control of the medium. Next to Ordet, Silent Light will seem ever more slight the more critics try to inflate tenuous connections between the two. One is even tempted to apply Mahler's dictum that ""interesting is easy, beautiful is difficult."" Apropos of the ravishing images Reygadas conjures, however, one might go further here and say that the beautiful truly appears easy, but nonetheless a deeper, more rewarding interest lies elsewhere.",1252368000,9,5847,5.0041109969167525

Not so much to tell a story as to let a story tell itself, to let human being and nature show itself in all its strangeness and wonder.

The opening scene of this film is among the most powerful I've seen.  On the one hand it is unsettling and disorienting to be cast into the darkness of the open sky and twirled slowly with no sense of where we stand in space or time.  On the other hand, this incredible opening shot serves to orient us as viewers.  Before it is clear what is going on, that it is early morning and we are witnessing the emergence of light from the darkness, the sounds of crickets and a breeze and the groaning of the cattle begin to ground the film, to place what is to take place in and among the natural rhythms of the Earth.

The next image, however, serves to remind us that here on Earth we people tend to govern our lives according to a different scale than that which operates in nature, the rhythm of the sun and moon and stars, of day and night, of the seasons, of birth and growth and death.  We pattern our lives after the artificial scales measured by the clock, by the calendar that tells us when to celebrate and the laws that tell us when to pay taxes, by the ordinances and regulations and habits and customs and prejudices that tell us when to get up when to go to work, how and when to follow our desires, how and with whom we can share our lives and feelings.

What impresses me about this film is that nothing seems contrived.  Nothing seems to be there simply to be looked at, the camera does not feel like either a voyeur or a judge.  A scene of intimacy is not there to arouse the viewer, or to create a sense of vicarious satisfaction -- like all real sex (not the fake sex that sells products or pornography), it is awkward and estranging to watch, the scene reminds us that sex is a strange thing, like all real sex it means something only for the participant.  Once again, Gilberto Perez writes that the difficulty of engaging with the real in film is that ""the closer the engagement with reality, the more difficult the task of giving it form and meaning ... [but] the risk of incoherence must be run, unruly reality met on a ground close enough to its own for its energies and its resistance to come into play. Only by contending with its resistance can a filmmaker derive from its energies, and arrange into expressive structures, a vividness and force that tell on the screen."".

I can understand some directors' works that project some artistry, convoluted meaning, and mystery, but this one lost me completely.

First of all, it is hardly a Spanish film...  ok, so they lived in Mexico, but there is little about and of Mexico here.  Ok....  and what about LINGERING shots?  I have seen some directors use the 'lingering"" shot style, but this was excessive.  Especially in the opening, from dark to light?

It took me about 40 minutes to find a storyline.  Yes,  man is interested in another woman, juggles the emotions of this extramarital affair.  Plus, he had about 6 kids, I believe.  But, these lingering shots.....  I said,  watch this ""kiss"" go on for 10 minutes.  And, this was painfully slow, no soundrack, which is fine with me, but sooooo  slow!

This reminded me of those Swedish films I have often watched.  Religious themes,  strange happenings, etc.  And I am not one for ""strange"" endings with religious themes driving it.

Some will complain that the pacing is too slow, but there is a purpose to the pace :  life is long, and it requires endurance. The cinematography is quite good. The dialog, what little of it there is, is weakly written. (While I don't fault the scarcity of words, they should have been powerfully deployed.) The main topic, adultery, could have been explored better as cheating on God rather than on a spouse; but instead, it was rendered in its common banality.

Other issues [no spoilers] :  the grandfather had a powerful opportunity to advise his adult child about poor choices, but rather, applauds the choices. (My wife almost walked out at this point.) Grampa, who is the actual biological father of one of the lead actors, delivered a wooden performance.  But he could have been given a powerfully simple line in responding to his child's confession of a  ""mistaken choice"" for a spouse, which would have outshined his lack-luster acting :   are your children a mistake, too?  The cheater:  cruel, in being so candid? The confessor:  why is his counsel so utterly lame? (Anabaptist theology places great importance on the duty of fellow worshippers - and of a community itself - to hold each other accountable, and to come to the aid of those who are tempted to stray from upright living; yet the film incredibly would almost have us believe that the affair was a total secret!)  The kiss:  was she a witch, or a profoundly spiritual lover?  We are left to wonder if the cheater will yet continue to pursue her!  (We are given no reason to believe that the cheater, who accepted blame, has been healed.)

Mennonite culture, while very diverse today, is nearly unrecognizable in this film, aside from their wardrobes. Yes, they are ""other"" to most of us, but their otherness is not helpful to us in understanding the topic of adultery. (I've never had ties with any anabaptist denomination, but I did study at a prominent divinity school.)  I admire the director's effort, and will watch for additional work from him, as I think he has strong aptitude for bringing powerful issues into the light for examination.  I just wish he had probed deeper on this one.",1421193600,,2280,4.758269720101781

8348527,3,B0020HQSMK,"Post Tenebras Lux and Japon are some of my favorite films. Battle in Heaven is very hard to find outside of buying the DVD, and I watched Silent Light online. SL is okay: it's beautifully filmed, but languorously slow. Like, slower than slow. But despite the over 2 hour running time and the rather amazing opening sunrise and closing sunset, there's not much of a story here except for a Mennonite man in Mexico having an affair and how it affects people around him. Mennonites in Mexico speaking Plattdeutsch yet having characteristics of the Mexican culture around them (music, attire, etc) is interesting, but I didn't find it as absorbing as Reygadas did. I do appreciate the film from a linguistic standpoint, as I didn't learn about Plattdeutsch until I was about 40; it's an interesting hybrid of Dutch and German. I like Reygadas' hallmarks: hyperreal sound design, clear deep focus cinematography, on location filming, subtle surrealness, the warmth and coldness of humanity. But I found these techniques work far better in Japon and PTL. I like how Reygadas challenges the viewer, like a Harmony Korine film does. Reygadas knows how to let the silence in between notes speak volumes, and his almost documentary-like films have this kind of menacing, steady, molasses-in-winter slow pace to them that is refreshing in today's ADD culture, but I had a hard time connecting with this film. I once traveled by Amtrak to the Pacific Northwest from the Bay Area, and the whole train car was full of Mennonites coming back from Mexico. Once was carrying a cabbage. One had some kind of wound on his lip, from perhaps farming or shaving. Even the babies were dressed like Mennonite women. They ate Cup o Noodle from the snack car. THAT to me was far more interesting than a Mennonite community in Mexico and a man who's torn between two women. Reygadas has said that Battle in Heaven is his problem child film, but I find Silent Light problematic. It justn't isn't compelling nor very interesting. It's worth seeing, but not one of his stronger films.",1417824000,,2054,4.854700854700854
8348528,3,B0020HQSMK,"I wish this film had been able to emotionally invest us into the lives of these characters because then this would have been a masterpiece. However, because of the stoicism of the main characters - with brief punctuation of grief - it's very hard to understand and relate to what is going on inside these people.

In a way this emotional distance is quite beautiful because when characters do feel grief it seems to happen either in a quiet room where the person breaking down feels rather insignificant or strange or, later in the film, the force of emotional pain actually kills them. I kept wondering if Reygadas was trying to make some sort of statement about the futility of our emotions and how fragile we are when we experience great conflict and pain.

Perhaps that's why the majority of the film takes place between the stopping of the kitchen clock and the restarting of it. I wondered if Johan was performing some sort of experiment that would allow him to see what might happen because of his actions. He's always looking at his watch as if he's the only one keeping time in the universe until his father restarts the clock and sets the universe in motion again.

Still, the whole film is a bit too obscure and I'm not convinced Reygadas knew exactly what he wanted to say. Much time is spent on lingering moments of beauty and quietness but those scenes are never backed up by any emotional scaffolding - it feels a bit hollow; pretty but almost empty. The only character in the film who I felt invested in was Johan's father, a man with a permanent, devious smile and bright, lively eyes that seem to see only joy even when remembering pain. I felt as if this old man knew something we didn't, and perhaps that's why he is chosen to start the clock again, but there's just not enough to go on from what the film gives us to make any definite statement.",1406332800,,1866,4.498525073746313
8348529,4,B0020HQSMK,"I'm confused about everything that happened after the couple left home.  I always accept artistic license for symbolism that merely suggests what has happened inside the main characters' hearts and minds, but ""in addition"" to concrete facts rather than ""instead of.""  It's difficult for the viewer follow such intense, slow, dry literalism with a 50/50 coin toss of hallucination or a miracle from God.  It frustratingly deprives the viewer of evidence needed to make a guess.",1369699200,,476,5.2368421052631575
8348530,4,B0020HQSMK,"Johan and his family are Mennomites from nothern Mexico. But defying the law of God and men, Johan falls in love with another woman.

This simple but haunting story will convey us to an amazing journey where the staring gaze of the camera and its slow-paced motion will show you the times and lives of these families.

It's undeniable the influence of Tarkovsky along the film goes on. Poetic, contemplative and gratifying all the way through.",1292198400,,443,4.815789473684211
