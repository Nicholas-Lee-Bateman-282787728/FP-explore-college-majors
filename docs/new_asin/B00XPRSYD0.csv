8716418,1,B00XPRSYD0,What I've been able to watch of the show it's been good but the quality of the DVDs are poor.  Season 1 skipped so much I missed several episodes.  Decided to move on to season 2 which is no better.  This time the DVD froze.  At first I thought it was my equipment but I'm happy to say it is not.  The DVDs are at fault.  Maybe one day these shows will be Netflex.,1483574400,,364,3.8513513513513513
