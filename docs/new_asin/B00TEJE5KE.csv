I was crying, because he was so funny. Then it turns into a real story.it isn't an expensive film, but it is great and the acting is good . The jazz music is perfect. You have love, a friend , family  and an acting career.",1530403200,,363,4.338235294117647

8701341,5,B00TEJE5KE,"Refreshing and highly entertaining. Great to see a fresh perspective on story-telling. Particularly exciting to see storylines that are ""real"". This gem of a movie combines pathos and comedy with a raw reality that makes independent films such a fulfilling genre. I'll be watching the key people involved with this production closely for their next venture.",1425600000,2,357,5.392857142857143
