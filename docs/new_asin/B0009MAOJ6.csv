8063218,5,B0009MAOJ6,"After taking care of the problem at school, Sana is focused on the root of the problem. Akito's sister treats him like a he's a monster. After doing some research, Sana learns that Akito's Mother died giving birth to him. As it turns out, Sana is doing a movie with a similar story line. She works it out so that the Hayama family has to sit and watch the movie together. On top of all this, Sana also has some troubles with Rei. He's been avoiding her lately, it seems to have something to do with Sana's co-star.

This is a pretty good volume. The drama gets going pretty good, and the comedy is still really fun. Laura Bailey's voice acting is my favorite part of this series. She does an excellent job. This is a one of a kind series, one that needs to be seen. There is something here for every anime fan.",1359072000,,810,4.225806451612903
8063219,3,B0009MAOJ6,"Hi!  In this volume of Kodocha, it centers more around Sana trying to get Akito and his family to respect each other a bit more and start acting like a family.  It also has a bit of Rei and his ex-girlfriend (their pasts and stuff) and how Sana deals with that.

Out of the first 6 DVDs (the only ones I've seen so far,) this is my least favorite.  It's still good, but focuses on Rei's past relationship a bit more than I'd like (although it's a necessary evil for developing plot and characters.)  That portion was a bit dull compared to the rest of the series.

Let's start with the good!  Episodes 5 and 8 were my favorites.  Sana tries to cheer up Akito and get him to start socializing.  His reactions to that are a bit surprising, which gets Sana freaking out for the rest of episode 5 and over-imaginative with what Akito might try doing to himself.  She finds that her movie coming out on T.V. would be a good way to explain to Akito's family how they're acting.  Episode 6 deals with that, and has many serious (but interesting and not at all dull) moments with Akito's family.  Episode 7 has to do with Rei and his ex mostly, and the best parts about this are how it affects characters for episode 8.
8 has a good confrontation between Akito, Tsuyoshi, and Rei.  It's funny and interesting.  Meanwhile Sana is getting overly jealous of Rei's ex.  The ending of episode 8 has a field trip, which reverts back to the good humor found in the earlier part of the series again.

Overall, this is a good DVD, but some of the drama can lose some people's interest since it differs so much from the previous DVD at those points.  It shows that Sana has to deal with real situations sometimes though, and it is necessary for later humor.  My 8-year-old daughter really liked the part with Akito's family, but had NO interest in any parts with Rei and his issues (which is half the DVD.)  I think adult viewers may find those parts more interesting though.

I really liked it, (better after the 2nd viewing though.)
It's still fun at times, but definitely tones up some drama.",1218672000,,2077,4.4015748031496065
