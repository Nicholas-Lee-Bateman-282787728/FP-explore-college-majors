2382894,5,B000A8AX0Y,"I bought this for my kids (11,9,7,4) for Christmas.  They love to laugh, especially my oldest, and this video accomplished that with flying colors. Personally I don't think either of the two hosts are funny at all, but the video clips are hilarious and more than make up for having to listen to the stupid non-humor of the hosts.",1168300800,9,329,4.576271186440678
2382895,4,B000A8AX0Y,"The newer episode with Tom Bergeron is better than the other two older ones with Bob Sagat - who I think is a freakin idiot, by the way. As soon as you get a few good laughs from a handful of videos, Bob's embarrasingly awful humor gets you all ticked off again. I recommend hitting the mute button when Bob is on the screen - you'll enjoy the videos a lot more.

By the way, Tom Bergeron rules. He has made AFV the best it has ever been.",1149552000,11,438,3.977272727272727
2382896,5,B000A8AX0Y,"This product looks awesome! This is my favorite tv show and Tom is an awesome host. That Eric guy who wrote the other review, obviously has no sense of humor. Cant wait to buy.",1147478400,2,176,4.205882352941177
2382897,3,B000A8AX0Y,"These DVDs weren't too different from the usual episodes of AFV you'd watch regularly. In fact, there was no subtitles/captions option (some of the audio - kids' esplly - needs captions).

The best-of-best contest had more commentary/discussion/etc than funny videos.",1142380800,2,267,5.675

2382953,3,B000A8AX0Y,"While this DVD is a delightful selection of 2 quality AFV shows, the shows are not - as described - hosted by Bob Saget.  I was looking specifically for Saget shows and was disappointed to find this a Bergeron DVD.  *sigh*",1388707200,6,222,4.390243902439025

2382955,2,B000A8AX0Y,"Again a miss-labeled video on behalf of Funniest Home Video in order to boost sales to those who are expecting the host to be  Tom Bergeron.  Nothing against those who like the sarcastic, non-witty, time wasting Bob Saget, but I hate having to fast-forward through his monolog just to get to the otherwise good video clips.",1384300800,,323,4.75
2382956,5,B000A8AX0Y,This is a very funny DVD featuring three very funny Christmas  episodes of Americas Funniest Home Videos. Theres funny Santa Clauss mishaps putting Christmas decorations up and a whole lot more and its funny. You should get it. Merry Christmas.,1382140800,,244,5.1

2382984,5,B000A8AX0Y,"I bought this DVD a few years ago, and I watch it every Christmas.  The Bob Saget episodes are the best (and the set is still the best set the ever designed), plus the theme song on those episodes sounds a lot better and funnier with words.  The Tom Bergeron episode is okay, but I never found him as funny as Saget and I even stopped watching the show on a steady basis.  Plus the Bergeron episode on this disc reuses clips from the Saget shows (such as the lights falling off the house after the guy takes the ladder away) and Bergeron just does a joke for these clips that does not add to their funniness.

The Saget episodes (which are the 96 and 97 Christmas specials) I would each give a 5/5 too.  The Bergeron episode (the 2002 Christmas episode) I would give a 2.5/5 rating.",1344124800,6,782,4.256756756756757

2382986,5,B000A8AX0Y,"Mom is in my full-time care and enjoys AFHV on tv but cannot always find marathons when she's interested in tv.  Many shows she used to enjoy (1/2 hour sitcoms) are too involved for her to follow now and with commercial breaks so long she loses all interest, but AFHV is perfect since each clip is short and she loves to watch babies, etc.  THANK YOU!",1331424000,,351,4.303030303030303
2382987,5,B000A8AX0Y,Bought these as little gifts for families.  Great value.  Great family fun.  Stuck mine in our Christmas stuff and plan to watch it every year.  Love AFV.,1325116800,,154,4.592592592592593
2382988,3,B000A8AX0Y,"The second segment, with host Tom Bergeron, saves the DVD.  It's fun and funny.  The first segment, with the show's prior host, is killed by the host who is neither fun nor funny.",1306108800,,179,4.393939393939394
2382989,5,B000A8AX0Y,"I very much enjoyed this DVD.  I love weddings & although I assumed it would be entirely about weddings as opposed to only 1/2 of it, I still found it enjoyable.  The music montages of the collapsing cakes & the fainting members of the bridal party were very funny.

Thanks, Amazon for the speedy delivery.",1299801600,,306,4.527272727272727
2383010,1,B000A8AX0Y,"Very disappointed with the video, the title shows you are buying a video of weddings now more than half of it, is not of weddings. The clips are good, but very, very old so the quality. I WAS FORCE TO GIVE A STAR for the rating it should be ""0"" out of 5",1293321600,,253,3.792452830188679
2383011,2,B000A8AX0Y,"The jacket implies that the program will add funny home videos along with guide to parenting.  This is just clips of the old FHV show and not really good.  I don't understand the title.  The video does not have very much video on families or children.  It is a mix of anything you would see on the show...dogs, people do all types of activities, and skits or staged performances.  They stop short of putting advertisements in the show but they have them before the show.  I would not recommend anyone buying this unless this is what they wanted.",1253750400,,545,4.510204081632653

2383015,3,B000A8AX0Y,"This volume contains two episodes: ""Matrimony Mania,"" and the 12th season $100,000 winning episode special - each approximately 40 minutes in length.

The main attraction includes clips of wedding day mishaps such as a fainting groom, a teetering bride, best men, altar boys, ministers and a bride's maid who all topple over respectively, bratty ring bearers and chaotic animals. Also featured are the $100,000 winning ""Hallelujah Breakdown,"" and $10,000 winning ""Mystery Kisser"" clips. The ""Tight Jacket"" clip, however, will always be one of my personal favorites.
