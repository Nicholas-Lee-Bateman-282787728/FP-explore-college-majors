7901068,5,8391327531,One of my favorite films. Being able to have subtitles in English helped with the actors' accents.  Loved the extras!,1459382400,,117,4.85
7901069,5,8391327531,"I didn't know this wouldn't work in American DVD players when I bought it, I returned it when I read the disclaimer on the packaging. The seller was very considerate and returned my money after I sent it back unopened. This is an important movie that I think all Americans should see, it's so hard to find a copy today though, and the copies that you do find are used and or obscenely priced.",1343952000,,392,4.3108108108108105
7901070,5,8391327531,"What can I say about a movie experience which has had such an impact on me. The lighting, the story, the direction the locations, the documentary style of Joffe and the beautiful camerawork of Chris Menges, bring a war torn country to life. You literally feel you are there.

When the movie was released initially as a single disc DVD I was disappointed with attention to the special features, aka non existent.

But with this special edition there has been great care to include as much information on how they made this epic. The behind the scenes doco includes rare footage of crowd scenes being created and decent interviews with the director the writer and the lead actors and the the real Sydney Schomberg and Dith Pran. It also included even some even rarer footage of the actual arrival of the ""fake"" Khmer Rouge entering the city on the day the city fell. There is also an excellent interview with David Putnam 20 odd years after the event who gives additional insight into this great film.

There could have been more added, but the quality of the film more than makes up for this. The music is eery and at times infuriatingly 80's synthetic but at other times a great tension builder.

There is no attempt to try and ""glamorize"" the surroundings depicted in the movie nor to down play the part which Dith Pran character plays in the movie. Unfortunately human beings have not learnt that much from the events of the Killing Fields....I hope that if you haven't seen this movie, that you take the time to sit and let the experience take over.  It was groundbreaking in 1984 and in my view is still groundbreaking. It should have won the best picture oscar (won by Amadaeus). But the film has brought this harrowing event to the minds of many and helped to tell the tales of many who have died for a cause which was not worth the blood shed. It also paints a picture of the precarious position which foreign powers play in ""assisting"" countries fight their local battles. The Americans are not painted as heroes nor are they painted as villans. You are left to think for yourself as to the part in which the US played in the fall of the country which was known once as the pearl of Asia.

this is worth the money spent.",1177804800,7,2228,4.516129032258065
