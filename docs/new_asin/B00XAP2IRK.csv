8715598,5,B00XAP2IRK,Natalie is a great instructor and has put together a fun and effective  routine.  It has become one of my most favorite workouts.,1484438400,,129,4.565217391304348
8715599,5,B00XAP2IRK,"I have been doing both of Natalie Spadaccino's workouts for about a year and have never tired of them. They are so beautiful and I get a good. solid workout despite the low impact and graceful flow, which one might consider ""too soft"" to get the heart rate going. I love how she combines moves and her originality. I am a big Ellen Barrett fan but Natalie is not a repeat of Ellen's style.",1473465600,,389,4.27027027027027
8715600,5,B00XAP2IRK,"This is a very nice half hour workout.  It is easy on my joints.  I use it when I overworked the day before...a little aerobics, toning, and stretching with ballet feel is nice the day after weight training with Gilad.  One thing I like is the music.  It is jazzy and classic.  Am glad she made this because it is fun without being embarrassing if my teen girls walk in.  Don't feel like I am either trying to be like them or like a has-been. I hope she makes more.",1454544000,3,465,4.111111111111111

8715604,5,B00XAP2IRK,Fun and graceful workout that left me sweating but feeling energized.  If you enjoy Ellen Barrett then you will love Natalie too.  (in fact you will probably recognize her from Ellen's dvds!)  This will definitely be a regular in my workout dvd rotation.,1433376000,6,254,4.8604651162790695
