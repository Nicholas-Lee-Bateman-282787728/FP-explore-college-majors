8295640,3,B001DZOCMS,Rather interesting but otherwise rather mediocre documentary.  Have seen much better documentaries re vampires.,1516838400,,111,6.928571428571429
8295641,4,B001DZOCMS,A very interesting piece of history that I'd never heard before.,1475971200,,64,4.909090909090909
8295642,5,B001DZOCMS,"This DVD is about tracing down a woman who may be the seed of the Dracula story or at least a seed for vampire tales.  Non-fiction, not a movie, anime or anything like that.  If you are looking for action or the idea that vampires are real, this is NOT the DVD for you.  If you are serious about learning from where the idea of vampires came from, this IS one of the DVDs for you.",1228780800,17,380,3.973684210526316
