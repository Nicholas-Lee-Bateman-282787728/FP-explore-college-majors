8434575,5,6304722486,"This video is very helpful for basic stuff. It really takes you from zero drumming to some blues drumming very quickly! However the video is SHORT, it is 38 min and if you want step over the basics into musicianship of blues drumming get ""Blues Drums"" DVD with Dave Russell. While this DVD let you start, Dave will keep you going! This video is much focused and very concentrated. However it stays up to promise as it teaches you some blues drumming in very short time. It is probably the best thing to get started!",1169424000,,515,4.431578947368421
