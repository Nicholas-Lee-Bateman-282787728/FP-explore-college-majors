8028218,3,B0002JEM4Y,"come on, now. fun",1421452800,2,17,3.5
8028219,5,B0002JEM4Y,"Exactly what I said. It's so horrible it surpasses horrendous and loops back around to good.
This is a truly stupid movie that I forced myself to watch and then watched again with friends to laugh yet again.",1323907200,3,207,4.473684210526316
8028220,5,B0002JEM4Y,Great and as bad as it was meant to be. This movie is cheaply made but still watchable when you watched it for the right reasons. It is Redneck as the title implies and campy. If you don't take it as a serious piece of cinematography it is everything you would want it to be.,1313193600,3,275,4.0181818181818185
8028221,1,B0002JEM4Y,This should go down in the Genusus Book of World Records as being the worst movie ever made. Not so much the theme it was the acting. I gave it to someone to watch to see if it was just me and they turned it off after 10 min. I try to justify money spent by saying I am one of the few who have seen the Worst In The Universe.,1284681600,,325,3.591549295774648
8028222,5,B0002JEM4Y,"Are you looking for an intelligent movie?  Then you defintely do not want to buy this DVD!

However, if you are looking for the campy and zanie humor that results when you turn a backwater town full of the absolutely worst examples of trailer trash that you only see on the Jerry Springer show or the national news after a tornado rips through a mobile home park then this is the movie to buy.

Fake vampire teeth, unknown cast, beer guzzling, bad country music, tripe and lots of good old country boys are just some of the features in this movie.

My favorite line in the movies was, ""Calculus IS a venereal disease.""  After Calculus 1, 2 & 3, Physics with Calculus, a whole host of engineering courses that used Calculus I am inclined to agree.",1110240000,13,746,4.455882352941177
