This is a serious case of misrepresentation, and is compounded by the fact that Amazon has apparently ordered more of this item. Be warned. You are unlikely to get your money back.",1219363200,,358,4.868852459016393
8227242,3,B000X7SB7E,"For it being as old as it is, the movie itself is okay... it's just not the movie that was intened for my purchase.  I'm not sure if it's the sellers minor mistake but I intended to purchase Slave Girls (Which was also know as Prehistoric Women) the 1967 version.  Which has Martine Beswick, Edina Ronay, Michael Latimer, and Stephanie Randall.  It was in the description that this was the movie I was looking for.  But when I played the movie it was Prehistoric Women the 1950's version.  Which had  Laurette Luez, Allan Nixon, Joan Shawlee, and Judy Landon.  What's stricken me as strange is the cover has the same names as those in the 1967 version.  So I'm wondering if this is just a minor confusion becuase the two have the same titles?  Or if this was done on purpose?  Either way, the movie isn't too bad as I've said.  Clear, good sound, color, as good as can be expected for a movie of the 50's.  If your looking for Prehistoric Women (1950) Then this is just right.  If your looking for Slave Girls (1967) a.k.a. Prehistoric Women then move along nothing to see here.  Either way I'm keeping it... even though I was slightly dissapointed that it wasn't Slave Girls (1967).
