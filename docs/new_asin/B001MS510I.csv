8321591,5,B001MS510I,"I have bought several different beginning tango DVDs and this is by far the best. Also, it is the only one that really explains BOTH the leader's and the follower's roles and steps. Ladies will surely appreciate the fact that they receive equal air time in this video. Also, watching the follower's explanation/moves is a great help for us leaders.
Antn and Natalie speak perfect English, their explanations are clear and logical. The moves are demonstrated clearly and the camera angles allow the viewer to see exactly how to do it. There is a simple elegance to the whole DVD.
I'm taking private Tango lessons and this DVD is a great supplement to those. I also bought Antns two more advanced DVDs and will look forward to working with them.
Thanks Anton & Natalie!",1509062400,,767,4.731343283582089
8321592,5,B001MS510I,I like his work and will buy the rest of the DVDs in the series.  I would say that he is an inspired teacher.  I have had a few instructors.,1478217600,,140,3.6333333333333333

8321594,5,B001MS510I,This is the BEST dvd I've found to learn Argentine Tango. Not only is the Basic Step shown very clearly - man and ladies parts shown separately - but the finesse of the steps is explained so that you can understand and master this dance. I have looked at others and the instructions just didn't come close to this dvd. I have emailed Mr. Gazenbeek about Vol. 2 and he said this will be out shortly. I also had a question about Argentine Tango music and he was glad to help me with that. I mention this because it shows how enthusiast he is about this dance; his attitude shows and infects you as well. Want to learn Argentine Tango? Look no further. This is THE DVD you need!!,1417651200,2,676,4.248062015503876
8321595,5,B001MS510I,"I just started learning Tango this year, and I've ordered a number of Tango DVDs and CDs, because, frankly, although I am fortunate to have a wonderful and charismatic teacher (Silvia) I am a slow learner when it comes to dance.  This DVD is, by far, the best one I have seen to learn how to dance the real Tango, Tango Salon, the Tango that couples, rather than performers, dance.  I just wish I could find more in this series.",1304899200,5,428,4.3375
