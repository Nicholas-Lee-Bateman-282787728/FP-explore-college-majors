7953918,3,B00005TQ4B,"In this low-budget, low-brow Latino yuk-fest about the bad guys vs. the good guys in the Los Angeles barrio, Weezo the ferret (played by Weezo) comes to the aid of a poor sucker (Danny De La Paz) just when he needs help the most. The movie is not about Weezo, but the charming little sable is featured in several scenes (swimming in the pool, noshing on a Mexican meal, etc.). The movie has some pretty obvious, over the top humor, but it's so likable that you just can't help but root for the hapless hero.",1181865600,,507,4.347368421052631
