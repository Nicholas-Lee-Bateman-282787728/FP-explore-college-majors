1840793,5,B00008DDVJ,"Love, Love, Love this workout.  So much so that I bought all her other Hula CD's for more variety.  It's fun, different, and you hardly know or realize that you're exercising.  Great product!!!",1263254400,,193,4.787878787878788
1840794,3,B00008DDVJ,Should get the beginners workout first.  Adds great variety to the aerobic dance workout.,1234483200,,89,5.357142857142857
1840795,2,B00008DDVJ,"I recently bought all of the Island Girl Hula videos (except Basic Hula).  I'd have to say out of all of them, this was my least favorite.

The main reason being that the music was pretty bad, especially during the final dance.  Also, I think Kili does a better job when she has her background dancers...in this one Kili is solo.  I believe that this and basic hula are her earliest ones and I don't recommend either of them...try the other ones instead!",1197936000,4,454,4.433734939759036
1840796,5,B00008DDVJ,"But this is not for beginners! She covers the movement once and goes on to the next too quickly, then it is all to be followed at a quick pace. You do burn calories if you can keep up, (not all workouts should be for beginners there are people advanced that want to move it up so this is for them) try the 'Hula W/O for beginners' first then do this one. Nice setting and pleasant music but was hoping for a little local slack key or ukelele Hawaiian. Better than other Hula W/O series I have seen.",1178064000,4,498,4.091836734693878
1840797,3,B00008DDVJ,"It comes in 5.1 surround sound & just her at the beach. It has chapter choices, bonus features of her dancing an authentic dance & trailer for her Hula workout: beginnerseight DVD.

Most of the moves were authentic, such as the Kaholo (walking bellydance vertical figure 8), Ka'o (bellydance vertical figure 8), 'uniu (bellydance outward figure 8), hela (leg forward/back), 'uwehe (knees together & spread them), ami (small hip circle), kawelu (step forward w/half figure 8).

She's in great shape, good cleear voice, seemed nice & straight forward no small talk except to give her many good cues. She teaches the step first in it's most simple/bare bones in 1/2 time, then slowly speeds it up & then building up the hips, then the arms to it's graceful finish. The music seems like a fusion of native Hawaiian & american country twang, not bad, decent beat simple, not too fast.

The bad part that everyone hates is the dance routine you learn tells a story like all hula do & this one is a 60s american music style, called ""Hula Sunshine""& Rockette style kicks added in. This is only about 15% of the dance, but kinda kills it a bit. Luckily the song only plays at the end. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.

After a 4 min intro including seeing the dance of what you will learn, is a 5 min warm up with some basic stretching & also learning some of the basic steps like the Kaholo & K'ao until your hips turn to stone ;-) It ends with a 5 min cooldown w/some yoga poses & back stretches & other muscles stretched for a full 38 min.

Her new ""Island Girl"" hula workouts are more authentic. Just like her other ones, you get a great workout, your abs burn, your hips, legs get a nice workout. It's all authentic dance moves with some added quick squats, etc. added in so you barely notice it for adding toning. The authentic drum Hawaiian music is beautiful & does keep you stimulted too keep going just like a dance/rock beat would.

I had no trouble following & learning the steps, there are plenty of dance DVDs that I have had trouble with, but she breaks everything down well & shows it slowly several times before speeding it up. She even cues YOUR left & right, not hers.

There's a trailer for her ""Hula Workout"" DVDs & another authentic Hula workout like this called ""Island Girl: Hula Abs & Buns"" at collagevideo.com",1151452800,22,2324,4.505938242280285
1840798,2,B00008DDVJ,Very basic hula workout.  Nice backdrop of the oceon.  Quick delivery.,1143072000,2,70,5.2727272727272725
1840799,4,B00008DDVJ,"While Hula for Weight Loss will certainly take some practice, I think it's a great way to work out.  There are certain components that are a little tough to follow such as camera angle (gosh I wish I could see her entire body as she does this step) but that is a ""problem"" of most workout videos.

Hula for Weight Loss, however, features beautiful scenery and the instructor is in great shape,  has a pleasing voice and is reassuring.

I think the video offers a great alternative for exercisers who want variety.",1142726400,5,513,4.543478260869565
1840800,5,B00008DDVJ,"I bought this DVD to add variety to my workout routine.  I am a grandparent, overweight, and now working out regularly for health reasons.  I really like dance routine based exercise for working out at home, or while travelling.  I became interested in this DVD for its ""new slant"" on an old idea.

This one is a welcome change.  I read from other reviewers that it may not be authentic hula.  However, I think the instructor has made appropriate modifications to make sure the routine has an aerobic component.  All dance instructors I have encountered do this.  She also warns against overwork for beginners, and suggests modifications. She covers all the bases.

It's fun also to be transported to Hawaii for a few minutes in the great photography, and also in the contemporary Hawaiian music.

I found this a very fresh approach and a worthwhile purchase.  Highly recommended.",1113609600,27,880,4.878378378378378
1840801,2,B00008DDVJ,I'm a beginner and this dvd is way too fast for me. I doubt I'd ever be able to learn it as she doesn't even explain what she's doing ! Too fast and not enough description !,1107216000,7,173,3.7027027027027026
1840802,1,B00008DDVJ,"I only spent 6.99 at Target for this video but I would rather get my money back than let someone see me with this video.  It is not good at all.  Some parts look like she is doing the chicken dance!  I thought Hula would be graceful not cheesy and choppy.  I can say it did get my heart rate up but in no way did I feel like I was doing HULA ...she calls it the ""Sunshine Dance"" but I would recommend you to not get this video... I wish I had read the reviews on this before I spent my hard earned 7$...  Now...where is that receipt???",1048118400,4,535,3.871559633027523

7982077,3,B00008DDVJ,"The scenery is very beautiful,
And Killi is quite lovely to see too,
Hula is a fun, cute, and sexy workout,
I enjoyed it--sun surf, and sky so blue,
Perfect for a cold, snowy winter day,
Oh buff Killi--come and take me away!
Teach me some exciting dances moves to do!

This workout is similar to others,
Arranged new ways,
Easy, but I want to try something fresh--
Shiny and radiant as the sun's rays!
Music more traditional please,
I found this workout hard on my old knees,
Not really cardio, per se.",1416873600,4,502,4.397849462365591
7982078,5,B00008DDVJ,Nice dvd.,1416787200,,9,4.0
7982079,2,B00008DDVJ,Not hula and customer shouldn't be mislead that this honors the dance in any way. Was hoping for a good dance workout that perhaps reinforced learning correct movements and was disappointed. Cheap price really equated to cheap quality. Two stars for routine at least being a workout although not a fun one.,1398816000,,306,4.903846153846154
7982080,2,B00008DDVJ,"kinda slow i expected more Tahitian dancing so know i have two extras anyone need one, theier paid for !",1365120000,2,104,4.25

7982082,5,B00008DDVJ,"The workouts that Kili takes part in are very good. I used to be a dance teacher for irish step, ballet and tap.  And this was just the pick-up I needed to get in touch with my dancer-side again.  If you want to get a good workout that will not give you joint problems in the long-run, and make you graceful, this is the kind of workout for you.",1299542400,,345,3.9855072463768115
7982083,4,B00008DDVJ,"This workout shows Kili in the early years without her back up hula dancers.

This is definitely a workout that targets every part of your body.  Kili has you all over the place and even though you may feel lost at times because she is moving through the steps rather quickly it is so worth it.  This hula routine is definitely going to contribute to the weight loss.

That said, the music sucks butt.

I prefer the music in her later hula workout videos with the back up hula dancers.
Hawaiian with a nice (drum) beat, unlike what she has playing in this video.

Anyway, had the music been better I would have given it a 5 star rating instead of the 4 stars.

So if you can get past the music then its worth it!!!!",1270598400,3,715,4.213235294117647
