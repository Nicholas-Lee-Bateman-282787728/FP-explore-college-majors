DISNEY, YOU GOT IT RIGHT IN PUTTING THE SHOWS OUT FIRST AND,PERHAPS, PUTTING OUT THE SERIALS IN A FEW YEARS! None of us want the serials released on dvd yet! The shows are the priority in all of our minds and then we'll consider the serials. We just think that the serials are seconday to the shows, that's all.

ALL of us baby boomers and all of our entire families thank you!!! We want this dvd set of the shows and MANY MORE!!! It is WONDERFUL that Disney is FINALLY putting ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" on DVD.

2117025,3,B0002S64UK,"I'm with the first reviewer. I started to buy this dvd set thinking that it would have the serials such as Spin and Marty, etc. on it. How stupid of Disney not to release the serials the best part of the MMC. I watched these serials many years ago on  The Mickey Mouse Club and then again a few years back when they had them on Vault Disney late at night on the Disney Channel. But as usual Disney or Hollywood doesn't listen to their fans but release what they think people will want and buy. I'm not going to bother purchasing this but wait for the serials.",1098576000,5,559,4.175925925925926

The whole experience I get out of these shows is the charm, innocence and nostalgia of an earlier, simpler time.  I've had the 10 volume VHS set for some time, and love them dearly.

Sooty was an ill-tempered puppet from England.

The ""What I Want To Be"" serial was about a Mickey Mouse Club newsreel reporter (Alvy Moore) who picks two 10-year olds and takes them to the headquarters of Trans World Airlines in Kansas City, Missouri, where they learn how TWA trains its flight crews. These five episodes are part of a total of 10 episodes.

I like the idea of the first 5 shows being released as this set. However, being the very early shows, the entertainment value will be less than some of the better later shows. I have never seen the hourly shows - most of the shows I have seen have been the half-hour repeats shown on the Disney Channel in the mid to late 1980s.

But at the very minimum, these first five shows are very interesting to me historically - since they are the very first shows.

I will be glad to have this treasure set but would have preferred a set of the Mickey Mouse serials - such as Spin And Marty, The Hardy Boys, or Annette. Maybe these serials will be released in future treasure sets.",1091491200,180,2523,4.6477272727272725

2117123,5,B0002S64UK,"The third and final release of Walt Disney Treasures Wave 8 gives us the complete series of the Annette serial that was part of the 30 minute version of The Mickey Mouse Club Show. Annette Funicello was the studios most popular Mouseketeer and for good reason! She had such a attention grabbing ""girl next door ""quality that it is hard not to fall in love with her. Although I must say there are several films where she seems to be a tad bitchy(lol), for the most part she comes off as a very down to earth and sweet young lady.

The two disc set includes 20 mini episodes running 11 minutes each and one 30 minute version of the The Mickey Mouse Club episodes one introducing the series of Annette and the other featuring the last episodes of the season finale. The extras are rounded out with two 16 minute feature-ettes talking about Annette Funicello.

I'm not sure why the words complete serial are not in the title here because as far as I know this is the complete serial. The episodes and extras are presented here in beautiful restored fashion. It should be noted that there is a change in packaging on this Wave with both discs being stacked overlap style without any hinged spindle. This is certainly not a change for the better, but every change to the packaging since the series started was a step in the wrong direction, so it is just par for the course.

Overall I enjoyed this set much more than I expected to, not being familiar with the series in it's first run, I found it to be charming even if there were a few too many corny songs. I do think the extras are a bit thin and it would have been nice to see more episodes of TMMC feature Annette's many talents. There is certainly room for in on the two disc as each disc runs around 2 1/2 hours. It seems to me that they could have squeezed at least one more episode per disc featuring the young star.",1378339200,,1870,4.337142857142857
2117124,4,B0002S64UK,"I wasn't born when The Mickey Mouse Club first aired and I really wasn't a fan of this show growing up. I was more into Bugs Bunny and other more violent cartoons and live action such as The Three Stooges and The Little Rascals. This Walt Disney Treasure The Mickey Mouse Club is a short retrospective of the show including only 5 episodes a full week of shows that aired in the show's infancy. The episodes look exceptional for their age and even though opening segment was filmed in color it is shown here as it aired in black and white.....don't worry they have added the color opening as a bonus!

Disc one includes three episodes Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, each show is in it's original 1 hour format. The disc also includes a few shorts extras, one on Jimmie Dodd and three galleries. I'm sure die hard fans are going to complain that this set isn't enough considering the 300 episodes that were made. Being a casual fan this is a better alternative than having to buy a 50 disc box set of all the episodes.

Disc two has the remaining two episodes to complete one week Thursday and Friday, an interview with some of the original cast and the color opening sequence round out the extras on this last installment of Wave 4. It would be nice if they released some of the newer episodes to compare how the show progressed, but at least they did releases several sets featuring some of the more memorable serials on the show. Annette, The Hardy Boys and Spin and Marty all have their own Treasures set which were released after this set. This is going to appeal to fans of the show more than Disney animation fans, but I did enjoy going back to a time when children were taught basic courtesies...something many are not today by their own parents.

This set is great for the casual fan of the show or the complete-ist who wants all the Treasures volumes. It would have been nice if they had added the color Mickey intro segments that which are available on Mickey Mouse in Living Color Volume Two, but what is here looks and sounds great and will transport you back to a time long gone!

2117140,5,B0002S64UK,"Well, children, I'm 71 and have to tell you this is not a Disney idealized view of the '50s.  I graduated from high school in 1958 and we had hay rides at Valley Mount Ranch outside St. Louis (my parents chaperoned) and we didn't sing Elvis songs but old favorites such as ""You Are My Sunshine"" and, at our raciest, ""Ninety-nine Bottles of Beer on the Wall.""  People conclude the Annette series is a sanitized, dream version of the time it was produced but it's not.  That's the way it was, really.  We knew the time was special, we knew we were living restricted, confined and rule-dominated lives (that's why everything exploded in the 1960s and went even more haywire in the 1970s) but this indeed was it.  You dressed up to go to other people's houses, you were respectful of other people's parents and all adults, you seldom conversed about anything deep, and drug use, rampant alcohol and free-wheeling sex were something we'd only vaguely heard about if at all.  It really was like living in a movie script and no one got very verbal or introspective about that.  It was a very orderly, predictable world and I remember how bored to death I was on the one hand, but how happy I was with my high school, my high school life, my family and friends on the other hand.  People who went to my small town high school today say over and over, ""Every morning I woke up and could hardly wait to get to school.""  One day the school was closed because of a heavy snow and almost all the students, administrators, teachers and cafeteria staff showed up anyway (I walked a cafeteria cook through two miles of snow up a country road to get there).  We all stayed, worked with the teacher of our choice in the morning (for me typing) and hamburgers, chili and French fries were served at 11:30.  The campus only emptied out around 5 p.m.  That's not a Disney movie, that was life.  As for Annette, she was something entirely new, a girl with a clearly ethnic background, who didn't have perfect features or the look of a model, who didn't call out for attention (at all!), who sang pleasantly and danced pleasantly.  I think she only was noticed because Mr. Disney was such a genius on what worked and what didn't work in front of the camera, and she stood out in auditions because all the other Mouseketeers were such child star types selling, selling, selling.  Annette let the audience come to her.  In this series, she is just enchanting star to finish, a total natural, and she doesn't act the script, she lives the character and her life.",1322611200,16,2536,4.504366812227074

2117167,5,B0002S64UK,"This was the best money I've ever spent on a DVD since DVDs first started coming out.  It's an expensive DVD set, especially now that it's out of print.  But it was worth every penny to get it.

First off, I am still amazed that the Disney company even released the ""Annette"" serial on DVD.  I wasn't around in '58 to see its original run.  I first saw ""Annette"" when I used to watch reruns of the Mickey Mouse Club in 1975 as a young teenager.  I had never seen the Mickey Mouse Club show before and loved it.  The ""Annette"" serial was great but I had pretty much forgotten all about it until the late 90s when the Disney Channel used to run the old MMC episodes.  That was when I knew ""Annette"" was classic and I taped all the episodes off TV.  However, the skipped an episode and my collection was incomplete.  Fast forward to 2008 and out it comes on a collectors 2 DVD set.

I now finally have it and recently watched all 20 episodes which would be my third time around.  Tears of joy welled up in my eyes which is rare with me.  It's not just because of the lovely Annette Funicello who stole all our hearts way back when.  But it's the people in the cast, the way kids were back in the 1950s, and there's a real nostalgic feel about the whole show.  And who can forget Jet Maypen?

The serial features some all-time great character actors like Mary Wickes who introduces all the characters in the first episode.  There's Richard Deacon from ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" who also had a short, but memorable role in Hitchcock's ""The Birds.""  Plus Sylvia Field who played Mrs. Wilson from ""Dennis The Menace."" She plays Annette's snobbish but well-meaning aunt Liliah.

There are bonuses on the set which includes a really nice tribute to Annette Funicello from her friends Sharon Baird, Shelly Fabares and a few others.  You also get two complete half hour episodes of ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" which have inspired me to look for other episodes released on the ""Walt Disney Treasures"" DVD sets.

The kids in the cast which include Tim Considine, Roberta Shaw, David Stollery, Cheryl Holdridge, Shelley Fabares, Sharon Baird, and many others, are a talented bunch.

I have many DVDs in my collection but this is truly the best DVD I have ever bought.",1248998400,6,2248,4.471744471744472
2117168,4,B0002S64UK,"What a delight it is to see fresh-faced Disney darling Annette Funicello, starring in her very own self-titled TV serial.  The twenty-part story of ANNETTE aired during the third and final season of ""The Mickey Mouse Club"".  It had originally been planned as a co-starring vehicle for both Annette and fellow Mouseketeer Darlene Gillespie (who had already headlined the ""Corky and White Shadow"" serial) but Walt Disney later removed her from the cast--presumably because Gillespie would instead play Dorothy in Disney's planned movie production ""The Rainbow Road to Oz"", a project that sadly never got past a ""Disneyland"" TV special.

ANNETTE follows a young orphan named Annette McCleod, a naive innocent from Nebraska who unexpectedly arrives on the doorstep of her uncle and aunt (Richard Deacon and Sylvia Field) in Ashford.  Pretty soon, Annette befriends feisty ranch-girl Jet Maypen (Judy Nugent) and joins the rest of the gang at Old South High--until snotty rich girl Laura Rogan (Roberta 'Jymme' Shore) accuses Annette of stealing a priceless necklace during her first big party!

Co-starring Tim Considine, David Stollery, Rudy Lee, Shelley Fabares and a few of the older Mouseketeers (Sharon Baird, Cheryl Holdridge), ANNETTE is an absolute joy from beginning to end.  Each episode runs for a compact 10 minutes, so you can enjoy the story at your leisure.  Annette proves herself well in her very first demanding assignment.  It's no wonder why she was the only Mouseketeer who had a private contract with Disney.  She introduces the hit song ""How Will I Know My Love"", and has a winning chemistry with Judy Nugent (""Magnificent Obsession"") as the feisty Jet.  Mary Wickes plays the McCleods' maid Katie and acts as a narrator-of-sorts for the story.

ANNETTE's includement in the Walt Disney Treasures series sadly only comes with a few extras, but they are very worthwhile.  There are the complete ""Mickey Mouse Club"" episodes that accompanied the first and last segments of the ANNETTE serial, the 1993 Disney Records special ""Musically Yours"" which charts the success of Annette via her musical career at Disney and beyond; and finally ""To Annette with Love"", a recent featurette boasting new interviews with Shelley Fabares, Sharon Baird and Annette Funicello's husband Glenn Holt, who discusses Funicello's brave battle with MS.",1248739200,4,2347,5.245989304812834

2117171,5,B0002S64UK,"Another Collector's Tin release by Disney; this time a limited series of 39,500 were issued. Each contains an individually numbered certificate of authenticity, a 7"" x 4.5"" black and white publicity still of the title character, a booklet about the serial, and two disks.

The disks contain all 20 episodes and two entire episodes of the Mickey Mouse Club. These are from early 1958 so they are only 30 minutes long as the show's running time had been cut in half for its 3rd and final season.

There are also some bonus items on the disks: introductions by Leonard Maltin and some interviews with and tributes to ""Annette"".

Baby boomers don't need any introduction to the title character but others may be puzzled by the popularity of this actress who was not much of an actress and this singer who was not much of a singer. I was never particularly dazzled by Annette but I always liked her; she had an effortless charm that just won you over. Even if you crushed on Cheryl (guilty) and Doreen you still liked Annette. And very few girls ever felt any jealousy toward her. Much the same could be said in reverse about Tim Considine so featuring them together (here and in ""Spin and Marty"") pretty much guaranteed you would appeal to the widest teen and pre-teen demographic.

The series was a somewhat toned down adaptation of Janette (The Pokey Little Puppy) Lowrey's 1950 book ""Margaret"" and was originally to be titled ""Annette and Darlene"". But poor Darlene Gillespie fell into disfavor and was replaced as the Jet Maypen character by Judy Nugent. Nugent was not a Disney property so there was no need for the studio to promote her career, otherwise it would have been called ""Annette and Judy"".

The plot features the traditional conflict between city and country. Annette and Jet are up against rich girl queen bee Laura Rogan (Roberta Shore successfully playing against type and obviously having a lot of fun with the role). You've seen this same dynamic recently in ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"". Disney's move from Annette to Lindsey Lohen might signal the decline of Western Civilization.

David Stollery and Tim Considine team up again as the main male characters. Stollery sings a duet with Annette and one featurette explains how they doubled her voice (probably his as well) by having her sing the song twice.

There are sizeable parts for Doreen Tracey, Shelley Fabares, Sharon Baird, and Rudy Lee. And a bit part for Cheryl Holdridge; even third season newcomer Bonnie Fields  (the prettiest Mouseketeer who was sadly underutilized by the show itself) gets some screen time. Richard Deacon and Mary Wickes play off each other for comedy relief; basically reprising their trademark character roles.

The song that launched Annette's recording career, ""How Will I Know My Love?"" is featured twice and Shore sings a couple much better numbers, ""Readin', Writin' and Rhythm"" and ""Don't Jump to Conclusions"". Shore's stuff has an early Judy Garland quality.

The teen dancing sequences were painfully corny even to a small town 1950's 2nd grader. On the other hand Bonnie does dance a little and this prompted me to seek out a video of her original 1957 MMC guest appearance (as a tap dancing act) which someone has uploaded to U-Tube (check it out).

I still have the Dell comic book so I had not forgotten the general story, but I found series itself better than I remembered it. They do a nice job of laying some romantic misdirection so that the resolution offers a mild surprise. Then you can look back and see that clues were provided all along but most viewers missed them.

Despite having some awful dialogue to deal with; Stollery, Nugent, and Shore are talented enough to sell their characters. Annette and Tim just play their likable selves and as always that works just fine.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1241222400,3,3857,4.816944024205749
2117172,3,B0002S64UK,"""Annette"" is an idealized picture of teen-age life with kids singing ""Camptown Races"" and ""Zippity-do-Dah"" instead of Elvis (while on a hayride yet!).  Still, the touches of Disney humor and the kids (while not polished actors) seemed like real kids.  I got drawn in and enjoyed seeing the story play out.  One thing that Disney over-used (much more than they did with the ""Spin and Marty"" series) is the flashback, it seemed that a lengthy flashback accompanied every fourth episode.  The series shares the struggle of a ""country girl"" played by Annette Funicello to fit in with a more sophisticated and snobbish crowd.  One of my favorite characters was ""Steady"" Olmstead because he was occasionally rude and had an offbeat charisma that was fun to see.  A lot of familiar kid and adult actors.

I chose this as a birthday gift for myself.  For years I remembered the story, or at least bits of it, I remembered Roberta Shore (here called Jimmie Shore) and the song ""Don't Jump To Conclusions"" or at least parts of it.  It was a sweet, if odd story, where an orphan goes to live with a maiden aunt and uncle (don't laugh, I had several maiden aunts and uncles).  Her adventured included fitting in with the wealthier crowd, yet having fun with the farm girl who delivered the family's eggs and milk (remember when we had a milkman and a bread man???).  She was shabbily treated by one girl who was jealous of Annette's popularity, and the typical story ensued.

I loved it!  I would rather watch this every week than see some of the reality junk they have on TV!  I will watch it again in six months or so, just for the atmosphere of the fifties and sixties.  It may seem odd to today's young people, but I ate it up when I was a little girl!",1233014400,5,1255,5.32994923857868
2117197,5,B0002S64UK,"As a true Disney collector I love the great material Disney is releasing in the ""Disney Treasures"" series.  This is another great collection of old historic Disney material we grew up with.",1232496000,,189,4.90625
2117198,5,B0002S64UK,"Disney Legend Annette Funicello stars as Annette McCleod, a teenage, country orphan who surprises her wealthy aunt and uncle (a pair of aging siblings played by Sylvia Field and Richard Deacon) by showing up on their doorstep one evening with instructions to move right in. Uncle Archie and Aunt Lila didn't even know they had a niece from their estranged, late brother, and they aren't too keen on having a teenager around to disrupt their increasingly dull lifestyle. However, Annette is so sweet, innocent, agreeable, and happy to be there that they soon change their tune. Housekeeper Katie (Mary Wickes) helps in this area as well.

Surprisingly more quickly accepting of Annette are the upper-crust local teens, a set of clean-cut and overly pampered yet shockingly genial and well-mannered rich kids who rule the school and the suburbs and do tend to keep to their own crowd for the most part, but in a friendly sort of way. There's Steve Abernathy (Tim Considine of Spin and Marty fame), the dreamy guy all the girls want for some reason, Mike Martin (David Stollery, the other half of Spin and Marty), the senior who spends most of his time as a soda jerk, the girl who throws the parties, Val Abernathy (the Mickey Mouse Club's lovely Doreen Tracey), and her best-friend Moselle Corey (then-on Annette's real-life best-friend, Shelley Fabares), and of course, the wacky mascot of the gang, short-stacked ""Steady"" (Rudy Lee), the life of the party, and his hanger-on, equally diminutive Kitty (Sharon Baird). Also on hand are Madge (my own Mickey Mouse Club crush, Cheryl Holdridge), Pat (cutie Bonnie Lynn Fields), Jimmy (Tommy Cole), Tony (Chuck Hicks), Court (Barry Curtis), and Drew (Steve Stevens). On the outside of the main group is a country girl named Jet (Judy Nugent) who becomes Annette's best friend, despite not being invited to the same gatherings Annette's family standing immediately includes her in.

It would seem that Annette's integration into the in-crowd of her new hometown should be quite smooth, but there's one loose cog that throws the whole thing out of whack: Laura Rogan (the Shaggy Dog's Roberta Shore). Laura feels that newcomer Annette threatens her status as the prettiest, most sophisticated girl in school, so every chance she gets, she points out Annette's country bumpkin nature (which is really only evident in her arrival clothes and naivety) and keeps her feeling like an outsider. Things really get heated when Annette attends her first fancy party and Laura's expensive necklace goes missing. Laura immediately blames Annette, and this sets the tone for the whole serial. It is mostly about Annette trying to fit in but having to deal with Laura's jealousy the whole time until a final confrontation. ""Annette"" is a simple yet highly enjoyable little program, a Mickey Mouse Club serial that aired in 20 12-minute parts in 1958 based on the 1950 teen novel ""Margaret"", by Janette Sebring Lowrey, and showcasing the only Mouseketeer hand-picked by Walt Disney himself, Annette Funicello.

""Annette"" is one of the latest titles (as of January '09) in the popular and long-running (and mostly excellent) Walt Disney Treasures DVD line, and the 3rd to feature a Mickey Mouse Club serial. The ""Annette"" serial episodes are presented here with the option of a play-all feature and taken out of the context of the Mickey Mouse Club television series in which they originally were played. Thankfully however, we are given the full episodes of the Mickey Mouse Club that premiered and closed the Annette serial as bonus features. Of course, all this wonderful material is not enough for a Disney Treasures collection, so we also get two featurettes about Annette and the usual Leonard Maltin introductions throughout the 2 discs. However, even all that is a bit light for a Disney Treasures collection, but they do seem to get lighter every year.

Now, personally, like most fans, I find Annette's sweetness and innocence to be endearing and love and respect her as a Disney legend, though I have to admit that my heart always belonged to Cheryl Holdridge when it came to Mouseketeers (of the '50's version at least; born in '75, I grew up with all three versions of the show thanks to the Disney Channel). Annette was an unusual face for TV at the time, standing out among the other cast members on the Mickey Mouse Club due to her Italian heritage, but I lived my whole life in a place where many girls looked like Annette, so I was never really bowled over and never really understood the obsession so many people apparently had with her in the 50's and 60's. I still don't, but as a Disney fanatic I naturally hold a different kind of fondness and appreciation for her. But, of course, a real treat for me was to see that Cheryl had a role (very minor as it was) as part of the gang on ""Annette"", along with a few other girls I always thought were cuties. Plus, there are those two Mickey Mouse Club episode bonus features to enjoy Cheryl on. Unfortunately, by this time the Mickey Mouse Club had been cut down to a half hour program, so the ""Annette"" episodes were a large part of it, meaning the extra material really isn't that much. The episode presented on the first disc features some cute musical numbers and the episode on disc two features Talent Round-Up Day, both with a song from Jimmie Dodd as well (the second has Jimmie joined by Lonnie). All this classic material is in black and white, of course. Disc One's featurette, ""Musically Yours, Annette"" is a 1993 promotional video made to coincide with a Walt Disney Records release of Annette's recordings. It is a featurette mostly about Annette's musical career with some great interviews, including with Annette herself. Disc Two's featurette, ""To Annette With Love"", is a tear-jerking reflection on Annette's career at Disney that combines old interviews with new and provides a nice, celebratory look at Annette's life to this point. Both featurettes are excellent inclusions in this set, though, as was said before, more could have been included, like galleries or audio recordings. The packaging is classic ""Disney Treasures"", as the set is housed in the expected silver tin and comes with a certificate of authenticity, photo card, and booklet. They did make the odd choice in this case of using a Mickey Mouse Club photo of Annette on the cover instead of one from the ""Annette"" serial though, but it makes no difference to me because I knew what I was getting beforehand.

""Annette"" is a wonderful piece of nostalgia for anyone with Disney, '50's, or Funicello interests, or who would like to introduce a younger generation to much more wholesome, amiable viewing material from an arguably more innocent time. The story is an easy and relaxing one, highly entertaining due to the time-capsule quality, charming personalities, and delightful music (yes, these kids entertain each other at parties with preplanned musical performances). Despite how dated one might find it, you watch ""Annette"" always eager for the next episode and a bit sad when you know you're watching the last. It's a feeling the other Mickey Mouse Club serials will give you as well, so give ""Annette"" a try and locate the Disney Treasures ""Hardy Boys"" and ""Spin and Marty"" releases too if you can find them. This is truly wonderful classic Disney!",1231718400,9,7338,4.909750201450443

2117202,5,B0002S64UK,"This is a double dvd from the 3rd season of The Mickey Mouse Club in which Annette, due to her popularity on the show, had her own serial, called ""Annette"".  In the serial, Annette played a shy country girl who comes to live with her aunt and uncle in a different town.  Annette was immediately accepted by the kids at Old South High School but one of the girls was jealous of Annette and gave her a difficult time. There was an incident of a missing necklace and Annette was in the room alone when the necklace disappeared. There was a party at which the necklace disappeared, a hayride on which Annette sings her famous song, ""How Will I Know My Love?"" which launched her singing career.  All the kids watching the show wanted to know how they could buy this song, so Disney had her record it.  Then there was a barbecue and a fight.  Annette leaves a note for her aunt and uncle and goes to the train station to go back to Beaver Junction where she came from.  Mike saves the day by finding Annette before the train leaves and brings her back.  At a school related meeting at Steve's house, Laura plays the piano to rehearse a song.  The piano is out of tune.  I can't tell you anything else, or I'll spoil the ending, which is a happy one.  Annette's friends are some of the mouseketeers having roles in this serial who are Sharon Baird, Tommy Cole, Doreen Tracey, Bonnie Fields and Cheryl Holdridge.  Steve and Mike are played by Tim Considine and David Stollery of Spin and Marty fame and Roberta Shore plays the part of Laura.  Moselle is played by Shelly Fabares.  The serial is split up.  Half is on one dvd and half is on the other dvd.  There are also two 30-minute MMC shows included on the dvds.  In the third season, the MMC was only a half hour.  Thus, there is a 30-minute MMC program which includes the introduction to the Annette Serial on the first disk and a 30-minute MMC program which includes the finale on the second disk.  There is a wonderful special feature with Sharon Baird, Shelly Fabares and Glen Holt as they talk about Annette and how she touched their lives on one of the disks.  On the other disk, there is another special feature which includes interviews with the Sherman Brothers, Tutti Camaratta and Annette from several years back.

2117204,5,B0002S64UK,"Not only is Annette Funicello unforgettable, but she is ably supported by a cast of unusual young actors with at least two titanic performances worthy of Emmy awards (did they have the Emmy in 1958?)  Annette McCloud is an orphan from Beaver Junction who comes to the Los Angeles suburb of Ashford to a middle-class world of hayrides and malt shops, and a crowd of wealthy high schoolers who view her as a freak.  When she gets off the train in her straw suitcase, her own home-made dress, and long unruly hair a la Jennifer Jones in DUEL IN THE SUN, she looks like an anomaly from some other century.  She introduces herself to an aunt and uncle who don't even know she's alive.  I wondered about this part--why couldn't Archie and Lila at least have known of her existence?  The fact that they never bothered finding out what had become of their black sheep brother Bryce showed, to me, a certain heartlessness never really addressed by the film.  And also, why did they have Archie and Lila as brother and sister?  Wouldn't it have made more sense for them to be a married couple?  The way it is now, I'm sorry, it's just plain kinky.

What is strange is that all, I mean ALL, the adults eeem like grandparents and not parents.  How old are they supposed to be?  The mother of Tim Considine (Steven Abernathy) looks like Helen Hayes playing the Snoop Sisters--and yet figuring by the calendar, she's probably not yet 40.

Annette is charming, if only occasionally lifelike.  Her character is constantly being told she's not confrontational enough, and so two more volcanic personalities find it easy to steal the show--Roberta Shore as Laura Rogan, a visiting debutante who rules the entire teen social world of Ashford, and rules it with an iron fist.  Beautiful, seductive, charming, blessed with a lovely voice and a great way of selling a song, Laura is also a deadly snob and soon finds a way to accuse poor Annette of stealing a valuable necklace.  Oh, that necklace!  I just finished watching Max Ophuls' French melodrama THE EARRINGS OF MADAME DE and in all honestly, if you're interested in losing precious jewelry, hat happens to Laura's necklace in the story of Annette is a much more cinematic and fulfilling story.  Roberta Shore is what Susan Sontag used to call Fascinating Fascism--when she's on the screen, even in a crowd scene, one hunts her out just to see how much attitude she's striking.  I make her seem totally mannered, the miracle is she's not, she's natural as rain, and gorgeous to boot.

In the opposite corner we have Jett Maypen, the farmer tomboy girl who delivers eggs and chickens to Mary Wickes (Katy, the maid to Uncle Archie and Aunt Lila).  Jett becomes Annette's best friend somewhat against Lila's wishes, for Lila wants Annette ot have more sophisticated friends.  As played by Judy Nugent, Jett is one hot potato just simmering with class rage and what looks like good old fashioned twilight passion--the love for Annette that dare not speak its name.  Laura scorns Jett as beyond the social pale, but she sure cleans up nice, and before long, she is surprising the audience with her frank appreciation for Tim Considine's dreamy features.  ""He shore knows how to make a fellow feel good!""  Daytime TV in the fifties offered no more exciting confrontation than the final poolside smackdown between Laura and Jett, and now the entire serial is available in one of those Disney Treasures tin boxes.

It's a musical too, sort of, with great numbers for Annette (""How Do I Know My Love""?), Roberta Shore (""The Three Rs of Today"" and her masterpiece ""Don't Jump to Conclusions""), Annette and David Stollery (from SPIN and MARTY, here playing a hardworking soda-jerk (""Meeting at the Malt Shop"") among others.  There's a subplot of two subteens, Olmstead Steady Ware and a girl called Kit who looks like one of the little people but I don't think is.  The two of them are energetic and bizarre, like twin Urkels.  This is worth 200 dollars or even 3.  God bless Annette, we never let a day go by without saying a prayer for her continued success battling MS.",1228953600,5,4098,4.716292134831461

2117206,5,B0002S64UK,"I am quoting the theme song from this Mickey Mouse Club Serial, which was also a ""Fun With Music Day"" song by Jimmie Dodd, and cheering too, because if you read Mouse Tracks, you know Annette is very special to us. This DVD set is somewhat of an event. It's also an interesting coincidence that is has been released within weeks of the Hannah Montana Season One DVD. Again if you read Mouse Tracks, there is a definite connection between today's Disney pop star and Walt's first and most beloved.

Leonard Maltin's commentary and two special bonus mini-documentaries give you a brief overview of Annette's career as America's first female teen pop idol, from her selection by Walt to her beach party movie days, and gently touching on her more recent bout with Multiple Sclerosis (which resulted in her and her husband, Glen Holt, creating a foundation to help others with the affliction -- how can you not love her even more?)

It's the subject of many a Disney fan's roundtable discussion as to how Annette became such a phenomenon while the Mickey Mouse Club odds-on favorite for breakout stardom at the beginning was the gifted Darlene Gillespie (and if you have not heard her version of Alice in Wonderland with the great Tutti Camarata, I highly recommend you download it from iTunes -- it's my favorite record album.)

Maltin's comments add fuel to the discussion by mentioning that one reason Walt may have selected her was because her ethnicity, in a very white bread period for television, made her stand out. It's fascinating to consider his instincts and strategies as well as his knack for knowing what would appeal to the public.

The serial, which covers 20 12-minute episodes taking up about three hours total, was originally presented as a daily segment on the last season that the Mickey Mouse Club would feature new material (the following season consisted of edited earlier shows). From February 10 (the ""Introduction"" episode) to March 7 (""The Mystery is Solved"") you would see either a cartoon, musical number, special guest, circus act or young talent.

The serial was often followed by a Jimmie Dodd message segment in which he would tell an Aesop story, convey a Mousekethought or introduce another Mouseketeer with an inspiring message. The Mickey Mouse Club Presents Annette DVD contains two 1958 Mickey Mouse Club shows (the first and last to present Annette) to give you the context if you're not familiar with the original series.

The Annette serial, based on a teen novel by Poky Little Puppy author Jeannette Sebring Lowrey, was the a showcase for Annette Funicello and many other young performers including her soon-to-be-real-life best friend Shelley Fabares (The Donna Reed Show, ""Johnny Angel""), Roberta (Jymme) Shore (The Shaggy Dog, The Virginian), Tim Considine (The Shaggy Dog, My Three Sons) and Judy Nugent (who likely was a replacement for Darlene Gillespie who was to co-star when the serial was called Annette and Darlene but was assigned to the ill-fated Rainbow Road to Oz).

It also features many of Hollywood's best character actors, like Sylvia Field (Mrs. Wilson on Dennis the Menace), Doris Packer (Principal Mrs. Rayburn on Leave it to Beaver) and Richard Deacon -- who was playing pompous Fred Rutherford, Lumpy's father, during this period on Leave it to Beaver, and would soon become Mel Cooley on The Dick Van Dyke Show. All of these performers make the most of sometimes stodgy dialogue and often add character subtexts that are not in the lines themselves.

The lady who ties the whole show together is the inimitable Mary Wickes, who was pretty much universally loved by everyone in show business and plays the kind straight-talking, earthy confidant that she reportedly really was in Hollywood circles, being a close pal of Lucille Ball and others. As Katie, Wickes not only opens the series by previewing virtually the entire storyline (an ingenious Mickey Mouse Club serial device that gave young viewers lots to look forward to plus the final cliffhanger to anticipate), she's the only one who seems to know what's going on -- a popular movie and role for a servile supporting character in Hollywood's early days.

One of the most fascinating things about watching Annette is seeing it as a TV time capsule of what appealed to teens at the time and comparing it to the Disney Channel shows today. The dialogue itself is interesting because it's not like screenwriter Lillie Hayward was unaware of basic teenspeak of the 50's, since some characters, like Steady, Laura and Jet, use more casual colloquialisms than Annette, Steve or Mike. But the big difference is that Laura is the villain and Steady and Jet are the less refined of their peers. TV of the that day, always eager to please viewers and sponsors with the ideal example of ""nice young ladies and gentlemen,"" do not allow the heroic characters to talk in slang beyond words like ""golly"" and ""keen."" Today's TV kid characters have no such lines of demarcation -- slang and sarcasm is up for grabs for all. The prime exception of the 50's era is Leave it to Beaver, which was more perceptive in some ways than its fellow family shows and featured more casual language among its lead characters.

I also noticed that, perhaps coincidentally, that the central plot about the lead being accused by the ""mean girl"" of stealing a necklace is also a subplot of a recent Disney Channel TV movie, Camp Rock (only it's a bracelet). Perhaps it's because the more we change, the more we stay the same. The seemingly insurmountable problems and joys of teenage life are fairly constant. That's why Archie comics have stood the test of time.",1227830400,30,5652,4.896551724137931
2117217,5,B0002S64UK,"I didn't grow up in the 50's, and didn't see these on the Mickey Mouse Club. But I recall seeing ""Annette"" on some reruns on the Disney channel. This is a great, corny anthology series that is very similar to the feel of an episode of ""Leave It To Beaver"" episode with hints of the movie ""Pollyanna."" The DVD is terrific, and it's easy to watch all the episodes in this serial in one sitting. The picture is super sharp, and it's very much about going back in time, and seeing what was ""representative"" of a teenager back in the 50's in a perfect world where hayrides, barbecues, malt shops, and sing-alongs are the norm. It is strange to see a completely white teenage world.

With that said, I do wish Disney had a play all feature. Each time an episode ends (and some of them last no more than 10 mins) it pops back to the main menu and then you'll need to select the next episode. The opening credits get tiring to sit through, so you'll need to fast forward each time through them.

As always, Leonard Maltin does a great introduction on both discs to provide historical perspective and context.

I hope Disney never stops issuing these great, unseen classics - both animated and live. I've been collecting these since the initial series started in their beautiful tin cans.

2117218,5,B0002S64UK,I have waited most of my life to see the whole Annette series.  Somehow I didn't get to see the complete series.  I love Annette and love this DVD!,1226793600,7,147,4.0344827586206895
2117219,5,B0002S64UK,"Continuing the fan-favorite Walt Disney Treasures collectible tin set, this one is ""The Mickey Mouse Club Presents: Annette."" Starring everyone's favorite Mouseketeer, Annette Funicello, showcased in an original 20-episode serial on DVD for the 50th anniversary of the serial's conclusion. This serial was featured on the Mickey Mouse Club and is presented in glorious black and white. Annette plays an orphan from the country who moves ""uptown"" to live with her wealthy Aunt & Uncle. Her aunt, played by Sylvia Field, will be recognizable as Mrs. Wilson from the original ""Dennis the Menace"" TV series. The ""Annette"" serial also stars Tim Considine and David Stollery (better known as ""Spin and Marty"") and Shelley Fabares, who became life-long friends with Annette.

The series does seem a little dated, but Annette is so natural that she really does make it enjoyable, even 50 years after it was first broadcast. This serial is also a fantastic time capsule with the Disney-fied version of what the 1950's were like. Each episode of the serial is extremely short, as The Mickey Mouse Club itself was only half an hour at this point.

Bonus features include:

* ""Musically Yours, Annette"" - From a 1992 interview, Annette recalls her career as a recording star and her years on ""The Mickey Mouse Club."" Also includes interviews with Annette's fellow teen idols Paul Anka, Frankie Avalon, and Fabian. It is touching to see how Annette stayed unspoiled and natural, even in her contemporary interview segments. The admiration from her coworkers is also evident. The Sherman Brothers practically glow when they speak of her, and her record producer Tutti Camarata explains how ""The Annette Sound"" was created by overdubbing her vocals.

* ""To Annette, With Love"" - Is a newly produced tribute that has interviews with many of the same people as the other featurette. It is extremely touching to see Annette's reverence for Walt Disney and appreciation of him and how he guided her career. There is no artifice or canned emotion with her. Interview clips include her mother, Tutti, Shelley Fabares, and more.

* The Mickey Mouse Club - The complete first and last episodes of the popular television program that featured the ""Annette"" serial where were broadcast between February 11, 1958 and March 7, 1958.
This set also includes a Certificate of Authenticity (set limited to 39,500 copies) as well as a postcard size publicity photo of Annette from this serial. There is also the usual introductory booklet with a table of contents. A very nice set that will appeal to Annette's fans.",1225929600,47,2584,5.056338028169014
2117220,5,B0002S64UK,"I think the previous reviewer reviewed the wrong DVD set, as I don't believe all those Donald Duck cartoons are included in this one. There may be a couple, as this set includes two complete episodes of the ""Mickey Mouse Club."" But this set features Annette Funicello and the live-action 20-part serial that she starred in during the Mickey Mouse Club's 1957-58 season and that is worth more than any Donald Duck cartoon.

The serial had a charming story about high schooler Annette McCloud trying to adjust to city life after moving there from a rural area following the death of her parents. It also features a great supporting cast, most of whom would co-star on prime-time TV series soon after. Richard Deacon, who would play Ward Cleaver's co-worker Fred Rutherford on ""Leave it to Beaver"" and producer Mel Cooley on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" and later Roger Buell on ""The Mothers In-Law,"" plays Annette's Uncle Archie; Sylvia Field, who would portray Mrs. Wilson on ""Dennis the Menace,"" plays Annette's Aunt Lila; Tim Considine, who would play oldest son Mike on ""My Three Sons"" 1960-65, plays one of the boys interested in Annette; Shelley Fabares, who would play daughter Mary on ""The Donna Reed Show"" 1958-63, plays one of Annette's friends; and Roberta Shore, who would co-star with Annette in the Disney feature film, ""The Shaggy Dog,"" and then play the ranch owner's niece on ""The Virginian"" in the 1960s, plays Annette's rival.

When ""Mickey Mouse Club"" episodes containing this serial were rerun on the Disney Channel a few years ago, the hayride episode in which Annette sings ""How Will I Know My Love"" was omitted. So it is nice to hear that all episodes are included in this set, as that song became a hit and launched Annette's recording career.

In short, this is a great nostalgic series and a true treasure for all fans of Annette Funicello.",1225152000,35,1861,4.809375

2117223,4,B0002S64UK,"My 55 year old baby sister and I watched this DVD together, and loved every minute of it.  But my own very personal reason for purchasing the DVD was to re-visit the 'What I Want to Be' series in its entirety.  I didn't realize that I wouldn't be getting the entire series when I made the purchase, so I was more than a little disappointed.  But on a more positive note, I believe that our most vivid and detailed memories are for many of us, the ones that we experienced as little kids, and for me, seeing those first five episodes of the WIWTB series took me back to those times like nothing else ever could.  It's actually scary for me, the way I actually remember so many of the script lines from more than fifty years ago!  And I hate to think what this former would-be airline pilot would be willing to pay the folks over at Disney to be able to see episodes 6 through 10 once again.  While I went on to do other things in my professional life, I will forever be inspired by that make-believe journey of that little boy Duncan in his own pilot's uniform riding shotgun in the cockpit of that magnificent TWA Constellation.  What a one-of-a-kind nostalgic rush!  My only reason for the four star rating (rather than five stars) is the ""missing"" episodes 6 through 10.  Disney should consider bundling WIWTB, Spin & Marty and the other short series in future DVDs for those of us who want it all, from beginning to end.  I'm waiting.....",1164499200,7,1441,4.40377358490566
2117224,4,B0002S64UK,"I have ordered this DVD set and will order any more that Disney puts on the market.

The sad part is that they will never be released as they were shot; IN COLOR.

I have read that even tho TV was still in black and white at the time. Walt Disney insisted that the Mickey Mouse Club be shot in Color. A Fact that should suprise no one.

Unfortunatly today's Disney keeps looking forward, and as a result we see poorly made remakes of the older movies. (What they did to Flubber still turns my stomach.) I know that these movies are outdated, but so am I. I still would rather see a movie that doesn't use bloody body count for ratings.

I have also heard that the old Mouseketeers (don't know how many) have filed a lawsuit. The lawsuit is indeed about residuals. And untill that is settled (maybe it has been, I don't know) we will get what falls thru the cracks.",1158796800,6,864,4.25
2117225,4,B0002S64UK,"Being a lifelong Disney fanatic, I have heard of the Mickey Mouse Club quite often, but never actually seen it.  Until I sat down to watch this set.

Part of the Walt Disney Treasures collection, this two disc DVD set contains the first week's worth of episodes from 1955.  Each of the five episodes runs approximately 47 minutes and are presented in black and white, which is how they were originally filmed and broadcast.

Monday, Wednesday, and Friday start off with newsreels.  A foreign concept now, they highlight kids around the world and things they are accomplishing.  Each episode contains another entry in the first series ""I Want to Be an Airline Pilot/Hostess"" which follows two kids as they get a behind the scenes tour of TWA.  Some of the attitudes are definitely 1950's gender rolls, but considering that's when it was created, nothing else should be expected.  Each episode also contains a Mickey Mouse cartoon.  Since the show was filmed in black and white, the cartoons are black and white as well no matter what their original color release was.  For those looking for the cartoons in color, it's best to look at other Disney Treasures releases.

Each episode also includes the Mouseketeers and the theme of the day.  Monday they get to sing and dance with ""The Friendly Farmer"" and ""The Shoe Song,"" a couple funny songs.  Tuesday brings guest Wally Boag and his puppet friend doing a show.  Also featured is a balloonist making animals while telling jokes.  When anything can happen on Wednesday, the Mouseketeers form a gadget band with the pans, bottles, and combs found lying around the set.  Thursday features the DeWaynes Acrobats for Circus Day.  Finally, Friday highlights the trumpet talent of Larry Ashurst and Mouseketeer Cubby O'Brien's drumming.

Just now watching these shows as an adult, I must confess I don't quite see the appeal.  Of course, I'm about 50 years too late and at least 20 years too old to be in the target audience.  After the first couple episodes, I was ready to quit.  Then an interesting thing happened.  I started to enjoy them.  Not that I want to sit down and watch every episode ever made of the show, but I was beginning to find something appealing about the hokey songs and antics.  By the end, I was disappointed that I didn't have the next episode to see what happened next in the serial.

No Disney Treasures set would be complete without some kind of bonus features.  Besides the introduction on both discs by Leonard Maltin, disc one features a tribute to head Mouseketeer Jimmie Dodd and disc two features six of the original Mouseketeers (Sharon Baird, Bobby Burgess, Lonnie Burr, Doreen Tracey, Cubby O'Brien, and Karen Pendleton) sharing memories of what it was like to be on the show.  Both are fascinating.  In addition, both discs contain stills galleries of behind the scenes pictures.  Disc two also contains the opening in color (it was filmed in both originally), and some footage of the Mouseketeer performance at Disneyland's opening day.

Some of the Disney Treasures sets are designed with a specific audience in mind.  This set will appeal most to Baby Boomers looking for a reminder of their childhood and confirmed Disney fanatics.  Others probably won't enjoy these five programs from fifty years ago.",1133740800,16,3288,4.8684684684684685
2117226,4,B0002S64UK,"When the Mickey Mouse Club aired in 1955, the New York Times predicted it would never last. But in 1955, an estimated 10 million kids tuned in, and at it's peak, Disney sold 26,000 pairs of mouse ears weekly. As reviewers have noted, this DVD is not the best of the MM Club. Instead of rating episodes, Disney went for historical value. Here's the first week of hour long shows. The talent line up went like this: Monday: Fun with Music Day; Tuesday: Guest Star Day; Wednesday: Anything Can Happen Day; Thursday: Circus Day; Friday: Talent Round-Up Day.

The best of the extras include Leonard Maltin's intros ( a staple on all Disney Treasures DVDs) and a reunion with the Mousketeers. As many people are beginning to realize, Disney's live action productions were second only to his animation. No, this isn't the best of the club run (Another video has been released with the ""best"" on it). But it is a trip back down memory lane to when TV was a new fantasyland, and a dreamer named Disney put kids on the stage and turned it upside down.",1129248000,25,1041,4.537234042553192
2117237,5,B0002S64UK,I bought the DVD to review so my friends and I could do a skit for a 50's fundraiser.  I can't tell you how much I enjoyed viewing all the original programs on the DVD's.  It certainly took me back to my childhood.  I will cherish this for many years to come.  I was not disappointed at all.,1126051200,14,291,3.9655172413793105

2117240,3,B0002S64UK,"When Disney said they were going to release the Mickey Mouse Club by the week, I was excited. Why have they only released one so far, what's the hold up? I'm still waiting for additional episides to be released.

 Like many other reviewers, I'd like to to see the serials released seperately. Such as ""Spin and Marty"",  The ""Annette"" serial, ""Corky and White Shadow"", and of course, the wonderful ""Hardy Boys"" serials.

But my favorites are Kevin Corcoran as ""Moochie"" in ""Moochie of the Little League"" and ""Moochie of Pop Warner Football"" who was also in ""Spin and Marty"".  When the Disney Channel first came out in the 1980's they showed these great shows so I know they're around, so please release them on DVD.",1119312000,9,714,4.68
2117241,4,B0002S64UK,"This is a very nice set to have, but I do have some gripes.  While it's cool to see the show's very first episode or two, the novelty wears off and we slowly realize that the show hadn't yet hit it's stride, so what we get are five OK episodes, while hundreds of far superior ones lie waiting in dusty Disney storerooms.

A glassy-eyed and downright giddy Leonard Maltin hosts once again. I really wish Disney would find someone else to do this.  Actually the ""hosting"" isn't even really neccessary.  After all, we are not just the casual Disney fans buying these Disney Treasures DVDs, and often the commentary seems aimed at the total Disney novice.

The Mouseketeer reunion on Disc Two is nice, as several of the originals discuss their lives during and after The Club.  It doesn't offer much information not easily available elsewhere, but their obvious affection for the Club and each other is appealing.

The ""Mouseketeer Roll Call"" listed as a bonus feature on this set is unfortunately nothing more than just a list of the names of the original Mouseketeers.  My favorite bonus feature is the fuzzy but interesting ""The Mouseketeers Debut at Disneyland"" a color sequence of the original group performing live. The menu design is very nice, but I found no Easter Eggs.

All in all, this is a nice addition to the Disney Treasures Collection, I only wish they had included some more various 50's episodes so we could see the other (far better) opening sequences and talent portions.  Also, with many of the classic cartoons now available in color, it's almost tragic to have to watch them in black and white.

Speaking of color, I would like to vote for the release of some episodes of the New Mickey Mouse Club from the 70's.  Besides being in color (Walt had always intended to bring the Club to audiences in color and I think the 70's team did him more than proud) these shows boast another terrific (and refreshingly multi-ethnic) batch of kids, great production numbers and classic Disney serials and cartoons in COLOR.  This was head and shoulders better than the 90's club in that the Disney spirit really came through.",1115683200,6,2132,4.72972972972973

They don't make kids tv programming like this anymore, the show had education ""news reel"", and it showed serials of little shows that your kids would be able to watch without learning anything bad, or bad influences. And they mixed education and learning with the fun of watching this great show. This great treasure, is a dvd  set I highly suggest that you all buy. It is full with movie stars that grew up to become great actors and actoresses, like Annette Funicello who grew up to be remembered as that sweet little star, with good morals, who now is sadly very ill. And Bobby Burgess, who was on Lawrence Welk. And many others. I also loved the Mickey Mouse Club reuniting, where they talk to Leonard Maltin about their fondest memories of the show. Great Set.

2117244,5,B0002S64UK,"These two CDs demonstrate how great The Mickey Mouse Club was from the very first week. The hourlong shows are the only way to properly evaluate how far ahead of its time this program was, in respects beyond just the participation of the Mouseketeers. ""What I Want to Be"" may be criticized for some as hokey and sexist, but it was crisply written by none other than Stirling Silliphant, who rose quickly from being a mere publicist at  Disney to writing this and other serial material for  MMC. The great Alvy Moore is the correspondent who recruits little Pat Morrow and Duncan Richardson for job training at TWA in Kansas City. Pat Morrow was roughly 10 at the time of this production. She went on to become highly visible as a campaign groupie for John F. Kennedy in 1960, and later became a suffering slut on Peyton Place. But in this series, she looks as if she had been conceived from a Norman Rockwell painting, or from the mind of Disney animator Ward Kimball. She was an incredibly gifted little actress, and Richardson also looks as if he were straight out of a Rockwell cover.

Disney was obligated to produce 39 weeks of these one hour shows for two years, after ABC advanced $1 million to him to finish the construction of Disneyland. He was not stupid. He used MMC as a vehicle to sell the new amusement park, as evidencde in the very first newsreels. He also got a big assist from TWA in the making of the serial, ""What I Want to Be."" Out of such audacity, the art of cross promotion and product placement was truly born. Disney also furnished many if not most of the commercials aired within the original hour shows. The sped up voice of Jimmie Dodd, for example, was used as the voice of Bucky Beaver, the character selling Ipana toothpaste. The Mouseketeers were also seen in some commercials, i.e. a long series of spots for One-A-Day vitamins.

Jimmie Dodd's brilliance is on complete display within the set. There is a great bonus tribute to the head Mouseketeer, but it is marred by the misspelling of his name at the end of the special bonus feature. How this could have happened speaks volumes for the lack of quality control under the current Disney regime. I still hope for additions to this series. At least some evidence of the ""Spin and Marty"" serials should be made available to those who truly loved watching these original shows.

One thought on the Mouseketeers. It is remarkable how many ethnic groups were represented during the first season. Annette's exotic ap;peal is very evident from the first moment she appears. The dancing abilities of Sharon Baird and Bobby Burgess are also obvious. These are pros at work, not just kids. But the original Mouseketeers also included one other Italian, Mary Sartori, at least two Jewish Americans, Doreen Tracey and Judy Harriet Spiegelman, and a Mexican Ameican, Mary Espinosa. Though not seen on this set, Disney also included a Japanese American boy, Georga Nagata, to narrate a serial called ""Children of the world."" African American acts were common on Talent roundup Day.

This new set is also noteworthy in that it includes several Mouseketeers who became early casualties, such as Nancy Abbate, Johnny Crawford, and Mickey Rooney's two young sons. Even Paul Petersen demonstrates why he was fired after just three  weeks. He is seen twice, and both times appears hyper beyond control.

I always had the biggest crush on Cheryl Holdridge, who was not added to the roster until the second season. I am hoping to see a DVD release based on season two, for that reason alone. But this set is remarkable, and I never tire of watching it.",1110326400,19,3617,4.712025316455696
2117245,4,B0002S64UK,"Don't expect to be glued to your chair watching the five original one-hour episodes: the opening sequences, as somebody else said, are slick and polished; but the remaining portions of the shows are mostly, well, boring.

It's the bonus material where you'll find the gold. The opening animation in color is shocking to see, it is so vibrant! And seeing some of the original Mouseketeers today was intriguing. I was struck by how sober-faced ""Cubby"" has become; maybe he was having a bad day? Bobby and Karen and Darlene: they are just too cool. And then there is Lonnie, who is looking a bit like Uncle Fester (I hated to say that, as he seems like a totally nice person).

The cast was sitting in front of the original curtains used in the series, but this time, we get to see those curtains in color.

And the opening day at Disneyland, when the Mouseketeers were introduced to the world for the first time (nobody really knew who they were, because they had not yet been on television)...that, too is a treat, especially the color sequences.

This DVD set is better than the sad VHS releases of recent years, the latter containing only chopped up shows and the same ""We're the Mouseketeers..."" opening.

Here are the first five shows, complete with everything, including the kids out of apron-dresses and into their sweaters and ears. It's quite fun looking at Mouseketeers like Mike, Bonnie, Nancy, and others who wouldn't last past the season, and/or were relegated to second string.

Jimmy is here with his words of wisdom at the end, I always loved Jimmie Dodd too. We actually see Roy drawing pictures, something else left out of the tapes.

My only beef is that 5 shows isn't enough! Will Disney please release more?!

The shows seem a bit cheesy, but, if I had kids, I'd rather them watch this than the garbage and filth of today.

2117260,5,B0002S64UK,"Here's a breakdown of the five episodes

Monday, October 3, 1955

The first ever ""Mickey Mouse Club"" kicks off with a Newsreel that, for some odd reason, promotes several Disney projects. Isn't it odd that the news would be promotional pieces? (Yes, I'm being sarcastic.) I got a particular kick out of the airboat piece about a Native American who holds a grudge against the white man, yet drives two kids through the swamps of Florida. You'd think they'd like a chaperone on board. For Fun with Music Day, a musical bit called ""The Friendly Farmers"" kills time, but is one of the least impressive bits in this set. It felt too simple for a show that didn't do that very often. The ""Show Song"" is more impressive, as it combines the kids' ability to sing and dance, and Roy's ability to draw, as he sketches out their songs.

 ""What I Want to Be"" kicks off here with noble intentions about helping children discover what kinds of futures are available, only to then lock them in based on their gender. Pat, a little girl with a dream to travel the world, is chosen by a representative of the Mickey Mouse Club to learn about being an airline hostess. She knows a certain boy who she thinks can be a pilot, but he doesn't believe in himself. But that has to wait until tomorrow, because it's Mousekartoon time. ""Pueblo Pluto"" features Mickey and Pluto in the Southwest. Highly detailed and well-painted, this is trademark Disney. Jimmie Dodd takes his spot as the closer, telling what's in store over the next week.

Tuesday, October 4, 1955

Guest Star Day introduces a British friend named Sooty, a mute bear hand-puppet, and his puppeteer. Though it looks stupid to start, whenever they close-in on him, it's cute as hell. I'll admit, I laughed a few times. The Guest Star happens to be Wally Boag. I don't think I need to say anymore considering how famous Wally Boag is. Oh that Wally Boag. Seriously, he was apparently a ""stand-up entertainer"" at Disneyland. Guests don't get any bigger than him and his talk-show act, which must have gone over every kid's head.

""What I Want to Be"" continues with part two, where the object of Pat's affections, Duncan, has to show he has the goods with a gas-propelled plane. Pat stands by her man, even when things look glum, and in a moment of emotion that wouldn't fly today, threatens his foe with death. For her efforts, she's being sent to Hostess School, whether she likes it or not. With the drama over, it's Mousekartoon time, which is a Mickey and Pluto show, titled ""Mickey's Kangaroo."" Oddly, Pluto speaks (or rather thinks out loud) a first in my Pluto experience. This has the effect of making him the creepiest Disney character ever. Jimmie is back with a ""final"" word, this time about the importance of perseverance. He also slips in a Disney plug, for good measure.

Anything Can Happen Day lives up to its name with the Newsreel, which is a winner. The narrator seems upset when one child doesn't die in a boat crash, then we watch an African tribe burn their children's possessions in a manhood ritual. It only gets better from there, with swimming babies and junior rodeos. A gadget band performance by the Mouseketeers, using only items like bottles and cans, increases the weirdness, thanks to a bizarre Hawaiian-themes monologue by a ""park cleaner.""

""What I Want to Be,"" part four gets off to a great start with a sign on the door that says ""Hostess School - Women Only."" Once Pat gets ditched at Girl School, Duncan gets to have some fun, heading up to the control tower. Unlike later installments, Pat is completely forgotten about this time. That's just as well, as the Mousekartoon, ""Mickey's Service Station,"" is waiting to go. Mickey, Donald and Goofy are all in on this one, a rather old episode, based on the guys' character models. This one is as silly as the Mickey cartoons get, going as far as having Goofy goose himself. Jimmie follows it up with a plea for kids to help their parents out around the house. Can't argue with that one.

""No Fool,"" a musical Jiminy Cricket cartoon about bicycle safety, kicks things off, with dire warnings that would probably be cut in today's kid-safe environment. It's Circus Day, which means the show features a performance by a troupe of acrobats. By today's standards, it's nothing special, but back then, it must have been something else. The segment that stands out the most though has to be part four of ""What I Want to Be,"" which focuses on the airline industry. Pat learns about the ridiculous career available for women at airlines, as she sees women go through a ""makeup analysis,"" making sure her hair is the right length, he height and weight fall into the right standard and that she knows how to bend over correctly. I'm not kidding. Duncan, on the other hand, finds out about becoming a pilot, and all the interesting tools involved in making sure a flight goes just right. If I was a girl in 1955, I can imagine I would be a bit depressed.

 Annette handles the hosting duties for the Mousekartoon, ""The Wise Little Hen,"" a story about what being lazy will get you, featuring an old-style Donald Duck. The level of detail is amazing when compared to the bargain-basement animation seen in modern cartoons. Just before the show wraps up with the familiar refrain, Jimmie gives a message about paying your own way. At least he was speaking the truth. If only kids heard this stuff today.

Talent Round-Up Day starts with a Mickey Mouse Club Newsreel, which shows what kind of freakiness was going on back in 1955. A twisted boxing match between 8-year-olds leads into a series of odd news bites. At least this one isn't quite as self-promoting as Monday's. As part of the Talent Round-Up, a young trumpeter plays two songs (though he looks to be faking it) and Cubby himself brings his dad and brother on-stage to deliver a pretty impressive drum performance. Part five of ""What I Want to Be"" has Pat nearing Stepford Wife status in her air hostess training, while Duncan is supposedly ready to handle a flight. These segments are one of the few parts of the series that really was troublesome. It's back to fun though as Bobby introduces the Mousekartoon, ""Two-Gun Mickey,"" an early western starring Mickey and Minnie. A kid's cartoon featuring cigarette rolling and gunfighting is unheard of today, which makes this such an interesting artifact. Jimmie's back to deliver his message of the day, this time about being friendly.

The DVDs

Disney's split the first week of the ""Mickey Mouse Club"" between two DVDs, with Monday through Wednesday on disc one, and the rest on the second DVD. Each disc features an introduction by Leonard Maltin, shot at the Disney studios. The episodes are in their original full-frame black-and-white, while the menus are static and full-screen, with music from the show. Each episode has scene selections, and optional English captions to go with the Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtrack. The discs come packed in a double-thick white keepcase, inside the now signature collectible tin case. Inside the case is a ""collectible art"" card, which is a reprouction of the cover of the original sheet music to Dodd's ""Mickey Mouse March,"" a numbered (out of 130,000) certificate of authenticity and a high-quality 6-page booklet that features the text version of Maltin's first-disc introduction, a content listing (with incorrect second-disc info) and some photos and art. Attached (by a thread of glue) to the back of the tin case is the rear art, which repeats the back cover of the keepcase.

The Quality

Considering the majority of the source materials found in his set are nearly 50 years old, the final product is very impressive. The shows do have some visible grain and dirt and scratches, but overall, the footage is very crisp. Obviously, there's not really any color (except in the bonus materials) but the tones in the old footage looks very good. I don't remember this video looking even close to this good when it was on TV. The new video in the bonus features is crisp and without any problems. The audio, presented in Dolby Digital 2.0, is as good as can be expected, with the songs and dialogue sounding as good as any TV show made today. It's so good that I could hear the words spoken clearer than the caption writer, who got several words wrong.

The Extras

The first disc has two special features, including a touching featurette on Dodd, ""The Leader of the Club"" (9:00). The musical talent behind the show and the adult presence on-screen, Dodd was apparently one of those ""good people"" who gave freely of himself and lived his life by the ""Good Book."" As Maltin says, he was perfect for this show, and that if he didn't exist, Disney would have had to invent him. Amazingly, unlike with most children's show hosts, none of the Mousketeers has a bad word to say about him. I was surprised to see the topic of religion is actually broached in the conversation, but it seems only appropriate for him. The ending of the segment, with a clip from the show, is spot-on and beautifully positioned as a tribute to Dodd.

Far less emotional is a set of three Still Galleries, broken up into ""Inside the Clubhouse"" (on the set), ""Spreading the Word: Mouseke-Promotion"" (marketing materials) and ""Sketching the Ideas"" (design concepts.) In all, there are 90 pieces to look at (54, 17 and 9 respectively in their categories), including black and white and color photos, interesting promotional items and concept sketches for props and sets. These are worth at least one spin through. Looking at the ""Clubhouse"" photos, they are so good, it almost seems like they were taken on the set of a modern movie about the Club. There's an instruction screen included in the galleries that explains how to navigate through it.

Disc Two has a trio of bonus features, starting with ""Mouseke-Memories,"" (14:30) a reunion of six of the original Mousketeers (Sharon, Lonnie, Cubby, Bobby, Karen and Doreen), hosted by Leonard Maltin. (It will look familiar, as the footage for ""The Leader of the Club"" was shot at the same time.) The sit-down chat takes place on the original soundstage, in front of the original curtain backdrop. They talk about how they got on the show, their favorite memories and their castmates, including the late Roy and Jimmie, as well as Annette, who couldn't make it to the interview. This is light and fluffy material, but it's interesting to see the Mousketeers all grown up and to hear their stories.

Introduced by Maltin, ""The Mouseketeers Debut at Disneyland"" is a newly-constructed bit of footage using the original live black-and-white TV introduction of the Mouseketeers at the theme park and recently discovered color film of the event. A much larger group than the one that later appeared on TV, this cast performed the opening later used for the first Talent Round-Up. The color footage is so vibrant that it's hard to imagine that it's almost 50 years old.

 Maltin returns to introduce another new rarity, in the form of a color version of the ""Mickey Mouse Club"" animated open. Disney did the into theme in color and black-and-white, and the color version, which never aired, is outstanding. The quality and creativity is simply incredible. The coloring adds another dimension to what was already an outstanding piece of animation, making it just that much better. Truly a terrific find for animation buffs.

The Bottom Line

For any fan of television history, Disney or just the Mickey Mouse Club, this is a fascinating DVD set; a trip back to a very different time. In a way, it's sad to know this kind of show just wouldn't work today, because for all the politically incorrect things it incorporated, it was a wholesome and entertaining way for kids to learn and have fun. Thankfully, Disney doesn't seem to feel the need to deny history (at least for these discs) and gives us the original shows, no matter what they say. Though the extras seem a bit light for the cost of the set, the material is quite good, and should satisfy anyone who's ever wanted to put on the ears.

This really  is a special  set and its so wonderful it is now on  DVD!!

2117261,3,B0002S64UK,"Although I'm glad the MM Club is finally on DVD, this release could have been so much more. With numerous TV shows being issued in complete seasons, there's no excuse to only release  just one week of MM club episodes, except perhaps greed. Even the 5 days a week soap, ""Dark Shadows"", has several 4 disc/$40 sets that each cover months of shows. I believe with black and white episodes, you can squeeze more on a disc than color? A better idea would be to craft multi-disc sets around the serials, with a box set for each serial storyline. I believe there were several Spin & Marty stories, as well as Hardy Boys, Annette, etc. If those come out- I'm buying 'em! Are you listening Disney?",1103155200,26,689,4.468253968253968
2117262,5,B0002S64UK,"I fondly remember watching reruns of the MMC on our ABC affiliate when I was only five. I was so inspired by the singing and dancing of the young cast, and cried after each

episode. Viewing the episodes as an adult was fascinating. Both of these disks represent a 1950's America--a time capsule of sorts. It's wonderful to see Jimmy Dodd espousing virtue and morals. And, it's refreshing to see a simpler less sophistaced way of life. There is a great introduction by Leonard Malten. In it, he mentions that these original episodes may be considered quaint by today's children. To test this theory, I sat my three year old in front of the screen. He smiled, and tried to sing along with the mouseketeers!! He also enjoyed the mouse cartoons! Fortunately, here's one child who didn't find the material quaint,  but very entertaining. I loved the bonus material, which included interviews with some of the mouseketeers conducted by Leonard Malten. Both DVD's are very well done, formatted with an easy to use menu.

This was truly taking a trip back in time for me. I can only hope that Disney will release more of these original MMC shows. This DVD does indeed live up to the ""Disney Treasures"" label.",1102723200,12,1201,4.70952380952381
