If you already own ""The Movie Box,"" there is probably no point in buying the Blu-Ray (as all the tracks and even bonus audio-tracks are the same). However, if you don't own any version of this, it's worth purchasing. This was an excellent concert. Be aware, however, that the video quality is limited by the fact that it was filmed in 16mm. Instead, the reason to purchase this disc is to hear the band performance right as they were reaching their creative peak.",1412121600,64,630,4.535087719298246

452007,1,6302314399,"This is one of my favorite albums by Genesis, and when I saw the DVD, I had to have it.  I heated up my tube amps and started watching it, then it happened, THEY cut away from the concert to show the members talking about the song or something.  They completely left the concert and showed film of other stuff, then they did it again and again.  Some songs are complete, but not many, at some point I just turned it off in disgust.  As I said I have liked this album for a long time and watching Phil Collins also did not match my mind's expectations.  I assumed he was the drummer in the band for obvious reasons, yet he had a very capable drummer, and Phil took the part of band-member who sings in a band.  He dis play dual drummer on some songs that in hindsight made sense of the complex riffs on drums, so that was cool.  Then later in the concert Phil the singer takes his shirt off for the rest of the concert/flashback/interview/documentary...  The concert part was great, had they showed the other stuff as a bonus instead of cutting away would have gotten it 5 stars, even though I do not understand how shirtless Phil sang better!",1425772800,5,1142,4.303738317757009

452383,3,6302314399,"This is a failure for me from a BD/DVD authoring perspective.  It would have been nice to have an option to play the concert; Uninterrupted by commentary and seemingly random backstage footage.  Cutting out during Duchess to see some random scene backstage is disjointed to me.  Likewise, cutting out to see the stage hands servicing keyboards and tuning guitars is just random.  Granted, it is possible the footage was lost, but I doubt it.  I think they were just lazy and transferred the VHS and cleaned it up.

Overall, the sound quality and picture quality does have some benefit from the BD transfer.

Again, this needed menu options as follows, but DOESN'T;
1.)  Play Concert Straight Through  *****
2.)  Play Concert (Original Release w/commentary and backstage footage)
3.)  Play Concert AUDIO ONLY + Bonus Tracks (i.e. treat it like a BluRay Audio)",1418688000,7,858,4.971830985915493

452459,3,6302314399,"First off I would like to say that the sound on the release is very good. Much better than the crunchy compressed cd.
On to the bad.  Yes, I understand that the back cover clearly explains that video portion is intercut with band interviews and commentary but I ask was that necessary! The commantary could easily have been added as an extra on this disc. Getting into the song only to have it cut short or interrupted proved to be a bigger problem for me than I thought. I am only saying this because you may feel this as well.

The 4:3 aspect ratio could have easily been 16:9. Yes, I also understand that was also described on the back cover but allow me to just say that it could have been done with 16:9. After all the Supertramp blu ray show from 1979 did it. Why not here? Cost cutting, lack of attention. Who knows. It would have been nice in 16:9 aspect ratio.

There are some good moments here and it's worth the purchase if one can get it a very discounted price. I will recommend it since there was technically  no shenanigans here.

Is three stars harsh when I was fair and square warned about my above gripes. Maybe, maybe not. This show was amazing and I just wanted to see more of it.",1417737600,9,1200,4.2687224669603525

452463,2,6302314399,"I really believe this is a complete failure as a DVD. The live concert video content is incomplete and replete
with constant truncations of the performances. The best material is available as music only content
and is missing the version of ""Watcher Of The Skies"" as was included on side four of the LP of this
concert. I believe all of the side four LP cuts (UK VERSION) included Steve Hackett on guitar and it's unfortunate that
these tracks could not be included as video content. Like the original LP release (USA) I find this material
to be completely lacking.",1416960000,4,565,4.66
452464,5,6302314399,"This was a much better concert video than I remember. The performances are spectacular -- what great musicianship by everyone ... all about music and not image. Does this kind of band even exist today?

The camera editing is great. It always seems the camera is on the right musician at the right time. Further, the edits are not five per second like so many of today's music video editors. If you want to see Phil Collins as the monster musician that he is (or was) - this is your video. This is not to take away from the great performances by the Tony and Mike (or Chester). My only criticism is that I would like the concert to be run straight through without interruption of interviews - they should be separated out. But easy fix - click the skip button. Many of the Genesis purists feel that Genesis was over when Peter Gabriel left, but in my humble opinion, they were at their peak with Abacab, and this concert shows it.",1416787200,,929,4.401162790697675
452465,4,6302314399,"I remembered this video having the songs all chopped up with interviews and generally being terrible.  I think Duchess is the only song that is really kind of interrupted by interview footage, the rest of the songs are clear and in their entirety.  Blu ray makes this stuff sound and look as good as it ever will, at least they went to the effort of a DTS HD track and included a lot of audio only songs as well so high marks for the presentation and remastering effort that went into this disc.  The price is also very reasonable.

As to the content, this was like my gateway drug into the world of '70s Genesis as the In the Cage medley was my first exposure to the '70s material, which I eventually grew to like far more than anything Genesis did in the '80s.  I now side with those who say the band went to hell after Hackett left, even though I liked the songs on this disc a lot at the time it came out.  So if you like this time period of the band, I wholeheartedly recommend this disc, I don't think this will change anyone's mind if you hate '80s Genesis however and there is only the In the Cage medley to represent the classic '70s stuff.",1416441600,4,1149,4.2

452523,2,6302314399,"I grew up with this music, and my band even played several pieces from the era (e.g. Dodo/Lurker, Abacab, etc.). Simply LOVE Genesis from this particular stage in their writing careers. I've had this album on vinyl (still do), as well as CD. It's a great compilation of music from their American tour at the time.

I remember seeing this on VHS years ago. Of course, I thought it would be even better on Blu-Ray format. Alas, I was wrong. There is virtually no difference in the overall quality (visually), but the sound has been done fairly well. Albeit, there's not much one can do with a sound transfer either. The intro menu is quite nice, however, and gives the viewer the impression that there's going to be something visually stunning to come. Short snippets of the original camera angles are crystal clear (as intended), and leads the viewer to believe that the rest of this disc will yield the same clarity -- believe me, it doesn't even come close.

Visually, it was originally shot in 4:3 (full frame), and not letterbox. So...the viewer has to endure the dreaded black bars on either side of the screen. Likewise, the original graininess is left intact, and there is so much poor clarity that it almost looks like a direct VHS transfer. While I realize the limitations of the age, there is, at least to me, no reason this should have been released on Blu-ray at all. They should have stuck to a regular DVD, and called it a day.

It is an inexpensive trip down the Genesis Memory Lane, but that's about all. Great performances of several tunes from that era are downed within a less than visual compliment to the musicianship at hand. It is grainy, sometimes muddy, and poorly directed overall. Transfer quality is simply sub-par, and not worthy of any Blu-ray quality expectations. I hate to say it, but I would certainly pass on this one if you're expecting anything better than VHS quality.",1416096000,27,1905,4.663690476190476
452524,5,6302314399,"Just got this today.  What a great dvd the quality is really good for a concert filmed in 1981.  Great bands are able to carry on with success after losing significant band members.  Van Halen did it after losing Dave and Pink Floyd did it without Roger Waters.  This a snapshot of Genesis beginning to take those first significant steps without Peter Gabriel, Although Peter did go on to have a good pop music career with songs like ""Sledgehammer"".

452528,5,6302314399,"I purchased this off of iTunes and watched it on AppleTV. Although there's nothing new material wise from the previous DVD release, the HD conversion is well worth it. If you're a fan of this era of Genesis like me, it's a no-brainer. If you're a fan of concert footage in general, it's a no-brainer. Watch this film, then watch a current concert ""film."" You will see the downside of digital video. Concert footage today - highlights are blown, colors harsh, everything over-sharpened. Three Sides Live - not a single blown highlight, colors are rich and vibrant, beautiful grain that reveals pleasing analog detail. It's a shame that we'll probably never see concerts captured the same way again.

Do be aware that the sides are ""cropped"" on wide-screen tv. This is because the movie was shot on 16mm but take solace in the fact that if they were to expand it to wide-screen to fill all that real-estate, you'd miss the top and bottom of the captured frame.",1415491200,16,958,4.7023809523809526
452529,5,6302314399,"This is definitely Genesis at their peak post-progressive. I have been a Genesis fan since 1968 and I personally prefer the Gabriel/Hackett era stuff (progressive rock) overall, but the early post-progressive Genesis is good up to Abacab. Most of their stuff after Abacab is Top 40 radio sell-out. Duke is one of my all-time favorite albums cover-to-cover. The Three Sides Live sets focused primarily on music from Duke and Abacab (the concert/movie has some of the early prog stuff thrown in, but not much) and was a great live album when it came out in 1982. I also had this on cassette tape in the '80s (self-recorded from an LP of course) and wore it out! The video quality of the Blu-ray DVD is pretty good, considering the original master is 16mm. And I had this concert/movie on LaserDisc, so the Blu-ray is a joy to watch (although LD audio quality was very good back in the day; video not so much). The DVD audio is clean and clear--play it LOUD!!

While Three Sides Live is early 1980's (the early 1980's was still giving us ""just get on the stage and play"" music; unfortunately, that would change later in the decade thanks to music videos), it is straight-at-you Genesis with no corny choreography and antics. Who Dunnit? might be the exception. Just five dudes jamming (Phil/Mike/Tony add Daryl Stuermer on guitar/bass and Chester Thompson on drums--Phil plays drums on a couple of tracks only). However, Phil dons an almost-full head of hair, 1980's wrist sweatbands and removes his shirt halfway through the show--you have been warned!!!

The behind-the-scenes footage is enjoyable to watch as well. It is dispersed in with the songs so you are more or less forced to watch it. Not for everyone, but I don't mind it. Being a huge fan of the group and not just the music, I find it interesting. Not all of the filmed footage over the concert period is presented as live concert footage on the DVD--some songs are audio only (presented as Bonus Tracks on the Blu-ray). I guess you could say this is more of a tour movie than a concert.

In contrast, I own Peter Gabriel's Live in Athens concert Blu-ray DVD and it's almost unwatchable as a concert; it's so ""1980's"" and dated that it's hard on the eyes (Live in Athens is later 1980's)--corny dancing, clothing, staging, choreography (the music is good though)--I usually turn the video off and just listen to it. Three Sides Live is the opposite--even though it's 1980's, watch it, enjoy it and turn it up!!! My only ""complaint"", if I were to have one (my mom always said nothing is perfect), is that I wish Phil played the drums during the entire movie instead of just being the front man. He is (was?) one hell of a drummer and it would be nice to have that immortalized in an early post-progressive Genesis concert.",1415145600,31,2782,4.661914460285132
