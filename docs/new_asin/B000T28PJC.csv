8207399,3,B000T28PJC,"Disasters used to take forever to understand.  At the time, people didn't understand what was causing the Black Death, for example.  However, there was a documentary that explained the Twin Towers' collapse relatively soon after it happened.  This work, similarly, explain the tragedy that befell New Orleans.  A shocker is that one interviewee said it would be too expensive to build levees to stop a Category 5 Hurricane, so that screamed to me that this tragedy could happen again.

This work has something for science-lovers and their opposites.  It shows computerized images to explain the geological phenomena that science-haters would block out.  It showed images of stranded New Orleans residents and corpses to remind viewers how shocking and important this event was.  When the work said the refuge, the New Orleans football dome, had leaks in it and the toilets stopped working, I was grossed out.  This work interviews many engineers and scientists and you can tell that they just loved being in front of a camera, rather than just doing experiments in their labs in private.

This documentary avoided a very sensitive question that one politician was chastised, back then for asking.  If New Orleans is under water and so unsafe and Mother Nature will knock down all levees, then maybe we need to abandon that city.  Don't get me wrong!:  I loved the place, both my sisters went to college there, I have relatives down there who may have lived in the 9th Ward.  Still, people left Western states for California after the Dust Bowl.  My ancestors and many others left Mississippi during the Great Migration because of the racism down there.  In the same way that Minneapolis and St. Paul co-exist, could above-land New Orleans exist next to a twin city that was safer and higher above sea level?  Maybe this is land not fit for long-term human residence.  Should we move on because this place is too unsafe for humankind?",1204761600,2,1933,4.91358024691358
