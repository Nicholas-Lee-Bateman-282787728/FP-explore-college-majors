8054374,5,B0007Z0NWS,"This is not a concert based collection. As one reviewer said, on the DVD, they show a static picture while playing the music, I skipped over that. I got to the interview, and wow ! Gerry Mulligan was quite the musician. In the interviews everybody commented how Gerry seemed to be able to insert his "" voice "" into every situation. Those of us who have listened to his musicalready know that. Just check out all of the CD's that have Gerry Mulligan meets .....,or .......encounters Gerry Mulligan. I think I own them all, this guy sounds like he was made to play with everybody. I especially liked the interviews with Dave Brubeck. Throughout the documentary you get to enjoy his performances with many of his collaborations. Side B on the DVD continues with the interviews. Ok, next is the Master Class. This is worth the price of admission by itself. Gerry gives his class on the history of jazz. who better to give this, than a musician who lived it. He comments about the changing shape of our society as it pertains to music. I found it dead on. He makes the very important distinction about musicians like himself, that worked with the creators of the music. That's what made the early jazz artists great, the working with and feeding off of great musicians that push you on to more evolved levels. He then takes questions from the audience that he answers with thoughtful insight. He then picks up his baritone and demonstrates two different approaches to two different tunes. Great!. This side contains the instructions to download the music from The Age Of Steam, for all the instruments. Wow!, what a treasure. Let's not forget, you also get the CD, The Age Of Steam. This is Pure Gold.",1401840000,,1696,4.656666666666666
8054375,4,B0007Z0NWS,The documentary was excellent. And the music CD is fine. But I expected that the music would be on the DVD. I wanted to see the band as well as hear it. I'm not sure whether this understanding was due to the product description or not.,1400112000,,235,4.130434782608695
8054376,5,B0007Z0NWS,"The DVD shows how diverse Gerry Mulligan's interest in music was.  You've got so see the ""Lecture""  he gives to music students... watch his expression as he listens to Benny Moten's band with the class - hear his insight expressed in words, and then listen to him matching his words with his performances.  The documentary is 90 minutes long and is my favorite, but the interviews; the music on the DVD + the CD is all a great package deal.  The man even sings a couple of songs... actually three, come to think of it.  And he reveals a bit of his humor in his last one on the documentary.  Buy it.  You'll be glad your did!  I've had this for about a month, and it still brings tears (of joy) to my eyes.",1389052800,,705,4.208955223880597
8054377,5,B0007Z0NWS,"This was always my favorite Gerry Mulligan album, and when I tried to find it recently, I found that it was long out of print in CD and unavailable for download.  However, this DVD, which is also great, contains the CD as a ""bonus"", so it's a great bargain.  Mulligan was a master soloist, composer and arranger, and this album has some great charts for the kind of ""little big band"" sized ensemble that he liked to write for (re: Birth of the Cool).  K-4 Pacific is one of my all time favorite tunes, and this is the definitive arrangement and performance.  Golden Notebooks is a fun tune to play, and again, this is the definitive arrangement.  A desert island pick, especially for Mulligan fans!",1359763200,,698,4.552
8054378,5,B0007Z0NWS,Have a vinyl copy but the interviews make this purchase an outstanding buy. I recommend it highly to jazz fans.,1358899200,,111,4.6
8054379,5,B0007Z0NWS,"I have many Gerry Mulligan CDs but never miss an oppurtunity to add to the collection.
There are some unusual instrument line ups but the whole thing hangs together really well.
Such a mixture of styles, funk to a softer style of jazz.
The DVD is basically everything you wanted to know about Gerry his career and his insight into the music.
A collectors item.

8054380,5,B0007Z0NWS,"The audio CD that comes with this is terrific, a unique set of arrangements and a unique group in Mulligan's output -- excellent writing with edgy voicings, excellent soloing, tight ensemble work. What's not to like? (Mulligan's deep musicality (as writer as well as soloist) is too often overlooked.) Here, you get the history of jazz up to 1971 without the lecture.  Brookmeyer is as intelligent here as ever, Jimmy Cleveland, and Kenny Shroyer (nice bass bone), Bud Shank, Tom Scott, Ernie Watts Roger Kellaway, Howard Roberts, Emil Richards, John Guerin, all tip-top; also Roger Bobo and Joe Porcaro. And Sweets gets a nice moment, too!

The accompanying DVD is unique -- it includes typical interviews with musicians on the CD, and an interesting master class given by Mulligan, but it also has a terrific resource for jazz aficionados and students: the DVD includes Mulligan's scores and parts, plus Mulligan's later Concert Jazz Band arrangements for some of the works on the CD, all printable! Students of jazz arranging and composition and jazz theory, ""take note""!",1278633600,9,1074,5.096590909090909
8054381,5,B0007Z0NWS,"The Library of Congress and Artists House have produced a genuine masterpiece. The documentary ""Listen"" alone is so well put together I've watched it 5 times all the way through and still am not tired of seeing it. Just watching Gerry learn One Note Samba direct from it's composer Antonio Carlos Jobim years before it was a hit song in his NY apartment is worth the price alone. Historic TV footage of Gerry soloing with Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins and Billie Holiday grinning and digging what he's playing is fantastic as well. This is a wonderful momento to Gerry and his significant impact on American Music in the 20th century. A Giant for all time indeed.",1115337600,12,663,4.724137931034483
