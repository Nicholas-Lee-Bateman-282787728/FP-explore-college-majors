8493430,2,B0038YX2AU,"as a exercise it is a nice project, however you need the web site from the author for additional information,
dvd is made  by a amateur in video registration
the quality of the pictures is poor
proper close ups are missing
it would be nice to have started with a summery of sizes of materials and tool used, you will find this on his website and by freezing the picture on the right moment
a lot of repetition is been shown
and other parts in the making are skipped or hartly touched on
it is irritating that the position from the camera is sloppy, and you end up looking at the back of his hands
the music is very irritating  but that is a personal thing.
I finished the ring only partly, I have bought also the Coronet Cluster DVD but have not started this one",1382227200,2,762,4.212328767123288
