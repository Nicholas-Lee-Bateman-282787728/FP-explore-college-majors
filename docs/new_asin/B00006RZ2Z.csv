Anyway, it is a great program -- the first time I've seen yoga and surfing combined, and it is beautiful! Taylor and Rochelle rip! I've already felt looser and stronger in my surfing and yoga with this program.

1791247,5,B00006RZ2Z,"""Yoga is accessible to anyone, regardless of age or physical condition. Yoga isn't just about flexibility - it's about awareness, about being fully alive in each moment."" -Peggy Hall

Top professional surfers swear by yoga and now see the infinite sea of possibilities in taking up yoga in addition to their favorite sport: surfing. They rely on the advice of instructors like Peggy Hall who writes articles for ""Surf Life for Women.""

In the Fall 2002 issue, she introduces some of the poses she has incorporated into her new workout video. She is an avid surfer and certified yoga instructor.

Peggy created the ""Yoga for Surfers"" video series and teaches yoga clinics and private classes. This is a unique workout because it is especially designed for surfers and their specific needs. Expert yoga instruction is interspersed with surf footage.

""Every surfer should discover Yoga."" -Rochelle Ballard (""Blue Crush"" stunt surfer)

""Yoga changed my surfing - and my life."" -Taylor Knox (a noted big-wave charger admired for his powerful, fluid surfing style)

The Setting: Filmed at Ballard and Knox's favorite surf breaks on the North Shore in  Carlsbad, California.

The Level: Beginner to Intermediate

The Poses: Classic yoga with a few very creative twists I hadn't seen before. Intriguing. I really loved the poses and the pace.

The Results: Injury prevention, increased strength, flexibility and focus. Helps you to avoid chronic pain and has specific moves that will sharpen your mental focus.

I loved the soundtrack, which is pleasant and calming.

Volume I has three sections:

Pre-Surf Session: Flexibility and Focus

You can use this routine to warm-up before surfing. It is an energizing routine that flows from one pose to the next and can be done at the beach. At home, a ""sticky"" yoga mat and a towel is recommended. This section of the workout will help you avoid injury, ease neck, shoulder, or back pain and sharpen your mental focus.

Water Session: Energy and Confidence

These are simple moves you can do while on a surfboard out in the water between sets. They can also be done at home while seated as most of the poses are for the upper body. It is fun to do the poses in your living room with the aid of the ""top of a step"" between
two chairs (so adventurous). There is a segment where you should really be sitting or on a surf board and it was not difficult to incorporate most of the poses into an at-home workout. If you live at the beach and can see your TV from the sand, then
you have it made.

Post-Surf Session: Stretching and Rejuvenation.

This is my favorite section. It is just so relaxing and you could do this section after a long
day because it helps to calm your mind and rejuvenate your body.

Yoga will also enhance other areas of your life and make you feel more in control of your inner world. This video has been very well received in surfing and yoga circles.

Highly Recommended because this workout not only gives you a great workout, it will help you to find a deep sense of well-being and increase your energy level.

A workout lifestyle to give you the flexibility to surf better, longer.

Also look for Volume II: Fluid Power Yoga for Surfers which is a 40-minute routine to strengthen and stretch all your surfing muscles while improving stamina, balance and mental focus.

1791280,5,B00006RZ2Z,"I am in my early 40's and for one reason or another ,I find myself doing things now that I wish I started in my teens or 20's. However since this is not the case and i am learning everything from Paddle board,skimboard (SW Florida is low on waves,Beater 54 is so versatile you can skim,bodyboard and surf),body board (to learn about waves and catching them),surfing and all that is precursor to Kite surfing. I have water and snow skiid all my life,but the above board sports use different techniques to turn etc. which I have not learned thus no muscle memory.
I realized at my age the biggest thing that will injure me is lack of mobility and agility,thus I knew the only answer to help keep me centered and less injury prone is yoga. I bought my DVD through Peggys web page. Yes its a bit more pricey,but once on her e mail list,she sends free tips and updates on a weekly if not bi weekly basis and she is there for you to answer any questions etc. Love this DVD,because I hate classes and having to stop my day just to run over to some place and stretch etc. The DVD I use the warm up in AM,have not used any of the excersises out on my boad except if I,m alone somewhere w/my paddleboard,great for doing yoga on even floating with it in the water.
I use the am for a warm up and after surf for the obvious, I do the cool down,lasts about 15-20 minutes. Never felt better (only been using it for 2 months),feel more graceful,coordinated and peaceful.
Thank you peggy for a product that is enjoyable to watch,listen to and follow.
Best yoga DVD for the money...and will be getting #2,after I master all the posses comfortably.
Buy this product if at all interested in yoga,especially if you do surf or do any other water sports.",1287273600,,1732,4.348765432098766
1791281,5,B00006RZ2Z,"Ok, I must admit, before I tried this DVD, I was REALLY skeptical if things like Yoga would ever help improving surf.  I also thought that this may be another hype.  I could not believe why so many ppl rave about the DVD either.  I understand that many experienced would absolutely disagree with overall production but this DVD helped me practicing Yoga at least, but most of all, it really is helping my surf, too.  I'm still a beginner/baby-surfer myself and for the last few months before I purchased this DVD, I felt like my surf was not improving at all, rather, that was completely opposite.  I am not a kind of person who practice Yoga to begin with, I always thought Yoga was way too mellow for my lifestyle and therefore, not my kind of thing.  I came across with this DVD, read few reviews and thought I should give it a try.  Even if it didn't work for improving my surf, at least I could start something that may(or may not) work for relaxing & calming myself down.  I really needed it anyways.  First few tries were horrible...I could not maintain those postures or hold the certain pose at all but I guess that means I was either not fit enough or certain muscle groups did need more strength.  Been using this DVD for almost 4 months now and I really wanna point out that I started seeing improvements.  I certainly can catch more waves now than before, not much muscle soreness after session, also, I learned how to relax & calm down which I can certainly benefit in any occasion whether in or out from water.  Overall great DVD.  I am ordering the vol 2 now!",1268611200,,1575,4.408304498269896
1791282,5,B00006RZ2Z,"The scenery is so enjoyable and the music is fantastic.  Peggy shows us that we all can do yoga, regardless of fitness level. The exercises are great even if you don't surf as we all need to be flexible.

1791283,1,B00006RZ2Z,"I purchased this as a video, and was not that impressed. It has nice surf footage, but the yoga instruction is really bad. The time would have been better spent slowing going through each yoga pose, versus racing through a large number of poses. Skip this DVD, take a lesson at your local yoga place.",1241913600,2,300,4.472727272727273
1791284,1,B00006RZ2Z,"This video is not good. Peggy seems like a regular soccer mom who decided that she could make a yoga video. Her instructions aren't good and her form is not good enough to be teaching others. The editing is pretty bad. And worst of all theres awesome surfing clips on when your head is bent over in your lap. How are you supposed to watch the sweet barrels?

Maybe the other two Yoga for Surfers are better but I'm over it.",1209600000,3,423,4.222222222222222
1791285,2,B00006RZ2Z,"This is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type.  If you have a basic knowledge of yoga, you don't need this at all - you can create and tailor your own workout.  If you don't know yoga, it's  useless.  The instruction is poor, peppered with a split screen of people surfing and practicing yoga (no wonder the surf mags think it's great!) with little, very poorly demonstrated techniques of basic yoga.  In some scenes you can't even see their feet (a crucial failure) - even if the ""instructor"" says what to do.  Save your money, take yoga long enough to learn it properly, then apply it to your own surfing.  Yoga is great for surfing, but this is a poor video.",1202169600,,677,4.368
1791286,3,B00006RZ2Z,"So I don't have to type the content here. I also agree with someone's comments that there are a lot of 5 star review for 3/21 that are obviously shrills/fakes.
It does have a nice feel, but there isn't enough teaching to make sure you do the poses correctly to avoid injury. She does well with the general basics, sometimes telling you when to inhale/exhale & she's VERY good about telling you the benefits of the poses for surfing or for stretching/strengthening those muscles, but no reminders on how not to do it, such as a sitting spinal twist the twist comes form the waist, don't force it from the upper chest or neck. I have been doing it for 5 years so I was ok, but she did a great shoulder stretch that felt good, but then I got lost how she did it & had to rewind. Also, during poses she was demonstrating, it would cut to the people surfing or even just a seagull flying over a beach. I know it's for surfers, but they can't go 20 min w/o seeing water? There are also several minute long interviews at each chapter, so you will have to fast fwd through that every time. At first I enjoyed the quick pace of the pre-surf session, thinking it would be great when I have little time, but it started to make me feel rushed because it's only held for 2 moderate speed breaths yet it's not meant to be power yoga.

It has really helped me to recover much faster after a session, as well as, and improve my time in the water.

1791288,5,B00006RZ2Z,"This is a great DVD, especially for someone who never did yoga before.

1791289,2,B00006RZ2Z,"This is a generic, cheesy yoga video with plenty of 'namaste' B.S. to go around. The poses are fine and good, but the video doesn't really offer up any yoga that is different and specific to surfing. Maybe that's because yoga in general is just good for surfing, I don't know ... but I was expecting more.

1791320,5,B00006RZ2Z,"I'm actually her husband reviewing this.

I think I have bought about 4 copies of Vol. I since this came out.  I keep giving them away.  I have been recommending this to friends, neighbors, strangers, and anyone else who will listen.  This is the best thing that has happened to my back.

I have injured my back over the years of surfing, skateboarding, other sports and aggravated by bad posture and computers.  I have been to massage therapy, physical therapy, chiroprators, accupunturists, medical doctors - I was headed for surgery.  My wife finally dragged me to yoga classes and after 6 - 90 minute sessions in 2 weeks, my back started to noticeably improve.  I have a pinched nerve in my upper back that causes  discomfort/pain near my right shoulder blade.

Then I heard about this not too long afterwards and bought the DVD.  This was when it first came out.  The 10 minute warm up and the 20 minute post sessions were exactly what I needed.  It was quick, it focused on the back and shoulder - surfer problem areas.  They are easy to do and do not take up much time.  I would (and do all the time) highly recommend this to anyone having any back problems.  Try this before you try surgery, drugs, accupuncture, etc.  Now as long as I do these 30 minute sessions 2-3 times a week, I am pain free!  Thank you Peggy Hall!",1177632000,5,1328,4.4625
1791321,4,B00006RZ2Z,"I'm not a surfer, but I do practice yoga regularly.  I had heard that Yoga for Surfers 1 was excellent for stretching the upper body, an area where I tend to be quite tight, so I decided to try this DVD.  Led by surfer/yoga instructor Peggy Hall, the practice portion of this DVD is broken down into 3 segments:  a Pre-Surf Session, intended to prepare your body for surfing/other activity; a Water Session containing stretches to do on your surfboard (can also be performed out of the water without a board); and a Post-Surf session providing stretching and relaxation.  I have broken down each of these three sessions into greater detail below.

Pre-Surf Session: Flexibility and Focus, 9 minutes.

This was a nice warm-up session, although I found that it moved a bit too quickly for my preference.  After a few standing side stretches, Peggy leads you through a series of standing poses performed entirely on one side before moving to the other.  Peggy does not give names of all postures, but they included wide-legged standing forward bend, lunge, twisting lunge, pyramid, warrior 1, triangle, and side angle.  Peggy then transitions to the floor via squat and crow pose (a rather advanced arm balance for this otherwise beginning-level practice); final poses include a seated twist and a triceps stretch.

Water Session: Energy and Confidence, 4 minutes.

This session, which is interspersed with surfer interviews, consists mainly of upper body stretches which you can perform seated on your surfboard in the water (or in a chair if you are on land).  There are a few full-body stretches as well, such as down dog using the board.

Post-Surf Session: Stretching and Rejuvenation, 20 minutes.

This sessions provided a very nice series of stretches performed entirely on the floor.  Starting in child's pose, Peggy moves to hands and knees for a side stretch and a cat/cow series.  A squat/toe stretch sequence comes next, and then you remain seated on your heels for eagle arms and a chest expansion.  Next comes an enjoyable series of side stretches.  As with the standing poses, these are performed all on one side before moving to the other, and they include mermaid (a Pilates move), chest expansion/contraction, a unique seated twist, pigeon pose (adding a quad stretch), half spinal twist, easy seated forward bend, 1-legged seated forward bend, and then spinal rolls before repeating on the other side.  This segment finishes with table, reclined twist, reclined cobblers, and relaxation pose (savasana).

Overall, I enjoyed the gentle stretching offered by this yoga practice.  Although with a few exceptions, most of the poses were quite accessible for someone new to yoga, Peggy doesn't offer much in the way of form pointers, so some prior exposure to yoga principles might be beneficial.  Those who are more experienced in yoga and looking for a more intense practice will not find it here.  I think this DVD (which also includes bonus material such as interviews with surfers) is probably best-suited for those with the goal of obtaining flexibility and relaxation through a basic, easy-to-follow yoga practice.",1161734400,4,3132,5.0623781676413255
1791322,3,B00006RZ2Z,"I enjoy both the pace and the variety here.  The pre surf and after surf sequences are very effective and arranged well.  A great way to stay relaxed and focused in and out of the water.  After about 3 weeks I began to notice increased flexablity and upper body strength and I've noticed measured improvement that I can 'surf better, longer'.  So why just 3 stars?  The downside for me is the narrative/interview part kind of chops it up a bit making the pre surf warm up seem a little like an infomercial and taking away from what could/should be instruction for beginners technique-wise. Even when the camera is focused on the instructor it's often only waist up.  I enthusiastically recommend this dvd but ONLy if you already have several dozen yoga classes under your belt.",1142380800,3,777,4.676470588235294
1791323,5,B00006RZ2Z,"Like a lot of surfers, I half heartedly strectch and warm up before I paddle out, and I almost never stretch or cool down after a long surf session.  Partly due to laziness, partly because I get impatient when it's ""going off"" and I just wanna get wet, and partly because I've always thought I was a naturally limber dude.  Well, after trying this dvd out at a friend's house before a session it really made me realize how stiff I actually am and how much more limber and energized I could actually be.  This dvd is a great introduction into Yoga, especially if you're a surfer.  It's a great way to warm up, get limber and energize your body before a dawn patrol sesh, or anytime really.  In this dvd Peggy Hall focuses on basic warm up stretches and poses but for the uninitiated they can prove to be awkard and slightly difficult at first.  She breaks it down by giving you a pre-surf warm up, an in the water stretch out (perfect to do while waiting for sets), and a post-surf cool down.  Each session is only about 15 or so minutes so it doesn't take much time but it leaves you feeling super loose and full of energy.  I immediately purchased Volume II after doing Volume I a few times because I was hungry for more.  Volume II is a bit more advanced and concentrates on flowing poses together (vinyasa flow) and increasing strength, balance, and lung capacity.  If you want to feel loose, flexible, and energized then Peggy's DVDs are for you!!",1140566400,2,1451,4.421052631578948
1791324,5,B00006RZ2Z,"first, let me say that i am not a surfer, but i really love to watch surfing and the footage here is wonderful. this is a great yoga practice tape. there are two short practice segments,  perfect when i don't have a whole hour to devote to yoga. the instructor is wonderful. so many yoga practice tapes have someone talking you through who sounds like they'd rather be doing something else.

you can tell that peggy hall genuinely enjoys surfing and yoga. that makes a big difference when i am tired and cranky and want to do a yoga practice that makes me feel great. the music is nice and not too distracting. all around, a great yoga tape.",1125964800,3,641,4.378151260504202
1791325,5,B00006RZ2Z,"I love this video -- everything about it is so true. Even though I've practiced yoga for some time, I learned a lot from this program, especially from the post-surf session which has unique and effective rejuvenating poses. The music is enchanting and adds to the uplifting nature of the program. And the quality of this video is the best I have ever seen - gorgeous surf and beach scenes and top-notch editing between the poses. I recommend this video to everyone!",1106784000,2,465,4.682926829268292
1791326,2,B00006RZ2Z,"As far as yoga instructional DVDs go, this is not one I would recommend.  Particularly if you are not familar with yoga already.  The poses are not explained as well as in most not-for-surfers DVDs.  Often times, you can not see the feet of the instructor, so you do not know how to place your feet unless you already know the pose.  I think Peggy is probably a good instuctor, but this DVD isn't a good example.  The best part of this DVD is the advert for Rochelle's surf camp, which includes a cameo appearance of Minnie Driver.  I found this portion of the DVD to be inspiring.  If you are looking for some instruction on yoga poses, this is not a good choice.",1104710400,7,664,4.306451612903226

The relaxation part really is fantastic and helps me stay focused to reach my goal of being a surfer again. My only complaint is that its slightly talk-ey for me. I could do with less talking. Overall though, it has lovely music, Peggy Hall is a great teacher, and its very relaxing.  I would say its a great purchase for any level.",1085616000,5,606,4.45945945945946

The practice is broken into 3 segments: Pre-surf Session of flexibility and focus, Water Session Energy and Confidence, and Post-Surf Session Stretching and Rejuvenation. You can do each session separate for a short session or together for a longer session. You can even do the water session and pretend you're on your board!
I'm not a board surfer, but I love the ocean and the surf. This is a beautiful, well made DVD. I practice yoga everyday and I love mixing this practice into my week. I have the ""Special Edition"" and I think this means the music quality is a lot better.

Any surfer who takes the time to practice yoga will benefit.  Peggy's videos lack the vital instruction that beginners need to do poses properly without injury.  It is a real shame as she has so many famous surfers supporting her efforts to spread yoga in the surf community.  A better option is Shiva Rhea's Shakti yoga which provides excellent instruction AND a ""yoga matrix"" which allows you to create your own unique routines.  Most DVDs become stale after awhile, but the yoga matrix on Shiva Rhea's dvd (in addition to the 4 ready-made routines), prevent this DVD from ever getting old.",1314316800,,717,4.741935483870968

7972895,5,B00006RZ2Z,Volume 1 is a great DVD but it is more stretching than a workout. Get Volume 2 if you want a solid workout. Volume 1 has a solid relaxation/meditation yoga routine at the end of the DVD that is about 15 minutes long. Perfect Yoga DVD for beginners.,1292284800,,248,4.1875
7972896,5,B00006RZ2Z,"The pre-surfing routine makes the DVD worth it. Great scenes of waves and not too heavy handed with the ""breath in the harmony of the universe"" incantations, which are so common in yoga DVDs. Yes, she says a couple here and there, but the surfing angle makes it great.

Anyway, the routine is perfect to do each morning. 10mins!  My surfing has improved and my golf game too. It also lead me into doing the moves here and there throughout the day, which is great.

One can always learn and add in the Sun Salutation, easily learned on youtube for free. And that adds as much time and strenghtening as you desire to your yoga workout.

I have hesitated for years to wait until I found the ""perfect"" group yoga class to attend. But I was never motivated enough to go for an hour long class, with the obligatory 15 minute drive each way. 1.5hrs down the drain.

I do this routine anywhere in the house, with the disc on my laptop. Also, you can burn a copy of your own DVD and use it on your iPad if you have one, which is very convenient.

I've since gotten the yoga for surfers 2 and 3, but this one is the best for my purposes- 10 mins, more flexible. Done.",1288915200,,1157,4.236363636363636
