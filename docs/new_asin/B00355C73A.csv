The concert was held to celebrate Ginger's 70 year birthday- quite a miraculous event considering his life style - and cast a stellar band with Chris Goss (Masters Of Reality)and bass virtuoso Jonas Hellborg. The repertoire is kind of a historic trip through G.B.'s illustrious career. Be-bop with Thelonious Monk and ""Bemsha Swing"" featuring a brilliant Hellborg solo. Cream: a rather short run through of ""Sweet Wine"" with some less than stellar vocals from Goss and Baker's daughter Leda, ""Iko Beiya"" from Airforce.

The playing is rather tight for an ad hoc band and it's a great pleasure to hear Jonas H. play some straight rock and blues.

Unfortunately we only get around 45 min. of music and a big shame that the proceedings stop - for contractual reasons - when Steve Winwood enters the scene!",1297987200,2,922,4.929032258064516
