5973721,4,B00FAPPQ54,"Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends is a long running and much beloved children's show based on stories dating back almost 70 years, but it has spent that past several years in the doldrums. While it used to boast colorful dialogue with rich (for a children's show) vocabulary, beautiful background scenery, splendid music and creative stories that gently massaged their morals into young minds rather than beating kids over the heads with simplistic moralizing messages; for several seasons it had become dramatically dumbed down, more repetitive and frankly tedious. While a parent or slightly older child could probably watch some of the older episodes with the young ones and be kept fairly amused by its humor or colorful expressions, many of the DVDs released lately would be difficult for anyone over 2 or 3 years old to sit through. Gratefully for anyone who grew up with this series and might want to introduce it to their own children, this latest season seems to break that trend and return some of its original charm.

The latest episodes, narrated by Mark Moraghan, at last seem to demonstrate an interest amongst the show's producers in recapturing some of the old charm and injecting a bit of imagination back into the writing. The storylines are more creative & original and the atmosphere of a busy, working railway sort of shines through: something that is good for getting the young ones interested in its real life equivalent. It also seems like more are is being done to portray the characters true to original form rather than as interchangeable vehicles (pun unintended) for moving along an uninspired plot.

Having grown up with the earliest seasons during my own childhood, I will always have a personal soft spot for them, but if your son or daughter is kept more engaged by the CGI version of the series with the separate voice actors for the different characters then this is definitely the best of that lot so far. It will probably have more lasting power with the kids and won't be as boring to watch as the others.",1388707200,5,2042,4.831428571428572

8613872,2,B00FAPPQ54,"(Wife): Now, I will be honest and say that I did not stay and watch the whole thing with my daughter -- nor did I let my daughter watch the whole video. We watched the first story and some of the second, before I started getting ready for the day. I went back into the living room and found the second story suggestive of values that I don't support, and a third story when I popped in a third time that dealt with gossip, but in a way that might insinuate to some children that people are inclined to misinterpret situations.

The first story with Duck and Thomas was all right. I was bothered by the whole ""useful engine"" designation, because the implication in the videos is that people are happiest and of greatest benefit to society when they work hard and fulfill the role society imposes on them, rather than allow individuals to be themselves and make their own choices in life.

The stories we watched in this video seemed suggestive of submitting to authoritarian leadership (first story, with Duck and Thomas); supporting complementarianism / assuming traditional gender roles (second story, with Luke and Millie, I think); and not speaking up when you are concerned that something might be amiss (a later story). Granted, that later story was a matter of a lack of fact-checking; however, the underlying message can lay the groundwork for abusive churches / institutions and abusive families teaching children that dissident members are by nature troublemakers relying on hearsay, when they may have been eyewitnesses to abuse and working to right the wrongs they witnessed.

So, here's what I would say: for Christian families, I am generally a ""VeggieTales"" fan and in most cases -- not all, but most cases -- I would be more inclined to recommend ""VeggieTales"" over this video. I find that many ""VeggieTales"" do a decent job promoting Christian values.

For a general / non-Christian audience, I recommend the following shows for young kids, instead of Thomas and Friends:

Nickelodeon's ""Dora the Explorer"": This is an engaging show for toddlers that teaches concepts in English and sometimes in Spanish as well as map literacy. While the main character is a Latina girl, her best friend is a male monkey. So, there is some balance with the sexes. Dora's cousin Diego also sometimes shows up in the series.

Amazon's ""Tumble Leaf"": It's a cute series and reasonably well-done, imo. The emphasis is on exploration and problem-solving. The show also promotes the sexes working together, as one of the main characters is a male fox, and the other, a female bear (I think). The episodes are not very long, but they do keep our daughter engaged while she watches them.

PBS Kids' ""Dinosaur Train"": I don't care for this one much myself, although they do teach actual concepts from Paleontology. Also relatively short episodes.

""Caillou"": This is a great series that promotes fairness, kindness, creativity and developing a child's imagination. The protagonist is a young boy named Caillou (literally, ""pebble"" in French), who (presumably) lives in Canada and attends daycare. While he is Caucasian, there is diversity among his friends at daycare. This series can expose young children to several concepts, and kids who go to daycare -- especially ones who live in areas that get snowy winters and four seasons -- can probably relate pretty well to Caillou and his family.

""Bob the Builder"": While the show sometimes promotes envrionmental concepts, it also promotes values like honesty, kindness and gender equality. And of course, you have talking machines, sort-of an earlier variant of the Disney / Pixar Cars / Planes with construction heavy machinery.

I haven't seen Nickelodeon's ""Backyardigans"" yet, but that might be another choice.

These are shows I would recommend for younger children. You do have more options as kids get older.

Also, for movies:

Christian: The two VeggieTales movies -- ""Jonah"" and ""The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything"" are both decent. I personally prefer the ""Pirates"" one, which I don't recall having a very strong Christian overtone, but still served as an encouragement, with regards to folks having unique strengths and gifts.

Non-sectarian: Our three-year-old daughter loves Disney / Pixar ""Cars"" and ""Planes"". I do NOT recommend Cars 2 for younger children, because it should be rated PG-13, due to the use of gun violence and a torture scene. ""Planes Fire and Rescue"" is also for slightly older kids than a toddler, although I thought it was well-done. With regards to ""Planes Fire and Rescue"", it is (I believe) correctly rated PG, due to the forest fire scenes.

Ok, so hopefully that can give you several alternate options for stuff your kid can watch while you need to be out of the room. = )",1487635200,2,4752,4.952261306532663

I do not recommended for older kids since the speed of the dialogue is a bit slow, and I've come to notice that many kids begin to talk that way in their daily life.",1486771200,,329,4.190476190476191
