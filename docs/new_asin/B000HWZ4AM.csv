2643808,5,B000HWZ4AM,This program covers some of the best of the NBA in a way that highlights most of the great stars. I also enjoyed the very brief backstory per star player.,1402099200,,154,4.166666666666667
2643809,1,B000HWZ4AM,I DONT AGREE WITH THE #1 CHOICE.  AND THEY ONLY SHOW THE TOP 10 PLAYS--THEY DONT EVEN SHOW THE OTHERS.  THEY ARE JUST LISTED.  IN 75 MINUTES ONLY 10 PLAYS?  LAME.,1352073600,2,162,4.129032258064516
2643810,5,B000HWZ4AM,"I got tired of trying to tell my 13 year old about the old school players like Wilt Chamberlain, and had to find something visual for hiom to see their moves and understand the history of the NBA. This is it. Magic Johnson, Bird, they are all here with highlights of some of the greatest moments in the game. I recommend to all dads.",1258329600,,333,4.21875
2643811,4,B000HWZ4AM,"While this was a solid overview of NBA history, you should be advised that this is what it is, NBA 101. From the title, I was expecting more along the lines of great plays and clutch shots than how the league was formed and a sequential decade-by-decade saga. There are quite alot of great plays and unforgettable moments, but not nearly what was expected based on the title. While they were trying to be historical, though, I thought some notable oversights among players were Connie Hawkins, Dave Bing, and Bernard King. They mentioned Earl 'The Pearl' Monroe but did not show a clip of this amazing player. There also was no coverage of the All Star game or the Dream Team of 1992. Mention of some of the great announcers might also have been nice. On the plus side, the segments on the Celtics, on the Magic-Bird era, and the Rise and Rise of Air Jordan were well done. And there are a lot of great extra features, the best being an in-depth history of Game 5 of the 1976 finals between the Celtics and the Suns. The DVD brought back a lot of great memories and served as a solid introduction to basketball history for my son, but still was not the highlight-reel fest suggested by the title. I'd call it a nice lay-up but no slam dunk!!!",1217203200,6,1242,4.427947598253275
2643812,3,B000HWZ4AM,"Not a bad overview of the history of the NBA, and it's greatest moments.
The documentary takes you from the introduction of the shot clock, through George Mikan's days as the first big man, past Wilt's 100 point game and up to recent times.
However, most of the greatest moments are playoff related, so if you already own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Greatest-NBA-Finals-Moments/dp/B00004Y545/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Greatest NBA Finals Moments</a>, you might want to consider this purchase.",1191628800,6,540,6.619718309859155
2643813,5,B000HWZ4AM,"This is a first-class, decade-by-decade review of the NBA's championship teams, with excellent pacing, great clips, and a judicious mix of interviews, both current and contemporanous.  The video builds in a sense of dramatic tension as well.  It's not really about ""moments"" (I was thinking about specific shots or moves) - rather, it's about championship teams and rivalries.  You get a sense for the sweep of NBA history - the players and coaches and great teams - in a very tightly produced DVD.

I got this for my basketball-crazy 14-year-old, but the whole family was immediately engrossed in it.  A very high-quality production - strongly recommended.",1182816000,7,657,5.160377358490566
2643814,3,B000HWZ4AM,"I love the NBA, I love watching great moments, however the majority of these presentation is in the old days.  The Celtics of old who won 11 titles were great, but I thought there would be a balanced amount of modern champs too.  Still good dvd to add to your collection, but not the greatest as the title would suggest.",1180396800,5,320,4.316666666666666
2643815,5,B000HWZ4AM,"I bought this DVD for my son, 14, who absolutely LOVES it!!!!!!  He watches it nonstop and can just about give you EVERY detail about all the great moments and championships in NBA history.  He has acquired knowledge of the marvelous basketball greats of the past. If you love basketball, you'll love this DVD.  5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1178582400,6,337,4.982142857142857

2643894,4,B000HWZ4AM,This was a very good documentary for my 12 year old son to watch.  He has become a pretty big basketball fan and this documentary gave him the opportunity to put faces to the names he has been hearing about.  It provided some good insight into the great players a bit about the history of the game and rivalries.  We both enjoyed watching it together. It brought back a lot of good memories from when I was a kid.  Nicely done!,1449014400,,427,4.234567901234568
