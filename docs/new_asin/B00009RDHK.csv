1888871,4,B00009RDHK,"This compilation is perfect for those of us who grew up when having what would now be considered eclectic taste was the norm. Back when FM radio was not programmed after 9 pm. When everyone record collection revealed their broad taste and exposure to many styles.
  The songs that were selected do not always show the performers at their absolute best. I'm sure their was probably a better Roxy Music track than ""The Strand,"" and Rory Gallagher, although brilliant as always, performed more than once on OGWT, and a better selection could have been made from a later performance. I would love to see complete performances released on DVD. Overall, the song selection is quite good. I do wish there was a way to skip the introductory comments that start many of the programs. Some of these are tedious to listen to.
  Bear in mind that these recordings were made with basic gear during another era. Sometimes the mix is excellent, other times it leaves a lot to be desired.
  The performances are generally outstanding. Highlights for me include: Curtis Mayfield, Rory, The Wailers (with Bob Marley and Peter Tosh!), Roxy Music, Edgar Winter's full length rendition of ""Frankenstein,"" John Lennon, and the Ramones. The weakest performances are by XTC (who are given a lot of hype in their introduction, but sound dated and trite), and the Damned (who start off ok, but then sort of fizzle out, ending with an already cliche even back then knocking over of the drums. Let's put it this way: If you are intrigued by the names of the artists who appear on the disc and like them in general, you may be disappointed in a performance here and there, but you will love this DVD overall.
  I've not watched the bonus footage yet, so I won't comment on that. This is a fun DVD that can easily bear repeated listening. One feature is that you can set it to play the tracks randomly.
I'd recommend this DVD to all fans of 70's to early 80's rock.
I only wish that the Clash had appeared on the OGWT so that, together with the Ramones, they could show viewers how other acts of the era paled in comparison.",1064361600,7,2094,4.595174262734584

1888873,1,B00009RDHK,"This is the ""Americanized"" single DVD release of the great UK 2-Disc Set of OGWT classic performances. I'm not surprised, but for some reason they have decided to ditch incredible performances from artists like The New York Dolls, Meatloaf , Public Image, Gary Numan & Alex Harvey as well as some interesting oddities like Focus, Japan, Robert Wyatt, Teardrop Explodes & Tim Buckley. They have however chosen to include Randy Newman & Bonnie Raitt. Go Figure. Do yourself a favor & seek out the REGION ZERO release of the UK version & enjoy the entire spectrum of great music that it offers. Did I mention Randy Newman....?",1063497600,6,623,4.831775700934579
1888874,3,B00009RDHK,"The original release involved 2 wonderful, fully packed DVDs, with everthing that is on this USA version, and a lot more excellent stuff besides.  The American version contains brilliant stuff, absolutely no doubt, and deserves 5 stars in terms of content.  But if your computer or DVD player set up can play DVDs from any region, pay around the same price for the UK version on amazon.co.uk, and get almost twice the musical value!!  But if you don't have the capacity to do this, don't buy the UK version - as you'll not be able to play it...

1888895,3,B00009RDHK,"I love the content, but when played in my laptop it freezes up sometimes and the disc just spins in the drive. That hasn't happened in my DVD player. Listening closely I can hear fluctuations in the audio quality - phasing from bass to treble and back, on some selections.

The menu also lacks a song selection feature, you either have to play them in order or use 'random play'. I knew this when I bought it though and it isn't a big issue for me. The array of artists in their prime and the songs featured are fantastic.",1357516800,,522,4.2727272727272725
1888896,5,B00009RDHK,"This dvd is one of the finest collections of live classic rock performances from the 70's. It contains masterpieces from  an innocent Elton John playing solo Tiny Dancer, a crazy version of Frankenstein with Edgar Winter jumping from instrument to instrument, Bob Marley with the Wailers at their best, original Lynyrd Skynyrd rocking out on Freebird like never before. I have over 200 live classic rock dvd's and every time I watch this I am blown away. A must have for any one who appreciates these type of bands in a live forum.",1252368000,,531,4.709677419354839
1888897,5,B00009RDHK,WOW! GREATEST VERSION I EVER SAW OF FREE BIRD....THEY WENT OFF ON IT THAT NIGHT IN 1975! WORTH THE PRICE FOR FREE BIRD ALONE!,1247788800,,125,4.25
1888898,4,B00009RDHK,"I jotted down some impressions whilst I watched this and the program begins with Under My Wheels by the REAL Alice Cooper-prior to his ""oh that's right-I must go SOLO!"" brainstorm. The Alice Cooper group all glammed out to the hilt with AC sporting maximum attitude. great song/great clip.
Followed by the REAL Elton John, prior to the emergence of his ""tiara's and tantrums"" persona. But this clip is a wonder to behold with a camera tight up in EJ's face as he reels off a perfect Tiny Dancer accompanying himself on piano, no band. Watching him sing, watching his face expressively search through each word and listening to his talented fingers play the keys is like, the good ol' days.
Next up-Curtis Mayfield singing a song about 'we gotta have peace', something you wouldn't catch a black man singing,um,I mean rapping about today. His band in this clip are excellent. You could just focus in on the bass player alone and be thoroughly entertained but they're all top.
It's with this 3rd clip that it hit me the deep rich color all of these clips come with. The quality of the film footage here is superb.
A nice Randy Newman clip. The man has a interesting way of singing.
Also am starting to notice about how the Whistle Test alumni announcers who set up each clip are quite good describing what we're about to see. Not at all like those boring talking heads in the 'under review' series.
Bill Withers:I don't even LIKE this song but this clip is excellent with Bill and co.,capturing a very smooth groove. excellent clip.
Rory Gallagher seems pretty much George Thoroughgood, musically. All I really liked was his shirt.
The Wailers:same thing as Withers-I can't stand reaggae but I couldn't help being impressed with the musicianship and vocals on this.
Roxy Music...kind-a like vaudeville. For acquired tastes only.
Edgar Winter's number I couldn't wait to end.
Captain Beefheart with a song not at all like something from Trout Mask. Great yellow/brown dot shirt. Great expressive vocal.
Little Feat, despite the gushing intro, I didn't care for.
Back to the top again with the John Lennon clip. There's everything else.........and then there's Stand By Me sung by J.L. A man at complete control.
Lynerd Skinard-interminable.
Emmylou was like a breath of fresh air after that. With James Burton on guitar.
B.Raitt,good. Again noticing the deep color on all these clips.
Tom Waits:the most ridiculous voice in music. No compliment intended.
And I think he's puttin it on as well which is even worse.
""Punk threw out a lot of babies with the bathwater"" and thusly are Talking Heads introduced. This clip vies for best clip on this whole collection. Outstanding finale.
XTC-excellent.
Brit darlings Blondie and I notice not a lot of vocal range by Ms. Harry.
Petty-ok.
Police-once again...I don't even LIKE the Police but I thought this clip was very good.
Bruce Springstein-easily puts out more energy than all of these performers put together with the one of a kind Rosaletta. There is an adoring female invasion taking place and the man is girl/gang mauled at the conclusion.
I'm noticing too the generous amount of clips provided on this disc. No skimping here!
Iggy Pop by contrast with Bruce is really just as high-energy but in this short clip doesn't really get to unwind it to full extent as you know is what would happen if we were able to watch his whole set. This one clip just touches on that Iggy-energy.
The Specials-more deadly reaggae. Enjoyed the bass player and organ guy jumping around though.
The Damned-nice drum kit demolition in the end.
Ramones-the long spider legs of Johnny...the perfected slouch of Dee Dee and Joey duplicating all of the multi-layered vocals for this song all by himself. Fearless.
U2-Anne Nightingale introduces them snickering ""just look at those hairstyles!"" Well, I'll take those hairstyles ANY day over The Edge's hermetically sealed skull cap and the rest's short jobs they've given themselves these days.
Ending with REM who begin their nugget Pretty Persuasion by first soft-accapelling to Moon River-I respect them for that. Oh, and, ....this is the REAL REM.
It was getting late and I had to return this disc to the rental store(yes we still have one 'round here) so I didn't have time to watch the bonus interviews except for the one I did squeeze in and I'm so glad I did. This is the BEST interview of John Lennon I've ever seen. Interviewer Bob Harris is smiling ear to ear after a while, just delighted with his subject as I was. I'm listening to John talk and I swear, it's like he's not even gone.
Final summation:a really excellent dvd with a LOT of great clips, great introductions and deep rich color throughout.",1232496000,2,4687,4.823602484472049
1888899,5,B00009RDHK,"This double DVD of the BBC's music show from the early 70's to the 80's is a fabulous compilation of the best stuff from the show. Of course you are unlikely to like everything on here as we have the full spectrum of 70's and 80's music. So theres Captain Beefheart, The Ramones, John Martyn, Simply Red, Elton John, Focus and Val Doonican to name but seven of the range of artists over the two discs.

On the second volume of OGWT it emerges (at least on the UK version) that not everything was live on the show. Sometimes its really difficult to tell if the bands are miming or not if they are being professional about their job. However as a general rule artists who were effectively 'unplugged' were generally live, whereas bands that required a lot of gear were miming. However this is never mentioned on this first 2 DVD volume.

My favourites of the 2 DVD's are the late Curtis Mayfield performing ""We Gotta Have Peace"", Tim Buckleys amazing version of ""Dolphins"" and a rare chance to Randy Newman live performing ""Political Science"". The presenters are quite interesting to listen to. Mark Ellen tells one allegedly very funny true story about Captain Beefheart when he was a vacuum cleaner salesman.

All in all its a great package, but music being so subjective, you're not going to like it all, unless you have a really eclectic taste in 70's and 80's rock music.",1196208000,,1374,4.6
1888900,4,B00009RDHK,"I love the clips of some of the artists and the interviews(though some of them could've been a little bit longer),but do we really need the hosts introducing each clip? Also,there isn't any SCENE SELECTION to click on either!! The guy said that Elton was suppose to do 2 songs,but all we get is one?? I'm sure the other artists and groups did more than just one song,but why not have the whole performance instead??",1163462400,4,415,4.546666666666667

1888902,5,B00009RDHK,"If you grew up in the 1970's watching Don Kershner's Rock Concert late on Saturday Nights, this DVD IS FOR YOU!!! Don't let the title of this masterpiece scare you away because it is SOLID R&R!! Nothing but GEMS here. Elton John, John Lennon, Alice Cooper, Bill Withers, etc. It even crosses into the 1980's w/Talking Heads, Roxy Music, The Ramones, U2, etc. Great work of art!",1122422400,6,377,4.641791044776119
1888903,4,B00009RDHK,"this dvd is one of the best. although some are lip-sync jobs, such as Alice Cooper, Roxy Music and a few others are suspect.  Lynyrd Skynrd's never ending performance of Free Bird is somewhat lethargic. but the highlights outweigh the bad. these are Rory Gallagher, Captain Beefheart, Tom Waits, Bill Withers, Ramones (Joey has a double tracked vocal, hmmm), and Edgar Winter Group's unbelievable performance of Frankenstein. the sound and picture quality are spectacular on this dvd, well worth picking up.",1104883200,10,507,5.2592592592592595
1888904,4,B00009RDHK,"Pop is the music of the rebel. But it's also the music of the non-rebel, and with the OGWT, from the heart of the BBC establishment, non-rebellious, thinking-person's pop reached its zenith. Of course, punk knocked it all down in 1977, and with the help of Saturday Night Fever disco, pop suddenly became physical again. The OGWT never really recovered, and once Bob Harris had gone, competition from other TV programs such as Channel 4's 'The Tube' etc meant its days were numbered.

Which was a great pity, as all three OGWT compilation DVDs illustrate. The OGWT was a superb, must-see programme scheduled late on Tuesday evenings. You had to watch every show, firstly because there was no other TV programme showcasing 'album' music, and secondly because the Radio Times (the UK's TV listings magazine) never told you who would be appearing.

In the early 1970s I was at a boarding school, and our house was rationed to a TV maximum of three hours per week. Which programmes we watched were decided by the prefects (which brought them much undeserved popularity), and it says much about the quality of OGWT that this programme was always chosen.

These two DVDs have something of the feel of the TV programmes, except that they don't contain any interview material nor any of the wonderful animations chosen to accompany some tracks. (I never cease to be surprised at the number of occasions when I discuss OGWT with friends and they mention the 'Skiers' video chosen for Mike Oldfield's 'Tubular Bells'.) The introductions are, by and large, marvellous, if only to see how the artists and DJs look 30 years on.

The musical highlights, for me, are most of the 70s stuff, particularly Bill Withers (a fantastic performance of his 'Ain't No Sunshine', very much like the Carnegie Hall version on CD)and the Edgar Winter Group's 'Frankenstein', but there is so much else.

These DVDs will probably bring few new converts to the programme, but it's a treasure trove for those of us who were there at the time.",1096761600,20,2009,4.828488372093023
1888905,5,B00009RDHK,"This is an absolutely must for any person interested in early 70's folk/progressive artists to punk/new wave bands.  It's a real history of music from 1971 until 1987.
Nevertheless some artists have been left in the shelf and also there aren't artists from the first period of the programme (which started on september 1971). To name just a few: Steve Hillage (1976), Wishbone Ash, Family, CAN (!!!), Captain Beefheart, Camel (there's even a Pink Floyd clip going around,suposedly taken from OGWT).

1888907,3,B00009RDHK,"For some reason a search on Amazon of ""Old Grey Whistle Test"" only comes up with this initial DVD. Although very good, there have been two other releases of the show since then.
DVD's 2 & 3 are single disc formats with the latter being by far and away the best of all three. I initially bought the DVD primarily for 2 songs.... John Martyn's ""Couldn't love you more"" (with Danny Thompson on bass) and a 23yo Jackson Browne singing ""Jamaica say you will"" from his first album. The absolute highlight however is Steve Marriott and Humble Pie doing a classic version of ""Black coffee"".

1888908,4,B00009RDHK,"Nostalgic product reflecting a pre-MTV era. In fact, this WAS the MTV of it's day, I guess. Amazing how times have changed. Live music is always better and most of this is just that.
At the risk of annoying readers, I must correct the earlier reviewer over the origin of the programme's name -
It refers to the older, more formal members of the BBC who, as was the stereotype of the day, tended to wear the traditional, grey suit to work in that venerable institution. Now - and here's the good bit - rhyming slang for 'suit' is 'whistle' - as in 'whistle and flute' = 'suit'. With me? Furthermore, it was regarded that a good melody, whether heavy rock, reggae or pop, could be imitated at a later time by way of a subconcious whistle, regardless of the age. Who hasn't heard their Mum whistle a rendition of a classic whilst baking - I know I have! Anyway, if the old guys repeated a song in this way then it was deemed to have passed the 'test', worthy of the charts and the disc was duly mass-produced and rushed to the shops. Hence the Old Grey Whistle (suit) Test! There, you're wiser for that. Questions on a postcard, please.",1081209600,4,1133,4.374407582938389
1888909,5,B00009RDHK,"Out of an extensive collection of DVDs, this is the one I reach for habitually. Early in the morning, late at night, when I have five minutes to kill...whenever... there is always something on the disc to entertain.
The sound is good. The pictures precede the video age and therefore are excellent, and the commentry although a slight interruption at times, is enlightening and worth watching as well.
The disc also shows clearly why some musos stand the test of time, producing stuff which is timeless, while others can't quite cut it. Take Bill Withers Aint No Sunshine, for example. It is worth buying the DVD just for this performance.
Compare Bob Marley's Stir It Up to the Damned's Smash it Up for example. Bob's music accompanied by Peter Tosh etc. is classic whereas the Damned were OK but could hardly be called memorable.
Thanks to the fast forward button, I could bypass other forgettable performances, Roxy Music (Do the Strand), Lynard Skynard etc. and go directly to some fantastic and rare footage like Tim Buckley Dolphins, Tom Waits Tom Traubert's Blues, The Specials Message To You Rudi.

1888911,4,B00009RDHK,"other reviewers have given the vital information,and there's no need to repeat the description from the package. i just wanted to add a few things i see as helpful but missing from other submissions. the number one priority for me is: how is the quality?
as for the whistle test, i think it's very good. i give the visuals 5 stars, sound about 4. not that there is anything bad about the soundtrack, it just doesn't measure up to our latest standards, and we shouldn't expect it to.  the production values on the camera are first rate, and
much better than the musikladen series. for the most part, the direction is calm, and very watchable. the cameras are there just to record what happened, and not add their own fingerprint.
musikladen, creates a visual nervous tic with the ""acid spangler"" add-ons, which mar the experience. (the worst example of this kind of directors intrusion is ""cream---the farewell concert"". i truly despise how that footage was trampled on, and hope the original film exists sans the arty-farty lsd trip.)
since there aren't too many options to view rock and roll footage from the past, one shouldn't pass this one up. nice live performances from rory gallagher, little feat, captain beefheart, skynyrd, and more. there's something a bit fishy about alice cooper's performance---i think there is a mix of live and recorded tracks. roxy music is also canned, but very well done.
