8643841,4,B00IO6LCNQ,"It remains a mystery why Umberto Lenzi's gialli featuring Carroll Baker haven't been restored and properly released on dvd or blu ray. This release is a dvd-rom, with a full screen presentation of a well worn print. The audio is in English, no sub-titles, and clear throughout. It bothered me that the title of the film wasn't even printed on the disc (it is totally blank!), so you have to break out the sharpie and write it yourself--a little more effort would have been appreciated. Still, this is a welcome addition to any giallo library; the movie itself is languorous and stylish, the race car driving adds an interesting theme, and both Carroll Baker and Jean Sorel have good performances.",1517702400,,696,4.808333333333334
