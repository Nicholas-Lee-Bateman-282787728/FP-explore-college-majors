3174984,5,B0017S66JI,"REC is in my mind one the best zombie film i have seen since Day Of The Dead it's only 75 mins but it dose not matter how long it is cause this film had me on edge from start to finish.

The film is about a news crew who fallows a group of fire fighters they get a call to rescue a old lady in a block of apartments but happens next becomes a fight for survival and to make matters worse the army won't let the surivours out and it's up to them to find out what has caused this nightmare.

The whole film is in spainsh and the film is only 75 mins long but the film is scary as hell think of it as Blair Witch meets 28 Days Later it might take a while for the film to bulid but the final 15 mins is hart stopping highly recomended for those who love zombie film or anyone who wants to be scared s**tless.",1219363200,4,804,3.7797619047619047

3174986,1,B0017S66JI,"I think the movie itself is pretty good and I definitely jumped in places.  But find a different version.  The English dubbing in this film is TERRIBLE.  Its so distracting and some of the voice overs were nonsensical (why did one guy have an English accent) or offensive (I cringed at the accent they did for the Asian characters).  The voices weren't believable either - since they weren't in the filming, their voices don't have the same sense of anger, panic, fear, and other emotions.  I would have much rather watched it in original Spanish with English subtitles.",1508284800,3,570,4.775510204081633

I was watched the streaming version June 2017, and it was not the dubbed version. I don't know if Amazon can ""fix"" all these reviews or not, but all the bad reviews are for a product that no longer exists.

This is an great Spanish-made horror film. The only caveats would be it is subtitled now, so if you're not into subtitles then you won't like this one. Also, it's mostly shot POV, so if you don't like found footage films then this might not be your cup of tea either. I don't care about those things, so I thought this was great. It's about a bunch of people who are trapped in an apartment building where the people inside are one by one turning into zombies. It starts off a little slow, but once it heats up it's worth the wait. For academics, lots of uncanny moments, plenty of Kristevian abjection, no final girl.",1497830400,3,955,4.305555555555555

3175009,1,B0017S66JI,"Again, no English dub, no watch.

I'm not 100% opposed to watching movies subtitled.  I can't tell you how many countless Anime I watched subbed back in the day due to the limitations and format constraints of the time (VHS was only able to offer one audio track).  But once DVD's were introduced (then Blu-ray, streaming, et al), I find no excuse not to offer/create multiple language tracks in any territory studios provide movies in.  I do not want to divert my eyes from the cinematography to read lines of dialog.  And for those who don't mind this, and are so good at it that it doesn't take away from their movie watching experience, great for you.  You can consider yourself better than me.  I'll stick to my dubs, thank you.  And for those who feel I'm missing out on some great films due to a limited viewpoint, take comfort.  There are more movies out there than one can watch in a lifetime, other great movies, in English, or dubbed in English, and I'll spend my time watching those instead.  I'm entitled to my own opinion and preferences, and I'll continue to support film studios who demonstrate care for my enjoyment, providing English dubs.

Amazon needs to do a better job of labeling movies that only offer English subtitles with no dub.  They do so on some, but not on others; why?  One only has to read other similar reviews on countless movies on their site to see that this frustrates many of their customers, not just me.

As for the movie, if they make an English dub, or offer one in the future, I'll watch it and adjust my rating.  Until then, the one star is for Amazon's lack of clear labeling.",1495929600,,1623,4.491467576791809

3175014,4,B0017S66JI,"Spanish director Jaume Balaguer&oacute;'s 2009 breakout scarefest manifests real claustrophobia, blinding terror and stomach churning off-kilter visuals a full 8 years after The Blair Witch Project ushered in the ultimate Fin de millenium reflection on the ghost in the machine: our technology only serves to usher us faster into the truth of the abyss--- we are the monsters in our fairy tales-- always have been, always will be.  Shaky-cams are a legitimate horror genre that is preoccupied with welding the audience's sensibilities with the protagonist's in a rat-swallowed-by-a-snake POV aesthetic. This Go-Pro Gothic approach can elevate the horror genre when used as general social commentary and also as a pointed attempt to address horror's specific touchstones: judging the unreliable narrator, distinguishing the real-life counterparts of supernatural monsters, defining good and evil within a miasmatic location that works against rationality. [REC] succeeds with some of this, but not all, unlike the classic Blair Witch.

Skewering local media hacks who work for a TV show called ""While You Sleep"" (The original title of Balaguer&oacute;'s disappointing 2012 thriller,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleep-Tight/dp/B009X5GN40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleep Tight</a>). [REC] gives the reporter and her cameraman the comeuppance of ""careful what you wish for"" and the audience a thrill ride through a haunted house. The final scenes are bladder-emptying terrifying, attributable to wobbly, wiry actor Javier Botet who became an international monster player after [REC], inhabiting every gender of Nightmare Character from female ghosts (Mama 2013, Crimson Peak 2015 & Don't Knock Twice 2016), to a warlock graphically pooped out of a Goddess's sphincter (Witching And Bitching 2013), to an incubus in The Revenant (2015).",1493510400,2,1879,6.086792452830188

It's just not the same to watch it dubbed. Should have left the option to watch it in Spanish or English rather than forcing the English instead.

As for those of you saying this is a ripoff of Quarantine, you have it backwards. Quarantine is a copy of this movie for the English audience except they changed the story a bit as they usually do when remaking a film.",1491696000,3,523,4.336734693877551

3175020,5,B0017S66JI,"A ""found footage"" horror film that revs up to a chilling conclusion.  Two film students go out in search of a story and find themselves trapped in an apartment building that has been struck by a mysterious contagion too powerful to be contained.  The storyline unfolds slowly and subtly until it finally bubbles over into senseless chaos.  Because it is filmed, putatively, by a portable camera, production issues tend to become moot leaving the raw story and the characters trapped in it.  The isolation and desolation the two students experience are very visceral and, especially towards the end, terrifying.  A highly notable film that really captures the essence of fear, bewilderment and chaos.

3175035,5,B0017S66JI,"I don't know why but foreign horror films have beautifully more layers than American ones- our horror films are so tied to specific tropes that even well-acted and well-directed ones seen pretty shallow on the surface.  This is a fast-paced European horror film of quality;  Manuela Velasco is captivating as the female lead, playing a host of a local TV reality, human interest late night show called While You Are Asleep.  On this episode, she and her cameraman are doing a ride-along with a night shift firefighting crew, that is if they even get a call.  They do and soon find themselves in a situation they can't cope with.  I normally am not a fan of shaky camera footage- as almost everyone who has made found footage films post-the original Blair Witch have ruined the concept and run it into the ground- but [Rec] ties the reason for it into the plot seemlessly.  Now. I'm not endorsing the sequels as I've not seen them yet, but if the same people are at the reins I'll take a chance on those, too.

3175042,2,B0017S66JI,My mistake for not reading the reviews to see it was the English dubbed version that Amazon chose not to disclose in their description. The dubbing is pathetic and the incessant screaming of the reporter makes you wish it was a silent movie. Not only is it dubbed but the entire original soundtrack appears to be wiped slick so none of the original feel of the movie is left as others have stated. a few creepy scenes cant overcome the screaming and dubbing and anyone who has rated this above 2-stars most likely didn't see the same version I watched last night since Amazon has a tendency to commingle reviews of a film no matter what the version may be or what was done to enhance the viewer experience. I pay for my rentals with the credits received for delaying my prime shipments or Id be looking for a refund also.

3175074,5,B0017S66JI,"This movie, although it is dubbed, is honestly one of the most terrifying ones i have seen in my life. As is aforementioned, this movie is dubbed, and if you cant get past the fact that the lips will not line up with the words, than so be it. Your loss. But if you can get through about ten minutes of this at the start, you won't really see lips moving anymore, and you will be able to experience the viewing of one of the greatest modern day horror films. Just to get it out there, this technically is a zombie movie, but not a typical one at all. The beginning includes an entrancing story starter and nauseatingly well done special effects, and the rest of the movie is no different. And the ending is quite possibly one of the most creepy i have ever seen, and that is really saying something. Overall, this is most likely my favorite horror film as of now, and if you can get past the not to bad dubbing, you will enjoy it immensely.",1456531200,2,939,4.222222222222222
3175075,5,B0017S66JI,"I'm ignoring the dubbing issue for now because although it is a valid issue it's not enough reason to skip this film. In fact, rather than bring down the entire rating for what is quickly becoming a classic film, I wish those who gave it one star had given it at least three so as to be more fair to every other aspect of the production. I will say that this is pretty bad dubbing as dubbing goes and a subtitled version should be at least offered in addition. In truth, most of the talking occurs at the beginning of the film, which quickly develops into a major horror-suspense-action type film that is not dependent on dialog.

This is also a ""point of view"" or ""shaky-cam"" film and many of those have a rightfully bad reputation. I recently saw one that became totally unintelligible minutes long shots of the ground by a bouncing camera. You can take this type of realism too far. But these people know what they're doing. I don't know what the technique is, but the camera is steady enough when it needs to be and shaky and disjointed enough to preserve the sense of realism that it is supposed to.

The set up is delightfully simple. In Barcelona there is a local show called ""While You Sleep"" where a female announcer and a cameraman visit various venues where people work the night shift. This night it is to a local fire station and it's a pretty slow night. So slow is it, that they have to fill time shooting hoops in the station's basketball court. Then they get a call, just the thing the TV crew is hoping for, though later on they will wish it had never come in.

In the zombie universe this is an ""Infected"" film with fast-moving zombies, the kind where just one or two can be totally lethal. The cast is totally believable and doesn't overact, the downfall of many low budget films. The action moves quickly - the whole film is only 78 minutes - and is totally believable and gripping. The director and writers managed to cut away all the frills and make one of the most intense films of the whole genre. One of their best decisions was  to stick to one single building, which avoided the overreach of many films that try to show a large scale outbreak with a small scale budget, and which also keeps the atmosphere claustrophobically tense and dangerous.

This film came from nowhere and is now often included in Top Ten lists in the zombie genre. It deserves it. The production company did an unusual thing with the sequel and subsequent sequels and changed the basic premise. I won't say any more because I don't want to spoil anything, but I thought it worth mentioning.",1456272000,,2592,4.471458773784355

I watched on a mobile device while wearing headphones and it was pretty intense. My only major complaint isn't with the film at all, but this version of it.

3175171,4,B0017S66JI,"**NO SPOILERS**

REC is one of the landmark ""found footage"" films, up there with Blair Witch, and there's a reason for it. But REC has been reviewed and discussed ad nauseum since its release, so what's the big deal? The plain and simple fact is that, in my opinion, it all comes down to the basic requirements of any great FF film: the acting is believable and the camerawork is equally (purposefully) amateurish which, combined, offer us the unique opportunity to be personally engaged in the on-screen action.

In the case of REC, we're convincingly trapped in the same apartment building as the tv crew, police, firemen, and residents. The feeling of being besieged by a mysterious attacker (in this case... well, I promised no spoilers, so you'll have to wait to see...) and unable to escape it.

This one's absolutely worth a rental, though know that you'll need to accept the film is dubbed in English, so just be ready for some moments of off-timed dialogue (though these are hardly noticable, I think it's important to note it is dubbed).

3175176,5,B0017S66JI,"I cannot say enough good things about this brilliant horror flick, as it ranks in my top 3 favorite of all time in this genre, and is by far the best found footage iteration out there.  The greatest strength of this movie is that it succeeds in making you feel like you're trapped in the building with the protagonists, scared out of your mind, and you don't have the slightest idea what you're even up against, because the filmmakers ingeniously draw out the reveal as long as possible.  So many great scares, so much suspense, and filmed so well, you forget a lot of times that it's yet another found footage attempt.  This should definitely be on every horror fanatics ""must see"" list, if you haven't done so already.  Seriously, it's magnificent.
One parting note, and I cannot stress this enough - DO NOT WATCHED THE VERSION DUBBED IN ENGLISH.

I think, even if you hate it, there has to be at least one scene in either one them that will cause you to sit up in your seat. They can really hold the tension. If you haven't seen this or Quarantine, It revolves around a girl making a low budget documentary about this fire department in Barcelona. They get called out to an apartment where there is a disturbance. She goes with them still filming the whole thing. Her partner is actually filming it and since hes filming it, I think you only see him a few times in the whole movie. It mostly focuses on the girl. While the firemen and she are in the apartment building, it gets quarantined and none of them can leave. A few try to leave during the movie and get shot down. Its a typical, who is the real enemy, the zombies or the government. By the way, I shouldve said right off, its a shaky camera zombie movie. Its really gruesome in some seems too. The ending, to try not to give anything away is kind of chilling. The acting is pretty decent. This review is really for both the Spanish and American version, since they are both almost identical. Its just a good old fashioned zombie movie, with the shaky camera gimmick, which is so popular these days, thrown in to make it more appealing, but I think the movie industry over does a good thing a lot.",1402099200,,1408,4.316981132075472

However, knowing this movie had true sequels I couldn't just skip it. What I got was a movie I considered to be just as good as Quarantine and probubly would've enjoyed even more had I seen it first.

This movie's characters felt better acted (though I've actually only seen this movie dubbed) and more willing to take action then their american counterparts. This is espically prominant in Angela and the main firefighter. The people within the apartment appeared more willing to cooperate and were more trusting of each other, whereas Quarantine's residents felt very arrogent and racist in a couple spots. Also the ending was surprising to me as while it made the film less realistic, it justified the existance of the sequels and allowed this universe to be explored further.

The only gripe I have with this version is that too many characters just vanish off screen, Quarantine did a better job showing every characters fate. Definutly the superior film in almost every fashion and a good movie to enjoy.",1391558400,,1131,4.885416666666667
3175196,3,B0017S66JI,"It's not quite worth a buy rate, but it ever comes out on rental, take a few hours off and give it a look.  Even though its a found footage horror film, you have to give it a chance and keep your eyes on it to catch all the features.  It lags in places, but when it takes off it goes.  Some of the scares are haunted house, but for an era of zombie films it manages solid jump scares and creative interpretations.

Four star for any film aficionados, and the advice to either learn Spanish or get an original version with subtitles.  The formalistic use of difference in moments reflected in the change of the characters, and effects on the camera adding the fear are a bit blatant, but excellent none the less.

Film snob aside, the voice over gets a little detracting at times.  The film's calm points employ a good amount of dialog to fill the gaps, and the loss of diajetic volume and the actors natural voice robs what would otherwise be a tightly woven film.  As it is, I'm an English speaking viewer who doesn't subtitles, particularly when so much effort went into crafting the form of the film.

Rec holds a definite place on its own, and clear why it had so many spinoffs and have its shot stolen or reworked.  Problem is this is 2014: as so many films have ripped it off over the years, it has a played out feeling.  It's magic has been delineated a bit.

Zombie films are pastiche: there is little to zilch around this fact.  However, to compare this as just another Night of the Living Dead insults both films.  Instead, Rec. should be considered in among the Horror films that deal with escaping a lethal unknown in an enclosed environment.  Instead of zombies coming from all sides, the zombies are among a group of people trying to find an escape instead of keeping the zombies at bay.

Low budget: damn right it is, and proud of it.  The only thing I'd change is adding a proper Dub or good subtitles.",1390435200,,1918,4.372881355932203

The camera work is a little annoying, but I understand the whole idea of 'lost footage' type films.  The one unrealistic thing about this is if I were the news team, I would have ditched the camera and barricaded myself in an apartment about 10 minutes into the ordeal. Screw the public's right to receive fair and accurate coverage of the situation.  Self preservation is an instinct I take very seriously.  But other than that...

3175219,5,B0017S66JI,"REC is the original Spanish movie that inspired ''Quarantine''.

REC is definitely one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The ending is truly horrifying. It is also a really short movie, running less than 80 minutes.

The movie is filmed in ''Found Footage'' style. It is about a reporter named Angela who is doing a documentary with her cameraman Pablo about the daily routines of people who work in a fire station. Suddenly the firehouse receives a call to an apartment to help an old woman and Angela and Pablo go with them. When they get there, the old woman attacks a police officer, biting the skin off his neck. They then try to leave the building, but the police officers outside start to quarantine the building saying that there is an infection. The movie then becomes a zombie film where the characters are getting bitten one by one and turning into zombies. Near the end, we find out it is not really an infection. Angela finds a tape on the top floor, and the man on the tape talks about a girl who was possessed by an evil spirit. We find out that when you get bitten, you become possessed by this evil spirit. The man then mentions that he locked the girl in a room on the top floor, which is where Angela and Pablo are. They are then attacked by the possessed girl who is now horrifically emaciated. She screams loudly and swings a hammer at them.

This point is actually tragically unfortunate do to the fact that the two movies are almost exact replicas. [REC] was done in a far more fan pleasing method. The acting was more believable, the characters were more likeable, the pace was faster and the movie was just overall more enjoyable. This returns us to my original comment of how unfortunate it was that I saw QUARANTINE first. Since these films are replicas, I knew exactly what was going to happen which really took away from the suspense and tension of what should have been a great watch. Another Hollywood remake ruins a, should be, classic film. So for people who haven't seen QUARANTINE this is a 4 star flick. Otherwise, this is only 2.5 to 3 stars.",1367712000,,835,4.610738255033557

My conclusion: Pretty much everything about this movie is either extremely annoying or just plain old:

- Shaky Blair-Witch-esque amateur camera gimmick:
Apart from the fact that this is 100% unoriginal, it is just insanely annoying. The camera guy is supposed to be a professional, yet he manages to make even the easiest shots super-shaky while constantly zooming in and out. WHY??? I guess to make the lame story appear more dynamic?

- The female reporter protagonist:
She is CONSTANTLY screaming and panicking. Half way into the movie I was just hoping for her to die but she didn't and her hysterical screaming has pretty much ruined the movie for me.

- The story:
There's really not much to say about the story, except it's a zombie movie within a locked environment. Not a bad idea at all and a zombie movie doesn't at all need a highly complex story to be good.
The problem is, it's all been done before and there is nothing shocking, captivating surprising about REC.
If you like the shaky camera gimmick and constantly screaming women, you might like it.

The original did at least as good and possibly better job of making available a great horror movie that is both scary and claustrophobic and did so with one heck of a smaller budget.
I wonder if Hollywood remains capable of making an original good horror movie of if it has declined to the point where we HAVE to literally rob foreign film makers in making re-do's of their films? It has been quite some time since this country has made a really great horror movie with very few exceptions (Spliter, 30 Days of Night,American Psycho, a small handful of others).
Like in so many other areas, America is no longer the maker of the best of everything. Makes ya wonder if the Romans actually knew they were declining when the evidence was so apparent that indeed they were. Now with Obama dead set on Socializing our country at a faster pace than it was already on. Obama is dead set on removing all incentives to excel by his attempts to ""level the income gap"" while not rewarding hard work and sacrifice with EARNED financial incentives. Our once ""Greatest Country On Earth"" is on a MUCH steeper decline thanks to ""Barry"". We are not falling like Rome, we have already fell and merely awaiting the impact. The proof is easily seen in our ever increasing reliance on copying the works of other countries, be it movies, cars or what have you. In a year our for the moment, greatest healthcare system available anywhere will also decline into mediocrity by way of Socialism.

3175247,5,B0017S66JI,"REC (2007) is a horror thriller with an unusual perspective, as the premise is that the entire movie consists of video shot by the camera of a television crew, as they follow the activities of a fire department unit.  While on a run, things suddenly get really weird, as a group of people find themselves trapped in a building where an outbreak has occurred.

Written and directed by Paco Plaza and Jaume Balaguero, this production with Spanish as the spoken language, is completely effective and terrifying, even when following along reading subtitles.  Creatively staged and shot, the movie has a live ""realtime"" feel that captures the immediacy of the situations, and the pulse pounding excitement and fear when threats are encountered.  Subtracting the end credits, the movie has a briskly flowing runtime of about 73 minutes.

TV host Angela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) and her camera operator Pablo (Pablo Rosso) are at a fire station shooting a piece about firemen, when a call comes in and they join the unit as they go out on a call.  They enter a three storey apartment building, and together with two policemen, break into a unit where an old woman is apparently ill.  Behaving strangely, the woman bites one of the cops in the neck.  The group retreats downstairs, but when they attempt to leave the building, they find that it has been locked down, and the authorities are preventing anyone from leaving.

After one of the firemen is injured, the old woman is shot dead by Officer Joven (Jorge-Yamam Serrano), when she attacks.  Those trapped inside do attempt to get out, but find soldiers blocking their way.  With communications mysteriously knocked out, Angela is determined to record what is happening, particularly when a health inspector from disease control, enters the building to examine the wounded.  The inspector reveals that the building has been identified as the source of a disease.  When the injured become violent and escape, it triggers a chain reaction of panic and terror, that builds like a wave which finally comes crashing down at the film's sudden and shocking finish, that might leave you quivering with shock.

REC starts quite innocuously with a spirit of fun, and then suddenly plunges into a dark world full of uncertainly and immense danger.  The building becomes like a prison, where the survivors trapped inside first become victims of the disease, and once infected, join the raging hoard thirsting for blood.  As the intensity of the violence progresses, the setting becomes darker as electrical power is cut off, until the light mounted to the camera, becomes the sole source of illumination.  When that is gone, the camera's infrared viewer provides the film's final images.

The ferociousness, speed, and the propensity of the infected to suddenly pop out of the dark and tear you to shreds, makes the infected pretty frightening.  The victims have few weapons, and have little choice but to run for their lives.  It's not really believable that Pablo the cameraman would continue to shoot, when people are being attacked, or when he is running of his life, but when you are caught up in the mayhem of what seems to be real event, it rather easy to forget about those aspects of ""reality"".

While everything is seen through Pablo's camera, Angela remains in view much of the time, attempting to report what is happening, as things are going to hell.  Manuela Velasco is fantastic, giving an edgy performance that is completely convincing and believable, as her emotions and reactions are a barometer for what is happening.  The supporting cast are all also very good, including a little girl who suddenly who turns into a monster.  The writing generally keeps things very tight, with little extraneous dialog or hysterics, making REC an impactful and scary film that moves briskly, that generally remains very focused.

Creative, edgy, and to the point, REC was very well received critically, and garnered several awards in the horror community.  It is hinted at, but not explicitly stated what the infected are suffering from, however this matter is explored further in the sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/REC-2/dp/B003Q6D246/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">REC 2</a>&nbsp;(2009), which was then followed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/REC-3-Genesis/dp/B008S9D1V0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">REC 3 Genesis</a>&nbsp;(2012).

3175256,5,B0017S66JI,"Mommy!!! Holy crap, I almost lost my sh-- several times, watching this. [REC] is unsettling stuff, and terrifying and in Spanish. It certainly thunderously redeems the sub-genre of the found footage film. When you see [REC], no need then to see its less satisfying American remake, QUARANTINE, which damningly seems to be a shot-for-shot adaptation. In that lost trove of found footage film, the [REC] franchise and, more recently, CHRONICLE, set themselves apart. I'd even add CLOVERFIELD to that short list, except I don't want my feelings hurt.

Paella, Pau Gasol, and [REC] - this is Spain hooking up the rest of the world. See, when done right, the found film footage provides chills that feel more visceral and immediate. [REC] begins in humdrum manner, with a television crew deployed to a local fire station in Barcelona to do a piece on firefighters or, as the Spanish are won't to call them, ""los bomberos"" (which sounds cooler). When the firefighters on shift respond to an emergency call, the television crew accompanies them to an apartment tenement in which an elderly woman is screaming non-stop. But a routine call soon spirals out of control when the health authorities arrive to seal off the building, stranding the news team, the firefighters, policemen, and the residents with an undefined menace. But I'll define it... and SPOILER it.... old Mrs. Izquierdo is a zombie.

Here's a neat thing: Director of Photography, Pablo Rosso, not only wields the point-of-view camera himself but he also played the role of the in-movie news team's cameraman ""Pablo."" I'll tell you what, it takes some sort of steely fiber for someone to keep hoisting that camera while spooky paranormal shizzy is going down.

The plot isn't deep. The narrative is populated by stock characters. That's okay. [REC] overcomes the shackles of its tropes by dint of its vitality and nervy execution and presentation. It's rated R for ""bloody horror violence and language,"" but it also should've mentioned the film's knack for inducing nerve-jangling claustrophobia. The building which traps our characters probably looks welcoming and quaint by daylight, but at night and as seen thru the confines of a handheld camera, the environs transmogrify into these disquieting dark and cramped quarters. This frightener takes full advantage of its conceit, of this one camera providing the first person perspective. The most alarming concern becomes not about what's in front of us, but rather the thing that could be waiting to pounce on us just off-camera. That there's no soundtrack at all until the end credits roll bolsters that sense of jagged, stripped-down believability. The third act is relentless in its visceral scares. I had to turn the light on. Those bloodcurdling screams aren't coming from old Mrs. Izquierdo alone.

3175258,4,B0017S66JI,"I was unfortunate enough to watch Quarantine in theaters first, and while it's not a bad movie on it's own, it's representation of one year later remakes is a baffaling and stupid idea that Quarantine represents. If you haven't seen either really just watch the original if you can find it somewhere.

Anyways the story is pretty simple and has probably been explained countless times already on this site so I'll just skip that, but the plot and setting set up a stifling sense of claustrophobia and dread, similar to John Carpenter's The Thing. Lots of zombie movies like to squeeze the survivors between the zombie theat and the trigger happy military threat, however [REC] kept the military aspect nice and simple instead of trying to make some political point. The zombies themselves looked great too, they were drenched in blood, twitched around, and had a stark-raving mad look in their eyes while making wheezing noises. The scares themselves were good because they weren't cheap. What most American horror filmmakers seem to misunderstand is that startling the audience isn't the same as scaring them, just because your movie goes ""BOO! HAHA MADE YOU JUMP YOU MUST BE SCARED NOW"" doesn't mean it's scary. [REC] instead sets up it's atmosphere to great effect, and the zombies don't just jump out behind someone like in the Talking Dumb (a great lesson in how NOT to do zombies).

Overall [REC] is very effective because it's simplicity and it knows how to set up and maintain a great atmosphere. The ending itself is especially effective when you imagine being thrust into a blackout. A must for any zombie fan.",1332892800,,1620,4.887272727272728

The thing I was most afraid of was the ""video camera"" style POV that I read most reviews mention. I thought it was going to be grainy, and all over the place like other films of this type. I was pleasanly surpised. It's not bad at all! Although its supposed to be a raw footage type of feel, it's very easy to adjust to. It doesn't shake around the whole time giving you headaches and making the movie hard to watch. It's perfect.

I also really liked the absence of a score. Thats what made it feel authentic. Of course there's not really going to be a zombie outbreak, but no music made it feel like it really was just a news girl trying to get a story. There wasn't any ""over the top"" blood. It was just the right amount.

Bottom line, this is a really well put together movie. It's got everything you could want. There's some startling moments, there's some frightening moments. I get a real rush and a sense of excitement when I watched this movie. Thats something I don't ever get hardly anymore.

3175262,4,B0017S66JI,"Handheld POV horror from Spain, in which a small, unwitting television crew tails a pair of firemen into the mouth of madness. The Blair Witch / Paranormal Activity thing has been done a dozen times over by now, with varying degrees of believability and success, but this is one of the better examples of what the format can do. Starting slow with a series of missed cues and tame vignettes for the camera that introduce the primary characters, (a cute minor TV personality and the two generic firemen who allow her to tag along for the evening) it slowly, deliberately adds new faces and developments, building tension until everything finally boils over in a geyser of chaos and terror. Working wonders with a small cast of unknowns, it wrings every bit of potential out of an admirably simple concept without stretching beyond its means. The storyline is equal parts quiet suspense and startling horror, masking its budgetary shortcomings with a temperamental light source and a set of large-lunged ladies. I'm not often one to take the bait and jump during this kind of flick, but even I have to admit it caught me once or twice. A solid, entertaining ball of dread that reaches and surpasses the limits of its overplayed genre, it's great material for a dark, windy night at home.",1331856000,,1285,4.792792792792793

Certainly the acting is first rate, beginning with Manuela Velasco as the news reporter assigned to the firehouse.  The rest of the cast is excellent including some older crazy ladies who become zombie-like killers.  The ""shaky cam"" stunts are old school now thanks to ""The Blair Witch Project"" but used here it is clearly effective.  Maybe this should have won an award for best use of a dollar, err...peso in 2007.  Pretty scary stuff, even when you know it's coming.  P. S. - Skip the sequel!",1330300800,,700,4.688524590163935

3175265,5,B0017S66JI,"Rec is a gem in low budget horror flicks.  Now, after reading several other reviews and how many people complained about the main characters incessant screaming throughout the film, I can only imagine that they must have watched it overdubbed in English.  Being a native Spanish speaker, I was able to watch this film the way it was meant to.  With that said, I can't explain how great the acting is.  I don't want to spoil anything but when the events play out in that building, I felt the terror all those characters felt.  Also, many people will complain about the way the camera shakes, as the entire film is shot through the first person perspective.  It will be jumpy, but not as much as REC2 or even Cloverfield.  But having played first person shooters my entire life I have no problems with watching a film shot this way.  With a running time of an hour and fourteen minutes or so, it's really not much to endure.
Lately, I've been turning towards other countries to get my horror on and this was truly a nice catch.  I haven't seen Quarantine, which was an American remake to REC but whether or not you speak Spanish, this is a great film to watch, IN SPANISH.  So take lessons, date a foreigner, whatever.  Just try and watch this film the way it was meant to be told and you will be rewarded.

3175266,4,B0017S66JI,"I never heard about [REC] until early last year when someone on a message board for 28 Days Later suggested it. I watched it a few days later, and recommended it to all of my friends who, like me, were getting bored of horror movies doing the same things these days. That's not to make [REC] sound like it's something completely original, but it certainly was a breath of fresh air in this era of torture movies like Saw, Hostel and many others. This movie does everything right, and really is one of the best 'found footage' movies I've ever seen. If you're one of the people who were disappointed with The Blair Witch Project for not showing you much to be afraid of, [REC] might be more up your alley, because it sure as heck doesn't hold back. Just keep in mind that this movie is originally in Spanish, something that a lot of reviewers apparently take personally. Reading a movie?! Preposterous! Oh the memories of working in a movie store are coming back to me...

Angela is the hostess for a show called While You're Asleep, which covers various jobs and events that take place while the people of Barcelona are sleeping. She, with her cameraman Pablo, are covering a local fire station, and things aren't very exciting. They trudge around showing the firemen doing incredible things like eating dinner, sleeping and showing off their suits. Suddenly they get an emergency call for a woman trapped in her apartment and they take off. Angela and Pablo go along with them to the building, and the few residents that live there are all waiting in the hallway. It's in the early AM hours, so tension is a bit high, especially when police have the area surrounded for some odd reason. Angela and Pablo follow a few men to the trapped woman's room, and it's obvious that something's wrong. She attacks and bites one of them, and everyone else rushes out. Things take a huge turn for the worse when the building is sealed and no one's letting the residents know what's going on. Even the special agent who's supposed to give orders is left in the dark for the most part. A virus is spreading, and in such a confined area, with limited lights and no way out...things don't look very good for our reporter.

A lot happens as soon as Angela and Pablo enter the apartment, and the movie moves at such a fast pace that you can't believe it's over when it is. There were no boring parts, all of the actors were genuine in their delivery and expressions, and the infection plot, while definitely overused now, is at least a little more interesting than every other zombie movie or game that comes out on a monthly basis. Since the movie's all filmed on Pablo's camera, you're put right into the situation, stuck with him and Angela as they try to find safety in the slim apartment building. None of his shots are pointless, and there's always something happening that he's capturing on film, moving the story along at the perfect pace. It also helps to have Manuela Velasco, who's very easy on the eyes, in nearly every shot. The characters never really make any stupid moves and react realistically, and I had a lot of sympathy for everyone here, which is rare. There's no self-centered jerk who you want to get killed off, no annoying would-be leader who makes poor decisions, none of the usual stereotypes in horror movies. Kills are relatively quick but still gruesome to see with little CG work. In fact, nearly everything here looks to be done with good ol' makeup. There's nothing bad I can say about the movie except for that I didn't care for the ending. Granted, [REC]2 came out not too long ago, but I would've liked a little more substance to how this one ended.

Yeah, there's still no US blu-ray of this movie, so I'm stuck reviewing the dvd, which isn't bad. In fact, since the movie's shot on small video cameras, it won't look much better on blu-ray anyway. The picture quality is great for what it is, but still hard to say anything bad about given the style. You get some 'errors' in the picture here and there, but they're obviously intentional. The audio's done in an effective 5.1 Surround mix, with screams and howls going on all over the place and audio 'errors' exactly where they should be when something happens to the camera or microphone. The dvd that I watched only had audio in Spanish with optional English subtitles. If you want an English dub, you'll have to wait, or just go with Quarantine (oh come on, it's the SAME MOVIE).

The special features are a bit lacking, but what's here is still nice. You get a great Making Of featurette that covers a lot of ground and answers a lot of questions regarding the story and what was happening with the virus. I loved hearing that the actors didn't get to see a lot of things until the filming began, in order to get real reactions to things. It reminded me of how no one got to see LeatherFace in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre until it came to the actor's death scenes. What better way to get a scared reaction?

[REC] is one of my favorite horror movies by far. I can see why people who loved 28 Days Later love this one as well, and am ashamed of myself for not seeing the sequel yet. If 'reading a movie' bothers you, then you can watch Quarantine and essentially get the same thing out of it. And if you're sick of movies that do nothing but try to show off cool ways of killing people, you will more than likely like this little beauty here.",1318723200,4,5426,4.5045685279187815

3175274,5,B0017S66JI,"First of all ill explain a few things:
I stumbled upon the dubbed version of this film by accident which i found the dubbing completely horrible. About 10 minutes into it i gave up and went on to search for it's original language with subtitles.
I found me a copy and saw it was a film shot in my home country's language of Spanish which was a big bonus for me.
Now i never seen Quarantine before and although i learned that Q was the American remake i still decided to watch REC first.

Let me say that there was prolly a few boring moments in the first 10 or 15 minutes of the film but after that i was locked and glued to my TV. Ive seen many horror films since the 60s and this one blew me the heck away!
Aside from the normal beginning there was not one single minute of boring or terror filled moments. The eerie and frightening atmosphere of the surroundings had a real feeling especially with the amateur camera work.
You know the rest if you read the other reviews.

From reading the reviews i suspect that most people who submitted a bad or unsatisfied low rating review have watched this film dubbed or at least with subtitles.
Now i have watched all versions and the dubbed version is absolutely horrible! It really kills this film period.
For those who didn't like watching it subtitles then you have a legit beef but there is nothing compared to this unless you understand Spanish. It really adds a whole new light to the film since reading subtitles (which isn't really that bad) is still slightly distraction and still not very accurate in translation.

Now we move on to the remake Quarantine.
Being a heavy movie fanatic for decades i can honestly say that they should of never made a remake and rather should of made a better dubbed version with the sounds and everything better emulated.
Now Quarantine was great but compared to REC it doesn't even come close. Did they really have to remake it almost shot by shot (especially with the same actors we always see becomes a huge bore)?
This is why i believe some rate down this film and say either Quarantine was better or the same since the remake is in English with no horrible dubbing to subtitles to read.

REC1 coupled with REC2 is like 28 days later, blair witch and paranormal activity with a touch of The Exorcist combined.

3175279,4,B0017S66JI,"REC, directed by Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza, is a 2007 Spanish horror chronicling the assignment given to reporter Angela and her cameraman Pablo, employees of a television show documenting the goings-on of Barcelona's nighttime world.  For this episode, Angela and Pablo spend the night in a fire station conducting interviews and recording any subsequent developments.  Cursory introductions and plot explanations are promptly executed before the firemen are called away with Angela/Pablo in tow to an apartment complex for a woman in distress.

I'll avoid any story specifics from here on because the horrific calamity most certainly deserves your own discovery, not mine.  I will say that there is an undead theme here, but with a unique derivative that I did appreciate.  Vague, I know, but American horror's blatant spoon-feeding of basic plots has pushed me in a foreign direction.  Because of this, I hate to give anything away about a movie that has so dutifully worked at a progressive watching experience.  Not to say REC is some sublime labyrinth of genius writing, but it is textured enough to be notable, considering the subject matter.

REC is disturbing, volatile, and there were a few scenes that really did startle me.  The end of the movie houses one of the most petrifying character situations I've seen.  For these alone, the effort here, to me, is a win.

The only problem I had was with the camera work.  I'm not unfamiliar with the shaky-camera style of filming, in fact, Blair Witch still hovers in my top-ten favorite movies of any genre.  REC hit it a little too hard, though.  Consider that in both Blair Witch and Cloverfield, the, ""protagonists"" did much better jobs keeping their cameras steady than the assumed professional in REC.  Jitters add realism to these films, but Senor Pablo exhibited grand mal seizure symptoms while standing still in a hallway.  It got old.

Aside from that, this is a groovy little rush of cheek-ripping celluloid that should absolutely be required viewing for anyone interested in first-person horror.

Well done, Spain.  I hope you'll allow my representation of the American proper so that I may apologize for our horrendous remake of your fantastic original.

It absolutely upheld my expectations. The subtitles don't take anything away from the suspense and the story made much more sense than the movie. In fact, I still can't figure out what Quarantine is ACTUALLY about because it's just scary without a well thought out story line. The only thing I will say is that the American ""infected"" actors have really figured out how to act the part, when in some (rec) scenes the acting falls short a little bit. The first ""infected"" older woman that the firefighters respond to at the beginning of the movie, looks like an old woman with makeup on...more like an extra than an actor.

There are a few differences: some characters are added while some are deleted entirely, the causes behind the ""infection"" share nothing in common, and of course the differences in language and location. Everything else is almost identical, right down to the set and more than a few of the shots. Rec improves on parts of it's American counterpart, most of all a scene that shocked the actors because they had no idea it was coming. Their genuine horror makes Quarantine's characters response border on the unfazed. Another amazing fact is that only a few of the actors in the film are ""legit"". Most of the performers had never acted before, but you'd never guess it since they're so believable. Another improvement over Quarantine is the reveal of the final character. A creature really. It's not CGI although it looks like it. Perfect! I can't say which film is the best because both have what the other lacks imo. I suggest giving both a try to come to your own conclusion.

My review is short and sweet because you shouldn't know anything about it before going into this baby.

Here is the review of the Spanish language version of this film.

REC is very scary, and it will make you jump out of your seat. - thats all.

I dare you to watch it sober, alone, late at night and in a old dark house.  In any case watching it in a very dark room with a good surround system will heighten the experience.

I was not to crazy about the way REC ends but it is daring and is probably the correct ending for this type of film.

REC deserves 5 stars for suspense and jump out of your seat scares - since that is probably all that the film makers intended then they delivered the goods. I decided to give it one star less only because I can't recommend REC to anyone but horror fans.

I would not reconmend the English language version to anyone even including horror fans - the folks on Amazon that gave REC a bad review probably didn't like subtitles.  Dont be put off by sub-titles otherwise stay away.

My thanks to everyone involved in the film - director, crew and cast - good job! I have not seen a good scarey film in a long time.  I was beginning to think that there were no flim makers left who could do it.",1266624000,,1424,4.17948717948718

I had seen the quickie English-language remake Quarantine (which has the advantage of boasting a better title but otherwise is largely the same film) before I sat down to watch [*REC] but this effective piece of horror still held my interest; it's not great and has some leaps of logic that might irritate you after the film, but it also contains some good scares and I recommend it to horror fans.

3175291,3,B0017S66JI,"I had the opportunity recently to catch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quarantine/dp/B001MVYUQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quarantine</a>, the 2008 American ""re-do"" of 2007's [REC]. So I said to myself, ""why not give the original a look to see if they were on par with each other."" And [REC] was worth the look. But why do I call Quarantine a ""re-do"" instead of a ""re-make"", you ask? I'll get to that in a minute.

{REC} is a very well done Spanish film by Jaume Balaguer & Paco Plaza that kind of combines the idea of Rage virus infected maniacs from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B000VDDWEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>&nbsp;with the notion that zombies and demonic possession are nothing more than a mutated virus strain. Oh don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything here!

I mean really...both movies ultimately offer no better explanation for the origin of what's going on than any of its predecessors. I'd say that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil/dp/B000YPUFAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil</a>&nbsp;& 28 Days Later make the best attempts to suggest origins for why ""zombies"" are walking the earth, but even those leave the door wide open to prequels or sequels that change the whole idea of ""what started it all.""

So enter [REC] with a somewhat unique explanation (a la videogame-esque recording device found by the characters late in the film) of why zombies haunt this story. But before that device is found, our characters go through a Hell of being trapped in a multi-level apartment building with some pretty ghastly creatures. 99% the same story for Quarantine.

The camera work in both movies is unfortunately in the same vein as some recent films that tried to present a more realistic environment with a single hand-held camera capturing all the action, a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blair-Witch/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blair Witch</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0018QCXGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diary-of-the-Dead/dp/B001CDLARQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diary of the Dead</a>. But all that the hand-held camera work really does is annoy the living dead out of ya.

Somewhere between 2007 & 2008, little known Director John Erick Dowdle basically stole [REC], inserted American actors and released [REC] as a ""re-do"" in America under the title Quarantine. Yes...I said ""re-do"" as opposed to ""re-make"". A re-make is when a director takes an older film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it better. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original (and in most cases makes it worse). The 2008 version of Quarantine is clearly just a re-do.

I'd recommend catching one or the other for some good fun scares. There is no reason to see both.",1258761600,2,3095,6.445783132530121

I loved [REC]. There is something to be said about watching a horror movie in another language. This film is Spanish, so we get very quick dialogue, and when the situation becomes dire, we are given a frantic diatribe of pure horrific reaction. Its a simple set up really, which we should all be used to by now! The viewpoint of a camera, shaky and grainy at times, dark and barely lit at others, someone talking straight to it and sometimes behind, beside and around it. A reporter named Angela is on a show called ""While Youre Asleep"", its about what goes on the world while you are tucked up safely in your bed. Angela and her camera guy Pablo (who we never see, and I love that we never see him) go to a firehouse to interview the firemen, maybe get lucky and ride along on a call. Angela, despite the banality of the assignment, seems peppy and perky enough to hold your interest, I loved her pigtails. So a call comes in that a woman in an apartment building is injured, and they quickly jump into the firetrucks and go!

At the building, the rest of the tenants are in the downstairs lobby, and there are also two cops there as well. They go up to the ladies apartment on the first floor and find a woman who is covered in blood, and crazed out of her mind, she bites a cop and everything goes downhill from there. Apparantly she has a virus of some sort and its spread through biting, they aren't zombies, they are ""infected"". I happen to love ""infected"" Horror, because they are so much more unpredictable and give the viewers a sense of total urgency, RUN, HIDE, RUN, FIGHT! its exhilirating.

I loved this original version alot more than its american sibling because they didn't feel the need to explain everything, the audience didn't need to know EVERYTHING about the virus, where it comes from, how its spread, etc. There has to be something left to mystery and that is what good horror is about. Its a short movie but it gets the job done, there isn't a need to make it longer.

The special effects were very well done, the camera work by ""pablo"" wasn't too shaky to be unwatchable and just enough to give us that sense of watching a true documentary. Anyone who loves these types of films should definitely watch this, buy it.",1257724800,,2426,4.408482142857143

3175294,2,B0017S66JI,"After hearing this movie's title come up over and over again, often in the same breath as ""Let the Right One In,"" i expected A LOT more out of this.

Let's start with the dub-overs...
The choices in voice actors for this were absolutely atrocious. At no point in time are you able to believe the voice is coming out of the person you are seeing. An old woman seems voiced-over by some woman in her forties, a twenty-year old the same. Granted, it kills the illusion while their mouth completely doesn't match the words either and keeps moving silently, but I'd have given some allowance for that. It would certainly be better if you spoke Spanish and could watch it in its original form, but even then, I don't see my rating going above 3 stars.

As for the movie content itself, it is absolutely nowhere remotely close to the caliber of ""Let the Right One In"" - not at all. I suppose if you also enjoyed Blair Witch or other extremely low-quality movies that are not at all scary then perhaps this movie might be for you, but for anyone seeking a quality horror film that is not ""out of the box,"" not predictable or about a subject that has more than run its course, find something else. This movie does try with its Grudge-type ""boo! it's a freaky little kid face"" moments, but that is about the only time you might jump or anything (if you had been dozing off). The biggest suspense for me was waiting for the cute little girl ""star"" of the movie to get her white tank top wet so guys could see some ""omg boobies!"" (Yes, that's indicative of my perceptions of the quality of this film).

The story idea was maybe alright, but could have been a million times better. The story part seemed an afterthought to the aforementioned ""boo!"" scenes.

If the whole handheld horror genre, with films such as Cloverfield, Diary of the Dead, and Blair Witch among others don't really do it for you, [REC] won't really change your mind, but that aside, it remains that this film is one of the most effective and shocking horror films that you'll ever come across.

  A female reporter with a Spanish nightly news show regularly goes on assignment with her cameraman, taking the viewer behind the scenes of some profession or situation; in this case, a night in the life of the firefighters at a local station.  Thus the movie begins as if it were an unedited reel of this kind of documentary, complete with mistakes and start-overs that would have been excised if the tapes had ever made it to air in a conventional fashion.  Most nights the firefighters don't end up responding to an actual fire; sometimes they're called out for an animal rescue, or to assist a person who's taken a bad fall, or something else of that nature; other times the entire evening is spent at the station hanging around, playing basketball in the court, making small talk.  The prospects of the reporter, Angela (Manuela Velasco) following the crew on anything especially splashy seems low, although the firefighters themselves seem good-naturedly enthusiastic about having a young, attractive reporter in the firehouse to be interviewed by, relieving the repetiveness of most nights's routine.

  When a call comes in for assistance to a nearby apartment building where an elderly lady is apparantly either ill or injured in her apartment and unco-operative (perhaps highly confused) with the neighbors trying to coax her out, the station sends a truck out on this routine call, with Angela and her cameraman along for the ride.  Little does anyone know that this call is going to end up being anything but routine, and in the most terrifying way.  The firetruck arrives at a scene where the situation is already beginning to spin out of control; the police are there and aren't too thrilled to see reporters on the scene, and the situation with the woman upstairs is about to turn ugly.  Angela senses some kind of story in this, and instructs the cameraman to keep filming.

  Now, here's where the movie jumps its first big hurdle.  When this technique of 'recovered tape capturing everything because the character was filming it' started to be used frequently, back with movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>, it worked because it was fresh.  The reasoning of keeping the cameras going seemed to work in that one, where it was a student documentary project, and keeping the camera going somehow kept the strange happenings on somewhat familiar ground, made it slightly easier because there was something else to focus on, gave them film to go over later and try and find their way out of the woods they were increasingly lost in, etc.  But the 'camera' theme has been used a few too many times.  I liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>, but thought it would have been better if they hadn't used the videocamera theme, or, perhaps, had used it for say, half the movie and gone the rest of the time with a more conventional approach (i.e. maybe having a surviving character recount events to the authorities for that part, and use the videocamera angle for an earlier portion of the movie representing a character who doesn't survive?)  Anyway, even though this technique has lost a lot of steam, '[REC]' made it work again, and it pulled out every trick it had to to get it working.  There are times when the scene is pitch dark, and the night light on the camera's eyepiece is the only way for a character to find their way about - they can then try to guide other characters who still can't see clearly.  There are times when the camera has actually been turned off and left on the floor, and a little child comes over to play around with it, turning it on in the process, and then leaving it running where it ends up filming things nobody even intended to film.  Even the way when the cameraman is running he'll end up hitting the camera on the wall and the audio goes out for some time, until a second bump jars it back on.  All this helps [REC] completely clear the hurdle facing movies like this, which is the ""Why don't they just forget about the bloody camera and Run?"" hurdle.  Working especially on this point, Angela and several others begin to think that some kind of massive coverup is going on, and then there's a tangible reason why documenting everything is so important.

  The reason a coverup is suspected is simple: just after the abrupt, violent confrontation with the supposedly ill (but now ragingly homicidal) woman upstairs, the building is abruptly sealed off by security forces from the outside.  It's supposedly strictly a 'precaution' until health officials can arrive.  The firemen, the police, Angela and her cameraman, and the residents of the apartment building soon have more to fear than trying to figure out why the authorities are doing this, as other people - starting with a cop who was bitten by the berserk woman, start to turn the same way.  Unable to leave the building - police riflemen are actually in position to shoot if anyone tries to break out through the upstairs windows until they're covered over with some heavy barrier - the situation escalates into total pandemonium.

  Quarantine followed this movie very closely - not shot for shot all the time, but a fair bit of it - right up until the last fifteen minutes or so, which is where [REC] really distinguishes itself.  Looking for shelter and means of defence anywhere they can find it, several characters find themselves in a long-unused apartment on the top floor.  This happens in both movies, but what they find up there - and what it reveals or implies about the origin of this situation - in my opinion, [REC]'s end stage is incredibly potent and makes the movie even scarier; Quarantine's is a bit anticlimatic.  [REC]'s final act is totally horrifying and surprising on multiple levels.  Not trying to bash Quarantine, which was well done, and as for the fact that the ending was different - well, if you're not going to do Some things different, why do a remake?&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ring-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JLTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ring (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and the 2007&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-Unrated-Director-s-Cut-Widescreen-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000VKL6Z2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween - Unrated Director's Cut (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, for example, changed some things around and took different paths here and there, so they and their predecessors are similar but distinct.

But while Quarantine was a good movie, I think [REC] is definately the stronger and scarier of the pair.  Tremendous special effects, fine acting and characterization, and some of the most unnerving, unnatural Howls erupting from the bestial killers you can imagine, make this a great addition to the powerful recent crop of Spanish horror.  Incidentally, although [REC] only got its North American debut recently, [REC] 2 has already been filmed and is going to start playing overseas within the next couple of months, so we can hope it won't take as long for this one to be released worldwide.",1252886400,,8060,5.578342904019689
3175297,5,B0017S66JI,"So Rec borrow elements from The Blair Witch Project and 28 Days Later, but it actually works here.

So the news duo and the firefighters spring into action and rescue a woman who appears to be in trouble. The hellish mayhem begins as soon as the woman unexpectedly bites one of the firefighters. It's seventy-five minutes of fear, panic, and infections.

Rec is one of the scariest horror flicks I've seen. It's just as scary as Asian horror films like Ju-On: The Grudge and The Shutter.

3175300,5,B0017S66JI,"I am going to assume that, if you are reading this, you already know that this movie is the original predecessor to the recent American film Quarantine. As of this writing, I have not seen that film, so I cannot fully compare the two. However, I will note that it seems the only positive reviews of the American adaptation came from those who did not view this movie first.

That being said, if you have seen and enjoyed Quarantine, I will wager that you will like this this movie. In fact, I consider this to be one of a very few ""Must See"" horror movies from the past 10 years.

The story is simple, and has been relayed in countless other reviews here, so I will keep the synopsis short:

A TV show hostess visits a local firehouse for an evening to see what a fireman's life is like, and upon finding that it can be boring, wishes there were some sort of call to go on. Soon enough, she gets her wish, as the firemen are called to an apartment building to rescue an old woman, something the firemen view as a routine call. However, upon arriving at the building, the group finds that things are not as routine as they expected, and they are quickly sealed in until further notice due to a possible outbreak of disease, with all contact to the outside world severed. As tensions rise among the tenants, the hostess and camera man set about documenting what they feel ""the public needs to know."" What they find is more horrific than they could ever imagine...

And now for my opinion:

The scares in this movie are not your typical ""jumpers,"" meaning that they do not come from cheap musical effects while someone comes around a corner. No, the real scares here come from the dark, claustrophobic, hallways of the building and the noises coming from off camera. In short, the atmosphere of the film creates an edge-of-your-seat type of tension that slowly builds until something shocking pushes it over the top; where it begins all over again. In fact, even the things that I knew were about to happen still managed to scare me; something that is very rare these days.

The movie also doesn't resort to cheap gore effects to frighten the viewer. Now don't get me wrong, I like the red stuff just as much as the next guy, but it seems too many movies these days are just laying it on to get a reaction. This doesn't mean that there is no blood in this film. In fact, there is quite a bit of blood, but none of it is spilled without any reason or effect. The same can be said for the ""monsters"" in the film. For most of the time, they are kept just off camera (though you can hear their odd noises in the background all along), but when they reveal themselves you certainly get the effect that the filmmakers intended. And while I'm on the subject, the ""monsters"" are not zombies, as people have taken to calling them; they are people who have been infected by something that is not clearly revealed (though it is hinted at during the final climax).

The less-is-more approach used in this movie was perfect because, luckily, the directors kept the running time on the short side at a lean 73 minutes or so. This means that the movie avoids the dragging feeling that most others of it's type wind up producing (Blair Witch anyone?). Granted, the first 20 minutes or so (when the hostess is at the firehouse) are a little slow, but during that time you are basically getting to know the characters who will become your main focus, and this helps make what happens to them later all the more unpleasant. That being said, you must also keep in mind that once they get to the apartment building, the pace picks up greatly and the scares remain constant up through the last 10 minutes or so, where the situation explodes into a veritable frenzy of scares and suspense. In fact, these 10 minutes are the perfect culmination to the build-ups before them. Think of it as a roller coaster where they save the giant hill for last...

In short, I think that all horror fans should really take a chance and watch this movie. Additionally, I would strongly advise against viewing the remake beforehand as I have the feeling that it may ruin the suspense since you will know everything that is in store and I've heard that it is much less atmospheric.",1251158400,46,4237,4.472186287192756

Man, there is so much I love about this movie:
-the behind the scenes look at network t.v.
-the lean but sufficient buildup of the story
-the brief but ample characterizations
-the refusal to present quick, easy explanations
-the chaotic intensity captured with the incessant fear
-the social/political statements that are eased into the story

Brilliant and well acted Spanish Sci-fi horror thriller done in a ""Cannibal Holocaust""/""Blair Witch Project"" style of documentary-esque filmmaking through a digital camera.

3175305,4,B0017S66JI,"Rec is comparable to that of The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield with one camera filming all the action. A young female TV reporter and her cameraman are covering the night shift at the local fire station. (Yummy hot firefighters!) The fire station receives a call about an old woman trapped in her apartment. They go to the building and the old woman is bloody and out of control. She attacks one of the firefighters by biting is neck as if he is a steak. She is ravenous. They are able to take her down but can't leave the building. The police have locked up the people inside, which includes the reporter, her cameraman, some police, EMTs and the firemen who arrived on the scene first. They have been quarantined inside the building. No one has any idea what is going on until one by one the building's residents become like the old woman, enraged and hungry for human flesh.

Rec taps deeply into the viewer's fears. We see everything from the cameraman's view. He keeps filming the carnage and zombie attack that takes place in this building. Not even children are immune. There is one little girl and her mother who will be taken out if they start to show any zombie like reactions. No one can get out. If anyone tries to escape, they will be shot and killed. This virus must be contained so it doesn't go out into the world. Unfortunately those unlucky enough to be in the building are living on borrowed time.

Rec is very much like Night of the Living Dead. Where as Night of the Living Dead had people closed up in a farm house trying to stay safe from the undead trying to get in, Rec has the same idea, but the twist is that the zombies are lurking inside. The question is how to escape them and not end up dead or become one of them?

Horror movies need to evolve. It is become harder for people to enjoy them or be scared. After watching so many through the years, you become immune to the senseless murders and death. Even though Rec has great moments of gore and bloodshed, it gives us great psychological look into people and how they will react if they know all hope is lost. You come to care for these people, especially the reporter and her camera man because you see their fears grow. You don't want them to suffer and die.

The intimacy in the way Rec was filmed makes it work on so many levels. There are no big special effects or even music to set the tone. The viewer becomes part of the movie. And when it is all said and done, the viewer is the last witness and the only one to know what really happened and why.

Want to be sacred stupid? Watch Rec. If I ever am in an apartment building and somebody is foaming at the mouth, I will be running the opposite way to my own home, safe and sound.

3175306,4,B0017S66JI,"The award-winning, blockbuster Spanish horror film ""REC"" had already been remade for U.S. audiences under the nom de plume ""Quarantine"". I have seen both horror films, and I have decided to focus on reviewing the original film rather than comparing the two. Directed by Jaume Balaguero, ""REC"" is a film that adapts the first person, POV style shaky camera style that was first adapted by ""Blair Witch Project"" and later on also in ""Cloverfield"" and even Romero's ""Diary of the Dead"". The film has the B-grade movie feel, but the director made it work. After all, what better way to emulate realism with a DV camera than for the movie to look very unpolished and rough around the edges? I'll get right to the point, I enjoyed ""Quarantine"" but ""REC"" is a lot better.

A television reporter named Angela Vidal (sexy Manuela Velasco) and her cameraman, Pablo (Pablo Rosso) is covering a local fire stations in Barcelona for a TV show called ""While you're Asleep"". Things seemed very uneventful, Angela is just hanging out with some local firemen, Alex and Manu (Ferrah Terraza) until the station receives a call to an apartment building where screams have been heard. The TV team tags along with the firemen and meets up with local police officers. Once there, they find an old woman seemingly frightened and attacks one of the policemen. Suddenly, Angela, the firemen and all the tenants of the building become trapped inside the building by a Hazmat crew and they have been isolated from the outside world. Things go from bad to worse as things go out of control as the tenants become mysteriously infected that makes them violently feral. Angela and Pablo may not survive the night...

""REC"" has the type of plot that is very simple and follows established groundwork for zombie films such as the ""28 Days Later"" franchise. A supposed virus that causes violent behavior isn't really original but the film's execution is very strong in generating suspense and claustrophobia. I am not really a big fan of the shaky POV style camera work but director Balaguero does pay attention to the smallest details as to how this style should be executed. There are some gaps in the camerawork, some sound being unrecorded and the camera does take certain shots that make the viewer feel that Pablo is indeed running for his life. When it comes to terror, ""REC"" does not disappoint, the camera does feel like it is a significant part of the film rather than a gimmick.

The film's style feels very rough and edgy. (Quarantine was polished and beautified) The film looks very simple and stays close to realism. The apartment looks very normal until the lights go off--then we see how the direction takes over in the horrifying sequences. The film is nicely paced and a little short at 79 minutes but I thought this was a clever move. The film is essentially a chase film with Angela, Pablo and Manu running for their lives with no way out, the outside world have no intention of helping for fear of a pandemic. Its short runtime makes the film leaner, more intense and faster-paced to generate the scares that it never lets up. The film has the recommended doses of BLOOD and Gore which are perfectly timed and placed. As for its plot, ""REC"" downplays any solid explanations as to the source of the virus until the final act where it gives hints to the cause with a hidden laboratory. ""REC"" strongly states that ""we're not sure what is going on.."" and yes, any solid answers as to the virus will somewhat remain a mystery and lack solid closure. Is it something demonic or something biological?

Much of the film's strength would have to come from the lead characters. The film does have some rather less than impressive characters; an Asian couple, a homosexual super, an intern from a hospital, and much of their developments come from the interviews Angela performs while waiting around. These are your everyday normal folk, people we wouldn't pay attention to when we walk down the street--they look very real and a little silly, much like the folks we see everyday. Manuela Velasco looks, talks and behaves like a reporter; much of her emotions come from a reactionary performance and Velasco certainly pulls it off--the viewer will have no problems feeling sympathy towards her character.

""REC"" is the type of horror film that is smart, simple and plays on all its strengths that it manages to make the simplicity of its plot a main part of its direction; along with its rough and edgy claustrophobic atmosphere. While it does have no involving subtext and engaging characters, the film is incredibly tense, that the direction manages to bring about chills and thrills that all its suspense would come from its fast-paced build-up that uses that genuine feeling of helplessness. The final act of the film also serves up the incredible reward as you become privy to one of the freakiest images ever seen on "" make believe"" POV camera"". This Spanish horror film may not be offer anything groundbreaking, but it certainly is solid, competent and entertainingly freaky!

Oh, right; I was going to review the movie.  Sorry about that.
""REC"" is a Spanish horror film that follows the trend of films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>&nbsp;by having the entire story told through the lens of a constantly-filming camera and throws in some of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>'s mad intensity to create a film that is annoyingly familiar in execution, but still a must-see.  The execution here is fantastic and the end result is as frightening as any of the films mentioned above.

In ""REC"", a young, beautiful reporter hosting a late night show is doing a story about firefighters working the graveyard shift entitled ""While You're Asleep"".  After a meet-and-greet and a few fluff segments our heroine  Angela and her cameraman, Pablo, follow the firefighters on a routine call.  They end up inside of an apartment building where a call was placed about a disturbance.  They head upstairs to check it out and see an old woman standing motionless in the dark, her clothes bloodied.  This sort of thing seldom ends well.  After some doings transpire, the residents, firefighters, policemen, and reporter duo find that the building has been sealed off and is surrounded by police threatening deadly force.  BNC (Biological, Nuclear, and Chemical) protocol is in effect on the entire building and nobody is getting out.  Nobody seems to know what's going on.  Then the killing starts.

""REC"" is unoriginal on several levels; essentially a hodgepodge of concepts and techniques that have come before, but it is damned effective because it only steals the best.  If you didn't like the style of ""Cloverfield"" or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diary-of-the-Dead/dp/B0013D8LA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diary of the Dead</a>&nbsp;then you are unlikely to enjoy this either.  In fact, the camera might be even shakier on this one.  You'd think with a supposed pro handling the camera, the picture would be more stable.  While there is nothing approaching the deep, dark, cutting social statements of Romero's work, there is a little bit to chew on.  While interviewing residents, Angela finds one man matter-of-factly rambling about his ""Chinese"" neighbors (they're Japanese) and their disgusting eating habits while essentially implying that they must be the root cause of the rumored infection.  This is so very true to life it almost hurts.  Blaming the foreigners never gets old no matter what country you live in.  A very nice touch.  As the story unfolds and the characters start to unravel, the pace of the film picks up substantially.  The result is several minutes of pure chaos.  The mystery infection can take minutes, hours, or days to manifest symptoms, making everybody in the building a liability.  Talk about tension.

While the pacing is a bit slow at times, there are some amazing scenes.  Before I saw ""REC"", there had been only a few children in cinema history that truly frightened me. Add another to that list.  Jaw-dropping performance.  The final act is a masterpiece of suspense and intensity.  With the power cut and the police outside practically waiting for everyone inside to die, Pablo and Angela -with their camera as the only available light in the building (genius)- attempt to escape upstairs, hoping to find an attic leading outside.  What they find is a supposedly abandoned room that contains the answers to the story's mysteries and one of the most terrifying apparitions ever seen in a horror film.  There are some amazing shots, genuine scares, violence with a little gore, and plenty of screams along the way.  My God, are there screams.  I have to say that in spite of the fact that much of this had been done in previous films, I wanted more of ""REC"" and am looking forward to the sequel. Not the inevitable remake sequel.  The film is a short hour and fifteen minutes and the ending was annoyingly abrupt and ended with lame music, but hey nobody's perfect.

Either you enjoy these kinds of films or you do not.  For fans of the emerging shaky-cam horror genre, this is for you.  If you're not a fan, either skip it or take some dramamine beforehand; this one's not for the faint-hearted.  A lesson in low-budget intensity is this movie.  It is unexceptional considering what has come before, but it is executed well enough to make it well worth a watch.  Consider ""REC"" a rec.

Additional message from the soapbox, incoming...

Let's face it, people: foreign horror is kicking our tails.  It has been for a decade at least. If we want America's sleeping horror giant to wake up again, we've got to stop supporting the sub-par recycled garbage that is piling on top of it.  That means saving your cash for the films that deserve it -independent, controversial, hardcore, R-rated, uncompromising HORROR- and forsaking all others.  No Tara Reids or Paris Hiltons, no PG-13s, no Paul Andersons or Michael Bays, and no more God-cursed remakes.  Take the money for that ticket and again I implore you to go buy a DVD of the original works instead.  It'll make you a real American hero.",1245542400,87,6793,5.388625592417061

3175311,5,B0017S66JI,"To most self-respecting horror fans, the shaky web-cam style is usually a recipe for disaster.  The horror films using that style that have come in the wake of the classic Blair Witch Project film in the late 90's have mostly been panned and for good reason.  Even our beloved George Romero, a horror icon who could do no wrong, ended up disgusting most of his fans when he employed the technology to lay the only goose egg in his illustrious career, last year's dreadful ""Diary of the Dead"".  But along comes ""Rec"", a Spanish chiller that inspired the American remake ""Quarantine"".  Regardless of any discussions on the shaky-cam style of filmmaking, this is one of the better horror movies of recent years.  And that is an impressive achievement indeed.

At the beginning of ""Rec"" we follow around an attractive reporter named Angela and her colleague cameraman Pablo, who are filming segments for a weekly show they put on entitled ""While you're Asleep"".  This week's segment is to gain an inside look at the fireman profession.  They go to the station and interview firemen on the ins and outs of their profession.  Then the call comes.  A ""situation"" at an apartment complex that needs immediate rescue attention.  Angela and Pablo follow the firemen into the building and uncover a horrific situation where a woman bites off the face of a police officer.  Carnage ensues as more people become infected with this strange disease, turning them into ravenous flesh eaters.  The tenants and everyone try to escape the building, but they can't.  They have been quarantined inside by health authorities fearful that the disease will spread.

Why is ""Rec"" such a cut above all the other hand-held camera horror films?  Well, let's start off with the camera itself:  the picture is clear, of good quality and not amateurish.  For the most part it doesn't spin around nearly as much as other films like this, that can induce nausea watching it in a movie theatre.  But what mostly makes Rec a winner is its amazing sense of pacing and controlled intensity.  There are scenes so intense they left me on the edge of my seat with my jaw open in awe.  But without overdoing this, we are given breaks in between attacks, where the apartment tenants, and us the viewer, get to catch our breath.

I also didn't have trouble buying into the concept the cameraman would keep filming even though he's amidst all this carnage; him and the female newscaster have proven to us that they're intent on delivering their audience the inside scoop no matter how exploitative the contents.  I don't want to say more as to spoil the film, I'll just say this:  ""Rec"" absolutely needs to be watched if you're a horror fan.  It's incredibly intense and yes, actually scary.",1236124800,,2747,4.781316348195329
3175312,5,B0017S66JI,"First off, not to be a snob, but please ignore the other review for your own sake. Skip Quarantine completely and go straight for the original as there is simply no comparison. Jaume Balageuero's film is a masterpiece of contemporary horror. I don't want to get into the plot too much but suffice to say people are trapped in an apartment building, they don't know why they've been sealed in and amongst them, deranged zombie-like killers are going haywire; this puts all involved in a bit of a sticky wicket. You need to see the rest. REC packs an amazing ride into 70 minutes on a small budget and is proof what can be done with creativity and the power of suggestion. It is not what we see that usually scares us but what we don't and the directors knew that. Finally, the handheld nature of REC isn't annoying, it's crucial to the experience of the film. It places the viewer in the role of the mostly anonymous cameraman and provides a feeling of claustrophobia and that unsettled squirming-in-your-skin sensation that makes good horror films truly a joy to view. Don't see Quarantine. See REC, turn off the lights and enjoy the ride.",1235174400,27,1139,4.615763546798029

So I said to myself, ""why not give the original a look to see if they were on par with each other."" And [REC] was worth the look. But why do I call Quarantine a ""re-do"" instead of a ""re-make"", you ask? I'll get to that in a minute.

{REC} is a very well done Spanish film by Jaume Balaguer & Paco Plaza that kind of combines the idea of Rage virus infected maniacs from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B000VDDWEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>&nbsp;with the notion that zombies and demonic possession are nothing more than a mutated virus strain. Oh don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything here!

I mean really...both movies ultimately offer no better explanation for the origin of what's going on than any of its predecessors. I'd say that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil/dp/B000YPUFAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil</a>&nbsp;& 28 Days Later make the best attempts to suggest origins for why ""zombies"" are walking the earth, but even those leave the door wide open to prequels or sequels that change the whole idea of ""what started it all.""

So enter [REC} with a somewhat unique explanation (a la videogame-esque recording device found by the characters late in the film) of why zombies haunt this story. But before that device is found, our characters go through a Hell of being trapped in a multi-level apartment building with some pretty ghastly creatures. 99% the same story for Quarantine.

The camera work in both movies is unfortunately in the same vein as some recent films that tried to present a more realistic environment with a single hand-held camera capturing all the action, a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blair-Witch/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blair Witch</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0018QCXGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diary-of-the-Dead/dp/B001CDLARQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diary of the Dead</a>. But all that the hand-held camera work really does is annoy the living dead out of ya.

Somewhere between 2007 & 2008, little known Director John Erick Dowdle basically stole [REC], inserted American actors and released [REC} as a ""re-do"" in America under the title Quarantine. Yes...I said ""re-do"" as opposed to ""re-make"". A re-make is when a director takes an older film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it better. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original (and in most cases makes it worse). The 2008 version of Quarantine is clearly just a re-do.

3175316,5,B0017S66JI,"Simply put, Rec is one of the greatest horror films of all time.  I wanted to stand up and cheer when the end credits started to roll - it's that good. The fact that I never saw it coming probably adds to my excitement, but this is one of those rare treasures that keeps horror lovers like myself going. As we suffer through unnecessary remakes, disappointing sequels, and cookie-cutter plots, there's always that little voice deep inside our brains telling us that maybe the next film will set the cockles of our little black hearts on fire - my friends, Rec is that film. Naturally, the US had to go and create a remake (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quarantine-Ws-Dub-Sub-Ac3-Dol/dp/B001MVYUR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quarantine (Ws Dub Sub Ac3 Dol)</a>), but I urge you to get your hands on this Spanish original before you even think about spoiling the whole story by watching its American clone.

I knew absolutely nothing about this film going in - not even the title. In fact, I wasn't even sure it was a horror film when I started watching it. It starts out as a documentary featuring journalist Angela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) filming a ""while you were sleeping"" segment at a local fire station. As we watch Angela try to figure out anything interesting to do as she interviews individual firemen and walks through the station, we join her in hoping that a call will come in and add some excitement to a pretty boring night. When the call does come down, it doesn't promise much in the way of action - someone needs help getting a door open - but that changes pretty quickly once the fire and television crews arrive at the scene. Neighbors recount hearing screams from the dwelling of a strange old lady upstairs. Chaos ensues once the firemen and a policeman make their way into the apartment, quickly necessitating a dire need for an ambulance (and not just for the old lady). The film maintains the feel of a documentary throughout, as Angela's cameraman Pablo scrambles to get the most revealing of shots (successfully capturing the goriest of injuries that looked pretty damned realistic to me). That unwavering, underlying thread of realism will be a staple for everything yet to come - and there is indeed so very, very much to come.

Cue the paranoia and mutual suspicion as authorities arrive outside and begin to seal up the entire building, forbidding even the gravely injured from leaving. No one inside knows what is going on, and the authorities aren't talking - not even to the security guy struggling to maintain even a semblance of control among the motley crew of frightened neighbors, frustrated fireman, and the TV news crew filming everything that is going on. Things only get worse after a health official finally arrives - let's just say that, in this sort of situation, knowledge is not power. What follows, in the film's final half hour, is some of the most realistic, chaotic, intense, and frightening action to ever grace the big screen. Viewing everything that happens through the lens of Pablo's camera, the viewer essentially becomes another character in the film, trying to make sense of everything he is seeing or not seeing, then finding himself swept up in every instance of mad panic that sends everyone running pell-mell from one dark room to another or fighting for their very lives from the most unexpected of threats. The only times the camera stops rolling is when Pablo briefly accedes to the request of authorities to stop filming. With Angela continually barking at him to keep shooting, though, these little breaks in the action never last more than 15-20 seconds.

The entire cast is superb up and down the line. I've heard that most of the actors and actresses weren't told exactly what to expect for each hair-raising scene, thereby adding to the intensity of their reactions, but all I know for sure is that I would have had no doubts whatsoever in believing that everything I had just seen was completely real if I hadn't known it was a movie.

Get your hands on this movie any way you can.  It's a brilliantly conceived and even more brilliantly executed horror masterpiece that I now count among my favorite horror films of all time. Obviously, I can't guarantee that you will love the film as much as I do, but I can't begin to imagine how any horror fan could walk away from this film without having been deeply impressed.",1230076800,,4428,4.8582781456953645
3175317,5,B0017S66JI,"I am going to assume that, if you are reading this, you already know that this movie is the original predecessor to the recent American film Quarantine. As of this writing, I have not seen that film, so I cannot fully compare the two. However, I will note that it seems the only positive reviews of the American adaptation came from those who did not view this movie first.

That being said, if you have seen and enjoyed Quarantine, I will wager that you will like this this movie. In fact, I consider this to be one of a very few ""Must See"" horror movies from the past 10 years.

The story is simple, and has been relayed in countless other reviews here, so I will keep the synopsis short:

A TV show hostess visits a local firehouse for an evening to see what a fireman's life is like, and upon finding that it can be boring, wishes there were some sort of call to go on. Soon enough, she gets her wish, as the firemen are called to an apartment building to rescue an old woman, something the firemen view as a routine call. However, upon arriving at the building, the group finds that things are not as routine as they expected, and they are quickly sealed in until further notice due to a possible outbreak of disease, with all contact to the outside world severed. As tensions rise among the tenants, the hostess and camera man set about documenting what they feel ""the public needs to know."" What they find is more horrific than they could ever imagine...

And now for my opinion:

The scares in this movie are not your typical ""jumpers,"" meaning that they do not come from cheap musical effects while someone comes around a corner. No, the real scares here come from the dark, claustrophobic, hallways of the building and the noises coming from off camera. In short, the atmosphere of the film creates an edge-of-your-seat type of tension that slowly builds until something shocking pushes it over the top; where it begins all over again. In fact, even the things that I knew were about to happen still managed to scare me; something that is very rare these days.

The movie also doesn't resort to cheap gore effects to frighten the viewer. Now don't get me wrong, I like the red stuff just as much as the next guy, but it seems too many movies these days are just laying it on to get a reaction. This doesn't mean that there is no blood in this film. In fact, there is quite a bit of blood, but none of it is spilled without any reason or effect. The same can be said for the ""monsters"" in the film. For most of the time, they are kept just off camera (though you can hear their odd noises in the background all along), but when they reveal themselves you certainly get the effect that the filmmakers intended. And while I'm on the subject, the ""monsters"" are not zombies, as people have taken to calling them; they are people who have been infected by something that is not clearly revealed (though it is hinted at during the final climax).

The less-is-more approach used in this movie was perfect because, luckily, the directors kept the running time on the short side at a lean 73 minutes or so. This means that the movie avoids the dragging feeling that most others of it's type wind up producing (Blair Witch anyone?). Granted, the first 20 minutes or so (when the hostess is at the firehouse) are a little slow, but during that time you are basically getting to know the characters who will become your main focus, and this helps make what happens to them later all the more unpleasant. That being said, you must also keep in mind that once they get to the apartment building, the pace picks up greatly and the scares remain constant up through the last 10 minutes or so, where the situation explodes into a veritable frenzy of scares and suspense. In fact, these 10 minutes are the perfect culmination to the build-ups before them. Think of it as a roller coaster where they save the giant hill for last...

In short, I think that all horror fans should really take a chance and watch this movie. Additionally, I would strongly advise against viewing the remake beforehand as I have the feeling that it may ruin the suspense since you will know everything that is in store and I've heard that it is much less atmospheric.

I also would like to advise all those complaining that there is no Region 1 release of this movie to go out and buy a Region-Free player. Not only so they can watch this film, but because there are so many others of its caliber out there that will never make it to the States otherwise, and the bootlegs that do are usually costly and poorly copied. Seriously, they are about the same price as a regular player these days (I payed $120 for mine about 5 years ago and it still works great, which means they are probably about $70 now). Do a Google search for ""220-Electronics,"" as they have always been my preferred seller for modded players, and their units will play anything you throw at them.",1227139200,,4934,4.4611973392461195
3175318,4,B0017S66JI,"""REC"" is a Spanish horror film that follows the trend of films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>&nbsp;by having the entire story told through the lens of a constantly-filming camera and throws in some of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>'s mad intensity to create a film that is annoyingly familiar in execution, but still a must-see.  In less than a year, Hollywood has managed to bang out a remake titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quarantine/dp/B001E95ZRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quarantine</a>.  What a disgrace. A copy of a copy of a copy.  As usual, the reasons the film had to be remade for American audiences are twofold: most Americans are believed to be functionally illiterate and will therefore flee from the sight or even thought of subtitles, or they are bigots who will not pay to see a movie that isn't packed with pasty skin, blonde hair, and familiar overpaid faces.  Do me a favor, America: PROVE THEM WRONG!  Do not pay your hard-earned cash to see these useless, unimaginative, and inferior remakes; buy the real deal even if it means getting a region-free DVD player.  Support true original horror regardless of nationality and quarantine crummy remakes.

Oh, right; I had a movie review going on here.  Sorry about that.  In ""REC"", a young, beautiful reporter hosting a late night show is doing a story about firefighters working the graveyard shift entitled ""While You're Asleep"".  After a meet-and-greet and a few fluff segments our heroine  Angela and her cameraman, Pablo, follow the firefighters on a routine call.  They end up inside of an apartment building where a call was placed about a disturbance.  They head upstairs to check it out and see an old woman standing motionless in the dark, her clothes bloodied.  This sort of thing seldom ends well.  After some doings transpire, the residents, firefighters, policemen, and reporter duo find that the building has been sealed off and is surrounded by police threatening deadly force.  BNC (Biological, Nuclear, and Chemical) protocol is in effect on the entire building and nobody is getting out.  Nobody seems to know what's going on.  Then the killing starts.

""REC"" is unoriginal on several levels; essentially a hodgepodge of concepts and techniques that have come before, but it is damned effective because it only steals the best.  If you didn't like the style of ""Cloverfield"" or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diary-of-the-Dead/dp/B0013D8LA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diary of the Dead</a>&nbsp;then you are unlikely to enjoy this either.  In fact, the camera might be even shakier on this one.  You'd think with a pro handling the camera, the picture would be more stable.  While there is nothing approaching the deep, dark, cutting social statements of Romero's work, there is a little bit to chew on.  While interviewing residents, Angela finds one man matter-of-factly rambling about his ""Chinese"" neighbors (they're Japanese) and their disgusting eating habits while essentially implying that they must be the root cause of the rumored infection.  This is so very true to life it almost hurts.  Blaming the foreigners never gets old no matter what country you live in.  A very nice touch.  As the story unfolds and the characters start to unravel, the pace of the film picks up substantially.  The result is several minutes of pure chaos.  The mystery infection can take minutes, hours, or days to manifest symptoms, making everybody in the building a liability.  Talk about tension.

While the pacing is a bit slow at times, there are some amazing scenes.  Before I saw ""REC"", there had been only three children in cinema history that truly frightened me;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist/dp/B0000524CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pet-Sematary/dp/B001AGNMI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pet Sematary</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B00000K3TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Living Dead</a>.  Add another to that list.  Jaw-dropping performance.  The final act is a masterpiece of suspense and intensity.  With the power cut and the police outside practically waiting for everyone inside to die, Pablo and Angela -with their camera as the only available light in the building (genius)- attempt to escape upstairs, hoping to find an attic leading outside.  What they find is a supposedly abandoned room that contains the answers to the story's mysteries and one of the most terrifying apparitions ever seen in a horror film.  There are some amazing shots, genuine scares, violence with a little gore, and plenty of screams along the way.  My God, are there screams.  I have to say that in spite of the fact that much of this had been done in previous films, I wanted more of ""REC"".  The film is a short hour and fifteen minutes and the ending was annoyingly abrupt and ended with lame music.

Either you enjoy these kinds of films or you do not.  For fans of the emerging shaky-cam horror genre, this is for you.  If you're not a fan, either skip it or take some dramamine beforehand; this one's not for the faint-hearted.  A lesson in low-budget intensity in this movie.  It is unexceptional considering what has come before, but it is executed well enough to make it well worth a watch.  Consider ""REC"" a rec.

Message from the soapbox, incoming...

Let's face it, people: foreign horror is kicking our tails.  It has been for a decade at least. If we want America's sleeping horror giant to wake up again, we've got to stop supporting the sub-par recycled garbage that is piling on top of it.  That means saving your cash for the films that deserve it -independent, controversial, hardcore, R-rated, uncompromising HORROR- and forsaking all others.  No Tara Reids or Paris Hiltons, no PG-13s, no Paul Andersons or Michael Bays, and no more God-cursed remakes.  Take the money for that ticket and go buy a DVD of the original works instead.  It'll make you a real American hero.",1226707200,8,6609,5.9145569620253164

The last 15 minutes or so were pretty freaky, I give them that. I jumped. More than once. Which is a big deal for me. I doubt I've ever seen a creepier, chills-down-your-spine zombie, and I doubt I ever will again. But overall, this was just your average zombie flick, as others have said ""28 Days Later"" meets the ""Blair Witch Project"". I haven't seen Quarantine, so I can't compare.

3175321,3,B0017S66JI,"(Review originally written May 2008)

[REC] (Jaume Balaguero, 2007)

I immediately became concerned when I found out this was written and directed by Jaume Balaguero, whose Darkness was one of 2002's biggest disappointments, but after I was done, I didn't hate [REC] nearly as much as I'd feared I would. Think of it as Night of the Living Cloverfield and you'll get the basic idea-- Angela (Manuela Velasco), a TV host, and her cameraman are tagging along with Manu (Ferran Teraza) and Alex (David Vert), a pair of firefighters, who go to an apartment block to help a woman who's stuck in her apartment-- or so they're told. They find out the police are already at the location, and that things are a bit more complex than they were told-- the woman is a homicidal maniac, and kills one of the police officers while the camera's rolling. Soon afterwards, the disease runs rampant through the apartment building, which has been cordoned off by the police, who won't let anyone out. The entire film is as seen through the TV camera filming the segment.

It's won a ton of awards, including Best Film at this year's Fantasporto, and I have to say that as an entrant in the current rash of first-person-POV films, it does hold its own. It's easy to see why these movies are popular with filmmakers; you can get away with a lot of plot holes and bad information when everything's shot from one point of view. After all, all the good stuff usually happens outside the camera's range. (As per Cormac McCarthy and the Coen Brothers, natch.) This does tend to make some of the coincidences into a real stretch (though a TV show hostess who aspires to do hard news could be spurred into investigative journalism even when she's terrified and hysterical, I guess...), but when your plot devices are that transparent, it's more of a ""screw you and your suspension of disbelief"" to the viewer, and I have to grudgingly admit I like the attitude, in small doses. It does play better when you're already wrapped into the movie, as is the case here; Balaguero plays it off with previous endless blathering by some of the more obnoxious survivors postulating about the cause of the disease (one old racist who blames it on the Chinese is alternately hysterical and horrifying).

One does have to wonder, given the juxtaposition of the release dates, whether Balaguero and J. J. Abrams were in contact with one another at all while filming [REC] and Cloverfield. The two movies do have a great deal in common, down to the composition of some shots being almost identical (save one being set in a Spanish apartment building and one being set in New York City). It's even better when you throw in Romero's Diary of the Dead, which takes the same approach, and saw its first screening just a week after [REC]; the latter premiered at the Venice Film Festive on August 29, 2007, while the former premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on September 8, 2007. This sort of thing is not uncommon, varous directors glomming onto an idea at the same time, but it's pretty rare for all the films involved to be at least partial successes (sometimes they all suck; witness Mission to Mars and Red Planet coming out the same year, and both being entirely unwatchable dreck). In this case, I think they all do work, as long as you're simply looking for a survival-horror-action flick. I must agree with my compatriot nachtritter; if you turn your brain off and ignore all the stupid, this is a fun, fun movie, in exactly the same way Cloverfield was. It's certainly the best Balaguero film I've seen to date. ***

Postscript: needless to say, an American remake is already being shot (Quarantine, slated for release on October 10, 2008). Oh, brother.",1223596800,,3719,4.706605222734255

I was watched the streaming version June 2017, and it was not the dubbed version. I don't know if Amazon can ""fix"" all these reviews or not, but all the bad reviews are for a product that no longer exists.

This is an great Spanish-made horror film. The only caveats would be it is subtitled now, so if you're not into subtitles then you won't like this one. Also, it's mostly shot POV, so if you don't like found footage films then this might not be your cup of tea either. I don't care about those things, so I thought this was great. It's about a bunch of people who are trapped in an apartment building where the people inside are one by one turning into zombies. It starts off a little slow, but once it heats up it's worth the wait. For academics, lots of uncanny moments, plenty of Kristevian abjection, no final girl.",1497830400,3,955,4.305555555555555

3409506,1,B0017S66JI,"Again, no English dub, no watch.

I'm not 100% opposed to watching movies subtitled.  I can't tell you how many countless Anime I watched subbed back in the day due to the limitations and format constraints of the time (VHS was only able to offer one audio track).  But once DVD's were introduced (then Blu-ray, streaming, et al), I find no excuse not to offer/create multiple language tracks in any territory studios provide movies in.  I do not want to divert my eyes from the cinematography to read lines of dialog.  And for those who don't mind this, and are so good at it that it doesn't take away from their movie watching experience, great for you.  You can consider yourself better than me.  I'll stick to my dubs, thank you.  And for those who feel I'm missing out on some great films due to a limited viewpoint, take comfort.  There are more movies out there than one can watch in a lifetime, other great movies, in English, or dubbed in English, and I'll spend my time watching those instead.  I'm entitled to my own opinion and preferences, and I'll continue to support film studios who demonstrate care for my enjoyment, providing English dubs.

Amazon needs to do a better job of labeling movies that only offer English subtitles with no dub.  They do so on some, but not on others; why?  One only has to read other similar reviews on countless movies on their site to see that this frustrates many of their customers, not just me.

As for the movie, if they make an English dub, or offer one in the future, I'll watch it and adjust my rating.  Until then, the one star is for Amazon's lack of clear labeling.",1495929600,,1623,4.491467576791809

3409511,4,B0017S66JI,"Spanish director Jaume Balaguer&oacute;'s 2009 breakout scarefest manifests real claustrophobia, blinding terror and stomach churning off-kilter visuals a full 8 years after The Blair Witch Project ushered in the ultimate Fin de millenium reflection on the ghost in the machine: our technology only serves to usher us faster into the truth of the abyss--- we are the monsters in our fairy tales-- always have been, always will be.  Shaky-cams are a legitimate horror genre that is preoccupied with welding the audience's sensibilities with the protagonist's in a rat-swallowed-by-a-snake POV aesthetic. This Go-Pro Gothic approach can elevate the horror genre when used as general social commentary and also as a pointed attempt to address horror's specific touchstones: judging the unreliable narrator, distinguishing the real-life counterparts of supernatural monsters, defining good and evil within a miasmatic location that works against rationality. [REC] succeeds with some of this, but not all, unlike the classic Blair Witch.

Skewering local media hacks who work for a TV show called ""While You Sleep"" (The original title of Balaguer&oacute;'s disappointing 2012 thriller,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleep-Tight/dp/B009X5GN40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleep Tight</a>). [REC] gives the reporter and her cameraman the comeuppance of ""careful what you wish for"" and the audience a thrill ride through a haunted house. The final scenes are bladder-emptying terrifying, attributable to wobbly, wiry actor Javier Botet who became an international monster player after [REC], inhabiting every gender of Nightmare Character from female ghosts (Mama 2013, Crimson Peak 2015 & Don't Knock Twice 2016), to a warlock graphically pooped out of a Goddess's sphincter (Witching And Bitching 2013), to an incubus in The Revenant (2015).",1493510400,2,1879,6.086792452830188

3409517,5,B0017S66JI,"A ""found footage"" horror film that revs up to a chilling conclusion.  Two film students go out in search of a story and find themselves trapped in an apartment building that has been struck by a mysterious contagion too powerful to be contained.  The storyline unfolds slowly and subtly until it finally bubbles over into senseless chaos.  Because it is filmed, putatively, by a portable camera, production issues tend to become moot leaving the raw story and the characters trapped in it.  The isolation and desolation the two students experience are very visceral and, especially towards the end, terrifying.  A highly notable film that really captures the essence of fear, bewilderment and chaos.

This is a fast-paced European horror film of quality;  Manuela Velasco is captivating as the female lead, playing a host of a local TV reality, human interest late night show called While You Are Asleep.  On this episode, she and her cameraman are doing a ride-along with a night shift firefighting crew, that is if they even get a call.  They do and soon find themselves in a situation they can't cope with.  I normally am not a fan of shaky camera footage- as almost everyone who has made found footage films post-the original Blair Witch have ruined the concept and run it into the ground- but [Rec] ties the reason for it into the plot seemlessly.  Now. I'm not endorsing the sequels as I've not seen them yet, but if the same people are at the reins I'll take a chance on those, too.

As is aforementioned, this movie is dubbed, and if you cant get past the fact that the lips will not line up with the words, than so be it. Your loss. But if you can get through about ten minutes of this at the start, you won't really see lips moving anymore, and you will be able to experience the viewing of one of the greatest modern day horror films. Just to get it out there, this technically is a zombie movie, but not a typical one at all. The beginning includes an entrancing story starter and nauseatingly well done special effects, and the rest of the movie is no different. And the ending is quite possibly one of the most creepy i have ever seen, and that is really saying something. Overall, this is most likely my favorite horror film as of now, and if you can get past the not to bad dubbing, you will enjoy it immensely.",1456531200,2,939,4.222222222222222
3409572,5,B0017S66JI,"I'm ignoring the dubbing issue for now because although it is a valid issue it's not enough reason to skip this film. In fact, rather than bring down the entire rating for what is quickly becoming a classic film, I wish those who gave it one star had given it at least three so as to be more fair to every other aspect of the production. I will say that this is pretty bad dubbing as dubbing goes and a subtitled version should be at least offered in addition. In truth, most of the talking occurs at the beginning of the film, which quickly develops into a major horror-suspense-action type film that is not dependent on dialog.

This is also a ""point of view"" or ""shaky-cam"" film and many of those have a rightfully bad reputation. I recently saw one that became totally unintelligible minutes long shots of the ground by a bouncing camera. You can take this type of realism too far. But these people know what they're doing. I don't know what the technique is, but the camera is steady enough when it needs to be and shaky and disjointed enough to preserve the sense of realism that it is supposed to.

The set up is delightfully simple. In Barcelona there is a local show called ""While You Sleep"" where a female announcer and a cameraman visit various venues where people work the night shift. This night it is to a local fire station and it's a pretty slow night. So slow is it, that they have to fill time shooting hoops in the station's basketball court. Then they get a call, just the thing the TV crew is hoping for, though later on they will wish it had never come in.

In the zombie universe this is an ""Infected"" film with fast-moving zombies, the kind where just one or two can be totally lethal. The cast is totally believable and doesn't overact, the downfall of many low budget films. The action moves quickly - the whole film is only 78 minutes - and is totally believable and gripping. The director and writers managed to cut away all the frills and make one of the most intense films of the whole genre. One of their best decisions was  to stick to one single building, which avoided the overreach of many films that try to show a large scale outbreak with a small scale budget, and which also keeps the atmosphere claustrophobically tense and dangerous.

This film came from nowhere and is now often included in Top Ten lists in the zombie genre. It deserves it. The production company did an unusual thing with the sequel and subsequent sequels and changed the basic premise. I won't say any more because I don't want to spoil anything, but I thought it worth mentioning.",1456272000,,2592,4.471458773784355

3409574,3,B0017S66JI,"Though it is well cast and gets off to a great start thanks to its low budget charm, 'Rec' is ultimately a sort of meandering scare fest. But who cares? We watch these flicks for startles and sucker punches, and 'Rec' definitely delivers both. The sound editing is extraordinary. I watched on a mobile device while wearing headphones and it was pretty intense. My only major complaint isn't with the film at all, but this version of it. The overdubbing is ridiculous and takes some getting used to. Give me subtitles any day.",1456012800,,525,4.655913978494624

3409668,4,B0017S66JI,"**NO SPOILERS**

REC is one of the landmark ""found footage"" films, up there with Blair Witch, and there's a reason for it. But REC has been reviewed and discussed ad nauseum since its release, so what's the big deal? The plain and simple fact is that, in my opinion, it all comes down to the basic requirements of any great FF film: the acting is believable and the camerawork is equally (purposefully) amateurish which, combined, offer us the unique opportunity to be personally engaged in the on-screen action.

In the case of REC, we're convincingly trapped in the same apartment building as the tv crew, police, firemen, and residents. The feeling of being besieged by a mysterious attacker (in this case... well, I promised no spoilers, so you'll have to wait to see...) and unable to escape it.

This one's absolutely worth a rental, though know that you'll need to accept the film is dubbed in English, so just be ready for some moments of off-timed dialogue (though these are hardly noticable, I think it's important to note it is dubbed).

The greatest strength of this movie is that it succeeds in making you feel like you're trapped in the building with the protagonists, scared out of your mind, and you don't have the slightest idea what you're even up against, because the filmmakers ingeniously draw out the reveal as long as possible.  So many great scares, so much suspense, and filmed so well, you forget a lot of times that it's yet another found footage attempt.  This should definitely be on every horror fanatics ""must see"" list, if you haven't done so already.  Seriously, it's magnificent.
One parting note, and I cannot stress this enough - DO NOT WATCHED THE VERSION DUBBED IN ENGLISH.

I think, even if you hate it, there has to be at least one scene in either one them that will cause you to sit up in your seat. They can really hold the tension. If you haven't seen this or Quarantine, It revolves around a girl making a low budget documentary about this fire department in Barcelona. They get called out to an apartment where there is a disturbance. She goes with them still filming the whole thing. Her partner is actually filming it and since hes filming it, I think you only see him a few times in the whole movie. It mostly focuses on the girl. While the firemen and she are in the apartment building, it gets quarantined and none of them can leave. A few try to leave during the movie and get shot down. Its a typical, who is the real enemy, the zombies or the government. By the way, I shouldve said right off, its a shaky camera zombie movie. Its really gruesome in some seems too. The ending, to try not to give anything away is kind of chilling. The acting is pretty decent. This review is really for both the Spanish and American version, since they are both almost identical. Its just a good old fashioned zombie movie, with the shaky camera gimmick, which is so popular these days, thrown in to make it more appealing, but I think the movie industry over does a good thing a lot.",1402099200,,1408,4.316981132075472

However, knowing this movie had true sequels I couldn't just skip it. What I got was a movie I considered to be just as good as Quarantine and probubly would've enjoyed even more had I seen it first.

This movie's characters felt better acted (though I've actually only seen this movie dubbed) and more willing to take action then their american counterparts. This is espically prominant in Angela and the main firefighter. The people within the apartment appeared more willing to cooperate and were more trusting of each other, whereas Quarantine's residents felt very arrogent and racist in a couple spots. Also the ending was surprising to me as while it made the film less realistic, it justified the existance of the sequels and allowed this universe to be explored further.

The only gripe I have with this version is that too many characters just vanish off screen, Quarantine did a better job showing every characters fate. Definutly the superior film in almost every fashion and a good movie to enjoy.",1391558400,,1131,4.885416666666667
3409693,3,B0017S66JI,"It's not quite worth a buy rate, but it ever comes out on rental, take a few hours off and give it a look.  Even though its a found footage horror film, you have to give it a chance and keep your eyes on it to catch all the features.  It lags in places, but when it takes off it goes.  Some of the scares are haunted house, but for an era of zombie films it manages solid jump scares and creative interpretations.

Four star for any film aficionados, and the advice to either learn Spanish or get an original version with subtitles.  The formalistic use of difference in moments reflected in the change of the characters, and effects on the camera adding the fear are a bit blatant, but excellent none the less.

Film snob aside, the voice over gets a little detracting at times.  The film's calm points employ a good amount of dialog to fill the gaps, and the loss of diajetic volume and the actors natural voice robs what would otherwise be a tightly woven film.  As it is, I'm an English speaking viewer who doesn't subtitles, particularly when so much effort went into crafting the form of the film.

Rec holds a definite place on its own, and clear why it had so many spinoffs and have its shot stolen or reworked.  Problem is this is 2014: as so many films have ripped it off over the years, it has a played out feeling.  It's magic has been delineated a bit.

Zombie films are pastiche: there is little to zilch around this fact.  However, to compare this as just another Night of the Living Dead insults both films.  Instead, Rec. should be considered in among the Horror films that deal with escaping a lethal unknown in an enclosed environment.  Instead of zombies coming from all sides, the zombies are among a group of people trying to find an escape instead of keeping the zombies at bay.

Low budget: damn right it is, and proud of it.  The only thing I'd change is adding a proper Dub or good subtitles.",1390435200,,1918,4.372881355932203

The camera work is a little annoying, but I understand the whole idea of 'lost footage' type films.

Screw the public's right to receive fair and accurate coverage of the situation.  Self preservation is an instinct I take very seriously.  But other than that...

REC is definitely one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The ending is truly horrifying. It is also a really short movie, running less than 80 minutes.

The movie is filmed in ''Found Footage'' style. It is about a reporter named Angela who is doing a documentary with her cameraman Pablo about the daily routines of people who work in a fire station. Suddenly the firehouse receives a call to an apartment to help an old woman and Angela and Pablo go with them. When they get there, the old woman attacks a police officer, biting the skin off his neck. They then try to leave the building, but the police officers outside start to quarantine the building saying that there is an infection. The movie then becomes a zombie film where the characters are getting bitten one by one and turning into zombies. Near the end, we find out it is not really an infection. Angela finds a tape on the top floor, and the man on the tape talks about a girl who was possessed by an evil spirit. We find out that when you get bitten, you become possessed by this evil spirit. The man then mentions that he locked the girl in a room on the top floor, which is where Angela and Pablo are. They are then attacked by the possessed girl who is now horrifically emaciated. She screams loudly and swings a hammer at them.

The acting was more believable, the characters were more likeable, the pace was faster and the movie was just overall more enjoyable. This returns us to my original comment of how unfortunate it was that I saw QUARANTINE first. Since these films are replicas, I knew exactly what was going to happen which really took away from the suspense and tension of what should have been a great watch. Another Hollywood remake ruins a, should be, classic film. So for people who haven't seen QUARANTINE this is a 4 star flick. Otherwise, this is only 2.5 to 3 stars.",1367712000,,835,4.610738255033557

The movie feels like 'nothing much' goes on, until you get to a later part where the main guys stumble in a lurid, old basement. Then  you understand what they really got themselves into.

My conclusion: Pretty much everything about this movie is either extremely annoying or just plain old:

- Shaky Blair-Witch-esque amateur camera gimmick:
Apart from the fact that this is 100% unoriginal, it is just insanely annoying. The camera guy is supposed to be a professional, yet he manages to make even the easiest shots super-shaky while constantly zooming in and out. WHY??? I guess to make the lame story appear more dynamic?

- The female reporter protagonist:
She is CONSTANTLY screaming and panicking. Half way into the movie I was just hoping for her to die but she didn't and her hysterical screaming has pretty much ruined the movie for me.

- The story:
There's really not much to say about the story, except it's a zombie movie within a locked environment. Not a bad idea at all and a zombie movie doesn't at all need a highly complex story to be good.
The problem is, it's all been done before and there is nothing shocking, captivating surprising about REC.
If you like the shaky camera gimmick and constantly screaming women, you might like it.

The original did at least as good and possibly better job of making available a great horror movie that is both scary and claustrophobic and did so with one heck of a smaller budget.
I wonder if Hollywood remains capable of making an original good horror movie of if it has declined to the point where we HAVE to literally rob foreign film makers in making re-do's of their films? It has been quite some time since this country has made a really great horror movie with very few exceptions (Spliter, 30 Days of Night,American Psycho, a small handful of others).
Like in so many other areas, America is no longer the maker of the best of everything. Makes ya wonder if the Romans actually knew they were declining when the evidence was so apparent that indeed they were. Now with Obama dead set on Socializing our country at a faster pace than it was already on. Obama is dead set on removing all incentives to excel by his attempts to ""level the income gap"" while not rewarding hard work and sacrifice with EARNED financial incentives. Our once ""Greatest Country On Earth"" is on a MUCH steeper decline thanks to ""Barry"". We are not falling like Rome, we have already fell and merely awaiting the impact. The proof is easily seen in our ever increasing reliance on copying the works of other countries, be it movies, cars or what have you.

3409744,5,B0017S66JI,"REC (2007) is a horror thriller with an unusual perspective, as the premise is that the entire movie consists of video shot by the camera of a television crew, as they follow the activities of a fire department unit.  While on a run, things suddenly get really weird, as a group of people find themselves trapped in a building where an outbreak has occurred.

Written and directed by Paco Plaza and Jaume Balaguero, this production with Spanish as the spoken language, is completely effective and terrifying, even when following along reading subtitles.  Creatively staged and shot, the movie has a live ""realtime"" feel that captures the immediacy of the situations, and the pulse pounding excitement and fear when threats are encountered.  Subtracting the end credits, the movie has a briskly flowing runtime of about 73 minutes.

TV host Angela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) and her camera operator Pablo (Pablo Rosso) are at a fire station shooting a piece about firemen, when a call comes in and they join the unit as they go out on a call.  They enter a three storey apartment building, and together with two policemen, break into a unit where an old woman is apparently ill.  Behaving strangely, the woman bites one of the cops in the neck.  The group retreats downstairs, but when they attempt to leave the building, they find that it has been locked down, and the authorities are preventing anyone from leaving.

After one of the firemen is injured, the old woman is shot dead by Officer Joven (Jorge-Yamam Serrano), when she attacks.  Those trapped inside do attempt to get out, but find soldiers blocking their way.  With communications mysteriously knocked out, Angela is determined to record what is happening, particularly when a health inspector from disease control, enters the building to examine the wounded.  The inspector reveals that the building has been identified as the source of a disease.  When the injured become violent and escape, it triggers a chain reaction of panic and terror, that builds like a wave which finally comes crashing down at the film's sudden and shocking finish, that might leave you quivering with shock.

REC starts quite innocuously with a spirit of fun, and then suddenly plunges into a dark world full of uncertainly and immense danger.  The building becomes like a prison, where the survivors trapped inside first become victims of the disease, and once infected, join the raging hoard thirsting for blood.  As the intensity of the violence progresses, the setting becomes darker as electrical power is cut off, until the light mounted to the camera, becomes the sole source of illumination.  When that is gone, the camera's infrared viewer provides the film's final images.

The ferociousness, speed, and the propensity of the infected to suddenly pop out of the dark and tear you to shreds, makes the infected pretty frightening.  The victims have few weapons, and have little choice but to run for their lives.  It's not really believable that Pablo the cameraman would continue to shoot, when people are being attacked, or when he is running of his life, but when you are caught up in the mayhem of what seems to be real event, it rather easy to forget about those aspects of ""reality"".

While everything is seen through Pablo's camera, Angela remains in view much of the time, attempting to report what is happening, as things are going to hell.  Manuela Velasco is fantastic, giving an edgy performance that is completely convincing and believable, as her emotions and reactions are a barometer for what is happening.  The supporting cast are all also very good, including a little girl who suddenly who turns into a monster.  The writing generally keeps things very tight, with little extraneous dialog or hysterics, making REC an impactful and scary film that moves briskly, that generally remains very focused.

Creative, edgy, and to the point, REC was very well received critically, and garnered several awards in the horror community.  It is hinted at, but not explicitly stated what the infected are suffering from, however this matter is explored further in the sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/REC-2/dp/B003Q6D246/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">REC 2</a>&nbsp;(2009), which was then followed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/REC-3-Genesis/dp/B008S9D1V0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">REC 3 Genesis</a>&nbsp;(2012).

3409753,5,B0017S66JI,"Mommy!!! Holy crap, I almost lost my sh-- several times, watching this. [REC] is unsettling stuff, and terrifying and in Spanish. It certainly thunderously redeems the sub-genre of the found footage film. When you see [REC], no need then to see its less satisfying American remake, QUARANTINE, which damningly seems to be a shot-for-shot adaptation. In that lost trove of found footage film, the [REC] franchise and, more recently, CHRONICLE, set themselves apart. I'd even add CLOVERFIELD to that short list, except I don't want my feelings hurt.

Paella, Pau Gasol, and [REC] - this is Spain hooking up the rest of the world. See, when done right, the found film footage provides chills that feel more visceral and immediate. [REC] begins in humdrum manner, with a television crew deployed to a local fire station in Barcelona to do a piece on firefighters or, as the Spanish are won't to call them, ""los bomberos"" (which sounds cooler). When the firefighters on shift respond to an emergency call, the television crew accompanies them to an apartment tenement in which an elderly woman is screaming non-stop. But a routine call soon spirals out of control when the health authorities arrive to seal off the building, stranding the news team, the firefighters, policemen, and the residents with an undefined menace. But I'll define it... and SPOILER it.... old Mrs. Izquierdo is a zombie.

Here's a neat thing: Director of Photography, Pablo Rosso, not only wields the point-of-view camera himself but he also played the role of the in-movie news team's cameraman ""Pablo."" I'll tell you what, it takes some sort of steely fiber for someone to keep hoisting that camera while spooky paranormal shizzy is going down.

The plot isn't deep. The narrative is populated by stock characters. That's okay. [REC] overcomes the shackles of its tropes by dint of its vitality and nervy execution and presentation. It's rated R for ""bloody horror violence and language,"" but it also should've mentioned the film's knack for inducing nerve-jangling claustrophobia. The building which traps our characters probably looks welcoming and quaint by daylight, but at night and as seen thru the confines of a handheld camera, the environs transmogrify into these disquieting dark and cramped quarters. This frightener takes full advantage of its conceit, of this one camera providing the first person perspective. The most alarming concern becomes not about what's in front of us, but rather the thing that could be waiting to pounce on us just off-camera. That there's no soundtrack at all until the end credits roll bolsters that sense of jagged, stripped-down believability. The third act is relentless in its visceral scares. I had to turn the light on. Those bloodcurdling screams aren't coming from old Mrs. Izquierdo alone.

3409755,4,B0017S66JI,"I was unfortunate enough to watch Quarantine in theaters first, and while it's not a bad movie on it's own, it's representation of one year later remakes is a baffaling and stupid idea that Quarantine represents. If you haven't seen either really just watch the original if you can find it somewhere.

Anyways the story is pretty simple and has probably been explained countless times already on this site so I'll just skip that, but the plot and setting set up a stifling sense of claustrophobia and dread, similar to John Carpenter's The Thing. Lots of zombie movies like to squeeze the survivors between the zombie theat and the trigger happy military threat, however [REC] kept the military aspect nice and simple instead of trying to make some political point. The zombies themselves looked great too, they were drenched in blood, twitched around, and had a stark-raving mad look in their eyes while making wheezing noises. The scares themselves were good because they weren't cheap. What most American horror filmmakers seem to misunderstand is that startling the audience isn't the same as scaring them, just because your movie goes ""BOO! HAHA MADE YOU JUMP YOU MUST BE SCARED NOW"" doesn't mean it's scary. [REC] instead sets up it's atmosphere to great effect, and the zombies don't just jump out behind someone like in the Talking Dumb (a great lesson in how NOT to do zombies).

Overall [REC] is very effective because it's simplicity and it knows how to set up and maintain a great atmosphere. The ending itself is especially effective when you imagine being thrust into a blackout. A must for any zombie fan.",1332892800,,1620,4.887272727272728

The thing I was most afraid of was the ""video camera"" style POV that I read most reviews mention. I thought it was going to be grainy, and all over the place like other films of this type. I was pleasanly surpised. It's not bad at all! Although its supposed to be a raw footage type of feel, it's very easy to adjust to. It doesn't shake around the whole time giving you headaches and making the movie hard to watch. It's perfect.

I also really liked the absence of a score. Thats what made it feel authentic. Of course there's not really going to be a zombie outbreak, but no music made it feel like it really was just a news girl trying to get a story. There wasn't any ""over the top"" blood. It was just the right amount.

Bottom line, this is a really well put together movie. It's got everything you could want. There's some startling moments, there's some frightening moments.

3409759,4,B0017S66JI,"Handheld POV horror from Spain, in which a small, unwitting television crew tails a pair of firemen into the mouth of madness. The Blair Witch / Paranormal Activity thing has been done a dozen times over by now, with varying degrees of believability and success, but this is one of the better examples of what the format can do. Starting slow with a series of missed cues and tame vignettes for the camera that introduce the primary characters, (a cute minor TV personality and the two generic firemen who allow her to tag along for the evening) it slowly, deliberately adds new faces and developments, building tension until everything finally boils over in a geyser of chaos and terror. Working wonders with a small cast of unknowns, it wrings every bit of potential out of an admirably simple concept without stretching beyond its means. The storyline is equal parts quiet suspense and startling horror, masking its budgetary shortcomings with a temperamental light source and a set of large-lunged ladies. I'm not often one to take the bait and jump during this kind of flick, but even I have to admit it caught me once or twice. A solid, entertaining ball of dread that reaches and surpasses the limits of its overplayed genre, it's great material for a dark, windy night at home.",1331856000,,1285,4.792792792792793
3409760,4,B0017S66JI,"Made by up and coming Mexican filmmakers (so I read), (REC) was quickly made in Hollywood as ""Quarantine"".  While I did like that film, this original is so visceral and authentic; I do think it's better.  Certainly the acting is first rate, beginning with Manuela Velasco as the news reporter assigned to the firehouse.  The rest of the cast is excellent including some older crazy ladies who become zombie-like killers.  The ""shaky cam"" stunts are old school now thanks to ""The Blair Witch Project"" but used here it is clearly effective.  Maybe this should have won an award for best use of a dollar, err...peso in 2007.  Pretty scary stuff, even when you know it's coming.  P. S. - Skip the sequel!",1330300800,,700,4.688524590163935

3409762,5,B0017S66JI,"Rec is a gem in low budget horror flicks.  Now, after reading several other reviews and how many people complained about the main characters incessant screaming throughout the film, I can only imagine that they must have watched it overdubbed in English.  Being a native Spanish speaker, I was able to watch this film the way it was meant to.  With that said, I can't explain how great the acting is.  I don't want to spoil anything but when the events play out in that building, I felt the terror all those characters felt.  Also, many people will complain about the way the camera shakes, as the entire film is shot through the first person perspective.  It will be jumpy, but not as much as REC2 or even Cloverfield.  But having played first person shooters my entire life I have no problems with watching a film shot this way.  With a running time of an hour and fourteen minutes or so, it's really not much to endure.
Lately, I've been turning towards other countries to get my horror on and this was truly a nice catch.  I haven't seen Quarantine, which was an American remake to REC but whether or not you speak Spanish, this is a great film to watch, IN SPANISH.  So take lessons, date a foreigner, whatever.  Just try and watch this film the way it was meant to be told and you will be rewarded.  Even if you don't speak Spanish, just pretend you're watching an extended Youtube video about something bad that happened in Spain.",1321401600,,1437,4.484615384615385
3409763,4,B0017S66JI,"I never heard about [REC] until early last year when someone on a message board for 28 Days Later suggested it. I watched it a few days later, and recommended it to all of my friends who, like me, were getting bored of horror movies doing the same things these days. That's not to make [REC] sound like it's something completely original, but it certainly was a breath of fresh air in this era of torture movies like Saw, Hostel and many others. This movie does everything right, and really is one of the best 'found footage' movies I've ever seen. If you're one of the people who were disappointed with The Blair Witch Project for not showing you much to be afraid of, [REC] might be more up your alley, because it sure as heck doesn't hold back. Just keep in mind that this movie is originally in Spanish, something that a lot of reviewers apparently take personally. Reading a movie?! Preposterous! Oh the memories of working in a movie store are coming back to me...

Angela is the hostess for a show called While You're Asleep, which covers various jobs and events that take place while the people of Barcelona are sleeping. She, with her cameraman Pablo, are covering a local fire station, and things aren't very exciting. They trudge around showing the firemen doing incredible things like eating dinner, sleeping and showing off their suits. Suddenly they get an emergency call for a woman trapped in her apartment and they take off. Angela and Pablo go along with them to the building, and the few residents that live there are all waiting in the hallway. It's in the early AM hours, so tension is a bit high, especially when police have the area surrounded for some odd reason. Angela and Pablo follow a few men to the trapped woman's room, and it's obvious that something's wrong. She attacks and bites one of them, and everyone else rushes out. Things take a huge turn for the worse when the building is sealed and no one's letting the residents know what's going on. Even the special agent who's supposed to give orders is left in the dark for the most part. A virus is spreading, and in such a confined area, with limited lights and no way out...things don't look very good for our reporter.

A lot happens as soon as Angela and Pablo enter the apartment, and the movie moves at such a fast pace that you can't believe it's over when it is. There were no boring parts, all of the actors were genuine in their delivery and expressions, and the infection plot, while definitely overused now, is at least a little more interesting than every other zombie movie or game that comes out on a monthly basis. Since the movie's all filmed on Pablo's camera, you're put right into the situation, stuck with him and Angela as they try to find safety in the slim apartment building. None of his shots are pointless, and there's always something happening that he's capturing on film, moving the story along at the perfect pace. It also helps to have Manuela Velasco, who's very easy on the eyes, in nearly every shot. The characters never really make any stupid moves and react realistically, and I had a lot of sympathy for everyone here, which is rare. There's no self-centered jerk who you want to get killed off, no annoying would-be leader who makes poor decisions, none of the usual stereotypes in horror movies. Kills are relatively quick but still gruesome to see with little CG work. In fact, nearly everything here looks to be done with good ol' makeup. There's nothing bad I can say about the movie except for that I didn't care for the ending. Granted, [REC]2 came out not too long ago, but I would've liked a little more substance to how this one ended.

Yeah, there's still no US blu-ray of this movie, so I'm stuck reviewing the dvd, which isn't bad. In fact, since the movie's shot on small video cameras, it won't look much better on blu-ray anyway. The picture quality is great for what it is, but still hard to say anything bad about given the style. You get some 'errors' in the picture here and there, but they're obviously intentional. The audio's done in an effective 5.1 Surround mix, with screams and howls going on all over the place and audio 'errors' exactly where they should be when something happens to the camera or microphone. The dvd that I watched only had audio in Spanish with optional English subtitles. If you want an English dub, you'll have to wait, or just go with Quarantine (oh come on, it's the SAME MOVIE).

The special features are a bit lacking, but what's here is still nice. You get a great Making Of featurette that covers a lot of ground and answers a lot of questions regarding the story and what was happening with the virus. I loved hearing that the actors didn't get to see a lot of things until the filming began, in order to get real reactions to things. It reminded me of how no one got to see LeatherFace in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre until it came to the actor's death scenes. What better way to get a scared reaction?

[REC] is one of my favorite horror movies by far. I can see why people who loved 28 Days Later love this one as well, and am ashamed of myself for not seeing the sequel yet. If 'reading a movie' bothers you, then you can watch Quarantine and essentially get the same thing out of it. And if you're sick of movies that do nothing but try to show off cool ways of killing people, you will more than likely like this little beauty here.",1318723200,4,5426,4.5045685279187815

3409771,5,B0017S66JI,"First of all ill explain a few things:
I stumbled upon the dubbed version of this film by accident which i found the dubbing completely horrible. About 10 minutes into it i gave up and went on to search for it's original language with subtitles.
I found me a copy and saw it was a film shot in my home country's language of Spanish which was a big bonus for me.
Now i never seen Quarantine before and although i learned that Q was the American remake i still decided to watch REC first.

Let me say that there was prolly a few boring moments in the first 10 or 15 minutes of the film but after that i was locked and glued to my TV. Ive seen many horror films since the 60s and this one blew me the heck away!
Aside from the normal beginning there was not one single minute of boring or terror filled moments. The eerie and frightening atmosphere of the surroundings had a real feeling especially with the amateur camera work.
You know the rest if you read the other reviews.

From reading the reviews i suspect that most people who submitted a bad or unsatisfied low rating review have watched this film dubbed or at least with subtitles.
Now i have watched all versions and the dubbed version is absolutely horrible! It really kills this film period.
For those who didn't like watching it subtitles then you have a legit beef but there is nothing compared to this unless you understand Spanish. It really adds a whole new light to the film since reading subtitles (which isn't really that bad) is still slightly distraction and still not very accurate in translation.

Now we move on to the remake Quarantine.
Being a heavy movie fanatic for decades i can honestly say that they should of never made a remake and rather should of made a better dubbed version with the sounds and everything better emulated.
Now Quarantine was great but compared to REC it doesn't even come close. Did they really have to remake it almost shot by shot (especially with the same actors we always see becomes a huge bore)?
This is why i believe some rate down this film and say either Quarantine was better or the same since the remake is in English with no horrible dubbing to subtitles to read.

REC1 coupled with REC2 is like 28 days later, blair witch and paranormal activity with a touch of The Exorcist combined.

Going into the movie I steered clear of any substantial reviews and possible spoilers, and while watching REC I just had a feeling that this was not you're typical zombie flick, maybe it wasn't about zombies at all.

3409776,4,B0017S66JI,"REC, directed by Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza, is a 2007 Spanish horror chronicling the assignment given to reporter Angela and her cameraman Pablo, employees of a television show documenting the goings-on of Barcelona's nighttime world.  For this episode, Angela and Pablo spend the night in a fire station conducting interviews and recording any subsequent developments.  Cursory introductions and plot explanations are promptly executed before the firemen are called away with Angela/Pablo in tow to an apartment complex for a woman in distress.

I'll avoid any story specifics from here on because the horrific calamity most certainly deserves your own discovery, not mine.  I will say that there is an undead theme here, but with a unique derivative that I did appreciate.  Vague, I know, but American horror's blatant spoon-feeding of basic plots has pushed me in a foreign direction.  Because of this, I hate to give anything away about a movie that has so dutifully worked at a progressive watching experience.  Not to say REC is some sublime labyrinth of genius writing, but it is textured enough to be notable, considering the subject matter.

REC is disturbing, volatile, and there were a few scenes that really did startle me.  The end of the movie houses one of the most petrifying character situations I've seen.  For these alone, the effort here, to me, is a win.

The only problem I had was with the camera work.  I'm not unfamiliar with the shaky-camera style of filming, in fact, Blair Witch still hovers in my top-ten favorite movies of any genre.  REC hit it a little too hard, though.  Consider that in both Blair Witch and Cloverfield, the, ""protagonists"" did much better jobs keeping their cameras steady than the assumed professional in REC.  Jitters add realism to these films, but Senor Pablo exhibited grand mal seizure symptoms while standing still in a hallway.  It got old.

Aside from that, this is a groovy little rush of cheek-ripping celluloid that should absolutely be required viewing for anyone interested in first-person horror.

Well done, Spain.  I hope you'll allow my representation of the American proper so that I may apologize for our horrendous remake of your fantastic original.

Their genuine horror makes Quarantine's characters response border on the unfazed. Another amazing fact is that only a few of the actors in the film are ""legit"". Most of the performers had never acted before, but you'd never guess it since they're so believable. Another improvement over Quarantine is the reveal of the final character. A creature really.

Here is the review of the Spanish language version of this film.

REC is very scary, and it will make you jump out of your seat. - thats all.

I dare you to watch it sober, alone, late at night and in a old dark house.  In any case watching it in a very dark room with a good surround system will heighten the experience.

I was not to crazy about the way REC ends but it is daring and is probably the correct ending for this type of film.

REC deserves 5 stars for suspense and jump out of your seat scares - since that is probably all that the film makers intended then they delivered the goods. I decided to give it one star less only because I can't recommend REC to anyone but horror fans.

I would not reconmend the English language version to anyone even including horror fans - the folks on Amazon that gave REC a bad review probably didn't like subtitles.  Dont be put off by sub-titles otherwise stay away.

3409788,3,B0017S66JI,"I had the opportunity recently to catch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quarantine/dp/B001MVYUQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quarantine</a>, the 2008 American ""re-do"" of 2007's [REC]. So I said to myself, ""why not give the original a look to see if they were on par with each other."" And [REC] was worth the look. But why do I call Quarantine a ""re-do"" instead of a ""re-make"", you ask? I'll get to that in a minute.

{REC} is a very well done Spanish film by Jaume Balaguer & Paco Plaza that kind of combines the idea of Rage virus infected maniacs from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B000VDDWEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>&nbsp;with the notion that zombies and demonic possession are nothing more than a mutated virus strain. Oh don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything here!

I mean really...both movies ultimately offer no better explanation for the origin of what's going on than any of its predecessors. I'd say that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil/dp/B000YPUFAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil</a>&nbsp;& 28 Days Later make the best attempts to suggest origins for why ""zombies"" are walking the earth, but even those leave the door wide open to prequels or sequels that change the whole idea of ""what started it all.""

So enter [REC] with a somewhat unique explanation (a la videogame-esque recording device found by the characters late in the film) of why zombies haunt this story. But before that device is found, our characters go through a Hell of being trapped in a multi-level apartment building with some pretty ghastly creatures. 99% the same story for Quarantine.

The camera work in both movies is unfortunately in the same vein as some recent films that tried to present a more realistic environment with a single hand-held camera capturing all the action, a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blair-Witch/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blair Witch</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0018QCXGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diary-of-the-Dead/dp/B001CDLARQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diary of the Dead</a>. But all that the hand-held camera work really does is annoy the living dead out of ya.

Somewhere between 2007 & 2008, little known Director John Erick Dowdle basically stole [REC], inserted American actors and released [REC] as a ""re-do"" in America under the title Quarantine. Yes...I said ""re-do"" as opposed to ""re-make"". A re-make is when a director takes an older film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it better. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original (and in most cases makes it worse). The 2008 version of Quarantine is clearly just a re-do.

I'd recommend catching one or the other for some good fun scares. There is no reason to see both.",1258761600,2,3095,6.445783132530121
3409789,5,B0017S66JI,"I have to admit, I did watch the american version of this film first, Quarantine. I had heard of [REC] but couldn't get my hands on a copy. I liked Quarantine, didn't love it though.

I loved [REC]. There is something to be said about watching a horror movie in another language. This film is Spanish, so we get very quick dialogue, and when the situation becomes dire, we are given a frantic diatribe of pure horrific reaction. Its a simple set up really, which we should all be used to by now! The viewpoint of a camera, shaky and grainy at times, dark and barely lit at others, someone talking straight to it and sometimes behind, beside and around it. A reporter named Angela is on a show called ""While Youre Asleep"", its about what goes on the world while you are tucked up safely in your bed. Angela and her camera guy Pablo (who we never see, and I love that we never see him) go to a firehouse to interview the firemen, maybe get lucky and ride along on a call. Angela, despite the banality of the assignment, seems peppy and perky enough to hold your interest, I loved her pigtails. So a call comes in that a woman in an apartment building is injured, and they quickly jump into the firetrucks and go!

At the building, the rest of the tenants are in the downstairs lobby, and there are also two cops there as well. They go up to the ladies apartment on the first floor and find a woman who is covered in blood, and crazed out of her mind, she bites a cop and everything goes downhill from there. Apparantly she has a virus of some sort and its spread through biting, they aren't zombies, they are ""infected"". I happen to love ""infected"" Horror, because they are so much more unpredictable and give the viewers a sense of total urgency, RUN, HIDE, RUN, FIGHT! its exhilirating.

I loved this original version alot more than its american sibling because they didn't feel the need to explain everything, the audience didn't need to know EVERYTHING about the virus, where it comes from, how its spread, etc. There has to be something left to mystery and that is what good horror is about. Its a short movie but it gets the job done, there isn't a need to make it longer.

The special effects were very well done, the camera work by ""pablo"" wasn't too shaky to be unwatchable and just enough to give us that sense of watching a true documentary. Anyone who loves these types of films should definitely watch this, buy it.",1257724800,,2426,4.408482142857143

2. Barely over an hour long (you need to do better than an hour in my opinion if you expect me to pay full movie prices).
3. Not scary in the slightest bit. In fact you could call this boring. I found myself on the verge of nodding off at points!
4. Absolutely God awful English dub!!! I would have rather Amazon had the original with English subtitles because this dubbing was plain garbage!

3409791,2,B0017S66JI,"After hearing this movie's title come up over and over again, often in the same breath as ""Let the Right One In,"" i expected A LOT more out of this.

Let's start with the dub-overs...
The choices in voice actors for this were absolutely atrocious. At no point in time are you able to believe the voice is coming out of the person you are seeing. An old woman seems voiced-over by some woman in her forties, a twenty-year old the same. Granted, it kills the illusion while their mouth completely doesn't match the words either and keeps moving silently, but I'd have given some allowance for that. It would certainly be better if you spoke Spanish and could watch it in its original form, but even then, I don't see my rating going above 3 stars.

As for the movie content itself, it is absolutely nowhere remotely close to the caliber of ""Let the Right One In"" - not at all. I suppose if you also enjoyed Blair Witch or other extremely low-quality movies that are not at all scary then perhaps this movie might be for you, but for anyone seeking a quality horror film that is not ""out of the box,"" not predictable or about a subject that has more than run its course, find something else. This movie does try with its Grudge-type ""boo! it's a freaky little kid face"" moments, but that is about the only time you might jump or anything (if you had been dozing off). The biggest suspense for me was waiting for the cute little girl ""star"" of the movie to get her white tank top wet so guys could see some ""omg boobies!"" (Yes, that's indicative of my perceptions of the quality of this film).

The story idea was maybe alright, but could have been a million times better. The story part seemed an afterthought to the aforementioned ""boo!"" scenes.

If the whole handheld horror genre, with films such as Cloverfield, Diary of the Dead, and Blair Witch among others don't really do it for you, [REC] won't really change your mind, but that aside, it remains that this film is one of the most effective and shocking horror films that you'll ever come across.

3409793,4,B0017S66JI,"[REC] is the movie the 2008&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quarantine/dp/B001MVYUR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quarantine</a>&nbsp;was based on, and while I liked Quarantine, I feel that the original is superior.

  A female reporter with a Spanish nightly news show regularly goes on assignment with her cameraman, taking the viewer behind the scenes of some profession or situation; in this case, a night in the life of the firefighters at a local station.  Thus the movie begins as if it were an unedited reel of this kind of documentary, complete with mistakes and start-overs that would have been excised if the tapes had ever made it to air in a conventional fashion.  Most nights the firefighters don't end up responding to an actual fire; sometimes they're called out for an animal rescue, or to assist a person who's taken a bad fall, or something else of that nature; other times the entire evening is spent at the station hanging around, playing basketball in the court, making small talk.  The prospects of the reporter, Angela (Manuela Velasco) following the crew on anything especially splashy seems low, although the firefighters themselves seem good-naturedly enthusiastic about having a young, attractive reporter in the firehouse to be interviewed by, relieving the repetiveness of most nights's routine.

  When a call comes in for assistance to a nearby apartment building where an elderly lady is apparantly either ill or injured in her apartment and unco-operative (perhaps highly confused) with the neighbors trying to coax her out, the station sends a truck out on this routine call, with Angela and her cameraman along for the ride.  Little does anyone know that this call is going to end up being anything but routine, and in the most terrifying way.  The firetruck arrives at a scene where the situation is already beginning to spin out of control; the police are there and aren't too thrilled to see reporters on the scene, and the situation with the woman upstairs is about to turn ugly.  Angela senses some kind of story in this, and instructs the cameraman to keep filming.

  Now, here's where the movie jumps its first big hurdle.  When this technique of 'recovered tape capturing everything because the character was filming it' started to be used frequently, back with movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>, it worked because it was fresh.  The reasoning of keeping the cameras going seemed to work in that one, where it was a student documentary project, and keeping the camera going somehow kept the strange happenings on somewhat familiar ground, made it slightly easier because there was something else to focus on, gave them film to go over later and try and find their way out of the woods they were increasingly lost in, etc.  But the 'camera' theme has been used a few too many times.  I liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>, but thought it would have been better if they hadn't used the videocamera theme, or, perhaps, had used it for say, half the movie and gone the rest of the time with a more conventional approach (i.e. maybe having a surviving character recount events to the authorities for that part, and use the videocamera angle for an earlier portion of the movie representing a character who doesn't survive?)  Anyway, even though this technique has lost a lot of steam, '[REC]' made it work again, and it pulled out every trick it had to to get it working.  There are times when the scene is pitch dark, and the night light on the camera's eyepiece is the only way for a character to find their way about - they can then try to guide other characters who still can't see clearly.  There are times when the camera has actually been turned off and left on the floor, and a little child comes over to play around with it, turning it on in the process, and then leaving it running where it ends up filming things nobody even intended to film.  Even the way when the cameraman is running he'll end up hitting the camera on the wall and the audio goes out for some time, until a second bump jars it back on.  All this helps [REC] completely clear the hurdle facing movies like this, which is the ""Why don't they just forget about the bloody camera and Run?"" hurdle.  Working especially on this point, Angela and several others begin to think that some kind of massive coverup is going on, and then there's a tangible reason why documenting everything is so important.

  The reason a coverup is suspected is simple: just after the abrupt, violent confrontation with the supposedly ill (but now ragingly homicidal) woman upstairs, the building is abruptly sealed off by security forces from the outside.  It's supposedly strictly a 'precaution' until health officials can arrive.  The firemen, the police, Angela and her cameraman, and the residents of the apartment building soon have more to fear than trying to figure out why the authorities are doing this, as other people - starting with a cop who was bitten by the berserk woman, start to turn the same way.  Unable to leave the building - police riflemen are actually in position to shoot if anyone tries to break out through the upstairs windows until they're covered over with some heavy barrier - the situation escalates into total pandemonium.

  Quarantine followed this movie very closely - not shot for shot all the time, but a fair bit of it - right up until the last fifteen minutes or so, which is where [REC] really distinguishes itself.  Looking for shelter and means of defence anywhere they can find it, several characters find themselves in a long-unused apartment on the top floor.  This happens in both movies, but what they find up there - and what it reveals or implies about the origin of this situation - in my opinion, [REC]'s end stage is incredibly potent and makes the movie even scarier; Quarantine's is a bit anticlimatic.  [REC]'s final act is totally horrifying and surprising on multiple levels.  Not trying to bash Quarantine, which was well done, and as for the fact that the ending was different - well, if you're not going to do Some things different, why do a remake?&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ring-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JLTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ring (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and the 2007&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-Unrated-Director-s-Cut-Widescreen-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000VKL6Z2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween - Unrated Director's Cut (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, for example, changed some things around and took different paths here and there, so they and their predecessors are similar but distinct.

But while Quarantine was a good movie, I think [REC] is definately the stronger and scarier of the pair.  Tremendous special effects, fine acting and characterization, and some of the most unnerving, unnatural Howls erupting from the bestial killers you can imagine, make this a great addition to the powerful recent crop of Spanish horror.  Incidentally, although [REC] only got its North American debut recently, [REC] 2 has already been filmed and is going to start playing overseas within the next couple of months, so we can hope it won't take as long for this one to be released worldwide.",1252886400,,8060,5.578342904019689
3409794,5,B0017S66JI,"So Rec borrow elements from The Blair Witch Project and 28 Days Later, but it actually works here. This is a tight and intense Spanish horror film that should really put the American remake to shame (though I haven't seen that one, and I don't think I ever will).

So the news duo and the firefighters spring into action and rescue a woman who appears to be in trouble. The hellish mayhem begins as soon as the woman unexpectedly bites one of the firefighters. It's seventy-five minutes of fear, panic, and infections.

Rec is one of the scariest horror flicks I've seen. It's just as scary as Asian horror films like Ju-On: The Grudge and The Shutter. The hand-held camera adds to the nightmarish atmosphere in many places, while the ""jump scenes"" are pretty effective.

3409797,5,B0017S66JI,"I am going to assume that, if you are reading this, you already know that this movie is the original predecessor to the recent American film Quarantine. As of this writing, I have not seen that film, so I cannot fully compare the two. However, I will note that it seems the only positive reviews of the American adaptation came from those who did not view this movie first.

That being said, if you have seen and enjoyed Quarantine, I will wager that you will like this this movie. In fact, I consider this to be one of a very few ""Must See"" horror movies from the past 10 years.

The story is simple, and has been relayed in countless other reviews here, so I will keep the synopsis short:

A TV show hostess visits a local firehouse for an evening to see what a fireman's life is like, and upon finding that it can be boring, wishes there were some sort of call to go on. Soon enough, she gets her wish, as the firemen are called to an apartment building to rescue an old woman, something the firemen view as a routine call. However, upon arriving at the building, the group finds that things are not as routine as they expected, and they are quickly sealed in until further notice due to a possible outbreak of disease, with all contact to the outside world severed. As tensions rise among the tenants, the hostess and camera man set about documenting what they feel ""the public needs to know."" What they find is more horrific than they could ever imagine...

And now for my opinion:

The scares in this movie are not your typical ""jumpers,"" meaning that they do not come from cheap musical effects while someone comes around a corner. No, the real scares here come from the dark, claustrophobic, hallways of the building and the noises coming from off camera. In short, the atmosphere of the film creates an edge-of-your-seat type of tension that slowly builds until something shocking pushes it over the top; where it begins all over again. In fact, even the things that I knew were about to happen still managed to scare me; something that is very rare these days.

The movie also doesn't resort to cheap gore effects to frighten the viewer. Now don't get me wrong, I like the red stuff just as much as the next guy, but it seems too many movies these days are just laying it on to get a reaction. This doesn't mean that there is no blood in this film. In fact, there is quite a bit of blood, but none of it is spilled without any reason or effect. The same can be said for the ""monsters"" in the film. For most of the time, they are kept just off camera (though you can hear their odd noises in the background all along), but when they reveal themselves you certainly get the effect that the filmmakers intended. And while I'm on the subject, the ""monsters"" are not zombies, as people have taken to calling them; they are people who have been infected by something that is not clearly revealed (though it is hinted at during the final climax).

The less-is-more approach used in this movie was perfect because, luckily, the directors kept the running time on the short side at a lean 73 minutes or so. This means that the movie avoids the dragging feeling that most others of it's type wind up producing (Blair Witch anyone?). Granted, the first 20 minutes or so (when the hostess is at the firehouse) are a little slow, but during that time you are basically getting to know the characters who will become your main focus, and this helps make what happens to them later all the more unpleasant. That being said, you must also keep in mind that once they get to the apartment building, the pace picks up greatly and the scares remain constant up through the last 10 minutes or so, where the situation explodes into a veritable frenzy of scares and suspense. In fact, these 10 minutes are the perfect culmination to the build-ups before them. Think of it as a roller coaster where they save the giant hill for last...

In short, I think that all horror fans should really take a chance and watch this movie. Additionally, I would strongly advise against viewing the remake beforehand as I have the feeling that it may ruin the suspense since you will know everything that is in store and I've heard that it is much less atmospheric.",1251158400,46,4237,4.472186287192756

3409802,4,B0017S66JI,"Rec is comparable to that of The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield with one camera filming all the action. A young female TV reporter and her cameraman are covering the night shift at the local fire station. (Yummy hot firefighters!) The fire station receives a call about an old woman trapped in her apartment. They go to the building and the old woman is bloody and out of control. She attacks one of the firefighters by biting is neck as if he is a steak. She is ravenous. They are able to take her down but can't leave the building. The police have locked up the people inside, which includes the reporter, her cameraman, some police, EMTs and the firemen who arrived on the scene first. They have been quarantined inside the building. No one has any idea what is going on until one by one the building's residents become like the old woman, enraged and hungry for human flesh.

Rec taps deeply into the viewer's fears. We see everything from the cameraman's view. He keeps filming the carnage and zombie attack that takes place in this building. Not even children are immune. There is one little girl and her mother who will be taken out if they start to show any zombie like reactions. No one can get out. If anyone tries to escape, they will be shot and killed. This virus must be contained so it doesn't go out into the world. Unfortunately those unlucky enough to be in the building are living on borrowed time.

Rec is very much like Night of the Living Dead. Where as Night of the Living Dead had people closed up in a farm house trying to stay safe from the undead trying to get in, Rec has the same idea, but the twist is that the zombies are lurking inside. The question is how to escape them and not end up dead or become one of them?

Horror movies need to evolve. It is become harder for people to enjoy them or be scared. After watching so many through the years, you become immune to the senseless murders and death. Even though Rec has great moments of gore and bloodshed, it gives us great psychological look into people and how they will react if they know all hope is lost. You come to care for these people, especially the reporter and her camera man because you see their fears grow. You don't want them to suffer and die.

The intimacy in the way Rec was filmed makes it work on so many levels. There are no big special effects or even music to set the tone. The viewer becomes part of the movie. And when it is all said and done, the viewer is the last witness and the only one to know what really happened and why.

Want to be sacred stupid? Watch Rec. If I ever am in an apartment building and somebody is foaming at the mouth, I will be running the opposite way to my own home, safe and sound.

3409803,4,B0017S66JI,"The award-winning, blockbuster Spanish horror film ""REC"" had already been remade for U.S. audiences under the nom de plume ""Quarantine"". I have seen both horror films, and I have decided to focus on reviewing the original film rather than comparing the two. Directed by Jaume Balaguero, ""REC"" is a film that adapts the first person, POV style shaky camera style that was first adapted by ""Blair Witch Project"" and later on also in ""Cloverfield"" and even Romero's ""Diary of the Dead"". The film has the B-grade movie feel, but the director made it work. After all, what better way to emulate realism with a DV camera than for the movie to look very unpolished and rough around the edges? I'll get right to the point, I enjoyed ""Quarantine"" but ""REC"" is a lot better.

A television reporter named Angela Vidal (sexy Manuela Velasco) and her cameraman, Pablo (Pablo Rosso) is covering a local fire stations in Barcelona for a TV show called ""While you're Asleep"". Things seemed very uneventful, Angela is just hanging out with some local firemen, Alex and Manu (Ferrah Terraza) until the station receives a call to an apartment building where screams have been heard. The TV team tags along with the firemen and meets up with local police officers. Once there, they find an old woman seemingly frightened and attacks one of the policemen. Suddenly, Angela, the firemen and all the tenants of the building become trapped inside the building by a Hazmat crew and they have been isolated from the outside world. Things go from bad to worse as things go out of control as the tenants become mysteriously infected that makes them violently feral. Angela and Pablo may not survive the night...

""REC"" has the type of plot that is very simple and follows established groundwork for zombie films such as the ""28 Days Later"" franchise. A supposed virus that causes violent behavior isn't really original but the film's execution is very strong in generating suspense and claustrophobia. I am not really a big fan of the shaky POV style camera work but director Balaguero does pay attention to the smallest details as to how this style should be executed. There are some gaps in the camerawork, some sound being unrecorded and the camera does take certain shots that make the viewer feel that Pablo is indeed running for his life. When it comes to terror, ""REC"" does not disappoint, the camera does feel like it is a significant part of the film rather than a gimmick.

The film's style feels very rough and edgy. (Quarantine was polished and beautified) The film looks very simple and stays close to realism. The apartment looks very normal until the lights go off--then we see how the direction takes over in the horrifying sequences. The film is nicely paced and a little short at 79 minutes but I thought this was a clever move. The film is essentially a chase film with Angela, Pablo and Manu running for their lives with no way out, the outside world have no intention of helping for fear of a pandemic. Its short runtime makes the film leaner, more intense and faster-paced to generate the scares that it never lets up. The film has the recommended doses of BLOOD and Gore which are perfectly timed and placed. As for its plot, ""REC"" downplays any solid explanations as to the source of the virus until the final act where it gives hints to the cause with a hidden laboratory. ""REC"" strongly states that ""we're not sure what is going on.."" and yes, any solid answers as to the virus will somewhat remain a mystery and lack solid closure. Is it something demonic or something biological?

Much of the film's strength would have to come from the lead characters. The film does have some rather less than impressive characters; an Asian couple, a homosexual super, an intern from a hospital, and much of their developments come from the interviews Angela performs while waiting around. These are your everyday normal folk, people we wouldn't pay attention to when we walk down the street--they look very real and a little silly, much like the folks we see everyday. Manuela Velasco looks, talks and behaves like a reporter; much of her emotions come from a reactionary performance and Velasco certainly pulls it off--the viewer will have no problems feeling sympathy towards her character.

""REC"" is the type of horror film that is smart, simple and plays on all its strengths that it manages to make the simplicity of its plot a main part of its direction; along with its rough and edgy claustrophobic atmosphere. While it does have no involving subtext and engaging characters, the film is incredibly tense, that the direction manages to bring about chills and thrills that all its suspense would come from its fast-paced build-up that uses that genuine feeling of helplessness. The final act of the film also serves up the incredible reward as you become privy to one of the freakiest images ever seen on "" make believe"" POV camera"". This Spanish horror film may not be offer anything groundbreaking, but it certainly is solid, competent and entertainingly freaky!

Oh, right; I was going to review the movie.  Sorry about that.
""REC"" is a Spanish horror film that follows the trend of films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>&nbsp;by having the entire story told through the lens of a constantly-filming camera and throws in some of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>'s mad intensity to create a film that is annoyingly familiar in execution, but still a must-see.  The execution here is fantastic and the end result is as frightening as any of the films mentioned above.

In ""REC"", a young, beautiful reporter hosting a late night show is doing a story about firefighters working the graveyard shift entitled ""While You're Asleep"".  After a meet-and-greet and a few fluff segments our heroine  Angela and her cameraman, Pablo, follow the firefighters on a routine call.  They end up inside of an apartment building where a call was placed about a disturbance.  They head upstairs to check it out and see an old woman standing motionless in the dark, her clothes bloodied.  This sort of thing seldom ends well.  After some doings transpire, the residents, firefighters, policemen, and reporter duo find that the building has been sealed off and is surrounded by police threatening deadly force.  BNC (Biological, Nuclear, and Chemical) protocol is in effect on the entire building and nobody is getting out.  Nobody seems to know what's going on.  Then the killing starts.

""REC"" is unoriginal on several levels; essentially a hodgepodge of concepts and techniques that have come before, but it is damned effective because it only steals the best.  If you didn't like the style of ""Cloverfield"" or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diary-of-the-Dead/dp/B0013D8LA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diary of the Dead</a>&nbsp;then you are unlikely to enjoy this either.  In fact, the camera might be even shakier on this one.  You'd think with a supposed pro handling the camera, the picture would be more stable.  While there is nothing approaching the deep, dark, cutting social statements of Romero's work, there is a little bit to chew on.  While interviewing residents, Angela finds one man matter-of-factly rambling about his ""Chinese"" neighbors (they're Japanese) and their disgusting eating habits while essentially implying that they must be the root cause of the rumored infection.  This is so very true to life it almost hurts.  Blaming the foreigners never gets old no matter what country you live in.  A very nice touch.  As the story unfolds and the characters start to unravel, the pace of the film picks up substantially.  The result is several minutes of pure chaos.  The mystery infection can take minutes, hours, or days to manifest symptoms, making everybody in the building a liability.  Talk about tension.

While the pacing is a bit slow at times, there are some amazing scenes.  Before I saw ""REC"", there had been only a few children in cinema history that truly frightened me. Add another to that list.  Jaw-dropping performance.  The final act is a masterpiece of suspense and intensity.  With the power cut and the police outside practically waiting for everyone inside to die, Pablo and Angela -with their camera as the only available light in the building (genius)- attempt to escape upstairs, hoping to find an attic leading outside.  What they find is a supposedly abandoned room that contains the answers to the story's mysteries and one of the most terrifying apparitions ever seen in a horror film.  There are some amazing shots, genuine scares, violence with a little gore, and plenty of screams along the way.  My God, are there screams.  I have to say that in spite of the fact that much of this had been done in previous films, I wanted more of ""REC"" and am looking forward to the sequel. Not the inevitable remake sequel.  The film is a short hour and fifteen minutes and the ending was annoyingly abrupt and ended with lame music, but hey nobody's perfect.

Either you enjoy these kinds of films or you do not.  For fans of the emerging shaky-cam horror genre, this is for you.  If you're not a fan, either skip it or take some dramamine beforehand; this one's not for the faint-hearted.  A lesson in low-budget intensity is this movie.  It is unexceptional considering what has come before, but it is executed well enough to make it well worth a watch.  Consider ""REC"" a rec.

Additional message from the soapbox, incoming...

Let's face it, people: foreign horror is kicking our tails.  It has been for a decade at least. If we want America's sleeping horror giant to wake up again, we've got to stop supporting the sub-par recycled garbage that is piling on top of it.  That means saving your cash for the films that deserve it -independent, controversial, hardcore, R-rated, uncompromising HORROR- and forsaking all others.  No Tara Reids or Paris Hiltons, no PG-13s, no Paul Andersons or Michael Bays, and no more God-cursed remakes.  Take the money for that ticket and again I implore you to go buy a DVD of the original works instead.  It'll make you a real American hero.",1245542400,87,6793,5.388625592417061

3409808,5,B0017S66JI,"To most self-respecting horror fans, the shaky web-cam style is usually a recipe for disaster.  The horror films using that style that have come in the wake of the classic Blair Witch Project film in the late 90's have mostly been panned and for good reason.  Even our beloved George Romero, a horror icon who could do no wrong, ended up disgusting most of his fans when he employed the technology to lay the only goose egg in his illustrious career, last year's dreadful ""Diary of the Dead"".  But along comes ""Rec"", a Spanish chiller that inspired the American remake ""Quarantine"".  Regardless of any discussions on the shaky-cam style of filmmaking, this is one of the better horror movies of recent years.  And that is an impressive achievement indeed.

At the beginning of ""Rec"" we follow around an attractive reporter named Angela and her colleague cameraman Pablo, who are filming segments for a weekly show they put on entitled ""While you're Asleep"".  This week's segment is to gain an inside look at the fireman profession.  They go to the station and interview firemen on the ins and outs of their profession.  Then the call comes.  A ""situation"" at an apartment complex that needs immediate rescue attention.  Angela and Pablo follow the firemen into the building and uncover a horrific situation where a woman bites off the face of a police officer.  Carnage ensues as more people become infected with this strange disease, turning them into ravenous flesh eaters.  The tenants and everyone try to escape the building, but they can't.  They have been quarantined inside by health authorities fearful that the disease will spread.

Why is ""Rec"" such a cut above all the other hand-held camera horror films?  Well, let's start off with the camera itself:  the picture is clear, of good quality and not amateurish.  For the most part it doesn't spin around nearly as much as other films like this, that can induce nausea watching it in a movie theatre.  But what mostly makes Rec a winner is its amazing sense of pacing and controlled intensity.  There are scenes so intense they left me on the edge of my seat with my jaw open in awe.  But without overdoing this, we are given breaks in between attacks, where the apartment tenants, and us the viewer, get to catch our breath.

I also didn't have trouble buying into the concept the cameraman would keep filming even though he's amidst all this carnage; him and the female newscaster have proven to us that they're intent on delivering their audience the inside scoop no matter how exploitative the contents.  I don't want to say more as to spoil the film, I'll just say this:  ""Rec"" absolutely needs to be watched if you're a horror fan.  It's incredibly intense and yes, actually scary.",1236124800,,2747,4.781316348195329
3409809,5,B0017S66JI,"First off, not to be a snob, but please ignore the other review for your own sake. Skip Quarantine completely and go straight for the original as there is simply no comparison. Jaume Balageuero's film is a masterpiece of contemporary horror. I don't want to get into the plot too much but suffice to say people are trapped in an apartment building, they don't know why they've been sealed in and amongst them, deranged zombie-like killers are going haywire; this puts all involved in a bit of a sticky wicket. You need to see the rest. REC packs an amazing ride into 70 minutes on a small budget and is proof what can be done with creativity and the power of suggestion. It is not what we see that usually scares us but what we don't and the directors knew that. Finally, the handheld nature of REC isn't annoying, it's crucial to the experience of the film. It places the viewer in the role of the mostly anonymous cameraman and provides a feeling of claustrophobia and that unsettled squirming-in-your-skin sensation that makes good horror films truly a joy to view. Don't see Quarantine. See REC, turn off the lights and enjoy the ride.",1235174400,27,1139,4.615763546798029
3409810,3,B0017S66JI,"I had the opportunity last week to catch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quarantine/dp/B001MVYUQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quarantine</a>, the 2008 American ""re-do"" of 2007's [REC]. So I said to myself, ""why not give the original a look to see if they were on par with each other."" And [REC] was worth the look. But why do I call Quarantine a ""re-do"" instead of a ""re-make"", you ask? I'll get to that in a minute.

{REC} is a very well done Spanish film by Jaume Balaguer & Paco Plaza that kind of combines the idea of Rage virus infected maniacs from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B000VDDWEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>&nbsp;with the notion that zombies and demonic possession are nothing more than a mutated virus strain. Oh don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything here!

I mean really...both movies ultimately offer no better explanation for the origin of what's going on than any of its predecessors. I'd say that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil/dp/B000YPUFAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil</a>&nbsp;& 28 Days Later make the best attempts to suggest origins for why ""zombies"" are walking the earth, but even those leave the door wide open to prequels or sequels that change the whole idea of ""what started it all.""

So enter [REC} with a somewhat unique explanation (a la videogame-esque recording device found by the characters late in the film) of why zombies haunt this story. But before that device is found, our characters go through a Hell of being trapped in a multi-level apartment building with some pretty ghastly creatures. 99% the same story for Quarantine.

The camera work in both movies is unfortunately in the same vein as some recent films that tried to present a more realistic environment with a single hand-held camera capturing all the action, a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blair-Witch/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blair Witch</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0018QCXGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diary-of-the-Dead/dp/B001CDLARQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diary of the Dead</a>. But all that the hand-held camera work really does is annoy the living dead out of ya.

Somewhere between 2007 & 2008, little known Director John Erick Dowdle basically stole [REC], inserted American actors and released [REC} as a ""re-do"" in America under the title Quarantine. Yes...I said ""re-do"" as opposed to ""re-make"". A re-make is when a director takes an older film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it better. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original (and in most cases makes it worse). The 2008 version of Quarantine is clearly just a re-do.

The fact that I never saw it coming probably adds to my excitement, but this is one of those rare treasures that keeps horror lovers like myself going. As we suffer through unnecessary remakes, disappointing sequels, and cookie-cutter plots, there's always that little voice deep inside our brains telling us that maybe the next film will set the cockles of our little black hearts on fire - my friends, Rec is that film. Naturally, the US had to go and create a remake (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quarantine-Ws-Dub-Sub-Ac3-Dol/dp/B001MVYUR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quarantine (Ws Dub Sub Ac3 Dol)</a>), but I urge you to get your hands on this Spanish original before you even think about spoiling the whole story by watching its American clone.

I knew absolutely nothing about this film going in - not even the title. In fact, I wasn't even sure it was a horror film when I started watching it. It starts out as a documentary featuring journalist Angela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) filming a ""while you were sleeping"" segment at a local fire station. As we watch Angela try to figure out anything interesting to do as she interviews individual firemen and walks through the station, we join her in hoping that a call will come in and add some excitement to a pretty boring night. When the call does come down, it doesn't promise much in the way of action - someone needs help getting a door open - but that changes pretty quickly once the fire and television crews arrive at the scene. Neighbors recount hearing screams from the dwelling of a strange old lady upstairs. Chaos ensues once the firemen and a policeman make their way into the apartment, quickly necessitating a dire need for an ambulance (and not just for the old lady). The film maintains the feel of a documentary throughout, as Angela's cameraman Pablo scrambles to get the most revealing of shots (successfully capturing the goriest of injuries that looked pretty damned realistic to me). That unwavering, underlying thread of realism will be a staple for everything yet to come - and there is indeed so very, very much to come.

Cue the paranoia and mutual suspicion as authorities arrive outside and begin to seal up the entire building, forbidding even the gravely injured from leaving. No one inside knows what is going on, and the authorities aren't talking - not even to the security guy struggling to maintain even a semblance of control among the motley crew of frightened neighbors, frustrated fireman, and the TV news crew filming everything that is going on. Things only get worse after a health official finally arrives - let's just say that, in this sort of situation, knowledge is not power. What follows, in the film's final half hour, is some of the most realistic, chaotic, intense, and frightening action to ever grace the big screen. Viewing everything that happens through the lens of Pablo's camera, the viewer essentially becomes another character in the film, trying to make sense of everything he is seeing or not seeing, then finding himself swept up in every instance of mad panic that sends everyone running pell-mell from one dark room to another or fighting for their very lives from the most unexpected of threats. The only times the camera stops rolling is when Pablo briefly accedes to the request of authorities to stop filming. With Angela continually barking at him to keep shooting, though, these little breaks in the action never last more than 15-20 seconds.

The entire cast is superb up and down the line. I've heard that most of the actors and actresses weren't told exactly what to expect for each hair-raising scene, thereby adding to the intensity of their reactions, but all I know for sure is that I would have had no doubts whatsoever in believing that everything I had just seen was completely real if I hadn't known it was a movie.

Get your hands on this movie any way you can.  It's a brilliantly conceived and even more brilliantly executed horror masterpiece that I now count among my favorite horror films of all time. Obviously, I can't guarantee that you will love the film as much as I do, but I can't begin to imagine how any horror fan could walk away from this film without having been deeply impressed.",1230076800,,4428,4.8582781456953645
3409814,5,B0017S66JI,"I am going to assume that, if you are reading this, you already know that this movie is the original predecessor to the recent American film Quarantine. As of this writing, I have not seen that film, so I cannot fully compare the two. However, I will note that it seems the only positive reviews of the American adaptation came from those who did not view this movie first.

That being said, if you have seen and enjoyed Quarantine, I will wager that you will like this this movie. In fact, I consider this to be one of a very few ""Must See"" horror movies from the past 10 years.

The story is simple, and has been relayed in countless other reviews here, so I will keep the synopsis short:

A TV show hostess visits a local firehouse for an evening to see what a fireman's life is like, and upon finding that it can be boring, wishes there were some sort of call to go on. Soon enough, she gets her wish, as the firemen are called to an apartment building to rescue an old woman, something the firemen view as a routine call. However, upon arriving at the building, the group finds that things are not as routine as they expected, and they are quickly sealed in until further notice due to a possible outbreak of disease, with all contact to the outside world severed. As tensions rise among the tenants, the hostess and camera man set about documenting what they feel ""the public needs to know."" What they find is more horrific than they could ever imagine...

And now for my opinion:

The scares in this movie are not your typical ""jumpers,"" meaning that they do not come from cheap musical effects while someone comes around a corner. No, the real scares here come from the dark, claustrophobic, hallways of the building and the noises coming from off camera. In short, the atmosphere of the film creates an edge-of-your-seat type of tension that slowly builds until something shocking pushes it over the top; where it begins all over again. In fact, even the things that I knew were about to happen still managed to scare me; something that is very rare these days.

The movie also doesn't resort to cheap gore effects to frighten the viewer. Now don't get me wrong, I like the red stuff just as much as the next guy, but it seems too many movies these days are just laying it on to get a reaction. This doesn't mean that there is no blood in this film. In fact, there is quite a bit of blood, but none of it is spilled without any reason or effect. The same can be said for the ""monsters"" in the film. For most of the time, they are kept just off camera (though you can hear their odd noises in the background all along), but when they reveal themselves you certainly get the effect that the filmmakers intended. And while I'm on the subject, the ""monsters"" are not zombies, as people have taken to calling them; they are people who have been infected by something that is not clearly revealed (though it is hinted at during the final climax).

The less-is-more approach used in this movie was perfect because, luckily, the directors kept the running time on the short side at a lean 73 minutes or so. This means that the movie avoids the dragging feeling that most others of it's type wind up producing (Blair Witch anyone?). Granted, the first 20 minutes or so (when the hostess is at the firehouse) are a little slow, but during that time you are basically getting to know the characters who will become your main focus, and this helps make what happens to them later all the more unpleasant. That being said, you must also keep in mind that once they get to the apartment building, the pace picks up greatly and the scares remain constant up through the last 10 minutes or so, where the situation explodes into a veritable frenzy of scares and suspense. In fact, these 10 minutes are the perfect culmination to the build-ups before them. Think of it as a roller coaster where they save the giant hill for last...

In short, I think that all horror fans should really take a chance and watch this movie. Additionally, I would strongly advise against viewing the remake beforehand as I have the feeling that it may ruin the suspense since you will know everything that is in store and I've heard that it is much less atmospheric.

I also would like to advise all those complaining that there is no Region 1 release of this movie to go out and buy a Region-Free player. Not only so they can watch this film, but because there are so many others of its caliber out there that will never make it to the States otherwise, and the bootlegs that do are usually costly and poorly copied. Seriously, they are about the same price as a regular player these days (I payed $120 for mine about 5 years ago and it still works great, which means they are probably about $70 now). Do a Google search for ""220-Electronics,"" as they have always been my preferred seller for modded players, and their units will play anything you throw at them.",1227139200,,4934,4.4611973392461195
3409815,4,B0017S66JI,"""REC"" is a Spanish horror film that follows the trend of films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>&nbsp;by having the entire story told through the lens of a constantly-filming camera and throws in some of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>'s mad intensity to create a film that is annoyingly familiar in execution, but still a must-see.  In less than a year, Hollywood has managed to bang out a remake titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quarantine/dp/B001E95ZRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quarantine</a>.  What a disgrace. A copy of a copy of a copy.  As usual, the reasons the film had to be remade for American audiences are twofold: most Americans are believed to be functionally illiterate and will therefore flee from the sight or even thought of subtitles, or they are bigots who will not pay to see a movie that isn't packed with pasty skin, blonde hair, and familiar overpaid faces.  Do me a favor, America: PROVE THEM WRONG!  Do not pay your hard-earned cash to see these useless, unimaginative, and inferior remakes; buy the real deal even if it means getting a region-free DVD player.  Support true original horror regardless of nationality and quarantine crummy remakes.

Oh, right; I had a movie review going on here.  Sorry about that.  In ""REC"", a young, beautiful reporter hosting a late night show is doing a story about firefighters working the graveyard shift entitled ""While You're Asleep"".  After a meet-and-greet and a few fluff segments our heroine  Angela and her cameraman, Pablo, follow the firefighters on a routine call.  They end up inside of an apartment building where a call was placed about a disturbance.  They head upstairs to check it out and see an old woman standing motionless in the dark, her clothes bloodied.  This sort of thing seldom ends well.  After some doings transpire, the residents, firefighters, policemen, and reporter duo find that the building has been sealed off and is surrounded by police threatening deadly force.  BNC (Biological, Nuclear, and Chemical) protocol is in effect on the entire building and nobody is getting out.  Nobody seems to know what's going on.  Then the killing starts.

""REC"" is unoriginal on several levels; essentially a hodgepodge of concepts and techniques that have come before, but it is damned effective because it only steals the best.  If you didn't like the style of ""Cloverfield"" or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diary-of-the-Dead/dp/B0013D8LA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diary of the Dead</a>&nbsp;then you are unlikely to enjoy this either.  In fact, the camera might be even shakier on this one.  You'd think with a pro handling the camera, the picture would be more stable.  While there is nothing approaching the deep, dark, cutting social statements of Romero's work, there is a little bit to chew on.  While interviewing residents, Angela finds one man matter-of-factly rambling about his ""Chinese"" neighbors (they're Japanese) and their disgusting eating habits while essentially implying that they must be the root cause of the rumored infection.  This is so very true to life it almost hurts.  Blaming the foreigners never gets old no matter what country you live in.  A very nice touch.  As the story unfolds and the characters start to unravel, the pace of the film picks up substantially.  The result is several minutes of pure chaos.  The mystery infection can take minutes, hours, or days to manifest symptoms, making everybody in the building a liability.  Talk about tension.

While the pacing is a bit slow at times, there are some amazing scenes.  Before I saw ""REC"", there had been only three children in cinema history that truly frightened me;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist/dp/B0000524CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pet-Sematary/dp/B001AGNMI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pet Sematary</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B00000K3TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Living Dead</a>.  Add another to that list.  Jaw-dropping performance.  The final act is a masterpiece of suspense and intensity.  With the power cut and the police outside practically waiting for everyone inside to die, Pablo and Angela -with their camera as the only available light in the building (genius)- attempt to escape upstairs, hoping to find an attic leading outside.  What they find is a supposedly abandoned room that contains the answers to the story's mysteries and one of the most terrifying apparitions ever seen in a horror film.  There are some amazing shots, genuine scares, violence with a little gore, and plenty of screams along the way.  My God, are there screams.  I have to say that in spite of the fact that much of this had been done in previous films, I wanted more of ""REC"".  The film is a short hour and fifteen minutes and the ending was annoyingly abrupt and ended with lame music.

Either you enjoy these kinds of films or you do not.  For fans of the emerging shaky-cam horror genre, this is for you.  If you're not a fan, either skip it or take some dramamine beforehand; this one's not for the faint-hearted.  A lesson in low-budget intensity in this movie.  It is unexceptional considering what has come before, but it is executed well enough to make it well worth a watch.  Consider ""REC"" a rec.

Message from the soapbox, incoming...

Let's face it, people: foreign horror is kicking our tails.  It has been for a decade at least. If we want America's sleeping horror giant to wake up again, we've got to stop supporting the sub-par recycled garbage that is piling on top of it.  That means saving your cash for the films that deserve it -independent, controversial, hardcore, R-rated, uncompromising HORROR- and forsaking all others.  No Tara Reids or Paris Hiltons, no PG-13s, no Paul Andersons or Michael Bays, and no more God-cursed remakes.  Take the money for that ticket and go buy a DVD of the original works instead.  It'll make you a real American hero.",1226707200,8,6609,5.9145569620253164
3409816,5,B0017S66JI,"In addition to S. Banzhaf's advice regarding buying a cheap region-free DVD player (they're EVERYWHERE!!), I would strongly recommend signing up with Amazon.co.uk and buying this disc or any other PAL-only release from that site. As I write this, REC is selling for about $10 American with the shipping at about 6 bucks -- and they ship fast. Better yet, you even get a discount over UK customers -- something about not having to pay the VAT, whatever that is. So forget the marketplace (and eBay) sellers that are selling this for upwards of $30. They're probably getting THEIR stock from Amazon UK!",1225929600,,600,4.834951456310679
3409817,3,B0017S66JI,"I enjoyed this movie (as much as you can enjoy a gory horror flick filmed with a shaky hand-cam), but it was nowhere near the scariest movie I'd ever seen. In my book, A Tale Of Two Sisters still holds that record. I actually found most of REC to be boring, painfully predictable, and not at all scary. The last 15 minutes or so were pretty freaky, I give them that. I jumped. More than once. Which is a big deal for me. I doubt I've ever seen a creepier, chills-down-your-spine zombie, and I doubt I ever will again. But overall, this was just your average zombie flick, as others have said ""28 Days Later"" meets the ""Blair Witch Project"". I haven't seen Quarantine, so I can't compare. This is definitely worth checking out if you're a horror fan. Watch the last chapter alone in a dark room. I dare you to sleep well afterwards.",1224201600,,831,4.367741935483871
3409818,3,B0017S66JI,"(Review originally written May 2008)

[REC] (Jaume Balaguero, 2007)

I immediately became concerned when I found out this was written and directed by Jaume Balaguero, whose Darkness was one of 2002's biggest disappointments, but after I was done, I didn't hate [REC] nearly as much as I'd feared I would. Think of it as Night of the Living Cloverfield and you'll get the basic idea-- Angela (Manuela Velasco), a TV host, and her cameraman are tagging along with Manu (Ferran Teraza) and Alex (David Vert), a pair of firefighters, who go to an apartment block to help a woman who's stuck in her apartment-- or so they're told. They find out the police are already at the location, and that things are a bit more complex than they were told-- the woman is a homicidal maniac, and kills one of the police officers while the camera's rolling. Soon afterwards, the disease runs rampant through the apartment building, which has been cordoned off by the police, who won't let anyone out. The entire film is as seen through the TV camera filming the segment.

It's won a ton of awards, including Best Film at this year's Fantasporto, and I have to say that as an entrant in the current rash of first-person-POV films, it does hold its own. It's easy to see why these movies are popular with filmmakers; you can get away with a lot of plot holes and bad information when everything's shot from one point of view. After all, all the good stuff usually happens outside the camera's range. (As per Cormac McCarthy and the Coen Brothers, natch.) This does tend to make some of the coincidences into a real stretch (though a TV show hostess who aspires to do hard news could be spurred into investigative journalism even when she's terrified and hysterical, I guess...), but when your plot devices are that transparent, it's more of a ""screw you and your suspension of disbelief"" to the viewer, and I have to grudgingly admit I like the attitude, in small doses. It does play better when you're already wrapped into the movie, as is the case here; Balaguero plays it off with previous endless blathering by some of the more obnoxious survivors postulating about the cause of the disease (one old racist who blames it on the Chinese is alternately hysterical and horrifying).

One does have to wonder, given the juxtaposition of the release dates, whether Balaguero and J. J. Abrams were in contact with one another at all while filming [REC] and Cloverfield. The two movies do have a great deal in common, down to the composition of some shots being almost identical (save one being set in a Spanish apartment building and one being set in New York City). It's even better when you throw in Romero's Diary of the Dead, which takes the same approach, and saw its first screening just a week after [REC]; the latter premiered at the Venice Film Festive on August 29, 2007, while the former premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on September 8, 2007. This sort of thing is not uncommon, varous directors glomming onto an idea at the same time, but it's pretty rare for all the films involved to be at least partial successes (sometimes they all suck; witness Mission to Mars and Red Planet coming out the same year, and both being entirely unwatchable dreck). In this case, I think they all do work, as long as you're simply looking for a survival-horror-action flick. I must agree with my compatriot nachtritter; if you turn your brain off and ignore all the stupid, this is a fun, fun movie, in exactly the same way Cloverfield was. It's certainly the best Balaguero film I've seen to date. ***

Postscript: needless to say, an American remake is already being shot (Quarantine, slated for release on October 10, 2008). Oh, brother.",1223596800,,3719,4.706605222734255
