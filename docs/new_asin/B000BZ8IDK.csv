2449981,4,B000BZ8IDK,"This DVD contains the final episode of season 1 Episode 25 which is by far one of the best episodes in the series. An excellent high point on which it leaves off. Sadly, the following three episodes do slow down a little.

Episode 26 seems to be more or less little more then character development for Winry as well as introducing a character, who while in the Manga was recurring, only shows once in the anime and not all that important. There are a few things happening back in Central though that are interesting.

Episode 27 and 28 deal with a few new characters, Edward and Alphonses old Alchemy teacher and company. The teacher story arc is interesting later on but the start episodes while important seem a little stretched out. Both episodes are primarily character development for Ed, Al, and Izumi (teacher). However they are done better then 26.

Both episodes, much akin to the starting episodes of the anime, deal with flashbacks into the past of Ed and Al when they first met and learned with Izumi. Episode 28 leaves off on the real start of the interesting part of the Teacher story arc. However well have to wait till next DVD.

All in all this DVD has one excellent episode, and while the others are by no means bad, they pale in comparison to the first episode on this disc.",1133740800,5,1293,4.536480686695279

2449983,4,B000BZ8IDK,The story is beyond intriguing!  The homonculi reveal their dastardly plans.  Scar is on the move again.  The Elrics are still searching for a stone.  But who is Dante and how is she connected to Ed and Al's father?  Why is Izumi so protective of that strange boy?  And why is he so obsessed with Ed?

2449984,5,B000BZ8IDK,"If you have been following the series up to now, there is absolutely no reason that you shouldn't pick up this volume IMMEDIATELY! This is one of the gut-wrenching, side-splitting, and heartbreaking volumes of the series yet...including a major character death, a reunion of students and teacher, and some fun flashbacks that do a lot to explain the plot of the series, which continues to become extremely convoluted...(you might want to grab a sheet of paper and take notes.)

Animation is, as always, superb, even though not a lot of action takes place. Unlike certain other animes--cough DBZ cough--this is a good thing, because the voice acting is superb. All the characters have emotional depth, and they take appropriate pauses in their dialogue, instead of plowing through it in one breath. Especially good are Ed and Al, Izumi, and Lt. Hawkeye.

I was a little disappointed by a lack of homunculi sightings in this one (save the major character death episode), but that's just a minor, juvenile gripe. This is so excellent that there really isn't anything to say but ""go buy this NOW.""",1140912000,,1093,4.934782608695652
2449985,5,B000BZ8IDK,"The latest installment of FMA cmpleteley blew my mind.  I had no idea what was coming until it hit me.  The story line is so driving, itsgreat.  I would definetly buy it if I had the chance again.",1140566400,,196,4.105263157894737
2449986,5,B000BZ8IDK,"If you watch it in English, it might not be as good as in Japanese, this is not to deminish the voices or efforts of the cast for the English version. But, frankly, if the writing doesn't make any sense in English, then that's because of the difference in the whole idea of cultural difference between U.S. culture and Japanese culture. That's why when a character is just yelling out it won't make any sense in a different-than-its-original language.

Great episodes, great show... kinda sad at the end with Hughes...

2449987,5,B000BZ8IDK,"To correct C.W. Fitch, most animes do not have a season of 13 episodes. There is a HUGE amount of variance. In the case of FMA, there were two seasons of 26 episodes, which aired from October 2003 to October 2004. Anime series frequently have multiple openings and endings for each season. Sometimes there is a different op/ed for each episode. An op/ed most definitely does NOT always mark a new season.

FMA is a great series. I enjoyed watching it when it first came out, and now am enjoying the dvds, despite the poor translation and grammar of the subtitles.",1138492800,3,563,4.574257425742574
2449988,5,B000BZ8IDK,"Fullmetal Alchemist continues to amaze and astound as one of the most popular and, quite frankly, best anime series in recent years.  With its mix of technology and magic in the story, the emotion of the characters, and the richness and deepness of the story itself, anime fans find themselves marking their collective calendars when they find out a new volume is on the way.  I include myself in that group, and couldn't wait to rip off the cellophane on this chapter and throw it into my PS2 when I picked it up.

In this volume, which at the halfway point transcends into the third season of episodes.  (I'll correct the previous reviewers here: Yes, you read that right, THIRD--officially, a ""season"" of a TV series is 13 episodes, give or take a couple.  Usually in an anime series, a new season is signified by a new opening/closing theme and animation.  In this volume, that occurs for the third time.  So there you go.)  Anyway, getting back to the main point, there is a good point in the fact that with a new season, the story tends to slow down a bit, which it does here.  Only after an amazing ending to Season 2, though, does that happen.  Lt. Maes Hughes continues his investigation into the Homunculi and the events surrounding Lab Five, and comes dangerously close to the truth.  Meanwhile, Ed and Al have scampered off again without telling the State, this time in search of a way to restore their bodies without using the Philosopher's Stone.  Noble of them, considering the damage said Stone does to everything around it.  At this point, they've reached a new found maturity, and it shows in spades in the two boys.  Their galpal Winry totes along, sensing a great opportunity to shop and find some rare machine goods.  The group happens across another young girl sporting similar automail (one arm and both legs), and meet another quite talented machinist.  All this adventuring, though, only serves to worry their boss, Col. Roy Mustang, who's in the middle of working his way to the top of the State ""food chain"".  Ed and Al also meet up with their old alchemy teacher, Izumi, who ends up having a little more to learn the young'uns (mostly through multiple beatings).  This exchange is both hilarious and insightful, and Ed and Al come away from the reunion all the wiser.  Then there's that strange little long-haired boy on the island...

The ending of the second season is by far the most powerful scenery in the whole series up to now.  The English voice cast painstakingly worked to ensure maximum heart-wrenchings (as you'll find out if you listen to the commentary), and boy, did it work.  I've never really gotten emotional toward an anime series, but that sequence was rattling.  Funimation has put together a completely superb talent pool to bring true dubbing quality to this series, and it deserves no less.  Yes, the action slows down in this volume, but with a story this deep (and seemingly with no end in sight), once a while you've just gotta endure a little plot development here and there.  (Just look at Dragon Ball Z for the most extreme example of this.)  Patience, however, is guaranteed reward in this series.  You won't be disappointed.  The animation quality doesn't peter off a bit, either.  Every episode is as well-drawn as the last.  The soundtrack is powerful, complete with western-themed piano, symphony, and throbbing drums to set off every emotion and setting.  This is one of the few series out there that gets everything right: solid action, gripping characters, a well-paced story, and sight & sound quality unheard of in made-for-TV anime.

Extras include commentary on Episode 25 (from Roy's, Hughes', and Havoc's voice actors), which is informative and funny; of course the obligatory ""clean"" openings/closings (without credits on the screen); a full episode of ""Mr. Stain in Junk Alley"" (CGI comedy series coming soon); and previews of coming attractions.

Again, the only drawback to the disc setup is the mandatory previews you have to sit through before the menu even comes up; this time one for ""Mr. Stain"" and one for ""Baki the Grappler"".  REALLY could've done without that because neither preview is very interest-generating.  Other than that, the menu and setup are flawless.

If you've followed the series up to now, you'll definitely want to keep on truckin' through after this volume.  It doesn't let up at all save for some flashbacks and story development, and again, contains one of the most gripping scenes in recent anime history.  Get it NOW!",1137196800,16,4523,4.825974025974026
2449989,5,B000BZ8IDK,"Many people have criticized Volume 7 (episodes 25-28), saying they are some of the most boring episodes of the series. This might be, but you have to look at the big picture. Episode 25 is the Season 2 finale, and is probably one of the most dramatic shows in the series. After that, a couple cheesecake Season 3 opener shows are always going to look bad. They do, however, start to bring in some important new characters, new revelations on the secret of Ed's alchemy, and begin a greater plotline that extends all the way to the end of the series. Just bare with it, enjoy the shows for what they're worth, and you'll be rewarded once things start to pick up again in the next volume.",1137196800,4,686,4.409448818897638
2449990,5,B000BZ8IDK,"Okay, let's start. This volume adds the interesting plot point of sensei Izumi (teacher in english), who has been mentioned many times by the Elric brothers. If you are going to buy this DVD to see more fighting, just borrow it from a friend. However, to a serious fan, this DVD explains some much needed plot points. I'm not sure, but this may start to introduce the Alchemist's Gate....however, I'll have more on that in later volumes.",1137196800,2,437,4.688311688311688
2449991,5,B000BZ8IDK,"While this set isn't FMA's greatest, it does set ground work on themes and other reaccuring events for the heroes in their second season. Part of the reason FMA is loved today is because of it's great use of ongoing plotlines, while one maybe wrapping up, another is just starting to be explained.

 Al and Ed are just as great as in pasted episodes, and show the stuff that they have learned in their first season. The whole teacher dynamic is also important to the show, to explain how these two did get to be as talented as they are. FMA has become the most watch anime on adult swim, and with good reason, these stories are about themes that everyone has to go through in there own lives and while we have almost a 100% chance of even getting bonded to a suit of armor, we can easily relate to the characters and there fight to just be whole.",1135900800,5,846,4.28125

8094743,5,B000BZ8IDK,"Episodes 25, 26, 27, and 28 of the original version of Fullmetal Alchemist. If your collecting the series these are very nice single releases but its probably far more realistic to just buy the two box set releases rather than a bunch of singles, they both even out to about the same depending on where your buying the singles(and also if your buying new or used) but its most likely that its cheaper to buy the boxsets.",1410134400,,420,4.467532467532467

8094745,5,B000BZ8IDK,"I would thoroughly recommend the full series to anyone! I'm not a big anime fan myself but after receiving the first three bolunes my thirst for this series became intolerable. I LOVED it!

8094746,5,B000BZ8IDK,"FMA now has the distinction of being one of maybe three anime and/or cartoons that have made me shed real tears (who didn't cry when Mufasa died?). This is one sad volume, starting with the very first episode and promising only to get sadder with the next volume. While I won't say who dies so as not to spoil this volume for anyone, I will say that it was a key player and definitely one of the more lovable ones.

After that, the story follows the Elric brothers as they are once again exploring their past. The boys leave Central to find more clues on the stone, but on the way they meet a person from their past who drags them away from the quest in a forceful way. Now, the boys must find a way to explain to their old alchemy teacher how they ended up the way they are, while also going through a brutal refresher course. Between all of this, Ed finds the importance of auto-mail; Scar kills; and Colonel Roy Mustang learns to cry.

Definitely the most powerful volume to date, I'm completely shocked that this series can keep getting better. New characters are introduced every other episode, and every one is so distinctive that they become instantly memorable. I can't stress this enough: Fullmetal Alchemist is the best anime series to come out since Cowboy Bebop, and any fan of anime who isn't collecting this series should hurry up and get with the program. You're missing out on something great.",1151798400,3,1409,4.52156862745098
