In Hot pursuit
The Big Wheel
Bail Out
The Fast and the Furious
Night of the sharks
Deadly Affair
Cross Mission
Cape Town Affair
Choppers
Beyond Justice

The other movies individually sell for at least $5 apiece so the value is there, the CIA movie sells for $13. But, if you own other mill creek sets, you know they duplicate and they have here big time. Also, if you own other Mill Creek sets, you probably have 10 of these movies. If you can get this set for $5 buy it, if not wait, it will go on sale.
