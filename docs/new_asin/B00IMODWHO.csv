8643382,5,B00IMODWHO,"Movie arrived super, super fast.  The transfer was nice, and I did like that the subtitles were available in both white and yellow.  Now, onto the film, which I think is so oddly transfixing.  The movie itself, was brought to my attention when it was mentioned, not reviewed, just mentioned, on ""Hello! This Is The Doomed Show"" podcast.  First off, if you do plan on watching the film, DO NOT read anything about the film before watching it.  It should be watched spoiler free to be enjoyed.  But then, upon completion, watch the movie a second time with the knowledge that you now have.  I love, love, love this film.",1527638400,,618,4.5636363636363635
