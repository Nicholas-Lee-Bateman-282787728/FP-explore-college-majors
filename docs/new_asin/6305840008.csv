1082742,4,6305840008,"Real slaughterhouse footage and scenes of dirty urban slums set the tone for this stark and obsessive Spanish horror flick. A slaughterhouse employee named Marcos gets attacked by a cabdriver who takes objection when he and his girlfriend are making out in the back seat, and Marcos kills him. This sets in motion a week of killing, first to cover up the cabdriver's death, and afterward to keep the bodies piling up in his bedroom a secret. He tries to dispose of the body parts at the slaughterhouse, but he can't do it fast enough and soon the stench of the corpses is becoming a problem, and Marcos slips further and further into madness.

Weird, pseudo-sleazy film that works even though it doesn't even attempt to live up to its title - there's *no cannibalism*. The dubbing is pretty bad and there's not much gore (most of the nastiness happens off-screen), but there's plenty of atmosphere and a sense of desperation builds in Marco's apartment. The DVD looks great except there is a little ""film flicker"" in a few scenes - nothing bad though. It's not big on splatter, but it's still worth a look for Eurohorror fans.",1294617600,,1126,4.686868686868687
1082743,3,6305840008,"A chance argument during a cab ride leaves the cab driver dead at the hands of a poor meat packer. After nearly getting away with murder, Marcos decides the only way to ensure his freedom is to kill the girlfriend that was with him that night and anyone else that comes too close to the truth that is collecting flies in his guest bedroom. CANNIBAL MAN is an extremely misleading title, referencing a single scene where the character uses the meat grinder at work to dispose of the bodies, only to accidentally find himself eating the end product at a local pub. It is cleanly shot, with de la Iglesia implementing many of the same camera and stylistic devices as the Italians. Considering there is only a little gore, the film relies entirely on the strength of its performances to build and maintain a steady tension. Thankfully, Vincent Parra and his surrounding cast portray sincere and empathetic characters even in their darker moments. Marcus is a reluctant killer that kills out of necessity and not enjoyment. This makes his actions that much more disturbing and personal, while his resolution to feed the meat to the grinder is both vile and disgusting. De la Iglesia sets a somber mood through the grim slaughterhouse floor and barren Spanish desert, externalizing Marcos' lonesome and futile struggle to avoid the discovery of his crimes. CANNIBAL MAN is a sad character study sharing much more in common with CHRISTMAS EVIL or THE DRILLER KILLER than the similarly titled Exploitation films.

1082745,2,6305840008,"After having watched a number of movies listed on the original video nasties, I can't help but wonder why a number of those gruesome movies were even put on there. One of those are ""Cannibal Man."" ""Cannibal Man"" is a Spanish serial killer flick that has nothing to do with cannibalism and also has very little gore in it. The goriest part of the entire movie (and most interesting) is in the beginning when there is a few scenes from a slaughterhouse of a number of cows being butchered. After that, the rest of the movie is a 90-plus minute borefest in which a man who works in a slaughterhouse and lives in the slums slowly loses his grasp on reality and quickly spirals into a madness from which he cannot escape while all the while trying to pretend that all is normal. Basically, ""Cannibal Man"" consists of a very simple plot in which the main character accidentally kills a taxi cab driver with a rock while the driver was busy assaulting his girlfriend. Later, he reasonably fears that his girlfriend is going to turn him in to the police so violently strangles her to death. A little later, his brother threatens to turn him into the police so he kills him too, but this time he pounds his sibling's head in with a large monkey wrench. He then kills his brother's unsuspecting fiancee, her father, (the father's death is probably the most interesting throughout the entire movie), then proceeds to kill a nosy older woman after he finishes giving her the ""ole in and out."" Interspersed between all these scenes is some really disturbing gay erotica between the main character and his homosexual neighbor. Thats pretty much the movie, only it drags on much longer than my concise summary of it. Probably not worth renting, certainly not worth buying, I suggest checking out ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" over this ""video nasty"" that isn't so nasty after all any day.",1131062400,2,1880,4.6656626506024095
1082746,1,6305840008,"The movie cannibal man is not like it says.  First off, he isn't a cannibal at all.  As a lover of cannibal films this is far from one. Even the description on the back is misleading.  He works at a meat plant where he makes soup, wow how convenient on disposing of bodies.  He does kill some people, but the scenes where people die aren't that graphic so that wasn't worth my time and my friends who were there with me watching it.  What is with his neighbor, the homosexual inuendos were there, and well really upfront and unnecessary.  I do not recommend this film to anyone that likes cannibal films, or horror films.  It sucked",1033430400,4,632,4.396551724137931
1082747,3,6305840008,"Eloy De La Iglesia's ""Cannibal Man"" isn't about horror or even cannibalism.  Instead, it's more of a parable about lower-class oppression and how the poor are deemed insignificant by the rest of society.
Marcos (Vincente Parra), a slaughterhouse worker with a beautiful young girlfriend, accidentally kills a cab driver and as a result becomes increasingly homicidal toward people over the course of one week.  He's befriended by an eccentric who lives in an imposing apartment highrise nearby, and eventually Marcos becomes undone by guilt and the fact that he'll never get away with his crimes.
""Cannibal Man"" is an odd title for this movie, considering there's no cannibalism (save for a brief soup-eating scene, but I don't think that qualifies) and it really comes from an era that preceded the 'cannibal/zombie boom' of the late 1970's and early 80's.  The murders are relatively brief and not very inspired by today's standards (how many times have we seen a meat cleaver through the face in slasher films?), but the interaction between Marcos and his friend Nester is what really makes the movie.  Morality, and--to a lesser degree--sexuality are questioned in a way that make ""Cannibal Man""'s by-the-numbers bloodshed forgivable.
Recommended, but view with an open mind.  This isn't the horror of Fulci or Argento, but is still worth a look.",976060800,9,1350,5.146118721461187

7896210,5,6305840008,"This film is a masterpiece. It is an example of a horror film which transcends the genre. Sadly however, it is titled ""Cannibal Man"" which was fine for the film's release in 1972 but 40 years later the title alone has connotations that may lead certain viewers to the film and leave them disappointed. ""Cannibal Man"" is NOT part of the ""cannibal film"" subgenre (populated by films like Ruggero Deodato's infamous ""Cannibal Holocaust"", Lenzi's ""Cannibal Ferox"", etc.).
Rather, director Eloy De La Iglesia's masterful film is a complex character study and psychological thriller. Filmed in 1971 this Spanish film was way ahead of its time with only Polanski's ""Repulsion"" (and to a certain extent ""Psycho"") being of a similar character. ""Cannibal Man"" is a stylish, well-acted, well-produced, thought provoking and disturbing film which stands up as brilliantly today as it did in 1972. With one caveat: the viewer must be informed about what this film is and is not. If you're looking for ""Cannibal Holocaust"" you will be hugely disappointed!!! If you are instead looking to view a film which laid the foundation for films like Lustig's 1980 classic ""Maniac"" (which is vastly more exploitive and fits more neatly within the horror genre, but yet due to Joe Spinell's brilliant performance which depicts the alienation and spiral into madness of an average man, is an undeniable cousin to ""Cannibal Man""), and especially ""Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer"". First off, Marco, the ""protagonist"" of ""Cannibal Man"" is NOT a cannibal. Instead he is simply an average working class man who works in a massive slaughterhouse/soup factory. Also, Marco is not a madman.
Without spoiling the plot of the film, he commits a murder in self-defense which causes a domino effect of murders as he attempts to stay a free man. There are many strong undertones to this film. One of which is class politics. Marco is not a psychopath. He simply realizes that as a working class guy with little money to hire lawyers, that the odds and more importantly, the system, are stacked against him in being acquitted of the unintentional killing which begins his descent into mass murder and psychological breakdown.
The cinematography of this film is simply spectacular and the film has a distinctly documentary like (at times cinema verite) style throughout the majority. However there are also shots of pure grandeur such as the aerial shots of Marco's lone, square, one-story, stucco home which resides in a virtual wasteland surrounded by encroaching high rise apartment complexes. These shots are simply rad and add a huge element to the mood of this film. Another one of the film's most interesting aspects are the strange, mysterious homosexual under-currents which exist over Marco's slow-building friendship and strange relationship with an educated, upper-class young man who lives in one of the  nearby luxury high-rises and has a bird's eye view (especially with binoculars) directly into Marco's living room due to the sky-light ceiling of Marco's home. This leads to an awesome psychological chess match climax when Marco realizes that the man whom he is now friends with has likely witnessed all which has occurred.
The acting of Vincente Parra who plays the role of Marco is simply brilliant. In one sequence (after the bodies he has hidden in his brother's bedroom begin to decompose and stink) in which a horny, married waitress/cook comes to visit Marco (with the hope of sex) unexpectedly, she is obviously aware of the smell. After a prolonged scene in which she finally recognizes what she has walked in on, Marco begins frantically spraying air freshener (a bottle in each hand) while beseeching her to simply smell the spray's ""pine"" fragrance and ignore the reality of the situation. In this scene Parra's acting is incredible as the viewer doesn't know whether to pity him, be terrified of him, or wish to help him. There are many ""anti-hero"" tendencies in Parra's performance. Again, this film was shot in 1971 and released in '72 putting it quite early on the modern horror film timeline. ""Cannibal Man"" more than deserves to be placed along different but similar themed films like ""Last House On The Left"" and is a truly important and visceral film.
Now to the violence...The film has a natural documentary like flavor to it, however, this is brought to the forefront immediately with the film's opening scenes: real slaughterhouse footage including the cutting of the throats and draining of the blood of hanging cows, etc. It is strong stuff if you are not familiar with the realities of the process of butchering cattle. However, this footage (disturbing as it is) is not used in an exploitative manner in my opinion, but rather as a means to introduce us to Marco's reality as a slaughterhouse employee.
When it comes to the murder of humans there are several superb, very nasty, and realistic sequences which for '72 get a pretty damn high gore-score! But again, despite the title, ""Cannibal Man"" is not nearly as much of an exploitation film as nearly all who view it without knowing much about it, expect. The film is a piece of early horror realism (ala ""Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer) coupled with the components of what would become known as a psychological thriller (like ""The Silence of the Lambs"").
Yes, I'm putting ""Cannibal Man"" amongst some highly respected company and I feel deservedly so. The film deals with Marco's loneliness, alienation, economic struggles, and fear of intimacy (he has a girlfriend, but the film makes it quite clear that she is much younger than Marco who feels he is not ready for marriage). The film also (as with so many Italian/Spanish films of the era) is blessed with an exquisite musical score by Fernando Morcillo as well as top-notch use of sound effects, etc. to further add elements of claustrophobia, anxiety, etc., especially in the scenes where Marco is alone at home. There is even a well-done bit of social satire pertaining to the brand of soup which is produced using meat from the slaughterhouse/factory where Marco works (and tries to slowly dispose of his mounting number of victims). In the end, ""Cannibal Man"" is simply a GREAT film (forget the genre label). It is stylish, well-executed, and ahead of its time.
However, the fact that the film's title is misleading to many of today's horror fans will always cause a certain percentage to pick up the film, view it, and end up unsatisfied due to their preconceived notions of what the film entailed. Hopefully, as was the case with my first viewing of the film when Anchor Bay released it on VHS (man, time flies) in an uncut and widescreen form, instead of disappointment the viewer will find themselves sucked in by this awesome piece of cinema from the seminal days of the modern, realist-based psychological horror film. A cutting edge film for 1971-1972 which pushed the boundaries quite far and even 40 years later still is as relevant as ever....Truly a lost masterpiece!",1512518400,,7000,4.967604433077579

7896213,4,6305840008,"WEEK OF THE KILLER (the actual title) is definitely a more satisfying title for this film, it is at least an honest title as well. It's a shame that those marketing this film to help it gain a profit opted for the title CANNIBAL MAN (as here in the U.S.), and its trailer trying to make it look more horrific than it really is, with chipper sounding narration in a ""nice weather we're having"" tone!!

That is a shame because it's useless to try and lure in horror/gore hounds for a film that's basically a nice moody drama that will leave one with a saddened, downbeat mood rather than thrills. The ""Cannibal Man"" title is silly particularly because there really isn't any cannibalism in the film. The closest thing to that is found to be a coincidence and even upsets the main character when he realizes what was in his soup.

Though I'd rather have seen it in the original language with subtitles, I'm still happy Anchor Bay rescued it and released it on DVD for folks like me who enjoy obscure films.

The story is basically about a slaughterhouse worker who accidentally starts a downward spiral of killing and madness in his life, unable to cope with what he's done and finding it's just easier to off the people who get too close to his secret. The wide, open landscapes of yet to be developed land and the minimal score add amazing scope to the loneliness Marcos (Vicente Parra) feels, and mirrors the loneliness of his newfound friend that lives in the high-rise literally next door to his little house. Even the swimming scene had a quiet beauty to it. Considering the time and politics for 1971 in that area, there's more to this story than just a man not able to cope with his murderous actions.

The neighbor's sexuality is handled in a rather refreshingly basic manner, not being stereotypically gay nor lecherous. It's also great how throughout the film, we wonder if he really knows more about what Marcos is doing than we can guess, with lines like ""You better bury them,"" is he talking about Marcos' memories or the bodies starting to add up in Marcos' bedroom? Their interactions are always fascinating, and were very much highpoints of the film. It was wonderful to see a scene like the swimming scene with these two men; somehow I get the feeling that if this film were to have been made today, the powers that be in Hollywood would have tried to work that scene with two women.

An increasing depressing tone sets in up through to the end, but some nice dialogues keep the story in check and moving despite the slower tone of the film. The violence works in context to the situations, rather than seeming gratuitous to satisfy those who feel they need to see that in order to enjoy a film. For me, I was far more disturbed by the first minute of the film, seeing the animal slaughtered. It was difficult getting through that. The sexual element is surprisingly minimal, not as much nudity as you'd think a film of this storyline would have, but since it's not really an exploitive film, having less breasts to gawk at works in its favor. Like many films of that European source and time, having no end credits leaves the viewer in a more affected mood with the film's rather abrupt ending.

LA SEMANA DEL ASESINO is great viewing for fans of drama, but horror seekers should stay clear. It's good to see other people commenting about the film's interesting qualities instead of reading comments that they felt ripped off that it wasn't about cannibals nor full of tense scary scenes. It's pure drama, and I'm glad some people are managing to get around the unfortunate marketing ploys this film was given and see how worthwhile it really is! Indeed a nice discovery.",1499126400,,3687,4.604261796042618
