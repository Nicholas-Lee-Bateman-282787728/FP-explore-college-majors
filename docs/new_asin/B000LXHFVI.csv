8165019,4,B000LXHFVI,"This series was made on a very low budget, so the sets are cheap and the stories are performed by the same small group of actors who appear in every episode.  This adds to the charm of the DVD set - seeing the chap, who in the previous story wore glasses and played a lawyer, don a moustache in this show to play a hoodlum.

At the end of each story, Craig Kennedy turns to camera and acknowledges the presence of the viewer.  A corny gimmick, but nice to see.

The picture quality on this DVD set is excellent.  And, as an extra, we get one episode of a 1936 Craig Kennedy movie serial.",1174694400,9,587,4.114035087719298
