8638379,4,B00I2TDL8E,"Very informative documentary on the involvement of Kampfgruppe Peiper in the Battle of the Bulge. This is not a dramatic production akin to a History Channel special, it is almost purely presented by the narrators in person on the actual locations where the battles took place. It is a UK production, the few reenactment scenes are a little cheesy as they digitally add muzzle flash and explosion sound effects. My only real complaint was the lack of original footage and photos. All in all an excellent play by play of the Kampfgruppe during it's movements through Belgium. Recommend for true history nerds only haha",1492473600,2,617,4.9423076923076925
