8098362,5,B000CEV3IW,"The first review of this DVD got it completely wrong.  It was my favorite when I was 13, and 13 years later it still rocks.
  All the greats make an appearance: Michael Jordan, Dominique Wilkins, Clyde Drexler, Julius Erving, Daryl Dawkins, and Magic Johnson.  Here are a few quotes:

""It's all about having supreme confidence and not many guys have it."" Charles Barkley

""My reaction, my eternal reaction, was more about calm and peace after the accomplishment.  It's interesting to see how much that's turned around""  Dr. J

""If you don't believe in yourself, no one else will.""  Spud Webb

""Every time you left your feet you were endangering yourself, because they'd take your legs right out. Players certainly could dunk the ball, but if you dunked it, your man didn't like it, and you'd pay for it the next time.""  Paul Arizin on the dunk in the early NBA

""The best dunk I ever saw was when Chamberlain would go up there and dunk that ball.  That was sensational, cause Chamberlain would slam it, really slam it with tremendous force."" -The cigar smoking Red Auerbach

""They pay cash down here."" Daryl Dawkins on playing basketball in Greece

""Get tough X, get tough, don't let him push you.""  Xavier McDaniel

""These are people that will just dunk on you, don't care about you.  They will just dunk in your face and just make you like it."" Magic Johnson

""Once he get up there, he say, `Maybe I'll just hang up here for a while, up in the air."" Magic Johnson on Michael Jordan

""It's all about having supreme confidence and not many guys have it."" Charles Barkley

""You own the ball, you own the game, you own the guy who's guarding you, and you can actually play him like a puppet.""  Michael Jordan

""Now we ready, now we ready."" Magic Johnson on the state of the audience at his off-season charity game

""Dunking is a such an overpowering way to score a basket.  People can see a dunk and though it only means 2 points, it always seemed to be six points."" Michael Jordan

""It's just a question of coming through.  You know what you can do, go out there and do it.  Let it flow.""  Clyde Drexler

""You definitely come to give them a show, if at all possible, while you're playing.""  Magic Johnson

""Damn, I did that, I broke a back board.  Now, I gotta see if I can do this again."" Daryl Dawkins

Hands down my favorite basketball highlight video.  Entertaining to max.  Quotable, and packed with some of the best dunks from the 80s and 90s",1218931200,3,2447,4.4795454545454545
8098363,5,B000CEV3IW,"I completely disagree with the last review.  This dvd offering two past videos in one is a steal for the cost.  Watching Dr. Jay dunk in person is something to behold!  If these earlier guys weren't dunking like they did then there wouldn't be today's selfish players dunking like that either.  Even to this day NO ONE dunked in a game like Shawn Kemp!  His agility and speed with power and grace is second to none!!!  Nicked name the ""Rain Man"" he would bring it down on entire teams at once.  He would disappear into the paint and emerge head and shoulders above every one slamming it with authority, plus the Key Arena seating has the crowd literally on the court and every one would jump be out of there seats going nuts.  It was a site to see, just complete caos!
  Also with Shaq being the last true center in the game and dying off, You can witness some of the greatest centers take total personal command of the middle, like they should be doing.  Not like today where forwards do now.
  Great dvd and I still enjoy watching it!",1202860800,3,1036,4.361256544502618
8098364,2,B000CEV3IW,"You can take the Super out of Super Slams.  I remembered as a young child watching the original when it came out, and thought it was great.  Not so when I watched them all again.",1180396800,,178,4.057142857142857
