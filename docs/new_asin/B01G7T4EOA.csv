7758832,4,B01G7T4EOA,"I own Season 9 and 10, as well as several of the Essentrics DVDs.  I find Season 11 suitable for a beginner as the pace is a bit slower.  The location is beautiful, as always and there is a great mix of workouts for mobility or strength (each about 22 min long).  I recommend this set for someone starting with Classical Stretch or with more limited mobility.",1472342400,71,359,4.3283582089552235

7758834,5,B01G7T4EOA,"I absolutely love Miranda Esmonde-White and her Classical Stretch workouts, and have been recommending her to as many family and friends as possible. Her Public TV special 'Aging Backwards' was my introduction to her method in the summer of 2015. She made a lot of sense. Testimony by followers of all ages and abilities were compelling.

After recording and following a few of her 23-minute workout episodes on a local PBS station, I felt great and more energized than after years of faithfully using other exercise DVDs. Two examples: After following several Jane Fonda workouts for a year or so, they became routine, providing no further challenge or benefit. Graduating through several of Kathy Smith's DVDs, they provided a challenge, but only when you continued to increase the heft of your hand weights. My shelves resembled a sporting goods store display and sagged from an accumulation of brightly colored weights.

More research on Classical Stretch followed. I borrowed the Aging Backward book from the library before purchasing a Kindle version on 7/11/15. Miranda is a proponent of new exercise theory, and you will be too. In her book and in her DVD workouts and on her website, Miranda explains how and why to stretch. She also has specific stretches for specific body parts and problems. She explains where you should be feeling the stretch if you're doing it right. She explains the reason why you need to work agonist and antagonist muscles during the same workout. She explains why just lifting weights does more harm than good. Yes, she talks a lot. But if you continue to pay attention, and follow her suggestions, you continue to benefit.

Last year, I purchased Season 10 Classical Stretch Strength and Flexibility 4-DVD set for myself. The only equipment needed: a mat, a chair, and maybe a padded hemorrhoid donut (for floor work). When Season 11 Classical Stretch Full Body Mobility 4-DVD set came out this year, I purchased it, so that I could loan some of my Season 10 DVDs to friends and family. I've also purchased her Ultra Stretch Workout for an elderly aunt, and at Christmas, I purchased four DVDs as gifts for my sisters to target particular physical complaints. I love you, sisters!

Do not hesitate to do your own research. Read about Miranda's methods. Watch her mini workout videos online. Record some of her 23 minute workouts on PBS. Understand that the production quality has improved with her newer series (better sound quality, better balancing of left & right repetitions). Then BUY THE DVD, so you don't clog up your DVR. Purchase from Amazon or from her website for good Customer Service. Special thanks to Nicole Pas, who helped me with a packaging problem, and replaced a cracked case faster than immediately.

Enjoy your renewed health and improved posture. Then share the word with those you love.",1469577600,137,2848,4.949790794979079
7758835,4,B01G7T4EOA,I love the Classical Stretch work outs. I have the 8 the season and now the 11 season. I use these stretch workouts every day!  The 11th year quality of the videos and music much better. Miranda talks a bit too much in the 11th season for my liking,1469404800,20,248,4.061224489795919

Some seem a little repetitive, but I like her easy style, great backgrounds, and explanations.  22 minutes a day and you start to notice muscle and toning.  Great to target specific body areas as each DVD is labeled with the target area.",1515628800,,260,4.733333333333333
7758840,5,B01G7T4EOA,"Great set but when I purchased the set, the amount was half of what I was actually charged! $80+ was too much!!  Shipping just doesn't cost that much!",1513468800,,150,4.357142857142857
7758841,5,B01G7T4EOA,"I am 47 years old and have run 6 marathons, but now when I try train for a race, I get some sort of injury, and I sit all day at work.  I think my long distance days are behind me.  I can't just head out the door and run like the wind anymore!  Now I have feet that get stress fractures and bone spurs and hips that tighten so badly that it hurts to sit after a long run.  I had heard how good stretching was for ""old"" ladies, so I decided to give this a try.  I wanted something that didn't have an overt spiritual component (like tai chi or yoga) and I wanted something that wasn't grueling (I have arthritis (hallux rigidus) in at least one big toe and some other smaller health issues so the Les Mills classes that all the gyms do are too much for me).  I even checked the local y and other gyms, and if they did have a stretching class, it was in the middle of the day, when I am at work.  This DVD series was just what I was looking for.  I am doing one episode  (or sometimes just a half) each morning, and I really do feel better on the mornings when I do this. (sometimes packing kids lunches and things like getting out of the door in time gets in the way).  I have lost 3 pounds in the month that I have been doing these (but honestly that could be because I have a cold and not the workouts), and I have gone on a few short runs right after these, and I feel better after these runs than I did when I wasn't doing this kind of stretching first.  Most of the workouts get some type of feet exercises in which is good for my arthritic feet.  I like that there are so many workouts, so it is not the same thing over and over.  I am just half way through them, but some of them I have done twice in a row.  This isn't the type of workout that will leave you soaked with sweat, but some of the moves are challenging and I feel like they are building strength in places like my arms, that have always been weaker.  Sometimes my arms shake from the exertion!  Nothing on these videos is embarrassing.  So, if I leave it in the blue ray and it pops on when my kids and their friends are turning on the Wii, no need to race over to try to stop it lightning fast.  I know that sounds weird, but I did have another workout video designed for ladies that was a whole lot more explicit in the language and directions!  The narrative and images in this workout series are not in any way embarrassing or explicit.

Miranda Esmonde-White has a very pleasant demeanor and is very encouraging.  She explains why a stretch should be done a certain way, and while I am not a fitness expert, her explanations seem to make sense.  She said not to do shoulder exercises with weights or you could damage the shoulder and that is exactly how my husband tore his rotator cuff, so she is right about that!  The backdrop in the workouts varies, and while I didn't think that was a selling point when I ordered this, the upbeat music and tropical backdrop make the routines go by quickly.  I am sold, and plan on doing these (or maybe another season later) for the foreseeable future.",1511568000,3,3067,4.115966386554621
7758842,5,B01G7T4EOA,My wife used have two full body massages a month and has been doing classical stretch via the tv broadcast for 2 years even taping them on the VCR.

7758848,5,B01G7T4EOA,"I'm a 53 year old man who has lifted weights on-and-off for decades. In March 2017, I fell into flood waters near our home and almost drowned in the whirlpools. I cracked a rib and damaged all the joints on my left side as well as my back; I could barely walk. After finding out about Essentrics via Forever Painless on PBS, I purchased the Essentrics Pain Relief Workouts DVD set, which was all I could handle for the first couple of months; those exercises worked like a charm! I graduated to Classical Stretch Season 11 within 8 to 10 weeks (the earlier seasons were too vigorous for me at that point). I've now been doing Essentrics exercises from these two DVD sets faithfully every day for almost six months, and my back pain (which had bothered me since my early 30's) has largely disappeared, numbness in my left thigh from a messed up disc has receded noticeably, my hips and shoulders have loosened up, I can turn my head both ways after not being able to turn comfortably to the right for years, and I can dance again. These exercises don't feel like they ought to push you, but I still find myself sweating like crazy even though the exercises feel relatively easy. My core is much stronger than it has ever been before in my life! Recently, I found that I could climb hills without undue gasping or discomfort even though I hadn't been hiking since the accident. Because my rib is still healing, I've had to avoid the floor exercises and haven't been able to return to weight lifting yet, but even so my body is behaving more youthfully and all my muscles are kept toned. I usually do two episodes a day, which gives me about 45 minutes of exercise, but some days I only have time to do one episode, which still keeps me pain free. Miranda's explanations are golden; she really understands the body. This is the best exercise program I have ever tried.",1506729600,11,1865,4.488235294117647
7758849,5,B01G7T4EOA,"I have a difficult time hearing criticisms of Miranda Esmond-White, especially that she talks too much.  I find that I appreciate all of her comments because she is excellent at telling us why we are doing a particular exercise, cautionary statements such as being careful when working the IT band, and how the calves and thighs assist pumping blood.  I am 71 years old and have been doing her program for about 1-1/2 years.  She has changed my body for the better, and I find that I have much more energy than I have ever had.  I have friends who are either my age or a little older, and they can no longer go up and down stairs.  I find that really sad.  I bound up and down the stairs many times a day, and it's because of Ms. Esmond-White.  I have almost all of her seasons, and I have found that she does do things differently with each season.  I imagine it's because she is learning as she advances.  In her later seasons, she recommends using a hemeroid cushion (please pardon the spelling) for leg lifts.  I wish I could give her 10 stars.  She is excellent.",1506556800,7,1067,4.338383838383838

I seriously cannot recommend these DVDs highly enough!  This is the third season we have purchased and are the most important DVDs in our library!  It is the BEST program that combines so many disciplines all into one!  Doing these faithfully will make your body feel amazing and pain-free!

7758858,5,B01G7T4EOA,"I have season 9 and 10 as well. I have favorite episodes from all the seasons for different reasons. Overall, I do think this season is the best out of the three if you are just starting out or need a lighter workout that day. Even so this does give you a complete workout. You do still feel it. It is just that instead of doing a million plies you do a lot less. This is my second year doing CS and I can tell you that I am a lot stronger and flexible. She knows what she is doing and what she is talking about. When she tells you that a certain movement will do something for you, it really does it. It is easier to go up stairs. It is easier to bend and do chores. She helps you with having correct alignment and that helps you go about your day a lot better. For me, there is no need to go to a chiropractor because doing this type of movement naturally creates the proper alignment. This has been my experience. I cannot say what yours would be. Always be careful when adding new things to your regimen as I see some people suffered injuries from this.",1493337600,23,1057,4.062200956937799

My flexibility and strength have very much improved.  For years I have had to sleep with a pillow under my knees for lower back pain and I no longer have to do that.  My only pain now is my feet.  I have stress fractures in both feet and have had bunion surgery on my right foot.  I was hoping these exercises would help alleviate some of that and it has, but it has not gone completely away.

1. She talks a bit too much
- Miranda is kind of known for giving a 'lecture' in her workouts but she really talks way too much in this series.  While i can see how she's trying to give out better instructions, it actually disrupts the flow of work out for me.

2.  Workouts arw very repetitive
- There are 30 episodes, but all of them feel like the same work out.  It gets very repetitive, i rather get a specific workouts for my needs (her studio DVDs)

3.  Quality is not great
- Quality is not as good as other studio DVD programs she has put out

7758909,5,B01G7T4EOA,The Classical Stretch DVD's have given me a new lease on life. After several years of debilitating hip pain I have become almost pain free. I have been doing the video for 3 months everyday and the difference is incredible. She is fun and gives you a tough but easy workout. She explains what she is doing and why she is doing it. I now have 3 of her DVDs and love all of them. Thank you Miranda!,1476835200,29,396,4.089743589743589

Both my husband and I look forward to her 22 minute daily exercise, each tailed to different muscle and bone areas with constant explanation why they are beneficial. We recommend it to people of all ages and use it exclusively on a daily basis.",1475193600,17,285,4.480769230769231
7758913,3,B01G7T4EOA,"Miranda's routines are great but the quality of the DVDs is inferior. I watched the online video clip, as recommended by the company (I contacted them ahead of time because I never liked its quality on PBS) and went ahead with the purchase.

Very disappointing video quality. The image is fuzzy unlike the on-line video clip. I expected the DVDs to be at least of the on-line quality but that was not the case. Miranda keeps shooting her videos the same way as before only that now it is HD. No considerations to pictures resolution.

Unfortunately for me (I love doing those exercises) I returned the pkg.

As a side note, the packing too is below market standards, very poorly done.",1474848000,16,684,4.636363636363637

7758916,5,B01G7T4EOA,I am 61 year old and I love this video.  The reason I love the videos is I hate exercise but I want to be healthy and vibrant until I am 100.  So this works for me.  I have watching her on PBS for the past year and it has made a difference in the shape of my body as well as my strength.
