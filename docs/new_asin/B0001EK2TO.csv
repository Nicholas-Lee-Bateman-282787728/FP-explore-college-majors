1993687,1,B0001EK2TO,"Solomon talks WAY too much. It's quite difficult to get into the routine. She keeps stopping to explain, as opposed to explaining WHILE demonstrating a pose.  So, you find yourself sitting and waiting for her to finish her explanation before getting into a pose. It's annoying -- she even talks when she doesn't have to! Geez. Yoga and pilates SHOULD BE relaxing. It also looked a bit too amateurish for me. I was upset that I paid $5.00 for it!  Just being honest.",1154908800,3,465,4.590361445783133
1993688,5,B0001EK2TO,"Seven months ago, I was exercising religiously with high impact workouts. Then a bookcase fell on my lower leg/ankle. I could still walk, but high impact aerobics were definitely out of the question. For about six months, I didn't do any exercising at all. My muscles got weaker, and I gained weight. I decided I had to do something to get back in shape, so I started looking for lower impact workouts. This one sounded good, and the price was unbeatable, so I decided to give it a try. I am SO glad I did!!

For the past month, I have been doing this workout at least 3 times a week. My muscle tone is almost back to where it was when I quit exercising, and I have lost over 5 pounds without drastically changing my eating habits (in fact, I tend to eat a little more than I used to - my metabolism must be speeding up). The clothes that were once tight on me are now falling off. Even my injured ankle has been strengthened by the workout. I am now able to do some of the high impact workouts I was doing (although not quite as strenuously as I used to).

Louise Solomon promises that you will lose weight and tone muscle through this workout, and she certainly does not disappoint. Plus, this is a great way to relax after a stressful day at work. I recommend it to anyone who wants to be healthier.",1141862400,24,1302,4.245967741935484
1993689,5,B0001EK2TO,"I agree with everyone else.

I love this DVD. I did some yoga in my twenties, so I am little familiar with it. But I was totally unfamiliar with pilates.

I am also no longer in my twenties, but overweight and out of shape. So I was looking for an exercise program that I could actually do and one without a lot of jerky/straining movements.

The pace on this is good -- I never feel rushed. It may, at first, even appear easy, but some of the poses/exercises are rather challenging. I am still working on doing all of them correctly, especially those in the second workout.

There are two workouts. The first one uses bands and is mainly pilates. The second one incorporates more yoga and less band work -- only a few of those exercises use bands. I have found I really enjoy using a band, it enables me to do some exercises I might not have been able to do otherwise and it also offers resistance. Resistance seems to speed up the toning process.

Note that no bands are included, so I recommend the Gaiam bands.

After using this dvd a month, I have found that I am standing straighter -- it seems my back has more strength -- and my stomach is flatter. I also feel more energized.

You can't ask for much more than that.",1140652800,16,1224,4.2956521739130435
1993690,5,B0001EK2TO,"This inexpensive dvd which is divided in chapters by body part, comes in 5.1 dolby sound though seems a waste since there is no music, only her giving instructions & things to watch out for. Normally I hate when there's no music, but her lovely, clear, British accent is so soothing I didn't miss it. The camerawork is good with closeups of her & other students of the body parts you're working on.

There is an general intro about the benefits, general warnings & guidelines & what equipment you will need such as blanket, stretchy bands, etc. for 6 min, then her stting in a room alone showing you how to breathe deeply normally & toning abs when you breathe out using a stretchy band for 3 min. Next is her talking about your body's structure & aligment for 2 min.

The workout is done on a stark white stage/place w/her in back in a pink top/blank pants w/6 women in the foreground helping to demonstrate w/some modifying.

WORKOUT ONE starts at the 12 min. mark w/everyone laying down & almost a meditative start for 2 min before doing head rolls. Then breathing w/emphasis with ab use & then tilting the hip aligment to slightly stretch the abs/lower back. Next is raising the head slightly for very modified curl up to regular curl ups, then curl ups with elbows to bent knees til the 20 min mark.

Next is straight leg raises, then bent legs to chest for stretching, more straight leg raises w/1 bent leg, then bent knee spinal twist, then repeated to the other side for total of 4 min.

Next is using the stretchy bands sitting up around bent knees for spinal posture, then arm resistance, then leaing back & back up to sitting for abs & back for 5 min.

At the 29 min mark is laying back down for straight leg raised stretching, leg bent resistance, pilats leg circles in air, leg stretching w/stretchy bands & then repeated on the other side & concluded with a 1 min rest at the 37 min mark.

WORKOUT TWO w/her in a blue top, starts with them sitting up & noticing the body, then shoulder rolls for 2 min. Next is shoulder/arm twisting (feels great), then using stretchy bands arm extentions & slight spinal twists for 2 min. Next is laying down on 1 side, straight leg raises, swinging leg fwd, lower leg raises & then repeated on the other side for 5 min. Next is cat/cow yoga hands/knee stretching, then 1 arm/leg raising, bent knee in chest then raised to side, to elbow, etc. for 3 min to the 50 min mark. Next is working slowly up to downard dog & then childs pose & repeated several times, ending w/standing foward bend for 5 min.

Next is yoga standing poses starting w/triangle pose, warrior 1 & side angle & then repeated on the other side, then a wide standing forward bend, low simple leg lung stretching for 5 min.

Now at the 1 hour mark, they are sitting for arm/shoulder exercises w/stretchy bends extending & behind the back & concluding w/stretching the arm across the chest & neck stretching for 7 min for a total of 1 hour & 7 min.

In addition, there is a video of the beach at sunset for 2 min w/her narrating over guiding you to relaxation.

The workout is done in a slow, relaxed pace, so you don't feel rushed (unless you have to watch the clock, which case this DVD will annoy you) & not go to far & hurt yourself.

This is great for those who are new to working out & stretching, those who want a slow paced workout to be more in touch/tune w/how their body moves/reacts, active people looking for something for a very light day, when you're feeling more tired then usual, or those who haven't worked out all day, feel lazy, guilty & stiff, but don't want to sweat before going to bed. I enjoyed it & felt I did more because it was so relaxed & undemanding.

Take off 3 stars if you expecting the usual agressive workouts or to sweat.",1136937600,24,3772,4.386819484240688

1993692,5,B0001EK2TO,"I had never done yoga or pilates before in my life, and knew nothing about the moves, etc. In fact, I was skeptical. Louise Solomon goes through a thorough explanation and demonstration. She is a certified Yogalates instructor from Australia, and her voice is calm and soothing while it allows you to focus on working the core muscles. There are 2 workouts on this DVD. I started with just the first one which is about 20 minutes. After a week I tried both workouts, which gives you an hour workout (this includes the relaxation portion, which I consider ""dessert""). This workout works best if you also purchase stretch bands like she uses. I've worked out at least 5 days a week for the last 3 months and lost 2 inches in my waist and 4 inches in my abs (I'm eating healthy along with this program). Good workout and I feel rejuvenated upon finishing. Highly recommend for the beginner. I'm now working on her Vol 2 workout.",1094256000,46,925,4.544910179640719

To Yoga - to a totally different way of life, of dealing with life on an everyday basis.  I just can not give enough praise to this precious woman and what she has done with this work.  I never knew how good ""down face dog"" could possibly feel - how strong.  I have not been to gyms and etc. or fancy exercise classes and whatever.  I found this work on a discount shelf and purchased it.  It has changed my life.  I think, actually, that that is what these body/mind excercises are all about.  Thank-you Ms Louise Soloman.  Thank-you.",1383436800,,639,4.294117647058823
1993760,5,B0001EK2TO,I bought this DVD 6 years ago and have been practicing yogalates ever since. I am now 63 years old. I gave this DVD to my friend who is always commenting about how great I look and how toned I am. This DVD transformed my body and gave me my health back. I found this DVD at Walmart in a pile of other DVD's. I had never seen it before.  It was only $5.00.  I broke my knee and had screws in my knee to keep it together. I had a terrible limp and my leg would not heal. My surgeon told me there was nothing I could do about the limp. Someone told me I should do Yoga and it would help. I started following this DVD everyday. After 7 months I had no limp. I had the surgeon take out the screws in my knee against his wishes. I no longer have a limp. My leg is strong. I still have problems with it occasionlly but it is only when I do not do my yogalates to keep my legs strong and lean.,1381363200,6,885,3.7783783783783784
1993761,5,B0001EK2TO,Ok so about 10 years ago I had this Dvd and somehow I lost it.  So i repurchased it. That's how good this DVD is I actually repurchased it. If you don't think you will be able to do this you are wrong.  I didn't think I would be able to but I stuck with it and lost 60lbs! I have other Dvds of hers but love this one.,1377043200,,317,3.579710144927536
1993762,2,B0001EK2TO,"I agree with the positive reviewers that she does take a small amount of time to go over basic breathing techniques which can be great for beginners who are just starting out (like me).  That's about the only good thing I noticed.

Before I go any further I would like to add that I was given this DVD by my mother so I cannot comment at all on Amazon's shipping, this is solely based on my experience watching it.

- I do not like that it does not tell you that you should have a resistance band.  It has no pictures or text on the front telling you that it's recommended.  There are two pictures on the back that show people using them, as well as the smallest text on the DVD case itself saying, ""Yoga and Pilates incorporates the use of a *resisance band to replicate the work done on the Pilates machines.""
(* - the typo is not from me, that is actually on the case..  >.< No time to proof-read before they sent it out?)

If ordering online I doubt it would be noticed by many and I can see it being a hassle to have to order a resistance band after the fact just because you're starting out and didn't realize it was needed.  Because I didn't buy the DVD myself, I didn't check out the case as much as I should have before I popped it in so I had to make due trying to use a jump rope just because I wanted to at least give it a shot.  It is not nearly the same and I wish there was a comment on the front of the case to notify that a band is recommended.

- Her voice.  Monotonous.  Slow.  No inflection at any point.  She made me tired, I almost passed out just listening to her talk.  I understand wanting to talk in a soothing voice, but at the same time you have to keep the interest of the viewers..  I would never use this video for consistent or long term exercise based on that fact that I would not be able to listen to her that often.

- Being a beginner I would have liked a slower explanation of the breathing techniques.  It should have been able to be skipped by the more advanced, but it should have been there.  I know a lot of people said that the video was too slow, but let me explain why I got frustrated at the part I did, because other than that spot, the video was too slow.

When demonstrating or explaining the breathing techniques she has you try them for a few seconds each.  As she's talking, she keeps speeding up her count so by the time she at the end of the explanation you feel rushed in the one area she should be making sure you understand.  I didn't have time to focus on whether or not I was breathing correctly because it didn't seem like an important step for her since she already knew how.  It went from a few nice deep breaths to feeling rushed as she immediately starts on the next breathing technique.

I guess I could have paused to take a bit more time but who wants to be reaching for the remote every few minutes when you're supposed to be relaxing and focusing on your body?

For the record, the main reason I've decided to get rid of the video because of her voice.  The other two points are annoyances (like the lack of a recommendation for a resistance band on the front of the DVD case) but are not the reason I stopped.

If you think you might have the same issue than you should Google Louise Solomon, she has some videos on YouTube.  I would watch a short video and ask yourself if you can listen to that voice for a half hour or more without passing out.",1363651200,,3418,4.114630467571644
1993763,3,B0001EK2TO,"The yoga practice is really very, very simple.  A beginner could use this video easily.  However, if you have any yoga experience it is not very useful.  Moves are very basic and very slow.",1338249600,,189,4.5
1993774,5,B0001EK2TO,"This DVD is great for relaxing after a long day. It slowly prompts you through wonderful, slow, deep stretches coupled with breathing and core strengthening exercises. I like to do this DVD after a workout to thoroughly stretch. It is almost like having a massage, releasing tensions from the arms, neck, back, legs and feet. The workout seems to help me tone, lengthen and refine the smaller and sometimes neglected muscles. Even though it does not seem that much is happening during the exercise, I feel that good kind of feeling the next day, which lets me know that I am achieving real results.",1334620800,,598,4.759615384615385

1993776,5,B0001EK2TO,"I have brought many exercise dvds in my time to try and lose weight and tone up, i find most are way too hard to do and require too much of you in the beginning, and when you are starting out you need to ease into it and enjoy it or you won't stick to it, i brought Louise's dvd 2 weeks ago and watched it first as i do with all dvds before trying it out and it looked easy, but i felt great afterwards and i find it also helps you to become more body aware as well and although i am new to it still i feel i will get use to the moves in no time at all. As a remedial massage therapist i constantly use core muscles in massaging but found i had tightness that i wasn't even aware that i had, which will save me some grief in years to come by stretching and toning specific areas. I will continue to stick to it as i find it helps me greatly to de-stress at the end of the day and hopefully i will look as good as i feel in no time.

The physical therapist who was helping me gave me some yoga exercises which I dutifully did, but the biggest help came from Louise Solomon's Yogalates which I discovered in my collection of DVDs.  How provident!

Within a short time I was able to get back on the political trail and furthermore walked two miles on a nature boardwalk a week ago.

1993800,2,B0001EK2TO,"The moves done are fine, and explained well, but I think all this Louise Solomon does is talk.  I prefer more movement and less talk on my exercise videos.  I have several other videos that are not this slow.",1205884800,2,208,4.3076923076923075
1993801,1,B0001EK2TO,"I wish I'd seen the review titled ""SNOOZE"" before I blew 2 bucks on this. The vast majority of reviews were filled with adoration, so it was a huge let down when I tried this DVD and found it insanely dull, slow, boring, and a terrible waste of time. If you are injured or ill, I imagine this is the workout for you but I fail to see how anyone who heavily exercises would benefit. Even as a light stretching DVD it fails for me and I'm no yoga-pro.
I just wasted an hour of my life and I WANT THAT HOUR BACK so I can spend it on an effective workout.
Sorry to be a downer, but I severely doubt any strength, flexibility, toning, or weightloss could be gained from this DVD. I really want that wasted hour back.",1205107200,5,711,4.085714285714285
1993802,2,B0001EK2TO,"Very, very BORING.  I'm not exactly new to yoga, but I do know the basic principles, which she spends at least half the DVD talking about.  The workout itself is more yoga and less pilates.  Maybe good for someone who has never seen or heard of yoga or pilates before.  No wonder it was only $2.",1203379200,2,295,4.214285714285714
1993803,5,B0001EK2TO,"I used this video about 2 years ago when I graduated from college.  I had actually gained about 20-30 while I was in college, and, I have to tell you, I worked out to this video (just workout 1 for 30 minutes) and it seems like the weight just fell off.  I had already lost about 15 when i started using it.  I used this work out with the Special K diet and in about 2 weeks time I weighed less than I did when I graduated HS.  I notice a significant change in the way my body looked.  Since then, I have used it off and on for while, but now that I am getting married I will definately use it again!!!!",1193875200,3,603,3.869918699186992

8011209,5,B0001EK2TO,"I really love Louise Solomon's Yoga & Pilates DVD! I use it mainly as a cool down exercise program after doing the Beachbody 21-Day Fix 30-minute exercise routine each day. The Workout 1 is a really relaxing workout done mainly on your back and sitting up. It ends on your back with a relaxation period of 5-10 minutes. After a difficult aerobic exercise program, this 30-minute program is perfect for cooling down. It works your legs, arms and lower back and just stretches everything out. I have a problem with my hips, and this program has a portion that works the hips using a resistance band. I no longer have any problems with my hips after using this program for a while. Some people might think it is not a hard-enough workout, but used as a cool down workout, it is great! Louise's Australian voice is very soothing and easy to listen to. Workout 2 is slightly more difficult. It has downward dogs, warrior 2's, and lots of arm work using the resistance band. If you want a medium workout, you will get one by doing both Workout 1 and Workout 2. Workout 2 is also a 30-minute program. Also, once you have the breathing down, you can skip the first part of the DVD by clicking over to the right from the ""Play"" button on the main menu to the ""Scene Index"". Hit enter. Once in the Scene Index, you can arrow over to the ""Workout 1A"" or ""Workout 2A"" (I think that's what it is called), so you don't have to listen to Louise's story and how to do the breathing method each time you want to work out. When you use the ""Scene Index"", you save time. Each workout is around 30 minutes if you skip those beginning parts. I highly recommend this DVD!",1440633600,,1649,4.374592833876221
