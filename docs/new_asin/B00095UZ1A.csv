8057682,5,B00095UZ1A,"This is a great documentary. Sober, objective, and very informative.

It has some of the same things you will find on other documentaries about this great saint, but it has some unique things to it. Like showing the secret archives of the Vatican; how is a day in the life of some around the Pope; and some really fantastic relics. All that, and great scenes of the Pope.

It has enough unique things to be worth on anyone's collection.",1302825600,,436,4.506329113924051
8057683,5,B00095UZ1A,"This video is a great overview of the pope's life.  The drawback is that it is 57 minutes long. This is a great supplement to Weigel's Witness to Hope.

There is some great footage of Pope John Paul II that is unique to this video.  There is a great scene in NY in the rain where the pontiff calls on America to defend the most vulnerable - the unborn and the old. In another scene from Brazil, the Pope gave away his gold cardinal's ring to be sold to assist the needy that he encountered in a Ghetto.

It is a great addition to any collection.

Topics covered include:

His early years

His election

His trips to the US & World

The Poor

CBS' 48 hrs special assignment in the Vatican

Communism

Youth

This short video is perfect for someone who wants a meaningful, objective, and abbreviated look at one of the most fascinating leaders of the 20th century.",1133136000,13,862,4.345911949685535

Rest in peace Lolek!",1122422400,5,139,5.043478260869565
