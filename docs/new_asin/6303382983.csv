638073,3,6303382983,"Well what we've got here is a large-scale ""epic"" (though black-and-white in a year famous for it's early color spectacles) Cecil B. DeMille western, competing in the ""great"" year of 1939 with the now-acknowledged masterpiece Stagecoach, and the pretty well-remembered and regarded DESTRY RIDES AGAIN, ALLEGHENY UPRISING, THE OKLAHOMA KID, and the first three color examples of the genre - DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK, DODGE CITY and JESSE JAMES. How does Mr. DeMille, the King of Hollywood, compare with all of that (not to mention about 125 more westerns that haven't fared quite so well in popular memory over the past 70 years)?

Only moderately well, I'd have to say. Though it boasts an unquestionably fine cast led by Barbara Stanwyck, Joel McCrea, Robert Preston, Brian Donlevy and Anthony Quinn, and some spectacular action sequences (two train wrecks, a train robbery, a couple of gunfights and a big Indian raid), much of the time the film comes off as little more than a mass of clichs, bad dialogue, and stereotypes that would make Charlie Chan, Fu Manchu and Stepin Fetchit blush. The plot's interesting enough - the building of the transcontinental railroad as seen through a railroad engineer/""problem solver"" (McCrea), the villains (Preston and Donlevy) he has to stop from sabotaging the title railroad from reaching the halfway point first (all for the financial gain of an unscrupulous banker), and the railroad post-woman (Stanwyck) torn between the man (Preston) she's promised herself to, and the more obviously heroic McCrea character; but everything is pretty much telegraphed here, the characters with the exception of Preston all wholly good or wholly bad and the action all rather absurdly overblown.

Because you see, DeMille is fully AWARE that he's making a Grand Statement film. I don't think I've ever seen a feature, including even the De Mille Biblical epics I've watched, so absolutely and absurdly full of itself and so intent on showing us the audience just how important it is. As plenty of writers before me have pointed out, this isn't even the first film based on this story that Hollywood made - John Ford's large-scale THE IRON HORSE covered some of the same ground 15 years earlier; and the whole manifest-destiny, America-must-conquer-the-west idea was pretty old hat, not just in westerns but in reality. Even by 1939 there were filmmakers not so blinded by simple maudlin pieties and facile attitudes about good and evil, hard work versus slothful drunkenness, savagery against civilization - but DeMille insists on making a film every bit as primitive in its dichotomous attitudes as Griffith in BIRTH OF A NATION, a quarter century earlier. Mind you, UNION PACIFIC's stereotypes of the God-fearing but heavy-drinking simple Irish and bloodthirsty Indians aren't quite as blunt as Griffith's racism - but his filmmaking isn't a tenth as exciting either.

As I said, some of the action scenes are nicely done, and Preston and Stanwyck (despite her ludicrously awful over-the-top Irish accent that comes and goes) especially do manage to show some real life and to keep things entertaining. I think the best scene is probably the dramatic 4-way showdown in Stanwyck's mail car with McCrea standing against Preston and Donlevy after the former has robbed the payroll while the Irish lass tries to calm them all down; it really verges on feeling human, something that's all too rare in this collection of cartoonish characters and action. The rear-projection on just about every single scene is distracting also; De Mille must have filmed all of the on location stuff without any of the principal cast and done all of the dialogue scenes in studio.

So all in all, it's a lumbering, heavy-handed and ludicrously scripted story that western audiences even 70 years ago had probably seen before, enlivened by a great cast and reasonably exciting action and storytelling at times. No wonder then that De Mille's larger than life style was not to be the primary mode in the western film after this point, though one can see traces in films like 1944's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffalo-Bill/dp/B0007PALL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffalo Bill</a>&nbsp;(also starring McCrea) and of course De Mille's own 1947 frontier western UNCONQUERED.

638074,3,6303382983,"DeMille's railroading epic owed a debt or two to Ford... He was obviously influenced by ""The Iron Horse""(1924) and there are some sequences which seem more than derivative--in fact, they are remarkably similar... But it was a film that nevertheless deserved the warm reception that it got...

Here was Joel McCrea in fine form with something more worthy of his talents... McCrea played a trouble-shooter whose task was to keep the transcontinental project moving... Barbara Stanwyck played opposite as a railroad fiery Irish post-mistress of the mobile railway town...

Robert Preston, gambler, a one time pal of McCrea's, is now in the employ of another gambler, Brian Donlevy, and they have been hired as saboteurs by a railroad politician secretly trying to impede the progress of the building of the Union Pacific...

Stanwyck didn't really come amiss in an all-out action mixture that took in disorderly and noisy railroad workers, turbulent frontier types of both sexes, con men, outlaws and a generous helping of Indians...

""Union Pacific"" was undoubtedly great fun although perhaps embarrassingly patriotic... But, in perspective, it is dwarfed by another film which appeared the same year and which had a profound and far-reaching influence on the course of Westerns...

John Ford had returned to the form after 13 years abstinence... John Wayne, who had been languishing in 'B' Westerns since making ""The Big Trail,"" was back once more in a main feature starring role...The film was the immortal ""Stagecoach"" which was to set all sorts of standards for Westerns to be...",1234310400,,1581,5.208661417322834

I am a little older now, but would like to see it again, mayby in the original, why not? Johannes.",1215129600,,257,3.690909090909091
638076,5,6303382983,"I had always thought I was a Kathryn Hepburn fan, but Barbara Stanwyck can sling a line or two also!  Her Irish brogue is truly delightful. Joel McCrea does a fine job also, but is a bit wooden at times.

Great acting and directing, and a story line that was very well done for the period in which it was written.

However, the Union Pacific tries mightily to steal as many scenes as possible, and often does so quite handily.  The track laying scenes are very instructive, with wonderful angles and creative photography.  While I have never been an Uncle Pete fan, I knew my railroad library could never be complete without this Cecil B. De Mille classic.

This movie is truly a ""must have"" and I highly recommend it!

638077,5,6303382983,"My favorite western of 1939, with apologies to Cooper, Wayne, Fonda and Power. Joel McCrea is serviceable as the hero, but Cooper or any of the others above would have made a much better romantic partner-in-the- wings for Barbara Stanwyck, who was perfect for her role. Yes, the plot sounds a little screwy, maybe there's too much flagwaving and stereotyped characters, but still you've got a whole trainload of memorable characters, a variety of action sequences and a complicated romantic dance involving Stanwyck through most of this long film. Things never get dull, as there is a caboose full of villains who alternately take the stage for McCrea and his colorful bodyguards to deal with, often in a humorous fashion. Anthony Quinn did not like his role as a crooked layabout, hence refused to do another film for DeMille, his future father-in-law. Brian Donley is perfect as another devil incarnate. Robert Preston, whom I often confuse with Donlevy, has a more complicated role, trying to decide whose side he's on and who Stanwyck is actually in love with.",1180051200,,1064,4.98314606741573
638078,4,6303382983,"This is artful entertainment; this is Cecil B. De Mille presenting an odd blend of celebration and deconstruction in his portrayal of the burgeoning American empire.  Far-sighted statesmen and greedy corporate barons; vigilante ""justice,"" racism, ridicule and praise for the durable Irish immigrants, a bolloxed love triangle,  a spunky and noble Irish lass, a dissipated lover, a grim strong and silent type, a comic Mexican thug: De Mille's scriptwriters seem inspired to throw in as many elements to the plot as their imaginations allow; and the result isn't the mess you'd suspect but fascinating fun, some gripping  action sequences, and a lovely story of confused love.
Barbara Stanwyck plays a guileful innocent, a warm-hearted dame better than both her suitors in her generous and wise understanding of human nature.  Joel McCrea plays a super-stolid hero whose better part is realized by his attraction for Stanwyck's character; and Robert Preston is a flim-flam man, a gambler and crook whose love for Stanwyck's ""Molly Monahan"" redeems his otherwise unrepentent self.
De Mille plays this beguiling troika against the ""canvas of history"" and so personalizes the abstraction of history.  John Ford's ""Stagecoach,"" also released the same year, 1939, is more accomplished and its story more subtle, but not so much more.  De Mille obviously enjoys his broad canvases, and his ""history"" tends to pompous pronouncement at times, but all history is biography for him, which means that -- just as with Ford -- the individual stories are what is important.
You'll like this movie: you'll love ""Missy"" Stanwyck, McCrea and Preston -- you'll even forgive its somewhat more than occasional moments of silliness.",1079568000,4,1710,5.314814814814815
638079,4,6303382983,"Cecil B. DeMille's contribution for that sterling movie year of 1939 was, of all things, a Western; but it's a brawling, two-fisted, action-packed Western. It is the story of the Union Pacific Railway, which was destined to link two oceans and open up the West. It's like a rough-and-tumble heavyweight slugfest-exciting, thrilling, gory and cumbersome. Stanwyck is excellent as the Irish Molly Monahan and as Jeff, Joel McCrea is first-rate - as Dick Allen, Robert Preston is terrific. DeMille's first choice for Molly was Jean Arthur; when she was unavailable, her turned his favourite, Barbara Stanwyck - they had worked together many times on the LUX RADIO THEATRE. The exterior shots were filmed in Iron Springs, Utah and Canoga Park, California (to double for Promontory Point). Interestingly enough, the golden spike used in the movie was the actual one used at Promontory Point. DeMille had it exhumed from the vault of Wells Fargo in San Francisco! Joel McCrea commented that Stanwyck was ""Absolutely fearless and has more guts than most men"". Also: ""I have never worked with an actress who was more cooperative, less temperamental and a better workman, to use my term of highest compliment, than Barbara Stanwyck"". - Cecil B. DeMille.",1006041600,26,1244,5.1330049261083746
638080,4,6303382983,"If it's directed by Cecil B. de Mille, you know there's going to be plenty of spectacle, and this film is no exception.  Joel McCrea stars as a man hired by the Union Pacific railroad to be a troubleshooter as the build the railroad across the country.  Not everyone wants to see it built, so sabotage causes lots of delays.  Things get even more complicated for McCrea because his old pal Robert Preston is partnered with Brian Donlevy, one of the men trying to delay the construction.  To add to it, Preston and McCrea are both in love with the same woman, an Irish lass named Molly played by Barbara Stanwyck.  Train wrecks, Indian attacks, brawls, and other De Mille touches enliven the story.  The actors aren't given much to work with, as in most De Mille spectacles, but they do well enough, although Stanwyck's accent is a little hard to swallow.  Akim Tamiroff and Lynne Overman, as men hired to protect McCrea, add a lot of humour to the film with their knowing performances.  The story moves along at a good pace, and although I like to make fun of Cecil B. De Mille movies, I must admit that I enjoyed this one more than some of the others I have seen.  I like the time period and the trains, and in De Mille's hands, it's certainly not boring.",1005868800,17,1256,4.426086956521739

It is directed by the famous Cecil B. DeMille and has an excellent cast.  Joel McCrea plays the troubleshooter, Jeff Butler.  His buddy, Dick Allen (Robert Preston) meet again for this project after fighting together during the Civil War.  Both are handsome rugged  men who fall for the sassy Mollie Monahan (Barbara Stanwyck).  Molly works on the railroad as the mail lady, whose father is a train engineer.

Union Pacific is a lively action-packed story that shows the danger and adventure as the Western expansion progresses.  It is an interesting chapter in the early American nation.  The beginning of the film notes that the ""Union Pacific is the drama of a nation, young, tough, prodigal and invincible...""  It caries the theme of the railroad as the future of the United States, and along its rails new cities will rise.

Overall, the film is engrossing, and am excellent Western Epic.  It will satisfy all the Wild West buffs.",1287619200,,1104,4.967213114754099

7845334,4,6303382983,"This is a well made and historically interesting 1939 movie about the building of the transcontinental railroad.  It is historical fiction.  It has a great cast and was directed by Cecil B. DeMille.  Among other iconic stars the movie features Joel McCrea, Anthony Quinn, Robert Preston, Brian Donlevy, and Barbara Stanwyck.  As a fan and student of Hollywood history, on could spend a lot of time studying Cecil B. DeMille, Joel McCrea, and Barbara Stanwyck.

I particularly love Barbara Stanwyck in this role as an actress.  There are also some interesting special effects from that era.

The movie was made at approximately the same time as ""Stage Coach"" and these two great westerns launched a renewal of the western genre as a serious art form.  The movie is, of course, somewhat dated, however it is a good movie from the period.  I am very glad I got to see it.  Thank You...",1495152000,,882,4.743421052631579
