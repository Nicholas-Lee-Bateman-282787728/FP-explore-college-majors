If you are looking to broaden your collection to include more than the standard operas such as Boheme, Aida, etc, this light comedy is a very good choice. Not only do the singers sing and act their parts well, but they also look their parts (which is frequently not the case in opera).",1127001600,24,439,4.569620253164557
2349061,5,B000A0XS18,"I bought this DVD as a fan of Anna Netrebko while having some reservations about Prokofiev, preferring Mozart, Beethoven Bach Brahms etc. But what delights and surprises awaited me when I played the disc! The Kirov ballet were inventive and refreshing, the comedy made me laugh out loud, the sets were so imaginative, the costumes, the singing - gorgeous. I know I'll play this again and again, especially when I need cheering up. The Betrothal in a Monastery is a real tonic.",1193529600,,476,4.817073170731708
2349062,4,B000A0XS18,"Firstly, if you're wondering if this offers a good opportunity to gaze at the beauteous Anna Netrebko, then -- YES! She has a plum role and she's gorgeous in this with enuf medium closeups to satisfy the most hormonal of men.

But, remember, this is Prokofiev's opera, not Puccini's, so expect the music to be atonal and expressive rather than melodic. Once you get used to it, it's kinda fun.

But... oiy!... that plot! Surely it was ancient when Richard Sheridan came up with his version (""The Duenna"") in 1775 -- which was the source of this opera. Stop me if this sounds familiar: a pair of lovers attempt to get married despite the designs of a controlling father and a grotesque suitor, so the clever young woman with the aid of her clever servant generate a scheme which sometimes employs crossed identities.

At 2-1/2 hours, some of it is bound to bore. But this is blessed with a pretty good cast performing on colorful sets that just manages to stay shy of garishness. At least, it's well lit.

Which reminds me: this is a filming of the St Petersburg stage production. I prefer those since it gives me a sense of what it would be like to be sitting in the auditorium. But, alas, then there wouldn't have been any closeups of Anya.",1183248000,7,1241,4.526785714285714
2349063,4,B000A0XS18,"Frankly, I do not enjoy Prokofiev's music in this work as much as say, Glinka in Ruslan and Lyudmilla, another starry production of Kirov Opera.
So only 4 stars. HOWEVER, admittedly, this is a first class production conducted by none other than Valery Gergiev, and headed by none other than Anna Netrebko and Larissa Diadkova. All three gave terrific performances in this work.
The supporting cast is nothing less - the Don Jerome is funny to the utmost. The Mendoza, though weird in appearance with a false nose, sung well and acted impeccably.  The scene and duet with Diadkova in the house of Don Jerome is the most funny operatic scene I've yet come across. Bravo!
The tenor role Don Antonio is finely acted out, though vocally not outstanding as the rest of the cast. Lousia is a very vivacious and cheeky girl vividly portrayed by Anna Netrebko.
The star of the show is again Larissa Diadkova's duenna. This contralto is so versatile and dramatic that rightly should be considered as the current best.
Very entertaining, whether you like Prokofiev and Russian stuff or not.",1181692800,5,1079,4.832432432432433

2349065,3,B000A0XS18,"`Betrothal in a Monastery' is admittedly a difficult opera to stage. The libretto is ridiculous, with pantomime characters and situations throughout; and yet Prokofiev's score contains sinister, menacing elements and traces of sincere passion. Prokofiev himself stated that his score deliberately highlighted the ROMANTIC over the `buffa' themes in the story, while remaining firmly in the genre of comic opera. For any production to be truly effective a balance must be found between these important components - the `buffa' and the `seria' - and this Kirov Opera production unfortunately fails in this respect. Yes, it's fun. But when every scene and aria is played with the same overly stagy and affected histrionics a certain dissatisfaction begins to set in. It is as if a whole level of music and drama is being omitted.

The set is spectacular rather than effective or convincing. The singing is great on the whole; Yevgenii Akimov's unconvincing Don Antonio an unfortunate exception. Larissa Diadkova is perfect as the duenna and Anna Netrebko is charming - if too stagy - as her young charge, Louisa. But for me it is Marianna Tarassova's beautiful Clara that really steals the show. She alone reveals the deeper levels of the music, which is wonderfully powerful and tender, as well as deliciously comic. Her singing was beautiful and effective, and I found myself longing for her to take over every scene.

But perhaps it's my Anglo-Australian sense of humour that is embarrassed by less subtle European comedy, which usually resorts to self-deprecating slapstick. The verdict: it's fun, but one-dimensional.",1172016000,12,1619,5.2471042471042475
2349066,5,B000A0XS18,"I really can't add much to the above, but I too wanted to rave about this DVD. I recently bought this for my opera-expert father-in-law, and now he is raving as well.  It's the top-notch technical quality of the DVD, the superb casting and performances, and the wonderful staging and costumes that combine to make this all so impressive.  Add to that a Shakespearean comedy storyline (women trading identities to fool men, all in the name of love), and it can't help but be delightful.

2349068,5,B000A0XS18,"Prokofiev had just escaped from the horrors of World War II (the Soviet government sent him to a refuge far from the war front); he had also just escaped from an unhappy marriage (he brought his new girlfriend with him, and they collaborated on the libretto for ""Betrothal in a Monastery""). The result was a brilliantly witty score filled with lyric melody. As expected, this production with Gergiev and the Kirov Opera is satisfyingly authoritative. The cast is excellent and Netrebko is outstanding. The sets are ingenious, the costumes are beautiful, and the commedia dell' arte ballet sequences are gorgeous. Audio quality is loud and clear. I am certain that you will enjoy this 20th-century comic masterpiece, this performance, and this DVD.",1140048000,23,747,5.131147540983607

2349070,5,B000A0XS18,"Betrothal in a Monastery Op. 86 is an opera that is based on the comedy The Duenna by British dramatist Richard Brinsley Sheridan. The libretto was written by Prokofiev's second wife, Mira Mendelssohn and is Prokofiev's attempt to adapt Italian opera buffa to the Russian stage. While there can be comparisons between this opera and The Love for Three Oranges, the operas are quite different. Betrothal in a Monastery is more lyrical as part of the musical style Prokofiev developed after his return to Russia. Much of the music in the opera is light and playful. The orchestration is masterful and inventive with Prokofiev's characteristic writing for the lower brass.

This production was filmed at the Kirov opera in 1998 and is conducted by Valery Gergiev, which is an excellent Prokofiev interpreter. Visually, it is a beautiful production. The stage is dominated by a giant fan, which rises to create a fantasy background or lowered to make a playing area for the singers and dancers. Some of the costumes (especially those of the dancers) are reminiscent of Carnival season in Venice, and are colorful and original. It is a fast moving theater, full of movement and color, imitating the Italian eighteenth-century theatrical style. The Kirov Ballet dancers add much to the excitement.

All the singers are first rate. It is apparent that in the Kirov Gergiev assembled infinite reserves of outstanding singers. Luisa is sung by soprano Anna Netrebko. Today she is one of the hottest names in opera. She has a beautiful lyric voice and her characterization is flawless. Her Antonio, tenor Yevgeny Akimov, is excellent too. Mezzo Larissa Diadkova, now very famous in the west, is the Duenna and she is superb. Another mezzo, Marianna Tarassova sings the role of Luisa's friend, Clara and her softer voice suit the role admirably. Nikolai Gassiev is Don Jerome. His vocal and physical acting is outstanding and the veteran bass Sergei Alexashkin sings Mandoza with an enormous nose that was attached to his face.

Technical quality is first rate. It is an outstanding issue. No lover of Prokofiev's music should miss it.",1127433600,60,2124,5.045584045584046

8071934,5,B000A0XS18,"Put this on the shelf with your favorite musical comedies. Sure it is ""opera"", it has 'arias', not 'songs', it has a 'classical' composer, not Rodgers, Kern or even Berlin, and it does have very talented 'opera' singers and not Merman, Martin or Drake...but, nevertheless, the spirit is the same and the goal is the same. to Entertain with song and dance...and, that it does with all the panache of a Broadway show.
Prokofiev provides a first class score for light comedy; that it is more complex than one usually gets on Broadway (save as Broadway passes Lincoln Center and the Met), is all to the good since it is a cornucopia of jaunty melodies and complex rhythms. The composer also co-wrote the libretto, adapted from a piece from Sheridan (not the Union General...who did not burn down a famous Southern city) which propounds and compounds a classic triply mixed confusion of couples in love. It is a joint effort of the Kirov Opera and Ballet companies, each of which scintillates, while the sets are quite satisfactory and the costumes scintillate. Anna Netrebko provides Star quality with a bevy of fine voices while the cast includes,  among standard musical comedy fair, a better than fair Nancy Walker type as one of the lovers....amusing the audience as Walker and her type so often do in musical comedies....and she can sing, too, as the famous line in one such show puts it.
All in all, a classy piece you should buy if you have the money available to do so.
(Caution: if you are Catholic and sensitive about how those in the Church are portrayed, there is one scene in THE monastery which you might find repellent.)",1449273600,4,1631,4.722807017543859
8071935,5,B000A0XS18,"As time goes on, which it always does, Prokofiev's Betrothal in a Monastery will certainly be recognized as one of the comic masterpieces of the operatic literature and most certainly as one of the greatest operas of the last century. It is immediately appealing, utterly absorbing, and frankly hilarious. It is also a fine assertion of man's ability to create transcendent beauty even under the most heart-wrenching conditions.

One of the previous reviewers warned that the music of the opera is ""atonal.""  It isn't. On the contrary, I think that Prokofiev's gift for melody was unsurpassed in the 20th century and in this opera, as in the second movement of the Second Violin Concerto, it is easy to detect the influence of Bellini. (Whose music, by general consent, wasn't atonal.)

As to this performance: Perhaps if we are all good little boys and girls, we will go to heaven and watch an even more glorious performance of this enchanting work. But until then, we should be quite content to have the next best thing--this magical DVD that permits us all to dwell, if only for a few hours, in the heavenly bliss of an otherwise unimaginably gorgeous realm of musical make-believe.

8071938,5,B000A0XS18,"This 1998 recording of Prokofiev's Lyrico-comic opera, `Betrothal in a Monastery' is that very rare thing indeed - a genuinely funny opera. This is in contrast to the many amusing and justifiably popular operas otherwise found in the repertoire. Significantly it is essentially an operatic setting of a very funny play - `The Duenna' of 1775 by Sheridan, a very fine playwright. This story of unlikely marriage arrangements culminating in correct partners as a result of female intrigue (similar to the machinations of Shakespeare's Merry Wives) frequently borders on the farcical without ever descending into pure farce.

Prokofiev's score brims over with wit and entertaining lyrical passages which perfectly match both the script and the rise and fall of the Russian language. The totally Russian cast have a wonderful time with this music luxuriating in its ability to mimic the Russian speech characteristics as well as the built-in humour of the story. It is impossible to over-emphasise the advantages of hearing this opera sung in the Russian language by native Russians whose unmistakable range of musical timbres is so innately valuable.

The individual members of the cast are all outstanding both as singers and as actors/actresses. These range from the three manipulative women sung by a young Anna Netrebko, the hilarious Larissa Diadkova and Marianna Tarassova. The two male victims (father and fishmonger), the well-meaning fop and two suitors are equally fine and portrayed by Nikolai Gassiev, Serei Aleksashkin, Yuri Shkliar, Aleksander Gergalov and Yevgeny Akimov respectively. The cast of dissolute and largely drunk monks are convincingly amusing and obviously revel in their roles.

The Kirov orchestra are well on top of all the musical demands of the score which is conducted with flair by Valery Gergiev. Members of the Kirov Ballet deliver their roles as masqueraders very well and the chorus clearly enjoy their roles as fish-sellers wagging their rubber fish around with relish! The costuming and set are sumptuous as is normally the case in Kirov productions.

This wholly enjoyable entertainment has been well captured on a recording that has good, clear imaging with rich and deep colour rendition. The sound is very good and is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo. The producer is Paul Smaczny who always shows a thorough knowledge of the musical scores he is involved with.

This is a fine production and recording which it is tempting to describe as definitive. Certainly it would be hard to imagine much of an improvement! I would therefore expect it to give purchasers great pleasure and consequently it seems that a 5 star rating is both totally deserved and reasonable.",1343520000,,2703,5.21889400921659
8071939,5,B000A0XS18,"I don't ever recall just breaking into convulsive laughter at any movie (and certainly not an opera) before.  The story is a little slow in developing, but the three romances are all brought to a happy conclusion.  It is the most hilarious humor I've seen in a very long time, and of course Prokofiev's music is very good.

8071940,4,B000A0XS18,"This opera may not have well known or most beautiful melodies, which is the only reason I can't give it five stars; but the plot, the voices, the performances and the costumes are all outstanding. Most important, this DVD has subtitles; so that one can understand the story which, in the case of operas, makes a world of difference.",1213315200,,332,4.6440677966101696
8071941,5,B000A0XS18,"""Melodies flutter above the the lush thicket of Prokofiev's orchestration like cracked crystal dragonflies, defying the laws of musical gravity.""

That's my lame attempt to evoke with words the angular eccentricity of Prokofiev's distinctive style. Nobody with a musical memory would ever mistake a Prokofiev melody for anyone else's. I'm very fond of Prokofiev's music. Though I wouldn't say he's a better composer than Shostakovitch or Schnittke, I listen to him more often, and I do think he's a better composer than his critics claim. Thus I hate it venomously when a rare production of one of his operas is unsatisfactory, and I love it when one succeeds. I love this production immeasurably.

For a modernist charged with using dissonance merely for shock value, Prokofiev is remarkably committed to extending musical traditions. Bethrothal in a Monastery is, formally speaking, a French Baroque opera-ballet. The frequent intermezzi of dance are equally interludes of orchestral development. If the dance is somewhat restrained, all the better for hearing the musical exposition! But Bethrothal in a Monastery is also a Rossini opera buffa par excellence. Rossini could have used the same libretto... and it's a shame he didn't. It would be fun to compare.

Set in 18th Century Seville but based on an English play by Sheridan, Bethrothal in a Monastery is the story of a miserly father and a beautiful daughter, Luisa. The father contracts a marriage for his daughter with an oafish fishmonger, Isaac Mendoza, purely for money. Luisa already has her willful heart set on Antonio, a handsome but impoverished nobleman. Luisa's brother Ferdinand scorns his father's wishes also and wants to marry Clara, who doubts his sincerity. Then there's the Duenna - the title character in Sheridan's play - who aspires to trap Mendoza for herself. Mendoza and the Duenna are broad commedia dell'arte buffoons; the music assigned them is as slapstick as the putty nose of the fishmonger and the clown make-up of the Duenna. Suffice it to say that all three couples are eventually united and the father reconciled to the matches.

Prokofiev himself prepared the libretto in collaboration with Mira Mendelson. It's excellent dramaturgy, concise and quick-moving, offering the composer a vehicle for condensing his musical thoughts scene by scene. The Kirov Orchestra, conducted by Valery Gergiev, realizes those musical thoughts with jolly precision. Bass Sergei Aleksashkin sings the bizarre swoops and bellows of Mendoza with ludicrous beauty, while Nikolai Gassiev, as the father, and Yuri Shkliar, as the pompous old meddlar Don Carlos, likewise succeed in making brilliant music out of clownish roles. The four handsome young folk all sing handsomely, as befits their characters. In proverbial terms, ""handsome is as handsome does."" Physical, musical, and ethical beauty are all congruent in Prokofiev's comedy.

Anna Netrebko as Luisa and Marianna Tarassova as Clara... the whole cast is Russian. A case could be made, based on this production, that all operas should be sung by native speakers of the libretto language. I don't understand a word of Russian, yet I heard the words of this opera as real tongue, with the full expressiveness of speech. Other productions of Russian opera, with mixed casts, have not made this impression. I've had the same good experience hearing Czeck singers sing Janacek and Italian singers sing Donizetti, and the corresponding ill experience hearing Europeans sing Britten. The peculiar vocables of Russian are part of the fun in Bethrothal. I wonder if Russian sounds as bizarre to Russians as it does to ""us."" Listening to Betrothal, I realized for the first time that Prokofiev's queer lurching melodies are precise imitations of Russian elocution.

Carnival is underway in Seville as the drama progresses, providing ample pretexts for a chorus, for dancers, and for fanciful dress. This is a period staging, with splendid sets and costumes. Each character's costume is a manifestation of that persona's moral and aesthetic stature. Fortunately for filming, the principals in this production all look physically convincing, with the gross Mendoza as ugly as an ape and with Luisa performed by the most beautiful woman in the world. I'm serious! If you know of a woman more beautiful than Anna Netrebko, please send me her photo! Her only rival is that Junoesque tennis star, Sharapova. There's an unfair distribution of talents here, friends! Netrebko sings as beautifully as she looks, and she can act, too! In any case, Betrothal in a Monastery is a visual feast.

The musical highlights are the quartet at the end of Act II and the meetings of the lovers in the garden of a nunnery in Act III, where Prokofiev mutes his sardonic jaggedness and lets his melodies flow gracefully.

Then there's the burlesque revel of the drunken monks, so vulgarly anti-religious that it might have served to placate Uncle Joe despite the composer's musical modernism. Satire of hypocritical monks was a standard element of European comedy from the Middle Ages onward, but I suspect ""western"" audiences will feel squeamish at these grotesqueries, as they might about the Jewishness of the greedy Mendoza, even though no overt anti-Semitism is expressed. Remember Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice? Prokofiev's humor is innocent by comparison.

This DVD has it all - great singing, gorgeous visuals, vivid acting, belly laughs, and fine technical work with cameras and mikes. I can't imagine not enjoying it, even if opera is not your usual choice of entertainment.",1211068800,21,5586,5.232402234636871
