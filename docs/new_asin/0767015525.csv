3949,1,0767015525,"The most looked-forwarded to movie of the year for me. Now, the one I hope I can forget the quickest.  I blame it all on the director. Who in Hollywood pays these imbeciles to make a movie like this. How in the world  could anyone ruin a movie starring Fiennes, Connery, Thurman? - Totally  beyond my comprehension. If anyone out there knows  a place I can get an  elective frontal lobotomy, please let me know. Do a service to one in deep  suffering.",914371200,,451,4.373493975903615
3950,3,0767015525,"I approached The Avengers with some trepidation, courtesy of several negative reviews, including one Australian critic who proclaimed it the worst movie he had ever seen. Having been one of just 42 people in the  cinema when I saw the film, I was wondering just how bad it was going to  be. My fears were unfounded. It was entertaining, amusing and suitably  peculiar. I say suitably peculiar as, being a fan of the 60's TV series,  any deviation from the concept would have been totally unsatisfactory. The  movie, set in the sixties, was not a nostalgia trip (something which would  have been a distraction) but still managed to capture the essence of that  period. The plot was as silly as any in the TV series, thank goodness, and  the villain (Sean Connery) was appropriately unbelievable. It wasn't one of  Connery's best performances but he obviously enjoyed hamming it up  outrageously. You have to enjoy it for that alone. Don't fall into the trap  of comparing Uma Thurman and Ralph Feines with Diana Rigg and Patrick  Macnee. They play their parts differently, not better or worse, just  different. The comparison is irrelevant. The cinematography is excellent,  as are the special effects. Overall, a highly enjoyable film that should  appeal to fans of the genre, and Avengers fan specifically. Not a great  movie, but a good production. Its lack of success is unfortunate, and the  bad press overdone. It's likely to attain some degree of cult status within  a couple of years.",912297600,18,1491,4.896

4037,3,0767015525,"This movie has been thouroughly torpedoed by critics and audiences alike - fuelled, no doubt, by the severe lashings Mr. Connery himself doled out during post-production. But while there's plenty reason to dislike it (a plot petering out in an insipid ending, misuse of Mr. Fiennes' acting qualities, discontinuities in the filming, etc etc), there's even more to enjoy, in a camp sort of way.
The scene with Connery in teddybear-disguise is a hilarious spoof of James Bond's Spectre-meetings, some of the Dali-esque setpieces are intruiging and in general the whole film is so outrageously ridiculous that you won't gain anything by missing it, to say the least. Comparisons with the original, authentic, masterly Avengers-tv-series (with Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg) shouldn't be made - the film doesn't stand up to it and if it purports to do so, it's its major weakness. It's just entertaining - more than the weaker entries in the Bond-saga, of which there are several. Particularly neglected (in my opinion) are the hallucinatory opening credits in which Joel McNeely's music blends exceedingly well.",1432512000,,1108,5.230337078651686

There simply is nothing here. A pathetic Steed for sure. It is all imitative and it fails. There is no plot.

4065,4,0767015525,"An awesome action adventure. Creative and involving. Sean Connery delivers a great performance as Sir August DeWynter, an maniacal genius and former British Intelligence agent (?) with an axe to grind with the Royal Empire. He has stolen control of a satellite that allows him to control the weather everywhere on the planet. He is holding the world hostage and has a hefty ransom. So British super agent John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) is called into action to stop him, and he is first advised to bring in Dr. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), a noble prize winning physicist and the number one suspected ally of DeWynter after video footage of her surfaces implicating her in the murder of a high ranking member of the British business community. After he brings her in to meet Mother and Father, they determine she is innocent. But if so, then who is the woman on the video? They decide to team up to get some answers, and start at the home of Sir August DeWynter, where they quickly discover who their enemy is. But he is ready for their every move, and has them both at his mercy in a hurry. But they also soon discover he has a friend on the inside who gave him vital information to help him steal the weather satellite. A mole in British Intelligence. But who? This a exciting and involving action film that has every bit of the charm and charisma of the popular 60's TV series, and all the gadgets as well. It gets a 90's update, of course, but still keeps true to the show at the same time. Thurman and Fiennes have great onscreen chemistry, and as I mentioned, Connery was awesome. The idea of him being a former British agent was a bit cheesy, but still worked well. Brief nudity and mild language are all parents will have to worry about. There's a ton of action and snappy banter, as well as tea. Their was no sequel, which I felt was unfortunate. It didn't exactly kill at the box office, which might be its only downfall. I found it enjoyable and fun.",1425168000,4,1953,4.4581005586592175

4075,5,0767015525,"I find it bizarre how poor so many of the reviews of this movie are.  I love this movie, I've seen it half a dozen times over the years, and I just saw it again, now.

The characters are not robust, and their motivations are shallow.  The script is rather vapid.  The scenes and storyline don't make great logical sense.  But who the heck cares?  This movie doesn't try to make sense, and it KNOWS that it lacks structure and that its characters are in some ways ""silly.""  Not only does it acknowledge these characteristics, but it revels in them.  It takes joy in presenting something fantastical - without strong structure - that is purely over-the-top.

Sean Connery wears a Teddy Bear suit and throws darts.  Ralph Fiennes fights with an umbrella.  Uma Thurman has fight scenes in a hot air balloon, in which the villain is also Uma Thurman.  Jim Broadbent chain-smokes, eats macaroons, and is always in very odd-looking surroundings.  Lightning kills someone and tosses him into the sky.  Giant mechanical bugs shoot at cars.  There are millions of lovely, wonderful, fun images throughout the movie.  The script is borderline witty (but not really), but it certainly sounds nothing like real people talking, and it's fun to escape from reality for a while.  What the heck is not to like?

If you accept this movie for what it is - for what it acknowledges it is and loves itself for being - then you should enjoy it a great deal.

I think everyone fights it too much, wants it to be something that it never tries to be.  What it is - what it tries to be - is so much very, very fun, in itself.  Just don't fight it, expecting plot, coherence, etc.  Let it be.

Granted, I have never seen the original Avengers TV series.  Does that mean that I can't judge the movie?  I think I can.  I can enjoy the movie for what it is, rather than for how it compares to an older television series.",1406332800,3,1890,4.453216374269005

A lot of money was spent on the production design and special effects, but the film suffers from a misconceived premise.  First of all, it's dealing with a witty, effervescent spy romp -- an iconographical series of the 60's -- but it tries to turn it into a darker, insupportable James Bondian (same production designer).  ""Dark"" and the Avengers don't really mix.  The whole production is dark, lots of crashing special effects, derring do, conflict between ""Father"" and ""Mother"" which is never explained.  The dialogue is hard to understand and captioning is not provided on the streaming version.  A problem.

4116,5,0767015525,"In the Nineties it was fashionable for Hollywood to adapt popular television series for the big screen the best being ""The Fugitive"" and the very worst, in my mind, ""Lost In Space"".  There were high hopes riding on ""The Avengers"" in the Summer of 1998 with a dream cast of Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and the iconic Sean Connery.  Things didn't bode well for the film when the film's release date kept getting pushed back.  Things looked even worse when the film wasn't even previewed for the critics and naturally the daggers were drawn when it was seen and the public followed suit.  I saw it in the theatre and was disappointed because it didn't meet my expectations.  But what were my expectations?  Is this a bad film because it isn't the film I thought it should be?  I don't know why I revisited ""The Avengers"" but I'm glad I did.  Common criticisms of the film at the time are these.  Fiennes as John Steed and Thurman as Emma Peel had no chemistry.  Connery as Sir August De Wynter was lackluster as the villain.  London, a bustling city, is oddly bereft of people.  Eddie Izzard as one of Connery's henchmen has no dialogue which is strange for a man who makes his living as a stand-up comic.  For the first two criticisms I'll say the critics are dead wrong.  For the second two I'll say that the makers of the film were making an ironic stab at comedy that may have gone over some people's heads.  Viewing this film unbiased by the criticisms at the time of it's release I'll say it's chief virtues are not only Fiennes, Thurman, and Connery but also terrific supporting work by Jim Broadbent, Fiona Shaw, and Eileen Atkins.

Rating it on its own merits, it's not that bad of a movie-- just kind of silly and dumb and totally forgettable.  Comparing it to the Peel-era shows is what makes this very hard to watch.  First of all, Uma Thurman looks nothing like Diana Rigg.  Jessica Biel would make a much better Emma Peel.  Secondly, this is set in modern day.  So much of Peel's persona has to do with how she twirls her flip or wearing those white gloves.  Without that hair and clothing goes much of the essence of Emma Peel.  Sealing the tomb is a barrage of crappo CGI which makes the whole thing look like the graphics on a fast food cup set to motion.

Should you watch/get this movie? Depends. Can you accept that Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman, as Steed and Peel, are not McNee and Riggs, and are not trying to imitate the TV actors? That, as with King Lear, different actors can bring different qualities, different interpretations, to a role? If you can, yes, get this movie. Fiennes is diffident, where McNee was suave. Thurman is titillating, where Rigg was provocative. Some of the movie is silly; so was some of the TV show. (And remember, The Avengers was picked up by US TV not because it was good, but because it was the 60s, it had spies - and it was cheaper than making a show in the States.)

This will never be the definitive The Avengers. But if you have an open mind, give it a look. Better (IMHO) than another couple of hours with another 'reality' show.

Here, despite three big name stars, the film never quite takes off, seeming instead like nothing so much as a, well, high-budget TV show. In the 60s, the sexual tension between agent John Steed and Mrs. Peel was highly suggestive stuff. Today, it seems quaint, almost literary. Never mind the plot here. It's a mishmash of more Bond crossed with Lord of the Rings special effects. Some mumbojumbo about a megalomaniac controlling the weather. The whole point of this movie is archness.

4134,1,0767015525,"Combine the worst elements of Wild Wild West and Batman & Robin and you get this god-awful mess of a film that's as confused tonally as it is made poorly. And made poorly it is. The score is over-blown & barely fits within a scene, the dialogue is atrocious, the acting is embarrassing to all involved, the plot is convoluted as all get out, and there isn't a single genuinely good moment to be found.

First off, tone. I've never been more baffled as to what the filmmakers were going for than I was with this film. It didn't really strike me as serious, but it never struck me as a comedy or a parody either, or even campy. I've never seen the TV series, but my god, I don't think it had people dressing up in Teddy bear costumes! That's right, Sean Connery, and a bunch of other people in a board room wear teddy bear suits. Why? So they don't know who each other is. Why teddy bear suits? I have no earthly idea. In a way, it's sort of charming in the way ""Toys"" was with Robin Williams and that crazy world, but any charm is zapped by the utter incomprehensibility injected scene, after scene, after painful scene. Sean Connery gets a cane stuck through him, then lightning comes down, zaps him, and then carries him up. Why didn't this lightning bolt strike before? I mean, Sean Connery had the cane with him the whole time.

Then there's the casting. Forget the fact that this is basically Mr. Freeze with weather puns instead of ice puns, and it's being said by the great Sean Connery, the real offender of this film is Uma Thurman. Yes, Uma was in Batman & Robin also, so bad picking skills on her part, but my gosh is she miscast. The actress is from Boston, but the character is from England, and speaks in an English accent, and boy does it show. Oh wait, she also gets to fight her clone named ""Evil Peel,"" and gets to say the line, ""You just saved me from myself."" Yes, that's actual dialogue from this movie. And that's one of the ""funnier"" lines. As for Ralph Fiennes, I don't believe he's actually in the film. It's actually Joseph in Ralph's face, because that's the quality he puts into this. Granted, his character basically gets to fight with umbrellas, drink tea, and speak in a polite British accent, but my gosh, put a little emotion into it!

It's rumored that 50 minutes was cut out of this film right before release, sacrificing a lot of the coherentness to make it a bad movie. Believe me, it was always a bad movie. There's no amount of extra scenes that could make this even a decent movie. It's at its core a bad film. What, are you going to have dialogue explaining why Steed & Peel come to Wynter's fortress in plastic bubbles? Are you going to have dialogue explaining the need to create mechanical bees? The list goes on and on, and in the end, it would have just prolonged the awfulness. As is, it's too long. So stay away from these Avengers at all costs, and go watch those other Avengers. God only knows that a bunch of superheros is more believable and entertaining than those British spies.",1280361600,,3031,4.389679715302491

I can't imagine any harder task than to try to compete with Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg, and face the inevitable comparisons.  No mean task, to be sure, and a brave one.  But Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are wonderful.  Of course, there are many parallels in their characterizations, but they still manage to create their own style and chemistry.  With the back-up of great supporting actors and a witty, caustic script, they make the characters and story their own.

Jim Broadbent is brilliant as Mother.  The sets are superb.  The CGI is well done, and not phony-looking.  Sean Connery is devilish.  The story is clever.

4139,5,0767015525,"Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman and Academy Award winner Sir Sean Connery star in this big-screen adaptation of the popular 1960's television series which starred Honor Blackman, Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg. Unfortunately, a lot of scenes which were in the trailer were deleted from the film after what are rumored to be terrible test screenings, and in the end, we wind up with what looks like an action movie trailer for the real thing (please excuse me for using Ridley Scott's descrption of his own film ""Kingdom Of Heaven"" when talking about the Director's Cut). The original length of the movie is rumored to run aywhere from 115 minutes to 2/1/2 hours. Frankly, I LOVED the movie, but am left feeling cheated because the Director's Cut has not been released. Warner Bros. should plan to release it, as there is a fan base, however small, for this movie. Also, there's a narrative error caused by the editing down to 86-89 minutes-SPOILER AHEAD!!!-when infiltrating Sir August De Wynter's lair, how did the real Doctor Peel know the code words (""How now, brown cow?"") to get into the lair with John Steed, as the line is not heard in the film prior to the scene?-SPOILER OVER!!! I enjoyed the acting of everyone involved, but felt that Sean Connery was underused (and, judging by the trailer and information on another site, most of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor). SPOILER ALERT!!! Patrick Macnee's cameo was good. I guess the reason he chose not to appear on screen (and why Ms. Rigg turned down a cameo in the film) is because they didn't want the cameos to distract the audience from the plot of the movie. It also would have been nice to see Honor Blackman, another Bond Girl, appear in the film as well. Trivia: Patrick Macnee also appeared in a Bond film: ""A View To A Kill.""

4161,5,0767015525,"I know I'm in the minority, but I really did love this movie. I suspect one reason there was a negative reaction to this film was because many people missed the original series. The original series was before my time, so I had nothing to miss so to speak.

Moving on, the movie tries to create a 60s feeling, and to a great deal they succeed. We see John Steed gradually walk through a series of 'obstacles' to test his spy abilities. Uma Thurman and John Steed meet, and right away, we see that Uma Thurman does not always play by the established rules. We are lead to believe that Uma Thurman has sabotaged her own project, and of course we know that that is a little too obvious. So, Mrs Peel and John end up working together to find the real problem.

We then meet Sean Connery who carries some charm and is obviously very intelligent. But he shows his dark side as well. Moving on, we see that Connery's plan is to control the world with his weather controlling device. (Alright. A bit cliche. But this is a 60s recreation, so a bit of the cliche was probably inevitable.) Also worth mentioning is that all the nations of the government are fighting and bickering at the crucial moment and accomplishing nothing. Sean Connery walks in and announces his intentions to control the world. And of course they continue to argue and bicker uselessly. There is something utterly hilarious about how Sean Connery silences the politicians very simply: ""Oh...DO SHUT UP!""

I don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it. But there is a nice 60s charm; there is the right amount of action; the right amount of story; and a nice amount of internal trouble where we should feel safe; and the comedy is well balanced too. And the final showdown between John Steed and Sean Connery is very well done. Also worth mentioning is that John Steed and Mrs Peel work together well without stomping over each other.

Another character I feel obliged to mention is 'Mother.' Rather than being the cliche behind the scenes man, he seems to know that things aren't always what they seem; he is open to reason and the finding of the truth; and when he discovers the truth, he tries to save Mrs. Peel, even though he is old and injured. It's also worth mentioning that at one point he refuses to believe that Steed and Peel have simply vanished, and he sends out a rescue party. (The kind, benevolent, open to reason boss, who knows when he has to face the danger. And just the right touch of being fatherly.)

If you are expecting the original series, you're probably going to be disappointed. But if you are willing to see this in its own light, it's really a nice film. Also a great way to have a 60s night!

My advice is to at least give it a chance.",1251676800,2,2752,4.43960396039604
4162,3,0767015525,"In an age of director's cuts and extended additions, the irony is that the films that need restoration the most are the very ones that never get it. Thus the Weinsteins chose not to restore The Fall of the Roman Empire, MGM/UA chose not only to ignore the existing four-hour rough-cut version of Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade but actually put out a cut version of the theatrical version and the much-troubled 1998 movie version of The Avengers will never be seen as it was originally intended. It's not the catastrophe its often portrayed, but the studio only had themselves to blame for the over-reaction by violating the quid-pro-quo relationship with the press by not screening it for the critics, a public relations disaster that lead to many publications imposing a blacklist on articles about their films for months after and picking it as their turkey of the year.

Warner Bros. 75th anniversary year was certainly not good one, with flop after flop turning their planned celebrations into commiserations. Perhaps in any other year there would have been less pressure on trying to turn an always optimistically surreal cult item into a blockbuster despite increasingly bad word of mouth, but by the time it emerged from lengthy post-production, the film was covered from head to toe in self-inflicted wounds. What had started out with a two-hour plus running time went to a 101-minute compromise cut to a released version that ran only 81 minutes without credits with Michael Kamen's original score replaced by a quickie effort from Joel McNeely as they tried to unsuccessfully make it more conventional to an audience unfamiliar with the series while alienating the original fans. It's just a surprise they didn't try to edit it down further to the length of a TV episode - even the troubled movie version of The Saint only lost its last 20 minutes. In the process they simply turned an interesting misfire into a much shorter, more confusing misfire and ended up with something too surreal for mainstream audiences, and too mainstream for Avengers fans. (The BFI was offered the chance to screen and preserve the original cut in 1999, but all too typically blew it by not bothering to return the studio's calls!)

The loss of the original (and heavily trailered) opening was certainly a huge mistake. Instead of seeing Mrs Peel (or is it?) breaking into and destroying a weather station, something that triggers the plot (a variation on both the original show's A Surfeit of H20 and Our Man Flint with a weather-controlling eccentric millionaire holding the world to ransom), the film now opens with Steed taking on policemen, milkmen and machine-gun toting nannies with only his bowler and brolly - an enjoyable enough introductory scene but not as essential to understanding what's going on. That's just the first of many plot holes the film is left with, but they're still the least of the film's problems.

On the plus side, Ralph Fiennes wisely doesn't attempt a Patrick McNee impersonation as Steed, opting for a more formal, slightly reserved approach that lacks Macnee's effortless bonhomie but works well enough on its own terms. Jim Broadbent makes a good `Mother' and Eileen Atkins (in a cameo originally intended for Diana Rigg) effortlessly steals her few scenes. But if they're all on good form, just about everyone else isn't. Indeed, there's miscasting on an epic scale here - Fiona Shaw overacting for England yet again as `Father,' Eddie Izzard exuding all the menace of a fluffy kitten and Uma Thurman delivering a turn bad enough to make you sorry they didn't cast Elizabeth Hurley as Mrs Peel instead. You feel almost sorry for her and wonder how she ever got another job after this - she can't do comedy, she can't do the accent, she can't do sophisticated, she can't do the banter and most of her action scenes hit the cutting room floor, which reduces her to not much more than a clotheshorse. That there's absolutely no chemistry between her and Fiennes is just another nail in the coffin.

Sadly it's a performance more than matched by what originally seemed the film's great casting coup. Sean Connery, once again showing the keen commercial instinct that led him to turn down X-Men, Lord of the Rings and The Mask of Zorro, gives a career-worst performance in his first role as a villain since 1959's Tarzan's Greatest Adventure and 1984's Sword of the Valiant. Looking like Windsor Davies playing a dirty old man but without the restraint, his introductory single-entendre scene with Thurman is painful to watch as she flounders and he mistimes every line - it's the kind of thing you'd expect in a Robbie Moffat film where amateur actors only get one take and it goes in the picture whether they fluff it or not. It cannot be stressed enough just how absolutely awful he is for much of the film, and considering how often Connery's double stood in for him Peter Sellers-style even on non-action scenes because of the star's feuds with the director and producer (shades of LXG) you find yourself wondering if his better moments may not even be him.

There's a lot about it that's good - the teddy bear scene is spot on and worthy of the original show while Patrick McNee's cameo non-appearance is fun - and a lot that isn't - Roger Pratt's dour photography overcompensates for the primary colors of Stuart Craig's production design and Anthony Powell's costumes. Yet while it's a mess that often stops making sense thanks to the unsubtle re-editing, it's still surprisingly watchable, with just enough moments that do work and give a hint of what could have been to keep you soldiering on through the patches that fall flat. It's just a shame we'll probably never see the film the way it was originally intended to judge it on its own merits rather than the studio's second-guessing.

Not much in the way of extras here - just  a  trailer  and som e  text notes - though the disc does have an acceptable widescreen transfer.",1232755200,,5982,4.838709677419355

4165,5,0767015525,"Prior to 1967, ""The Avengers"" was yielded in black-and-white. Going to color was a definite improvement; however in 1968 there were three additional significant changes:

1. Mrs. Peel (Diana Rigg) was traded out for Steed's new partner, Tara King (Linda Thorson).

2. The producers asserted that the 1968 episodes were more [paraphrasing] ""believable"" -- in fact, just the opposite is true. The '68 episodes are more bizarre than ever, but still very good.

3. There is more involvement by Steed's boss, ""Mother"" (a wheelchair-bound chubby guy who shows up in very strange places to discuss Steed's progress on respective cases).

This DVD package, (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in an attractive cardboard box, this ""Set No. 4"" color-coded RED), is the fourth of FIVE sets for the 1968 episodes. The marketing of ""The Avengers"" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the ""set"" rather than by the ""volume"") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.

Patrick Macnee shrewdly plays John Steed, England's gentleman undercover agent. Linda Thorson is one of several of a line of Steed's voluptuous sidekicks. In the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until years later when these episodes finally emerged on VHS tape. Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when ""The Avengers"" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of this excellent series.

Starting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. There was never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from ""The Avengers'"" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish. The fun continued throughout the final year, 1968, even though Linda Thorson was simply never quite as dynamic or as sexy as Diana Rigg. The '68 filmscore and title scenes at the beginning and the conclusion of each episode were spiffed up a bit too.

Each of these 52-minute episodes is futuristic (at least for the period) and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". You'll encounter, in the 1968 episodes, every nemesis ranging from Eastern spies posing as murderous British Army officers to equally murderous hotel desk clerks.

In the 1968 Set No. 4 (which includes Vols. 7 and 8), we're talking about seven very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes:

Volume 7:

""Wish You Were Here"" - In a parody of ""The Prisoner"" Tara attempts to free her uncle from a hotel which has a firm ""no check-out early"" policy. This is a superb episode.

""Stay Tuned"" - Investigating Steed's amnesia (a returning theme from previous years), Steed and Tara uncover a plot to kill their boss, ""Mother"".

""Take Me To Your Leader"" - A briefcase stuffed with money and a bomb seems to have a mind of its own - and it's giving strange orders.

Volume 8:

""Fog"" - When foreign committee members arrive in London for a meeting, they find themselves stalked by the ""Gaslight Ghoul,"" a Victorian killer with a modern motive.

""Homicide and Old Lace"" - On his birthday, Mother tells tales of an older adventure. The flashback scenes were originally filmed for the never-aired episode, ""The Great Britain Crime"".

""Love All"" - The missile department is leaking secrets but Steed and Tara sniff out the source of the indiscretion. A terrific episode.

""Get-A-Way"" - A prison is having trouble holding enemy agents. The first two escapees knock off Steed's pals... is he the next on the list?

The storylines of the various ""The Avengers"" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1968 continued to escalate the absurdity beyond the previous years' entries. This did not diminish my enthusiasm for the ""The Avengers"" because the overall series always manifested a ""Batman"" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention this only to prepare viewers for this actuality.

The casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Linda Thorson's astounding beauty (tenoned with her great figure!) really accentuates the `60s look in her mod attire.

I'll be reviewing all of the 1968 sets, (as I mentioned earlier, there are five in all, with 2 ""volumes"" per set), so be on the watch for my comments regarding the other sets at their appropriate sites on Amazon.

The story also involves plot twist where one of the head of the secret service(affectionately called ""Mother"") is in cahoots with Sir Wynter.

The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman is non-existent. The mechanical bees and the teddy bear costumes...nice.

4167,1,0767015525,"How can you improve on perfection?  The original series with Diana Rigg was one of the best ever.  It was campy, perfectly synchronized with the oddities of 1960s design, worldview, and style, and told good, short stories.  It was a wonderful world unto itself.

By contrast, this film tries for camp without synching with the times, for an old-fashioned chemistry that it traduces (Emma and Steed had wonderful sexual tension, but everything else was implied, never shown), and for a weird yet believable story.  But it fails utterly.

I have always felt that one cannot improve upon perfection, and, at least as far as I was concerned, the original Avengers was about as close to that as anything can be, and still be man-made.  Because of this, I vowed NOT TO SEE IT!

All right...granted, this movie has a marvelous cast, and even boasted a cameo role for Patrick Macnee (the first -- no, make that the REAL John Steed), but this was just another case where a great cast does not necessarily a good movie make.

Well, I kept my vow for all these years, but finally broke down and recently watched The Avengers, the movie.

OUCH!

Even Sean Connery couldn't pull this one out of the dumpster!  It was painful.  I was only able to suffer through half of it before I had to eject the disk in self defense!  To cleanse myself, I watched three straight hours of the REAL Avengers immediately.

Even Sean Connery fails to save this movie.

4205,5,0767015525,"Hi everyone,

I found this film to be delightful. It's about two agents living in London, England, who are on a mission to stop a well-to-do knight from controlling the weather. By controlling the weather with his large weather-making machine, Sir Sean Connery, incidentally a knight himself in real-life, wants to rule the world, but not if Steed and Mrs. Peel have their say in it!

It's humorous and exciting throughout the movie. Interestingly, the villain of the film played by Sir Sean Connery resides at BLenheim Palace, a breath-taking private residence owned by His Grace the Duke of Marlborough in Oxon, England, which you get to see the massive and beautiful interior in the film,  too!

Also, the romantic restraint of the two lead characters makes a refreshing change from the contemporary norm, which is either based on tease & innuendo, or can't-wait-to-rip-each-others-clothes-off.

4207,1,0767015525,"Being a big fan of Uma Thurman, I picked this up the other day on DVD (much to the dismay of my friends) for only $1 at a local pawn shop. I was curious see if the movie still came across as bad to me as it did when I originally saw it theatrically. Did it??? Please continue reading......

On the surface, The Avengers seemed to have all the required ingredients for a surefire summer blockbuster. You had plenty of star power in the form of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes. There was a 60 million dollar budget to spend and the movie was based on a 60's cult british secret agent series of the same name that had a dedicated and pretty sizable cult following. You also had Uma Thurman strutting around in an extremely tight leather body suit. Everything seemed initially in place to deliver an updated 90's theatrical version that could have been a cool/fun alternative to the James Bond films. But what ended up in theaters was the biggest bomb of the summer of 1998 (and of the whole year for that matter) and one of the worst films ever released by a major studio.

In its theatrical form, The Avengers was a jumbled, murky and incoherent mess that made hardly any sense no matter how hard you tried to figure out what exactly was going on. My friends and I saw it for free back in 1998 despite the fact that it had not been screened for critics (always a terrible sign) and left the theater with a very bad headache, wondering what in the hell we had just been subjected to. The worst sin that this movie commited was that besides the bizarre teddy-bear costumes (I'll get back to those later on!) this movie isn't even enjoyable on a so-bad-it's-good level.

The basic plot involves, more or less, an evil madman called Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) who has built a new weather-controlling device. The British government who has been watching his actions for quite some time. They send two of their secret agents, John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), to investigate what Sir August is up to and to thwart whatever attempts that he is making for world domination.

After the initial introductions to the two secret agents, they begin to check out Sir August's true plans and wherabouts. The movie quickly turns into a series of badly edited action scenes that fall flat every time and a series of scenes that literally make no sense at all in the grand scheme of things.

A perfect example is when John and Emma are traveling in their souped up car near the beginning (complete with a mini-coffee maker/bar), they are suddenly chased by giant remote control robotic bees. They eventually git rid of the pests, but after exiting their car it explodes for literally no reason at all. One of our first glimpses of Sir August involves a sort of meeting with some people to show off his new weather-control device. For some inexplicable reason, everyone is wearing giant multi-colored teddy-bear costumes! It truly must be seen to believed and if the rest of the movie had been as over-the-top and campy as this scene it would have been entertaining on a purely guilty pleasure level. But unfortunately, the rest of the film has the same flat and lifeless feel to it that the opening scenes exhibit.

There's also a completely unexplained subplot involving a clone of Uma Thurman running around that culminates with the real and fake Uma's batteling it out in a poorly choreographed fight in a very slow moving hot air balloon. Actually, that's this movie's biggest problem. Almost everything that happens seems unfinished and unexplained. There are some huge gaps in logic that will surely have any unsuspecting viewer screaming for someone to cut it off.

I read a while back that the original rough-cut of the movie that was test-screened with disasterous results was a little under 2 1/2 hours. Warner Bros. then demanded that the filmmakers cut the film down considerably, which they grudgingly obliged. The producers stated that the revised cut they turned in came in at 101 minutes with credits and they were actually happy with that cut. But Warner Bros. then proceeded to cut an additional 12 minutes from the film and the result was 89 minutes of terrible action scenes and no plot and logic. Do I think that the original cut would be better? It might certainly make considerably more sense, but the movie would still be awful due to some huge problems.

The acting all around is atrocious. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. Ralph is stoic and just looks bored. Uma goes through the movie in a variety of tight outfits (including the previously mentioned leather body suit), but her efforts at a believable british accent are laughable. She tries her best but it is very evident that she was not comfortable with her role and the script in any way. The rest of the cast just seems embarassed to be in this movie.

The film will probably gain some sort of cult status based purely on Sean Connery's over-the-top yet terrible performance. I thought that his efforts came across as way too forced and I've always wondered if he did this movie just to pay some back-taxes or a sizable poker debt. He's been in some bad movies before, but he's still managed to turn in a solid performance (Medicine Man and Entrapment for instance). But in this movie, he's just awful in every respect.

Special effects are laughable throughout with some particularly hilarious matte and model work during the film's climax involving a hot air balloon traveling at about 5 miles an hour and some awful CGI tornadoes tearing up an equally bad replica of London. The final battle between Ralph and Sean is also very reminiscent of Highlander 2 for some reason (in terms of how bad it is choreographed and edited).

I'm not sure what Warner Bros. was thinking with this one. But then again, they did the exact same thing with 1999's equally terrible Wild Wild West (which at least made back most of its budget). While I haven't seen many of the original 60's episodes that this was based, it initially seemed that this had some great potential to be a fun little secret-agent/spy movie, but the execution was botched from all angles. It is clear that everyone involved was hoping for an alternative to the James Bond franchise, but this movie immediately squashed any chance of that. The marketing campaign seemed to focus on Uma Thurman in that tight leather body suit, but even that isn't enough to recommend sitting through this migraine inducing disaster.

(On the DVD front, I'm surprised that Warner Bros. didn't include the ton of cut footage from the original version as deleted scenes. It would have really helped to shed some light on what went wrong with this movie. Much to my surprise, there is actually a cult following for this film that have been petitioning Warner Bros. for quite some time to release the original 2 1/2 version, or at the very least the second 101 minute producer's cut. It's scary to think that some people actually liked this movie!)

What follows are chase scenes from hell; some VERY mannered acting; Sean Connery chewing the scenery as a megalomaniac meteorologist and businessman who wants to, what else, RULE THE WORLD...by controlling the weather. Steed and Emma go after him when it's discovered, unequivocally, that it IS a double of Emma sabotaging her project...and in fact, attempting to kill the original Mrs. Peel!

The cinematography and art direction for this film is EXCELLENT. The music, however, except for the lifts from the series, seems somewhat inappropriate and overly ponderous. There are some hair-raising chase scenes in the film, one with a fleet of mechanical, anti-personnel hornets, and Connery's acting is perfect for his role. The style of the series is recaptured nicely, especially with the villians' confab scene in teddy bear mufti in the middle of the film, and Emma wandering through what looks like M.C. Escher's summer home.

All in all, the phlegmatic bearing of Fiennes and Thurman in the face of it all remind you an AWFUL lot of the original Steed and Emma, and the climax between Steed, Emma, Connery, Eddie Izzard, Fiona Shaw, as the very teutonic-looking ""Father"", (supposedly one of the GOOD guys,) and Connery's henchmen is fairly entertaining.

While it may never win a spot on AFI's top 100, it IS diverting. My one complaint is...why did they have to pick UMA THURMAN...Ms. Box Office Poison herself, to play Emma? Was Nicole Kidman busy? Emma Thompson? Miranda Richardson? WHY A YANK??!! And ESPECIALLY her?? Didn't ""Batman & Robin"" tell them ANYTHING??!!",1092700800,3,2849,5.066098081023454
4224,1,0767015525,"To understand why The Avengers movie so totally misses the mark, you have to understand why the original Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg British TV series worked so well. This requires a bit of historical perspective. Britain in the early/mid-1960s was a culture in which long-accepted norms were threatened by powerful social forces. The youth movement was forever redefining attitudes toward authority and government, Britain was birthing a type of music that would soon sweep the world, and, particularly important to The Avengers, the women's rights movement saw many a woman demand more from her future than a lifetime of housewifedom.

When Diana Rigg's character of Emma Peel was first introduced to The Avengers in 1965, the show had already been going for several years. The character of John Steed was well-established as a conservative, stiff upper lipped, tea drinking, bowler hatted, ex-military, prime example of upper crust middle-aged traditional British masculinity. Then along came his new partner Emma Peel: young, irreverent and outspoken, sexually aggressive, dressed in provocative mod fashion AND possessed of four doctorates. Bear in mind, at this time in Britain it was almost unheard of for a woman to be a doctor at all. Not only did Emma Peel defy that convention, she did it times four.

To John Steed, exemplar of the-way-things-are-and-should-be, Emma Peel was the living embodiment of forces threatening to destroy everything he held dear, everything to which he'd devoted his life, his duty, his sacred honor. To Peel, Steed was the sort of hidebound reactionary she'd been fighting against her entire life in order to be the sort of woman, the sort of whole person her sense of individuality demanded. The great thing about the John Steed/Emma Peel Avengers episodes was watching these two very different people, each representing social forces the other had every reason to despise, over time learn to value and respect what the other had to offer, eventually even to love each other. An endless source of debate among Avengers TV fans is whether or not Steed and Peel's relationship ever became sexual or was simply platonic. Whichever opinion you embrace, there can be no doubt the love and respect were there.

The Avengers TV show was profoundly fortunate in its casting of John Steed and Emma Peel. Patrick Macnee perfectly portrayed the somewhat stuffy, exceedingly proper man of action. The heart of a noble knight in a three-piece suit and bowler hat. But as good as Macnee was, Diana Rigg's casting as Emma Peel was the masterstroke. For Emma Peel to accomplish everything she had in life before ever meeting John Steed, she must have been a high-level genius. Fortunately for the show, in real life Diana Rigg has an IQ that looks like a zip code, as well as immense class, polish, sex appeal, a strong will, and the thespic skills of a successful Shakespearean actress. When Diana Rigg played a high-level genius with multiple doctorates it was believable. I can't imagine anyone else who could have portrayed Emma Peel so well.

So that's why the original Steed/Peel episodes of The Avengers rocked. And that's why the movie is a failure, because it has none of that going for it. It could be argued the social milieu within which the TV series existed, that provoked and informed its subtext, no longer exists and so the movie couldn't have used it anyway. Maybe. But I see no evidence the moviemakers were even aware of it. The props are there, the surface accoutrements, Steed's umbrella and bowler hat, Peel's catsuit, but the conflicts and dynamic that drove the original relationship and made it something truly special are nowhere to be found.

The casting in a problem. Ralph Fiennes tries hard but is hideously miscast. He's too young, too contemporary looking, to portray a rock-ribbed conservative like John Steed. Uma Thurman, though I respect her as an actress, was similarly a poor choice to play Emma Peel. From watching Uma Thurman in interviews I get a sense of her as an intelligent, thoughtful human being, but she simply can't convincingly portray a high-level genius like Emma Peel. Thurman's Peel is more coquettish than intellectual. When Diana Rigg says she has four doctorates you buy it. When Uma Thurman says the same thing, you can't.

There are other reasons to dislike this movie, but none as important as those just discussed. A great television show does not necessarily translate to a great movie when those making the latter fail to understand what made the former great, and the two leading roles are horribly miscast. If you want to enjoy The Avengers, check out the Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg originals, and give this turkey a pass.",1090627200,18,4709,5.015345268542199

Ralph Fiennes was superb as British secret John Steed and gave the character some much needed sex appeal which in my opinion was sadly lacking in the original series. Eileen Atkins produced a classic 60s Avengers style character with her portrayal of 'Alice'. Sadly the Avengers does appear to have been very badly hacked in the editing room at the 11th hour and would certainly benifit from a release of the full length version. 'The Avengers' stayed true to the spirit of the original TV series and visually even improved upon it - Uma Thurman looked almost edible as Mrs. Peel. A fun and highly entertaining movie if you don't take it too seriously. I for one don't know what all the critical fuss is about.

Hollywood still hasn't got the hint that you do not make movies out of old tv shows.  Interestingly enough, The Avengers is a more enteraining film than Hollywood sludge like Charlie's Angels, which is 100% Grade-A Crrrrrrrap.  Why?  Because it is so bad that it actually becomes amusing, unlike Charlie's Angels or Starsky & Hutch which are just plain bad with no amusement at all.  My fascination with the Avengers is just wondering A.) What was the director thinking?  B). What were the stars thinking when they signed on for this film?  The director must be a terrific salesman, coz I don't think Sean Connery is a moron.  C).  Who gave the stamp of approval that allowed this film to be released into our neighborhood theaters?  I mean, this film had to be viewed and approved by the producers.  It was probably shown to a test audience.  How did it slip through all these cracks and make it's way out?  I think of these things as I watch this film.  You wanna see Sean Connery and his band of criminals dressed as giant teddy bears?  You wanna see America's rather shallow view of the English?(tea dispenser in car, lame attempts at British dry humor)  You want to see ZERO chemistry between the leading man and woman?  You wanna see an invisible man?  You wanna see Ralph Fiennes, normally a very good actor, trying to be cool, but actually looking and acting like a total schmuck(this goes for Uma as well)? Wanna see some of the most unexciting action sequences ever filmed?  You wanna see a 90 minute film that feels like twice the length?

4249,4,0767015525,"This movie was actually my first exposure to the Avengers, and although it has received mixed reviews, I am perhaps one of the few that enjoy this film.
I do not try to compare the movie with the television series, which is why I think so many people dislike the film.
If anything this is something that is unique and stands on its own much in the same way 'The New Avengers' cannot be compared with the original series.
I will admit that I think the film could've been a little better in parts, I have a feeling that there are many deleted scenes from this film, and this is something that is simply begging for a Director's Cut Special Edition.
Anyway, I think Ralph Fiennes does an exceptional job in the role of John Steed in that he combines the darker parts of who Steed was when the show started with Ian Hendry, with the charm, wit and sophistication on display during the Diana Rigg era.  Plus, he looks absolutely smashing with that suit and bowler hat.
Uma Thurman is no Diana Rigg, but does make the role of Emma Peel her own in this film with beauty and grace.  And I thought the chemistry between her and Fiennes was excellent.
I think Sean Connery relished playing an over-the-top diabolical mastermind in this film, and you can see that he was just having a ball.
The special effects are awesome, and I think this film could very well be a cult classic, just as long as it isn't compared with the orignal series.  The film obviously won't be for everyone, whether or not you're a fan of the show really doesn't factor into whether you'll like it or not.

Ralph Fiennes has no comic ability, and the lovely and talented Uma Thurman pretty much sleepwalks through movie. These is no trace of the quirky style that made the Avengers so special. To those of us who have seen the TV series, it comes as little surprise that several of the original program's directors went on to success in the big screen . I doubt that anyone associated with this film will find that it leads to more career opportunities. The chemistry between Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee was always a delight to watch.

""Not only does The Avengers make you think that the filmmakers never MADE a movie before, it makes you think they've never even SEEN a movie before.""
That about sums it up. The film has a temporal problem - it's a 90's movie that's a remake of a 60's tv show and it's not entirely sure what decade it's in. It looks kind of 60s-ish then it looks kind of like it's taking place in modern times. The generic 60's English thugs with the mod haircuts look like they've been on ice for a few decades.
Sean Connery is pretty much wasted in the title role. He's blustery and over the top, but it's mostly a great sound and fury signifying nothing. Connery's not nearly as wasted as Ralph Finnes (excellent in Strange Days). Uma Thurman shows that she can't hold a candle to Diana Rigg. She ends up in the leather catsuit but doesn't have much to do once she's in it.
There are some odd bits in the middle where the movie gives a nod to some of the more mind-twisting elements of the series, but with no real effect. The cgi killer-robot bees are at best laughable and at worst downright embarrasing.

Sean Connery stars as Sir August de Wynter, an evil scientist who plans to threaten the world with his hi-tech weather machine which produces such phenomena as tornadoes, hail storms, extreme temperatures, and mechanical insects for good measure.  He makes his intentions known to world leaders and tells them that they must ""purchase"" their weather from him at a very hefty price.
Enter our two heroes, John Steed, played by Ralph Fiennes, and Mrs. Peel, played by Uma Thurman.  Steed is a Bond-like special agent working for a British counter-intelligence agency.  He and his partner Mrs. Peel have been assigned to destroy De Wynter.  Uma Thurman is excellent in her role.  From her high speed driving skills to her cat-like climbing reflexes, she's the perfect counterpart to Steed's intellect and no-nonsense approach.
The special effects were the high point of the film, especially the spectacular weather effects.  The tornadoes and hail storms looked very realistic, and the final battle between Steed and De Wynter is astounding.  I enjoyed this movie for several reasons.  The special effects were the main one, but the rapport between Steed and Mrs. Peel was excellent.

And it's too bad, because, when it came out, THE AVENGERS could've out-sluethed both Austin Powers and James Bond.  It could have had the bizarre Avengers flair with the 007 intrigue and thrills.
Personally, I thought Uma Thurman was a mistake as Mrs. Peel, only because the built-in audience (those familiar with the popular British TV show) would've expected an English girl.
Ralph Fiennes is a great choice and Sean Connery should have been the ultimate villian.
But the movie is incomprehensible.
I'd read that the director was relatively new, having directed only a couple of small, independent films.  Was he overwhelmed by the massive production or did the studio take it away from him to cut it to pieces?  What makes me wonder if it was the former is that Sean Connery's first scenes have him talking with weird, exaggerated tics and such--and then they're gone.  Connery just walks through the rest of the film.  I've always heard that Connery did not suffer fools on a movie set: did he turn on his young director?
I've read the script (which is available online) and I'm still wondering just what in the world happened to this film.

4260,5,0767015525,"""I thought you lived on the edge Mrs. Peel. Is this as fast as you can go?""

I much preferred this movie to most of the James Bond movies. For one, the wit is wicked, Uma Thurman (Mrs. Peel) was born to wear a catsuit and Ralph Fiennes is a most dapper John Steed. This movie has style, yet the backdrop is a special effects surreal dream. If you love storms moving in on a beach, rainy days or just gothic style weather, this is for you.

While drinking tea most often, these two secret agents fight crime in style while resisting the impulse to drown in more than a hands-off sexual chemistry. I could watch these two play mind games for hours. In one scene John Steed is discussing Dr. Emma Peel's profile and states:

""After all, according to your file you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia, based on traumatic oppression leading to outbursts of antisocial and violent behavior.""

Then, he states that she is just his style. Of course, she is not the type of woman he needs to save from herself or anyone else for that fact and more than likely he is describing the other Mrs. Peel who seems much more violent. This Mrs. Peel can take care of herself, thank you very much.

So, what is the diabolic plan they must thwart?  Ah, yes....the evil aristocrat, Sir August DeWynter. He plans to threaten the world with his fantastic high-tech weather machine. He is capable of threatening mankind with raging ice storms, scorching temperatures and mechanical insects. The special effects in regards to the weather are seamless and spectacular.

The script is delicious, the chemistry drips over the edge of the mind into a pool of absolute surging tension and visually, The Avengers is very compelling. You will love the fencing scenes, intelligent script, British humor and tongue in cheek capers.

4261,4,0767015525,"I have seen this movie more than once and I am trying to understand the hostility it has generated. I am old enough to have seen the original TV series the first time around and while I remember it fondly, it was definitely a product of its time. What makes this film so enjoyable for me is that it is not merely trying to copy the old series but to reinvent it. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are John Steed and Emma Peel this time around. No they aren't Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg nor should they try to be. They have created their own version of the characters and they work quite well together. Their overwritten dialogue is overplayed with just the proper restraint. Sean Connery as Sir August, the principal villian, seems to be underplaying his role until you notice his eyes. Watch the eyes of all the characters. They are an important motif throughout the movie. Jim Broadbent's liquid eyes as ""Mother"" are full of knowledge and sympathy while Fiona Shaw's traitorous ""Father"" is literally blind to everything. Patrick Macnee (the original John Steed) has an important cameo as an invisible man. He holds the key to the mystery but he cannot be seen.

Director Jeremiah Chechik (BENNY AND JOON) has created a modern day fairy tale out of the old series while retaining the droll humor and the surreal touches (the brightly colored teddy bears are a good example). Much of the look of the film resembles the illustrations of modern day children's books especially THE POLAR EXPRESS. My only real complaint with the film is Eddie Izzard's use of the f-word. It is totally out of character with the rest of the film and was added solely to get a PG-13 rating. I was hoping the DVD would include the missing footage cut from the film before its release but no cigar.

Even with the considerable talents of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Finnes, this film is just about unwatchable. Poorly edited, poorly scripted and badly directed, films like this are what make movie goers shudder whenever a studio announces they are bringing a beloved TV series to the big screen.

What makes my dislike of this film so disappointing is that I so wanted to enjoy it. Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors and I was looking forward to seeing him as a villan.

And Ralph Finnes has been in several of my favorite films, including Schindler's List and Quiz Show. However, they all fall flat in this film (although Thurman looks great in her Mrs. Peel leather outfit).
The film tries to recapture the odd flavor of the series (the Connery board meeting in which all the participants are dressed as teddy bears, for example), but falls flat every time. Finnes is miscast as John Steed (too young) and he and Thurman have none of the chemistry that Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee had in the original series.

They're nicely paired in one regard, which is that they're both faux sci-fi pieces about bad guys playing on the credibility of others with elaborate frauds.  ""See-Through Man"" is too see-through plot to maintain the suspension of disbelief, where ""Escape Through Time"" is far more cleverly done.  ""See-Through"" is largely an intentional comedy, which makes matters worse, since it's painfully unfunny  -  it's idea of humor is a comic-opera Russian idiot, who, ironically enough, is the same Russian idiot used in one of the previous season's equally spectacularly unfunny scripts.  What it does have is Diana Rigg charming her way nicely through the mess that is ""See-Through Man's"" script.
""Escape Through Time"" is by far the better piece, with Steed and Mrs. Peel trying to find out why several of England's most notorious criminals are being found dead of wounds inflicted by archaic weapons.

Now I do admit that I am to young to understand the better parts of the show, I'm 24. Yet in terms to the movie it was not to bad. The acting could have been better, yet the costums were cool and had that over the top feel that the orginal show had.
Although the toung and cheek humor was a bit lame in the movie and could have been developed a bit more. Uma Thurman did do an okay job playing Mrs. Peel, yet more could have been said about her and personality because she does differ from the TV show. It would have been better of the movie to keep her with the same persona as the orginal Mrs. Peel then add to it to make it more 90's. The same for Ralph Fiennes. He does seem to lose his temper more in the move in contrast to the show. There are plot holes but what movie doesn't have at least one. Most people are right in that some things needed to be explaned better. The editing is really bad in the move.
The Art Department did an amazing job for the look and feel of the move. The same with the FX too simple great. Also with the Visual Effects were stunning. The cinematograph is another thing that saves this film from being a total bomb.
This move seems to wanna reach the post 60's crowd and apeal more to the teens of the 90's. with that in mind this really is not a really bad movie.

I think Ralph Fiennes is a fine actor and whats more I'm Scottish and as is the custom if you're Scottish, I'm one of Sir Sean Connery's greatest fans. He was the best Bond (although Pierce Brosnan's doing a fine job) and great in movies such as The Hill, The Untouchables (even if the accent was a bit ropey), The Hunt For Red October, The Rock, Outland etc. He is a fine ambassador for his nation and the world's greatest living Scotsman by popular acclaim BUT what were you thinking Sir Sean when you made this pile of poo? Didn't you read the script? Or were you too busy banking the cheque?
This movie stinks. Not because a remake of the sixties TV series was a bad idea because it wasn't. Not because the movie didn't have potential because it did. Not because the series had a cult following and the movie had a ready made audience to tap into. No it stinks because it boasts one of the worst scripts ever, with plot-holes you could drive a car through, poor editing, poor special effects, a really (...) supporting performance from Eddie Izzard and perhaps the worst choreographed and directed action scenes you could ever see. Take a bow Mr Jeremiah Chechick (also director of the fine Benny and Joon and the awful National Lampoons Christmas Vacation). The movie also boasts a fine English accent from Uma Thurman but a truly awful acting display not just from her but an incredibly wooden and uncharismatic performance from Ralph Fiennes.
This movie was so bad that Warner Bros. wouldn't even let the critics see it prior to it's theatrical release but word of mouth soon spread about how bad it was and it sunk like a stone anyway. According to Total Film Magazine the movie was originally two and a half hours long and was hacked down to a mere 89 minutes for its theatrical release after a disastrous test screening, thus making Don MacPherson's screenplay (supposedly based on Shakespeares The Tempest) make even less sense. Voted the second worst blockbuster ever made by readers of the UK's Total Film magazine, this movie didn't help anybody's career but particularly harmed Uma Thurman whose previous outing had been the sequally awful Batman and Robin.

The people who developed the film were huge Avengers fans that spent years trying to bring this to the screen and saw it as an art house action movie. When Warner's realized that they didn't have a big budget summer film for 1998,they rushed production on The Avengers, threw a lot of money at it, and more or less told the producers they wanted a big hit. Needless to say, pandering to the masses and doing good ""Avengers"" are incompatible, which the test audiences more or less told the studio execs during test screenings by not liking it at all and getting confused (though I am hard pressed to see how they were any more confused than I ended up) . Unfortunately, take out the sublime strangeness and the film falls apart and makes little sense. Apparently, the studio thought they could rush this out on name power and no real story and maybe make a little money, which is exactly how much they made.
Regarding the film itself, it is gorgeous to look at but painful to watch. The three leads are badly miscast (You can't replace MacNee and Rigg, though Patrick Stewart and Lucy Lawless would have been MUCH more interesting than Fiennes and Thurman) and Sean Connery chews scenery like he hadn't eaten in months. would love the DVD to have loads of extras I am sure are milling about somewhere, including commentary by the director on what happened.

No credibility, no presence, no strength.  Arguably his worst performance to date.
The retro-look is too glib, and a sense of humour sorely lacking. The film tries VERY hard to be surrealistic (with the Baddies dressing up as teddybears and not-quite-but-almost Bond-like gadgets) but everything the desperate producers throw at us is hollow (You can almost hear them pleading with the audience: ""Now THIS is really funny and weird?

Basically, it's the traditional spy story- our heroes battle a diabolical madman with an elaborate scheme for world domination- overlaid with some of the most imaginative, inventive and downright charming imagery seen in any action film.

Throw in a Mrs. Peel clone and a traitor in the agents' midst, and you've got a dreamlike narrative that proceeds to a wonderfully tempestuous climax.

I found the special effects and cinematography to be pretty good also. The character interaction was very weak with very little attention given to the reason that Sean Connerys character for instance had such an infacuation with Mrs Peele-that is just one of many weaknesses i found in this film.

4319,3,0767015525,"Though an ultimate disappointment to AVENGERS fans, and especially to viewers being first introduced to the AVENGERS mythos, the film at least takes a while to show its bad side.  The opening 45 minutes is  smashing-which is perhaps why the ending is so frustrating.
The main  reason for this let-down is not the ridiculousness of the plot. MISSION  IMPOSSIBLE, most Bond films, and even JURASSIC PARK have all had commercial  success with plots that weren't much better than this.  Rather, the failure  of this film comes in my mind from Sean Connery.  If this were the only  example of his acting one had ever seen, one would have difficulty seeing  how the man ever won an Oscar (R).  His performance is truly abysmal.  Yes,  the situations he's placed in and the lines themselves have a certain  hollowness to them, but all meglomaniacs in all action films are, well,  silly.  Though I do think one or two scenes exploring a bit more of de  Wynter's character might've been in order, films have been more satisfying  with less-scripted villains.  The glaring difficulty is that Connery  obviously doesn't *believe* in his character.  It's absolutely obvious that  he's not having fun-even with the good lines.  As a result, we don't  either.
By contrast, Fiennes and Thurman are having the time of their  lives, playing roles that seem to have been tailor-made for them, despite  having originated with other actors.  There are really no scenes which  their presence doesn't immediately help, and one can't help but feel that  if the movie had simply had a different actor cast as the villain, their  chemistry would've gone better appreciated by the viewing public.
(DVD  notes: There are really no additional features on the DVD, which is  surprising.  The production team were all huge fans of the TV show and  spent years trying to bring this puppy to screen.  One would've thought  they'd have been absolutely passionate about trying to explain what had  been a big part of their lives for years.)",961286400,,2006,4.8982035928143715

No matter who is to blame for this travesty, be it editor, director, screenwriters, the terribly lethargic performances from Thurman  and Fiennes (I personally would lay the blame at the feet of the lot of  them), it isn't worth the time or money.
I'm not even much of a fan of  the original, having only watched an episode or two if that, but this- this  is a pathetic film.
There is zero chemistry between the two stars, Sean  Connery hams it up (and with dialogue like his, can you blame him?) and the  plot, as has previously been stated, well.. saying it ""has holes""  is an understatement of the first order.

Unfortunately, the script does not even come close to the  quality of the video transfer or the soundtrack.  The first 20-30 minutes  of the film are an amusing reminder of the charm of the old TV series, but  things fall apart quickly after that.  The perils introduced by the  antagonist, Sean Connery, are unbelievable in the extreme.  No amount of  surreal interpretation can convince the viewer that they are anything but  ridiculous.  The gross incompetence of many characters is evident as both  good and evil fail repeatedly to accomplish even the simplest of tasks to  which they set themselves.  Even if one is able to get past the silly  devices and look only at the story, the narrative is mundane and  predictable.  If it were not for the fabulous transfer to DVD and the  delicious Ms. Thurman, I don't believe I could have gotten any farther than  one-third of the way through this mess.

4341,2,0767015525,"Standing on its own, the film is probably no worse and no better than the average action film: it's more an occasion for special effects,  unexpected situations, special effects, stylish banter, special effects, spectacularly  dispatching the villain, and more special effects than anything else. Seen  from that point of view, noone would complain much about Big Ben exploding  in such a spectacular manner when Sir August de Wynter lets loose his  out-and-out weather attack on London: it's just what this kind of film is  about. They only poison in jest, to borrow an expression
  And seen from  that angle, noone would really expect anything out of the ordinary: it's  just a bit of fun, and need not be very believable. However, the comic  relief that most good action films  produce over a bit of unbelieavable  action is largely missing: the characters are too serious for that. There's  a fairly reasonable fencing scene at Trubshawe's, but when Mrs. Peel turns  her back on Steed and walks away from him, while still defending herself  against his attacks from behind, it goes over the line of being  belieavable, and turns into nothing more than a well choreographed action  sequence in a film, and so becomes a bit obtrusive: my suspension of  disbelief broke down very badly here.
  I came to this film with a  considerable dose of the original Avengers in my memory: in particular the  years when Diana Rigg played Mrs. Peel againt Patrick Macnee as John Steed.  That's probably unfair: the film cannot stand that kind of comparison.
  The original relationship between Mrs. Peel and John Steed is gone. They're  no longer cooperating; instead Mrs. Peel is under grave suspicions of  sabotaging the Prospero weathershield, and Steed is to keep a check on her.  And so the occasionally bright patter, which in the original was more an  expression of the protagonists' relationship, here turns into something  more like fencing with sharp weapons.
  Mother -- that rather poor  attempt to explain ""the Ministry"" for which the original Avengers  worked -- is here, and with Father, looking like Dr. Strangelove's twin  brother, as an extra burden:  one lame, the other blind. Again, my  disbelief-suspenders had a very  hard time with Father.  Colonel I. Jones  is more like the spirit of the original, but that may have something to do  with the fact that Patrick Macnee is ""appearing"" in that cameo  part.
  It's a bit as if a film historian had found a set of reviews, and  some odd script fragments from the original TV series, and then set about  to recreate the original from those bits and pieces, while not entirely  being able to  free himself from an old dream of writing the next big James  Bond film.
  The best way to appreciate this film is to forget the  original Avengers entirely, if possible.  Those who haven't seen the TV  episodes have a huge advantage here.",946166400,2,2889,4.869565217391305

Uma Thurman was a poor choice to play Emma Peel.  Her English  accent sounds awkward and contrived.  Often she accents the wrong word  within a phrase giving the impression that 1) she doesn't understand the  meaning of the lines she's delivering 2) she's reading her lines from cue  cards.

4384,4,0767015525,"There are several people who are critical of ""The Avengers"" and how differently it is from the series. I myself have never seen an episode from the series and can't say if it lives up to the original. The movie  itself was good. It was more enticing to those who have never seen original  episodes then to those that have, because those that have were expectant of  the exact same style. Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Mrs. Peel (Uma Thurman)  work well together. There's a certain chemistry there. Steed seems somewhat  cold, however. He never seems to connect with anybody on an emotional  level. (The same could be said of Mrs. Peel, however, but we see her go a  little crazy at interrigation. Come to think of it, they do seem to know  eachother farely well. They tell eachother about themselves through the  entire movie.) Connery was exellent as Sir August de Winter. The action  seens were good as well, flying mechanical bees and exploding buildings and  balloons. The biggest downfall of the movie, besides not following the path  of the series, would be the confusion it generates. How does the clone of  Mrs. Peel survive the fall? How does Mrs. Peel survive the fall off the hot  weather balloon? How does Steed grab hold of the steel railing after he  falls? Other then unrealistic jumps and stunts, the movie had humor,  action, and class. The only issue that I have trouble swallowing was the  single kiss between them, which Steed throws off as ""scientific  inquiry"". It was a nice kiss, but unnessicary. However, if this is how  Mulder and Scully are portrayed 20 years from now, I will personally go  down to the studio and shove a microphone through the director's forehead.",932688000,2,1689,4.719178082191781

I'm not sure, though, that the original would play  well today without some updating. Like many things from the 60's, it was  something very much of its time. Look at the Connery Bond films...they  wouldn't be as accepted today as they were then.
The time frame within  gives us a context. Without the context, the material doesn't always work.  The original series for all of the well written episodes had episodes that  were poorly plotted messes. Like the Star Trek series of films, the past  seems to add an luster to these dramas that they don't always  deserve.
Still, the original series was always a cut above the average  American television programs. It was always witty and the cast, more often  than not, could pull off the show precisely because of their charm. This  along with the bizarre elements that would crop up in the scripts made The  Avengers always good fun. The film doesn't completely pull it off, but  there are moments that work as well as the original series.
Fiennes  brings his own intrepetation to Steed. To have expected him to play it like  MacNee is pretty unrealistic and it probably wouldn't have worked. The same  goes for Thurman. However, for me she's the weak link in the  cast.

7788558,4,0767015525,"I don't know how this film could be what fans expected. The original was a rather low budget TV action series that couldn't even afford to shoot on film until it received foreign distribution income. It made up in cheek and attitude what it lacked in production dazzle. This film is an entirely different beast. It seems torn between satirising the TV series and paying it tribute, all the while far too aware of the originals camp aspects. Perhaps that self awareness makes some (many?) parts of the movie a bit too ....precious. Still, I was able to finally put that aside and enjoy the film. Ralph Fiennes is exceptionally droll, Sean Connery is unreserved as the scene chewing, kilt wearing mad scientist, and Uma Thurman takes the daunting role of the iconic Mrs Peel and handles it with her usual aplomb. This may never make a list of great films, but I for one found it a rather enjoyable ride and am happy I watched it.",1501459200,,927,4.5568862275449105
