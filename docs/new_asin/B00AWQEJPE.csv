5524652,3,B00AWQEJPE,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  'Starlet' refers to an adorable Chihuahua of the same name, owned by Jane (Dree Hemingway), an actor of the adult entertainment variety. Perhaps Jane aspires to be a starlet herself but is content when we first meet her, to room with two other denizens of the adult entertainment industry, coke-addicted Melissa and her pimp, Mikey, in a small but comfy San Fernando Valley apartment.

  Director Sean Bake has propelled Jane on a journey of redemption when she meets Sadie, an elderly woman, who is selling some of her personal items at a garage sale. After Jane buys an old vase from Sadie, a veritable curmudgeon, she brings it home and suddenly discovers $10,000, in rolled up $100 bills, hidden inside. Jane finds the money does come in handy and decides to keep it. But by the same token, she feels guilty and then attempts to befriend the old woman, perhaps as an act of penitence.

  At first Sadie is extremely suspicious of Jane's motives, culminating in Sadie's pepper spray attack on Jane, as the friendly porn actress drives her home. But now Sadie feels guilty how she treated Jane and decides to allow Jane into her life. There are forays to Sadie's weekly bingo game and later out to the cemetery, where Sadie wistfully places flowers on the grave of her long-deceased gambler husband (perhaps the husband stashed the money in the vase without Sadie's knowledge; or perhaps Sadie just plain forgot the money was inside the vase).

  Meanwhile, there's a sub-plot involving Melissa, who has a meltdown over her alleged mistreatment at the hands of her porn industry boss, with level-headed Jane coming to her rescue. When Starlet drags out the purse containing the pilfered cash, Melissa discovers the stash and decides to help herself to a few hundred for a few car down payments. Jane of course doesn't even notice. Eventually, the second act crisis involves Melissa, in a fit of jealousy, revealing to Sadie that Jane took her money.

  Jane and Melissa perhaps represent the dichotomy in the adult entertainment world. Porn actresses such as Jane, despite their involvement in a world that many consider sleazy, can still operate with their head above water. Case in point: her humanitarian concern for Sadie. Melissa, on the other hand, represents the dark side of porn--she is narcissistic, angry, jealous and vindictive. Mikey perhaps is more the comic relief--even both Jane and Melissa find that the pole he installs in the living room (for pole dancing), is ridiculous.

  Starlet's central problem is the poorly developed Sadie. She's played by Besedka Johnson, a neophyte, discovered at a local YWCA gym. Johnson can do little with a character that is so one-note and who we find out so little about. Some may find the relationship between Jane and Sadie to be touching but ultimately it really doesn't go anywhere. I would go so far as to say that the appeal of the relationship is strictly sentimental at its core. Nonetheless, Sadie's decision not to listen to Melissa's tirade against Jane, and ending up going with her to Paris, is proof of the film's inherent optimism.

  In the end, my feelings about 'Starlet' are ambivalent. I found the scenes involving the machinations within the adult entertainment world to be somewhat interesting. Less so with the perfunctory relationship between Jane and Sadie. 'Starlet' wins points because it suggests that even a porn actress can have a good heart. It also does well in examining the flip side: the aforementioned dark side of porn, embodied by the character of Melissa. Ultimately, the relationship between the principals proves to be too ordinary and lugubrious, to be considered dramatically effective.",1360022400,2,3729,4.982258064516129
5524653,1,B00AWQEJPE,"This movie hasn't much of a plot. Jane, a small time porn actress befriends an elderly woman, Sadie after buying a vase from her and discovering thousands of dollars therein. We think shes helping the woman because she feels guilty about taking her money; however, the ending implies that Jane may be the reincarnation of a very close relative, so her motives may actually be subconscious.

Sadie's recipe for a perfect bowel movement is ridiculous. Sadie, if you want a perfect bowel movement, you should eat a half cupful of oats and add two tablespoons of ground flaxseed to them. Youll never use laxatives again.

One of Janes fans tells her she has a beautiful vagina. Do you really think the perverts who watch hardcore porn would ever use the word vagina? They would use some other word and if you ever saw GOLDFINGER, you know what that word is, don't you Miss Galore?

This movie was named after a dog. Thats appropriate. This movie is a dog.",1442188800,2,951,4.648809523809524
5524654,4,B00AWQEJPE,"My good  friend, Besedka, was in this movie.  Great story as to how she got this part.  She had just moved to L.A. from San Francisco and was at the YMCA swimming pool.  A women went up to her and asked if she could take her picture.  She said ""Sure"" and thought ""crazy people here, why does she want my picture"".  A few days later the woman asked if she would like to try out for a movie and that they would pick her up at her home.  Again, she thought ""crazy lady, this must be some kind of gag"".  But Besedka was adventurous and agreed.  She passed away a year after the release of this movie.  It was a good ending to her life.  She was a character and is dearly missed.",1433635200,5,674,3.992481203007519

5524656,4,B00AWQEJPE,"One would think there's not much more to say about the empty life of druggy, fringy youth in L.A.'s San Fernando valley. But this film messes with our expectations in lovely ways, and ends up as a comedy-drama that's human and surprising.

Calling a film like this 'little' is no pejorative. If it was 'bigger' (budget, stars) it probably would have had it's jagged edges shorn off, and with them would have gone much of it's special-ness.

The acting is terrific. Dree Hemingway makes the air-headed, hottie lead wonderfully vapid and annoying  at first  and lets us only slowly come to appreciate her humanity underneath. Besedka Johnson, in her film debut as the 85 year old that Hemingway stumbles into an uneasy friendship with makes her character equal parts spiky defensive exterior and vulnerable, needy center, giving reality and depth to this sad, touchy recluse.

The photography is also very evocative; its ugly, bleached color and slightly off-kilter but deliberate framings are far more interesting than is common in a micro-budget indie. And the film makes some brave choices, like a few seconds of extreme and un-simulated sexuality that makes points about character and our perceptions by being both shocking and banal at the same time.

My only real frustrations were that a few of the plot twists felt forced  too neat and coincidental for a film this grounded in feeling 'real'. But that was nowhere near enough of a problem to keep me from feeling very warm indeed about this odd-ball character study.",1425686400,3,1522,4.968503937007874

5524658,4,B00AWQEJPE,"This is one of those films that is absolutely unassuming and yet totally engrossing. It stars Dree Hemmingway as Jane a 21 year old worker in the `adult entertainment industry'.  She buys a Thermos in a yard sale one day and on getting it home finds that it is stuffed with cash. She tries to take it back to the cantankerous old woman, whom she bought it from,  but is rebutted.

So she engineers a way to be a `Good Samaritan' to Sadie (the late Besedka Johnson) with her faithful lapdog in tow - this is `Starlet' of the film title. What starts out as marked for failure in the relationship department soon blossoms into a real friendship. However, Jane lives with Melissa and Mikey - Melissa is one of those people who think the Universe revolves around them and everyone is here to do her a favour; so she finds it strange that her `besty' is hanging with an old lady and won't let it lie - to say more is straying into the realms of plot spoiling.

As I mentioned this is a film that plays out slowly but it is interesting all the way and actually quite a lot does happen. Dree Hemmingway is superb as is the pooch but then there are convincing performances from everyone.  Director Sean Baker has made a film that will stand the test of time and has a subtle yet simple message about friendship. If you like your films a bit quirky and are prepared to take a risk then I think you will be happily surprised with Starlet.",1405123200,5,1427,4.309701492537314
5524659,3,B00AWQEJPE,"This movie was about a girl who is trying to make it in the porn industry. She questions her integrity on weather or not to keep a jar of money that she found in a vase she bought from a old lady at a garage sale.
Kind of sweet ... wish it had more dialogue, and the plot could have moved faster.",1402531200,,296,3.7903225806451615
5524660,5,B00AWQEJPE,"I'm about to tell you something so shocking you might not believe me.  Something so incredible that only a talented writing team such as the ones who wrote Starlet could come up with.  Other than one particularly offensive and raw 2-minute scene, this movie is almost completely clear of any signs of pornography.  Absolutely amazing considering Starlet can't be mentioned without bringing up its storyline connection to the adult film industry.

Now I've been told (or rather I read- I know nobody personally involved in the adult film business) that Starlet accurately portrays what it's like to be a porn star.  Judging the way these character act and interact with each other and the noticeable sense of lacking direction and immaturity they possess, I can actually believe it.  It's just incredible how the movie dances around such a touchy subject without being offensive (except, again, that 2-minute segment I mention above, which is undoubtedly a VERY rough and potentially uncomfortable 2 minutes for those turned off by such strong sexual content- you've been warned).

I can imagine the porn lifestyle is dominated with heavy drug use, lots of partying and drinking, sleaziness, sitting around playing video games as a way to pass the time, being lazy/lacking ambition, low self-esteem and basically being a total bum all because they make so much money they don't really need to do anything else.  This is all well presented in Starlet and done so in a way that would feel natural to a porn star so while watching Starlet they'd be able to say ""Yes, this is what it's like!  I can relate!""  I can seriously imagine them being able to relate based on the very believable acting performances.

And by the way I know for a fact not *all* porn stars fall under this category.  Many of them are more productive and civilized than the ones you hear about in the news or see portrayed in movies such as this, but unfortunately this is a very small category.  In fact Starlet proves not all adult actresses can be lumped together better than any other movie you will probably ever see.  While one of the actresses (Jane) is more outgoing, adventurous and kind, her roommate is more vindictive, unambitious and drugged out always in pursuit to make sure she gets the right amount of money she's earned (which is a scene you will discover later) and though her attitude is way out of line during this particular part of the movie, her intentions and reasons for doing so are arguably fair.

Starlet is best described as a drama with elements of comedy.  In fact the comedy is mostly reserved for the beginning while the story is being told and the characters are yet to establish themselves, and the tone gradually shifts when the roommate/friend named Melissa (real name Stella Maeve) gets more attention.  Let me describe what Starlet is about without spoiling anything (which is something the wiki page on Starlet didn't do I'm afraid- wow do NOT read that page!  They spell out the entire movie word for word in the order the events happen!)

It's about a young, caring and compassionate adult actress played by Drew Hemingway (named Jane in the film) that buys a thermos at a yard sale, and upon bringing it home discovers it's loaded with all kinds of cash.  She doesn't tell her roommate Melissa or Melissa's boyfriend (who Jane is living with).  Nope!  Instead she keeps and hides the money for herself.  Now this is where the movie gets interesting.  Jane wants to return the money to the old lady at the yard sale where she bought the thermos from, but... the old lady turns her away and tells her to leave.  Gradually, throughout the movie, Jane becomes friends with the old lady.  They hang out together, eat breakfast together, go to bingo together (including a hilarious bingo segment near the end)... all while the old lady reluctantly accepts this confusing newfound friendship (and understandably so) without having a single clue what Jane does for a living.  The old lady presents herself as a stubborn, often cranky but ultimately responsible and firm woman who just needs assistance getting around town.  This leads to more humorous and carefree segments thanks to Jane either creating mischief or mischief finding her!

When Melissa discovers the money in Jane's bedroom by way of Jane's miniature (and adorable) dog chewing on it one day while Jane's away, this is when things get interesting.  Melissa doesn't confront Jane or ask her any questions initially. Rather Melissa plays it cool for a while but with an attitude proving she knows *something* but isn't speaking out, so for a while you're not sure what's going to happen when the money is finally mentioned.  I don't want to discuss anymore for fear of spoiling too much.  All I can say is that this movie is appropriate for anyone over the age of 22, and without that one sex scene I mention above, it would probably be appropriate for a broader age group.  The subject of sex isn't really brought up very often as shocking as it is to believe.

Anyway the relationship between Jane and the old lady is really amazing.  You'd never guess that someone who does what Jane does for a living would present herself so open-mindedly and friendly, and this goes to show that perhaps I personally shouldn't judge others based on their professions (not that I do... well okay when it comes to the adult industry I think we're *all* guilty of judging them, right?)  The only thing that seemed off to me was the ending.  I didn't quite get it.  Actually I got it but I thought there was an extra something to it I may have missed so I had to search a website that explained the ending.  Apparently no, that's it.  It's sad but wraps up a fantastic story.

Overall, very VERY good movie.  I highly recommend it.  The writers got this one right.",1397001600,,5818,4.74726368159204
5524661,5,B00AWQEJPE,"The blu-ray i received from netflix of Starlet would not play.  In fact, it crashed two different blu-ray players.  I'm sorry to have to post this, because it's not the filmmaker's fault, it's the quality control of the distributer, Music Box that deserves the blame.  I'm just a regular guy, but I don't know anyone who can't master a friggin' blu-ray.  Somehow, this modern skill has escaped the technical experts at Music Box. I probably won't try to rent this film again, there are too many independent offerings to see.  All said, I can't bring myself to give this film a poor rating;  just want to warn other consumers in case they encounter the same problem.",1395014400,,665,4.689655172413793

5524663,4,B00AWQEJPE,"This is an indy flick to the nines. It has an interesting story but the ending puzzled me.

Here's the scoop. Jane is an adult movie actress. She rents a room from Mikey and Melissa. He sell drugs. She also acts in adult films. Jane has her little dog starlet and takes her on a garage sale junket to get stuff to fix up her room. She buys a thermos, from an elderly woman, that she wants to use as a vase. When she gets home she finds the vase is full of rolled up bills to the tune of about 10K. She is compelled to go back to the old woman to see.....what? If she would even miss the money? Is she destitute? But a relationship develops between the two as Jane's friends' situation deteriorates and things go south.

This is a cool flick. Good writing. Particularly as concerns the characters. Jane makes adult films and seems curiously passive about it. She seems to not think much about it one way or the other. Melissa, on the other hand, is a total stroke, loser. Gets too high too often, can nowhere near manage her finances and is always coming apart at the seams. Mikey wants to be bigger in the adult film industry but has nowhere near the skills. Then there's Sadie, the elderly woman. What's her story? Married to a professional gambler who died from a heart attack. Left her oodles of dollars and no kids. Or were there? You see her suspicion of Jane straight off, but her walls get worn down. A relationship does develop but what's really happening? Is Jane merely guilty about not telling her about the money or is Sadie a mom she never really had? Is Sadie just lonely or is Jane the daughter she once had and lost. The final scene in the cemetery might be the key.

This is very indy. A lot of hand held camera, natural lighting and real sets. If you like a good indy flick, this should do ya.",1380844800,,1811,4.274052478134111

5524665,5,B00AWQEJPE,"""Starlet"" was startlingly GREAT!!
I watched it on another site, but it's so good, I'm gonna buy it.....from Amazon!!
And best of all, I'd never even heard of it before I stumbled across it!
The movie is an ""indie"" about a young girl who does porn movies, but let me stop right there, and explain something.
It does NOT really matter that she's a porn actress!
While you see her ""doing her thing""....ONCE!.....that's it for the sex and nudity.
(Well, her witchy (rhymes with -----!) housemate does bare her bottom at one point!)
Anyway, the REAL story has to do with the girl buying a thermos at a yard sale, and finding wads of large bills inside!
When she tries to return the money to the VERY old lady she bought the thermos from, the woman interrupts her, and with one thing leading SEAMLESSLY into another, this mis-match become fast friends!!
Every scene is filled with great flowing dialogue, drama, comedy, poignancy, and finally, insights into secrets held.
BTW, ""Starlet"" is the name of the young girl's dog!!
This was a wonderful ""find"" for me.
And now that I've found it, I just wanted to help others to enjoy...and LOVE....this incredible movie!!",1375056000,2,1158,4.737623762376238

For most people this would pretty much end any soul searching over whether to keep the money, but the young woman isn't easily put off and she slowly insinuates herself into the old woman's life and they become friends, of a sort.  This isn't the heartwarming Hallmark Hall of Fame movie that the premise suggests, thank god.  Both characters feel like real people and their performances are marvelous.

5524674,5,B00AWQEJPE,"This VERY low budget Indie by Sean Baker won the prestigious Altman Award for 2012. I was compelled to find out what the fuss was about.

Imagine my surprise; a well-written, well-crafted, simple story about integrity, good intentions and issues of the elderly. I won't give away some of the more sensational plot-points, but the plentiful DVD extras explain that first impressions should not make one judgmental regarding the true make up of a person. The talented Mr Baker lets you know these people before adding an interesting element that may shock some (I found it mildly amusing).

Dree Hemingway is remarkable as Jane, a girl new to the San Fernando Valley, staying with friends while she establishes herself. She buys a thermos from a cranky old lady at a yard sale (the magnificent Besedka Johnson), later to find out there's $10K inside. This makes Jane uncomfortable, and she attempts to find out if the old lady might really need that money, a guilt-complex that results in an adventure of stalking, friendship, fondness, understanding and genuine love.

At age 85, it was Johnson's first film role, and she handles it like a pro. It's Jane's integrity and perseverance to know this old woman that is the gist of the film, a sweetness that can't help but move the viewer. It's a beautifully controlled relationship starting with suspicion, mutual interests, leading to genuine caring. I was totally taken in. The film still resonates with me, though I saw it over a week ago.

I won't give away the other plot points, but there are terrific supporting players; Stella Maeve as Jane's stoner best friend, Melissa, and James Ransone, great as Melissa's manic, stoner boyfriend.

It is to Mr Baker's credit that he let you know the sweetness of Jane before he drops the ""bomb"", about one-third into the film. A great lesson to not judge people before you know how good they can be.

It's ""Not Rated"", so be prepared for some surprises. A delightful film, in many ways, and a landmark film in pacing and development.

5524676,4,B00AWQEJPE,"The only character in this movie that is 100% likable is the dog. Which is perfect. That's real life. The others are weak, sad, and bored. Kind of mean. And beautiful- Dree Hemingway's and Stella Maeve's looks are the 'blink blink it's a movie' factors that makes their characters unauthentic. They seem like real people. Addicted, numb, and desperate for human connection.

The photography and music reminded me of The Virgin Suicides and King of California. As I write that I realize Dree Hemingway physically resembles both Evan Rachel Wood and Kirsten Dunst. The take away - she does not have an original face, but she is totally watchable. - This is the dreamy, dry, hazy L.A. - Good score. Uses one of the repugnant songs ever in the best ways ever. Bravo. ""Crazy bitch"" may fill me with more furor than any other pop song.

Besedka Johnson as Sadie is heart breaking. She is a strong lady. She demands respect. She doesn't reel from foul language. She has her marbles. She is appropriately suspicious, but eventually grateful for Jane's attentions.

An enjoyable film if you like this sort of thing. To utilize film review cliches- slice of life, indie paced, unsentimental, sticks with you. I'm a Northern Californian. I've always had a foreigner's fascination with Los Angeles. I don't spurn and spit at it like my fellow Yay Bareans, but I know it's not for me.

In fact, the sex workers (in this film at least) look at it as ""just another job"" with absolutely no regrets or emotional conflicts.

What could have been a moving and compelling look at life in Los Angeles and two unlikely friends was ruined by gratuitous porn scenes. No, it wasn't hard core porn but it was certainly more than I expected a legitimate model and actress to do in a film. It was more graphic than what you might see on HBO or something like that.

The film did not need that type of thing to make its point. She could have been a struggling actress as the film title suggests. The porn scenes don't add anything to the film or character so it seems they are only there for the prurient viewer.

I had more fun watching the absolutely adorable dog, Dree's character's pet in the film. The dog's name is Starlet although it's a male dog. People should know what is in the film in case they think it's a sweet film about a grandmother and surrogate daughter and try to watch it with their own parent or grandparent. I was very disappointed that the movie 'went there' when it didn't have to. Still, Dree as an actress shows promise. If only this could've been a career maker for her and her co star.

5524683,5,B00AWQEJPE,"This is one of those thought-provoking movies that captures the human spirit. I truly believe that the success of this film is attributed to the fact that the filmmaker, Sean Baker, worked with a limited budget and preserved its indie status. Hence, he wrote, directed, and personally edited Starlet without interference from a big studio. Another advantage of working with limited resources is that you attract actors and crew members who are motivated, committed, and passionate about the project. Commentaries featured in the DVD confirm this.

It's been days since I watched the video, but I'm still reflecting on the interactions between Jane and Sadie, especially the ending scenes. I'm looking forward to future film projects from Sean Baker, Dree Hemingway, and Stella Maeve. Sad to learn that Ms. Johnson passed away last month. Her first and only acting role in Starlet was superb.

Additional thoughts, which include spoilers:

I can't say enough about the clever screenplay, with its numerous twists and subtle details, which will attract viewers drawn to cerebral storylines. The source of the money found in the thermos is one example. Did Sadie hide it there or was it left there by her late husband -- a successful, professional gambler? The amount, denominations, how the money was wrapped, and modus operandi of gamblers would indicate the latter. The revelation that Sadie rarely ventured out (not requiring use of the thermos) after becoming a widow seem to support this theory. Yet, in the closing scenes at the gravesite, we learn that Sadie's husband died in 1969, but the ""Benjamins"" displayed in the film appear to be versions designed/circulated much later. Hmm...",1367971200,,1690,5.183150183150183
5524684,5,B00AWQEJPE,"I feel fortunate that a good friend recommended this to me without telling me anything about it. He told me to avoid reading reviews so nothing was spoiled and I would say the same to others. It's best to just watch the story unfold and form your own ideas and feelings about what you see.

I felt like I was watching real people, more than I do when I watch some documentaries. The look, thoughtfulness and realistic characters remind me of some of the best American films that focus on relationships produced in the 70s, like Kramer vs Kramer. Now it's often good independent films like Starlet that seem to step back more and allow us to think and feel things more naturally as we watch.",1367193600,6,690,4.476190476190476
5524685,4,B00AWQEJPE,"Wow, what a treat this movie was.  The acting by everyone especially the older woman was so real.  The story is about the friendship that develops by an elderly woman and a young woman who is fresh porn star from Florida.  A special award should be given to the dog aptly name Starlet (he is a boy though), he was cute and wonderful beyond words....he is a real treasure.  Please see this movie, I am not one who gives good reviews unlike many others on Amazon.  I hope that the director stays independent, I am afraid he will lose his magic if he goes Hollywood mainstream and starts casting the actors without any range like Jennifer Aniston and Leonardo DiCaprio.",1366848000,,666,4.516666666666667
5524686,5,B00AWQEJPE,"This is a great movie, with multidimensional characters and a humanist depiction of underrepresented factions of women.

It also has some super hot surprises which are nice to look at.

Visually it's really enjoyable, Dree Hemingway, Besedka Johnson and Stella Maeve each give dynamic & distinct performances.

If you are open-minded, this film will inspire your curiosity and possibly shake you up.",1364169600,,399,5.403225806451613
5524687,5,B00AWQEJPE,"I don't want to say much and spoil the film like some other reviewers. I'm glad I walked into the film without knowing anything about it besides the trailer. Knowing in advance what the girls did for a living would spoil it for me. I liked it because it looked like very realistic depiction of the San Fernando Valley. A slice of life of some 20 something girls in the valley. Nothing more, nothing less. The dialog seemed improvised on the spot. Not much of a plot but that didn't bother me. It was like a John Cassavetes film from the 70s. Some people like them, more people hate them. I just saw ""Spring Breakers"" which I also liked and I thought they were kind of similar in the sense that they both portray young ""bad"" girls in a voyeuristic kind of way but ""Starlet"" does it much simpler without guns, shootings, fancy cars and a cast of thousands.",1364083200,4,854,4.377358490566038
5524688,5,B00AWQEJPE,"If you're looking for a non-Hollywood derivative ""buddy"" movie and can handle some of the more shocking elements, you should absolutely check this movie out. I caught Starlet in theaters during its limited run and was very impressed by the film. I knew where it was headed so some of the surprises in store were already known, but even so, it didn't detract from watching the solid relationship between the two lead actresses evolve on-screen. Really wonderful work that should be seen if you want something different!",1361750400,2,518,4.9655172413793105
5524689,5,B00AWQEJPE,"STARLET is a sun-bleached Valentine to L.A. exploring the buoyancy of lies. Pleasingly unaffected and promising in style. Lead perfs are lovely. There's a bit of the Greta Gerwig in STARLET's star, Dree Hemingway. I mean that as a big compliment. One of those rare American films that is so thoughtfully observed and sensitively captured, it gives me hope for the indie landscape.",1361404800,6,380,5.0476190476190474
5524690,5,B00AWQEJPE,"I'm so happy it's already out on Bluray and DVD! Starlet was one of my favorite movies of the year. Absolutely in my top three. It completely caught me by surprise. I really don't want to spoil too much because the beauty of this film is to discover it on your own. Nonetheless, I think I can say that the performances are outstanding. There is such a natural way in which the actors exist in the film. It all feels so natural. Dree Hemingway's work is truly impressive and inspiring. The film carefully takes you in. There is a new revelation in every scene, subtle or big, the film never stops surprising. The film is harsh, sweet, naive, mature, it just is what is has to be when it has to be. I love that. A beautiful thing is that this film never ever judges any of its characters and truly makes you think that nothing is what it seems. Starlet is pure honesty. I feel that the director and people involved made this one from the heart. There is nothing better than an honest piece of work. Thank you.",1361145600,22,1007,4.3052631578947365
5524691,5,B00AWQEJPE,"There's a feeling in the movie that makes the spectator relate with; an every day life loneliness,  a void that we try to run away from but in the end its always there... and in between that, what seems to save us: finding am accomplice for that feeling. sharing it without even mentioning it.
The story is minimalistic.  Silences are beautifuly placed and tell the audience more than what would dialogue do. Or at least, it gives the audience the space to relate with the movie, and fill the blanks with those feelings.
The music and photography are there to back up the mood of the film amazingly.  I fully recommend it.",1361059200,12,622,4.535714285714286

I know movies today aren't Mayberry characters anymore, but these people are today's heroes? It's a shame. Outside of that, a lot of talented people involved.",1526947200,,334,4.775862068965517

8558526,4,B00AWQEJPE,"Starlet is an unexpected gem. What at first glance seems to be a shallow Harold and Maude for the Van Nuys porno set morphs into a moving meditation on loss, giving up, mothers and daughters, and redemption. Dree Hemingway plays Jane, the whore with the heart of gold, with a blank, insouciant innocence and quirky charm that is endearing. Whatever her reasons for doing what she doesand she does a lot of wonderful things for her elderly friend, Sadie (Besedka Johnson)her actions are childlike in their goodness (It would have been much easier to return the money.) An education in ethics from an unusual source, and a movie that will leave you overwhelmed at how works of art can touch wellsprings of emotionpity and fear, but also empathy, compassion, and identification. Of course, the porno thing kind of just lies there and the audience is left to wonder how women like Jane and Melissa (the excellent Stella Maeve), really do negotiate the hazards and exploitation of the industry. If Melissa is the typical story (addiction, apathy, self-loathing), then Jane somehow floats above all that. I wonder if the filmmakers wanted us to imagine Jane after the end of the film. Are we to assume that she will turn out like Melissa in the end? Excellent film, highly recommended.",1475971200,,1279,4.871559633027523

I HIGHLY recommend STARLET!",1446854400,2,271,4.489795918367347
