7695626,3,B01D01K5L4,"This movie was better than I expected. The storyline was a bit jumbled but not incoherent. If you like possession type movies then you will probably like this. Given that the vast majority of Prime eligible horror flicks are beyond terrible and look like they were made for $20, my expectations were low going in. But it looks like there was some production work put in and at least one of the actors I've seen in something else. This is worth a watch if you like this type of movie and have seen most of the other movies that require a rental fee.",1468713600,8,548,4.330097087378641
7695627,5,B01D01K5L4,This was a really well thought out movie. I totally enjoyed the ride.,1468627200,,69,4.384615384615385
7695628,4,B01D01K5L4,"Overall a good little scary movie. Fun for the novelty of seeing inside the site of the original exorcisms. Doesn't have the gore and splatter factor some people may be looking for, so I guess there may be some disappointment there, but it's good for what it is, and better acted than most indie horror flickers. I have the PAL version from the UK and have to say the box art's better than the US box.",1466985600,,401,4.2894736842105265
7695629,2,B01D01K5L4,"This is not a story based upon the REAL EXORCIST in St. Louis. It is a fictional continuation set in modern times presumably at the same location. Amy (Amy Holland Pennell) wants to buy the house along with her cop boyfriend Luke (Mark Holzum) from her cop cousin (Connor Trinneer). This house has been in the family and was where our 14 year old boy had an exorcism.

She gets the house. Things happen.

There were a number of issues, one was the sell point making me believe I was going to watch the 1947 exorcism. The script proved to be tiresome, unable to decently close it out after an hour of build up. They find the 1947 teen's schoolbook from when he became possessed. It had first grade math and third grade printing and drawings. The house had been ransacked yet, not looted and the wall with the old family photos had no graffiti as did the rest of the house. Photos and newspaper clippings from 70 years ago showed no signs of yellowing. The demon special effects were two-fold: Black contacts and a silly voice enhancer.

Supposedly there was something paranormal caught on film left in the production. If there was, I didn't see it. I thought I saw a shadowy reflection in the window, but that was just Connor Trinneer that moved with him.

I enjoyed Amy Holland Pennell acting at the beginning of the film. I thought this was going to be a decent low budget flick. Then the whole film became possessed with laziness. 1 1/2 stars

7695634,4,B01D01K5L4,"The ending was kind of weird. Since it was based on a true story, I'd have preferred something different.",1478563200,,105,4.578947368421052

7695639,4,B01D01K5L4,Not bad for a low budget,1476403200,,24,3.1666666666666665
7695640,4,B01D01K5L4,"It was a good movie. I really liked it and would highly recommend it, but it is not comparative to the Exorcist. I was really hoping for a movie that would set me on the edge like The Exorcist did. In a sense, I was let down because for some reason I thought the movie would go into a full blown possession and we would see an updated version of Regan, that was my bad for assuming, however, I did love the fact the movie was filmed in the original house. Of course you would have to ask, who would want to live there? I give it four stars because it was good, thrilling, and it did make me jump here and there. It is highly worth the watch.",1476230400,5,641,3.9767441860465116
7695641,3,B01D01K5L4,"Well, when the intro texts say ""View at your own risk"" that sets the mood already. But wasn't as scary as I thought but I did like it.",1476144000,,134,3.8214285714285716

7695645,3,B01D01K5L4,"It was a decent movie. Of course, I wanted to smack the characters a few times, because seriously...who would want to live in THAT house?

When I watch a movie with exorcism in the title I expect there to be some scary demonic exorcist things going on. I watched both 1 and 2 and they both left me hoping for more but not getting it.
The end was a complete disappointment in both movies.",1472774400,,327,3.9696969696969697

7695666,2,B01D01K5L4,"Definitely a B movie with the dialogue,  acting and film editing.  I gave it 2 stars just for the demonic eye effects.  Premise was kind of cool but there was too much focus on the female lead so I fast forwarded past the drawn out parts and chopped it down to 40 minutes.  Would've been more interesting if they focused more on the little boy and ouija board.  The ending was disappointing too.",1471910400,3,395,4.3561643835616435

7695669,5,B01D01K5L4,"I'm really not a movie critic, so in my opinion, I thought this movie to be really good. I don't expect much from exorcism movies nowadays, although this movie did exceed my expectations. It is not particularly scary but I the storyline was engaging. I am a fan of the movie but not of the ending. Overall, I enjoyed this movie and I'm glad it wasn't a waste of time.",1470700800,3,367,4.257142857142857

8754492,2,B01D01K5L4,"It wasn't bad until the last 15 or so minutes. Then it just got silly. The shots from inside the house were interesting and worth the watch, but other than that it was a Ouija Board wannabe with up-right pentacles.",1498089600,,214,4.375
8754493,2,B01D01K5L4,"I was curious about this Prime movie because of the premise that some actual sights and sounds of some kind of demonic possession were captured. Maybe this was meant to be a type of gimmick like the dime in the envelope from a charity organization which you are supposed to return to them with your donation. Anyway, it was a clever ruse but unrewarding. The only image that I saw which had no connection to the storyline was a blue face that emerged from the wall after a character moved away from the spot. I thought at the time that maybe that was it, but it resembled a Hollywood special effect instead of a spooky remnant captured by accident.

The opening shots of the St. Louis waterfront were special to me since I spent many years in the St. Louis area. Unfortunately, the visuals in this SOV production went downhill from there.",1497312000,,838,4.5131578947368425
8754494,4,B01D01K5L4,The true story was of the Exorcist was actually based on a boy whose Aunt had dabbled into black magic. Which resulted in her nephew being possessed by a demon. Now I'm not sure about this story about his descendents being haunted. But it made a good story,1496448000,,256,4.354166666666667

8754497,1,B01D01K5L4,"This is sooo bad that the producers should have donated the money to film it to charity. The main caracter (Amy....i think) is a mean looking, trashy chick who must have taken acting lessons online. The 2 others are no better. It is the kind of movie in which a priest gives her some rope and makes a point of telling this nitwit that the posessed must be tied up. She then goes upstairs, sans rope and tada she is tying said rope like a true sailor. Bypass on this dreck.",1482105600,2,472,4.197802197802198
8754498,1,B01D01K5L4,"The acting is bad, the camera work is just oh so horrible... Looks like it could've been filmed from a phone most of the time. I'm pretty sure I saw Michael Meyers in the window a little bit in the beginning... Can't differentiate between day and night between scenes. Looks out the window it's night, goes outside its daytime. Just no.. Waste of time. I was absolutely done with it when it showed Michael Meyers in the window for a split second.",1479427200,,446,4.451219512195122
