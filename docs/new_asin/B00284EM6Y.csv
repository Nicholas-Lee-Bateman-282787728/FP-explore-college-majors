8355764,3,B00284EM6Y,"Not sure if i have the correct dvd since amazon doesn't have a pic of this up, but i bought a KILLERS OF THE DEEP 3-disc set from Madacy Home Video that runs about 6hrs.  It came in a nice tin case with a fierce-looking shark on the cover(the dvd's are encased in a foldout book).  I bought it on sight but didn't know anything about it other than the fact it was cheap(got it for $10 at the bullseye store so amazon's price is comparable) and about predators of the sea.

It has 12 epsiodes(and 3 bonus episodes) from some show from the 80's/The Last Frontier(?) revolving around their leader John Stoneman and the Foundation for Ocean Research.  I thought it was an Australian or UK show, but there's a prominent Canadian flag on the boat.  Anyway, pros and cons:

pros:
lots of content.  12+3=15 episodes(about 20-25 min).  some very good underwater scenes of sharks and other underwater predators as well as other sea life and coral reefs etc.  that last part is either a pro or a con as this set goes all over the map with what it shows; in other words, it's not just about 'killers of the deep'.  i don't mind this much as i enjoyed the manatee and dolphin stuff.

cons:
usually brief, yet frequent enough to be annoying, shots of the humans that disrupt the underwater photography.  if you want long scenes of uninterrupted underwater footage prepare to be disappointed.  also, the visual quality is poor for dvds.  at times, looks like vhs or you-tube-like video.  you get what you pay for so don't expect high-quality visuals(which does sort of negate some of the potentially beautiful shots of fish and coral life doesn't it?)

The bonus features are: 3 extra episodes, previews of other Madacy/sea-related dvd's, and 'direct scene access'.  Not sure what the last one is cause when i tried to skip a chapter it just took me to the next episode.  That's right, no chapter breaks.  Overall, i'm disappointed with the purchase mainly because of the video quality and the occasional land footage.  But for all the content at just $10, it's a keeper.  Plus, i have that nice tin case with the shark on the cover.",1259712000,7,2118,4.579787234042553
