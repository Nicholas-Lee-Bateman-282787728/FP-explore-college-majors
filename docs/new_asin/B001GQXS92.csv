It's not about that. Plus most of this stuff was filmed 30 to nearly 50 years ago. I recommend this to every old and new Iggy, and Iggy and the Stooges fan.",1494028800,,327,4.174603174603175

The Lust for Life DVD from American anti-star Iggy Pop heads to 1986 and before to assess the ups and downs of a rebel rocker. In the mid 70s the recently departed guru David Bowie revived the Raw Power of James Newell Osterberg Jr. (a.k.a. Iggy)-and, the career defining albums The Idiot and Lust for Life had the Detroit dynamo back on form. The vocalist who sought to Search and Destroy was set to enjoy a purple period-and, live action, rare footage and candid interviews with Iggy and associates such as fellow Stooge, the late Ron Asheton make this visual release an entertaining entity.
A riotous career that started in the 60s is still firing energy and enterprise when Mr. Pop is now on the verge of his 70s! The Lust for Life DVD is an essential file in the colourful career of Iggy Pop.",1461542400,,822,4.466666666666667

8306811,1,B001GQXS92,"This movie is a rip off.  Don't buy it, especially if you don't know German.  This movie promotes itself as a ""must have,"" but I call it a ""don't buy.""  Iggy speaks english, but is interviewed in German.  NO translations, NO subs.  The movie is B-rate, the sound is B-rate, and the movie over all looks like a junior high production.  Complete garbage.",1356652800,,352,4.507936507936508
