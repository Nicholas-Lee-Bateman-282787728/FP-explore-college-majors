3853159,5,B002696XMC,"How many people - outside of longtime Military History readers, of course - are aware that for a goodly portion of the Russian Revolution, the easternmost leg of Russia's Trans-Siberian Railway was controlled by an ad hoc force of Czechoslovak soldiers taking the long way home? The narration in this documentary is somewhat elementary, but considering the difficulty in explaining who was doing what to whom without a scorecard amid Russia's chaotic transition from World War I to Civil War - the environment in which the Czechoslovak Legion was born and fought to survive - for the average viewer that approach might be a good thing. The surviving photos are remarkable, and the complete story itself even more so. This lesser-known facet of World War I and Czech history merits more attention, and any scholar of early 20th century history should find Accidental Army an eyebrow-raiser.

3853160,5,B002696XMC,"My great -uncle served as a major in the Czechoslovak Legion,and I have always felt that the Legion's exploits have been politically suppressed and then simply overlooked, for too long. It's an amazing tale of heroism,political machinations and complex personal intrigues on the Trans - Siberian rail line, that invites comparison with Dr Zhivago and other great stories of all time. Hollywood needs to make a Big Screen movie about this! For now, Bruce Bendinger has done a great job of laying out the basic story on a very nice CD.It presents the interesting facts with wonderful photos chosen from the archives, and explains them with intelligently focussed text. I highly recommend it.",1241049600,11,689,5.106194690265487
3853161,5,B002696XMC,"Most of the action of this story takes place on a train.  Fitting, because with every anecdote, interview and unearthed image, Accidental Army moves like a train.  Its fast pace covering a slew of improbable heroes and ruthless villains.  Only WWI and the Russian Revolution could have overshadowed the unlikely birth of a great European nation.  But the story of the Czechoslovak Legion is simply too compelling to wind up as an unnoticed historical footnote.  It's high time that this story had a proper examination.  After all, it has so many fascinating elements.  Spies.  War.  Underdogs.  Not to mention treasure from the vaults of the Czar himself.

Accidental Army is that rare story that works as both history and entertainment.  And it will be enjoyed by anyone who can't help but root for those who overcome long odds with little more than guts and guile.",1240272000,11,866,4.896551724137931

8352377,5,B002696XMC,"The Czechoslovak Legion (eskoslovensk legie in Czech, eskoslovensk lgie in Slovak) were volunteer armed forces composed predominantly of Czechs and Slovaks fighting together with the Entente powers during World War I. Their goal was to win the Allies' support for the independence of Bohemia and Moravia from the Austrian Empire and of Slovak territories of the Kingdom of Hungary, which were then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. With the help of migr intellectuals and politicians such as Tom Garrigue Masaryk and Milan Rastislav tefnik, they grew into a force of tens of thousands.

This film covers the men who were far from home on the Trans-Siberian railway for many years. The film was extra personal to me because my great grandfather was on that train. This well narrated and beautifully told story brought me to tears on several occasions. A wonderful story that tells a hidden history that many people do not even know exist. Watch, learn, understand and then question why so many historic occurrences remain suppressed or ""overlooked"". A fantastic film.",1421366400,,1069,5.179190751445087

BRUCE BENDINGER-THE CZECH LEGION PROJECT
DVD, ENGLISH, REGION 1, 2009, 47 MINUTES, $25.00, POWER POINT DVD

When war broke out in August, 1914, there was no country called Czechoslovakia. What was to become that nation was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, one of the Central Powers aligned against the Allies. However, the Czechs and Slovaks were more closely tied ethnically to Russia than to the European Austro-Hungarians and weren't happy to bear arms for the Central Powers. As the war progressed on the Eastern Front, the Czechs and Slovaks found ways to surrender, sometimes en masse, to their Russian cousins.

Led by men like Masaryk, Benes, and Stefanik, they lobbied for a Czech and Slovak Corps to be composed of Czechs and Slovaks who lived in Russia as well as Czechs and Slovaks who were POWs. The idea was accepted and after Russia left the war, the Czech Corps was placed under French command and assigned to the Western Front. From the Ukraine, they would now begin the long almost 6,000 mile trek on the Trans-Siberian Railroad to Vladistovok and then by ship to France. But it was in Russia where they would win laurels and make military history.

ACCIDENTAL ARMY: THE AMAZING TRUE STORY OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK LEGION is the little known but amazing account of one of the most celebrated units in military history-the Czech and Slovak Legion. From its humble beginnings in Russia to its baptism of fire on the Eastern Front during World War I to its courageous and valiant struggle to get home, this DVD brings to light this untold story that has been suppressed since the end of World War II. With the upcoming 100th Anniversary of World War I coming in 2014, this is one DVD you want to have in your viewing library. Even the best DVD has mistakes and there are a few in this one and they are as follows:

*Contrary to what a previous book reviewer stating that the 31st U.S. Infantry Regiment disembarked in Vladivostok before the 27th U.S. Infantry Regiment; it was the 27th U.S. Infantry Regiment that disembarked (1,590 soldiers) from the USAT ships Merritt, Crook, and Warren on 15-16 August 1918 while the 31st U.S. Infantry Regiment disembarked (1,421 soldiers) from the USAT ship Sherman on 21 August 1918.

*The following countries had troops in Vladivostok and Siberia (the nations listed below are estimated except for the United States):
Czech and Slovak-55,000
Serbs-4,000
Italians-2,000
Japanese-70,000
Poles-12,000
Great Britain-1,600
China-2,300
France-760
Canada-4,192
United States-338 officers, 8,050 enlisted, 17 field workers, and 17 female nurses.

*Both the U.S. 8th (AEF Siberia) and 85th Divisions (Northern Russia) weren't National Guard units but regular U.S. Army units.

*The book entitled THE CZECH AND SLOVAK LEGION IN SIBERIA, 1917-1922 is tied in with this DVD and my review of this book is under the title.

8352382,5,B002696XMC,"Most people have never heard of the Czech (or Czechoslovak) Legion. I have written two articles on this early 20th century band of freedom fighters with the help of research from the Czech Legion Project. The Czech Legion Project is a non-profit historical organization that strives to tell the tale of this incredible group. After years of effort they have put together an insightful 47-minute documentary entitled ""The Accidental Army: The Amazing True Story of the Czechoslovak Legion.""

The 2009 independent production utilizes the vast archives amassed by the Czech Legion Project to tell the `most amazing story you never heard."" Commentators included Lt Col Mike Maudlin, USA retired (advisor to the Czech Army 2003-2006), and Professor Malynne Sternstein, PhD. The documentary was also assisted by the Czech consulate and included an introduction by Madeleine Albright.

The film covers in great detail the Russian Army's formation of the Czechoslovak Druzhina (a 12th century word which translates to Legion or ""war band"") at Kiev on August 14, 1914- only two weeks after the war started. The Legions World War I service and its expansion into a 35,000-man, two-division Corps by October 1917. The Allies convinced the Bolsheviks to withdraw the Czech Legion from their crumbling front and ship them via train 6,000 miles across Russia to Vladivostok where they would be transported to the western front and continue the war there. Some 9300 kilometers (5470 miles) of this trip was across the Trans-Siberian Railway from Moscow to the Pacific Ocean. This final journey was to take nearly three years and toss the luckless Czechs into the middle of the Russian Civil War.

The only issues I had with the documentary were trivial:. There is a gap in coverage from the capture of Yekaterinburg to the Treaty of Versailles. The fall 1918/spring 1919 campaign where the legion assisted in the capture of Perm and Kazan and the advance to the Volga is simply skipped. On July 22, 1918 they captured Simbrisk and the ""Lenin""- Bolshevik armored train No. 4, which the Czechs pressed into service as the Orlik (Czech for Eagle). They took Perm in December, followed by Glazov and Kazan just miles from the Volga River and stood within a few hundred miles of Moscow. It was the first army to threaten European Russia from Asia since the tartars in the 12th century. The documentary also further states that the American units that landed in Vladivostok in 1918 were National Guard when in fact the first US troops in town were the 31st Infantry Regiment of regulars from the Philippines.

The most amazing quality of the documentary is the hundreds of amazing photographs from the Russian Civil War in Siberia that make up a priceless collection. I have more than 80 books on the Russian Civil War in three different languages on my bookshelves and I have not seen the majority of these pictures. The secret lies in several Czech family collections that are in private hands that were made available to the project. These coupled with the attention shown this subject that is often relegated to a footnote in history make the documentary worth watching.

Nazadar!

8352383,5,B002696XMC,"This film, footage, and story -- is simply amazing.  I'm pleased that more people will be able to learn about this chapter in history -- as the Legion and the lives of these soldiers made a difference.

As is too often true, history is written by the ""big-name"" victors -- and it takes a few generations to tease out a broader view of reasonable historical accuracy.  So many of the victims of conflict are nameless, forgotten and unheralded.  But this has always been true -- few will utter our names in three generations.

Thus, this film and it's true-to-life message is inspiring.  Inspiring because it's so easy to forget our history.  Inspiring because it takes energy, time and resources to accurately remember.  Inspiring because sheer survival is often unheralded.  Freedom and economic advantage are noble causes -- but so are the simple bonds of family in just making it back home.

The story understands that in the end, many of us are pawns in the ""big picture"" -- but in our own smaller realm, we must decide whether we are ready to be the ""heroes of our own lives"".  The Legion stepped up to the task -- no matter how confusing or mixed up!  The film helps decipher this tension, confusion, and changing rules of war in a way that is understandable and thoughtful.",1278979200,3,1279,4.660714285714286
