8754250,5,B01CUVPHWM,"This was a great documentary about a elderly bank robber and his crime spree. He led an interesting life with many ups and downs from owning a multi million dollar business to losing it all to the banks,hence his reasoning for robbing banks...and because theres nothing in the bible that says anything about robbing banks as he put it. Definitely a must have in your video library!",1504828800,,381,4.701492537313433
