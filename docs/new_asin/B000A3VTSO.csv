8074106,5,B000A3VTSO,"As a beginning voice student,and interested primarily in baroque and early classical works, my ever-clever voice teacher tries out various works that I would not have thought of.  She picked out Der Leirmann, which immediately struck me deeply, as I had never quite ""gotten"" lieder.  She followed this up with a U-Tube clip of this, and said, ""this is how you should think about singing 'legato'"".  Not having heard of Quasthoff, whom she reveres, I watched and was positively awestruck.  I found the DVD elsewhere viewed the whole thing, and thought to myself, why was this never released on CD?
Thinking about this, I ""ripped"" the soundtrack, edited out the initial intro and applause at the end, and end up with 78 minutes that just fits on an 80 minute CD.
I now have both - the DVD with even better sound than the CD, and a CD to follow along on the way to choral practice. (Note - the dynamic range is quite large as there is little of the compression that might be used for a CD version.)
Since then, I have heard Quasthoff's previous versions, as well as Fischer-Diskau's, and none come close to the sensitivity and intimacy of Quashoff's and Barenboim's rendition.",1484352000,,1173,4.679611650485437

8074109,5,B000A3VTSO,"i had never heard winterreise until i rented the DFD/brendel version recorded in 1979.this is a fine performance that looks like it was copied to dvd from a ""bargain"" vhs tape.it inspired me to buy the quasthoff/barenboim version recorded in 2005.this is a jaw-dropping performance worthy of repeated viewing and study.also great picture and sound up to top present-day standards.both dvds have optional english/german/etc subtitles.  note: since this isn't ""twilight"" or ""transformers"",you might want to buy from a vendor who has a copy in-stock.",1249171200,6,547,5.511904761904762
8074110,5,B000A3VTSO,Quasthoff and Barenboim gave a terrific performance of Schubert's Winterreise. They explored both the full affect and emotional impact of the work. Bravo!,1223942400,3,154,5.739130434782608
8074111,4,B000A3VTSO,"The utmost praise is due the great Thomas Quasthoff in this live Winterreise from the Berlin Philharmonie in March, 2005. Watching his rapt, expressive face as he sings is justification enough for this DVD. Quasthoff's early Winterreise on CD came out in 1998 from RCA/BMG. In every respect his interpretation has gained since then in pathos, technical assurance, and emotional authority -- he really is unsurpassed among current interpreters. (Only the overlooked tenor Werner Gura is a close rival.)

Normally Quasthoff's artistry is complemented by the artistry of Justus Zeyen, Quasthoff's remarkable accompanist. The two are a soul match; it's rare for someone of Zeyen's talents to confine himself to a secondary role. Here we have the far more celebrated Barenboim, and for me he is a problem. His habit, especially in the first handful of songs, is to drag the tempo and underplay the line. I fidgeted at how Quasthoff's impulse to press ahead was undermined by Barenboim's passivity.  At times he's guilty of tiptoeing through the music.  At other times Quasthoff is lured into singing at a mannered slow tempo -- the one thing this singer doesn't need is tricked-up sensitivity.

Barenboim never reaches the depths of Schubert's piano writing, as Benjamin Britten did in his classic Winterreise with Peter Pears (Decca), but things improve later on, largely because Quasthoff seizes command -- he's a volatile artist whose inner fire can't be banked for long. Barenboim, when left on his own, reverts to a mannered, recessive style that makes it hard for the cycle as a whole to gain momentum. Quasthoff tries to build an emotional arc, and in large part he succeeds. I can understnad why so many reviewers extol this DVD, which features exemplary sound, but for me the cumulative effect is somewhat less than ideal.

I'd rate this as a five-star Winterreise if you are fairly new to the work, but four stars, or lower, if you have lived with the cycle half your life and know what greatness sounds like.",1205452800,8,2014,4.982142857142857
8074112,5,B000A3VTSO,"Schubert's song cycle Die Winterreise (The Winter's Journey) is another wonderful piece in the solo vocal literature. Tenor Thomas Quasthoff and pianist Daniel Barenboim present Die Winterreise beautifully on this DVD. Written in 1827 by Franz Schubert, who set to music the cycle of 24 poems by Wilhelm Muller, the series is of a sad portrayal of alienation and loneliness. The songs trace the physical and emotional journey of a rejected lover traveling away from his beloved's hometown, out into the snow covered fields, and past frozen rivers. As time passes, he travels far and his mental state weakens as severe depression surrounds him. He grows increasingly despondent. Occasional flashes of hope appear, but are very quickly dashed leaving even greater loneliness for him, leading to the song cycle's chilling conclusion. To me the story is not just about lost love. The young woman who turns her back on the wanderer is more than the object of his love. She represents everything he wants in life. A family, friends, warmth and understanding, and her rejection serves as final realization that human happiness is only a dream from which he has awoken. Sadly, Schubert's music reflected his own personal life. He too, never found love or true happiness and you can hear it in his music. Like Mozart, he died too young at the age of 31 from complications of syphillis. This DVD also has a 30 minute bonus feature of Barenboim and Quasthoff rehearsing for the performance that was very informative and interesting to watch.",1186185600,10,1530,5.003921568627451
8074113,5,B000A3VTSO,"The unbelievable baritone Thomas Quastoff, accompanied by pianist Daniel Barenboim, sings this heart-rending song cycle with more feeling and tragic flair than anyone since Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. Although the singer is physically victimized by his mother's use of thalidomide, there are no traces of this in the power, both vocal and emotional, brought to this performance. Daniel Barenboim is a knowing accompanist, and the added features, interviews etc. contribute to making this an all-time favorite for any lover of vocal music.",1162857600,4,536,5.7125
8074114,5,B000A3VTSO,"Schubert's Winterreise is a cycle that, for many music lovers, has a single name

and voice: Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. In the last years we are discovering young

singers whom are approaching this lieder in a new, fresh and master way,

specially Mathias Goerne and Thomas Quasthoff. Goerne performance for Hyperion

was really very good, but this one I really think it's even better, among the

best you can listen in this remarkable songs.

I know various performances by Fischer-Dieskau (with Moore, Barenboim, Demus...

playing the piano part), and I can say I still love Dieskau performances over

any other, specially the one he sang with Daniel Barenboim playing the piano

(Deutsche Grammophon). Dieskau's voice is powerful, mature, deep in

understanding and full of details that make every lied a unique experience. His

tone and his enormous dynamic range is outstanding and the way he can use his

resources is something that has no parallel in the history of the lieder, a

master class of expression in any sung part he did.

Quasthoff has a great, great voice, full of presence, of a vast sonority, great

dynamic range... but, in my opinion, his greatest talent is about expression and

feeling the music. It's like if this songs were written for him in some cases.

Quasthoff's vision on the lieder is a bit more intimate than Dieskau's one,

which is much more romantic. Thomas tries to place Winterreise in a new point of

view, probably the one that will be much more followed in the XXIth Century, if

anyone can steps out of Dieskau's way. Of course technique is amazing, the

diction of his German is remarkable and perfect, and his voice really is the

engine of the mechanism, in the way he leads the performance completely, a point

you can notice when you listen him, and specially when you watch the documentary

which is presented in this DVD with the rehearsals in the Berliner Philharmonie

joining Daniel Barenboim and Thomas Quasthoff. The Israeli pianist gives

Quasthoff the leading of the piece, as he decla

res, the main construction of the lieder, and Thomas is a real master in that

chapter, because he understand Schubert's Winterreise not as a collection of

songs but as a full and very compact cycle of feelings and thinking about life,

solitude, love and death. Quasthoff think Winterreise follows a plan in which

every song is based on previous one, in order to create a way, a path that he

sings in a renovated style, full of charm, deeply touching. The way and the

steps are walked slowly by Quasthoff, his tempo is slower than the one Dieskau

used to do, slower than Barenboim with Dieskau, anyway, something that creates

some ""problems"" on rehearsals, like we watch on the DVD, but that works very

well on stage, demanding great concentration and use of rubato in many cases, as

the inner tempo needs some moments of contrast to give way to feelings of

anguish and disorder that the poet and the composer suffer. Having on mind that

Winterreise is a cycle, Quasthoff is able, anyway, to

 recreate a full world in every song, in every lieder, something we can notice

even in his face, that take different expressions according to Muller's texts

and to Schubert's notes. Like the other reviewer wrote, watching Quasthoff sing

""Der Leiermann"" is a really unique experience in the world of recorded music on

DVD nowadays, a deeply touching moment of absolute union between music and

singer, between composer and performer, like his face shows in all the lied, and

like his voice sings.

Barenboim is superb playing his part. I know some other recordings of Schubert's

music played by Mr. Barenboim: Sonatas, Impromptus... and I knew he was very good

in this repertoire, as in this same piece. He understand every singer has to

decide the way the piece is played and he gives the leadership to Quasthoff,

responding perfectly to the German singer demands. As a flexible musician who

has done dozens of concerts of chamber and lieder music, he is an ideal partner

to this travel.

The sound is very good, quite better in 5.1 than in stereo, even for those who

listen it in two channel Hi-Fi systems, and the image quality is very good too,

in 16:9, shot in the Berliner Philharmonie live, full of ambient and with an

extraordinary public in complete silence.

Strongly recommended as one of the most interesting DVDs in lieder music

nowadays, even if you have Dieskau's one.",1146009600,24,4446,4.826029216467464
8074115,5,B000A3VTSO,"At almost the same time, the two noticeable Schubert's ""Winterreise"" dvds were released: Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau/Brendel version and Thomas Quasthoff/Barenboim version. I wanted to buy both of them so that I could compare. Because of my budget (I'm a poor student), however, I had to choose one of them. I already knew Fischer-Dieskau is such a famous baritone especially for this Schubert's song cycle. I own a CD of Fischer-Dieskau/Brendel's Winterreise recorded in 1985, which I didn't like very much because I couldn't ""feel"" the spirit of the music. (The Fischer-Dieskau's recording of the dvd was made in 1979.) After getting some information about Quasthoff, with whom I was not very familiar, I decided to buy this dvd. It seemed to be a venture because I hadn't heard any songs he sang before.

As soon as I got this dvd, I opened and played it with some expectation and curiosity. When I saw the baritone come onto the stage, I was surprised by his physical difference from us. I was surprised once again when he began to sing. He has such a great voice that is soft but strong, warm but clear. His musical expression with his voice is mesmerising and even spiritual. I was able to feel the essence of the Schubert from his devoted singing. Barenboim's piano supported the baritone very harmoniously. To me, this Quasthoff's Winterreise (recorded live at the Berlin Philharmonie this year) is a lot better than Fischer-Dieskau's 1985 version. When Quasthoff sang the last song ""Der Leiermann"" and closed his eyes at the end, I was deeply touched and was able to picture the Muller's poem in my mind. I have seen the dvd many times since I got it. The more I watch him sing, the more I like and admire him. I think this dvd will be my all-time favorite. So, my venture ended up discoverig a treasure.

The sound format is quality DTS/DD 5.1 & PCM. For some reason, the vision (16x9 anamorphic) is not as good as most other recent concert dvds but not bad. Anyway, this dvd is highly recommended! You will find a new virtuoso of ""Winterreise""!",1132704000,41,2052,4.729050279329609
