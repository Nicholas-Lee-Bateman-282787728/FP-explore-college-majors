6979685,4,B00SBYJTYU,"""Low Down"" (2014 release; 120 min.) brings the true story of famed jazz pianist Joe Albany's struggle with drugs, as see through the eyes of his 13 yr. old daughter Amy-Jo (or A.J.) Albany. As the movie opens, we are reminded that it is ""Hollywood, 1974"", as we say Amy-Jo (played by Elle Fanning) looking through magazines, waiting on her dad's return home. Amy-Jo loves watching him practice and play. Soon we learn that Joe (played by Jphn Hawkes) is in trouble for having broken his parole, and he is taken back in by cops. Amy-Jo moves in with her Gram (played by Glenn Close). To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, please note that this is not a biopic of Joe Albany, but instead a look at a very specific phase in Amy-Jo's life when she was 13 through 15, which happens to coincide with Joe's never-ending battle with heroin. In fact, the book is based on Amy-Jo's memoir and she is credited as having co-written the script for the movie. Second, this is not particularly a feel-good movie, far from it, as these characters are living in less than glamorous conditions, and they are surrounded by low-lives. Third, the movie is set in the mid-70s and does a great job bringing that era to life with lots of audio and video clips that play on the TV. Less charming is the incessant smoking of cigarettes, I mean I don't think there is a single scene in the movie where someone isn't smoking. Fourth, as you can well imagine, this type of material tends to bring out great acting performances, and that is certainly the case here. Elle Fanning, who was 15 when this movie was shot, is outstanding as the adoring daughter who realizes that her dad is in serious trouble. John Hawkes, best known for his roles in Winter's Bone and The Sessions, brings a heartfelt performance as the pained jazz pianist. At one point, when Gram talks to A.J about dreaming of a better future, Joe shrugs ""Mine is a life of wasted dreams"", wow. And what can you say about Glenn Close as the pianist's mother (A.J.'s grandmother), I was simply blown away. Check out also Flea (of Red Hot Chili Peppers) in a smaller role. I was quite surprised when the end titles rolled to see that both Flea and Anthony Kudis of the Peppers executive-produced the movie. Good for them! Last but not least, music, and jazz music in particular plays a huge role in the movie so if you don't care much for it, you may want to stqay away. There are other song placements, including David Bowie's ""Golden Years"".

""Low Down"" opened in November without any pre-release buzz or advertising at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. I figured this would not play very long so I want to see it on opening weekend. The screening I saw this at on a Sunday late afternoon turned out to be a private affair, as in: I was literally the only person in the theater. That's a shame. Maybe this movie will find a larger audience when it is released on DVD. If you have a chance to check out ""Low Down"", realizing this is not a movie you'll walk out thinking ""this was a jolly good time"", I'd readily recommend that you do so, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1421452800,25,3253,4.48397976391231

I enjoyed it, but felt that Elle Channing's acting is pretty poor. Fortunately, her part wasn't terribly demanding. The real life of children in her position has been shown enough that had she done a little homework and watched a few other movies on the same topic, she could have done a much better job.

I'm a jazz fan, so I enjoyed learning more about the protagonist, and the sound track was great. The writing was pretty good too; Elle dragged it down to 3 stars, otherwise I would give 4.",1447891200,,618,4.327586206896552

I was the child of a similar father and this movie reminded me too much of my own childhood.

Also, at the end, not enough time was spent on her decision, to stay clean and sober.

The box is big, it unfolds, has pictures inside, and seems to promise something special. Low Down finally had some special features, and I felt like the special case fit the film. It was like a collector's record, with a nice sleeve talking about the artists & their tracks, something you can keep forever along with the music. So, there you go, do you like collecting vinyl? Do you like jazz? Do you like slow stories about addicts and their families? Perhaps a few of you do, and if so you'll be treated to some fine acting as well. This movie just wasn't for me, I couldn't make myself like it, and that's the bottom line. The video was OK, the audio better, and there were a couple extras on the disc.

6979766,3,B00SBYJTYU,"Jeff Preiss, in his feature directorial debut chooses the story of jazz musician Joe Albany (John Hawkes).  Based on the memoir of Albany's daughter, Amy Albany played by Elle Fanning from the time she was 13 to about 15.  Albany's career began with gigs with Miles Davis and Charlie Parker, but addled with a heroin addiction fell in and out of a promising career.

The film is set in New York in the late 1970's and focuses on Joe's relationship with his young daughter.  Abandon by her alcoholic mother, Sheila (Lena Headey), Amy makes the best of the relationship with her father.  He loves her but their life is a difficult one.  Joe is in and out of jail on narcotics charges, spends time in prison and plays in Europe for a couple years until he is deported.  During his absence, Joe's mother (Glenn Close) watches over young Amy-Jo.

The story is a familiar one, bleak in tone and often depressing.  Fanning gives one of the best performances of her young career as a girl who must grow up quickly.  Hawkes, provides yet another in a long line of acting gems as the drug addled musician.  A couple interesting characters show up on occasion.  Flea, from the rock band ""Red Hot Chili Peppers,"" plays trumpet player Lester Hobbs, a friend of Joe's and also addicted.  Peter Dinklage, like Headey can be seen in TV blockbuster ""Game of Thrones.""  Here he plays a down on his luck porn actor who lives in the basement of same building as the rest of the characters.

6979795,4,B00SBYJTYU,"Gritty portrayal of the raising of Joe Albany's daughter, Amy-Joe, amidst the squalor brought on by the addiction of her father.  Joe Albany grapples with his addiction while struggling to maintain a relationship with his family and pursuing his musical career.  The movie is adapted from a book written by Joe Albany's daughter and illustrates the strong bond and love between father and daughter.  Low Down is often difficult to watch as Joe Albany takes himself and family down from degradation to further degradation.  Just when I thought he couldn't go any lower, he does.

In real life Joe Albany managed to have a successful career in spite of his problems with addiction.  The movie, to me, demonstrates that strength of the human spirit which can survive and thrive in spite of incredible adversity.",1433721600,2,808,4.992537313432836

6979807,5,B00SBYJTYU,"An excellent film version of Amy-Jo Albany's Low Down: Junk, Jazz, and Other Fairy Tales from Childhood, her memoir of life with her father jazz pianist Joe Albany. I met the author briefly in the late 70s (and her grandmother once as well - I never met her father) and the book and film capture the strange dark world of that time and place perfectly. Joe Albany and other masters of west coast jazz are almost a forgotten legend now and this mirror to those days is a long time coming. An amazing gathering of A-list actors contribute to this award-winning independent feature, led by John Hawkes and Elle Fanning. Featuring Lena Headey, Peter Dinklage, Glenn Close, Flea and Caleb Landry Jones, audio commentary by director Jeff Preiss and an interview with the author. A must for jazz fans and a warning to all musicians.",1427068800,2,825,4.696551724137931
6979808,4,B00SBYJTYU,"Jazz is one of my favorite types of music, and it's the primary reason I was interested in this film. What I wasn't expecting was a rather sobering portrayal of addiction and dependency. LOW DOWN tells the story (or at least a part of it) of jazz pianist Joe Albany (John Hawkes) and his daughter, Amy Jo (Elle Fanning). Joe is in and out of prison for drugs but is still trying to clean himself up. It doesn't really help that the people he hangs around are junkies like him, so he eventually skips probation and goes to Europe. He comes back a couple of years later, but it seems like little has changed. If there's one thing that was frustrating about the film, it was that the characters in it keep on making the same mistakes over and over again. However, the central relationship between Joe and and his daughter kept things afloat for the most part. He truly cares for her and does his best to shield her from the seedy side of the life that he lives, even though she does find out on her own. One breath of fresh air was Glenn Close as Joe's mother. She had a no-nonsense attitude that grounded the film and kept it from descending too low into self-pity and misery. That's not to say that John Hawke's wasn't great, which he is, but his character is so unlikeable at times that it was nice to have some common sense and dramatic counterpoint. Elle Fanning is serviceable as Albany's waifish, slight and asthma-stricken daughter. This is certainly the best role I've seen her in, and she seems to feel at home playing these weakish characters. The only thing I don't think she did convincingly was break down into histrionics when her seizure-prone boyfriend (Caleb Landry Jones) is mistakenly arrested by the police. In terms of characters, many of them in this film are afflicted in some way. Joe Albany (and many of his friends) have heroin, his daughter has asthma, her boyfriend has seizures, etc. We see people when they are at their lowest, but yet the film never judges them. There is only the hope that they will one day rise up again. I will say that this isn't the easiest film to watch, in terms of the characters or the laxly paced story. Some might find it too slow or boring, but this is a character-driven biopic. At times I began to wonder when and how it might end, but when the end did come I was fairly satisfied. I should also mention that this film has an excellent soundtrack and score, and includes some scenes of John Hawkes (apparently) playing the piano. If that wasn't actually him then they did a great job of disguising it. Overall, LOW DOWN presents a tender and sometimes moving look into the life of a musician. Just be aware that this isn't your standard biopic.",1424908800,6,2704,4.486815415821501
