2414154,5,B000BD68AM,"A woman in my mom's group told me that her 18 month daughter learned all of her letters by watching Meet the Letters for 2 weeks.  I decided to give it a try with my 20 month old son.  I bought all three Preschool Prep Series DVDs; Meet the Letters, Meet the Numbers and Meet the Shapes. Not only did my son love them but in less than 3 weeks he had mastered upper- and lower-case letters, numbers 1-10 and 8 shapes.  He learned more from 3 weeks watching these DVDs than many kids learn in 3 years of preschool.  I tell everyone about these amazing videos.  He also loves the Lift the Flap books in the car and has become obsessed with naming letters everywhere we go.  I couldn't be more pleased with this series.",1149379200,42,715,4.220588235294118
2414155,5,B000BD68AM,My son (18 months) has outgrown the Baby Einstein DVDs so we purchased this DVD and he LOVES this DVD.  Definitely a winner.,1142726400,,124,4.391304347826087
2414156,5,B000BD68AM,I have 18 month twins.  I read a review about Meet the Letters where the reviewer had shown the video to a preschool class for a couple of weeks and said that she said that the kids loved it and wanted to watch the video over and over.  She said that the kids in the class had amazing success learning letters. I thought I would put it to the test with my twins.  In two weeks they both knew all of their letters (both upper and lowercase).  I have since bought them Meet the Numbers and Meet the Shapes and have had the same kind of success.  It is as if my twins achieved in about a month what most kids take 2 or three years of preschool to learn.  I think these videos should be required curriculum for all preschools!,1133654400,20,722,4.085106382978723
2414157,5,B000BD68AM,"Finally an alphabet video that teaches the alphabet instead of all the things that begin with a certain letter. A is not and apple, it is an A. My 4 year old daughter and 2 year old son are really into ""Meet the Letters"". My daughter knew most of the uppercase letters before she saw the video and now she knows them all plus the lower case. My son learned them all almost as quickly as she did. They are mesmerized watching the letters morph into characters and they try to imitate what the characters do. They both have their favorite letter characters and I have to admit, so do I. This video is colorful and fun and they have actually learned from it. So many video's claim to be educational but do not teach a thing. My kids have learned more from this video than from all the other videos put together. They just started watching the other video from the Preschool Prep Series (Meet the Numbers). They learned their numbers from zero to ten after watching the video a couple of times. I LOVE THESE VIDEOS !!!!!",1127520000,11,1016,4.380952380952381
2414158,5,B000BD68AM,"As working parents of a 3-year old, we often use the ""TV babysitter"" to get chores done, but felt guilty that even the most entertaining videos and DVDs have little long-term educational value for toddlers.  ""Meet the Letters"" was just what we were looking for.

I will admit when we first viewed it, the repetition seemed boring (to us adults) and were afraid our daughter would not be engaged by the lack of dialogue.  But the product is simply designed for children to recognize and reinforce the image and pronounciation of all letters.  Not only does she absolutely love the characterzation of each letter, the results of our daughter's reading development were amazingly immediate.

Athough our daughter was already familiar with most of the alphabet, it was primarily just uppercase letters.  And since most text is not written that way, she was reluctant to learn spelling with flash cards and preschool books that we own.  After just a few viewings, her new-found familiarity with lowercase letters was finally put into context and gave her the confidence to tackle reading.

Now, she's understands that ""letters make words"" and says ""that word begins with..."", even though she still can't read most words.  When she doodles and draws, she write ""words"" ""just like her books do"". The words are jibberish, but they include lowercase and tough letters like Q, g, b, d and p)

However, recently she showed us a drawing with ""DADDY"" and her name using both uppercase AND lower case letters for the first time.  My wife and I each thought the other had shown her how to do it, but she did it on her own!

I've introduced ""Meet the Letters"" to our preschool administrators, to supplement the Barney, Dora and Dragon Tales videos the younger students occasionally watch, and hope to share with all of the parents who ask how we taught our daughter to sign all of her classroom artwork.

This DVD has become our ""reward"" or incentive to motivate her to behave, and as the other reviewer stated, this is the only baby gift we will be buying for new parents this year!",1127347200,10,2067,4.772471910112359
2414159,5,B000BD68AM,"Amazing DVD series! We have meet the shapes, letters, colors, & sight words. My kids have been obsessed with these since age 1 (now 3.5 & 1.5). My oldest even likes to go back & watch colors and shapes even though he knows them all. I am truly shocked how much they have soaked up just from watching these DVDs in the car. The format is very simple (& repetitive!) I actually thought there's no way these will hold my kids attention. Yet they do!! We are believers in the PreSchool Prep series & these DVD's are one of our go to gifts for friends and cousins.",1480896000,,559,4.233644859813084

2414171,5,B000BD68AM,My 3 yr old grand daughter loves this video! She just started pre school and when I pick her up she watches this on a portable DVD player(attached to the back of the driver seat) as I negotiates dinner time traffic. I have 2 other ABC videos that I rotate so she isn't bored.,1472342400,,275,4.111111111111111
2414172,4,B000BD68AM,Good video but a bit repetitive for my toddler's taste. But I think that could also help a lot of kids learn too. I like to have it on in the background while we play so that it can sink in subconsciously.,1472256000,,205,3.9047619047619047

2414175,5,B000BD68AM,"I bought this two years ago and my 2 yr old and 4yr old both still enjoy it regularly. My 4yr old was delayed with his speech and this really got him through it when he was 2 and now you can't stop him from talking. I recommended this to a co-worker for her son who is autistic and he learned all of his sight words. I bought the whole set and would HIGHLY recommend. The kids loves it and it's on regularly by request even though the prek prep series drives me nuts :) for those who have bought it will understand what I mean. I have all of the speech dvds known to man but this one is still being used.
I don't test products and I am just a mother of 3 who loves to shop lol

2414180,5,B000BD68AM,My boys have loved this DVD from a young age. Usually around 8-9 months old they start to enjoy it. I like that it introduces them to their letters in a fun way.,1449360000,,161,3.909090909090909

2414187,4,B000BD68AM,"I'm a preschool teacher and we had ""Meet the Shapes"" and wanted to expand our collection. This does an excellent job of presenting the name of each letter. I was somewhat disappointed that it didn't introduce the sound of each letter at the same time. I am planning to order the phonics one and am sure that will deal with letter sounds. It just seems a bit like their bilking it a little trying to get more money out of me. Surely they could have done letter names and sounds on the same DVD? Well, the kids still enjoy it.",1438214400,,524,4.25

2414190,2,B000BD68AM,This video is really quite dull. I would feel like it would be punishment to make her watch it. There is much better stuff out there free on youtube or in the app store. She watches it for a few minutes and that is about it. She learned her letters through playing with magnetic letters and mellissa and doug puzzles. I really don't think there is any need for a product like this.,1437264000,,381,4.232876712328767

2414192,2,B000BD68AM,I tried to watch this video with my son and actually feel asleep twice. My son is in preschool and really disliked this video. It basically puts a letter on the screen and says the letter name over and over until your child develops a phobia of the alphabet. Lol. Maybe a good product for babies....just not a good fit for my active preschooler.,1431648000,,345,4.40625

It may seem boring for us adults and sure certain kids may find it boring but our almost 3 year old absolutely loves this and can sit through the whole thing, lol not sure I could but this is a perfect thing to put on when you are cooking, cleaning or doing some other activity and you want to keep your child busy. We have worked with our son, teaching the alphabet little by little since he was 1 but didn't want to really push it on him, he is now about to turn 3 and this video has helped with some of the letters he struggled with before and now can recognize them all so it is a very helpful video how ever I wouldn't rely on only this to teach the alphabet.

My older two kids learned all of their capital letters and letter sounds from the Leap Frog Letter Factory movie, but then I spent MONTHS teaching them the lower case letters through lessons, games, etc.  This video teaches upper AND lower case letters simultaneously!  My 26 month old learned both upper and lower case letters within two weeks of watching this video in the car, just while we were out and about.  I literally did not teach him a single letter myself.

2414211,5,B000BD68AM,"This, like most of the Preschool Prep videos, is a great way to introduce little ones to new concepts. Both my kids enjoy this series (though parents might not be able to sit through it!). They are very slow paced and repetitive, which is perfect for young viewers. Would recommend this one for the 1.5-2 year set. It covers both the uppercase and lowercase letters. My youngest was able to recognize all of the letters after watching this video for a few weeks (she was about 1.5 at the time). I like that you can divide the video in sections, which is great for shorter attention spans. Meet the Sight Words is also wonderful, as my (now 4-year-old) daughter was able to recognize all of the sight words well before she started pre-K. Highly recommend.",1414713600,,754,4.592592592592593

2414213,5,B000BD68AM,"My twin nephews knew the alphabet, both upper and lower case, before they were 18 months old by watching this video. Yes it is slow, and not for kids who already know the alphabet. It is boring to them now (just turned 2), but for a little person who doesn't talk yet, it was fascinating. They were SO proud of themselves (as were we!), and love to learn.
I am now believer in educational DVD's. I really didn't think they would pay attention, being rowdy boys and all. :) Even out in public, they get excited to see letters, whether it's on signs, in the park, etc, and will holler out the letters and point. I highly recommend this video (along with the colors and shapes - also memorized). This proud Aunt thinks it's great that they have such a good start!!!!",1411948800,,763,4.380281690140845

I think they work best for younger children as they may not hold the attention of older ones. In less than a month my 14 month old recognized colors, shapes, all numbers out of sequence and upper and lower case letters out of sequence.

2414216,1,B000BD68AM,"The positive reviews had us tricked and we were desperate so we got it but it was a huge waste of money! Our 5 year old has some developmental issues but is pretty close to the low end of average for her age, and she struggles with letter recognition and we had tried everything so we were so desperately hopeful when we read all these positive reviews but after one viewing of only the first 3 letters it was clear that this movie was useless for us. Imagine trying to make your kid sit and listen to you talk to her like she's a three month old in an extremely dry and often obnoxious manner while you flashed absolute garbage animation in her face and that's what you get with this product. Now don't get me wrong I would probably give it a shot on an infant but we even tested it on our 2 year old nephew and he looked at us like we were crazy and ran to his play room wanting nothing more to do with it at all. We just had to deal with the fact that it was a waste and go back to banging our heads against the wall and while this video has jadded us toward anything like it we have read and heard amazing thing as about the leap frog letter factory video and since it's a short cartoon with an actual story line (this product has absolutely no story line seriously it's just poorly animated letter characters saying their names in obnoxious voices) we think it will be a much better option and at the very least she might get a new cartoon out of it if not new letter recognition skills so we've ordered that and that's where I'd recommend anyone else start too.",1406851200,,1567,4.157894736842105

2414222,5,B000BD68AM,My youngest son loved watching this. I bought it for my oldest son when he was four because he didn't know his letters and I thought this would get his attention because he loves movies. I believe I bought it too late for him because I could never get him to watch it. When I had my second son it was a different story. He loved watching it and began pointing out letters at 16 months. He knew all of his letters by 20 months. I am very happy with my purchase but would advise parents to get it when they are closer to the age of one.,1395792000,,534,3.9537037037037037
2414223,4,B000BD68AM,I love all the dvds in the series but this one has a hard time keeping my kids interested. It shows uppercase and lowercase letters at the same time and it is really long.

2414225,5,B000BD68AM,I have rented all the videos from Kathy Oxley and my 3 year old knows them all. It is so very educational and helpful for toddlers that will begin pre-kindergarten or kindergarten. The video makes learning the alphabet fun and the child will like it so much that they interact with the letters. I am a big fan of these videos and DEFINITELY RECOMMEND them to parents!! You will not regret it!!!,1392336000,,394,4.486111111111111

2414227,3,B000BD68AM,This series is okay for little kids to get started on their letters.

He is now 3 years old and has moved onto advanced site words, addition, etc. but will still ask to see the ""W"" DVD as he calls it. This entire series is worth the money for the education it instills in little ones. The animation and music captivate their attention quickly and before you know it they're not only learning, but enjoying the process of learning. Highly recommended from one mother to another.",1386028800,,478,4.505747126436781

It did not capture their attention at all. The letters come on the screen and bounce around while a monotone voice says what letter it is. It very much reminded me of a PowerPoint presentation, and I was not impressed. It would have been much better, and worth the money I spent, if they would have made it more ""fun"" for the kids to watch.

I noticed a difference after only 2 weeks when my then 14 month old started yelling ""BEEEEEE! BEEEEE!"" in the middle of the grocery store because he saw the BBQ sign hanging from the ceiling.  By 16 months old he had full letter recognition of both upper and lower case letters, the entire alphabet, in any order.  I then moved on to the numbers video.  Now, at 17 months old, he does letter flashcards and is counting to 10!

It is a totally boring video. However, my 21 month old child learned all his letters from this DVD. Frankly, he also learned his shapes, numbers 0-10, colors, sight words and blends from this company. I must admit, I was a non-believer until I saw he was learning. Even now I personally cannot sit through and watch a whole video of any of these but he does time after time. Remember, it is about memorization. In order for the children to know what it is, the concept has to be repeated over and over again. I should mention that before my child watched these he did not watch hardly any television so he did not have other television shows to compare it to. If your child has been watching action filled cartoons and other television then this may be boring to them.",1360627200,,924,4.377906976744186

It's good that it holds her interest for more than a few minutes at a time and I think it's because of the bright colors and bouncing letters and cute characters. We started alphabet flash cards too and we do the dvd and the flash cards twice a day so I will update this review in a couple weeks or so to let everyone know how she is doing.,1356566400,,487,4.030927835051546

2414257,5,B000BD68AM,"I intially bought three of the Preschool Prep Company dvd's for my oldest daughter. She was five at the time and the videos bored her (although she did learn some new words from the dvd's). My other daughter was three at the time. She liked the videos but eventually started loosing interest in most of them after she turned four (she still likes ""Meet the Colors"", but I borrowed it from the library). Unfortunately, I didn't play the videos frequently enough to know how effective they were on her.

Now, I have a two-year-old son (my youngest of the three). He began watching the ""Meet the Letters"" and ""Meet the Numbers"" dvd's at age 1. Not only did he REALLY enjoy the videos at the time, but he was able to identify ALL of his alphabets (upper- and lower-case) and numbers, and count objects just from watching the dvd's. I know he didn't learn these things at a daycare, because he was home with me each day. My son couldn't even talk yet, maybe with the exception of saying, ""Da-da,"" and, ""No,"" yet he would see words on someone's shirt or on a poster, and would point out and name each letter he saw. I was surprised--I simply had no idea an 18-month-old could learn their abc's and numbers. He's now two and has just started watching ""Meet the Sight Words"". He has the same enthusiasm for the video series as he did when he was one, and is now repeating words as he sees and hears them on the video. He actually picks out the Preschool Prep Company DVD's to watch. I'm on the lookout now to see if he starts recognizing the video-featured words in books.

It wasn't until my son started watching the dvd's that I finally understood--the video series are designed for an age group of children who probably don't yet talk or are just learning to talk--I would say ages 2 and under. Now that I mention it, I think Preschool Prep Company explains that at the beginning of some of its videos. The message just didn't sink in for me until child number 3.",1344470400,,1958,4.436111111111111

I assumed it would teach all the letters AND their sounds. It doesn't. It only teaches letter recognition. I personally feel like they should be taught together. What good are letters without their sounds? I will still use the DVD but I will now watch it along with them to teach them the sounds. It would have been SO simple to add the letter sounds. Not sure why they didn't.,1334793600,,527,4.333333333333333
2414262,1,B000BD68AM,"My first child already knew all his letters, shapes and colors without DVDs by 18 months, and at that age I bought him the ""Meet the Sight Words"" series which he learned entirely in about three weeks. They were not super exciting, but they did have a nice mixture of animation and musical selections for each word, so away from the videos I could sing the tune from any given sight word and he could immediately recall what word went with it. Now at 4, he reads at a 3rd grade level.

My second child (now 18 months) knows maybe three letters, so I thought this DVD would be a good idea. But when I turned it on I could hardly believe what I was watching. First up, the lowercase letter ""a"" (Helvetica style) in black, then as an astronaut launching through the air, underscored by a lame synthesizer arrangement of ""Twinkle Twinkle"", which I suppose is an appropriate musical selection for an astronaut. A voiceover repeats the letter in high and low speaking tones until the letter becomes an animated figure and says its own name in a character voice...Typical format for these Preschool Prep DVDs, which I have to say was effective in ""Meet the Sight Words"".  Next comes the other lowercase ""a"", same animation and same music. Finally, the uppercase A, doing the same thing. ""Well, that was kinda boring,"" I thought, ""but the next letter will have different music, right?"" WRONG. ""Twinkle Twinkle"" is of course the ABC Song...so nine years later when we move on to the letter B, we get to hear the same melody, same tempo, same key, same woman's voiceover, slightly different bad synthesizer arrangement. So, 26 letters in both uppercase and lowercase, plus 2 additional to accommodate the alternative forms of ""a"" and ""g"" gives you FIFTY FOUR re-starts (each punctuated by the voiceover with no music) of the same tune (yes, played all the way through) at the same slow speed, in the same key, with the same fake instruments. The ""payoff""? A brief finale of all the letters joining in, singing GUESS WHAT SONG at GUESS WHAT SPEED in GUESS WHAT KEY.

So, I am giving this video one star because I have seen the other work this company has done, and in comparison this DVD is like they're not even trying. NEXT!",1334188800,2,2214,4.614213197969543

I put it on right before bed time so she can watch it and wind down before actually going to bed, and it does seem to be teaching her the letters.

We've quickly moved on to sight words which they are picking up very quickly & are starting to point words out when they see them in other books.
If I had any complaint, it would be that they give 2 & 3 different versions of letters A & G.  Seems unnecessary, pick the commonly used version & that's it.  And the spanish alphabet (yep, we're having them move on to spanish) has 2 ""letters"" that have apparently been taken out of the spanish alphabet.  Otherwise....HIGHLY recommended.

But, I tried this with my daycare kids.  I thought it would be a neat experiment.  It's not for the older kids.  It's meant for toddler age, but sure enough, within a few days they were learning the letters.  Even the 12 month olds know a few letters.  I thought it was mind numbingly boring.

My only gripe with this DVD has been that they don't say  the example aloud that they show for each letter, like for W they show both Well and Water which is a good thing since kids learn two words starting with the letter W. But, they only show the pictures of well and water and don't say it aloud for the kids to relate to.

Well after a couple of weeks he still wasn't thrilled with the video. My 3 year old liked it a little better, and he started to point out letters on books. After a few more weeks they lost even more interest and I quit showing it. I thought it was a waste because my kids were tired of it before it had much of an effect on them. Then my 22 month old was playing on a old keyboard we had and I noticed he was pointing out letters and saying their names. I hadn't even thought that he was paying attention when the show was on. I started to test him on all the letters and he knew most of them. So we started putting the video back on for him. After a couple more weeks he knew all the letters capital and lower case. My older kids were a little more interested then because they thought it was funny the baby knew more letters than them. I ended up buying the meet the numbers and meet the sight words 1 and 2 and my now 4 and 6 year old love them. My sister also bought the meet the letters for her 1 year old and her baby loves it! So for the older kids I think it is too slow, but for younger kids I think it is amazing.",1303862400,,1239,3.8627450980392157

2414278,5,B000BD68AM,My daughter loves this video. Within two weeks she started repeating the letters without watching the video.  I will recommend to all my friends. I love that it plays in both english and spanish!!,1296259200,,196,4.764705882352941

2414282,2,B000BD68AM,Maybe my Son is to young for this(2 years old) but this movie doesn't engage him for very long. It's a bit to repetitive for grown ups to watch with him. He will start repeating some of the letters after a while of watching though.,1290643200,,231,4.155555555555556
2414283,3,B000BD68AM,As a kindergarten teacher I'm always looking for materials that will grab my students attention and keep them engaged. This series of videos did not. After about 5 minutes they were extremely bored with it. It's good for my younger children at home but not entertaining enough to hold the attention of 5 year olds. The font is also ball and stick and does not come in D'nealian font. I would have also liked for the video to give you each letters sounds but it does not.,1290297600,,470,4.413793103448276

2414286,4,B000BD68AM,"The first five minutes of this video and I was personally wondering how I was going to sit through it with my two year old and convinced that he would be up and requesting to watch something else in about the same time. Much to my surprise he watched the entire thing (the main segment) and asked to watch more (and watched about half of it) after dinner. The main video is pretty bare bones repetition, plus there is an alphabet song. Very quickly my son could figure out alot of the character representations such as D is for dancing. My only hang up with this video is that some of the characters I don't understand. My husband figured out E was for earrings on the second go, still don't understand why G is sitting in a swimming pool. This might make me dumb, but if I can't figure it out I am not sure how a toddler can. I cannot really tell you what the real outcome for results is of yet as my son already actively recognizes most of the capital letters and I haven't really quizzed him, but it seems to draw in the interest and looks like it should be a good tool. One interesting thing is that the whole video is also available in Spanish. Thus, when he gets a little older and masters his first language he could view this to watch the Spanish alphabet. No miracles here, just good old fashion learning--but definitely don't feel like this was a bad idea.",1287273600,,1366,4.2984496124031

2414292,5,B000BD68AM,"Good DVD. Definately boring to me, and a little to her. Just play it over and over and eventually they will get it. My 2.5 yr old loves the alphabet song option and knows the whole thing in just one afternoon. There is also a flashcard option, but I plan on playing background music when i turn that option on. This dvd will do the trick. I am buying a phonics dvd also, to reinforce what she's learning.

Kind of boring, but its the same as if I sat down and repeated 'a' a million times and held up an 'a' flashcard. I wish the narrator was more upbeat. I wish I knew how to do voiceovers. CAPITOLS and lowercase letters!!! Love that.

This is good for younger babys and tots, like 2.5-3 yrs old and younger. I tried the leap frog letter factory and I feel like that one is made for kids who are 3.5-4 yrs old.

I plan on using this program until she gets it. The moving up into the leap frog movie.

Definately try the Meet the Numbers, Meet the Colors, and Meet the Shapes also. They are way cuter than this one, and work very well.",1270771200,,1036,4.1138613861386135
2414293,3,B000BD68AM,"I was very excited to get a dvd that would teach the alphabet. However being a teacher(kindergarten) i have always felt that teaching the sounds with the names of the letters is more effective and this dvd teaches just the letter names NOT the letter sounds. I was quite disappointed because it did not give the sounds just the names. Knowing the sounds of the letters helps a child to start reading, knowing the names of the letters doesnt. Overall, if you want your child to learn the alphabet names than this will be good for you. I want my child to learn the sounds/phonics so he can start reading, so i will be returning it. I will keep my numbers dvd. I have a 5month and he was watching it for a while, but then again he likes anything with music and tv. I got the dvd from samsclub, they also have the rest of the series, each for $9.88.",1268006400,3,845,4.254658385093168
2414294,5,B000BD68AM,"I love the idea of my children learning early, but I am too lazy to sit next to a child and teach him everything he needs to know.  I would never force a child to watch an educational video that he hated, but if they like it- why not?

This video works wonders!  My youngest (we bought it when he was 18 months) learned his letters after watching it about five times.  He was thrilled- he started recognizing and naming all the letters he saw on signs, etc. (Trips to the grocery store became even more painful!  Lots of letters!) Even now, a year later, he asks to watch it on occasion- even though we have moved on to Meet the Sight Words and Leap Frog Letter/ Words Factory.

After reading the reviews of Meet the Letters, I was skeptical.  My boys have always liked TV- but they like action packed cartoons.  I was pleasantly surprised with the reception of this video.  The movie is very repetitive, but my youngest was able to focus on it quite well. My older boys (4 and 6 at time of purchase) found it boring after the first two viewings.  They initially entertained themselves with deciphering what the cartoon had to do with each letter  (we have never figured out the letter ""O""), but after that goal was (almost) completed this video was met with groans.  Now it is reserved for when big brothers are at school!  It is not too annoying for the adults to listen to, because it is so monotonous that it is easily tuned out.  Great for captive audience in the car while doing errands!",1265155200,,1493,4.381818181818182

2414296,2,B000BD68AM,"After looking at all the great reviews this DVD has received, I added it to my 2-year-old's wishlist, and she got it as a Christmas gift.  She loves watching videos and loves the alphabet, so I thought it would be perfect for her.  Well, it may be very effective, but it is SO boring, she can barely sit through 2 minutes of it. (She can make it through full-length Disney movies, unfortunately, so this has nothing to do with her attention span.)

The program consists solely of repetition - animated letters move across the screen as an unseen narrator drones ""A... A... A..."" It's really painful, and not fun or thought-provoking at all.  It's much more like brainwashing than teaching.

If your only goal is for your child to learn the alphabet quickly, this product will probably suit your needs. If you want your child to become a thoughtful, intelligent, well-rounded individual, play with an alphabet puzzle with him, sing the alphabet song, look at books together, and watch something interesting like Sesame Street. My daughter has learned a lot more from Sesame Street's All-Star Alphabet. Let's face it - it's impossible to learn anything from a DVD that never comes out of its box.

I gave this DVD two stars instead of one (or zero) because if your goals are different than ours, or perhaps if your child is younger, it may be okay for you. It certainly does not meet the needs of our family.",1262217600,4,1406,4.672064777327935

2414298,5,B000BD68AM,I purchased Meet the Letters to help my 15 mounth old learn her letters and to have fun while doing it.  It has certainly met my expectations.  We watch it eveyday for 15 to  20 minutes and she enjoys the video and is learning her lettrs.  She will pick out letter on other objects duing the day at random.  She is excitted when she sees one she knows.  A Very worthwhile vedio.,1254528000,,378,4.180555555555555
2414299,3,B000BD68AM,"My Granddaughter, who will be 4 in one month, is not able to attend pre-school, so as her grandmother and daily care giver, I thought it would be a good idea to get this video to help with what I was already teaching her about the letters.

Although it is achieving the goal, it is so boring that it is a struggle to even get her to watch it.
Her response to watching it is ... ""Nana, do I have to.....""

So while it may be good for younger toddlers aged 3 and under, it may not be so good for older more advanced kids who as my granddaughter, if left to her own devises if I didn't watch it with her, would just open the DVD player herself and put it away.

I do hope the numbers and sight word DVD's are better or I may be sending the whole lot back.

It is very colorful and entertaining and my he loves watching it everyday. He has a speech problem and I was so surprised when he starting repeating the letters.  There in no advertisement in the video and you can forward it to the next section if you'd like.  This video is a must for little ones.,1253318400,,472,4.153846153846154

My daughter is now 18 months and learned all upper and lower case when she was 16 months old.  Her daycare is amazed she's knows her alphabet at such a young age. She's one of two kids that is ahead of the curve in her class.  I will say in the beginning when my daughter was under 12 months, she wasn't interested in this DVD.  I'd say when she was about 11 months, I'd play this little by little in the ccar as to not to overwhelm her.  What makes it fun is if you can find one of those foam mats with the alphabets.  I make it fun testing her on her letters and it gives her a different way to learn and she can touch the letters also wearing shirts with letter on it.  Gotta cover all senses.

I wish more people would give educational gifts for my little girl for Christmas, Birthday, etc...  Would make a great gift.",1248480000,,940,4.037837837837838

Now, at 21 1/2 months, he can identify and name  all the letters, uppercase and lowercase, in any order.  We found this out because one day he was playing with his Pooh teddy bear which has a t-shirt on it that says Pooh.  I listened in amazement as my 21 month old son spelled out P-O-O-H while pointing to each letter with his finger.  He can even sometimes say what letter comes next in the ABC song.  We are working on letter sounds and beginning phonics now.

Even better, he loves the DVDs.  It doesn't matter to him that its just repetition.  He's just having fun and doesn't even realize that he is learning.  So far we have only watched the letters, Colors, and Shapes.  He already knew his shapes before starting the DVDs.  Now, he has mastered his letters in less than 2 months.

To my dismay the character for the letter ""d"" is a ballerina.  Now I know that it is a ""dancer"", but she wears ballet shoes, dances on pointe, and the capital letter D has a tutu.  But the narrator only say their letter names, not their characters.  My ballerina obsessed six year old immediately said ""d, ballerina.""  I cannot imagine how these supposed experts could let an obvious conflict like that get through the planning stages, much less focus groups.

He gets this giant smile on his face when he yells out the letters, and he does this cute little dance to the song. When I first watched it I thought it was a bit boring and could not see it holding his interest, but he really loves it.  They break the video up so youcan watch it in three different sections, you canstart at A, I, or R in the alphabet.  I watch it with him because I think me next to him encouraging him helps to keep him focused.  IF you watch it in sections, they are each about ten minutes long,so it doesn't take much time at all. I would suggest making it an every day ritual. It also has a part for tricky letters that are often mixed up such as d and b, and when they really start to know the letters youcan use the videos flash card feature.

2414321,5,B000BD68AM,"The first impression I had was ""How Annoying!"" It really just repeats the names of the letters in the same boring voice (most of the time anyway) while changing the look of the letters. HOWEVER, it IS very helpful with learning letters.  During the first viewing, my 22 month old immediately started repeating what they were saying.  Frankly, I was surprised. I didn't think she could say all of the sounds.  I don't always show the entire alphabet but the DVD gives you the option to start it at the beginning, middle, or end of the alphabet. (For shorter attention spans) Also, I discovered later, that if the sequential alphabet gets on your nerves too much.. .you can just put on the flashcard part. I find this much more tolerable. The voices are ""fun""  and they randomly pick the letters. If you're looking for good practice with the letters then I recommend it.

UPDATE:  My daughter watched this 10 times... at 22 months and has ever after known her alphabet upper and lower. She started reading at 2.5. Now, at 3.5 she reads 1st and 2nd grade material. I'm not saying it's because of this video... but it definitely put her on the path to learning.",1220918400,4,1157,4.592233009708738

The only downside, if there is one,  is that once she learned her letters that was it, no more interest in watching it.  I am totally ok with that,  we use other methods to keep her practicing.  Just be prepared, if your child is a fast learner this will serve it's purpose in a short period and then be ready to pass on for another child's benefit.

My youngest son has special needs & mainly uses sign language as a form of communication.  My son can learn all sorts of things from these videos that he was unable to learn in preshcool.  With just days of ""Meet the Numbers"" he knew several numbers and with 2 weeks of ""Meet the Letters"" he was able to name many letters on the cover of Meet the Numbers.  This is a big deal because just saying words clear enough for us to understand is hard yet he was able to say these things.  I even consider somewhat of a speech therapy while he does the video because he talks along with them.  With the simple & repetitive style it is very easy to pick up and they associate the characters with what they are leraning and are able to generatlize it into every day activities.  I HIGHLY recomend this item not only for normal children but for those with special needs.  We use our's in the car on the way to school.  Better then just sitting there!",1206662400,,1089,4.907103825136612

But for my 22 month old, it was AMAZING.  He watched it every day for a month, and he now knows ALL of his letters, uppercase and lowercase.  He even reads them to me upside down.  He just turned 25 months old, and we are now working on the sounds each letter makes.  I'm on my way to buy Meet the numbers and meet the shapes now.  I love how well and quickly my son learns things from these movies!

My son is 3 and I wanted something a bit more interactive to help him with letter recognition and pre-reading skills.
If you are looking for this for an infant - 18 month old then I absolutley recommend it. Othewise, check out the leapfrog videos - much better for the preschool genre.",1202601600,7,617,4.660550458715596

2414332,5,B000BD68AM,"We got this for our son before he was a year old.  We put it on for short periods of time at home and he seemed to show an interest.  When he was able to sit forward facing in his car seat is when the benefits started to show.

I have to drive my two older children to school and back every day since they go to a Catholic school.  We have a DVD player in our van and I started putting this on for my son since he was a captive audience.  There isn't much else for a child of one to do while sitting in the car for 20 minutes at a time.  I was surprised at how interested he was in it.  He really enjoyed watching it, though the older kids found it painful.  We played this for a while, but he was a late talker (so were my others) and he didn't want to show me the letters I asked in his book so I wasn't sure if it was making a difference.

Jump ahead to now.  My son is 21 months old.  He knows all of his letters.  Instead of his beginning speech being words, it was letters.  I think this made it easier for him because now he learns a new word every day, I think by putting the basic letter sounds he could say together helped immensely.  The other benefit I forsee is reading.  He is like a child who just learned how to read.  When they first get the grasp of reading, they can't help but read everything before their eyes.  My son is constantly saying the letters he sees.  He loves to watch shows like Jeopardy because he runs to the TV, points to the letters, and says them with excitement in his voice, like he realizes they are a part of something bigger and not just something from a kids' show!  Now my son brings me his Magna Doodle and puts my hand on his to help him draw the letters.  This did not happen with my older children who are both very good and avid readers.

I believe that all children could benefit from this, even if they only take away a familiarity with the sound and shape of the letters.  I wish they had this for my older children.  I would recomend this for any child who doesn't know their whole alphabet yet.  I hope you get results as amazing as we were fortunate to!",1190160000,,2109,4.002398081534772

Both my 10-month-old and my 2-1/2 year old were transfixed.  I have only had it for about 3 weeks, but already I can tell that my toddler is able to recognize some of the letters more easily now....especially those in the beginning of the alphabet lineup.

Though the animation is simple and the sound effects are a little ""freaky,"" my kids love this....and I feel good knowing they're learning while being entertained.  Highly recommended.",1183248000,,701,4.75206611570248

Within three weeks she not only knew all her upper- and lowercase letters, but she was also obsessed with letters.  We have the foam ""puzzle piece"" letters that go on the floor - she would pick out her favorite and take it to bed at night or have to carry it to the store.  She watched the video obsessively for a few months until she'd had enough, and now at nearly three she still knows all her letters in spite of not watching the video anymore.  She was similarly enamored with the numbers (Meet the Numbers) and colors (Meet the Colors) and learned each in rapid succession.  We went to the eye doctor several weeks ago, and the nurse was astounded that a two-year-old could actually (and easily) read the letters on the eye chart.

We've now started our 15 month old watching this video.  She is a little young, but has really started talking so she's in the right developmental timeframe.  She has nowhere near the attention span and focus of our older daughter, yet she, too, is mesmerised by this video and is becoming obsessed with letters.  It is truly amazing.

Sadly, he did not have much exposure to the alphabet prior to this video so we were extremely happy with how quickly he learned.  I thought he would get bored with it because it's very repetitious (eg. the letter 'A' is repeated several times with the image flashing in different positions) but they do use that same letter 'A' as a cute character (a rocket that takes off into the sky while saying 'A') which my child loves.  Each letter (both upper and lower-case) has a different character (although the upper and lower-case of each letter is similar - for example, letter 'A' and 'a' are both rockets in different environments).  The kids voices used for the characters are also endearing to hear over-and-over...which we do watch over-and-over-and-over at my oldest son's request.

I was pregnant, very tired, and feeling like I was neglecting my toddler especially since I had started propping him in front of the TV.  Meet the Letters is his favorite video and within two weeks he knew his Uppercase and Lowercase letters.  I could not believe it!  I bought the rest of the family (numbers, colors, shapes)and he faithfully watched them while I dealt with his new baby brother and homeschooled his big sister.  In two weeks more he learned all his numbers, shapes, and colors, and still loves watching the films at least twice a day.  I now purchase these for all toddlers birthday's!

I was amazed because she didn't pay full attention to the video when it was on, she would kind of play around it. I showed her some more letters and asked her where the ""B"" was and she pointed to it. She knew about 10 more letters after that.

2414343,5,B000BD68AM,"I bought this product on a whim -- Baby Einstein wasn't really holding my young toddler's attention, and I was looking for something educational for her to watch during those instances where I need to get things done around the house.

What a fortunate ""accident"". My 18-month old daughter now knows her letters, numbers and shapes (and we just got colors) thanks to these videos. As another reviewer noted, the really exciting part isn't just that she has learned to recognize these things on screen, but can identify them in the world around her as well! She gets so excited to call them out as we're driving down the street, and you can really see her love for learning developing as she's so proud of her knowledge.

The methodology used in the videos is exactly as described -- a simple and straightforward yet entertaining presentation. Personally, what I like about these videos is a very low ""parent irritation"" factor. I find the voices to be unintrusive, and they use great music -- lovely renditions of classic songs. All of this is very fortunate for me, as even though my daughter has mastered the material, she still loves watching them... she still chooses ""Letters"" over other favorites ""Dora"" and ""Blues Clues"" most of the time.

In sum, I can't recommend these videos highly enough (to the point that I was actually moved enough to do my first Amazon review!). They are now my standard gift to family and friends with children this age.",1171584000,2,1454,4.761904761904762

2414345,3,B000BD68AM,"After reading these great reviews I decided to purchase this DVD.  And, I think I need to warn other parents, like myself, who have already introduce more ""exciting"" television material to our children.  My son is already a PRO at watching educational programming.  He's just 18 months and knows/recognizes all his (capital letters), phonics, shapes, colors, and numbers to 10.  This video was MUCH TOO SLOW for him.  I purchased it because I wanted him to get more familiar with lower case alphabets... but, he just isn't very interested in this format.  On the other hand, he LOVES Leap Frog's Letter Factory (and the corresponding magnetic refrigerator toy they sell)!  Leap Frog's is similar in concept, but goes well-BEYOND just showing a letter and naming it over and over and over, and turning it into a cartoon... Which is really all this video does.  This video simply starts with a lowercase ""a"" in black/white typeset and say ""ay, ay, ay"" as the letter ""a"" flashes around the screen.  Then the letter turns into a cartoon, and the ""ay, ay, ay"" continues while the animation moves a little.  Then it moves on to a capital ""A"", and does the exact same thing.  This goes on for all 26 letters and ends with the ABC song.  With Leap Frog, there are phonics, a variety of original tunes, cute characters, and an entertaining plot.  This ""Meet the Letters"" DVD just doesn't compare.  Although, if your child has had little experience with television, this might be a good start.",1167868800,56,1483,4.764705882352941
2414346,4,B000BD68AM,"We love Meet The Letters. The presentaion is crisp and clear.

My daughter watched Sesame Street's ""Jungle Alphabet"" for about 3 weeks, in which she learned the letters ""m"" and ""u"". While she loved watching it, I thought she needed a better learning tool.

I was afraid she wouldn't like Meet The Letters, because it doesn't look as entertaining as ""Alphabet Jungle"" (shows how much me, an adult, knows).

I'm happy to reporrt she loves this DVD, and like most others, learned the alphabet in about 2 weeks!

When watching ""Alphabet Jungle"", she would just sit and watch. As mentioned before, she'd only call out letters ""m"" and ""u"".

But, after watching ""Meet The Letters"", she would repeat the narrator. Before long, she'd call out the letters before it is called (you could tell the creators did a study, because there's a long, pregnated pause after the letter pops up on the screen, allowing the kids to call it first. Or she simply watched ""Jojo's Circus"" and ""Dora The Explorer"").

And, like the reviewer before me, now she's mad about calling all the letters she sees! It tickled me when we went to the park and she'd read the letters on the blocks. She'd read signs while we're traveling, etc (the other night she went ""T...J...M...A...X...X.."").

I have one very major gripe with this DVD, though. It's the really high pitched voices of some of the letter ""characters"". In those cases they sound pretty bad, eg"" the letter ""n"". In those cases, I only let my daughter listens to the adult narrator.

This brings me to the ""ABC"" song at the end. Boy, it sounds horribly unnatural. Everybody knows the cadence of the song. Well, it doesn't sound like it here. eg: The letter ""Z"" sounds like he's going to continue talking (his intonation goes up, like there's another letter coming up). They should've just used the kids natural voices and recorded the song fresh, instead of picking the voices from the program.

In all, this is a very good DVD that I highly recommend.",1158883200,33,1977,4.707246376811594
