8367119,5,B002EAYEBA,"The Red Lily is an excellent film; everything is very well done and I was captivated by the story. Another reviewer writes that the plot is somewhat contrived; but it all holds its own nevertheless. Enid Bennett, Ramon Novarro, Wallace Berry and the rest of the cast all give outstanding performances; the acting is very convincing. The cinematography is quite well done and the tinted footage adds so much--I liked the yellow/orange hue effect when Enid's character lights a candle in one scene; and the blue tint for evening scenes is very effective. The choreography reflects much forethought and the musical score enhances the film. The often tense plot moves along at a very good pace; I wasn't ever bored--this film is all THAT good.

When the action starts, we meet sweethearts since childhood, Jean Leonnec (Ramon Novarro) and Marise La Noue (End Bennett). They live in a small village in Brittany, an area of France. They also intend to marry despite the sharp disapproval of Jean's father Hugo, the Mayor (Frank Currier). Unfortunately, fate has other plans for them. When Marise's father dies unexpectedly, she is impoverished and she now must live with her next of kin in squalid conditions; and they're not very likeable people at that. The father is an abusive drunkard who fights with his disheveled wife and they have too many out of control children. One particularly bad night Marise flees to her old home which remains abandoned; there she meets Jean by chance and the young couple plans to go to Paris, no matter what Jean's father says, so they can be married there and start their lives anew.

However, when Jean leaves Marise only temporarily to find out where they can marry, his father has police arrest him on charges that he stole money. Jean escapes from the train and although his father finds out that Jean was innocent after all, Jean still thinks he's a fugitive and avoids police at all costs. Meanwhile, Marise is left at the train station and after much time passes and her bags are stolen she realizes to her dismay that she's on her own. Maries tries job after job unsuccessfully while Jean descends into a life of crime with his new friend Bo-Bo (Wallace Beery). Marise is eventually forced into prostitution just to survive.

Jean and Marise reunite but things are scarcely cordial; at one point Jean publicly mocks Marise along with his ""friends"" who are literally partners-in-crime. Whether or not Jean escapes a life of crime and if he and Marise ever reconnect on better terms is the focus of the rest of the film.
Unfortunately, there are no bonus extras; all we get is the ability to jump forward or backward in ten minute intervals. The quality of the print is generally quite good although it could be better in a few places.

The Red Lily is a stunning film; it proves that with excellent acting and pantomime you really can tell a story using silent film without an overabundance of intertitles. Fans of Ramon Novarro; Enid Bennett and Wallace Beery would do well to add this to their collections; people who appreciate silent films with drama will not be disappointed.",1345852800,3,3118,4.800744878957169
8367120,5,B002EAYEBA,"""The Red Lily"" captured my interest from the get-go! A great silent melodrama with surprising plot twists and turns, and fabulous acting! The musical score enhanced the drama perfectly! I won't go into all the details, since that has already been done. Just take my word--this movie is riveting! It completely turned my emotions inside out! Added to my list of favorite silent movies of all time.",1341964800,6,396,4.925373134328358
8367121,5,B002EAYEBA,"Those who dislike silent film would find it easy to mine this splendid film for reasons to support their prejudice.  The story is contrived, even elaborately so; some of the characters in it are simply the stock characters of 19th century melodrama;  character depth and complexity are at a minimum here; there is a schism in the acting styles of the performers, some drawing on the more formalized theatrical conventions which prevailed on the screen in the Teens and early Twenties, others already performing in the more naturalistic style familiar to us today; and those who patiently bear with all of the preceding may feel sabotaged by the story's outcome.  But it would only be those predisposed to find fault with the film who would pay much notice to any of the above, as, when one surrenders one's self to the production, one is borne along by its many beauties.

The story's contrivances--conscious and unashamed--are not gratuitous; they are thematically necessary.  The director's canny use early on of what was already a well-worn clich by the time the picture was made--I refer to the oncoming locomotive--is, in my opinion, not only symbolic of the larger issues of the film but also his way of prepping the audience's sensibilities  for the broad strokes of the oncoming plot.  By the time this motif comes to its apotheosis in the film--I am being vague here to avoid spoilers--we perhaps come to understand that normal life too is lived through broad strokes and near-misses.

The era in which his important acting took place, as well as his shocking death, combine to distance us from Ramon Novarro.  This is a profound pity, as few actors at any time in the history of cinema inhabit a role to the degree that Novarro does; few actors can make their often uniquely disjunct characters resonate in us as does Novarro.  Though this is one of his earlier films, he shows not only this ability to serve as a vehicle of empathy but also the great range of his talent in developing his role from that of a guileless country boy to that of an embittered denizen of the criminal underworld.  In his career, he did not often have the opportunity to play ""bad""; here he shows that he had the acting chops to deliver hardened viciousness no less than his customary ardent love.

Enid Bennett--the wife of the film's director, Fred Niblo--similarly is called on to deliver a range of emotion in her role in the odyssey her character moves through in life.  Successful in this in the terms of her era, she perhaps most of any of the principals evokes, particularly in sentimental moments, the older style of acting which, for those unaccustomed to it, may take a little getting used to to appreciate properly.  And yet, within this context, she delivers a wonderfully nuanced and affecting performance.

At the head of the secondary roles is that played by Wallace Beery, perfectly cast as a raffish but likeable street criminal, his acting style being the most natural and modern of all.  It could be argued that, over the course of his career, Beery is usually just playing Wallace Beery; but I've never seen him in anything from early in his career to late in which I did not come away enthusiastic about his professionalism and dedication to his role.

Production values are high in this film.  The set designer obviously went to great lengths to evoke, realistically, the decaying and decadent corners of Paris.

The currently-available DVD version, a Turner Classic Movie restoration, gives us ""The Red Lily"" in black and white splendor with its original moody and evocative tinting.  The musical score is a new one, largely successful; and yet I have just one quibble with it:  My impression is that the new composer was not ""on board"" with the spirit of the final scene of the show.  See what you think!",1314662400,9,3818,4.788109756097561
8367122,5,B002EAYEBA,"This film would not have been as good as it is if it had been performed with sound dialogue. It is a prime example of why silent cinema performed via pantomime is interesting today. The story is basically about how two sweet innocent people, when cruelly separated by an injustice and kept apart by bad timing, end up turning to a life of crime when left friendless on the streets of Paris. The boy, Jean, does so with gusto. Marise does so after trying all forms of manual labor to scrape by and getting whacked to the curb one too many times by the closing of factories where she has found employment, and even by being fired by a boss when she rejects his advances.

One of the most shattering scenes to me is when Marise (Enid Bennett) rescues from the police someone whom she thinks is just some random man on the streets of Paris. Instead, it is her former fianc, Jean (Ramon Navarro) turned into the thief he was wrongly accused of being years before. When he sees her haggard face compared to ""the face of an angel"" memory, and sees what she has been reduced to in terms of making a living, he turns all of his anger on her. At first she is ashamed, blurting out excuses, but soon she accepts his derision as what you feel she has become accustomed to. The young man even takes her to his fellow-thief friends and laughs at her, trying to stamp out any memories of his feelings. Ramon Navarro rocks quite convincingly between loathing and love in these scenes, and although much has been justly said about Enid Bennett's performance here, I think we need to give Ramon Navarro his dues too.

This film is artfully shot and, up to the last couple of minutes, takes you to a very dark but believable place. The last two minutes are the reason I say this one is more of 4.5 instead of 5 stars, because even though it is the ending you want to see, it does not seem plausible. Highly recommended in spite of the tacked on happy ending.

This is a DVD-R with no extras and no chapter stops. You may only go forwards and backwards in 10 minute increments. The film was restored by Turner Classic Movies in 2006 complete with a new score, and that is the version you are getting here. The video quality is excellent and I highly recommend it.",1261872000,13,2243,4.374100719424461
