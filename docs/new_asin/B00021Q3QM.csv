For any Die hard HHH fan, you'll be happy with it, but he never breaks character, It's more about the matches than all of the other things that he does that keep people watching. The extras, are nothing more than the things that led to the matches. Make no mistake, He's That Damn Good, but the DVD? Not so much.",1096070400,4,436,4.329268292682927
2054550,5,B00021Q3QM,"Before Shawn Michaels emerged from the Vault, before Mick Foley landed his Greatest Hits and Misses, and even before the Ultimate Ric Flair Collection sold a single disc, Triple H was That Damn Good!

Shortly after the DVD release of The Game, World Wrestling Entertainment released That Damn Good, which was a three-hour program hosted by Triple H himself discussing seven of his greatest matches shown in chronological order, a format that was used on those aforementioned releases.

The matches started with Armageddon 1999 where Triple H beat Vince McMahon in a brutal street fight.  The most historical footnote in this match was the launching of the McMahon-Helmsley Era when Triple H and Stephanie McMahon showed their marriage had potential.

Once Triple H united with his wife and regained the WWF Championship, his first major challenger was Mick Foley and this disc included the infamous Royal Rumble Street Fight with Cactus Jack.  This match has been included on more DVD releases than any other match has (albeit often clipped).

After Triple H lost the WWF World title, he began a memorable feud with Chris Jericho, which climaxed with an incredible Last Man Standing match between the two at Fully Loaded.  This match has often been left behind by history, but it has its share of fans.  And those fans need to buy this release to own this match on DVD.

Triple H had another shot at the WWF World title at SummerSlam 2000 when he and Kurt Angle challenged The Rock in a Triple Threat match.  This match was best remembered for causing Kurt Angle a concussion when Triple H gave him a Pedigree through the broadcast table.

Finally, Triple H achieved his greatest upset.  The match was one month before WrestleMania X-Seven.  It was voted the Match of the Year in 2001.  And it sent Triple H and Stone Cold through three stages of hell.  Stone Cold pinned Triple H with a Stone Cold Stunner before Triple H beat Stone Cold in a street fight.  The decisive fall was competed in a steel cage, and in the end, Triple H defeated Stone Cold.

Shortly thereafter, Triple H suffered a tear in one of his quadriceps, which kept him out of the ring for eight months.  The program picked up with Triple H making his anticipated return at Madison Square Garden.

Finally, the program concluded at WrestleMania X8 where Triple H defeated Undisputed WWF Champion Chris Jericho, much to the dismay of Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley.

The DVD extra on this release was the promos for each match leading into the major events.  (NOTE: WrestleMania X8 did not have a full-length promo, so instead, they included footage with Chris Jericho, Stephanie, and Triple H's bulldog Lucy.)",1092960000,5,2675,4.848017621145375

8020049,5,B00021Q3QM,"NOTE: I updated this review in 2012.

I'll get to the point in that backstage politics aside, Triple H is one of the best performers (when he wants to be) in the industry today & has been for around the past 15 years.  Now a couple of notes here in that this was an F.Y.E. exclusive DVD at that time so it's a rare collection & it did come out in 2002 before WWE started editing & blurring out all ""Attitude Era"" logos & references so the matches are in their original format.

Street Fight Match vs. Vince McMahon - The stipulations going into this match was that Triple H would get another shot at the WWE Championship if he won but would divorce Stephanie, who he tricked into marrying him, if he lost while Stephanie was in the front row.  Vince blinded Triple H right from the start getting the advantage taking this fight out to ringside & in the crowd before Mankind came with a shopping cart full of weapons that came into use such as a trash can & crutch but Triple H rebounded & used the weapons to his advantage such a road sign & a chain along with part of the entrance set as well.  Both men went back & forth taking the fight backstage to the outside of the building where they were fighting on top of a limo before Vince almost become a victim of what happened to Stone Cold a month earlier before the match was brought back to the inside where Vince was met with a very nasty fall.  Triple H focused on taunting Stephanie while demanding that Vince ""STAY DOWN!"" & went as far as to bring his sledgehammer into play before Vince used some dirty tactics & tried to even the odds with a pipe of his own.  To date (and for a while afterwords), this was the best match Vince McMahon ever participated in as it looked like a fight over a serious issue between these two with the ending that shocked us all & changed the careers of EVERYONE involved...including their real lives.
Armageddon '99
[McMahon]

WWE Championship/Street Fight Match vs. Cactus Jack - Knowing how violent this match was going to be, Triple H sent Stephanie to the back before the match started & he was right in doing that as we saw both men target each others heads in the opening minutes with the steel steps & ring bell being used before a chair was brought into play with Cactus daring Triple H to use it before nailing him with it with Cactus later using the chair to give a legdrop onto Triple H.  The brawl went to the through the crowd & to the stage where Triple H was suplexed onto a wooden pallet that ended up stabbing him in the leg while also taking hits with the steps & a trash can but things really got intense when the barbed wire baseball bat came into play with Foley taking many shots with it to the back while Triple H was a victim of what Jim Ross called ""deadly birth control"" & heavily bleeding from the bat being driven into his face.  The fight once again went back to the outside with the result being the announce table completely covered in blood before Cactus was thrown into & eventually through the steel steps as Triple H was attempting to recreate history from a year earlier with handcuffs & chairs which didn't work out the way he expected as Cactus still fought back including another low blow & unexpected help for Cactus before the fight came back into the ring filled with thumbtacks.  Triple H once said that this was a hardcore war that took fans on a roller coaster of emotions but also told a story as everything used served a purpose & I couldn't agree more as this was the match that definitely put Triple H on the map as a long term main event player.
Royal Rumble '00
[History Of The WWE Championship; Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses; Triple H: The Game]

Last Man Standing Match vs. Chris Jericho - Both men brawled right away & took the fight to the outside before Triple H focused on Jericho's injured ribs, from a previous attack by Triple H & DX, using the tape to choke him & working that area with various holds such as a suplex on the outside, abdominal stretch, sleeper hold with a body scissors, countering an attempt at a Lionsault with his knees into those ribs, using a chair, and Stephanie getting a shot in on the outside.  Triple H kept beating on Jericho & punching him until Jericho dared him to give him more before Jericho started to play dirty himself going low on Triple H & nailing a chairshot that busted Triple H open before delivering a bulldog onto that same chair but Triple H kept fighting back using the steel steps on Jericho's ribs before both men ended up having the same idea when it came to the TV monitors & later when it came to the spanish table with Stephanie getting a receipt for her interference as well.  While Triple H & Jericho have had a heavy amount of matches throughout their careers, this was definitely in the top 3 as one of their best encounters with Jericho showing the aggression that we don't really see out of him often.
Fully Loaded '00

vs. WWE Champion The Rock vs. Kurt Angle - Although this is a match from the WWE Championship, that was more of an afterthought in the minds of the challengers as Triple H came to the ring looking for revenge against Kurt Angle to kissing his wife Stephanie to the point where Triple H brawled with Kurt & ended up delivering a pedigree on the spanish table that gave away causing Kurt to land on his head knocking him out & had him taken to the back before The Rock even made his entrance to start the match. The Rock finally made his way to the ring brawling with Triple H back to the stage area (with Triple H continuing to beat on Angle despite being on a stretcher) before fighting back to the ring with Stephanie coming out (despite Triple H earlier telling her to stay backstage) only to accidentally hit her husband with the title belt. Triple H resorted to using the sledgehammer to gain an advantage by working over the midsection of The Rock while Stephanie was able to drag Kurt Angle back down to ringside to help Triple H only for Angle to break up his pin & throw Triple H into the steps. Angle went for revenge against Triple H by trying to use the sledgehammer himself but Stephanie stopped him only for Triple H to accidentally end up hitting Stephanie before Angle went ahead & used the hammer allowing Rock to take advantage of the entire situation. Triple H has gone on record saying how this is the most unusual match he's ever been in & quite frankly, I can't disagree as it was in reality The Rock vs. Triple H featuring Kurt Angle but was definitely entertaining.
As a side note, the pedigree through the table on Kurt Angle was so impactful that WWE continued to show that clip for years during the commercials asking people to ""Please Don't Try This At Home.""
SummerSlam '00
[History Of The WWE Championship; The Epic Journey Of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson]

3 Stages Of Hell vs. Steve Austin - This was the first ever ""3 Stages Of Hell"" match which was a traditional 2 Out Of 3 Falls match with the twist being that each different fall would be contested under a different stipulation which in this case was the falls being a regular match, street fight, and a steel cage if the third fall was necessary (and lets be honest, they wouldn't tease all 3 falls & not do them).  Triple H targeted Austin's previously injured neck right away with various neckbreakers & blows directly on the neck before also attacking Austin's bad knees using the ringpost & figure four.  Both men began brawling on the outside throughout the crowd eventually making their way through the spanish table using whatever was around them from the monitors to a chair with Triple H even using Mick Foley's ""Barbie"" to bust Austin before he returned the favor with his ""Steveweiser"" before both men used the chair in their unique way with Triple H executing a neckbreaker on it & Austin's head landing on it after a back suplex with Austin nailing a chairshot that busted Triple H open as well.  The match did to go the third fall with both men using the cage to their advantage while the weapons from the street fight were still in the ring & used to their advantage from ""Barbie"" to the sledgehammer with both men were able to execute either the pedigree or stunner they beat each other into exhaustion to the very end where it took both men several moments just to stand after the match.  As I stated earlier, this match was the first of it's kind that also had a big buildup going into it as their feud had been going on for over a year but definitely was a WrestleMania quality encounter.
No Way Out '01
[Legacy Of Stone Cold Steve Austin]

vs. WWE Undisputed Champion Chris Jericho - Both men came into this WrestleMania main event switching roles from what they've had in the past against each other as Chris Jericho was the champion & accompanied by HHH's ex-wife Stephanie McMahon while Triple H walked into this match as the challenger & fan favorite looking for revenge for not only Jericho injuring his quad almost a year earlier but also getting his revenge on Stephanie for all the problems she put him through for weeks.  Triple H had his knee wrapped up from a previous attack with the sledgehammer a week earlier on RAW as Jericho kept trying to attack it while Triple H ended up hurting it himself when he did a high knee yet still was able to get some offense in such as launching Jericho off the top rope into the front row before suplexing him back ringside & working over his leg with a figure four.  Stephanie was able to cause a distraction allowing Jericho to once again target the leg using the ringpost along with drilling the leg into the match causing Triple H to heavily favor the leg as he kept hurting it when he went on the offense including the fight on the announce table that left an opening for Jericho to turn the tables on Triple H & eventually apply the Walls Of Jericho.  This match had a lot of issues going into it such as the buildup itself revolved about Triple H's issues with Stephanie more than Chris Jericho as Jericho was booked as a secondary figure despite being the Undisputed Champion (you'll see evidence of this if you watch the highlight package as he was walking Stephanie's dog & cleaning up it's poop) so it was all about when he going to finally get his hands on Stephanie while another factor was that this match went on last when Hogan vs. Rock went on two matches earlier & completely exhausted the crowd to the point where nobody was able to follow it as the crowd was dead for a majority of the match.  They told a good story in regards to Triple H's leg & made up for this match months later with a Hell In A Cell match but the match had so much going against it going in that it wasn't going to live up to the hype of a WrestleMania main event.
WrestleMania X8

Also on this set is Triple H's return to WWE in 2002 while the DVD extras include all the pre-match highlight videos leading into the matches.  Overall this was more of a showcase of Triple H during his first initial years as a main event talent than a ""best of"" collaboration (that would come later with ""King Of Kings"") & with it also containing the Last Man Standing match against Jericho that's been in very high demand for years that this is one collaboration for fans of Triple H to get.",1140825600,19,11254,4.392891450528338
8020050,5,B00021Q3QM,"Triple H is the bomb and this DVD is fantastic!  Getting to see Triple H's glisening muscles covered in sweat on DVD is a dream come true.  I'm weak in the knees just thinking about it!  The material on this DVD is proof to all us Trile H-philes that H is real and wrestling is real.  Why Triple H hasn't conquered Hollywood yet, I don't know.  He needs to be starring in a DIABLO movie.  I wish Triple H were my dad...
