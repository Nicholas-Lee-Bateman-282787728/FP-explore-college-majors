8213827,5,B000UMRD7G,I bought this because I love Paula Deen.  She is such a joy to watch.  There's something inauthentic about Giada that I don't like.  I doubt she eats any of her recipes because she looks anorexic.  Her head is too big for her body too.  She's pretty much a chickenhead ho.  I still have no idea who the other guy is and I don't really care.  TEAM PAULA ALL DAY EVERYDAY!,1423872000,,370,4.126760563380282
8213828,5,B000UMRD7G,Everything I was hoping to see and it gives you a great look at some of the older programs,1413072000,,90,3.789473684210526
8213829,5,B000UMRD7G,I found this dandy item in darn near mint condition at a local used book/cd/dvd store for $5.00. If you love Paula...and/or Giada...and deserts and chocolate then you will love this dvd because you get all of that on this DVD set. Th Food Network series (seasons) are hard to find and are not cheap... used or new - this is a pretty good price and lots of luck when they run out.,1400284800,,379,4.205479452054795
