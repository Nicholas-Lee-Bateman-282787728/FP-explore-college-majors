7897218,4,6305761167,"Cura is a recent enthusiasm of mine. I only just heard him for the first time a few months ago.
There is a review of another edition of this same concert that only gives it one star. The reviewer says that he is so turned off by Cura's presumed arrogance that he just threw the disc out ! I see what he means, but also think that he totally misreads Cura's stage deportment. Cura sets himself an awesome challenge here, that of singing, playing the piano and conducting the chorus and orchestra in several of the pieces. What the reviewer reads as arrogance is simply the concentration necessary for the performer to carry out his difficult task !
His singing is attractive throughout the wide ranging program. He sings three African-American spirituals in his own arrangements, pieces from the Berlioz TE DEUM and the Verdi REQUIEM, Ramirez, Franck's PANIS ANGELICUS, and in what I think is the only artistic mistake here, ""Somewhere"" from Bernstein's WEST SIDE STORY. Cura sings it well, but it has nothing to do with Easter !!! (Why didn't he do something from Bernstein's MASS instead ?)
The filming in this series is not terribly imaginative, and the sonic ambiance is not ideal, but overall, an attractive and appealing Holiday program.
The choral and orchestral numbers not involving Cura are ably conducted by Msgr. Pablo Colino.",1489363200,,1337,4.842794759825328
