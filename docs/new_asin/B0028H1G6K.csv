3872704,5,B0028H1G6K,"While Clinton does use some already trained horses , I have used his training methods on other not so trained horses. These videos are set to teach , as a 28 year coach i use a'lot of the same for teaching players how to use their body and feet to move a ball. The simple way of breaking every thing down so any one can learn is very important, and this is what set Clinton Anderson apart from all the others in this Industry. The lessons in this or any of his dvd's should be used for what they are, I have learned so much from watching these videos and when i have friends ask me if they can watch them , and knowing they are life time horsemen and also famous pro rodeo team ropers , it tells me a'lot about the way Clinton Anderson teaches. I have also watched others who i respect as very top line horse trainers , such as Chris Cox , and Craig Cameron. All i can say is learn from every one, you will learn better ways to help your horse and yourself .

3872705,4,B0028H1G6K,"The Clinton Anderson - Horsemanship 101 was tailored towards teaching the person how to work with a horse that is already trained...Clinton even refers to this several times on the DVD.  But he does very briefly mention how to work a horse if it resists.  I did enjoy the DVD and thru it found out what I'm looking for is the Gaining Respect series DVDs...Clinton refers to these DVD's for training the horse.  If I had a ""Clinton Anderson"" trained horse it would be just what I need.",1295481600,12,484,4.4772727272727275

8356265,5,B0028H1G6K,"If you are a timid rider or a rider that needs more confidence both on the ground and in the saddle, then Horsemanship 101 would prove very beneficial for you to watch.  Clinton Anderson teaches a fearful rider techniques both in groundwork and in western riding that a viewer could easily incorporate when riding his/her own horses. This series focuses more on helping the rider gain confidence and skill in working on the ground and in the saddle at a walk, trot and canter than it does in training the horse, though groundwork exercises are shown. The basics are covered for the beginner and advanced beginner. Refinement in riding skills is not covered. The One Rein Stop is used throughout the training sessions so that the rider and viewer can learn control in an emergency situation. The techniques and information are explained so well that the viewer, even one without an instructor, can transfer this instruction to their own horse. I do  not usually buy Clinton Anderson DVDs but found this DVD series one of the best of any trainer's  I've viewed in regards to basic information for the rider about the horse and about riding with confidence and having control over the horse. This series covers a range of topics including purchasing a horse for a timid beginner rider both children and adults. Watching this rider go from no confidence (actually screaming at times from fear when riding) to cantering barrels with confidence is truly an amazing journey with lots of knowledgeable tips and advice that are practical and useful. If you looking for a DVD that helps with confidence issues and focuses on the basics in horse's knowledge and in groundwork & riding, then this DVD series would fit.  I don't write many reviews. But this series was just too good not to let others know how it helps with confidence issues.",1445990400,2,1829,4.8152866242038215

8356267,5,B0028H1G6K,"Wonderful set for the first time horse buyer or to someone who's being reintroduced to horses!
It's alot of much needed information!

Stuff you wanted to know but felt too stupid to ask!

What this isnt. This only touches on training this is mostly useful information for horse ownership. Although I highly suggest clinton anderson and buck Brannaman for training. They both make it tangabble and easy to understand.

If you want more round penning excesses and training I suggest you find clinton Andersons fun dementals set or colt starting if your starting out.

But I would absolutly suggest everyone buys this set!",1425254400,3,619,4.980582524271845

8356271,5,B0028H1G6K,"Good learning to augment your live lessons.  I learn to ""back"" a horse (who was not trained in Clinton's technique) in less than 5 minutes!  By all horseman's standards I would be considered a beginner.

Great practical care information.

Clinton had to ask and pretty much answer his own questions about vet. care and what problems to look for when buying a horse as his guest vet was a bit camera shy and did not answer Clinton's questions
 Overall, well worth the money.  I am a former Psychology teacher and ""see, do, see"" method.  really works for a lot of people!",1393718400,5,569,4.574257425742574
8356272,5,B0028H1G6K,"I just bought my first horse and I am learning natural horsemanship. I highly recommend this DVD to all newbies! It tells you everything the others don't from why horses do what they do, how to groom, feed. How they think. And most importantly how to be safe. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I have now moved on to Clinton's Fundamentals series and had a 3 day clinic with one of his certified clinicians. This was a good starter DVD for his training method.",1391731200,9,444,4.493827160493828
8356273,5,B0028H1G6K,This DVD set is a great learning tool for someone with little experience as me working horses.  The DVD set has taught me a great deal and I have bought other DVD's from him.  Love his technique!,1388448000,4,195,4.243243243243243
