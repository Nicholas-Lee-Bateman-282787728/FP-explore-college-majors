861674,2,630437528X,"This movie reeked.  Not just of bad acting or plot, but it suffered the unfortunate disease known as cornymonsteritis.  The monster in this movie, Grim, was less than scary, just kinda corny.  This movie will tug at you in  the night time, giving you equally corny nightmares.  However, I decided to  add one extra star since this movie had its share of gore and a few cool  scenes.  All in all, it still sucked!",917481600,5,412,4.472972972972973

861827,1,630437528X,"A spirit board awakens an ancient evil in the form of a bloodthirsty troll that kidnaps and kills anyone who crosses its path in GRIM, Paul Matthews' first awful film. GRIM offers nothing more than bad acting, an incohesive plot, and dreadful special effects (outside of the actual creature design). There is absolutely no continuity, rhyme, or reason behind the creature's attacks, as it just randomly appears and disappears at will, killing characters before they even have the opportunity to be introduced. It is a purposeless film with a dull story that manages to abuse all of the senses at once with its grating score. Simply unwatchable.

861881,3,630437528X,"This film is brought to you by the Paul Matthews clan. I obtained my copy as part of a movie 8-pack from Walmart called, ""The Midnight Horror Collection"" which includes other films of the same caliber such as ""Deadly Instincts"" or ""Breeders,"" another Paul Matthews production which included some of the same no talent cast from this film.

The film worked best when it was campy. When they deviated from the campy style, the movie was just bad. Kadamba Simmons stars as Katy. Her acting wasn't good enough to do porno films so she worked with Paul. She would go on to become ""Space Girl"" in ""Breeders."" In this film her past time is to play with a hand made Ouija board, become demon possessed, have red glowing eyes, and explain what happened like only a drama school drop out can.

The creature that she connects to lives in a mine under the community, a mine that can only be entered by a cave climbing down a rope. The creature, which wasn't half bad for a low budget production, can pass through rock (seriously?), collect chairs, and chain up women (Nadia DeLemeny) in the proverbial tattered slip. Nadia, as the chained up woman had the best lines as she descends into madness.

This is not a good horror film. It has some camp value which might make it worth while watching as a group purchase, i.e aforesaid 8-pack as opposed to a single purchase.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, no sex or nudity. Fake looking body parts. 3 stars on a camp scale.",1352073600,2,1449,4.540229885057471
861882,5,630437528X,"Grim,is a fantastic movie. it is not exspensive to prchas on amazon since it is a older movie dealin with cave explores. unknown to them there is a cave dweller grim, a hideous creature which captures girls in the beginning and carryin them off to his lair. i recommend it strongly. there is no nudity in it what so ever.",1279584000,,321,4.366666666666666
861883,2,630437528X,"While I'm on my kick of watching horrible b movies I thought about revisiting Grim, which I saw at a young age. I had remembered it being laughable then so assumed it could only be that much better years later. Once I popped it in all these memories started coming back to me as I spent the next hour and a half with my jaw dropped. Right off the bat I starting cracking up with the opening credits that looked like a very poorly executed powerpoint presentation . Somehow things only got worse and worse leading me to one of the worst films I've ever seen, AGAIN!

After the extremely long powerpoint opening we start off with a group of terrible actors messing with an ouija board. There is no explanation to why they are all together nor does it matter. They somehow resurrect the Grim, who looks like a giant rubber mess. Now we take a shift to a group of spelunkers who are investigating a poorly made cave beneath a small town. Again no explanation to why. As they search the cave they become prey to Grim who chases them around in a hilarious fashion. He can also teleport through walls to sneak up on you with some of the funniest special effects ever created. It's simply amazing! I can't even explain what it looks like, I can only say that it's worth watching the film just to see these effects for yourself.

To sum it up Grim is easily one of the worst I have seen, and that is saying a lot. It's just amazing that while working on set the actors didn't just walk off realizing how terrible this would be. However I don't want to rip it apart too much because I did get a lot of laughs out of it. Lets face it, if you are watching Grim you aren't expecting too much just by looking at the cover. If you happen to be in the market for some poorly made b horror laughs then Grim is your vehicle.",1247270400,3,1806,4.231884057971015
861884,3,630437528X,"Lately we have been getting so much enjoyment from our golden era of b. The 90's packed in so many b horrors that they've given us enough to watch and review for the next few years. The beauty behind these films is all the effort they put in to them with the result being a straight to video release. It's just amazing. You have a group of the most talentless humans fighting to make their big deput by doing a film destined for the five dollar bin, much like tonights entry. Grim is such as disaster it's almost hard to believe it actually exists. The tagline for this one is ""This ain't no fairytale"" but we decided to change it to ""This ain't no movie.""

We start off with a few friends playing around on a ouija board. There is no explanation to what they are actually doing but somehow they unlease a hilarious looking creature who was set in stone for centuries. The one girl appears to be possesed by the creature Grim once her eyes light up red in the first of many obsurd special effects attempts. Once possesd we sees some pink line appear on the floor then Grim pops out dragging the girl underneath the floor deep into his cavern. Whenever Grim comes to take someone there is always a pink line he comes through and they make him look wavy like it's a screen saver. These are effects that are so bad they must been seen to be believed. Possibly the worst SE ever!

So after this opening scene we cut straight to a group of the most unrealistic spelunkers as they get ready for a little caving expidition. Despite the fact that this film was made in 1995 these people look like they were living in 83. The leader of the caving mission is some guy named Rob who kind of looks like the weazel guy Eric from Billy Madison. He has an ultra tough attitude and throws ongoing comments at one of the other spelunkers in some fantastic banter. The rest of the crew look like simple folks from the suburbs and have no redeeming value. In fact you are just dying to see them get devoured by Grim. As they make their way down into the styrofoam cave that the directors 11 year old son made as a science fair project, it becomes quite apparent it's just going to get worse and worse. They are poking around while Grim stalks in the shadows. It's really interesting how graceful Grim is for a 450 lb creature that growls, kills, and eats for a living. For some reason they never see him coming as he swipes one of the woman and bites her entire face off. Once her husband realizes she disappeared he goes looking for her only to run into Grim. Now everyone knows there is a creature down there and their one exit has been sealed up. As they continue to run around aimlessly they decided they must find a way out but also must destroy the creature so he won't plague this small hick town with his b killing spree. While searching they come across a body of water and camp out there to devise a plan until Grim jumps out of the water in similar form to and elf out of a stocking. He takes a couple more lives leaving only 3 morons who manage to temporarily take him down by lighting dynamite which collapses part of the cave on him. For some reason the debris only harms Grim as the 3 go running off to find their exit. Once they find their exit Grim comes bashing throught the wall only to be haulted by a flashlight. Apparently the big guy hates lights which makes them realize if they can position him under a hole in the cave when the sun comes up it will shine on him turning him to stone. They accomplish the task and get out of there to leave Grim in a rock like state. We can only hope for a sequal sometime in the near future.

To sum this one up is simple, it's terrible. However it's the type of  terrible that pleases us who love the B genre. The special effects, horrible acting, and confusing plot will leave you speachless. If anyone could get an honorable mention in this one it'd have to be Grim. Even though he couldn't speak he was by far the best actor. Plus he chomped peoples heads off which is always fun.",1220659200,4,4024,4.269986893840104
861885,4,630437528X,"i did the same thing, and this movie is great for late night scares! sure, the acting is bad, the monster doesn't look wery realistic, the grapfic effects looks cheap and so does the opening credits, and there isn't a single part that makes you jump, but you're missing the point. it's not about all that stuff. it's about being scary. this movie is awesome! i actually got scared myself! for all you people out there who doesn't give a care for realistic things in a horror movie, like me, i highly reccomend it!",1190419200,3,513,4.468085106382978
861886,5,630437528X,"Okay honestly, this movie is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, if not the worst.  There is one reason to buy/watch this movie:  if you like getting really sloshed and laughing your head off at the campilicous acting, ridiculous effects, and stinking script.  Grim...is awesomely bad.",1163462400,,298,4.92
861887,1,630437528X,"Okay, the movie was horrible.  The monster was beyond bad.  It could walk through walls, floors, rock, etc. without leaving a hole and pull people through with him/her..It.  whatever.  The acting was really bad and the people searching through the cave made ever horror movie character mistake they could come up with and therefore got picked off one at a time.  Though the plot was stupid and the acting lame, this movie actually left something of an impact...The girl in the cave.  As the movie came to a close, I was thinking: ""What about the girl?""  Well, they did wrap that up finally.  Her fate was truly grim.  Gave me chills.  The only thing worse than her fate was maybe actually paying money to watch this....Or worse.  Being chained to a wall in a cave and having to watch it over and over again.  That would drive anyone over the edge.",1156032000,,847,4.5364238410596025
861888,1,630437528X,"There is no getting around it Grim was the only name for this Cinematic masterpeice. Grim stinks. The acting is non-existant and the plot is thinner still.  There is no excitement.  The so called monster is cheezy looking like something you expect to see in a 25 cent fun house at a church school picnic.  The monster just clomps around back lit in a funky blue haze.  Every now and then you see a hint of his face which looks sort of like a hairy Popeye the Sailor Man mask.

Sad thing is really Bad scienfic fiction tends to be really funny.  The acting is so bad and the special effects are so cheezy they are not even funny.  There is not enough of a plot here to launch an attack that would be funny.  Everything is so poorly connected that the movie is just dull.  And I hope you love repetitive theme music of the worse kind because, you will hear the same crappy very unscary ""Monster Music"" again and again and again and again and again and .... well you get it.

If this movie was in the 99 cent bin in some store it would still be way over priced to the tune of like 98 cents.  This movie should be the the movie in a buy one get this free promotion.  I can not imagine how you could make a movie worse than this one, but I am sure there are people out there trying their best.  I saw this movie on SciFi channel and for once I was happy Sci Fi hacked it to bits while showing it.

Save your money do not buy this movie.  You'd be better off spending the money buying chewing gum for the pigeons than buying this dreck!",1152921600,,1530,4.087248322147651
861889,1,630437528X,"Do not buy this movie. The special effects are cheesy to the 10th power. The actors/actresses all suck at acting. The story line makes very little sense. Grim is not scary and does not do much except grab some people and walk around all the time while 'roaring'.

The transfer to dvd is not from the original film negatives but maybe from an old VHS copy which makes the quality of this picture look very grainy and fuzzy.

Please don't make the mistake the mistake I did, spend your money on something else. You will thank me later - that is unless you are a huge fan of this movie and have to have it on dvd no matter what quality it is in.",1141948800,10,642,4.169354838709677
861890,1,630437528X,"My advice: skip this one.  I was hoping for a cheesy monster flick, but this was pretty unbearable.  The monster effects weren't too bad and the locations were better than some studio movies (looks like it was shot in some real caves).  I think it had potential.  What screwed that up was the dragging plot.  It went on and on without going anywhere.  No amount of editing could fix it either.  Never being funny or scary the movie was a real let down.  Skip it.",1135641600,4,462,4.352941176470588
861942,1,630437528X,"One word can sum up this movie:  boring.  Forget the lack of really good effects; acting; writing; direction.  Forget the fact that the monster looks like an actor in heavy ineffectual makeup.  I can accept cheesy horror movies, but none that are so boring as GRIM.  The pacing is superlethargic, and the musical background atrocious.  There were no scares, and only a few unintended laughs.  Like where did Steve get the gong and hammer to play?  And if Grim could walk through walls, how come he got clobbered by a collapse?  Totally inane, and unfortunately, boring!",1081296000,3,569,4.84375

Enter Rob (Emmanuel Xuereb), a geologist, called in to investigate a possible subsidence caused by a local cave system under an apartment complex. Rob hears of deaths and disappearances, but is determined to do his job. Spelunking ensues, as Rob leads a team -including the dolts from the beginning- into the tunnels below. Meanwhile, the monster, looking like a saber-toothed, yeti granddad in the world's ratty-est bathrobe, collects hapless victims for his dungeon. Back w/ Rob and company, cartoon bats attack, sort of.
