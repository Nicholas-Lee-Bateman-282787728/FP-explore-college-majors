4904165,5,B005Y3SR8A,Watched the whole thing in one seating. Truly entertaining and much faster paced than season 3. Can't wait for Amazon to release season 5.,1327190400,2,138,4.791666666666667
4904166,5,B005Y3SR8A,Purchased Amazing Race 3 & 4 for my husband for Christmas.  He loves this show.  I sure hope that the other seasons will soon be available.,1326931200,2,139,4.3076923076923075
4904167,4,B005Y3SR8A,"Love the series and had expected more seasons to come out in DVD than just season 1 and 7. Thank you Amazon for finally releasing some seasons. Don't expect bonus features or a simple option like subtitle or commentaries. It's just aired programs that are in DVD format. But enough for the series lover like me.

Please release the other seasons!",1326499200,8,346,4.672131147540983
4904168,5,B005Y3SR8A,"Love this show, can't wait for next season or even more seasons to be released on DVD.  I will definitely purchase every season I do not own at the present time.",1326499200,2,161,4.193548387096774
4904169,5,B005Y3SR8A,"Since I was there (I'm really Dave of team Steve & Dave) I can't understand why CBS has yet to release this on their own.  But kudos to Amazon for doing it for them!  The season was (in my humble opinion) the best ever.  Even though I was a contestant, it was almost as much fun watching as it was actually running the race.  I'm sure you will enjoy it too.

Edited to add: I did buy the DVD set from Amazon.  They arrived as promised, the quality is good (not great, it was filmed pre-HD), and the show truly is ""amazing"".  My only complaint?  No matter how many times I watch we still end up in 8th!  (Of course, I doubt there's much that even Amazon can do about that...)",1324425600,13,674,4.083969465648855
4904170,5,B005Y3SR8A,"Season 4 is now available on DVD through Amazon. Like Season 3 this season is contained on three discs. Disc 1 contains episodes 1-4, Disc 2 contains episodes 5-9, and Disc 3 contains episodes 10-13. Lets hope Seasons 5 & 6 will be released together and soon.",1322870400,3,259,4.531914893617022
4904171,5,B005Y3SR8A,I don't understand what is taking so long I want to buy all seasons love this reality also love survivor I don't live in USA so I cant watch them  here or in cbs please release them the wait has been for ever.,1322438400,2,209,3.86046511627907
4904172,5,B005Y3SR8A,"The earlier seasons of The Amazing Race have proven to be some of the absolute best of the series.  And season 4 is no exception.  The season brought TAR its 2nd Emmy at a time when the show's future was in doubt.  And the Emmy was well deserved with season 4's mix of drama and fierce competition.  From team rivalries to the first harrowing ride onboard the Indian train system, The Amazing Race 4 is another welcome addition to the home of any fan of great television.",1320624000,2,471,4.379310344827586
4904173,5,B005Y3SR8A,"Season 4 has Millie, and the nutbunches--but what I really want is SEASON 5--Colin and the Ox.

Hurry, Amazon, hurry!!!",1320019200,,119,4.95
4904174,5,B005Y3SR8A,I love the race and being able to see the early races that I missed is great.  All disks played great.,1384300800,,102,3.857142857142857
4904175,5,B005Y3SR8A,"Another amazing season, one of my son's favorites.  He enjoys pretending he is doing the challenges.  He has finally decided, we don't want to be on the show, just watch the show, for that I am grateful...I have no desire to be on the show -- that's way too hard for me.",1357948800,,270,4.173076923076923
4904176,5,B005Y3SR8A,"I love the Amazing Race. It is my favorite TV program. I was thrilled when I found that more than just Season 1 was now available,",1356220800,,130,4.038461538461538
4904177,5,B005Y3SR8A,My favorite show and a very qucik turn around.  Looking forward to more the Amazing Rave DVD.  Thanks for the DVD,1354752000,,113,4.333333333333333
4904178,5,B005Y3SR8A,"I haven't seen this or any other dvd of TAR in a really loooooong time! it was well worth the wait, and I cn't wait for the rest of the seasons to be release!!!!!",1344124800,,162,3.7941176470588234
4904179,5,B005Y3SR8A,"I've seen every episode of this series and think this is one of the rare reality shows with true value.

The thing I love most about the show are the locations.  It is the next best thing to traveling the world myself.  Not only do I get to see multiple and varied locales, including many that I will likely never get to travel to myself, but the show producers also do a great job of finding the most unique adventures to complete in each area.  I've learned more about world geography and different cultures than I ever learned in any classroom.

It's also interesting to watch the interpersonal dynamics between teammates and between teams.  I'd be lying if I didn't admit to finding the conflicts entertaining . . . and the stress of travel and competition does bring it out.  But I always root for the teams that are nicest to each other.

And it's rewarding to see how the intensity of the race truly brings teammates closer together by forcing them to work together and rely on one another.",1340755200,,997,4.5
4904180,5,B005Y3SR8A,"I'm an avid Amazing Race fan and having seen nearly every seen aired so far, I would have to say that Season Four is one of my favorites.  The casting was superb and the drama that ensued throughout the race was addicting.  There was one scene where a team threatened to slash another team's tires and there were two car crashes in back-to-back episodes.  Some of the phrases uttered were laughably memorable and the places ventured were absolutely gorgeous and full of history.  The breadth of the season is quite expansive and I absolutely adored every minute of it.  I will have to say that Chip and Reichen are my favorite team to have ever run the race (paired with Colin & Christie, Jonathan & Victoria, Jet & Cord, and Bopper & Mark).  This season is full of laughs, surprises, and just quality entertainment.  You will not regret purchasing this set!",1340150400,,858,4.642384105960265
4904181,1,B005Y3SR8A,"These recent DVDs produced on demand for the Amazing Race have never been particularly high quality. However, our attempts to purchase Season 4 currently have been met with near total failure.

The first DVD set we got came with 1 DVD instead of 3. That one DVD was also almost unwatchable -- jumping and sticking from just a few seconds into the show.

The second DVD set came with the right number of discs, but also jumped and stuck from just a few seconds into the show.

The third DVD set we got, which is what we're on right now, is the first one to work at all. Still, we lost 2-3 minutes over the course of the first episode due to it sticking for extended durations at about a half-dozen points. We may still need to return it.

Purchase with EXTREME care and only if it's something you want to just watch once. If we were expecting to get something we could continue to watch in the future, we'd be livid. Even then, order early as you'll probably need to return a couple of sets before you get one that (kinda) works.",1338768000,2,1028,4.310880829015544
4904182,3,B005Y3SR8A,"We love this show, but this is the second season we've purchased brand new from Amazon that has had major scratches on the disks that prevented them from playing all the way through. Amazon is great with their return and replacement policies, but kind of a bummer we have to wait another few days to watch it!",1332892800,2,309,4.43859649122807
4904183,5,B005Y3SR8A,"Love the series, my wife and I have have been waiting for these seasons to be released. Long overdue but worth the wait.",1329436800,,120,4.260869565217392

8489039,5,B005Y3SR8A,Another surprising race where teams get a break or faulter and each episode is enjoyable to watch,1480291200,,97,4.764705882352941
8489040,5,B005Y3SR8A,"Thank you Amazon for releasing Season 4. This was the season that I first watched with my mom. Every week we'd watch it together or if we didn't then we would at least discuss what we thought of each leg of the race. We both loved the Clowns, Jon/Kelly and Reichen/Chip. I will be purchasing this season in the near future.",1469059200,,323,4.311475409836065

8489045,4,B005Y3SR8A,"This season was great! Love the different personalities, especially the clowns! Also it arrived at my house faster than I expected, which was a big plus. Only problem was the second to last episode wouldn't play more than a few minutes...but that was probably my fault. Great season though!",1391299200,,290,4.938775510204081
8489046,5,B005Y3SR8A,I am an amazing fan of this series. I am always worried that they will say they have doen enough shows but each year here it comes again and I am a happy camper.,1387843200,,161,3.764705882352941
8489047,3,B005Y3SR8A,Would like to have bonus material not shown on air.  Much preferred Season 1 for this reason as it included unaired material.,1386028800,,125,4.681818181818182
