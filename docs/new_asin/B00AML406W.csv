8553852,5,B00AML406W,"This was just a chance buy because i was intrigued with the synopsis of the movie and gave it a try. And I was rewarded with a movie with so many twists and turns, with a very surprising end. The English subtitle is really good and that is a plus. Will not spoil giving details of the movie or the storyline. But will leave a warning: it may not suit the taste of ones used to the Hollywood kind of movies.",1426896000,,406,4.0246913580246915
