8370362,2,B002HG2XRS,"Newlyweds Mark (Dean McDermott) and Page (Nicole Eggert) get a good deal on a cursed apartment in Chicago. A mafia criminal was killed there recently. What starts out as a horror film turns into a made for TV drama/mystery/thriller complete with a lame soundtrack. As any good mystery, it has clues and twists, but in this case they are not put together well.

Nicole Eggert did what she could with a bad script and boring dialouge.

Currently available again as a filler in a 30 Horror Film Collection.
