8230316,5,B000XYWFII,"I've been doing Taebo on and off since 1997, so I think I can speak from a place of knowing! This DVD set is SUPERB. The Fat Blasting Cardio really gets your heart rate up. The Total Fat Blaster works your muscles - and I highly recommend the Billy Bands. Beginners can try the workouts without the bands at first.

The videos are great for beginners because Billy does a few sets of the technique slowly to make sure you have it down, then a set or two quickly. You won't be going non-stop for a full 45 minutes, so beginners can pace themselves.

The moves are simple enough for anyone to do. You do punches and kicks and knee raises, with a few jumping jacks. Jabs, hooks, uppercuts, speedbag, front kicks/back kicks, side kicks, all in different variations.

If you only bought 2 Taebo DVDs, these 2 would be a great choice!",1220832000,2,828,4.398692810457517
