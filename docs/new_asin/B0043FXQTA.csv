4255677,4,B0043FXQTA,"The more I watch classic films, the more I discover what a great year 1950 was in the movie business. Here's another good film, and one many people are probably unfamiliar with. This one revolves around the newspaper business.

Dan Duryea, as usual, is interesting as ""Mike Reese,"" a bad guy-turned-good guy journalist. He is joined in the cast by Herbert Marshall, Gale Storm (one of the great names in show business and who will forever be ""My Little Margie"" to those of us who were around in the '50s), Howard Da Silva and Michael O'Shea.

Of the above-mentioned, Da Silva was the most fascinating, as the brutal mob boss ""Carl Durham."" He only had a minor role, but some of his lines were outstanding and his role was memorable. Da Silva was a great actor for film noirs. This isn't really a noir, but it's close. Marshall was just fine as the newspaper owner.

The film was not kind to the newspaper business, so some media-minded national film critics (who probably had columns in daily papers) didn't like this film for that reason. Nonetheless, it's a powerful film and well-acted. Too bad it's never been offered on DVD.",1243814400,10,1129,4.663316582914573
4255678,4,B0043FXQTA,"""The Underworld Story"" concerns a yellow journalist who publishes an expos that results in a gangland killing.

Mike Reese (Duryea) is blacklisted for this and his supposed connection to a mob boss. When he can't find another job Reese buys a half-interest in a small New England paper by getting the cash from gambling kingpin Carl Durham (da Silva)-- the very man he was wrongly accused of associating with. Reese then tries to profit from the murder of a newpaper magnate's daughter.

As of 2/09, ""Underworld Story"" was not available on DVD.

Also recommended:
Richard Widmark plays one of his ""patented"" gangster types in the shadowy true crime drama, THE STREET WITH NO NAME (1950).

8414872,4,B0043FXQTA,"This review starts with a brief initial overview about the beginning of the movie...

This is a 1950 example of film noir.  The movie story is about a homicide in a small town.  The viewer is quickly told what happened through the movie.  Meanwhile, a hard boiled newspaperman has recently become an partner in the town newspaper.  An African American female is a framed suspect.  The newspaperman tells her he will help her.  Meanwhile he arranges to turn her in to the authorities for a reward.  Then he engages in a crusade to exculpate her.  The case is then the subject of public trial within competing newspapers.

This movie evokes a response from me in two different ways. Speaking as a retired police detective, this case makes me sick.  There is no way I would stand by quietly while all this nonsense goes on.  The so called investigation is amateurish, bordering on childlike.  Enough said.  But as a movie viewer and reviewer, this movie is interesting from an artistic standpoint.

As far as I am concerned this movie is most interesting as a time piece example of film noir.  The movie is hard bitten and cynical, typical of film noir.  Film noir is its own art form. The movies are shot in black and white, with an emphasis on lighting, shades, and the symbolism of scenes. There are obvious overtones of racism within the movie.

Ironically, racial overtones are also part of the actual movie making.  The African American is actually played by a white lady, Mary Anderson.  Mary Anderson notably played a white lady in ""Gone With The Wind"".  No kidding...",1490918400,,1573,4.709558823529412

8414876,4,B0043FXQTA,"I have learned something about film noir by attending the annual noir city DC film festival held at the American Film Institute Theater in Silver Spring and cosponsored by the Film Noir Foundation.  I had the opportunity to see this  rare 1950 film,""The Underworld Story"" on large screen in a newly restored 35 mm print sponsored by the Film Noir Foundation. The presentation was in commemoration of the film's 65th anniversary. Foster Hirsch, a scholar of film noir and a member of the Foundation board gave a brief insightful introduction to the film.  The title of the film ""The Underworld Story"" is something of a misnomer in that organized crime plays a secondary role.

Cy Endfield directed the film shortly before he was blacklisted as a result of the work of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Howard Da Silva, who played the gangster in the film was blacklisted as well. Much of the film seems to predict the anti-communist ""witch-hunting"" that would soon lead to the blacklisting.  The movie discusses the power of masses and of the press, for good and for ill.  The film is based on a story by Craig Rice, a pseudonym for an early woman writer of mysteries, Georgiana Ann Randolph Craig (1908 -- 1957).

The film stars Dan Duryea as an ambitious and seemingly unprincipled reporter, Mike Reese.  He gets fired from his big city job and connives his way to purchase a share of a struggling small New England newspaper, owned by Catherine Harris (Gale Storm).  When the daughter-in-law of a powerful newspaper is murdered, Reese, ever on the alert for the main chance, tries to rescue the small paper's failing fortunes by sensationalistic reporting. An African-American woman, the maid of the murder victim, is falsely accused of the murder. Reese tries to play both sides of the question of her guilt or innocence until he evidences a sense of integrity as the movie reaches its conclusion.

Dureya is effective is the brash reporter, but  Da Silva's portrayal  of the sinister but smooth gangster, Carl Durham, is the highlight of the film. As Foster Hirsch pointed out in introducing the film at Noir City DC, ""The Underworld Story"" combines elements of noir in its exploration of the internal, dark aspects of its characters with social and political commentary and with mystery.  Genre lines are often fluid; and this film may most accurately be described as noir influenced.  The noir elements of this rare film still made it  a valuable addition to a festival of film noir.  I was grateful for the opportunity to see a new restoration of the film in the theater and to learn about and enjoy the film in a festival devoted to film noir.

8414878,4,B0043FXQTA,"The reason I got this film was solely to watch the work of its director, Cy Endfield, and I was not disappointed. Endfield's early work is very difficult to find. Having recently seen two of his best, TRY AND GET ME and HELL DRIVERS, at a film festival, I've become a fan. (I'm hoping those two movies are made available to the public soon as they are extraordinarily good.) While this film does not quite measure up to those titles, THE UNDERWORLD STORY is beautifully crafted and has one more indelible performance by the great noir character actor, Dan Duryea.",1369872000,2,563,4.64
