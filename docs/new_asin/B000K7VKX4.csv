2684521,5,B000K7VKX4,"This kind of film is really not my usual poison, but I still liked this Australian movie VERY MUCH! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Made in 2006, this film was directed by Rolf de Heer, a Dutch-Australian director who mostly makes independent small budget movies. ""Ten canoes"", even if made on a bduget is however also his most expensive film - and also the most known and considered as most succesful.

When released, this film was the first ever to bu turned mostly in one of Aboriginal languages, the Yolngu Matha. The characters speak Yolngu Matha, so the film has English subtitles - however, the narrator, who is extremely important and intervenes constantly, speaks in English.

""Ten canoes"" tells a story from Aboriginal lore and therefore takes us back in time, albeit it is not clear how long exactly we travel back. It takes certainly place before the contact with first European explorers in 1606, so it can be the XVI century - but it can be also much earlier... The story takes place in north-eastern Australia, a land of forests and marshes, much less hostile than the arid outback more frequently associated nowadays with Aborigines.

Most of the film tells a story about a small tribe made of ten adult men (some married, some still celibate), as well as their wives and children. The main character is the leader of the group, Ridjimiraril, a strong and respected man who has three wives. His younger brother, who is still single, greatly desires the youngest of the three wives. And then one day a mysterious stranger comes wandering around camp, greatly alarming the tribe's sorcerer... I will say no more about the story.

The story itself is surprisingly interesting and the narration, which as far as I understand follows the original style of Aboriginal story telling, is very charming, clever and with quite a lot of humour, even if the tale itself is finally not funny at all...

But the greatest treasure of this film is to allow us a glimse in our own past, in distant times of palelolithic, when all people on Earth everywhere lived a similar hunter-gatherer tribal life style. Australia was first colonised by paleolithic hunter-gathereres maybe as early as 70 000 years ago, but somewhere around 42 000 years ago, when ocean level rised, it was cut off from any significant external contact until 1606!

Even allowing for ulterior evolution and development of this purely indigenous culture, this isolation allowed the unique preservation of the culture and customs of our distant ancestors living at the very beginning of Upper Paleolithic - and having a look at the living picture of our ancestors way of life at a time when they shared this planet not only with mammoths and saber-tooths but even with Neanderthal people is a greatly fascinating thing! I was particularly impressed by the mystical and religious beliefs, the sorcellery, and especially the laws of war and tribal justice, quite well adapted for a civilisation based on a great number of small tribes. Aboriginal tribes were definitely NOT pacifists and small scale warfare, especially to steal women, was frequent - full scale tribal confrontations however happened only in direst extremities as there were mechanisms meant to limit such cataclysms (they did not always work).

Bottom line, this is a very, very original and very fascinating film, which can be watched almost as a Sci-Fi movie about an alien civilization - but nevertheless tells a true story, transmitted by tribal lore from generation to generation. Enjoy!",1387756800,,3553,4.96969696969697
2684522,3,B000K7VKX4,I bought this movie because I thought that it would be a good movie to show what life is like for the Aborigines. While it does a great job of showing what life it like for them.

2684525,5,B000K7VKX4,"""Making of"" in special features documents the stunning journey of communication mishaps, unintended consequences, conflict and creative outcome for writer, director Rolf de Heer, bestowed with honorific ""father"" by an aboriginal to recognize the filmmaker's anthropological expertise on the esoteric minutiae of canoe building within this village. Ten Canoes stumbles into grace like the entire crew in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Galaxy-Quest-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B001S86J0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)</a>&nbsp;by inadvertence.

Humor is the byword of the whole production, alternating with impulsive withdrawal, and unspoken shame. To avoid conflict, one of the 10 canoeists simply walks away from the set and foots it 20 miles back to town without articulating why he is leaving. Rolf has to ferret out the reasons for defections, and emotional tension on the set, devoting patience and time to the process.

Ten Canoes contrasts a contemporary black and white film of an unmarried younger brother and older brother with 3 wives, with a parable filmed in color (as in a dream) told by the older brother of a similar single younger brother and older brother with 3 wives from their deep oral past and the consequences of getting what you wish for. In the present the two brothers and 8 of their village kinship group embark on canoe building for hunting. In the parable 10 men of their village build 10 canoes, have a wife stolen while they are at the swamp soaking, smoking and bending bark for the canoes. In the parable when the elders attempt to retrieve the wife they insult a nearby village by killing one of their kinsmen, an event which must be amended by offering a life from their own village.

In the 1930s photographer anthropologist Donald Thomson took 20,000 photos of Australian aborigines before their cultural traditions were touched by balanda (white men). Thomson documented the techniques used in day to day life among the peoples of this particular village including canoe building. The Thomson photo and journal collection is housed in the Australian state museum. Writer director Rolf had just finished a movie and as he awaited the movie release, was in need of current cash. His friend David in the bush village had asked for years that Rolf invest in making a film in their village. Rolf thought he could produce an independent film, to be released quickly for income. He wrote the aboriginal parable and set about finding 10 men to fill the requisite canoeist roles.

Then the process of building the ""sets"" began. The canoes themselves were to be built by the elders of the village who recalled actually seeing the process in their childhood. When their construction techniques began to veer off the plans Thomson had documented in his journals, Rolf hesitated, then was forced to step in and show the evidence for the way to the canoes were shaped in that village in 1937. Rolf carried photocopies of the original Thomson photos and journal sketches to explain that the shape they were using was not original to this village. The villagers crowded around, struck by the photos and this visual connection to their cultural history.

Staging of the Ten Canoes scenes duplicate precisely the Thomson photos which are shown side by side in Special Features. The authenticity of this maneuver must have been deeply moving for the actors. Village women built the ""sets"": the single men's village, married people's village, the tree camps to avoid crocodiles. A renewed communal spirit invigorated to their shared learning adventure, recreating their ancestors' daily life.

Filming on the first day the men were hesitant about removing all clothes, with only string tied to their private organ. By the 3rd day they didn't bother to put on clothes. One man's wife came on set and screamed for him to come home. He left the set, reconnected with his family, then returned to the set acknowledging that when filming was complete he would return home probably to be stabbed in the leg with a knife for his fealty to the movie.

Sometimes tension would arise on the set and Rolf was unable to understand or contain it. Often it had to do with violating traditions, kinship or otherwise. A man and woman who played man and wife on film had to have the correct kinship relationships in real life to take on film roles. A sense of being humiliated was more than some villagers could bear, and they would simply walk away. With no acceptable means of expressing anger or distress, it was easier to walk into the bush than deal with confrontation face to face. The traditional process of makarrata or ""payback"" where one spears an opponent, is not acceptable in a balanda (white man) controlled environment, so quiet sad angry thoughts jump out of the head and infect the earth. And where the thoughts dwell the feet soon follow.

In a village of 800 people a movie being made was of great interest. People came out from town to gawk and laugh. The actors became disgruntled and wanted to work on acting without being observed. Until Rolf was able to discover the source of grumbling dissension it was impossible to continue filming. Rolf had a van drive the women back to town.

Rolf had to completely rewrite the script once he understood that making himself clear on the instructions ""start"" (action) and ""stop"" (cut) were too difficult to convey and that anything more complex was going to unnecessarily complicate filming. Rolf's intention to rehearse before filming, and film out of sequence created more delays and need to explain than could be justified. He was already behind schedule. He discovered that the innate humor of the villagers was easier to film spontaneously. Rolf tried to recreate a particularly lively scene of jokes about farting. After repeated ""takes"" the actors became embarrassed and humiliated that they were unable to capture the scene correctly the first time. The director abandoned the idea of rehearsing. The main character walked into the bush not to return. Rolf tried to film around the main character.

Rolf decided to film as quickly as possible, as he feared the tension on the set was going to erupt in total anarchy and desertion.

As they neared film completion the main actor reappeared. He agreed to finish the black white version of the present and his role as his own ancient elder in the color version would be completed by another actor.

In Ten Canoes the older brother tells his story (in black and white) while they build canoes and camp. The parable ends badly for the older brother of the parable (in color). He is killed by a neighboring village in Makarrata ""payback."" Since the telling of the parable occurs over several days in the present, the younger brother has an opportunity to absorb the moral wisdom of the parable shared by the older brother: coveting your older brother's youngest wife may end badly.

The parable ends with aboriginal humor. The younger brother inherits all 3 wives of the speared older brother. But the object of the younger brother's desire, the youngest wife, is denied him. The oldest first wife claims the younger brother as her prize, fighting off the second wife for his time, attention and favors. ""And the wives acted as wives do.""

The narrator of Ten Canoes closes with ""it is my story and it is a good story.""

As the actors walked out of the bush into the 21st century naked with hand hewn spears, Rolf observed they had straighter spines, a firmer sense of self pride in personally acquired knowledge of their culture and history which they could transit to their children. The process of making a movie, acting ""as if"" brought them in contact with their own ancestral heritage, and the younger men who participated in the canoe building learned a traditional craft which had been lost to memory. The making of Ten Canoes reminds me of the discovery Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat, forgotten for hundreds of years until Western anthropologists rediscovered, documented and rebuilt the great temples. In Ten Canoes, the men construct 10 traditional canoes using 1937 techniques from their own village.

Watch the ""making of"" feature and interview with the lead actor to understand just how difficult it was to complete this film, yet the immense satisfaction the actors felt in recreating their cultural past for their children and grandchildren, documenting an honored system of family order, laws and rules, craft techniques, ways of interacting with other villages.

Ten Canoes is filmed like a story book with brief film clips illustrating each narrative paragraph instead of still photos or sketches. Some reviewers experience the story as stilted because of this technique, however capturing the process of canoe building, and recreating the Thomson photos on video has generated a personal ""historical document"" which portrays canoe making, building villages, negotiating conflict from this village's recent past. Making the movie provided an opportunity for an entire village to recapture their personal pride and honor themselves as a viable living culture with a distinct unique and beautiful past.

Absolutely stunning movie which in effect is a film of a village as it recaptures its sense of self through play acting an aboriginal parable.

Bravo 5 stars.

2684559,5,B000K7VKX4,"Beautiful photography. Very nice way of telling a story taking place in a lost culture. Quiet and not very exciting in the modern world sense of action or dramatic films. I guess these make it an art film. It is not ethnographic in the sense that ethnographic would imply dissecting a culture in terms of the categories of technology, production, kinship, ceremonies, etc. that are the ways in which ethnographers commonly organized their note-taking.

It makes a good effort at telling a story from the perspective of these particular aboriginals in a traditional frame of mind. Far, far from the old Mondo Cane anthro-exploitation films!! Other reviewers have given good overall views on the film.

I especially appreciated the lengthy ""making of"" extra. It went into aspects of how difficult it can be to try to make a film with non-Western peoples and still be respectful of their cultural integrity and of them and individuals. I confess that I could not follow all the details, but the general nature of the challenges came through very well.

All in all, if you are the sort of film watcher who is interested in people who are different from us in many respects and how they make a go of it, then you may well appreciate this. Watching it with a friend, she said that she was struck that they are not so different from us -- laughing at farts, penis envy (I did not see it that way), joking around, men attracted to women, women attracted to men, mostly cooperating, sometimes fighting, misunderstandings, and so on. I sort of took this for granted, but maybe that would be a value for some viewers. No matter how exotic these aboriginals might seem they are simply people coping with life. With very different lives than ours, granted, in a very different environment -- Australian swamps and forests.",1357344000,,1809,4.773162939297125

2684561,4,B000K7VKX4,"""Ten Canoes"" is an Australian Aboriginal film that is set in Arnhem Land, which examines spiritual and ancestral storytelling.

The narrative predates colonisation and focuses on tribal customs, hunter gathering, and interpersonal relationships with members of the community and outsiders.

It is a movie which moves at a gentle pace but that said its duration is only 92 minutes.

The cinematography captures the unique colours and untamed landscape of Arnhem Land and this combines with the story to convey the sacred relationship Aboriginal Australians have to the land.

2684562,3,B000K7VKX4,"I've been fascinated by Australian Aboriginal society for a very long time so when I spotted `Ten Canoes' and read the name of the legendary David Gulpilil on the back of the case I simply had to buy it. Now after viewing this film I must say that `Ten Canoes' is definitely something geared towards a very small, specific audience. While the camera does an amazing job at capturing the unique beauty of the Australian Outback, the storyline moves along at an excruciatingly slow pace. Sadly David Gulpilil never appears on camera, his role is limited to that of narrator. Speaking in his always difficult to understand broken English is a problem which is then compounded by the fact that the all Aboriginal cast speak in their native tongue with no subtitles provided. Daivid's role narrator is to move the storyline along not [rpvode a word for word translation of the conversations. In my opinion the decision to withhold such a vast amount of discourse from the viewer was a big mistake. How is one supposed to bond with the characters if we never know exactly what they're saying? By the time the story is told you've pretty much lost interest in whatever lesson is meant to be imparted.

If you're an anthropology student, or interested in aboriginal law, social practices and spirituality then you'll most likely find `Ten Canoes' insightful and informative. However if you're looking for an enjoyable film to wile away the evening I'd pass on this one.",1253145600,4,1461,4.820717131474104
2684563,4,B000K7VKX4,"""Ten Canoes"" is an extraordinary movie about the indigenous Aboriginal natives from the Arnhem region of Australia. Learning is often passed along through instructional story-telling and at the heart of this tale is the story of an unmarried younger brother's lust for for one of the wives of his elder brother.

As the men of the tribe hunt for goose eggs in a remote swamp, having to team-build canoes to carry them, they boast about their sexual prowess.  The elder brother uses this opportunity to explain what happened to some of their ancestors when a younger brother also coveted an older brother's wife. So, this is a story within a story, filled with mystery, tribal rites, revenge, sorcery, and a beautiful untrammeled background.

The bonus features are not to be missed.  The movie was 2 years in pre-production and that they managed to make it is almost a miracle. For example as filming was about to start, one of the key actors disappeared; scenes between husbands and wives had to use actual married people and there were cultural norms and relationships that had to be honored.  Even the skills required to make the canoes, once the province of every tribesman, had long been forgotten and only one cast member actually knew how to make the canoes (shown in detail as part of the movie).

This will be a classic, remembered Australian movie.  It is for those who value the unique and unusual, and not typical Hollywood fare.",1241740800,4,1441,4.809716599190283

Despite its exquisitely photographed and exotic locale, ""Ten Canoes"" is strictly for those who still need a bedtime story to help them fall asleep.  Set in the Australian outback, this tale of life among the Aborigines is as beautiful to look at as it is tedious to sit through.  As we watch a group of men building canoes, a wizened but droning narrator spins an ancient yarn about a stranger who wanders into a village, forever altering the lives of those who live there (interestingly, while the scenes in the past have been filmed in color, those set in the present are in black-and-white).

""Ten Canoes"" may have value as an anthropological study of sorts, but its desultory pacing and lack of compelling drama make it a very dull slog indeed for even the most adventurous of armchair-traveling moviegoers.",1214524800,10,818,4.821428571428571

The entire fim is humourous, saccharine, sentimental, and inspirational and uplifting.

One of the film's major themes concerns the circle of life - each human begins his existence as a small fish lurking in the waterhole, and, following his death, he will return to the exact body of water from which he was taken. Likewise, each character in the film follows a cycle of his own.

Well, this will probably someday be considered alongside those movies as great movies from Australia. Coincidently , David Gulpili, who starred in the aforementioned movies, narrates , often times tongue in cheek, and as he says ,that is another story. The storytelling is superb, a story within a story, an adventure for the ages and a moral tale that doesn't club you upside the head. The humor is great, it is funny stuff that transcends the cultural differences. The scenery is spectacular, especialy on your giant screen with surround sound. You  will feel as if you  are walking with the aborigines.

We would have never been able to see or experience a culture like this if it wasn't for this film. This is the story of a young man Dayindi who covets one of the wives of his older brother, Minygululu. To teach Dayindi the proper way his brother tells him a story from the mystical past of wrong love, kidnapping, sorcery, and revenge gone wrong. Director Rolf de Heer was inspired by Dr. Donald Thomson who first captured the aboriginal group with an extensive group of photographs, especially one photo of ten men in bark canoes. The movie is unlike anything I have ever seen before. It sends you to a land away from that of Hollywood blockbusters and transplants you into an enchanting hypnotic land of solidarity. I highly suggest it. The bonus features grant the viewer a deeper insight into the making of the film and how difficult of a process it was, especially with non-English speaking actors, yet Heer maintained an authentic quality throughout.",1194566400,6,1305,4.778761061946903
2684580,5,B000K7VKX4,"""Ten Canoes"" unusual story-within-a-story structure allows a glimpse of one Indigenous Australian culture while it offers a timeless fable with enough drama to satisfy both Western and Yolngu tastes. The film was conceived by writer/director Rolf de Heer as a project for and about the native people of Arnhem Land in Northern Australia, from whence his friend actor David Gulpilil, who narrates the film, hails. The film's style and narrative structure were inspired by the photographs of anthropologist Dr. Donald Thomson, who took over 4,000 pictures of the Yolngu people in the 1930s while their ancient traditions were still widely practiced, including an iconic photo of ten canoeists on a goose egg hunt.

As the film opens on the beautiful blue and green of Arnhem Land, a Storyteller (David Gulpilil) introduces us to a story of his people, of the young man Dayindi (Jamie Gulpilil) who covets the youngest wife of his older brother Minygululu (Peter Minygululu). While Dayindi experiences his first goose egg gathering expedition with the men in Arafura Swamp, his brother tells him a tale of their ancient ancestors to guide him: Among the ancients, there was a young man, Yeeralparil, who also fancied the youngest of his warrior brother Ridjimiraril's (Crusoe Kurddal) wives. One day, a Stranger (Michael Dawu) appeared in camp to trade objects of sorcery. He was sent on his way with food and good wishes, but a cloud of  misfortune and ill will remained behind.

""Ten Canoes"" offers drama, humor, and a striking visual exploration of a traditional culture and the lands that shaped it for millennia. The goose egg hunt sequences are in black-and-white, placing them in ""Thomson Time"", as they recall and dramatize the photographs that captured that annual ritual. It seems strange at first to see a sun-drenched swamp in black-and-white, but the heavily highlighted foliage lends the scenes an appropriate mythical quality. Working with mostly non-professional actors who speak limited English, in keeping with their tribal laws, presented some hurdles which were surmounted in part due to the efforts of actor Peter Djigirr, whom Rolf de Heer credits as co-director. There is nothing remarkable about the story told in ""Ten Canoes"" but the telling itself is hypnotic and transcendent. In English and Ganalbingu with optional English subtitles.

The DVD (Palm 2007): There are 5 bonus features. ""The Batandu and the Bark Canoes"" (51 min) is a documentary narrated by Rolf de Heer about making the film, from its inspiration, to casting, the obstacles of traditional kinship laws, working with the actors, etc. It's an interesting and well-produced sort of director's journal. ""Aerial Map of Arnhem Land"" (3 min) is an attractive aerial survey of the area that zooms in and out on its own. ""Thomson's Photographs"" (3 min) is a slideshow of some of Donald Thomson's photos compared to the film, which attempts to recreate them. ""An Interview with Director Rolf de Neer"" (4 min) talks about the evolution of the idea for the film. ""An Interview with Peter Djigirr"" (4 min) discusses the meaning of the film to Yolngu culture.",1191196800,20,3137,5.12109375
2684581,4,B000K7VKX4,"The best film I've seen about the aboriginal culture of Australia.

After watching this film for 10-15 minutes, the viewer either will be intrigued by the story, acting & cinematography or convinced that it's not to their liking.  If you enjoy cinematic art, you will be rewarded richly by De Heers' respectful portrayal of the indigenous people - their humor, hunting and gathering expeditions, and everyday life in the lands where they and their ancestors lived and died for centuries.

The aboriginal cast speaking in the native language of Ganalbingu adds a degree of authenticity that few film makers ever capture and that enriches the viewing experience.  Watching this production is akin to being an unseen visitor in a world that is so different from any that most of us will ever encounter or imagine.

To heighten appreciation of the tremendous effort and care that went into making this film, I highly recommend watching the Special Feature entitled BALANDA & THE MAKING OF TEN CANOES.",1190851200,9,996,5.012121212121212

2684583,5,B000K7VKX4,"This is a wonderful film based on an ancient Aboriginal tale that is interwoven with a story from a 1000 years ago.  Though it is in the old indigenous language of the northern Arafura Swamp it is surprisingly warm and funny as the universal humanity of the characters comes through.  I hope it comes to the US and gets the attention it deserves. I was fortunate to be able to see it on a plane flying back from my trip to Australia in August 2006.  So, even though I saw it on a tiny screen with earphones I was transported to a totally new time and place and completely absorbed in the film.  Though the language, the customs and the setting were strange, the human desires, actions, humor and responses were so recognizable.  It has a dreamlike quality that weaves a spell of enchantment... Thank you, Qantas, for giving me the opportunity to see this wonderful, special film.",1177372800,5,879,4.537974683544304
2684584,4,B000K7VKX4,"I just saw this excellent film at a local College's International Film Program and I'd like to thank them for making it available - Thanks, Eckerd College! I only wish it were more easily seen by everyone else. While this movie probably would not appeal to a lover of the typical Hwood action movie, I strongly recommend it all the same. Australian Aboriginal mythology and storytelling are an experience which everyone should be exposed to. I believe that you'll find that while, at first glance, one might be tempted to pass off this movie as slow paced or too simple, the truth is, the events that engage us in modern ""civilization"" are no more significant, and possibly even less meaningfull than those which composed the lives of more ""primitive"" societies. In fact, I think that it's the very complexity of our modern lives which tend to dilute the significance of so called ""simple"" things, such as hunting for food, telling of stories, singing of traditional songs. By all modern standards, this movie should be boring, but it's not. The characters throughout are well developed and engender a surprising amount of empathy from the viewer, despite the vast difference betwen our lifestyle and theirs. The story itself has a timeless relevance, and the idea that a young man would subject himself to the slow unfolding of his elder brother's story, at first unwillingly, but then with greater and greater interest, serves as a cautionary tale in itself. The death and funeral scene at the end of the movie will certainly make you question the significance and appropriateness of our own western practices. On the whole, I think I'd much rather be ""sent off"" like Ridjimiraril with my mates playing the Didj and clapsticks than wasting away in some old folks home. Watch the movie if you can find it, and tell me you don't feel the same way!",1177286400,6,1847,4.829652996845426

If you want un-subtle hollywood-type action, then this film is definitely not for you - you will not be spoon-fed.  It is humourous (not in an overt, shove-it-in-your-face way), and the characters well developed (also unheard of in most mainstream h-films).  The shifting time structures also emphasise the way that the oral tradition is used within the film.  For those with time to allow their imagination to go beyond the horizon, then I would definitely recommmend this film for you!",1170979200,17,693,5.043859649122807
