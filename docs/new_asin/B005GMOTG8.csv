8471862,4,B005GMOTG8,"This DVD attracted me because of the doodles on the cover that look sort of like the Wimpy Kid books art, and the witty name for the News Show, Breaking Action Daily News, or B.A.D. News. Since it's for kids, they can't have any actual bad news of the sort that fills adult newscasts, so they rely instead on the absurd and trivial. But the idea is very witty and creative. There's a lot of overacting, as there is a tendency when making this sort of show to think each character has to be oddly overdrawn. Except the main guy has a natural gift for easy comedy, sort of like Adam Sandler, and if this was a much more extreme show on a comedy network, ratings would be soaring. The other guy who doesn't overact is a kid, Ramone, and he carries half the show.
The worst parts are the animation segments, stop motion crayoned figures acting out Bible stories, with a monotone reading from a not-very good translation. Rather than heightening the shows, these drag it down. It would have been better to flash back to Ramone sitting in Sunday School watching it acted on a flannel board, something decidedly low-tech, than to try to pull off something one doesn't have the resources for.
In the story, the anchorman's boss wants him to prove Jesus was a fake to improve ratings, but the anchorman's investigation proves otherwise. Along the way there is a lot of apologetics for kids, which are actually adult apologetics (defenses of or arguments for faith), such as that of C.S. Lewis in ""Mere Christianity"" that Jesus could not claim to be God and be a good moral teacher. Therefore, he was either a liar, lunatic, or Lord. The title of the DVD ought to be ""Is Jesus Real?"" but of course they're rather forced to put it the other way, which is the not surprising conclusion the anchorman comes to.
It's probably rather trendy to mock this sort of things except in the Evangelical home schooling enclave if that is the intended audience, but I have another view. I think everyone at one time has tried to act out a little story, maybe film it, maybe even put it on You Tube or make an iMovie, and heaven knows some of those are unwatchable. We also know that's not the point. People still watch them.
I think it's great some people wrote a script and acted it out, and there are some very imaginative parts in this show, which can either be watched as four episodes or as one continuous story (I chose the latter). I can give you more examples.
If you go back to the Tom Baker era Dr. Who shows on the BBC, the props are woefully lacking, but the stories are so inventive and thoughtful that it doesn't matter. The same is true of the BBC miniseries of Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is ten times better than the big budget movie. In the early 'sixties there were Gerry Anderson science fiction shows with marionettes. People now say they are black and white and you can see the strings, but I say, look how amazingly creative they are, listen to the dialogue, and how human these puppets seem. More than that, they make a kid watching want to make his or her own shows themselves. Creativity is catching.
What would have saved the animation sections in ""Jesus is Real"" for me would have been if they were simple doodles as on the package. But I also note that there is a lot of really good related animation for kids. Of course Veggie Tales comes to mind, and there used to be an anime series called ""Superbook"" and another, ""The Flying House"" which ran on The Family Channel when it was owned by CBN. The Friar has both puppet and animation segments which are so good I think this must be a British or Italian show dubbed in English. This ran on EWTN.
Do you like how overdone the NFL games are now? Or would you rather just play football in a dirt field? I think movies and especially animation are way overdone these days, and I am offended by many of them as much as are the makers of this film. So I disconnect the cable, and watch old Supercar shows where you can see the marionette strings, and old black and white movies, some silent, and play records, and watch DVDs of The Huckleberry Hound Show, all from a half or a century ago, all decidedly low tech. But this play troupe has gone further, and taken the camera in hand, echoing the impulse of all creative souls. And if something here rings true, it isn't merely the marshaling of arguments, but the creativity of the cast reflecting the Creator.",1460073600,,4418,4.448828606658446
8471863,5,B005GMOTG8,"So cute and essential for kids, it's better so equip them now than to un-brainwash them later. It's funny, has good solid facts and arguments, just perfect for kids and let's face is some adults, especially is they don't know any of the evidence for the Bible being true. And for the price especially, just buy it already, watch it and give it to some kid. You're going to give some kid some crap anyway, might as well be this. I studied apologetics for YEARS (still do casually), this is the first thing I've seen for children on it, besides Kent Hovind's Dinosaur video.",1423958400,,572,4.509615384615385
