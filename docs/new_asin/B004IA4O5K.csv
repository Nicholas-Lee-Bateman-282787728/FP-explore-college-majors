8430514,4,B004IA4O5K,This is a wonderful film that could teach our children today about values. I remember it as a child and loved it then. Of course we cant imagiane today the local police sergent giving a child a rifle for being a responsible person. But things were different in those days. Keith Calvert did a wonderful job considering he had never acted before. I was very sorry when I heard he had passed away. All in all I think this would be a good film to watch with our kids just to show how different things were in the country in the 50s,1328313600,,528,4.186274509803922
