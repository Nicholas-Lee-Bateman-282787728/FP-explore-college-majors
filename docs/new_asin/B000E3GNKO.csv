8105133,5,B000E3GNKO,"If you have no idea who the characters are, go to homestarrunner .com QUICKLY! Done it? Well, good.

Now, one thing I should point out is that most of the content that can be found on this disc can be found online. But hey, there are some advantages this DVD has that the computer doesn't.

1. It's Homestar on your TV!
2. Commentary exclusive to DVD
3. The bonus content

The bonus content includes some totally random stuff, including Exaggerations, which are basically bloopers of Homestar toons that were removed from the site.

The Homestar flash cartoon show, in general, is full of extremely funny moments, and now that you have it on DVD, you might as well start watching it.",1300406400,4,683,4.619834710743802
8105134,3,B000E3GNKO,"Homestar Runner is funny, and my 11-yr old brother loves it.  But the character Homestar was waaaaaaay too annoying for my taste!  It has a few good episodes, but I think Strongbad Email is better.  I guess if your a Strongbad fan, this is for you.",1253404800,,248,4.3478260869565215
