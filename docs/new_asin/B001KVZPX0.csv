8316257,1,B001KVZPX0,"This Dvd is pure garbage. The two experts look like they came in off the homeless streets to voice their stupid opinions. Constantant repeating the same dumb opinions and film,most of which had nothing to do with Vril. Sorry jew,this is just another attempt at Hitler bashing and was thrown in the trash....Ken Snyder",1418083200,,317,4.888888888888889
8316258,4,B001KVZPX0,"I'm a history buff and I have been fascinated with rise and fall of Hitler's ""Thousand Year Reich.""  Interesting to see what a few flakes in the upper echelon had going on in their heads - is it any wonder they ended up destroying Germany, Europe, and countless lives all over the world in that time?",1376092800,,300,4.357142857142857
8316259,5,B001KVZPX0,"Basically, this hour long documentary often reaired on the various Discovery channels treats the Nazi excuse for scouting out the Caucuses and the Himalayas being they were just looking for their ancestors and apparently, their propaganda department created the most inane and tedious cult ""The Vril"" to excuse away their espionage activities.  Well, they can't all be missionaries and archeologists.  I was ready to throw in the towel after the first fifteen seemingly endless minutes but stuck around and was rewarded with five minutes on measuring foreheads in Tibet at the half hour mark and walked away with an understanding of what The Vril and The Vrilya are about which convinces me that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marebito/dp/B000E3LGMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marebito</a>&nbsp;is about the Vril.

Yesterday, I watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Plague-History-Channel/dp/B000CSTK7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Plague (History Channel)</a>and recognized 74 minutes into the 2 hour long with commercial retelling that the flagellants are the origins of The Vril which is NOT mentioned in this documentary about the Vril.  Then later in the evening, I took my first look at Ridley Scott's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prometheus/dp/B009AJD5E0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prometheus</a>&nbsp;and realized that the Weyland Corporation (later/earlier to be known as Weyland Yutani in the other Alien movies) is using the Vril excuse of looking for their ancestors.  Well, they got into a mess of trouble as a result.  Maybe that's why the Vril/Alien ship is shaped like a boomerang and the Idris Elba character mentions Stephen Stills whose bandmates recorded&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Don-t-Dig-Here/dp/B005KG3LB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Don't Dig Here</a>&nbsp;without him.

It's important to watch those ten minutes about the flagellants anti-semitism in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Plague-History-Channel/dp/B000CSTK7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Plague (History Channel)</a>&nbsp;to connect the Vril - because in 1348, the flagellants of Geneva Switzerland tortured a Jewish merchant into ""confessing"" that he was responsible for the Plague by poisoning well water and thus started participation in 15 ""other German cities"" and in France (named after The Franks) and England of murdering Jewish people.  Then in 1349, Poland opened its arms to the Jewish refugees and it would be 600 years later that ""those same Germans"" would come ""full circle"" i.e. invade Poland and attempt to kill all the Jews again.  This is in a 2 hour documentary about the Mongolian instigated ""Plague"" which halved the population of Europe in the 14th Century in only a few short years leading Marco Polo to set out to China to recover previously-borrowed intellectual property lost in the Plague only to find China now being held by ... MONGOLIANS which they held for three generations only but in that time manage to attempt and fail due to bad weather the ONLY ""Chinese"" invasion of Japan in other words, actual Chinese people and Chinese emperors were never interested in Japanese real estate.

Incredible how much harm the marauders can do - those rats began carrying the plague from the slaughters in China when the Mongolians breached the Great Wall which generations had spent ALL of the country's income in building to prevent such horrors as in Beijing where blood and human tissue and fat COATED buildings three stories high from the Mongolian invaders murders echoing the clogged streets of Nanjing nearly exactly 600 years later and with the Mongolian massacres in China, the rats and the plague spread with the Mongolians westward where they threw a plague-d corpse over the wall in Italy because the Mongolians failed to breach the Italian fortress.

Amazing - that the Mongolian devastation and three generation hold on China should be connected to the origins of The Vril Ya.",1374364800,,4136,6.175652173913043
8316260,5,B001KVZPX0,"If you ever have wondered what lay behind the rise of Nazism, this is the film to watch.  There is everything for the person who is seeking to understand the mythology, practices and stunning pageants, parades and costumes taken right out of the Middle Ages underpinning the Nazi rituals.  It is a wonder how the sophisticated and intelligent people of Germany fell under the spell of these madmen.  This film will give the viewer an entirely different rational for what was happening in Germany before the war.",1371427200,4,511,4.850574712643678

8316262,5,B001KVZPX0,"This DVD is full of informative facts of the Vril, its begining and ultimatly, the religion of Hitler. It's full of facts few have heard. Some reviwers might want to bash this DVD because it does not fit into tbeir realm of beliefs. Facts in this are on point; don't be closed minded. Learn the secret cult and religion of Hitler and the SS.",1232582400,4,341,4.34375
8316263,3,B001KVZPX0,"Will this video reveal the truth behind the origins of Nazism?  Of course not.  The rise of the Nazis was the result of a complex and unique set of social and political factors, of which occultism and the workings of secret societies was but a small part.  The existence and activities of the so-called Vril Society is based largely on conjecture, it's influence and significance largely a matter of (mis)interpretation.  While certainly interesting to watch, needless to say such a production always has an ulterior motive: to make money.  Conspiracy/alternative history, after all, has become a lucrative industry.",1231718400,5,616,5.244897959183674
