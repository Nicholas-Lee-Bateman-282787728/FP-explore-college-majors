4255912,5,B0043LT1ZM,"as anything Bear does, is pretty amazing. This one is actually useful.
Can't understand though how a man with a broken back/neck can do all this amazing stunts..",1293580800,3,161,4.785714285714286
4255913,5,B0043LT1ZM,"I never saw this on my cable provider's Discovery Channel, so I decided to check it out. GREAT from start to finish! Bear really shows us practical maneuvers in the urban jungle that ""just might save your life"". BUY IT.",1288051200,6,219,4.5
8415106,5,B0043LT1ZM,I watched this when is was available on prime and it was really informative. I also like that he acts it out so you can see exactly what will be easier said than done.,1517875200,,167,3.9411764705882355

8415109,3,B0043LT1ZM,"Good show, Mike Rowe always makes a great host, package arrived in fast efficient manner, surprised and disappointed that all discs turned out to be burn discs not pre recorded discs.",1417046400,,183,4.935483870967742
8415110,5,B0043LT1ZM,"This was great series that I miss that show.
But favorite part is Melissa Johnson jumping off a cliff into the water.
But I'm glad they got the series on dvd.",1393632000,4,158,4.129032258064516
8415111,1,B0043LT1ZM,"Two things... First, the show is a total rip-off of Spike channel's ""Surviving Disaster"" with Cade Courtley. As Mr. Courtley is/was a Navy Seal, he is probably much more qualified to instruct you on surviving these kinds of situations than some TV stunt-man, but whatever...

  Secondly, Bear's advice is nothing short of dangerous stuntman-esk activities that will leave you (at minimum) injured and unable to properly respond the situation, safety first Bear... However, my personal favorite (sarcasm) is the whole NOT using lethal force to neutralize an intruder... Come on, the anti-gun politics have gone far enough, but to flat out tell people to NOT use a firearm to engage a potentially lethal threat, that is taking it WAY too far!!! Apparently not only is Bear a survival ""expert"" but he is also an attorney, telling viewers not to shoot an intruder, because you will be arrested, thanks for that Bear, anyone with half a brain knows that shooting an intruder (or anyone else for that matter) will result in them spending SOME amount of time in the court room, I'm not pretending it won't, but at least you and your family will be alive...

  I unfortunately had a personal experience with a home invasion situation, however upon drawing my weapon the would-be intruder no longer wanted to force his way into my home (imagine that), the situation was diffused instantly. Luckily I did not even need to fire a shot, I called 911, and the guy was caught and arrested about an hour later. Now, had I taken Bear's advice I would have snuck around my home, barricaded myself in a room and created diversions to sneak out of my home, but not before I tested my luck by engaging in what amounted to be a fist fight against someone with a gun (real smart), then I would (of course) have to sneak back into my home, just to raise the stakes.... Who knows I may have even congratulated the intruder for his brave and selfless attempt to force his way into my home, just so long as I certainly DO NOT use a gun... Got it Bear, great advice!

  Do what you wish, I do not pretend to be an expert by any means, but as someone who works in safety & health for a major corporation and has studied disaster preparedness and many of these ""worst case scenarios"" at length, I am telling you much of his advice is dead wrong and worse yet, dangerous...",1385510400,2,2343,4.586124401913875
8415112,2,B0043LT1ZM,definitely not the Bear Grylls I know and love from Man vs. Wild.  We didn't even make it thru a half hour before turning it off.,1359504000,,129,3.9615384615384617
8415113,4,B0043LT1ZM,"good info about various situations, great fun to watch. some extreme situations might not happen as described, but at least you have some insight .",1339891200,,147,4.92
8415114,1,B0043LT1ZM,"The Amazon description mentions A/B/C support, even the price tag like sticker that comes affixed to the cellophane packaging says A/B/C support. But the actual packaging and the disc itself has a B only on it.  It does not playback on all three of my region A playback devices. There is a quick splash screen showing the program's logo after which the OSD's timer displays a --/-- and a blank screen. This remains no matter how long I leave it on, and playback does not start.  It DID arrive with the disc dislodged from the holder, but as far as my eyes can tell, it wasn't scratched during shipment.  Can't say I'm happy about this situation, I hope others have a better experience.",1337990400,,685,4.5528455284552845
8415115,5,B0043LT1ZM,"I remember watching an episode of Wors Case a couple of years ago that was explaining what to do if you were about to roll your vehicle...at the time I assumed that anyone in that actual situation wouldn't have the time necessary to react in such a situation...but chance had it that last winter I was run off of the road and into an incline causing me to roll my Jeep Suv, instantly I thought back to that episode (it is amazing how God programmed human minds to work btw) and I followed the instructions which were to grab the steering will with your left hand and then I pushed my torso and head down over the middle of the console...the wreck destroyed my Jeep...and despite having my seat belt on, had I not done what WCS recommended I would have surely hit my head against the windshield post that was crushed in about a foot.  Anyways.....WCS + Bear Grylls = Awesome and necessary information...most people will never have to use the extreme outdoor measures that Bear portrays in Man vs. Wild, however, WCS is must need practical information that everyone should learn.  Buy it!",1315958400,3,1086,4.564102564102564
