7978125,3,B00007L3RG,"I had mixed hopes when ordering this DVD.  I had read its reviews on other online sites such as Amazon.uk, etc, but as the main reason I wanted it was as a gathered compilation of images and period film on the subject its lack of being a comprehensive objective coverage of the 2nd Boer War was something I could live with.

What I found disappointing is that out of three DVD players (2 computer, 1 home entertainment system) only one player could reliably play this DVD.

The material jumps back and forth a bit, not surprising given the scope of the conflict.  While it did not confuse me, being an amateur scholar on this war, anyone not familiar with the stages and reverses of the conflict might be left going 'huh?'",1340150400,2,722,4.488549618320611
