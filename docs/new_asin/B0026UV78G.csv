8353612,4,B0026UV78G,"Theses two movies were among the best of Arnold's early work. I find these movies to be the type you can watch again. These movies are filled with one liners but the non stop explosive action more than makes up for it. It's a pretty good price for the 2 of them. As for the Blu Ray aspect, the films look a little better than their DVD brethren but is not among the best I've seen on Blu, nonetheless these two are still worth the purchase.",1252022400,,440,4.127906976744186
8353613,4,B0026UV78G,"These are two defining movies from the 80s. This was the age of explosive, non-stop action from the likes of Arnold, the hero of these two movies and Sylvester Stallone. Commando tells the story of a special forces type whose daughter is kidnapped while the other is about a commando team ambushed in the jungle by an alien 'Predator' of the title. Commando is an action spectacular, perhaps not up to the mark of Taken and Man on Fire, two recent movies with similar themes but it delivers the thrills sought by action fans with a huge body count. Predator is the better movie of the two, featuring a novel concept at the time and out-of-this-world special effects. It is a fascinating story endlessly copied but never bettered.

The two-movie bundle is good value. The MPEG-2 pictures, while certainly not up to the standards of the latest movie transfers, are about the best these movies are ever going to look. Sound too is adequate but does not match the latest offerings. Don't look for too many extras, though. The twin pack is a must buy for die hard Arnold and action fans.",1250208000,,1082,4.635416666666667
