2747888,5,B000MTEFPK,"After viewing a small portion of Louis Malle's fictional films (the well known films, ""Au Revoir Les Enfants,"" ""Murmur of the Heart,"" and ""Lacombe, Lucien."") I became interested in the director's complete body of work. A  subsequent search led me to the Harvard Film Series website which profiled not only Louis Malle's fictional works, but also his diverse and numerous documentaries (the most intriguing being his work in India and the television series he later worked on regarding the country). \

It Should be quite interesting to see what Criterion does with this new Eclipse line, as it will bring a number of previously unattainable films and directors into the library of film buffs around the United States. This series of diverse documentaries, as well as the early Bergman (an announced set which consists of the films; Torment, Crisis, Port of Call, Thirst, and To Joy) and Raymond Bernard (Wooden Cross and Les Miserables, announced on the Criterion blog) films will provide a great backbone for the Eclipse series. Looking forward to more greatness in the future.",1169856000,17,1078,5.084745762711864
8172135,5,B000MTEFPK,"Terrific compilation of early doumenataries of Louis Malle. While the coverage of the diversity of the US is interesting, I found the highlight of the films was the documentaries of India. It is really hard to find video of India pre-1960, and his film of the post-war subcontinent were among the best I have ever seen. While his documentaries about Paris in the post-war period were really good, I found the India coverage most interesting, as there is so little footage of of the subcontinent at this time.",1474588800,,508,4.784090909090909
8172136,5,B000MTEFPK,"Louis Malle Phantom India - nothing like it before or since utterly absorbing and fascinating. I remember spending more than half a day in a movie theatre when the documentary was first released, on two separate occasions to watch it from start to end and felt completely enveloped in the experience.",1441065600,,300,4.901960784313726
8172137,5,B000MTEFPK,"I ordered this because I was interested in Louis Malle's series about India. It was controversial decades ago because the Indian government didn't like that it showed extreme poverty.  Although many Indians have advanced economically since then, you could probably find the same scenes today.  The documentaries on the USA were very dated and yet, many of the things that were said are still being said today, sad to say. I found them all very interesting.",1439510400,,456,4.9868421052631575

8172140,5,B000MTEFPK,For 20 years I searched to find Phantom India on VHS and then on DVD. Along the way I came in contact with many other people who were also searching for this epic gem. An incredible film worth having in your library to enjoy and share with others.,1391040000,2,247,4.166666666666667
8172141,5,B000MTEFPK,Louise Malle is great. If you like his work this series is worth to have in collection. I want to see his work time to time. Very inspirational. 'Phantom India' is the crown in this series.,1384300800,,189,4.277777777777778

8172144,5,B000MTEFPK,"In time Louis Malle may be regarded as the greatest soul who ever made movies.  In the central documentary included in this anthology, PHANTOM INDIA, he reinvents cinema by separating technique from process.  Over the several hours of this astonishing experience, the viewer gets to know Malle the film director even as he offers us even greater intimacy with his subject: the unknown.

Ultimately, what Malle is doing here is showing us the meaning of cinema:  the power of the objective lens observing something that cannot be explained.  What does the viewer experience:  precisely the aesthetic distance that exemplifies the highest art.  We learn to stop analyzing and start living deeply.  We enter into dialogue with truths beyond words.

And we experience life on a higher -- and simpler-- level.

A gift to those prepared to accept it.",1283040000,6,844,5.050724637681159
