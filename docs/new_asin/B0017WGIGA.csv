8267644,1,B0017WGIGA,This is not what I was looking for.  When I searched the item I wanted (I entered the actors name and home front) this ace up so I thought I was getting what I wanted.  Wrong,1365638400,,174,3.8055555555555554
8267645,5,B0017WGIGA,"This movie is terrific because it doesn't candy-coat the struggles of returning wounded soldiers, or ""wrap them in a flag"".  It shows how tough it is for families and for these guys themselves to adjust to an entirely new life.  But its real success is that it's an inspiring film as well as a cautionary tale.  And, how many movies include a blind guy shooting guns?",1211328000,2,367,4.53030303030303
8267646,5,B0017WGIGA,"This is an extremely well-made film that shines a light on something that we often chose to ignore -- the aftermath of war. It doesn't shout, like Michael Moore, or preach. Rather it provides an incredibly intimate portrait of an American family adjusting to life after their son, an Army Ranger, returns from Iraq severely wounded. Yes, parts are difficult to watch and sad. But it's also incredibly inspiring.  The family is amazing, and I guarantee that you will never forget the hunting scenes. See it!",1211328000,4,506,4.883720930232558
