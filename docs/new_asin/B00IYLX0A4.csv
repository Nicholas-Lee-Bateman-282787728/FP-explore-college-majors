8646421,3,B00IYLX0A4,"I was looking around vimeo and saw this because i wanted to see another by the director. I saw that this was a short so i figured that i would take this one first before i see the one i wanted to see. Let go through the list:

The first strike was because i hate gimmicks. The title do not match the movie. Sure, there's a lot of sex scenes, but if he would've kept the main title, Tortured by the heart, or something like that, it would've kept a star.

Best Actor: Waliek Crandall. He played the best friend and he portrayed me and my friends very well.
Worst Actor: Buddy Love. He looked like a cracked out White Bob (from Martin) who you just wanted to slap that wig off of him.
(You'll notice neither one is the main character)

Best Actress: Kitt the Diva (the hooker.)
Worst Actress: the white hooker/stripper

What good about the movie: the girls, and the situations before the sex. It wasn't like, let get it on here and now like many softcore movies. It actually had a reason for it. And those situations alot of people can relate to.
What bad about the movie, the acting. One, besides Waliek Crandall, it seemed like they had to force the words out. And the main character was crying too damn much. If i wanted to hear all that crying, i'll watch a movie about a maternity ward.
On a scale of sexploitation films, I'll give it a four.
On a scale of softcore, I'l give it a four.
On a scale of indie films, i'll give it one.
This is a type of film you watch late night when you can't go to sleep and you just want to just chill",1457136000,3,1537,4.164983164983165
