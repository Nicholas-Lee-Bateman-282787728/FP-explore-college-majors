Unfortunately (and hugely annoying) the main menu screens the last few seconds of the film, so if you don't want to know what happens you'll have to get someone else to select 'play' for you. How stupid can you get?

The film gets a 4 (and a half), the dvd gets a minus 1.",1200009600,5,382,4.380281690140845

Collins plays Joan Collins who with her husband Jim Collins (James Booth) are mourning the death of their child who was apparently raped and murdered by a pedophile.

Booth is angry when he learns that the pedophile has been let go and then begins stalking him and plotting his revenge against him. This movie then is a revenge movie with a couple of interesting twists thrown in.

Jim conspires with his friend Seely and his own son Lee to abduct the pedophile. However, when they finally do abduct the accused they see that he is unwilling to give them a confession and tell them what happened.

Frustrated Jim locks him up. However, does Jim really have the right man and will get away with torturing this pedophile to death?

It may not be a unique film as these plots have been done before but ""Revenge AKA Terror Under The House"" is a movie with great performances. The material is played with seriousness and the ending is quite memorable. Recommended.",1173571200,5,1099,4.732984293193717
