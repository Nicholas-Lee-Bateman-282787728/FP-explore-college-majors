Can't say much about ""Swinging Stewardesses"" - that title doesn't exist at such movie reference sites like IMDB.com. Must be a biggie.

""Bottoms Up"" looks like an Aussie nerd's wet dream: three hot babes kidnap a loser-in-love engineer and tutor the nebbish in the Kama Sutra.

""Mad Mad Moviemakers"" back in 1974 took advantage of Peter Bogdonovich's ""Last Picture Show"" with its original title: ""The Last Porno Flick."" Flick's plot is a minor ripoff of Mel Brooks' ""The Producers."" Here, two young men convince their families to finance what their unsuspecting folks believe is a religious movie. When the cheezy sexcapade they create becomes a big hit, our moviemaker heroes have a lot of explaining to do.

""Baby Cat"" is made in France. The title puts one in mind of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon (emphasis on the ""Pew""). Here, a fashion model can't get away from a photog who once did a shoot with her.

These mid-20th Century European films feature stars like Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida, Virna Lisi and Brigitte Bardot.

Two of these films (Bottom's Up and The Swinging Stewardesses) looked like a slightly edited porno film (removing the penetration scenes.) Baby Cat contained minor T&A.  I have not seen Mad Mad Moviemakers yet, but considering it is rated PG, I doubt it has any nudity.",1195862400,2,382,4.588235294117647
