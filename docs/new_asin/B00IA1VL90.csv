8640269,1,B00IA1VL90,"This 75 minute film talks about 7 different haunted places in Canada. There is some lame re-enactment. It starts with two girls walking, and talking about what happened. They both stop, claim they saw a ghost (a see through guy standing there) and turn and run. Ooooooh scary. I fell asleep twice watching this snoozer.",1442188800,,319,4.818181818181818

8640271,2,B00IA1VL90,"The disc I received was loose in the case and heavily scratched, so I was unable to play the complete dvd.  That said, the program was certainly different from other paranormal programs I have.  If U get a good dvd, it is well done and worth the $.  Two stars only because of the bad disc, otherwise I would have given it 4.",1412467200,,324,4.111111111111111
