8713284,3,B00WGA9WE2,"If you happen to peak at the cover while looking at the title, you know it is about an encounter with a bear, that is not going to be pretty. Alex (Jeff Roop) and his girlfriend Jenn (Missy Peregrym) go camping late in the season on a trail he knew as a kid. He doesn't need a map so guess where this goes. It is just a matter of time before our couple who don't know how to play dead, encounter a bear.

Now the question of who survives and who doesn't is the only mystery. I was once told you don't have to be the fastest person when running away from a bear, you just can't be the slowest (pushing someone down and tripping are fouls to consider). Rape whistles are not really effective, but if that is all you got...I'm sure some people who are falling flap their arms too.

Of course our couple can't just run into a bear. It has to be introduced slowly to build the tension. The encounter was more like a shot of a circus bear yawning with a dubbed roar then show some blood. It was low budget graphic. Not exciting.

It is a fair film. I wish they had created a better couple instead of a boring woman and a sad sack.
