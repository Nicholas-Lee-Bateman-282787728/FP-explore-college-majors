7967507,4,B00006FDAD,"This is, for the most part, a really nice two-disc set of television shows that appeared on the airwaves in the United States during the 1950s.  Disc one includes two episodes each of ""Annie Oakley"" and ""The Roy Rogers Show,"" and one episode of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood,"" a British-produced series than ran on CBS from 1955 to 1958.  Disc two includes two episodes from ""The Loretta Young Show"" and one episode each from ""The Milton Berle Show"" and ""What's My Line?"".
Given the age of these broadcasts, the audio and video quality of the material is generally good.  However, I was somewhat disappointed in the Robin Hood episode (the main reason that I bought this collection) because there are some video rolls similar to what happens when your VCR doesn't track a tape properly.  It's obvious that the Robin Hood episode was transferred to the disc from tape.  Still, all in all, this collection succeeds on two levels.  For older viewers, it will bring back plenty of memories, and younger viewers will get a flavor for the type of programming that existed in the early days of television.
On a side note:  Here's hoping that Madacy (the releasing company) will release more episodes of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" on DVD.  The have released some episodes on VHS tape, but it would be great to see these on DVD.",1038960000,8,1323,4.696969696969697
