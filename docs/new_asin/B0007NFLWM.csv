8049266,5,B0007NFLWM,"The songs on these DVDs are fun and catchy, smart and relatable. My son and I both love to sing and dance around the room and do the motions to all the songs! The puppets are just plain cute, from their appearance to their giggles! All the Curious Buddies episodes have been appealing to my son...and me! Plus, we love Jack's Big Music Show, from the same creators and producers. Way to go, Spiffy Pictures!! We only wish there was more where that came from!!",1245542400,,459,4.411764705882353

He will sit and watch the entire show if I let him.  I would recommend this gift set to anyone with kids between the ages of 1 and 3.",1231200000,3,282,3.8947368421052633
