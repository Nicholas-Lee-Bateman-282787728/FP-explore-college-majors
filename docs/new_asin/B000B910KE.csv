Watching MaryJo on a dvd is almost like sitting across the table from her and having a private lesson.

I like her laid back, friendly style and this dvd is very well put together.",1131408000,6,274,4.055555555555555
2409152,5,B000B910KE,"PageSage does it again. As an instructor in the stamping industry, you simply cannot find a better resource. This video from the beginning is full of useful and timely information, innovative and creative projects and is fun to watch. The viewer is taken through the materials and shown step by step outstanding projects. It truly is like having a private lesson with one of the world's finest instructors in the comfort of your own viewing area.

Mary Jo McGraw has once again shined as she shares with us her expertise and creativity. The interactive Gallery shows us a bit of Mary Jo's world and is beautiful ""eye-candy"". After seeing her first video, I hardly thought it was possible to top it. This is a beautifully done resource that everyone should invest in.",1131408000,4,766,4.803030303030303

Of all of the craft videos I have watched, I got the most out of this one, because it answered questions that as a beginning crafter I've found nowhere else. I would also recommend this for intermediate crafters as well---those who know what they need, but who aren't sure what the differences are between types of products without buying them.

MaryJo McGraw explains about the following art materials (what they are and how to best use them, including differences in quality and cost, and sometimes brands): gessos, acrylic paints (including quinacridone, phthalos, and inclusions), gel mediums, glazing mediums, glues, waxes and polishes, and pigments. She also explains more about art materials in the following projects: aging effects, faux burl wood using Golden clear tar gel, textured tissue box, coasters makeover, altered book cover, veiled illusions with beeswax, and creative layers.

After each project there is a mini-gallery illustrating variations and more examples. Extras include an indexed gallery with commentary by MaryJo McGraw, indexed tips from projects, bloopers, and supplies used.

The only flaw with this DVD is that the sound quality at times is not the best; however, it is always understandable. It is 2:16 long.

I especially enjoyed how MaryJo McGraw allows mistakes in her DVDs and then show you how to correct them; this aspect of the DVD is very practical and helpful. I learned so much from this DVD. I never had any education in art materials or art, so it was EXTREMELY beneficial!

Highly recommended.

Although informative it was very overpriced.",1155772800,3,89,4.5625

8083752,4,B000B910KE,"This DVD demonstrates techniques which, until now, I have only been able to read about in books. MaryJo is pleasant and provides tips, alternative uses for some of the products, and it was a pleasure to watch her in action. I've reviewed a couple of the projects several times and have had success applying her techniques to my own work.",1153353600,5,337,4.633333333333334

Great projects. I found the amount of ideas and tips to be terrific. Highly recommended !",1145491200,6,156,4.379310344827586
8083754,5,B000B910KE,I almost didn't buy this DVD because of several poor ratings. This DVD is very inspiring. Mary Jo is an artist and her approach is for those who aspire way beyond the scrapbooking craze that I find boring and repetitive. It explores materials that I didn't know existed.,1140739200,15,270,4.645833333333333
8083755,1,B000B910KE,"I was so excited to see a DVD by the fabulously witty and crazy Mary Jo McGraw...I snapped it right up and was really looking forward to some of MJM's signature style and fun. Unfortunately, this is the most boring thing I've ever owned. MJM speaks in a slow monotonous monotone that just makes me cringe...I even tried fast forward without sound and the thing still just drags...you can't speed this thing up enough to make it interesting. The techniques are very basic and not at all advanced or interesting. My opinion? Skip this DVD and see MJM in person. None of her character shines through in this DVD.",1138924800,7,609,4.5963302752293576
8083756,1,B000B910KE,"After reading all of the positive reviews of this DVD, I decided to buy it. What a waste of money. This DVD is so incredibly basic that it is really only for the total novice. I was hoping to learn something new about these materials, but I could get the same info from reading the label on the back of each product. I thought the projects were very amateur as well. Save your money or buy Tim Holtz' DVD that is better in every way. Sorry for the negative review, but I was VERY disappointed in this DVD and upset that I wasted $29.00 on it.",1137715200,12,542,4.122641509433962
8083757,5,B000B910KE,"Just when you think PageSage can't possibly out-do themselves, they come out with another awesome DVD that rightfully deserves a place in any reference library.

I thought I knew how to use most of the art supplies I have in my collection. MaryJo McGraw and PageSage showed me that my art supplies are not being used anywhere near to their fullest capacity. This DVD takes all the mystery out of those awesome art supplies you've got squirreled away, just waiting for you to take them out and use them! I didn't realize just how versatile my art supplies are or that I could use them in such a wide range of projects. As I watched this DVD, there must have been at least a hundred times or more when the ""light bulb"" came on for me and left me saying..""Oh, hey....I didn't know that.""...or ""NOW I understand!!!"".

MaryJo gives accurate and useful information regarding each and every product she uses in the DVD. Then she shows you how to use each product in very easy and simple projects. As a finale, she creates this totally awesome collage on a canvas using ALL the products. Impressive....inspirational....and incredibly cool!!! At first glance, the projects seem as though they might be difficult. But as you watch the DVD you easily see how they are simple, especially when you understand the products you are using. Not only are you left KNOWING you could recreate the projects you see on the DVD, you are also left KNOWING you can use that same information and create your own unique art projects. She uses and explains products most stampers and crafters already have, or products that are on our list of ""things to buy soon"". She isn't promoting her own products, she teaches us to more fully use what we already have. Its like a breath of fresh air wrapped up in a totally awesome creative adventure.

The following is a list of the products we are educated about and taught to use in this DVD:

1. Gesso

2. Gel Mediums, Omni Gel, Artists Cement, Moulding Paste

3. Glazing Mediums, Modge Podge, Diamond Glaze, Matte Medium

4. Glues: Standar Glues, Rice Paste Glues, PVA/PPA, Specialty Glues

5. Wax & Polishes: Shoe Polish, Wax Medium, Micro Glaze, Beeswax, Parfin

6. Dry Masking: tapes, friskits, masquepen (liquid masking fluid in a pen)

7. Acrylic Paints

8. Pigments: Pearl Ex, Raw Pigments, Metal Pigments (schminke) and SAFETY ISSUES!!!

The following is a list of projects and techniques taught in this DVD:

1. Aging Effects

2. Faux Burl Wood

3. Texturing Effects

4. Textured Tissue Box

5. Coasters Make-Over

6. Altered Book Covers

7. Veiled Illusions

8. Creative Layering

I highly recommend this DVD!!!

As always, the gallery and tips section of the dvd are well developed and totally interactive with the rest of the dvd. At a price of $29.95 U.S. funds....this is a deal that's hard to beat! I consider it to be a valuable addition to my reference materials library!",1131753600,26,2903,4.741035856573705
8083758,5,B000B910KE,"I have several shelves of art supplies in my craft room that I bought for doing altered books and stamping, but I've had trouble working with them and have mostly just stored them because I wasn't sure what they were supposed to be for.

MaryJo McGraw is so easy to listen to and watch!  She breaks down all the supplies: glues, paints, acrylic media, finishes, and even waxes!

What a relief! I hadn't wasted my money on these items.  MaryJo helped me figure out which thing to use on what surface; how to correct painting mistakes with glazes, how to create faux finishes and even how to attach bulky items without smelly and toxic adhesives!

GET THIS DVD!! If you have stared at all the varieties of acrylic media (gesso, acrylic gel, soft gel, heavy gel, etc) and haven't had a clue what to do, let MaryJo make it all easy!

Just the information is worth it--the projects are an added bonus! Watching her work helps all this information sink in and you'll be itching to get your brushes, knives and media out to play!",1131408000,19,1022,4.4972972972972975
