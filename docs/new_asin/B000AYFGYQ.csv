2397326,5,B000AYFGYQ,"I am American, but I still spell humour with a 'u' becuse of these two funny friends from the north. :) I first saw this show on GSN, and it hasn't disappointed me. You'll love Spenny's ""Taking the High Road"" approach to the competitions, and Kenny's ""Whatever it Takes"" approach. The funniest one, in my opinion, is the Boxing competition. This is worth watching the whole series!",1128384000,,381,4.701492537313433
2397327,5,B000AYFGYQ,"I got a sneak peek of this DVD and it is hilarious!!! ""Who can gain the most weight in a week"" is one of my favorites! These two crack me up - between Kenny's sabotage/pranks and Spenny's germophobia (see who can sit on a cow the longest) it's one gut busting laugh after another. Funniest show to ever come out of Canada! I love Kenny vs. Spenny!!!",1127174400,7,349,4.223880597014926
2397328,5,B000AYFGYQ,"I think this is the funniest show I've ever seen... sometimes I think you can tell some of the scenes are staged, but sometimes things get so weird- weird in a not very funny way- that you have to really believe this is genuine for the most part. Season 1 has some really awkward episodes that I could barely get through but in the end it is worth seeing them all. For example, I hated the episode where they try and get the girl to like them, but when she makes a huge deal about spenny not feeding the dog chocolate, it was so weird! It made up for everything. My favorite episode was the one where they get the kids to like them. I love it!",1332633600,,643,4.070866141732283
2397329,5,B000AYFGYQ,"I really like this show. These guys make me laugh hysterically. I hope to see many more episodes.
Great Show.",1324771200,,109,4.5
2397330,5,B000AYFGYQ,"This has become my favorite show. My one joy in life lately is watching Spencer Nolan Rice be humiliated time and again. I generally find each one of these shows to have at least one or two 'OH MY GOD' moments and or laugh out loud moments that I have to tell somebody about or show them.

It is crude, mean spirited and hilarious.",1200873600,,331,4.171875
2397331,4,B000AYFGYQ,"I love the show. Can't get enough.

They some how cut of the edges of the picture, which ruins the titles and graphics during the competitions.

they really should have letterboxed the dvd.",1186185600,,189,4.696969696969697
2397332,4,B000AYFGYQ,"Great TV show and I like how they put all the episodes into 1 box. As a fan of the show I was always going to give it a good review, the commentaries are canny good. Really the only advice I can give you is if you like Kenny Vs. Spenny buy this.",1173744000,,245,3.641509433962264
2397333,4,B000AYFGYQ,"I didn't like these two at first, I thought they were too childish, gross and extremely immature but I eventually got sucked in and now love watching them I'm ashamed to say!  I have to admire Kenny's sneakiness but I adore Spenny and root for him everytime (sorry Kenny).  The only problem I have with this show is that Kenny comes across as having no respect for females,  including his mother (maybe he doesn't in real life and he just acts like that for the show but how do we know?) and that he goes way too far trying to win (check out season 3 and you'll see what I mean).  Anything criminal or endangering either ones' health is in my opinion a big no no, other than that they are pretty funny.  Please Kenny get some more sleep and cut down on the caffeine you don't look so Hotz :)",1171411200,,791,4.211920529801325
2397334,1,B000AYFGYQ,"Typical Kenny cheating again every chance he gets.

I bought this for my 18 year old son. I only saw three episodes and walked away.

These young men have made money from nonsense. They use bad language way more than necessary. It could be funny or interesting to watch if they didn't cuss so much and if Kenny only occasionally ""bent"" the rules. But almost every time Kenny cheats. I guess admirers of the show find this amusing I think it is a waste of time. The classless antics are just sickening.",1168473600,,501,4.434782608695652
2397335,4,B000AYFGYQ,This is the ultimate game of survivor.  Man vs. man.  There's a warped twist in each episode when Kenny trys to cheat his way to victory.  Funny and addictive.,1168300800,,159,4.413793103448276
2397336,3,B000AYFGYQ,"Overall, this is a funny show, but as I got to the end of the first disc, all I could think about was how gross Kenny was and how bad he must smell.  In every episode he looks like hell and seems to have zero personal hygiene.  I know he does it to annoy Spenny, but come on!  He's just a nasty guy.

Also, after viewing several episodes, I agree that it appears there is definitely some scripting on the show.",1168214400,,410,4.0246913580246915
2397337,5,B000AYFGYQ,"The competitions are silly, the humiliations are hilarious (and often brutal), and the strategies employed to win border on criminal. Kenny Hotz is a brilliant, ruthless, unscrupulous competitor. Spenny is the honest guy that believes in hard work and perseverence. The clash of personalities is yet another element that adds to the hilarity. I have never been so entertained by a reality show. This is a must see and must own. Can't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD!!!",1157155200,8,473,4.851851851851852
2397338,3,B000AYFGYQ,"Who said the original was always better, I am sad that Ed Vs. Spencer is an almost exact copy scene by scene of Kenny Vs. Spenny but for some reason is just seems funnier to me.  But I have to admit I do like Kenny Vs. Spenny for the orginality just feel so sorry for Spenny..",1156550400,,276,3.9285714285714284
2397339,5,B000AYFGYQ,"Is 'Kenny Vs. Spenny' the greatest television show in the history of television?  Probably.  Is Kenny Hotz one of the most interesting people in the world?  Yep.  Does Spencer Rice deserve the constant humiliation he is subject to?  Absolutely.

The show's concept is basically this:  two Canadian best friends challenge each other to various competitions.  The winner of said competition gets to humilate the other.  Its a fairly simple premise that allows the two friends to try and outdo one another in anyway they can think of.  First, we have Kenny Hotz:  deviant mastermind who loves video games, not bathing, and going to any lengths to destroy his best friend, Spenny.  Secondly, we have Spencer 'Spenny' Rice:  a neurotic, by-the-book goon who deserves to lose.  And lose he does.

While all 24 episodes are hysterical, some of the highlights of season one are:  'Who Can Gain The Most Weight?', 'Who Is The Better Boxer?', 'Who Is Saner?', and 'Who Can Live In A Van The Longest?'.

This set contains 24 episdoes of the first season of the show.  Watch as Kenny humiliates Spenny...you will love it.  Guaranteed.  'Kenny Vs. Spenny' is probably the funniest television show in the history of the world.",1153958400,15,1212,4.905940594059406
2397340,5,B000AYFGYQ,I come from Australia and love this show so much. Everyone should own this DVD. I've watched it hundreds of times and still can't stop laughing. GET IT!! How about if I robot dance??,1142380800,3,182,4.382352941176471
2397341,5,B000AYFGYQ,"Hilarious, I end up crying I'm laughing so hard almost every time I watch it.",1140739200,3,77,4.2
2397342,3,B000AYFGYQ,"It has it's moments. Decent concept, somewhat entertaining, but unsatisfying because I really just wanted both of them to lose most of the time. The jerky Kenny and boring Spenny are both equally pathetic and unlikeable. I don't know what the bigger mystery is, why they're friends or why anyone gave them a tv show. They're not a very entertaining example of the prankster/straight-man dynamic, because while Spenny's annoyed/angry reactions are often funny, Kenny doesn't seem to be having much fun eliciting them. He's usually too serious about bullying Spenny for his antics to be endearingly goofy.

The outcomes of the challenges were often unsatisfying too. With no impartial judge all Kenny has to do to ""win"" a challenge is to convince Spenny that he has won even if he hasn't, or try to find some loophole in the criteria of the challenge which usually ends up being too questionable in it's validity to be impressively clever.

There were also moments that made me wonder whether some parts of the show were scripted. The most glaring example being when Spenny finds a vial of testosterone in the fridge, and assumes not only that it's being used by Kenny's sister who doesn't live at the house and presumably doesn't come by there very often, but that Kenny and/or his sister didn't want or expect Spenny to find the vial. There is no way anyone is actually that stupid.

It is still a kinda entertaining show, but it has more weak points than strong points and is one of my more disappointing dvd tv show purchases. Not as good as The Amazing Race, Viva La Bam, or 30 Days.",1139616000,4,1586,4.718411552346571
2397343,5,B000AYFGYQ,Simply one of the greatest and most innovative television shows in recent years.  Kenny vs. Spenny is absolutely hilarious and somethig that you will watch over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over...You get the idea.,1138579200,2,252,4.6

2397345,5,B000AYFGYQ,"Alright, I too am American, and I absolutely love this show!  I mean, it is just sooooo funny!  I first saw it on Game Show Network when I couldn't sleep one night and now I'm hooked.  My brother and I Tivo it every week and watch it together!  My favorite episode may be who can cook better because Spenny finally decides to cheat...but still loses!  Ha!  It's hilarius.  At first, you hate Kenny's deceiving ways, but now I look forward to him winning the competitions!",1133568000,5,471,4.470588235294118
2397346,5,B000AYFGYQ,"Usually I consider this kind of humour below me, but I couldn't help but be addicted to Kenny Vs Spenny. Initially I was irritated by Kenny's cheat at all cost tactics against Spenny's desire to play by the rules. Later I attitude changed so I was glad to see Kenny's ingenious initiative being rewarded against that willing-victim cry-baby Spenny. I'd recommend to anyone",1133049600,5,372,4.920634920634921
2397347,5,B000AYFGYQ,"We got this series in the UK last year, We had previously had an English version so I was unsure whether to bother watching this ""Rip off"". It was only when I saw the first one that I realised how much better Kenny Vs Spenny was than our one, I only later found out that this was the original.

I have never once been disappointed by a single episode and am firmly in the Kenny camp of winning at all costs.

Highlights for me are the Blindfold episode, the Putting on a live show, the Looking after a baby and the one where they date the same women. Absolute legends and great to hear they have just started to air the new series over there, hopefully we'll get it soon. Buy this DVD and enjoy.",1130371200,6,695,4.140740740740741

8080670,5,B000AYFGYQ,"Kenny vs. Spenny is the funniest show I have ever seen.  I was hooked from the moment I watched the first episode.  The concept may be simple (i.e., two friends engage in competitions with each other with the loser having to do something humiliating); however, the way Kenny and Spenny feed off of each other is priceless.  It makes the show that much better.  Kenny is willing to do whatever it takes to win (i.e., lie, cheat, steal, etc), whereas, Spenny (who considers himself a true competitor) tries to win in an honest fashion.  Spenny may be the more annoying of the two, but his reactions to Kennys antics are simply the best.  This is a great show that will have you rolling in laughter.",1398211200,,696,4.528
8080671,4,B000AYFGYQ,"About what you'd expect.  Most is excellent, a few episodes just miss the mark.  Either way, well worth ANY money you pay for it.",1381795200,,129,4.333333333333333
8080672,5,B000AYFGYQ,"One of the best seasons of this hilarious show. First Guy to Get a Boner Loses,First Guy to Stop Singing Loses, and of course the great Who Can Commit the Most Crimes? were all amazing",1381708800,,184,4.285714285714286
8080673,5,B000AYFGYQ,"Amazing, a lot of episodes on these discs. The discs wouldn't play on my Xbox but work fine in my computer, which was a little disappointing, but if your a fan of the show i recommend this set over the vol. 1 set put out by Comedy Central",1371945600,,238,3.9791666666666665
8080674,5,B000AYFGYQ,Best show Ever.  Comedy central missed out what would have been a awsome show to air.  The originial is the best.,1348272000,,113,4.333333333333333
8080675,5,B000AYFGYQ,"I was first introduced to this show about 6 years ago.  I saw a couple episodes on comedy central in the states.  The show had me in stitches.  I have never seen a reality comedy push the envelope so far and be so delightfully hilarious.

Years passed by without hearing anything about the show.  I figured it was cancelled. Had I known there were multiple season I would have moved to Canada to watch them.  Easily my favorite tv show of all time.  That is not some idle remark.  I've carefully thought about it since I watched the first few seasons.

If you like to laugh at typical guy humor than you'll love this show.  The only question you need to ask yourself is: Buy the whole series or buy each season individually over time?  I would recommend buying the entire series...it saves on shipping costs.",1346803200,,808,4.465753424657534
