I do not find the Simon Pegg school of comedy very funny either and violence and gore are generally, to my mind associated with pain. It also describes itself as 'a riot of filthy minded fun', so I thought there was going to be some degenerate filth as it were, but that doesn't really happen either.

What does happen are a series of non related stories told in an episodic way throughout the 95 min running time. They are all filmed in black and white with occasional flashes of colour to emphasise a moment or a thing. . Everyone in it is a sort of black sheep an outcast or a misfit and it is very close to the bone.

That said I really enjoyed it, the acting was top rate even the satanic Goths trying to invoke the devil through abuse of a comatose granny. That by the way is not a plot spoiler as there is so much more. It is a riot of emotions and ideas and is also gross, touching, understanding, human and nearly funny. As someone else said it really does help if you know a bit about Germany, for instance the snobbery that exists between Berliners both East and West and the inhabitants of Munich.
