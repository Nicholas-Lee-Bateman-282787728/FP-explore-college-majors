5927449,4,B00ELKDDEU,"Just a good old fashioned b flick horror movie. It's always fun to see a new one. Where there is a motor home, an old highway and the desert, there's bloody fun ahead !!",1392422400,,169,4.0
5927450,2,B00ELKDDEU,I enjoy older movies where you didn't find out who the killer was till the end. Now a days it seems the movies have taken away that mystery. This is one of them. In the first 5 minutes you know who he is.,1391299200,,204,3.7674418604651163
5927451,4,B00ELKDDEU,"I've been a fan of Michael Copon since ""One Tree Hill"". In this movie he plays a serial killer and it's so different from his earlier work! I found his performance very complex and I was totally mesmerized. The plot twist at the end really surprised me and worked really well.  The only thing was that I didn't think he was in the movie enough.",1384128000,,344,4.292307692307692
5927452,3,B00ELKDDEU,"Taylor (Rachel Lara) is outside with her college friends getting ready to go on a camping trip. Meanwhile inside her parents are being killed by the charismatic Melvin ""Spider"" Holiday (Michael Copon) whose name gives us that oh so clever duo meaning to the title. Not since ""Meatballs II"" have I been so impressed by a title. It is clear Melvin and Taylor are somehow related to the disjointed opening of the film of youths, killing, and a picture with the face cut out.

The slightly slutty Taylor manipulates the gang into going to a camp ground near an abandoned amusement park. The film sets up for a decent slasher with the hopes of Derrick (Alex Mandel), who is as annoying as a camel on hump day, getting it first. ""Hey guys! Hey guys! Hey guys! Look at this!""

The film falls short of it potential. Holiday's charisma wanes. He needed swagger. The killings needed more imagination. Cammi (Julia Beth Stern) needed to have her character developed as most of the characters lack development. Madison (Rachel Wixom) needed to lose a few buttons. The severed head needed to look like the person in the film. Why is getting a winning formula so difficult?

Okay as a slasher rental. Not a film you will watch twice.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex scene. No nudity.",1383782400,4,1272,4.690582959641255
5927453,1,B00ELKDDEU,"this film is just about what you would expect from the title/poster. another moronic, recyclable straight to video waste of your time. do not bother. out of all the people who participated in the making of this film, along with lionsgate, there is not one person with an IQ above 45.",1383696000,5,283,4.568627450980392
5927454,1,B00ELKDDEU,"I hurried out. Got just after midnite. Less then lame. Acting-average or below. Characterization- poor U want main actors dead before 15 min. Plot & script- sub-standard. Not one good scare, no creepiness. Film never got better.  Probably, the director was bad but may have been forced to work with- and stay inside- a pathetic script.  Props were good. The movie is not campy- it's just LAME!!
  The story was nothing unique- not even special. It was boring for the most part. The amusement park was neat looking.  They only, really, used the haunted house and what they called a 'bottle maze'.  If you took out the fake blood, and language this could have been released as a 1970's 'movie of the week' (I think that was on abc).
  There do exist, a very few, movies that this would be worth watching instead of.  But part of those 'losers' can be used educationally for ""What not to do in your first movie.""  As for 'KILLER HOLIDAY'...  It had gone lame and was shot dead before the first day of filming.  After that they just were putting nails in its coffin.
  Oh, and by the way- ""There were no costumed clowns in this movie [no clown make-up, either]!""  Contrary to the cover.",1383609600,6,1182,4.535545023696683
5927455,3,B00ELKDDEU,"Killer Holiday starts off with a flashback montage Of some kids at an amusement park..It really doesn't make much sense at the time and they use jittery camera work. Then right before the twenty somethings are leaving for a road trip, one of the girls parents are being brutally killed by(Melvin Spider Holiday)played over the top by the very handsome (Michael Coupon) unbeknownst to anyone while they`re all getting everything ready on the porch of the house.

The group of twenty somethings go on a very confusing holiday where they make a stop at a run down and closed amusement park and start to explore. They go into the Dark ride and this is the only time I felt any type of horror atmosphere.

 There are a couple of ""twists"" that I saw coming a mile away.
The fx`s were average at best. They tried to create a few clever kill scenes but it just didn't work for me.

There was some humor in the beginning that was funny but then as we got deeper into the story it was funny when it was not intended to be funny. Like when spider showed up it was attack of the fog machine and things of that nature.

It was just sort of all over the place. It wasn't boring just very confusing and I kept waiting for a payoff but no such luck because the ""twists"" were so obvious and messy. I payed 14.99 to buy it on fios. Not a good investment. I'm sure production will all give me negative reviews but I had to put out a real review so no one did what I did. It might be OK for a rent at redbox but I wouldn't pay more than that if I were you.",1382918400,10,1536,4.158249158249158
5927456,5,B00ELKDDEU,"Killer Holiday is one of the best movies of the year. Great production, keeps you guessing till the very end. Great cast as well - especially that young actor that played Dylan (David Namminga) he's one to long for in the future...",1382832000,4,231,4.523809523809524
5927457,5,B00ELKDDEU,"I saw this film at a private screening and was very impressed. I was expecting a low budget indy film, but it looked more like a big studio movie. Highly recommend it if you're looking for a good horror film.",1381276800,8,208,4.225
8606687,3,B00ELKDDEU,"First of all let me tell you this, there are no killer clowns as appears on the cover. 8 buds are on spring break and make the monumental mistake of going off the beaten trail and get lost. They have had a serial killer, Michael Copon on their tails for a very long time. I enjoyed Michael Copon and Michael Copon only. He was very menacing as the killer and I loved his nuances. HE chases the kids all over an old abandoned crappy circus. Some of the killings are pretty good and most are just routine. As for the kids, I didn't have a thought about any of them. It was one of those, oh, go ahead and kill them all movies. You need to be a die hard horror fan in order to really get anything out of this so that is the target audience.",1495843200,,736,4.01360544217687
8606688,3,B00ELKDDEU,not what i expected.,1475107200,,20,4.25
8606689,5,B00ELKDDEU,good,1444780800,,4,4.0
8606690,4,B00ELKDDEU,"The story is as straight forward as they come with friends on a trip falling victim to the brutality of a serial killer. There is a twist at the end but you kind of see it coming two scenes prior so the impact isn't as strong. Still the story is classic and fun. It does have the burden of stereotypical set-ups and banter dragging it down somewhat but the fact that it isn't a supernatural force of evil slaughtering the youths makes the film a bit darker.

Killer Holiday does bring some pretty cool actors together that look camera ready. The acting isn't stellar but the cast all give pretty decent performances with a few standing out more, notably the psycho. This one made me a bit conflicted. It is very seldom I enjoy finding a killer so hot that I define them as doable, I prefer to not really relate to killers in cinema, I never was one for celebrating psycho characters that are too close to reality. Of course I never thought the classic masked killers were ""doable"" so it isn't often I face this dilemma.

The special effects and soundtrack in Killer Holiday is the expected caveat of melodrama and death rattles set to some creepy, chilling instrumentals and sound effects. All of which work great in the movie. Even though it is more of a serial killer situation as opposed to the supernatural, unstoppable monster, the death scenes are just as memorable, bloody and creative. The only thing that holds this back from being stellar is that odd, almost Eurocentric disconnect between what is written and what is acted out. By that I mean it has that strange feel of pretending to be an American slasher instead of actually feeling like an American slasher.",1431129600,,1672,4.60738255033557
8606691,5,B00ELKDDEU,Brother liked it. I do not do scary of any type.,1426636800,,48,3.4545454545454546
8606692,1,B00ELKDDEU,"Why a reputable movie company like Lionsgate would choose to be associated with this film, is beyond me. The ideas were good, and could have for a great film. The problem here is this is extremely low budget, bad acting, nobody actors,  poor script, bad lighting, terrible fx, and everything else terrible you can imagine. This really could have been a good movie, but this piece of garbage doesn't even come close. Dr I not buy this. It is only good for a cheap rental or Netflix for free. I do not recommend this movie at all.  I paid 4 bucks for this, and i feel cheated. If a sequel comes out for this, run. Same rules apply.",1424649600,,629,4.322033898305085
8606693,2,B00ELKDDEU,"I LOVVVVE Horror movies & add into it a Run down Theme Park... Well, sorry to say Its a  (Stupid Crappy Movie)- I fell for it based on the cover. Bad move by me. P",1422316800,,163,3.657142857142857
8606694,4,B00ELKDDEU,"Good horror style movie. Great fun - awesome soundtrack and fun kills, jumped in my seat and liked all the ""DVD Special Features"" and their the gag reel super funny.",1421366400,,165,4.533333333333333
8606695,2,B00ELKDDEU,got it to see Randy Mantooth in it and he was in it for 1 min. Didn't really like the movie.,1409356800,,92,3.4285714285714284
8606696,1,B00ELKDDEU,"Often times, when a generic horror film is as lazy and predictable as Killer Holiday, the producers try to spice things up by adding something that will trick viewers into seeing it. Sometimes it's a unique location, other times they will make the film more comedic, and the most common trick of all is to have an attractive cast, that is wearing very little. Killer Holiday tries all three, which should tell you something about the story! A group of college kids rent an RV for a summer trip and decide that the highway is too boring, so they take the back roads. On the way they find an old abandoned amusement park, whose fun house is home to a serial killer. A killer with the last name Holiday, who introduces himself to his victims, yes it really is THAT bad. From there the film is one big chase to get away from the mad men. Rational people would have just gotten in the RV and left, but drunk college kids apparently aren't that bright. The cast is all no names and it really shows as some of them seemed like they were literally reading from the script. Horror movies are by nature somewhat predictable, but when you throw in some really bad, albeit good looking actors, and a bizarre story that goes around in circles, you have the recipe for something that is basically unwatchable.",1407628800,,1295,4.491525423728813
