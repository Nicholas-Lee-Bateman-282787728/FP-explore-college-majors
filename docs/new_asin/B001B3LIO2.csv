3480949,4,B001B3LIO2,"I bought this DVD because it was the cheapest release of Empire Records I was able to find. It's definitely one of my favorite movies, and although everyone was saying there's a ton of changes from the original release and this version, I don't think I really noticed a difference.

Of course, I watched Singles just because it was there and available. Yeahhhhh, not all that good of a movie.",1290729600,,392,4.6
3480950,2,B001B3LIO2,I did not enjoy either movie - poor acting and story - the 2 star was no reflection on the company - they were very efficient - quick delivery and excellent condition.,1277337600,,167,4.25
3480951,3,B001B3LIO2,"As I read, I thought the remix fan edition might have a few different scenes or lines in it, but I was wrong. This is awful, major parts of the plot have even been changed! This is almost a completely different movie. I have no idea why they would have changed this from the original version, but this is not what you want to see. Take your time and try to find an original version of this movie. I do not recommend this ""Fan Edition, Remix""",1255219200,21,441,4.1395348837209305

3480953,3,B001B3LIO2,"I am an avid lover of Empire Records.  That movie was a cult classic, up there with Clerks and Mallrats- maybe even Jay and Silent Bob.  It is an overdose of stupid, lovestruck, eccentric teenagers (and twenties) who work in a record store that is about to go under, due to some embezzeling of the funds in the safe by an employee.  They are so much like a family, that the gambling (and subsequent losing) of that money is hidden like a dark secret.  They all come together to have a store party (fest) to raise money to save the small town store.  It's funny, it's wild, introspective and exciting.  Perfection for an early 90s film.

However...
Along came the ""remix fan edition"".  In the fan edition, the words have changed from their original ""classic"" version.  I have to assume the words in this edition are the ORIGINAL scripted words, and maybe the movie that was released had the revised ones to keep the film at PG 13?  But since the released version is the one that I've grown accustomed to, that is the version that I want.
No where on this site is this product marked ""fan edition"".  I specifically bought this version (even though matched with Singles in a dual disc case) because it was NOT marked ""fan edition"".  I can't find the original version ANYWHERE.
This is very upsetting.

Viewers- PLEASE BE ADVISED- this version of Empire Records is NOT the originally released version.  Some lines have changed.",1237507200,74,1423,4.617529880478088

3481007,3,B001B3LIO2,"I should have listened to the other reviews. This is NOT the original theaterical version of Empire Records. This is a version of Empire Records with certain scenes replaced with deleted scenes or extended scenes.  If you have never watched it, this should not be the way you watch it for the first time. (I made that mistake)

But, if you have watched the original version and want to see the deleted and extended scenes to see a different version of the movie, this is pretty cool.  I must admit, after watching this and the original version within a day of each other, it's pretty cool to see the different scenes.  The Original is far superior though!!",1508371200,,656,4.581196581196581
3481008,5,B001B3LIO2,"I really thought this movie was awesome!  It has a perfect cast and soundtrack to go with it.  Joe Reaves (Anthony LaPaglia) runs an Empire Records store, but is worried that the shop might get bought out by a bigger chain.  The rest of the shop workers find this out at the end of the day and don't want to see their shop go anywhere so, they decide to take matters in their own hands to try and save it.  I don't want to say anymore and ruin it, but I guarantee you'll like this movie!  I gave this movie 5 stars for a perfect cast, soundtrack, and the interaction between the characters.",1507334400,,590,4.185840707964601

I was skeptical, but thought I'd take a chance since this was one of my favorite movies of the 1990s (and often quoted when I worked in a music store in my late teens). The remix version was just awful, so I'm quite happy to be able to enjoy this movie again!

3481263,5,B001B3LIO2,"Over the past 10-15 years there have been several movies that have released extended or alternative cut movies on DVD.  Which can be great.  However the problem became that you could not find the original theatrical cuts anywhere.  Often these special editions with added scenes or alternate scenes really altered the movie - unfortunately there have times where it took some of the joy of the movie or made the movie down right terrible (for example the Pretty Women Anniversary Special Edition = terrible).  Luckily blu-ray has been bringing back many of the Theatrical versions (Pretty Woman was one of them)

The original movie should never be lost whenever an extended/alternate cut is created.  These movies did so well to begin with for a reason.  Those scenes were often cut for a reason.  I am not saying that they shouldn't be created, because they should (and I often enjoy watching them), just that the original shouldn't be lost or impossible to find in doing so.

Empire Records is one of the movies this happened to when they created the ""Remix! Special Fan Edition"" and released it on DVD.  I know some people love this version and it was an interesting watch - especially with how it re-characterized Rex Manning (I have more sympathy for him now).  However I found some of the scenes added in to be very disjointed especially towards the end. If you pay attention you can tell some of the scenes edited in were edited in out of order - it just didn't flow very well at all.

Even if I thought some of the added content was interesting, I didn't really care for it over all.  I love the original too much, I also have quite a few friends who feel the same way.

Let's just say we are all thrilled that this blu-ray is the Original Theatrical Version.  However, it is too bad that this blu-ray does not include both versions so that the people who like the Special Edition would be happy as well.",1457913600,20,1912,4.58235294117647

8281676,5,B001B3LIO2,Singles is a 90's classic.  My child born in the late 90's and was not alive when it came out also loves it.  I think the struggles the 20 something characters experience are things any generation can relate to.  Empire Records?  That was a bit too much drama for me - so I stuck with watching Singles.,1527206400,,302,4.245614035087719
