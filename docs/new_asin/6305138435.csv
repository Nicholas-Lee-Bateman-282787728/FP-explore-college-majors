7884172,4,6305138435,"A collection of some of Buster Keaton's best short films, including the ELECTRIC HOUSE. In this film, Buster is mistaken for a professor of electricity and rewires a house with some very funny effects and amazing  results. In THE BOAT Buster builds a boat to take his family out in, until  a storm occurs which almost ruins the event! THE PALEFACE contains some  super stunts, all done by the man himself, who gets caught up with some  indians who try to kill him! FROZEN NORTH is one of my personal favorites,  with Buster totally out of character imitating William S Hart filled with  crazy sight gags and unexpected twists. In THE PLAYHOUSE, Buster plays most  of the characters showing off his talents as a film maker in an amazing  short where he works in a theatre. COPS is one of his best remembered  because of the hundreds of police who chase the poor Buster after he  accidently bombs a parade of cops!  The difinitive collection for those  who are devoted to Buster Keaton, or those who have never heard of him. A  great value pack which shows the silents accompanied by music as they  should be in perfect condition, a valuable part of my collection, make it  part of yours and have a good laugh at the Great Stone Face....",953337600,33,1235,4.55
