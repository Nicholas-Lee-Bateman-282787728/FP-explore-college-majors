Everything as promised and as expected, both inside and outside the box",1433894400,,132,4.28

him or you don't. I do, and it comes in the family, so be forewarned
:).

There are films that demand not to be analyzed. This is one. Belmondo
is a cop who behaves like a gangster to, well, get the gangsters behind
bars. His code of ethics wouldn't win medals in any police academy,
even a Third World's. Speaking of which, the way we see Marseille, it
could well be Turkey or Bolivia :). Facts are not stylized, our hero
kills and fails to be killed just by chance. You feel the danger, for
instance, when he gets into a squatter's den in order to rescue the
daughter of somebody whom he put into jail. He's a hardened man, always
with a good blunt answer: ""You should have thought about this before!""
is what he says to this man when he moans that his daughter has been
caught by this delinquents. But then, he gets the victim out of
trouble, from an environment that makes his real ""nemesis"" look less
menacing.

Morricone's score doesn't disappoint, as usual. ""Beautiful, elegant,
tense, suffocating and full of melodrama"" (written by Paul Werkmeister
""miser42"" on Amazon).

It's difficult not to compare this to the masterwork of the genre: THE
PROFESSIONAL. While it remains at the top, this would make a great 2nd
best, specially if you don't want to get emotional at the end.

Pierre Vernier makes a great if unusual (and thus, welcome) sidekick.
Like Jordan, sometimes he doesn't need to utter a word to answer. Henry
Silva is finely cast.

Enjoy!",1241222400,,1527,4.5787545787545785
