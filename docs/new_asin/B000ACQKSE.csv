Hyper envrio propaganda meant to scare the bejesus out of you - snake oil, global warming, one in the same - Al Gore should have given credit to the makers of this film for creating the formula for this kind of nonsense -- purely spun from one angle.  Buyer beware.",1264032000,,367,4.382352941176471
8077825,5,B000ACQKSE,This is prbably one of the most compelling and comprehensive videos I have seen. I use it everyyear in my HS Environmental class to start the year and refer to it often. It not only moves students but they 'get it'.,1218153600,,215,4.2682926829268295
8077826,5,B000ACQKSE,I think this is a great film that is hard to watch because it is so powerfully moving. It gives cause to think.,1207612800,,111,3.869565217391304
8077827,5,B000ACQKSE,"This movie had a great impact on me.  I was so troubled by most of it, and I cried several times, but I believe it is necessary for people to see it.  It shows how much of an impact we have had on the earth in such a short period of time.  We must do something soon to stop the destruction.  I don't mean to sound like I'm preaching, but I feel so touched by what I have seen in this movie.  I am going to show it to everyone I know.",1131408000,2,433,3.6630434782608696
