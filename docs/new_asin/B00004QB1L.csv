8570735,5,B00004QB1L,"Really cool!  The quality of this video was rough but the info and footage was really cool.  I also, reccomend teh new book ""Divining Ecstasy"" by. Dr. Sean Shayan for those interested in Salvia Divinorum.  It is published by Loompanics Unlimited.",1003622400,3,246,4.951219512195122
8570736,5,B00004QB1L,"Great video! Rare footage of people actually taking Salvia Divinorum Extract! Reminds me of the old acid trip movies of Timothy Leary in the 1960's.  Also has some great information you can't get anywhere else! Production & sound quality is a bit low in some places, but overall this has got to be one of the coolest underground videos I have ever seen!  This is a must for anyone who is into Salvia Divinorum and other psychedelics! Two (green) thumbs up!",987033600,6,456,4.617283950617284
