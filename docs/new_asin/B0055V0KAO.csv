4581545,5,B0055V0KAO,"Daisuke Niwa is just an average 14 year old boy with dreams of love. Except, he is surprised to learn, he isn't. The men in his family suffer a unique curse - after they turn 14, anytime they think of the girl they love, they transform into the Phantom Thief Dark. The curse will end only when the girl returns his feelings - but Risa has found the man of her dreams in Dark. Poor Daisuke!

This is one of my favorite anime. I thought the premise sounded ridiculous when I first read it, but I got used to it real quick. I really like the characters, the story, and the art. The story progresses over many short arcs (1-3 episodes) about various art pieces Daisuke is tasked with stealing/sealing. I find it one of the most relaxing and enjoyable shows in my collection.

This series is based on a manga that is still running (the author went on hiatus for a while), but the anime makes up its own ending that I actually really liked. The anime and manga diverge quite a bit, but I actually like the anime better. If you enjoy the show, it is worth picking up the manga for more story (though it may never be finished and certainly won't get any more physical releases over here, so it will probably be hard to find even if it does finish).",1327536000,4,1240,4.272340425531915

BTW bought this for my younger cousin, who is an avid Dark fan, for x-mas ans she was esatic!",1326672000,2,268,4.0754716981132075
4581547,5,B0055V0KAO,"This tv series is one of my favorite anime ever! The plot line is typical in the sense of love relationships, but this anime has a twist you will enjoy :)",1324771200,,154,4.0
4581548,5,B0055V0KAO,"DN Angel follows a boy named Daisuke who is inherited with the ""Niwa's family gene"" and on his 14th birthday, he discovers that he contains none other than the Phantom Thief Dark Mousy inside of himself. (Dark is his alter ego). Dark is activated only in the Niwa male's, only when that male turns 14 and has unrequited love. The only way to get rid of the phantom thief is to declare his love to his true love and have the feelings of love returned. Dark appears when Daisuke sees his true love, thinks about her for a long period of time, or when Dark must protect Daisuke (meaning Dark can appear on his own command in times of need). Daisuke's enemy is Satoshi Hiwarti (that is probably spelled wrong), a boy who carries Dark's other half and enemy Krad. The boy's try to have a normal friendship, but the angels hatred for one another gets in the way most of the time. Dark's main job is to steal artworks/objects that where made by the Hiwatri Family, that create chaos, and seal their power so these objects do not harm anyone.

So there is the basic plot of the series. DN Angel is an anime i thought was going to be kinda corny and predictable, but i was surprised by how much I really enjoyed it. This Box set includes all 26 episodes on 5 DVD's, and that is it. The box is plastic and quite nice and sturdy. Inside is just the DVDs, no episode guides, no extras. No commentary, text less songs, any type of extras, nothing. When the DVD loads, the main menu has just the episodes and the choice between English or Japanese language. Pretty boring and simple, but for $34 its worth it to me.
The voice acting is done very well. Greg Ayres, Hilary Haag, Vic Mignongia all do a fantastic job, and the guy who does daisuke's voice is prefect (I forgot his name..oops)
Most of the animation is good, there are some episodes where it looks a little sloppy, but there aren't too many of those.
If you enjoy animes with humor, romance (requited and lovely dovely), action and alter ego style of anime, then this is the series for you. I would recommend it everyone to at least check out, but for this price, this box set is worth every penny.",1320537600,3,2145,4.3625
4581549,5,B0055V0KAO,it is way different from the manga but i still love it.,1429401600,,55,3.6666666666666665

4581552,5,B0055V0KAO,DN Angel reflects to Daisuke Niwa and his surrounding fellows. Throughout this complete series it shows cooperative characters and it proves satisfactory and is encore itself. My siblings has been watching this over and over every time since its deliverance. It makes me so happy that even though I'm the only Otaku in my family that I was able to pick the one I can enjoy with with my family.,1379116800,,393,4.628571428571429
4581553,5,B0055V0KAO,This series was entertaining. I started watched it years with my son. We never saw the whole series. The delivery was fantastic.,1369612800,,128,4.863636363636363
4581554,4,B0055V0KAO,"Daisuke Niwa is 14 years old. He is the next Phantom Dark. Each generation of Niwa males shares their body with the legendary thief, Phantom Dark. Phantom Dark is frowned upon by society as a common criminal. The public doesn't know that he actually steals cursed artwork and artifacts. The young Daisuke has a crush on Risa Harada. Risa only has eyes for the Phantom thief. The one who actually loves Daisuke is the older Harada twin, Riku. Now this dilemma seems simple to me. Tell them both that you are Niwa as well as Phantom Dark. Or just choose the sister you like and be with her. Personally, I think that Risa is a bit shallow and clueless. I would definitely go for the more sincere Riku. I'll let you watch and find out who the winner is. Anyway, for the bond between Dark and Daisuke to be broken, and their duty fulfilled 2 things must happen: 1. Daisuke must steal his sacred maiden, and 2. Dark must defeat his rival, Krad. The drama and action is very good. This series is very solid.

D.N. Angel is a really good show. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are very good. You'll recognize the main characters. Vic Mignogna, Luci Christian, and Hilary Haag all play the major characters. There is a good mix of action, drama, romance, and comedy in this series. There are times when it seems to drag, and get into some unimportant story arcs. I think that the potential for this anime was higher than it actually achieved. If the useless arcs were used for relationship and character development, it could have reached its true potential and became a 5 star series. Because of those things, it was a solid 4 star series. I don't want to make it sound like this series was disappointing. It didn't disappoint. It was very good, and I'm glad I bought it. It's definitely a show that I'll revisit in the future. By no means is it one of the best anime series out there though.

It does have another strong point that separates it from many other shows. While many anime series out there today are quite perverted and geared toward males. This is a very clean and wholesome show. The characters have very sweet and pure personalities. There isn't really any fan service; unless you count the beach trip episode. The language is very mild. These things are kind of nice to see in an anime. Boobs, perverts, and Yuri are very overdone themes in anime nowadays. Although I get a kick outta that stuff once in a while, it's not essential to a strong series. I like that D.N. Angel kept it clean. It's one that you can share with the whole family. It will even teach younger kids a few important lessons about love, friendship, and family.

I apologize for rambling a bit. I had a lot to say about this show. In conclusion I recommend this series to all anime fans over the age of 8 or so. It's not the best series out there, but it's very solid and has some cute and innocent love and drama. I really enjoyed D.N. Angel and I hope you do too.",1356220800,6,2956,4.440147329650092
4581555,4,B0055V0KAO,"While the first episode was a bit slow, I kept watching this anime, and it pulled me in more and more.

This anime truly stands out in all of the anime I've watched. The characters, story and romance stand out in the fact they are serious and pure. This anime isn't one of those many silly series where the characters just degenerate over time. The creators of this anime took the lives of the characters seriously, which makes you view the characters the same way. Because of this you get sucks directly into their world.

Through most of the series, the episodes are fun and very captivating, but the show stays in one place. Some of the episodes might start painful slow and hard to get through, but if you just wait the romance and character personalities will make it so you keep coming back for more.

This series was marketed for younger viewers, because of this many of the events and scenes may be viewed as a bit childish. If you are younger or just young at heart, you might like this series.

I would recommend this series, so go watch it!",1333929600,2,1051,4.430051813471502

4581557,5,B0055V0KAO,"In an age where anime seems to be more along the fan service, gratuitous violence, and over developed female chests (not that there is anything wrong with that last one :-) ), it is good to see an anime legend brought back from the vault to give those who never saw it a chance to enjoy a great series. I have all the original disks and have watched them at least 6 times over the years.  But I digress - to the review.

Daisuke wants to be like every other boy, be with friends, draw in his art book, and to catch the eye of Risa, one of a set of twins who is the most popular girl in school.  However when he turns 14, he discovers the family secret - they are the family of the great Phantom Thief Dark who steals great works of art, ususally in the most elaborate of ways.  But the secret is these artworks are artifacts that if not controlled by Dark and the Minwa line they will cause great chaos and catastrophe.  And the only way to no longer be Dark is to capture the heart of his true love, but when Risa only has eyes for Dark, what is a boy to do.  But in the shadows the police Commissioner Satoshi (who for some reason is in Daisuke's class) also has a secret, one so great that if he loses control he could destroy the whole world.  Can Daisuke and Dark be able to juggle school, a weird family, and a career, all while trying to discover who is Daisuke's true love?

Now I do not know about trailers, or anything else since I am only writing a review on the series, but it is a true legend and one who loves action, romance and some comedy will get into.",1332892800,2,1570,4.074675324675325
