8361879,5,B002BSH5NE,"To be honest, I got this to see the Dolly Parton Interview, I found it really excellent. Charlie Rose asked the right questions and she gave him very honest and frank answers. It was quite inspirational. For one thing, she was dressed down, for another, he didn't go the usual well worn road of cheesy questions that she gets asked all the time. He focused on angles about her life, work and views that really showed her in another light and she came across as someone very genuine. If you like Dolly Parton, you'll love this. If you don't like Dolly Parton, you'll like her in this. I didn't know a lot about Sam Mendes, but the interview was very informative and again Charlie Rose had done his home work, zoned ring in on the importan questions.",1296950400,,748,4.467153284671533
