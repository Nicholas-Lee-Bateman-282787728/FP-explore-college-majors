4331823,3,B004D9SUF6,"Rating is for listing, not the series. ---

I was looking for the complete series, all in one box, as reviewed by the 'most helpful' review.  This one was 44 single sided DVD's in one box.  What I got was 8 individual season boxed sets.  I wanted to avoid the double sided DVD's and the problems associated with those releases.  So be careful which 'collection' you bid on.",1315267200,23,373,4.426470588235294
4331824,5,B004D9SUF6,Humor - Action - Adventure - Tom Selleck - TC - Beautiful Scenery in Hawaii - a Ferrari - what more could you want! This was a great show thirty years ago and still is. Our family loves to vacation in Hawaii and one of our favorite things to do is to identify places we've been to when we are watching these episodes. Just good plain fun to watch!,1306454400,13,347,4.043478260869565
4331825,3,B004D9SUF6,"MAGNUM, P.I. was an American television series that ran on CBS from 1980-88 starring Tom Selleck as Thomas Sullivan Magnum; a former Naval Intelligence officer & Vietnam Veteran now turned beach-bum private investigator living in Oahu, Hawaii and Nielsen ratings indicate that MAGNUM consistently ranked in the top 20 U.S. Television programs during the first 5 years that the series was originally telecast in the United States and was inspired by the detective drama THE ROCKFORD FILES with James Garner especially after Tom Selleck made a couple of guest starring appearances as the stellar private dick(Lance White)before NBC had cancelled Rockford in the Winter of 1980, due to James Garner developing chronic back & knee problems.

Additionally, Magnum resided in the guest-house of a posh, 200-acre beachfront estate known as Robin's Nest, in Hawaii, at the invitation of its owner Robin Masters which was the celebrated-but-never-seen author of several dozen lurid novels.

Obstensibly this is quid pro for Magnum's services based upon Magnum's claimed expertise in security; the pilot episode ""Don't Eat The Snow In Hawaii"" suggests Magnum also did Robin Masters a favor of some kind.

Robin's Nest was also guarded by 2 highly trained Doberman Pinschers(Zeus & Apollo)and all other aspects of the estate were managed by an often exasperated Englishman Jonathan Quayle Higgins III(John Hillerman), an ex-British Sgt. Major with whom often as a humorous aside during various episodes of the series, Magnum had to barter for use of the estates ammenities other than the guest-house like the Ferrari 308 GTS, tennis courts, wine cellar, expensive cameras, etc.

A recurrent theme throughout the last 2 seasons of MAGNUM, PI also had Magnum suspecting that Higgins was actually Robin Masters, especially in the 7th Season in the ""Paper Wars"" episode when Magnum gets stuck in the elevator in a building scheduled to be demolished leaving the possibility contradictory to numerous references throughout this shows whole 8-year run on CBS that made it clear that Higgins and Robin Masters are 2 different people leaving Higgins dual identity remaining an open question until the final episode ""Resolutions"" when Higgins finally admits that he is Robin Masters, but later suggests that what he said about Robin Masters was a fib.

Magnum seemingly also lived a dream lifestyle since he came & went whenever he pleased, worked only when he wanted to, practically had unlimited use of a Ferrari 308 GTS as well as many other luxeries of Robin Masters' and had a mini-fridge with a seemingly endless supply of beer, wore his fathers Rolex GMT Master wristwatch, and was seemingly surrounded by countless hot looking women who were often clients or victims involved in the investigations he solved and enjoyed adventures with his old Navy buddies from the Vietnam war T.C.(Roger Mosley)and Rick ""Orville"" Wright(Larry Manetti)that had a love/hate relationship with Magnum.

Interestingly; Magnum and Higgins would often break the 4th wall by ""locking eyes"" with the audience; but other characters did this less frequently.

At the end of the 7th Season, Magnum was killed off and the 1986-87 Season was intended to be the last season of MAGNUM, PI, but there was an outcry from fans in the Spring of 1987 and an 8th Season was produced in the Fall of 1987 for MAGNUM's final season on CBS to bring Magnum 'back to life' and to round the series off in the Spring of 1988 after the 1987-88 Season was cut short in the Winter of 1988.

So now that Universal has this complete series DVD box set of MAGNUM in the works, it will include all the episodes and seasons all the way from when Magnum first started out with his estranged relationship with Higgins, T.C., and Rick along with his swims on the beach on his spare time in the first 4 seasons all the way to the last 3 seasons when Magnum started playing sports as a pasttime instead, especially by playing baseball & basketball with Rick and TC when this show got more & more serious & less comical as opposed to the first 3 seasons of this detective drama when Magnum also drove the Ferrari a lot more too.

This DVD box set collection will also take us all the way to when Magnum's cop buddy Lt. Tanaka(Kwan Hi Lim)joined the cast & crew of this show in the 2nd Season on the ""Try To Remember"" episode to when he died off in the last season on the ""Tiger Fan"" episode as well.

What I don't understand is why Universal is releasing a complete series box set of MAGNUM, P.I. in todays sluggish economy, but on the other hand I'm not surprised since Universal has already made a complete series DVD box set of THE INCREDIBLE HULK, KNIGHT RIDER, MIAMI VICE, THE A-TEAM, and AIRWOLF, but is perhaps due to one simple reason called MONEY!

In addition to that, Universal didn't even bother to redo any of the first 4 seasons of MAGNUM, P.I. on Single-sided discs to compensate for all the problematic skipping & freezing that occured on the Double-sided discs of the first 4 seasons of the individual DVD box sets of MAGNUM, KNIGHT RIDER, MIAMI VICE, and THE A-TEAM, unlike Universal did with the complete series DVD box sets of KNIGHT RIDER & MIAMI VICE which converted all their episodes on 1-sided discs instead of 2-sided discs just like Universal did with the first 4 seasons of KNIGHT RIDER, MIAMI VICE, and THE A-TEAM.

So now that Universal has already released all 8 Seasons of MAGNUM out on DVD and has made a complete series box set of MAGNUM, P.I.; I am now anxious to see if Universal will end up making a complete series DVD box set of THE ROCKFORD FILES too and hopefully this will inspire Warner Bros. or Paramount to finally release the last 2 seasons of MATT HOUSTON with Lee Horsley & Pamela Hensley or perhaps even a complete series box set of MATT HOUSTON to add to my collection of Classic TV DVD box sets, especially to my collection of classic detective dramas like THE ROCKFORD FILES, SIMON & SIMON, and of course MAGNUM too along with the fact that at least this DVD box set shows us all of MAGNUM's episodes from the 1st Season all the way to the 8th Season complete & uncut like they were originally shown on their original air-dates on CBS with the exception of being commercial-free instead of having to watch them with all that editing and all those deleted scenes that they used to give us on WGN, USA, and A&E to allot more time for additional commercial-interruptions.",1298246400,26,10844,4.954244762954796
4331826,5,B004D9SUF6,"My sister said it best, Tom Selleck is eye-candy.  We had to get the TV show series since it ain't on much anymore!  The shows are a little bit fluffy, but fun.  Not always serious, of course, but fun.  If you're a Selleck fan, see him in the Jesse Stone series.

Every evening at 8pm after I finish fluffing the pillows(Mother prefers her pillows to feel like a soft embrace), we sit cross legged and view an episode without chatter or commentary until afterward.

8425044,4,B004D9SUF6,"3-8-16.  We are in Season Six of our second viewing of this delightful, entertaining and usually very well written ""detective"" series, or spoof, satirical, farcical treatment of serious human subjects.  Thomas Magnum seems to be a psuedo-serious  private ""investigator"" who pretends to spend most of his time getting the goods on potential divorce participants, or find missing persons, or help the police operative du jour solve a variety of crimes, most of which interestingly enough seem to involve his friends, or close acquaintances.  The writers and producers seem to have taken great delight in messing with their characters as the audience became familiar with and attached to the primary players in each week's drama.  Had to be a real chore to come up with plausible story lines, but the groundwork was well formed from the beginning with such details as their former experiences while serving in the armed forces, living on the estate of an eccentric writer and world traveler, whom we never get to meet but hear from occasionally.
  One gripe I have with all series productions is the incredible intensity and loudness of the seemingly ever-present background music.  Although very well done, it's too @#$%%& & LOUD!  I assume the writers, producers, directors and sponsors all have cousins, nephews, half-brothers and uncles who are music mavens and must be found work for, but the volume of most accompanying music is incredibly intrusive and annoying, detracting from one's enjoyment of the primary program.
