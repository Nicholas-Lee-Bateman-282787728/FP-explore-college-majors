5553922,5,B00B2TUCYW,"Nevertheless, even though there was one COMPLETELY random episode in the middle of the anime (there are no words for it), and the fact that Sash didn't spend the whole season at the all-girl's school (which would have made the series better), this didn't turn out too bad. Remember how season one was split into two boxsets? Maybe it means that season 2 has another part coming out later. After all, they left it the way they did... which I can't say for fear of spoiling you.

This series has a lot of face-paced stuff and fanservice, and I love it all. My favorite episode was where they were bowling and Sasha epically failed (Oh, God, when he screamed, ""NOOOOO!!!!!!"" after failing even though he sucked some of Tomo's soma lol).

Oh, by the way... Katja gets a couple of new slaves ;)

If you like strange ecchi and an interesting plot that isn't so happy-go-lucky (I'm tired of the typical ecchi/harem genres that are like To-Love-Ru, Girls Bravo, and so on), then you should watch this series. Start from season 1, though, or you won't have any clue what's going on, though. Don't worry! Season 1 is just as ecchi. Enjoy the breasts!",1375401600,6,1140,4.578431372549019
5553923,1,B00B2TUCYW,"I reviewed the rest too so let's end this: The manga is sadly still ongoing (violent porn in a shonen magazine is a good recipe for decent money) but the anime ends here and at least 37 episodes too late. I am not anti pornography but this ""series"" is out of control as a narrative can barely be found a ""real"" show would have problems to fill even 3 episodes with the story presented here. But have no fear as age inappropriate sadomasochism, rape, new fetishes like water-sports and the worst representation of homosexuality possible are still in. The amount of naked grade schoolers is at least doubled compared to earlier offerings and even the main character has changed his gender to give a new character for viewers to jerk off to... Let's see if the later anime by Hoods will stay in japan or if anime industry will recover from the current slump and stop relying on tits and ass to sell itself. Good modern anime shows would be Attack on Titans and Mardock Scramble (which is excessively dark) and this second season flopped in japan btw. Well shock content can only work once and it only give the industry a bad name and sets it back to the early 90s and that wasn't a good time at all.",1374019200,,1196,4.4409090909090905
5553924,3,B00B2TUCYW,"It is what it is. the story continue and it's good, but not as good the first season. The stories are predicable.",1372291200,,113,4.181818181818182

8561841,2,B00B2TUCYW,Story went off the rails in the second season and I just could not really enjoy watching it.,1444176000,,92,4.166666666666667

8561844,5,B00B2TUCYW,This anime was just what I expected. Great.,1414800000,,43,4.5
8561845,4,B00B2TUCYW,"Well I can see why all the complains were that it felt like a big filler. The season ended with a cliff hanger. I still believe season one was waaaay much better than this season. I hope there's a season three, too much of a good series to simply let it go.",1413504000,,257,3.9615384615384617

8561849,5,B00B2TUCYW,"I love the 2nd season of Qwaser of Stigamata 2 (or simply just Seikon no Qwaser) but I do have to advise if you don't like fan service or find breastfeeding disgusting than this isn't the anime for you. Sasha gets his powers from soma, which is another word for breast milk.",1390435200,,274,4.288461538461538
