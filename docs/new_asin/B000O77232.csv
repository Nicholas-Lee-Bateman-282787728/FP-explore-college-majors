8183712,5,B000O77232,"I was first introduced to Andy james videos about 1.5 years ago. I think I own 5 or 6 of them now. His instructional videos have greatly helped me in terms of improving my: playing technique, ability to create ideas or musical phrases,  navigate my way around the neck, improvise, etc...You must have some level of technical playing ability before tackling some of this stuff. These videos are really not for individuals just learning how to play guitar. Prior knowledge of chords, scales, arpeggio's. etc...would be recommended and you must know the location of every note on the neck.",1285891200,,586,4.91919191919192
