3562030,3,B001F2U72S,"When I received these first five episodes I was intrigued. The first thing that I noticed was that the animation is just so-so. It seems to be your standard Japanese anime style (if there is one) and not the best example of the art. I know that there are much more stylish examples out there.  However, the story was so compelling and mysterious that I found the rest of the series (episodes 6-25) in Japanese with English sub-titles.

After watching them all I have to say that I was very disappointed.  What started out as a dark fantasy story deteriorated into a silly cartoon.  The private detective and his assistant (I believe that they showed up around episode six and reappeared in almost all of the remaining stories) are a prime example of this, with over exaggerated facial expressions and comic reactions.  Some of the story lines were still compelling but others were not.  I watched them with my 28 year old son who is a big fan of anime and had just returned from a one and a half year teaching position in Chiba, Japan.  He agreed with me that it seemed like the writers and/or producers of the first 5 episodes were different than those that made the rest of the series.  We both could be wrong but that was our best guess.

Obviously made for Japanese television the episodes are very short and the credits take up way too much time.  Although the story held promise to be interesting in the beginning, the finale was did not live up to those expectations.  Still, I am glad that I watched it, I just wouldn't recommend spending the kind of money that the entire series will cost in the end.",1231977600,,1609,4.494845360824742
3562031,4,B001F2U72S,"Darker Than Black has an interesting premise that takes a number of interesting twists and turns.  The animation didn't seem great at first but got better as the show went on.  The sountrack reminds me of a cheesy 80s TV show.  Still, there is enough going on here to make the show worthwhile and interesting.  Contractors/assassins exist in this world with special powers and abilities.  It has a bit of an X-Men/Heroes feel to it, as well as a bit of Blade Runner or Dark City.  They keep everything mysterious but not too confusing.  A lot of characters are introduced, which requires some patience but always seems to have a good payoff.  It moves along at a pretty good clip.  There are only five episodes here, and I would definitely like to see more.",1231977600,,757,4.58955223880597
3562032,4,B001F2U72S,"coming in to 'darker than black,' the bulk of my previous anime experience consisted of robotech, and, well, robotech.  in other words, i don't really know much about it.  i've always been fascinated with anime, but i've never jumped into the genre with both feet.  however, after watching the first five episodes of 'darker than black,' i fear i may have a brand new hobby.

like most good tv series, 'darker than black' does a great job at establishing its own mythology very early on without revealing too much too soon.  it's a bit of puzzle to figure out, make no mistake, but not so confusing as to take away from any of the enjoyment of watching.  during the first couple episodes we want to know what, exactly, are contractors?  what's a moratorium? what's a doll? what's hell's gate? what's heaven's gate? why do stars fall from the night sky? what's up with the obsessive compulsive disorders?  why is the cat talking?  'darker than black' takes seemingly every day occurrences [minus the talking cat] and turns them on their heads, and usually very effectively.

despite what some others have said, i personally found the artwork beautiful to look at on my 46"" samsung lcd [ps3's do an admirable job upconverting]. the use of unconventional angles and views adds to the tone and paranoia of the show.  the characters, too, are very interesting--especially the principle anti-hero.  who is this guy? is he a good guy? a bad guy? what's his motive? he's a tough one to get a grip on, but that makes him all the more compelling.  to it's credit, 'darker than black' throw traditional gender roles out the window.  dolls can be male or female, as are contractors.  the head of police team investigating contractors is a woman--a sexy one, for sure--but a woman nonetheless.  sure, there are the typical stereotypes, but i think that's more to do with the genre than any lazy character development.  but most importantly, the characters are anchored in genuine emotion and suffer real moral dilemmas.

i think the biggest compliment one can pay a tv series, anime or otherwise, is that it brings back for more. i, for one, will definitely be back for more.  after all, who wouldn't want to know what's darker than black?  i just hope it doesn't bust my bank.",1231891200,,2264,4.741687979539642
3562033,3,B001F2U72S,"While far from the best anime I've ever watched, Dark Than Black manages to be interesting enough to rise above average so far.  This first disc contains 5 episodes and each ""story arc"" consists of 2 episodes.  So I've watched 2.5 individual story arcs.  I can say that it's interesting enough that I wanted to watch the 2nd part of each story right away.  But at the same time, having been left waiting for disc 2 before I can finish the the current plotline, I'm not at the edge of my seat waiting to find out what happens next.

The main character, Hei, is somewhat enigmatic and a bit devoid of personality.  I believe it's the way they want the character to come across, but it leaves a bit to be desired when it comes to character development.  The variety of different powers each assassin can have does allow for some very interesting possibilities.

The animation itself is decent, but not particularly stunning.  The series has a chance to be really good or really mediocre.  Still overall it's a reasonably interesting start.  If you enjoy ninja-type anime, you should at least consider giving it a try.",1231804800,,1114,4.63265306122449
3562034,4,B001F2U72S,"To start with, DARKER THAN BLACK is a damn nifty title. And, it turns out, this anime series is pretty intriguing. The deal-io is this: Some years ago, Hell's Gate opened up in Tokyo, giving rise to wide-ranging anomalies and wiping the heavens of its stars, replacing them with false ones. Hell's Gate (and Heaven's Gate, in South America) also gave birth to Dolls and Contractors. Dolls are passive  mediums who can spy from remote distances, and on whom can be imprinted temporary identites and personalities. Contractors are assassins and covert operatives, those who have gained paranormal talents and rendered detached and amoral. As such, they feel no remorse when engaged in wet works.

A fascinating fallout of a Contractor's power is that the bearer is forced into obsessive compulsive behavior. After accessing one's ability, a Contractor must then perform a remuneration of some sort (arranging pebbles, dog-earing the pages of a book, scarfing bowlfuls of noodles, etc.). This is how the Contractor fulfills his own personal contract. I dig that there's one Contractor who particularly loathes cigarette-smoking, but guess what his price is, for using his power? Another nice conceit of the show is that each of the new stars corresponds to a Contractor, and so, each Contractor is also associated with his star's Messier catalogue number (from Messier's system of assigning numbers to foreign bodies in the sky, for purposes of identification). For example, Hei's Messier Code is BK-201. But Hei is also known as the fearsome Black Reaper. He's the anti-hero of the series.

So, hey, who's Hei? He's an unassuming Chinese exchange student going by the moniker of Li Shengshun, newly arrived to Japan. Or that's his cover anyway. Hei is a Contractor. His power is generating electricity, although he's also very skilled at wielding this cable/garotte-like device. His associates comprise of a scruffy field advisor, a blue-haired Doll serving as a locator, and a talking cat, and they work for some shadowy, occasionally referred-to syndicate, although the show is keeping details close to the vest. They go around taking on this or that mission, even as rumors of the Black Reaper continue to rock the underworld.

Meanwhile, on the periphery, a gutsy female police inspector is poking around, bent on nabbing the Reaper.

DARKER THAN BLACK is a promising anime series; it's got some good stuff going for it. The animation looks good, and is in that by now generic COWBOY BEBOP style. I also like the gritty, noirish elements of the show. In brief moments, there are echoes of BLADE RUNNER in its poignancy and existential angst. And I'm very curious about further ramifications concerning Hell's Gate. The series also boasts its own terminology, in which words like ""moratorium,"" ""forfeiter,"" ""contractor,"" and ""doll"" carry unexpected definitions.

But here's the thing: I found myself feeling ambivalent about the self-contained central character; it's hard to get a read on this guy. The occasional ominous tone sensed here is partly brought on by Hei's oblique nature - you don't quite trust him. The storytelling doesn't focus much on character development; it's more intent on progressing the plot, which, by the way, tends to be nebulous and deliberately paced. There's no easy gratification in terms of getting comprehensively briefed on who's who and what's what. While DARKER THAN BLACK promptly establishes the rules of its universe, it then becomes stingy with further revelations. There are passing mentions of relevant current events and backstory, but these carrots aren't spelled out as much as thrown into the exposition, and done so casually that you have to strain your ears. If you blink, you might miss out on tidbits on Hell's Gate and on the conflict involving the UK in Argentinian soil. This initial bunch of episodes teases you along, counting on its excellence of quality to curb your impatience. It worked for me.

The DARKER THAN BLACK starter set collects the series' first five episodes and runs at 2 hours. The inaugural two-parter ""The Fallen Star of a Contract"" - centering on a frightened runaway lab researcher and her unpretentious rescuer - had me scratching my head some with its bewildering turns and its characters' murky motivations. The second episode, by the way, is marked with a sad, bittersweet ending, so, hurrah for you, if you're into that. In the second two-parter ""A New Star Shines in the Dawn Sky,"" a star is born, meaning, in the parlance of the series, that someone has just manifested Contractor abilities. And she's a high school teenager. ""Red Giant over Eastern Europe (Part 1)"" is the last included episode and pits Hei against MI6 agents who've abducted a notorious ex-Contractor. Who happens to hold crucial information desperately needed by Hei. This is the first episode in which we learn something significantly personal to Hei.

Bonus stuff includes: a relaxed, semi-goofy audio commentary on Episode 002 by American voice actors Jason Liebrecht (Hei) and Colleen Clinkenbeard (Chiaki); Cast Auditions, the English version, as the voice actors perform off-the-screen readings; Production Artwork - character bios and black & white sketches and descriptions of various settings and objects in the series; an option to play the opening (""Howling"") or the closing (""Tsukiakari"") songs; and trailers for DARKER THAN BLACK and other anime films. This being the starter set collection, there's also an empty art box included, which can either store future collected volumes in the series, or air. It's really up to you.

If all you have to go on are these five episodes, you might be tempted to jump ship. I'm leaning towards giving this anime show a chance, because the premise is that intriguing to me, and the production values are top notched. I don't mind the slow burn approach, as long as there's an eventual payoff. In the meantime, Hei remains an enigmatic character, garbed in that obligatory cool black duster. But I'm still not sure I like him.",1229126400,21,6031,5.108519269776877
3562035,4,B001F2U72S,"Despite its very slow start, Darker Than Black finds its footing quickly and takes the audience on a very intense thrill for the first five episodes. Audience members who are willing to sit through a lot of dialogue and set up in order to get their explosions and fight scenes are going to find a great drama here. The psychological mind games that the characters play with each other is creating a suspenseful series that I'm curious to see more of. Recommended.",1228262400,2,463,4.658536585365853
3562055,4,B001F2U72S,"When you can forget you are watching anime, you know you are onto something wonderful. Darker Than Black is a gripping tale where you don't always know who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. There are a group of aliens, who look like humans, known as contractors. Contractors possess some ability that makes them super-human and dangerous. They are hired to be assassins, or thieves or terrorists. A contractor usually has a 'price' to pay for using their special abilities. Some need to break a finger, others may need to eat a cigarette. However, there is also a group of rogue contractors who don't need to pay for using their abilities. One contractor, known as BK201, is such a rogue, who hunts other contractors. The entire series seems to revolve around the life of BK201 (known as Lee, without his mask.)
This is a series and volume one, whets your appetite enough to want more. (If you want more, you will have to purchase additional volumes.)
Good quality animation and story lines that keep you interested make this an anime series worth watching.",1246406400,,1067,4.711229946524064
3562056,3,B001F2U72S,"With mutants percolating all over Hollywood these days (X-Men franchise,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes-Season-One/dp/B000QDLSR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes - Season One</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Push/dp/B001OQCVI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Push</a>, even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dollhouse-Season-One/dp/B0024FAR66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dollhouse: Season One</a>), it's no surprise that the theme would turn up in Anime.  Here they aren't mutants, but ""contractors.""  And they pay a price for using their abilities.  But, I have to agree with another reviewer that ""Darker Than Black"" just didn't hook me despite my love of the genre.  It may be a result of overexposure - a ""been there, done that"" feeling.  The animation is average quality for Anime, not as spectacular as others (like Trinity Blood) but not bad by any means.  The premise IS interesting, but I prefer character development over mythology, which is where this anime failed to catch me.

The concept of stars being associated with the contractors was original, and anime is known for having convoluted and intense mythology. I like that - when it is spread over the series.  But with only five episodes on the disc I received, nearly all that time was spent in exposition.  We have our anti-hero, Hei, but we don't really get anything about him until the last episode on the disc.  I'm not usually one to abandon a series before getting to the heart, but anime is not cheap.  Each DVD in this series retails for $30 for about 2 hours of running time.  That's not outrageous for a film where you get the entire story in one sitting, but this is more like television and six volumes carries a hefty price to get what amounts to a first season.

Overall, were this on TV or given to me as a gift, I would keep watching.  I'd recommend this for fans of anime, or those who can't get enough ""mutants.""  But, casual fans may want to consider Netflix!

I would love to comment on the quality of this ""starter set.""  But, I didn't get it.  Amazon Vine sent only the regular DVD of volume 1, without the collector box the starter set should come with.  I will say the starter set for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trinity-Blood-Box-Set/dp/B000WE5I2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trinity Blood Box Set</a>&nbsp;was fantastic and worth the extra cost.",1242172800,2,2513,5.911357340720222
3562057,3,B001F2U72S,"I'm fairly new to the anime genre, with my only real exposure to it coming several years ago. As such, I wanted to try this out when I saw it available on Amazon Vine.

From what I can tell, this is fairly typical of the genre -- low-budget animation that's down and dirty with a rough, gritty style. Although the subject matter -- involving superheroes, mercenaries and lots of action -- is the kind of thing I like, this show left me cold.

I'm sure fans of the genre will have a greater appreciation for it. But it just didn't work for me.",1240444800,,542,4.252427184466019
3562058,4,B001F2U72S,"The ""starter set"" for Darker than Black (original title *,_-Z, which means Black Contractor) contains 2.5 episodes (or five half-episodes, whichever) detailing the world of Hell's Gate, dolls, and contractors (otherworldly assasins, each with a special power and a special price to pay for it). The storyline will leave you scratching your head at first, but the animation is striking and the mood very noir. Not for the pre-teen set.

3562059,4,B001F2U72S,"I aleways hate endorsing the beginning of a series because, as it progresses, you never know what to expect. Sometimes things fly off the proverbial track and leave you with something that makes you think of how much you loved the start and how much you wish you could start over. Still, as far as an anime series goes, this was really great. It had everything I wanted and then some. It had a bit of oddity, a setting that was deep and fun to follow, and it didn't do the one thing you never want to see - it didn't leave you thinking ""i wonder if this will last.""

A lot of people summarize better than I do, but I will say that I watch a lot of animated series and I really liked what i found here. It only took me one night to wathc it because it had me wanting more, actually causing me to go out and buy more of the series just to see what happens. That, in my opinion, is what you really need when you watch something. you need a little flair that leaves room for more, both impressing you and making you guess what will be over the next horizon.

3562060,3,B001F2U72S,"The following review is solely based upon episodes 1 through 5.  Darker Than Black is a dark, sometimes violent, and potentially enigmatic addition to the ever burgeoning anime library.  In the first episode, the foundation is laid with the introduction of a young man, a student who is renting an apartment to a seemingly shy and obviously mysterious young woman.  It soon becomes apparent that both have secrets, a past that is about to complicate their present lives.  For the young man, his life turns upside down when, one night while looking at the stars through a telescope, the young woman literally runs into him and he rescues her from the two men who are pursuing her.

When he later rescues her again, his role as her hero seems sealed but by episode two of this predictable plot point turns everything on its heel and the reason that the two have met becomes less obvious.

To try to explain the world in which this story takes place without having seen more than five episodes is not easy.  Apparently there's a Gate and only one person has ever been to the other side and survived.  Since the Gate's manifestation, the sky above Tokyo is no longer real.  The stars fall when a Contractor dies, which is not necessarily a bad thing because apparently Contractors kill with impunity, having no sense of remorse.  For every false star in the sky, there is a Contractor walking on Earth, hired to kill and even hunting one another down.  But not all Contractors are working outside of the law because some work within their government's control.

Confused?  I haven't even mentioned the Dolls, Moratoria, or Regressors.

As each episode begins, a new layer of the mythos in which this reality is determined is exposed.  The audience is given just a little more detail to keep the interest high and the curiosity higher.  For every question one begins to answer, at least five more are introduced.  This anime is for a more mature audience, one not still suckling on the likes of Yugi-oh or Sailor Moon.  Not as intense as some anime, it is clearly designed for an audience that has some sophistication and patience, a willingness to commit to allowing the story, and the characters, to reveal themselves.",1238025600,,2215,4.738903394255875

The gist of that story has been described elsewhere, so I'll skip that, and state that I would like to see further episodes so that I can make up my mind as to whether or not I like the series enough to get them all...as stated above, it's really too early to tell. The DVD quality is certainly fine, and I like the voice test tracks in the Special section.

3562063,4,B001F2U72S,"Surely wins the race right? Apparently that works good for Darker than Black. You are introduced to a character that pretty much doesn't give a care in the world taking another life. Sound interesting? It gets even more interesting after the first few episodes. Darker than Black focus on mainly around the abnormalities known as ""contractors"" and those they come in contact with (mainly humans) who they, the contractors, wouldn't hesitate to kill without a second thought. Logic rules them and their emotions, most of the time. Not only that, they have to do something in return for using their rather strange ""powers."" The characters certainly are interesting. Each having their own past which they must escape or look for. Others just want to have peace and quite. Death is not an issue in this anime, so if you have a problem with that (sometimes violent deaths) you won't want to watch this.

3562075,3,B001F2U72S,"Darker than Dark is an interesting anime series. Since Hell's Gate and Heaven's Gate opened, strange things have happened, including that now there are people with special powers (levitation, fire, etc). These are contractors. There are also mediums called dolls. Some work for the different governments, other for covert groups.

The premise is interesting and the specifics even more so. There are ""fake"" stars in the sky that correspond to each contractor, and every time a contractor dies, a star falls. Contractors are mostly assassins since they seem to lack a conscience.

The series is based primarily on one of the contractors, an exchange student from China. He is a mystery and we know very little about him except for his power (produces electricity), that he has a sister, and who he works for (kinda).

But, the series is very confusing. After establishing the main universe, the idea of contractors and the abnormalities that go on, the story reveals very little else. I felt a bit lost during the first 5 episodes and full of more questions than answers.

3562077,4,B001F2U72S,"Compared to most animated fare, Japanese serial `Darker than Black' is more intriguing and compelling.  Meant to draw teens and young adults, the near futuristic world of Tokyo is well drawn alternating beautiful art direction matched with bleak landscapes.

In the dystopian setting  Tokyo is plagued by contractors,  deadly human-like beings who are difficult to detect and even more difficult to destroy.  Taking place ten years after they first put up a wall upon the city and have illuminated the night sky with fake stars, a group of secret agents work undercover to find and overthrow their terror.  To complicate matters, the contractors can erase people's memories, making it even more difficult to gather information and discern the bad guys from the good guys.

`Darker than Black' is somewhat addicting.  Like all good serials, it can glue your interest for finding out more.  As science fiction it reminded me of movies like `Paprika,' `Dark City,' and the recent resurgence of zombie movies.  At first the scenes are convoluted, but with a little patience the revelations of subsequent episodes start to gel and become more fascinating.

3562078,3,B001F2U72S,"Darker than Black feels more like shades of gray - it's a moderately entertaining but highly derivative and uneven set of episodes introducing a world that is not quite ours but that feels familiar enough because it draws upon so many pop-cultural references.  It's a bit like Blade Runner - in its question whether unnatural beings with special powers that elevate them above humans can have souls - it's a bit like the Matrix - in its suggestion that the world we accept as real is really a carefully controlled illusion run by the powers that be - it's a bit like Heroes (and like all the many other superhero and comic fantasies that is based on) in its suggestion that ordinary people could have powers that make them unique.  It takes all those references and then tries to mix in a goth sensibility (the song that opens each episode and the poems are designed to appeal to angsty teenagers - who invest their anger at the mundane circumstances of their lives with a kind of profound significance -- I know, I was once there too ...).  At the same time it throws in very sweet and sentimental moments, as in the closing credits when a beautiful song plays while a sad blonde sits in the water and flowers tremble gently in the breeze.

The story is enough to keep you intrigued and the episodes are short enough not to get boring.  The basic story, as far as I can tell from this first disk (not enough to convince me to keep going with the next disk), is that in a futuristic world there was some kind of cataclysmic event that turned some people into ""contractors"" - beings with special powers, who are mostly without conscience, who must pay for each use of their power with some kind of bizarre penance (breaking a finger, forming a pattern with little rocks, singing a song....).  There is an agency that wants to keep this hidden from the public.  Then there are some other kinds of beings called ""specters"" who want...I'm not sure what they want.

One group of these contractors has a special mission to ... I'm not sure what they are trying to do but they are working together against the agents and against other bad agencies.  The leader of this group looks like a college student, but is really a superpowered contractor who can control electricity, I guess, and has a talking cat as a friend and a lady who can telepathically link to situations through water and a morose short balding guy who gives them both advice that they rarely listen to ... anyhow they have various missions which usually involve the handsome leader of this group befriending some innocent girl who knows something and pretending he's an ordinary guy but getting information from them.  He always seems to end up caring about this girl and trying to save her but it is usually too late.

It's intriguing and kind of bizarre.  The music is very odd.  Strange jazz music starts playing in the background during a seemingly ordinary conversation between agents.  Bizarrely sweet music blares during a violent scene...the animation is decent, but feels very much like a TV show (which it is).  I might watch a few more episodes if they were on TV but I'm not captivated enough after 5 episodes (on this first disc) to bother buying another set.",1234224000,,3232,4.606271777003484

That being said, I was getting eager to watch some good anime when I was given the chance to review Darker Than Black, so I jumped on it.

Overall, the episodes in this series were a whirlwind of unique plot twists and characters, some fantastic animation/drawing, and voice acting that left a lot to be desired.

I'm not one who likes to ""read"" a movie, so I was glad to have English-speaking voice actors.  However, they need some acting lessons.  Some of the dramatic scenes felt right out of a third grade play.

The plot of the series reminded me a lot of Heroes (the real-life TV series) with supernatural characters, a mysterious agency or two, realistic people with their own problems, etc.  I enjoyed the mix of characters, although it was very confusing at first.

The first five minutes threw so much information at me, I was ready to turn it off... but after that, things got much smoother and easier to follow.  But don't expect important plot elements to jump out at you, some of the most subtle events that occur are critical to the development of the story and you will miss it if you blink.

If you're a fan of the Cowboy Bebop style of animation, you'll feel right at home here.  With fight scenes, a variety of characters with their own unique presence, this reminded me a lot of my favorite anime series.

While there was violence, there wasn't much of it and it was not very graphic.  I have seen far, far worse in anime.  There was no nudity or sex.

Overall, while this pales to Cowboy Bebop it was quite entertaining.  Will I get future series?  If I get another thirst for some more anime, then yes, but I won't be rushing to the stores.",1233964800,,1841,4.447761194029851
3562080,4,B001F2U72S,"I watched the whole disc and still don't fully get what's going on, but there is still something compelling about it.

The story starts to come together around episode 4 and it gets a little easier to follow.  I found the first three episodes to be almost impenetrable, as I didn't know what was going on and they weren't telling me.  With this said, I still enjoyed the episodes.

The pace is sometimes pretty slow, but action scenes appear frequently enough to keep it interesting.  The animation style seems to be pretty typical for Japanese animation; nothing new here.

About the story

From what I can tell, something happened about 10 years before the first episode:

1. All the stars in the sky were replaced with false stars.
2. A strange area called Hell's Gate appeared in Tokyo.
3. Evil (?) creatures called contractors, dolls, and moratoriums appear.  These creatures have super powers and can cause tremendous damage.
4. A government agency tracks and attempts to kill/capture the creatures in point 3.
5. The government erases the memory of anyone who has had contact with the creatures in point 3.
6. The government builds a giant wall around Tokyo.

None of these things were explained to any real degree.  Perhaps the next DVD will flesh this thing out and provide more structure and substance to the show.  I think that this series would be better presented in a season format.

3562081,4,B001F2U72S,"I thought this was fairly good but please note I don't have a lot of experience viewing anime.  The story line held my interest, I thought the characters were good, and the technical aspects seemed decent, but again, not a lot of experience.",1232582400,,241,4.604651162790698
3562082,5,B001F2U72S,"Like a lot of good anime, Darker Than Black tells a convoluted story set in a surreal universe and peopled with plenty of mysteriously complex characters.  I think I have a pretty good feel for the story after watching the first five episodes included in this first volume, but I'm pretty sure I've only glimpsed the tip of the iceberg here.  This is a good thing, though.  I'm continually amazed by the depth of both character and story in title after title coming out of Japan, and Darker Than Black is no exception.  This isn't the most lavishly animated series I've ever seen; in fact, backgrounds are often quite bland.  The story is the thing, and there's nothing bland about that.

It's been ten years since the strange and mysterious Hell's Gate appeared in Tokyo, bringing with it several breeds of superhumans.  Even the sky is no longer real in Tokyo, but the average citizen has no idea that the stars he sees in the sky each now represent one of the ""contractors,"" men and women whose superhuman abilities are put to use for bad purposes such as assassinations and thievery.  Each contractor has his own special skill - and (in probably the weirdest aspect of the story) his own special ""price"" to pay for the use of that skill.  This strange new world also counts an unknown number of ""dolls,"" individuals who can track any given person anywhere by some kind of strange water conduction and the rarest bird of all, the ""moratorium.""  Cop and contractor alike is wary of a moratorium because, despite the name, the moratorium has the most devastating skills of all - and little or no control over the unleashing of that power.

The ""star"" of the series is Hei, an anti-hero contractor also known as the Black Reaper.  Hei's a fascinating character because he is both good and bad, and it's hard to know exactly what his whole game plan is.  His associates include a fairly unlikeable coordinator, a ""doll,"" and a talking cat.  Hei can be a comforter one minute and a villain the next - although you get the idea that he has to be working for some kind of common good, despite his contractor nature.  This show doesn't pull any punches, so don't expect to see secondary characters hanging around for multiple episodes.  Even I was surprised by a scene in episode 4 in which a terrified girl watches a terrible tragedy play out by her own unwilling hands.

I'll need more than these first five episodes to really understand what exactly is going on here, and I definitely want to get my hands on future volumes.  Darker Than Black tells a very intriguing story, and you can definitely consider me hooked on it already.",1232582400,4,2629,4.629310344827586
3562083,1,B001F2U72S,"I enjoy animated films, but I was frankly a bit bored by darker than black. The plot is fairly slow and uninteresting. A hellgate has opened in Tokyo, paranormal beings called contractors are fighting eachother for some unknown reason. There are also these mediums/ciperhish people called Dolls.  (Usually Dollls seem to be female). Contractors are portrayed as 'monsters' in human skin, but what exactly makes them this way isn't known. Hei, the protagonist is a gentle-seeming student, but he seems to kill mysteriously and without qualm.

The character design wasn't bad, but it didn't really excite me.  As others have commented, there isn't a lot of movement, so the animation seems fairly flat. The show is also fairly violent. People are killing each other, good guys such as cops are sliced up, and well, I felt it all was really kind of... Senseless.

The only episode I liked was  EP .003, which actually seemed to have some plot. I felt sorry for the girl and her father. It actually made me cry a little.

Overall, though, this story and animation didn't really interest me. It was slow and difficult to get into and just didn't have enough plot to capture my interest.",1232064000,,1181,4.821782178217822
3562084,3,B001F2U72S,"I have to admit I'm not an avid anime fan nor do I follow manga regularly - but not because of lack of interest though.  I've seen Akira, some Golgo 13, Robotech (Macross), Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, etc.  They were all really good.  Here I expected something similar, hopefully a nice supernatural / sci-fi series.  Granted, Japanese culture is different from here in the US and their story telling sometimes seem very alien to ours - but that makes it interesting right?  Yes.

Well my gripe here is not with the movie; it's with the company that translated the movie.  I enjoy watching in Japanese with subtitles - a tradition I had to embrace during the VHS days when audio was not changeable.  Many VHS tapes in the 80's had either dubbed audio or subtitles - my cousin talked me into sticking with the subtitles, which I've enjoyed all these years.  So to change things up a little bit, I watched this movie without subtitles at first listening to the English audio translation.  Out of curiosity, I later switched to the subtitles... big problem.  The story seemed different.  This character is from the city?  I thought they said before he was from China?  Well that's because the audio translation and subtitle translation are different... what?  That's right the story often leaves out info or adds extra for no reason - which is right?  Well only those fluent in Japanese know for sure.  The story itself is interesting, but this little tidbit about the story changes sure affected my concentration.  Try watching this with the English audio and English subtitles at the same time - some differences are small, but others are very drastic and very distracting.",1231977600,,1678,4.767361111111111
8300671,2,B001F2U72S,"I'm always willing to try things outside of my normal entertainment, and I've enjoyed certain anime films in the past.  I like animated movies, and I enjoy Miyazaki films; I not what one would call a ""devotee,"" however. But the title was interesting, so I thought I'd give this series a try. Ultimately, as the title of my review suggests, I did not care for it. There was very little action -- most of the animation was of characters talking to one another. The story didn't really do anything for me, either, but to be fair, I only have the first five episodes of the series. Ultimately, the series just fell flat for me.

8300673,5,B001F2U72S,it was grate. I watched it as soon as it got to me. Id really like to come back for the rest of the volumes.,1350345600,,108,3.36
8300674,3,B001F2U72S,"Okay, so I went into ""Darker Than Black"" knowing nothing about it except that it had a cool title. Also, though I was supposed to receive the ""Starter Set"", which I assume is the first, single disc DVD volume and a special DVD case to hold it as well as further volumes, I only received the DVD. This is probably more an issue for Vine reviewers such as myself and not likely to happen to someone ordering the starter set, but back to the subject at hand. There were 5 episodes on the volume one disc. The first four episodes make up two 2-part plotlines in the bigger story, and the final episode included is a ""part 1"". So, I assume every two episodes of this show go together to make one bigger episode.

To give a bit of background, I'm a big animation fan, though I'm more of a Disney guy than anything, but I like to dabble a bit in Anime because of the more mature stories and everything else, and because they draw very attractive females. ""Darker Than Black"" has both of those qualities. However, going into the first episode, it is very confusing, and after having watched the first 5 eps, not too much has been revealed to me. Bottom-line, after watching volume 1, ""Darker Than Black is a visually impressive show with good acting and all that, and I wouldn't mind seeing more of it, but I can't say it is a must-see for me. Just an ""I wouldn't mind seeing more"" kinda thing. Basically, it's set in a mysteriously disturbing future in which strange people called ""Contractors"" exist. They have supernatural powers, and each star in the sky represents a contract. A falling star means one has died. These stars are not the ""real stars"". Those no longer exist. After 5 episodes, I still really don't know what happened to the real stars or what the connection is with the Contractors and the new stars, nor what the Contractors really are (I hear they are aliens, but if this was stated in the first five episodes, then I totally missed it). Most of the Contractors, or many at least, seem to be hired assassins and other criminal types, and after they use their powers (which vary, like in X-Men or something), they have to perform some strange task different to each of them. The show follows one in particular, as well as some cops trying to... well, I don't know really, because I really don't get anyone's motivations for anything in the show so far, and there aren't any clear ""good guys"" I can tell, unless you count the cops, but, again, I've only seen the first 5 eps. This seems like a show that wants to reveal things to you slowly. That's okay as long as things DO get revealed, and it seems like the show does make progress with this, but not as much as I would have liked or enough to get me majorly hooked.

The DVD contains both the original Japanese language version with option of English subtitles and the English dubbed version. I watched the dubbed version. Perhaps I would have gotten more info from the Japanese version in terms of what the heck was going on. I will try that out lately. With the dubbed versions though, while I know they are supposed to be inferior, I don't have to read so I can enjoy the visuals more fully as well. So, I'm glad that was an option. The DVD also includes a fun audio commentary on one episode with 2 of the English dub voice actors, an art gallery that provides some good info on the characters and settings (not enough, but fair warning that it reveals the pretty obvious identity of who the ""Black Reaper"" is), audio auditions of the English voice cast, textless video of the 2 songs from the show, and a big selection of trailers for this and other shows. Do I recommend this volume 1 release of ""Darker Than Black""? Well, I'm not really one to recommend volume releases with just 1 disc and a handful of episodes. Shows should be released in complete seasons at the very least. But, if you don't mind that, it's a decent presentation with nice extras. The show itself has potential but needs more relatable, regular characters for the audience than anyone I saw in the first five episodes. I didn't get fully hooked after 5 episodes by any means, though I wouldn't be opposed to giving it a bit more of a chance, but I'd want more explained to me than what I got from the first 5 episodes. Also, the plot is a lot about underworld crime and espionage and stuff, which is not really my thing unless you have superheroes involved, so I don't know if this show could keep me for the long haul. Aside from standard, sexy Anime girls, cool visuals, and a potentially interesting sci-fi premise, there is something lacking for me, personally, and I think it's a connection to any lead characters more than anything. And a clearer understanding of what's going on and why.",1316649600,,4737,4.468822170900693
8300675,4,B001F2U72S,"Aliens disguised as humans who are engaged in mysterious and nefarious activities is not a new idea. I can recall an early Superman comic from way back where that was the story over several issues. But humans as creepy as the ones in Darker Than Black, the kind of dark and disturbing characters that haunt your dreams after you've just watched them on a DVD, that is just different enough to be interesting. The plot is a take-off on the 1960s film The Assasination Bureau in which an organization performs murders for hire. The twist, of course, is that these are intent on sowing fear and chaos on a vulnerable and complacent Earth. Anime has a wonderfully rich tradition and when it is done well - as it is on this first installment of a continuing story - then it is absorbing and thrilling entertainment. I enjoyed this DVD and found it to be an excellent introduction to a dark and intriguing saga.",1298419200,,905,4.558282208588957
8300676,3,B001F2U72S,"Throughout the first episode of Darker Than Black, viewers will probably be wondering, ""What is going on?"" We are told about some sort of demonic portal that has opened, beings called ""Contractors"" that get their powers from the stars, and various other things. By the end of the DVD, viewers will still be saying, ""What is going on?"" but they'll have watched something visually interesting as well.

The show has no real anchor, nor is anything ever explained in detail. I don't know if this is due to translation problems and bad cuts, but it is annoying. Sadly, I didn't find myself caring if the good contractors or the bad contractors succeeded, because it didn't seem to make a difference in any way.

As an interesting note, Yoko Kanno does the music for Darker Than Black. For those that don't know, Kanno is famous for her soundtracks for anime series (including Ghost in the Shell and Cowboy Bebop).

I would have trouble recommending this series to most viewers. Only those in strong need of an anime fix should check it out.",1279756800,,1036,4.712707182320442
8300677,4,B001F2U72S,"Years ago I watched the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akira/dp/B001LMU182/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akira</a>&nbsp;and thought it was the most groundbreaking animated film I ever laid eyes on. One thing I learned from my introduction into Japanese Animation is this: without a compelling story, no one will want to know more. After watching Volume 1 of Darker Than Black, it looks like I've found another story that piqued my interest.

Darker Than Black takes place in the not-too-distant future of Japan, where an area simply known as ""Hell's Gate"" is shrouded in secrecy. Once Hell's Gate appeared, the Contractors showed up soon after.

A Contractor is a person with a unique superpower such as levitation, electroshock or teleportation, among others. Each time their superpower is used, the Contractor must ""pay their price"" and complete an obsessive/compulsive action afterward such as eating a plant, dog-earing book pages, eating, smoking, or even breaking one's own fingers. Since they feel no guilt, Contractors are the perfect tools for spying and assassination.

Over the course of 5 episodes on this disc, we follow the adventures of a Contractor known as BK-201/Hei, living a double life as an exchange student called Li. He comes into contact with other Contractors, Dolls, government agencies, and much more. Japanese Animation usually leaps right into the storyline and explanations are revealed further down the road, and Darker Than Black is no exception. While nothing about Hei or his companions is fully explained, we are given just enough information to pique our curiosity and watch the next episode.

The animation was quite good - I included a few screen captures. There wasn't a lot of foul language (which I've come to expect in this genre of TV) but there are a few scenes of violence that are definitely not for young children - so the M.A. rating is appropriate here. Most of the translated dialogue flows well, but a few scenes didn't quite mesh. One example was the following:

(1) Spoken English: ""So you just moved to the city huh? Guess that explains the way you dress.""
(2) Subtitled English: ""Li-San, you're from China? Your Japanese is great.""

Now how about those DVD extras?

Within each episode, we can choose the scenes we want to watch, but for some reason there are two menus:

(1) The first menu allows us to choose between 4 chapters of the story.
(2) The second menu lets us choose the prologue, the opening song, the closing song, or the preview to the next episode.

Audio - choice of English or Japanese.
Subtitles - only English is offered.

Extras:
(a) Episode 2 commentary - contributed by Jason Liebrecht (Hei) and Colleen Clinkenbeard (Shinoda Chiaki).
(b) Cast Auditions - 11 audio clips of the actors/actresses reading for their roles.
(c) Production Artwork - 13 color sketches of characters and their biographies.
(d) Settings - 11 sketches ranging from the Porsche interior to Hei's blades.
(e) Textless songs - Music videos of the opening and closing songs, ""Howling"" and ""Tsukiakari"".
(f) Trailers - 8 different anime shows/movie trailers. Whether you enjoy vampires, ghosts, giant mechs or androids, something here will catch your fancy.

Funimation Entertainment is only too happy to gather new followers: inside the DVD case is a flyer with 40 color ads for animated shows!

So what's the verdict?

I did enjoy my introduction to this series - it left me with a cliffhanger that begs to be followed up on. I was a little disappointed that there weren't any extra features for the Japanese actors/actresses or the series creators, I would have enjoyed hearing their thoughts.

As I mentioned previously, without a compelling story, no one will want to know more. After watching Darker Than Black, I definitely want to know more about what lies beyond the Gate. If you like Japanese Animation with plots that take a little while to play out, this is the show for you.",1250640000,,3983,5.117103235747304
8300678,5,B001F2U72S,"This series has seemed to single handedly bring me back to being an anime addict. Its very original and has so many positives and things that dries anime fans wild. Like the action is nicely fitted throughout the first episodes. Before I go in too deep let me tell you what it's all about.

Darker Than Black is about a foreign exchange student named Hei. He moved into Tokyo, a city where the glittering lights in the sky are artificial stars and there are sky scraping walls surrounding the perimeter. These walls are known as ""Hell's Gate"". Hei is a contractor, one who has supernatural psychic abilities. He tends to use more technique than actual weapons and the weapons he does use sometimes are not visible to his opponent. Together with In, the duo fight opposing contractors to discover what exactly Hell's Gate is.

What I love the most about ""DTB"" is that it is its own anime and doesn't seem to be following any other story or animation style. The characters are original and good and deep enough to make you take interest in them which is a very important part that some series lack. The animation is clean and crisp, extremely good work on the action scenes and decent voice actors. No flaws and a definite anime to watch out for cause it may surprise some.",1247961600,,1271,4.5701754385964914
8300679,4,B001F2U72S,"As a kid, I grew up enjoying old school anime classics such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speed-Racer/dp/B001D11A6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Speed Racer""</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Blazers/dp/B00005QCWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Star Blazers""</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-of-the-Planets/dp/B0000B1OE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Battle of the Planets""</a>.  Since then I haven't really watched any of the more recent incarnations that have come along.  So watching ""Darker Than Black"" for the first time was a real treat for me.

Part traditional action/drama combined with Sci-Fi elements, Asian mysticism, and other key ingredients, ""Darker Than Black"" tells the story of Hei, a mild mannered Chinese foreign exchange student by day, who also happens to be a killer new form of superhuman secret agent by night.  These agents, known as ""Contractors,"" do whatever it takes to complete their missions, and each one is gifted with a unique ability, such as electricity, teleportation, etc.  Set in a futuristic period where the world appears to be partly closed off by a mystical gate, the contractors work with an against the police and other government officials in order to get the job done.

The show never fully explains the background of the characters except in small doses, keeping the audience guessing.  Is Hei a good guy or a bad guy?  Actor, Jason Liebrech, who voices the lead character, can only say that Hei is ""probably exceptionally conflicted"" with what he does.  At times you may begin to question his methods and sense of value or worth, as contractors tend to be nothing more than cold blooded assassins who will lie, cheat, steal and more in order to achieve their goals.

This First Disc presented here comprises the first 5 episodes of the series, with every two episodes making up a full show (Parts 1&2).  The first two-parter, ""The Fallen Star of a Contract"" begins the series with Hei attempting to obtain top secret information with the help of a woman, named Chiaki, who may be more than she appears, along with the police hot on their tale.  The next two-parter, ""A New Star Falls in the Dawn Sky"" highlights a scientist with a peculiar daughter who is going through some very unique changes in her life, with Hei keeping a close watch.  This episode reminded me a lot of the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firestarter/dp/6305078157/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Firestarter""</a>.  The last episode on the disc, ""Red Giant over Eastern Europe"" centers around a contractor names Havoc who has forfeited her powers and has multiple government agencies vying for the opportunity to experiment on her.  The episode also introduces us to the memorable M16 agent known as November 11.  Too bad Part 2 of this episode is not included on the disc, so you don't know what happens unless you pick up the Volume 2 DVD.

Extras include:
""Audio Commentary"" on Episode 2, ""The Fallen Star of a Contract Part 2"" with voice actors Jason Liebrich (Hei) & Colleen Clinkenbeard (Chiaki), who provide some interesting tidbits about the show, here and there, but mostly go on and on about how great they think the series is in general, with some fun sexual tension between the two to boot.

""Cast Auditions"" - audio snippets of 11 different cast members auditioning for their parts.  Each one lasts less than a minute.

""Production Artwork"" - included art and character bios for 13 characters as well as some info on the different settings that take place throughout the show.

""Textless Songs"" - both the opening theme, ""Howling,"" (by Abingdon Boys School), & closing track, ""Tsukiakari"" (sung by Rie Fu) shown without any credits on the screen.

""Trailers"" - 9 trailers for other anime shows are features, including Volume 2 of ""Darker Than Black.""

This is a really cool Anime series, with fine acting, cool effects, great fight scenes,  & impressive anime visuals.  The show also references many other famous movies and TV series, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner/dp/B000UD0ESA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Blade Runner""</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-In-Black/dp/B00177YA1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Men In Black""</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mask/dp/B00005OOQ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Black Mask""</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu/dp/B000X07TLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu</a>&nbsp;which makes watching it even more extra special. (I'm still not sure about the talking cat though) The best bonus is that the original Japanese audio is included (along with the English dubbed version) with English subtitles, so you can experience the show the way it was originally presented.  In many cases I noticed certain improvements with a few characters like Detective Misaki Kirthara, who just seemed more convincing when heard in Japanese.  The biggest disappointment, however, is that this Disc 1 is incomplete, missing the 2nd part of ""Red Giant over Eastern Europe.""  I don't see why 6 or even 8 episodes couldn't have been included on the disc instead of just 5, making the series very expensive to collect.  And besides Volume 2, later Volumes 3-6 all only contain 4 episodes each and are all very pricey.  So as impressive as the show is, one would hope that a cheaper complete boxset collection would come out at a more affordable price.  That would be the only main reason not to check it out.
