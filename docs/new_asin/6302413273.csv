Don't go here!
Basically.",965865600,2,262,4.098039215686274
458122,5,6302413273,"This is one of the greatest films ever made.  From a directing stand point, it is quite well done.  The story keeps us moving through the entire film and the beautiful work with the SR-71 and intercut dream sequences is  brilliant!  Elizondo is great, and there are some really intense  moments.
Highly recommended!",936489600,4,315,4.867924528301887
458123,5,6302413273,"A beginning that requires a seatbelt.  You can't really experience this movie unless you have your stero connected to your TV and turned waaayyy UP. The sound design is amazing, and the visuals pleasing.  The story line  needs some help, but overall it's worth buying.",911260800,3,268,4.911111111111111
7825156,1,6302413273,"Interesting concept....however, after viewing the vhs tape, i now understand why no studio has offered to put it on dvd.
Plse don't waste any  to see this.",1505001600,,155,4.7407407407407405
7825157,5,6302413273,"This was well acted, with two main characters and one walk on, yes, just two actors.  the only bad thing is that it is on vhs not dvd, still a great pic",1393372800,3,152,3.75
7825158,5,6302413273,"I cannot begin to imagine all of the movies my moving eyes have gazed at while my hungry mind cringed at the idea of ever viewing again.  The number dare I say seems limitless but perhaps a couple times a year at best I come across something special; a movie that transcends its decade and speaks to something we can all identify with which is our fragility and need for a secure place our lives can be stationed in.  This is in fact what Final Approach is about (among other things).

The film is about a test pilot of a new kind of aircraft for his day that finds himself after what seems to be a crash in one of those experimental aricraft in a doctor's office unable to recall his situation, his wherabouts, or even his name.  What proceeds is a personal journey into discovering not only the numerous details of his life and history but also what it was all for.

Some may find the movie predictable but I nor any with me did not.  I can't say that the idea of the ending hadn't crossed my mind, but the details of the finale I was nowhere even close to predicting.

If you love the bombastic explosions and hot bullets frying through tender tissues then you might wish to move along to another unsuspecting movie on that video shelf, however, if you desire something truly original, thought inspiring, and creative then may I suggest Final Approach.",1359244800,,1355,4.439516129032258
7825159,5,6302413273,"This was purchased for my 28-yr.-old son.  It held significant meaning to him and as he put it, ""It went DEEP in its message"".  When we viewed the movie, I enjoyed watching his reaction.  It was a special wish come true.",1235001600,2,220,4.317073170731708
7825160,4,6302413273,"This movie is NOT at all what you may be thinking it is about. It isn't about fast planes( the digital sound does not enhance the story, this is not a story about SR-71s!) and it isn't about war or secret missions, or cool spy stuff. This movie is a philosophical movie(and not even that!), but I won't tell you more or I'll give it away. Its a fairly good movie - not too deep, but it will stay in your mind. Elizondo is excellent in this piece, a very likable guy. That's about it.",1199923200,,483,4.094736842105263
7825161,4,6302413273,"I worked on this movie and it truly was ahead of it's time.  It was shot in 1991 with anamorphic (widscreen) 35mm cameras.  The sound design was different than any movie up till that time and probably since, in that surround sound is almost always the 'gravy' of the audio meaning it has a part in the audio, but isn't as important.  Well this movie dared to make the distinct digital surround channels as important as the front channels.  The problem we ran into is 99% of the theaters couldn't handle the powerful surround channels that this movie had!  They would crackle and distort.  But when we found a theater that could handle the sound, wow, watch out. 90db of pure digital power especially with the afterburners in the SR-71.

Unfortunately, only a DVD with it's discrete digital channels could show you how it's supposed to really sound.  I'd like to see this release in Blue-Ray or similar.  Who knows, maybe this movie will have a resurgence.",1183334400,7,955,4.6706586826347305
7825162,1,6302413273,"After reading all the great reviews I purchased this film.  All I can think of is this the same film the reviewers saw??  I was tempted many times to hit the stop button but because of the reviews, thought, ""it's got to get better soon"".  It didn't.  It simply ended with everone watching saying ""what happened?"" It seems to simply be a vehicle to try out some special effects.  Go back and watch 2001: A Space Odyssey if you want  FX.",1153180800,,435,4.308641975308642
7825163,5,6302413273,"This is the first all digital sound film ever made, originally developed as just a test bed for new digital sampling, editing, and ADR technologies; it developed into a psychological film with surprisingly good acting.  Everything about it actually gets better and better the further in you get.  By the time we're at the scenes with his wife and the bathtub, the directing of the actors is spot-on realistic.  The radio chatter is probably the most authentic of its type you'll ever hear, including references to the Tonopah Test Site where stealth tests have actually taken place.  There's probably more high quality SR-71 stock footage in this than any other tape you'll find.  My only complaint is that some of the ADR cockpit stuff is for a pilot who obviously doesn't look like the actor.  But that's something that can be overlooked on an experimental film with such a small budget.  There have since been other films that have used the same general story concept, but with a different framework, including a non-scifi French film that came out the year after this one did.  While some have said that one is a bit subtler, I'd still have to say Final Approach is even more of the art house picture.  The recent big budget incarnations of this concept, in my opinion, have just been horrible.  It's too bad this film might never get released on nonrental DVD...",1016323200,14,1367,4.754237288135593
7825164,5,6302413273,"Wow! What a great film. It was recommended by a friend and I have to say I was put off a bit reading the back of the video box - it made it seem like an ordinary action film. No way - the opposite - an intelligent, sometimes funny but ultimately cool film. The acting, along with the script is superb but I would say its not for everyones taste.",990316800,6,345,3.942857142857143
7825165,5,6302413273,It is a move that should be played in surround sound.  It blew me away with it's sound and it's suprising ending.  This movie has not dropped in price since it has come out.  I can't wait for it to come to DVD.,973728000,5,210,3.8372093023255816
