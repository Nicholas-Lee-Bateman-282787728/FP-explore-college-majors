8690660,2,B00Q7E8JB0,"This video sounded promising, but I found it disappointing. I was interested in learning about Muay Thai strategies, however what you get is a few, very basic single attacks and a few basic combinations with a defensive block thrown in. Anyone with some experience in martial arts is going to already know what Rob is teaching.
Much time on this video is spent watching students repetitiously practicing techniques. I didn't feel I really learned anything new. I gave it 2 stars because If you don't know anything about kickboxing/muay thai, then you will learn some basics. If you already know some fighting basics, then you can skip this video.",1436054400,,646,4.935779816513762
