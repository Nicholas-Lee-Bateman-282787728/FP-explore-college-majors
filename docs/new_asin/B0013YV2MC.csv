Historically Baguazhang artists were hired as caravan guards back in the days when small carts and wagons were used to transport products. China has always had plenty of tough guys and occasionally some bad boys would try to get away with a cart or two from the caravan. Baguazhang guards had to be able to fight multiple assailants while weaving in and around people and carts.

In training Baguazhang develops Linear, Angular, Circular, S and Figure Eight maneuvering and combinations. Traditionally poles were used to give the artist something to move around and hit. The poles are vertical and normally 1, 2, 3 in a triangle formation, 8 in a circle or 9 in three rows of three. The poles are there to teach us to maneuver and hit at the same time, which also brings up another concept of training.
9 palace training or unity of motion. The 9 is 3 sets of trigrams or 3 x 3.
First is High meaning the Shoulders, Elbows and Hands.
Second is Middle meaning Dan Tien (will power), Heart (determination) and Mind (intention).
Third is Low meaning Hips, Knees and Feet.

Learning to move in such a way that we are perfectly synchronized so that Shoulders and Hips, Elbows and Knees, Hands and Feet move simultaneously while our Intention, Determination and Will power focus toward the same goal internally thus guiding the extremities to accomplish that goal. This Tao in motion is said to lead to the Great Awakening. Please keep in mind this is strived for at every level of Baguazhang training even the basics.

Sifu Adam Hsu starts by discussing the History of Baguazhang, then on to some basic yin and yang theory and how Baguazhang applies this in action with an opponent. He then moves on to some interesting leg maneuvers and foot sweeps, followed by some palm / forearm training exercises. These follow a tried and proven method of instruction: A brief lecture, followed by a solo demonstration and finishing up by demonstrating partner training. Breathing while circle walking is also demonstrated and then on to the form.
Linking Forest Penetrating Form. This form has 10 sections. Each demonstrated once, about quarter to half speed. The first section is the opening section and last section is the closing, so the middle eight sections are the main form. The form is performed in an open area (No poles required).
Three Pole training is last and consists of a once through moving from pole to pole striking or rubbing with palms and forearms with moves in between. Sifu Hsu mentions that eventually one should be able to flow with any of the 8 or 64 palm techniques.",1297123200,2,2689,4.776344086021505
