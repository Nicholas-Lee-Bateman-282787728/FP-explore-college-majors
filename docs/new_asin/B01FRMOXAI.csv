7751713,5,B01FRMOXAI,"One of the great films of all time. Understated, touching, and beautifully acted. I saw this in high school in 1963, having no idea what to expect. I had never seen anything that was not mainstream Hollywood, and this opened up a whole new world. Long unavailable on dvd, this new edition is a welcome sight. If you are old enough  to remember the early 60's, try to remember that mindset as you watch it and you will see how revolutionary it was. Otherwise, just enjoy it for the gem that it is.",1473465600,,496,4.333333333333333
7751714,5,B01FRMOXAI,"Wow! This is one of those special, rare films that was so far ahead of its time, it could make your head spin. Rita Tushingham and Murray Melvin certainly shine along with Jo's mother. Every actor in this one is brilliant. This, along with Saturday night and Sunday morning are my favorite of the ""angry young man"" films",1472860800,5,320,4.5344827586206895
7751715,5,B01FRMOXAI,"A Taste of Honey is Tony Richardsons 1961 film about the lives of the British working class. Jo (Rita Tushingham) is an uneducated white slum dweller from the northern industrial city of Manchester. She and her mother, Helen (Dora Bryan), sneak out of their flat to avoid paying the rent and take another dingy furnished room. While walking around the docks, Jo meets a ships black cook, Jimmy (Paul Danquah), and becomes pregnant after a one-night stand. Left on her own when her mother is about to marry, Jo gets a job in a shoe store and moves in with her gay co-worker Geoff (Murray Melvin), forming an atypical domestic couple until Jos life is once again thrown into turmoil by her mothers unexpected return into her life.

The movie presents a gritty, depressing portrait of slum life and the poverty, lack of education, and hopelessness it entails. Ms. Tushingham, who won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival, plays Jo as an adrift soul, letting fate govern her life. Awkward yet endearing, she elicits sympathy for Jo and sustains our concern as she navigates the pitfalls of youth in unforgiving surroundings. The movie is sad, but also sweet, particularly in the scenes between Jo and Geoff  two of societys outcasts who bond despite dissimilar orientations and outlooks on life.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include new interviews with actors Rita Tushingham and Murray Melvin; audio interview with director and co-screenwriter Tony Richardson from the 1962 Cannes Film Festival; excerpt from a 1960 TV interview with A Taste of Honey playwright Shelagh Delaney; a look at the films stage origins; Momma Dont Allow, a 1956 short film by Richardson; and a critical essay.",1471824000,11,1707,4.961538461538462
7751716,5,B01FRMOXAI,This has always been a great favorite of mine and am happy Criterion will give it the edition it deserves.  One of the many UK black and white movies about life in the lower classes that were very popular in the 1960s.  Rita Tushingham and Murray Melvin are superb as the unlikely couple who end of caring for each other.  But it is the great performance given by Dora Bryan that makes it even better.  She won the Best Actress BAFTA for this and is totally smashing.  There is also fine work by Robert Stephens.  I am so happy that my well played vhs tape will finally be tossed when I purchase the Criterion CD.  Bravo to them once again.,1464048000,26,640,4.283333333333333

8761404,5,B01FRMOXAI,"( I bought the Criterion Collection version of this DVD and it comes with 2 discs and a pamphlet.) "" A Taste of Honey "" is one of the best representations of the "" kitchen sink "" genre movies to come out of England. Rita Tushingham's character ""Jo"" is distant and relatable all at the same time and you can't help but looking back at your own life hoping to recall having known someone like her and delighted if you are able to. Tushingham nailed the character of ""Jo"" and carried that movie into its cult status. The character ""Geoffrey"" is a gay student played by actor Murray Melvin. Melvin himself is gay and in a time, the early 1960's, in England when homosexuality was illegal and punishable by up to 5 years in prison, he took a lot of risks in accepting that role. Many gay movie characters before and around that time period were most often portrayed as unbalanced opportunists or as amoral creatures or high strung neurotics or as desperate loners hooked on alcohol and/or drugs or any of the various negative, stereotypical slots gay characters were assigned to in film and in print...But Murray Melvin changed that in this movie. ""Geoffrey"" is a young, gay man who is intelligent, level headed, intuitive, basically decent and an every day human being interested in the same things all people of Geoffrey's age would be interested in along with knowing he would have to be cautious as a gay man living in that time period and Melvin plays it to perfection. Melvin's character positively changed a lot of gay peoples lives for the better by giving a solid, gay character to relate to when there were so few at that time. I loved "" A Taste of Honey "" the first time I saw it and will always love it. I highly recommend this movie !",1510012800,,1742,4.4984227129337535

8761406,5,B01FRMOXAI,I saw this on TV...way back when TV was B&W. This Criterion Blu-Ray release is absolutely brilliant... for the eyes and for the movie viewer. A feast for the eyes for those who love the subtlety of the superb cinematography of Walter Lassally. The gritty streets of Manchester; the way the camera adores the actors. Just superb.,1494115200,,328,4.771929824561403
8761407,5,B01FRMOXAI,"This superbly-acted classic is one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it back when I was a kid, before there was cable, and great films came on TV on Saturday afternoons. Sit back and enjoy this poignant, thought-provoking piece from filmmaking's golden age when invention and exploring social mores were a director's duty.",1494028800,,329,4.892857142857143
