8320482,4,B001BP14UI,This DVD is great for what it is - a three episode offering based around a popular Pokemon. It's a plain DVD though with no special features.,1439596800,,141,4.2592592592592595
8320483,5,B001BP14UI,"My kids love Pokemon, and especially Wobbuffet, so I picked up this DVD for them. It has 3 full Pokemon episodes that all feature Wobbuffet, so it's great for the kids. The episodes included are:

Wobbu-Palooza!
The Wayward Wobbuffet
Who, What, When, Where, Wynaut?

Wish there were a few more episodes - seems like a lot to pay for 3 stinking episodes of a show, but it's for the kids, so I guess it's okay. They've watched it so many times that I'll definitely say we got our money's worth out of it!",1371513600,,502,4.387096774193548
