5299243,5,B009AJB0YM,"I thought this film was fantastic. I saw in limited release, and was a bit surprised that it didn't get a wider showing. It's funny, awkward, touching, and honest. As a child of the 90's, it really spoke to me, and I hope it finds a better following on video than it did in the theatres.",1354147200,9,287,4.142857142857143
5299244,1,B009AJB0YM,"I'd guess I don't need to see a movie about high school reunion. Hmmmm. If I get more interested in the movie - coz Channing is in that - I will have to check the movie out online to see what the movie is really about.

Well, if Mohammed was not in the mood to see a ""stupid movie"" about just guys talking about HS and so, then he was not in the mood. It is his thoughts and decision to do a review like he did. I just dislike people who judge about others review. Hate those people. They should be banned from amazon. That is disgusting!

thanks",1354060800,,546,4.0
5299245,4,B009AJB0YM,"I read the only review posted here and was disgusted.  The reviewer didn't ""get"" the movie at all and that's a shame.  If he would take the time to READ about what the movie was about before he saw it he may understand the things he didn't like are EXACTLY what the storyline said it would be and IS. It's a brilliant collection of individuals who act just as real people act in the situation of the story.  Jamie Linden did an excellent job capturing what a high school reunion is like and how the characters of your past change or don't!

I thought the movie flew by and would have liked to know even more and be able to spend even more time with the characters.  I can't wait for the video to be released and will have to add it to my library.  I also look forward to the next Linden production.",1351555200,13,798,4.14935064935065

5299257,4,B009AJB0YM,"I am so glad I watched this.  I almost let some of the poor ratings mislead me into avoiding it.  For anyone who has gone to a class reunion, you will empathize with one if not more of these characters.  I chose not to go to my 35th reunion this past weekend and for so many of the reasons displayed in this movie.  The script/writing was very good and who doesn't enjoy a beautiful cast :-).

It's not a ""classic"" but it is entertaining.",1505260800,,438,4.166666666666667
5299258,4,B009AJB0YM,"Captures the fears, anxieties, hopes, and dreams of a 10 years high school reunion.  Some people change & some don't.  Some hide their past selves from their current spouses

Did Channing Tatum's character hold onto the engagement ring he intends to give his current girlfriend until he knows for sure where things stand between him and his long term high school girlfriend?

Justin Long & Max Minghella have a Rosencrantz & Gildenstern type relationship going on on the side

Chris Pratt is almost unrecognizable as the awkward former bully who now wants to make amends to his former victims

Kate Mara is the loner most people didn't notice in high school, but who inspired the rock star played by Oscar Isaac",1504310400,,711,4.8347107438016526

5299262,4,B009AJB0YM,I was a little disappointed in the  story. I bought it because of Cris Pratt being in it. His character  was a school bully. That's my main objection. I'm not  used to seeing him in that kind of roll. No fault except to the story line.,1496620800,2,235,4.065217391304348

5299273,3,B009AJB0YM,There is sort of a small genre of movie's about high school reunions and I almost always enjoy them.  This one isn't great but it has a great cast.  You basically follow several little stories of people at their 10 year reunion.  For me some of the stories worked and some didn't.,1482537600,,280,4.346153846153846

5299283,4,B009AJB0YM,"Truly legitimate look at what a reunion is, and not what is portrayed in most movies. Real, honest, and the thought provoking. It is not really a comedy, but sort of rides the line of being a drama.

I can't get enough of movies like this, it has a story line, comedy plus romance.  I am Italian and i'm very romantic unlike the reviews of 99% of the guys I read reviews from on here tonight.  GOSH I feel for the women married to guys  who don't get it about a movie like this.  This hit home to how something like this movie could happen but probably doesn't very often when going to class reunions.  I too loved the ""Big Chill"" but equally loved this movie enough to watch it 4 times and also record it on my DVR.

I say go for it if you have a caring, romantic heart and if you like comedy too, maybe some of these guys should watch it a second time to catch all the little things you miss first time around.

Enjoy folks I give it a ""10"" on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the best because it has everything.  I didn't see any slow times in the movie that bogged me down, I wanted more and hope they make a second movie (but usually a sequel to a movie doesn't work as good as the first one unless its Star Wars.

5299356,1,B009AJB0YM,"10 Years does quite possibly the worst thing ever- it portrays a 10-year high school reunion as realistic as possible.  The problem?  Being realistic as possible in this case does NOT make for an interesting concept.  You've been to your high school reunions.  You know what they're like.  People have conversations, they walk around holding drinks in their hands, they see old girlfriends/boyfriends and recall their old crushes and first loves, they remember and reminisce about their high school days, they talk about all the changes that have occurred in their lives since high school, they mention their careers, families, everything you do when you haven't seen a group of people in a while.  Now...

what happens when you try to make an ENTIRE movie around this one simple concept?  You get a plotless, plodding, boring waste of time.

And that's exactly what 10 years is- a colossal waste of my time, and surely yours.  I think this should be a perfect contender for the worst movie ever.  The only parts that could even qualify as having a plot are whenever the guys stand around with their hands in their pockets and feel nervous around the girls they've always wanted in high school but were too shy or nervous then so they wait until now, believing they've built enough confidence to approach them.  Of course, everyones lives have changed since high school so the guys can't come right out and say what they *really* want to say.  That being, ""I love you and always have!""  The girls act the same way.  Shy, awkward, not really sure how to communicate with their old classmates.  But... is this really what you want to see for the first HOUR of a movie?  Not at all.

The movie makes the fatal mistake of believing that this one realistic concept is enough to base an entire storyline around, despite no such storyline even existing, so rather insultingly and hilariously, the second half of the movie is when everything winds down and the drinkers are now drunks and humiliating themselves on stage by singing out of tune or passing out drunk.  Why is this insulting and hilarious?  Because by this point, the movie writers actually think the writing in the first half is solid enough that we should care how these events turn out in the second half.  The writers think these characters have already been established given the uneventful lines they were given in the first half of the movie.  So... now we're supposed to care which woman ends up with which man, and we're supposed to care about the romantic scenes we see at the end that are entirely pointless and uninteresting due to a severe lack of character development.  AH!!!

What an unforgivably horrendous film on every single count.",1370995200,,2707,4.759656652360515

The story line is cute, with a tiny romantic surprise. Good chick-flick for a lazy afternoon.  Ladies' hearts will pitter-patter at the cute, romantic gestures of these scripted men.  Just remember, girls, this is a movie written by a group of professional writers sitting around a table in Hollywood, whose diets consist of Red Bull and Skittles.  Don't be stupid and think this stuff will happen to you, or that any relationship with Channing Tatum would be perfecto.

5299368,3,B009AJB0YM,"Just what we needed is another high school reunion romantic comedy featuring mostly impossibly good looking former classmates, all with some hang-ups or dragged baggage.  The cast is fine and each pairing has a story.

Channing Tatum is Jake and his real life wife, Jenna Dewan-Tatum is his girlfriend Jess.  He's been working up to popping the big marriage question but puts it off until after the reunion.  Once there he finds his old high school sweetheart, Mary (Rosario Dawson) along with her new husband (Ron Livingston) in tow.  Then we have drunken party boy Cully (Chris Pratt) and his disapproving wife (Ari Graynor).  Also Lynn Collins as the former high school party girl, still trying to live up to that image, but with a secret.  Best friends played by Justin Long and Max Minghella are living on a fantasy reputation and seek to get in Anna's (Collins) pants.  One of the more interesting pairings is Oscar Isaac as Reeves who has become a famous pop star whose long ago crush on Elise (Kate Mara) has been reignited.

If this all sounds all too formulaic, well it is.  On the other hand the performances are solid enough and there are enough chuckles and bubbling emotions to keep the audience interested for 90 minutes.  Watchable but also forgettable.",1364688000,,1269,4.8018433179723505

Oscar Issac plays the most interesting character. His character has become a rock star. In the film he sings his ""hit"" song. What's interesting is that Oscar Issac, the actor, wrote the song himself. His performance of this song is the highlight of the film, and has a special meaning to him and one of the other characters, quite charming. If you are not a romantic you probably won't like this film and if you are expecting goofy high jinks like a Adam Sandler film or some dumb comedy, this is not your film.

There is the bully, who is making it his business to apologize--in possibly the most aggressive way ever--for EVERY slight and episode of bad conduct levied upon his victims.  Channing Tatum is the protagonist who is involvedin a serious relationship with his girlfriend,but is dragging his feet about proposing....and of course, in the back of his mind he is wondering if his long lost love (played by Rosario Dawson) might possibly attend the reunion....

5299377,2,B009AJB0YM,"I guess that it's only fair that every generation has their version of 10 Years, a reunion movie for those who are not quite in their 30s. There isn't much original in this and, unfortunately, it's full of a lot of clich&eacute;d characters. Even less believable, however, was the fact that this was only a ten year reunion and that this must've been a well-to-do high school and these must've been some really go-getter graduates. My ten year reunion was a very informal affair at a bar with about twenty of my former classmates, none of whom were mortgage brokers, stock market traders, or pop stars, nor possessing of the kind of money to fly in from all over the globe to attend a grandiose ten year reunion on the scale of an expensive wedding reception.

The gangs all here yet nothing really interesting takes place.  10 Years is neither very funny nor very insightful. It's simply a bunch of near-30 year olds trying to reclaim their high school glory years and touching upon every reunion clich&eacute; you can imagine (the hidden secrets, the former lovers, the humbled most popular person, the drunken bully, the black playa, the Asian geek, the wallflower no one remembers, the Professor and Mary Ann).  There is a cast of well-to-moderately-well-known actors, but none stand out. Anthony Mackie, who did such a great job in The Adjustment Bureau, is wasted in a ridiculously tired role and Lynn Collins tries her best as the humbled hot girl, but is again let down by weak writing. I've not seen much with Channing Tatum, the star with the most screen time, but I'm not impressed with his skills as demonstrated in this tepid movie.

Anytime a plot is re-treaded for the umpteenth time, one hopes that the writer/director (in this case, Jamie Linden) adds a twist or two to make it their own. 10 Years does not do that, and we're given little more than a movie that would seem targeted solely for those whose high school experiences were similarly stereotypical and unrealistic as those who attended this reunion.

Channing keeps an engagement ring in an envelope of his car waiting for the right moment to spring it on his girlfriend.

The rest of the alums are the most boring group led by an obnoxious ex-bully, who tries in very ""uncomfortable' ways to apologize to those he wronged.  Then ther is the school female ""nerd"" who was excluded from everything and nobody remembers.  She is the one in the background of a high school photo with yellow shoes walking out the front door of the school.

I found just about everyone else dull to the point of extreme boredom and wondered if any of these people had any fun in high school.  I also found a lack of any chemistry between any of the characters and thought that my own high school reunions were a lot more fun and would have played out better in a film.  Even when Tatum meets up with Dawson, you don't sense any chemistry between them and wonder why Tatum ever held out marrying his girlfriend.

If you are looking for good chemistry between high school buddies American Pie is the type of film where you will find it.  If you are looking for a good reunion, I would stick to a film that does things right like The Big Chill.",1362355200,,1411,4.434108527131783

There is a lot of dialogue in this film and I seemed to have a bit of difficulty hearing all the lines of the actors. Not sure if it was the sound quality or my aging ears.

The best aspect of the movie is the cast, so if you like some of these actors, at least you get to spend some time with them. One of the most inane scenes actually does take place after the reunion with Justin Long and a friend TP-ing a young lady's front lawn. Criminal and childish, but the aftermath is actually rather touching, one of the movie's best scenes. If you like reunion movies that are childish, you might like this one.

5299388,3,B009AJB0YM,"One has to wonder how a movie like 10 YEARS gets made.  It's about a bunch of former classmates getting together for their 10 year high school reunion.  It's a mild comedy, but it is not about the comedy...there are no laugh-out-loud moments.  It's a modest drama...nothing truly earth-shattering or original happens.  Ultimately, the movie doesn't really shed any new light on the human condition.  It doesn't provide a terrific ""diversion from everyday life.""  It's just vaguely interesting as its being watched and then fades from the memory nearly as quickly.

10 YEARS does have some nice performances going for it.  We get to see some fun actors playing some roles that (for the most part) are not larger than life.  They are (mostly) age appropriate.  Their dialogue is mostly well-done and believable.  It's just that nothing they are involved in feels particularly meaningful.  I'm totally okay with a movie not feeling it needs some ""larger"" meaning.  Slice-of-life is okay with me.  But 10 YEARS is just too laid back, and perhaps it has TOO many plot-lines.  We're introduced to a BUNCH of characters, and we can't get to know many of them very well.  If some of the lines had been dropped and the others developed a bit more richly, perhaps the movie could have resonated.

The actor taking the most screen time is Channing Tatum.  He's returning to town with his long-time girlfriend, and they are both aware that he may run into his high school sweetheart (Rosario Dawson).  The interplay is well-done...but because the movie doesn't want to take on anything too dramatic, their reunion is flat and only occasionally interesting.  It may be realistic, but it isn't dramatic.  But we do get a chance to see Tatum taking on a smaller-than-life role for a change, and he does just fine.  He's not the next ""great actor"" of our generation, but he has shown a great ability lately to modulate his persona nicely to fit the demands of his roles, be they romantic, dramatic or comedic.  One can do a lot worse than that.  If he continues to develop, he could have a decent career.  He's no longer just a lunkhead.

Chris Pratt and Ari Graynor pair up well here.  They're high school sweethearts who married and stayed in the same small town.  He has failed to grow up, except that he's developed an adult sized alcohol problem, and he proceeds to get stinking drunk, but also has the idea of apologizing to all the ""nerds"" he tormented during high school.  Graynor follows behind, trying to clean up the damage all his good intentions cause.  It's a bit over-the-top but somehow believable...aided by Pratt's full commitment to ""jerkiness"" and Graynor's growing discontent.

Speaking of Pratt, his PARKS AND RECREATION cast mate Aubry Plaza shows up as the new wife of classmate Brian Geharty, who reunites with his HURT LOCKER cast mate Anthony Mackie.  Their subplot is silly and completely dispensable.  Mackie comes off the most like a complete caricature.  I think he's supposed to be funny, but the writing gives him nothing.  It's as though writer/director Jamie Linden was just lining up all the folks he could to be in his movie and then tossing roles at them, with varying degrees of success.

The most ""movie-like"" plot involved Justin Long (too old and haggard looking) and Max Minghella as reunited best friends/rivals, as they attempt to impress former classmate Anna (Lynn Collins).  They each play their characters at a heightened level from the rest of the film, and while their plot progresses in a more predictable way, at least things happen, lessons are learned and their final scene together is by far the most touching moment of the film.  Which all goes to prove that down-playing a role is not always the best move.  In my mind, Collins steals the whole movie.

Interesting note (at least, interesting to me).  The movie was, surprisingly, filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where I live.  It takes place in a fictitious small town called Lake something-or-other.  I recognized the city...but it is not well-featured.  This is a small film and no doubt filmed here due to the nice financial credits the state gives for film production...not because it completed any aesthetic idea for the director.

10 YEARS is not a bad movie, but it is completely forgettable.  If you're a HUGE fan of one of the stars, you should see it.  Otherwise, I can't really recommend you spend the 90 minutes on it.",1360713600,,4426,4.824468085106383

They have a great cast burdened with the task of acting normal and being put into normal everyday situations. There are plenty of stories here, friendships, budding romance, breaking up of a romance to rekindle an old frlame, terrible marriages and remorseful people that regret being jerks to minorities. There is subtle humor with little charm or spark of anything that would make this movie memorable for anything other than how real is dull. Please skip this movie.

5299400,4,B009AJB0YM,"A class reunion is a unique experience and everyone has different expectations when they go to one. The 10 year reunion is usually the most important as most people have moved on into different aspects of their life but some of the old emotions and friendships still exist and there is nothing like nostalgia to bring back the true inner feelings. This film depicts the reality of a 10 year class reunion.

The cast is well put together and they all did a good job at playing their roles. The film is a romantic comedy and there are some good parts and bad. Every type of character you can imagine is in the film and they play their roles to the hilt. My wife and I enjoyed it and as you watch the film you can put your classmate's names in for the characters and separate the winners from the losers. There are of course the stereotypes that all schools have like the hot chick, prom queen, the bully, the prom king and the quite wimpy nerd. In this case they even put in the professional and successful singer.

As the different couples hook up, and in some cases separate, you can see how their lives have changed them or how they have never matured beyond high school. Over all we thought it was a pretty good movie. This is a must see film before you go to your first reunion, it will set your mind in the right mode. You will walk around your class reunion laughing at the antics of the people because you will remember this movie.",1359504000,,1437,4.318518518518519

For the most part these several people who attend a high school reunion are unhappy with their lives. A touching sequence where one attendee plays guitar and sings his hit love ballad to the woman who inspired it when they were teenagers is a peaceful and welcome romantic moment. Even this is bittersweet, for they never did or do get together, and his future return to Albuquerque is doubtful, as his life is taken up with endless concerts and lonely motel rooms.

Although old friends are reunited and some infatuations laid to rest, in the end the main thing that's resolved is everyone is different, older but not necessarily wiser, settled in life but only satisfied to a certain extent. Not exactly as escapist film.",1358985600,,974,4.690058479532164

10 Years is basically about friends coming together at a reunion and there are many small stories that make up one big theme. Going back to undo what you did and see if you can do it right.

Albeit cliche I was impressed how the cast took the tender writing and worked their experience to make this a very nostalgic movie.

From the moment I pushed play, I fell in love over and over again with the new character introduced and empathized with their plight. I laughed and I cried and I wanted to know so much even after the story ended.

I never went to my ten year reunion. I felt that everyone would still be very much like high school and that many people wouldn't have grown up yet. I look at these people at the age of 27 and 28 and think....no way...they are NOT ten years out of high school. This was way more mature than I think a 10 year reunion would be. I felt this was more like a twenty year reunion.
But if you can get past that, the stories was very true. Everyone had that first love, the bully, the popular kids, the geeks. It's interesting to see everyone handling interactions as adults.
I'm looking forward to my twentieth reunion.",1358726400,,784,4.304054054054054
5299410,3,B009AJB0YM,"Channing Tatum and Rosario Dawson may headline 10 Years, but the rest of the actors is filled with a bunch of actors you may not know their real names but undoubtedly really like:  Jason Street!  The dude from Office Space! The chick from Safety Not Guaranteed!  Bright Abbott!  Rooney Mara's underrated sister!  The chick from Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist that was not Nora!  The Mac Guy!  The black dude from the Hurt Locker!  Unfortunately with all these likable actors, they were unable to rise above a very average script.

10 Years takes part over one night of a high school reunion and you will be able to figure out how each character's storyline will end within two minutes of meeting them (well aside from two guys who I swore would turn out to be gay for each other).  Tatum and Dawson were the king and queen of the prom who have not really seen much of each other since going away to college and one is married while the other is about to be.  Oscar Isaac went on to be a John Mayer type who probably came back for only one, extremely attractive, reason (surprisingly his biggest hit was not painfully bad or even cheesy, but actually catchy).  None of the other characters are really that well flushed out the most egregious being Aubrey Plaza who is resigned to be the wife of a former white dude who thought he was black and does not get to show off her trademark snark at all.  But it may be worth checking out if you enjoy the cast as much as I do (Jason Street raps!!!).

Some relationships were ridiculously overdone.  The movie takes place over one night that seemed endlessly long.  There are a few funny places.  But, most of the humor was beaten into the viewer too much.  Considering I'm in my 50s I thought I was just too old to relate.  But my 26 yr old daughter liked it less than I did.

5299414,3,B009AJB0YM,"10 Years was a strange one for me.  You recognize most of the actors and actresses, but not really who they are.  They usually play bit roles or supporting actors.  The movie itself is a hit and a miss.  The comedy is kind of cheesy, corny, slapstick, leaving not really laughing, only finding it mildly funny.  For the better part of the movie I really didn't care for it.  The saving grace was a little towards the end, when the cheesy comedy turned a little serious and became a little touching, adding more meaning to an otherwise meaningless movie.  Rosario Dawson's plot line had the most impact, and she was also the one who did the best of all the actors.  In the end the serious tone of the end of the movie recovered from the faltering comedy feel of the beginning and middle of the movie.  Can't really say that I would recommend it, but wasn't a complete waste of time.

Everybody has moved on in their lives, some have married, one moved to New York, one a hit song writer, one a high school bully now father of two etc. For most this is the first time they have seen each other in years.
Without giving too much away, you come to realize that their lives are entwined around their high school days in some way.
The movie, although well produced, seems a fairly low budget affair with most of it taking place in just two places, the hall of the high school and the after party in a bar.  This doesn't detract one bit from the movie as the real quality lies in the screenwriting.  The characters draw you into their lives and endear you to them and ultimately show you that no matter what the outside appearances are, everyone is flawed in one way or other and everyone has some kind of baggage or skeleton in the closet. Some more major than others but everyone has them.
10 years is one of those strange feel-good type movies that works. It's well acted, well written and one that I will probably watch again in a few months.

5299422,3,B009AJB0YM,"The film ""10 Years"" tries to be a poignant, fun look at life ten years after high school. It has a competent cast and a lot of potential, and indeed there are some moments which are amusing and charming. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have mentioned, there's not much going on beneath the surface. Despite a noble effort at realism and complexity, the players are still largely caricatures - the clueless jock, the not-so-glamorous beauty queen, the moody rock star with unrequited love.  The movie drifts along with no focus, and the scenarios feel cliched: a drunken bully harasses a group of nerds with an unwanted apology, a wife discovers a secret side to her husband from his past, a guy seeks a balance between his current girlfriend and his high school sweetheart, and an unhappily married man tries to haplessly pick up girls.  Nothing feels entirely original, and despite some decent acting, none of the characters really develop an identity of their own.

The two-hour film drags in places and could probably have benefitted from some tighter pacing.  Unlike some of Anchor Bay's other films, this one really feels low budget and a bit amateurish, as if everyone involved in this production knew it was destined to be a forgettable impulse rental.  Fans of ""Parks and Recreation"" might be interested in seeing Chris Pratt and Aubrey Plaza in the same film, although they don't really appear together and poor Aubrey is completely wasted in a tiny, throwaway part.

We have a cross section of mostly white, fit, largely pretentious crowd get together. The former class bully who kept apologizing to everyone made the movie extremely stupid.

You have the HS sweethearts who married with children and are miserable, the HS sweethearts who grew up and apart and moved on to new loves only to see each other again after many years apart, which brings awkwardness to all four. There's the cruel Jock who got fat and wants to make amends to all he bullied, a street boy turned prep whose wife finds out about his past and is more than a little disgusted. The guy who turned into a famous rock star but never forgot his first love, and her funny yellow shoes, these two were my favorite. His hit song is all about her and she doesn't even know it because she's never heard him sing. But I've spoiled enough.

It's a really cute watch, but again only surface deep for do many characters to keep up with! Very funny though and the cast did a great job.

5299433,3,B009AJB0YM,"While ""10 Years"" is neither completely awful nor completely memorable, Lynn Collins' performance as Anna did engage me completely.  She plays the high school hottie who comes to the ten-year high school reunion glamorously dressed, playing every bit the vamp.  But as in the Cinderella tale, when Justin Long as Marty and Max Minghella as A.J. follow her home and give her the honor of lacing her front yard tree with toilet paper, her castle is decidedly suburban and her situation unstable with two children from two different men.  The transition she has from the life of the party to the struggling woman trying to bring up her kids in her parents' old house is completely believable and riveting.  Watch ""10 Years"" for Lynn Collins.

Channing Tatum has developed into a big movie star, usually likeable and charming, but not on the young actor list most likely to win an Oscar.  In this film, he plays Jake who was the high school prom king.  Channing's real-life wife Jenna Dewan-Tatum plays Jess, his girlfriend to whom he tries to find the nerve to propose.  Rosario Dawson is beautiful as Jake's high school flame.  Ron Livingston plays Dawson's husband Paul.  As the outsider, Livingston is not given much to do.  As an actor with numerous credits, I wondered why he took such a flat role.

Ari Graynor also does a fine job as Sam, the wife of the class bully, Cully, played by Chris Pratt.  He's so obnoxious that one wonders what the attraction was in the first place.  But Graynor copes well with a script that has her try to convince us that she's holding the marriage together, maybe because of the children.  Her one moment where she breaks out is delightful, but then Sam backtracks to stand by her man.

Oscar Isaac has a nice appearance as the sensitive guy Reeves who is a singer and has carried a torch for his high school crush who inspired a hit song, which he sings for her.

""10 Years"" is entertaining, but hardly riveting.  Enjoy!",1357344000,,1956,4.653061224489796
5299434,4,B009AJB0YM,"Have you been to your ten-year high school reunion yet?  If you have then you will relate to this film starring Channing Tatum.  There were a couple of stereotypes like the hot girl everyone's eager to see whether or not she got fat.  Or the class bully whom you're hoping doesn't show up at all.  Most of all, though, when you go to your reunion you're eager to see the people who meant the most to you.  Like a sweetheart, or the guy you had a crush on.  All of these scenarios are represented in this film.  I admit, I chose it because of Anthony Mackie whom I'd just seen kicking vampire butt in Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter, but I'm glad I watched this film.  It was more poignant than I thought it would be.  A lot of the characters matured in the ten years since they'd graduated.  Although one of them was still a bully deep down even though he made a show of having 'changed'.  Entertaining and even enlightening, give 10 Years a try.",1357257600,27,946,4.318181818181818
5299435,3,B009AJB0YM,"Jamie Linden wrote and directed this little flimsy bit of fluff, a movie that falls somewhere between the Hangover and the Bridesmaids obsession. The concept apparently was to demonstrate what happens to high school graduates who return to their past at a 10-year reunion. Some change for the better, some for what worse, some are successful, some only claim to be successful when they are not, stars prove not to have shone for long, old tentative romances alter for both good and bad.  As one character states when the evening comes to a close `We all have our messes' and nothing could be more true.

Jake and Jess (Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan-Tatum) are happy but Jake can't gather the strength to give Jess the engagement ring he keeps in an envelope in his glove compartment (he is distracted by his old flame Mary (Rosario Dawson) who is married to Paul (Ron Livingston); Marty and Aj (Justin Long and Max Minghella) were fast friends in high school but both think the other is the something they're not until a thwarted race to date the once luscious Anna (Lynn Collins) only to discover that she still lives a most unglamorous life in the same place where she lived as a school beauty queen on now a mother to two children the fathers of whom she doesn't know; former high school bully and complete slob Cully (Chris Pratt) embarrasses everyone with his drunken gross behavior  and is only forgiven by his long suffering wife Sam(Ari Graynor); Reeves (Oscar Isaac) is one of the few who made it as a singer and meets up with the girl Elise (Kate Mara) about whom he wrote his popular song; the others have less story fleshed out - Scott Porter, Brian Geraghty, Aubrey Plaza, Aaron Yoo, Anthony Mackie among them.

Part of the problem with this film is the noise of the background music (attributed to Chad Fischer) that covers the dialogue through three quarters of the film.  Finally in the last 10 minutes or so of the movie there is actually some story about which we care, but until that time the behavior of these '28 year olds' is obnoxious to unremarkable.

5299443,1,B009AJB0YM,"I thought ""10 years"" would be a funny, light slice of life comedy set at a high school reunion. Being a comedy I anticipated a film with some predictable stuff but also to have funny dialogue and comedic elements. I was wrong.

""10 Years"" was a painfully uninteresting film filled with generic characters, completely cliched situations and no plot. The film has no character development and relies on stereotypes (the bully, the jock, the musician, the hot girl) to create its cast. The film starts off slow as we watch several people chatting about high school and heading out for the reunion. Main character Jake (Channing Tatum) is in love with his current girlfriend but his old flame whom he has not seen in years shows up at the reunion and stirs up old feelings. Other characters discuss the challenges of being married, working for the man and making amends for their mistakes in the past. The dialogue ranges from boring to hokey. Any insight into who the characters were or their growth since high school as people is near absent. Given the talent in this film one would think the actors might be able to elevate the material in the film above a vanity project for Channing Tatum (who also produced) but sadly they do not.

I'm sure some viewers will think this is a realistic depiction of life and enjoy it. For me high school reunions are exciting only to catch up with people you haven't seen in years. We never really know any of these characters and that is where the film ultimately fails. Overall, if you are looking for a boring 2 hours where you listen to people you don't care about and missed your own high school reunion this film will do nicely. Otherwise if you are want to have a fun movie night there are plenty of other films out there to watch.",1356998400,3,1772,4.551724137931035
5299444,3,B009AJB0YM,"""10 Years"", is a slow moving yet insightful drama about friends returning for their ten-year high school reunion. Of course things have changed and nothing turned out quite like they thought. There is the man (Cully) who married a cheerleader (Sam) who seems to love his life (as a car salesman, husband and father), but wonders if he is missing out on the carefree lifestyle that his classmates have. Not to mention he can't wait for the reunion because he intends to apologize to all of those that he harassed or bullied. There is Jake, who can't move forward with his new love, until he stops pondering the what ifs when it relates to his ex, Mary. Then there is the rock-star Reeves, who has been in love with a classmate since Physics class, who never knew he existed. And finally there are two friends, who are competing for the attention of the home coming queen (whose life has not turned out quite like she had hoped).  As in real life, all wonder where life is taking them and marvel at where they have been. And while there was nothing really original about the story, I thought that the actors did a decent job with the script they had. Overall, I give ""10 years"" a 2.5-3.",1356998400,,1184,4.481481481481482

5299449,4,B009AJB0YM,"I got this movie as a change of pace. I'd been watching a lot of older movies and thought I'd like a change and looked at this as just that. I was really surprised at how much I liked it. This movie is a well-made and well written look at a group of friends, acquaintances and victims and victimizers from High School at their 10 year reunion and the rest of the day, before and after.

While some of the characters are archetypes and others are masses of cliche's, the movie is so well written and acted that even those characters are not off-putting. Even the ex-bully who spends most of the movie drinking and trying to get all of his ex-victims to accept his non-stop apologies is both more pathetic and sympathetic than he has any right to be. His long-suffering wife makes him more than the cringe-inducing, clod he might otherwise seem. He only made me feel uncomfortable once or twice, which is not really much for such a possible movie sabateur.

The most interesting characters are the couple of ex-high school sweethearts who haven't seen each other in years and the ""Rock Star"" and his unknowing inspiration. Both of these couples are at the heart of what makes this such a good movie. The two ex-sweethearts both make peace with the disappointments of their past with each other that help them realize how much their current partners are the best things in their lives.

The ""Rock Star"" lets the girl he secretly had a crush on know that she was the secret to his success to a certain extent and that they are closer in ways than either of them realize.

I won't give it all away, but know that anyone who has ever wondered what ever happened to that girl they had an unrequited crush on, or that boy who went to the prom without them will find the situations in this movie familiar, funny, fun and an entertaining way to spend some time in front of your TV without feeling guilty or taken advantage of. I really recommend it!",1356912000,,1939,4.468926553672317
5299450,3,B009AJB0YM,"There have been many high school reunion movies, so it takes a degree of originality to provide a new spin to this kind of movie.  What resonates most about ""10 Years"" is its authentic feel.  The characters bicker over trivial matters, they have mixed feelings about confronting their youth and people from that period, and most appear settled into their lives rather than searching aimlessly for direction.  They are older than the characters in the John Hughes' flicks of the 1980's, yet the overall film will remind you of Hughes' work.

Channing Tatum, who seems to be everywhere these days, plays the guy voted most popular in high school.  Rosario Dawson plays his high school girlfriend.  The quiet guy in high school -- the one hardly anyone really noticed -- returns as a rock star with a current hit song.  Kate Mara is the former outcast.  And Lynn Collins is the party girl pursued by high school nerds-on-the-make Justin Long and Max Minghella.

The movie, like an actual reunion, has a meandering quality as we observe bits and pieces of the characters' stories and catch up with their lives, just as their former classmates do.  This episodic approach has its pluses and minuses.  It enables us to learn a bit about quite a few folks, but it fails to delve any deeper than the surface to reveal what makes them tick.

""10 Years"" is pleasant enough, though far from a must-see.  If you like the actors, that's reason enough to watch.  Tatum gets better with every movie and Justin Long is especially good as once-a-nerd, always-a-nerd Marty.

5299455,4,B009AJB0YM,"There are movies that portray a slice of life. Movies that show us a certain part of one's lifetime. Such a film is director/writer Jaime Linden's ""10 Years"". It is a film built on one evening, one high school reunion that brings about the details of the who we were, where our journey brought us, and who we are now. Sometimes, people change, and sometimes situations change, but then sometimes, there are those who don't change.

The film begins with Jake and his girlfriend, Jess (Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan-Tatum) arriving at a friend's house, married couple Cully and Sam (Chris Pratt and Ari Graynor). There, the two are joined by more friends in high school, Marty and AJ (Justin Long and Max Minghella), a now semi-famous musician, Reeves (Oscar Isaac) and Scott and his wife, Suki (Scott Porter and Eiko Nijo). The group drives to the venue of their high school reunion, where they meet up with old acquaintances such as high school shy girl, Elise (Kate Mara), the most popular girl in high school, Anna (Lynn Collins), the event organizer, Julie (Kelly Noonan), Jake's old flame, Mary (Rosario Dawson) and close buds Andre (Anthony Mackie) and Garrity (Brian Geraghty) with his wife (Aubrey Plaza). Things really pick up even more after the gang goes to an old hang out. Some things never do change while some things are worth looking back to, only to move forward.

I do have to admit that the film has a ridiculously amount of characters. It would be easy to say that it was an effort to keep track of everything that was going on. But the screenplay knew exactly where to go, it manages to keep things close to the ground, and with the direction, it manages to emulate the actual feeling of what goes on in a gathering. Linden's careful hand in the direction avoids paying too much attention to certain key characters, albeit there are those that just stood up, and manages to keep the film's flow natural and easy to follow.

It is all about reunions and the script keeps it focus on its premise. It is all about knowing what was before, appreciating what was, and trying to move on or maybe build on what was before. ""10 Years"" is a film that moves around with more subplots than what an actual core point. I found the way the script moved around its less than compelling areas to be amusing and sometimes, odd (in the case of Cully and Garrity). They were simple things that made an impact in the narrative and yet, not so much as to draw the fire away from the film's main premise of moving on. Some areas felt like `fillers' while some certainly carried more punch than the other stories.

I do have to say that I found myself more immersed into the Elise-Reeves dynamic than I expected. The chemistry between Isaac and Mara just almost stole the show. It was touching, uplifting and sometimes heart-breaking. It is about getting `smart' and about trying to catch up. The Anna-AJ-Marty dynamic felt more like a filler in the beginning, but it became one of the film's best points in the screenplay. The Dawson-Tatum connection had a lot of heart, and the two were good in their roles, their last scene together also became one of the film's best highlights.

""10 Years"" is a piece of life. It may appear to be non-essential at first look, but it does have a good message to bring its viewers. Yes, it is built on formula, characters that we've all seen before, but really, what part of high school reunion isn't? The film manages to charm because of its sincerity.  It is the kind of movie that definitely had its good intentions. While I cannot say that it is essential to one's collection, it is worth a watch, at least once. [3  Out of 5 Stars]",1356825600,,3670,4.5683890577507595
5299456,3,B009AJB0YM,"I'm joking. This movie wasn't bad--it has a lot of good actors that are fun to watch regardless of the material. I enjoyed it, but I can't say it was fantastic. As a comedy, it wasn't that funny. As a high school reunion revenge fantasy, it was also lukewarm. As a romance, also not that scintillating. But it had a little bit of all these things and was at least as entertaining as my own high school reunion. I am only giving it 3 out of 5 stars.

I like Rosario Dawson a lot. Her story arc was a bit muddled for me to follow. She liked Channing Tatum's character in high school but for some reason--try as I might I couldn't follow what that was--they drifted apart. Now they are both in other relationships but have unfinished business, even if it doesn't amount to much. Interesting back story is that Jenna Dewan-Tatum, who plays his current girl friend, is now his real-life wife. Justin Long is another actor that I like. His story is also not that great, but good to see you again. Justin. I recognized Scott Porter from The Good Wife where he was Kalinda's rival investigator Blake Calamar. He and Archie Panjabi had some super charged scenes where she came at him with a baseball bat. Much less interesting here. Chris Pratt and Aubrey Plaza play a cute but quirky couple on Parks and Recreation. Here they are not so cute coupled with other people. Plaza is distressed about her boyfriend's past--until she is won over by his break dancing. Pratt is now fat and married, and realizes he was a bully and a jerk in high school. He tries to make amends, but does it in a drunken and obnoxiously aggressive manner.

There is one other story arc about a guy who has a hit song inspired by one of his classmates who was only vaguely aware of him. While looking for photos of her they can only find one, and as soon as she comments on her yellow shoes, you know that they are going to turn up in the lyrics to his one hit wonder. Drunken karaoke at Pretzels, the dive bar they all hung out at, provides the setting. In spite of the fact that you know it is coming from a mile away, it is still a touching moment. Oscar Isaac, as Reeves, has a background in music and went to Julliard. He does a more than credible job as the troubadour. He kept reminding me of David Krumholtz, if Krumholtz had come from Guatemala, as Oscar has.

The movie has a great ensemble cast that all played their parts brilliantly.  Each of them seemed to have a different agenda for showing up whether it be for closure, to apologize, to relive past glories or for second chances.  I thought the interaction of all the friends felt natural and believable as they reminisced about their high school days.

It's a story about growing up and a lot of the characters are dealing with being someplace in live that they didn't really envision themselves being.  Not that none of the friends are successful, one of the characters is a big time recording artist who comes back looking for people who will treat him like a normal person and not the star that he is.

5299483,5,B009AJB0YM,Loved it! One of the most realistic movies that is charming as well!! I think it might be my favorite movie of Channing Tatum!,1355011200,,126,4.291666666666667
5299484,5,B009AJB0YM,"I was a little reluctant to watch this movie given the couple bad reviews that I read on Amazon and the ""average"" IMDB rating. I just finished watching this and I would indeed rate this at least 7 out of 10. The story line had humor, romance, realism, and the acting and storyline were both above average.

I don't like silly movies that have no heart or emotion in both acting and storyline, and this movie, 10 Years, has both Heart and Emotion and left me feeling like watching it again.

This will go into my movie Library.",1354320000,29,526,4.357142857142857
5299485,4,B009AJB0YM,"I really enjoyed watching this film. Anybody can relate to one character or another. The movie seemed very real and honest, my reunion is not for a few more years. but people do change over the years.  I watched an interview where the cast mentioned the movie was mostly improv but was scripted a bit.  The only thing that lacked was the background of how most of the characters were like in High School.  This is one movie I would watch over again.",1354233600,,449,4.385542168674699

8538458,4,B009AJB0YM,"This is one of those movies that you should watch every so often, just to remind yourself that nobody's life is on track. I understand why people call this a boring movie, because it's fairly close to life - there's a lot of build up, but then not a whole lot happens, which I think is the point. I like this movie a lot.",1517788800,,321,4.03125
8538459,5,B009AJB0YM,"Enjoyable and I think resembles a typical reunion on a scale. There is always one who gets away, one you shared pivotal moments with, the douche that drinks too much, the girl who seems perfect until you find out the reality. great cast.",1516579200,,237,4.534883720930233
