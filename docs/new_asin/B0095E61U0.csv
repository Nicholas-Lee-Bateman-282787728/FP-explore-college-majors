5262706,5,B0095E61U0,"Hysteria provides a comical explanation of Medical, Mental Health, Sexuality and Invention!  I am an adult sexuality educator that shares the story of the evalution of sexual aids on a regular basis!  I found this movie to be extremely entertaining as well as educational, with a bit of a love story mixed in.  I would suggest that all women to watch this film. If you loved the movie and would like to learn more and have a great Night-In of fun with your girlfriends, visit my website:  [...] to schedule a party with me or another Consultant in your area!",1341187200,2,558,4.55
5262707,4,B0095E61U0,"We see how the first mechanical vibrator was invented in the name of medical science. This is a sly R-rated in-crowd joke that becomes semi-militant when it launches into what was done to women in the latter 1800s (pre-Suffragette). If they were unhappy with their lives they were deemed ""hysterical,"" sent to mental institutions, and if they had the temerity to object, were subjected to mandatory hysterectomies. This was before Lister's ideas about sanitation were widely accepted by the medical community, so this often was a death sentence.

That being said, let's focus on the sly humor:
  * Jonathan Pryce (""Very Annie Mary"") is Dr. Dalrymple, a charlatan who treats women suffering from hysteria through ""manipulation"" that results in ""paroxysms,"" after which the women are ""greatly relieved."" His waiting room is jammed with ""sufferers.""
  * Hugh Dancy (""Adam"") is Dr. Mortimer Granville, the physician who really DID develop the first vibrator, which remains the most popular ""sex toy"" in the world. After Dr. Dalrymple hires him, it's clear that our hero soon suffers from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, so he has to invent something! His treatment was for muscle aches, as masturbation was considered deviant.
  * Maggie Gyllenhaal (""Crazy Heart"") is Dr. Dalrymple's progressive daughter Charlotte; she runs a soup kitchen, teaches children to read (and wash their hands), and then to cap it off, passes out literature that promotes women's right to vote. Hussy!
  * Rupert Everett (""Wild Target"") has a blast as the tinkerer Edmund St. John-Smythe, Dr Granville's good friend and collaborator. Edmund is always struggling with one invention or another and is constantly trying to get that new-fangled gadget, the telephone, to work: ""Ahoy! Ahoy! Is anyone there?""
  * Felicity Jones (""Like Crazy"") is Dr. Dalrymple's other (perfect) daughter Emily: acquiescent, cultured, well-groomed and lovely.

Hugh Dancy always impresses me, as does Maggie Gyllenhaal, so I was happy to sign up to be notified when Amazon has this available.",1341014400,5,2035,5.285714285714286
5262708,1,B0095E61U0,"I'm embarrassed to say I lasted as long as 25 minutes into this film, which has nothing to recommend it besides the predictably infantile wow factor of watching a dried up old lady (the rest of this description has been censored by Amazon). Believe me, my description is far funnier and more titillating than the dramatization of it, which could compete with any frat house cartoon sex dream. The director's style, or absence of it, harks back about 60 years, sort of like TV in 1962; the color and cinematography is amazingly garish and awful, the story is random and virtually nonexistent, the acting shameful and workaday, the writing sophomoronic, dishonest, manipulative and sexist. I've seen pornographic films made with much higher production values, acting and writing. Who conceived of this crap? This film is an open insult to women masquerading as comedy - much as the Republican Party portrays women's troubles - as well as to medicine, to the Brits, and to history (it's based on some interesting ""facts"" in the medical treatment of sexuality). If it weren't such inconsequential, incompetent trash, it would be picketed. Please don't think I was offended by the content. It is the film's completely dishonest, titillating, pandering treatment of it that is offensive.",1339891200,12,1281,5.104761904761904
5262709,4,B0095E61U0,"""Hysteria"" (95 min.) brings the highly unlikely (but we are reminded at the beginning of the film that ""This movie is based on true events. Really."") story of a young doctor Dr. Mortimer Granville (played by Hugh Dancy) in London, 1880, who is struggling but eventually finds a job with Dr. Robert Dalrymple (played brillantly by Jonathan Pryce) who is treating women for the so-called hysteria disease, really a catch-all for any and all things supposedly wrong with women in those days. The treatment is nothing else but to touch these women's private parts until they reach ""paroxysmal convulsions"" (wink, wink). The young doctor along with his buddy eventually come up with a mechanical device, which became the vibrator (still the number one sex toy in the world today, we are reminded at the end of the movie).

But the movie in fact is much more about Granville's romantic interplay with the 2 daughters of Dalrymple, Emily (played by Felicity Jones), who is ""daddy's girl"" and to whom Granville gets engaged, and Charlotte (played by  Maggie Gyllenhaal), the ""rebel"" daughter who has set up a social center to help the poor. I don't want to give away much more from the plot, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Maggie Gyllenhall really shines in this movie. I couldn't help but think how much she reminded me of Diane Keaton in her late 70s performances (think Annie Hall). That aside, this movie is a pleasant romcom, nothing more, nothing less. And no, not an ""important movie"" about women's empowerment as some other reviews here (who obviously did not see the movie) are suggesting.",1339804800,62,1619,4.837545126353791
5262710,5,B0095E61U0,"Three years ago I screened for my Gender and Communication students the documentary ""The Passion and the Power,"" which is a serious history on the development and use of the vibrator.  Before screening the film I asked students to leave
if they found the subject matter objectionable.  None left.

  Subsequently, five students filed complaints (which, incidentally, were typed by the chair--not the students themselves) and incorporated in a complaint against me for having been egregiously unprofessional.  Now mind you, this is material clearly pertinent to women's sexuality, which is a topic clearly within the purview of gender studies.  Still, these complaints found traction sufficient to suffer me three years of disciplinary action (an embarrassing investigation, no opportunity to teach, and the threat of six months of unpaid leave).  Thus, the first viewer above is absolutely correct when he says that
conservatives (sex negative viewers) are likely to find ""Hysteria"" offensive.  Moreover, it is possible--perhaps even probable--that action of one sort or another will be taken against the purveyors of such ""filth.""

  Incidentally, the complaints filed against me were at a state university where during that very same year a political science professor showed students explicit XXX photographs and erotica, for the purpose of delineating free speech boundaries. This is also a university where approximately six years ago two porno films were produced at one of our fraternities.

  In sum, this is an important film if for no other reason than it brings to light a procedure for treating a serious constellation of nonspecific, debilitating symptoms.  For the serious viewer, I also urge you to view the ""Passion and the Power"" and to read the fascinating book ""The Technology of Orgasm.""

5262711,5,B0095E61U0,"I've been teaching this stuff to college juniors & seniors for more than a decade, and they've been genuinely shocked to learn what educated people (in America, as well as in Europe) believed about human sexuality (male as well as female) only a century ago. I'm thrilled to see that this information has now been made so entertainingly accessible to the general public.  If people don't know what ridiculous ideas were accepted as truth in the past, how can they even begin to understand how far we've come today--or even glimpse how far we have yet to go. Women's sexuality, and their right to control their own bodies, is still a vexed question in the minds of too many male ""experts."" (Witness the recent treatment of Sandra Fluke before Congress, and the outrageous attitudes voiced by Rush Limbaugh in his followup). For those who want to learn more facts about the history recounted in this film, I recommend that you read Rachel Maines wonderful book _The Technology of Orgasm: ""Hysteria,"" the Vibrator & Women's Sexual Satisfaction_ (Johns Hopkins Univ Press, 1998; pap. 2001) --available through Amazon.com (of course!)",1339632000,24,1129,5.00531914893617

Loved Maggie Gylllenhal's character who, accustomed to dealing with the lower class women of the day, had no time for the epidemic and advised that all the women really needed was.. um you know, good sex.  Johnathan Pryce was wonderful, keeping a straight face amidst the rising tension and Hugh Dancy too perfect as the young doctor learning how to treat the issue and bemoaning his aching hand.

I have to admit I got really excited to watch a movie about vibrators set in Victorian England. What a great premise! Especially with Maggie Gyllenhaal, whose presence in a cast nearly guarantees its quality, in my opinion. Unfortunately, despite some stellar acting and a few fun bits here and there, the movie was slow, not very funny, and worst of all--I didn't like the main character played by Hugh Dancy--Mortimer something, can't remember now. He was stuffy and annoying and although he came around in the end, it wasn't enough to redeem him in my eyes. I also didn't sense much chemistry from him toward the Maggie character (I could sense it from her though). I guess he's supposed to be falling for her character and not so much physically, as it is Victorian England, but...come on...he's an expert at giving women orgasms, one might think he could muster up a bit of his showing his own sexual tension.

I feel like more could have been done with such a fun premise, but the line between campy cheese and subtle good humor being so fine, it seems the director opted to be safe.",1474243200,,1302,4.512711864406779

5262815,4,B0095E61U0,"The story starts when our protagonist, a physician, is fired for washing his hands and demanding cleanliness.  Sadly this is a true part of history and was resisted many MDs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Its acceptance resulted in the greatest advance in saving lives in the last few thousand years.  Anyhow, that's not the story.  That is reserved for another great advance for the betterment of humanity - the invention of the  vibrator.  This, plus the usual romance comedy ingredients make this an enjoyable entertainment.

The vibrator was created as a treatment for hysteria, a disorder of women that is no longer included in the dictionary of behavioral disorders.  Treatment was administered by digital manipulation.  The occupational hazard to physicians of the treatment was carpal tunnel syndrome.  The invention of the mechanical device revolutionized the treatment and facilitated self treatment by affected ladies, renering this branch of medicine archaic.

A whimsical look at how Dr. Mortimer Granville devised the invention of the first vibrator in the name of medical science.

What did I think?

Its true doctors used to diagnose Hysteria as a catch-all for women in the 19th century and true that sometimes manual manipulation of the vulva was prescribed as a treatment, so why not make a romantic comedy about it? 0_o Hysteria takes liberties with history but never pretends to be anything but playful so its easy to forgive especially in the light of the performances of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Rupert Everett.

5262855,4,B0095E61U0,"No question medical science like all great progressive movements got moving along through fits and starts. It was not all that long ago (in human history terms) that soap, simple soap, could help keep up hygiene and sickness away, including keeping hands clean on the operating table. Nor was it all that long ago that bleeding the body with leeches was the cure-all for many ailments. So medicine has truly moved in a jagged path. Take for instance the subject of the film under review, Hysteria, what in Victorian times was labelled female hysteria, you know when no one used the s-x word to discuss anything, when women, women of means anyway went to doctors, reputable doctors to have what ailed them fixed. And what ailed them was sexual frustration brought on by everything from dissatisfaction in bed with her bedmate to problems with menopause.

Now that medical treatment required time, energy and money and so like lots of things in this wicked old world an invention, the vibrator, got discovered almost by accident to, ah, privatize the treatment. Make treatment more widely available and cheaper. The films story-line goes along showing how the discovery was made by Doctor Granville (played by Hugh Dancy) after he had been so overworked using the old massage, proper massage with cover method of inducing orgasms on the medical table, and how the vibrator became the new next best thing and made the inventors and manufacturers rich. And assuredly many women happy.

Of course a straight forward account of that invention would be, well, pretty boring on its face if it was just a matter of developing a new therapy rather than some porno worthy sex toy. The real story line, the boy meets girl story line that drives a lot of films like this is  the coy budding romance between the good doctor and his doctor- employers older daughter, Charlotte (played by fetching Maggie Gyllenhaal), a modern day feminist who drives him crazy but who in the end proves that he is worthy of her, is worthy of being her husband and letting the better angel of his nature emerge. Of course that boy meets girl invention has been going on for a long time and the status of the medical profession at any given time has been unable to provide a treatment to ease matters of the heart. Enough said.",1421712000,,2293,4.756281407035176

the romantic subplot provides a pretext to contrast the upper crust female desire to achieve ""deep relaxation"" with the lower class mother's anxiety to care for her sick children. which type of patient will the young doctor choose to serve? since romance with a young woman is at stake, and a patriarchal tussle for independence with the young woman's father, we're never in much doubt of the outcome. the female director handles the sexual conflicts and class differences with a gentle but not trivializing touch, and all the actors consummate the dramatic resolution in exquisite style. it's fun, it's charming, it's educational -- it's even wholesome.",1404518400,,1076,5.113636363636363

5262905,4,B0095E61U0,"""Hysteria"" is a cute movie about the invention of the first portable massagers in (amazingly enough) Victorian England of the 1880's.  The devices were used to treat a chronic nervous condition in women labeled ""Hysteria"", because any frustration- both sexual and social- that women were experiencing was their own fault, of course, and had nothing to do with the repression of the time or their clueless, unskilled husbands.

Happily, as this light, amiable film progresses, many of the males in the film (including  some medical professionals, thankfully) eventually open their minds and see their own roles in the fairer sex's frustrations, eventually causing the electric massager- or ""vibrator""- to be viewed more as a benign device for pleasure rather a tool to battle a non-existent medical condition.  Conveniently, this is soon followed by the devices being sold directly to eager consumers, who no longer had to schedule a doctor visit to experience their benefits!

In addition to the fascinating subject matter, the film also delivers good performances, nice scenery and costumes, and a cute little romance that isn't as shoehorned into the movie as much as you think it might be.  Simultaneously naughty and oh-so-proper, the unconventional ""Hysteria"" would be a good choice if you're in the mood for something a little different than the usual home-viewing fare. The standard DVD that I watched had sharp picture and sound, though the only extra feature was the film's theatrical trailer.",1398816000,,1502,5.2635983263598325

I have to say that ""The Secretary"" is one of the most original and off the wall movies I have ever experienced, so the topic for this movie is far more conventional covering the development of the vibrator to help neglected women, to partially fulfill their sexual need.

When I read the description of this move, after having seen ""The Secretary"" I expected Maggi's character to be directly involved in the development of the vibrator as a tool for pleasure, but that was not the case!

Equally rewarding to me is the fact that in this movie her most wonderful character was instead passionately involved with taking care of the needy, and doing everything in her power to work for needed changes in the medical treatment field.

5262938,4,B0095E61U0,"Set in 1880, London, Tanya Wexler's ""Hysteria"" follows the story of Dr. Joseph Mortimer Granville (Hugh Dancy), a young and idealistic physician recently hired by Dr. Robert Dalrymple (Jonathan Pryce) as an assistant. His new job involves ""medicinal massage"" for the women suffering from the symptom then commonly known as ""hysteria."" If you don't know what I am talking about, well, Dr. Granville is the man who patented the first electric vibrator.

Despite its unique source material and late Victorian backdrop, ""Hysteria"" is first and foremost a romantic comedy about three likeable characters: Dr. Granville and Dr. Dalrymple's two daughters, free-spirited Charlotte (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and obedient Emily (Felicity Jones). Such social and cultural movements as women's suffrage and telephone are mentioned but not explored.

So which will the young doctor choose Emily (practicing phrenology) or Charlotte (riding a bicycle)? The story itself is a familiar one. It is not bad, just serviceable. But obviously the film is in need of a better story that can incorporate the interesting episode of first electric vibrator (that was, according to the film, originally invented for overtaxed physicians to treat their patients more speedily) into the romantic comedy storyline.

The result is a fairly entertaining, if sometimes a bit awkward, romantic comedy free from preachy messages. The story is slick, if not told in a historically informative way, and with all these players who have turned in delightful performances, especially Rupert Everett and Sheridan Smith, ""Hysteria"" is a pleasant and amusing comedy.",1370563200,,1618,5.516129032258065

5262948,4,B0095E61U0,"Set in Victorian London we meet idealistic Doctor Morton Granville (Hugh Dancy `Black Hawk Down' and `King Arthur') who has worked in most of London's hospitals, all in the last year. As his progressive attitudes to medicine often sets him at odds with some of less far sighted colleagues, still using their leeches and amputation methods. Well in a desperate attempt to put food on the table he approaches Dr. Robert Dalrymple (Jonathan Pryce) who treats exclusively women of means who all suffer from 'hysteria', that is that they have been diagnosed with having a problematic womb, which means it needs constant attention through medically administered frottage in order to stop them going mental.

Whilst this seems a bit daft, it was actually believed that `hysteria' that was too far gone would only be cured by a hysterectomy - and now you can see where the word comes from.  Anyway soon young Dr Granville is doing so well he develops `pleaseurers hand', that is cramp and has to be let go by Dr Dalrymple. This is a double blow as he had sort of fallen for the younger daughter and also was somewhat bemused by the older Charlotte (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who has incurred her father's displeasure by working with the lower orders - the shame of it. All is not lost as Morton's bestest friend Edmund St. John-Smythe (Rupert Everett) is an inventor and before you can say `change the batteries' they have stumbled across a vibrating thing that works as good as a hand or more so if you up the voltage.

This is a Victorian rom com with electrical stimulus. It is really funny in places, Hugh Dancy out does Colin Firth a couple of times and there was a real chemistry between him and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Pryce is always good value - except where he does a duff accent like his Irish one in `Ronin'. Everett just plays himself with different clothes on and so manages to pull it off nicely too. The settings and period detail are all spot on too as you would expect; its 99 minutes long so perfectly timed and you don't have to think, hardly at all. I thought this was a great little film, based on the real inventor and as ever  it is better for it.

The premise of wacky medical beliefs of the time mixed with Victorian prudery are smile inducing but the charm comes from the cast.  Nothing really new or earthshaking but a good 'cozy-up' on the couch with your significant other and a glass of wine.",1365811200,,445,4.842105263157895
5262951,3,B0095E61U0,"I had some idea of what this movie is about (the introduction of the mechanical vibrator) but had to pause the movie for a minute to wrap my head around the idea of 19th century medical doctors masterbating horny (technical term - hysteria) British housewives.  While that idea may bring titillating images, the ""patients"" remain clothed as Dr. Dalrymple (Jonathan Pryce) applies his deft touch.

Overwhelmed with women seeking medical ""relief"" Dalrymple hires a young Dr. Granville (Hugh Dancy).  While this isn't Granville's idea of true medicine, he's enticed by Dalrymple's daughters and the fact that he needs a job.  Emily (Felicity Jones) is her father's clear favorite.  Like her father, she's prim and proper.  On the other hand, Charlotte (excellent Maggie Gyllenhaal) both older and more independent, causes grief for both her father and ultimately Granville.

Granville's best friend, Edmund (Rupert Everett) is a constant tinkerer and inventor.  After weeks of use, Granville's right hand is showing wear and tear.  He tried using the left but it left the ladies uncured.  He starts to play around with a motorized feather duster Edmund had put together and with a few modifications tries it out on Dalrymple's maid, a former prostitute.  The rest is history.  Now a wealthy man, Granville is able to pursue his goal of practicing real modern medicine and goes after Charlotte, who he sees as a romantic and business partner.

Directed by Tanya Wexler, the film is surprisingly reserved, given the ""R"" rating and the subject matter.  I suspect, the idea was to make it more humor-laden but it rarely works.  The actors do their jobs in fine fashion.  Gyllenhaal in particular is very effective as the aristocratic black sheep (supports the working class) and wields her British accent perfectly.

Set at the end of the 19th century and the epidemic of what they called Hysteria. Every malady fit in with their description of the manifestation of symptoms of this dreaded disease that strangely only affected women. The only relief that could be found was to massage their nether parts until they had what one doctor in the show called ""paroxysmal convulsions"". The show is loaded with sexual innuendo and showcases the ignorance they had regarding sex and women. One doctor declares that it was known that the femal sex organ was incapable of feeling any pleasure and thus treatment wasn't considered masterbation but simply therapy. It is a fun love story and considering the overall theme of the show, well, what's not to like?

I initially went into this movie feeling hopeful. I mean, after all, a movie about a man who invents the vibrator in Victorian London - you'd expect it to be a quirky, off-beat movie that inspires. And you'd expect it to be smart. It was none of those things.

The plot was incredibly formulaic; Within 10 minutes, I knew exactly who would court whom, when they would break up, who would end up together in the end, and how it would all play out. I kept hoping I was wrong, but every time this plot had an opportunity to do something interesting, it took the cheap way out.

If you liked ""Letters to Juliet,"" then this movie is for you. But if, on the other hand, you actually expect the main characters to build up a romance throughout the entire plot (and not just throw it together at the end), have some real chemistry, and have a bond that seems even slightly believable, then you should rent or buy some other movie.

In spite of some beautiful sets and cinematography, a lack-luster script with some genuine humor and not-so-veiled innuendoes (""Do parsnips go well with fish, Doctor?""), transforms a talented cast into two-dimensional characters. The plot formula used has been so well trodden that the viewer will know the basic outcome before the film is halfway through. Apart from a few guilty chuckles and some rolling of the eyes, ""Hysteria"" firmly entrenches itself as just an average English Art-House film.",1357948800,2,665,5.3428571428571425

5262991,5,B0095E61U0,"""Hysteria"" was hysterical!  What a delightful comedy.  I totally loved it.  It is ribald by nature of its subject matter.  The comedy is emphasized by the complete ignorance of male physicians about female physical experience and the prudish manners of the era.  Maggie Gyllenhaal seems atypical for a Victorian woman of the 1880's, but she's got such great spark and gusto that she serves the film well as she did in ""Don't Back Down.""  Hugh Dancy from ""Adam"" is such an unassuming but good-looking guy that he falls well into his part as the inventor of the vibrator.  Felicity Jones is so prim as Emily Dalrymple, that she is a perfect foil to Gyllenhaal's Charlotte, her character's sister.  The scenes where the doctors are bringing women to orgasm and terming it a ""medical treatment"" are hysterical, such as the opera singer hitting the high note as the electric powered vibrator proves its effectiveness.  Georgie Glen is delightful as the aging widow Mrs. Parsons who winds up with Jonathan Pryce's Dr. Dalrymple by the end of the film.  The DVD extras are also wonderful.  The interview sequence with Pryce, Dancy and director Tanya Wexler had me rolling in the aisles as they fielded wild questions about the film.  (I'll never think of a sandbag in quite the same way again!)  This film works incredibly well.

5263006,3,B0095E61U0,"HYSTERIA is a very light-weight and somewhat charming and humorous look at the development of the vibrator.  Just to be clear right from the start, although the movie is Rate R, there is no nudity and very little sexuality.  This movie barely rises to the level of titillating, much less erotic.  And to be fair, it is not TRYING to do this.

Set in London in 1880, we're introduced to a very backwards medical society, where germs are still a ""crazy theory.""  And most women's problems, whether true mental health issues or simply general dissatisfaction (sexual or otherwise) are chalked up to a diagnosis of Hysteria.  We're introduced to a clinic, run by Jonathan Pryce, which is devoted to a cure for hysteria that involves the manual stimulation of women.  The women who can afford this treatment are eagerly lining up for it...they are essentially paying to receive stimulation they are not receiving from their husbands.  Remember, this is a time when the idea of a woman being aroused without direct input from their husbands is not believed.  Women are subject to ""hysteria"" not sexual frustration.

Into this scene comes a charming young doctor (Hugh Dancy) whose good looks make the hysteria clinic even more popular.  And Dancy is introduced to Pryce's two daughters:  the seemingly proper and demur Felicity Jones and the rambunctious but charitable Maggie Gyllenhaal.  Not surprisingly in the least, he courts Jones but is drawn to Gyllenhaal.

Poor Dr. Dancy begins to suffer from carpel tunnel with all the work he's doing with his wrist.  But he happens to be close friends with Rupert Everett, a rich guy with time to tinker with inventions.  The two men turn Everett's electric feather-duster into an electric stimulator.  From this invention, more plot complexities develop, which I shall not spoil.

The movie's tone is that of light comedy, and the comedy is indeed light.  There are very few laugh out loud moments...this is a movie that generates smiles.  It is certainly harmless and good-natured.  The introduction of this new invention and the subsequent developments are certainly amusing.  On the other hand, we make no investment in the romance of the movie or even in the few moments of drama.  There is no heft to this film, no lasting impact.  It's a nice way to pass 99 minutes, and it's well designed, decorated and costumed.

None of the actors are at their best either, because no one is asked to really do anything significant.  Dancy is generically charming and befuddled.  Pryce pretty much plays the character he's always asked to.  The two ladies are quite generic, because the script doesn't give them anything truly meaty to work with.  Gyllenhaal has lots of energy, but it often feels unsupported by circumstance...such as the scene where we first meet her raving around her father's waiting room.  She comes across like a crazy person with no propriety, rather than a passionate young lady with strong beliefs.  Most amusing in this film is Everett, who gets far too little work these days.  This role more or less reminded me of his existence, and he is so droll and funny that I yearn to see him in a meatier role again.

HYSTERIA is amusing and thus, warrants a most modest recommendation.  But after writing this review, I will probably virtually forget all about it.  Certainly, don't let the subject matter fool you into thinking you're about to see something daring...far from it.  You couldn't ask for a more harmless movie about the invention of the vibrator.",1355875200,13,3516,4.890016920473773

5263026,4,B0095E61U0,"Who created the vibrator?

Perhaps this thought may have occurred to you once before?  Maybe not.

For the 2011 film ""Hysteria"", directed by Tanya Wexler (""Finding North"", ""Ball in the House"") and writers Stephen and Jonah Lisa Dyer, they explore the invention of the device.  But instead of presenting a film that you would imagine to be sexually naughty, they present the film to show how the invention of the device was due to how women's hysteria (nervousness, loss of appetite, stress, sexual desire) was treated back in the late 1800s.

Long ago, female hysteria was once-common medical diagnosis that dates back for hundreds and possibly thousands of years.  And the diagnosis and treatment for hundreds of years was through pelvic massage, rather the manual stimulation of the vulva by a doctor trained in producing of what was called ""hysterical paroxysm"".  It was realized later on that ""hysterical paroxysm"" would be better known as an ""orgasm"".

And one of those doctors who treated women was Dr. Joseph Mortimer Granville, the man, along with an inventor would go on to create the first electromechanical vibrator (which would be known as Granville's Hammer) in 1883.

With the film ""Hysteria"", while not entirely a factual biography of Granville's life, the film is based on a true story.

The British film would star Hugh Dancy (""Black Hawk Down"", ""King Arthur"", ""Confessions of a Shopaholic""), Maggie Gyllenhaal (""The Dark Knight"", ""Donnie Darko""), Jonathan Pryce (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, ""Brazil"", ""Tomorrow Never Dies""), Felicity Jones (""Like Crazy"", ""The Tempest""), Rupert Everett (""My Best Friend's Wedding"", ""Shrek"" films) and Ashley Jensen (""Ugly Betty"").

And now, ""Hysteria"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in Sept. 2012 courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics.

""Hysteria"" is set in the 19th Century, during a time where women were treated for their hysteria by massaging the vulva/genital area of a woman to produce a ""paroxysmal convulsion"" and among the men who specialized in it was Dr. Robert Dalrymple (portrayed by Jonathan Pryce).  Dr. Robert Dalrymple is a reputable man who has two daughters, the kind and proper Emily (portrayed by Felicity Jones) and her older sister, the rebellious Charlotte (portrayed by Maggie Gyllenhaal), a pre-modern feminist.

Robert needs another to help him in his practice, so he hires a young doctor named Dr. Mortimer Granville (portrayed by Hugh Dancy) and as Mortimer learns how to treat women through his training sessions observing Dr. Dalrymple, he starts to date Emily.

And as Dr. Granville becomes well-known for his work, the practice begins to gain a good following and more women start to come in.  But it also starts to affect Dr. Granville's hand muscles and women start to feel that he is not being affective in bringing out their paroxysmal convulsions.  It embarrasses Dr. Dalrymple to have his popular clients feeling unfulfilled, that he has to fire Dr. Granville.

Staying with his friend Lord Edmunt St. John-Smythe (portrayed by Rupert Everett), an inventor trying to perfect his invention, an electronic feather duster.  While holding it, he starts to realize how soothing it feels on his hand courtesy of its vibrations.  And then Dr. Granville comes up with an idea, how about using this invention to create a vibrator that can be used to create paroxysmal convulsions, so a doctor no longer needs to use his hand?

And sure enough, he tests the new invention on Molly the Lolly (portrayed by Sheridan Smith) and in a short amount of time, he is able to produce three paroxysmal convulsions.  Shocked by the success of the device, what if Dr. Granville can utilize the device on a woman for treatment of hysteria?

Meanwhile, problems develop between Dr. Robert Dalrymple and his rebellious daughter Charlotte.  And as the family tends to avoid her, Dr. Granville starts to see the good in her and starts to fall for her.  But what of his relationship with Emily?

VIDEO:

""Hysteria"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  First, I have to say that the costume design for this film is wonderful.  And watching this film in HD, definitely brings out the details of the Victorian style.  Closeups are well-detailed, skintones are natural, black levels nice and deep.  The film looks very good on Blu-ray and I detected no banding or artifact issues during my viewing of ""Hysteria"".

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Hysteria"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and is primarily a dialogue driven film.  Aside from one case where the testing of the vibrator uses up the electricity and you hear a pop, the majority of the film is dialogue and its musical soundtrack.  Both are crystal clear and there is some use of surround channels during scenes featuring a crowd.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Hindi.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I'm often curious about how things are invented, but when I saw the trailer for ""Hysteria"" and how it dealt with the invention of the vibrator, not only did it catch my eye, I was fascinated by the concept but also even more intrigued about how female hysteria was treated by doctors through genital massages to produce what would be know as an orgasm.

I never knew that there was such a medical disorder and that doctors were specially trained to handle such a thing.

And while the trailer may lead one to think that such a film would be naughty and doctors using such a practice for their own sexual desires, fortunately ""Hysteria"" is not that.  This was a longtime practice and belief that women had symptoms that can be alleviated by a pelvic massage and that a person can be alleviated of their stress, sexual desires, nervousness, muscle spasms via""hysterical paroxysm"" (or orgasm).

And I can see in a medical sense, how the vibrator would be an important device for doctors at that time, because so many women were being treated, these doctors would suffer muscular cramps on their hands because some women would not respond and have a hysterical paroxysm so easily.

So, that was all intriguing to me and the story based on the creation of the vibrator because of the treatment of hysteria was fascinating.  Granted, although based on a true story, I'm not sure if the life of Dr. Mortimer Granville was as exciting.  His life was surely romanticized for ""Hysteria"" and given much humor, the film was entertaining.  Especially to see how a feather duster would eventually lead to the vibrator is amusing and how its presented is quite fun and hilarious.

""Hysteria"" was no doubt an entertaining film thanks to its talents.  Hugh Dancy, Jonathan Pryce, Felicity Jones and Rupert Everett were great.  And as for Maggie Gyllenhaal, I was worried how she would portray an English accent but sure enough, she did a magnificent job.

As for the Blu-ray release of ""Hysteria"", while the picture quality and audio quality were very good, it's the inclusion of the documentary ""Passion & Power: The Technology of Orgasm"" that I found educational and entertaining.  I had no idea that treatment of hysteria has gone on so long and was recorded by physicians.  But the amount of research that went into making this documentary was fascinating and to see how the perception of vibrators have changed.  From being featured to magazines in the distant past to some states having strict rules for women (especially the state of Dallas) who has no law of how many guns a man can have, but yet a woman who has more than five vibrators is breaking the law.  Interesting!

Overall, ""Hysteria"" is a fascinating and fun film that shows people of a past that probably, many have forgotten or didn't know about.  But also how the invention of the vibrator came to be.  Fun, naughty and entertaining, ""Hysteria"" on Blu-ray is recommended.",1354320000,,8526,4.992204110559887

5263029,5,B0095E61U0,"I missed seeing this movie when it came out and having heard so many good reports and read so many good reviews that I had to purchase it and judge for myself.  This movie, I guess is not for everybody's taste but personally I really enjoyed it as it was definitely original both in story and script.  The actors well played their roles, the costuming was superb for the period and I found it all together entertaining as well as educational for the subject matter that it deals with.
The world of women has certainly changed so very much today and our predecessors in the women gender were so naive in those days that it did bring a smile to my face thinking about their situation and the reactions from such a device, BUT at the same time, if it was not for them and their 'hysteria', the then new invention, today's modern single women would not have the ability to possibly pleasure themselves, to put it nicely.  Let's face it, if electricity was not invented, we would all still be in the dark, so to speak.
I do recommend the purchase of this DVD from Amazon, as the price is right and the enjoyment equally entertaining, but again I stress this film would not be suitable for everybody.

Although I've seen better portrayals, ""Hysteria"" captures Victorian England quite well. This film is also genuinely funny at times if one has some appreciation for the bawdy (although there's no nudity). It's often said that comedy is most effective in dramatizing serious conflicts and situations; however, I was a little uncertain on where this was going and how to take it until the very end, where what we are told and shown makes sense of at least most of it. Still, the various disparate themes--early feminism, the fallacious catch-all diagnosis of female ""hysteria,"" and the history of the vibrator (?)--don't entirely tie together, and the whole film seems incomplete. It's also a little unclear on how factual or fictional certain details, such as the bit about the Queen herself, are supposed to be, and where the directors are trying to convey solid history and where they're just having fun.

Dont let the sensitive nature of it fool you, because theres more here than ladybits and pleasure toys. Just trust me on this one, mmk?

Set in the throes of a Victorian-era London, Dr. Mortimer Granville (Hugh Dancy) assists the ever-popular, Dr. Dalrymple, in treating women diagnosed with hysteria. With symptoms ranging from exhaustion and nervousness to cramps, depression and sexual frustration, just about every woman in London could be diagnosed with the malady! In an effort to find a better way to treat this ailment, Dr. Granville with a little help from his friend/benefactor, Edmund St. John-Smythe (Rupert Everett), invents the first vibrator. And yes, theres also a love story thrown in for good measure as Dr. Dalrymples two daughters (Maggie Gyllenhaal & Felicity Jones) battle to win Dr. Granvilles attention and affection.

Wexler was smart in her choice of casting, using underrated actors with a strong repertoire who could be funny without being kitschy. Gyllenhaal and Dancy had just the right amount of tension and chemistry needed to fuel their explosive onscreen relationship; Everett, as usual, pulled off class and charm with ease and Jones was prim and proper without falling into the category of stuffy. Gyllenhall was the total embodiment of female empowerment in this movie. See, women in 19th Century England suffered to no end and she fought to change all that, which is what I loved most about her. Though a bit extreme in her measures at times, she had passion and conviction. And that is why she stole the show. She was brilliant, simply brilliant.

To be frank, Hysteria caught me by surprise. Upon first glance, this movie was nothing like what I expected it to be and thats a good thing. Given the rather risqu subject matter, it had all the potential to go too far. These days its too easy venturing into crude territory using the gross-out humour to which weve become accustom. But Wexler didn't do that. Instead, she took the high road and produced a smart and clever rom-com with sensibility and heart at its very core. Make no mistake, on the surface Hysteria is about a certain pleasurable device but its also a story about progressive thinking, belief in change and love, and a funny one at that. The humour wasn't in-your-face or raunchy, instead Wexler settling on subtlety and wit. In the end, the characters facilitated change whether it be for themselves, the medical community or all of womenkind, and that folks, is a story I can jive to. More simply putI. LOVED. This. Film.

Food for Thought: I adored this movie and it makes me sad that more people haven't heard of it. Its one of those rare gems that pulls off a touchy (Im sorry, I had to do it) subject matter with both class and intelligence. While still being funny, Hysteria also manages to juggle some heavier topics without indignation or being too heavy handed (haha, get it).

Yet their ignorance in the field of medicine led them to practice a behavior that in today's society would be criminal. Moral behavior for a woman was expected. However, your doctor could bring you to a pleasurable experience and nothing would be thought wrong of it. Honestly, you have to see the humor in it all. Do women today visit their doctors to be stimulated for pleasure? He'd lose his license and probably end up behind bars. But here we are in the Victorian age, and doctors are actually bringing scores of women to a blissful experience, all in the name of medical treatment. The invention of the vibrator takes it even farther that a device was made to aid treatment at home. I see nothing morally wrong in the movie or disgusting. It's a historical fact that women had their uterus or ovaries removed to ""calm them down"" when treatment didn't work. Men wanted docile females in those days, but over half the population was filled with starved females instead.

5263052,4,B0095E61U0,"According to Wikipedia, doctors have been treating women for centuries for a wide variety of illnesses by performing ""pelvic massage"" or stimulation. Such practice was especially common in the treatment of female ""hysteria"" during the Victorian Era, as the point of such manipulation was to cause ""hysterical paroxysm"" in the patient. Not regarded as sexual in nature, the ailment was rampart and common and its treatment was time-consuming and hard work.

One of the first vibrators was a steam-powered device called the ""Manipulator,"" which was created by American physician George Taylor. This machine was a rather awkward device, but was still heralded as some relief for the doctors who found themselves suffering from fatigued wrists and hands. Circa 1880, Dr. Joseph Mortimer Granville of London patented the first electromechanical vibrator. HYSTERIA, the film being reviewed, is the story of Dr. Granville's useful little device...with a few fictional flourishes.

Although HYSTERIA is a farcical Victorian drama about the invention of the ""naughty"" vibrator....the movie is well portrayed.  Maggie Gyllenhaal and Hugh Darcy are the main characters dressed in proper Victorian garb spouting witty repartee. And there's additionally talented cast.

When a society doctor named Dalyrumple (Jonathan Pryce) has an overflow of patients for treatment of ""hysteria,"" he engages an assistant (Hugh Darcy), an idealist young doctor named Joseph Mortimer Granville. Granville helps examine and treat female patients who lie on velvet-draped examining tables almost fully dressed wearing their hats.  (Some of the patients have cameo appearances and speeches in the film which are hysterical...pun intended.) Unfortunately, IYD sooner or later gets disabling cramps in his right hand...and his left hand is inadequate and useless.  After his dismissal, he discovers that his whacky roommate (Rupert Everett), who dabbles with electricity, has put together an electric feather duster.  The two fellows conspire, modify a feather duster, and patent the world's first electromechanical vibrator.

Meanwhile, Dr Dalyrumple's free-spirited daughter (Gyllenhaal), who runs a tenement clinic and school in the slums of London, lands in jail for whacking a policeman on his head.  Dr. D. calls upon his former protege to provide witness at his daughter's trial: seems the only way to save her from jail for petty crime in those days is to diagnosis her with hysteria...and have her committed to an asylum for a hysterectomy... But young Dr. Mortimer has made a pile of money in royalties for his invention so he uses his money and influence to prevent pretty daughter from jail and a hysterectomy...

Campy, campy...fun, fun...with a happily-ever-after ending!

5263058,5,B0095E61U0,"I saw this differently from the first 32 reviewers. For me it was a light comedy, reasonably well done in that respect, about the history of medicine as late as the late 1800s. This theme was all over the place and square in your face. The only way to miss it was to focus on the vibrator part. In this respect, in getting history of medicine ideas across without being boring or overly serious, it was terrific.

This was a transition time for long struggles in medicine as well as women's rights.

This late in history it was still a fight to get doctors even to wash their hands and think about sanitary conditions. They were still using leeches to let blood. There were old fashioned medical ideas still very much in normal practice. The older doctor was encouraging his daughter to study phrenology and they called this science. The scientific and medical communities today are still trying to understand the realities of human sexuality, but back then the theories were absolutely absurd and discussion was even more difficult. And people's lives, including their sex lives, were being directed and controlled by the expert-informed society on the basis of absurd theories. The film is almost text-book on these facts. Yet it is a pleasant and entertaining film that viewers even without a sense of history should be able to enjoy. So I say three cheers and five stars.

I was really glad for the extra features because they did provide a starting point for anyone who wants to do some reading and study on the issue of the vibrator and the lack of understanding of female sexuality then, and of course somewhat even today. I would suggest though that this should only be regarded as a start. I know a lot about this topic but there were a few facts presented in the special features that I would like to check out to verify, and anyone should. This is actually a big topic with lots of angles. If the film was an eye-opener for you, then the special features will be too. Then I suggest follow this up with some reading.

5263072,3,B0095E61U0,". . . or just hand him a machine--which is the premise behind the  otherwise formulaic 2012 romantic comedy, ""Hysteria,"" directed by Tanya Wexler.  Strip this story of its vibrator and for the most part, the audience can expect the usual boy meets girl scenario with the traditional outcome albeit in this case with some seemingly unrealistic situations emphasized in their preposterousness to titillate a supposedly more modern audience already in the know with regard to that panacea to stave off civilization's most dehabilitating setback: ennui.

Stephen Dyer and Jonah Lisa Dyer's screenplay is loosely based on the historical fact that Dr. Joseph Mortimer Granville patented the first electromagnetic vibrator in 1880 as a handy-dandy tool designed to help fellow doctors better administer relaxing ""pelvic massage"" to their female patient's suffering from ""hysteria"" or ""melancholia.""  This approach as a solution to women's `ailments' as explored in various formats in other films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Dangerous-Method/dp/B007OUINLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Dangerous Method</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crimson-Petal-The-White/dp/B0074FUSFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crimson Petal & The White</a>"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vertigo/dp/B000ICXQG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vertigo</a>,"" suggests the inherent dominance of a male-centric world.  In all three of these examples, the woman in question (Sabina, Agnes and Madeline/Judy) must undergo some sort of revelatory situation in which the man in her life helps her to understand that whatever she is experiencing is only a dream, a fantasy or a projection.  By ""seeing"" this, she submits to the power of the man and his projection of what reality actually is, as he, as master of his universe, defines it.  While ""Hysteria"" handles this premise a bit more humorously, the bottom line is still one and the same.  Without the testimony of the good doctor towards the end of the film, our pre-1960s feminist, embodied by the character of Charlotte Dalrymple (Maggie Gyllenhaal), would still be subjected to imprisonment, psychological evaluation and hysterectomy/sterilization.  Today's solution?  Perhaps, a variety of pharmaceuticals?

Wexler's film asks its viewer to look at a frankly disturbing subject--the inability of many people to fit within the format of their own carefully crafted cages and the body, mind and spirit's reaction to a self-imposed trap that prevents any growth--and laughingly intuit that the solution lies in the release from manual stimulation as provided by a machine.

That, in itself, is cutsy-funny.  And that's the way this film should be viewed--as a spoof where dozens of women line up every day outside a doctor's office to undergo ""treatment"" and because they do not really know what they are experiencing continue to return for the same ""quickie"" fix.  When Dr. Granville (Hugh Darcy) who would have been played with more angelic chagrin by Hugh Grant, finds his hands cramping during his therapies, he and his inventor friend St. John-Smythe (Rupert Everett) devise a mechanized version with the beginnings of that mythical `staying power' that Samantha Jones of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City-The-Complete-Series-Collector-s-Gift-Set/dp/B0011UBDTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City: The Complete Series (Collector's Gift Set)</a>&nbsp;will appreciate more than a century later.  Almost pathetically, the patients are so happy they burst out into song and not-so-knowing smiles of pure bliss.  Sad to think that that's all it takes.

In ""Hysteria,"" Granville works as apprentice to Dr. Dalrymple (played with austere pomposity by Jonathan Price) and as a most suitable helper with much potential to feather Dalrymple's retirement nest with much plumage, he is quickly viewed as a worthy suitor to Dalrymple's conventional daughter, Emily (Felicity Jone--that is, until in true&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holiday/dp/B000ION7AI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holiday</a>&nbsp;fashion (Cary Grant cannot help his attraction to non-conformist sister Katherine Hepburn), he butts heads with not-so-sweet, but dedicated, Charlotte.  Of course, the audience is fully aware that this switch will happen.  Unfortunately, the means by which it occurs asks for another suspension of what we know to be real to ensure that inevitable frothy ending where the couple lives happily ever after.  I can only wonder what their intimate life would have been like:) - perhaps a Dickensian&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fifty-Shades-Trilogy-Fifty-Shades-of-Grey-Fifty-Shades-Darker-Fifty-Shades-Freed-3-volume-Boxed-Set/dp/034580404X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set</a>?

Bottom line?  ""Hysteria"" tries to be hysterically amusing.  It has its moments; however, for the most part, its ebb into the familiar territory of boy meets feisty girl and its dependence on some pretty farcical situations in the doctor's surgery make this Victorian's Secret one to watch while you multitask.

5263075,3,B0095E61U0,"The subject of ""Hysteria"" is the peculiar relationship that Victorians had with their bodies.  As the film reveals, only a hundred fifty years ago medical professionals were divided as to whether diseases were created by germs, poor sanitation, or perhaps, ""bad air"".  Phrenology (reading health by the shape of bumps on the head) was in vogue.  Hysteria was a diagnosis given to women, so-called because it was thought to be seated in the womb.  Hypochondria was a separate condition originating in the solar plexus.

Now, in 2011 we had two movies with titles relating to Victorian maladies, this one and ""Melancholia"".  Neither movie succeeded particularly well.

""Hysteria"" reminded me quite a lot of ""The Road to Wellville"" (T. Coraghessan Boyle's creation), which was set in a spa run by the namesake of the Kellogg's Cereal dynasty.  Like ""Road..."", ""Hysteria"" is a farcical look at body functions and social mores.

""Hysteria"" suffers from a believability deficit.  The movie asks you to believe that crowds of Victorian women would queue up to have themselves fondled intimately by their doctor.  Then it asks you to believe that an earnest young doctor would tear himself away from a hospital in order to give himself carpal tunnel syndrome as a partner in a 'fondling saloon'.

I couldn't bring myself to accept that Victorians (particularly Victorian women) were anywhere close to being either so liberated or so frivolous. (SEE NOTE BELOW)

The serious elements of the story, concerning Maggie Gyllenhaal's character and her crusades on behalf of the powerless, and her budding romance with the young doctor, were very arresting.  In fact, Gyllenhaal's performance as a sort of Florence Nightengale (echoing similar roles played by Emma Thompson) nearly saved the movie.  But at the end of viewing it, my only thought was that the actual story of the invention of the vibrator, unburdened by the silliness, might have been far more interesting than ""Hysteria"".

Maybe next they can do a comedy about the 1950's, Wilhelm Reich and the ""orgone box"".

NOTE:  Look at what physicians deal with today... they have to keep nurses in their offices in order to safeguard against claims of abuse.  Physicians must avoid the slightest perception that they are touching their patients improperly.  So, in regards to this movie... we viewers are supposed to believe that there was LESS opprobrium regarding impropriety and that females were LESS suspicious of male doctors and less protective of their privacy in Victorian times??

5263077,4,B0095E61U0,"When, some time ago, I'd heard that Maggie Gyllenhaal was making a movie about the invention of the vibrator, I was excited. I mean, I love Maggie and I love vibrators so what more could I ask for in the way of entertainment? But time went by and I heard nothing about it. I'd almost forgotten it completely when, checking out the new offerings on Amazon (because as I've told you repeatedly for months now, NETFLIX SUCKS), there it was! Yippee!

I had fresh coffee, a French toast bagel with honey walnut cream cheese and a movie about vibrators. A near-perfect Saturday morning.

Honestly, I expected the movie to be interesting, perhaps even enlightening in an indie film kinda way, considered that it apparently got so little press I wasn't even aware it had opened. But what i got was a delighful little movie that had me chuckling and laughing out loud. Considering the subject, it gives the term ""a feel-good movie"" a whole new meaning.

Even better, the basic facts of the movie are true.

In England of the 1890's -- the height of Victorian prudery, where furniture was draped with heavy fabric to prevent the scandalous sight of carved table ""legs"" giving rise to lascivious thoughts -- the average doctor killed more patients than he saved. Medicine was still medieval, and leeching was still being prescribed even for broken bones.

Mortimer Granville, a young doctor who eagerly embraces all the cutting-edge research of the day, finds himself discharged from one hospital after another for his strange new ideas about ""germs"" and hand washing. In desperation, he ends up at the door of Dr. Dalrymple, who is eager for help in his thriving and lucrative practice treating ""female hysteria.""

Hysteria, an affliction of the female nervous system thought to stem from a disorder of the uterus, was at the time the catch-all diagnosis for just about every female ailment, particularly melancholia, nervousness, frigidity, nymphomania and excitability. What we realize now, of course, was that these women were actually suffering -- and often quite seriously -- from the sheer frustration of the limited, tedious and repressed lives they were forced to live.

A well-bred young woman had no choice but to marry a man she barely knew, submit to his ""carnal lusts"" with no preparation or expectation of pleasure, run his household, bear his children and do it all while smiling, biting her tongue and wearing a corset. Who wouldn't be depressed, frustrated and, yes, hysterical?

In extreme cases, hysterectomies were performed to remove the ""offending"" organs. Which says a lot about the complete and utter bigoted ignorance of men in understanding and valuing women's lives and bodies.

It should be noted that only well-to-do women suffered from hysteria. Poor women were too busy simply trying to survive, and barely had access to medical treatment for life-threatening emergencies.

Dr. Dalrymple -- superbly played by Jonathan Pryce -- specializes in the treatment of hysteria through ""medicinal massage"" to ""lessen the tensions in the womb."" With complete sincerity, he explains to Granville (played by Hugh Dancy) that his patients experience ""paroxysms"" -- not to be confused with sexual pleasure, which women are of course incapable of experiencing without masculine penetration.

Granville becomes the doctor's assistant, and is soon suffering intense carpel tunnel and muscle cramps from the prolonged daily ""massage"" of dozens of women. When idly playing with his friend's new invention -- an electric duster -- he notices the vibrations bring amazing relief to his near-crippled hand.

Which leads to a moment of spectacular genius for which I am eternally grateful.

There's a love story, too, but it dovetails nicely with the theme of the movie, which is about women taking control of their lives. Maggie plays Dr. Dalrymple's ""other"" daughter, a passionate suffragette and doer of good works in the poorest parts of London. She sparkles. I think this may be my favorite role for her.

So, let's give a hand (metaphorically speaking) to Dr. Mortimer Granville, the inventor of the vibrator! Perhaps we should all celebrate a ""paroxysm"" in his honor.

Seriously, check out this very funny and enjoyable movie. If it sounds ""risqu"" it's really not. There's no nudity, no bad language, and only one kiss in the whole movie. It was actually amazing that they could deal with the subject matter in such a Victorian way. One reviewer has expressed his disgust at watching an ""old dried up woman"" experiencing pleasure in a completely demure and ladylike way. You'd have to be a serious prude or a sexist, ageist grump to characterize the scene in such a dismissive way. Maybe the more conservative of you might not want to watch it with your parents or children, but my mom would laugh right along with me.",1348272000,56,4823,5.026315789473684

Based on the original story by Howard Gensler and adapted for the screen by Stephen Dyer and Jonah Lisa Dyer  HYSTERIA addresses women's rights and women's needs in Victorian England.  As a bit of history it is essential knowledge: as a film it is supremely entertaining!

In the1880s (Victorian period) London, Dr. Mortimer Granville (Hugh Dancy) is an idealistic young doctor fresh out of training struggles against staid old-fashioned physicians who refuse to keep up with science to establish himself. Nearing the end of his rope he is hired by Dr. Robert Dalrymple (Jonathan Pryce) who is renowned for treating women diagnosed with female hysteria using 'pelvic massage'.  (`Hysteria' was originally defined as a neurotic condition peculiar to women and thought to be caused by a dysfunction of the uterus!'). By the 19th century, hysteria came to be defined as a more generalized sexual dysfunction. Dr. Granville sets about becoming an expert in the problem, seeking devices to remedy the problem. However, he develops carpal tunnel due to all the manual labor required in stimulation. His invention is the vibrator! In the midst of the story we meet Dr. Dalrymple's two daughters - the renegade, women's rights devotee, idealistic and compassionate Charlotte (Maggie Gyllenhaal) whose work with the poor house patients angers her father, and the talented and charming demure Emily (Felicity Jones) who the father sees as the proper physician's wife. It is the coming together of Dr. Granville's invention (originally the concept of his wealthy friend Edmund St. John-Smythe - Rupert Everett) and Charlotte's outlook on life that brings the cast of characters and story to a satisfying close.

Tanya Wexler directs this excellent cast with just the right amount of `suggestion' and British humor, and offers the entire cast the opportunity to create wholly credible characters. Perhaps 20-30 years ago this film would have been considered daring, but at this point in our cinematic history it seems rather tame!  Grady Harp, September 12",1348012800,,2234,5.226256983240224
5263081,4,B0095E61U0,"A deliciously fun treatment based (loosely) on the true story of the invention of the personal vibrator.

Dr. Mortimer Granville, a young, inspiring doctor is fired from many jobs in London hospitals due to his firm belief in Germ Theory - the idea that infections were caused by germs. Not being a popular theory at the time, he was terminated repeatedly by the ""solid Victorian medical foundation"" for believing in ""quackery.""

The only job he can find is with a private practice that prevalently deals with women in the grips of ""Hysteria"" - a quaint, Victorian term for women that are in essence, sex-starved. The treatment? To manually stimulate women with hand massaging until orgasm, thereby relieving the tension and associated emotional stress that comes with the condition. Since this is definitely a temporary relief, obviously the young and attractive doctor soon finds himself overrun with current and new patients leading to the development of a unique form of handstrain! Most certainly, alternative forms of stimulation for women need to be found to keep up.

Heaped on top is his employer, who with two daughters is pushing his ""proper"" one toward our protagonist for marriage, while the wild, wooly socially unacceptable daughter is the one who actually attracts him.

A comedic, fun historical piece that romps through the bedroom without being dirty or crass and handles delicate subjects beautifully without being dull or ""prim.""
