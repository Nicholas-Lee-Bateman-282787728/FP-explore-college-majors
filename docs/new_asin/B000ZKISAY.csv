8235907,4,B000ZKISAY,Some good tips and technique. I enjoyed watching the flow during the training sessions and found it motivational.  I liked the Roy Harris seminar and his philosophy about the sport.,1374364800,,181,5.033333333333333
8235908,5,B000ZKISAY,"I can tell you, everything on this DVD is interesting and cool. BUT, the Roy Harris seminar is worth the price of the DVD alone.  I learned so much about guard control from that segment.  Amazing DVD.",1312156800,2,200,4.378378378378378
8235909,5,B000ZKISAY,This DVD is different from other bjj DVDs. Its a nice change of pace from the basic instructional DVDs. I found his teaching and movements just a constant and beautiful flow. It was so good and inspiring that i will be buying all of his other dvds in the near future!,1281571200,,267,4.254901960784314
8235910,5,B000ZKISAY,"This is my most recent purchase of one of Roy Dean's DVDs. I wasn't sure I needed this one, since I believe I've purchased every one of his other DVDs. I've purchased many other BJJ DVDs by other people, as well as many other instructional DVDs on martial arts in general. And many of them are very good, even excellent.

What makes Roy Dean's DVDs different is Roy Dean.  I find myself mesmerized just watching him move.  It's like watching a beautiful and graceful dance.  He flows into and out of many different positions with such an incredible ease and fluidity.  And better yet, he teaches you (as he teaches his face to face students) how to do it too. You can see the same fluidity in many of his students.

Many BJJ DVDs by other people provide tactics to use in specific situations. Roy Dean's DVDs give you a more complete view of BJJ and a strategy for approaching it, along with critical concepts underlying the strategy. And there are details about specific tactics as well. I have a different understanding of BJJ now from watching his DVDs.

If you are at all interested in BJJ, at any level, this DVD, as with any of Roy Dean's other DVDs, is worth buying.  He has a wonderful approach toward learning and teaching BJJ.  He has a very interesting background.  And just watching him do what he does is inspirational.  If you're new to BJJ and trying to decide if it's really what you want to do, this and the other DVDs by Roy Dean may be just the thing to help you decide.

Maybe one day I'll get to visit Professor Dean's school in Bend, Oregon.  In the meantime, I will watch and rewatch these DVDs and learn as much as I can from them (in addition to my regular BJJ training).

On the surface this specific DVD seems to be just a collection of different unrelated BJJ seminars and other events.  But it's really more than that and I did pick up some very good technical tips from this DVD that added to what I've learned from Mr. Dean's other DVDs. The seminar by Professor Harris (Roy Dean's teacher) alone was worth the price of the DVD.  I took away several concepts from that seminar that I feel I can use in the long term; concepts that I have not seen elsewhere.  So I found this DVD a very worthwhile addition to my collection.

Highly recommended!",1277856000,3,2275,4.414868105515588
8235911,5,B000ZKISAY,"This outstanding production from Roy Dean is a great first release.

Roy Dean's Year One DVD gives an insight into his unique blend of Traditional Martial Arts aesthetic & community and the devastating effectiveness of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu training.

The seminars on the DVD are fantastic. Roy Dean's combination attacks from the guard position and Roy Harris' Open Guard control & passing counters could have each been their own DVD (though no quality is lost by placing them both on this disc).

Typically, when I watch a new grappling instructional, I look for one new idea that I can incorporate into my own training. From the Roy Harris segment alone, I picked up three ""I need to use these"" moves, and three more ""I need to add these when I am ready"" techniques...not to mention the new material I saw in Roy Dean's sections!

The extra features are great. The Purple Belt exam, tournament footage, and commercial all help build the great vibe that Roy Dean's teaching and school have. Pick up this DVD and see what his unique flow is all about!",1202342400,5,1050,4.752747252747253
8235912,5,B000ZKISAY,"Wow!  This DVD is awesome.  Better production quality than most every BJJ DVD on the market.  It has good instruction as well as a little something to get just about anyone inspired.  The Purple Belt test was truly great.  It really shows just how much blood, sweat, and tears goes into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  Honestly, if this video doesn't make you want to go out and join the nearest BJJ academy, nothing will.  In addition to the inspiration, it is also a great tool for those wishing to extend their training to their own home.  Do yourself a favor and pick this DVD up!  It definitely will not let you down.",1200355200,2,612,4.490909090909091
