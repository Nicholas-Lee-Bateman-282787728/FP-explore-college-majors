8360675,4,B002B55QMY,"Professor David Salt's guilty secrets draw him to the fabled Town of Villisca, past and present collide as he is driven to help the trapped spirits, and to seek his own redemption. Which is the brief description given at the IMDB.com website.  This is a fictional movie based on the infamous unsolved 1912 Villisca, IA. ax murder.  Professor Salt comes to town to settle his late wife's affairs in her former home town of Villisca and is drawn to the house.  The movie itself wasn't the greatest, very long, somewhat weak story at times.  Even the featurette lasts well over an hour. But take into consideration this movie was spearheaded by three girls from the Des Moines area aged 15 to 17 at the time.  It included over 80 speaking parts.  Quite an endeavor for a decent movie.  I had the pleasure of seeing this at it's premier at the Villisca Rialto Theater.  I recommend it whether you save money on the DVR version here or splurge with the official DVD with features at the hauntingvillisca.com website.",1469923200,,1011,4.672316384180791

8360679,1,B002B55QMY,"Folks
  I did not care for it at all.  I have read many articles on line

about Villisca and rewatched an excellent documentary on

the subject.  There is even an outstanding paper someone wrote

for their MA on line.  His thesis is that the killings were not even

done by anyone in the village but by a wandering ax killer roaming

throughout the MidWest.  It is well done and I think he solved

the horrible crime.  This work is like viewing the entire incident

through a piece of smoked glass....John Pain",1364169600,,510,4.461538461538462
8360680,1,B002B55QMY,This movie was boring to me and it was slow. I thought it would be better but it was a wast of my time with my wife. I could of watched a better movie with my wife.,1354665600,,164,3.4594594594594597
8360681,1,B002B55QMY,"I have been to Villisca, Iowa.  I took a tour of the house. I did not feel the house was haunted. However the man that played Darwin in the film is the real person who owns the house. He knows what he is talking about when he tells the story of the murders. I was looking forward to this film coming out. Darwin had told us about the making of the movie.
 I was disappointed in the movie I was hoping it was going to be about the events of that day and night of the murders. Not this made up story, what a shame. I hope someday, someone will tell the story of the axe murders in Villisca, Iowa and leave the haunting out of it!",1285372800,3,627,3.9291338582677167

8360683,5,B002B55QMY,"This is the best independent movie I've seen since ""Sling Blade"". A large cast of interesting characters, based on a true story, unsolved murders, courtroom drama, paranormal happenings and a wonderful soundtrack... this movie's got it all.",1261180800,4,240,5.513513513513513
