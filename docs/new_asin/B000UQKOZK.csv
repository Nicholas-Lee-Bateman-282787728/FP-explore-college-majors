Story had some major plot holes, unless I missed something. The main one being the main premise; If the fake emperor killed the empress, no one would dare to oppose the will of the emperor anyway, so why would a police investigation even be initiated?",1494806400,,466,4.614457831325301
8376791,4,B000UQKOZK,"Actually the true title of this movie is Tough Guy. It's also known as Duel at Tiger Village which too makes sense. The only reason I can see giving it the Iron Monkey title is to capitalize off of the success of said film. Make no mistake, the only similarities between the two is the lead actor obviously & maybe an actor or two in this. Even the directors are different with Pao Hsieh Li being behind the lens for the film. He's been co-director on many classics including Boxer From Shantung, Man of Iron, Delightful Forest & Water Margin just to name a few. He personally directed independent hits like Blooded Treasury Fight, Kung Fu Emperor & the Great Conspiracy.

This movie is about a police inspector by the name of Cool Head (Chen Kuan Tai) who is charged with investigating the murder of the emperor's wife. When a villager Lee San (Yan Chung Ching) is framed for the crime, it's up to Inspector Cool Head to dig deep into a bigger conspiracy going on while assisted by a trio of female vagabonds led by Chai Fung (Chia Ling). Also in this is Chen Sing as the fierce chamberlain Wu Tai & Shih Chung Tien as the emperor.

While the plot definitely had its twists & turns, I could never figure out the connection between those beggar girls & Lee San. But the action in this was pretty much non-stop & hardly any comedy was present other than Cool Head teasing Chai Fung here & there. Chen Kuan Tai does what he mostly always does: kick butt & take names. He was brilliant as the inspector & his kung fu was top notch! Chia Ling held her own as well. The other standout was Chen Sing who usually delivers & does so here. The bottom line is if you view this as just another Chen Kuan Tai vehicle then it's pretty good but cannot to be compared to his more superior work Iron Monkey & of course Boxer From Shantung.",1494460800,,1823,4.343108504398827
