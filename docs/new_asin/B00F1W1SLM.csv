8611607,5,B00F1W1SLM,I watched the concert on cable and enjoyed it so much that I decided to purchase it. The visual quality was exactly the same.,1418688000,,125,4.25
8611608,3,B00F1W1SLM,"It's supposed to be a blu-ray concert, the sound is very poor and the concert no comments.",1418083200,,90,4.352941176470588
8611609,5,B00F1W1SLM,Truly connected with his story!,1410912000,,31,5.4
8611610,5,B00F1W1SLM,"This is 1 of the best concerts I have seen in a ling time.  And the little person impersonating Ceelo ""mini Ceelo"" did an excellent job.",1400457600,,136,4.230769230769231
8611611,3,B00F1W1SLM,Ceelo is such a GREAT singer.  And this show it would of been better with him just being a singer and not an entertainer.  He needed to sing more of his songs.  If you ever watch Darrel House on TV even Ceelo was on there he was great I love his voice.  But this was very disappointing.,1390348800,,286,3.9649122807017543
8611612,3,B00F1W1SLM,"I'm glad we spent money on the DVD, rather than going to see the show in Vegas.

CeeLo is kind of flat and very egotistical, without really having the amazing talent to back it up.

Plus it sounds like he was simply shrieking the whole time.

Worth it if you are a BIG CeeLo fan, but not a good buy if you are a more casual friend of the ""Big Man"".",1388016000,,348,3.8732394366197185
8611613,4,B00F1W1SLM,"I'm not a huge CeeLo fan, but I enjoyed this blu-ray. I thought the singing and dancing was good. I did feel like it dragged a little during CeeLo's costume changes. However, it was a fun concert and definitely worth checking out.",1384732800,,230,4.5
