2224532,5,B0007OP1HG,I got my order fast at a low price. the dvd was like new. I made a miss take when I order this nirvana nevermind dvd now I got 2 the same movie. so it look like I got to sell both of them if I can at a very low price. or just give both of them away this is if I can. for one thing I didn't like the first one. I wanted to hear songs of nevermind not b.s. Thank You Shane,1372377600,,370,3.364705882352941
2224533,5,B0007OP1HG,"I have watched this many times, using it as a teaching aid in my college course about popular music. It is far and away the best documentary on any music subject I have ever seen (irrespective of genre). Brilliantly constructed, involving and most of all illuminating.",1366243200,,268,4.8478260869565215
2224534,4,B0007OP1HG,"first off, let me say that I LOVE this series.  The Dark Side of the Moon one is priceless, and I even loved the Def Leppard episode when I caught it on VH1.  And this one is really great too... it's awesome to see how the band reformed during the recording process and to see Butch Vig get obviously choked up while discussing the tracking...however, I was a LITTLE disappointed that this documentary didn't get into the slight controversy over the mix of the album... I for one am excited to finally hear Butch Vig's original mix of the album (which will be part of the deluxe reissue coming this year).. only to hear how his take differed from the one Andy Wallace finally did for the record.  DGC comes off as confident and cool when in fact there was MUCH hand wringing about this record before it was released...  they insisted the album be remixed and brought Andy Wallace in to do it after Butch Vig had turned in his mix...

Don't get me wrong, I actually LOVE the mix of this album.  Andy Wallace is EXTREMELY talented (listen to the first Rage Against the Machine album and the first White Zombie albums again to get an idea how awesome he really is)...  I, personally think this album sounds SOOOOOOOO much better than the sound Steve Albini got out of the band on In Utero (of course he's also the producer of one of the greatest performances vs. unlistenable mix/mastering albums of all time:  PJ Harvey's Rid of Me... I actually wanted to personally STRANGLE Albini after trying to listen to that record---can SOMEONE remix it for a reissue...PLEASE??????)....

And of course Cobain famously thought the record sounded overproduced and hired Albini as a result--- yet that's never covered here either... (IMHO, Cobain was wrong).

this IS a classic album and this is a great documentary about it--- but it should be presented warts and all....",1317168000,,1858,4.654434250764526
2224535,4,B0007OP1HG,"I've seen a good share of the Classic Albums series by now that I was expecting some real deep insight into the making of this classic album. But I think I know why that is with this edition and its probably because Kurt is no longer with us. I mean Krist even says this on the dvd that Kurt was the creative force behind the band. So how deep can you get when the source of that depth is dead. All it seemed like was them reflecting on how the album effected the band and the music landscape which by now has all been said before. One thing I couldn't help but notice is that they have deleted scenes and those cuts actually had the depth that I was looking for with some of them. But the fact that they have very useful deleted scenes for something (I'm pretty sure) that's only a DVD series puzzles me because what's the need for cutting them? I was looking for the making of the album not more or less a reflection of the album cause they're everywhere these days. Not to say this isn't a good watch, it's not up to par with the others in the Classic Album series. All the other ones I've seen (Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, The Doors' first album, Queen's A Night at the Opera, U2's Joshua Tree and even the unofficial first of the series The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band which is on YouTube) I would rate 5 outta 5 because they were just so much more insightful to how albums are made and the stories behind iconic songs, so that's why I give Nevermind a 4 outta 5.",1316217600,,1497,4.165517241379311
2224536,5,B0007OP1HG,"I am new to the ""Classic Album"" series. Being a Nirvana fan I picked this up new, sealed on here for like $4.00 and I will now look into the other additions to this series.

  Nevermind as a LP/CD has fantastic music, drove everyone nuts back in the day and opened the door for the Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam and Sound Garden types. ALL of which ADDED something the others did not have! What a great time to be 22 years old I now realise! Saw Nirvana live in 1993 and before that, I hardly knew their music but I researched and found a great backstory about them and was hooked. In Utero was my favorite album. If you enjoy Nirvana in the least pick this up. Great insight on how the album came to be, was recorded, how it was received and how it changed music at that time...literally overnight. I remember when they hit they made it big and FAST...was insane. I can't think of anyone recent that last did this...which is sad really. Current generations have no defining group that speaks for them..just the same old crap recycled. This era was a breath of fresh air. Like Dave Grohl says in it, he would be nothing if it wasn't for the other 2 members and music would not be the same without all 3 of them.

  Only complaint is that the sound format is Dolby 2.0, video is a decent 16X9 1.85 format and looks quite nice. Reissue this on Blu-ray with added footage, use a updated audio format and you are set.

Highly recommended.",1268870400,,1431,4.297397769516729

There aren't many CD's that you can put in and just let it play through but this is definitely one of those. The DVD us great on it's own because of the interviews, still shots and of course the making of the album itself. If you liked Teen Spirit, you'll like the rest of this great classic album and enjoy the making of it as I did. I only wish Kurt Cobain were still with us making great music.

2224541,4,B0007OP1HG,"Without Cobain to interview afresh for this release the producers have had to cobble together old interview footage. And this is part of the tragedy of the situation because I for one would love to be able to hear what a grown up and more mature Cobain would of said about the album he is most famous for. Others may champion earlier stuff like Bleach but it's Nevermind that for the average punter is this band, and in fact the entire grunge movements calling card.

That's not to say that Cobain doesn't get to speak, as noted earlier there is a chunk of interview footage with him. And Novoselic and Grohl do a great job in giving thoughtful and considered insights into the process and mind set of the band. The are less amusing anecdotes here than are shared by some of the other bands featured in this series perhaps because of the rather sombre tone the tragic end of the tale culminates in. But there are a slew of interesting points to be found out about the bands genesis and their progression through the trials and tribulations of the underground scene to their explosion with this album, spearheaded by the hard rock anthem Smells Like Teen Spirit.

As per usual with the Classic Albums series some of the most interesting aspects of this release are provided by the associates of the band - management and producer types and some of the real talent behind the band is explained. Which for me as only a casual fan was really enlightening and some of my preconceptions were challenged. Which is a great thing to have happen sometimes.

Through my reviews of various products, pretty much all the Classic Albums series I've written about have scored four stars. They aren't life changing - hey I'd rather play an album than watch a show about it most of the time - but they are great for fans, even casual ones. This one deserves four stars but only just, as there is that overall feeling of loss, of the part of the jig saw puzzle that should be in the middle has been lost forever. But the understated yet appropriate production values, interesting discussions and the bonus material which takes the running time out to 74 minutes mean this is well worth your while especially if you can pick it up cheap.

Nirvana were always a flawed proposition. Feeding off the usual teenage feelings of alienation they were the right band at the right time. At a stage where teenage alienation had become a packaged parody of itself, offered up with bright lights and brighter profit margins to an ever more consumerist 15-24 year old market, Nirvana came along and scooped up millions of fans who were alienated from the pre-packaged alienation, if you take my meaning. They only held these fans in the palms of their hands for a couple of years but that was enough to secure their place in hard rock/heavy metal folklore. Because while some sections of their fanbase may be aghast at the idea, this is hard rock. This album did not convert people to liking loud music, this album sold to people who already did. And this DVD is a great exploration of some of the reasons they jumped so effectively into the fast lane of the mainstream and the creative process of how they formed the recorded statement for which they'll always be remembered.",1200614400,2,3244,4.616984402079723
2224542,5,B0007OP1HG,"This is a very enjoyable documentary perfect for any Nirvana fan. It talks about everything from types of guitars used on certain tracks, to where the cover photo idea came from. Fun to watch.",1187395200,2,192,4.676470588235294
2224543,4,B0007OP1HG,"Was most interested in Butch Vig's track by track (track as in recording tracks, not album tracks) analysis of the album. Would've liked to have seen more of that, rather than just people talking about the album.",1182470400,2,212,4.756756756756757

Interesting that Vig had no idea he would be in control of what would become the huge selling album Nevermind. You will learn a lot from this 70min documentary and be taken back to a time where grunge was born.

2224546,5,B0007OP1HG,"I've seen so many Nirvana documentary dvd's out there that are a waste of my 37 minutes. This one, on the other hand, is one of the best one's that I've seen. It sucks that we KNOW there won't be any new Nirvana stuff out, so it's good to see the old stuff in great detail which this dvd provides. I won't explain the content because every other review does, but I'm a huge Nirvana fan, almost obsessive, and I think anyone out there looking for Nirvana dvd's are the same way. So hearing good reviews on a dvd such as this one's means a lot because these are typically true fans. Reading the good reviews is the whole reason I checked it out.

The only negative comment I think I could say is that I wish it could've been a little bit longer and maybe showed more of Kurt personally. I feel selfish even saying that because I know there is only so much footage taken and you can't go back in time and make more. That's why I kept this at five stars. I loved the interviews with Krist and Dave. They don't talk much about Nirvana now days so it was awesome to hear things from their perspective and what those days were like for the band. And we get to see the Nirvana baby!

If your a big fan, it's worth watching. I wish they would do a Classic Album dvd for In Utero too just so I can see more Nirvana!",1137456000,6,1305,4.09375
2224547,4,B0007OP1HG,"Another solidly-made, thoroughly interesting entry in the ""Classic Album"" series, this time focusing on Nirvana's landmark album, ""Nevermind.""

The doc goes through the tracks with in-depth analysis, and also talks to Grohl, Novoselic, Butch Vig and others.

There's not much else to say about the piece, except that if you love Nirvana, you'll probably find this completely absorbing.

And check the deleted scenes, too; I was surprised at how much important stuff was there.  The documentary itself is only 48 min., so I'm not sure why they cut out scenes such as the analysis of ""Drain You""; a section about Grohl's joining of the band (it's tough to overstate the importance of that addition to the band); a funny anecdote about the band's stymied attempt to travel from Seattle to L.A. to begin pre-production; and a look at the cover art that actually talks to the baby on the album cover -- now a likable and very hip-looking teenager.

This installment in the series is one of the better ones.",1131753600,20,1001,4.864705882352941
2224548,5,B0007OP1HG,"This video is a nice review of the making of Nirvana's most commercially successful album. There are some rather in-depth demonstrations of how the songs were mixed, and interviews with Krist Novaselic (looking a lot older I might add) and Dave Grohl. One of the best things about it is the way you hear the songs in a sort of deconstructed way. (Butch Vig?) strips the songs down to just one guitar and one vocal track, and then you witness as more tracks are added, until it matches the version that's on your cd at home. It's very interesting from the point of view of a musician who has never experienced the mixing process. It's kind of like being taken back in time to when the album was being made. But one of the best things about it is that Courtney Love is never mentioned! Maybe Dave Grohl does once, I can't remember. Regardless, if you love Kurt Cobain and the legacy of Nirvana, get this video, I doubt you'll be disappointed.",1125619200,10,940,4.47093023255814
2224549,4,B0007OP1HG,"What more could you ask for?

A DVD on the making of ""Nevermind"" featuring interviews with (most importantly of all) Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl among others highly relevant to the band.

I honestly can't say this is a bad dvd, but it would have been a PERFECT one if only they had gone into the recording and background of songs like ""Come As You Are"", ""Lithium"" (all that is offered is a version recorded in early sessions and even then there is little to say), ""On A Plain"" and 4 other songs. The focus instead is on ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", ""In Bloom"", ""Polly"" and ""Something In The Way"" with ""Drain You"" at least getting it's own feature in the bonus section of the dvd. I would to have loved to hear about more than 5 songs on the album. But what you do hear is worth it, I just think that if in the ""Classic Albums"" series Pink Floyd can get a release that is 10 minutes or more longer than Nirvanas then surely they could have filled this dvd a little more.

But needs must and this is really worth getting for any fan or person interested in recording processes of albums, I really enjoyed watching this and was left wanting more. There are some very interesting bits of info on the dvd.

In summary take some talking about the Bleach era or other un-necessary things and replace it with a couple of songs and it'd be killer!!! Or even yet just add more!!! Get it folks.",1119398400,7,1384,4.311538461538461

Rock band doesn't like to talk, they rock their MUSIC! How many Nirvana concert or music video DVD out there? Zero. The fantastic ""Nirvana Live! Sold Out!"" DVD is limited edition, and I just found 3 people are waiting for used DVD to buy.

2224552,4,B0007OP1HG,"i'm glad ""nevermind"" finally got a spot in the ""classic albums"" series.  it's probably best to leave the story of a controversial and famous record like ""nevermind"" to a reputable name who actually have a budget and can get butch vig, krist novoselic, dave grohl, and thurston moore to appear in their dvds rather than a bunch of burnouts and junkies who maybe knew kurt in middle school.  if you're interested in music engineering as i am, watching butch vig shave tracks off songs such as ""in bloom"" and ""drain you"" to reveal the individual vocal, guitar, and bass tracks naked is highly intriguing.  the comments from dave and krist are interesting as usual as is the appearence of thurston moore from sonic youth, one of my other favorite bands.

one small complaint is that the flow of the footage seems kind of disorienting and vague at times, as one minute krist would be talking about how he and kurt smashed their gear to get off stage and close their set while the next minute butch vig will be telling a little anecdote about how he couldn't get kurt to double track vocals.  this actually detracts from the overall value very little, however.

one other thing i missed in this release is the fact that the engineering aspects of songs such as ""lounge act"", ""breed"", ""territorial pissings"" (interesting in the sense that kurt plugged his guitar straight into the board), ""on a plain"", or ""stay away"" aren't to be found on this release.  clips of most of these songs can be found on the release but there isn't much in-depth information about them.  this is unfortunate, but this DVD dodges the bullet again and it doesn't ruin the experience.  as an aside, the june 2005 issue of guitar world contains two long, excellent articles about the making of ""bleach"" and ""nevermind"" that complement the information on this DVD very well.  the ""nevermind"" article is of interest because it does actually cover all of the songs on the album as well as the other songs that were recorded during the sessions but never used, such as ""sappy"" and ""old age"".

the exterior packaging is done very well too, keeping in with the watery theme of the cover art on ""nevermind"".  as such, i kind of expected a bunch of morons to buy it and expect it to be a compilation of music videos or something and get all pissed off when it's just some lame-o documentary with a bunch of stupid-head old dudes playing around in a studio.  try reading the packaging before you buy something, idiots.  and there actually is one full-length video in this release: a really good live version of ""polly"" with an ethereal, watery backdrop being projected on the curtain behind the band.  of course, i doubt this would please the ""smells like teen spirit"" teenie-boppers but i liked it.  the bonus material is very good as well and includes an interview with the now grown-up baby pictured on the cover of the album, who has now become a stuttering sub-mongoloid who looks like he was loaded into a cannon and fired into a wall at pacsun.  just like the kind of people who would buy a DVD about the making of ""nevermind"" and expect it to be a music video compilation.",1115424000,5,3139,4.627027027027027
2224553,4,B0007OP1HG,"This was a pretty pleasant surprise. Recent interviews with Kris and Dave, writers, journalists and producers with thier input on the making and influence of this record. Perfect DVD to sit and geek out on and absorb usesless knowledge. I have to admit, the bits with Butch Vig get a bit tedious. At times i'm thinkin' he's sorta milking it or just giving already obvious insight... and those glasses. haha... they don't make you look any cooler. get rid of the mustache, dude. Anyhow, the best parts are the interviews and extras with Kris and Dave. Also what's really admirable is the maintenance of the topic. There's no crying or drama about Kurt's death or drug problems, AND NO COURTNEY LOVE!! WHHOOHOOO! Although, some insight from Dave and Kris' point of view on the topic of Kurt's death totally intrigue me, that would have put a damper on the DVD. There's some really cool live footage from their beginnings and some well done video graphic art work. geeky stuff not alot of people might care about but it adds to the quality and enjoyment of the DVD. There are some live clips (kris with shaved head...yikes) and a full live version of Polly on the extras. Also the baby on the cover of the record is now 14 years old and get his 15 minutes (well, more like 3) of fame.  dude, its cheap and its really enjoyable. buy it.",1113436800,5,1332,4.55

If your just a casual nirvana fan whos only looking for the music videos (which can easily be found on the net) then this is not for you. This is a documentary is based on the making of this incredible album, which why would anyone expect the videos to be on here? The purpose is to give a behind the scenes look at the making of this masterpiece. The new/ recent interviews with Dave Grohl & Krist Novoselic are great! It is rare for them to speak publicly about Nirvana, especially dave, so these are a great treat! Some great stories and insight that have not been revealed anywhere else. But by far the best parts of the dvd is when Butch Vig (the producer) breaks down the trackings of the recordings, when he drops out the intrumentation and is just playing the Kurts vocal tracks, to hear just kurts voice on its own is incredibly moving. I highly recommend this DVD, it is by far the best Nirvana documentary I've seen. And Ive pretty much seen them all.",1112745600,7,1032,4.380208333333333
2224555,4,B0007OP1HG,"When I heard this DVD was coming out I wasn't sure what it was. It even took me a while to buy it because of that. I didn't want to get disappointed, and I didn't. This is the making of Nevermind. With no real footage from the sessions though, the band members, producers, etc tell the story. The thing was there are really not any interviews of Kurt. I am pretty sure he has said something about the album or the sessions in the past. The extra features include a live performance of ""Polly"", which if you have the box set the performance of ""Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam"" it is the same concert. Also the making of the smells like teen spirit. Again there is no footage of the shoot just director Sam Bayer discussing the shoot. Also the band talks about how Dave joined the band. The making of ""Drain You"" is just the producer messing around with the soundboard and discussing the session. Then the band and everyone else just discuss how they got the idea for the album cover. They even interview Spencer Elden who is the baby featured on the Nevermind Cover. If you're a big Nirvana fan this is for you. I still think it could have been better though.",1112659200,3,1163,4.339449541284404

get the actuall music videos to the nevermind CD.

But NOOO! I'ts CRAP! the only part of the actual video you get to see is about the first 5 seconds then it fades to the prouducer who explains how he recorded the song!!!!

 I was misled into thinking that an actual collaboration of full music videos exsisted!

All I wanted was to be able to watch the whole music video.

This DVD is more for the recording art student who desires to learn about the way in witch the songs were recorded, not for the average Nirvana fan.

2224558,4,B0007OP1HG,"the second I saw the advertisement for this in that godawful Spin magazine, I rushed out and purchased this DVD. it is that of the story of how Nevermind, the greatest album of the 90's, was made. the story is told by producer Butch Vig, Sub Pop founder John Poneman, the baby featured on the cover (now a grown young chap,) and surviving members Krist Noveselic and Dave Grohl. Chad Channing does not appear for commentary.

of course the DVD is packaged together nicely with some live clips here and there, insights into the mixing of a select few songs, rare interviews around the time of Nevermind, the story of the cover, and it's all tied in together nicely with a rich, watery layout that serves to the imagery of the album.

after watching the film, I felt disapointed that the story ommited certain occurences during the making of the album that would have made for great entertainment. such as the time Nirvana went behind the studio after a day's work for a BBQ and shared hot dogs with Ozzy Osbourne. I was also left without venturing into the technical aspects of quite possibly the most artistic song on the album, ""Come As You Are,"" and how Butch Big stacked layers of clean, chorusey guitars with a mix of distortion for the song's atmosphere. I even wished there was narration into the event where Krist screamed the Youngbloods song through Kurt's humbucker for the intro to ""Territorial Pissings.""

though, however much was not included into the film can just as easily be read in the book, ""Nevermind"" by Jim Berkenstadt and Charles Cross (the #1 overtly-obsessed-Cobain-fanatic on the planet.)

good DVD, amazing album, great book.",1111881600,3,1652,4.7859649122807015
2224559,5,B0007OP1HG,"This DVD is a must have for any Nirvana fan. I picked this up and watched it over and over.

The DVD features interviews of the surviving members Chris Novoselic and Dave Grohl, album producer Butch Vig recreating the mixes on the songs, and lots of insight to the recording process of the album. There is also some critical analysis of the songs by a biographer and some journalists.

One of the coolest parts of the DVD is when Butch Vig separates each of the instruments from the songs and describing the recording process. For instance, ""In Bloom"" has multiple vocal tracks layered upon it. He first played the song with just Kurt's voice, then added Dave Grohl's vocals (high harmonies in the chorus), and finally doubled each of their vocal tracks to produce the finished product. Awesome.

""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" is one of the main segments (totaling around 10 minutes long) In the beginning, there is a clip of the first live Smells Like Teen Spirit performance. Butch Vig goes into some detail on how he tracked the song. The last part of the segment talked about the making of the music video.

As far as the bonus material, theres some background history in the segments ""Going To Record In LA"" and ""Dave Grohl Joins Nirvana"". ""Drain You"" was cool since Butch Vig shows how elaborate it was to produce (5 guitars/funky sound effects/etc). And finally, the live version of ""Polly"" was a nice touch to the DVD.

The entire DVD does a great job of showing how each of the songs were put together. Butch Vig goes through about half the album in detail (to keep the running time resonable I guess) and there are lot of interviews to keep the viewer entertained. I definitely recommend this for any Nirvana fan.",1111708800,12,1719,4.641447368421052

2224561,5,B0007OP1HG,"First of all, this DVD is amazing. Second, there is no way there's going to be a Kurt Cobain ever ever ever ever ever again. I've heard some people say that the greatest things last few, and i think it's true, because Nirvana was the thing that changed everything, the dark lyrics that gave lights to frustrated people, used as a medicine, as a therapy, worked. The songs were amazing, and now, they are as amazing as they were some time ago. Will never fade away.",1111708800,4,464,4.406976744186046

this dvd really gets into the technical aspect of the recording and mixing, and how the songs came to be.
really interesting if you like nirvana/pop culture in the 90's.

the interviews shine some light on the recording process. and track by track examinations make this a fan must-have.",1428883200,,366,4.615384615384615

8049642,5,B0007OP1HG,"I'm a huge fan of this series because they really take the viewer into the studio and have the producer of ""Nevermind""(Butch Vig) take you through all the mastery of the craft. You get to hear the music from this groundbreaking album broken down and see how it was put together peice by peice while getting to know the journey that Kurt, Dave, and Krist took to get themselves from the punk rock scene around Aberdeen, WA to Sun studios in LA to record an album for Geffen Records",1395532800,,480,4.404494382022472
8049643,5,B0007OP1HG,"This is a great addition to my large Nirvana collection.

A lot of what you see on this DVD is coming from the actual creators of this incredible and historical music. From two of the remaining Nirvana members, Dave Grohl & Krist Novoselic, to the producer, Butch Vig, you can really see and feel how impactful this music and Kurt Cobain was. Kurt was a genius, and it's so sad to see someone so great leave so soon.

Was really cool to see Butch in the producing room tinkering with the tracks and hearing how everything came together and how great Nirvana was. Like he said, Nirvana was quick and efficient, and were focused on one thing, making great music.

Just like they were all saying, after Nevermind was released, the music industry was forever changed.",1384041600,,763,4.595588235294118
