8644354,3,B00IP01RPO,"The series is great.  The plots and acting are excellent.  However, the quality of the discs are not up to par.  Several of the episodes either won't play or they stop in the middle.  More than one disc will not load.  We are very disappointed that we aren't able to see all of the episodes as this was an excellent show.",1446336000,,321,4.19672131147541
