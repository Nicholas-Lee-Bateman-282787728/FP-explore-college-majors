8550030,5,B00AD4KE8G,"Despite much talk and disagreement as to who contributed what to it, REBECCA is definitely an Alfred Hitchcock film. Producer David O. Selznick hands-on approach to producing definitely is evident, yet the film does not look entirely like your typical Selznick movie for that period. I would think this is director Alfred Hitchcock's doing. Yet again, it does not resemble the style that Hitchcock employed in his first American film, FOREIGN CORESPONDENT.",1398297600,,456,5.347222222222222

8550032,5,B00AD4KE8G,"This is one of Hitchcock's best films, his first for Hollywood.  While it has his traditional themes of the murder mystery, there is an additional level of psychological realism that is missing in most of his later films, all in a splendidly atmospheric gothic romance, complete with a dark and ruined aristocratic mansion and the stuffy cruelty of the British upper classes and their servants.  I will describe the setup of the plot, but not reveal any spoilers.

Fontaine is a young lady down on her luck, working as a companion - a kind of servant and sycophant - for an aging matron on vacation in the Riviera.  The old lady is oppressive in her demands and expectation that Fontaine will submit to her whims without question, a cipher to intimidate and humiliate.  But Fontaine's youthful radiant beauty gains the attention of a mysterious widower, Maxim, played by Olivier (he too is young, but always looks old).  They begin a furtive romance, but there is something extremely dark and almost dead about him, a pull from another life or presence.

Once married - and warned with the cruelest condescension by her former employer that she will never be able to handle her new responsibilities - they move into a massive mansion in England.  The servants, in particular the head woman, declare a kind of war on the young lady, who accepts her role yet is intimidated by their apparent sophistication and expectations.

The terrible presence in the house is the departed Rebecca, whom everyone seems to idolize and love.  Fontaine must fight this, feeling her husband compares her unfavorably.  With all these pressures, she becomes depressed and ever more fearful, lost amidst characters whose motivations are impossible to understand.  What happened to her?  Is there any chance she can find peace, if not happiness, with Maxim?  These questions plague the girl as she explores the forbidden wing of the mansion.

Her life seems to be going nowhere, as stagnant as her marriage begins to feel.  Then suddenly, an incident opens Maxim to her, and he confides in her finally.  Things are not what they seemed and a difficult imbroglio follows that involves violence and accusations, climaxing in destruction.  While romantic, the buildup is both frightening and depressing, an odd combination but completely believable.

Though it now appears as a kind of relic, this is a great viewing experience for film buffs and Hitchcock fans, but it should be entertaining for casual viewers as well.  Warmly recommended.  It is a masterpiece and the acting is first rate.",1393545600,,2566,4.976525821596244
8550033,3,B00AD4KE8G,"The DVD I received was the ""Rebecca"" movie, but it was a different cover, a black & white picture, and it appears to be an older looking version.  I specifically ordered from this vendor to get the ""Rebecca"" movie with THIS color cover, and which the write-up online also indicated there are extra features included.  I could have purchased this black & white version for around $8 from a number of other vendors instead of the $15 I paid to get this color picture cover version.  I'm not sure whether this black & white version I received instead is missing the extra features that this color cover one has.  It was a Christmas present for my mom, and I didn't have time to return it and mess with this possible ""switcheroo"" that I got.  Not feeling very good about this.",1391990400,,772,4.485714285714286
8550034,5,B00AD4KE8G,"No director could have been more perfect to direct ""Rebecca"" than Alfred Hitchcock.

After all, Daphne du Maurier's classic tale of romantic suspense is a complex tale of murder and manipulation. So Hitchcock was in his element in this movie -- he gives it an elegance and glowing beauty, but there's still a raw sea of emotion boiling under the surface. And yes, Rebecca haunts the entire movie, never seen but always present.

A timid young woman (Joan Fontaine) is working as a paid companion in Monte Carlo, where she meets the brooding millionaire Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). When her employer unexpectedly decides to leave, Maxim proposes marriage to the young woman, and they are quickly married before setting off to his ancestral estate of Manderley. It seems like a dream come true to the new Mrs. de Winter.

But as soon as she arrives, Mrs. de Winter is haunted by the presence of Maxim's first wife, Rebecca. Rebecca was beautiful, charming, accomplished, intelligent and stylish -- and everybody, especially the creepy housekeeper Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) compares them. But when a sunken ship is found in the nearby bay, the truth about Rebecca's life -- and death -- is finally revealed, and it could tear the de Winters apart...

""Rebecca"" was the first movie that Alfred Hitchcock made in Hollywood, and in many ways it's his most conventional film. It follows the book pretty closely (except for some meddling by the censors), shot in a warmly-lit, elegant style that highlights the beauty of Manderley. Every time things become too comfortable, the presence of Rebecca wafts back in like a ghost.

Hitchcock is at his best in the weirder, more twisted parts of the story, such as when Mrs. Danvers takes Mrs. de Winter on a tour of Rebecca's bedroom, or tries to tempt her into committing suicide. And he really hits his stride in the movie's final third, which switches gears from romantic suspense right over to a sorta-kinda-murder mystery. The simmering tension and passionate emotions are absolutely spellbinding.

The one big problem? THE MUSIC. Those soppy, swelling, sentimental strings that sometimes blot out dialogue and make the emotional scenes feel corny. If only Hitchcock's more minimalist soundtrack style had been present here!

Joan Fontaine gives a pretty good performance as a nervous, insecure young woman who fears that her husband doesn't really love her; the problem with her performance is the weird way she smiles whenever she cries. And Anderson is pitch perfect as the unblinking housekeeper who still has a passionate, almost erotic fixation on her beloved Rebecca -- she glides through Manderley, a figure of cold ghostly hate.

And Olivier is the perfect Maxim -- a brooding, tormented soul who is also incredibly passionate... and way too blunt for his own good. He's the ultimate Byronic hottie. And Olivier's performance is absolutely stunning, such as the emotionally charged scene where he describes his life with Rebecca.

""Rebecca"" is a silken, elegant piece of work, and Hitchcock is at his best when he touches on the twisted, dark presence of the title character. An absolute masterpiece.",1366761600,5,3164,5.069230769230769
