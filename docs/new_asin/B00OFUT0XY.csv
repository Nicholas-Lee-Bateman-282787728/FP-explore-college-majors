8683382,5,B00OFUT0XY,"In response to Dean's question, no, this isn't a best-of collection.  Rather, this is a 3 disc set of performances from the 2014 Wacken festival, which once again proves it is the greatest metal festival in the world.  Contains excellent performances from established and newer metal acts.",1446422400,,289,5.127659574468085

8683384,4,B00OFUT0XY,"Can someone tell me if this is compilation footage from 25 years of Wacken festivals or does it contain new footage also and have the Wacken festivals now been cancelled to be held no more or will they be back at the end of 2015. Was wondering why Slayer was listed in another ad for this but that show is not on these discs but entire show in included in their new album, I thought this was strange but ordered it anyway because I like variety.",1439596800,,445,4.186046511627907

8683388,5,B00OFUT0XY,"I always purchase the Wacken DVDs, I have been to the festival and seeing it brings back memories. I gave this 5 stars due to the packaging and booklet which is mostly pictures and stories from each Wacken. The music selection on the DVDs is not great. One DVD is full of German bands like Subway to Sally, no disrespect to them but these bands are only popular in Germany. The other DVD has up and coming bands couple good and a couple bad and then the main DVD with the International big name bands. I still think for all you get it's worth the price and still cheaper than going to the festival.",1424044800,3,598,4.254385964912281
