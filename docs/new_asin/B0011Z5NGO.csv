3070923,5,B0011Z5NGO,"Rachel Ashwell had a show called ""Rachel Ashwell Shabby Chic"" on Style Network a few years back.  Her company has just released three DVDs from that series: (1) Treasures (2) Gifts, Sentiments & Romance and (3) Flowers, Petals & Gardens.
Each DVD contain 3 episodes so if you buy all three DVDs you will own 9 episodes from the original series.  There are many more episodes yet to be released, depending on how well these three initial DVDs sell they'll consider putting out more DVDs.  So, if you are a fan of Rachel Ashwell and want to see more please buy all 3 DVDs.  The more demand there is the more likely they'll release the rest of the series onto DVD.  But if you can only buy one then get this one, it's the best of the three because it is on this DVD that she focuses on home furnishings.

Here is what you get on this DVD:
1- House
2- Flea Market
3- Affordable Elegance

In the HOUSE episode Rachel has just bought a home in LA for her parents to stay in whenever they visit from England.  Simple renovations transform a 1940's home into the epitome of Shabby Chic...and she does it on a limited budget in only 5 weeks time.

In the FLEA MARKET episode you watch as Rachel and her partner Mark search a local antiques flea market for its treasures.  She spots her signature colors (white, pink and green) and well-crafted furniture from days gone by.  Rachel appreciates these depreciated pieces (a time worn cabinet from Iowa, a cupboard from the turn of the century, etc) for their history, whimsy, beauty and function.  They take their finds back to the shop where Mark cleans them up with some quick & easy restoration work.  The Shabby Chic principal is to accept imperfections rather than change them.

The last episode on this disc is GIFTS, SENTIMENTS & ROMANCE.  Rachel visits the home of her friend, Hollywood hairdresser Chantal Clautier.  Chantal has created the ideal Shabby Chic retreat by using authentic antiques and flea market finds.  You won't see this home in any of Rachel's books, you'll have to buy the DVD to see this gorgeous home!

UPDATE 4/12:  As you can see there have been no further releases of the Shabby Chic television show on DVD.  I hear Style Network is the reason for the bottleneck.  Rachell wants to see the rest of the series put on DVD as much as her fans do but she doesn't own them, Style does.  And they've LOST the series!  Style Network can't find them in their vault.  Can you believe that?  Surely they're not looking hard enough.  Very disappointing.",1213574400,41,2513,4.541202672605791
3070924,5,B0011Z5NGO,This dvd is I think my favourite I too enjoy going to markets and buying old furniture and fixing it up and displaying it in my home. I have four daughters and they love the Shabby Chic theme as well. We treasure everything we buy and enjoy. We always feel proud when friends and family come over and admire all the wonderful furniture and simple things that we purchase from markets.  We are having so much fun shopping for vintage treasures and special wares to fill our beautiful home. Thanks Rachel from the Batsas girls.xx,1211155200,5,527,4.5473684210526315

8243170,5,B0011Z5NGO,Lovely and wonderfully filled with pretty shabby ideas on house renovating. Beautiful and simple ways to transform a home into a comfortable place to live.,1398211200,,155,5.24
8243171,3,B0011Z5NGO,It was good for that type of design.  Shabby chic is on it's way out of style. I would not reccommend it if you plan on selling your house.,1361145600,,139,3.793103448275862
8243172,5,B0011Z5NGO,"I only wish Rachel Ashwell had more DVD's like this!  The three stories within are all about different aspects of the Shabby Chic style: a trip to the flea market and what Rachel looks for when shopping for items, renovating a house for family to stay in when visiting, and an ethereal trip to a close friend's drop-dead, gorgeous, upscale ranch-style home complete with many grand chandeliers!  Total eye-candy, Girls!!!",1359504000,,421,5.0
8243173,4,B0011Z5NGO,"I own two of this and and another and although I am happy to have them, I really was unhappy that they were ""chopped"".  Also, Of all of the full episodes I think there was just one that I didn't absolutely love, so why not offer the FULL episodes as a set? I would surely buy it...the DVD quality is really good, I just wish the episodes were complete!",1266019200,6,352,4.101449275362318
8243174,5,B0011Z5NGO,"I used to watch ""Shabby Chic"" on the Style network and was glad to find it anew on DVD.Although,my tastes embrace more than the
shabby chic palette...I believe we can learn a great deal from
talented Rachel Ashwell.

In the first segment,Rachel sets about re-decorating a home for her parents to live in while staying in L.A.She also purchases the
home for them.

The house is a comfortable size and needs some upgrading. As Rachel
says,""It has good bones"",referring to the walls,fireplace and general sructure. In a fifty year old kitchen,rather than rip it
apart and stick an island in the middle,she does some thinking first,considering her limited budget.
She removes an old vinyl yellow seating in a corner booth,places
a table and chairs next to a window and improves the view,little
by little. Keeping the original old fashioned functional tiles,she
paints them all white and pristine looking. She removes linoleum
and finds wood floors beneath to finish. Adding some modern small
appliances and voila,she is finished.

It is so much more fun on DVD because you actually grasp the house
size. She carefully goes through each room, painting mostly and
bringing in comfy chairs and couches with pillows. She finds little pieces of beauty that don't overwhelm a room. Even my
husband approved of the decorating.

The next segment is the flea market. This is how Rachel started out. She has a darling pink wire basket and tells you what to
bring(measuring tape,tablet,snack etc.)As she can judge the""good
bones"" in a house,she can pick furniture from the Midwest and
structurely judge it. She seems to have an instinct on how she will use each piece. Her friend,Mark,gets the instuctions from
Rachel of how best to fix a piece. It shows how to re-purpose
good wood. We used to call this method ""antiquuing.""Some items
she sells and some she keeps. I found this very instuctive.

Next,you tour Rachel's friends' house,Chantel Clothier. It is
decorated very elegantly but it could be acheived. There is a feeling of beauty in everything she shows and describes.

After listening to the news,which is generally tragic,this dvd
lifts your mood out of all the gloom in the world.
The music,the decor,never too difficult,puts you in a relaxed
Zen mood.
I do hope there are more of Rachel's dvd's released. It might be worth watching again as Rachel shows a clean,minilmalistic
way of living that may especially apply in this time.",1250726400,8,2427,4.980246913580247
8243175,5,B0011Z5NGO,I love Rachel Ashwell's design style and enjoyed watching her show back in 2001 when she was on Style.  The shows are great and you can get some great design ideas.  I have the whole collection.,1249689600,,194,4.361111111111111
8243176,5,B0011Z5NGO,My wife absolutely loves all of Rachel Ashwell's things. Thanks sooo much. Terry and Darlene,1242086400,3,92,5.2
8243177,5,B0011Z5NGO,I enjoyed this DVD and hope that more are released. The only downside is it only has a running time of 66 mins.,1215648000,9,111,3.869565217391304
