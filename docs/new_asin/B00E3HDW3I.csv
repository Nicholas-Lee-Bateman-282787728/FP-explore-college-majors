5886826,5,B00E3HDW3I,If you're a fan of great acting and even better writing then this series is for you. The story line is interesting and it keeps up with current events in the United States and around the world.,1384128000,10,193,4.243243243243243
5886827,5,B00E3HDW3I,"I really enjoyed this series and am waiting for the release of season two.  I pre-ordered it.  Its  very in line with my political views and beliefs.  I found it to be educational as well as entertaining.  And, it was great to see Jane Fonda perform again.  Jeff Daniels is excellent in his role.  What a great actor.  And, the female lead is totally awesome.  Her facial expressions are such a mark of a great performer.",1381363200,9,421,4.434210526315789
5886828,4,B00E3HDW3I,"Great writing/acting/production/direction makes this show one of the best on TV. But...if you actually know anything about how government or media works, you will find this apologia for both hilarious in its extremist corporate approved views. Of course the American government could not have committed a war crime---especially not a so called liberal administration... right?
Also droll is:
The way the characters wear halos and copulate like gerbils.
The way the news producer babe knows everything about every kind of weapon in the military.
The way every news honey can fight like guys twice their weight.
The way media would NEVER ever obfuscate.
The way way the producer slaps the star around and he takes it.
The way gay soldiers are the most honorable.
The way AK round is stopped by a kid's spine.
Suffice to say that there are many more unintentional laughs in this show than intentional ones.
But what the heck, why not watch---as long as you watch for free at one of the many streaming sites online.
Don't PAY for the privilege of watching their slick propaganda.",1380067200,5,1075,4.94475138121547
5886829,5,B00E3HDW3I,"I so loved season 1 that I bought season 2 of ""The News Room"". Wrong! There is another show out there called The News Room. The second season has not been released yet. Can't wait to buy it. I too have watched many of the episodes twice...they are that good. The humor/writing is wonderful. Don't miss it.",1380067200,5,305,4.368421052631579
5886830,5,B00E3HDW3I,"Seriously! Love the levels of smart, witty and insightful handling of things that have actually been going on in the world. We leave possibly seeing the events from a different perspective and feel highly satisfied with our entertainment quotient...which is a rare thing in itself.

5886831,5,B00E3HDW3I,"The Newsroom is so good that I've watched it twice -- not merely because it MERITS the repeat viewings, but because the dialogue is so sharp and so fast that some of the genius doesn't truly register until subsequent viewing.  The final episode of the second season deftly connected the threads of the story from both seasons and gave one of the most satisfying happy endings I've ever seen.  Love this show!  Jeff Daniels heads up a terrific ensemble, and if his character's infrequent use of tobacco riles some viewers -- ha! (Last I checked, tobacco is still LEGAL.)",1379635200,51,569,4.7272727272727275
5886832,1,B00E3HDW3I,"We enjoyed this series until the first episode which included totally out of place and unnecessary use of the tobacco drug. As someone else has already pointed out, Jeff Daniel's character wouldn't be smoking, he would be spouting the facts that tobacco kills 500,000 smokers and, more importantly, 65,000 innocent Americans (who were exposed to a witch's brew of carcinogens and poisons from others' tobacco smoke)!

If Will or anyone else there was caught smoking, more than one person working there would have called the Health Department and it would have been stopped immediately.

So, why is smoking included in The Newsroom? Is the creator of this show or one or more of the writers a smoker? Even worse, in the last episode we've seen, after Sam Waterson's character admonishes Will on his smoking (""Why don't you just set yourself on fire?""), he then takes the cigarette and smokes it himself!

I wonder if anyone would be complaining if Daniel's character had an addiction of putting his hands down the blouse or up the dress of all the women which entered his office or urinating on them?

We've now stopped watching this program and will not be purchasing the DVDs, of course.

Clean up your act, HBO!",1378771200,7,1213,4.840579710144928
5886833,5,B00E3HDW3I,"Season two.

What is it about? It revolves around a news broadcast station and those that work for the news agency, ACN.

Jeff Daniels. Isn't he the Dumber part of Dumb & Dumber? Yeah, but dumb he's not. I have always liked Jeff Daniels but I never got the impression he was capable of fulfilling such a role. I guess no one ever gave him the chance. Seeing this side of Daniels was a bit shocking at first. I was like.....""WOW, where did this come from?"" He is witty, intelligent, sharp as a tack and is nothing less than impressive. Very impressive.

This shows relies on two things and one of them is strong acting from all. The cast delivers and delivers well. The other thing is writing. This is one of the best written shows on TV with strong actors capable of delivering well written scripts. The dialogue is fast, funny, intelligent and their timing is well executed. The scripts reflect today's current events which makes it even more fun. I have not seen a TV program with this level of well delivered scripts since Gilmore Girls.

This show is not one that you can casually watch while doing other things....like playing on the computer. This show requires your attention. As the first reviewer remarked, you can watch an episode independent of the others and still enjoy it but watching them chronologically is best and stuff will make more sense.

Hats off to Mr. Daniels for such an excellent performance. 5 stars easy.

Edited to add: Mr. Daniels won an Emmy this year as Best Actor in a drama series for this role. If he nudged out Bryan Cranston in his final season, you know Daniels is dishing out some serious stuff.",1376956800,89,1635,4.563139931740614
5886834,5,B00E3HDW3I,"The second season of HBO's NEWSROOM picks up where last season leaves off. However, unlike shows like TRUE BLOOD, there's no cliffhanger from season 1 that needs resolving. So if you haven't watched season 1, you can jump right in without feeling overwhelmed by complicated plots, and various character's backstories. All you need to know is that its a story about the characters who bring us the nightly news on ATLANTA CABLE NEWS (ACN, representing apparently a mash up of CNN and NBC.) Jeff Daniels is Will McAvoy, the news ancor who called ""THE TEA PARTY"" the ""American Taliban"", has a romantic history with his producer, Mackenzie. The other romantic backstory involves Maggie, a fact checker in the newsroom, played by the lovely Alison Pill. She is torn between her live-in boyfriend from season 1, Don Keefer, a producer in the newsroom, and her REAL love, Jim Harper, who's also a producer. The other two main characters include Sloan Sabbith, who's a super genius economist with her own news show on the economy. Sloan is beautiful, and socially awkward since her intelligence puts guys off. And finally there's Neal, a young guy who runs the ACN internet page, and monitors Will's blog.

Season TWO opens in early 2012 with a conference involving the company Lawyers, and the newsroom cast, over a wrongful termination suite. During the first ten minutes of the new season, we discover that the temporary news producer who was hired to cover for Jim Harper, was fired for bringing a fake story to ACN, that concerned the US military using chemical weapons in Afghanistan. Mistakenly reporting that the US military committed war crimes, has serious consequences. But how did this happen? Well, there's a replacement news producer filling in for Jim Harper, who needed time off. Jim could no longer face Maggie, his secret love, at work. So Jim is allowed to be a normal reporter on Mitt Romney's bus. Meanwhile, Maggie decides she also needs to get away from the Newsroom, so she volunteers to cover a story in Africa, where a horrible tragedy involving orphans devastates her. The only back story from season one that plays out in season two, involves Jim and Maggie's hidden love for each other being revealed during a drunken confessional in public, which was secretly video taped and placed on Youtube. Jim's girlfriend, and Maggie's boyfriend (Don Keefer)both saw the video on youtube, and break ups ensue. Also lingering from season 1, Mackenzie comes ONE MORE STEP closer to discovering that Will is still in love with her.

The entire season 2 story arc occurs during 5 days, during which we are shown how the ACN news team tries to vet a seemingly reliable allegation about the military's use of chemical weapons. Needless to say, the story was bogus but was reported on the nightly news, and everybody is in serious hot water. Along with that, minor subplots concern Neal's coverage of OCCUPY WALLSTREET, and Jim's coverage of Romney's presidential election campaign. As in season one, the drama of interpersonal relationships at the workplace, while covering hot news stories, is the motor behind the whole show. But why do people love the NEWSROOM? Because its smart. THE NEWSROOM concerns highly intelligent, sophisticated New Yorkers leading their personal and professional lives, in the post 9/11 world. The relationships, like the news stories, are firmly grounded in realism, but with a nice dose of snarky comedy, tied to personal insight. Best of all, we're given a balanced, philosophical albeit cynical overview of our world's news. Its riveting, without pandering to sensationalist melodrama, or involving supernatural elements. (Nobody's a vampire, an alien, a psychic, or a secret cyborg. At least, we don't think so...) So if you like dramedy coupled to a ""behind the scenes"" look at network newscasts, you might just find THE NEWSROOM a fun ride. At least fun until its not anymore.",1375574400,113,3918,5.007668711656442
5886835,1,B00E3HDW3I,"The female characters of this show are so incredibly badly written - they are all ditzy, cute, helpless, need to be saved by men, unprofessional, goofy, puppy eyed damsels in distress. I cant believe this show comes from today's thinkers.",1521244800,,238,4.975
5886836,1,B00E3HDW3I,Beware. This DVD was listed as Region 1 but it is really region 2. Unplayable on US players.,1520294400,,92,4.166666666666667
5886837,5,B00E3HDW3I,"Absolutely loved this show and what it stands for.  My husband and I cut the cable a long time ago.  We got tired of the fact that despite the shear number of  channels available we could hardly find anything good to watch then when you did find something (and I am being generous here) good to watch you almost always got interrupted by commercials that were so ridiculous we couldn't believe someone actually pitched the idea let alone bought and produced it...and to finalize the problem would be the fact that the news just did more of what the bad shows and commercials did...catered to the over sexed, under educated, and morally vacant people who think that what star is dating who, what star tweeted what and kim kardashians ass are more important then the real problems in the world!  More recently the news has become fiction....make up whatever the hell you want and call it news even when there is proof out there...facts out there that say your wrong!  The Newsroom made the point that news shouldn't be bought and news shouldn't be rated... it should be the FACTS of what is going on around the world and they should be told truthfully without any bias or influence.  Anyway with that said, I thought this show was great, entertaining, fast-paced, well written and well acted.  I watched all 3 seasons in 2 days and wish there was more to watch.  I found myself wanting to argue along side them when they had to fight for the ability to do the news right.  I found things in every episode I could related to, I loved that is was set in the past and used some of the real news stories from our history it made is easy to melt into the the Newsroom as a participant and not just a viewer.  I highly recommend this show!!!",1518134400,2,1733,4.455696202531645

5886856,5,B00E3HDW3I,"'Newsroom' season 2 has found it's legs.  It takes place in Atlantis Cable News and Jeff Daniels plays Will McAvoy. It is said his character is a take off of Keith Olbermann, late of MSNBC, though everyone denies it. Gruff exterior with a brilliant mind. He is taken off guard when his producer moves to a new show and takes his staff with him.

Emily Mortimer, plays MacKenzie, an old love and now his new executive producer. Mortimer is the one thing wrong with this show. I don't see the chemistry between she and Will.

John Gallagher, Jr., plays James ""Jim"" Harper, a producer who was offered another job when MacKenzie's previous show was canceled but turned it down to follow her. Alison Pill, plays Margaret ""Maggie"" Jordan: an eager associate producer of News Night. She has complicated personal relationships, and she has just come back from Africa and a very difficult situation.
Alison is a true spirit and great actress. Dev Patel plays Neelamani ""Neal"" Sampat, the writer of Will's blog and news scanner of the Internet. He becomes an ncreasingly mportant member of the team. Olivia Munn plays, Sloan Sabbith. She is an economist with a show on the network, and is easily the best of the group. Sam Waterston plays Charlie Skinner, the ACN news division president, and always upset or solving dilemmas. Jane Fonda has a bit part as the owner of the network.

Within the second year, many controversial plots are hatched, shows are spawned, new issues to develop, and relationships to figure out. A show firing has caused a legal suit. Mac has had a situation get out of hand, and it is the 2008 election. Enjoyed this year.

Good stories and characters beyond the important social and political message. Bottom line: Between corporate greed and the worst of the Internet we're basically screwed. Maybe those viewing the series today will be motivated to do something to change things.,1482624000,,396,4.925373134328358

I was aware in the first several episodes that the topics, arguments and challenges that were presented were a reflection of true and pure Inspiration. Seeing the news today
December 2016, I shutter to hear what is being reported as 'news' because I can hear Sloan's speech to the glib website dweeb pointing out the obvious result of mass social media 'reporting'. Inspired writing, Mr Sorkin. I believe. I miss them all.",1482019200,,534,4.815217391304348

5887195,5,B00E3HDW3I,Love Jeff Daniels in this roll. Enjoying the political tension. Thankful to see the desire to hold to journalistic convictions and not bow to the shallow temporal desires of the masses to satisfy bottom line investors. If that were only true in the real world!,1482019200,,260,4.8
5887196,5,B00E3HDW3I,Admittedly being a bit of a political junky this is right up my alley. Amazing how much prescience is here though as we see the effects of the political scene 4 years ago on what we have created for ourselves .... And strangely enough both Trump and Sanders are mentioned in certain scenes.... But have very little to do with the current storyline. I'm currently in season 3 and wish it was still being produced. We could sure use it.,1481932800,,434,4.4375

5887236,4,B00E3HDW3I,"Sharp writing, as you'd expect from a Sorkin show. Nice to see shows dedicated to the workings of people who are smarter than we are. Docked a notch for dialog at time getting overly clever to the point of eye-rolling and for too much emphasis on soap-opera plot lines, which get out of hand in season 3.",1481587200,,304,4.350877192982456

5887255,4,B00E3HDW3I,I watched this in a post Trump win which was part therapy for me. What's astounding is that this was aired in 2012-2014 and if Aaron Sorkin could figure out all of these trends where was the DNC! It felt like Trump watched this show and designed his campaign based on it.  Highly recommend it but (spoiler alert) the ending is cheesy and not at all satisfying.  I'm guessing they wanted to nearly tie it all up.  Wish the show had lasted longer than 3 seasons.,1481241600,,460,4.325581395348837

Join The Newsroom as they uncover Operation Genoa and other intriguing stories.

5887416,5,B00E3HDW3I,Best TV series ever (equal to Seinfeld). It is hard  to find tv series where the characters are actually good people trying to do the right thing ethically and morally. And it is interesting to see what they are up against politically and financially. Reminds me of Atlas Shrugged by Ann Rand.

5887446,5,B00E3HDW3I,"Aaron Sorkin - is a smartist (I'm coining a new term, in other words, a smart artist).  West Wing, Newsroom, Sunset Strip are written with regard to the intellect as well as the second brain, the gut, with a unique and fast-paced kind of primal and personable realism.

How he can take a variety of assorted characters and throw them into a fictional stew without blurring the distinctions but blending them instead, amazes me.

5887450,4,B00E3HDW3I,"A very interesting glimpse into what maybe a national news room: The production of putting on the news, the ethical and moral questions, who makes decisions and who's in control. But, there's much too much screaming and confrontation in this show. The constant refrain between Will and his ex-girlfriend is too much. These are grown adults who can't get-over-it. Of course, they get back together in early on in Season 3 - very predictable! Acting to very good.

5887485,4,B00E3HDW3I,"Season 2 holds up pretty well, and I think was a net improvement on Season 1, which I thought was undermined by the corporate political back-stabbing sub-plot.  The characters have settled in and improved as their personal stories have developed.  I found Jim's sojourn with the Romney campaign amusing, and the Genoa arc (an anatomy of a blown war-crimes expose) was just fascinating.

For fans of The West Wing, still plenty of snappy Sorkinesque dialogue, though this time deployed in the service of elevating an institution a bit less worthy of the treatment.  Of course, the Newsroom of the title isn't a real one, but rather a fictional re-imagining built around the hypothetical ""What if a TV news show decided to do good journalism?"", or at least journalism that seems good to Sorkin et al.",1477526400,,798,4.888888888888889

It is also infused with a few more very interesting fictional storylines where there is a struggle to publish to the news without the proper vetting of reliable and truthful sources.

5887543,4,B00E3HDW3I,Great show that covers the election of 2011 and other political events and controversial subjects. The show was created and written by Aaron Sorkin who also created The West Wing. It shows how the newsroom staff investigates news stories along with the staffs' relationships with one another.

5887931,5,B00E3HDW3I,"Season 2 is the best of Aaron Sorkin. The season is devoted to one major plot -- how a serious news organization could get a major story so wrong due to human error. In the process it highlights what meaningful journalism could look like, and also provides informative views about contemporary issues. Though focused on 2012, it is wholly relevant to 2016. What made the show special is that it combined the best elements of ""West Wing"" with the fun and behind-the-scenes aspects of television production that characterized ""Sports Night,"" an under-appreciated two-season Sorkin gem.

Applause to Sam Waterston for portraying a likeable, supportive boss. Moreover, the ensemble cast was perfect for this genre. As far as news goes, the script was spot on!

A little too much IQ and not enough common sense? Maybe. I've never seen anything like this attempted on TV before. Brilliant.

Common sense:
Will  has a ""deep throat"" and Charlie has one too. How can anyone know that they are not the same person? That wasn't actually spelled out in the show but it was interesting to see how they gave themselves credit for double-checking something that could not, by it's nature, be double-checked.",1473638400,,634,4.651785714285714

5888043,4,B00E3HDW3I,Just love Jeff Daniels and his character.  Adore the interaction with Sloan and her character.  Not enameled with the plot line on chemical warfare in season 2 but still love the interactions among the actors. Looking forward to season 3.,1473465600,,238,4.925
5888044,5,B00E3HDW3I,Excellent TV.  Too bad it only lasts 3 seasons.,1473465600,,47,4.222222222222222

5888047,5,B00E3HDW3I,very informative and at the same time entertaining.,1473465600,,51,5.5
5888048,5,B00E3HDW3I,"One of my all time favorite shows! Sorkin's writing is intelligent and authentic and his characters have dimension and depth. The actors are uniformly first rate delivering the sometimes hilarious lines at breakneck speed when needed, especially Don and Sloane. During the three seasons, I found myself disliking people who I later learned to cheer for. Maggie's development and transformation are remarkable. The sets are first rate and the expert camera work which swept from scene to scene was very effective. When the last episode ended, I was very sad that there was no more to see.",1473465600,,587,5.061855670103093
5888049,2,B00E3HDW3I,The plot began to drag and some issues became redundant. Disappointing after Season I.,1473465600,,86,5.214285714285714

5888053,5,B00E3HDW3I,The characters and the drama drew me in.  I could relate to much of the action and wanted to see the show continue indefinitely. The characters became like family and I couldn't wait for next episode to see what happened.,1473465600,,221,4.525
5888054,4,B00E3HDW3I,"I've really enjoyed the newsroom season 2 but the first couple episodes lack a sort of dynamic the whole first season had. It later picks up, and gets the ball rolling. Overall I wouldn't say it was a let down, just not as good as the first season in my opinion.",1473465600,,262,4.1568627450980395

5888060,5,B00E3HDW3I,"Really enjoyed the entire show.  Jeff Daniels was great.  Sam Watterson is disconcerting as anyone but Jack McCoy, but that's my issue, not his.  I think the first season was the best but they are all good.",1473465600,,206,4.513513513513513

8600602,5,B00E3HDW3I,"Big fan of Aaron Sorkin's writing. Lot's of references embedded in the script to musical theater and theater in general (a whole lot more than the average person would get). Good character development. Sadly, the season ends with two main characters become engaged to marry which destroyed a wonderful tension generating device. Now it's rendered defunct. Kaput. Trashed. Impotent. Why even bother to watch season three?",1530576000,,420,5.378787878787879

8600609,5,B00E3HDW3I,"Absolutely loved the relevance of the stories, the strong characters, wit, everything.  I learned more about news broadcasting than I imagined could be involved.  I wish that a fraction of the intelligence, articulation, and - again - the relevancy portrayed this these three seasons enacted on an American cable channel.  Afterward, I checked YouTube for something similar. If only!  Many thanks to Amazon for carrying this excellent program on Prime Video.",1523145600,,458,5.408450704225352
8600610,1,B00E3HDW3I,Season 1 showed promise. Season 2 has gone downhill quickly. The extra F bombs thrown in by the new writers do little to make up for a poor storyline.,1521936000,,150,4.206896551724138
