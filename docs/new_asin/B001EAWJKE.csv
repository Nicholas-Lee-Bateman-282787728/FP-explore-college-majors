8297369,5,B001EAWJKE,"I have the privilege of working with many of the personalities/media members that are featured in this doc on [...]. I must say, this is my FAVORITE Boston Celtics doc of the Paul Pierce era. It gives me chills like Hoosiers did. Must watch for any NBA fan. The documentary story is told thru the media that covered the game and the players/coaches. The invention of podcasting was so new back then yet Justin Poulin (the ORIGINAL Boston Celtics podcaster) is featured throughout. So are many bloggers. This is a MUST WATCH!",1459209600,,524,4.706521739130435

8297371,2,B001EAWJKE,this is definately not what I thought it was going to be. I was looking for highlights from the regular season and playoffs but this has mostly yapping from fans and talk show hosts with a few highlights thrown in. look for a different dvd if you want mainly highlights.,1230249600,5,270,4.42
