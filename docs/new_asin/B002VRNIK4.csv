8382417,4,B002VRNIK4,"The Last Grenade is one of those little war/mercenary movies that for some reason, you just don't forget. I saw this movie while I was in the service and looked for it for many years. Was I surprised when it finally was released on DVD. Of course I bought a copy of the movie and it has been in my library for some time now. In fact, I think its about time I watch it again.",1423612800,2,374,3.9342105263157894
8382418,4,B002VRNIK4,"It's a good mercenary movie, though the film preview misleads in thinking who is the good guy. This is clearly a British movie made in the late 60's, but is still enjoyable. The ending may be a bit sad, but the movie gives a good feel about life as a mercenary.",1419206400,,261,4.137254901960785
