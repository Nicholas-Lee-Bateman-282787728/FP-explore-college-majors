7960729,5,B0000658B0,This is one of the few books I read as a kid. Even though it has been almost 20 years ago lot of the life lessons discused in this book guided down the right path. I hope to watch the dvd soon and will for sure have my kids either read the book or watch the dvd with me. Some lessons you don't want your children to learn on their own and this book contains a big list.,1228521600,,369,3.7435897435897436

Through peer pressure & need of acceptance Harold introduces drugs, alcohol, and night clubs into his life.  Winding up in Prison with 2 Life sentences,  harold explains how he  changes through Christ and how he manages to deal with violent prison life and is pardoned after 10 years!",1168905600,,594,4.5046728971962615
7960731,4,B0000658B0,"It's not a fancy hollywood feature film.  It's just a short tale about what a young man learns about life from a horrible experience when framed for murder.  Harold teaches us through his experience and turn-around that we are influenced by the people we choose to hang around and that under any circumstances, we are respnsible for for ourselves as human beings if our life is to have meaning.  A good movie for a classroom or a family to watch together.",1149552000,,455,4.592592592592593
7960732,1,B0000658B0,"We thought this book would deal with being pardoned by the law and the greater one being pardoned by God through faith in the Lord Jesus  Christ.

It was not what we had expected and we returned it for a refund for which we are very thankful",1141084800,,241,4.1063829787234045
7960733,4,B0000658B0,"I thought this movie was a great moral lesson for teens. I also think its great for teens and parents to watch together. I will watch this with my boys as they get older. Even our daughters can benefit from these life lessons.

A mans life expierences are the best teacher. This man lived a hard life, and some of it was unfair, but instead of trying to blame everyone else for his decisions, he stood up and decided to change what he was doing. There are so many excuses these days, it was refreshing to hear someone who was in the wrong spot, with the wrong people, admit that he knew better, and would do better for now on. I would definitly recommend this book or video for anyone with teens.",1125532800,,696,4.2727272727272725
