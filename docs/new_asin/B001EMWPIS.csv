8298858,1,B001EMWPIS,Bad audio quality,1496448000,,17,5.0
8298859,5,B001EMWPIS,"I was weary about purchasing this item after reading mixed feedback from others, but boy am I glad I went for it!  You cannot get this collection of 10 Disney classics anywhere else, and especially not for this great price!  It was VERY easy to change the language setting on the movies to English.  And the BEST part is that when you put the DVD in the player, the movie starts playing  IMMEDIATELY!  None of that ridiculous 20 minutes of advertising and FBI warnings that other DVD's force you to endure.  Just put the movie in, press ""audio"" on your remote to switch the language to English, and you're done!  LOVE IT!  I wish I could buy all my DVD's in Korean now!  Haha!",1300752000,,676,4.387096774193548
8298860,1,B001EMWPIS,"When I bought this through Amazon, the picture did not show the Korean symbols, and this was affirmed in the note the seller included in the box, with instructions on how to changed the alarming dubbed Korean to english (all the menus are also in Korean symbols).  It didn't work, however, and I have yet to get a refund!  Please note that this production may be great only if you speak (and preferably also read) Korean! Otherwise, save your money.",1242086400,,449,4.6
8298861,4,B001EMWPIS,"GOOD: It's a great set with all the classic movies that we wanted. The box is nice and I prefer it to 10 separate boxes. We were thrilled to get them all for less than $100.

QUIRKY: The menu is in Korean and the default audio is in Korean. The easiest work-around is if your DVD remote has an ""audio"" button. You can use that botton to toggle from Korean to English while DVD is playing.

FATALLY BAD: 6 of the 10 DVDs won't play in our Honda factory DVD player in the car. That's the whole reason we bought the set! They do play at home, but the car player doesn't recognize them.",1229299200,,582,4.0964912280701755
8298862,5,B001EMWPIS,"This is a great buy! I haven't been able to find these DVDs together in one set anywhere else. The main screens at the start are in Korean so it took a few minutes to figure out how to change the soundtrack to English, but once I did this, the picture quality and sound were perfect. I would recommend this to others.",1219449600,2,317,4.129032258064516
