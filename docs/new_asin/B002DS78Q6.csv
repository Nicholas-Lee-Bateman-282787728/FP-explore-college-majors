3912625,4,B002DS78Q6,"Magpul Art of the Tactical Carbine Volume 2 DVD

I opted to skip Volume 1 based on some feedback from other viewers that Volume 1 was too fundamental, but I have since ordered Volume 1. However, I watched Volume 2 through and through and picked up a lot of weapon manipulation skills that made a lot of sense. I've watched Art of the Dynamic Handgun first, and noted that the presentation and instruction was noticeably different. In Dynamic Handgun (1st Edition presumably), there's less humor, Haley and Costa pick on the Marines more often, and the production quality was different. I felt Dynamic Carbine Volume 2 was more professionally edited/filmed versus Dynamic Handgun.

In Art of the Dynamic Carbine, an important skill that is being taught will be highlighted by a small graphic that pops up and allows you to jot it down and review it in slow-motion in Disc 3. Haley and Costa make note that Dynamic Carbine is intended to teach weapon manipulation drills and skills, and not tactics. There are lots of drills like urban prone, dynamic prone, buddy skills, one-handed malfunction drills, etc... that may not apply to 95% of shooters that just go to a static range, but are useful to know or apply to LE/military that want to brush up their skills.

The first fundamental they covered was proper grip and stance. This is something I never learned properly, because all I could go from was standard military training/field manuals (books), magazines, articles written by Massad Ayoob and photographs of Soldiers engaging enemy targets in theater.

Haley and Costa picked on John, the shooter with the 2 point sling, quite often mainly because of his slow tactical reloads. However, it is more gear-related since his mag pouches were of a different design and his sling would require additional time to move around. This goes back to something I have noticed in this course and that is how Magpul Dynamics emphasizes the need for gear or skills that makes you work more efficiently. The reaction hand grip technique seems counterintuitive at first and goes against most military and law enforcement training, but the new Magpul AFG grip requires this type of position. It does appear more stable than a traditional magwell, VFG, or offhand grip as you are trying to mitigate recoil and muzzle movement in a dynamic environment versus tightening your groups.

I have noticed that Costa is better at speaking than Haley. Haley often talks too fast, but is still articulate. I can understand both of them clearly, but Costa is more like that Senior NCO that can somehow project his voice for a 5 mile radius.

The outakes are funny, but there are many funny moments during the actual training portion of the DVDs. The first 2 discs cover Days 1-3, and you will recognize many Magpul associates (like Drake or Dr. Drake from the Internet forums) as well as Aimpoint representatives. The Magpul shooters brought along a Masada/ACR rifle for the drills, which looks very different from the other AR15s. The fourth disc covers gear, but I felt it was way too broad and not very direct. They won't really call the optics or M4 rifles by the manufacturer's name, and they just give you general feedback on that type of gear. It is better to just hit the Internet and do a search for product reviews. But the point that Haley and Costa drives home is still valid, and that is each person is different and may prefer different types of gear.

Overall: 4/5 stars, not as mandatory for static shooters but contains useful drills for LE, Military, and competition shooters.  The fundamentals that are covered briefly in the first disc are the most important.",1324080000,,3654,4.8352

3912628,5,B002DS78Q6,"I didn't think it could have gotten better. It did. I think the best part of the series is that you see regular folks doing the exercises. You see seasoned pro's doing, making mistakes and learning. Phenomenal.

Following up Vol 1,Magpul delivers beautiful video production and focused content that is comprehensive and well communicated. Chris and Travis are definitely well versed in the art of the gun.",1286841600,,405,5.044776119402985

3912631,5,B002DS78Q6,"If you haven't seen/bought the first volume, you really should before moving onto the second volume as it expands on techniques and correct/modern form for those who shoot the AR-15/M-4/M16 platform, whether defensively, or professionally. I watched this after the first volume, and went back to the first volume feeling myself cheating the curriculum. This is definitely a must buy and a good gift for anyone deployed on the ground, whether they're a Pogue like me or one of the grunts on the front always on mission.
Even if you don't shoot and AR styled weapon, or even a long gun at all, it's educational to watch the tactical/combat applications of the drills demonstrated on either volume.",1268956800,,695,4.948717948717949
3912632,5,B002DS78Q6,"This is Magpul Dynamics second fora into the carbine training game on DVD and its better than the first. The training, drills and coaching is utterly amazing. And the most important things that allows Magpul to pull this off is the great production values. The way old training videos are was a guy on a dirt range talking to a camcorder. Even the better trainers' videos were mostly them talking to a camera with little actual gun play. Magpul with this series has found a great balance, they put out great information, go through many ways of accomplishing drills in a easy to understand manner. But they do it with great camera work and presence.

The highest praise I can give this is that my wife, who is a shooter, but not a lover of all things tactical, enjoy these DVDs. And I make that up to the fact that they are so easy to watch. The various cameras, the smart editing and the good interaction between the instructors and students. This is the best training video available on DVD. Will watching it make you the next super commando? Absolutely not, but they will give you a good understanding and a good number of drills to practice and work through. Hopefully before you sign up for a course and go to a class yourself. Well worth the cost of admission.",1246924800,5,1266,4.504347826086956

I don't have much to say except, ""get trained"".  These two sets will give you a clue about how little you probably know about self defense with a carbine.  You will get a lot of good knowledge.  But this is no substitute for hands-on training.  Find a good instructor. Go out to the range, and shoot.  Practice, practice, practice.  ""Practice doesn't make perfect.  Perfect practice makes perfect.""  These are perishable skills.  Even after getting the hands-on training, you'll still need to get out and practice to stay prepared.

Hopefully Amazon.com will start stocking these videos...

3912637,5,B002DS78Q6,An outstanding product that gives practical training in the tactical use of the carbine. Although I served in the Army in Vietnam this vidio greatly expanded my abilities when using the AR-15. The response time and delivery where very quick.,1345939200,,241,5.05

3912641,5,B002DS78Q6,This DVD set is very informative.  Great drills included in the 4 disk set.  This DVD set even goes over the basics and fundamentals of shooting.  What I would expect from Magpul.,1333756800,,179,4.53125
3912642,5,B002DS78Q6,"I bought this as a follow up to the first Tactical Carbine release.  Some of the material from the first DVD set is touched on again in this set, but only briefly.  The Volume 2 dvd set is more advanced work that is built upon the foundation that was covered in the first volume.
The training is exceptionally good in both volumes.
If you've ever been to a tactical carbine school, you'll benefit enormously from having these DVD's in your library as a refresher on points you might have forgotten.
The Art of the Tactical Carbine Vol 2 is excellent on its own merits even if it's the only volume you purchase.
Highly recommended.",1333670400,,630,4.517543859649122
3912643,5,B002DS78Q6,Having taken a couple of different rifle classes I will say nothing takes the place of going to a formal rifle class and getting some hands on training. However these DVDs are a great addition to the training I have taken. They offer some good insight into more advanced tactics.  The instructors are straight forward and their training style translates well to the DVDs.  This series is the best bang for your dollar and MagPul has proven again they they are leading the way in the field of tactical rifles. If you are going to practice these techniques start off with dry practice drills. Then when you are comfortable that you can pull it off with live ammo make sure you go at half speed. No faster than that until you are consistent and accurate. Have a buddy watch you and maybe even film you so you can see what you are doing right and wrong . Once you are confident that you have it down then go all high speed just remember that if you shoot off a body part it won't grow back so practice slow and smooth to smooth and fast.,1330560000,,1033,4.319587628865979

8365984,5,B002DS78Q6,"5 stars is 5 stars, but some areas of the set are lacking. The gear info sections are virtually worthless beyond them making the point that you need to suit your gear to the objective. They don't name any gear by brand nor do they explore various systems specifically; its just 'buy whatever you need for your specific application'. But the main bulk of the set is of course devoted to other things, and they do a good job with it. I don't quite agree with the barking-type manner of one of the instructors-- as if its not possible to convey maximum intensity if your neck veins are not bulging, but hey, to each his own. 5 stars for sure. Its a well produced set that while not covering tactics, gives a lot of drill examples, and after watching them you develop a strong urge to buy a 1-point sling and practice shoulder switching while firing from behind a barrier. Its a great 'mind set' lesson.",1414368000,,899,4.421686746987952
