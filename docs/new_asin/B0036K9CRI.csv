8390048,3,B0036K9CRI,"This is in some ways the classic Western with the name of the villian on a striken mans tounge just escaping his ability to utter it...pretty corny really.
There some real overdone attempts at humour that are pretty lame, even for the time. Still the story has some original twists and the editing is very good so the story is easy to follow.
  However the camerawork ...that is the lighting is pretty poor often being over exposed, or under exposed making it hard to really see the images very well, about 1/3 of the time. The music is sort of half and half. In one point of what should be a serious dramatic sort of tone they have more carnival or fair music.
  I wouldn't read the description of the movie on the box before watching the show...all too often they give away key points of the movie and spoil it. Though this isn't as bad as some in that area, I would still recomend just watching it first...hey that's what they did in 1922 anyway, so why not experience it that way. The movie isn't particularily long...(61 minutes) with no bonus's so if your looking for a rip roaring long movie, you might pass on this, but if your looking for a decent movie to add to your silent collection, overall this is a pretty good one.  There was some nice touches so it is worth watching again.",1330905600,,1291,4.384937238493724

Jack Hoxie, star of RIDERS OF THE LAW, was born in Oklahoma Indian Territory. The ex-rodeo champ arrived in Hollywood in 1913 and stunted in westerns until an observant producer gave him better roles. Often cast opposite Helen Holmes, a queen of railroad serials (along with Pearl White) and under the direction of Aussie-born J.P. McGowan, Jack was at that time known as ""Hart Hoxie.""

A supporting player in over 40 shorts and features, the newly-renamed Jack Hoxie finally got top-billing in 1920. With the advent of sound and advancing years however, Jack, who was nearly-illiterate and struggled mightily with dialogue, made only six more pictures before retiring at age 48. In 1965, he died in Kansas of leukemia, two months past his 80th birthday.

FILM SYNOPSIS--
In this five-reeler (dubbed from 16mm reduction stock), Jack and his companion (Rice) find a badly-wounded sheriff  (Lingham) and pursue the whiskey-smuggling perpetrators. The man's daughter (Sais, aka Mrs. Hoxie) believes Jack is a smuggler and has him arrested by a deputy (Harmon) who is actually the gang's chief. Hoxie, a U.S. Marshal in disguise, ultimately triumphs.
