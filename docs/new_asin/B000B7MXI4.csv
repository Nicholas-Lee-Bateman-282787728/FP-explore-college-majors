8082866,2,B000B7MXI4,I was expecting something a little more sophisticated that an adult could enjoy. I am sure it is a wonderful fantasy movie for a pre-puberty  crowd. I made it about 30 minutes into movie and decided that it was not going to improve. The young dragon was three stages away from being a purple BARNEY costume or one of Jim Henson fantasy creatures.,1511654400,,346,4.492063492063492
8082867,3,B000B7MXI4,"I wonder if this movie is a sequel to the 1994 movie ""Dragonworld"" that was produced in 1994 and is only available on VHS at this time or simply a retelling with some changes.  Both movies were directed by Ted Nicolaou.  Does anyone know?",1390608000,,238,4.386363636363637
8082868,2,B000B7MXI4,sorry this one disappointed...a younger age group may think it okay...just  a little broken up and poor effects etc...lacked continuity...quality of film was not up to par...seemed very cheap...might have had a salvagable story under better conditions and some characters needed more development...had hope for better quality of dragon and more dragon involvement...I thought it was a sequel to another movie that was much better story line and filming quality,1379289600,,460,5.571428571428571
8082869,4,B000B7MXI4,Years ago my husband and I saw this movie on on-demand. We couldn't believe how cheesy the graphics were. I mean for the time it was made they could have done better than a rubber dragon suit. We liked the movie. We mainly bought this because it was dirt cheap and then we could show people the cheesy movie really existed. Great Purchase!,1377907200,2,339,4.396825396825397
