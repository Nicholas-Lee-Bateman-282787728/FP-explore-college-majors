4241566,5,B00415Z9Y2,Ordered the DVD and put it in my DVD player and nothing happened. Tried my computer and the DVD worked. I wish I had known before I purchased the DVD that it was an import - even though the cover and packaging is in English this was the German version. The passion and heart that David Garrett puts into his music needs no translation. AWESOME DVD !!!!!,1314921600,,353,4.2835820895522385
4241567,3,B00415Z9Y2,"I purchased this item through Amazon from [...]. I was disappointed in the DVD cover graphics which were poorly printed difficult (if not impossible) to read.  The ""reproduction"" DVD is of mediocre quality...""OK"" but inferior to the original.  When I wrote the ""Seller,"" I received a less-than-polite response.  I would not order from this seller again. ~0:-(",1313971200,2,359,5.2631578947368425
4241568,5,B00415Z9Y2,"I bought this CD after seeing a song done on the Today Show one morning. I was in love!  I really do not like classical music but David brings it to a new dimension for me. The CD is great and I will probable have to get another before I wear out this one.  David, you rock!",1309824000,,274,3.789473684210526
4241569,5,B00415Z9Y2,Thank you very much!!I am very satisfied with my purchase. I got it very fast and dvd in great condition. I highly recommend you. Hope to make business with you again !!,1308009600,,169,4.3125
4241570,1,B00415Z9Y2,"Don't get me wrong I do enjoy David Garrett (here comes the however!) A few months ago I purchased a DVD and listened to his rendition of some of the rock classics.  All great.  Then I decided to purchase this DVD, thinking I might like to have it as background music when entertaining friends.  It's a yawner!  BORING.  I'm so tired of most of the music he picked... It's all been played over and over and over by anyone with talent.  He's young, attractive, seems to be compassionate and certainly talented, however, if he can't write his own music I'm not buying any more.

By the way, it's only 45 minutes long with two bonus songs ... not worth the money as far as I am concerned.",1302480000,7,685,4.346456692913386
4241571,5,B00415Z9Y2,"Judging by how much a play this CD, I guess it's one of the best ones I have.  Just love the tracks, all of them.  Hard to pick a favorite.  Thanks, David.",1301270400,6,155,3.78125
4241572,5,B00415Z9Y2,"We heard this presentation at a November, 2010 broadcast on PBS.  I was able to buy the DVD a few weeks later and also his earlier one(2009)where he speaks German.  Both are fantastic!

My wife is thrilled with his music.  I enjoy it thoroughly myself.  For the last few weeks we have watched one or the other DVD almost every night.

My wife plays the violin for a local orchestra and she is thrilled with his music.  She particularly enjoys his playing two or more chords at once.
Although I am not a musician, I enjoy it thoroughly myself.  He is amazing and one of his kind.  He also has a pleasant and friendly personality.

I just enjoy it all.  I wish that he had more DVDs available.  Yes, addictive is the word.  Music is said to be a hint of heaven.  This one certainly is.

His last piece, Hey Jude, is out of this world.  Pure enjoyment!  This DVD is highly recommended.",1295740800,26,882,4.3128834355828225
4241573,4,B00415Z9Y2,"Typically, David Garrett's concert DVDs are only available in the US through PBS pledge drives. The footage is the same as his German concert DVDs, but the American PBS versions are noticeably shorter than their German counterparts, and ""Rock Symphonies"" is no exception. However, this time around Decca has put more thought into the total package. David's first concert DVD seemed rushed into production, lacked any sort of interactive menus, and cut between songs with no warning and frequently no introductions (this was in part due to the fact that most of David's intros are in German for a German audience). On ""Rock Symphonies,"" the root menu is the same as the ""Rock Symphonies"" album cover, except the grey background rotates clockwise, giving the impression of movement. The ""Chapters"" menu features the promo photo of David standing on a rooftop with animated dark clouds sweeping across the sky. The ""Bonus Features"" menu is the close-up of David with eyeliner...gorgeous! There are two bonus tracks, ""Bicycle Race"" and ""Live and Let Die."" These can only be accessed from the ""Bonus Features"" menu and not the full concert, apparently. The ""Behind the Scenes"" feature is the same as the North American EPK for ""Rock Symphonies"" (just shy of 6 minutes).

Sound and picture quality are great (according to the back of the case, it's 5.1 Surround Sound and 2.0 Stereo). The biggest improvement over the PBS&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/David-Garrett-Live-In-Berlin/dp/B002D19EFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">David Garrett: Live In Berlin</a>&nbsp;is that the introductions flow smoothly into the songs, rather than cutting from song to song. There were actually more non-album tracks like ""Mission Impossible"", ""Peer Gynt,' ""Child's Anthem"" and ""Adagio in G Minor"" than ""Rock Symphonies"" tracks (""Kashmir,"" ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" ""Walk This Way,"" and ""Asturias""). Minus one star for leaving off David's smokin' cover of Metallica's ""Master of Puppets,"" which was hands-down one of the best covers on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rock-Symphonies/dp/B003O86MY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rock Symphonies</a>. Australian guitarist Orianthi really rocked out with David on the Michael Jackson medley, which saw David exploring ""Billy Jean"" and ""I'll Be There"" on the heels of last year's cover of ""Smooth Criminal."" It was also nice to see one song (""Zorba's Dance"") carried over from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/David-Garrett/dp/B001UW58WW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">David Garrett</a>&nbsp;album of last year. However, compared to the German Open Air Live DVD, there are only thirteen tracks (plus the two bonus tracks accessed separately) clocking in at just shy of an hour. It's too bad that they didn't include the studio interviews with David that were filmed as part of the PBS pledge special as bonus materials, seeing as this is a PBS exclusive.

Overall, the PBS ""Rock Symphonies"" DVD feels like Decca took more care with packaging and designing menus (using hi-res promotional photos from ""Rock Symphonies"" and adding animated backgrounds, for example). It's great to hear David add his own unique intros to the songs, like the stories about him being an ersatz drummer at a gig in London, or the story about when he was seventeen and a girl tried to kiss him on the beach. His connection to his fans is obvious...he dedicates one song to a ""couple in love"" in the audience, and he positively glows whenever he performs. If you're looking for the full David concert experience, by all means get one of the German versions: there'a a regular, Region 0 2DVD set, ASIN B003V89YT6 and a Blu-Ray version, ASIN B00415Z9Y2 at Amazon.de. With shipping and currency conversion, the German Open Air Live DVDs will run about twice what you'd pay for the US version, but it clocks in at 2 DVDs, 196 minutes and 28 songs total, far more than the 15 (!) on the PBS single-disc version.

4241599,5,B00415Z9Y2,"I've always suspected that  the sound-blasting of generations of  rock-""music"" have set the musical tradition back to prehistoric values; David Garrett has successfully demonstrated that Musical Skill can be enhanced by judicious sound volume, not drowned out or replaced by it.",1381881600,,278,5.7560975609756095

4241603,5,B00415Z9Y2,I love David Garrett.  I'm hoping to get tickets to see him in March 2014.  I ordered this Blue-Ray from Germany because it has more songs than the PBS DVD.  So excited I did.  The shipping was very reasonable and fast too!  It was fun listening to the dialog in German even though I don't speak the language.  Very excited to receive this and the audio and visual quality is outstanding.,1376697600,,388,4.394366197183099
4241604,5,B00415Z9Y2,"I am a recent fan Of David Garrett, having discovered him right here on amazon!  I love everything he does and needless to say I went a David Garrett shopping spree!  I bought some cds as well as some downloads and 2 concert videos!  This concert dvd is great.  Now I can see him whenever I want. Just love watching him play.  Don't know if I'll ever be able to see him live so this is the next best thing.  The quality of the video is good as well as the sound.  Not sure if there are different versions of the dvd as mine is in english.  I've seen some reviews where they say there's is in german.  Am looking forward to new music from him.  I love everything I've bought.  Beautiful music from a beautiful man!!!  I must say his band is great also.  Thank you.",1375833600,3,763,4.108843537414966

4241607,5,B00415Z9Y2,I first saw David Garrett playing the violin on WHY Channel 12 during a promotional fund raiser where he was a guest after the showing of him playing in Berlin at a concert.  It was wonderful to see a musician so talented and playing classical and rock and roll for an audience that was enraptured by his playing and his personality.  I ordered the dvd from Amazon but was disppointed that Metallica and another rock song he played was omitted from the disc.  I am hoping to get another disc that will include the whole concert.  I would recommend this disc to any music lover as he covers music from all realms.  His personality and interaction with the audience was splendid.  Made me love the violin all over again.  Very enjoyable.,1371168000,,735,4.564885496183206
4241608,5,B00415Z9Y2,David's music is appealing to all ages with his modern approach to classical music.  He inspires a younger audience to enjoy the classics such as Bethoven's 5th.,1368144000,,161,4.962962962962963

4241610,3,B00415Z9Y2,"While this is the full version of the concert performed in Germany (not the condensed English version available thru PBS), I would only recommend this to lovers of Garrett's music. Sound quality is OK, definitely not Blu Ray and Garrett only speaks in Deutsche. As a limited speaker of German I could somewhat interpret, however my 9 year nephew was a little confused after opening his holiday presents. He loves Garrett's violin playing which was a plus.

There are a few reasons why I suspect an illegal Chinese bootleg copy. While some of the song titles appear in English at the bottom of the screen, the only two choices for language subtitle selection through your DVD player is Chinese 1 and Chinese 2. There is no internal paperwork and the dirty cardboard flecks between the front cover picture and plastic are like nothing I have seen before. This leads me to believe the likelihood of an illegal bootleg copy.

This was sold by Amazing-Concert-DVDs Storefront and while they get a strong 5 of 5 rating, I was not that impressed.
I would ask Amazon to seriously investigate whether this is a Chinese bootleg copy being sold, as American standards do not
need to drop to this low in order to obtain possible illegal goods for a low price.",1360454400,8,1247,4.715596330275229
4241611,5,B00415Z9Y2,This was my first Garrett DVD I bought for my collection and I just love it. Is enjoyable for people of any age. I love the way he performs passionately his violin from beginning to end. Love all the tracks but love Hey Jude the most...was so awesome that everyone at the end started singing the chorus of Hey Jude. He knows how to rock the stage by just playing his violin. Well done Garrett!!!,1357776000,,395,4.28
4241612,5,B00415Z9Y2,"I discovered David Garrett on a special PBS broadcast.  PBS has brought many entertainments to America during their fundraisers.  Of course I didn't want to contribute $120 to get the DVD (I am already a member) so I went to Amazon and there it was.  The DVD and the CD so I purchased both.

He is a fantastic violinist and performs with a huge orchestra and his playing and arrangements are something new.  It is fast paced and nothing like symphonic music (which I love) and is really a new and thrilling sound.  You won't be disapointed if you like fast-paced exciting music.",1356912000,,578,4.563106796116505

I can't wait to have it in my hands, I hope it is released very soon. It is a shame that his concerts are mostly in Germany and Europe, I wish he could play in the US soon to be able to watch him.

4241620,5,B00415Z9Y2,"In the early 1970's I went to a concert in Cleveland Ohio and saw the Jefferson Airplane band. I had a near front row seat very close to the band's excellent violin player Papa John Creach. I was so impressed with his violin play that I spent most of the concert with my eyes glued on him, and not Paul Kantner and Grace Slick who are great artists themselves. I always loved violin play and Papa John was amazing. Recently, I watched David Garrett on Public Television and I saw how great a violinist he is, and he plays classical and rock music. So, I bought his DVD Rock Symphonies, and I am more impressed with his violin play each time I watch the DVD. The fact that he is the world's fastest violin player, along with his exceptional violin skills and ability, make the songs that he plays most enjoyable to listen too. It's not very common to have a great violinist play rock music. For me, it does not matter that David does not write most of his music. I am just thrilled to hear his violin play which adds a precise, refreshing, pure classical music quality to the rock music he plays. The violin is a great instrument to hear play, especially when alot of the music is rock.",1325289600,10,1185,4.342342342342342

His Rock Symphonies give you different look at his great talent and endlessly rising spirit. Great music!",1316476800,,255,4.953488372093023
4241623,1,B00415Z9Y2,Poor choice and just 50 minutes of content on DVD. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed with the offer on DVD even though I am fan of David Garrett,1315267200,,150,4.206896551724138
8412563,5,B00415Z9Y2,"I got 2 versions of this DVD.  One had about 27 or 28 songs - and the other one had 14  songs?  The covers were exactly the same!  I don't understand how this can be possible unless 1 is an illegal copy?  How do we know what we are buying?  I'm confused!

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE DAVID'S GARRETT'S MUSIC - HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE BUYING?",1493856000,,334,3.8955223880597014

8412566,1,B00415Z9Y2,"I don't really hate it. . . but the disc will NOT PLAY on any sort of drive. Even the PS3 wouldn't play the disc, and that plays other discs that other units won't play.
I was really, really looking forward to watching David Garrett perform & I wish I'd tried all the alternative players before time for returning the item ran out.
Yes, I checked the region (region free). Yes, I tried a variety of players (a portable Blu-ray/DVD/CD player; the regular Blu-ray player; the PS3) and none of them even registered there was a disc.

I am sorely disappointed.",1468886400,,556,4.5049504950495045
