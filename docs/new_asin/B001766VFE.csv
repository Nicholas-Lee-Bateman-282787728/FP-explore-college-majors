3167557,3,B001766VFE,"I was disappointed with the DVD as it was only 1 workout.  I bought it as I couldn't play the original VHS tape that I got with the Gazelle, but I thought it would've had more workouts.
The music was very low and I found Tony's constant talking irritating.",1319673600,2,256,4.224489795918367

8265009,5,B001766VFE,"I found a Gazelle at a bargain price at a garage sale awhile back, and as soon as I came home I searched Amazon for the complimenting workout tapes.  I had Tony Little's Target Training videos from the early 90's and he's a pretty motivating guy, so I was pretty excited to workout with the tape.  It offered a good work out, unfortunately the Gazelle was so large and bulky, I ended up getting rid of it because we had no place to store it.  If you are happy with your Gazelle and have a place to store it, this VHS gives you a good work out and helps keep you focused on working out.",1350691200,2,585,4.069565217391304
