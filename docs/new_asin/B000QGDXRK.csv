I'd blame most of the early confusion on the atrocious dubbing but in many instances of corny fu-viewing the bad voice-overs are part of the fun!  When a flick starts out with a group of 12-or-so people talking and they are all likely being voiced by 2 or 3 dudes one quickly wonders what in the hell is going on!  Hopefully my explanation of the plot will act as a guide one can follow if interested, though I'm likely flattering myself.

The film begins with an American fighter (John Ladalski, ""Armour of God"") in Hong Kong, looking to challenge fellas from local dojos in the hopes of landing a new master.  He knocks around a couple of dudes before Tang Wei (Bruce Li, ""Return of the Tiger"") gives him a friendly thrashing and accepts him as a student and roommate.  Soon, the unemployed Tang Wei gets a job selling health/life insurance for a company who wants him to go to a film studio and sign up famous-but-declining martial arts actor Chen Long (Sze Ma Lung, ""18 Fatal Strikes"") to a fat policy.  Of course, Chen Long's director set up the policy with high hopes of cashing in.  When the actor is injured trying to film his own stunts the insurance company sends Tang Wei to keep an eye on things and his natural talent is discovered by the director who adds him to the stunt team.  Complications arise on the set as a new fight choreographer (Dan Inosanto, ""Out for Justice"") enters the picture and the crew becomes increasingly jealous of Tang Wei.

I still wouldn't go so far as to call this movie good but it's neat and has some interesting things to say about a variety of films in the industry.  The character of Chen Long is likely spoofing Jackie Chan and this is a rare film when Bruce Li is NOT trying in any way to emulate Bruce Lee, yet his character is at odds with Mr. Lee's real-life student and friend, Mr. Inosanto.  This movie is directed by Bruce Li and is an interesting statement presumably meant to convey his displeasure at being a proponent of Bruceploitation!

Oh, yeah, the fights!  In typical Bruce Li fashion there are TONS of 'em. None are bad but they get better as the flick goes on, culminating in a couple of knock-down, drag-out rumbles!  I'm probably being a bit generous with 3-stars but the fights are good, the satire is interesting, though not fully developed, and... DAN INOSANTO!  The dude has far too few fights but provides the goods when called upon!  John Ladalski is also a good fighter with several brawls and his character grows on you as the film continues with him trying to keep the naive Tang Wei from being taken advantage of.

This disc is distributed by Martial Arts Theater with a full-screen (but decent) picture, no extras, and the aforementioned English dub.  No subs.  One could certainly do a lot worse but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it either.

1981.  aka:  Counter Attack",1319500800,2,2928,4.567049808429119

This movie is a true classic. A must have for Dan Inosanto (Bruce Lee's friend in real life) and Ho Chung Tao (Bruce Li) fans.
I rate this movie 5 stars-
great action!!

Fast fact: Dan Inosanto was born Daniel Arca Inosanto on July 24, 1936. He is a Filipino Martial Arts instructor who is a foremost authority on Jeet Kun Do (Bruce Lee's art).
