8624234,3,B00GLASWIA,"Informative but sometimes tedious. First occurrence ever of the tune ""Ma Na Ma Na"" made famous by the Muppets.",1522195200,,110,4.842105263157895
8624235,2,B00GLASWIA,This was a strange documentary that was presented as an exploration of social issues of Swedish youth but ended up being loosely related scenes of what seemed to be a little more than randomness and naked coeds running around.,1439164800,,226,4.82051282051282
8624236,3,B00GLASWIA,"What was titillating in 1968 is boring today. This ""documentary"" goes out of it's way to belabor the suicide problem in Sweden in between girls in bras and obviously staged footage.",1419638400,,181,4.870967741935484
8624237,4,B00GLASWIA,"I was pleasantly shocked that this was a good quality print of the Italian Mondo Boobies series.  I got it mainly for Umiliani's  beautiful soundtrack which is decently represented here. It seems a little speeded up, as if it was transferred from a foreign-region disc, and by the way this is a dvd-r, which should be clearly posted here.
I'm looking forward to these guys releasing ""Angeli Bianchi Angeli Neri"" if it turns out to be possible.",1392163200,2,443,4.740259740259741
