faces, his comes to understand that his anger only makes things worse.
This is such a good story, with catchy tunes the kids will love.  It is Junior's
friend who often helps Junior see a different perspective that might work
better than his anger seems to.  Junior's parents seem believable, and give
wise counsel to Junior.  His sister is good balance of how we all have much
to learn.  This sister seems mostly self-centered. So, through the progression
of this story, we see,  a realistic view of life. If you have kids,  you have likely
seen this anger burst out. And you have wondered how to help your kids learn
a better way of coping and responding. This DVD is entertaining, but God will
use it to plants seeds into your child's heart, and they will just enjoy watching
this cute DVD.  The green Junior's Giants - Envy Thou Not is also very good.
My 5, 7, and 9 year old grandsons are just at the right age for this!",1437350400,2,998,4.450549450549451

The story is light on spiritual truths but comes fast and furious with zany, laugh-out-loud jokes. Lots of fun for the kids.",1409184000,,263,4.176470588235294

8356061,5,B0028DRGD6,"Teaches about the concept of learning to control the monster emotion of ""Anger"". My 5 and 8 year old were able to relate to it. As an adult it seemed alittle silly, but it present the message I was trying to get across to my two children that were having some anger issues, mostly not getting their way or losing something that they had (or fearing they would).",1336780800,,361,4.323529411764706
