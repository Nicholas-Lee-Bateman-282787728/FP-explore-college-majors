8423791,3,B004CYF7CQ,This was apparently filmed closer to the beginning of the series. The kids were in the audience and were still little. It was interesting to see how some of the characters have evolved since this was made,1373241600,,204,4.54054054054054
8423792,5,B004CYF7CQ,"I enjoyed the interview very much. I watched it once I saw the last season, several seasons later. Yet it really gave a good concept of how the show's twists and turns came about, and the original concept of the show. I can't wait for Jenji to come up with something new. I will be turning in to her creativity!",1367280000,2,311,4.2
