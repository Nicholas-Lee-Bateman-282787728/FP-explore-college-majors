This DVd will make you think carefully of this possibility and how there is not much we can do about it. Highly recommended DVD.",1374364800,2,420,4.3164556962025316

It starts with the warning that this only a 'scenario' so you shouldn't confuse this with Orson Welles' radio broadcast of ""War of the Worlds.""  Then, they show some people, like Mike Davis, who really know about the issue but then they don't really let them speak specifically about what needs to be done.  In the end, the show oddly turns vaguely optimistic that the authorities will do something--which, frankly, seems woefully out of sync with what they had to say in the beginning and, to be honest, reality.",1170979200,5,608,4.663551401869159
