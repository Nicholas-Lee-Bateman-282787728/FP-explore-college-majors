8208140,1,B000T9D6EY,"The DVD focuses on very few areas that appeal to most visitors.  Instead, too much time is taken promoting special vendors that (undoubtably) pay for the privilege of being in the film.
So much potential with SO little value.",1454112000,2,225,4.769230769230769
8208141,4,B000T9D6EY,"We learned quite a bit about New Zealand from this travel type video. Excellent! I was torn whether to give this 4 or 5 stars, it depends on if you want a travel log or documentary approach to learning about the country. This is more of a vacationers travel log.",1220227200,4,262,4.26
8208142,1,B000T9D6EY,"Very little coverage of the vast and numerous highlights of this beautiful country. Way too much focus on a few specific lodging, dining, and recreation providers and too little on the wonderful places to see and things to do. The advertisements for one of the largest on-line travel companies are the best example of the commercial rather than informational nature of this DVD. Very dissapointing.",1215129600,14,398,5.138461538461539
8208143,4,B000T9D6EY,"A good DVD if you want an overview of New Zealand, doesn't go into great depth on anything, but on the whole its a good watch.",1213833600,2,126,3.8846153846153846
