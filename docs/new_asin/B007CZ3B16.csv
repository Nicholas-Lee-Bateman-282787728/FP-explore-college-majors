8514844,4,B007CZ3B16,"Valeria Lynch did not have the reputation of an Amanda Miguel or Estela Rabal, yet she managed to produce such hits as ""Como una loba"" and ""Que ganas de no verte nunca ms"".  She also could belt out a Tango with the best of them.  Unfortunately, this recording of a live performance does not find her on top of her form at the beginning of hte concert. Once she warms up, she lives up to her star status.  The DVD also offers several extras such as a backsatage visit and a ""history of Valeria"".  I was lucky to have seen her at Luna Park in concert.  This is an unforgettable souvenir of one of my favorite artists, and a historical live recording.",1368662400,,648,4.278688524590164
