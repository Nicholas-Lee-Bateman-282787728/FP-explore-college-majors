8739393,4,B017I248LO,"I just completed this workout less than 10 minutes ago. I am 5'9.5"" and about 135 lbs. I am making barre my regular workout.

The last workout I completed was Physique 360, and I can see some similarities with a talkative instructor, a bit of similar floorwork and horrible cool down music. This is definitely one for toning the abs, and it's nice that it only uses a set of light weights and a mat.

Pros: 30 minutes, only need mats/1-3 lb handweights, very creative moves, neutral music, informative instructor. I also almost instantly felt the workout in my abs!

Cons: Very ab-focused, horrible cool down music.

Overall, I really like this workout. I won't use it too much since I do not want an ab-centric workout, but I really enjoyed the creativity. This is one of the hardest barre workouts that I've done. I hope they release more!",1447113600,10,841,4.624161073825503
