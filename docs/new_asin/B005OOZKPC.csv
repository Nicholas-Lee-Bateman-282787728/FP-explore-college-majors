4854347,4,B005OOZKPC,"This movie will remind you of ""While You Were Sleeping."" The brother isn't in a coma but the younger brother falling for his older brother's ""girl"" is the same. This brother also is too interested in another woman and thinks very highly of himself. The younger brother keeps praising the older as in ""While You Were Sleeping."" The marriage preparations get farther along in the movie, but all turns out well in the end.

There are a few references to other Bollywood figures (SRK) and movies. However this would be a good intro to Bollywood movies. It's age appropriate for teens and up. Dimple, the female lead, gives sleeping pills, a lot of them, to one character. That might be hard to explain to younger children. Also there's some drinking, including a binge fest. There's also minor smoking.

If you liked ""While You Were Sleeping"" check this movie out.",1323216000,5,860,4.76510067114094
4854348,5,B005OOZKPC,"Those of you who love the filmi dialogues and acting that a good Bollywood flick provide will enjoy this film. Imran shines as the chocolate hero Khush to the free-spirited and loveable Katrina - Dimple. While the premise of boy meets girl while searching for a bride for his brother and then falls in love with her is formulaic, the film is anything but. Sure there is some of the typical Bollywood twists and turns, but the film continually surprises by throwing a creative solution to a problem. The music numbers are catchy and fun, and the cinematography is fresh. You won't be disappointed!",1320883200,2,596,4.740384615384615

4854352,5,B005OOZKPC,"If you have never seen a Bollywood film before, this is a good one to try out. It is a silly Rom-Com with a silly plot and has a lot of unnecessary song and dance sequences, but it is all done very well and is very fun to watch. Katrina Kaif is simply stunning to watch and Imran Khan is the perfect comedic, yet sincere, counterpart.",1422144000,,334,4.075757575757576

I first saw it on netflix, I thought the story was funny, it really entertained me and I ended up really liking it, even the song and dance numbers. So I brought the movie on Amazon like a month later. Now it's one of my favorite comedy films. Only thing I didn't like was It's a little long for this type of story, other than that,  I've already recommended and watched with a few friends, that also liked it.",1366243200,,462,4.25

4854362,5,B005OOZKPC,"This is a real crowd pleaser of a film.  The music is upbeat,colorful and enjoyable. The story is about 2-brothers-1 that suddenly decides (after a break up)that he should settle down and get married. Brother#1 asks for Brother #2 to help him do this. Brother #2 gets everything prepared and set up for brother #1. The story revolves around the setting up of this arranged marriage. It is fun, joyful, wonderful family characters,fun-loving and very charming. So far I have recommended this movie to 3-people and they All loved it! I think you will too.",1350950400,,553,4.821052631578947
4854363,2,B005OOZKPC,"This story started well.  I like Katrina Kaif and Imran Kahn.  But after the intermission, it just went downhill.  The scheming and shenanigans that were supposed to be funny and charming just fell flat.  Both actors are better than the ridiculous plot that drove the movie to the end after the intermission.",1349481600,,308,4.865384615384615

4854365,5,B005OOZKPC,"This is a very sweet, feel good movie. Everyone ends up happy in the end and the characters are funny and adorable. Katrina Kaif has an excellent blend of quirkiness and independence that makes you want to be in her shoes. The songs are great and the antics will keep you laughing throughout!",1331510400,,292,4.528301886792453
4854366,5,B005OOZKPC,"This is not the first time that this story has been unfolded on the silver screen. In fact, the producers did not want any of the viewers to assume that it was indeed some ground breaking plot that they had thought of, which is why they actually announced the plot through the very title of the movie.
So if it is NOT a new idea then what is good about it? First, the presence of Katrina and Imran adds such dignity and charm of eras gone by as makes the viewer part of the goings on. Katrina is not only a goddess in the looks department but also her spontaneity with comedy and her ability to emote make her a true deserver of the global success and adulation she enjoys. Imran Khan is evolving a certain style of acting which not many leading actors have had - underplaying and underacting. On celluloid, underacting is a very powerful style of acting as was proved for decades by Dilip Kumar. I also like the boy's ""sharifness"" and wish that he becomes the role model for today's rambunctious and arrogant youth and helps mellow them down. The movie is charming and entertaining and the pace never slackens. The music is not great but a few numbers are surely foot tapping. Had at least one song been a maga chartbuster this movie would have raked in a lot more mullah for its producers. Ali Zafar with a Punjabi lilt to his diction is a natural comedian. He has in some scenes expressions which are typical of a stand-up comedian who has broken into movies (I do not know if he ever was a stand up comedian) but that is not necessarily (at least for me) a bad thing. The three of them, it is clear from the way they look and act on screen, must have had a ball while shooting for the movie, which is what the audiences always sense and admire. It is a charming movie about normal people of our generation who have fun filled and happy lives.",1329436800,7,1846,4.322766570605188
4854367,3,B005OOZKPC,"Katrina Kaif is again brilliant and natural here after ""Zindagi na milegi dobara"" .Her scooter stint with Imran may remind you of Roman Holiday starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck. She is quite like a little girl in some scenes truly enjoying herself seem very spontaneous rather than flat acting. Camera seems to love her. In the starting she may not be as good but as the movie progresses her character too blooms. Her first scene is quite funny where she serves tea to Imran who first stares blankly at her then gets really freaked out  and shocked and drops tea on his pants. Film is quite well written not stupid like recent movies. Songs just come and go.

.At PVR Phoenix a strange thing happened like in Harry Potter they had regurgitating toilets. Whole Washroom overflowing. Really weird how did that happen?",1327968000,,823,4.748251748251748
4854368,4,B005OOZKPC,"Halfway thru, just when I thought I knew where this movie was going, it pulls off an unexpected swerve. Unexpected in that if you've been eyeballing Bollywood for a while and so recognize its patterns and sensibilities. Indian cinema, more often than not, caters to the common denominator audience. And viewers of Bollywood, Tamil, Telugu, and others of the vast Indian film industry anticipate over-the-top caterwauling and soap opera histrionics. Not so much with this one.

You've seen the plot to MERE BROTHER KI DULHAN (""My Brother's Bride"") before, I know you have. Heck, even John Wayne did something similar in NORTH TO ALASKA. In a nation which boasts match-making as its national pastime, fledgling film director Kush Agnihotri (Imran Khan) is coaxed by his older brother Luv (Ali Zafar) to seek out the perfect bride for him. And Luv intends to get married by Christmas. After several dead ends, Kush finds a promising prospect, a lovely girl from a respectable family. Her name is Dimple Dixit (Katrina Kaif) and on the surface she seems like the traditional Indian girl. But tradional Indian girls don't get labeled a ""high fashion wildcat."" They certainly don't sabotage the college bus or get arrested for staging an impromptu rock concert. Dimple is a free spirit, except that a free-spirited girl pretty much equates to persona non grata in India.

Refreshingly, Dimple's parents are those tremendously understanding ones. Rather than putting their foot down, they've allowed her to sow her wild oats. And Dimple, now 27-years-old, is willing to reward this indulgence. She's ready to settle down. Except that there's still a bit of the rebel peeking out. But a match is made: Dimple to wed Luv. But with Luv living in London, it'll take a few days for him to get to India, leaving time for Dimple and Kush to hang out. And in a romantic comedy, you know what that means.

In your typical Bollywood story, Dimple and Kush would weep and wail and bemoan their star-crossed fate and the parents will get into it as well. There may even be an evil third wheel somewhere, plotting dastardly stuff. But MERE BROTHER KI DULHAN isn't populated by derivative villains. I like that Kush and Dimple own up to their love for each other. They maybe should've confessed this before Dimple got officially engaged, but whatever. See, Kush has a plan, and if his plan is executed just so, there's a good chance everyone'll walk away from this with a happy ending.

Old nostalgic fogey that I am, sometimes I miss those musicals from the 1930s, '40s, and '50s something fierce. Nowadays when I'm jonesing for a musical film, I inevitably turn to Indian cinema, a sprawling, bustling film industry in which the song & dance is alive and flourishing. Given, I wouldn't call Imran Khan and Katrina Kaif top notch dancers, and most of these actors lip synch to the songs anyway. But stuff like Bollywood movies just seem more alive and exuberant and invested than most anything you'll find in a Hollywood venture. MERE BROTHER KI DULHAN is a breezy, madcap romantic comedy. It's not the best of its kind. But it is pretty darn good.

Katrina Kaif energizes the film, and it's weird for me to say that because the last few films I've seen her in, she'd been stuck in a rut. But here she's allowed to sink her teeth into her role, and it's one that she hasn't had a chance to do before. Katrina Kaif is vibrant here, demonstrating a bubbly and fun side to her personality. It's just gratifying to see her branching out to something different. Imran Khan continues to mine that likable quality he's got. He's pretty much reprising what he did in the terrific&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaane-Tu-Ya-Jaane-Na-2-DVD-Set-Bollywood-Movie-Indian-Cinema-Hindi-Film/dp/B001IDMLPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na (2 DVD Set) (Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema / Hindi Film)</a>. Just like in JAANE TU... Imran is our point-of-view reactor, responding to Katrina's zaniness with perceived aggravation while secretly not minding that much. One letdown about his character is that he's introduced as a budding film director, except that there's really no payoff to this. So what was the point of that? MERE BROTHER KI DULHAN is another in a line of ""modern"" Bollywood romantic comedies. It strives for a sense of hipness and sophistication. Its central characters are very much in tune with contemporary sensibilities. I had a good time watching it. And the musical numbers aren't too shabby, either.",1323388800,,4546,5.056
