This video helped me lose weight and tone up.  Like one of the other reviewers said, it was a bit tough starting out, but I stuck with it.  It really helped  The only bad comment I could make is that it doesn't come in a DVD format.  I wore out my original video , I am happy to have found it again!  The shipping will cost more than the video, so I guess that's two bad things!  LOL",1478217600,,535,3.8796296296296298

7867388,4,6304273924,"I found this video in my local library.  It was my first exercise video.  If I remember correctly, it was about a 45 minute routine, including warm-up and warm-down, plus a little segment at the beginning with advice about your target heart rate and other good exercise practices.  It's all low-impact, but energetic enough to generate some sweat.  If you're just starting to get in shape, you might not be able to finish it at first -- I didn't, the first few times -- but that's OK.  Also, it might take a couple of viewings to get all of the dance moves right unless you're a quick study.  The one reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that the music is uninspired, although it has a beat and works fine for exercise.  Anyway, this is a good video to challenge beginners with some creative moves.",1094256000,2,812,4.445945945945946
