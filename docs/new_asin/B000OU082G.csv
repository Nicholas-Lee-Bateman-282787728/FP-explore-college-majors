2799646,2,B000OU082G,"I have a real problem with this film because I know what it was trying to achieve and for all means of discussion it should have been able to get there.  The script itself is decently penned, while not truly revolutionary.  It pales in comparison to its closest comparison, ala Sophia Coppola's brilliantly crafted `Lost in Translation', but it still should have been able to transcend its familiarity and deliver some goods.  The overall direction is a bit shoddy, almost like its lost true grip on where the film was headed.  There are some scenes that feel so out of place that the film itself comes off a bit lost.  And speaking of out of place leads me to Parker Posey.  I am a huge fan of Parker and she was the reason I grabbed this of the shelf at my local video store and decided to give it a try.  As much as I love her she comes off way too awkward here.  There are quite a few scenes where she seemed so detached from her character it was painful to watch.  Maybe I just have to watch it a few more times to appreciate her performance but upon my initial glance I'm left cold.

The film doesn't know if it wants to be dramatic of comical and in the sheer confusion it fails to deliver on either level.  Like I said, I know what Cassavetes was trying to accomplish here, and that makes it ever more disappointing for me to watch her fail at it.

So Parker Posey plays Nora, a thirty-something hotel worker who can't seem to find a good man.  She has failed relationship after failed relationship and the one good man she could have had she set up with her best friend Audrey who is now unhappily married to him.  Nora's mother would love to see her daughter finally settle down, but the truth of the matter may be that Nora is not ready for it, at least not until she finds herself.  So yes, this is one of those `coming of age' type films for the middle age woman.  Supposedly most women are supposed to be able to see themselves in Nora, but I can't really judge as I am not a woman myself.  My wife thought this was ridiculous and abhorred the film, so I don't know if that says anything, but she's not middle aged and never struggled to keep a man so what does she know, right?  Regardless, Posey to me drops the ball here.  Scarlett Johansson did a much finer job with ultimately the same character in `Lost in Translation' (yes I know the age difference and setting is far from the same but the whole `finding the right person, finding yourself' type void is found within both characters).

One shining light in the midst of the film is the performance of Drea de Metteo as Audrey.  I've loved Drea since her Sopranos days and here she comes off so naturally that I wish they would have given her the role as Nora.  I feel she would have handled it much better.  I also enjoyed Justin Theroux as Nick, the actor jerk that ultimately starts the downward spiral that is Nora's journey to self appreciation.  I liked his character and feel that a further fleshing out of his relationship with Nora could have proved more suitable for the film.  The departure into foreign territory (literally) with the introduction of Frenchman Julian was just a bit unrealistic.  His character was just so clich&eacute;d to me.  He had no purpose other than to help Nora find her purpose and Poupaud did absolutely nothing to make Julian even the slightest bit attractive (emotionally that is).

So, this is no `Lost in Translation', and that's not to say that it had to be, but it could have been better than it is.  Zoe Cassavetes certainly has the talent running in her blood, but unlike her friend and fellow golden child Sophia Coppola she was unable to bring her A-game to her debut film.  `Broken English' goes to prove that personal projects (as in based off life experiences) don't always translate as beautifully as we'd like them to.  Maybe next time she'll try something different.",1189468800,6,3892,4.43943661971831
2799647,5,B000OU082G,"BROKEN ENGLISH has so many of the elements of films that are becoming difficult to find these days - superb intelligent script, a story that is frankly what it is instead of an overdone parody of itself, a director who knows how to pace a storyline to keep it compelling, and a cast of first class actors who have the gift of diving right to the core of characters we all meet every day and making us care about them. Writer/director Zo Cassavetes may be young in her trade, but she here gives evidence that she clearly knows her way around creating fine movies!

Nora Wilder (a mesmerizingly fine Parker Posey) has looks, a good job as a client relations director of a smart New York hotel, but she is now in her thirties and in comparison to her friends she is a social wasteland. She simply cannot find a satisfying relationship in this time of fast one night stands.  Her mother (Gena Rowlands) is supportive of her plight and her best friend Audrey (Drea De Mateo, proving that she indeed is a fine actress) who is supposedly in a 'good marriage' with Mark (Tom Guinee) understands her needs and is willing to help, but all Nora can end up with  are losers like mouthy actor Nick Gable (Justin Theroux) and morning after hangovers - until she encounters Frenchman Julien (Melvil Poupaud). Julien sees and appreciates Nora for who she is and while Nora seems on the brink of having found the perfect guy, her past history of failed romances prevents her from staying in the moment.  But when Julien must return to Paris (seemingly the door of exit for yet another mismatch), Nora eventually gathers her courage and accompanied by Audrey sets off to Paris in hopes of joining the effervescent Julien. In Paris the two women search but cannot find Julien, but what Nora finds is herself - and that is rewarded by a climax that brings the film to a satisfying close.

Though Parker Posey has given us some excellent independent film roles in the past, nothing can match the magic she brings to this role.  In fact the entire cast is so fine and so well motivated and directed by Cassavetes that every detail of the film is polished and shines like a the little triumph the film is.  Highly recommended.

2799648,3,B000OU082G,"Like father, like daughter. As the daughter of maverick indie filmmaker and actor John Cassavetes and actress Gena Rowlands, first-time director/screenwriter Zoe Cassavetes has a pedigree that inevitably comes with exalted expectations. Interestingly, you can see traces of her father's recognizably low-budget, improvisational-feeling style in this 2007 character study masquerading as a romantic comedy. She's fortunate to have recruited the wonderful Parker Posey to portray Nora Wilder, a confident guest-relations manager at a luxury boutique hotel who is also a neurotic thirty-something concurrently longing for and repelled by the thought of a long-term commitment with a man. What makes this film a bit meatier than an episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City/dp/B000ASDFJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City</a>&nbsp;is in the idiosyncratic ways Posey informs her multi-layered performance as she attempts to show a flailing dignity in the face of every possible humiliation she could suffer as a single woman within her married social circle.

The rest of the film does not quite measure up to Posey, as Cassavetes has her going through the paces of dating men particularly bad for her until by happenstance at a co-worker's cocktail party, Nora meets Julien, an affectionate Frenchman who appears quite smitten with her. They naturally embark on a weekend fling that neither wants to end. The rest of the movie plays out in a predictable pattern but with some odd quirks along the way. The result is not a misfire. However, there seems to be a desperate reliance on Posey to bring it all home, which she does handily. Still, there is a charming performance by the charismatic Melvil Poupad as Julien, and he makes Nora's attraction understandable even if the script does not allow him to counterbalance the film.

As married best friend Audrey, Drea de Matteo plays a frustrating character drawn strictly by the numbers, while Justin Theroux manages to exude smarmy conceit as the self-absorbed actor who manipulates Nora.  Cassavetes conveniently has her mother play Nora's meddlesome, well-heeled mother with a not-quite-present Peter Bogdanovich as her second husband. The film drags somewhat in the last third, and the ending is both pat and familiar given all that has come before. Still, it's hard to resist Posey excelling in such a fully dimensional role. There are quite a few extras on the 2007 DVD - a fifteen-minute making-of featurette, a thirty-minute episode of HDNet featuring extensive interviews with Cassavetes and Rowlands, and about sixteen minutes of deleted scenes, two of which are comically awkward encounters at the opening cocktail party with an urbane married older man (Griffin Dunne) and a friendly lesbian (Nadia Dajani).",1188086400,2,2835,5.588372093023255
2799649,5,B000OU082G,"Have you ever known that you would just love a movie without having seen it or heard anything about it? I was at Best Buy and I just saw the cover and recognized Parker Posey and bought it without thinking, a little impulsive. Or maybe I just always expect great things from Parker. From the beginning lyrics and opening scene I knew I was in for a treat.

Parker plays Nora Wilder, an average twentysomething female just kind of living her life, but not loving life. In the opening scene we see her get ready for a dinner party and she is walking around anxiously. Sipping red wine and staring at herself in the mirror we can tell that she is a little broken. She is beautiful but she doesn't know it. She is unsure of herself and is afraid.

All of her friends seem happy and Nora just kind of tip toes through life. She dates but nothing ever goes her way, though no fault of her own. She just wants to be truly loved, but she has no love for herself. Nora reminds me of myself and I am sure every woman has a little Nora in her.

But one night Nora bumps into a man that takes a notice to her and through all her fighting and insecurities she submits and lets herself get swept away. But she is so desperate for someone to love her that she has put a wall up because she is ultimately afraid of getting hurt and this has created somewhat of an anxiety disorder. There is a great scene that shows just how vulnerable she is. She is having dinner with a man and thinks that he is mad at her so she excuses herself to the bathroom and starts to yell at herself for making a mistake. She ultimately ruins the evening because she has to run home to take medication for her anxiety.

The plot thickens when she falls in love with the mystery guy but he is only in town for a few days and he is leaving for Paris soon. Will she stay or will she go? She needs to decide what her life has become and what makes her happy.

This is a long movie- and I enjoyed every second of it. This is a movie about an insecure woman who is coming to grips with her insecurities and her emotions and decides to take charge. But this isn't an overnight solution- it takes time and heart. Broken English really touches at reality and our real relationships with ourselves. We don't always  hold our head up high and we often try to go through life unnoticed. But in the end the message is clear- to be loved we must learn to love ourselves.",1187740800,78,2418,4.167023554603855
2799650,4,B000OU082G,"Nora (the usually whacked-out though always effective Parker Posey) is a late 30's Guest Relations manager in a groovy NYC hotel. She is at the end of her rope relationship-wise having spent the bulk of her romantic life avoiding love and having love avoid her. We all know a Nora: hungry for a man, a relationship but when a ""good catch"" (whatever that means to Nora) comes near, Nora thinks of a hundred reaasons why it wouldn't work and retreats behind the emotional wall she has psychically built for herself: a wall of regret and lame excuses held together with the cement of many years of tears and self-loathing.
Her mother, Vivien (the National treasure and director Zo Cassavetes' mother as well, Gena Rowlands) encourages her to grab life by the neck and shake it until it releases something good and so Nora, uncharacteristically attends the party of one of her co-workers and in the process meets a laid-back, good-natured Frenchman, Julien (Melvil Poupaud of ""Time to Leave"") whose ""Broken English"" has Nora confusing his saying ""I'm hungry"" with ""I'm Angry.""
Nora and Julien spend an idyllic weekend in New York and director Cassavetes manages to avoid all the usual clichs as Nora basically freaks out, pulls back and unfurls again both emotionally and physically while Julien watches, reacts in a calming, encouraging manner much to Nora's surprise who is both attracted and repelled by Julien's coolness.
""Broken English"" is a small film not likely to attract much attention but that would be a shame because what Cassavetes has managed to do is to make not only the ridiculous sublime but to also make, in it's quiet, well observed way... the sublime human and believable.",1182988800,39,1690,4.933333333333334

But I did not pick this film to watch because of her.  In fact I almost didn't watch it. So glad I did.  This film is so real, and so soulfully grainy (even the camera work and quality of the cinematography is that way)... it hits home for me, who at age 40, is awkwardly puzzled by the search to find lasting love, dating, online dating, etc.  I just feel worn out and harassed by it all at this point. Parker plays this character and this dilemma to a T.  Its actually so real that there were moments where I was squeamish and uncomfortable.  Basically, she's a woman in her late 30's whose life is alright, but certainly didn't go as she dreamed it would.  She's sort of depressed, but still giving life a go, all the while still drinking and smoking, and probably taking some kind of anti-anxiety meds. You get the feeling that she's met a sort of apathy with life and the search for love, but in private moments, shes quite distressed about it all. She does meet someone, who for a brief moment, brings some fresh magic into her life... Which was just the recharge she needed... and i won't say anymore about the plot.
Its really refreshing to see a film like this... Well done, great acting, realistic story, funny, a lil' tragic, poignant.... hopeful. Not a hollywood ending. This is a film about the search for love, the emotional brutality of that search, the armor we erect against love, and the ultimate realization (some would say spiritual epiphany) that the love we truly are seeking comes from within...And if we go for that kinda love... all else follows.",1414627200,2,1697,4.458064516129032

2799726,5,B000OU082G,"How this movie is not more widely known and recognized, is beyond me. This was by far a 5 star view, and if I could rate it 10 stars, I would. Parker, who plays Nora, does a magnificent job as the lead role of a somewhat hard-to-portray character. Nora is one of those women who put a lot of pressure on falling in love- essentially finding that right person, sticking to them, and living out a relatively ordinary, organized, no-frills life. Unfortunately, her luck hasn't played out for her. She's hard up for dates with men, and has built up so many walls that she finds most people of the opposite species unbearable and not worth her time.

In the beginning of the movie, you watch Nora navigate her way through a few short-lived and tough relationships. We've all been through them. The awkward relationships that always end in some kind of loneliness. And there she's left. Essentially, practically giving up. But fate has bigger plans for her, and she doesn't know it.

She's invited to a coworkers party where she meets a handsome, overly confident Frenchman named Julien. Julien is persistent to say the least. Typical of a lot of actual European men, who contrary to American men tend to have a very forward approach to getting women. Nora is taken aback, but eventually- begins to let her guard down. Not everything goes as it should though- and as with any romance movie, things must temporarily fall apart.

This movie follows a lot of the stereotypes of it's genre. It has a few romantic clichs, but at the same time veers into a unique direction. Nora is not your typical damsel in distress awaiting an knight in shining armor. She's well off financially, successfully, and socially. But she also faces many underlying issues that we find skewed across the storyline- including severe anxiety and many fears of misfortune. Julien is NOT your typical knight in shining armor. He's calm, patient, quiet, and yet exudes confidence. The two are a match made in heaven. But, as other reviewers have mentioned, Nora needs to learn to love herself- before Julien can truly fall in love with her.

The movie ends on a good note- a different note than most romance movies. I was actually a little disappointed at the ending. It was fulfilling, but didn't quite give off the 'fireworks' that other romance movies get off. I liked this in a lot of ways, but at the same time, I'm so used to clich romance ending that I was a bit surprised by the way this one concluded.

The acting and fun banter was a joy to watch. The film work was simple, the scenery was realistic, everything fell into place for the perfect chick-flick ""watch with your girlfriends"" movie. I loved it, and I've already watched it three times. Getting ready to sit down and watch it yet again now!",1407110400,,2773,4.651020408163265

It is so real and relatable.  I was so invested in the characters that it was disappointing that it had to end.  There is so much left to explore!  The modern American woman finds a modern French man so refreshing compared to her American dating experience.  He is much more fulfilling to be with because he is straight forward, passionate, and accepting, almost to the point that she wonders if she is special to him.  We still don't really know the answer to that!  I think the sequel could show us that he still has plenty to teach Nora, that she is special and a match to him, something he knew instinctively.  Maybe we can learn he is a little broken in some way too and Nora fulfills that part of him.

I also like the message that not all European men are pigs.  Julian seems like he might even be ready to settle down and focus all of his energy and passion on Nora. The ending is a brilliant scene, it appears so simple, but because we have seen Nora's journey we realize what a comfort and life changing moment it is for her.

Posey is absolutely flawless as Norah, you can feel her pain through her sad eyes. Norah develops unexpected feelings for a Frenchman but he is only in town for a few days. The new couple have white hot chemistry and a unique connection. He convinces Norah to go back to Paris with him but she turns him down because she is a ""coward"" - her words, not mine.

2799775,3,B000OU082G,"In ""Broken English"" a New York hotel concierge Nora Wilder (perfectly cast Parker Posey) meets her perfect man in the winsome Parisian Julien (Melvil Poupaud) visiting the city. However, bring insecure (partly because of her recent date with a self-obsessed actor Nick Gable played by Justin Theroux), she cannot say ""Yes"" when she knows she should.

""Broken English is written and directed by Zoe R. Cassavetes, daughter of late John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands (who briefly appears as Nora's mother). Anyone who knows the style of John Cassavetes as director (responsible for ""Shadows,"" ""Faces"" and other great films) will not be surprised that his daughter employed a low-key approach to her filmmaking. Events are depicted in a much more subdued way than most Hollywood romantic comedies and its subtlety is one of the merits of the film.

Unfortunately, the materials themselves covered here are not particularly new. What is more disappointing is the characters and dialogues. Despite the excellent acting from Melvil Poupaud, the French traveler Julien is almost formulaic, too good a person to be true and so are Nora's mother and best friend Audrey (Drea de Matteo, who turns in a fine performance). Their characters are rather one-note, do not engage our interest or attention.

The greatest part of the film is, of course, Parker Posey. You will be watching her brilliant acting as Nora, but to me it seems as if Parker Posey has taken over the role and banished Nora out of it. Sometimes a talented actor gives his or her character a life that a by-the-numbers script fails to give, and I think this is what is happening here.",1231977600,,1639,4.974452554744525

What seems like fate is often just pattern, and we see how we can either cause the past to repeat, partly by our own expectations and reactions that call forth the same results, or how we can allow the unexpected to come out of us and invite new experiences into our lives.

I've read all the other Amazon comments, and I'm sad that so many missed the point. Often compared to Sofia Coppola's debut film, ""Lost in Translation"", which made light of the human condition, ""Broken English"" is more about the true life kinds of things that are funny or sad, depending on how we deal with them. I was never bored. Ms. Posey commanded attention at all times, and I was eager to find out the situation in which she would next find herself. Excellent performances from Justin Theroux, Drea di Matteo and Ms. Cassavetes own mom, the great Gena Rowlands, flow naturally; Melvil Poupaud, as Julien, the French connection, was quite sweet and fine. He is indeed a beautiful man, looking better as the film goes on, and as Nora gets to know him better. I can relate very much to Nora's character, especially when she goes to a party she doesn't want to be at, and then meets the right person. Ms. Cassavetes, in a DVD extra, refers to this as a comedy. It's much more. I don't want to blab away the plot, as others did, but this is definitely worth seeing. Parker Posey's diversity was so well explored in the mock-umentary films of Christopher Guest. She is an Indie darling, and for good reason. Ms. Cassavetes, too, has proven herself, and I'm waiting for her next endeavor.",1206144000,7,1402,4.634538152610442

2799782,4,B000OU082G,"Don't approach ""Broken English"" expecting ""Green Card"" or ""Sleepless in Seattle.""  This is a more experimental approach to the genre - less a traditional romantic comedy and more of a dark character study with a few moments of comedic relief.  Romance is merely the device used to illustrate one woman's descent into desperation.

Nora Wilder, an upper middle class woman in her 30's, has everything going for her.  She is a Sarah Lawrence graduate with a decent job, a Manhattan apartment, good friends and nearby family.  However, she is no longer in the first flush of youth.  One day she realizes that she has spent six years in the job that was supposed to be temporary until she found her career in the arts.  Furthermore, all of her friends are married, but she can't find love in the land of plenty.  She realizes that she had some nice boyfriends when she was in college, but now that she is ready to settle down she can't find a decent guy.  She meets a variety of men; some of them are ready to settle down - but with other women, not with Nora.  Nora, in her desperation to connect with a man, is ready to sleep with any guy who compliments her.  In fact, she can't believe a man is interested in her unless they have slept together - an attitude that makes her vulnerable to hurt from men who are completely unavailable.

After yet another bad experience, Nora forces herself to attend a party given by one of her co-workers.  As she is ready to exit the party she is introduced to Julien, a Frenchman nearing the end of his stay in the city.  Nora is at the end of her rope with men.  She's not interested in connecting with Julien on any level, but he is persistent.  Every time Nora is ready to say good night or goody bye to Julien, he comes up with a new place for them to go, something new to see or do.  By the time Nora and Julien share a first kiss, they have gotten to know and like each other a little.  But after a few days together, Julien has to go home to France.  His departure leaves a larger hole in her life than Nora would have imagined.  Eventually she overcomes her initial resistance and travels to France, hoping to reconnect with him.  In Paris, Nora discovers that she has lost the paper with Julien's phone number; the friend who introduced them is out of town not answering his messages; and Julien has the most common surname in France.

Once Nora accepts that she won't find Julien, she decides to make the most of her time in Paris.  She shops.  She visits museums and galleries.  As an ""exotic foreigner"" herself, she is able to have the kind of encounters with people in Paris that she is incapable of finding in her hometown.  She engages in lively debates and soul searching introspective discussions with strangers.  She learns something about herself in the process, and she learns to value herself.  By the time she's ready to leave Paris, she's on her way to becoming a confident new woman ready to take on new challenges and, just maybe, find the love that has eluded her.

Parker Posey's brilliant performance prevents this depressed and desperate woman from becoming an uninteresting cliche.  Her darker feelings seem genuine, yet always underlined by a kind of surprised disbelief that her life could have become this messy.

Melvil Poupaud is charming as the visiting Frenchman.  At first sight he is easily dismissed by both Nora and the audience but,  as she (and we) get to know him better, Julien becomes fascinating and irresistible.

The DVD special features are disappointing.  There is no director's commentary, which would have been interesting in a film like this.  It would have been even more interesting because this is Zoe Cassavetes directorial debut.  The features include a piece from HDNet with separate interviews of Cassavetes (interesting) and Gena Rowlands (rambling).  A ""making of"" feature appears to have been taped with a small hand held camera; the video is shaky and the sound is indistinct - it adds nothing to the package.  There are a few mildly interesting deleted scenes.

Though the conclusion leaves many questions...it's an achingly good romantic dramedy",1199059200,3,529,5.309523809523809

Zoe Cassavetes` ""Broken English"" is a comedy/drama about an attractive young woman who, through her neuroticism and emotional insecurities, keeps sabotaging her own happiness.  Even though she works as a manager and troubleshooter at a trendy Manhattan hotel, Nora Wilder doesn't lead what one would call a particularly fulfilling life.  Unable to make a lasting connection with any of the men she meets, Nora (Parker Posey) finds herself drifting from one meaningless encounter to another, a situation that only exacerbates her already deep-rooted fears and vulnerabilities.

In its structure, ""Broken English"" has a freeform looseness that keeps it from feeling over-plotted and contrived.  And while there are times when the movie seems to be serving up pretty much the same scene over and over again, Posey's winsomeness and charm make us care about the character.  In fact, without her, the movie would be considerably less compelling than it is.  She manages to make a likable figure out of a character who might otherwise be seen as excessively whiny and self-pitying.  And even though the mood of the film is generally light and playfully ironic, there is some genuine pain in the story as well, as Nora struggles with the very real issues of loneliness, panic attacks and depression.

The actress receives impressive support from Drea de Matteo (""The Sopranos""), Peter Bogdanovich, Gena Rowlands, Justin Theroux and Melvil Poupaud, but the movie is Posey`s all the way.",1197158400,,1486,5.236286919831223
2799785,3,B000OU082G,"Women nowadays don't feel the need to connect with men on a marital plain. And that is pretty much how Nora Wilder (Parker Posey,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fay-Grim/dp/B000NY0YKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fay Grim</a>) feels her life turning out.

Bad date after bad date, Nora leaps headlong upon every man she meets or is set up with (including one horrible blind date arranged by her mother, played by the estimable Gena Rowlands).

From meeting movie stars to momma's boys, Nora is sure that she'll spend the rest of her life withering away, loveless and alone. Even her job at an upscale hotel seems headed toward nowheresville. But then she happens upon Julien (Melvil Poupaud), a visiting Frenchman with no reservations about relationships. Their dating rapidly escalates but each holds back their love for fear of losing themselves to the opposite sex.

Funny moments occur as Julien's poor English enunciation turns mundane subjects into firecracker discussions. Nora's stress of dating someone she might actually grow to care about leads her to alcohol and her medicine cabinet, needing something to salve her anxiety about how much she's beginning to care for Julien.

When Julien finally tells Nora that he has to go back to Paris, it is a hammer's blow to Nora's life. Julien begs her to come with him, but Nora has friends, family, and a job to worry about. So Julien leaves and gives her his phone number ""just in case...""

""Just in case"" happens, as Nora flies with a friend to Paris and quickly learns that she's lost Julien's phone number. Unable to locate him (""His name is like John Smith in America""), she decides to simply enjoy herself while on vacation and scurries about Paris. But when it comes time to leave, she can't. She realizes that she's been staying in Paris only to see Julien again. She remains for a while longer but finally, regretfully, decides to return to the U.S. On her trip to the Paris airport, however, she discovers she's riding the train with Julien, and the two reconnect via happenstance and serendipity.

Although smaltzy and awkward in many places, BROKEN ENGLISH has that quirky feel to it that makes many of its failings watchable. Parker Posey gives a powerful emotional performance as a woman in conflict with the times and her need to connect with someone meaningful. French actor Melvil Poupaud is handsome, a bit gruff, and just as strange as Parker Posey's character, which makes them play off each other exceptionally well.

The pacing of the film is exceptionally slow, however, especially the first five minutes in which all we do is watch Parker Posey put on make-up and look in the mirror five-hundred times; something you should be prepared for. The pacing does pick up in places, but it can get tiresome watching the mundane for just as many minutes later on.",1194480000,4,2876,5.0548523206751055

Poor, poor Nora has a string of loser and dysfunctional relationships.  I can't really imagine why .... Go figure!!  She meets a charming French dude who has to return to Paris.  So she later follows him there but has nothing but a phone number written on a slip of paper, which she loses.  En route back to the Paris Airport she - miraculously - runs into her old flame on the subway.  Imagine that!!

2799787,3,B000OU082G,"Writer/director Zoe Cassavettes' ""Broken English"" is an engaging yet understated slice of life that zipped in and out of arthouse theaters in early summer. Its message (""you must love yourself before love finds you"") is not only the least virginal territory a screenwriter could dare to tread, it is the essence of gooey, sentimental sap. What really makes it worthwhile is its gorgeous shots of Paris and its star Parker Posey, who is as radiant as her acting ability is boundless. Just when you think you've seen all she can do, she proves you wrong and comes off effortless all the while.

Posey is Nora Wilder, a wine-guzzling train ready to jump the track. Sure, she may not have a man, but everything else seems in order - a steady job, a spiffy Manhattan apartment, healthy relationships with her friends and family. At her core, however, resides a deep-seated insecurity that in her mid-30s is coming to a head.

""What is wrong with me?,"" she asks herself. ""Why can't I meet someone nice?""

She then concludes she must be the problem: ""I think I must be doing something horribly wrong.""

Her mother Vivien, played by acting legend Gena Rowlands, tries to help but only makes her feel more self-conscious. ""The good ones get snapped up so quickly at your age,"" she says in a half-hearted effort to console her daughter.

Nora gets set up on dates that, despite herself, she agrees to go on. Whether she is the reason behind her lack of success is not as important as her lack of self-assuredness. When at last she finds something worth holding onto in a young Frenchman named Julien, played by Melvil Poupad, she finds herself at an unexpected crossroads, flakey as ever in the face of making tough decisions.

She soon heads off to Paris with her friend Audrey, played to perfection by Drea de Matteo, in tow. Is Julien her only objective, however, or is there more to her journey than even Nora may know herself?

Cassavettes' script at once appears to be a litmus test for romance in a modern, fast-paced world, and it is, but it still requires that the viewer suspend disbelief at several junctures in the plot. This chips away at the film's merit slightly, but it does not invalidate it. The acting is sufficient at worst and stellar at best across the board, and Nora's personal predicaments will be instantly relatable to anyone at all who is introverted, shy or just plain challenged when it comes to relationships.

Like her brother Nick did when he directed the megahit 2004 adaptation of ""The Notebook"" by romance author Nicholas Sparks, Cassavettes casts her mother (Rowlands) in a small role. Unlike him, however, she does not maximize the emotional schmaltz to the level the script allows for. ""Broken English"" is by no means a happily-ever-after story of ""Cinderella"" proportions, and if it were it would insult the intellectual capabilities of its viewers.

With a search for love as its driving force and a complex female protagonist, ""Broken English"" may seem to smatter of cookie cutter Lifetime fare. What makes the difference is that despite its faults the plot boasts a good head on its shoulders that not only portrays both sexes fairly and honestly but boasts one of our generation's most underappreciated film actresses doing what she does best from the first frame to the last. For that, it is a worthy 93 minutes.",1190851200,19,3347,4.786828422876949

I had to look up  her version of the song again after the film and listen to it. Also found a good U-Tube interview about her struggles growing up in the '60s and her love involvement with Mick Jagger and her heroine addition and recovery.
I appreciated this film. I was not a great film but alas an interesting one. Women do get so programed to look outside themselves for love whereas we need to look inward first and love ourselves before we attract a loving partner. This is the message of the film. Well done Parker Posey for playing the lead character so completely anxiety disorder and all and for your exploration of self love and attraction!

It was a drama and actually more of an introspection type of movie than a romance, as the romance was secondary to her increased self-awareness.  Most importantly, this movie was not a comedy in any way shape or form.  It was not meant to be, and it should not have been billed as one.  So the plot had its merits, and the acting was great all around, just don't expect more than a drama with some mild romance from this film.",1512259200,,545,4.152380952380953
