5188623,3,B008XAT0VY,"I always wanted to see ""One Good Cop"" just because i am big Michael Keaton fan. This was the only way I had ever been able to finally see this movie. It was okay, but I have no desire to watch it again for a long time. Michael Keaton has been in much better movies. I never bothered to watch ""A Stranger Among Us"", so I cant comment if that is any good or not.",1376179200,,360,3.8133333333333335

5188625,4,B008XAT0VY,"It doesn't just entertain, but it also shows you how things have changed since the movies were made. Not just in reality, but also in movie making. Love them both, especially ""A Stranger Among Us.""",1370822400,,197,4.6571428571428575

5188627,5,B008XAT0VY,"Mill Creek does it again, this time with two Police/Detective themed films, BOTH of these are rated R.
Both are in thier original widescreen ratios, and have optional english captions.

The PQ and AQ are great with this release.

One Good Cop stars the great Michael Keaton

A Stranger Among Us stars Melanie Griffith.

Mill Creek is really releasing some stellar products lately!

5188628,5,B008XAT0VY,"I would encourage anyone to upgrade their older VHS or DVD movies to at least Bluray 2D quality (3D for those who have 3D grade TVs) as the quality of the picture is 100% better then VHS tapes and nearly 50% better then DVD's. The sound quality has been improved and upgraded as well. Most Blu-rays have many more features that can be viewed as well which make for a much fuller movie experience too! Oh and just so you know, even if you don't own a Bluray movie you should go buy an on sale Bluray player. Why? Because a Bluray player scans the disk many more times than just a standard DVD player, that it will even make your older DVD movies look much better. That is, as long as you have a flat screen type of TV that was purchased in the last five years. Good luck and go get some!",1354752000,2,786,4.1103896103896105

8531796,5,B008XAT0VY,"I, ab-so-lute-ly, LOVE a-l-l of the ""Millcreek 2-fer"" Blu-ray Collections.
I have several of them, and have paid as little as $3 for them, but NEVER more
than $9.
These DOUBLE FEATURE Blu-rays, often---but not always---have some theme or
movie star to tie them together.
The video-transfers are second-to-none, with exceptionally crisp audio as well.
I do not know WHY these ""2 Movie"" collections are so inexpensive, but I can
highly recommend them all.
Here is a list of favorites in MY collection:
