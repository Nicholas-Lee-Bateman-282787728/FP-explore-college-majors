8332583,3,B001P95FUK,"This compilation is ok but it misses some key moments such as:
1) The winning speech in South Carolina (SC) primary race, after the fight against Hilary Clinton and racial charges were thrown by both sides.  That was an important moment because HRC had just won New Hampshire and Nevada.  Had she won SC the race would have been over.
2) The race speech - this was a very important turning point in the primary race. This is also very important for America, a country with a history of slavery
3) There was no mention of Barack Obama winning 11 primaries in a row, these has never been done in a contested race.
4) There was no mentioned of Super Tuesday and how that produced a stale mate
5) There was no mention of the losses in Texas and Ohio - which threatened his push for the nomination.

All in all, this is a good compilation for historical records but somewhat incomplete.",1253059200,10,881,4.425925925925926
