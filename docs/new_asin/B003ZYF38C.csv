8411298,1,B003ZYF38C,It was not worth it and I wish I didn't buy it. This was short and didn't make no damn sense. I could have ordered something better. Next time I will really read reviews.,1370304000,,170,4.029411764705882
8411299,2,B003ZYF38C,"The Post woman is a pretty rudimentary short film, which unfolds like a student or experimental flick. I was disappointed in the quality of this movie. The story wasn't really developed and the actors were just OK. I suppose it was a decent effort from beginner filmmakers, but if you are looking for a well developed more professional looking movie forget this one.",1352160000,,366,4.825396825396825
8411300,2,B003ZYF38C,"The movie was more of a trailer or introduction to a bigger movie. I was very dissapointed with it and there was lots of unneccessary hype on it. I believe the acting could have been much better. The women coming up the stairs was the best actress, and she only had a 5 second clipping. What I do appreciate is the fact that there is a director who is brave, concious, and powerful enough to make a movie on lesbians of color. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it, but would recommend donating to the director in any way you can. If a entire movie came out, I guess would buy it.",1325808000,2,575,4.236363636363636
8411301,5,B003ZYF38C,"Director JD Walker does an amazing job capturing the complex challenges of relationships while dispelling some of the myths surrounding lesbianism. The cast does a great job of executing the director's vision for this film. As a result, The Postwoman is insightful and it successfully manages to address the serious issues of infidelity and longing for unconditional love in a humorous way.  I certainly recommend this film to anyone, regardless of sexual preference as there is a lesson within to be learned by all.",1282953600,,516,5.142857142857143
8411302,5,B003ZYF38C,"I really enjoyed ""The Postwoman"" when I saw it a film festival in Los Angeles. It was hilarious and it really challenged existing stereotypes in the main stream media without being preachy. The lines of relationships are fragile no matter who you are involved with and women struggle with commitment issues just as much as men do.",1282608000,,330,4.807017543859649
