This 2 disc set (which is region free and will play on your player) is fantastic. What we have here is two discs that serve as a history of rock n roll and country rock from a British perspective.
Some of the performers are well advanced in years, but none fail to put across the tunes they perform. Some performances, to me at least, were quite amazing (Gary Brooker doing whiter shade of pale as one example)
If you like old rock and roll or 70's style country, this show will not disappoint. If you're an Albert Lee fan you should get it anyway.",1492905600,,624,4.208333333333333
