8442034,4,B004UR1RA6,"So, I watched this in stereo, not sure if it would have been better in surround sound, but the audio was really weird. At times the background music is way too loud and you can't hear the interviews, at other times the overdubbed narration is muddled by jon's singing. Strange, but if you have the patience to watch it, it's great. I love yes, loved seeing them play, loved hearing them talk about their history. Good stuff.",1394928000,2,424,4.51948051948052
8442035,3,B004UR1RA6,"I'm really just validating what others have said. The audio mix is terrible. Many of the candid moments sound like they were captured with the camera's built-in mic, which makes the too-loud music even more destructive of the dialogue.

On top of that, there are some really cheesy video effects. I have no idea why you'd want to use a pseudo black-and-white and low-frame-rate technique. This effect is even more out-of-place when they cut between that effect and normal footage of the same material. And when they do low-frame-rate effects during concert footage it's aggravating. I want to SEE these amazing musicians in action!

And then there are the odd edits. It was most noticeable during the individual segments, and -- for instance -- during the Rick Wakeman segment they cut to some candid footage featuring Alan White. Other than the fact that Alan is talking to Rick at the start of the clip, there's no connection.

It's like they got someone's nephew who knew how to work Windows Video Maker to edit it.
There are other ametuer hour moments, like Alan's interviews on his boat, where activity in the background is more attention grabbing than Alan, or times when the documentary crew becomes the focus, which feels more like a cutesy inside joke for the filmmakers than anything worthwhile for the Yes fan.

Having said all that, the content is on the whole very good. As a Yes fan (not lifetime or hardcore, like other reviewers), or even just a fan of music and pop culture, it was fascinating. I could go on about why, but that won't really change whether ou want to see this or not.
If you're a completist, you may as well buy it. But if you're just interested in absorbing the information once, rent it or find it at your library. I'm glad I saw it, but also that I didn't have to pay for it. Support your local library, folks!

In summary: 4.5 stars for content, 1 star for production value.",1366675200,2,1912,4.644970414201183
8442036,2,B004UR1RA6,"Old guys droning on about this and that doesn't fascinate, no matter who they may be. I suspect Anderson found some YES worshipers who would do a film on the cheap and duly glorify the band. If you are an old fan then you should be embarrassed for them.

If you are new to the group, this movie may squelch your interest. Daltry tries to sell you on how great they are/were, but if you already know that, then his side show enthusiasm is simply tedious. There is no depth to the interviews and little of interest to most people.

I would like to know details of their past glory as well as info on how the music was made and recorded. Long ago it seems Yes ceased to press for excellence in all they do. Bruford saw it coming back in '72 when he decided to leave on the Close to the Edge high note. He later revealed that CTTE could never be surpassed given the existent personnel. There is no doubt that Bruford was a key creative element to the band. I digress.

I will always lament the apparent slide into apathy. They lost the spark and don't seem to realize it. They started slipping and never recovered....maybe it was the booze, maybe the cocaine, maybe the big Egos...who knows. None the less, Close to the Edge stands as one of the great pieces of music ever recorded, regardless of genre. For 35 years I've awaited a match for that achievement.

I'm waiting still.",1336003200,,1375,4.359375
