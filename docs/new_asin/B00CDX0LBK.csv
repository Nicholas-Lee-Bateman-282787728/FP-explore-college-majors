8580674,3,B00CDX0LBK,"This is a bit boring, but it is completely done by a women who over came her mental illness and went on to get degrees, write, act and become an advocate for mentally ill.",1466294400,,171,4.0588235294117645
8580675,3,B00CDX0LBK,"This is an accurate portrayal of one woman's loss of her thread with reality.  However, it is a one-shot monologue without scope or texture.",1385942400,,140,4.833333333333333
8580676,5,B00CDX0LBK,"Corday's presentation is highly unique.  She comes from her heart with a sharing of her own highly personal experience with psychosis with an obvious deep desire to help others understand what is it like to ""lose the thread.""  Surely, it offers both comfort and insight to anyone who deals with psychosis or is close to someone who does - as well as for general public education.  As she calmly searches for the best words to relay exactly what she wants to say, her sense of humor comes through to shed light on a very serious subject.",1370390400,,536,4.5625
8580677,2,B00CDX0LBK,"Not at all what I was expecting, based upon the Amazon product description.

This is not enlightened biography as found in ""A Beautiful Mind,"" ""Girl Interrupted,"" or Clifford Beers classic ""A Mind that Found Itself.""  Dr. Corday appears to be ""spell bound"" by her medications and makes some remarkable claims about their efficacy.

Dr. Corday is not a psychiatrist, psychologist, or any kind of medical professional, not that those credentials are important to share her first-hand experience with psychosis. However, she peppers her narrative with phrases like ""chemical imbalance"" and makes several vague references to diseased or different brain anatomy, none of which have been shown to exist in the living (or dead) brain of any person with serious mental illness, to ""explain"" her personal psychotic experiences.  While her personal narrative, body language and interpretations of self and experiences through her separate reality may have some value for students of behavior and medicine, this DVD does nothing to illuminate ""the nature of psychosis.""",1367193600,,1058,5.47239263803681
