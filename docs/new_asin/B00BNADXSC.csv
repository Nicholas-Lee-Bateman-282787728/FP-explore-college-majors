5657846,4,B00BNADXSC,"Not sure if I want to review the product or the transaction, so I will do both.  Season 8 is Wagon Train on a budget.  Remember the extras who walked around as the main cast had camp scenes in earlier seasons?  The only extras we see in season 8 are extra Wagons.  Another key fact in season 8, the show is back to being filmed in black and white.  If you are new to Wagon Train DO NOT start with season 8.  Enjoy it for what it is, the final season of a television classic.  Now as to the shipping, well packaged and prompt shipping.",1471219200,5,534,4.0285714285714285

5657860,2,B00BNADXSC,"It surprises me that some of these old westerns were preserved so much better than others. Gunsmoke, Rawhide and Have Gun Will Travel all look so much better than this series. Openings look washed out and there was zero attempt at restoration. Don't get me wrong. I'm glad that
Shout is trying to bring these old and some not so old classics to DVD but I would prefer they make some effort to clean them up. Especially when they charge close to $45 for a single season.

But the fact that the series went back to black and white from season 7's color episodes and that the last 2 episodes didn't fit the series nor wrap it up, disappointed.

5657868,4,B00BNADXSC,"In 1965, Wagon Train and The Joey Bishop Show were canceled. Both series had been in color in previous seasons, but were in the unusual circumstance of being in black and white up against very strong Sunday evening color competitors. Wagon Train was knocked off by Walt Disney's Wonderful World Of Color, and Joey Bishop, by the in living color giant, Bonanza. In the episode, Joey Goes To CBS, the cast looks at the camera and cries when told they are competing against Bonanza. Funny stuff, but devastating. Joey Bishop's sitcom changing networks, going from color to black and white makes some sense, as NBC had been color casting, and CBS, at the time, was not (though if show owner Danny Thomas had continued picking up the tab for color filming, The Joey Bishop Show would likely have been seen much more in syndicated reruns, than it has been through the years). Wagon Train reverting from color to black and white makes no sense. The sets at Universal had already been painted and lighted for color filming during season 7. The budget had already been cut by decreasing the time from 90 to 60 minutes and letting Denny Miller (Duke Shannon) go. At the time, many viewers watching Wagon Train on color televisions, initially thought there was something wrong with their sets, when the color opening from season 7 wasn't in color on season 8. Season 8 in color would also have made the hour McIntire episodes from seasons 4,5,6,and 8 more attractive in reruns through the decades (at least as popular as season 7 in color, which turned up locally and later on cable, frequently).

As it is, season 8 is filled with great stories, solid performances by guest stars, and a first rate turn by the crew. Picture quality appears from worn 16mm prints, which look okay on an older portable CRT but lousy on a digital flatscreen. Sound quality is great. I miss Duke, who played very well off Cooper Smith as buddies closer in age to eachother, than the others; Coop seems much more of a loner without him, in season 8. Universal has remastered many of their old shows: The Rockford Files, Emergency, Columbo, and Laramie. Lets hope all of Wagon Train gets remastered. And please issue all 252 hour episodes together (not just the earlier ones with Ward Bond) in one package for TV reruns (this would include 5 color episodes from the Robert Horton era in season 5) so that they are seen as often in reruns as the 32 color 90 minute season 7 shows.",1435536000,3,2446,4.648960739030023

5657883,4,B00BNADXSC,"Bought this one mostly for Robert Fuller and he did not disappoint. I enjoyed all the other casts members who have made the series such a joy to watch.  It has some very excellent stories with wonderful guest stars. I do think on the last season they tended to concentrate a bit too much on Michael Burns character Barny and to me the last 2 episodes are a total waste of time. I think they knew the show was ending and just threw these together, you just see one or two of the regular cast member as they start to tell a story and it goes on from there with the characters in the story. On that level a very disappointing way to end their final season.",1413331200,4,653,4.141732283464567

5657900,5,B00BNADXSC,"Wagon Train was one of the finest western series to be shown during the 1950's and 1960's...it lasted for 8 seasons.  It had great stars, guests, writers, and directors.  It was terrific to watch. Once in a while, the story was silly and implausible, but for the most part, it was very well-done.  John McIntire was one of the best character actors around and he held all the different elements together.
McIntire also appeared several times on Laramie....and every role was different.  Robert Fuller joined Wagon Train in the 7th season after Laramie ended.  His character of Cooper Smith was very much like the Jess Harper character of Laramie.  But Fuller is a good actor and carried weight on the show.  Scott Miller and the supporting cast of characters added humor, drama, and conflict.  Shows like Wagon Train are not around any more....westerns fell out of favor.  Today we are inundated with tasteless reality shows about tasteless celebrities.  The quality shows are on cable stations and are not always available to the average viewer except if one is willing to pay to see them.  The DVD's make it possible to see one of the best shows of a bygone era.  For that reason alone, one should watch and judge for themselves.",1380326400,2,1231,4.781990521327014

5657906,4,B00BNADXSC,"I now have many DVDs of old TV shows from the 1950s and 60s that have been remastered and I must say that in this case the remastering varies from average to good (in my opinion) but this is still desirable compared to had they not been remastered - however, I have noticed that the picture quality seems to be a bit too white (they are in black and white of course) - I am certainly no expert on these matters and can only give my opinion but I am nevertheless still glad to own this set because Wagon Train was a fave show of mine when I was a youngster growing up in the late 1950s and 60s.

I love the colourful, embossed metal tin that the DVDs come in - however, I am not so keen on the way the 8 discs are presented inside a thick cardboard tombstone shaped case with each disc squeezed into a narrow cut out slot one each per page so to speak - this gives the potential for scratches and fingerprints when removing and replacing discs in/from their slots due to the tight fit - surely a better way would have been to have each disc on a plastic spindle within a hard plastic case!",1375488000,7,1088,4.107981220657277

Robert Fuller is my favorite and he has some really great story lines.  They have great guest stars.
