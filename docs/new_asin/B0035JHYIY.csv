4070351,5,B0035JHYIY,I love this series. It didn't end right to me. Needed more seasons. I have watched the whole thing 3 times.,1275350400,,107,4.142857142857143
4070352,5,B0035JHYIY,"Every since I first saw the first episode on PBS back in the 90's, I was hooked! I have the complete series and have watched it over and over for some years now!  The dry humor and wit can not be surpassed!",1271462400,5,206,3.9047619047619047
4070353,5,B0035JHYIY,"The WHOLE THING in ONE SET!!!  About time, too!

""Waiting for God"" became a favourite from the moment I first saw an episode.  (It was ""The Spiritualist"" from Season Four.)  A friend sat me down and told me, ""You WILL watch this.""  I met Tom, Diana, Harvey, Jane, Geoffrey, and Marian.

Don't let the title put you off, it has nothing to do with religion or dying and everything to do with life and living.  The series is set in the Bayview Retirement Community in Bournemouth, England.  The place is run by Harvey ""The Idiot"" Baines, with the help of his side-kick Jane Edwards.  When a new inmate - er, resident - Tom Ballard checks in, he moves in next to Diana Trent.  Tom is a widower with one son (according to Diana, he's thick as a plank) and a daughter-in-law (""and she's something out of the Twilight Zone,"" also according to Diana).  Tom was an accountant for 40 years, and when he becomes bored he tends to let his mind wander into his own imaginary world, populated by B-Movies and their plots.  Diana, on the other hand, is a spinster - proud of it - who was a prize-winning wartime photojournalist.  Together, Tom & Diana keep things at Bayview stirred up, so much so that Harvey spends the entire five year run of the show trying to chuck them both out.  (The show never made it to the US, but if it had my idea of ""Dream Casting"" would have been Harvey Korman & Bea Arthur.  Acid wit meets silliness.)

Graham Crowden and Stephanie Cole are superb as the troublesome twosome. (Ironically, Ms. Cole had to be aged for the part, which she took on when she was about 50 years old.)  Daniel Hill plays Baines, and Janine Duvitski plays Jane. Jane is smitten with Harvey, and Harvey thinks his ideal woman sits on tractors in bikinis.  Once in a while Jane decides it's hopeless and tries to become a nun.  Harvey, who is totally inept, can't run the place without her.  Geoffrey

The writing is sharp and well-paced.  The show tackles many problems of aging (prostate problems, adult-onset diabetes, loneliness, the scams perpetrated on aging, and others) with taste and laughs.  THE SERIES IS A WHOLE STORY WITH A BEGINNING, A MIDDLE, AND AN END.  Start at the beginning and keep going until the end.  Prepare for laughing out loud.  Several episodes may cause soreness to ribs from doing so:  the trip to Brighton in season one, the scandal in season three, and the last four episodes of season five.  The set includes the two Christmas specials, and hopefully some extra features.

It took YEARS for this wonderful series to appear on DVD.  Fans eagerly bought up each season, fearing it would be the last released.  NOW comes the full series all in one go!  If you count the number of discs in the individual seasons, you come up with SEVEN.  The count on this set says EIGHT, and the cover artwork actually says NINE.  So, we may be faced with a dilemma: keep buying the individual seasons or go for it and get the whole set.  Your choice.  If you haven't gotten the seasons as they were released, go for this set.

The point is, everyone should visit Bayview.  Once won't be enough!",1269734400,89,3101,4.510791366906475
4070354,5,B0035JHYIY,"The above ad lib found only on the American copies of this BBC 5 Season BBC romp of the 90s (the cover art on the British copies are the same though) sums it all up.  Tom Ballard (Graham Crowden) is a happy go lucky guy who is being sent to a retirement community by his son Geoffrey and constantly drunk or worse daughter in law Marion because they can't deal with him any more (always in a fantasy world, and ""other problems"" that come with age). At Bayview, he is neighbored by Diana Trent (Stephanie Cole) who as Tom would say later ""puts the tank in cantankerous"".  An old spinster who is tired of living the life of being unliked, etc. and now wants to live her declining days in peace.  In spite of their differences, this ""oddball couple"", find common ground, a disgust for the way their ""home"" is being run by royal pain in the......(you fill in the blank with the word of your choice) Harvey Baines (Daniel Hill) and his equally ditzy assistant Jane Edwards (Janine Duvitsky) who (God only knows why) is smitten with the blithering idiot.  Eventually, they get others in their community (including oversexed maniac Basil) on their side to do what they can to oust ""the idiot Baines"", and develop a friendship and even love for each other by series end.  This gem was released on DVD in England between 2006 and 2007, but Warner in their deal with BBC Video, has been releasing them here one at a time for the last 4 years, the 5th set being released the same day as this complete set (ironically the other 4 were all released at the same time each year since 2006).  As I see it, nothing extra will be in the complete collection, that is not in the separate releases. The 3rd and 4th sets include Christmas Specials made during those seasons. If you waited for all 5 sets to be out to buy, then get this set as (like other BBC Video releases here) it will be a better deal, than the 5 individuals.  If you have a multi region player, you can get currently get the British copies individually (but unfortunately not in a complete mega set) for a few bucks more or less now.  But do what is easier for you.  Just buy it, and get ready to laugh your tush off.",1264291200,35,2166,4.354838709677419

4070439,5,B0035JHYIY,"Bayview Retirement Home is a lovely place to visit but I wouldnt want to live there!  The inmates are the elderly, warehoused on the cheap.  The place is run with some efficiency thanks to a sad secretary, Jane Edwards (Janine Duvitski), with unrealistic hope of a romance with the manager (Daniel Hill as The Idiot Bains).  The main characters are the fabulous curmudgeon, Diana Trent (the incomparable Stephanie Cole) and the often daft optimist Tom Ballard (Graham Crowden).  Every episode features their attempts to annoy The Idiot Bains and insult poor Jane to tears.  They love to right wrongs and cause trouble whenever they can.  Its quite fun.

4070537,5,B0035JHYIY,"A retirement home is the last place you'd expect to find laughs... but let's not forget this is a British sitcom and laughs are usually found in situations that would be considered variously bleak, sad, or nasty.  ""Waiting for God"" is an unusually clever, sharp sitcom with more than a few axes to grind about the treatment of the elderly in our supposedly compassionate Western society/culture.  We follow two residents of the Bayview Retirement Home (really an assisted living community) Tom Ballard (Grahm Crowden) and Diana Trent (Stephanie Cole) as they cope and battle with the indignities of old age, from the stigma that they are good for nothing in the eyes of the people they encounter, to the treatment at the hands of the staff of the home (sleazy, self-centered, wannabe yuppie Harvey Bains and sweet but patronizing Jane) and Tom's own family (his extremely boring son Geoffrey and addiction riddled daughter-in-law Marion).
The greatest irony of the show that it pulls off so masterfully again and again with each situation is that Tom and Diana (especially Diana) often emerge as more sane and competent than the people caring for them.  Tom and Diana are a great mismatched pair: he's a loopy dreamer and conventional conformist who slips into trances with famous people in history or film (possibly a coping mechanism he's worked out to keep going in spite of the indignity of his living situation) and she's a firebrand, nasty, independent thinker who lives to stir up trouble and be unpleasant (and she's proud of the fact!).  If they aren't arguing with each other (which they do a lot) they are fighting for what few rights they have left as old people.  The manager of the home is the most frequent target of their attacks (rightly so because Harvey is a scumbag).  The plots are pretty original and the dialogue is witty, smart, and pretty funny, especially anything that comes out of Diana's mouth!  Frankly, the first series was maybe a little heavy on the melancholy of being in a retirement home, but as the show progressed it got funnier and funnier.
The situations are original, the laughs come easily and remember to always be nice to your elders... you might come across a Diana Trent who will kick you to the curb!",1410998400,3,2247,4.820779220779221
4070538,5,B0035JHYIY,"I love this series, but missed some episodes when it was shown on PBS.  It turns out (now that I have the complete set) that I missed quite a few episodes.  These recordings not only include the complete series, but there are extras such as biographies and interviews with the stars.  The only complaint I have is that every time you turn on your set to watch another episode, you must sit through a few minutes of advertisement before you can select the episode; there's no way to skip those ads.  Season one allowed you to skip the introduction to the episodes; in the later seasons, you have to fast-forward through them.  Also. season one subtitles won't go through an HDMI connector - you must use an old fashion 3-connector cable to get subtitles (the later seasons are HDMI compatible).",1410134400,9,793,4.635714285714286

I believe this series was made in the 50's and to think that it is still about the same, and the main complaint is the food, and management trying to cut costs.

one of the mose enjoyable TV series ever.  ""Keeping Up Appearances"" and this show are just priceless keepers.  Neither of them would have played in the states, altho PBS has run Keeping Up and Have you Been served to the point of being ridiculous.
another series I would highly recomment for the senior set is ""AS TIME GOES BY"" with the absolutely wonderful Judi Dench.

Diana Trench, a 60+ photo journalist during the war(s) filming in Asia, meets a 40 year retired accountant.

She delivers great punch lines with ease and grace, and carries the series with aplomb!!  You won't necessarily recognize her, but she is the same actress who played ""Auntie Joan"" in the early seasons of the hit sit-com titled ""Doc Martin"", but it is she!

Loved this series when it was aired fairly regularly on our local PBS channel, but it is not shown much anymore, so decided to purchase the entire five-season set on Amazon recently when it was on sale for about $44.

Description on the Amazon website, as well as on the box set, says it has subtitles, but when I checked ALL the discs, discovered  subtitles available ONLY on four of the five-season set.  Season One does NOT have subtitles and is recorded with monaural sound.  Seasons Two through Five, however, have clear white subtitles you can choose to have on or off, and the sound is recorded in stereo.  Video quality is poorest in Season One, but it is okay.  The other four seasons have better picture quality, especially if you use an up-scaling blu-ray player.

Since I'm sort of a British sitcom ""junkie,"" I reserve praise for those that really deliver quality laughs, and this one does!",1344902400,5,1287,4.629955947136564

4070704,5,B0035JHYIY,This is seriously one of the funniest TV series i have ever watched. Kept me laughing for a majority of the viewing time. Would recommend to any who need a good laugh. This series will certainly give you that.,1301097600,,209,4.384615384615385
4070705,5,B0035JHYIY,"I do not know who you are, but if you have not seen this series before, please go watch as soon as possibls. This is a superb series with laughter in every episode, a must own if you love British Comedy. Please see immediately. THank you",1299542400,,237,4.173913043478261
4070706,5,B0035JHYIY,"I found this set very funny and entertaining. It's also totally different from any other series I have ever seen. The writing is superb as is the casting and the acting.
Not all British comedy turns me on ( I consider the British version of ""The Office"" as total garbage for instance) but ""Waiting for God"" is Five stars.",1299110400,,321,4.4576271186440675
4070717,5,B0035JHYIY,"Only the British could come up with a wonderful satirical point of view from the older generation.  The younger crowd had better watch out.  Waiting for God, with the main characters of Tom and Diana, shows us that older people are not ""dead"",  they are healthy and alive and can get into just as much mischief as the younger generation.  A terrific show to watch (especially if you are over the age of 50) that leaves one with a warmhearted feeling AND something to contemplate.  After all,  we will all be in the same position one day.",1294358400,3,537,4.484536082474227
4070718,5,B0035JHYIY,"I became addicted to Waiting for God watching it on PBS. Finally decided I wanted to see all the episodes and in order. It was worth it. Although I discovered I had already seen each episode, I still enjoyed every minute.  This is an excellent series and I highly recommend it for anyone who loves good comedy.  One of the things I like best is Diana's penchant for blunt honesty.  When she expresses her disdain for The Idiot Baines I think, ""he deserved that.""

Negatives:
1. The sound track was louder than I remember from PBS and at times it was distracted from the dialogue.
2. The discs were a little hard to remove from the cover.
3. Two discs had smudges, but they did not cause playback problems.
None of these are serious and I gave this series a top rating.",1290816000,,768,4.387323943661972
4070719,5,B0035JHYIY,I have loved Waiting For God ever since I saw it on PBS years ago. I moved to a rural area that no longer received the same PBS series not even on satellite. I am so happy this is now on DVD. My husband has fallen in love with it too. The DVD's are great quality and of course the comedy itself is wonderful. I just wish the series had run longer. It was sad when we got to the last one. We enjoyed them so much we started from the beginning again and laughed just as much.,1283644800,3,473,3.836734693877551
4070720,5,B0035JHYIY,"This is one of the best of the British comedy series out.
A curmudgeon and a loon make a great pair in beating the system.
The plots are so far out that they become possible.
Many hours of enjoyment for just a few bucks.",1282176000,3,220,4.0227272727272725
4070721,5,B0035JHYIY,I did not know about this series but friends of mine assured me that it was very popular in their area on their local PBS station.  They were right. It is not only entertaining but highlights the many things that happen to us as we age in a very humorous way.,1282089600,3,259,4.078431372549019
4070722,4,B0035JHYIY,This series is one of Britains best comedy series. Just about every episode is funny and almost a classic. So true to life yet very funny. All the actors are cast very well. I highly recommend it.,1281571200,5,196,4.324324324324325
4070723,5,B0035JHYIY,"When this BBC show first came out of course I was much younger and thought the show was a very funny comedy. Now years later I remembered the show and bought the collection. I was amazed now that I am approaching the age of the characters that it is not so much of a Comedy as a blatently real assesment of Old Age and what ""Pensioners"" go through. How there freedom is gradually taken away, the boredom, the medical problems the lonliness and on. The fact that the characters deal with all this in their own way and how it affected me is just a credit to great writing and acting.",1281139200,3,581,4.243243243243243
4070724,4,B0035JHYIY,"I had seen a few of these episodes on PBS and ordered the whole series.  I am watching it now.  British comedy at it's best!  The Brits have a different sense of humour, but once you become aclimated to it, it is addictive.
This was a good value!",1280793600,2,246,4.083333333333333
4070725,5,B0035JHYIY,Loved every episode and all the wonderful actors. Worth every cent I spent on this item.,1279584000,,88,4.5625
4070726,5,B0035JHYIY,"This is one of the finest comedies ever made on either side of the pond. I've been watching seasons 1 to 4 from the library's copies, and got my boyfriend hooked on it as well. I pre-ordered it right after it was announced in January. I got it a few days after it was released on May 26th. I am already very happy.

Tom and Diana are nearly polar opposites, but they get to be friends, and later, more, during this series. Always good to see The Idiot Baines put in his place.  The entire series, including two Christmas specials, are included, as well as a number of extras. I'll agree that this series was cut short too soon. I won't spoil the ending, but you won't see it coming.

Additionally, there are two Christmas specials, both are very good. However, the second Christmas special is my favorite--people get hurt! My kind of Christmas special!

The distinguishing factor for this show is that it takes the old standby of doddering, dumbed-down senior citizens and flips the equation. In Waiting For God, the ""old folks"" are shown for what they really are--intelligent, experienced, well-spoken, and dealing with the issues of aging, while they younger people are the dunces. No Botox or silicone here, either!  Stephanie Cole was awarded an OBE and won a BAFTA award for her role as Diana Trent, and also appreciated for bringing attention to the issues that face senior citizens every day. While it's not preachy, it's intelligent, funny, and leaves you wanting to go back to Bayview for another visit.

This would be a great gift for someone who enjoyed The Golden Girls as well. Waiting For God went on the air around the time that The Golden Girls went off the air, so the time frame is about the same.

LONG LIVE TOM AND DIANA!!!!",1275523200,52,1744,4.606451612903226
