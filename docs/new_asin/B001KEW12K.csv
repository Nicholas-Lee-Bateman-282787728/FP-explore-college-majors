8314860,3,B001KEW12K,A small gem of a movie! Enjoyed watching cameo appearance of Naseeruddin Shah and Roshan Seth. The unknown actor have done well in this movie.  The eccentric rich man played by Shah makes a surprising will. The twist at the end of the movie is not what viewers would have hoped for but more realistic. The irony is not lsot on the viewer.,1469232000,,338,4.365079365079365

8314863,5,B001KEW12K,"Delightful modern Indian fable. The story is about a motorized rickshaw driver who inherited it from his father. Amal is perfectly contented with his job, and wants only to be payed the amount indicated on the meter. At one point a customer, who happened to be a billionaire, is touched since he refused a tip of 3 Rupees. This man then puts him as the sole person to inherit his riches on his deathbed. A complicated fight ensues among the children who believe it is their inheritance. The story ends like a fable, which I don't want to elaborate for future viewers. Suffice to say it has a wonderful and touching end, like a fable. Highly recommended

8314864,5,B001KEW12K,"What a beautiful movie. It's so good to see a movie that focuses on the goodness and honesty of individuals. If Amal had been given the opportunity if attending school at a young age his unexpected gift would have improved the quality of life of his family.  However, if Amal had been literate and did inherit the large sum of money who is to say that he would have been happy? We will never know.
I loved the dvd. The quality was very good and the subtitles were very much welcomed. Thank you",1426464000,,493,4.301075268817204
