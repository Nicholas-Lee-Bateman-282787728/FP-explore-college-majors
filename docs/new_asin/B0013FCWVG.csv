3105672,4,B0013FCWVG,"This is still one of the most comprehensive documentaries on the short life and career of Marilyn.  MARILYN MONROE: BEYOND THE LEGEND (1987) carries a wealth of solid film clips and candid interviews with some of the friends and co-stars who knew the real Monroe.

Narrated by Monroe's ""Don't Bother to Knock"" leading man Richard Widmark, BEYOND THE LEGEND focuses on Monroe's professional career and personal life, but stops short at exploring the lurid and still highly-controversial aspects surrounding her untimely death.  The interviews are often very frank: Celeste Holm doesn't shy away from sharing what she thought of the young Monroe when she first arrived on the set of ""All About Eve"" in 1950.

Shelley Winters talks about the days when she and Marilyn were starlets dreaming of fame and husbands.  Director Joshua Logan discusses his surprise at the quality and depth of Monroe's performance in ""Bus Stop"" (and co-star Don Murray remembers the difficulties the director had in filming a crucial intimate scene in CinemaScope).  Susan Strasberg, whose family took Monroe in for a period of time, talks about the shy, insecure little girl inside the blonde bombshell body.  There are also interview segments with Sheree North, Laszlo Willinger and Clark Gordon.

There's only ever been one Marilyn.  This documentary paints a selective picture, but for her fans it will be a must-see.",1298592000,11,1395,5.164444444444444

I did not care so much for this video.

After all the photo of her standing on the grate with her dress blowing up is legendary. Just highlights her never give up attitude & perserverence.

3105705,5,B0013FCWVG,"I have just about purchased all of the Hollywood Collection's Greatest Stars and their biographies on DVD and all of them are excellent and well worth the money that I have paid. Each biography goes into great detail about the lives of the actors from the
1940's; 1950's; and 1960's; and the producers whom produced each of the biographies such as Marilyn Monroe, Charelston
Heston; Robert Mitchem; Walter Mattheau; Jack Lemmon; Yul Brynner, Shirley Mclaine; William Holden; Burt Lancaster and
others. These were real actors whom knew how to perfect their craft and knew how to act and all of the hardships they faced
signing contracting with the big Hollywood Moguls. These DVD biographies were absolutely wonderful and would make a fine
addition to your library collection. Also there was Gregory Peck; Ingrid Bergman; and other great actors of their time. It is very
sad that the movies industry is gone and no longer has the quality actors of the time of the baby boomers and prior. I wish that
the Hollywood Collection had made more biographies about the greatest actors and perhaps they will. I am so very happy they
were shipped in a timely manner and packaged beautifully. Thank you so very much to the Hollywod Collection.

Those shots of people pulling and grabbing and shoving and pushing are obnoxious mob scenes. Well , there was one shot near the end when she had come out of a hospital and she looked absolutely scared. And I can not say that I did not blame her.

It is too bad that she never realized how much people liked her as an actress. I think this Collection shows how much she cared for others. She was well beyond the dumb blond that was attached to her by the media. She was very well informed and a great performer. I think she was one of the best Hollywood had during her time and beyond.

It was very informative and cleared up many misconceptions people had about this wonderful actress who was ahead of her time.

If you haven't seen a bio about Marilyn and want to know about the side of her that wanted to be recognized for her acting ability, this will give you a good clue.  Having seen several already, this one had no new information for me.",1403049600,,259,4.16
3340204,5,B0013FCWVG,I had to write an essay on Marilyn and found out that I really didn't know anything about her!  This was a great resource!,1401148800,2,122,4.083333333333333
3340205,4,B0013FCWVG,"It was good but they did not have Marilyn speaking for her self much. Though you can see a lot from pictures and how any of those stars could like their fans is beyond me. Those shots of people pulling and grabbing and shoving and pushing are obnoxious mob scenes. Well , there was one shot near the end when she had come out of a hospital and she looked absolutely scared. And I can not say that I did not blame her. She was a great comedian.",1399161600,,443,4.045454545454546
3340206,4,B0013FCWVG,"Fairly good documentary. Very nice collection of photos, video clips, and interviews. If you loved Marilyn you should see this.",1398470400,,127,5.4
3340207,5,B0013FCWVG,"Fascinating documentary. What I liked about this is it didn't focus on the Kennedy's or her death, but had some great old footage and showed her to be a very talented actress and comedienne. Well done.",1395964800,,201,4.611111111111111
3340208,4,B0013FCWVG,"Wish it went into more details  Like to know more about her childhood  and life with the ""Kennedys""  More on movies",1395187200,,115,4.380952380952381
3340209,5,B0013FCWVG,"She is as interesting now as she was when she was alive. In fact I think she is even more interesting now. It is too bad that she never realized how much people liked her as an actress. I think this Collection shows how much she cared for others. She was well beyond the dumb blond that was attached to her by the media. She was very well informed and a great performer. I think she was one of the best Hollywood had during her time and beyond.

It was very informative and cleared up many misconceptions people had about this wonderful actress who was ahead of her time.

Enjoy it if you watch it.",1393372800,,598,4.191304347826087

3340213,1,B0013FCWVG,This is just a collection of quotes about Marilyn in different stages of her life. Most quotes did not feel very insightful,1377388800,,123,4.636363636363637
3340214,5,B0013FCWVG,i like seeing biography about movie star i really like...marilyn monroe is no exception...the story is sad of course and you get to see how she lived and died...she was a great star even though she never thought she was...only after her death did she soar....the bio is pretty good to see...i enjoyed it.,1369785600,,304,4.648148148148148
3340215,4,B0013FCWVG,"It's well worth watching. For the most part, the interviewees avoid talking about the difficulties of working with Monroe. No real discussion of her depression or the use of prescription drugs. Still, it's good to be reminded that Monroe was a working actress who performed well in her short career.",1365379200,,299,5.0
3340216,5,B0013FCWVG,I'm a big fan of Marilyn Monroe so there was little here that was new except for the interview with Robert Mitchum.  It was interesting to learn he knew Marilyn when she was Norma Jeane Baker.  He worked with her husband.,1363824000,8,221,4.365853658536586
3340217,2,B0013FCWVG,"I thought it would be more modern, but it was from the late 60's-70's.  Not bad but way to old and is more of the old style Hollywood ""puff piece"".",1363219200,3,147,3.9
3340218,5,B0013FCWVG,"There is a reason she is the ICON she is today. She was far ahead of her time, because she is timeless. Marilyn never looks dated, she could fit in today. I just wished she had been able to live to a ripe old age, cause she still would have been beautiful.
Love all the people's comments who knew her well.",1363219200,5,306,4.032786885245901

8250658,5,B0013FCWVG,"I enjoyed this movie a great deal, it was interesting to hear from other people about how Marilyn was.  I still do not understand why she killed herself, but I guess no one will.",1519516800,,178,4.235294117647059
