4194850,2,B003UAKEDA,"I suppose in the budding subgenre of revenge/torture-porn, '7 Days' distinguishes itself as a superficially polished production that pointedly takes little glee in its subject matter (as echoed in a scene where the killer-cum-victim taunts his victim-cum-torturer for not enjoying his newfound depravity very much). But once the good doctor-- father of the central plot's raped-and-murdered girl-- snaps, the show is all but over: he knows how it's going to end, the cops know how it's going to end, and unfortunately for us the dead-end script makes no attempt to dissuade the viewer from this static sense of fatalism. And so, for the 70-some intervening minutes of the film, we can expect no emotional nuance, no psychological insight, no dramatic tension; we are left simply to watch the doctor mope about (for he has already unraveled), venting his unhappiness on everything from pressboard furniture to the mother of another murder victim (okay, that I didn't see coming, but its unpredictability is nullified by its contrived arbitrariness) to, of course, the pedophiliac-killer himself. The whole exercise is nothing short of mind-numbing. In fact, aside from its impressive cinematography, the only redeeming element in the movie is a sparse, solid performance by the lead detective on the case, grief-stricken from having recently lost his wife in a convenience-store robbery-gone-wrong, who acts convincingly as a human foil to the protagonist's feral persona. Too bad his appearances are few and far between.",1302652800,,1520,5.390756302521009

4194852,4,B003UAKEDA,"Seven Days is a very hard film to watch because it does not shy away from any of the elements that make it such a powerful story.
The most unpleasant to view is the brutal and most vivid crime scene I have ever witnessed on film involving a child.
The fact that I saw this and they show the father of the little girl "" who happens to be a doctor"" viewing the same scene lends to the fact that I was not the least bit ""ok maybe a little"" Disturbed by what he does to his daughters rapist and murderer when he cleverly gets him as his captive and keeps him for seven days and tortures him all while torturing himself as well.

The film makes you think and it makes you think about things like does being this close to the person that killed and raped your child make you feel better ,give you a sense of justice or does it just make you imagine and visualize the entire tragic ordeal over and over again?
It is very brutal and there are some serious questions that arise.
I didn't see it as a horror film but more of a psychological drama.all in all a very well acted and executed film.",1296518400,,1084,4.113207547169812
4194853,4,B003UAKEDA,"""Does knowing your wife's murderer is behind bars make life any more bearable?""

""7 Days"" is a powerful and brutal film about a happily married surgeon who as a result of the rape and murder of his daughter falls into a dark obsession with revenge. WARNING: this movie is VERY graphic and not for the easily offended or people with a weak stomach. ""7 Days"" deals with a very difficult subject matter and does not hold back.

Claude Legault (Bruno) and Rmy Girard (Herv) did an incredible job with the acting.  Fanny Mallette (Sylvia) also did wonderfully, though I would have liked to have seen more of her throughout the movie.  I found myself wondering why the director did not feature more of the mother's struggle.  There is one scene in particular that showcases the raw talent Legault and Mallette have.  It was a tour de force of brilliant acting.

However, the movie is not without its faults.  One of the more interesting decisions made by the director was to not include a musical soundtrack.  This worked I think in favor of the atmosphere but there could have been some fill in music at times. It also seemed like the director was trying to fill holes in the story a bit too hard.  There were a couple of things that didn't make much sense to do and the ending left a little to be desired.

""7 Days"" may not be the cream of the crop of revenge flicks, but it does succeed where others fail.  It is such a harrowing subject matter and is shot in such a realistic way that you are forced to have an emotional response, whether you like it or not.  There are some powerful visuals that will stay with you for days, possibly months after.

4194854,3,B003UAKEDA,"Some reviewers have commented that this isn't just a torture, revenge movie. They say it transcends into deeper areas of the situation concerning redemption and such, but if this is true, I didn't see it.

A wealthy doctor's daughter is kidnapped, beaten, raped and killed partly due to the fact that dad was too tired to accompany her while she delivered her birthday invitations and mom wanted a quickie from dad before she headed off to work at the gallery. The culprit is apprehended in, what will be, a pretty open and shut case. Dad devises a way to kidnap said culprit prior to trial, deliver him to a remote cottage and get barbaric all over him.

The doctor knows his stuff and can keep the degenerate alive while he does all manner of unseemly things to his person. But there isn't much more to it than that. The entire process is to take 7 days and, if this were really a sincere effort, there would be much more interaction between the two, and the doctor, who isn't really a bad guy, would come to realize that this whole thing is wrong. That arc doesn't happen. There is some exchange between the two but nothing of any real substance and nothing that changes the situation. There is also the whole issue of guilt on the heads of the parents. They both feel it and there is some discussion of it between them but, again, it's brief and barely breaks the surface of the issue. Much of the movie is the doctor doing his thing all over the perp. You DO see him degenerate, through near constant drinking, into a puddle of incoherent self pity and bouts of hallucination but, again, there is no arc, only a downward spiral. His final words underscore this fact.

The acting, directing and all the other production values are top shelf. The problem lies in the script. After day four, I found myself becoming impatient and started looking at my watch. This is not a good thing. In the Saw movies, much of the focus is on the cleverness of the kill methods. There is little clever in this movie and, since it lacks any real depth, there is little reason to watch it.

Unless you're a die hard fan of this sort of thing, I wouldn't bother. There are any number of better movies with which to spend your time.",1285804800,5,2215,4.448275862068965
4194855,4,B003UAKEDA,"Although the marketing hype is clearly trying to push this French-language Canadian production as yet another torture-porn horror movie in the 'Saw' vein, this is actually a very somber and realistic story about loss, forgiveness and revenge, although one which features a lot more graphic violence and gore than, say, Death Wish.

The basic premise is straightforward: Claude Legault plays Bruno Hamel, a successful Canadian surgeon who suffers a devastating family loss at the hands of a child molester and decides to personally administer his special brand of justice by kidnapping the perpetrator, transporting him to a remote location and torturing him over the course of 7 days while keeping him alive with his medical skills and equipment.

Most of the tension, and the most interesting aspect of the film, comes from the contrast between the main character's actions and his motivation. Will he be caught by the police before he has a chance to complete his plan? Will he give himself up or will he kill his prisoner? The extremely gruesome nature of Bruno's vendetta doesn't help the audience pick a side: we sympathize with his plight and want him to get away with it, but the violence keeps us at arm's length and prevents us from fully identifying with him.

I won't spoil the plot, but the film manages to remain engaging, though not exactly fast-paced, for most of the running time, thanks to a couple of plot detours along the way (including the involvement of another victimized parent). The graphic violence is strong and definitely goes for realism rather than being a showcase for ingenious effects (no fancy ""death machines"" and flashy editing a la ""Saw""). Fun for the whole family this ain't!

Too graphic and explicit for mainstream audiences, and not flashy and 'entertaining' enough for the horror fan crowd, it's clear why the film bypassed theaters entirely in the US and went straight to DVD. Ultimately, the story is a bit too derivative to offer real surprises for anyone who has seen more than a few films of this kind, and the tone is so bleak and downbeat that very few people will pick this as their evening's source entertainment. But if you are looking for a serious and very explicit/graphic revenge thriller, this is a good candidate.",1284768000,9,2271,4.921671018276762
4194856,5,B003UAKEDA,"First off, totally ignore the description that has been offered for this film on Amazon and I dare-say the packaging as well. This is NOT a horror film in the style of ""Last House on the Left."" It has absolutely nothing to do with that particular original or remake. And to even think about comparing this to SAW or HOSTEL is beyond insulting to the integrity and intelligence of this film. ""7 Days"" is a dark, disturbing and very sad glimpse into the depths of hell that one grieving man will sink in order to get even with the murderer / rapist of his child. Without any background score whatsoever, zero punches pulled and performances from the entire cast that border on 'perfect', ""7 Days"" manages to effortlessly and smoothly take you in from the opening frames. And when it's over, it's really not over. Most audiences will not be able to shake the impact of this film for days, if that soon.

""7 Days"" is simply one of the most provocative and gut-wrenching films I have ever seen; terrifyingly detailed without sinking to traditional over-the-top horror with the purpose of trying to shock jaded audiences. At about the ninety minute point, I thought the film might be running out of ideas, but the filmmaker is far too good for that. For the final half-hour or so, ""7 Days"" shifts into startlingly unexpected territory, with one sequence near the end that produces more chills than any twenty Stephen King novels.

As far as content, this is extremely violent and gruesome in a clinical sense, the language is raw at times and there is an abundance of nudity. This is a very adult film.",1283731200,11,1596,4.636042402826855

8405778,5,B003UAKEDA,I was told this movie was good but boy I wasn't expect it to be this enjoyable. The actors are all believable. Especially the husband I felt his anger and all the other feeling he was showing with just his body. The conversations between the cop and the husband are chilling. And this movie had one of the most brain imprinting ending I've ever seen. And the most unsettling part of the film is the constant dead silence. I don't believe there was much music in this film at all! I give this movie a 10 outta 10!!!,1488240000,,514,4.255102040816326
8405779,3,B003UAKEDA,"7 Days is a Quebec Canadian dialect French language film with English subtitles.  Reading this paragraph further may enable you to work out some spoilers. I didn't know much about this going in other than it was a father delving out vengeance over 7 days on the man who he thinks responsible for a heinous crime against his daughter. I have to say I thought 7 Days would be one of two things, it would either have gone in a more entertaining revenge on the guy who did unthinkable things on the daughter by the father (who was surgeon after all so had the skills not to accidentally kill), failing entertaining a more gory cringe worthy delving out film.  Or alternatively it would have been clever, full of twists, or blindsides in the plot, such as maybe the guy being tortured was innocent or perhaps the dad himself killed the daughter and was just doing this out of guilt on a guy he thought he had done it to other children. I mean this is marketed in different places as either a thriller, or as a horror film, and it really isn't either of those genres.  7 Days certainly isn't clever, in fact it's unclever at times, from the police who let the father contaminate a crime scene (at the time he would have been the number one suspect, as we know most real cases this sort of crime isn't done by a stranger, especially when his alibi was that he was asleep), which would have made prosecuting him or a real attacker harder.  I get the father's natural instinct would be to run to and touch the child but there's three police officers there, they also knew he was coming, they could easily have restrained him or at least pulled him away before he starts exploring the body where evidence would obviously be left behind. But they seem to not care and give him free reign to do whatever he wants to her corpse. I also thought the getting the prisoner from the authorities scene was rushed, I didn't really get how he sedated the guard. Also surely a prison transport van would be tracked on GPS or something.  Not to mention this is a high media coverage accused man, that they would expect to be attacked or at least encounter protesters banging on or throwing stuff at the van, so you'd think there'd be other vehicles such police cars escorting or following it.

The main police negotiator/investigator guy spends his time off watching security camera footage in a loop of his wife getting shot in the head in a convenient store or petrol station. You'd think dealing with her loss would be better done watching a home video of her when she's alive.  The movie only very briefly touches on the fact that both he and the doctor have gone through a tragic violent loss but doesn't ever do much with that.  The movie also doesn't have a soundtrack, which I guess is supposed to make you feel this more real but ultimately just makes the slow scenes (and there's a lot of them) duller.

The reason the film is called 7 days if you were wondering and haven't seen it is because the father plans on keeping the guy alive for the 7 days until his daughter would have turned 9. It's watchable once, but ultimately slow and boring and when it's over you just feel that it was missing something, well more than something.  If you're the type of person that has no problem watching murder and torture but for some reason, if a film throws in a bit of a nudity and you want it banned, well there are a lot of scenes of full frontal (well entire body) male nudity in 7 Days so this probably isn't the film for you.",1473120000,,3509,4.409582689335394
8405780,5,B003UAKEDA,"How would you react if your child was in the 1st or 2nd grade and was murdered?  With a big belly laugh seconds before you give a press conference to say how sad you are and to promote a donation page on facebook?  When asked if this would disrupt your Christmas would you answer yes and no?  Would you be smiling and laughing while being interviewed on television just days after your child was murdered saying you are happy your child is with Jesus?  Would you forgive the person who murdered your child the very next day on national television?  After seeing your 7 or 8 year old child's dead, beaten body do you think the coroner would make 10 to 15 jokes at a national press conference? If he did, would that be OK with you?  Would you decide to not attend your murdered child's funeral because you wanted to visit relatives in Florida and leave your wife to face the funeral alone?  If you believe in fairy tales I highly recommend for you to not watch this movie.  It will skew your whole perspective of reality.

7 Days is a realistic movie about how someone might respond if their 8 year old daughter was raped and murdered by a heartless creep. The lives of the Hamels are completely turned upside down.  No laughs and smiles here.  Notice how Sylvie (Jasmine's mother played by Fanny Mallette - incredible performance!) goes from a normal happy person to distraught within seconds of the news of her daughter's disapperance and then grief striken, withdrawn and depressed at the realization of her daughter's death.  See Sylvie completely break down with hysterical, uncontrolable tears while her husband Bruno (played by Claude Legault - absolutely one of the best actors I have ever seen in a movie) tries to console her.

7 Days is a superbly acted, well written and well directed movie that is very disturbing and realistic.  There is no music soundtrack - not one note - which I think adds to the realism of the film.  Without giving too much away, this is a revenge film (Bruno is a doctor!) but the film goes far deeper than just that.  It is a psychological study on the ways violence affects different people, such as the detective (great performance by Remy Girard), and the possible ramifications of vengence.  Anthony (the creepy murderer - magnificent performance by Martin Dubreuil) is no 90 pound weakling carrying 50 pounds of guns and ammunition through a hole 2 feet by 2 feet in a bullet proof window.  Oh no, Anthony is a sociopath bully with absolutely no feelings towards his victims or their family members.

This movie might be a little bit too realistic for people who believe everything they see on the news.  I highly recommend this movie.  Really, really well done.  Not for the squeamish.  Also, this movie is in French with English subtitles so you will have to pay attention while you watch.  The first time I saw this movie, I watched the movie without subtitles.  I couldn't understand a word of what they were saying and I still thought it was great.

When I see the mother of an allegedly murdered 6 year old girl on national television joking about how her daughter used to make liver lips in the window of the school bus and then break out in uproarious laughter just days after her daughter was allegedly killed, questions I would want to ask the mother are:  1. Are you in need of psychiatric care?  2. Is your daughter really dead?  3.  Did you ever really have a daughter?  Next time the people who make up stories for the news should consult the director of this film Daniel Grou for a few pointers on how to make them more realistic.",1419379200,,3587,4.575235109717869

8405783,5,B003UAKEDA,"Highly recommended!  As a fan of revenge films I have to say that this one by far hit the hardest on many different levels. Forget death wish. This movie addresses a fathers feelings, feelings of sadness, anger and eventually, madness. When he loses all that is pure and good in his life he then finds himself becoming that which he had despised. The director gets nothing but praise for his effort on this film. No soundtrack here to remind the viewer that it was just a movie. He convened such a sense of realism so much so that you felt you were watching every parents worst nightmare unfold.  After watching this, I had to ask myself, What would you do?",1375401600,,657,4.466666666666667
8405784,4,B003UAKEDA,"This is a very grim and pretty disturbing film. I agree with other members on that. Its not as disturbing and brutally bloody as many movies I have seen, like Hostel or Cannibal Holocaust for example. What it is though is a solidly crafted film that tells the story of what some people are capable of when they have had thier lives turned upside down by a horrific tragedy. In the case of this film a young child is raped and then bruatally murdered. The question this film posses is What if you had the chance to torture the man who killed your own kid? Would you do it? And if you did how far would you go? Would it make you feel any better you think? Or would it make you feel worse? Would you feel like a hero, or would it ruin your life? The film examins all of these puzzling questions. Some are answered and others are not. But the film is a dark journey into that world of uncertainty. I think this movie might be an important film to watch for some of those who have lost a child or family member to a sadistic killer and never got the revenge they so longed for. This movie could help exorcize some of those demons of anger and hatred. Its done so believably and realistically that it might help some people visualize the senario and maybe they might feel relieved they never had to chance to find out what they might be capable of. The movie illustrates how simply lost a person can become if they give way to their hatred and anger and get the revenge they so dreamed of. The film seems to say something like this could in reality drive you to madness and destroy you, and maybe vengence is not as sweet as it might seem. For others who have lost a loved one in such a horrible way the film could open up old wounds and maybe in the end its best if these individuals skip the film altogether. But yea, this movie was pretty disturbing, heartless and brutal. But it was also extremely well made and well acted, and the story was rather dream-like and slow but riveting and intense.",1367712000,2,1992,4.258575197889182

It is a heart-stopping thriller...great directing...acting and editing.  From the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, this horrific gem will have you on the edge of your seat.  What made this even more dramatic was the fact that there was no soundtrack...no music...nothing.  There's simply a script, dialogue and excellent cinematography.  All 5 stars...without reservation.  One question:  How far would you go to get revenge on the man who raped and killed your little girl?  Not for the squeamish...definitely not for the youngsters.  A film that will leave you restless and chilled to the bone.  ""7 Days"" will not be enough time to get over this flick.",1317772800,,782,4.984496124031008
