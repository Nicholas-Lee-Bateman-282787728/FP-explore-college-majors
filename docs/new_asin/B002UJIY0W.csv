3991251,5,B002UJIY0W,This dvd covers everything you must see in Italy. It is well narrated and even tells of the culture and history as well as the sights. Highly recommended.,1276819200,3,154,4.535714285714286
3991252,3,B002UJIY0W,"Although coming from Europe, having been in Rome many times and loving most of what Italy has to offer (a.o. history and food), for some reason this DVD did not impress me very much. It is difficult to say what the reason might be. Maybe the high percentage of aerial views, maybe some repetition here and there, difficult to pinpoint. If you do not know anything about Italy, it might be a start, but....., after having viewed this one, you might want to learn more about this fascinating country and rightfully so.",1276300800,6,516,4.619565217391305
3991253,5,B002UJIY0W,i bought this for a family member who had previously toured italy. the dvd gives a birds-eye view of the various regions and historical areas!,1267833600,3,142,4.72
3991254,5,B002UJIY0W,Beautifully realized. Having spent so much time in Italy with my family there I find this rich and rewarding and satisfying an oft needed revisiting when feeling homesick.  A very nice way to return to Iyaly.,1266710400,7,208,4.777777777777778
3991255,5,B002UJIY0W,"Close-up footage of artisans, fine artists, musicians, fishermen, bakers, Alps herders, wine makers, and more. An introduction of the beautiful arts relationship with the culture of Italy, done with excellent background music. Classic, folk, instrumental and vocal is all provided demonstrating while viewing the rich fine arts culture of the country sometimes known only for spaghetti and pizza. The producers also filmed the ""Visions of..."" series of helicopter HD documentaries of many European countries.  This DVD has some similar air footage, but more of wonderful ground footage, and very, very up-close shots of details like restoration of masterpieces, wood carvers tools in the act of cutting, and faces of the Italian people. A more personal look at Italy culture.

A second hour-long episode of this public television series has filmed art and history, and often architecture which combines both. We get to see it with the educational narration about the culture and living among such a splendid country. Yet the Italian people balance technology and contemporary change with their unique past. You will see accordions, Murano glass, alabaster, cut glass, oral jewelry and more, up close, being created. And traditional cuisine holds its own against fast food attempts.  Pure foods+local wines+talk = the unchangeable Italian dining culture.

The last episode offers the Roman roads to today's Autostrada demonstrating a modern Italy striving to continue the rich heritage left by past inventors and creators.  Scenes of today entice viewers to become tourists.  An amazing 21st century look at Italian culture. A total of 3 episodes, each about one hour.

BONUS
Closed Captioning available, helpful to see the spelling of names.
A 15 minute segment showing ""Visions of Italy"" an aerial helicopter footage taken from an earlier released DVD. It has background music but no narration, but does have locations scripted overlaying the film footage. A continual motion flying from/to cities, country, Alps to coasts, and it's worth taking a look at the whole travel documentary series: ""Visions of Europe"" (see my reviews). If you really like Italy educational documentary, I'd also recommend ""Brian Sewell's Grand Tour of Italy"".

This DVD is highly recommended for travel documentary fans, Italian/Americans, those studying the Italian country or people, and anyone considering an Italian visit.  A good library choice, schools or public.",1259452800,35,2448,5.472148541114058

8381273,5,B002UJIY0W,"Magnificently filmed. A great blend of history and the contemporary.  Paul Sorvino's narrative borders on the poetic. If you ever want a virtual reality trip to Italy, this is it.",1395619200,,179,4.966666666666667

8381275,2,B002UJIY0W,"Poor choice as the videos, while beautiful, are highly repetitive through the 3 separate stories. The narration is poorly written and surprisingly unemotional reading from Paul Sorvino. After 30 minutes we shut this off as it was boring and poorly organized. Lots of fly over shots.",1357257600,2,282,5.1521739130434785
8381276,3,B002UJIY0W,"With a tremendous desire to travel to Italy myself, I watch any dvd about Italy that I can get my hands on! I bought this dvd on sale at Amazon for approx. $8, and for the price, I would say I got my money's worth. I would have been highly disappointed if I had paid full price, however, which is why I only gave it 3 stars. The cinematography was VERY well done and the narrator did a fine job, but it left me longing for details. I liken this dvd to a wonderful coffee table book. If that is what you are looking for, then I highly recommend this dvd. If not, then I recommend watching Samantha Brown's dvds on Italy - they make you feel like you are right there!",1332720000,3,665,4.045454545454546
8381277,5,B002UJIY0W,"How could anyone not like this wonderful documentary! I would recommend it in a heart beat to anyone planning a trip to Italy, or someone who can only dream of going.  The usual tourist places and out of the way unheard of places were presented beautifully....the foods, arts, music and history. An added plus was the soothing voice of Paul Sorvino, and a few clips of Francis Ford Coppola..",1301616000,,391,4.666666666666667
