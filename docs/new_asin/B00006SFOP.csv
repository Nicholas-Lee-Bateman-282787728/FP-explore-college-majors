7973049,5,B00006SFOP,"I did this video for the first time yesterday...and alls I can say is ouch!  This video is approximately an hour long, and well worth the buy.  What I really like about it is that it takes the best ""buns"" clips from all different videos and pieces them together.  It keeps it interesting and exciting.  One person in their review had said that he sometimes only works one side, and then they cut to another clip.  This happens only 2 or 3 times, and is not really a big deal.  I just rewound to the beginning of that exercise, and did it on the opposite site.  This video REALLY hones in on that butt, but also has alot of work for the hamstrings, quads, and inner and outer thighs.  That whole area of my body is nice and sore! =)  As for Billy, he is wonderfully motivational as usual, and I find myself working harder when hes looking at me, and answering back when he asks questions.  I count outloud, and even scream like Shelly when it gets hard.  This video is a good time and I would DEFINATELY 100% reccomend it!",1047513600,8,1021,4.265625
7973050,4,B00006SFOP,"I did this tape yesterday, and my butt hurts today!! (specially on the outer side of the butt).
This tape is 47 minutes long, and it is a compilation of the best butt moves in the tae bo live volumes.
If you don't have the live volumes 2-12 this video is definitely worth having, because it has lots of new kicks!
It has the normal tae bo warm up, then moves to squats/lunges, then it is some side and back kicks, then moves to the mat exercises after about 30 minutes of kicks.
The mat exercises has some funky editing at the beginning, you're on the floor then it is edited to where you are standing up doing plies, then after 3 seconds it is edited to some more floor exercises.
Besides that this tape is great! it is long enough, you don't need an entire hour to work on your butt!!!
The only part that i don't like is that funky editing and for some kicks it is only done on 1 side! (and thats for 2 different sets).
But for the rest, this will definitely workout and shape your bum!!",1043539200,11,989,4.15625
