My copy has a production error at the beginning with the dumb bell row- only the right side of the body is targeted and the pace of the video doesn't allow the user to sneak in the missing side.  I don't know who does the quality assurance for Ms. Smith's videos but unfortunately this is not the first time I have had missing segments.

4698842,4,B005GYXNT0,"""Ageless with Kathy Smith: Total Body Turnaround"" contains three short workouts, with Ms. Smith as the sole instructor and demonstrator.  The focus is on combatting the aging process for those who are already active.  Some may classify these workouts as between beginning and intermediate, or possibly intermediate, designed to help people similar to Ms. Smith maintain their strength or vitality, along with their balance and flexibility.

Here is the breakdown.

Total Circuit (about 24 minutes)
Ms. Smith alternates between cardio bursts and weight training. Dumbbells are used for the following exercises.
Bent over row
Biceps curl
Shoulder press
One legged deadlift
Modified lunge
Triceps extension & other related movements
Usually, low and high impact versions are shown for the aerobics.  This workout also includes squats and pushups.  It has its own warm up and a stretch cool down.

Total Balance (about 20 minutes)
This workout is a mix of cardio and balance work.  It also includes plies, 1st position work, and double squats.  You may want a wall or chair to balance.  It has its own warm up and stretch cool down.

Total Energy (about 20 minutes)
The workout begins with stretches and ends in stretches.  This workout includes standing light movements, floor movements, and a little yoga.  A mat is needed.

~~~

There are also two very short bonus workouts from other instructors.

Upper Body Tone & Stretch from the ""Exhale Core Fusion: Lean and Toned"" DVD uses weights. (under 10 minutes)

It also includes a short yoga practice from the ""Yoga for Beginners"" DVD. (7 minutes, 26 seconds)",1321920000,149,1605,5.111538461538461

4698854,5,B005GYXNT0,Great mix of exercise routines. A group of us use this DVD to work out to during our lunchtime at work. Everyone likes it.,1467417600,,122,4.125
4698855,5,B005GYXNT0,"There are so many Kathy Smith workouts it is hard to know which one to select. I saw this one and I wanted something that would help me work out my whole body. This definitely does. It has three main approximately 20 minute workouts: Total Circuit, Total Balance and Total Energy. They are fun to do three days in a row.

The Total Circuit workout is 23:42 minutes and helps you burn calories and firm your body. There are cardio bursts and bicep curls as well as a shoulder press. You will be using weights during the sections in between the cardio. I felt this all over in my legs, core and arms. There are also some push ups and lunges. If you don't modify it, it can be a little knee intensive if you twist a lot. I modified the cardio so it was OK for me and it is easy to do. So in this workout you'll be doing cardio and using weights to work the upper and lower body. I was sore the next day!

The Total Balance workout is intense at times but gets plenty of lymph flowing because of all the arm raises. Your muscles are going to ache and there are some dancer-style moves. You will be doing some yoga to help you stretch. I found this workout very fun and each exercise had its own balance challenges.

The Total Energy workout is the most fun you'll have working out. There are a few bellydance moves and some yoga and pilates exercises. I felt this workout did not wear me out but made my mind more alert and my body feel stretched out and relaxed. So if you want to feel more alive and flexible this is a good choice. I'm glad I did this on the third day as I really needed the stretching.

I found that these 20 minute workouts were good to do all on their own after doing 30 minutes of walking on the treadmill. But the Total Energy workout is fun to do on its own just for the joy of life it gives you.

So if you are looking for more balance in your life, want to be more energetic and want to be stronger and leaner, this will probably interest you. I'm glad I bought this even before I'd tried it out. It is going to be well worth the chance I took. I'd like to look for other Kathy Smith workouts that have stretches in them. If you know of one, please leave me a comment.

Her videos are all super great.  I'm in my early 30s, but had back surgery a few months ago.  I really like her stuff, because it's easy to modify if need be, is low impact, but is still a great workout.  She combines balance with strength and cardio in one segment, which I think is really great (once you have back surgery, people aren't allowed to laugh when you slip on the ice anymore; my back is 80 years old)- I get much less fearful when walking around MN in the winter.",1457913600,4,497,4.145833333333333

4698864,5,B005GYXNT0,This is classic Kathy Smith!  I loved her workouts in the 80's and I still love her now.  I found the workouts to be challenging for my out of shape self...and I can see they will be for some time.  Nice thing about her workouts is you can work as hard at it as you want.  I love the middle workout for balance.  Very challenging (for me) and a part of fitness us +50 year olds need to think about.,1441670400,2,398,3.925

4698866,5,B005GYXNT0,"I give it 5 stars because this workout video is tailored to me, middle aged used to be in shape person.  If you are a hard core workout person, then this would probably be too easy for you.  I had it on my shelf for a year (my bad), and finally took it out.  LOVE the short 20 minute work out options.  If they are too long, it is too hard to want to do them.  And you can stream the 3 together, so you really have the option of 20, 40 or 60 minutes of working out.  I prefer doing the circuit segment, which is more motion and light weight use.  20 mins of it and you feel like you did something.  The other 2 are by no means easy workouts, but just a different intensity.

I truthfully remember doing the Kathy Smith videos back in the 80's and 90's and she sure hasn't changed much...stayed in better shape than me for sure.  I didn't find her noises and peppy attitude annoying, she definitely keeps the energy level up so you don't have time to slow down.  For the price, you get a good workout and don't need a lot of accessories beyond some light weights.",1427932800,2,1062,4.082125603864735
4698867,3,B005GYXNT0,It's okay some of the 3 different workouts get boring and same things in each.

4698874,5,B005GYXNT0,Kathy's boundless energy is contagious and there is no doubt that she knows her stuff. There are four sections each working a different part of the body.

4698885,4,B005GYXNT0,"I was looking for lighter workouts to do to alternate with more vigorous ones from The Firm. Total Body Turnaround fits the bill. One section is not too difficult aerobics.

4698886,5,B005GYXNT0,"Three different 20-min workouts provides ample variety whether done on different days or all at one.  I like to do them all at once because they each have different moves and make a nice 60-min unit.  For the first one you'll need shoes and 3-lb weights.  There's some weight lifting and dance moves, heavy on the cardio.  For the second one, toss the shoes and weights--you don't need them.  More cardio and dance moves and some balance exercises.  The last one is done with a mat and involves intense stretching--very relaxing after all that cardio!  Note that when I say cardio, it's not extreme--this is intended for an older crowd, I think. So it's enough to work up a sweat but it won't leave you wiped out.  Kathy does the workouts alone and adds some commentary, but not too chatty.",1390262400,7,790,4.5928571428571425
4698887,5,B005GYXNT0,Just about anyone can profit from this circuit workout tape.  It is easy or hard enough to give everyone something beneficial in the 20 minute workout.

4698888,5,B005GYXNT0,"I love this DVD.  Kathy Smith is a great instructor and always gives you all the info you need to keep good form and is through right from the start.  It's a good workout for those of us on the run, by doing a 20 min workout, or you can do all three workouts if you have the time.  Kathy Smith is through and she really knows what she is doing, her experience really shines through.  Great for beginners and intermediates.",1383264000,4,422,4.172839506172839
4698889,5,B005GYXNT0,"Exercise videos are all about what your own fitness level is and what you want from a workout. I love this workout because it gives me exactly what I want: aerobics, weight-bearing exercise, balance practice, and a nice, long stretch routine that incorporates some of my favorite yoga moves, while leaving me feeling energized and relaxed.

I also love it because I have been working out to Kathy Smith videos for about 25 years, am close to her in age, and know her moves very well. Whatever stage of life I'm in, she has produced a video that fits it. Though I am physically very fit, someone younger might indeed find this tape too easy. I, however, find it plenty challenging--especially the balance workout, which is extremely well-designed in my opinion. I like the ""full circuit"" aerobic and weight portion as well because it's designed to build bone density.(I do occasionally supplement it with heavier weight-lifting routines, however.) To avoid injury, I've modified the squats and jumps somewhat until I get used to this particular workout. I also find it useful to warm up with a ten minute march before beginning the aerobics portion.

This is a great full body workout, one of Kathy Smith's best.",1382400000,7,1211,4.87378640776699

4698894,5,B005GYXNT0,"I bought this video after getting to sample one of the 20 minute segments through SparkPeople.com.  The segment I tried was a yoga/pilates type routine to increase energy.  It did get me moving and wasn't too strenuous or difficult.  So, honestly, I thought the other segments might be a little too easy for me - I consider myself to be in reasonable shape at age 45.  Still, I bought the video to help shake up my workout routine.  I tried the first 20 minute segment tonight - the total body cardio and strength training workout.  It was a great challenge!  I had to use lighter or no weights for some exercises, and use some of the modifications of the more intense moves.  But, I am now motivated to tackle this routine without compromising.  I have not tried the 3rd and last segment, which is for improving balance.  But, I'm looking forward to tackling this too.",1375142400,,869,4.548387096774194

Very nice work out.  I highly recommend this DVD if you are starting out physical activity and you are a little older.  The three work outs will help you get moving, and they have enough variety in them that you can stretch, tone, and do a little resistance training and feel like you are doing something.

The Total Circuit is - no surprise - a circuit workout that has uses dumbbells for some pretty standard weightlifting exercises (curls, rows, etc.). Total Balance mixes balance and cardio work. Finally, Total Energy is a very light cardio workout with some decent stretches.

If you are a fan of Kathy Smith, I think this is a good video to pick up. There is a reason Kathy Smith has been successful for so long - she's a great instructor and she provides a solid workout. I don't think this will ""totally turnaround"" your body, but it's a good way to start. I personally like the intensity level, but I suffer from MS and fatigue and balance are issues for me.

I was fortunate enough to receive this through Amazon Vine, but I feel the DVD is priced very fairly. Recommended.",1366243200,3,991,4.593220338983051
4698903,4,B005GYXNT0,"It's been years since I've popped in a workout DVD. Kathy Smith's Ageless DVD is reminding me of that very well. She has me worn out in 10 minutes. Ageless offeres three workout options that can be done separately or combined to a 40 or 60 minute full body workout.

The first routine is circuit training. Kathy goes through a cycle of upbeat moves to get the heartbeat going, followed by some muscle burning strength exercises to tone muscle. While the moves are not complicated, they sure burn if you're not in shape. Both upper and lower body are targeted.

The second routine is focused on balance but is also a muscle burner as well (for us who are out of shape or new to it). Big moves help keep the heart rate up while working on tone and balance.

The third routine is a slower stretch and yoga routine. This is more of what I need to get started in the morning when I feel like a pretzel.

Kathy looks quite buff in this DVD. While she is looking older, she is aging well and seems quite the spunk. Wow, is she sporting muscles.

I feel this DVD is good for beginners, those who have fallen off the wagon and out of shape, and intermediates who prefer to keep their movements uncomplicated but still challenging. While Kathy does use weights, not having any won't hold you back. While Kathy does show some snappy pylometric moves, she also encourages to modify it down if you cannot do that.

Ageless did remind me how out of shape I've become. Ugh. I need to get back into a routine like this to work my way back into some sort of shape that better than jellyfish and useless as I get older. Seeing Kathy buff at her age is encouraging. I wish she had slowed it down a little in the workouts, but then perhaps it's better for me that she didn't.",1366243200,3,1755,4.319148936170213
4698904,4,B005GYXNT0,"These are three good workouts. My wife, a fitness buff if there ever was one, went through these and commented.

Looking at the package, you might think you can jump right in. Well, if you're older and haven't exercised much, you need to (a) check with your doctor and (b) start with something easier, less intense, and more ""instructive."" Using these workouts, especially the first (""Total Circuit"") will not be so easy if you have no familiarity with exercise routines and practices.

The exercises mix weight training, aerobics, and yoga and yoga-like stretching. A mat is needed for the third workout. The exercise intensity is at the ""intermediate"" level. If you're a beginner and bought this video already, perhaps you can make it work by doing only parts of each video; they're pretty nicely segmented into exercise types. In any case, beginners won't want the whole 20 minutes (I am speaking from experience here).

Ms. Smith is a good instructor although as mentioned she assumes basic knowledge. She is definitely a good exercise routine designer; the three workouts here obviously were well thought-out in terms of goals and balance.

So, my bottom line is four stars, one star off because beginners can easily buy this by mistake. Beginners: start with something easier. Intermediates: this is for you. Advanced: use it on lighter days or as a refresher.",1365638400,,1366,5.004405286343612

This video suffers in comparison, probably because Kathy Smith is the only person you see performing the exercises.  She obviously is in superb shape and probably does not represent a lot of this demographic.  As another reviewer, noted she is very bouncy in the circuit training; she even uses 16 lb of weights at one point.  I am concerned that someone in the ""ageless"" bracket who is trying to keep up with her could overextend without realizing it .  Having multiple people in a video performing modifications of movements (again, such as the Menopause video) is more realistic.

Let's just say as you (I) grow older, the way you (I) exercise needs to change - not because of laziness or tiredness (although you (I) could argue those points at certain times) but because of the natural aging process, regardless of one's past exercise habits. The objective of this program by fitness veteran Kathy Smith is emphasis on movement, balance, and toning - good for people of all ages, regardless of any other fitness activity a person may (or may not) be doing.

Three workouts are included, each around 20 minutes, with segments on balance and toning of legs, arms, and butt, along with some core exercises. The only equipment necessary is a set of weights and maybe a mat if you don't have a carpet.

I like Kathy's enthusiasm for fitness and her personality which I find more nurturing than drill sergeant-esque (a popular M.O. for fitness instructors these days). Also, she provides exercise modifications based upon fitness levels. You can work up to more difficult exercises over time without feeling like you have to give up on the first go around.

I can recommend any instructional video by Kathy Smith. She's a trusted fitness professional who's been around for a lot of years. And she looks fantastic too!",1353283200,6,1354,4.852813852813853

I read a few reviews that said it is good for beginners, but I don't think they meant true beginners like us. We did the DVD a few times, but even with the modified moves it was a little too much for my mom and was too hard on her knees. I found it too fast for both of us too right now, I think we need to start out with something for real beginners first and work our way up to this DVD. I can appreciate the three segments of the work out and see how it could be beneficial down the road, but we need some time to get to the point of gaining benefit from this workout.",1348444800,3,827,3.6779661016949152
4698914,3,B005GYXNT0,"""Ageless With Kathy Smith:  Total Body Turnaround"" is really an excellent collection of workouts for experienced excercisers looking for a quick workout to start off the day or for the older population (which this video is actually geared toward) who still want to workout, but can't move or last as long as they used to.

The DVD comes with three workouts, each one focusing on different aspects of an older person's health and exercise goals.  The Total Circuit workout runs just over twenty minutes and combines cardio and light weight training for an all around general workout.  The Total Balance workout focuses more on cardio and balance (obviously) work and is actually my favorite of the three workouts.  It's also the favorite of my parents, who say their balance has improved since doing this routine.  The third workout is called Total Energy and focuses not so much on wearing you out, but energizing the body through yoga and light aerobics.

As a four-time (and counting) Insanity alum, I found all three of these workout routines to be a bit light.  However, I'm not the target audience here, and I do believe that for folks over the age of forty who might not be as active as they would like to be, this is an excellent video to pick up.

My primary complaints with this DVD are that it is A) boring due to lackluster music and false entusiasm via Kathy Smith and B) poorly instructed.  For older generations or for folks who aren't used to working out, some of Smith's brief explanations of how to properly do each mover can be confusing or just inadequate.  In all honesty, Shaun T's instruction of moves in the Insanity program and Jillian Michael's explanation of moves in her DVDs is much better.

Also included are a couple of excercise routines from other DVDs in the series, and they are decent enough on their own.  I was especially fond of the yoga routine.",1348444800,2,1884,4.689969604863222

1. It's titled ""ageless"" which to me indicated older individuals would benefit. I'm over 60 and exercise regularly. Kathy's Baby Boomer workout and Cardio-fit workout are favorites; but, this one is VERY HARD ON KNEES!
2. The aerobics interspersed with weights is too truncated; you get neither a good aerobic or weight-training workout.

One positive were the balance exercises--but that was only one, short segment.

I don't like giving bad reviews, but for $14.99 I was very disappointed.",1346371200,21,575,5.2967032967032965

I've been able to get thru all three of the workouts without having to stop and have found that it's great for a quick one-off on nights when I can only do one of the 20-minute work-outs.

I personally like the balance workout best because it works and shapes the legs, but the circuit training is an excellent beginning workout to get the heart going.

None of the workout is too tough on the joints and it's really great if you're just starting out.

I highly suggest this for folks who have strange work schedules too, since again, the workout is split up so that you can do a short 20 minutes or the full hour if you want.",1346284800,4,780,4.321917808219178

4698920,4,B005GYXNT0,"I'm in my early 60's & have been ignoring physical fitness for a couple years now.  I found parts of this exercise DVD to be a tiny bit challenging, but doable. I was tired after completing the first two workouts, the Total Circuit & Total Balance. Kathy incorporates lunges, squats & hops into some of these routines. If you have knee problems or arthritis  in your feet, you might have difficulty with these movements.  She demonstrates easier, alternate moves for some of these exercises, but not all of them.

Kathy Smith's Total Body Turnaround will move every joint in your body.
The DVD centers on three separate 20 minute workouts each geared to a specific outcome.  It is easy to choose one or more workouts. I initially chose to do all three. The next time I will focus on the Total Circuit & Total Balance workouts.

~Total Circuit~ alternates between light weights & aerobics to focus on fitness, calorie burning & cardio. You'll tone & strengthen your legs, buttocks, arms, & core while trimming your waistline. There are lunges, squats & some hopping in this exercise routine that might prove difficult if you have knee problems. For some of the exercises, not all, Kathy demonstrates alternat moves if you find a particular movement too difficult.

~Total Balance~ focuses on strengthening muscle groups so we can maintain our balance as we age.  Balance exercises are often ignored in most exercise programs. I appreciate that they're included in this DVD. Kathy explains that as we age & begin losing our balance that our world becomes smaller. We might not want to go hiking because we might have trouble keeping our balance on the uneven ground. Even stopping a fall on a sidewalk becomes more difficult as our balance declines...according to Kathy, our balance begins declining at age 40. I thought I had good balance & was surprised when I had trouble with some of these exercises. Again, some of these exercises might prove difficult if you have knee problems.

~Total Energy~ focuses on stretching & yoga type exercises to help us de-stress &  maintain energy throughout the day.

I always feel better after I exercise & hope to incorporate the Total Body Turnaround into a daily fitness routine.

Because some of these exercises involve lunging, I suggest that you don't purchase this DVD if you have knee problems.

4698922,2,B005GYXNT0,"I think this workout would be good for beginners up through those just transitioning into the intermediate stage. The run down of segments goes like this:

""Total Circuit"" (this includes what seems like a warm up so it's a little longer than 20 minutes) includes exercises like
bent rows, shoulder presses, lunges, and traditional exercises geared towards the biceps and triceps. Then, there's a cardio portion. The section also has a cool down/stretch.

""Total Balance"" is focused on aerobic and balance work. There are a few ballet-based moves involved so if balance is an issue for you, make sure to have something stable within reach to hold on to. This section also has a cool down/stretch.

***Let me stop here and say that both of these sections include squats of different varieties. This is something to keep in mind if you have certain knee mobility issues or just plain don't like squats.

""Total Energy"" includes floor work and yoga-ish work. Again, there is a stretch.

The ""ageless"" in the title and the low intensity of the workout leads me to believe that this workout is really geared towards the more mature exerciser. However, those who are older but in better shape will likely also find this a little too light.",1340064000,28,1232,4.847619047619047

Her main complaint about this particular one was that Kathy seemed to be all over the place--one minute she's doing some weird stretch or difficult workout move of some sort but then says something indicating that 'that is probably too hard' and then she spends forever flapping her arms back and forth or doing some other sort of trivial work.  Note that my wife uses the term ""difficult"" loosely as she is in her last trimester of pregnancy.

If you are doing low intensity work outs and you are looking for variety, you could do worse than this video (esp. at this price), however, I can't say I proactively recommend it as there are lots of better options out there.",1339804800,,816,4.5

I could not figure out who would benefit from this workout. While it's not difficult, it's probably too much for true beginners or those out of shape. The pacing is awkward, and modifications aren't given until a sequence is practically over. Anyone above that is going to be bored as the routines are nothing new (knee lift repeaters, anyone?). While I normally like Kathy, in this workout she's very annoying--lots of whoops and screams. She seems almost crazily cheerful, in a very off putting way.",1338854400,3,772,4.718518518518518

Minimal stuff required; I'll never forget an older video of hers where she said to use canned goods instead of dumbbells should you not have any.

But, other than that, she is toned.  So, you have an expert here, not someone who jumps on the bandwagon.

And, that Kathy is over 60, indicates she will perform the workout in a safe manner for the more mature woman.  The best exercise on the Total Circuit is the balance workout.  It is critical for the mature exerciser to always incorporate this into their workout.  She does an extensive workout helping one keep that balance, especially as one ages.

The DVD is a compilation of three 30-minute workouts, that include cardio, energy, lightweights, balance and some aspects of Yoga.  The workouts are not difficult, and at 20 minutes, you can do just that much or extend for more.  Like most workouts, the music is annoying, but here it is light in the background.

Short and efficient workouts are my preference.  I like to add variety to my exercise regimen, so this seemed like a good one as it included three different segments.  However, I had a hard time feeling like I got a true workout using this video.  I also did not enjoy Kathy Smith as the instructor. She was hard for me to watch and feel motivated to work out hard.

The three different segments include:
Total Circuit which is supposed to be the cardio,
Total Balance which is aimed to be the strength portion, and

And like I said, I'm not the target audience.  My mother is, and both of us, after doing the 60 minute exercise agreed: it's pretty easy.

If you don't like the Jillian Micheals and wished Jane Fonda's former workouts were in DVDs, and you like low impact, then read on.
1) circuit. Very low impact applying the traditional form of weight work and you will need a chair for stabilization and one set of weights.  Each form just focuses on a set of muscles and does not apply multiple muscles to work out more efficiently.  I was not too impressed with the form and if you have never worked out before then this is not a great DVD to learn the proper form.  (there are better DVDs that show you much better form). I was a little concerned in this section as she was jumping around that she was close to the chair a lot: it was distracting.  Properly one star as the poor form was critical for people to avoid injuries.

2) balance.  Imagine tree pose with lots of kicks, or imagine jumping star where both feet do not leave the ground? A lot of arms waving and imagine john Travolta doing Saturday nights fever withe the Bee Gees?  Low impact, but the moves were quick and I recommend you watch it once as she moved onto the next moves too quickly.

3) energize. Hmm, more like yoga stretches and a lot of bottom wiggles.  She jumps around the moves too quickly and since there is not repetitions, you may miss many of the moves.  I can understand you have loosen your core for the energy to move up your spine, then the moves in this DVD will make sense.

I found it hard to like this DVD, since I was concerned with the poor form I the circuit section.  The energize section could be fun, but I would recommend kundalini yoga for better form.  There are too many better workout DVDs with better form and real exercise that I would say pass this one, unless you really worship Kathy Smith, or loved Jane Fonda and can't take the new hipper exercises.

I didn't love the exercises and I just didn't connect with the instructor.

On the positive this workout was a bit more difficult than I expected; not P90x difficult but more than I thought it would be since it's advertised to older women.

I'm in very good shape and consider myself advanced in my fitness routine. I do use some other workout videos just to change things up some times, but they are more boot camp-like in their routines. I prefer a uniform-like exercise like jumping jacks, crunches, push ups, etc. This is more like dancing type where you kind of follow the arm motions and leg motions as you wish. I think that this would be perfect for people who want lower impact type workouts. With that being said, you do get a total body workout with these. The workouts are short, so just about the point when you think you can't take anymore, you're done with it. You will need some weights to do these workouts. I already had some, so it wasn't a big deal for me, but if you don't have any, you need to get some. I used 3lb hand weights when I did it and they weren't bad at all. Overall, I would highly recommend this workout video for older people or beginners, but not for the more advanced people.",1337126400,3,1148,4.199095022624435
4698933,5,B005GYXNT0,"While I like to stay fit, I am not an elite athlete but certainly try to exercise as often as possible. Just for the heck of it, I also had a friend complete this workout with me a few times as one of us exercises far more than the other We both found it challenging without being too intense, although we agreed that beginners may need to build up to the full workout.

If you don't want to spend a small fortune on exercise equipment, you may be relieved to know that you can get by with some weights and a mat. However, if you are looking for an exercise routine that is low impact you may find that you have difficulty with some of the lunges and squats.

There are several options to choose. On a good day, I complete all three - the Total Circuit, Total Balance, and Total Energy sections. However, it is certainly not necessary to do all of them at once- or even in the same day. The Total Circuit section is my favorite as it includes a combination of cardio and weight exercises that I particularly like. Hops, lunges, and more keep the heart rate up.

Then there are plenty of bicep curls and overhead presses to tighten the muscles and tone the upper body. I actually had sore muscles the first few times I completed this section. That went away fairly quickly and I did notice an improvement in my muscle tone - a definite motivation to keep using this DVD! If you are a beginner, expect this section to be challenging. But hang in there and you're likely to find it rewarding - in time.

My foot was severely injured when I was younger. It has improved significantly since then but I was worried about the Total Balance section. Happily, I could manage to keep from falling or losing my balance even when I was instructed to perform exercises which included balancing with one knee up. Stretches were also included, first done on one side and then the other.

The easiest section for me was the one focusing on Total Energy. I was a bit baffled about why this would be called Total Energy as it seemed to be more about stretching than energy. I have to admit that even though I found this part of the DVD the least challenging my flexibility has increased and early morning joint pain is completely gone so ""easy"" does not mean ineffective.",1337126400,5,2253,4.393285371702638
4698934,4,B005GYXNT0,"""Total Body Turn Around"" with Kathy Smith features three different 20 minute workouts that target a physical change people face as they grow older

Total Circuit:

You need a mat, chair, and hand weights for this exercise which features interval training.  Smith incorporates a lot of aerobic work in this one - march in place; heel digs; side steps (eventually adding jumps); knee lifts; squats; and push ups.  The exercises using hand weights include putting one hand on a chair while lifting weights with the other hand; bicep curls; shoulder press; one leg dead lift; triceps extensions; and more.  This was a very difficult workout for me to do - I'd say it was for advanced exercisers.  Also, I didn't quite have enough room for all the equipment I needed.  It's an intense workout - a bit too intense for me.

Total Balance:

This exercise segment starts energetically right away with sidesteps and lots of arm movements.  Smith is in bare feet and I prefer doing this segment the same way.  The balancing part starts very quickly - Smith does a good job of smoothly incorporating the balancing with the aerobics.  Among the many moves she does are squats; grapevine; lifting the leg after sidesteps; plie squats; knee lifts; double squats; and some yoga positions.  While I did occasionally have some problems balancing (I exercise in my bedroom so I grabbed onto my bed for balance) I found this to be a very effective routine.  Of the three segments on this DVD Total Balance is the one I'll do the most.  My one complaint is that Smith is a little too enthusiastic and needs to tone down her ""whooping"".

Total Energy:

This exercise routine is done barefoot using a mat.  It is the slowest paced of the three.  There is a lot of emphasis on breathing and stretching.  Smith uses a lot of yoga poses in this one: chair pose; rag doll pose; child's pose etc. There are also some toning poses like rib circles; leg circles; rollup and down like a ball.  It is a nice leisurely workout that focuses on every part of your body by the time it is over.  It wasn't my favorite routine in this DVD - it is a bit too slow and I didn't feel like I had even exercised by the time it was done.  Still, I do like the concept of shooting energy through my hands - I've taken to doing that move during a long tiring workday.

Bottom-line:

""Total Body Turn Around"" offers a bit of something for everyone.  Kathy Smith has a lot of energy for her age (she really does need to tone down the whooping).  She offers lots of modifications for each move which is good for those of us who aren't as flexible or as athletic as she is. In the end I prefer Leslie Sansone's DVDs and I'll probably only pop this one in whenever I need to work on my balance.",1337040000,,2742,4.464788732394366
4698935,5,B005GYXNT0,Ageless with Kathy Smith Total body turn around is an excellent work out especially for beginners. It is broken into three seperate work outs. I am 57 and overweight and I could do it and keep up with it. I also bike 30 mins a day so I am sure that helped. It is enjoyable especialy for those days when you want to mix it up a little. I thought it was fun and I would recomend it.,1336953600,2,380,3.8846153846153846
4698936,4,B005GYXNT0,"I have not been very motivated to workout. I needed something that was going to be quick and be able to work out my entire body. It is not very difficult and you can choose from three different twenty-minute workouts. It is geared towards those over 40, but anyone can use the video.",1336608000,,283,4.3584905660377355
4698937,4,B005GYXNT0,"A great set of three workouts that are suitable for younger or older crowd, but not too difficult for those over thirty. In my opinion, even people in their eighties or over who are in fair physical shape would be able to keep up with all three workout routines. I like to fit one short one in each day and save all three at once for days that are not as hectic and I'm not so pressed for time. The workouts are not 'super easy', you will feel a little sore at first, but you will also feel and see results which is what it's all about. I felt healthier and had more energy after the first week of doing the workouts three days a week. As always, the viewer is warned to check with their doctor first to make sure they are healthy enough to start a workout program and don't have any hidden health issues. I like Kathy Smith because she works hard to see that her routines not only get results, but are 'safe'. Some workout videos can injure someone. I suggest watching the entire video through so you can see how the movements are done properly, and then try them yourself. This method always works easiest for me when I'm starting a new workout routine.",1336608000,,1155,4.2785388127853885
4698938,2,B005GYXNT0,"This workout is directed at persons 40 or over. It features three twenty minute workouts addresing cardio and calorie burning, balance and energy respectively.  There is a bonus section which has a trite interview with Smith and brief excerpts from Core Fusion Lean and Toned and Yoga for beginnners.  Sadly the exceerpts were better than the featured workouts.

All three routines are filmed in what appears to be the living room of a loft.  The light from the curtained window is annoying and the decor, which consists of ugly furniture and pretty glass vases, leaves alot to be desired.  Smith wears a most unattractive and ill fitting outfit.  It did not flatter her and frankly was a distraction.  The music was horrid, some type of generic industrial pop.  It was not interesting or fun and did nothing to enhance the routines.

Although the routines were not especially difficult, I do not think they are appropriate for the target audience.  She goes very fast.  The first routine involves aerobics and light weight work. There is alot of jumping and bouncing around and it is dance without grace.  The balance section is just idiotic with more of the same bouncing and jumping and parading around and then holding positions.  She mentions using a chair for balance in the middle of the routine when it should have been mentioned at the beginning.  The Energy routine is a quasi yoga/stretch routine which is not appropriate for anyone with back or joint issues.  I did not feel energized  after completing it.

I don't know anyone who would enjoy this dvd. If you are already fit you would go for Zumba or the PX90  systems.  If you are returning to exercise, the necessary precautions and modifications are missing and frankly, it is just not fun. Smith, an otherwise pretty woman, looks unattractive and old in this dvd and her fuax cheery yelps are annoying not motivating. There are so many excellent systems out there, I would not waste the time or money on this one.",1336608000,8,1981,4.790560471976401
4698939,5,B005GYXNT0,"Kathy and I have been working out together since she published her first video.  I think that was in the 80's.  This workout is strenuous and fun.  Fast paced and a real challenge.  I love Kathy's upbeat attitude, she inspires me to try harder each day and my figure at almost 70 is excellent, how many women can say that?  Thanks Kathy, keep up the good work!",1336003200,,360,4.313432835820896
4698940,4,B005GYXNT0,This video has three workouts on it. Each are good and get your blood flowing. The first one uses dumbbells for some of the workout. The other two have you going as well. They are fast paced but easy to follow. I like them because my heart starts going fast and I feel good after wards. I recommend it to anyone that wants help getting the exercise they need.,1335744000,,359,4.217391304347826
4698941,2,B005GYXNT0,"The 3 separate 20 minute routines are okay, but the last one, energize felt like a waste of time and was boring.  If you are a true beginner you will have no problem with this dvd.",1334275200,2,180,4.0

8472509,4,B005GYXNT0,Decent workout. I actually think it couldve been more intense. Some of the moves couldve used more repetition to make it more challenging. Over all it was a good workout though.,1525996800,,177,4.741935483870968
8472510,5,B005GYXNT0,"Kinda weird for me. Yogaish, shoot your energyish. Not what I'm used to in a workout. Lot's of girating your hips and pelvis & parts that aren't supposed to girate. She is definitely entertaining in this one. I have been doing her workouts for approx 20 years.

Update....still kinda weird but it grew on me. After doing it a few times I really enjoy it. It's pretty fun and low impact. It's a good workout!",1525219200,,407,4.426666666666667

8472514,5,B005GYXNT0,"Thank you Kathy for another great workout. I have purchased many of her workouts since the 1980's. I like these three workouts as additions to my current routine. The refresh and recharge workout is exactly as advertised. 20 minutes in my slump part of the day (around 4PM) works better than coffee or an energy bar to get me raved up and going. I will use this one frequently. The balance workout is important for everyone as a way to keep muscles trained and prevent falling. Then, the toning workout is a good twenty minutes to get the body pumping and can be done in addition to a run or bike ride. I love Kathy's attitude and laughter and beauty. She is amazing.",1510876800,2,667,4.430894308943089
