3801605,4,B001UJENPS,This is one of the best video tours I have seen in quite a while. My only minor issue is the majority of the footage is in Alaska and not Hawaii.,1343952000,2,145,3.7096774193548385
3801606,5,B001UJENPS,"Great high-def video of two of the perhaps most beautiful and certainly most remote national parks.  If you're thinking of visiting either Alaska or Hawaii and need a visual nudge (or if you wish to visit and can't afford to after buying your new video setup), order this Blu Ray and park yourself in front of that big HD TV for 50 glorious minutes of each.

Sure, the narration is calm and informative instead of a non-stop thrill ride; but the visuals are still stunning.  (If you want an action movie, order one of the 'Resident Evil' series; don't get a video about National Parks.  If you don't care about seeing nature trails and a little wildlife in & around amazingly beautiful places, then why are you looking at something called ""Scenic National Parks"" in the first place? :-)

I can't visit either Alaska or Hawaii in the near future, but i CAN spend $15 on a Blu Ray for some of what i'm missing.  I like all of the David Attenborough series and many of the nature Imax movies, but i enjoyed this diversion into these two National Park locations.  For me, this is a must-have.",1306108800,11,1088,4.49238578680203

3801784,5,B001UJENPS,"Of the National Park series, the only better one is Ken Burn's. Great photography, good commentary, and spectacular vistas make this worthwhile without the large dose of history.",1401494400,,178,5.392857142857143
3801785,3,B001UJENPS,"Very nicely produced series, a great deal of very beautiful scenery but there are times it seems like it's a advertisement for the national park service..",1401408000,,154,4.961538461538462
3801796,5,B001UJENPS,The views of the parks were so well selected and just the right amount to let me know what a treasure these parks are.,1401408000,,118,3.9583333333333335
3801797,3,B001UJENPS,"If you are interested in the National Parks, this is a nice tour. Having been to several parks myself, I must say they simply CAN'T show the true grandeur, (even in HD) If possible, you really should go to see them in person.",1401321600,,225,4.255813953488372
3801798,5,B001UJENPS,Very informative and gorgeous scenery!!!  Would love to visit some of the places that I have not yet seen.  We really enjoyed this.,1401321600,,131,4.6521739130434785
3801799,4,B001UJENPS,"If you are looking for a travelogue this is not the program for you. THere is plenty of information about the area, however this program goes deeper into the uniqueness of the park. You will see areas you didn't even realize existed. You will learn of opportunities to explore that a simple stop in to see Old Faithful erupt would never have come to mind.

Anyone who plans to make the trip should watch this program first. It will help you realize all that can be seen and done while in the park and make planning the adventure so much better. Enjoy!",1401321600,,551,4.401960784313726
3801800,5,B001UJENPS,"Very well documented and with details to each section. I would love to watch it again.
Worth to be there and see it for yourself.",1401148800,,129,4.2
3801801,5,B001UJENPS,"Nicely done with quality photography, facts and pride. A tribute to a great country and the forethought to preserve it's  natural wonders for future generations to enjoy and learn from. Thank you for a national treasure.",1401148800,,220,5.111111111111111
3801802,5,B001UJENPS,"Every American should be required to watch this in Grammar School. It shows how beautiful and blessed we are to

live here. Janice Carter",1401062400,,137,4.708333333333333
3801803,5,B001UJENPS,really liked the documentary.  You felt like you were actually there on a vacation!  Will probably watch the entire series.,1400976000,,123,5.1
3801804,4,B001UJENPS,I have a trip planned to Montana and I am interested in spending some time at Yellowstone.  This was great to watch to see what the park has to offer.,1400630400,,150,4.0
3801805,5,B001UJENPS,"So many national parks and so little time, it is nearly impossible to take them all in. And if you are planning to visit a national park, it would be wise to check out the video for that park so even the smallest detail will not go un-noticed.  And for the older folks visiting the national parks from your own recliner is a pretty good idea as well.",1400630400,,350,4.147058823529412
3801806,5,B001UJENPS,"I felt like i was right there
nice job on the narration and the filming

3801808,4,B001UJENPS,"I've only watched 1 segment so far, but it was enjoyable. Would prefer seeing the parks in person, but this is a fair alternative.",1400198400,,130,4.458333333333333
3801809,5,B001UJENPS,I really like this series on the National Parks.  It makes me want to visit!  The photography is really good and there is good information on the parks as well.,1400112000,,160,4.3
3801810,3,B001UJENPS,This is a good way to learn a bit about Yellowstone National Park. We plan to visit soon and wanted to be informed before heading out to find the best stops and plan the trip for full fun and learning.,1400025600,,201,4.05
3801811,5,B001UJENPS,"It's awe inspiring. With gorgeous views snd great background stories, what more can I say? They were made into national parks for a reason.",1399852800,,139,4.833333333333333

3801815,3,B001UJENPS,Very interesting but not for young kids. Beautiful scenery and great info about our parks. May help you plan a trip or decide where you want to visit.,1399507200,,150,4.392857142857143
3801826,5,B001UJENPS,"This program, along with being highly educational, was very entertaining and inciteful.  This is the next best thing to being there.",1399161600,,132,5.285714285714286
3801827,5,B001UJENPS,"Loved this program.  The history and information is astounding, but the beauty is amazing.  I first used it to try and sleep, but found I didn't want to stop watching!",1399161600,,167,4.533333333333333
3801828,5,B001UJENPS,My 9 year old son and I really enjoyed watching this program. It was actually his idea to show me what the different national parks were like.,1399161600,,142,4.296296296296297
3801829,4,B001UJENPS,"love our National Parks, would love to travel and see them all, but can't do that so seeing them on NG parks is fun, not the same as being there but we can see what they are all about:)",1399075200,,185,3.769230769230769
3801830,1,B001UJENPS,I put this movie on to see all the beautiful scenery and all I got was a chance to see more people talking about nothing. If I had wanted to hear people talking about nothing I could have tuned to most sitcoms that come on these days.,1398902400,,234,4.0
3801831,5,B001UJENPS,We liked it! It was very enjoyable. The photography was wonderful. A very professional job. We will be watching more like it.,1398816000,,125,4.7272727272727275
3801832,4,B001UJENPS,I found this to be an enjoyable and informative video covering much more than I expected.  Would definitely recommend to a friend.,1398729600,,130,4.909090909090909
3801833,5,B001UJENPS,More in depth about specific parks than most other videos. Scenery is beautiful in HD. Highly recommended for the entire family!,1398470400,,128,5.142857142857143
3801834,3,B001UJENPS,"Kinda boring commentary. Jumped around a lot. But good info on the parks and there was some good footage. We were trying to find places to visit. So for that aspect there was enough to see, but I don't think I could watch very many.",1398297600,,232,4.177777777777778
3801835,3,B001UJENPS,"It looks like some of the footage is very poor standard definition quality (like bad cell phone video quality) spliced into other footage that is HD. Some of the worst video quality I have seen on Amazon. However, the content is great and it represents the parks really well. Lots of interesting information.",1398211200,,308,4.830188679245283
3801846,4,B001UJENPS,"this is a well done series in HD, and a good bit of 'background' information was added to make the individual parks more appealing and personal. i especially liked the episode on Yosemite and the mariposa sequoias--what magnificent trees and before watching this, i didn't know very much about them. if you are thinking of a vacation to any of these parks, you should watch that episode to get a clearer idea of EXACTLY where you want to visit or stay when you get there. there are several recommendations about 'food' and lodging as well. this is a MUST see series, as the photography is spectacular and some of it is done as 'flyovers' which is even better.",1391990400,,659,4.593220338983051
3801847,4,B001UJENPS,"i love the views and history.
video quality was good decent too for non HD
but some of the narration was a tad boring.",1390176000,,118,3.9583333333333335
3801848,5,B001UJENPS,It was very good. Well narrated and very beautiful to watch. The history behind the parks is amazing to learn.,1389139200,,110,4.55
3801849,5,B001UJENPS,"I am just amazed with documentary and it is so nice to see the inside information about the parks from the people who work there, travel and people who live around. I still have lot of episode to finish..",1376438400,,204,4.256410256410256
3801850,5,B001UJENPS,perfect video for national parks introductions in HD quality. Free to watch if you have amazon prime membership. Don't miss it if you are a NP lover.,1376179200,,149,4.555555555555555
3801851,4,B001UJENPS,"I was fortunate enough to visit all of these national parks as a child and teenager.  Once my children are grown, I will be sure to take them as well, but this series is a good HD substitute.  The views are stunning with vibrant colors and sweeping vistas.  After watching the series, it makes me impatient waiting for when I get to go back.",1375142400,,341,4.296875
3801852,2,B001UJENPS,"This movie, together with ""yellow stone"", ""American eagle"", is pre-mastered at lowest quality. This is the worst picture quality among all the blu-ray movies I have seen. I bought all three movies for video quality testing, but this quality just didn't work for me. QUESTART obviously does not know how to produce high quality blu-ray movies. This scenic contents appear to be blurry, grainy, and it does not appear to have native 1080p resolution. I give it two stars for the contents itself, but overall for the quality, video is not properly encoded ... low bit rate, wrong frame rate, it is all messed up. I only paid $7 but still feel money wasted.",1355875200,5,653,4.7368421052631575
3801853,5,B001UJENPS,The blu-ray versions certainly did meet my expectations of these two from the Scenic National Park series. The production quality is excellent as befitting their subjects of some of the greatest scenery in North America and the island of Hawaii. A great way to show off your HD and 5.1 surround. I have seen these numerous times on HD channels such as the now defunct HD Theater but are still shown on other similar channels like TRAVEL and AMERICA but only in 1080i not the full 1080p of blu-ray. Another excellent pairing in this series is Grand Canyon and National Parks of the Great Southwest. The Grand Canyon video is mesmerizing and gorgeous in 1080p as well as the other which tours various National Parks in our nations great Southwest. I heartily recommend all of these in this series in the blu-ray format from Questar. Especially at these prices.,1352851200,,858,4.76510067114094
3801854,5,B001UJENPS,What do Alaska and Hawai'i have in common? The Humpback Whales. They travel every year from Alaska to Hawai'i. I liked the idea to combine these two locations onto one DVD. And the material on the DVDs is simply awesome! A good reason to buy a beamer. The largest TVs are not enough. The material for the DVD has been carefully selected and the comments whre informative and provided extra knowledge. Great cameramen! Great buy! And maybe a motivation to collect 'days off' and do both in one trip!,1351036800,2,498,4.606741573033708
8343926,5,B001UJENPS,Have enjoyed so much  been to a lot of this place but learned more about them can't wait to go back and see new things,1486339200,,118,3.72
8343927,5,B001UJENPS,"Very beautiful scenic pictures and the narrator provides great information.  You will learn about the parks greatest attractions as well as safety measures if you were to drive to these parks yourself.  Of course, you will learn the history of each park and when they were founded.  If your interested in visiting a national park anywhere in this country, please view these episodes.  They do a great job covering them all.",1485820800,,423,4.915492957746479

8343929,2,B001UJENPS,"The video resolution and colors were pretty poor. That indicates to me that it was made with rather old technology, or was very poorly made by whomever filmed it. Hate to say it, have an Android phone and an iPhone, and both could take better video than that. I love the subject matter. But you need to step up your game on video quality, or find the source for the same subject matter from people who did higher-quality video. Oh, and please do not suggest that it could be my video viewing equipment. The TV is less than a year old, 50"", 4K and hi-def. Does extremely well with color and quality on other channels, and other features from your own channel. Thanks for listening.",1484956800,,680,4.448
