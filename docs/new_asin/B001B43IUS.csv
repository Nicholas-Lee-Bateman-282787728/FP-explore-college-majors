3483895,1,B001B43IUS,I could not view the DVD's I bought from Amazon because they were not compatible with region 4. I now believe that Acorn Media DVD's are not able to be viewed in region 4 but when you read the web site there is no mention of this. So I have wasted my money.,1233705600,5,257,3.8679245283018866
3483896,5,B001B43IUS,"We had previouly seen Martin Shaw in the  ""Daglish"" series as one of the actors for the Commander.  Very stoic and a bit unfriendly, but on the track when others didn't see it.  In this series he is just as irritating but just as inciteful as ever.  He has set out to retire in a small village, but remains.  His Sargent is the local copper trying to get out and up in the force from the backwater.  As Gently is by the old book, the sargent if a bit of however you can is alright -- ends justify the means.  His unorthodox means help solve their cases, all the while Gently is caring for him and guiding him.  And probably saving him! They are delightful foiles for each other.  If you like ""Daglish"" and other British mysteries like ""Lindley"", Morse, Frost, etc., where there is great interplay between the inspector and the argent, you will like these.",1232323200,64,855,4.3949044585987265
3483897,5,B001B43IUS,I ordered this series because Martin Shaw was portraying the main character>  I thought he was outstanding as Adam Dagleish and I have found that he is equally superb in this series.  Would like to see more of his work formatted for American TV.,1231632000,17,245,4.545454545454546
3483898,3,B001B43IUS,Martin Shaw is sensitive but can be brutal. The detective sergent plays a well rounded complex character. It is a good atmosphere series.,1229385600,12,137,5.0
3483899,5,B001B43IUS,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable drama with a great cast. I especially liked Martin Shaw (who has aged very well) who plays the title role of George Gently, and ""Robin Hood"" star Richard Armitage as the charismatic and ambiguous biker Ricky Deeming. Also of note is Lee Ingleby as Gently's young (and brash) partner.

The dramatization apparently takes a few liberties with the original novel (I daresay might be a little more politically correct) but holds its own and is full of twists and turns. It holds the period flavor (early '60s) well. Worth a look, especially if you're a fan of any of the lead stars.",1224028800,38,610,4.700934579439252

3483914,5,B001B43IUS,"The ""George Gently"" series is based on mystery novels written by the prolific author Alan Hunter, who wrote approximately a book a year in the series from 1955 to 1999. As I have not read the books, I don't know how closely the television series resembles its source, but the three episodes that constitute the pilot and Series 1 are based on the novels ""Gently Go Man"", ""Gently Where the Roads Go"", and ""Bomber's Moon"". The filmmakers have placed all three in 1964. This series never aired on PBS in the United States, so discovering it has been a real treat. Beyond Martin Shaw's charismatic turn as the steadfast and moral DCI George Gently, the series has the courage to make his morally compromised sidekick DS John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby) not especially likeable, and to avoid the anachronisms that plague so many period mysteries made in recent years. It takes place in Northhumberland, where a depressed rural economy and changing social mores, including what is expected of police officers, produce a tumultuous undercurrent.

Every episode is in some way a sign of its time, as is DCI Gently's crusade against the old-school corruption that allowed his wife's killer to operate with impunity. In ""Gently Go Man"" we see an execution that might have taken place just before capital punishment for murder was outlawed in the UK. The changing sexual mores and social frustrations of working class women are on display in the unforgettable character of Wanda Lane in ""The Burning Man."" We are reminded of how fresh memories and the damage of the War were in the minds of the generation that fought it in ""Bomber's Moon."" DCI Gently's criticism of DS Bacchus' methods eventually yields to a mentorship and mutual respect, amidst frequent worry, as the younger officer tries to impress his upstanding boss. The characters all seem plausible while still being interesting, which is more than I can say for any recent television show. The production design never tries to pretty anything up. And the musical score is a nice touch; it resembles the scores of 1960s television.

The DVDs (Acorn Media 2008): Discs offer optional English SDH subtitles and scene menus. Disc 1 includes text interviews with Martin Shaw, Lee Ingleby, and writer/executive producer Peter Flannery, as well as a short text biography of Martin Shaw.

The episodes are:

In ""Gently Go Man,"" DCI George Gently announces his retirement from the police force while attending the funeral of his wife Isabella, who was killed by a hit-and-run driver. Gently suspects the gangster Joe Webster (Phil Davis) ordered the hit on his wife. When he learns that Webster attended the funeral of a young biker in Hexham, Northhumberland, he heads north and assumes control of the investigation into Billy Lister's (Christian Cooke) death. Larry Elton (Shaun Evans), with whom Billy fought the night he died, has been arrested for murder on little evidence. Gently begins the investigation afresh, to the bewilderment of his new subordinate DS John Bacchus, son-in-law of the Chief Constable who embodies the privilege and corruption of old school policing. Gently looks into Billy's past and his relationship with the counterculture leader of the biker gang, Ricky Deeming (Richard Armitage).

DCI Gently's fishing expedition is interrupted in ""The Burning Man"", when the charred body of man killed by a single bullet to the head is found in a field. The only clue to the victim's identity is a gold ring engraved from ""Wanda"" in his stomach. DS Bacchus believes it refers to Wanda Lane (Pooky Quesnel), proprietress of a local diner. Gently is discomfited by the appearance of Cmdr. Epmton (Robert Glenister) of Special Branch on his turf with no introduction or explanation. He asks Bacchus to follow Empton, but Bacchus is easily taken in by the older, wily officer. Meanwhile, Lane admits that the lover to whom she gave the ring was an Irishman named Ruairi O'Connell (Finbar Lynch), and, when Carmel O'Shaughnessy (Charlotte Riley) reports her father (Deka Walmsley) missing, last seen on the RAF base where he worked, Gently begins to suspect political motives with ties to the local Irish Club and the IRA.

A fisherman fishes an eyeball out of the quayside in ""Bomber's Moon."" The body of German national Gunter Schmeikel (Wolf Kahler) is found in the water, drowned after his back was broken. Schmeikel owned a pharmaceutical company in Berlin. He and son Wilhelm (Christian Oliver) and daughter-in-law Trudi (Nathalie Boltt) were visiting a pig farm owned by Jim Hardyment (Tim Healy), where Gunter had been billeted as a POW during World War II. Gunter had been drinking at a bar with the Hardyment family the previous night, where there was an argument with a former professional wrestler named Chick Shavers (Paul Broughton), who expressed anti-German sentiment. Wilhelm, meanwhile, was observed walking alone toward the quay. Under investigation for embezzlement in Germany, he is suspect in the murder. But Gently is concerned to learn of DS Bacchus' financial troubles that might leave the officer susceptible to bribery.",1489190400,,5096,5.075178997613365

3484059,5,B001B43IUS,"I enjoy British drama. What can I say? It's a bit more subdued with less of the flash and melodrama of American TV. The characters are more complex and less prone to bombast and hyperbole. George Gently is a stoic soul with a penchant for honesty and integrity that seems to be dying in the real world. It's refreshing to watch a principled detective solve crimes that often get him into trouble and do so with the strength of conviction that only comes from a long career.

The setting and photography, the era in which it is set (1960s) all contribute to an ease of escapism that I find appealing. Maybe that's a great part of the appeal of British drama for me as well. The locations just aren't the usual suspects: New York, LA, Chicago, Miami. Like the other series I follow, Endeavor, George Gently is off the beaten path just enough to make it fresh and appealing.

May 15, 2015, Lee Ingleby (Sgt Bacchus) Tweeted that they are awaiting word from BBC 1 on whether there will be a Series 8 and rumors suggest there will be, which is good news, indeed.",1461024000,8,1057,4.443298969072165

3484061,4,B001B43IUS,"This police crime drama focuses on injustices of the 1960s while solving murder.

The show depicts the dichotomy of the era through a contrasts of the main characters. Inspector George Gently is a man near retirement. His approach is introspective and sensitive to societal needs. At the same time he works in the system, watching as his partner harass and beat information from suspects. John Baccus, on the other hand, is a young man working his way into the old system. He  is completely insensitive, self-centered, uneducated, and without options.

The partnership contrasts greatly with Inspector Lewis.  Both are fine detective shows, but the educated background of Lewis's partner is much more palatable than the bleak life of Baccus.",1458864000,4,741,5.201680672268908

3484099,3,B001B43IUS,"I watched this after seeing Series 2,3,4 and 5. It does provide background about Gently and illustrates how he and Bacchus met and began working together. The bleak Northumberland surroundings provide an excellent backdrop to the grim affairs transpiring there. The plot lines, however, seemed a bit loose and needed to be tightened.  Each episode had a certain raw, untamed quality about it that was vaguely unsatisfying -- a problem rectified in later series.  In some cases, the thickness of the Northumberland accent was indecipherable.  This detracts from the story and leaves one wondering if some valuable clues to the story have been missed.  However, Shaw and Ingleby are a pleasure to watch and it is interesting to witness the development of their relationship as events unfold.  This series is definitely worth watching; I just don't think it is the equal of the others.",1391126400,2,882,5.097222222222222

3484102,5,B001B43IUS,"I reviewed Series Two first, but both Series are praiseworthy.  With the glut of detective shows, it's hard to do anything really new in terms of story lines, so often the main draw in a new series is a compelling central character.  Martin Shaw as Gently, and his young, put-upon, not overly bright sidekick, Sgt. Bacchus more than fill the bill.  Their acting is marvelous, and each episode has just enough offbeat elements to make the whole program very satisfying.  Each of the minor characters is also extremely well played, and the early 60s' setting gives the series a distinct flavor not found in most other detective dramas.  This series was a good investment.",1388361600,,669,4.833333333333333
3484103,5,B001B43IUS,"George Gently manages to be different. On the surface, it is similar: set in the 1960s, with a younger, more foolish detective assisting him.

How is it different?

Brilliantly written, but not dwelling on witty one-liners, the characters are believable. Neither is perfect, but clearly, Inspector George Gently holds a higher moral and ethical standard than Detective Sergeant John Bacchus.

The cases themselves are ordinary enough -- usually murder with some interesting nuances. As it is set in the 1960s, the writers draw from the era for issues, police procedures and cultural milieu. While they aren't in the thick of protests and court cases, they are impacted from a distance just as anyone was then.

As is typical of British TV that makes it to the States, production values are high. Each episode is much like a movie, not rushing through plot points. The relationship between Gently and Bacchus develops show by show, never beyond the reality of each character. The viewer is always left satisfied by the show's end, waiting impatiently for the next one to be released.

I fully recommend George Gently.

The first episodes a corker, Gently's wife has been killed and he wants to oeavecLondon, he ends up in Northumberland working on a case that's close to home. Martin Shaw is GeorgebGently, and a better character is yet to be found. Lee Ingleby playsvthebrashnDS Bacchus, and, at times, everyone wants to slap his ears, but he learns. Gently is the best mentor the boy could have.

The next two episodes give us a good idea of how this series will work. Good, plodding detective work, along with the clues that are left for the two to find. It seems Northumberland is the place or good police work and for the best police department. The seres is hugely popular, and since 2002, several other series have been added. We will be up to Series six, soon. The two detectives work well together, and by the end of each episode, all s well.

3484117,5,B001B43IUS,"If you are a fan of British police procedurals, you should sample this series.  George Gently is a smart, intuitive detective who has an impulsive and flawed assistant, Bacchus.  A less patient man might fire Bacchus for occasional lapses of judgment, but Gently is gentle with his young assistant.  You sense he wants to train him to be a stellar detective.

They have some challenging and complex crimes to solve.  The first episode in this series, I had trouble following at times, but the acting is so good, and Gently is so fun to watch, it's worth persevering.  Once you get accustomed to the rhythm of the series and the character interactions and setting, it's easier to follow.

Gently and Bacchus rely on old-fashioned detecting techniques as it's the early 1960's - although the series feels contemporary in mood and tone - so there's not a lot of forensics dominating.  They interact a lot with the witnesses and suspects to find out their back stories and what dynamics came together to foster a crime.

3484120,5,B001B43IUS,"As I am deeply devoted fan of ""Morse"" , ""Inspector Lewis & Hathaway"", & ""Midsomer Murders"", & ""New Tricks""
I very much doubted if the ""Gently"" series would come close to the same caliber of those mentioned, I was so very wrong.  le I admit there is a difference, while Gently has been wounded and it is manifested in his behavior, he is not the brooding Morse and is sensitive to others while maintaining the courage of his convictions.  Like Inspector Lewis he lost his wife but his partner is no Hathaway and Gently is sometimes frustrated and sometimes discouraged at the attitude and seeming callousness of his partner, as he prods and teaches his young sidekick as he endeavors to instill ethics and honor. The ""Gently"" series has not the macabre or humor that ""Midsomer or New Tricks"" sometimes exhibit but the writing and acting are top notch and the storylines are totally believable.  As with so many of the programs that come from the British Isles, I feel as if I am watching real people and not actors.  They look like real people, the acting is so flawless that one forgets that they are actors, and the stories seem to have come right out of the headlines (the only unfortunate aspect).  Hat's off to George Gently and partner.....it is another GREAT series.

Martin Shaw plays a widowed Inspector who ""cut his teeth"" in London but has relocated (by desire) to the Northeast of England.  You don't get an insight to his character outside his workplace, but Martin Shaw is an excellent actor who shares enough facets of George Gently to keep even those people who don't like ""by the book"" procedurals quite entertained.  The actor who plays Detective Sgt Backus is also great, although we find out more about him and his private life in the shows.  The mysteries themselves are good, the characters are all awesome, the production level is movie quality and I just have to recommend them.

The cases are horrendous and require loads of ""nitty gritty"" foot work crime solving police work that is done wonderfully.  .

With his very mellow and beautiful speaking voice Martin Shaw as George Gently is splendid as  the commander and chief detective solving some nasty murders and other crimes that occur North of London while directing the far from ""politically correct"" John Bacchus that is brilliantly acted by Lee Ingleby--although he is, among other negative things, extremely homophobic, I adore him; he and George really make a good team at solving the crimes that are on this three (3) disc set running over an hour and a half per disc.

This first series shows the beginning, when Commander Gently's wife is killed right before his eyes. Even through his grief, the cop takes the high road in finding criminals and bringing them to justice. Very much like ""Midsomer Murders"" [recommended] without the multiple murdered victims, but with the multi-plots in police, private, and associates lives. Good writing, it makes the show.

Gently, played by Martin Shaw, is through, calm, and plays the mentor/father to his youthful assistant, Detective Sargent John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby). Their relationship is as important to the story/series as the crimes and investigations. Both are performance perfect. Bacchus bring some jollification to the show. Gently's grief, sometimes brings on tears. A highly emotional crime series. Setting is always 1964, Northumberland, England.

SUBTITLES ARE PROVIDED IN BOTH SERIES ONE AND TWO. I can vouch for them, I use them. Each episode is a feature-length mystery, suspenseful, fast moving, and packed with plot. Sad that the episodes available total only 7 when there were 46 DCI Gently books. Is there hope for more? Wise British TV did bring back ""Foyle's War"" [6-stars] for additional post-war episodes. Please, BBC, more Gently!

Episode details:
GENTLY GO MAN--based on novel with the same name, after Gently's wife is murdered, he asks for assignment to a crime in Northumberland because the man who killed his wife attended the victim's funeral. Gently wants a shot at him. Gently meets Sgt Bacchus working on the cycle death and they get teamed to find the killer. The relationship between Gently & Bacchus is as much a story plot as finding the killer. With Mrs. Gentley's killer in the neighborhood, the overlap of plots keeps the story moving fast. In the Gently Series tradition, also a bit gruesome--like facial parts removed by a blow-torch. Will the young Bacchus police-style work teamed with the Gently investigation methods? Time will tell.

THE BURNING MAN--based on novel 'Gently Where the Roads Go', a dead body, shot in the head, then burned beyond recognition, leaves one clue. A ring inside the stomach bearing an inscription--Wanda. The investigation leads to a local Irish pub, military guns, the IRA, and an agent of the Special Branch (cop). Bacchus gets caught in the middle--but middle of what? Bacchus and Gently work well together BUT Bacchus has lots to learn.

BOMBER'S MOON--based on book with same name, a fisherman hooks a human eyeball. Then the body is found in the water but with a pre-death broken back. He's ID-ed as a rich German. Plenty of suspects including his son, a farmer, and a pub heavy-weight. Meanwhile Gently is concerned about Sgt Bacchus' financial instability. Cops in financial trouble are susceptible to bribes. The murder investigation begins to unveil a trail of stories and events of the 1940s past war-time emotions of the area. Gentley gets to be a bit physical with suspects with his bully mean right. And then goes quite tender.

I watched Series 2 prior to Series 1. It makes no difference, each episode is a stand-alone 1 1/2 hour feature. The important thing is not to miss any of the episodes.

3484130,5,B001B43IUS,"After witnessing his wife's murder, Commander George Gently abruptly resigns his very senior position with the London Metropolitan Police Force. Now a DCI, we find him in the somewhat gritty port city of Durham, Northumberland. How he recieved the demotion and the change in venue is not clearly established, but the viewer understands why immediately. The DCI rank allows Gently to take a much more active part in any investigation, and perhaps more importantly, the man he suspects of his wife's murder is known to have a base of operations in Northumberland. Gently's partner DS Bacchus is much younger and light-years less experienced than Gently, and his youthful vigor admittedly clashes with Gently's more patient investigatory style. This creates a complex yet still enjoyable relationship between the two men.
The entire series is based in the mid 1960's, and to great effect. All involved have accomplished much in bringing the viewer to a very specific time and place. Although filmed in Ireland, the cars, hairstyles, fashions, and emerging 1960's attitudes bring us directly to Northumberland, England ca. 1964.
The entire series is beautifully realized. Every story is interesting and rings true regarding police procedure and being true to the period. Both lead actors are most impressive, particularly Martin Shaw as DCI Gently, who brings a quiet yet smoldering intensity to his role. Picture and sound quality are spot-on. I own the entire series, hoping for production to continue. George Gently certainly deserves a place next to other first-rate police procedurals such as Morse, Frost, Prime Suspect and the like.",1317168000,5,1635,5.316602316602316
3484131,4,B001B43IUS,"I watched these DVD's for the first time and even though my husband wasn't too thrilled about it, I found that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. There were some shooting scenes, and the shows dealt a lot with corruption in the police force itself but I guess that was to be expected for that period of time (the 1960's).  The plot summary basically explains it. The two main characters also made it pretty good. Here, I felt that Gently's partner was a lot like Barnaby's sidekicks -- brash and like to have control and Gently, even though he was still a bit rough, he still brought out his gentler side to make it work. I also have to admit that it was good in the sense of no major car chases and many gory scenes, and also no 'depressing home life scenes', but it still does not stand up to our tastes of what Midsomer Murders offers for the storyline. Still it was something new to watch.",1316822400,2,901,4.238372093023256
3484132,5,B001B43IUS,I have been looking at the George Gently series for a long time and finally decided to buy season one.  I have to say I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  Great concept and love the characters.  The scenery is wonderful.  I liked it so much I have now ordered series 2 and 3 and can't wait for them to get here.,1315872000,,324,3.9384615384615387
3484133,5,B001B43IUS,"In a crowded field of British detectives, public, private and amateur, George Gently has the character to fill a niche all his own. As played by Martin Shaw, his lack of idiosyncrasy is as memorable as is the barely controlled drinking and irascibility of Morse or the Wodehousian demeanor of Wimsey. The plots are appropriate to the time in which the show is set, the 1960's, and are, generally, still interesting today. Lee Ingleby, as Gently's chief assistant, does a fine job capturing ambition, gaucherie, shrewdness, respect, and apprenticeship, so as to make the 'side-kick' role a major component of each episode. The usual array of fine character actors people the cast and the goodly measure of the regional subcultures of the UK which they convey, spice the proceedings. At times violent, it does not substitute that quality for drama.
Over-all, a show which will please the devotee of Mystery, as well as  the general viewer looking for an interesting (nearly) two hours of watching.",1304726400,2,995,5.03030303030303
3484134,4,B001B43IUS,"British television seems to have been filled (and still is filled) with outstanding series.  The George Gently series contains some of the humor, the quirkiness, and the fine acting of many of these.  It is somewhat darker than some of the British police procedurals, but with more lasting interest and richer character development than some.  My wife and I still rank Midsomer Murders as the best (in that it's best matched to our tastes), but the portrayal of Gently in the episodes in series 1 has a depth that seems to go a bit beyond Cracker and The Last Detective (the Dangerous Davies series).  Compared with Gently, the Mrs. Bradley program, too, seem funny, entertaining, but thin.  The feeling of depth in this program is difficult to define, but it does make series 1 of George Gently a standout.  Still, there will always be a soft spot in our hearts for Dangerous and (especially) for Inspector Barnaby and his various assistants in Midsomer Murders that Gently just can't break through.  However, I'll take this over Murder in Suburbia and Waking the Dead. In all fairness, I should mention that we check the Gently, Murder in Suburbia, Last Detective, and Waking the Dead out of our local public library -- the only two that we've purchased are the complete run (to date) of Midsomer Murder and the complete and way-too-short run of Robbie Coltrane's Cracker.  If we were to start collecting DVDs of another British police program, George Gently might be the next.  In short:  fine acting, rich character development, and well-balanced plots.",1295481600,8,1557,4.908396946564886
3484135,5,B001B43IUS,"The history of George Gently is handled in the most admirable and succinct manner.  Often in dramas the tragedy of the protagonist's past is belabored to the point that it is sickening.  Martin Shaw infuses George Gently with a reality that is stunning. His second, John Bacchus is both flawed and funny, but totally believable. The actors make the characters believable and sympathetic.  The mysteries are involved and help develop the characters.  It is one of the best British mystery series I've ever had the pleasure to experience.  I'm happy to say that there subtitles also which are mostly not needed, but occasionally prove useful, especially with the local Northumberland folk.  George Gently is a reserved man, but not without humor.  The series takes place in the mid-sixties when the memories of the war were still fresh.  It was a different world and the attitudes and flavor of the time are realistic and engrossing.  I've both the first and second season and cannot wait for the third.  It is comparable with Foyle's War.",1293840000,,1037,4.942196531791907
3484136,5,B001B43IUS,Season Three is now showing on BBC - two of the new episodes have aired with the Series moving from 1964 to 1966. From everything I have read this season is as good if not better than the last two with some surprising twists which is only to be expected.  The whole series is excellent and well worth the purchase price.  Having lived in England throughout the 60s I can tell you the series captures the timeframe perfectly - a large number of people questioning the status quo and pushing and challenging the limits in oh so many ways with one man holding the line and trying to do the right thing day in and day out.  The old ways of life changing for the new ways - a society moving away from Aristocracy to Socialism in just about every facet of life.  By the end of the 60s the change from a true Aristocracy to a quasi Socialist country is almost complete thus finishing the social revolution that began around the end of WWI. This is a unique snapshot of how those changes impacted both metropolitan and rural police departments in Great Britain. George Gently fought the good fight and lost in London which would be played out in the press of the eighties with the Guilford 4 and the Birmigham 6 - a direct reflection of the corruption that is discussed in Season 1 and its final outcome where the Government had to come in and clean house in many major metro police departments including the Met.  Lets hope Gently does not lose the fight in Durham County and young Sargeant Bacchus realizes what the good fight should be before he loses his way completely.  I can not wait until Season Three is available.,1293667200,,1615,4.4391891891891895
3484137,5,B001B43IUS,"""Gently Go Man"", which takes place in 1964, is a very intense Gently episode in which George Gently, Alan Hunter's series detective of 47 books, has to endure the hit-and-run murder of his wife. After the tragedy a devastated Commander Gently, one of the top cops at Scotland Yard, decides that he has to retire, but a lead propels him into what he thinks will be his last case.
He knows that the criminal boss, his nemesis, Joe Webster, is responsible for his wife's killing, and the lead involves Webster in a Northumbria murder so he goes there to look into the case. Some of the top brass working with Gently in London are corrupt, on Webster's payroll.
Excellently portrayed by actor, Martin Shaw, Gently meets up with a loudmouth, rather dicey detective, Sergeant Bacchus (played by Lee Ingleby), and the two men are as different as chalk and cheese. Gently is a principled, straight as an arrow policeman, and the ambitious Bacchus is very willing to cut corners and bend the law. Gently finds the local inspector, Setters, to be none too cooperative.
Gently in the north of England investigates the murder of a member of a motorcycle gang involved in drugs, specifically speed. Billy Lister, a young member of the gang had his motorcycle forced off the road by another gang member. Billy was gay, and his sexual orientation may have been part of the motive for the crime. Joe Webster had turned up at Billy's funeral.
In London Gently had a snitch or grass named China, so he sends him north to ferret out some information, but the informer gets beaten up and has to get out of town.
 A second body of a gang member is found on a beach. The story gets more complex when Gently interviews Billy's mother.
This episode presupposes that viewers have some knowledge of the Gentry mystery books, that they know of his various run-ins with master criminal Joe Webster and Gently's use of the snitch China.
This is an excellent episode. The exterior shots and the views of the idyllic English countryside add to the charm of the TV series. We expect conflict in a TV drama or movie, and here we see it in Gently versus Bacchus. It's a battle of wits and a war between differing moral compasses. Gently refuses to break the law to catch the criminal, and Bacchus is only to willing for his own advantage to bend the law to get results. Even to avenge his wife, eye for an eye, Gently says to Bacchus, as policemen, ""There's meant to be a difference between us and them.""",1281744000,2,2470,4.588235294117647
3484148,5,B001B43IUS,"In the mid-sixties in ""Bomber's Moon"" a wealthy German, Gunter, arrives in a Northeastern English coastal town on his yacht. He had served his time as a P.O.W. during World War II in the town where many of the people know him and seem to like him. The man is very generous and buys rounds of drinks in the local pub. Someone apparently didn't like him because his murdered body turns up in the harbor. Was he really as well-liked, or did he have enemies?
Alan Hunter originated Inspector George Gently and continued his cases in more than forty books beginning in 1955. Now he's on television. In George Gently, Series One, Police Commander Gently investigates the murdered German case with his loudmouthed, opportunist, dodgy Sergeant Bacchus. Gently has to watch out for some of Bacchus's schemes because they seem to skirt the law. Actor Martin Shaw does a great job of portraying Gently, and Lee Ingleby does a fine job playing the difficult-to-like sergeant.
The television series follows the procedural pattern with Gently interrogating a number of suspects and people of interest about Gunter's killing. The number of suspects and people who had both motive and opportunity grows as Gently delves further into the case. Of course there are the usual red herrings swimming around to confuse the viewer.
""Bomber's Moon"" is suspenseful, and well-crafted. Flashbacks are used to present events from the past. The subsidiary roles are played by excellent actors. It's an interesting story recalling memories of wartime England. The characters are well-delineated, and their emotional life seems natural and believable.
There are two George Gently DVD's with three full-length episodes on each one. Hunter's books are out-of-print in the States, but reprints of three of his books are coming out in Great Britain next month.",1281312000,,1825,5.107023411371237
3484149,5,B001B43IUS,"Alan Hunter (1922-2005) is one of my favorite British mystery writers so I look forward to the television renderings of his Inspector George Gently series. ""The Burning Man"" is an adaptation of his novel ""Gently Where the Roads Go"" (published in 1962). He wrote 47 books in the Gently series from 1955 to 1999.
It's Northumberland, England, in the mid 1960's. A man is murdered, and the body is burned, leaving nothing but the skeletal remains. An inscribed ring found in the remains leads Gently to Wanda, the sexpot owner of a caf. It's the beginning of a series of identity mix-ups that involves gun-running for the Irish Republican Army. An RAF service member is involved in weapons disappearing. People disappear, and we are kept guessing about the identity of the burned remains.
Gently (effectively portrayed by actor Martin Shaw) works with his opportunistic and argumentative Sergeant Bacchus, and the two are constantly sparring. A special branch commander, Empton, is also battling with Gently. The secret branch officer cuts corners and beats a confession out of a suspect much to the dismay of the principled Gently who doesn't like interfering London cloak and dagger blokes on his patch. Sergeant Bacchus is offered a future job with the special branch by Empton if he reveals information to him, and the ambitious sergeant says more than he should.
The country settings are evocative and add authenticity to the story. Through flashbacks we see some of the key characters. It's a complicated story with lots of red herrings, smoke and mirrors.
You'll be entertained by this hour and a half mystery with enough puzzles to keep you intrigued.",1280966400,,1656,5.025454545454545
3484150,4,B001B43IUS,"I loved Martin Shaw as Judge John Deed.  That show was also delightfully a very different slant on crime as we got to see it from behind the bench.  Most crime shows are seen from the viewpoints of cops, or, increasingly, forensic specialists.  This series puts us back into the more traditional cop format as Shaw plays George Gently, a London cop who relocates to Northumberland in Britain to solve crimes there upon the murder of his wife.  One different twist to the show is that it is set in the 1960s with all of those changes from present day society readily apparent.  As an American viewer, I didn't find the differences quite as striking as when that time differential is presented with an American setting, such as ""Mad Men.""  You may have to be a UKer to appreciate all the changes between the UK in the 1960s and present day.

The show is very well done.  Martin Shaw and his sidekick, a guy young enough to be his son, are very good together.  Shaw is also one of those English actors with a voice one could listen to forever.  It is just a gorgeous masculine voice which magnifies everything else about him.

My only criticism of the show is that it is yet another crime show and I am getting tired of so many crime shows.  That is why I enjoyed him as a judge so much more.

Sidenote: Female viewers who fell in love with Richard Armitage as the lead in the UK's ""The North"", will find him in the pilot of this show as one of the potential bad guys.

3484151,5,B001B43IUS,"""George Gently: Series 1"" is a television series of British mysteries/police procedurals that debuted in the United Kingdom on BBC1 in April 2007, and debuted on DVD, in the United States, in November 2008.

It stars respected, award-winning actor Martin Shaw (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Judge-John-Deed-Season-One-Pilot-Episode/dp/B002XTBEE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Judge John Deed: Season One & Pilot Episode</a>) as Commander George Gently, and is based on the long-running series of detective novels by Alan Hunter.

Gently is an inconveniently incorruptible top cop, disliked almost as much by his colleagues as by criminal elements, and, therefore, bounces from Scotland Yard to Northumbria.  There he finds an unexpected ally in ambitious young Sergeant John Bacchus, an overeager, opinionated young man who tends to play fast and loose with police procedures, a part played by Lee Ingleby (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nicholas-Nickleby/dp/B00009MEJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nicholas Nickleby</a>).

The well-written, absorbing mysteries unfold against a beautiful backdrop we're meant to think is rural Britain, though as the series was partly financed by the Irish Film Board, I wonder if we aren't looking at beautiful rural Ireland.  Characters discuss the famous Hadrian's Wall that runs across Northumbria, and was built by the Romans during their pre-Christian era occupation of Britain, to keep those wild and wooly Scots out, but we never actually see it.  No matter, the entertainment has lovely backdrops, and is nicely filmed.  The BBC has clearly thrown money at the screen - there are excellent supporting casts, extras aplenty, and the characters' clothing and cars are appropriate to the era, when Britain was just beginning to think about shaking off its post-war deprivation and depression, and London was -possibly--just beginning to dream about swinging a bit.  None of this had reached the Northeast yet, of course - and, I can't help but wonder, did it ever? Never mind.

The mysteries are:
""Gently Go Man."" Gently's wife is killed in a hit-and-run accident; he reacts with bitterness, plans to take his pension, and retire somewhere to fish.  Until he discovers that Joe Webster, (played particularly strongly by Phil Davis), the sadistic criminal whom Gently believes is behind his wife's murder, has been seen in Northumbria.  Gently follows Webster there, and finds himself facing murders in a local motorcycle gang; also that his incorruptible reputation has preceded him, and is making the local cop shop quite uncomfortable.

""The Burning Man.""  A body is found in a local wooded area, shot once through the head, then burned beyond recognition.  Only clue: gold ring engraved ""Wanda,"" found in the victim's stomach.  An emotionally satisfying, complex plot, dealing with IRA gunrunners and a disreputable man named Empton from the Criminal Investigation Department's Special Branch who's suddenly on the scene. Features some strong local women, too, dissatisfied with their pre-ordained roles in life.

""Bomber's Moon.""  Gunter Schmeikel, a German bomber pilot who was shot down during the war, and billeted locally with a friendly pig-farming family, returns to visit. He's a fun-living, very successful businessman now, but he's got a dark side.  And his body is fished out of the harbor.  The detectives find anti-German feeling still strong locally and Schmeikel's cold and arrogant son hard to handle.  If you've read down this far in the reviews, you've likely seen that a number of reviewers have taken strong exception to a very brief scene, of an eyeball, in this episode.  Frankly, I didn't find it ""euuw""-making: the scene, like the rest of the series, is not, to me, bloody, gory, or unduly violent.

These are complex plots, driven by vivid characters - and strong women--and I found them quite gripping.  Shaw plays the title character as a man of gravitas, and an insightful detective.  The 60's setting was a little problematic to me, as the quality of the film work was so obviously top-notch modern that, until and unless I was caught short by a brief scene of people smoking where they ought not to today, or heard a price given in the old money, pounds, shillings and pence, I really kept forgetting the series' historic setting.  A minor quibble, to be sure.",1275264000,9,5843,6.250623441396509
3484152,5,B001B43IUS,"George Gently Series (1 & 2) episodes are based on selections of the 46 Gently novels by Alan Hunter. This first series shows the beginning, when Commander Gently's wife is killed right before his eyes. Even through his grief, the cop takes the high road in finding criminals and bringing them to justice. Very much like ""Midsomer Murders"" [recommended] without the multiple murdered victims, but with the multi-plots in police, private, and associates lives. Good writing, it makes the show.

Gently, played by Martin Shaw, is through, calm, and plays the mentor/father to his youthful assistant, Detective Sargent John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby). Their relationship is as important to the story/series as the crimes and investigations. Both are performance perfect. Bacchus bring some jollification to the show. Gently's grief, sometimes brings on tears. A highly emotional crime series. Setting is always 1964, Northumberland, England.

SUBTITLES ARE PROVIDED IN BOTH SERIES ONE AND TWO. I can vouch for them, I use them. Each episode is a feature-length mystery, suspenseful, fast moving, and packed with plot. Sad that the episodes available total only 7 when there were 46 DCI Gently books. Is there hope for more? Wise British TV did bring back ""Foyle's War"" [6-stars] for additional post-war episodes. Please, BBC, more Gently!

Episode details:
GENTLY GO MAN--based on novel with the same name, after Gently's wife is murdered, he asks for assignment to a crime in Northumberland because the man who killed his wife attended the victim's funeral. Gently wants a shot at him. Gently meets Sgt Bacchus working on the cycle death and they get teamed to find the killer. The relationship between Gently & Bacchus is as much a story plot as finding the killer. With Mrs. Gentley's killer in the neighborhood, the overlap of plots keeps the story moving fast. In the Gently Series tradition, also a bit gruesome--like facial parts removed by a blow-torch. Will the young Bacchus police-style work teamed with the Gently investigation methods? Time will tell.

THE BURNING MAN--based on novel 'Gently Where the Roads Go', a dead body, shot in the head, then burned beyond recognition, leaves one clue. A ring inside the stomach bearing an inscription--Wanda. The investigation leads to a local Irish pub, military guns, the IRA, and an agent of the Special Branch (cop). Bacchus gets caught in the middle--but middle of what? Bacchus and Gently work well together BUT Bacchus has lots to learn.

BOMBER'S MOON--based on book with same name, a fisherman hooks a human eyeball. Then the body is found in the water but with a pre-death broken back. He's ID-ed as a rich German. Plenty of suspects including his son, a farmer, and a pub heavy-weight. Meanwhile Gently is concerned about Sgt Bacchus' financial instability. Cops in financial trouble are susceptible to bribes. The murder investigation begins to unveil a trail of stories and events of the 1940s past war-time emotions of the area. Gentley gets to be a bit physical with suspects with his bully mean right. And then goes quite tender.

I watched Series 2 prior to Series 1. It makes no difference, each episode is a stand-alone 1 1/2 hour feature.  The important thing is not to miss any of the episodes. If no more TV episodes come forth, I may have to start buying the other 39 books. Enjoy the shows.",1273708800,,3361,5.012544802867383

Wasn't disappointed and can hardly wait to see series two.  Shaw is superb as Detective Chief Inspector George Gently, a recently-widowed police detective very much along the same lines as Christopher Foyle in ""Foyle's War"".  Along with his odd, yet entertaining Sergeant, he solves crimes among the unusual characters in the Tyneside region of Northern England.  Unlike Christopher Foyle, Gently can be questioning a suspect one minute and decking him the next.  Based on the first three episodes, I hope there will be more.  And, yes, Martin Shaw is terrific in every way.",1272758400,,716,5.076923076923077

Gritty and believable, and not overly melodramatic.  This probably isn't a great deal more authentic than Frost, but there's a certain feel to it that is missing in some other programs. The lead is played by Martin Shaw, whose work I had not seen before.  Evidently there was only one series produced for this, a real loss for those who love the way the Brits do this!

3484158,5,B001B43IUS,"Quite some years ago I fell in love with British police procedurals, and among my favorite authors was Alan Hunter who created George Gently, a police sleuth in northeast England. June Thomson (Inspector Rudd), Jonathan Ross (Inspector Rogers), and W.J. Burley (Inspector Wycliffe) were turning out very good cop crime novels in those days.
Actor Martin Shaw portrays Gently in a series of English feature-length television programs. In ""Bomber's Moon"" Gently has to solve the murder of a German businessman whose drowned body is discovered near his sailing yacht. The German has returned to the neighborhood where he lived as a P.O.W. during World War II. Most people seem to have genuinely liked the generous German who bought drinks for the locals in their pub.
There are a number of suspects and red herrings. Just as we are convinced of the guilt of one suspect, another one pops up. It seems as if a number of people were at the scene of the crime that night.
Gently has a sergeant assistant named Bacchus who plays fast and loose with protocol. I think the filmmakers have tried to make Gently into a hardnosed and edgy character like Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse in another TV series. Morse has his conventional Sergeant Lewis as a strong secondary character, and Gently has the more confrontational and dodgier Bacchus as his sidekick.
""Bomber's Moon"" is well-done, gripping, suspenseful, and very well-acted. All of the suspects and other roles are portrayed by strong actors, and the viewer gets the feeling of real personalities and real backstories in these subsidiary characters. The production rises above its detective series origin and deals with human problems in an intense way. An interesting device is used: as witnesses/suspects are recounting their stories, the director uses reenactments (like flashbacks) for visualization of the stories.
The time period is the mid-sixties with WWII not that far in the past. The outdoor shots of Northumberland are telling. You may find the Gently books are out-of-print in the States, but they are well worth finding. They're entertaining reading.
In due time I'll supply reviews of the other two dramas in the package.",1253836800,34,2182,5.097765363128492

I wish they would switch companies for their releases.  But, the series itself is wonderful and worth the aggravation of dealing with the Acorn product.",1252713600,,309,4.275862068965517
3484160,5,B001B43IUS,"I was reluctant to watch this series. The lead, Martin Shaw, seemed downright dull, and the supporting lead, Lee Ingleby, was embeded in my memory either as the doomed Midshipman Hollom from ""Master and Commander"" or as the sickly Smike from ""Nicholas Nickleby""...neither actor a great candidate for an exciting copper role; or so I thought...

Well, I am glad I gave the series a go! Shaw turned out to be wanderfully charismatic as the straight-laced, by the book Scotland Yard transplant to the far North; Ingleby was well matched to the role of his well meaning, but rather naive and easily manipulated provincial sergeant... What a delight it was to watch Shaw's character fight for the ""soul"" of his protege and bring him from the verge of corruption, often with little or no cooperation from the young lad! Add clever plots and flawless execution, and you've got yourself a winner!

Each of the three episodes was 90 minutes long. The show was set in the early 60's, but the era remained in the background and did not overwhelm the action. The stories were the key element in each show. There were four more episodes shown this summer on British TV. I am now a fan and can hardly wait to see them!",1247961600,8,1204,4.647887323943662
3484161,5,B001B43IUS,"If you like Foyle's War, you will like the George Gently series.  I am truly hooked on both.  George Gently, whose wife has just been murdered in what appears to be a British gangland revenge hit, removes from London to rural Northumberland. He encounters the cocky, intuitively brilliant and slightly tarnished DS John Bacchus, who may have scored his rank by marrying the chief inspector's daughter.

These are truly hard boiled detective stories, and they get a little bit detailed, so you do have to pay attention. Then again, the cast of characters are rich, complex, perfectly acted, and truly memorable, in the model of hardboiled fiction.  It's a joy to see Gently's perfect ethics kick into play as he faces the temptations of bribes and seduction. I like good guys, and George Gently is a slightly more granite and chiseled version of Foyle from FOYLE'S WAR.

Bacchus, on the other hand, needs a strong hand to rein him in. Then again, grasping, materialistic, and enticed by the easy stepping stones of corruption, John Bacchus also amazes and pleases the reader (and Gently) with the occasional act of brilliance, and every now and then a truly heroic and completely confident act of police finesse.  It's this interplay of Gently mentoring Bacchus and yet Bacchus coming back with truly valuable contributions to their efforts that truly engage you and make you feel like these are stories worth watching.

Every detail of the 60's is lovingly crafted into the stories. There is a lot of visual beauty and reminders of that decade of such change and turmoil.",1243814400,18,1571,4.90566037735849
3484162,5,B001B43IUS,"I received this DVD set as a gift, and watched the three episodes with family.

As entertainment goes, these episodes are, well, entertaining. We weren't surprised by that, since the show is still in production, which is evidence of mass appeal.

Also, we weren't disappointed by Martin Shaw's acting skills: great and still getting better as he continues. Wow.

There's one scene where the crazed killer is holding a gun on George, who cannot resist saying something scathing. The killer closes in, aims right between the eyes, is ready to shoot. George Gently's ""I'm going to die here and now"" reaction is brilliant, thrilling, carries utter conviction and fear to the viewer. Terrific.

We come to the conclusion that ""George Gently"" is intended simply as a vehicle for Martin Shaw's acting.

The rest of the actors aren't groan-worthy, which is good. The actresses, though, gawds bless 'em, are hauling a heavy load, by virtue of the script they are handed.

The women characters fall into four categories:

1. Manikins attired in fashions almost completely, and yet not quite totally, unlike those of the 1960s
2. Idiots
3. Sluts
4. Dead

Then too, the depictions of forensics in this show are most peculiar. Perhaps these are attempts at surrealism?

For instance, there's a scene in which a fisherman's hook plucks an eyeball out of a drowning victim's skull. The recipient proceeds to play with the eyeball. Hoo-boy, catch of the day. I don't expect the film directors to know that underwater corpses inevitably drift face downward. [Okay, I DO expect them to know that, or at least ask about it, for gosh sakes.]

But a six year old child could tell you that it would take some skull carving to remove an eyeball whole, and the only imaginable thing that would result from a fish hook catching in a corpse's eyeball would be to lacerate it in passing.

Then there's another scene where the bad guys splash a bit of petrol on a freshly murdered body, toss in a flaming match, and immediately vacate the place. The next view of the corpse is of a beautifully complete skeleton with absolutely no soft parts remaining. Sorry, but there's no way that sucker burned that thoroughly. The miscreants would have succeeded in burning their victim's clothes and charring the flesh, but that's about it, yeah?

And then the police go on to discuss the stomach contents of the decedent. Having got rid of the organs for the camera, the director wants them back for the rest of the script? I mean, huh? The series is presented as a police drama. It starts with the homicide of Gently's wife, the music is all ""The Blues"", Shaw gives a quite believable presentation of mourning. And then suddenly from out of left field, the director hits the viewer in the face with an eviscerated eyeball.

Trust me, in order to avoid a total ""what the freakin H?"" reaction, I had to muster the ""Oh, okay, surrealism,"" judgment.

And being in a friendly and largely amused way, I'll accept my interpretation of this funkiness as film maker's artistry. It's even possible that is what the director intended.

The final word, if you haven't seen ""George Gently"" already, do so when you get the opportunity. The stories are entertaining, and Martin Shaw is just Great with a capital ""G"".",1243641600,2,3264,4.793226381461675
3484163,5,B001B43IUS,"George Gently is a stiff-upper-lip honest cop who makes his more corrupt fellow officers nervous.  He is paired with a Dirty Harry-in-training younger sergeant who likes to bend rules in order to close cases.  They move from oil-and-water to something like Dutch Uncle-and-adult-in-process to surrogate father and son.  The original books covered ground from the 50's to the 80's; here we are focused on the 60's and for me at least the period setting is only about 85% authentic.  Nevertheless, the acting is superb and the scripts excellent.  This is hard-boiled, British-style.  We're not in Midsomer with kindly vicars with dark secrets.  This is recalcitrant realityville and very much worth a look.",1243123200,3,704,5.232142857142857

Interesting depth of character in a police officer who has just lost his wife. Interesting young sidekick police officer who has a lot to learn from the older man.

We finally watched them and really enjoyed the series except that one of the discs is defective and simply won't play one chapter. In addition the package clearly says the discs are all ""widescreen"". None of the discs is presented in widescreen. Amazon will not accept a return on the disc set (without a 50% restocking fee plus shipping) because it was purchased before Christmas.  They simply won't stand behind a defective product. I guess I didn't understand their returns policy in advance, but now that I do, I'll be looking elsewhere for my British mystery theater DVDs.",1237420800,11,625,4.841121495327103
3484167,5,B001B43IUS,"I discovered this series by accident when I was trying to learn more about Martin Shaw, who plays Adam Dalgliesh in two new P.D. James mysteries, and now plays the lead character in the George Gently series.  I did not like Shaw as much as Roy Marsden, the actor who has played Dalgliesh in a long series of the P.D. James stories but I liked him enough to be curious about him.  This led to my purchase of the first George Gently series, which I like very much and in which I think Shaw is very effective.  It is reminiscent of other detective pairings, such as Morse and Lewis and the ever-shifting pair in Midsomer Murders, but I think it is better than they are in some ways.  George Gently is a particularly interesting character, mixing toughness with integrity, old-school smarts, a bit of humor and a lot of humanity, however well camoflaged. His second in command, Bacchaus, is equally interesting and a stronger character than the usual sergeant or lieutenant.  His blend of cockiness, intelligence and  inclination to cut moral and ethical corners is a constant trial to his superior officer and a constant source of fascination to the viewer watching their interaction.  Both actors are outstanding in their parts, as is the rest of the supporting cast, and the stories are very well written and engrossing.  So far they are set in the 1960's, an era of change in England as elsewhere, and this lends special interest to the mysteries.  Overall, this is a great new detective series and I hope they will continue it and dramatize all the novels on which it is based.  I look forward to the second series.",1236988800,3,1616,4.658450704225352

8281901,3,B001B43IUS,"These are well told and interesting stories, quality TV in a technical sense. I grew up to adulthood in the 1960s, and even though I am from the U.S. it is interesting to watch these programs with an eye to the cultural changes that were taking place back then (many of them not good changes, in my opinion as I look back on the fruit they have produced). As I watched there seemed to be a subtle advocacy for the changes which became less subtle in the later series. Then I went back and read Alan Hunter's 1st four George Gently mystery novels. Then it seemed clear that the character of George Gently, the subject matter, and the storylines were all changed in a way that makes is quite apparent that the filmmakers really were using the films in an effort to promote the cultural changes.",1519776000,,792,4.431506849315069

8281909,5,B001B43IUS,"I have watched all 7 seasons currently available via Amazon/Acorn, every episode, TWICE in the last two years, and I'm 2/3 through my third watch. OK, I'm a bit odd, but I am not a TV watcher because American TV is so lacking in good writing, character development and solid acting. This series, however--like most British drama I've watched--is excellent, with thoughtful, genuinely human and well written stories. Martin Shaw is utterly convincing as the Det. Chief Inspector who holds no one--no matter how powerful--above the law; and Lee Ingleby is really good as the arrogant know-it-all Detective Sgt. (I promise he grows on you.)

I've become such a fan of Martin Shaw that I bought the first two seasons of ""Judge John Deed"" which is only available on DVD; it's also a great series (2001-07) about a judge who is committed to justice, even if he has to break some rules to deliver it. If you're wondering whether George Gently is worth the watch, the answer is YES! And since the show is just ending its 10th and final season on BBC, please Amazon/Acorn--bring us poor Americans the last 3 seasons ASAP!",1499385600,,1112,4.761658031088083
