8570183,3,B00BL3TQZ0,"I am up to almost anything just to watch an old movie but these were a disappointment. The condition of the picture was bad but I could live with that. What bothered me most was that the movies were very difficult to follow. There must be missing scenes as, after going back thinking I had missed something, it was obvious there were gaps in the story. Also, when I received the movie the case was broken in pieces. The DVD seemed to work okay but have to get something else to store it in.",1450483200,3,490,4.223404255319149
8570184,5,B00BL3TQZ0,"No, it's not the greatest film but for Thelma Todd devotees it's a real treat. Cheating Blondes has been unavailable for decades and was thought lost. Thelma appeared in many features away from the Roach studios but in this film she is the star. She wears some fabulous costumes and you even get the chance to hear her sing.",1369872000,9,324,4.508474576271187
8570185,2,B00BL3TQZ0,"This double feature of CHEATING BLONDES/CHEERS OF THE CROWD is from Alpha Home Entertainment, a company that specializes in releasing rare out-of-copyright movies. CHEATING BLONDES(1933) stars beautiful cult icon Thelma Todd, famous for her mysterious death and her many team-ups with just about every famous movie comedian of the 1930s. This is one of Todd's rare non-comedic starring roles, but unfortunately it doesn't show her at her best. But it's not Todd's fault. While trying to look up information about CHEATING BLONDES on the internet, I came across two listed running times: 61 and 66 minutes. Alpha's version clocks in at about 49 minutes. It's obvious the movie has been edited--many scene transitions are pretty jarring, and the story is hard to follow. Thelma Todd actually plays dual roles--twin sisters--and she even gets to sing a song. However, it's hard to judge her performance without seeing the full movie. From the title one would think that CHEATING BLONDES is a exciting example of Pre-Code cinema, but's it's a fairly routine story of one woman hiding from a murder rap by posing as her nightclub-singer twin. The most exciting thing about CHEATING BLONDES is Thelma's picture on the DVD case. Sound and video quality are below-average.

The other feature, CHEERS OF THE CROWD(1935), is even more routine. The story concerns a publicity agent's attempt to bring attention to a fading play. The agent fakes the loss of the theater's payroll, so that it can be found by a ""honest"" man. CHEERS seems to be a complete cut at about an hour, but it's a slow moving hour. The only interesting member of the CHEERS cast is Irene Ware, who co-starred with Bela Lugosi in CHANDU THE MAGICIAN and THE RAVEN. The sound and picture quality of CHEERS is better than CHEATING BLONDES, but not by much.

This double feature will be of interest to Thelma Todd fans, but even they might be disappointed. Alpha should get some credit for putting these films on DVD--nobody else would--but this is certainly not a must buy.
