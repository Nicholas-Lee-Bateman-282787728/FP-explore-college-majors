8721424,5,B0106QUFJ8,"Tomorrow I'm leading a discussion of Lee's second novel, ""Go Set a Watchman"" at a local library. To prepare I just watched this documentary and found it chock full of insight into Lee and her works. Of most importance to me is the Coda, an extra on the DVD. In it we see Harper Lee being presented with the first copy of ""Watchman."" She is alert, though deaf and seems to belie rumors that the book was published without her knowledge, for profit, only.",1447632000,,453,4.404761904761905
8721425,5,B0106QUFJ8,"When First Run Features released the DVD of a documentary titled Hey Boo  Harper Lee & To Kill a Mockingbird in 2011 no one knew that that there would be a new previously unpublished book by the author. Last year that manuscript was discovered and published this past summer. It was called Go Set A Watchman. That was enough for writer, producer and director Mary McDonagh Murphy to go back to the previous film, re-edit it, and update it. That is what this new DVD is. McDonagh adds a short section at the beginning explaining the new book and fills in the end with some interviews with the publicist for the publisher. The core of this film is basically the 2011 film. What is a bit strange is that original ran 85 minutes and  even with the new interviews which bookend the new version, the new DVD runs just 83 minutes. So, my guess is that about 10 minutes was edited out  though I cant tell what parts. Since I reviewed the original Hey Boo, here on Amazon in 2011 and called it a must have, I thought it worthwhile to copy my review here as it pretty much covers the same territory. But before I provide that I wanted to comment on the Bonus feature on the new DVD. It says on the package that: Mary Murphy visits with Harper Lee in her hometown on June 30,2015. What actually happened was that Ms. Lee was brought back to Alabama to receive the first copy of the new book and receive an award. She was in a wheel chair and very fragile to speak much. Director Murphy was there and filmed this but you will hear less an 60 seconds from Ms. Lees lips. The rest of the 12 minute bonus consists of updated interviews with  and the publishers rep and Ms. Lees friends and benefactors, plus comments from famous authors. Its still worth watching; I just want to alert you that there are few comments from Ms. Lee herself.

There have been mixed reviews of the book and a lot of it revolves around the fact that it presents the main character, attorney Atticus Finch, as a racist. This is never discussed in this new DVD. In fact, there isn't much about the plot of Watchman except to say that it takes place years after Mockingbird when the gown-up Scout returns to her hometown.

So, if you have not seen the earlier film, you really do need to see this one. If you already own Hey Boo, youll find that 75% or more of it is repeated here.

I hope you find this review both informative and helpful.

Now here is my review from 2011:

A fascinating 85-minute documentary on the best selling (50 million copies!) novel and its author.

As another Amazon reviewer pointed out, this is MUST HAVE DVD for book lovers and anyone who  like me  returns to the 1962 film starring Gregory Peck on a regular basis.

That said, it was a challenge for Director Mary McDonagh Murphy to craft a documentary about an author (Nelle Harper Lee) who only penned ONE novel (but a powerful one!) and who has not given an interview in the last 45 years! To overcome this  and fill the 82-minute running time, Murphy interviews people close to Lee. There is the composer who gave Lee the funds to submit her book to the major New York publishing houses (four of who rejected the manuscript  boy are they sorry now!) while Lee was working as an airline sales agent. Then there is Lees older sister, Alice, who, at 99 years old, is the oldest still-practicing attorney in Missouri! She has stories to tell! Nell Harper Lee still lives in Southern Alabama  though Murphy fails to mention that she had a stroke and is fighting blindness  and we hear from her long time Pastor and neighbor.

Because celebrities sell DVDs too, we hear from newsman Tom Brokaw, singer/songwriter Roseanne Cash and everyones favorite book club hostess  OPRAH  as to how the book had a profound effect on them. Its interesting that when Oprah discusses the civil rights movement  some of which was powered by the story told in TKAM  she acknowledges that, by the time she was growing up, there were no separate rest rooms and lunch counters in her town.

Of course there are LOTS of scenes from the film  especially key moments  and the actress who played young Scout (the character that Lee based on her own life) reads passages from the novel. I found it fascinating to learn that author Truman Capote lived in the same small Alabama town as Lee and served as the model for the character Dill. (Capote broke off his friendship with Lee shortly after the novel was published.)

The bonus features on the DVD include 11-minutes of extended interviews (including four minutes with Oprah and a text interview with Director Murphy.

Speaking of the interviews, in a few of the studio interviews in the film there is the annoying sound of traffic going by. Very strange!

As I said at the beginning of this review, this a must have for avid readers and fans of TKAM. For others, this is about as complete a treatment as you will find of Lee and her novel. Murphy uses excerpts from the last recorded interview Lee gave (for WQXR Radio in New York in 1964), and with Lees current health there will certainly be no more. (update  the bonus on the new DVD really is not an interview)

8721426,5,B0106QUFJ8,"It took fifty-five years and a newly discovered Harper Lee book called, Go Set the Watchman to push this documentary.  Its an amazingly beautiful event recalling not just a great film and book but the racism and heroism of the south.  Harper Lee is portrayed as a heroine for tackling such a taboo subject fifty years ago, particularly as a white woman.  Read by everyone and seen as a classic, this book shed enormous light on the plight of blacks in the south and the rampart racism that entailed.

Various stars and authors are interviewed about how this book affected them, sometime reading aloud from the book.  Its a magical experience.  The editing of real footage of the plight of the Civil Rights movement and scenes from To Kill A Mockingbird are extremely moving.  The story of Ness Harper Lee and Truman Capote (her next door childhood neighbor) is touched upon with great sadness and tragedy.  The literary importance and historical significance is astounding to watch.  This is a must see for any age.  Film provided for review purposes.",1436745600,3,1051,4.82122905027933
