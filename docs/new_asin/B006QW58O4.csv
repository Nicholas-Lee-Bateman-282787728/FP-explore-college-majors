8503387,5,B006QW58O4,"I bought this DVD (and others) directly from TeleAnimation.  The film quality is very good, the landscape and scenery is absolutely beautiful and makes my riding my indoor exercise bike fun!  I imaging being in Germany and cycling through the country side.  Only complaint I have is that these DVDs should have had background music or at least some nature sounds.  There is nothing, so I play my own iPod when using these DVDs.  Anyhow, very nice indoor cycling landscape.  Vielen Dank, sehr schnes DVD!",1410912000,,503,4.858823529411764
