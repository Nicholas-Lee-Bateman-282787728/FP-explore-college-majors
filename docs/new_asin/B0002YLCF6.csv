2145467,4,B0002YLCF6,"Kim Possible: The Villain Files is a Disney DVD compilation of four episodes of the classic Disney Channel animated action-comedy series. In this DVD, Kim and her sidekick Ron Stoppable battles against, Dr. Drakken, Shego, and other evil baddies. The special features includes a villian house party game and trailers to other Disney Channel movies on DVD. This Kim Possible DVD is perfect for teens and tweens who are fans of the programme. :)",1309392000,4,443,5.0
2145468,5,B0002YLCF6,Our kids love these movies.  It's fun to watch them since the series is no longer on the Disney channel.,1290556800,,104,4.2
2145469,4,B0002YLCF6,"What is there to say about Kim Possible that hasn't already been said? She's a high-school cheerleader, an international crimefighter, *and* a popular girl who's best friends with the school ""loser."" In other words, Kim Possible is awesome. So is her show, a sweet, funny offering that pokes gentle fun at what's considered ""hip"" and manages to find its own coolness.

Four episodes are offered up on this DVD - and, in case you're wondering, do not feature any more or less villainous activity than any other four episodes of KP, such as the ones found on the ""The Secret Files."" Still, the villains remain humorous, well-developed, and a large part of the show's appeal. Deranged golfers, mad scientists whose intellect *far* exceeds their common sense, and bored rich guys who are only attempting world domination as a hobby make up a very colorful (literally) cast of characters.

The episodes are as follows:

*Blush - Dr. Drakken sprays Kim with an ""embarrassment potion"" which will cause her to slowly vanish when she blushes. So, of course, what better time for her longtime crush Josh Mankey to ask her out to dinner? A good episode, with some great banter between Drakken and Shego (villainous associates who couldn't be more different), one-liners by Ron, and cuteness from Rufus.

*Animal Attraction - Animalogy, a craze that purports to ""predict your perfect soul mate,"" is sweeping Middleton High, and, even Kim gets swept up in its appeal. Meanwhile, Senor Senior, Sr. attempts to freeze a Billionaire's Club that he was kicked out of. His son, Senor Senior, Jr. is along for the ride - and he's been studying Animalogy as well. . . Magazine quizzes get some cute (and long-deserved) critique, and Junior never fails to crack me up.

*Number One - Kim has to work with an arrogant Global Justice agent to solve a case involving a kidnapped rocket scientist and a rogue golfer. Cheerleading archrival Bonnie uses the situation to try to overthrow Kim as squad captain. A villain with a whacked-out motive, hilarious chemistry between Kim and conceited agent Will Du, and a few scenes of genuine peril make this one of the most unique episodes. Duff Killigan's always fun.

*Showdown at the Crooked D - Kim's family goes to visit her uncle and cousin, who run a dude ranch in. . . Montana. Next door, a ""Research Roundup"" is taking place, leaving Kim's father green with envy over not being invited. Perhaps it's for the best, though, because it turns out to be a tourist trap. Emphasis on ""trap"" - it's hosted by none other than Dr. Drakken, out to turn the rest of the world's great minds into dunderheads! At the time of this DVD's release, this episode hadn't aired yet. Although the novelty value has now worn off, and a scene where Kim's father is uncharacteristically cruel dampens its appeal, it's still a fun, funny episode, highlighted by Kim's cute cousin Joss. It's worth a watch just to see Drakken in cowboy clothes.

The DVD contains a few bonus features, though nothing of substance. They are:

*The Villain House Party - Undercover at a villain party, you must gather information about each villain's ""Special Powers"" and ""Wacko Villain Plan"" to help Kim. However, each 411 consists of no-duh facts and snarky comments. Jokes about villains' terrible fashion sense and bad breath just plain aren't funny. And, without putting too fine a point on it, they represent a large part of what kept me away from the series for such a long time - I was convinced such a tone was representative of the series' attitude as a whole, even though it's not. There's also a reference to ""spiking the punch"" that I'm surprised made it past the Disney censors.

*It's Just You music video - Boy-band LMNT sings a song from the Kim Possible soundtrack and mess around with special effects. It's not terribly inspired, and doesn't always make a whole lot of sense, but the song is catchy and LMNT sings well enough.

*Although I don't have the case, I would presume this program is presented in the same 16x9 widescreen and 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound as its sibling DVD, ""The Secret Files.""

If you'd like to own some good episodes of Kim Possible, this is one of the few ways to do it. The strength of the show garners four stars, but the weakness of the bonus features prevent it from reaching a full five.

P.S. Nowhere in any of the episodes has Drakken been said to have halitosis. ;)",1287619200,,4405,4.743790849673203
2145470,2,B0002YLCF6,"I love the Kim Possible series and enjoyed watching it on the Disney Channel before they replaced it with sophomoric sitcoms. And it's nice to at least have a few episodes from the first two seasons available to watch. However, I don't understand why they don't release seasons 1 and 2 as complete sets in the US. How are you going to release the first two seasons in countries other than the one it was created in? What's wrong with them? Disney, get with it and start making decisions that make sense.",1264464000,9,503,4.478260869565218

8034851,3,B0002YLCF6,"This video has several randomly gathered episodes grouped together. These episodes are not unique one off adventures that you can't get anywhere else. If you buy the seasons you WILL own all of them eventually, so there is no real need to purchase this product. Additionally there is a ""game"" where you [playing KP] sneak into a house and have to spy on who is in the house and find out what ""kooky plan"" they have going. There is no challenge to this game as you are invisible. All you have to do is move into one of three different rooms and click on one of the four villains present in the room to find out who they are or what their kooky plan is. This game is challenging and interesting only for a four year old or less.",1503705600,,726,4.23021582733813
