'Best Revenge' tells the story of Charlie, an unemployed guy who has been a small-time marijuana dealer and is now offered a chance for a really lucrative smuggling job.  Unfortunately the offer comes from his best friend Brett, whom he suspects of overromanticizing the whole thing; and soon he finds that his girlfriend's brother Leo, a local gangster, is bankrolling the project.  When Leo takes Brett hostage, Charlie is forced, out of loyalty to his friend, to take on the job.

Charlie flies to Spain to meet with an old friend (admirably played by the late Levon Helm) who has the connections in Morocco to get the job done.  By events the two run into various roadblocks, literally and figuratively, land in a Moroccan jail, get beat-up, encounter a crooked cop, and find themselves at the mercy of one of Leo's unintelligent henchmen.  Charlie realizes he is really all alone in a situation he tried to avoid in the first place.

The movie is not really focused on 'revenge' as Charlie remains unaware he is being double-crossed till the very end.  His plan for revenge is therefore only a last-minute reaction-- though apparently very successfully done-- to have everyone who's left receive what they most justly deserve.  But, as the theme song says, sometimes 'survival is the best revenge'.

The movie locations are beautiful.  There are many shots of the southern-Spain countryside during the long rural car rides and the scenery in and about the Strait of Gibraltar is fascinating.  The movie is a Toronto production and the North American locations are shot there.  The vehicles are just cool-- a 1970s Fiat, an older manual-shift Mercedes, a well-abused VW van, and Brett's 1969-era Corvette.

Unfortunately the music score by Keith Emerson is simply awful.  Though the instrumental songs he provided are well-done and well-placed, the otherwise talented keyboardist seems to choose the most inopportune times to make the soundtrack obvious, even overpowering, forcing a very dated (even for 1982) and corny overall feeling to the film.  However the title song by Amanda Hayley is much better, having a dark, almost untrustworthy feeling that fits the film's 1980s law-and-order or 'defy The Man' theme perfectly.

As Charlie, John Heard is characteristically reticent and sensible, making us respect and like this guy who is otherwise a criminal.  John Rhys-Davies, the celebrated character actor, plays Mustapha, 'a good A-rab' as the character is known, with great aplomb and dignity. Alberta Watson is very tender and cute as Charlie's girlfriend (I love her hair!) and her character's innocence and sensitivity reminds one of Katherine Ross's role in 'Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid'.

To me, Levon Helm's portrayal of the good-old-boy caught by circumstances in a foreign land makes the whole film just priceless.  You suspect this character may have been at Vietnam, or else a draft dodger or deserter-- he drives a surplus Army Jeep and wears a US Army infantry shirt from the '70s but his passport is problematic.  Though he is settled in a safe and secure life as a tavern operator in Spain with a lovely younger wife and three 'ninos', he will still risk all to help a friend.  In the end his reward is as great as Charlie's, and deservedly so.  I love how Helm adds some physical humor to the film's last lines as though it's as much a surprise to the actor as to the character.",1335052800,,3485,4.91965811965812
