8112213,3,B000EOU4QM,"... the fire on the DVD is just a part of the cover picture. I wished to see more of the burning wood as it is on the picture. The real good thing is, it is a real wood fire and there are no zooms etc. Finally, I love it

and won't buy another one.",1168819200,,248,3.5090909090909093
8112214,5,B000EOU4QM,"The Video Fireplace is a very simple fireplace that remains consistent as there is no decoration, scene variations, ""pans and zooms"" or music to select. Once you put in the DVD, all you do is press play. That makes this DVD interesting if you don't want to spend time selecting various moods and simply want a fireplace. I did notice that the speed of the flames seems to have been enhanced, although I only notice this when I look at the TV.

Mostly, I just have this on while reading and it creates a warm glow in the room. If you love having a fire, but don't want to deal with cleaning out a fireplace, then this is a perfect solution. I've tried out a variety of fireplace DVDs and this one is the most practical. The birch logs crackle and pop and make you feel like there really is a real fire burning. 5 stars for the crackling of the aged birch logs. I've given most of my other fireplace DVDs away, but I think this is the one I'll keep.

The only thing I wish is that they had filmed the fire from a greater distance instead of retaining a close-up shot of the logs. The logs could also be more artistically arranged in the fireplace. Looping would be nice, but I do enjoy seeing a fire from start to finish instead of just a fireplace repeating the same scenes.

8112215,3,B000EOU4QM,"When an old video fireplace DVD wore out, I bought this one but didn't like it as much as the old one.  The flames on this one flicker at such a rapid rate that it is not relaxing to watch.  If I could slow down the play rate of my DVD player, it might look normal, but as it is, it feels like it is on fast-forward.",1167350400,3,316,3.701492537313433
8112216,5,B000EOU4QM,"Yes, this is a real fire, not gas, just like it says on the package.  The birch logs are a plus!  They burn very hot to begin with but then settle down to a very hearty fire, so you get the full experience of having your own fire from first flames to warm coals.  The fire really looks like it's in my computer screen. I'd like to see a Hi-Def version offered.",1142899200,7,360,3.9722222222222223
