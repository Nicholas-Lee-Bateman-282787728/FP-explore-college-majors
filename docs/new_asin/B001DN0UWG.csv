8294229,5,B001DN0UWG,"I've been very pleased with the quality of this series, although I had some concerns that Black Lagoon may have lost some focus with the Second Barrage, Volume 2.

However, Black Lagoon got back on track quickly - expect major surprises in store for Rock regarding his involvement with Yukio and the price he may have to pay with Balalaika.

Black Lagoon is really becoming one of the best series to appear in 2008 and continues to impress with with the quality of its plots, action, and voice actors. It is well worth getting and watch this series continue to grow.",1227398400,,566,4.594059405940594
8294230,5,B001DN0UWG,"Wow!!, keep this series going. This is one of the best series I have ever
watch. Non stop action that kicks you in the teeth and you want more. This is one of those high octane anime`s that only comes around once in a while. The director Sunao Katabuchi has hit this series out of the park. The characters fit so well with the stories and action. Every one of my friends that have watched this series have been blown away with the detail,drama and non stop action. This series is way too good to end.",1227225600,,500,4.21875
