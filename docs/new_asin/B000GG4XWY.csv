These are the dates WWE has listed. I know off the top of my head the SuperBrawl was 2/29/92 so others may be off as well

judging by listing this is the greatest WWE dvd of all time IMO",1156291200,32,1657,4.787985865724382
2610651,5,B000GG4XWY,"Pillman was one of the best High flyers of his time and in some ways ahead of his time.  I hope to god that they put that tag team match him and Austin had with Flair and Arn.  I can't seem to remember the Pay Per View's name but it was a classic tag team match and I think Barry Windham interfered at the end of it.  I wonder who they will get to do the interviews.  They might get Bret Hart, Steve Austin, Ric Flair,Arn Anderson, and Chris Benoit since those are the only people I can think of who had any link with Pillman during his career especially Austin.",1156204800,,562,4.036036036036036

2610653,5,B000GG4XWY,"The dvd needs his matches with Ric Flair, with Jushtin Thunder Liger ""or however you spell it lol"", vs Arn Anderson, vs The Z-Man ""yes the Z-Man lol"" and teaming with the Z-Man, vs Barry Windham, vs Ricky Steamboat, some tag matches with Steve Austin as the Hollywood Blondes especially their awesome feud against RickY Steamboat and Shane Douglas, vs William Regal ""then he was Steven Regal, vs Sting, vs Steve Austin one on one after the Hollywood Blondes split up, plus some matches with him in the Horseman and his last feud before his death against Goldust.

  Extras: with comments on him by Chris Beniot, William Regal, Arn Anderson, Ric Flair, Barry Windham and Stone Cold Steve Austin and Pillman's debut match. This shouldn't only be a dvd about how he was a loose cannon though which would make him look bad like the Ultimate Warriors made him look bad! Since it's called Loose Cannon it would seem like it might focus more on him outside the ring than on his in ring skill. The guy deserves a dvd showing how talented he was though. So he deserves all the matches I mentioned and then some. I don't know if he'll get that from the WWE though. Whatever match he ever had that was good...should be here. If the WWE is only gonna make one Brian Pillman dvd than they should makee sure they get it right!",1155772800,,1312,4.504201680672269
2610654,5,B000GG4XWY,"As great of a tragedy as the untimely death of Brian Pillman was, the greater tragedy has been the complete ignoring of his existence by the WWE for the last 9 years.  Pillman's death came at a particularly bad time for the wrestling world, as it's booming popularity had placed the companies (WWF and WCW) under a media microscope.  In a way I believe McMahon resented Pillman for that.  However, it was difficult to feel bad for McMahon at the time.  One night after the death of the ""Loose Cannon"", Vince interviewed the recently widowed Mrs. Pillman in what seemed like a very disturbing attempt at grabbing some of those all important ratings.  For the next couple of weeks a beautiful video montage that was voiced over by Brian's close friend Jim Ross was shown.  And then it was over, and Brian was never mentioned again.  I have been watching wrestling since that time and I can honestly say that I don't believe I have heard Brian's name mentioned more than maybe once (perhaps in the Raw Tenth Anniversary tribute video?).  For whatever reason his legacy was erased, and his name forgotten.

Nine years later the WWE is releasing a double dvd set dedicated to the life of a man who was consistently and undoubtebly ahead of his time.  Prior to what should have been a career ending motorcycle accident, Pillman was one of the best performers in the business.  His matches constantly stole the show, and his good looks made him a hit with the female audience.  Incredibly, Brian Pillman became one of the greatest heel's in the business, and along with Steve Austin formed ""The Hollywood Blondes"".  The two made the mistake of getting over in WCW, and were de-pushed.  Brian however was not done.  What followed was a phenomenal heel run with the Horseman, and a worked shoot feud with Kevin Sullivan that was clearly way ahead of it's time (""I quit booker man"").  What happened next will without a doubt be the most enchanting aspect of the dvd.  Pillman played Eric Bischoff into letting him out of his contract, and started a bidding war between three companies that made him the hottest free agent in the wrestling world.  A motorcycle accident that happened shortly after his signing with the WWF would destroy his ankle and take away the majority of his wrestling ability.  Pillman was able to compensate for this by going full blown into his loose cannon persona, to the point where even the boys in the back didn't know whether or not he was really crazy.  The truth is Brian Pillman was a father, a husband and one of the greatest entertainers in the history of wrestling.  He survived multiple throat operations as a child, and overcame numerous injuries that would have stopped any other man from achieving his dreams.

Rest in Peace Brian, hopefully after the release of this dvd you will take your rightful place in wrestling history, and live forever.",1155427200,14,4175,4.813725490196078
2610663,5,B000GG4XWY,"Excellent DVD. The documentary is great. We hear from several of Mr. Pillman's wrestling colleagues along with some of his family members including his widow and children. The set has 15-16 matches and a few promos. ""Pillmans XXX Files"" is definitely at the top of of my favorites list. It's classic stuff. I haven't watched the matches yet, but they're probably really, really good. It's sad that Brian Pillman left us so soon. While I was watching the documentary, I thought about what Chris Jericho wrote in his second book. He watched the DVD and said ""...it's amazing how many of us (""us"" as in wrestler's like himself) have died young. It's so sad."" I agree with him 110%. It is sad. But like the rest, Brian Pillman will always be remembered and won't ever be forgotten. RIP Brian Pillman.",1381449600,,796,4.692857142857143
2610664,4,B000GG4XWY,The documentary sheds light on who Brian Pillman truly was. Both his familiy and friends tell us in their words how truly special he was. The match selection covered some of the most important matches of his career. I highly recommend this compilation to enthusiasts.,1359158400,,267,4.955555555555556
2610665,5,B000GG4XWY,I was thrilled when I saw that WWE released a DVD set for Brian Pillman. He was the reason I got back into wrestling in '92 when flyin Brian turned heel and started tagging with Barry Windham. Like other WWE releases this features a documentary on pillmans life from beginning to end. They talk to his family and some of the guys that worked with him throughout the years. It's a very good story and you learn alot of stuff about him that you may have not known. It's too bad that it took his death for a DVD of his career but it's a nice tribute for a great athlete and a better man.,1311379200,,584,4.086956521739131
2610666,4,B000GG4XWY,"Not knowing a lot about the wrestler Brian Pillman, this two-disc set covering his career was not only informative but entertaining.  His partnership with Stone Cold Steve Austin and the events after his death where some of the most interesting of the set.  I would highly recommend this dvd, even if you weren't a fan of wrestling of at this time.",1300752000,,348,4.688524590163935
2610667,3,B000GG4XWY,"My father was a huge Flying Brian fan.  And this set was originally given to him, but once you get past the documentary, the dvd set falls flat.  Seems to be a problem with some of the WWE DVD sets released during this time period.",1292457600,,231,4.111111111111111
2610668,4,B000GG4XWY,This one is entertaining as he was a wild man. He had a ton of talent but also had a ton of demons. May he RIP.,1272240000,,111,3.3076923076923075
2610669,5,B000GG4XWY,"This is a DVD I would definitely recommend for the slew of wrestling fans who came in during the ""Attitude"" era who only have one image of Brian Pillman. The documentary and accompanying bonus matches really illustrate the pioneering role Brian Pillman played in changing the landscape of the American wrestling scene. The matches from his WCW days are amazing display of what the WWE is capable of now that they own nearly all of America's professional wrestling video archives. Furthermore, these type of documentaries are what I love to see as they truly expose the humanity and complexity of both professional wrestlers and the wrestling business.",1235433600,2,651,5.093457943925234
2610670,5,B000GG4XWY,"I like that WWE shows Brian Pillman for what he was, a legend that went too early. I also like that pay homage to WCW, because that is where most of his success was. I only wish they showed more his of WCW matches like from television, he wrestled 400 Norman The Lunatic and came out on top. Overall, I recommend this to anyone who wants a good collector dvd.",1221436800,3,359,4.142857142857143
2610671,5,B000GG4XWY,"This was an excellent dvd to go over the life of Brian Pillman.  I nearly forgot what a great athlete he was.  If it hadn't been for an accident, its hard to imagine of what kind of superstar that he could have been.  I honestly believe that he could have become the world champion.  I hope you have or will take the time to go back to see the man that not only helped Stone Cold Steve Austin gain his stardom, but at times overshadowed the rattlesnake.",1173312000,2,453,4.172413793103448
2610672,5,B000GG4XWY,"it was a pleasure to watch this dvd. i forgot how entertaining brian pillman could be. this dvd really brings him back to life!!the extras were great, the matches they showed really reminded me of what a great wrestler he was! it also made me sad that he died so young. for any pillman fans, this dvd is a must purchase!",1168473600,3,320,4.262295081967213
2610686,5,B000GG4XWY,"I have to give it up to WWE even though they now suck hard they showed me that they are still capable of putting out a good DVD...sometimes.

I was a huge fan of Brian Pillman from the beginning till the tragic end. I can remember watching the Hollywood Blondes use every trick in the book in feuds with Ricky Steamboat/Shane Douglas and the Ric Flair/Arn Anderson classic confrontation.

This DVD highlights it all. Early days in WCW, Teaming with Austin, The above mentioned Blondes feud with Flair&Anderson. Battling former partner 'Stunning' Steve Austin. Joining the Horsemen. Genesis of the loose cannon, Debut in ECW on his way to 'Rape, Pilage & Plunder the WWF!'

This is a must have for any collector of WWE's biography DVD's or an old school Brian Pillman fan. The WWE Hall Of Fame will never be legitimate until they honor the man who innovated the high risk style in America. And as the Loose Cannon 'worked' the wrestling world! Wrestling is not the same without him, long live the legacy of Flyin' Brian!",1168041600,2,1019,4.681564245810056
2610687,5,B000GG4XWY,"I bought these DVD, because i missed part of the stoy in TV.  Very complete, and some great aditional matches.  If your a Brian Fan, a must have.",1167868800,,145,4.142857142857143
2610688,3,B000GG4XWY,"I was expecting big things from this dvd. Lets go to the good points 1st. The Bio is really good. His matches are great for most part. Bad points No entrance music They didn't show Austin flushing Pillman head down loo. Not 1 promo,Wheres the promo from when he reunited Hart Foundation? No footage leading up to his matches This isn't the best dvd out there by wwe. This was a Xmas gift im very dissapointed that wwe didn't put the effort in to it.",1167696000,,449,4.294117647058823
2610689,5,B000GG4XWY,"From seeing this DVD about the life and career of Brian Pillman, I have to say that it does a very good job in chronicling Pillman's life and career from his childhood to his start in Calgary Stampede Wrestling to his career in WCW, which included his partenship with Steve Austin as the Hollywood Blondes, to his matches with people such as Luger and Jushin Liger, his membership of the 4 Horsemen and the beginning his ""loose cannon"" angle as well as his stints in ECW and WWE(which would see him joining the Hart Foundation and him partcipation in the infamous gun incident).

I also thought that the matches that are included in this DVD are very good as well, such as his matches with Luger, Liger, Goldust, etc.

Overall, I think that this DVD is a great chronicling of the life and career of Brian Pillman and shows why he is considered to be a great wrestler.",1165017600,,867,4.481012658227848
2610690,5,B000GG4XWY,"Brian Pillman is a forgotten name in the history of wrestling which is a shame concidering how innovative he was in & outside the ring. It didn't matter if it was Flyin' Brian, the Hollywood Blonde, the Horsemen or even the Loose Cannon...Pillman was a innovator & always fighting against the odds and I'm glad that his career will have justice done to it on this DVD set. What is also a plus for anyone here is that it has alot of the old WCW/NWA footage from the late '80s/early '90s that you really don't see on WWE DVDs including two of WCW's most innovative & original matches they've had.

The DVD stars talking about Brian's growing up including throat problems when he was really young to his football career & overcoming the ""he's too small"" sterotype that some get when it comes to playing football. His days in Calgary Stampeed Wrestling are covered such as his tag team with Bruce Hart called Bad Company before moving on to WCW as Flyin' Brian. The way Brian brought a unique style & was able to stand out above the others despite his size (ala Rey Mysterio) and his ability to make others like Lex Luger look better than he was in the ring...the only downside to this was that they didn't bring up the Yellow Dog angle since that was his first real storyline within the company. The importance to the Light Heavyweight Title and how Brian fought to make that title really valuable to the company is brought up along with the importance of his marriage (including footage from the actual wedding video) is also talked about. The DVD really kicks into high gear here as his run in the tag team of the Hollywood Blondes with ""Stunning"" Steve Austin is heavily talked about. The story of how they were just thrown together by Dusty Rhodes (who finally comments about the whole situtation) and started to get over, developing a team concept & look even down to their wrestling boots (you have to see that one to believe it), having the top fueds with people like Ric Flair & Anderson along with Steamboat & Douglas, and the backstage politics that led to the breakup of the team. Pillman joining the Horsemen is glossed upon before you see how he transformed himself into the Loose Cannon character including the two most memorable incidents involving him catching Bobby Heenan off guard & dropping the ""F"" bomb on live TV and the strap match between him & Kevin Sullivan resulting in the ""bookerman"" line. His short time in ECW is talked about & shown through highlights (the whole footage is too vular for WWE) including the story of how he got released from WCW and Joey Styles talking about an incident that happened which made lose all respect for Pillman. The infamous life changing car accident is talked about next along with his arrival to the WWE. The whole story behind the buildup & the actual incident involving Pillman pulling a gun on Austin is heavily talked about including comments from those who worked for WCW at the time & what they thought about it. Pillman's run in the Hart Foundation is talked about along with the reasoning behind his short stint of being an announcer is talked about along with what was going on behind the scenes with him continuing to work & hide the pain from his heavily injured ankle from the accident. Pillman's last angle involving Goldust & Marlena and the real story between those three about along with the ""XXX Files"" promos are discussed before leading into the story behind his death & the interview with his wife the next night on RAW close this documentry out.

Other DVD extras include interview outtakes from such people as Road Warrior Animal, Mick Foley talking about his first match with Pillman, Stone Cold talking about their first meeting & how Brian should be remembered, Eric Bischoff & Jim Ross commenting on an incidents in which Pillman lived his character with J.R. also telling a story about a funny ""meeting"" he had in a bathroom with Brian. Also included is the entire gun incident involving Pillman & Austin, the ""XXX Files"" promos involving Pillman & Marlena, a WCW interview with Brian from '95, and the Flare For The Old skit with him & Steve Austin.

Matches Include:
International Tag Team Championship Match vs. Midnight Cowboys - This was joined in progress and was nothing special past highlighting Pillman as a high flyer in the beginning stages of his career.
""Stampede Wrestling"" Apr. '88

vs. United States Champion Lex Luger - This was one of those matches that gives Luger his reputation of being a bad wrestler because Pillman completely carried this match. Brian dominated a majority of the match with his mix of high flyin' moves & mat wrestling. He worked on Luger's shoulder with the story being that he was tryin' to keep Luger off his feet thoughout the match which dominated. Luger was on the defense most of the time & his offense consisted of punches, kicks, and clotheslines whenever he was in control. Luger got the win in the end off Brian making a big mistake but for the most part, this was a Brian Pillman exibition match.
NWA Halloween Havoc '89

NWA United States Tag Team Championship Match w/Z-Man vs. Fabulous Freebirds - This was the finals of the United States Tag Team Tournament. It started off hot with close near falls in the early going before the Freebirds slowed the pace down & wore down both men before Pillman picked up the pace by doing a high dropkick to Jimmy Garvin on the top rope & delivering a flying clothesline across the ring onto Hayes on the way to his team winning the championship.
NWA Feb. '90

War Games Match w/Sting & Steiner Brothers vs. Ric Flair, Sid Vicious, Barry Windham, Larry Zbyszko - For those who never seen a War Games match, it's a two ringed cage match with a caged top on it & the first two wrestlers go in for 5 minute period. A coin toss is held (which the heels always seem to win) to determine who goes in next and the teams alternate wrestlers entering the match. When the final wrestler enters the cage, the only way to win is by submission or surrender.
It should be noted that Anderson was injured at this time so his replacement for this match was Larry Zbyszko...Zybszko wasn't an official member of the Four Horsemen.  Pillman had an injured arm and rushed into the cage as the first man against the wishes of his team.  There were various highlights throughout the match such as all the Horsemen being tapped in figure fours at one time, Windham & Flair both wearing the ""crimson mask"", and Sid Vicious delivering the most vicious (no pun intended) powerbomb I've even seen onto Pillman.
NWA WrestleWar '91

WCW Light-Heavyweight Championship Match vs. Richard Morton - This was the finals of the tournament to crown the first WCW Light-Heavyweight Championship.  This was a different style than normal from Pillman has him & Morton worked a more grounded style than the high-flyin' that Pillman was used to.  Good match showcasing a different style of Pillman.
WCW Halloween Havoc '91

Loser Leaves Town Match w/El Gigante vs. Arn Anderson & Barry Windham - This match was pretty short & sweet (with Pillman had to carry his team with El Gigante's wrestling skills being so bad that he made Great Khali look impressive) as this wasn't anything special past this match being the beginning of the ""Yellow Dog"" storyline.
""Clash Of The Champions"" June '91

w/Barry Windham vs. Z-Man & Johnny Gunn - This was the early stages of Pillman's first heel turn & this match just really showcased how he was able to apply his ""Air Pillman"" offense in a heelish faction along with starting to showcase his cocky attitude.
Dec. '92

Steel Cage Match: WCW Tag Team Champions Hollywood Blondes vs. Dos Hombres - The story here is that Dos Hombres is actually Ricky Steamboat & ""Shane Douglas"" underneath a mask using the gimmick that Edge/Christian & Hardy Boyz would later use on each other during the Los Conquistidors angle in 2000. This wasn't their best encounter as it was really Tom Zenk under Douglas mask (Shane was released/fired before the PPV). The match itself wasn't bad but didn't top or match the calibur that all 3 men & the real Douglas have had earlier in the year.
WCW Slamboree '93
(""Legacy Of Stone Cold Steve Austin"")

Thundercage Match w/Sting & Dustin Rhodes vs. Rick Rude, Paul Orndorff, Steve Austin - For those who have never seen the ""ThunderCage"" before, it was WCW's version of what we would later know as a Hell In A Cell match.  This was a normal six man tag match with both men getting their moments during the match before it really broke down into a brawl in the end with both Pillman & Orndorff bleeding.
WCW SuperBrawl IV '94

vs. Jushin Liger - This was the debut match on WCW Monday Nitro and boy did they know how to kick this show off in style.  This was very past paced with the high-flyin' action that you expected that wasn't always pretty (like a botched head sissors off the top rope) but also had a good mix of wrestling with moves like the surfboard/reverse headlock combination by Liger & a DDT off the top rope by Pillman.  Great action as you would expect from both men.
""WCW Nitro"" Sept. '95

vs. Dean Malenko - In a rare ""heel vs. heel"" match during the phase where Pillman began to abandon his ""Flyin' Brian"" persona for the ""Loose Cannon."" This match was more of a matbased wrestling match between both men that saw Pillman just going off at times screaming at the fans & into the camera.  Dean Malekno had the nickname ""Iceman"" for a reason as he usually doesn't show much emotion in the ring but Pillman pushed him to his breaking point after slapping him that caused Malenko to really turn it up.  Good match but it was more about pushing Pillman's character.
""WCW Nitro"" Jan. '96

vs. Eddie Guerrero - This was just like the previous match against Malenko where he was more matbased between both men with Pillman once again acting like a complete nut under the ""Loose Cannon"" persona however this match is more memorable than anything else for Pillman scaring Bobby Heenan to death to the point where he dropped the ""F"" bomb on live TV.
""WCW Clash Of The Champions"" Jan. '96

vs. Steve Austin - This match had a special stipulation in that the members of the Hart Foundation (except Bret, he wasn't there) were handcuffed to the ringpost to prevent them from getting involved...eventhough Austin did get his shots in whenever he could.  This was just a big brawl between the former ""Hollywood Blondes"" that resulted in Pillman having a broken nose right now and getting so out of control that the referee ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time.  In this end, this match & the aftermath was more focused on setting up...
""RAW"" June '97

w/Hart Foundation vs. Steve Austin, Legion Of Doom, Ken Shamrock, Goldust - ...this match.  This was one of the most unique main events in wrestling history as the Hart Foundation were heels in America but babyfaces everywhere else in the world so they had a heavy hometown advantage with this PPV being in the hometown of the Hart Family of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  This was a wild six man tag with various moments like the opening minutes between Bret & Austin, Niedhart mocking Ken Shamrock & paying for it, Austin going so far as to attack the Hart family members at ringside...including getting his hands on Stu, both Owen & Austin being taken out of the match, Pillman making an ass of himself, and the aftermath & celebration.
IYH: Canadian Stampede '97

vs. Goldust - This was the rematch from SummerSlam with the stipulations that Pillman would leave WWE if he lost but he would get the personal services of Marlena if he won.  Based off how personal this feud got, this was the brawl you expected it to be with Pillman able to insert some comedic spots into the match.  In the end, karma came back to haunt Goldust for what happened at SummerSlam in what turned out to be Pillman's last PPV performance.
IYH: Ground Zero '97

vs. WCW Light-Heavyweight Champion Jushin Liger - Probably the most famous match in Pillman's career as this was the top light-heavyweights from Japan & America fighting in a rematch from their non-televised encounter months earlier when Liger won the championship.  Pillman did more matwrestling early while Liger used his aerial offense of dropkicks & moonsaults off the top rope both in & out of the ring.  When Brian started to pull of his ""Air Pillman"" offense with his flying clothesline & cross bodyblock, Liger tried to ground Pillman by working over his legs with moves like the figure four.  This was without a doubt one of the greatest matches in WCW's history when it came to crusierweight/light-heavyweight action.  Look out for such moments like Liger executing his ""Liger Bomb"", Pillman executing an impactful DDT, and one hell of a suplex by Liger.
WCW SuperBrawl II '92

In all, Brian Pillman is a forgotten name that should be remembered in this business & this DVD was a classic tribute to his career. I highly recommend.",1162684800,2,12945,4.653964082347788
2610691,4,B000GG4XWY,"As a fan who unfortunately started watching wrestling after the death of Brian Pillman, I really wanted to see this dvd. This two disk set comes with an hour and a half long documentary on one of the most outrageous wrestlers in history, Brian Pillman.

The documentary starts off with Brian's tough childhood and the explanation of where he got his deep voice. It goes on to talk about his football career as well as when he got started in Stampede Wrestling in Canada under the legendary Hart Family. From there it shows his early WCW days as ""Flyin Brian"" and how he earned that name. It also goes into detail on how he teamed with Steve Austin to form the tag team ""The Hollywood Blondes,"" becoming a member of the Four Horsemen, as well as rare footage of his ECW debut [which is awesome to see and funny as hell.]

It then goes on to show his near fatal car crash and how he was never the same when it came to in ring effort because of his injured foot and ankle. Not long after Brian signed with WWE and that was where his unpredictable character really started to form. It was also where he became a member of the legendary Hart Foundation, and how he formed the XXX files with Goldust's real life wife, Marlena. This is a great documentary on the life and career of Brian Pillman and the extras are great as well.

Extra Matches on Disk One:

Calgary Stampede Wrestling
International Tag Team Championships
Bad Company vs. The Midnight Cowboys [This was an okay match just to show Brian's high flying work which was rare back then. Some good tag team action but it wasn't a classic match. 8/10]

WCW Halloween Havoc 89
US Championship
Brian Pillman vs. Lex Luger [This was a good match. The strength and power of Luger met the high flying ability of Pillman. Some great back and forth action including a funny spot where Luger gets out of the ring and gets chased around by Pillman. Luger retains his title, but great match. 9/10]

NWA Tag Team Championship:
Brian Pillman and Tom Zenk vs. The Fabulous Freebirds [This was another tag team that mostly showed Brian's high flying work. The legendary Terry Funk is on the announcing team, which is a rare treat. Good match. 7.5/10]

Extra Matches on Disk 2:

WCW WrestleWar 91
Brian Pillman, Sting, and The Steiners vs. The Four Horsemen [The thing about this match is that it has two rings side by side and a giant cage with a roof over both of them! Practically everyone gets busted open and The Horsemen win after Pillman gets dropped on his neck and can't continue. 9/10]

WCW Halloween Havoc 91
World Light-Heavyweight Championship
Brian Pillman vs. Richard Morton [Good match as both men were pretty even throughout the entire match. Crowd was solidly behind Pillman, but a few chants for Morton. In the end Pillman gets the pin and becomes the Light-Heavyweight Champion for the first time in his career. 8.5/10]

WCW Clash of the Champions 91
""Loser Leaves Town"" Match
Brian Pillman and El Gigante vs. Barry Windham and Arn Anderson [Pretty good tag team match that just basically showed some good back and forth action. Pillman even climbs on top of the shoulders of El Gigante and dives off onto Anderson in a great spot. 7/10]

WCW Slamboree 93
Hollywood Blondes vs. Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas [Another match they don't tell you that takes place in a steel cage. Steamboat and Douglas were dressed in masks so you couldn't tell who was who for most of the match. A lot of back and forth action with the cage being used as guys were flung into the sides of it left and right. Steamboat at one point climbs the top of the cage and gives a HUGE cross-body to both the Hollywood Blondes at one point. However Steve Austin and Brian Pillman get the win. 9/10]

WCW Nitro 95
Brian Pillman vs. Jushin Thunder Liger [Great match between two of the best high flyers ever; both men flying inside the ring, outside, and a lot of great chain wrestling mixed in. 9/10 [A match worthy of seeing again and again.]]

WCW Nitro 96
Brian Pillman vs. Dean Malenko [Good technical battle as, ""The Man of a Thousand Holds,"" Dean Malenko, met Brian Pillman. Some good action and Brian Pillman gets the win even though Malenko's feet were on the bottom rope. 8/10]

WCW Clash of the Champions 96
Brian Pillman vs. Eddie Guerrero [This was the match where Brian got under Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan's skin and Heenan flipped out. The match was okay but way too short for such talented wrestlers. 7.5/10]

WWE Raw 97
Brian Pillman vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin [Wild brawl that had all members of the Hart Foundation handcuffed to each ring post. Back and forth action that even had a chair spot and steel steps that were used. In the end all members of the Hart Foundation get out of their cuffs and start to beat up Austin, which led to LOD, Ken Shamrock, and Goldust to come out and break things up. 8.5/10]

WWE In Your House Canadian Stampede 97
The Hart Foundation vs. Steve Austin, LOD, Goldust, and Ken Shamrock [Wild fight that had the entire Canadian audience cheering for the Hart Foundation. Halfway through the match Steve Austin took out Owen Hart's leg with a chair and Owen had to go to the back. Then Bret took out Austin's leg and Austin had to go to the back. Both Owen and Austin later make returns and the fight continues. The ending occurs when Bret and Owen's family that were sitting at ringside jump the guardrail and start fighting Austin. Owen gets the pin to win the match. 8.5/10]

This is a really well done video of one of the most interesting characters to ever perform in WCW, ECW, and the WWE. Highly recommended.",1162080000,7,6387,4.612874779541446
2610692,5,B000GG4XWY,"Brian Pillman was one of my favorite wrestlers since I first saw him in 1991 on WCW Pro(I think it was called).  He was still the high flying fan favorite then and was about to win the new WCW Cruserweight championship.  Little did I know what was in store for this man nor what he had already done in his life.  I won't recap all of that, the dvd does that just fine.

Disc 1 is a great overview.  To be honest, the reverence in which I hold Brian had me very scared that they would drop the ball on this dvd.  This was not the case.  We have interviews from Brian's family, friends, children and his widow.  We also have new interviews with many superstars who came up with Brian.  The extra matches and promos are very cool and offer great bonuses to a man who created a character way ahead of its time.  The matches are some of Brian's best or at the very least show him at a particular time frame.  Ending the DVD with the epic Liger vs Pillman match from SuperBrawl 2 shows that there was a lot of actual thought put into this dvd.  That match set a high benchmark of greatness on that card and for high flying matches to come.

One thing I would have like to have seen more of on here is more promos.  ALl the ECW promos would have been fantastic in their entirety.  I mean, Pillman wrestling a pencil, being ""stripped"" of his constitutional rights, the incident onthe first night at the ECW arena.  And how about more of the Loose Cannon/Ticking time bomb stuff from WCW and WWE(F).  The prayer for Bret he lead in the ring with Owen and Davey Boy comes to mind as a classic Pillman moment.  It always seemed so ironic to me that Brian died right before the whole ""Attitude"" era really took off.  He would have fit in so well.  He had already been doing it for years prior.

I reccomend this DVD to any wrestling fan.  In his own way Brian is too often forgotten about and this tribute is a great way to introduce people to this unique and courageous man.",1161129600,14,1963,4.220430107526882
2610693,5,B000GG4XWY,"I saw Pillman wrestle a few months before his dead, too bad I cant remember how the match went. The bio on Pillman was sad. He was a great star turn into a shell of himself after his accident. Also, his matches are short on this set but Pillman puts on a hell of a show in a few short minutes. The matches were great considering they featured early WCW cage matches that ive always wanted to see. A few funny things about the set is the back of the dvd says more then 15 matches, there is 16 in all. Anther is Dustin Runnels is interviewed and the capation says former WWE star Golddust. Well its nice to know that he retired by watching this. Great dvd and a excellent buy. Next up, Roddy Pipper dvd!",1159315200,,701,4.124087591240876
2610694,4,B000GG4XWY,"The documentary was really, really good.  They left some stuff out of it, of course, but you know why they did so it sort of makes sense.  One thing I did not remember was the prodigious mullet Brian sported back in the day.  Man, I think that thing was more impressive than Jagr's Cup-winning mullet of the early-90s!

I don't know that I learned anything new from the documentary, but seeing his kids and his sisters talk about him was amazing.  Also, Stone Cold talking about the Hollywood Blonds tag team was great fun.

They really played up the Flyin' Brian stuff as being ahead of it's time (which it was) and the Loose Cannon character that had everyone guessing.  Funny thing is that the whole Loose Cannon thing wasn't really long-lasting if you think about it.  The gimmick was the talk of all three companies at the time but it really only lasted the summer before his Humvee accident brought any momentum he had to a standstill.

The accident was glossed over--he was loaded on painkeelers and told of seeing his ex-girlfriend's face in his rearview mirror when he crashed--but the fact that it totally derailed his character was not.  He knew that he could have been the biggest thing going and that he had blown the whole deal and it depressed the heck out of him.

Anyhoo, the official coroner's report was that he had a heart attack; just as his dad had at a young age. Of course, the fact that the juice and the vikes and a crazy lifestyle put take a toll on the heart was glossed over.  I mean, the WWE is not going to ever admit that the lifestyle of a (ahem) ""sports entertainer"" is one that is insane because no one can prove whether the job makes you crazy or if that crazy people are attracted to the job.  It's the whole chicken-or-the-egg argument on a human scale.  The truth is that he was an overachiever who liked to prove people wrong and when his body failed him, he became depressed and quickly descended into a spiral that ultimately did him in.

Best parts were reliving the Hollywood Blonds stuff.  I remember watching it back in the day and knowing that he and Steve were going to be huge stars.  Steve even talks about how the team got over really quickly and that the plug was pulled by a booker who was worried about protecting his spot in WCW.  They never name the booker but I am 90% sure that it was Ric Flair back then who headed the booking committee.  I am also 80% sure that Arn was on the committee too.  They must have felt threatened by the Flare For The Old skit that set up a 2 out of 3 falls match for a TBS special in (I am guessing) 1992 or 1993.  Great stuff though; and Brian came up with the whole gimmick.  They were so hilarious together.

Another great part was Jim Ross talking about how he believed that he had become a father-figure to Brian in the WWF.  That was sad stuff.  JR really had a hard time trying to help Brian but Pillman only saw the fact that JR order him to be drug tested as a huge betrayal.

Overall, I am going with 4 crutches out of 5.  I haven't watched any of the matches as yet but I am less interested in that kind of thing than I am the documentaries.",1159315200,6,3140,4.295918367346939
2610695,3,B000GG4XWY,"First I want to get the negative aspects about this release out of the way.

The WWE has done it again! Jesse Ventura's commentary has been cut from arguably

Pillman's greatest match, the match from SuperBrawl II between Pillman and Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger.

For those that don't know the story, the WWE will edit out Jesse Ventura's commentary from matches

if they can, because in the 90s, Ventura successfully sued the WWE over back pay for his commentary

on old WWE vhs tapes. So, to get even (and save a buck) Vince will cut Ventura's commentary at every

chance he can, or exclude matches from DVD sets all together that contain commentary from Ventura.

Ever wonder why the Vader vs Flair match from Starrcade '94 was left off of Flair's DVD set? Ventura was

on commentary. Why did the matches on ""The Greatest Wrestling Stars From the 80s"" DVD set suck so bad?

Because Ventura did commentary on most of the better matches from that era, so they left them off. Plus, Ventura's commentary was cut from recent releases like: the Jake Roberts DVD and the Dusty Rhodes DVD.

The WWE only agrees to pay Ventura when it's absolutely necessary, like on the WrestleMania Anthology or The History of the WWE Championship.

This has to stop! Vince swallow your pride, do what's right and pay Ventura for use of his commentary. To edit what many believe to be Brian Pillman's greatest match is an insult to the fans and Pillman's memory. I know WWE is a publicly traded company, and they need to cut costs, but don't butcher history like this!

What's funny about this editing, is that they didn't even cut all of Ventura's commentary out!!!!!

Jesse, if you read this, sue the WWE again! Your voice is on this DVD release! During the Pillman vs Liger match from SuperBrawl, they failed to edit out where Ventura cries out ""Uh-oh!"". Get your money Jesse!

Now, with that out of the way, here's my review of the DVD....

This release is bitter sweet. Brian Pillman is a tragic figure in wrestling history. He had fought so hard to become the talk of the wrestling world and when he achieved it, the rug was pulled out from under him by a cruel twist of fate in a near fatal car accident. No joke, I was a fan back then and every wrestling fan, every promotion and the internet was talking about Pillman. If the accident had never happened, Pillman probably would have been the centerpiece of the Attitude era instead of Steve Austin, he was that hot. However, once he came back, and he returned too soon, he had lost all of his momentum and never reclaimed it. When he finally started taking off in WWE, with the assistant gimmick with the red hot Marlena, he died.

The documentary is very well done, and it reminded me of a lot of Loose Cannon moments I had forgot about. However, as with all WWE documentaries, history is re-written and/or people are protected from criticism. For example, Steve Austin and Jim Ross really place a lot of blame on the WCW booker who broke up the Hollywood Blondes when they were red hot, while never naming who was responsible for the decision. Well, that was Ric Flair. Another moment they tried to smooth over was to have Dusty Rhodes talk about how much he believed in Pillman and Austin. What?! Dusty held back Austin and NEVER believed he was anymore than a mid-card act, and he never gave Pillman any important role when he was booking! One sad moment on the DVD was to see Jim Ross, who I respect a great deal, try to down play Pillman's painkiller use by saying he died from a heart attack, as if to say the pills had no affect on Pillman, when we all know it was the abuse of the painkillers that lead to his heart attack. The same thing killed Eddie Guerrero, Louie Spicolli and tons more. So, you have to stomach moments like that.

On the upside, there are some great stories about Pillman on this DVD from friends and family. You'll learn what caused his voice to sound the way it did, his near death experiences early in his life, his remarkable football career and tons more. All the Loose Cannon moments are here, from the time he freaked out Bobby Heenan on live tv, fallout with WCW, his legendary appearances in ECW, his membership in the Hart Foundation to his controversial home videos with Marlena - they even show the memorable Marlena upskirt from Raw when she was forced to assist Pillman!

As for the matches, I already talked about the Liger match, but they also include the match between Pillman and Liger from the first episode of Nitro. Another classic match, making it's DVD debut, is the Hart Foundation vs Steve Austin's team from the Canadian Stampede from WWE In Your House '97. This is an amazing match that is worth the price of the DVD alone! You'll also see Pillman in a War Games match against the 4 Horseman where Sid Viscous nearly breaks Pillman's neck! You'll also see a rare ""Thundercage"" tag match pitting Pillman, Sting & Dustin Rhodes against Paul Orndorff, Steve Austin & Rick Rude. The Thundercage was a precursor to the Hell in a Cell, it just didn't have a roof. Plus there's a lot more. Unfortunately, there's only one Hollywood Blondes match, but it's one of their best, and you only get to see Pillman's ECW work during the documentary, but beyond that, it's hard to argue with the match choices on this DVD.

A must buy for any wrestling fan in general. You're going to be treated to one of the most unique careers in the history of the business.",1159228800,7,5436,4.539877300613497
