8614230,4,B00FBSGE2O,New in wrapper awesome quality...we love this series and it is worth having it all on disc. Great gift for any fan,1387670400,,114,4.2272727272727275
8614231,5,B00FBSGE2O,"Even the ones made back in '99 I still often find side-splitting. Like the 3-Stooges, Carol Burnett or Bill Cosby, good comedy has no era, and a show of this quality should have been on, and stayed on, as long as the Simpsons, which is made by the same folks. Hopefully, it'll be resurrected a third time. My only disappointment was that that I thought that this was all of them, I didn't realize there was actually eight (8), so the very last season is missing. However, I will complete this set as soon as it's available. It is cerebral, written by guys/gals holding Master's degrees and Ph. D's (you'd never think such folk had funny bones) so, it doesn't play to the lowest common denominator. BUT, that's what makes it high quality and puts hundreds of zingers in that anyone with a mind will find hysterical. One thing I can note, is that with DVD copies (all played well, btw) you can slow freeze the frames and catch all that stuff they put in the background, which are also quite funny, but usually play too fast on a regular run. As a last note, I think I will always smile with a slight chuckle whenever I hear ""Good news, everybody!"".  Enjoy!",1385769600,,1154,4.443396226415095
8614232,4,B00FBSGE2O,"Absolutely LOVE Futurama as a series, although I probably haven't seen any of the episodes since pre-season 5... So I was more than excited when this deal came up... I was hoping they'd be plastic cases like every other Fox series has come in but nope... It's a thick card stock... The cases themselves are sturdy, short of being sat on, or stomped on, they'll hold up nicely when taken care of...

My one complaint is that the disks themselves are placed into pockets within the card stock which means that just from packaging and shipping there are some minor scratches that I'm hoping haven't resulted in skipping... Have to watch and update this later to confirm or disprove skips!

Other than Fox's mediocrity with the re-release packaging this is overall a GREAT value.. :)",1381795200,2,779,4.762962962962963
8614233,5,B00FBSGE2O,"I am a bit biased here, because I have been in love with Futurama from the beginning. So I will only give a quick briefing of the show itself saying this: It is a humorous parody of sci-fi and 50's conventional ideas of the future, written by the man who gave you the Simpsons, and in my personal opinion, a better overall story/TV show. If you haven't seen Futurama, you really really should.

As for this specific product, it includes Volumes 1-7 of the DVD's which as of this writing, is all but the most recent (and last) season (Volume 8 won't come out til December). Unlike the Bender head collection, this set is just a compilation of all the regular DVD cases, rather than a special iteration of seasons.

There are a couple things you should know before buying this set:

1- It does not include the 4 ""movies"" that comprised of Season 5 on TV - these movies are sold individually, sadly enough.
2 - The cases are made of cardboard/paper, and although they are beautiful and look great, they aren't nearly as solid as a plastic DVD case (one of the volumes came a bit like someone had lightly punched it in the box, but it was easily adjusted and looks fine).

If you love Futurama and don't need a fancy edition or plastic cases, I highly recommend getting this set. It's a decent bang for your buck, and Amazon will often put it on a Daily Deal for an even better purchase.",1381708800,,1383,4.390625
8614234,4,B00FBSGE2O,"The only negative is when I received the package, some CDs were ""walking"", they had a few scratches. Whatever, everything else is perfect.",1381708800,,138,5.043478260869565
8614235,5,B00FBSGE2O,"Well I haven't watched them yet, but I got them all in great condition as far as I can tell...Ok I went home and watched alot of them...no scratches or skips works great!! Totally worth the money!!!",1381449600,,198,4.378378378378378
