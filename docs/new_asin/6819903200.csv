As for the drama itself, loved it! This one and Healer are my two favourites.
I also like W: Two Worlds Apart (although very unbelieveable, somewhat predictable and sometimes just annoying)
and Kill Me: Heal Me (more of a fluffy drama).

This drama is totally worth it and a great introduction to kdrama for family members and friends.
However, I forgot about the ending....

*Spoiler Alert!!!*
