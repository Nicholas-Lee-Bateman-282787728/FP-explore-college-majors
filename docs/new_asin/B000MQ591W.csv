8170704,5,B000MQ591W,My 2 year old son loved this dvd. He dance with the music. It is a good dvd for toddler.recommend this to everybody!,1384387200,,116,4.086956521739131
8170705,5,B000MQ591W,"I bought this DVD and the 3 others in the same series about 3 years ago when my kids were younger. They loved them right away and they still watch and love them now (they're 4 and 5 now). So I bought a second set for one of my friends who just had a baby. Each DVD features 3 little stories, 15 minutes each so you can decide to let them watch as little as 15 minutes or as much as 45 minutes, according to their age or attention span. The DVDs mix real footage of animals and nature settings with animation, and it's very well made. It finds the right balance between entertainment and education, and it's totally age-appropriate; you don't have to stand guard with the remote in hand ready to fast-forward through some (even if very slightly) scary or inappropriate part that I still find regularly in many of the classic kid's DVDs.",1322870400,,835,4.358974358974359
