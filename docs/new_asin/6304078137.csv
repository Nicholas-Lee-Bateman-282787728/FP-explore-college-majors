780598,5,6304078137,"The movie:

The only reason I watched this movie was because Al Pacino is in it.  I'm glad that he's in it, because if he weren't, I would've missed out on a wonderful movie.  On a hot summer day during the depression in Philadelphia, a 12 year-old Italian boy (Genarro) tries to earn enough money (two bits, or a quarter) to go to a brand new, air-cooled, colorful, magical movie theater (La Paloma).  In the process, Genarro learns about life, thanks to the people he encounters throughout the day, and especially his dying grandfather--who has a lifetime of wisdom to teach Genarro in a short amount of time.
----------

The dvd:
Video:  The movie is widescreen in both the 2002 and 2011 versions.  Some scenes are very dark, and some are colorful.  The picture is pretty soft.

Audio:  I bought the 2011 version, and was disappointed to find out that it has no closed-captions or subtitles.  The dialogue is muffled, and there are words I've never heard before (like ""yerkees"") so subtitles would have been very helpful.  I then bought the 2002 version, which thankfully has closed-captions.
-----------

Bottom line:

The movie is available on both Netflix and Hulu, and I recommend that you watch it.  It's a well-acted feel-good nostalgic movie with a great message (never give up on your dreams) and it's got Al Pacino.  There is a conversation dealing with virginity, and there are a few disturbing scenes (such as a funeral scene, a scene where a woman tries to seduce a boy, and a scene where a woman hangs herself), but for the most part, ""Two Bits"" is a clean movie.

If you choose to buy the movie, be sure to buy the 2002 version, because it has closed-captions; which will make up for the muffled dialogue.",1330992000,,1722,4.667774086378738
780599,5,6304078137,This is a ''priceless treasure'' of a movie.  I sent this precious movie to my sister in California so that she could enjoy it as much as I have.  They just don't make movies of this quality very often.  It's a movie I will NEVER tire of and I consider it a classic.  I have always loved the work of Al Pacino but this is truly a ''sleeper'' that many people don't even know about. It really is about a ''legacy of love'' that a grandfather leaves for his grandson and would touch anyone's heart.,1261008000,3,496,4.189473684210526
780600,4,6304078137,"Here is a nice, low-key film which features appealing storytelling. There are no good guys vs. bad guys, no action, no blood, no sex: just a story of a day back in the Depression era in South Philadelphia.  It also looks very good on this widescreen DVD.

The story centers around a young boy ""Gennero"" (Jerry Barone) trying to raise ""two bits"" (25 cents) to see a movie. It features his dying grandfather, played nicely by Al Pacino. Along the way the 12-year-old encounters interesting people and events.

Some have criticized Pacino for taking this role. I guess they want him to be a cop in every film. Well, he's a great actor and shows his diversified talents well in here. Whatever.....this film is loaded with charm and a nice story that's like a good book: hard to put down once you start.

At 84 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome, either. Even though there is little profanity, I'm not sure I would recommend this as family fare because the film touches on a sexually-disturbing doctor and his wife.",1245110400,4,1016,4.659217877094972
780601,5,6304078137,"You rarely ever come across such films, and those films which are very rare to see or hear are the best ones. I am a fan of Al Pacino and I was really very happy to see him in a totally different role. A heartwarming, excellent performence by Pacino. So was Jerry Barrone who played the role of Pacino's grandson. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio did her part very well indeed. A very interesting film, a heartwarming drama that will touch your heart, specially the wonderfull chemistry between the grandfather and his grandson and the beautifull Scenario of Italy in the 1930's. The film will make you smile and shed tears too. A film you would love to see on a calm and quiet afternoon or on a rainy day. If you like intense films, good drama, this is a must for your collection.",1207958400,11,776,4.471830985915493

Pacino has small part his role has much impact. I tried to tell
a friend what this movie was about and my eyes started to well up.  Coming from a close Italian family, this touched my heart.
This movies supplies us with excellent performances sprinkled with a heartwarming story.  Watch this on a Sunday evening you
will be better off that you did",1044489600,8,410,4.453333333333333
780727,3,6304078137,"""Two Bits"" (1995) is directed by James Foley (Glengarry Glen Ross, Perfect Stranger). This gentle film that takes place in the Recession during 1933 is about a boy who is trying to raise two bits (a quarter) so that he can see a movie in the new movie theatre that is being advertised in the neighbourhood. His grandfather (Al Pacino) offers to give his grandson the quarter, but only if he dies. The boy decides that he can't wait for however long that might take so he takes matters into his own hands and tries to earn the money from various sources. Along the way we meet various individuals from the boy's neighbourhood. This idyllic film, seen from a child's point of view, portrays life as if it were a marvellous carnival, even in a time when people had little money, when the opening of a new movie theatre could enchant a child.",1397865600,3,838,4.483660130718954
780728,5,6304078137,"This film is a touching coming-of-age drama set in 1930s Philadelphia, being based on a memoir of that time period. Alec Baldwin provides the thoughtful narration framing this tale of a young boy searching for an elusive 25 cents to see a show at the brand-new movie palace opening in his neighborhood. But this little independent film is far more involving in its execution than this generic summary suggests. The boy lives with his single mom (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and ailing grandfather (Al Pacino) in an Italian-American immigrant family and his adventures in pursuing the money are as entertaining as they are episodic. What sets this film apart is the pitch-perfect depth of emotion in the relationships between characters. Rather than being a postmodern caricature of this time period, or descending into cartoonish humor as American movies often do when depicting immigrant families, the film depicts this particular family in such a realistic heartfelt way that it feels like you're looking in on your own relatives. In particular, it reminds you of the love that a grandfather can share with his grandchildren, and how important that relationship (quickly fading in our modern culture) can be in the life of a young child. The film's style is sincere and uplifting without being forced, mature without being prurient, and deeply moving without being melodramatic. Pacino gives an understated and authentic performance as the Italian immigrant grandfather that is rare compared to some of his more scenery-chewing roles. Mastrantonio makes a quiet, caring, and passionate mother to young Jerry Barone who plays the lead character to perfection. I don't know how widely this film was released in 1995, or why it's been forgotten, but I highly recommend it to anyone who likes good drama.",1384387200,2,1803,5.1993127147766325

780734,1,6304078137,"I would say without a doubt the most inept and lamest movie I have ever had the displeasure of seeing in my enitire life.  The script was appalling and the actor who called himself ""Al Pacino"" was a far cry from the genuine article although he did look a lot like him. In a few words ""absolute trash"".",1365206400,3,301,4.189655172413793

7861753,1,6304078137,"I saw part of this movie and watched the rest today, only to find out Mary and Al Pacino sold themselves out to make this movie. They must have needed the money or know someone who had something to do with making the movie and they certainly needed these great actors like these two  to pull it off as tt's during the depression..
I feel like throwing-up now and am just disgusted. I would never-ever want a child to see 2-Bits unless unllss your raising a murderer  I'm also wondering if this movie is about can-ni-bal-ism suggest saving your money and purchasing The Cinderella Man.  It'd a true story about a boxer returning to professional boxing.  Both movie happen in the 1930 era.",1428624000,,687,4.560975609756097
