I contacted the seller and they were very helpful and understanding, so as I recall I was credited the amount of my sale or it was not charged, but as it was a while back I do not recall which it was. I had no intention of writing a review on this item having never viewed it ut apparently Amazon is persistent and wants reviews.",1382400000,,432,3.9655172413793105
