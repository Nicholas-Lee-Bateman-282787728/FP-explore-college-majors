8248655,1,B0012Z366M,"lmao... the car doesnt kill anyone.. it only gets recognized by a few people.. plot was horrible..but i gotta get one of those guns, they never run out of bullets!! No real nudity to keep you interested, just a couple of boob shots (about a minutes worth of ""female flesh"") 500 thumbs down!!",1452729600,,291,4.509433962264151
8248656,5,B0012Z366M,Was expecting a mow down pedestrians movie but completely different In  French and has subtitles which actually enhance the action - really strange but in a good way excellent buildup to  reveal the plot,1425772800,,203,4.9411764705882355

8248659,4,B0012Z366M,"I liked the first two thirds of this oddly sexy revenge thriller best because I had very little idea what was driving our lovely assassin. Once I found out her back story I was like, Huh. That's not as interesting as I thought. But it's worth seeing. Never seen another quite like it.",1415577600,,284,4.377358490566038
8248660,5,B0012Z366M,"Jean Rollin's KILLING CAR stars Tiki Tsang as one of the most enigmatic, eerily seductive characters in any film. She also happens to be ruthless, relentless, and lethal! After murdering a man in order to steal a car, Tiki is shot at by the man's girlfriend. This opening junkyard scene leads into a fast, desperate foot-chase through a carnival, featuring Tiki engaging hookers in a running gun-battle! In the end, Tiki gets the car. She's on a mission, and the bodies are piling up! Two more in a farmhouse die by her hand(gun). Why is she doing this? What have these people done to her? When one of her victims asks, ""Who are you?"", her reply is, ""I am not."" Ms. Tsang gives off a sense of exotic, forbidden danger like no one since Tura Satana! We know that anyone who comes in contact w/ her is doomed! The police are suitably baffled, finding a toy car left at each murder scene. KILLING CAR is a fantastic revenge film. It's also a Rollin film, so expect plenty of female nudity. There are many classic scenes, like the barn fight (scythe vs. pitchfork!), photo-shoot, and art-dealers sequences. This is Tiki Tsang's movie, and she carries it all the way...",1372896000,,1164,4.600961538461538
8248661,4,B0012Z366M,"I enjoy French movies because they are so different from the typical American movies.  This was no different.  I am still trying to figure out the ending, which is typical with French flicks.  Yes, it could certainly have been better and yes it was dark (in more ways than one), but it kept me intrigued throughout.",1368921600,,315,4.589285714285714
8248662,3,B0012Z366M,"As a Jean Rollin fan (for the most part) I have to say I was bored by this film from start to finish. This type of flick, along with the horrid 'Sidewalks Of Bangkok', are simply not his forte - he`s good at the dreamy, surreal, hypnotic mythos of vampire lore, the waking dead, occult and Eurocult tidbits that aren`t plot or narrative driven. His attempt at an action flick misses the mark completely. He can't seem to use the low-budget to his benefit in this one, it`s poorly lit, badly paced, weak on action and there`s only one Asian woman in the flick undraped, and not nearly often enough for a Rollin film. Skip this one and grab 'The Living Dead Girl', 'Night Of The Hunted' or 'Fascination' from the same time period and you`ll see what I mean. 'Killing Car' means killing time...",1274227200,4,791,4.462068965517242
8248663,5,B0012Z366M,"This is a great film among the best of some of Mr. Rollin's! It is more or less a comeback to the horror/exploitive/beautiful women actor movies that he loved to make, before the pornography/graphic sexuality revolution, changed the face of French cinema.  I would suggest that you would watch  this film, for some of his tale-tale and takes on the time during he shot this, as this film for such a low-budget type, is really a great expressive movie, but done so stylishly[as the French can do with with their version and interpretation of!], the film actually comes out as ""Noir"" and the French integration of many more of the ""ethnics"" that do live in, and contribute greatly to France, but hardly get any recognition of, do make this film more unusual, of this and the type of cinematography, that France and Europe does put out. The film starts out with twist on the formula of revenge/mysterious killer, and as it progresses you can see the stylish ways, it takes twists and some turns and ending that is a bit surprising as to the heroine/anti-heroine in the film. It starts out like a common revenge film, only to end up something more then art and  viewer interpretations on the whole film and ending. The film is much more easy to view, and a more cognizant story line and actual logic to the movie, then say Jess Franco's exploitive films!

It does show with some class[thought definitely low-budget looking!] what can be done with some thought and ingenuity and vision, which Mr. Rollin seems to have in abundance! I especially did like the interviews and stars in some of Jean's films on this DVD! As for this film in his collection, i would give it a 4-5 stars, as it is not too lurid with nudity and disconnected/disorganized story line as some of his other films i have seen can be...but a true original idea and with such a multi-faceted cast! I really like this type of ""Revenge Noir"", but my only disappointment to this film, as it is too dark in places, and why does even France, look always so gloomy and drab in so many of his films, even when there is sufficient lighting?

I do hope this small , rambling review helps others with the decision to purchase or even rent this film, as it will find itself on my shelve and for review many times to come!",1264809600,8,2273,4.534146341463415
