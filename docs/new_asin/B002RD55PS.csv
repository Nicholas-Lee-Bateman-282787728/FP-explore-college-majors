3973601,4,B002RD55PS,"3.5 stars

Like so many tv shows, this one was at its best in the early stages. I loved the first few seasons but then it started getting a little stale, and the first movie was the weakest link. This one is somewhat better than that, but still a long way from the almost non-stop hilarity of the series' start.

Some of the better characters aren't here, Barb among them, the jokes are fewer and thinner, and above all the plot is just not that hot. The boys are up to hijinks as always, only now those are more serious and less funny. The bank robbery is okay but goes on far too long and just didn't make us laugh much. The same could be said of much of this. There's also too much Julian and not enough Ricky for my taste. Julian can't compare to Ricky for humor value; no idea why he gets so much time here and the real TPB star gets so little.

In fact, I laughed more at the 34 minutes of deleted scenes than at the whole movie, solely due to the preponderance of Ricky. There's a bunch of great bits featuring him that were deleted but shouldn't have been; they would have been the highlights, especially Ricky's talking his way out of the liquor store robbery. I've no idea why those were excised, as they were classic. But your editor needs changing when the best part of the dvd is the deleted scenes...

All in all, I'd love to jump on the bandwagon and say that everything these guys do is magic, but it no longer is. The freshness of the early shows is missing here, and it just feels like an overlong tv movie with an ok script. You can almost see them thinking of gags to pull here, but the inspiration is gone. Lahey has his moments, but there's too much of him here. Even Bubbles wears after a while; the cats subplot is almost bereft of humor, and the Bubbles ""love interest"" side story is just tired.

But, this probably-not-the-last-TPB-episode does have some funny bits, and these guys are so good-natured it's hard to not like anything they do. Yet that's what's really missing for me here: the good-natured fun of the shows. It's all a little bit too serious and heavy, even when it's trying to be funny. Enough with the armed robberies. Give the boys an inheritance! Let them catch a break! Going back to jail just ain't that funny.

If the TPB make another flick, I sure hope they regain some of the spontaneity and goofiness of the first season.",1268697600,3,2372,4.343115124153499
3973602,5,B002RD55PS,"I won't over-analyze this: it's Trailer Park Boys movie and it's awesome.

The first Trailer Park Boys movie was definitely a ""Canada Meets Ivan Reitman"" production -- glossy, more boob jokes -- but this one is like a whole season of the TV show crammed into a single movie.  It's beyond amazing how many times these guys can tell more or less the same story and have it be so damn funny.  This was a PERFECT movie if you're a fan of the TV show.",1267488000,,446,4.223529411764706
3973603,5,B002RD55PS,"trailer park boys is one of those shows that you either love or hate. i LOVE them! ricky, julian, and bubbles are always funny and they have great chemistry. the supporting cast is important for the story lines, but the boys always steal the show. i watched one episode on tv and i immediately got on amazon to get more. i was overjoyed that there were 7 complete seasons to be had. of course i ordered them and then i began a quest to acquire every tpb dvd available. i spent hours reading background and finding out about canadian culture so i could get all the jokes. in particular, i found out about the hypnotist, peter reveen, the source of a lot of ricky jokes. i love the rickyisms and bubbles' constant efforts to keep everyone out of trouble. Julian is the sexiest man alive and i would love to be his bartender! if you love tpbs, you need to get this latest release. you won't be disappointed!",1267315200,,904,4.386904761904762
3973604,4,B002RD55PS,"The tag line prety much sums it up, and like the funniest of jokes, it is so true. Ok so most of us haven't robbed a bank, but you've thought about it haven't you?
The boys are back, out of jail and wasting no time in resuming thier criminal careers. They quickly come up against a sober Jim Lahey and a home in shambles.
Always the entrepeneur, Julian comes up with a plan to put them on easy street, and the hijinks ensue. You have to admire thier tenacity at avioding ""real"" jobs.
Missing in action are the faithfull scapegoats Corey and Trevor, and the star cameo's from the previous film.
A fun ride, from the people who put ""real"" in reality TV.",1266710400,4,651,4.300813008130081

3973606,4,B002RD55PS,"This movie is the last of a fine series that will be missed!!! good movie, very funny! We neeed more trailer park boys in the u.s.a.!!!!!",1265155200,,137,4.3076923076923075
3973607,4,B002RD55PS,"It's hard to say bad things about the boys in Canada's beloved pseudo-reality TV series, which ran 7 seasons, not counting the one-off ""Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys"" episode, which preceded this movie chronologically and plot-wise.  There was also an Ivan Reitman-produced Trailer Park Boys Movie in 2008 (which didn't quite live up to the madness of the TV episodes).

Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles get out of prison and attempt once again, to stay out of prison.  To their dismay, times have changed, and Sunnyvale has pretty much been abandoned.  Bubbles's kitties are missing, and Lahey is now really off the bottle, swindling his ex-wife Barb out of property and using that deal to create the Lahey Luxury Estates.  Unfortunately, the new property's main sewer runs underneath Julian's old trailer, so Lahey now has to plot to obtain  Julian's land to complete his new utopia.

How is this movie different from the other brilliant Trailer Park Boys TV installments?  Sarah Byrne, who was responsible for on-the-fly editing style, creating the comic timing of the earlier TV episode returns here.  Blain Morris, who composed for the iconic TV theme,  scores an understated soundtrack, inserting vintage country and western pieces when necessary, creating some gorgeous vistas alongside Ted McInnes cinematography.  Rob Well's Ricky actually shines in some of his more serious - albeit deadpan - moments.  The ""battery charger advice scene"" had me laughing out loud, rolling on the floor in it's sobriety: you can't jump start a dead car battery by hooking it up to your own dead battery!  And the ""No. 1"" Car Chase Scene of all time is worth the price of ticket admission alone, as the characters duel it out with a urinary swordfight in a high speed chase through downtown Halifax, Nova Scotia.

 I think Countdown to Liquor Day is a Love Letter to all TPB fans.  It shows that the boys are symbolically forced to ""return"" to something that is no longer there anymore.  The sense of wonder and enchantment with the real trailers in the backdrop when the camera used to follow Bubbles in his go-cart, has now been replaced by repetitive pre-fab trailers with no distinction from one to another.  Mike Smith's own Bubbles seems more like a forced caricature of Bubbles than the fresh, innocent, kitty-loving compassionate, pacific guy who won our hearts over in the film short ""The Cart Boy"" that started it all, some ten years ago.  The other guys - J-Roc, T, Julian, seems growingly impatient with the impending typecast of their roles.  The comedy in the earlier versions comes from a certain innocence of the boys thinking they will succeed, even when we know they can't.  ""Countdown"" has a darker, more pessimistic tone:  the boys seem to realize they are more apt to fail, and along with that comes a meaner, angrier streak.  Where they use to look out for each other in the tight-knit trailer park community, the ethos seems to lean more towards ""looking out for No. 1.""  Phrases like ""I'm not sure what success is, but I'm pretty sure it's not this,"" ""I'm not feeling it anymore"" may be read a number of ways.  The boys pleading the film crew to stop filming them in the future is another Easter Egg in plain sight.

Sam ""Caveman"" Losco, Jacob and the Mustard Tiger, the original TV-Cyrus, and George Green, Barrie Dunn all  appear, but only briefly in the backdrop.  The comic duo of  Trevor and Cory is long gone.  Lucy, Sarah, and Trinity appear merely by duty, almost like former popular classmates showing up a for a class reunion.  Even the front lawn bee with the spinning wings gets a bow out.  Brian Vollmer of Helix and Alex Lifeson of Rush also make guests cameos.  And of course, the two Chrysler New Yorkers almost disintegrated as a mile-marker of the evolution of TPB.

The movie is called Countdown to Liquor Day, so naturally the focus is on Jim Lahey and his lover Randy.  Though John Dunsworth has pretty much exhausted every possible improvisation of FUBAR drunkenness in all previous episodes and outtakes, he carries the movie when scenes tend - as Clattenburg commented in the first TV season - to walk the tight rope between comedy and drama, and come dangerously close to toppling onto the serious side.  Pat Roach is his  able male lover, bickering with and nagging Jim in a domestic tale of a same sex couple.

Some of the whackiness of the earlier days are, as always, hidden in the ""Deleted Scenes"" section; Ricky tricking policemen into arresting innocent hunters during a liquor store holdup is a signature move, Ricky demanding from the film crew just what it is they are filming,  Cyrus pulling his gun out during an academic test.  There's also IMHO, a superior alternate ending that brings the focus back to Lahey and ends ""Countdown"" on a positive note, sending a morse code to fans like Seinfeld's final episode.  There's a fun, alternate commentary track featuring the three familiar folks at the fansite trailer park boys org: Fishy Neil, Shake, and Tiggy.

The boys and creator Mike Clattenburg is in the process of creating a new show entitled ""The Drunk and on Drugs Happy Funtime Hour"" scheduled to air later this year.  I look forward to new and great things from this troupe. My friend and I drove 1000 miles to Halifax for the premier of this movie, too poor for hotels and as a homage to Ricky...we slept in the car.",1264377600,33,5372,4.780911062906725
3973608,4,B002RD55PS,"It wasn't quite what I expected after seeing every episode and the first movie, but I did enjoy it.  I liked the alternate ending and some of the deleted scenes more than I liked the actual movie, but I WAS NOT disappointed.  Not to be a spoiler, but we've watched it twice now and each time we pick up on small details and characters in the background.  Overall I think this was a great movie and the cast and crew did an excellent job.  In the interest of continuing the TPB story, I would have liked to have seen what happened that led to the boys being in jail since everyone seemed happy at the end of the series, T and J-Roc's babies, Randy and Lucy's baby, etc.  It wouldn't have needed to be big either- just have the kids around and maybe a quick cut scene to why Jim had them tossed back in and I would have thought it was perfect- that's why I only gave it four stars.",1264032000,4,879,4.116959064327485

We've watched this movie over a dozen times, there is so much good dirty fun and crime it must be seen to be believed. The boys are getting out of prison at the beginning of the film and they can't wait to start breaking the law doing small crimes. But wait, Julian has a plan (doesn't he always). Mr Leahy is at his all time best in this farcical romp with the masters of marijuana and drunken craziness. If you're looking for insanity disguised as normal people doing decidedly not-normal things then by all means give this movie a good watching, it will change your life!",1346889600,,662,4.434426229508197

3974008,5,B002RD55PS,"I would like to start out by saying that I went into this film knowing absolutely nothing about the 'TPB' characters and the crazy, dead-end world they live in. I had no idea this film (a sequel no less) was based on a television show from Canada and the cult following it had amassed over the years, but the hilarity of this film is a testament to the series because I am now hooked on the source material. The story is fairly straightforward. It's about a group of guys that live in a trailer park and struggle with each other's various hang-ups--there's Julian, a misguided yet articulate mountain of a man who ALWAYS has a glass of rum and coke in his hand, no matter what the situation is; Bubbles, a good-natured simpleton with an affinity for cats; and Ricky, an angry drug-dealer with dreams of a better, more educated life, even though his misfortune is often brought about by his friends' half-brained schemes, including his own. The scheme that drives the latter half of this film is downright hilarious, but it would be terrible for me to go into detail about it because you have to see the chaos unfold for yourself. I must say that John Dunsworth, who plays the ever-disgraced and reviled Jim Lahey, steals this movie, particularly in the third act. He gives new meaning to the term ""falling off the wagon"" in ways you can't imagine. Your enjoyment of the film may be decided by how familiar you are with the show, but speaking as a non-fan going in, I was wiping away tears of laughter by the very end. I highly recommend it.",1343952000,,1540,4.523297491039426

If you have not been following the mishaps of Bubbles and his pals, you may want to check out a few of the past TV episodes before watching this to get the full flavor.  Great laughs -if you understand and appreciate this genre of comedy.",1301270400,,456,4.218390804597701

As usual, Ricky, Bubbles and Julian are at war with Lahey and Randy, nothing new there.  Their hijinks are hillarious, and there are the classic TPB gags thrown in for good measure.

3974015,3,B002RD55PS,"My husband waited for this movie to be released in the US for months, if not a year. He is a massive fan of the TV show. He even went out and bought the poster for this movie and installed it in his man-cave. So, when it was finally released I bought it. He sat through it with keen anticipation. I heard occasional laughter wafting from the cave, but, more often than not, there was silence, save for the nasal voice of Bubbles. I would ONLY recommend this movie if totally sophomoric, moronic humor is your gig. Don't expect this to make you a converted TPB fan. Watch the TV show instead. I think they ""Boys"" are best in smaller doses.",1281398400,,638,4.2809917355371905
3974016,2,B002RD55PS,"I've only seen the first 3 seasons of the regular show, but agree with a few other reviews - this one, while is a must watch because it is TPB, just wasn't as funny as the shows I have seen up to this point.  It wasn't horrible, but I didn't laugh too much, but it was a good 90minutes of brain dead entertainment.  It would be hard to watch a 2nd time though.",1280448000,2,360,3.9178082191780823
3974017,4,B002RD55PS,"Watching this movie, as compared to their other movie and their TV series, it's just not the same to me. But, since I own everything else from The Trailer Park Boys (all seven seasons, their first movie, and even their Christmas special) I guess I had to get this movie too.

However, I am not particularly crazy about this latest installment of the show.  For one thing, it's a bit too heavy on the gay theme.  I was okay with Mr. Lahey and Randy having their private relationship although everybody knew about it (because they are both creepy anyway, and they deserve each other), but in this movie, there is too much outspoken gay affection from Mr. Lahey for his love interest in Julian and that just creeped me out, even though I'm not Julian.

And the second thing about this movie that reduces the appeal for me is that we don't have Cory and Trevor anymore.  Their absence even hurt the seventh and final season of their TV series.  I think their roles as insecure, but co-operative flunkies for Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles added some charm to the show.

But, I'm glad that Sarah is still with us.  I really like Sarah!  She's hot!  So, for that reason alone, I'll add this movie to my Trailer Park Boys collection.",1280448000,,1222,4.513636363636364

Unfortunately, this one brought ZERO laughs to me. It's just not all that funny. If watching a drunk and a rapper are your thing, this is your kind of movie. Otherwise, stand clear of this one.

The DVD is loaded with extras including over 30 minutes of deleted scenes and an alternate ending. There are several featurettes on the disc as well.

The boys themselves are entertaining (especially Bubbles), but overall, save your money unless you're a real Trailer Park Boy's fan and want this one for your collection.",1270339200,3,690,4.733333333333333
