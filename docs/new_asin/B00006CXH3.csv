1742145,2,B00006CXH3,"I am totally unaware of the writings of Larry Brown. This put me at a severe disadvantage when trying to enjoy Big Bad Love. The character Leon Barlow (Arliss Howard) came across as a Hunter S. Thompson without the satirical wit of the Gonzo King. Leon is a drunkard who hopes to become a respected fiction author. So far, he receives only rejection slips in the mail on almost a daily basis. He is divorced from Marilyn (Debra Winger) and they have two children. Leons drinking is destroying his life and everyone else's around him. We ceaselessly witness Leons alcohol induced fantasies and nightmares. The man is sick and needs help. Unfortunately, Leon is oblivious and indifferent about seeking a cure. Will even a tragedy do anything to motivate him to straighten out his life? Angie  Dickinson portrays his somewhat affluent codependent mother who adds to the problem by not allowing him to hit bottom. In the back of his mind, Leon knows that she will always pull his bacon out of the fire.
I am not one those people who feels compelled to pretend that this sort of film is challenging, provocative, and thoughtful. As matter of fact, one should be wary whenever a professional reviewer employs these terms. It is often their way of damming with faint praise. I was so bored after the first twenty minutes that I had to force myself to endure the rest of the story. It does not stand on its own. You will probably intensely dislike ""Big Bad Love unless you take the additional time to acquaint yourself with Larry Browns short stories. Also, I guess Im tired of the peculiar hint that only serious alcoholics and drug addicts can become great writers. Whatever, ultimately I can only give Big Bad Love two stars.",1039910400,3,1720,4.695364238410596
1742146,1,B00006CXH3,"This movie breaks my heart.
It's well shot and well cast, and the actors do a good job.  It's based on the stories and novellas of Larry Brown, who is one of my favorite writers.  I've also always liked Arliss Howard, ever since I saw him in ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and he gets behind the camera for this one, and stars; somehow he manages to make himself look a great deal like (what I imagine) a Brown hero would look like.  And the music on the soundtrack is fantastic.
But the movie totally misses the mark.  It probably looked good on paper -- a Southern ""Barfly"" with broad, surreal touches -- but on screen it just doesn't work.
The key element to Larry Brown's writing has always been simplicity.  He sketches scenes with precise characterizations, short concise images and lines of dialogue that read like a breeze.  ""Big Bad Love"" (the movie) trades all that in for flashy nonsense and makes the whole thing seem phony.  The stories whisper short sentences but the movie shouts through a bullhorn and repeats lines over and over.
The film is largely based on the short novel ""92 Days,"" which is about a beer-thirsty, frustrated author who cranks out stories and gets into a whole lot of trouble without really trying to.  But where the book had, say, a moving scene with two brothers, the movie has a scene with twins... identical twins... who also dress exactly alike in nerdy shirts.  Everything in the movie is underlined, everything is QUIRKY.  By the time three characters picnic on a football field while an oblivious marching band stomps past, you'll feel you're watching one of those early 70s flicks made by straight people trying to recapture the spirit of ""Easy Rider"" with liberal amounts of inexplicable wackiness.
This movie is to Brown's work what ""Where the Buffalo Roam"" is to the writings of Hunter Thompson -- they got the right ingredients, they just didn't put in the right amounts.  I suspect the filmmakers' hearts are in the right place but they misjudged the source material and amplified all the wrong things.
Admission: there's one scene where a man scrapes Alpo out of a can onto a cinderblock for his dog.  The scene is a throwaway, taken from a fairly static section of the book ""Joe,"" but it seemed to me to be the only true moment in the film.  If only the rest were anywhere near as good as that.
Read the books.  Skip the movie.",1031788800,7,2369,4.609523809523809
1742187,4,B00006CXH3,i dig this movie.  first saw it on directv a few months ago.  glad to have it in my collection.  totally satisfied.,1350432000,,115,4.136363636363637
1742188,1,B00006CXH3,Don't believe the 2 to 5 star ratings. A complete waste of time. A very long and failed movie that feels like it will never end. Awful.,1294444800,,135,4.037037037037037
1742189,5,B00006CXH3,"Showed up even a little before the initial date of the back order.  Everything just fine.  Good movie, too.",1284076800,,107,4.578947368421052
1742190,5,B00006CXH3,"If everything in your life is going well, you'll likely regard this story as somewhat frustrating. For once could you NOT be drunk, Barlow?? But if you have unfulfilled dreams and are struggling without sympathy or support, and face it, most of us have been there at one time or another, then you'll find this one of the most compelling, engaging stories ever. The character of Leon Barlow (Arliss Howard) is both complex and perplexing. You'll want to watch this more than once. And get the sound track too -- awesome music!",1173744000,,525,4.717391304347826
1742191,4,B00006CXH3,"I bought this DVD for my brother's birthday because he has almost all of Larry Brown's books (as does my wife) and neither had heard of ""Big Bad Love"".  To me this movie is more about Larry Brown than Arliss Howard or Debra Winger, who most of the critics discuss rather than its resemblance to an autobiography of Brown.

If you have read any of Brown's books, you will soon realize that you probably can't get through all of them -- too much this, or too much that, as your tastes dictate.  So it is with this movie. Winger gives the movie credibility and is probably the best reason to see it.

For those of you who think the movie setting is hokum, leave the University campus and take a quick swing around Oxford where Brown lived and worked until his untimely death.  Mixed in with all the ante bellum homes, oak lined boulevards, new mansions, University professors, Faulkner festivals and professional people, you will find just the kind of people and neighborhoods portrayed in this movie.",1142985600,3,998,4.6158192090395485
1742192,5,B00006CXH3,"I've read some Larry Brown novels but not the short story this movie was based on -- this might have been a good thing. I had no particular expectations, except that the movie would be about a writer and that, as with other Brown characters, the writer would be frustrated and maybe drunk.

I'm *not* a writer, so this is hard for me to explain -- but watching Big Bad Love was like being in Brown's head.  What a great experience.  I can't think of any other film that's done this.  I enjoyed every second, and I'd like to thank Arliss Howard and everyone involved for doing it.",1098230400,10,579,4.333333333333333
1742193,4,B00006CXH3,"It is a brave, albeit sometimes foolish, thing to invest one's soul in one creative project. Arliss Howard as writer, co-producer, director, and star of this film stepped up to the plate, and blasted this one out of the park. He took a series of short stories by realist Southern writer Larry Brown, raw jangled events, and weaved a remarkable semi-cohesive odyssey from them.
Howard, as director, created the kind of film that slaps you in the face. It showers you with smokey narrative, and challenges you to stay up with it. It is very cinematic, laden with lush flashbacks, Fellinisk absurdist characters frolicing about, voice-overs (some of which overlap), surrealism, and piercing symbolism. It recreated the musky flavors of Mississippi, in pace, dialect, and imagery. Some of the dialogue was clever, worth quoting, and much of it was colloquial; rife with down-home twang and swagger. Barlow, the main character, at one point said,"" I want to punch a mudhole in your ass, and stomp it dry."".
Howard, as  producer, teamed up with his wife, Debra Winger, and convinced IFC to release it. Howard, as writer, collaborated with Larry Brown's brother Jim, and they transcribed all the swarthy confusion, drama, and epiphany of the short stories, overlaying them with a through-line and a fascinating protagonist engaged on a drunken angry journey from bathos to clarity.
Howard, as actor, gave an intense, passionate, and unsympathetic performance; like Ed Harris in POLLOCK. We sensed the character's genius, and we were forced to wade hip deep in his imperfections. Leon Barlow was a man fighting demons, and taking heavy body punches. A wannabe writer, a Vietnam vet, an alcoholic, a deadbeat dad, a brawler, and an eccentric. He smoked too much, drank too much, and was not a responsible parent for his wonderful son and daughter. But he was also a loyal and loving friend, and a talented writer. Howard was so good in this part, Roger Ebert in his review reacted emotionally to the negativity of the character. For much of the picture Barlow was falling down drunk, literally, and Howard portrayed it masterfully. The image of Barlow haunts us; that gaunt enebreated stare, that sparkling intellect swirling below the booze, that muscular back covered in scars, his PTSD, that ever present cigarette dangling from his lips.
Paul Le Mat gave one of his best performances as Monroe, the good buddy and best friend. He seemed to be quite wealthy, but after he and Barlow returned from Viet Nam, all he ever wanted to do was hang out with his friend. He became patron and caretaker. He loved the man, and he stood by him regardless of the risk. After Monroe was nearly killed when an Army truck collided with his stalled pick-up, leaving him brain damaged and remote, Barlow was cut loose. And this tragedy came on the searing heels of Barlow losing his angelic daughter to a respiratory ailment. The twin traums seemed to shake the hangover cobwebs from his psyche, forcing him to look into the abyss of his excesses. Then like a bolt of white light he received an acceptance letter for some of his writing, and the denouement was complete.
Debra Winger, as Marilyn, the ex-wife, reminded us that we have missed her screen presence for far too long. Her small scene where she finally lets the grief from her daughter's death descent upon her was devastating. Thematically, Barlow, in jail, had the same moment to stare at his child's snapshot and grieve. Their co-mingled cries of loss and anguish rose together as parents, and it became doubly hard to resist one's tears. Rosanna Arquette had fun with Velma, Monroe's girlfriend, then wife. Her mixture of ditz-sexuality and geniune compassion rang true. Angie Dickinson, as the mother, Mrs. Barlow, did a credible job of joining the ensemble. Michael Parks, as the storekeeper, Mr. Aaron, was almost recognizable. Only his habitual mumbling clued us in; although to his credit he did create a memorable character. Several Tom Waits tunes, and other blues selections were used for musical tone. I wondered how Tom Waits, as actor, would have approached Mr. Aaron. One fun bit of casting had author Larry Brown playing the father, Mr. Barlow.
The film is a carnival ride, and we are swept up in a maelstrom of delusion, cigarette smoke, stale beer, tragedy, humor, and whiskey. As it winds down finally, as the emotional storm abates, we are left with an odd sense of warmth, as if the arduous journey has paid off, and we are left with a sun-kissed birdsong moment on a cloudless Southern morning.",1081987200,21,4554,4.906614785992218
1742194,5,B00006CXH3,"Others have already given comprehensive reviews of this, so I won't retread, but I just had to recommend this amazing little movie. It was obviously a labor of love in the making, and is much closer to the reality of relationships and human problems than most of the Hollywood junk that folks have grown accustomed to being spoon-fed. ""The only thing you know is what goes on inside your head"", and that existential posit is true enough.
I'll never forget that image of the boxcar slowly trailing away.
Surreal and touching, funny as it is harrowing and desperate, these characters seek renewal and escape...if that's possible.
Or are they, like all of us, prisoner's of their own lives and subject to the winds of fate?",1075680000,11,720,4.768
1742195,5,B00006CXH3,"I had read the short story collection before, and seeing the movie made me go back to see what I had missed--but I hadn't missed anything. It is not often that a movie actually out performs a book, but Arliss Howard took Brown's unsympathetic Barlow and turned him into a character I could actually empathize with. The Barlow in ""92 Days"" I couldn't care less about. This is redneck surrealism done right.
I don't get why so many people have a sore tooth about the film. The cinematography is great and the characters are really southern instead of backwoods cliche. Scenes that didn't make the film get represented with image metaphors (a cow at the typewriter--a chainsaw on the porch--a pig getting carried down the road--so if you paid attention to the book and film at all nothing really gets left out.
Also, the casting is perfect. Arliss plays the best fall down drunk I've ever seen--""That's me and Monroe, Monroe.""--and Debra Winger plays the heartbroken ex-wife like no one I've ever seen. The desperation in her face as she is running down the road in the final scene broke my heart.
I think Brown is a talented writer(although the 'gritty realism' thing gets old with me, and sometimes the lack of real emotions his characters have seems unbelievable), but the lady who said to skip the film and go just for the book is crazy. Arliss turned coal to diamonds(maybe not that drastic), and the film deserves alot more credit than it's been given by reviewers and viewers who don't like to think.",1062028800,8,1504,4.700757575757576
1742196,5,B00006CXH3,"I think this will be a movie that people keep looking for - until it gains the appropriate status it deserves. Even if it's 20 years from now.  It's terrific - even if unsettling, a bit hard to follow (unless you free up your head to let the movie lead you), idiosynchratic (to say the least), and challenging. It's a piece, not just a movie. Every little detail is right and in its right place. If you want a lesson in acting, watch this movie. Arliss Howard, Debra Winger, Paul LeMat, Rosanna Arquette, Angie Dickinson are wonderful - honest, real, without a trace of how they do this amazing work. (Catch the neat cameo by Michael Parks, too) The acting is so smoothly done that these people could be your neighbors - and certainly mine. These are great actors/actresses - all of whom have been underrated in their careers and not ""scene"" often enough. The photography is enthralling at times. Beautiful, even when focused on the ugly. There is warmth and wit and heart and honesty. There is a very true portrait of what it is like for a writer - or perhaps any creative person - who, not always by choice, must live in his/her own head. ""All you know, Leon, is what goes on in your own head."" The music is a perfect match. While the directing requires a lot from the viewer and the script, written by Jim P. Howard and Arliss Howard (yes, the very same Arliss Howard)based on stories by Larry Brown (very much worth reading), is not easy at times, the movie is well worth the effort to find it. If you want a movie about real people, with real humor, real daily struggles, and a great big heart - this is it.  With the DVD you can replay the hard parts, enjoy again the great parts. An imperfect (sorta like real life) movie, yes, but the lessons about movie making and the lessons about acting from this cast are perfect. If you truly get into this film, you'll never quite look at yourself in the mirror the same way again.",1041033600,14,1929,4.400560224089636
7967195,5,B00006CXH3,"A beautiful homage to the source text, Arliss Howard and Deborah Winger walk the landscape of Larry Brown's Mississippi like they were born to it. The characterizations are vivid, and fans of the book will recognize not only the leads, but the incidental characters who breeze through the landscape.

This is not a shot by shot re-telling of the story, which would have been impossible, but rather a carefully crafted homage to the short story collection. Even the most cynical could not help but smile watching this film.",1476144000,,522,4.931818181818182

7967199,3,B00006CXH3,"Read the collection of short stories by Larry Brown first, but this film only picks up pieces of them, far as I could tell.  That being said, BBL is an indie film, the lead being one of the writers.  That may explain the complicated structure, with a number of sudden flashbacks, not all of which are explained--they just hang in memory, so to speak.  Frankly, they detracted from solid acting, unnecessarily muddying plot continuity and character motivation (which seemed clear enough otherwise).

7967202,5,B00006CXH3,"This is by far one of the best films of recent past.  Leon Barlow is a day laborer on the down and outs who has a passion and flare for creative writing.
