8556852,5,B00ARH1XVG,"Basics are the foundation that turns into advanced skill with practive over time.  This is the concept of Kung Fu.  A skill acquired through hard work over a period of time.

Shifu Roger Hagood gives you the building blocks in order for you to learn how to not only train South Mantis but to apply it.

Thank you, Shifu!",1446076800,,320,4.372881355932203
8556853,5,B00ARH1XVG,"he basics of any martial art are so important,and you get all of the basics of praying mantis kung fu in this dvd,Mr. Hagood is a true sifu who really knows his art,must have dvd for the mantis practioner!",1358553600,,205,4.282051282051282
8556854,5,B00ARH1XVG,"Whether you are a seasoned martial artist or a beginner with no martial foundation, if you want to be competent in SPM, then this is the place to start. Sifu Hagood gives clear and definitive explanations, directions, and instructions that will guide you to understand the foundation from which the rest of your training will be built upon. The players in the dvd are proficient, but as Sifu Hagood says, don't necessarily follow their example,follow his instructions(that's my paraphrase).  SOUTHERN PRAYING MANTIS CAN ONLY BE MASTERED WITH A PARTNER, so I recommend that you find someone you can train with, have them obtain a copy as well, and begin your training via the correspondence program. I have found Sifu Hagood to be very accessible via e-mail, and he has always satisfactorily answered all of my questions. Even with my having previous martial experience, I have found him to be very knowledgeable and sound in his responses, requirements and recommendations.",1356220800,,973,5.119496855345912
