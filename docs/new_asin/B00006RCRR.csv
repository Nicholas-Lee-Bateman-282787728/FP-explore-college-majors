7972628,5,B00006RCRR,"I saw this broadcast in the seventies when I was in high school, and promptly fell in love with both the play and with Sam Waterston's sublime performance.  I received the DVD as a gift this week, watched it again, and was mesmerized again. I've seen it staged several times, at Chicago Shakespeare and elsewhere, and  I love the Kenneth Branagh version.  And I was afraid it wouldn't live up to my hyperbolic high school reaction.  But the production is delightful, beautifully and consistently conceived.  And I fell in love with Waterston's performance all over again.  Watch this, or his Nick Carraway in ""The Great Gatsby"" if you want to be reminded of what an extraordinary actor he is: two completely different roles performed with such subtlety, expressiveness and wit that I felt like applauding at the end of each disc.",1336953600,,829,4.843971631205674
7972629,5,B00006RCRR,"I was one of the 20 million viewers watching the original production on tv -- and fell in love with the show.  The idea of updating the play to turn of the century America was a lot of fun - plus the addition of period music and beautiful costumes.

Thought the leading players - Beatrice Widdowes and Sam Waterston were excellent in their parts -- and Barnard Hughes as Dogberry the Constable was delightful.

The only reason I watched this production in the first place was the idea that a Shakespearean play had been updated to ""modern"" times...I usually avoided the Bard's plays - not my cup of tea..but this production was a joy from beginning to end.

I also highly recommend the Kenneth Branagh/Emma Thompson version -- a visual feast for the eyes -- and it keeps up the interest.",1119052800,11,787,4.560283687943262
