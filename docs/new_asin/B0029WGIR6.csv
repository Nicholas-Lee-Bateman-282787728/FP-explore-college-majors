3881823,5,B0029WGIR6,"I thought this DVD was pretty awesome until I saw them live. This DVD only gives a glimpse of the awe-inspiring performance that Otep is capable of giving.

She encourages audience participation and spends a small chunk of the set talking to the audience as well as reciting some spoken word material. This performance has twelve songs - covering ""Sevas Tra"" up through ""The Ascention."" I wish their set was much longer but hopefully their next live DVD will make up for what I consider to be a short set. It's obvious that the entire band loves what they do and their passion for the music they perform shines through in every song.

The DVD also includes music videos for ""Ghostflowers,"" ""Crooked Spoons,"" ""Confrontation,"" and ""Breed.""",1270252800,,737,4.841269841269841

8358428,5,B0029WGIR6,Otep is such an awesome performer. I've been going to her concerts the past 16 years and she's been touring this long because she is great at it. Love her music and lyrics. Her band is amazing as well. This video is awesome. I took my 12 year old daughter to see her concert in Albuquerque this year and my daughter became such a fan.,1503360000,,334,4.153846153846154
8358429,5,B0029WGIR6,"I'm reviewing Otep's work in general, not each individual song, because all her songs rock in my book. Otep is one of those artists you have to let in, when you do be prepared for her to bring all those hidden feelings to the forefront. Showing no mercy, she will rip your emotions from the deepest darkest pits of your soul, the question is, can you face them? I have yet to find a song from her I haven't been able to connect too. Lyrics are raw, powerful, punch you in the face and you will love it type of deal. I do.
Love this dvd, made well plus you get some awesome videos.",1473984000,,580,4.0964912280701755
8358430,5,B0029WGIR6,"THIS IS A PHENOMENAL DVD.. i enjoyed every minute of it. the best i have seen of otep... glad that it is in my collection ..

the guitarist, aaron nordstrom, is now the lead singer for a band known as Gemini Syndrome. truly a phenomenal band, Aaron is one of the most approachable individuals in the music industry today. ive had the opportunity to meet him a couple times.. once when he was playing for otep, the other when gemini syndrome started here in the los angeles area.",1467849600,,478,4.431818181818182
8358431,5,B0029WGIR6,"I don't go to shows anymore, because I'm old! :) So I got this expecting it to be straight song to song without too much banter like most bands do, but I was way off. The singer is really charming and gets the crowd pumped up spitting poetry and musings right into the song. Even though kids get on my nerves at shows these days, I would drag my husband to go see Otep!",1426204800,,369,4.0

8358434,5,B0029WGIR6,The best live performance I have ever seen. Otep is unique and rebellious and her on stage gives me chills.,1365724800,,107,4.4
8358435,5,B0029WGIR6,"i am a BIG ... HUGE otep fan. i love zoning out to her music and i've got every album, i wish i had a shoulder back with otep on it. i got this dvd like 3 yrs ago and BAM. love it!! it's a live concert, a bit older, smash the control machine, atavist and hydra aren't on it, but, it's still worth it. i've been thrilled to watch it...now...(to just see her in concert) it's sitting on my shelf and it's always nice to see her on my big hdtv. if you like ot6p, you WILL NOT be disappointed. she's a genius, activist, and VERY profound with her words.

i highly recommend 'sounds like armageddon' if you love this. it's a live audio show. i have no complaints.",1365552000,,658,4.061538461538461
8358436,4,B0029WGIR6,"Seeing someone live in concert can never be topped by a DVD of a concert.  With that said, I enjoyed the performance.  The video quality was good but the audio could have been better.  Would have given it five stars with better audio.",1330473600,,234,4.395348837209302
8358437,5,B0029WGIR6,"I knew nothing about this band upon purchasing this DVD and still know very little.

I will say the performance was top notch. It was filmed in a small club (I'd estimate the club holds 500 to 1,000) which gives you a very intimate performance from the band.

Camera work was excellent, sound was great and well mixed at good levels, lighting was well done.

I think fans and otherwise would enjoy this performance... Recommended!",1294963200,,430,4.706666666666667
