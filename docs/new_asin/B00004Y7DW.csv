But this boxed set proves everybody wrong. Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, Chris Rock and Chris Farley, make up this hilarious 4 - disc set. And while there's quite a few flaws here and there (more on that later), it's always good for a laugh and a half.
""The Best Of Dana Carvey"" gathers some of the Montana - born comedian's best moments, from The Church Lady to Garth to Hans, as well as lesser - known characters like Derek Stevens and the slightly disturbing Massive Headwound Harry. Also included is a hilarious montage of his greatest impressions ranging from his classic George Bush to Robin Leach to George Michael. Great stuff.
""The Best Of Mike Myers"" gathers 6 years of lively and hilarious sketches. While most fans will want this solely for the ""Wayne's World"" sketches, don't overlook other sketches like ""Theater Stories"", ""Phillip"" and ""Tokyo Game Show"", all of which are equally funny than Wayne, Linda Richman or Deiter. Also his Mick Jagger sendup (featuring the real Jagger as Keith Richards) is brutally funny to say the least.
""The Best Of Chris Rock"" is my first sticking point. Rock spent 3 seasons on the show and gave the show some of his greatest works ever, like ""The Dark Side With Nat X"" and a host of classic ""Weekend Update"" commentaries, both of which are included here. But there are way too many sketches in which Rock is pushed to the background while another castmember outshines him and everybody else in the sketch, such as Phil Hartman in ""The Sinatra Group"", which nonetheless is one of my favorite ""SNL"" sketches ever. Still, pretty funny.
""The Best Of Chris Farley"" is a disappointment. For five years, Farley gave the show his all. A lot of his best works are missing, while some are butchered to mere snippets in the montage segments. However, great sketches like ""Lunchlady Land"" and ""Superfans"" are shown in  their entirety.
Overall, a great boxed set. The only one that's better is the 8 -pack that features these 4 dvds as well as the best of Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler and The Bad Boys. Still, it's good. Hopefully in the future, we'll get discs devoted to the best of Kevin Nealon, Jan Hooks, Norm Macdonald, Jimmy Fallon, Tina Fey, Chris Kattan, Darrell Hammond, Rachel Dratch and Mya Rudolph, to name a few.",1080864000,4,2460,4.681293302540416
7926942,5,B00004Y7DW,"I love this collection of comic geniuses.  I enjoy watching everyone of these comedians and their numerous characters that they play.  I recommend anyone who likes to laugh, to buy this collection.",997660800,2,197,5.125
7926943,5,B00004Y7DW,"With the departure of Eddie Murphy, Dan Akroyd, and other stars that made Saturday Night Live a hit in the early 1980's, Lorne Michaels was faced with a major challenge. Where was he going to get cast members who would be able to capture the humor and wit that the show's early stars emitted every Saturday night on NBC.
Well Lorne went to many of the best comedy clubs in America and Canada to find the new class of comedians that would make SNL a major smash during the early 1990's. Fellow Canadian Mike Meyers, New York native Chris Rock, Chicago native Farley and Midwesterner Dana Carvey round up this collection of the best of the best comedians to ever be cast members on SNL.
""The Best of Dana Carvey"" features many of his classic characters including the popular Church Lady. The DVD also features an artistic collage of some of Carvey's best performances including his Johnny Carson sendups, Garth from ""Wayne's World"" and the ever-irritable Ross Perot. The DVD also contains bonus material such as Carvey's audition tape and other sketches not found on the VHS release.
""The Best of Chris Farley"" has some of the best moments the late comic gave on SNL. My favorites have to be the chubby Gap girl who appears in a popular sketch featuring David Spade and Adam Sandler. Another of my favorites, although brief was his impersonation of Carnie Wilson of ""Wilson Phillips"" fame and Laurie Davis (the infomercial woman who made Cher a laughing stock for a while).
""The Best of Mike Meyers"" has to be one of the best in this collection, as it features some of Meyer's most classic characters. Wayne from ""Wayne's World"", Linda Richman from ""Coffee Talk"", and Teutonic nutball Dieter from ""Sprockets"" are all here. I only wish that the DVD contained more Dieter sketches since the sketch titles ""Dieter's Dream"" left me unamused. The Madonna Dream from ""Wayne's World"" is also found on this DVD which features a classic comedic performance by Madonna. Madonna also appears in another sketch, this time a ""Coffee Talk"" sketch where Linda Richman (based on Meyer's real-life Mother-in-Law), Madonna, and Roseanne Barr pay tribute to Barbra Streisand (guess who pops up to surprise the girls at the end?).
Finally, the ""Best of Chris Rock"" features Rock's classic urban humor and wit. Luther Campbell, ""Russell Simmons' Def Jam"" shows, and other urban-related comedy sketches are all here. My favorite has to be Nat X and his outrageous talk show. Rock's opening monologue is also hysterical as he points out things that are so true.
Overall, this is a great collection, however I would love to see a DVD compilation of the best works by Adam Sandler, David Spade, and the late Phil Hartman added to this box set. All three comics deserve to be in a box set, and maybe in the future they will be in one. In conclusion, this is an excellent box set of comedy classics from some of today's best young comics. It's a must have for any SNL fan.",974592000,21,2943,4.738791423001949

7926945,4,B00004Y7DW,"Wow! These dvds are awsome. Carvey's the best. It's very sad he has a heart disease. The only flaw is that Myers' has some stupid sketches like ""Lothar and the Hill People"" and ""Dieter's Dream"".",970963200,,194,4.571428571428571
