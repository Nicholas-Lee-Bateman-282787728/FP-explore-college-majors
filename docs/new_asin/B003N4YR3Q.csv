8400704,5,B003N4YR3Q,"As we sit and chafe and fidget, waiting for Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather, Jr. to just finally get in the friggin' ring already, GRANDES PELEAS Vol. 44 presents three more high-profile bouts to tide us over: Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. ""Sugar"" Shane Mosley, ""Sugar"" Ray Leonard vs. ""Marvelous"" Marvin Hagler, and Kostya Tszyu vs. Julio Cesar Chavez. For those concerned, all the fight commentaries are in English and the one-minute corner breaks are skipped over so we never do get those inspirational ""Cut me, Mickey!"" moments (not that there were any in these fights).

- Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. ""Sugar"" Shane Mosley (May 1, 2010)

In hindsight, the layoff after taking it to Margarito may have been too long. How jarring and how humbling must it have been for the 38-year-old Sugar Shane Mosley when he stepped into the ring with Floyd, Jr. that night and promptly realized that it's he who was the slower fighter? Shane seemed so tight and so wound up from jump, and it was worrying for his fans (like me) to see him in the locker room, minutes before the walk-in, and he hadn't even broken out in a sweat yet and was still wrapping up his hands. In the second round, Shane got off with two significant right hands which shook up Floyd temporarily, but that would be Shane's last and only hurrah. To give Mayweather oodles of credit he stood his ground and punched back, and what Floyd had to mete out in punishment became too much for the older fighter. Round by round, after that second one, Mayweather Jr.'s superior pedigree began to tell and it seemed as if Shane did become mesmerized by Floyd's speed and feints. I've never seen a more hesitant Shane Mosley, with more rust than sugar. And, yeah, as much as I'm a Pacquiao disciple, there was no argument in me when friends began hailing Floyd the #1 pound-for-pound. I'm actually pretty offended right now that Mosley's upcoming contest with pillow-punching Sergio Mora is being put on pay-per-view.

- Kostya Tszyu vs. Julio Cesar Chavez (July 29, 2000)

This one pits a young, powerful Russian tank against a 38-year-old Mexican legend. It was supposed to be a showcase for Tszyu's sledgehammer right hand versus Chavez's brutal body assault, with both warriors coming forward, mugging each other. It didn't end up that way. It was a mismatch. After the way the Thunder from Down Under dismantled Miguel Angel Gonzalez the year before, maybe we should've seen this coming. But this was Julio Cesar Chavez, man! He wasn't supposed to go out like that.

If, going in, people assumed that Kostya Tszyu would get rattled by the Chavez aura, I guess they didn't factor in Tszyu's poise. Kostya was an incredibly aggressive fighter and some say he was too measured, but he also had smarts. Or did people forget his patience and perfectly timed shot against Zab Judah? Tszyu systematically broke down Chavez, peppering him with effective left jabs, little uppercuts, digs to the body, and a sly shove here and there (y'know, just to make a point). And then there were those heavy-handed right hands. The work paid off in the sixth round when he got in a left jab-right hand combo which catapulted Chavez to the canvas for only the second time in his career. The referee was soon forced to stop the bout, something which the crowd and Chavez apologists didn't care for at all. Hearing the fans in such an uproar, ringside commentator Bobby Czyz was heard to ask rhetorically, ""What did he have to do? Die?""

- Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Marvelous Marvin Hagler (April 6, 1987)

Three years into retirement, Sugar Ray Leonard danced back into the squared circle, having moved up to middleweight and now taking on a hell of a man in Marvelous Marvin Hagler. Now, Hagler was one of those old-school, iron willed gladiators, and he had this chin of granite and he hit you like you just bagged on his momma. Word on Hagler was, to beat him you had to put him on his shield, hard. Except that Ray Leonard wasn't only an exquisite boxer, he was a crafty guy, as well. He knew there wasn't much of a future in trying to outslug a slugger, especially since Leonard was the one moving up in weight. Punching Hagler was like punching the craggy side of a cliff. And Leonard had these other tools. He had his bag of tricks.

For most of twelve rounds, Sugar Ray Leonard boxed sweetly, moving and moving and moving. He was harder to find than hair on Hagler's dome, more elusive than the Scarlet Pimpernel. And he was sticking and jabbing and scoring, and Hagler allowed him. In essence, what Leonard did that night, with his showmanship and his flashy flurries, was bamboozle Hagler and the judges and the crowd and you and me. The ringside commentator declared: ""Look at Ray Leonard! What a cocky kid."" Hagler did have his moments here and there, but it wasn't enough, wasn't enough. Sugar Ray showed us a bolo punch here, an Ali shuffle there, a punch after the bell once in a while. It was a controversial split decision and, well deserving or not, the WBC middleweight title ended up wrapped around Leonard's waist. As for Marvin Hagler, he tried to secure a rematch with Leonard, but Ray's mother didn't raise stupid kids. A frustrated Hagler soon retired from boxing and he went on to star in Italian action flicks.",1283644800,,5266,4.6792656587473
