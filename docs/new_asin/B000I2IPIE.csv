8143506,4,B000I2IPIE,"First and foremost to notice is that this is an ""art film"" and one that is very self-consciously so. Even the fact that it was shot in black-and-white rather than in colour might suggest that to many filmgoers as, also much more certainly does so, its homage to the spirit of an era, that of the student revolts in Paris in 1968. It pays tribute, as well, to film makers of and before that time in Italy and France, making in various ways such artistic and social connexions. It was another edition watched, one in French with English rather than Italian subtitles. The film, however, in whatever language, can seem interminable, at least so at times, even to someone who is basically in sympathy with its aims and with its aesthetic. The action, whatever one loosely could call that in this work's context, is sporadic and rather disjointed.

This movie from Artificial Eye (the European DVD edition viewed being Fusion Media Sales VFC-318) was made on a low budget. Aside from the b&w photography which is symptomatic of that, the use of music and the sometimes barren stretches where there is no ambient sound behind the acting, also are indicative of low budget. When music does occur it is, by far, usually a solo piano which one hears, on the rather clangourous-sounding instrument recorded; for that matter, the use of piano, although better in tune, even reminds me (to be facetious in making such a far-fetched comparison) of the keyboard meanderings (on out-of-tune piano and on electronic organ or synthesiser, variously) in Troma Entertainment's cult blood-and-gore ballet-themed grindhouse film, ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" (one of the numerous titles by which that work has been known), but even Troma's movie had more variety in its music, more cleverly integrated (albeit less tuneful), within its soundtrack than ""Les Amants rguliers"" (a.k.a. ""Regular Lovers"") happens to have.

Louis Garrel, the son of Philippe Garrel, the director and co-writer of the film, is an exceedingly beautiful young man, numbering among several exceptionally fine-looking French guys in the cast. Those who appreciate young male beauty keenly enough may wish to seek out this film even just on the merits of that alone, although for those so inclined, one should bear in mind that there is little nudity (and never complete nakedness, much less full-frontal) in the movie! The eye-riveting Garrel lad is quite an accomplished actor, too, as to varying degrees are most of the other cast members.

So, although this motion picture's numerous longueurs can try one's patience, it bears viewing, for those who appreciate its genre. The provision of English subtitles works well and, as a bonus feature, there is a panel which includes the director and of some of his actors commenting perceptively, in French and Italian (also subtitled), about aspects of the film.",1438473600,,2852,5.0638297872340425

8143508,5,B000I2IPIE,"""Les Amants Reguliers"" is roughly set in the same time and space as ""The Dreamers,"" and Louis Garrel gives a wonderful performance in his fathers film. This young man is a national treasure that the French people should be very proud of, becuase he is not just wickedly handsome, sharply intelligent and stunning. Above all else he is one of the prototypes of the sensitive, well educated global men of the 21st Century.",1265241600,,420,4.767123287671233
