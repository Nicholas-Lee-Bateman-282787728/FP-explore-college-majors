1816362,4,B00007JMD8,"Addendum to my original review:
I am glad to learn that this title is in fact 16:9 encoded. However, I've been bitten by the letterbox enough times to remain wary of all titles that do not indicate 16:9 (see below). I offer Disney's DVD of ""The Rocketeer"" as an example.  The package for Rocketeer has the word ""Widescreen"" prominently displayed, but it turned out to be letterbox widescreen.  I do not believe, as one reviewer accuses, that I was being irresponsible in alerting buyers to the possibility of the ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" DVD being letterboxed.  No, the irresponsibility lies with whoever marketed this disk without bothering to indicate that it was 16:9.  Anyway, thanks to all those above who posted to set me straight.  I am now eager to order this title. I believe my original review remains germane in part, and may be instructive to some, so I will leave it.
Original review follows:
Buyer beware! Pre-release information of Fox Home Entertainment's new DVD edition of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" states only that the disk is ""widescreen"". There is no indication that this disk is 1) 16:9 encoded, 2) enhanced for widescreen TVs, or 3) anamorphic. If none of these three key phrases is present, it is a good bet that the word ""widescreen"" merely means plain old-fashioned letterboxed formatting.
Why should you care whether this disk is 16:9 encoded? Because when played back on a widescreen digital TV, a 16:9 disk is capable of delivering significantly higher resolution. Even if you do not own a widescreen TV, chances are you will, soon. When you buy a digital widescreen TV, if the ""widescreen"" disk you buy today is not 16:9 encoded, it will continue to look more like letterbox VHS rather than widescreen HDTV.
Personally, I am content to continue watching my VHS tape of this title until Fox releases this title with 16:9 enhancement. In the meantime, I would suggest an alternate purchase of a quality DVD digitized with true widescreen enhancement, such as the splendid new DVD editions of ""Forbidden Planet"", or ""The Time Machine"" starring Rod Taylor.

Vote with your pocketbook. Let the studios know that you demand 16:9 encoding on all ""widescreen"" DVDs. After all, why should you settle for less?",1046044800,2,2253,4.869451697127937
1816363,5,B00007JMD8,"This is a great movie, no doubt the best science fiction special effects movie of its time. Beautiful visuals, great soundtrack (though not popular songs, but sounds that build the power of the movie.) Just lower your expectations because it was done 40+ years ago, it's worth viewing and probably buying. I've probably watched this at least twenty times and I only just got a copy of it within the last year.
The storyline is great, with cool scientific twists, romance and humor.
the actors-- James Mason, Pat Boone (this could be his best role) and Arlene Dahl help make the movie even better.
The story is adapted from a Jules Verne original. It tells of an unlikely crew of explorers who follow the path of an earlier pioneering scientist to the center of the earth. Along the way they see wonders never encountered at the surface, including the best portrayal of dinosaurs before Jurassic park. But the dinosaurs are only a part of it. The magic of the jewel cave scene has always entranced me, probably because of the music, by Bernard Herrmann, who also created music for Twilight Zone, Psycho, Citizen Kane, Day the Earth Stood Still, North by Northwest... check out imdb for the long list of movies he created music for.",1045958400,5,1230,4.725581395348837
1816364,5,B00007JMD8,"The best cave exploring movie you will ever see not to mention a great and magical adaptation of a Jules Verne book. The 1999 remake of this was a joke by comparison. This is by far one of the greatest family movies ever. If you enjoy movies like Mysterious Island (1961), 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954), and Swiss Family Robinson (1960) you will absolutely love it. Even measured against todays effect wizards like Industrial Light & Magic's standards this is a great movie. See the crystal cave, dinosaurs, and giant mushrooms and see if you don't agree. Consider it was made almost 45 years ago and you will be truly amazed. The beautiful scenery and sets are just one facet. The acting and Bernard Herrmann score is superb. The story of a student buying his professor a gift that leads to a discovery of how to journey to the center of the earth is fantastic. A must see and own movie. I preordered my copy on DVD.",1045699200,,923,4.5

And all in glorious letterbox (except TDTESS; it's in a class of it's own).  Journey to the Centre of the Earth is great fantasy movie for for the whole family with beautiful photography and a fantastic musical score provided by THE composer of all time, Bernard Herrmann.  A perfect addition to any scifi collection.",1042588800,19,500,4.790697674418604

It is a great Sci Fy movie and had great special effects for the time. I would compare the special effects in quality to the movie Fantastic Voyage.

If you like Sci Fy and fantasy from that era you will like this one. In my opinion it is the best and the classic version and the movie people think about when the story is brought up.

This movie has giant hila monsters a villain of course and a great cast and awesome classic screenplay.

There is a unique world in the earth. There is good climax at the end of the film. Is realistic as some characters die but since it is from back then a safe bet for sensitive and younger viewers.",1447632000,,784,4.071428571428571

1816749,5,B00007JMD8,"In  the  1980's  I  looked  for  this  movie  everywhere,  but  was  unable  to  find  it,  you  couldn't  rent  it  at  the  local  video  store  because  it  just  wasn't  available.  Then  one  day  when  I  saw  it  on  TV  back  when  I  still  had  cable  with  Dish Network  I  decided  to  record  it  so  I'd  have  it  on  my  DVR.  I  have  missed  this  movie.  I  haven't  seen  it  since  I  was  a  kid.  &  a  couple  of  yrs.  ago  I  finally  see  it  on  TV.  I  am  relieved  its  now  available  on  DVD.  I  haven't  decided  on  buying  it  just  yet.  Still  just  thinking  about  it.
The  movie  itself  is  about  a  man  called  Linden brook  who  soon  has  a  team  &  is  ready  to  go  on  expedition  to  the  center  of  the  earth.  I  know  Alec  in  the  movie,  but  I  don't  know  his  name  in  real  life,  but  what  the  heck,  that  doesn't  really  matter  does  it?  &  you  also  got  the  big  fellow  Isaac.  That  was  his  name  I  think,  &  his  pet  duck  Gertrude.  A  lady  also  goes  along  taking  sides  with  Linden brook.  Her  husband  I  believe  was  killed  &  robbed  of  his  belongings  by  Linden brooks  rival  who's  hoping  to  be  the  first  one  to  get  the  entire  story  before  Linden brook.  Hoping  to  be  the  one  to  get  the  fascinating  information  for  the  people.  &  leaves  marks  along  the  way  hoping  to  lead  the  team  in  the  other  direction. The  story  is  very  interesting,  First  off  he  gets  all  the  rope  he  can  find  &  whatever  equipment  he  needs.  Sleeping  bags,  cookware,  breathing  equipment  cause  the  air  gets  thinner  as  you  descend  into  the  earth,  windup  lanterns  &  Linden brooks  notepad  for  a  journal.  But  the  shaft  is  just  too  deep,  soon  they  find  another  way  in  going  in  at  a  vertical  angel.  Then  you  got  an  underground  ocean,  Giant  mushrooms  which  they  use  to  build  a  raft  after  finding  the  underground  ocean.  2  types  of  lizards,  ones  with  wings  or  whatever  which  their  numbers  are  high.  The  others  you  see  just  before  leaving  Atlantis,  this  one  changes  color  like  a  chameleon.
First  thing  they  find  is  a  spring  where  all  the  pretty  crystals  &  diamonds  are,  after  taking  a  bath  Alec  drops  his  canteen  &  goes  to  get  it  but  cannot  find  his  way  back  &  gets  separated  from  the  rest  of  them.  After  removing  a  fancy  crystal  the  room  begins  to  leak  &  then  flood.  There  must  have  been  an  underground  river  or  something  either  that  or  they  were  nearer  to  the  ocean  then  they  thought.
Meanwhile  Alec  has  just  discovered  a  room  containing  salt,  &  he  notices  his  belongings  starting  to  sink  he  reaches  to  grab  them  when  it  caves  in  &  he  drops  2  stories  down  about  50  to  60  feet.  You  also  got  a  magnetic  storm  &  a  giant  whirlpool,  &  Linden brook  &  the  others  lose  the  majority  of  their  belongings  &  equipment,  the  oxygen  tanks  or  whatever,  &  realize  they  must  return  to  the  surface  to  survive.  I  think  they  would  have  stayed  down  there  longer  if  they  hadn't  of  lost  their  stuff.  I'm  sure  there  was  more  to  see.  &  I  think  its  one  of  the  most  interesting  movies  I've  ever  seen.  Why  do  they  have  to  duplicate  every  movie  &  have  different  actors  than  in  the  original?  My  advice,  skip  the  newer  one  with  Brendan Frazer,  but  definitely  check  this  one  out!  (Pat Boone)  does  kind  of  remind  of  Sean Connery  at  a  younger  age.  I  think  they  look  alike.
I  love  this  movie  it  sort  of  makes  you  wonder  exactly  what  the  inside  of  the  earth  looks  like.  You  ever  wonder  what  it  would  have  been  like  if  this  was  a  true  story,  I  myself  know  it  isn't.  That  would  have  been  something.  I  think  Carl's bad  caverns  is  about  as  close  you  can  ever  get  to  the  center  of  the  earth.  I've  been  there  many  times.

1816879,5,B00007JMD8,"This is the best adaptation of my favorite Jules Verne book. I saw it no less than four times and every time I liked it even more. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Jules Verne's books were a major feature of my childhood and teenage readings and I will always keep in memory the wonderful moments I spend in their company. Sailing the seven seas ""In search of castaways"", navigating ""Twenty thousand leagues under the sea"", building civilization from scratch on ""Mysterious island"", exploring Africa during the ""Five weeks in a balloon"", shooting in space and going ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and ""Around the Moon"", accepting the challenge to travel ""Around the world in 80 days"", trying desperately to survive with ""Dick Sand, a captain at fifteen"", spending ""The begum's millions"" and finally participating in ""The chase of the golden meteor"" - oh, the adventures I lived thanks to this great French writer... But the one that I always cherished the most, to the point of reading the book at least ten times, was ""The journey to the center of the Earth""...

If you didn't read this book yet, I sincerely recommend to do it, if possible before watching this film - but on another hand, as the film changed the story a lot, it is also possible to see the movie before reading the novel.

In the film the story begins in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1880. During the examination of an unusual sample of volcanic rock, professor Sir Oliver Lindenbrook (James Mason), a very famous and quite eccentric geologist at the University of Edinburgh and his young student and more or less research assistant Alec McEwan (Pat Boone), find inside a plumb bob bearing a cryptic inscription. It turns out to have been written by a (fictitious) XVII century Icelandic alchemist Arne Saknussemm, who claimed that he found a passage to the center of the Earth. This passage is supposed to exist in the extinct volcano Sneffels, on Iceland (""In Sneffels Jokulis craterem, quem delibat umbra Scartaris, Julii intra kalendas descende, audax viator, et terrestre centrum attinges; quod feci. Arne Saknussemm""). Lindenbrook and Alec then decide to go on an expedition, the journey to the center of the Earth... And then the film really begins.

As I already stated, in the film the story was significantly changed. In the book the story took place in 1863, both main heroes were German, they lived and worked in Hamburg and they were not teacher and student, but uncle and nephew and their names were professor Otto Lidenbrock and Axel Lidenbrock. As this film was made in USA and it was only 14 years after WWII, the producers preferred to have Scottish rather than German heroes... Also, in the book, professor Lidenbrock and Axel go on their quest accompanied only by their Icelandic guide Hans Bjelke - in the film there are two more participants, both of female persuasion, albeit one of them (a very valiant one) is not entirely human...)))

The film includes also a rival expedition, led by a sinister villain - no such thing existed in the book and this change I didn't like too much... On another hand the Plesiosaurus vs. Ichthyosaurus fight and especially the sighting of the Mastodon Herder, one of the most moving (and upsetting) moments in all Jules Verne's books, are very much absent... The conclusion of the whole quest is also slightly different from the one in the novel, but this change I actually rather liked. There are also other, less important changes - and most of them are nicely done.

Still, many of the treasures and wonders from the book were shown on the screen, including the impressive mushroom ""forest"", the ""not-so-sunless"" sea, prehistoric creatures and the great finale in form of absolutely crazy high speed ride back towards the surface...

Albeit old, this film still packs a terrific punch - and even if it is long (132 minutes), the good pace of events, the adventures, the twists, the scares and also considerable amount of humor make certain that we never get bored. As I already said in another review, good films never age, they just gain a vintage charm - and this is precisely the case of this one... A great SF/adventure movie, an excellent adaptation of one of major Jules Verne's novels and a recommended viewing. ENJOY!",1422489600,2,4274,4.830601092896175

1816904,5,B00007JMD8,"Journey to the Center of the Earth is very much like a more modern day Odyssey if you can call the 19th century modern. Two scientists and one Icelandic aristocrat vie with each other to the be the first to follow in the footsteps of a reknowned scientist from several hundred years before and reach the center of the earth. Early on its a story of competition and survival with a touch of murder involved. But after the hardships of the journey overturn the Professors boat when they reach the magnetic center of the earth, throwing all their scientific records into the sea, and they are spared only their lives, it becomes more of a story of comaraderie and survival. In the end the Professor is rewarded not with scientific fame but with a new wife who has brought him self-knowledge about what is most important in life.",1420416000,3,825,4.581081081081081

1816906,4,B00007JMD8,"As a person semi-rooted in science, I find it difficult to suspend my disbelief.  Well, you must in order to enjoy this film.  As an adventure tale, a fable, a fantasy, it's a warm, endearing, and exciting trek of discovery into the inner sanctum of our planet.  As a science-fiction film, it's silliness personified: as you know, compression is such that you could never find a gateway to the inner earth or anything beneath the crust (unless the ocean floor is different than we suspect.)  So, just conducting a Marco Polo type of march into the inner earth is silliness personified.
With James Mason as the lead actor and some other stars from the 1960's you might remember, the film is a Saturday-at-the-movies matinee type of film, very similar to 'Lost in Space' in adventure, fantasy, warmth, and humanity.  As such, it's not hard science but it is as comfortable as any adventure film and worth another look...",1419984000,,918,4.784810126582278

It really does look almost as good as a BD on my 25"" computer monitor, perhaps not as well on a big-screen.

I am seeing controversy about the difference between the REGULAR DVD of ""journey to the center of the earth"",
and the Blu-ray release, I just have to put my two cents in and say I have had a copy of the REGULAR DVD  released in 2003
for many years now and consider the quality excellent, I watch it on a 75 inch hd big screen tv and the picture is excellent, the color is excellent, the sound is excellent, and it has always played excellent with no problems at all, I saw the original movie in the theater when it came out in 1959 and the REGULAR DVD is superior to even the movie theater release,

How Jules Verne came up with these ideas is beyond comprehension, but Geoge Lucus used them, again and again, in his Indiana Jones series.

The cast is wonderful, the drama and suspense are superb - even the giant lizards are just grand...but the story it tells is what rivets you to the movie...It's fantasy and requires a bit of a stretch of the old imagination, but you can't leave it once it has you.
H.G. Wells was a master story-teller and he makes this a believable and delightful adventure...James Mason and the rest of the cast are all superb... and, of course, a very young Pat Boone.
I have never tired of this one, and I know I'm not alone in that...Get your copy of this classic and start th' popcorn !!",1377820800,2,747,4.297872340425532

It's a sentimental favorite of mine ever since I first saw it as a kid.  The best thing about this film is the score (which I also had to have).  Bernard Herrmann is my favorite film composer.  On the down side, also included, are several ditties warbled by Pat Boone.  Why he shared topped billing with James Mason is anyone's guess (or why he ended up with more screen time!?).  It's an odd casting choice that I wonder about every time I watch this movie.  No one has ever accused Pat Boone of being a great thespian, especially considering the way he maltreated a Scottish accent (which was mostly there and gone).  Next to him, I didn't even mind the intrusion of Arlene Dahl.  (It hardly matters though, because the duck stole the show.)
Criminally, the score was not nominated for an Oscar.  The film was, however, nominated for its art direction/set design, special effects, and sound, losing in all three categories to Ben-Hur.",1359849600,6,1066,4.67741935483871

1817280,4,B00007JMD8,"I've seen this movie a few times, and I still like it, though I'd love to know whose idea it was to have Pat Boone play a Scotsman.  That person should be strung up by his thumbs and lowered slo-o-owly into a seething cauldron of triple-sublimated Fongolium!  James Mason gives a very decent performance, as does the female lead.  Pat Boone's performance isn't TOO bad, but  I still feel the person having him do that quasi-burr deserves to die by the farting squad.  As he lived, so let him die!
All in all, it's not too bad a movie, though some of the special effects leave (quite) a bit to be desired.  Still, I'll give it four stars, because it does have a redeemable entertainment value.  It's a good movie for a quiet afternoon's viewing, and I feel you will enjoy it, in spite of its few shortcomings.",1356912000,2,808,4.418918918918919

The photography is well done, the plot is easy to follow and the special effects are well done for the time at which it was made. I had no issues with the quality of this DVD's color or sound. My personal preference in movies is that they be entertaining without creating a lot of suspense (""Gaslight"", for example, has a lot of suspense), and this movie qualifies.

1817311,5,B00007JMD8,"I'm just finishing up reading Journey to the Interior of the Earth (thanks, Project Gutenberg), which led me to looking for the DVD of the fondly remembered James Mason/Arlene Dahl movie, which I watched countless times years ago.

I think the movie improved on the plot of the book (sorry, Jules Verne), by adding in the magnificent Arlene Dahl, and James Mason was always a pleasure to watch and added dimensions to the Professor character that were not there in the book.  I still mourn poor Gertrude and feel fury at her murderer.  Peter Ronson (Hans) apparently decided not to pursue a film career, which I think is a loss for us, if not for him.

My recollection of the special effects is that they were superb, and the DVD lives up to that.  There is a great deal to be said for the special effects in this movie and Forbidden Planet vs. the Lego-like stuff that passes for special effects in Star Wars, for example, which also drowns out the characters.",1327190400,2,961,4.563953488372093

1817323,5,B00007JMD8,"Jules Verne is my second favorite classic science fiction author behind H G Wells. Verne wrote INMO one of his best classics in Journey to the Center of the Earth.

James Mason was superb as the Scottish Sir Lindenbrook and  leader of the expedition. Pat Boone was very good as Alex, his student and expedition member. Arlene Dahl was great as the widow of the murdered Professor Guteborg from Stockholm.

This story took place in 1880 , part in Edinburgh Scotland and Professor Guteburg from Stockholm Sweden. I have been to both cities a few times and they are two of my favorite European cities. The acting and plot were superb as well as the color and audio. A great DVD. Lots of action with Dinosaurs, giant mushrooms, and brilliant gems.

We see the race to follow the 300 year old Scot Sacknassum into the center of the Earth starting from a crater in Iceland. Professor Lindenbrook's student Alex( Pat Boone) finds a heavy piece of lava and gives it to the professor as part of his gift from his students for getting Knighted. Pat Boone sings a nice song (I like some of Pat Boone's songs)to his girl friend in the beginning of the movie and he eventually marries her. Inside the piece of lava is a plumb bob with insription how to get to the center of the Earth by Sacknassum. Prof Lindenbrook mails info to Prof Guteborg in Stockholm. The Swedish professor bolts to Iceland to be the first to the center of the Earth. Unknown to each expedition; there is an evil murderous Count Sacknassum who poisons Prof Goteborg as Count Sacknassum believes he is the king of volcanoes and believes the underground world is his alone.

So now the widow of Prof Goteborg forces herself to be a member of Prof Lindenbrook's expedition in exchange for all her late husband's supplies. They find a big blond Icelander named Hans with his pet duck Gertrude. Together the Lindenbrrok expedition goes underground and encounters the murderous Count and his dead servant. The Count and the Lindenbrook expedition eventually team up and face giant Dinosaurs, rediscover the lost city of Atlantis and sail on an underground ocean and find the center of the Earth. I won't ruin the superb ending for you.

Here is a classical sci fi DVD I would rate in the top 10 science fiction movies of ALL time. No four letter words, no sex (just some kissing) or nudity. Great for all members of the family. A great DVD to add to your classic science fiction collection. Rated 5 stars.",1325808000,2,2459,4.628440366972477

The concept has been proven to be total cow-pats and I admit some of the sets and effects lack conviction. The screen play had been drastically 'Hollywood-ized' from the original book (although the book gets a bit dreary at times). A singing, strapping, sun-tanned Pat Boone as a Scottish science student beggars belief! And that so-called Scottish accent, talk about miss-casting! But none of the aforementioned reduces my liking for this classic in the slightest. James Mason holds the whole thing together for my money and the restoration is first-class. The recent re-make was slick and cool, and its 3D was great, but my heart belongs to the original.",1322956800,,762,4.869230769230769

1817327,5,B00007JMD8,"I grew up watching this film every time it came on TV. I have never out grown this classic. None of the various ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" films are accurate adaptations of the book. In fact I was a bit disappointed reading the book after seeing the film. It lacked the drama and conflict of the motion picture. The acting was great, even down to the supporting cast.

I have always believed this is a film that could be done better with all the modern CG stuff. To date it hasn't. While the backdrop has gotten better, the storyline and acting does not come up to snuff with this 1959 studio film where the rocks are flat and smooth for safe walking. The soundtrack is the old time drama/thriller music used in every film. It worked very well.

For my money, this is the one to own. Good movie for the whole family to enjoy.",1313798400,,835,4.2784810126582276

The effects are claymay, but when I was growing up(even in the '70's past the date of this movie) that was still a spectacular effect.  Ray Harryhausen's motion claymation carried over well into the 1980's until CGI took over even in Star Wars claymation was used in monsters before Lucas spraypainted his sneakers.(so to speak). This is not Ray Harryhausen's work  Jason and the Argonnauts, Golden Voyage of Sinbad(and others I have yet to watch but will be finding them soon) utilise the lion's share of work from Harryhausen. Many others adopted this style and technique. Many films like this utilized claymation for monsters and effect. Aside from solid acting from everyone, this has a lot of action(for it's time swinging a torch was a lot of action) and grande special effects in the form known as ""trick photography"" and adheards as much as can be in a movie to the abridged novel by Jules Verne. I wish it had been given the 5.1 treatment as did ""Tima Machine""/War of the Worlds(George Pal).

1817330,5,B00007JMD8,"After Verne's original novel appeared in 1864, along comes Henry Levin's 1956 movie version, starring James Mason (Professor Lindenbrook) and Pat Boone.  Based upon Verne's original novel and staying true, to some extent, to the original book (which has not fared well as compared to Verne's other novels in light of 20th century geological discoveries about Earth's interior), the journey underground is well portrayed on the cinema screen.  Using both studio and real cavern scenes (Carlsbad Caverns), the story holds your attention, including the special effects (pre-computer Jurassic Park) dinosaurs.  Unlike the original character's in Verne's novel, most of these characters are adventurous and eager to explore underground, including an additional villain for suspense and treachery.  I enjoyed the original in the 50's, my kids enjoyed the VHS version, and my grandkids especially enjoyed the DVD version (including the eagerly-anticipated very lizard-like dinosaurs!).  The dvd runs well on a blu-ray player and flat-screen TV (HD).  I just wish there was a digitally-enhanced blu-ray version with deeper color and enriched sound of this movie version.

It was playing in downtown Philadelphia at the long-since-shuttered Arcadia Theatre on Chestnut St. I was blown away by its then imaginative special effects as well as the imposing score by Bernard Herrmann. The story and acting by James Mason, Arlene Dahl, Pat Boone, and the rest were also excellent.

In its 1998 DVD restoration, the color and sound are spectacularly life-like. Compared to its 2007 re-make, it appeals to all ages, not just those under 14. Sure, its effects now look primitive, if not tacky, in places, but the overall effect of the film retains its power, to those not completely jaded by CGI. Its treatment of women is pass to say the least, but Arlene Dahl proves more than a match for the cantankerous Prof. Lindenbrook of James Mason.

JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH (1959), based on the classic Jules Verne novel, was one of the most expensive and top-grossing Fox productions of the decade.

With a team of explorers, including science student Alec McKuen (Pat Boone) and widowed Carla Gteborg (Arlene Dahl), the quest begins...

Unlike the recent Brendan Fraser ""remake"", this version of the story is charming, engaging and features some very impressive miniature and matte painting effects.  Primarily filmed on location in Carlsbad National Park, the cavern scenes are breathtaking.  James Mason and Arlene Dahl have a fantastic rapport.

1817391,5,B00007JMD8,"I remember this movie vividly from my childhood and its frequent TV reruns, this one and the 1954 classic--whaddaya know, also starring James Mason, and adapted from Jules Verne--<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/20-000-Leagues-Under-The-Sea/dp/B00005JKU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">20,000 Leagues Under The Sea</a>.  Both are classics with giant monsters, super-cool fantasy vistas, and good, red-blooded adventure.  This film endures to this day as largely harmless family fare; my 10- and 12-year-olds even enjoyed it.

The story: there's a big hole, and some intrepid European scientists crawl on down inside following a mythical path, and just to see what's down there.  It's magnificent, spooky, dangerous, and thrilling, and an evil competitor, monsters and Atlantis are thrown in, too.

Set in the late 1880s, this film now seems to be a late 50s homage to a far more simple and clearly more respectful time, before world wars and before Communism, when the British Empire was king, er, emperor.  Mason is fantastic here as the stiff upper everything Sir Oliver Lindenbrook, coming off his turn as the wonderfully smooth yet purely cruel foreign bad guy in the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-By-Northwest/dp/B0002IQEHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North By Northwest</a>.

Our bad guy in this film is just too perfect.  Poor Thayer David is the wonderfully pompous Count Saknussem.  Physically, he's chubby, with beady eyes, and tight bad guy lips, reminiscent of Telly Savalas' ultra-slimy Blofeld in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Her-Majesty-s-Secret-Service/dp/6302380596/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</a>.  The count has got a bad haircut, pressed flat to his round head.  He's got that spoiled man-child look, with the outdated high-waisted pants to emphasize his girth.  He's a brat boy all grown up, taking what he wants, with no remorse over how he gets it.  One of the best parts of the movie is when he starts in on the typical bad guy monologue, and accuses Mason's Sir Oliver of being so bourgeois, which makes the count a commie, no less.  Given its 1950s setting, you can't help but think it was intentional.  So, in the battle of capitalism versus communism, who do you think is going to win?  I could feel Ike smiling down on us from his white-bread heaven.

Arlene Dahl is massively hot throughout this film, with that long, often piled-up red hair, her strangely, mysteriously unidentifiable accent, not quite Icelandic but so sexily foreign (she was originally from Minne-sohta, don'cha know).  Her makeup and wardrobe are impeccable throughout, tiny of waist and big of bosom.  She was a magnificent 30 when she made this film.  Strangely, she often comes across in the movie as physically bigger than Mason, who was 5'11"", but she was 5'6"".  Maybe it's the force of her character, or maybe it's all that balled-up hair.

The interplay between Mason and Dahl's characters is fun to watch, if anything as a 1950s interpretation of late 19th century courting rituals.  I mean, how hot was it in 1959 to have Mason order her to remove her corset?  A man ordering a woman to remove a part of her fundamental underclothing, and then her remain without it for the remainder of the voyage--whoa.  We even get the money shot; the sadly doomed Gertrude the duck dragging the still warm unspeakables through the mysterious underground depths (at which the men smile both good naturedly and knowingly).

Watching Dahl throughout the film, just when we're going to get the hot sex object payoff on the beach, to see Dahl spent and dripping wet, so thoroughly moist and exhausted after the sensual and tense struggle with the massive whirlpool at the very center of the earth, her makeup still so masterfully constructed, you can see how her arm has been so carefully placed and how the sand has been mounded up strategically to prevent any view of what I'm sure is magnificent cleavage.  Sure, we can have Pat Boone without his shirt and most of his clothes for most of the film, even stark naked at the end, but we can't see what Arlene had to offer the eventually lucky Sir Oliver.  Thanks, 1950s prudishness.

And what of Hans, the gold-toothed Icelandic yokel?  He's a little bit comic relief, and a lot of pure manual labor.  I guess on some level he represents the untamed depths of the planet itself, but he comes across most of the time as a smiling, jabbering dimwit.  But man, does he love that duck.

Watching this film today, it's a little disturbing to see how the ""giant lizards"" are treated.  Of course, they're just normal lizards, blue-screened into the shots to become the horrible giant monsters.  When our heroes throw harpoons into the beast on the beach, it's painfully obvious that steel darts are being fired into the real studio lizard.  And at the end, the red-painted (lead paint, probably) lizard in the Atlantis chamber gets overwashed with lava, which to my mind looks an awful lot like steaming-hot asphalt with red dye in it.  Sure, they're just lizards, but it's also very plain to see that these critters are being maimed and/or killed.  I'm reminded of the very seldom seen 1970s schlock-horror&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Food-of-the-Gods/dp/B000RO9PV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Food of the Gods</a>, with the gigantic bunnies and especially the up-sized rats being blasted--and I do mean physically blasted--as they climbed about on the miniaturized cabin; that's why you never see that one on television.

All in all, it's a fun film, fantasy and schmaltz all the way, and often just plain defying the laws of physics, with a score to match from the soaring symphony blast of discovery and adventure to the low-end warbles filling out the menace of the man-eating lizards.  It's true family fare, even with the poor lizards being abused, where the happy ending is never in doubt and the bad guy soon enough gets what he deserves.",1221091200,4,6108,5.348326359832636

1817397,5,B00007JMD8,"I first saw Journey to the Center of the Earth on a Saturday afternoon at the Roxy Theatre in Pacific Beach, California.  The movie was a profound visual experience to me and at the age of eleven made a lasting impression.

Based on a Jules Verne story of the same name, the movie is a fairly fast paced adventure.  Though it moves a little slowly in the beginning, preliminary scenes build in drama and promise that much adventure is to be forthcoming.

It all starts with a lump of suspiciously heavy lava that is given to Professor Lindenbrook (James Mason) by Alec McKuen (Pat Boone) a student in one of his geology classes.  The gift is from the class in recognition of Lindenbrook's recent knighting.  Puzzled that the lava is heavier than it should be, Lindenbrook chips a small portion of the lava away only to find an object at the center of the sample.  Eventually a plumb-bob is discovered with a message inside and that cryptic message ultimately sends Lindenbrook and young McKuen to Iceland for the journey of a life time.  Of course, there is treachery along the way and other sinister forces at work. In the end the group who make the trip to the center of the earth grows to five; Lindenbrook, McKuen, and Carl Goteborg (Arlene Dahl) along with a large Icelander Hans Belker (Peter Ronson) and his pet duck, Gertrude (Gertrude).  Though rather simplistic in what is conceived to be at the center of the earth, the movie is charming and certainly worth the cost of taking it home.

Some reviewers have been quick to point out the simplistic special effects.  Given the fact that the movie was released in 1959 I think the criticism is uncalled for.  For its time, Journey to the Center of the Earth has held up quite well and will entertain children and adults even today.  There is very little blood, and no language that would make a parent blush, nor is there any overt sexual content.

Part of what makes this movie such a wonderful experience is the terrific soundtrack.  Hermann Bernard captures the essence of what a trip to the center of the earth would be like by the use of moody and atmospheric music.  The music is such a part of the experience that when I saw the movie Vertigo as an adult I immediately recognized a similarity between that soundtrack and that of Journey to the Center of the Earth.  Well, why not?  Both movies were scored by Bernard.

Obviously, Journey to the Center of the Earth is a product of a Hollywood of a different era; a different generation of filmmakers.  Journey stands as a testament to better days as do hundreds of other films.

I highly recommend.

1817398,5,B00007JMD8,"Quite simply, the greatest film ever.  OK, maybe my favorite film.  I used to pore through the Sunday television supplement in the paper hoping to see Journey To The Center Of The Earth listed.

Great Carlsbad Caverns scenery.  James Mason portrayed the scientist as a brave leader.  Pat Boone was actually good; he was given but one showcase song.  Arlene Dahl was allowed to hold her own with the men.  You cannot describe Journey as having a feminist outlook, but it certainly was better than The Time Machine.  Peter Belker was good portraying a character who spoke only Icelandic (from what I understand, Icelandic is medieval Norwegian.)  Who knows, he could have been speaking the language for all I know.  Thayer David was a multi-dimensional villain.  Pure evil would have been distracting.

There is action, adventure and Pat Boone takes his shirt off for an hour.  There was romance and as a young child it was not too bad.

Who can forget Gertrude, the duck?

Over two hours, but it did not lose my attention.",1217116800,2,1021,4.7542857142857144
1817399,2,B00007JMD8,"An adventurous science fiction film, 1959's Journey to the Center of the Earth is perhaps the most accurate adaptation of the outstanding Jules Verne novel of the same name. With Academy Award-nominated special effects, stunning sets, and monstrous prehistoric creatures, the film is smartly paced and essential viewing for fans of the story. Much of the dialogue attests to its age, and the many excuses to squeeze star Pat Boone's singing into the film might lessen its chance of appealing to newer audiences, but as a nostalgic Harryhausen-esque venture, it doesn't disappoint.

In 1880 Edinburgh, Sir Oliver Lindenbrook (James Mason, who takes second billing) discovers a plumb bob buried in a piece of lava rock, with a written clue from an Icelandic scientist who believed that a world existed within Earth. He sends it away to an expert for closer examination, only to discover that that expert, Professor Goteborg, has scurried away to Snaeffels to begin a journey to reach the center of the earth on his own.

Intent on besting his competition, Lindenbrook embarks on his own mission of discovery, taking his good friend and student Alec McEwen (Pat Boone) along for the ride. Before their descent into a vast crater gateway even begins, murder and deception lashes out, revealing a traitorous competitor also vying for the discovery. Goteborg turns up dead, and his widow Carla (Arlene Dahl) demands to accompany the group. Joined by trustworthy muscleman Hans (Peter Ronson) and his pet duck Gertrude, the foursome set out to retrace a vanished scientist's steps to making history.

It's no musical, but Boone quickly starts things off with the love song ""Red Red Rose"" for his bride-to-be Jenny. There's evening singing to Lindenbrook as he is congratulated for his recent knighthood. And never is the opportunity missed for a quick song as the group descends the volcanic crater. Is any of this in the novel? Despite the capitalizing on singing talents, the film follows more closely to the source material than any other theatrical adaptation. Seemingly misplaced humor is also thrown in, as well as ample reserves of romance. But when the film finally gets to the world within the world, it's solid science fiction and adventure.

The sets are impressive and memorable (Carlsbad Caverns served as many of the backgrounds), with giant mushroom forests, an ocean of the underworld, and the crumbled lost city of Atlantis. More exciting still is the inclusion of monstrous lizards and prehistoric creatures. Rather than stop-motion, the special effects include adding prosthetics to real reptiles, and superimposing their humongous images over the wide shots of our tiny heroes.

There's always time for tea with this group, moments for breaking out into song, terribly annoying sound effects and booming music (especially when chased by reptilian horrors), unexplainable conveniences for survival, an Indiana Jones boulder chase, and the typical ""woman falling on the ground during an escape."" But Journey to the Center of the Earth is still entertaining fantasy in that it brings to life the ideas explored in the Jules Verne classic science fiction novel.

While the prelude to the journey is too long (we even have to endure Pat Boone croon a tuneless number), once we've plunged into the Earth, the film takes on an air of wonderment.

While the special effects are often praised, I think much of the wonder and awe of the film comes from the elaborate sets. And credit should also go to the music of Bernard Herrmann -- I doubt that had a better vehicle for his mystical, sonorous music.

Cast chemistry contributes in a big way. James Mason, a brooding but stout leader. Pat Boone, surprisingly effective as an eager student (but not so successful as a Scotsman). Arlene Dahl, a ravishingly beautiful damsel who is sage and sane and only distressed when she really really needs to be. Real-life Icelander Peter Ronson, a tall man's man -- who loves his pet duck.

It captivated my imagination in so many ways and after viewing it repeatedly within the last few years after getting it on DVD I have to say it completely stands the test of time.  I wouldn't change a single thing about the characters, actors chosen to play them, the plot, the special effects, anything.  It all fits together perfectly, like in the same way Goonies and Ghostbusters did.  Plus the soundtrack is phenomenal.  Every time I hear an excerpt from it I get sucked back into the movie.  It's perfect music for the journey.

The screenplay is excellent.  It has the right amount of scientific basis, comedy spots here and there, intelligent lines, logical dialog, and the best possible way of telling a story about a journey to the center of the Earth.  I'm no scientist, but I'm pretty sure the center of the earth is molten and extremely hot and not possible to get to.  So the story in general cannot actually happen in real life.  But that doesn't matter.  the story here is presented in the best possible way that it *could* happen if it were a possibility.  And presented in a way most people would actually want it to happen.

The reason I love older adventure movies more than newer ones is because they didn't have computer effects to use so they made every thing, which in turn gave it a more tangible quality and made it more real.  Most of the special effects completely hold up.  The lizards seem real, the ocean scenes and the journey down all seem extremely real.

It's a top notch production all the way through.  Every now and then the stars align on a film and it surely did with this one.  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  I like it even more than ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" which is another Mason classic.

1817433,3,B00007JMD8,"This movie is not for everyone.  As several of the comments on this site seem to indicate, the film is most powerful for those who remember watching it as a child.  It is a nostalgic piece of cinema, one that pays tribute to the truly imaginative nature of Hollywood films in the 1950s.  JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH is certainly an imaginative film, one that seems to echo the original magic and optimism of the Verne novel.  While certainly not an accurate reproduction of the book, JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH does manage to weave an interesting tale in its own right, introducing villains, characters, and plot twists that are simply absent in Verne's story.  I can remember reading the Verne novel as a kid and there is something about Verne's (at times) stilted writing that is best captured in the early film adaptations.  While more modern efforts can certainly outperform the classics when it comes to special effects and realism, they simply can't capture the nineteenth century feel of the novels in the same way that classic cinema can, with its nave effects and storytelling.

The story begins in Scotland, where we are introduced to Professor Lindenbrook (James Mason), a recently knighted professor, famous for his scientific accomplishments.  A young student of his, Alec McEwan (Pat Boone) presents the professor with a gift to honor his recent accomplishment: a rare piece of volcanic rock, unusual for its weight properties.  The professor immediately becomes transfixed by the rock, convinced that there must be something quite heavy inside.  Upon closer inspection, Lindenbrook discovers a plumb bob buried inside.  There is an inscription on the device, penned by a famous Icelandic scientist almost three hundred years earlier, Arne Saknussem.  The message confirms Saknussem's theory that beneath the earth's surface lies a mysterious world, for Saknussem claims to have found the passage and actually visited the center of the earth himself!  With his dying breath, he has mysteriously written down the directions for finding the entrance tunnel.  Immediately, Lindenbrook is completely overwhelmed by this discovery.  The world laughed at the ridiculous theories of Arne Saknussem until he mysteriously disappeared, never to be seen again.  The professor vows to take an expedition there himself to confirm the ancient scientist's previous journey.

The plot thickens when Lindenbrook writes about his findings to an eminent Swedish scientist by the name of Professor Goetaborg.  After two weeks of receiving no response, Lindenbrook receives a message from the University of Stockholm informing him that Professor Goetaborg mysteriously disappeared around the time he received Lindenbrook's first letter.  Suddenly, Lindenbrook realizes that Goetaborg has gone to Iceland in order to beat Lindenbrook to the discovery!  The race is on to discover the center of the earth!

After arriving in Iceland with his dedicated student Alec McEwan, Lindenbrook finds that Goetaborg has already been there.  They quickly try to obtain supplies to prepare for their incredible journey, but run into various troubles.  Time is running out; Saknussem's message says that the sun will point the way on the final day of May.  In the meantime, Goetaborg winds up dead in his hotel room, the victim of cyanide poisoning.  Professor Lindenbrook realizes that he and Goetaborg are not alone on this journey.  There is a mysterious third party who seems ready to stop at nothing (not even murder) to beat everyone to the center of the earth.  What follows is a rollicking adventure as Professor Lindenbrook, Alex McEwan, Hans Belker (a hired Icelandic hand), and Carla Goetaborg (the wife of the recently deceased professor who forces herself into the expedition by offering her husband's equipment to the newcomers) head down into the abyss.  They struggle against nature and the mysterious third party, discovering worlds far below the surface, battling ancient reptilian monsters, sailing a vast underground sea, and touring the ancient city of Atlantis.

Overall, I enjoyed JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.  It is believable and there are times when I was completely drawn into the underground world and adventure.  James Mason plays a very believable Professor Lindenbrook, a man of his time, obsessed with science, and full of adventure and daring.  Pat Boone is also quite convincing, even if the film does provide him with several forced opportunities to croon his way into the hearts of young moviegoers.

The quality of this DVD is top-notch.  Comparisons to old transfers reveal that this new restoration is immensely improved.  If you grew up watching the Sunday matinee performances of this film, you would do well to purchase this restored DVD.  My one gripe is that the sound could have been enhanced for home audio systems.  The dialogue is a bit echo-ey and I had to turn off my 5.1 system in order to enjoy the film in stereo.  If you enjoy the many fifties adaptations of Verne's novels, you will love JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.",1173657600,9,5078,5.140073081607795
1817434,5,B00007JMD8,"I had many good memories of this movie from childhood and was glad to see it was still available for sale.  James Mason has always been one of my favorites, and the story always captivated me.  The DVD is of good quality and the audio is quite clear.

I guess what stuck in my mind watching this movie as an adult was how wholesome everything was.  No cynicism or nihilism, no hard language.  The heroes were really heroic and the villain truly villanous.  It can't be seen as an instructional video on the Earth's core, of course (though if you're a fan of steampunk and/or scientific romances, it might be :) ), but it doesn't claim to be such.  It was a fantasy for fantasy's sake (at least that's how I see it from my modern perspective).  You'll have no problems with all age groups seeing this.

In short, it's a fun movie whose story couldn't help but grow in the telling.  I think anyone who watches it will edified.  Maybe even Verne himself would have approved.",1171929600,,971,4.429378531073446

1817436,5,B00007JMD8,"Back in the 70's, before cable had arrived, our local channels always had sci-fi, western, and combat flicks as The Sunday Afternoon At The Movies. Many sci-fi flicks like Mysterious Island, Jason and The Argonauts, 7th Voyage Of Sinbad had graced the ""color"" television screen. Journey To The Center Of The Earth was definitely one of those memorable afternoon flicks. (My living room hassock got more wear and tear from sitting on the floor watching fables such as these).

There's alot of talk at the beginning, and alot of decision making concerning the attempted journey. But once you get to the rolling boulder sequence, the movie itself goes on a roll.

I'm not too picky about incredible special effects, as long as what is presented is a true means of telling a story. There are many instances where one can nit-pick, but why bother? The whole ideal is make believe, and if it can indeed take me with it, I have no complaints.

1817441,5,B00007JMD8,"It's been a long time since I've seen this old classic and I must say I'm amazed at the work that was done to restore this old film.  The quality is great, even when viewed on my plasma screen TV!  Even the behind the scenes features were very enjoyable.

Keep in mind that this motion picture film was the first real attempt to capture the novel into a silver screen format. Naturally, the 2007 remake starring Brendon Fraser, Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem is well beyond this in terms of visual effects. Still, this film's set designs and matting work is exceptional when CGI didn't exist and very well done for its day.

I was a big James Mason fan as a boy.  Talk about an accomplished actor!  Along with Colleen Dewhurst and Seth Green, James Mason has a face that just draws you into him.  This is the type of man, who if he sold you the moon and gave you a signed contract, you'd believe him, just by the integrity that shines from his face.

This movie is a simple story line about a few explorers who take on the impossible, as well as improbable journey to the center of the earth, while following the pathway of a previous explorer, Arnie Sackhousen, and what they learn along the way. Like I said, the set work and matt work are impecible for its time. The costumes, depicting the clothes of the time are lovely to see. Even the color chemistry developed for this film was exceptional for its day.  This pretty well ranked up there with Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" in terms of story chemistry and actor chemistry.  Well, worth the price of admission.

There is no real violence to say of in this film.  Most is simply character development and the unfolding of a mystery, as the characters journey to the ""center"" of the earth to see what they might learn. I won't wreck the story for you, but if you like awesome underground scenes, like you see in the Sequoia Caverns, Giant real mushrooms and live dinosaurs; you'll enjoy this film.  Also if you are not the scholastic type, this film is not for you; but if you are, you'll enjoy the story and the acting very much.

No complaints: The DVD cover and resolution are excellent.  Will make a great addition to my home library!  Thanks for making it available on Amazon! No complaints on the purchase price either.",1167782400,2,2289,4.4795180722891565
1817452,4,B00007JMD8,"It is heartening to add my review to so many others; for many years I thought I was the only person who admired this movie (it's hardly EVER on television).  Part science fiction, part geology lecture, part mystery, and a little bit corny (Pat Boone sings!), the durable Jules Verne tale comes alive thanks to Henry Levin's brisk direction backed by his imaginative band of art directors and surprisingly good FX specialists. Most importantly though is the incomparable James Mason in the lead as the sage Professor Oliver Lindbrook, leader of the expedition to the center of the Earth. At a time when many aging leading men (Mason was 50 at the time he took this part), desperate for leading roles, sleepwalked through disdained science fiction parts, Mason threw himself into the role with an enthusiasm that seems to infect the rest of the players. David Thayer plays the antagonist Count Saknussem with equal measure.  I saw it with my family at the magnificent Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles when I was nine years old. It was a day and a movie I will never forget.",1166486400,2,1070,4.747311827956989

1817454,5,B00007JMD8,"""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"" is a 1959 adaption of Jules Verne's sci-fi novel of the same name. It's been a favorite of mine from when I was a kid. It used to be on late on the TV, and I'd stay up to see how far into the night (and into the earth) I could get. I couldn't get to the end for quite a while, I kept falling asleep! It's great to see it really nicely restored and on DVD.

Professor Lindenbrook (James Mason) has just been given a gift by his associate Alec McEwen (Pat Boone), in celebration of his recent knighthood. It is an Icelandic rock, with something manmade lodged inside of it. Lindenbrook blows the rock up and discover its an object that once belonged to, and is insribed by the famous vulcanologist Saknussem, who disappeared some years ago. The inscription reveals the location of the entrance to a fissure in Iceland leading straight to the centre of the Earth. Lindenbrook decides to go to the fissure, taking Alec along for the ride. Their expedition is not the only one interested in the Icelandic fissure, and the pair of adventurers will have to deal with competition and sabotage, and that's not all. There are wonders deep within the Earth, caverns of crystal, ceilings of salt and giant mushroom forests, but there are also just as many dangers. Will the Lindenbrook expedition make it to the centre of the Earth, and if they do, what will they find there?

There's a cheeky sort of feel to this film. Though it's not a comedy, there's a fair bit of humour for an adventure story (the ""morse code"" scene with Gertrude the Duck, for instance). James Mason plays Professor Lindenbrook really well, and makes a good leader for the group. I love the dynamic between the characters, and the dialogue, the sets and the surprises the deeper they go into the Earth. Gets the imagination going, there could be all sorts of things in those unexplored caves in the background. Jules Verne was really onto something when he wrote the original novel.

Definitely worth seeing for fans of adventure and sci-fi. I'd also recommend checking out Rick Wakeman's ""Journey To The Centre of the Earth"" album, which is a piece of music based based around Verne's story (unrelated to the music in this film, though).",1163808000,,2237,4.601503759398496

The sets are lavish and atomospheric and the characters are intelligent and resourceful,even Pat Boone.

1817468,5,B00007JMD8,"Jules Verne was my favorite author when I was a kid.  Therefore, I always watched films based on the his books.  This was one of my favorite.  Verne created the science fiction genre.  What Verne did best was to keep things in his era.  His films were not set in the future but in his present, the Victorian era.

Journey is set in the 1880's.  Sir Oliver Lindenbrook (James Mason) is a professor of geology at Edinburgh University.  Alec McEwen (Pat Boone) is his top student, who happens to be in love with the professor's daughter Jenny (Diane Baker).

Sir Oliver's students give him a present for his Knighthood.  Alec used the rest of the money to get Sir Oliver a piece of volcanic stone.  Sir Oliver tests the rock and finds out that there is something inside the rock.  It's a top from Iceland signed by lost scientist Arnie Sagknason.  This leads the professor, Alec and Jenny to search for the center of the Earth.  On the way they pick up Mme. Guffenberg (Arlene Dahl) whose husband was using Sir Oliver's information to mount his own expedition.

This film is fun and has great special effects, especially for 1959.  You might think that they are by Ray Harryhausen but they are actually by L.B. Abbott who would win Oscars for films like Tora! Tora! Tora! and The Posiedon Adventure.

This film is a great adventure film, a great science fiction film and a great film for all ages.

1817469,5,B00007JMD8,"A great example of what classic Hollywood did best, this movie is loads of old-fashioned fun, which thrilled me as a little kid & still provides plenty of enjoyment today. Scientifically it's preposterous, of course; but as a dreamlike journey, a literal evocation of the Unknown, filled with wonders & mysterious sights every step of the way, it's an absolute delight. Forests of giant mushrooms -- glittering caves of gigantic, multi-colored jewels & glistening fountains -- a labyrinth of twisting, bone-like branches & dunes of salt -- an underground ocean lit by bioluminescent fungus -- the lost city of Atlantis -- all this & more, including a gorgously ominous, majestic score by Bernard Hermann! The special effects are impressive for their time, and still hold up reasonably well even now. Let's face it, ""cutting edge"" special effects will always be dated with time -- what counts is whether they provide a genuine ""sense of wonder."" And this movie has plenty to spare!

No, they just don't make 'em like this today -- why, the movie spends at least half an hour or more just introducing the characters, letting us get to know them, before actually sending them on their journey underground! But it all works very well, with the actors giving their all -- James Mason is strong, classy, utterly convincing; and even then-teen idol Pat Boone is very good as his young assistant. Toss in a brilliant, ruthless, creepy villain (the superbly cast Thayer David), as well as a feisty, strong-willed, beautiful widow (Arlene Dahl) -- and not forgetting Gertrude the duck! -- and a splendid time is guaranteed for all.

1817474,4,B00007JMD8,"Journey to the Center of the Earth is one of a great many movie adaptations of Jules Verne's stories. It has many strong points and is quite enjoyable to watch despite the clearly dubious science behind many of the situations. The basic premise is a geologist finds a plumb bob with Scandinavian markings in the middle of a piece of volcanic rock. This leads him to believe that the story of another scientist's journey deep into the earth was not only possible but a success. He then embarks on his own journey with one of his students and the widow of a man who planned a similar expedition (who he discovers was murdered).

Despite the many out of place situations, it's good fun to watch the expedition's progress. This movie, and many like it from the same era, could only be made in its own time period before audiences became too sophisticated and cynical to just sit back and enjoy the wonders of someone's imagination. There's an innocent joy in forgetting about dissecting the validity of the events and simply savoring what is going on on the screen.

The only thing that undermines the film in my opinion is the way in which Pat Boone was used to lure a different demographic to the movie. There are a few scenes where he's crooning which seem very out of place. Also, his Scottish accent seems to come and go very frequently which reminds the viewer that he's an American pop idol cast in the role to please young females rather than a real actor.

James Mason is excellent as the professor who leads the expedition. Arlene Dahl (with perfect makeup throughout the trip) also does well as the widow who insists on going along despite the professor's objections. What works surprisingly well is the presence of the character of Hans (who does not speak English) and his pet duck, Gertrude.

This is a fine movie which I'd call a Sci-Fi classic if it weren't for the overtones of an Elvis movie in the musical numbers.",1120521600,5,1929,4.598837209302325
1817475,4,B00007JMD8,"This is for those who are in the process of replacing their old laserdisc films with DVD versions. You should be aware that this DVD is not an improvement over the widescreen laserdisc in every respect. First, the good. There is no question the sharpness and color of this DVD beats out the laserdisc, hands down. Also, whereas the laserdisc print had a significant amount of dirt on the print, it has been all but eliminated with this DVD transfer. Kudos. Beautiful.

But there are two annoying drawbacks to the DVD version. First, the sound. I don't know what was done to the two-channel audio, but on the DVD there is virtually no centralization of dialogue. Dialogue is spread out across all three front channels. This is most annoying, as you cannot escape it throughout the entire film, although you learn to accept it. Second, although the DVD is widescreen, versus the laserdisc you lose a significant amount of the image on the left and right, and to a lesser degree also the top and bottom. In some such cases, this comes down to a question of matting, and it can often be debated which ""widescreen"" version is actually ""correct"". But when I see on this DVD many instances where critical information is lost, which was surely intended to be seen, I believe this DVD was not matted properly. I synched the DVD to play concurrently with my laserdisc, and switched between the two. The DVD has throughout, instances where extreme left, right, top and bottom information is cropped off. For example, view the scene where the explorers are being thrust upward by lava in the altar stone. On the laserdisc, you see the entire breadth of the altar stone. On the DVD, the left and right edges are cut off. Noticeable in other scenes are cropped elbows, heads, missing people, etc.

The extent of this is something one might not find too annoying if one doesn't have another source to compare it to. And the overall quality of the image over the laserdisc still gives the DVD an edge.

1817487,4,B00007JMD8,"Back when I was younger, I dug a hole in the field behind my parent's house...for what reason?  Who knows?  Perhaps it was a meager attempt to uncover fabulous booty left by some long since dead pirates...or maybe I wanted tunnel my way to the kingdom of the mole people, assert my dominance and become their king, but alas I found no such peoples (in retrospect, given the fact I only dug about three feet down, its not surprising the lack of my findings)...but it wasn't a total bust as I did find a decent size ceramic pipe, which I accidentally broke...so what's my point?  I think it relates to this film, Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959) in that man has always had a curious fascination with the unknown and a desire for understand of that which has yet to be explained...based on a novel by Jules Verne and directed by Henry Levin (Where the Boys Are, That Man Bolt), the film stars James Mason (20000 Leagues Under the Sea, North by Northwest), 50's and 60's crooner Pat Boone (State Fair), and Arlene Dahl (Three Little Words), mother of actor Lorenzo Lamas.  Also appearing is Diane Baker (Strait-Jacket, Marnie), Peter Ronson, in his only film role, and Thayer David (House of Dark Shadows, Little Big Man).

The story begins in 1880's Edinburgh as Professor Oliver Lindenbrook (Mason) makes an interesting discovery from a piece of lava rock given to him as a gift from one of his students named Alec McEwen (Boone).  From within the rock comes evidence that a long lost explorer/scientist made it to where no one thought was possible, the very center of the Earth.  Lindenbrook seeks validation from a fellow scientist in Stockholm, but learns the unscrupulous man has taken Lindenbrook's find and plans to exploit it for his own gain.  This forces Linderbrook to mount his own expedition, but the going is difficult as it turns out there is yet a third party interested, one that will resort to any means necessary, even murder, to claim the undiscovered treasures that lie beneath the Earth.

Alright, I'm no science whiz, but I have a pretty good idea this type of journey would be impossible due to the plain fact that as once travels closer to the center of the Earth, the pressure increases...I mean, think about what's involved to turn a piece of coal into a diamond.  Given this, the film requires a great deal of suspension of disbelief, which I had no problem in allowing as this was not only a fantastic production, but also just a really fun movie.  Mason is wonderful as the driven, yet thoughtful scientist not so much interested in personal fame or glory, but the true advancement of science and adding to the collective pool of knowledge for all mankind.  Given the overall importance of the character to the story, the casting of Mason was probably one of the strongest factors in helping create a sense of believability, despite the completely fantastic nature of the story.  As far as Pat Boone as his student, I was a little wary at first, but I think he did very well overcoming any bias I may have had...of course, I don't think you could have had a film in the late 50's with Boone and not have him perform a musical number, but it was worked into the story, and not just a matter of him breaking out into song for no apparent reason.  Given his characters ability, one would think he was missing his calling as a musical artist rather than a junior scientist.  As far as Arlene Dahl, well, I thought she also did well, and if I were going to be stuck under the Earth for an extended period of time, she would certainly be a fine choice as a companion in all of her bosomy goodness.  I really liked the antagonistic character played by Thayer David, although I wished his part was a little bigger, and the character expanded on a little more.  Another aspect that worked really well was the use of the Carlsbad Caverns and the completely alien and otherworldly sets populated by grotesquely huge creatures ravenous for fresh meat.  Which brings me to the one aspect that kind of drew me out of the film in the use of lizards to represent prehistoric creatures.  It did look a little hokey, but then given the film was released in 1959, I think it's a bit like shooting ducks in a barrel to be overly critical of this point, and, I think, one can feel the ambitious nature and effort put into the film which counts for a lot in my book. Despite the nearly 2 hour and 10 minute run time, director Levin keeps the story moving along well focusing not only on the external forces, but the internal conflicts within the group as the expedition is not a short one, but one taking approximately a year to complete.  Which brought forth the question what happens if and when the group actually reaches the center of the Earth?  How in the heck do you get out?

The widescreen picture (2.35:1) looks beautiful on this Fox Home Entertainment DVD, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround comes through very clear.  In terms of the picture quality, there is a special feature that provides a visual restoration comparison showing exactly how poor the source elements were, and the amazing efforts put forth to present what is shown on this DVD.  Given the amount of work done to clean the film up, I was surprised to see so little in terms of other extras, but I am pleased just to have a really good-looking version.  As far as the extras available, there is a trailer for the film, along with trailers for other Fox films including The Abyss (1989), The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Enemy Mine (1985), Independence Day (1996), One Million Years B.C. (1966), Planet of the Apes (both the 1968 and 2001 versions), Wing Commander (1999), and Zardoz (1974).  All in all, if you are looking for a visually exciting, well produced, charming tale of adventure, you can't go wrong with this film.

Viewing it again recently after a long hiatus, I realized that one reason it holds up well is the script, especially the dialog. It is superb. It is intelligent and genuinely witty. It certainly outclasses the majority of contemporary movies. And no wonder, the screenplay is by the same guy who did ""Sunset boulevard"".

1817490,5,B00007JMD8,"Hello everybody! This is one of my definite, all-time favorites. I'm 32 y/o and I still get goose bumps watching this. I have always been fascinated with dinosaurs and stop-motion photography-ala RAY HARRYHAUSEN etc. The DIMETRODONS which were from the PERMIAN PERIOD, resembled the komodo dragons of Asia which obviously were descendents of some type of prehistoric reptile,(maybe DIMETRODONS-however they weren't dinosaurs). This scene was a misnomer due to dinosaurs not existing in the PERMIAN PERIOD.
  Every scene was memorable including the begining sequences- with the Earth spinning while opening credits are rolling to Atlantis blowing up- hence the volcano, to the dinosaur(actually it looked like some type of monitor lizard), protruding it's tongue as ARLENE DAHL gives a blood-curdling scream. This scene is simular to the fiery/dinosaur laden ending of the ""LOST WORLD"" with MICHAEL RENNIE, JILL ST. JOHN AND LORENZO LAMAS SR.(yes it's Lorenzo's father). I believe that came out in 1960 and also one of my favs. The giant mushrooms looked beleveble and the underground spring w/ glistening quartz rocks set was absolutely breath taking. I remeber as kid, drawing every scene and stapling it together as sort of a storyboard picture book. Other films I recommend of this genre are as follows: MYSTERIOUS ISLAND(1960), JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS(1963), THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD(1974),SINBAD AND THE EYE OF THE TIGER(1977), ONE MILLION YEARS B.C.(with RAQUEL WELCH and JOHN RICHARDSON-1966),THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT(1975) and it's sequel THE PEOPLE THAT TIME FORGOT(1977), CLASH OF THE TITANS(1981) and THE 7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD(1956). These films may not have had the incredible and elaborate c.g. of today's big budgeted films, but they posses an innocence in film making which evokes an overall satiated feeling after viewing this film genre.
  I highly recommend this and you'll want to watch this repeatedly as I most certainly do; I always catch something new or a little detail I've never noticed before. -JULIUS-ALLAN",1105488000,3,2037,5.376175548589342
1817491,5,B00007JMD8,It's very easy to take. Jules Verne (author of the book on which it's based) definitely had a mushroom fetish as he shows in this and his Trip to the Moon book. It's nifty to see the future Ben Stokes of Dark Shadows (actor Thayer David) in a role starring opposite both James Mason and Pat Boone (wonder if Pat's daughter later singer Debbie Boone was on set and met them all). The science of the movie is truthfully left a little unexplained (how exactly while underground are they floating on an outdoor river?) but why quibble? A very satisfying late 50's scifi entry.,1102982400,2,572,4.509615384615385

The scenes under the earth were very real looking, except for the mushrooms.  I love Pat Boones singing.  Also the part about adminsitering justice under the earth was thought provoking.  All around good movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  There are giant lizards, so ladies beware.  But overall a very enjoable, suspence filled flick with lots of twists and turns!!!

1817494,4,B00007JMD8,"Fox Studios was so successful with this film that they immediately made another Verne classic, ""The Lost World"" with Claude Raines as Professor Challenger.  ""Lost World"" didn't fare as well.  The reasons were obvious.
""Journey"" was put together by a team of Hollywood professionsls at all levels: script, direction, actors, production deisgners.  They were all dedicated to one goal: to entertain the audience while not pandering to them.  The actors take their roles seriously, bringing them to vivid life.
This is a long film for a general release, family oriented project.  It goes into good, solid character development, rather than settling for action over story, as they did with ""The Lost World.""  The only thing both films have in common appear to be dinosaurs.
The special effects are excellent.  Try not to compare them to what can be computer-generated today.  Matte painting artists of the old Hollywood studio system could truly be called artists; this film is a prime example of this art.
Bernard Hermann's score is one of the true stars of the picture.  It supports the film; it is like a character all its own; it complements the story rather than overpowering it.

1817517,5,B00007JMD8,"This movie captured my imagination as a child, and I'm pleased to say that it retains all its adventurous charm twenty-five years later.
Based loosely on the Jules Verne novel, the movie tells the story of a group of scientists (and a scientist's widow ... and a hunky Icelander ... and a duck) as they follow the trail of a long-dead explorer into - wait for it - the center of the Earth. The film is partly a vehicle for Pat Boone's singing career, partly an excuse to design one fantastic set after another (partly filmed in Carlsbad Cavern National Park), but it's mostly a decent adventure story with the ever-wonderful James Mason leading the way. Sure, some effects are poorly done with blue screens, matte paintings, and miniatures (not bad by late '50s standards, though), but it doesn't take much suspension of disbelief to get into spirit of the thing (my 4-year-old screamed at the Dimetrodons), and an emotional connection is built between the audience and the characters (Count Saknussem's fate is richly deserved). Be sure to watch for Alfred the Butler (Alan Napier) as a University of Edinburgh dean.
The limited bonus materials are all worthwhile (as opposed to DVDs that cram in the extras, mostly mediocre). Included are movie trailers for nine Fox sci-fi movies (Sean Connery's Zardoz must be seen to be believed) as well as the trailer for Journey. The only other bonus is a before-and-after comparison of how the film was restored. There's no documentary showing the process, but the side-by-side and split-screen comparisons help you realize how close this treasure was to being lost.
This is a great film that deserves to be part of anyone's collection. The effects may be dated, but the adventure and characterizations are as powerful today as they were in 1959. If you're looking for a film the whole family can enjoy that isn't so sugary sweet it necessitates a visit to the dentist, Journey to the Center of the Earth fits the bill.",1083283200,6,1961,4.839285714285714

It's amusing that the DVD is titled ""Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth"" since the movie has so little to do with the original book. It's an entertaining piece of work nonetheless, full of danger and courage, surprise and villainy, romance and loyalty, fear and wonder. Menacing dinosaurs and giant mushrooms and glowing crystals and hair-raising plunges and death-defying escapes -- this is a rousing adventure.

I recall being fascinated by the special effects as a child, though now they seem fairly crude. But the plot holds one's interest, Bernard Herrmann's music is beautifully dramatic, and the acting is much better than the average kid flick. James Mason makes a trustworthy professor, and Pat Boone is surprisingly good. The climax is thrilling, if risibly improbable.

It really grabbed my imagination, and I loved James Mason (and yes, even Pat Boone was inoffensive...odd casting choice, but it works).
You can't go wrong with the story...ridiculous as it is.  The party making the journey goes through a lengthy and diverse series of adventures and discoveries.  And today's viewer gets a great lesson in what state of the art special effects were 50 years ago.
So, I recommend the movie for some decent acting and a compelling storyline...but the special effects make it hard to truly suspend ones disbelief.  So don't expect to get truly emotionally involved.

1817526,5,B00007JMD8,"I first saw Journey to the Center of the Earth as part of a dusty collection of VHS tapes our local library would roll out on rainy Sundays for the kids (another classic was Mysterious Island).  I enjoyed it then, so I decided to pick up the DVD.  Not only has the film held up over time, I actually find it more entertaining now than when I was a lad.  The plot, wherein an esteemed Scottish geology professor and his earnest student (Pat Boone) discover a clue that leads them to the center of the Earth, along with a rogue's gallery of other companions, is actually almost believable.  I think that's probably the best that can ever be said about this sort of film, and something that is almost never said of more recent versions.  Along the way naturally the intrepid explorers overcome dangers and obstacles, encounter fabulous natural wonders, and generally have a good time.  The actors really make this film stand out; the special effects are still good but it's the dialogue that speeds the plot along.  I still find myself swept up in their initial hunt for the entrance to the underground caverns, as well as the interactions of our heroes with the primary villian..and of course there is a fun one.  The film also has a well-manicured but playful sense of humor, including a scene where our heroes desperately try in any language to communicate with the tappings of a presumed rescuer, which turns out to be a duck, and another where one love interest is horrified when she (gasp!) accidentally reveals her shapely ankles.
Also, this film has a great sequence that catapults it high into the ranking of that little-known and vastly underappreciated sub-genre:  the ""giant"" lizard film.  You know the ones I mean.  They all have iguanas, typically blue-screened and made up to look like prehistoric dinosaurs of some form, which bound around the place and generally menace our off-screen actors.  Look for close-up shots of ""giant"" lizard mouths and then listen for the screams.  Ahh, it's great.
The DVD itself is fine.  Some of the other reviews take issue with obscure coloring and soundtrack elements that, frankly, I don't think are even noticeable.  The soundtrack is delightfully strident and yet often solemn/morbid, conveying the gradual suffocating effects of hundreds of miles of earth piled above your head as you move deeper.  All in all, I think this is about as entertaining and enjoyable as you're going to get for a premise as patently absurd as walking to the center of the earth.

The picture and audio quality in this CD are well above average and the color tones are vibrant throughout. As always, James Mason delivers a stand-out performance in a film he always disliked. His Scottish accent is a little odd and one wishes he had merely used his own voice, which was so oustanding and memorable. More surprising is the performance of Pat Boone who actually acquits himself well here. Boone is never campy, silly or contrived; he honestly delivers a good all-around performance. His relationship with Mason in the movie unfolds nicely and there's never a forced word of dialogue or campy forays into 1950's kitsch.
The sets are not cheesy at all and hold up well. The special effects are, as one would expect, rather dated, but by 1959 standards, they are exceptional.

Regarding the dinosaurs - in the absence of budget for stop motion animation, they actually did something very clever.  They came up with dinosaurs that DID run about on all fours - dimetrodons.  Rigging up a few iguanas with fins was quite an elegant idea.  At least they weren't dishonest - they didn't call them tyrannosaurs and brontosaurs, like the makers of ""The Lost World"" a year later.",1053907200,2,825,4.571428571428571
1817542,3,B00007JMD8,"It's a fun movie. You can argue with the the ""science""; you can argue with some of the optical effects (the use of poorly matted lizards vs. stop motion animation is a minor drawback to the film)and  you can argue with some of the deviations from Verne's classic novel but none of this off sets the sheer aura of fun that surrounds this 50's classic. Made at the tail end of the science fiction boom that made the cinema profitable again during the threat of television, Journey succeeds through the top flight direction, witty dialog and performances of the cast.
James Mason is perfectly cast as Professor Lidenbrook and Arlene Dahl plays his spirited romantic interest. The plot is fairly well known so I'll stick to the quality of the film, restoration and DVD transfer. Pat Boone's career as an actor was often blighted by his singing career. He wasn't considered a ""serious"" actor. He gives a energetic performance that counter balances Mason's intense take as Liddenbrook.
The direction by Hollywood vet Henry Levin sparkles with a number of inventive set pieces. Michael Todd's spare no expense production allows this lavish production to continue to shine nearly 45 years later. The art direction is often imaginative and, despite the limitations of the time, manage to convey the wonder of Verne's original novel.
The optical effects are quite good half a century later. The matte paintings and miniatures still allow one to suspend disbelief and sink into the world portrayed here. The use of redressed lizards for the grand finale does undermine the conclusion a bit. Surprisingly, Todd and director Levin opted for using this approach instead of the more time consuming stop motion animation of Ray Harryhausen or Willis O'Brien. Although it would have delayed the film a bit and increased the budget as well, this brief sequence would have been more believable and lively if it had been made using O'Brien or Harryhausen.
All of this would have been to no avail if not for Bernard Herrmann's moody, inventive and idiosyncratic score for the film. Herrmann's best scores (North by Northwest, Psycho, Citizen Kane among many other classic scores)helped elevate the quality of many films. Hitchcock, Welles, Ray Harryhausen, Brian DePalma and Martin Scorese all recognized that Herrmann's scores were important characters in the films they directed.
The transfer is beautiful given the age of the original negative and condition of many of the films from this time frame. While the restoraation isn't as rich as that given to cinematic classics like Vertigo and Spartacus, the film benefits from the restoration efforts. The colors are vibrant and rich and, with few exceptions, the transfer is sharp and not as grainy as one would expect (particulary during the optical effects sequences).
The DVD transfer is quite good as well. Again, grain problems to crop up now and again and the widescreen transfer isn't flawless but these are fairly minor complaints. Fox has, on the whole, done a marvelous job restoring this classic adventure film. Sadly, Mason, director Levin and Todd are all deceased so we don't get any first person observations about the production of the film on a second audio track. Since Pat Boone is still very much with us, it would have been interesting to hear his memories on the production of this fine film.
I have very fond memories of watching this on the 3:30 Afternoon movie on KGO-TV in San Francisco (and, if memory serves, a couple of times on John Stanley's Creature Feature program as well). It's a perfect rainy day Saturday movie. It's enjoyable for the kids and, yes, even for this adult despite the wonderous explosion in visual effects over the years. While you're at it, you might also enjoy Jon Amiel's The Core an update of sorts of this classic film. Amiel's film vividly recaptures the sense of wonder and power of this type of film with his modern day take on the same theme.",1051401600,7,3933,4.932126696832579
1817543,4,B00007JMD8,"JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH -- given that among its stars is Pat Boone, and among its special effects are live lizards with rubber fins attached -- is a far better movie than one would expect, even today.  It appeared about a year after special effects extravaganza 7th VOYAGE OF SINBAD, and about a year before the enlarged-lizard silliness with Claude Raines, Jill St. John, and Fernando Lamas in a remake of the THE LOST WORLD -- and yet JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH still works pretty well as entertainment for today's audience.  Of course, JOURNEY also was a product of the heyday of some of the successful Disney live-action family adventures, which this movie probably most closely resembles.
JOURNEY has a good story and some interesting music going for it -- and this is probably the only film using live lizards as dinosaurs where the lizards, with sails atop their backs, actually look something like the dimetrodons they are supposed to represent (if a bit too large).
Even Pat Boone is good in this movie, as is pretty much everyone else.  James Mason is ideal and at least as well cast as he was in 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, and when a redhead lady in a girdle, a Swede with no lines, a goose, and a dastardly villain play your emotions with equal success (and no snickering), you know someone has gotten the tone right.
The widescreen and color are excellent.  The DVD presentation manages to preserve the color well, by the way (the movie has a rather wondrously gaudy look, for a film that takes place mostly in caves (!), and the Technicolor seems to have been well preserved).
In short, a film that is audacious in scope from a time that produced a number of movies that seem dated today holds up surprisingly well and is still a fun adventure diversion.",1051401600,2,1790,4.601880877742946
1817544,5,B00007JMD8,"Although it deviates (!) from Verne's story, this film is a classic. James Mason does his usual outstanding acting -- for once as a good guy rather than a villain -- and there's a good bit of humour, not least provided by Pat Boone as one of Mason's students. Suspend disbelief for an afternoon and watch this light romp. Rated 'G' for sure.",1050624000,,341,4.428571428571429
1817545,4,B00007JMD8,"I really do have to say that the Dvd-drive in review did not fully give this film justice even with its glowing review.  The special effects are still incredible (yes, except for those lizards, but more about that later) and the sets were flawless and fake in a Wonka sorta way which lent a wonderful real/unreal quality to the film.  By now you know everything about this film from the other reviews, so I'll not take up your time to restate what they said.  A great family film it is because it's enough to keep the adults riveted with the plotline and enough to keep the kids riveted by the visuals.  I would've given this film 5 stars, however, but do keep in mind that this film does feature a couple iguanas being mistreated so I've had to deduct a star- not exactly a PETA friendly flick.  But it ain't Cannibal Ferox so go with it and have yourself a blast!!",1050105600,2,866,4.354037267080745
1817546,4,B00007JMD8,"""Journey To The Center Of The Earth"" was a big hit when released in theatres in 1959, and it's easy to see why. This is a good, old-fashioned adventure story from that great pioneer of sci-fi/fantasy story-telling--Jules Verne.
First of all, the movie looks gorgeous, and much work was put into restoring its glory for DVD. One of the extras demonstrates the difference between old video versions and the DVD in terms of picture quality--the contrast is stunning. The sound is also excellent for a film of this age and, with Bernard Herrmann's memorable score, this is important.
The sets and matte paintings are top-notch, as we follow our heroes ( and a villain ) through a maze of caverns, deeper into the earth. Many obstacles are waiting for them, and there is a sense of excitement throughout. Special effects are fine for the time--years before computers and digital tricks took over--and the dimetrodon attack is justifiably famous.
In terms of performances, the late James Mason towers over this movie--his enthusiastic, take-charge performance really gives this film the lift it needs. Pat Boone ? I'm sorry--good looking guy, popular singer at the time--but as an actor, he is as dynamic as a bowl of vanilla pudding. Giving him top billing over James Mason is ridiculous. Leading lady, Arlene Dahl, is fine--the way she comes out of these underground escapades looking gorgeous, is quite a feat !
The plot deviates substantially from Verne's original novel, and of course there are many liberties taken with true science ! However,the idea here is to ""go with the flow"", and have a good time. Some younger viewers might think that this movie takes too long before the action starts, but hopefully they will find it worth the wait !
Again this was one of the last major films from a decade where sci-fi/fantasy films blossomed. If you like the genre, this lovely DVD definitely belongs in your collection.",1049673600,3,1916,4.916666666666667
1817554,5,B00007JMD8,"Let no one doubt that this is a great classic film and although modified from the original book, it presents the story well and is extremely entertaining. The new DVD has some background lighting irregularities of contrasting brightness/darkening that tends to take away from this film's great color presentation, but in consideration of the age and existant recordings, it is a decent restoration. The best restorations I have seen are ""The Time Machine"" and ""Vertigo"" and this one could have used those staffers because it deserves it. The Bernard Hermann score is unforgettable and constitutes one of his best works, having a similarity to his ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" (a few music pieces cut from this movie, ""diamonds"" in particular are extremely similar to the music used in ""Journey') and deep organ tones are added for atmosphere. The movie has charm. From 1880 Scotland to Icelandic geology and the subsequent underground scenes it impresses the eye and articulates the hazards of uncharted exploration. The film is also unusually reverent, a quality lacking in films made today. SAFE for children to watch.",1049414400,,1119,5.153846153846154
1817555,5,B00007JMD8,"Excellent transfer of a movie I have loved since I went to the movie theatre to watch it.
The DVD is impeccable. Fully restored picture, excellent sound and a few extras included.
James Mason and Pat Boone are at their best in this movie, based on Jules Verne's classic adventure tale.
If you like adventure-fantasy movies, then this one is certainly for you.

Buy it. It's well worth the money.
For the entire family...",1048982400,7,467,4.63855421686747
1817556,3,B00007JMD8,"A 19th century French businessman, Jules Verne decided rather late in life to give up the stock market and write children's fantasy novels. I'm so glad he did. The movie version of his ""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"", in 1954, set off an explosion of major Jules Verne film adaptions(over 12 movies in 10 years). One of the finest was ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"". As the story opens, an Edinburgh professor receives a gift; a meteorite fragment from his student. Intuition fires Prof. Lindenbrook's imagination: Could an historic scientific message be hidden inside? After testing, the rock explodes. Lindenbrook assembles an expedition to follow an explorer's trail down into an extinct Icelandic volcano. Enemies surround him. Mysterious creatures are everywhere. For Prof. Lindenbrook and his party, a fantastic adventure is about to begin. ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" stars Pat Boone, Arlene Dahl, Thayer David, Alan Napier, and the magnificent James Mason. But the real ""star"" is composer Bernard Herrmann, who's thundering, booming film score is nothing short of classic(and actually, only one of many). Director Henry Levin fashioned a lively, colorful saga in 1959's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"". Extensive shooting in Hollywood, Scotland, and Carlsbad Caverns produced sweeping set-pieces of subterranean caverns, a giant mushroom forest, and even the lost temples of Atlantis. Special effects include miniature constructions, matte painting, and more. Sadly, the film's main draw-back is a horde of painted lizard ""dinosaurs"" thrown at the camera in the exciting finale. This brand new widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1) DVD is an excellent transfer. Fox found the original 1959 camera negative worn and faded. A search for viable film elements led to a black-and-white silver print; from this came a 35mm interpositive. Finally came digital restoration and video enhancement. DVD extras include 40 chapter stops, 8 trailers, and a conclusive restoration documentary. Famous and wealthy in his time, Jules Verne predicted the future use of submarines, space-travel, and crustaceous exploration. Over 80 motion picture and TV productions around the world have heralded his work.  The first science-fiction movie was made in 1902 by George Melies. And yes, you're right. It was written by Jules Verne.",1047600000,138,2339,5.425824175824176
1817557,5,B00007JMD8,"The movie is beautifully restored for DVD. The film is crisp and clear the sound is great. The movie looks like it was just filmed yesterday. The story itself is an excellent adventure yarn. At every turn something new happens.

There is a fantastic music score by Bernard Hermann and enough drama, innuendo, and humor to keep even adults very interested and entertained. Yes there are some very hokey and even campy moments but I found these to only add to the entertainment.

Everyone gives a very very good performance including even Pat Boone and of course the always excellent James Mason.

Although not all the sets and special effect hold up by today's standards they are all fun. That said many of sets and special effects are still stunning.

For anyone who grew up loving this film - it is well worth seeing again and even owning. Even more highly recommended for families with kids.

Journey stands along side of other adventure films of its time including Swiss Family Robinson and 20,000 Leages Under the Sea.

By the way the price for owning a DVD of this quality - under twelve dollars - for this movie - makes it a steal!!

A note - A number of reviewers felt the giant lizard monsters are not credible and hurt the film.  Personally I loved these monsters.  First of all they are real! Not a guy in a lizard suit and not animation.  I feel the effect to be very good. I was amazed as to how well these scenes are matted in and how big and dangerous these guys look.  The giant reptile acting? - how did they get these heavy looking kick-butt lizards to attack and run around?  Plus the monsters get a special scary Bernard Herrmann music too - via some sort sort of weird horn.

An Ocean at the center of the world protected by monsters on it's sandy beaches? I loved it - Sounds crazy but I feel it works with and has atmosphere to burn.",1047340800,3,1855,4.420588235294118
1817558,5,B00007JMD8,"Fantasy fans who, like myself, have never seen this delightful film in a theatre are in for a real treat - actually, more like a revelation - when they experience this superb widescreen DVD edition.  The beautifully restored print is a stunner to look at (particularly during the many subterranean sequences), with scrumptious colors and textures.  The film is afforded a generous forty (40) chapters.  There's also plenty of fun to be had as one explores the DVD's special features: details about the film's restoration, a split-screen segment illustrating how the film looked before and after, and an entertaining assortment of trailers (previews) for other 20th Century-Fox films: The Abyss, Planet of the Apes (both versions), One Million B.C. ('66 version), Zardoz, and Independence Day, among others.",1047340800,2,806,5.330708661417323
1817559,4,B00007JMD8,"OK, there's been some controversy here about the quality of this release, so let me put it to rest.  This DVD is spledid! I think this adaptation of Jules Verne's 1864 French novel is a prime example of 1950's wide-screen motion picture family entertainment -- it's wholesome and has a little something for everyone. This is the best film version of this story, the most recent of which was done for the USA Channel on cable in 1999 and was very campy. They couldn't match the 1959 production values of this 20th Century-Fox film that has excellent color photography and art direction, and Bernard Herrmann's wonderfully atmospheric music score. These elements have continued to make it a favorite with fantasy film fans who can appreciate older movies, though it's true that some of it is silly at times, but I don't think the film's makers were trying for a serious movie. It also contains one of James Mason's best performances (He was always good).  It's wonderful ""Cinemascope"" escapism from the bygone Eisenhower-era of the 1950s. Even though I've been watching it on TV since I was a kid in the sixties, I'd only seen pan&scan versions, and it wasn't until I got it letterboxed on laserdisc that I finally saw what a big-screen entertainment this movie was meant to be. It has splendid scope and a score by Bernard Herrmann that takes you right down into the bowels of the earth. Listen to it and you'll notice what I mean, as the movie progresses the music keeps going into a lower and lower register. Five organs were used, including one meant for a Cathedral. (The complete original recordings of the score are available on CD from Varese Sarabande.) Sure it's long in the telling and takes a while to get you down that extinct volcano in Iceland, but it's fun all the way with great special effects work by L.B. Abbott and matte paintings by Emil Kosa Jr. It's been a long wait for this to come out on DVD but it's now worth it.  Although Fox should have known that fans would want more extras, including a production and poster still gallery and audio commentary by Pat Boone and Arlene Dahl perhaps?, or an expert on the production? (Perhaps we'll get it in a future release?), they have thankfully included the original theatrical trailer, whic is a lot of fun.  They've also gone to great efforts to restore the color negative, and this 16X9 ANAMORPHIC TRANSFER has been struck from a newly made interpositive print, and has been further enhanced with digital video.  The original 4-track MagOptical soundtrack is here offered in Dolby Digital 4.0 surround.  Although the directionalized dialogue is often off the mark, the aged soundtrack sounds great and will really rumble your room if you've got a subwoofer.  If you are a fan of 1959's JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, you'll be very happy with this DVD.  I'd give this DVD five stars but for Fox skimping on the extras.  Boy, you people at Fox can be real dummies!",1047081600,100,2938,4.689320388349515
1817560,4,B00007JMD8,"Much better than the VHS! A bit more background grain and shimmer that I had hoped, but still a great restoration job. Color looks a litte odd though. Mabey its just me.
The package back says the aspect ratio is 2:35:1 letterboxed widscreen animorphicly enhanced for 16x9 TVs, but it also says that the picture has been modified from its original version and formatted to fit the screen. LOL!

UPDATE:

According ot the restoration documentary included on the disc, this version of the movie has been complied from numerous sources, including some full-frame elements that were 'matted' in order to properly fit. Mabey that explains the odd aspect ratio description mentioned above. Hahaha.

1817561,5,B00007JMD8,"I popped the brand new DVD version of this film in the machine last night, adjusted the volume to half power, as it was late, and POW! The first bass-filled organ blast of Bernard Herrmann's score caused the picture frames on the walls to rattle! The sound on this DVD is fantastic. Much better than I'd hoped for in a picture that is over 40 years old. It's also in stereo, and very, very lush.
The picture quality is truly amazing. The effort and care taken in restoring this film to its original lustre and vibrancy is evident from the first frame to the last. The color has been expertly corrected. Greys are now grey again, instead of a reddish brown. Blacks are deep, but with plenty of detail in the shadows. Skin tones are natural, and the technicolor is as vibrant again as it was when it was originally released. An example of this is in the opening credits. The background shots of exploding red lava fountains have always bled so badly one almost needed a paramedic standing by. Now, the color is bright and intense, but without any bleeding or noise. The clarity has to be seen to be believed. My hat is off to the wonderful folks at Fox for their lovely restoration of this classic ""popcorn flick."" You have my deepest gratitude. It definitely belongs in any collection, regardless of your preference for this genre. Buy it!

1817562,5,B00007JMD8,"Despite having owned this film on laserdisc in a widescreen special edition version I never even hesitated to purchase the dvd on it's March 4th release date, knowing that it would be superior to the former. Although the laserdisc seems to have a bit more prominent bass overall the dvd is clearer and more revealing of individual instruments. There is a deleted scene as well as publicity stills, photos, and posters featured as supplements on the laserdisc but the superior video quality of the dvd more than makes up for this. It would have been nice had Fox Studios included some extras, I have no idea whether any interview material exists involving James Mason etc. but some insights from Pat Boone would have been a wonderful addition. Although the retail price is quite low - I would have paid more for a making of documentary and/or the aforementioned interview(s). It was noted by someone in a previous review that pre release information indicated a non-anamorphic version, however it turns out that it IS anamorphic, so widescreen hdtv owners can rest easy! Speaking of widescreen, films made incorporating the original aspect ratios ( OAR ) of 2.35 ( such as Journey ) or higher can never be truly appreciated in an altered pan and scan ( also called Full Frame ) version as you easily are missing close to 50% or more of the actual picture. A little education goes a long way as it has for me - I cannot now watch movies that are not OAR - and I will not buy a dvd that is only available full frame. I always wanted to purchase Chitty Chitty Bang Bang but it is not in its original widescreen presentation. Here's hoping the studio concerned will get it right one day. Regardless, enjoy this film as a great piece of entertainment that, like so many others from the '50's and '60's, cannot be touched by today's movies- with some rather rare exceptions. Don't forget, another Jules Verne inspired film will be out in mid May 2003 - Walt Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. Can't wait for the big day to arrive!",1046822400,4,2027,4.617728531855955
