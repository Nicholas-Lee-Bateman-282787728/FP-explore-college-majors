1622917,5,B00005LQ03,"Hilarious! Stupendous! Horatio Sans in his BIGGEST role yet!  Jerry O'Connell has definitely gone a long way since his first movie, ""Stand By Me"" and his MTV hit, ""Joe's Apartment.""  If you like a great comedy film, you will absolutely fall in love with this film and you may even want to make sweet, passionate love to it.  The film is about Michael Delaney (O'Connell) who falls into a large debt.  His only way to gain the money needed is to somehow get his old friend Kyle (Busey) to get married, so that he will be the last ""Tomcat"" and therefore win the bet he and his friends made years ago.  Things get complicated, if you're 3 years old, when Delaney falls in love with the girl that he is trying to set Kyle up with.  Meanwhile, Horatio Sans, the BIGGEST and best star in this film, has suspicisions about his wife being a lesbian and is repeatedly trying to catch her in the act.  You may just [pee]your pants from laughter of watching Horatio trying to be stealthy and quick.  Its almost as breathtaking as seeing Chuck Norris as a sorest spirit in ""Forest Warrior""...All in all, this is one of the greatest movies of the year and should win many many awards.  Horatio Sans deserves that much, or at least another burrito.  My review may be somewhat biased because when I saw this film with my friend, we were the ONLY two in the theatre, thus allowing us to enjoy this movie without any distractions...well, except for the crickets chirping after the jokes. Buy this movie NOW!  And make sure that's the right kind of ""NUT"" you're eating!",991958400,4,1551,4.503571428571429

1622919,5,B00005LQ03,"I walked into the ""Tomcats"" expecting a really bad movie with a few laughs every once in a while. MAN WAS I WRONG!
""Tomcats"" is about a group of buddies who one day, after a wedding, make a little bet. They each place some money into a pot every year and the Tomcat who remains single the longest, gets all the money. Some years go buy and mostly every Tomcat is married except for two, Kyle (Jake Busey) a sex crazed maniac with a ton of cash to spend and a somewhat starving artist (Jerry O'Connel). Problems arrive at a casino and O'Connel's charecter owes a group of mobsters around 50 thousand dollars. Now the only way to get his money is to marry up Kyle, the only one who stands in his way of the pot. But an even bigger problem occurs when the artist starts to fall for the girl he tries to set Kyle up with (Shannon Elizabeth).
Throughout the entire film, many hillarious situatuions and scenes occur during the film. At times, I had to grab onto my stomach because I was laughing so hard. Though, every minute of this movie is hillarious, there are parts of the film you will remember more than others and some scenesyou will never forget for as long as you live (three little words, O'Connel's date with a librarian and when Kyle gets testicular cancer).
""Tomcats"" is a great film with gaurenteed laughs that start from the beggining until the very end. All the acting is surprisingly good, especially from Busey and O'Connel. Unless you're someone who doesn't like to have fun, Tomcats is the ultiate film. TOMCATS ROCKS!",988329600,15,1534,4.50179211469534

1622964,4,B00005LQ03,"One critic review I saw at the top was written by an unhappy male or female that didn't have a clue about how a young man or young woman was not thinking things through all the time at that point in their life.  Now for those of us that know about out of control hormones aka raging hormones, both male and female alike may find this funny.  Is it moronic humor sometimes?  ITS A COMEDY MEANT TO BE THAT WAY!  Never fails to amaze me when I see reviews that didn't get it.  This actually fairly funny either for the young or old if you had a time in you life when you were a little out of control.  Now if you want over the top stupid, see a Jackass movie.  This movie had some clever writing, directing, casting, acting, stunts, and music.  I highly recommend it to the non-frustrated people.

1623009,5,B00005LQ03,"While ostensibly the worst movie of the 21st century,  this paean to masculinity has pushed the feminist movement up by 30 years. How? By exulting in the lowest common denominator of male attributes. Imbecilic jokes abound to entertaining the male masses who must make up the majority of this film's viewers. However, below the surface is brilliance, undercovered only by a select group of cinematic geniuses.
To the select few, this film is actually a stark examination of depravity: we are asked to observe B-grade actors be pushed increasingly lower into the depths. We explore what is NOT on the screen, such as the awkward human feeling behind the scenes. One can only imagine the director yelling ""Tomcats, Scene 5, Act 4! ACTION!,"" as Horatio Sanz is asked for the fourteenth time to tell a (...) joke.
Thus, if you want to see phallus jokes and dispense high-fives, watch the film. If you want to see a brilliant dissertation of human depravity, check it out.",1100649600,6,967,4.86060606060606

A pretty good storyline features a host of hilarious moments .... if you ask me, this movie is about typical guys, their dislike of marriage, and the need for cash!  In amongst this are some moments, you will never forget .... chasing the testical, throwing the dice, and well, I have to say it - the chick in the back seat of the car and Kyle ..... this is hilariously funny (maybe to the point of disgusting?) ... and of course the 'pretty' funny bachelors party scene ... also deserves a mention!
This is one of the best comedies I have seen in ages and ages, and for all you girls out there, this is not only for the guys!  It should be taken in the ""tone"" that it's set in (it's a comedy and not serious) .... and you should sit back and enjoy the ride!  ...... and, if you can't find it funny then it will at least gross you out in parts - enough that you will have to laugh anyways (not so bad if you ask me)!

1623014,1,B00005LQ03,"Who gave the greenlight for this movie? Who? Why? HOW? What were they smoking/drinking/thinking? Did the studio exec who read this script laugh? If so, I want to know where, because nothing that made it to the screen suggests that TOMCATS was a funny idea to begin with.
Sick. Rude. Offensive. Degrading. All these words are irrelevant in raunchy comedy if only it was funny. And I'm here to tell you people, as an uncultured teenage male of the American Pie generation, that TOMCATS is supremely UNFUNNY.  This makes Jake Busey's performance in STARSHIP TROOPERS look like Best Supporting Actor material.
TOMCATS and FREDDY GOT FINGERED together in the same season is a one-two punch, a serious blow to the defense of the American Film Industry. Ever wonder why the French hate us? THIS is why. This is a comedy, and thus exempt from the ""so bad it's good"" category. But it fits nicely into the ""So bad and unfunny it should  burned."" And I liked PEARL HARBOR.
I'm not just a radical reviewing panning this movie for fun. I watch a lot of movies and I think I'm pretty levelheaded when I say something about a movie.",1055980800,5,1117,4.636363636363637

1623017,5,B00005LQ03,"Well at least I think so.  Jerry O'Connell, most recently of ""Kangaroo Jack"" fame, is one of two buddies in a large group of male friends who have pooled money together betting who can remain single.  Finally it is down to O'Connell, an artist with some scruples, and his friend Kyle who has none.

During a trip to Las Vegas, O'Connell runs up a $51K gambling debt to a hilariously vicious, yet deadpan Bill Maher and his goons.  Although there is enough in the jackpot to free O'Connell from reposession hell as Maher takes all he owns as collateral, he has even tougher odds of getting Kyle married, since he is a complete louse to all woman kind.

In walks Shannon Elizabeth as a cop who once dated Kyle and was left with a role of quarters in the road for a cab after being deflowered and dumped.  She was a bridesmaid at one of the many weddings attended by the bachelor gang as they all became married one by one.  O'Connell falls in love when he meets Elizabeth, but to free his debt, ends up getting her married to Kyle, or DOES he?  YOU have to see this and find out for yourself.

While some are thumbing their nose at this film, I found it a scream.  It was entertaining from start to finish, and lately, I find myself hitting the fast forward on many movies just to get through them.  NOT ""Tomcats"".  Is it sexist?  SURE!  I am a woman, I can laugh at this, in fact I did, out loud many times.  There are more laughs and plain old feel good fun here than most comedies I have seen in awhile.  A dominatrix librarian and her grannie partner who lure unsuspecting men into their dungeon of discipline? A diseased testicle ending up rocketing around a hospital while chased down by O'Connell?  A wildly graphic and surrealistic restaurant scene where Elizabeth gives birth at the table in front of a party of 15-20 earth mothers vigorously and unabashedly breast feeding?  Well if this sounds in poor taste, that is because it is!  Delightfully so!  Do not listen to the uptight folks who slammed this, unless you too have no sense of humor.  Man or woman, take this movie for what it is, GOOD DIRTY FUN...and bring a big bowl of popcorn put your feet up and get ready to laugh.",1050019200,11,2188,4.393034825870647
1623038,1,B00005LQ03,"The only people who would enjoy this are the people that think MTV's Jackass is High Art. Hollywood needs to stop making such arrogant, machismo, sexist and homophobic movies. It's appaling the way Hollywood portrays the way women should be treated. At first I felt sorry for the women in this picture, but then I realized:
A:) Each one is a terrible actress
B:) The only thing they have going for them is looks
C:) They're getting paid more than me
D:) They're degrading themselves on their own accord, so they deserve to get treated the way they do in Tomcats.

This movie is degrading towards women and I was outraged. Shannon Elizabeth should've known better. Her best role was in ""American Pie."" Enough said. Utterly terrible. One part I remember in this movie was when a mental patient ate a ball.",1033776000,,366,4.6461538461538465
1623040,4,B00005LQ03,"Unfortunately, this movie came out at a time when a lot of very funny comedies were on the horizon (Heartbreakers, American Pie 2, Freddy Got Fingered, etc.), so, it didn't review as well as it would have.  While it was not as over-the-top as American Pie 2, it does rank right up there.  I didn't give it five stars because at times it seems to drag.  All editorial and press reviews aside, this was a very good movie.  At times, I would find myself almost coughing from laughing so hard.
Here's a synopsis:  The movie begins with a group of friends who are very disillusioned, they are afraid of commitment and want to remain ""Tomcats"" forever.  They all place money into a high-yield mutual fund in the mid-90's and thinking that it wouldn't be that big of deal leave it there to collect interest.  Flash-forward to present day, the pot is now almost half a million dollars and there are only two unmarried guys left, Kyle (Gary Busey) and Michael (Jerry O'Connell).  While at their friend's wedding in Las Vegas, Michael gets in trouble at the craps table to the tune over 50 thousand dollars.  He hatches a plan to fix  up Kyle (who is filthy rich and pretty much has a different girl every night), with a former bridesmaid at his friend's wedding all those years ago, Natalie (played hilariously by Shannon Elizabeth).  What follows are some of the most disgusting, degrading, and downright depraved scenes that I've seen to date (...).

Now for the actual plot. Seven years ago Micheal's friend got married. That night the men are talking and make a bet on whoever can stay single longest. Now back in the present Horatio Sanz character has just gotten married in vegas and its down to Michael(Jerry O'Connel) and Kyle(Jake Busey). Michael is betting at the high rollers table trying to impress a girl. He finally quits after losing $51,000. He has 30 days to pay it off or he will be killed. He goes to Kyle, who is rich, and about to ask him if he can borrow the money. Michael finds out that Kyle hates lending out money before he got to ask. So then Michael thinks then asks him if he ever got close to falling in love.  Kyle tells Michael about Natalie(Shannon Elizabeth) who was a brides made at the wedding 7 years ago. He explained that he thought she was the one who got away. Michael goes searching for her and askes her is she remembers Kyle. She does but she doesnt remember the way Kyle did.  She hates Kyle so shes makes a deal with Michael that for half the bet she will get Kyle to marry her.

1623044,3,B00005LQ03,"It is what it is...A hilariously and wickedly mean spirited flick about bachelorism from Hollywood's comical point of view. Tomcats is satirical and purely entertaining despite the gross out testicle scene, sperm bank scene, and well, just abut any other scene. While many film afficionados or purists may consider this trash at least it is not cerebral fodder that will cause a brain hemmorhage but something to kill time on a boring Saturday afternoon with friends. Story or plot is simple and basic with a great abundance of feminine eye candy as well (Jaime Pressly and Shannon Elizabeth, and the gal who played Consuelo the maid). Even though Jerry O' Connell is no Brendan Fraser or Tom Hanks the guy is actually capable of being funny ! Jake Busey's character is utterly repulsive and gives the rest of us men a bad rap. Yet,his portrayal is so familiar of the mindset of a few immature male friends of mine from high school and college who thought women were only good for one thing (or two)! Actor /comedian Horatio Sanz's physical antics (the attack by the garden house scene) was so reminiscent of the late John Belushi's antics in Animal House; Sanz is hysterical. If there's anything the viewer should walk away with it should be a good tickle in the funny bone !",1022198400,2,1276,4.726457399103139
1623045,1,B00005LQ03,"This movie is all over the place. It starts out as just your typical sex movie, and the humor is so crude that even Howard Stern would say it's going too far. If you think any joke in this movie is funny, you'll also notice that it's the kind of joke that you wouldn't dare repeat to anyone.
From what I could figure out about the plot, a group of bachelor friends make a bet with a large amount of money (I don't remember or care exactly how much), which will be given to the last bachelor standing. At one point, there are two bachelors left: Michael (Jerry O'Connell) and Kyle (Jake Busey). Michael goes to Vegas and gambles away all his money. In order to pay off his debt, he struggles to get Kyle, a gigolo, married so he can collect the 'winning' money; thus paying off the debt. While cruising around one night, Michael propositions a prostitute (Shannon Elizabeth) who turns out to be an undercover police officer named Natalie. He is taken into custody, but he gets let go under Natalie's supervision when he cries out (literally) that he was just trying to get in contact with his ex-girlfriend. Now I don't know where the ex-girlfriend thing came from, or the whole prostitution incident, for that matter. That tells you right there how disorganized everything is. Michael's ex-girlfriend is played by Jaime Pressly...I think. I couldn't even tell.
Meanwhile, Steve (Horatio Sanz) is married, but he thinks his wife is cheating on him with another woman. He keeps bursting into her room whenever he sees supposed shadows and hears supposed sounds of her and another woman, but he's always wrong. The last time, however, he actually does catch her with another woman. Just as he is furiously leaving the room, the women ask him if he wants to join. And because he's a man, of course he jumps right in. What a great storyline.
There are two things that were proved here. One is that watching this movie is an equivalent to self-destruction. The other thing is that it's obvious that Shannon Elizabeth will do anything for a check. Aside from this, she has appeared in such travesties as Seamless (a runaway gang of young people living on sex and gambling) and Dish Dogs (a stripper falling in love with a dish washer). She's not a bad actress, but it's really hard to tell when she subjects herself to mess like this.
This movie is about as funny as an episode of The Parent 'Hood. Leave it alone and go do something more fun, like your laundry.",1020297600,6,2455,4.581818181818182

Trust me, this is a terrible film with practically NO redeeming values.  None. It is just...just...oh geesh words fail me. I cannot possibly describe what a horrible film this was.  I watched it at the insistence of a friend (who happens to think Three Amigos is a masterpiece), and I think I lost 100 minutes of my life in doing so.  And I'm wasting more time writing this review, but I owe it to you to warn you away.  This is simply the worst film I've seen this year, bar none.  It's like the filmmakers wanted to try a Naked Gun/American Pie/Dumb & Dumber type film, but they totally messed up.  The entire film is all sub-toilet humor (Want an example? How about a man eating a cancerous testicle?  Boy I'm dying of laughter...).
Hey, this sort of film can be enjoyable (American Pie, for instance, is Citizen Kane compared to this Plan 9 from Outer Space wannabe) but not in this case.  In fact, if you're expecting a sexy R-rated romp from this film, you won't get it.  Better just watch American Pie.  Shannon Elizabeth is the best actor in this film (uh, that CAN'T possibly be a good comment); she is easy on the eyes, but c'mon folks, she is wasted in this film.  Jaime Pressly is wasted too.  Jake Busey is just downright...scary (and I thought he was bad in Starship Troopers...hah!).  Look, just rent Ace Ventura, okay?  Repeat after me: I WILL NOT WATCH TOMCATS...I WILL NOT WATCH TOMCATS...",1010620800,13,1518,4.5054945054945055

  Let's see..Jerry O'Connell has only about two facial expressions to work with,the Busey kid creeps me out beyond belief,(hey,just like Dad!!) Shannon Elisabeth is totally wasted and the gags are not funny,especially the long drawn out bit with the discarded testicle. Stay far away from this. Jerry O'Connell ruins every movie he's in. Julia Schultz is wasted as well!! If you see it at a video store and accidentally pick it up,put it down quick,and wash your hands!!!",1009670400,4,668,4.8
1623079,3,B00005LQ03,"Movie Summary:  A group of young men who call themselves the Tomcats make a pact. They all pay money monthly into an account and the last single man of the group takes it all. The pot grows quite huge and eventually only two Tomcats remain single; Michael a sweet but somewhat stupid lad, and Kyle a sexist pig. Michael gets himself into a load of debt in a casino when he lets a red headed beauty roll the dice for him. The shady casino manager gives Michael one month to come up with the money, or he is going to kill him. The only idea that Michael gets is to get Kyle married and win the old Tomcat bet.
My Opinion: This is a silly story, but it's got some laughs as well as Shannon Elizabeth and Jerry O'Connell both of whom I like, so it's not a complete waste. There is a plot to the movie, but it is fairly weak. The way Michael gets into trouble in the casino could have been done a lot better. Jake Busey is entertaining as the sexist pig whom Michael tries to marry off. In the end I think it was the love story between Michael and Natalie that saved this movie for me. It kept me rooting for Michael. Enough of the jokes hit home for me that I found the entire movie funny. The movie would be better with a few beers to help it along while you watch it.
DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 as well as full screen 1.33:1. Video quality is fine.  Sound: DD 5.1 quality ok.  Extras: Trailer and Filmography. Menus: Nothing Special. This entire DVD release is nothing special.
What You Should Do:  Rent this one only if you are up for some stupid male fun. It does have a plot and the love story redeems it from being put into the same class as Saving Silverman and Dude Where's My Car both of which I despised.

1623080,4,B00005LQ03,"Ok, I know this movie got a lot of bad reviews, but mostly from people who are not into gross out, over the top comedies (people who gave this movie 1 to 2 stars should stick to more serious films).  The beginning of Tomcats isn't spectacularly funny but once we see the characters get past the first wedding, the film really starts to pick up and starts to get a lot funnier.  If you're into movies along the lines of ""Say It Isn't So"" or ""Saving Silverman"" then I think you'll enjoy this movie.
As for the DVD features, theres nothing really special there, just some trailers from other movies and filmographies for the actors.  However, you do get a choice of watching the movie in either Widescreen or Full Screen (its always good to have options).
I would definitly recommend this movie for a good laugh, just don't try to watch it seriously.",1005264000,7,847,4.487012987012987

1623082,2,B00005LQ03,"This review is intended for the DVD release of TomCats.  My main purpose here is to review the DVD release, including its quality, features and layout.  I'll start with the Movie, then move on to the DVD itself.

Synopsis:
TomCats is a rather off-color movie that more than easily earns its R rating.  It's a sexual comedy, revolving around a bet a number of unmarried men make as to which one of them will be the last to remain single.  The bet winds up with two men still standing. One of them, (Jerry O'Connell) gets himself into debt with a bookie who threatens severe violence if the debt isn't settled.  The pot on the bet is his only way to save himself from the debt-collector.  What results is a wild rather immature attempt to get the other guy (an unabashed single lady's man) married.

Review:
The whole movie is rather juvenile. The humor is often based on pratfalls and sexual sight jokes, and occasionally moves into the sick and nauseating.  Case in point, in the middle of the movie there is a sequence where the other single male has a cancerous testicle amputated. It gets dropped onto the floor and a five minute chase of it through the hospital ensues, ending with someone in the hospital cafeteria accidentally eating it. The sequence is just plain gross.

As one can guess, this movie was way below my sense of good taste.  Of course, I watched it anyway.  Shannon Elisabeth is in it.  I couldn't help myself. :)

Still, I wouldn't buy it. It's a mediocre comedy and I don't like to gag when I'm watching movies.

Now for the DVD.  First off, The movie is offered in Widescreen and pan'n'scan. It is also offered in two languages, English and French.  Since this is the American release of this movie, wouldn't Spanish be a better additional language than French?

The special features are scanty, including only a few theatrical trailers and a filmography.

Overall, this DVD release is nothing special. There's no special treats for DVD buyers except for the choice of pan'n'scan or widescreen.  The movie itself is unforgettable, simply for several of its disgusting sequences.  Some might like it, but I'd give it a pass.",1002758400,7,2148,4.674666666666667

ONE SCENE IN PARTICULAR IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE MOVIE. LETS JUST SAY IT INVOLVES AN ELDERLY WOMAN CLAD IN HER BEST S&M GEAR.

1623085,5,B00005LQ03,"I can guarantee you there will soon be a barrage of 1-star reviews coming for this movie.  If you are going to watch this movie you first must realize what it is, an over-the-top comedy with sight-gags and numerous sexual references.  If you go into it expecting something more profound than this, you are going to be sadly disappointed and should probably watch something else.  However if you are in the mood for this kind of comedy, this movie will not disappoint.  Jerry O'Connell is great in this movie and Shannon Elizabeth is fairly good also (though I don't think she is that great of an actress).  Jamie Presly's performance was extremely disappointing however.  Anyways, I wasn't really expecting much when I saw it in the theater (mostly due to bad reviews I had read... almost ALL bad reviews).  However, I was very pleasantly surprised as this movie was hilarious.  There were a few forced jokes that didn't quite hit the mark, but most of them did.  It was very well paced, not really getting slow very often and kept the humor coming.  I think it was cast pretty well and everyone played their roles well, I couldn't help but root for the good guys to prevail in the end.
The underlying story really isn't that bad either and it does have a fairly good message to it.  Overall its one of the better comedies in this genre that I've seen and full of energy.  It's definitely on my purchase list once its released on DVD.",993427200,10,1434,4.55859375
