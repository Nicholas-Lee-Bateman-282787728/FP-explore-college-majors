8583192,5,B00210UC78,"I have wanted to know more about this ""art form"" since seeing it going on several times in public places. This doc really fills you in on this phenomenon; who is involved in it, why it is becoming so popular, and gives you a lot of beautiful footage of various performers. The clear photography and the quality sound put you right there.

Informative as well as lively, you can't help but have a good time watching this and probably feel younger while you're at it. The energy and the fun of these performers is contagious!",1238025600,,523,4.505263157894737
