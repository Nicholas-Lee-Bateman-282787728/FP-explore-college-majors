387447,5,6301934946,"Unknown Chaplin is an excellent three part documentary about the parts of Charlie Chaplin's career that are not well known to the public. Film-makers Kevin Brownlow and David Gill became aware of rare film footage from Chaplin's archive and came up with the idea to make a documentary of it. They discovered ample evidence of the genius's filming techniques including scenes of him directing and creating gags on film.

The first episode delves into what are known as Chaplin's ""happiest years,"" the ones making Mutual comedies. During this time, he was able to do everything behind the camera. He was a director as well as an actor and he contributed greatly to the stories and pacing of the films. We also learn a bit about his relationship with Edna Purviance, his leading lady for 8 years. The second bit focuses heavily on two major accomplishments in Chaplin's career, The Gold Rush and City Lights. Here we see interviews with his leading ladies Georgia Hale and Virginia Cherrill to gain insight into the man and his methods. The last segment rediscovers the artist through outtakes and rare clips. We see a very funny cut scene from City Lights as well as other interesting moments.

Also included on this disk are two fascinating bits for film historians. We hear Brownlow's story of the making of these documentaries, a very interesting but disappointingly short segment. Next is The Making of The Count, a dissection of how Chaplin made the film. Both are excellent supplements to a wonderful show. If you find yourself wondering why Chaplin gets so much attention in the history books, watch this film. You won't second guess anymore.",1169856000,6,1647,4.920863309352518
387448,5,6301934946,"I consider this an excellent documentary of the inner workings of Chas. Chaplin. There are many insightful parts and many of the films recorded on this documentary that had never been seen since they were filmed. Also according to the DVD extras, some of the film that is seen on this dvd did not survive.",1168300800,3,305,4.5636363636363635
387449,5,6301934946,"I remember sitting in front of my television, rapturously watching the documentary ""Hollywood"" created by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill in 1980. Each of the 13 segments dealing with a specific part of early Hollywood history, played on PBS and was a true delight. In this era before DVD, and even VHS, it was a great way to see a large number of rare clips from the Silent era. A few years later, they made ""Unknown Chaplin"", perhaps the most astonishing documentary ever created about the technical side of Hollywood. A few years later, ""Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow"" continued the tradition.

""Unknown Chaplin"" was just released on DVD and is a must have addition for anyone even remotely interested in the history of film or filmmaking.

During production of ""Hollywood"", Brownlow and Gill naturally wanted to devote an entire hour to Chaplin but ran into a roadblock. The person who controlled access to Chaplin's work was only prepared to let them use a ""snippet"". They had to change their plans. They couldn't build an entire hour around a ""snippet"". After ""Hollywood"" aired, to great critical acclaim, they tried again. Chaplin's widow allowed them access to his personal vault. What they found there astonished them; row after row of film cans, many labeled with ""City Lights"", ""The Gold Rush"", ""The Circus"" and many with unfamiliar names. These contained clips never before seen, projects started but never finished and rehearsals for films like ""City Lights"". It was a treasure trove for any film historian.

Naturally, they believed they had just hit the mother load, but soon met a man named Raymond Rohauer. Rohauer, a film ""collector"", claimed to have many reels of film from Chaplin's Mutual days, the period immediately before Chaplin went independent and began to make his great feature-length films. The Mutual period is considered by many to be Chaplin's best, when he made his most famous two-reelers, ""The Immigrant"", ""The Cure"" and others along with ""The Kid"". As they viewed this footage, Brownlow and Gill made a major realization;  Chaplin worked out all of his films on the set, while the cameras were rolling, providing a visual history of his work. Beginning with a bare outline he would began production, working out jokes on set, adding jokes, changing stories, and more. Sometimes, he would scrap everything and start over. Or get an idea and change everything around. And the camera was always running while he did this.

""Unknown Chaplin"" premiered in 1983 to great critical acclaim, exposing many to the methods used by one of film's greatest comedians and most skilled directors. Imagine having the ability to watch Claude Monet create a canvas and get insight into the various decisions he made. Or to watch Frank Lloyd Wright work on his latest design and see why he decided to put that piece of word there. This is what ""Unknown Chaplin"" provides, access into the mind of a master.

Recently released on DVD for the first time, each of the three segments of ""Unknown"" look amazingly vivid and clear. Some of the better footage is so clear it looks like it was photographed yesterday. As James Mason narrates, guiding us, we begin to learn how Chaplin created his films. Every time I say this, I just get chills up and down my spine. How often can we expect to see a master, someone at the top of their craft, creating some of their most famous work? Considering how much of the Silent era was destroyed, the fact that this film exists at all is all the more impressive.

Part One is the most groundbreaking, presenting the footage from the Mutual days. Brownlow and Gill quickly realized that Chaplin filmed every take and frequently changed bits between takes. How should they deal with this wealth of material? They decided to arrange the clips in chronological order, recreating how Chaplin worked on the material as the cameras rolled. He began each project with an outline, but this is by no means how the projects were completed. He would work out the jokes and funny business on set, sometimes running into road blocks. If he couldn't work through it, he would scrap everything and start over. We get to see this process as we watch these clips unearthed by the filmmakers.

Part Two presents the material obtained from Chapin's vaults, after he became independent and began making feature length films. Less extensive, the footage still reveals a lot. For instance, a family friend stood near the camera and was able to take home movies as Chaplin worked on ""City Lights"". This footage is shown, and we get a glimpse of Chaplin, the director, at work. We also watch as Chaplin works through various location problems with ""The Gold Rush"", unused footage from ""The Circus"" and more.

Part Three shows us the unseen clips, portions of abandoned projects, unseen shorts and more Brownlow and Gill found in the Chaplin vaults. After Chaplin built his own studio, many dignitaries and famous people stopped by and the director filmed these visits, sometimes making quick shorts with them, on existing sets. If he did any funny business during these impromptu films, he frequently incorporated this into later works. He even started a few projects that were never finished, one of which shows Charlie as a down-on-his-luck `Professor' who owns a flea circus, temporarily abandoning his Tramp character.

""Unknown Chaplin"" is a documentary almost solely devoted to the filmmaker's work. The few references to his personal life are made because they somehow affected his professional work. Because of this ""Unknown"" presents one of the most thorough, interesting and illuminating looks at one of film's true masters and true pioneers.",1136764800,62,5679,4.943396226415095
387450,5,6301934946,"I have long owned the three-tape vhs version of this title.  In the days before David Shephard, et al. put out all those magnificent restorations (and before Warner Bros. rereleased some early Chaplins), this series was the ONLY place to find high quality Chaplin films, albeit not complete, and incredible outtakes.  I can't recommend this series enough to any Chaplin fan.  My pre-order is on file!!",1128124800,14,401,5.045454545454546
387451,5,6301934946,"I taped this off the air when it was first broadcast, then bought the LD's when they came out.  Seeing that a DVD release is not likely, I treasure them-a wonderful documentary!",1078876800,3,177,4.53125
387452,5,6301934946,"This absolutely astonishing set of tapes shows Charlie Chaplin at work on some of his greatest films.  What a unique experience to see one of the true geniuses of cinema hone his art!  You get to watch gags and storylines evolve as he painstakingly experiments before the cameras.  There's even an amazing moment when Chaplin, in his Little Tramp costume, angrily turns and berates a talkative extra on the set of ""The Immigrant.""  If you love Chaplin, this collection is a little bit of heaven.",1008374400,7,495,4.788235294117647
387453,5,6301934946,"I agree this is a wonderful set.  All the more impressive when one understands that the ""out-takes"" referred to in other reviews were supposed to be destroyed!  Chaplin filmed his rehersals and played them back later, watching to see how jokes worked best. At times he'd do over a hundred takes until he had the gag worked out the way he wanted.  Today, with video that doesn't seem like a big deal, but for him to film it all was an extremely large investment made by a true comic artist.  After the film was complete, Chaplin ordered all this extra footage burned.  Only because someone disobeyed did this material survive to be seen today.
Another great feature of this set (along with Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow and Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius) is interviews with surviving co-workers who share their personal memories of Chaplin.  Even during the time between the Chaplin and the Lloyd series, many of those interviewed had passed away. Recreating this documentary today would be impossible. Get this set and look back on a parade that has gone by.
Highly recommended, especially for those interested in history and film production.",973036800,13,1149,4.836734693877551
387533,5,6301934946,"This delightful documentary shows the secrets of many clever tricks that were a mystery until two film historians studied Charles Chaplin's works.

387534,5,6301934946,"This is a fascinating documentary giving a glimpse into how Chaplin made his films, which was an amazingly inefficient process on the surface. In a nutshell, he filmed everything as he began to work out gag ideas, story ideas, costume ideas, casting changes - all of it done while the camera was rolling. As you watch the process unfold you see where he experimented along the way, looking for just the right combination of these elements to tell the story. If you are a huge Chaplin fan or just the casual fan, you'll enjoy this documentary. Highly recommended.",1311465600,,562,4.744897959183674
387535,5,6301934946,"Charlie Chaplin was very secretive about the way he worked, his biography generalising his methods almost to the point of obscurity, making this 1983 documentary from the makers of the classic Hollywood TV series and compiled from Chaplin's archive of out-takes one of the most important pieces of cinematic archaeology ever produced. Deleted scenes and post-edit point footage (when the camera continues to roll for a few seconds after the action has finished to allow the editor leeway) throw light on his approach as Chaplin is seen losing his temper, breaking up with laughter and, most revealingly, looking on with mounting disappointment at an uninspired actor in an out-take from The Immigrant.

Following an uncomfortable introduction by Geraldine Chaplin, the first episode deals with his two-reelers for Mutual and has the lion's share of the rediscovered footage but no interviews, since there were no living survivors of the period at the time the series was made.

Working with no script but a basic idea, Chaplin used the props and sets as a springboard, rehearsing on film, and it is the out-takes that show how he would chisel away at an idea until he found something that would work, constantly refining it. The highlights of the first episode are the development of The Cure and, particularly, The Immigrant, both of which started out very differently to the finished product.

Some of the scenes were cut for obvious reasons, but there are gems along the way, such as Charlie playing traffic cop with wheelchairs in The Cure. There are also plenty of good ideas that went wrong, such as the dance of the cleaning ladies from Behind the Screen: elaborately staged sequences that were cut, such as a joke involving a real axe from the same short and a special effects sequence using double-exposure to have two Doc Stones in the same shot.

The second episode has the bonus of several interviews: Dean Reisner (the irritating child from The Pilgrim), Jackie Coogan (the child star of The Kid and, in later years, Uncle Fester in The Addams Family), director Robert Parrish (who played a child newsboy in City Lights), Lita Grey (the child actress in The Kid who became Chaplin's child bride), Georgia Hale (who replaced her in The Gold Rush and, subsequently in Chaplin's affections) and Virginia Cherrill (the blind girl in City Lights).

He would frequently call off production, reshoot with different actors and sometimes take months on a single scene. The show provides a striking example in the sequence where the Tramp meets the blind Flower Girl in City Lights, seen in home movie footage of Chaplin directing: by the 534th day of filming, only 166 days had been spent working against 368 idle, making Stanley Kubrick look speedy by comparison. There's also footage of Churchill's visit to the set and a fascinating reshot ending with The Gold Rush's Georgia Hale after he fired Virginia Cherrill.

The third episode is the thinnest, but has ample compensations. There is footage of Chaplin guest conducting the Abe Lyman orchestra in 1923, doing the dance of the bread rolls at a party, out-takes from a short he made with Harry Lauder to raise money for wounded British soldiers and some fascinating demonstrations of how his on-camera fooling around with visitors to his studio sparked ideas that would be fully reworked into later films. Chaplin had a mind like an attic - he might discard ideas, but he would never throw them away, as is demonstrated by The Idle Class, which grew out of a (much funnier) abandoned Mutual short with Albert Austin.

The highlights of the final episode are The Professor, an abortive attempt to get away from the Tramp character that saw Chaplin in Eric Campbell-style bushy eyebrows as a flea circus act forced onto hard times and losing his performers in a doss house; the original opening sequences from Modern Times (both rather drawn out); and, best of all, a full nine minutes from The Circus, later described by Chaplin as the most miserable experience of his life, including a scene in which Charlie tries to learn tightrope walking on a rake and a hysterically funny sequence with some fish. There are the domestic scenes cut from Shoulder Arms because distributors wanted a short rather than another feature.

The picture quality is very good indeed, although, perversely, due to the decades of duping, the extracts from the finished films are of vastly inferior quality to the out-takes (sadly, the extras give a hint of why this is - because of legal wrangles with Raymond Rohauer that stretched on for years, much of the material was never preserved on film because a deal couldn't be made: when it finally was years later, much of the material was beyond preservation). With narration by James Mason underlining the quality of the series, this is easily one of the most fascinating and unusual film documentaries ever produced, and comes very highly recommended. There's also a small but sweet extras package of out-takes from The Count, Chaplin's own gfootage of a visit to the set of A Dog's Life by Scottish comedian Harry Lauder and an interview with Kevin Brownlow.",1292716800,3,5145,4.939884393063584
387536,5,6301934946,"Unknown Chaplin may be a long documentary clocking in at over two and one half hours; but the time flew by as I watched it, fascinated by Chaplin's outtakes and the discoveries the filmmakers made about Chaplin's true working techniques. The narration by James Mason is done with great sensitivity and respect; and the pace of the story is easily good enough to hold almost anyone's attention. The musical score is also very well done including music by Chaplin; and there is a minimal amount of time spent on Chaplin's personal life so that we can truly learn how this great mastermind worked.

Chaplin was very secretive about his working techniques in his autobiographies; and no wonder--he might have been embarrassed to admit that he not only rehearsed with his other actors on film; he also filmed scenes many, many times just to get exactly what he wanted regardless of cost--and he didn't work from any script until very late in his career! This would be almost impossible today for financial reasons; but Chaplin didn't care what the cost was at that time; he wanted perfection and he almost always got it. The documentary is full of outtakes including his years at Mutual for which Chaplin did not own the rights; and this footage eventually made much of the documentary possible. We see how Chaplin weaved the story line along as he worked without a script; and the results are magnificent. I never would have guessed that he worked that way!

The documentary is split into three parts: ""My Happiest Years;"" ""Hidden Treasures"" (with many more outtakes that had never seen the light of day except when Charlie himself viewed them once or maybe twice) and ""The Great Director."" We see how Chaplin was very demanding of himself and his actors even though many of them were actually his pals; and again the footage is terrific.

It may seem as if I've given the whole thing away; but I assure you I haven't. Even if I had given it all away, you would still be awed by the footage this film provides. It's excellent! There are also interviews with people who worked with Chaplin on some of his greatest films including ""The Kid"" and ""City Lights."" Virginia Cherrill, Jackie Coogan, Lita Grey and Georgia Hale and others all reminisce about working with Chaplin and Chaplin as an artist; and that's grand.

There may be some who will say that since Chaplin wanted much of this footage destroyed that this documentary is disrespectful of him and his wishes--and they have a point. On the other hand, however, it's equally true that you'll love watching this great master working so hard to make outstanding, classic films that are very special even in our times.

The DVD comes with a few bonuses; there's a commentary by one of the filmmakers and I especially liked ""The Making of The Count.""

Unknown Chaplin is essential for any Chaplin fan or any fan of silent cinema; film buffs and historians would also do well to get this for their collections.",1290038400,2,2956,4.7412451361867705

387538,5,6301934946,"I am so happy that I bought this documentary about Chaplin. I have seen his movies since I was 12 years old. The three parts of this documentary are so full of material never before seen in public. It is based on Chaplin's out takes, as well as it shows Chaplin's working method as well as it shows how he rehearsed on film.

James Mason is the voice for this documentary, and there couldn't have been a better choice for it. There are interviews with different people involved with Chaplin at one point, some of his leading ladies, Jackie Coogan, Sydney Chaplin (his son) and commentaries of people who worked with him as well.

In the special features the producers tell you how they obtained these cans of Chaplin out takes. The only flaw is that it states in the DVD cover that there is an introduction by Geraldine Chaplin, which is not in the disc at all.

If you are a Chaplin fan, it is a MUST. If you are not, this is a great way to start and learn from the Master at Work!",1255392000,,982,4.268817204301075

Narrated by British actor James Mason,  I can easily understand his accent, but his tone of voice is sometimes a little too mellow, reedy, and mumbly, making the pronunciation of a few words hard to catch.  A deaf person can easily follow the story of any of Chaplin's films through the visuals alone, and maybe with even less of the spare subtitles given in the originals (such as when a character speaks and words are needed beyond what can be expressed in body language).

Andrews DVD Review: Everybody knows the hat, the cane and the moustache that symbolises the greatest comic genius ever to be captured on film. But who knows the secrets of this genius, especially the man behind the mask? UNKNOWN CHAPLIN uses never before seen footage, entire scenes cut from the final release prints, and footage long thought destroyed; along with interviews with some of Charlie Chaplins closet friends and associates to uncover the mystery, the excitement and the laughter, that were behind the scenes and in front of the cameras for Charlie Chaplins most hilarious work. Thames Television was very grateful for all their support they received and especially thanked, Oona O'Neill Chaplin, Lady Chaplin for her assistance in helping to make this special documentary series.

""Genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,"" said the English social reformer Jane Ellice Hopkins. An easy sentiment if you are an artist whose materials consist of nothing more than a pen and a blank page or paints and canvas. However, when your medium is motion pictures, taking pains can mean thousands of dollars a minute and studio heads breathing down your neck while you wait for that drop of inspiration. Charles Chaplin was a genius, a genius of movie comedy.

Charlie Chaplin never meant them to be seen. His brother Sydney Chaplin, who jealously guarded his brother's business enterprises, avidly collected all of the out-takes and unused sequences from his famous sibling's movies from 1916 onwards, keeping them in a warehouse at the Charlie Chaplin's studio. When Charles Chaplin left America during the Red Scare of the early 1950's, he sent word back to his loyal cameraman of 40-plus years, Roland Totheroh, to destroy every bit of this massive collection.

Why did Charlie Chaplin want it all destroyed? This may never be known. Roland Totheroh was too good an employee to question the wishes of his long-time employer, so he gathered all the material and sent it off to the incinerators. Somehow, however, a lot of the reels did not reach the flames. Instead, this incredibly valuable footage found its way into the hands of Raymond Rohauer, the Los Angeles-area film collector. Raymond Rohauer may have enjoyed watching the material privately, but there was nothing he could do with it. If word had gotten back to Charlie Chaplin that the footage still existed, he would almost certainly have demanded it be destroyed.

It was only after Charlie Chaplin's death, that British Film Historian Kevin Brownlow and his documentary-making partner David Gill discovered Raymond Rohauer's stash while making their series Hollywood [1980]. Coordinating with the Charlie Chaplin estate, Brownlow and Gill recovered the material from Raymond Rohauer, receiving a van tightly packed with reel after reel of unseen Chaplin footage. Some of the material, sadly, had deteriorated beyond repair due to nitrate damage, but the rest provided an incredible insight into the work of the most famous filmmaker of all time. UNKNOWN CHAPLIN is divided into three just over 52 minute segments.

MY HAPPIEST YEARS: In Episode 1 for the UNKNOWN CHAPLIN Television series sees the documentary crafted from the Charlie Chaplin material acquired by David Gill and Kevin Brownlow for Thames Television, deals with a handful of shorts Charlie Chaplin made in 1916 and 1917. The first in the trilogy covers the period Charlie Chaplin spent with the Mutual Film Company, for whom he made twelve two-reel comedies. Charlie Chaplins early working methods are unknown, thanks to his habit of ordering his out-takes be burned. Happily, he was not always obeyed and hundreds of cans of uncut rushes from the Mutual Film Company period were made available by Raymond Rohauer [1924  1987] who was an American film collector and distributor. By assembling them in slate order, David Gill and Kevin Brownlow were able to discover the progression of Charlie Chaplins ideas. Working without a script, Charlie Chaplin developed his story in front of the camera. We follow Charlie Chaplin through the hard work of improvising a film, only to watch him throw it away and start again. Unseen for nearly seventy years, this was perhaps the first example of cinema archaeology and the acquisition of these out-takes represented the coup of the century. Original ITV Transmission was on the 5th January, 1983. Running Time: 52:16

THE GREAT DIRECTOR: In Episode 2 of this brilliant David Gill and Kevin Brownlow's Television documentary series, and we see just how painful it sometimes was to bring that genius to the screen. Charlie Chaplin became independent in late 1917 and built his own studio, on very English lines. Charlie Chaplins first film was never released and was entitled How To Make Movies and it was a home-movie style tour of his new domain. The film was never even cut together, but Charlie Chaplin left cutting notes and part of it opens this programme. First up in this special is Dean Reisner who appeared as a child in the film The Pilgrim [1923]. Next up is Jackie Coogan and Lita Grey Chaplin talking about the film The Kid. Lita Grey Chaplin played in The Gold Rush before her pregnancy complicated matters and led to her being replaced by Miss Georgia Hale. Miss Georgia Hale, who had always refused interviews, talks compellingly about The Gold Rush. Suddenly over the horizon sound arrived, but Charlie Chaplin continued in making silent films. City Lights starred Miss Virginia Cherrill, another who had consistently refused interviews. Miss Virginia Cherrill describes Charlie Chaplins dissatisfaction with her, and how he fired her and how Miss Virginia Cherrill was reinstated. The film City Lights became Charlie Chaplins most successful and most admired picture. With stills, camera tests and rushes new light is thrown on all these famous classics. Other contributors include Robert Parrish, Alaistair Cooke and Sydney Chaplin. Original ITV Transmission was on the 12th January, 1983. Running Time: 52:24

HIDDEN TREASURES: In Episode 3 of the wonderful David Gill and Kevin Brownlow's Television documentary series, who say it is not so much a documentary series, David Gill and Kevin Brownlow thinks it should be entitled as the ""Deleted Scenes"" section. Here we see the rarest of pearls material that Charlie Chaplin felt did not quite reach the standard for a final release. For him it was not a waste. Much of this excised material would return in a re-worked form in his later films. For Charlie Chaplin he felt he made the films for fun, films e shot and then abandoned, sequences cut from such famous films as City Light and Modern Times, none of which had been seen before this documentary television series was first transmitted. More than this it includes, in a film discovered in Kansas City, an incredibly rare scene where Charlie Chaplin performing the dance of the bread rolls, from the film The Gold Rush at a New York party in 1926. One small detail in another out-take provides an interesting commentary on the new world of celebrity that began with Charlie Chaplin. In a section on films of famous visitors to Charlie Chaplin's studios, we see Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark joking with Charlie Chaplin and his co-star Edna Purviance, and then participating in a skit on the set of Sunnyside [1919]. At the beginning of the 20th, however, there was still a huge gulf between the potential leader of a nation and a mere clown in the movies. Charlie Chaplin's worldwide celebrity kicked down those barriers as easily as his tramp gave the boot to his enemies' backsides. This film clip is a small treasure among the many recovered for this three-part series that provides a look behind the scenes at the creator of a lowly tramp who became one of the most important people in the world. Original ITV Transmission was on the 19th January, 1983.  Running Time: 52:16

DVD Video Quality  With the amazing forethought and determination of David Gill and Kevin Brownlow, this brilliant three-part documentary series is brought to you by Thames Television, FremantleMedia and Network brings you this amazing video experience in the usual DVD image quality of 480i, and of course as expected in the aspect ratio of 1.33:1. The picture is really quite good overall, even though it hasn't been restored. The image does have some grain and there are some spots even in the more recent interviews. The images can sometimes now and again can seem a little bit on the soft side now and again, but that is because of the age of the material that was available at the time, and is of course an average looking picture for a DVD from the television series in 1983. What a shame they could not re-issue this onto a British Film Institute Blu-ray disc, as it would be worth it. There are no subtitles available.

DVD Audio Quality  Once again with the help of the brilliant David Gill and Kevin Brownlow, Thames Television, FremantleMedia and Network brings you this amazing two channel soundtrack is very solid and fits the TV Series very well. The musical accompaniment comes through very clear and there is a good amount of dynamic range. Narrated by the brilliant theatrical actor James Mason's whose smooth voice is so easy to listen to and comes through extremely well and there were not any audio defects worth noting, especially with the material that was only available at the time the television series was made.

DVD Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: How UNKNOWN CHAPLIN Was Made [1983] [480i] [1.33:1] [13:00] Here we are introduced to Kevin Brownlow, talking about his work with the late David Gill and describes the discoveries that led to the making of the UNKNOWN CHAPLIN Thames Television series and the story of its production. Kevin Brownlow talks about how the process started when they were both working on the television series entitled HOLLYWOOD and wanting to use clips from the early rare Mutual films of Charlie Chaplin, but to do so they were quoted 100,000 a minutes use, so they were left adrift in not knowing what to do. So they resorted to write to Charlie Chaplin personally, but never got a reply back, even though he was still alive at the time. Then suddenly they came into contact with David Robinson who is the official biographer of Charlie Chaplin and his book, Chaplin: His Life and Art, which was first published in 1985 and suggested they contact Rachel Ford, who was a daughter of a First World War General, who was Charlie Chaplin's 'legendary' business manager, who jealously kept all the films of Charlie Chaplin and when Kevin Brownlow and David Gill met her at the Denham Laboratories, and she was not very nice to them, in fact she was very off hand, but eventually both of them was led down to the vault and astonished to see hundreds of film cans of the famous Charlie Chaplin films and were allowed to see short glimpses of the very rare film How To Make Movies and were bowled over by what they viewed and was informed that Charlie Chaplin made the film for fun, which Kevin Brownlow could not believe what he heard, they also saw the rare seven minutes clip from the film City Lights that was never used in the film and that was the only piece of film they were allowed to use in their Television Series HOLLYWOOD. So this inspired them to go onto to make UNKNOWN CHAPLIN three part Television Series, but feared it would never materialise. But out of the blue they heard about a collector of rare Charlie Chaplin memorabilia, especially the films and his name was Raymond Rohauer and would only meet David Gill for lunch once a month and told him about his hidden gems of cans of Charlie Chaplin rare films, and it took 18 months of negotiations to secure these rare archive films and eventually arrived from France into the UK in a massive truck, but Kevin Brownlow was not allowed to be there, as Raymond Rohauer was jealous of him because he was a massive collector of old films, but eventually they got start on the work and eventually found they had 300,00 feet of Mutual Film Company films and 400,00 feet of Sydney Chaplin films and they were in the original negative form, and thought it would be impossible to sort it all out due to technical problems. Kevin Brownlow tells us that with the film The Immigrant which was a two-reel film, that Charlie Chaplin shot the same length of film that D.W. Griffith shot for his film Intolerance, but despite the expensive way Charlie Chaplin filmed The Immigrant, the end results speaks for itself. But while David Gill and Kevin Brownlow was sorting out this amount of negative film, eventually that came into contact with David Shepard who is a film preservationist for the Film Preservation Associates company, and informed them both of another massive collection of rare Charlie Chaplin films they could use and it took another 18 months of negotiation to secure the rights to use these films. When UNKNOWN CHAPLIN was finally finished, it was show to all the Executives and one of them in a drunken stupor, informed David Gill it was the worst thing he had ever witnessed, which really upset David Gill. But eventually David Gill and Kevin Brownlow were invited to the Colorado Film Festival where they showed UNKNOWN CHAPLIN and the crowds went wild and fell about the floor laughing uncontrollable and the reason for this is because they showed the films on a massive 25 feet screen, whereas the Executives only viewed it on a very tiny screen and they is why you should only view Charlie Chaplin films on a big screen, as that is the best viewing experience. But now the UNKNOWN CHAPLIN has been preserved onto this DVD, now future generations can enjoy this classic Television Series for many years to come, especially now that people have large Widescreen Televisions to view this Thames Television production and to savoir the genius of Charlie Chaplin who was the ultimate master of comedy timing and it is only through the dedicated efforts of David Gill and Kevin Brownlow, UNKNOWN CHAPLIN has been preserved forever on this brilliant Thames Television and Network DVD.

Special Feature: The Making of The Count [1983] [480i] [1.33:1] [13:30] All the Mutual Film Company out-takes used in the UNKNOWN CHAPLIN were transferred to video tape directly from the original nitrate negatives. No resources were available at that time to preserve them onto film. After completion of the series the nitrate negatives languished in a vault in the United Kingdom. Attempts to arrange preservation failed for financial reasons, and were further complicated by the death of Raymond Rohauer in 1987. Almost ten years after this a preservation, a deal was finally agreed with the Raymond Rohauers Estate and the British Film Institute which enabled the national Film & Television Archive to copy and preserve the rare out-takes. This was only possible with substantial support of Pamela Paumier, who had at the time retired as head of the Charlie Chaplins business activities, but sadly passed away at the age of 73, who helped towards the production of the UNKNOWN CHAPLIN, and in helping towards digitizing all of the rare Charlie Chaplin archives, that was originally used with the previously-unpublished material on the original NTSC LaserDisc. The British Film Institute hired Film Historian Frank Scheide to catalogue the out-takes. Frank Scheide found that some of the footage used in UNKNOWN CHAPLIN was already beyond saving. But other new material also came to light. Here Frank Scheide shows you scenes from the out-takes on how THE COUNT [1916] was made and what you witness is some stunning image quality, despite with the restriction of the 480i encoded image. Also Frank Scheide goes into great detail on how Charlie Chaplin worked out the story line for THE COUNT, which was a very long process to get it how Charlie Chaplin wanted it to appear on the cinema screen and a lot of the comic scenes you view, was of course Charlie Chaplins background in the English Music Hall scene and experience. You also get to view some amazing scenes that were left on the cutting room floor, which is a shame, as they were brilliant to watch. Piano Music composed and played by Neil Brand.

Special Feature: Charlie Chaplin Meets Harry Lauder [1918] [480i] [1.33:1] [8:45] This short film, featuring Charlie Chaplin and Harry Lauder, was made to raise money for the Harry Lauder Million Pound Fund for Maimed Men, Scottish Soldiers and Sailors that were wounded during the Great War and is a rare opportunity to see two of the twentieth-century's greatest comedians side by side. Harry Lauder had some personal experience when he lost his son, Captain John Lauder of the Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders, who was killed during the last months of the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and now devoted much of his time and effort towards this Fund, who eventually erected a memorial in memory of his son near the family home on the Glenbranter Estate in Argyll. Harry Lauder went onto be Knighted in January 1919 by King George V for his services to the war effort and his extensive charitable work. The short film was shot at the newly opened Charlie Chaplin film studio on the 22nd January, 1918. Some of it was filmed on sets built for A DOGS LIFE [1918], which had begun production the week before. This is Charlie Chaplins rough-cut; there is no evidence of it having been shown to the public. Harry Lauder was a stage vaudevillian whose world renown at his peak rivalled that of Charlie Chaplin's, although his success was mostly limited to music hall venues. In this short film, Harry Lauder joined Charlie Chaplin for a couple of skits, including mimicry of each other's well-known gait. At the end of the short film you get to view some deleted scenes that were filmed in the employment set for the film A DOGS LIFE. Piano Music composed and played by Neil Brand.

Finally, way back in the mist of time I had the double NTSC LaserDisc distributed by IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT and even then I was bowled over by such a magic presentation of the genius of Charlie Chaplin and was blown away with some much rare images of a comic genius at work, but of course the LaserDisc format went the way of other old video formats and luckily the company Network finally released it onto this DVD, and viewing this DVD brought back so many happy memories of once again seeing this brilliant Thames Television series. With UNKNOWN CHAPLIN [1983] and if you have more than a passing interest and fascination in finding out how the genius of Charlie Chaplin and indeed the early days of cinema and film making process, you need to view this brilliant DVD. The sheer volume of information and footage gives you such a lot of mileage for your money! UNKNOWN CHAPLIN is one of the most wonderful insights into the processes of an artist ever provided. Had Charlie Chaplin succeeded in having this material consigned to the flames, it would have been an incalculable loss, not only for film lovers, but also the history of 20th Century art and the world, I wish they would re-issue you it onto a Blu-ray disc. Highly Recommended!

7817965,5,6301934946,"Among others areas explored, the three chapter documentary THE UNKNOWN CHAPLIN
 offers genuine insights into how he worked as a director.

Although his films, especially the early comedies, look almost casual in their creation, Chaplin often took dozens of takes, carefully analyzing each to see what made a sequence work or fail. A perfect example is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-CURE/dp/B00MKWY0DO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE CURE</a>&nbsp;(1917), a two-reeler set at a health spa. Charlie agonized over the opening scenes of this comedy, even going so far as recasting parts and changing roles himself. He also rearranged some features of the main set to allow for bits of physical ""business"" not otherwise possible.

Yet in so doing, there were some genuinely funny sequences that had to be scrapped, such as Chaplin acting as traffic cop for a crowd of patients in wheelchairs. This because he chose after production began to play the Inebriate, a role Charlie had perfected years earlier in British music hall sketches. The original outtakes however still exist and are presented in this marvelous documentary.

We see the creation of a charming piece that was dropped from the opening of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CITY-LIGHTS/dp/B00017LVN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CITY LIGHTS</a>&nbsp;(1931), seven minutes of pantomime involving a sidewalk grate with a piece of wood wedged in it. Charlie in his Little Tramp persona tries and repeatedly fails to push the wood through the grate with the tip of his cane. His frustrated efforts eventually attract a crowd of onlookers. It works well, yet director Chaplin decided this sequence unnecessarily delayed the real story, so he abandoned the finished scene. It's shown here in its entirety.

There's fragments of pictures not completed, home movies, blooper outakes, plus other unusual and always interesting clips.
For fans of this great slapstick clown, also for any silent film aficionado, THE UNKNOWN CHAPLIN is a must-see!
Highest recommendation.",1408665600,3,2107,5.9635761589403975
7817966,4,6301934946,"This documentary has many things going for it.

 * One, it is narrated by marvelous, mellow  voice of James Mason.

 * Two, it consists of a series of outtakes taken from Chaplin's film. Cans and cans of these outtakes were discovered in the possession of a film collector, and provide a good look at Chaplin's artistic process in developing the stories and gags featured in his films. Chaplin usually threw his outtakes away, so the mere fact that these takes were found at all was noteworthy.

 * Three, it features archival interviews of the surviving participants of Chaplin's films, most prominently Jackie Coogan, who much later in his career was Uncle Fester in the Munsters.

 * Four, the documentary was made by the same people who produced the mini-series Hollywood, a documentary about silent films which was shown on PBS many years ago but is unfortunately very difficult to find.

 With all these elements going for it, this documentary is highly recommended, but ....
 The goal of this documentary is to show the artistic process of Charlie Chaplin through these newly-discovered outtakes. Take after take is shown that shows how he developed the films we all know and love.

 While this documentary is obviously the result of painstaking research and production, I believe the seemingly endless progression of the numerous takes Chaplin employed to develop his themes will prove too tedious for the casual viewer.

 The glue that holds this documentary together is the narration of James Mason, who if not the Voice of God, is surely second in command, and the judicious use of interviews to break the monotony . And of course there is the good fortune of seeing Charlie Chaplin out of the familiar context of his films.

 For the graduate film student this documentary is highly recommended and serves as a textbook on movie-making. This is also recommended for the Chaplin. For everyone else it will probably prove too monotonous to maintain any interest.",1405814400,4,1972,4.960365853658536
