8547228,2,B00A6VXM0S,"I bought this because I was looking for a good Blu-Ray to show off 3D technology... this, I'm afraid, isn't it.  I suppose if you have limited exposure to 3D this might be cool, but I found most scenes had little depth, and many had none.  As a stunt spectacular, it did have some pretty impressive stunts, but if this is what you are looking for, you might as well just pick up the 2D version, as the 3D didn't add enough for me to make it worth the effort.",1413849600,,458,4.0777777777777775
