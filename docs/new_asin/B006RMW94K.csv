8503610,1,B006RMW94K,"The creators/participants seemed to have no understanding that telling white chorus members to act like ""Aunt Jemima"" was an inappropriate or problematic thing to say. It can be used as a teaching tool about how to talk about racial appropriation -- if that's your goal.",1465516800,,270,5.022222222222222

8503612,4,B006RMW94K,"It is a nice DVD, but it would be difficult to learn the music using it.",1409961600,,72,3.5625
8503613,1,B006RMW94K,"I was somewhat disappointed in the DVD. I was under the impression that this was a concert I would enjoy watching, but it was not. I should have read up on a little more before ordering.",1401148800,,186,4.194444444444445
8503614,4,B006RMW94K,"My husband and I were expecting a Black presentation, and were surprised to find an all caucasian group.  The next surprise was the excellent quality of the singing and the feelings put into the singing.  We did enjoy the DVD.",1392508800,,226,4.625
8503615,5,B006RMW94K,"As described on the item description and also on the back of the DVD itself, this documentary filming of the live concert version of Langston Hughes' original Broadway musical is fun from beginning to end. It recreates the original songs from the 1960's production and brings them to a more universal staging that is enjoyable on a whole different level. It taught me the joys of gospel music and what it means to all kinds of singers.",1392422400,,435,4.662337662337662
8503616,2,B006RMW94K,"I bought this expecting to hear a concert of the songs from the original play. It was more like a rehearsal of the songs (and not a good one). Classical voices singing black gospel is not pleasing to the ear. I applaud the effort but the result was not positive. I guess I will never hear what it should have sounded like, because the current movie does not contain these original songs.",1388188800,2,387,4.388888888888889
