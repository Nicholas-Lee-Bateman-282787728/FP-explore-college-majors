5838857,4,B00DOZNI8Y,"I never believed in posting reviews of something before it comes out. This exception is in response to the one person who did. When you consider you're getting 4 classic Corman films on Blu-ray, The Fall of House of Usher (1960), The Pit and the Pendulum (1961), The Haunted Palace (1963), and The Masque of the Red Death, it is quite the treasure. 4 stars just for them. Star number 5 could be given but I've never cared for Witchfinder General being that it's from the period that thought more blood or nudity would help a film. This is exactly what Hammer tried which is why most of their last films are just trash ( sorry to those who like them ) compared to their early classic horror. The 2 Dr. P films are ok ( only the first on this set ) but would be better served if they were together on a separate set by themselves for those who would want them ( I wouldn't and don't think they would sell well ). The Raven, Comedy of Terrors or any of the others from their period would have been great, but most likely due for a second set ( with later Price films as filler) should this sell. House of Wax could sell by itself, and House on Haunted Hill really doesn't offer much unless included on a set like this one with better films. Perhaps they will show up. Either way if it's Shout Factory the odds are in favor of great transfers, and it's great that Mr. Vincent price be given the Blu-ray treatment.",1372809600,25,1409,4.2611940298507465

It would be a different story if these titles were available separately on blu ray, but I think the majority of people would agree these two films is what Vincent Price is most famous for--and to not include them in this collection was a HUGE mistake

5838943,5,B00DOZNI8Y,"Vincent Price Collection

As I look at reviews I see way too much complaining on why this film and not this one was included. The 6 films included aren't bottom of the barrel people. Companies like Scream Factory, Blue-Underground and so on cannot just release anything they want unless that film is public domain. You have to license the rights and that's why sometimes different companies release the same film later on as the license runs out and its not renewed and another company gets it. Very rarley do these companies purchase the rights to own the films. As for this collection why did Scream Factory secure the rights for these films and not others? Well that could be that these are the films they wanted, another company may have licensed the rights to other films, the price (no pun intended) was too high or multiple people having a piece of ownership couldn't work it out.

Regardless on why Scream Factory ended up with the 6 films they did this is what we got and I'm for one sure glad we got them. There are 6 films on 4-discs.

Disc 1

Pit and the Pendulum
Masque of Red Death

Disc 2

Haunted Palace
Fall of the House of Usher

Disc 3

The Abominable Dr. Phibes

Disc 4

Witchfinder General

The only actual complaint I have and this is just the OCD in me are the films are out of order. House of Usher was the first than Pit and the Pendulum followed by Haunted Palace and Masque of Red Death. Then Witchfinder General and lastly Dr. Phibes. Of course none of this truly matters, but it does bug the OCD in me.

All films are presented in 1080p and generally have pleasing transfers. As much as I love Scream Factory I find their HD presentations to be solid, but not among the best when compared to the likes of Blue-Underground and Synapse. All these films in the set look strong, but could have used a little more work. A couple of scenes in the Haunted Palace looks like it was shot behind a screen. These problems a side the quality is a step up over the DVDs, but I liked the transfers, but didn't love them. Audio is also solid and better than the DVD editions.

Any complaints have nothing to do with the films just wish Scream Factory did more of a touch up. It seems if it isn't a John Carpenter film they don't put as much work in. This isn't meant to knock Scream Factory since I often buy their releases and their HD quality isn't poor, but again when compared to other companies their HD presentations aren't as strong.

All the films come with some sort of special features from trailers, photo galleries, interviews and audio commentaries. Also included is a cool feature before and after every film (except Dr. Phibes) that was for Iowa public TV with Vincent Price where he chats about each film before and after. There is also a really cool feature on how they got Vincent Price to actually do it and how it was working with him. There is also an interview with Price's daughter.

If that wasn't enough we also get a 24-page booklet.

Despite the complaints from some fans of Vincent Price will want this set as will fans of Roger Corman (4 of the 6 films he directed).

Perhaps a few of your favorites were left off, but I explained why that could be. Regardless the 6 films included are among Price's best and Corman as well. Stop complaining about certain films not being here and just be happy you got anything at all.",1390003200,7,3362,4.423014586709886
5838944,5,B00DOZNI8Y,I got this collection for my dad for Christmas and he's having a ball reliving these movies he hasn't seen in some time.,1389052800,,120,4.260869565217392
5838945,5,B00DOZNI8Y,"Vincent Price has always been my favorite horror star.  When I was a kid and one of his films was released I was in the theater as quickly as possible.  This set releases 6 films that Price made for the great American International pictures on blu-ray for the first  time.  The set features 4 of the Roger Corman Poe films: Pit and the Pendulum, (my all-time favorite horror film,) House of Usher, Masque of the Red Death and Haunted Palace (more H.P. Lovecraft than Poe.)  It also features the brutal Conqueror Worm and legendary The Abominable Dr. Phibes.  (Since the films in this set were all made my AIP, now apparently owned by MGM/UA, some other legendary Price horror films like House on Haunted Hill, The Tingler, The Fly and Theater of Blood are not featured and probably will not be if MGM/UA releases another set of this nature.)
The films are all in high-def. blu-ray, and although I already own them on dvd, it was worth getting them for the high-def. alone.  However it is the special features that are really worthwhile.  5 of the 6 films feature introductions by Price himself as part of a series Price filmed for Iowa Public TV in 1982.  These are really wonderful: a tuxedoed Price sitting in front of a raging fireplace discussing the film about to be shown. (Sort of like when Price hosted ""Mystery"" on PBS.)  Some feature Price concluding comments as well.  There is a nice short on the Phibes blu-ray with the writer of those segments discussing the production of them and what a truly fine gentleman Price was, and what an absolute pleasure he was to work with.  There is also a list of the intros. Price did and there were many more than just the five featured on this set.  Therefore since, from what I've heard, this set has been selling very well, we could possibly see a part II with some of the other films Vincent did for AIP: Tales Of Terror, The Raven, Tomb of Ligeia, Master of the World, Comedy of Terrors,The Last Man on Earth and possibly one or two more of the lesser films Price did for them: The Oblong Box, Cry of the Banshee or Scream and Scream Again.  The introductions by Price are already there.
The set also features various interviews and commentaries with Roger Corman and others.  (For some reason, the audio commentary by Lucy Chase Williams, the author of The Films of Vincent Price, on The Haunted Palace ends abruptly and gets cut off halfway through the film.  I did not check the other commentary by film historian Tom Weaver on that same film.)
This very nice set also includes a 24 page booklet on Price and the films in this set with many excellent color and black and white photos.
In conclusion, this wonderful set features 6 of the very best of the horror films of Vincent Price.  Three of the five (Pendulum, Usher and Masque,) are part of my five favorite Price horror classics.  (The other two are House on Haunted Hill and The Fly.)  Even if you have all of them on dvd already like I do, if you are a fan of Vincent Price, the master of terror, you probably should get it.  Even though Christmas just ended, it probably would have made a great gift for the Price fan, it was my gift to myself and I am really enjoying it.  Highly recommended.",1387929600,4,3209,4.48881239242685
5838946,4,B00DOZNI8Y,"I love ""The Fall Of The House Of Usher"", it's the best film out of the collection and one of Price's best performances!

Would've liked to have seen a couple other films in the mix, ""House On Haunted Hill"", ""Ligeia"", ""Tales Of Terror"", ""The Raven"", and ""The Comedy Of Terrors"".

5838949,4,B00DOZNI8Y,"A Vincent Price six pack has made its way to Blu-Ray. The set features some of the actors most iconic roles, along with at least one surprise inclusion. It is by no means a complete collection, as it concentrates primarily on the late actors work with Roger Corman and AIP (since most of these movies were adapted from works by Edgar Allan Poe they are known as the Poe cycle). Even by that criteria, the collection is a mere introduction.

Price cemented his status as horror icon in Andre De Toths House of Wax (1953), despite the fact that that this 3D box office hit is a flat and unimaginative remake of Michael Curtiz vastly superior Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933). In a way, this parallels Price himself. Although he has been beatified by genre aficionados, and despite doing occasionally fine acting work, Price carefully crafted screen persona seems more derivative than innovative. That persona lacks the authenticity of a Lon Chaney, Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, or Dwight Frye. The passage of time makes that even more apparent. Still, the veteran actor could often supply a luster to pedestrian productions, without necessarily redeeming them.

Fortunately, this Blu Ray collection, although somewhat haphazard in concept and packaging, is a marketable compilation in a Vincent Prices Greatest Hits Volume One style. Like most such compilations, the choices deemed greatest are not without debate.

With The Fall of the House of Usher (1960) Roger Corman convinced AIP to give him an increased budget of $270,000 (which included color film) along with an extended shooting schedule ( a whole 15 days). Convincing the producers was no simple feat, as the film, with a literary source, lacked a identifiable monster. Somehow, Corman won Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson over when he pitched the house itself as the supernatural antagonist. While the film is not a masterpiece, Cormans enthusiasm, matched by Price, the surreal cinematography by Floyd Crosby (High Noon), Lex Baxters score, and screenplay by cult genre favorite Richard Matheson (The Incredible Shrinking Man), makes it possibly the best of the Corman Poe cycle. This assessment is shared by most critics and by Price himself (although, reportedly, the actors personal favorite of his own films was MGMs 1973 black comedy Theater of Blood).

Prices aristocratic bearing and pronounced theatricality makes the effete, sensitive, and cowardly Roderick Usher utterly convincing. There is more than a hint of an incestuous relationship between Roderick and his sister, Madeline (Myrna Fahey), leading to masochistic decay and fiery finale. Almost singlehandedly, Price carries the film in the acting department, with his co-stars going the distance in convincing us that protagonist family is indeed a bland lot. Remarkably, the film was a box office success. This, along with critical accolades, paved the path for seven additional Poe-inspired films.

With Barbara Steele looking to become the female Karloff after Mario Bavas hit Black Sunday (1960), the Price/Steele pairing in The Pit and Pendulum (1961) should have been a star teaming worthy of the Karloff/Lugosi collaborations of the 1930s. Unfortunately, Steele is wasted (and worse, dubbed) as the doomed (and believed dead) unfaithful wife-in-waiting. The team of Corman, Price, Matheson, Crosby, and Baxter return for this disappointing second entry. Pendulum is an eclectic low budget genre soaper, sloppily utilizing elements from numerous Poe stories. Steele isn't the only wasted talent. Reliable character actors Luana Anders and John Kerr, poorly directed, come off as surprisingly stiff and mechanical. At the polar opposite is Price at his hammy worst. His performance here is a cringe-inducing caricature. Crosbys atmospheric lens work, Baxters throbbing score, a predictable but still effective finale, and, briefly, Steele as a smoothly ornamented, darkly mysterious Tahitian pearl (barely) save Pendulum from being a total disaster.

If Pit and the Pendulum is the most overrated of the Poe cycle, then The Haunted Palace (1963) is possibly the most underrated. However, to call it a Poe-inspired film is a stretch. Actually, the films inspiration was The Case of Charles Dexter Ward by H.P. Lovecraft. The producers insistence on tying the project to the tried and true Poe moniker so incensed Corman that he intentionally had Poes name misspelled in the credits. The only actual connection to Poe is the title, supplied by a line from a poem.

The Haunted Palace is a pleasantly surprising entry here, since this subdued film is rarely mentioned in Corman/Price surveys. The adapted script, by Twilight Zone writer Charles Beaumont and an uncredited Francis Ford Coppola, is unfortunately conventional. However, Crosbys highly distinguished camerawork, good character work by Lon Chaney, Jr. and Elisha Cook, Jr, alongside superb performances by Debra Paget and Price add up to more than the sum of its parts. Price gives a good performance-and-a-half in the dual warlock role, even with script and makeup limitations. The Haunted Palace is a flawed sleeper with an aptly brooding score from Ronald Stein.

Along with 1964s The Tomb of Ligia (not included in this set), The Masque of the Red Death (1964) may be the most critically celebrated of the Corman/Price collaborations (although the former is overrated). Nicolas Roegs exquisite camerawork reinforces the view that it is the visuals of Cormans Poe films that we remember most. This is also the most decadently sensual of the cycle. With a $200,000 budget and an unheard of (for Corman and company) five week shooting schedule, Masque is the most lavish (and faithful) of the Poe adaptations. Hammer regular Hazel Court fulfills the promise of being sadistically buxom, and the slimy career trajectory of Patrick Magee (A Clockwork Orange) remains delightfully intact. Prices dark lord Prospero battling Jane Ashers virtuous Francesca are the eyes in Poes opulent and malevolent tempest. Again, Charles Beaumont adapted the screenplay, and Daniel Hallers production design would never be bettered.

Witchfinder General AKA The Conqueror Worm (1968) was Michael Reeves masterpiece and final film. Although the (alternate) title was taken from the Poe poem, the script (by Reeves and Tom Baker) is an adaptation of Ronald Bassetts novel about a historical puritan zealot. Prices stark performance is a perfect match for the films tone of unrelenting brutality. For once, Price is required to give an authentic performance, free of the usual histrionic tricks he learned in the genre trade. As good as Ian Ogily, Hilary Heath, and Price are in their respective roles, the movies primary flaw might be in the casting of the lead. Reeves originally envisioned Donald Pleasance for the role of Witchfinder Matthew Hopkins, and the character was not to be as a self-assured sadist. Rather, Reeves imagined Hopkins as the insecure son of a Puritanical Protestant minister, driven to the banality of evil, which takes form in the exposure of Catholic witches.  The final shot of the victimized Heath seems, in retrospect, a summary of the Charles Manson era; it leaves an unshakable taste of raw dread in its wake and remains dishearteningly contemporary in its visceral bleakness.

At the opposite end of a stylized spectrum is Robert Fuests stylish, art deco The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971). Prices hamminess is perfectly synchronized to this archetypical opus of the 1970s. Further coverage of this film can be found elsewhere on this site.

The extras in this box set include actor Ogilvys priceless commentary on his childhood friend Reeves, David Del Valles interview with Price, commentaries by Fuest and Corman, an interview with Prices daughter, an extensive essay by Del Valle, along with beautiful restoration work. Overall, this Shout! Factory release is indispensable for genre fans in general, as well as fans of this actor, Corman, Reeves, et al.

5838950,4,B00DOZNI8Y,"I would give this 5 stars normally.  I am a Vincent Price fan and owned these on DVD.

First the good. The bonus intros and outros by Vincent Price from a PBS broadcasting of these films is pure joy.  It makes the films 10 times better to watch even in their VHS quality.  Porting all the old bonuses from the DVD's is very pleasing as i enjoyed them as well.  Also, including the Sinister Image interviews is great for those who missed that DVD.

The movies look very good in general and are a very good improvement over the DVD versions... BUT

The Bad. I have read other reviews which stated that these movies look crisp and rich with no compression issues and i have found that to be a bit flawed.

I must admit that i am displeased that the movies i wanted quality for most were squished 2 movies per disc, while the ones i cared for less were given their own.  Do not get me wrong i enjoy all of these films, but House of Usher and Haunted Castle are 2 of my favorites followed by Pit and Red Death.  To say they didn't suffer compression?  Well, i am a bit a novice at video noise there are the typical untouched scratches and dirt, even a vertical line that goes through briefly, but blacks are not deep in darker scenes and there is often a bland greyish washed out mess to them in some cases.  Also, i believe it was in Pit and the Pendulum (hard to say i was watching them back to back) where Catherine was on a balcony outside speaking and her face became a ""stippled"" mess.  Not a long scene or anything, but bothered me a little.

Other than that yes these movies look better and are surely the best they have looked in a long time.  There is plenty of detail viewable in these transfers and for the most part the colors are very rich.

In the end a high quality product that could have been better, but i have no regret buying it... here is hoping they do it again with more PBS intros and outros and this time give my favorite Price film, Tomb of Ligeia it's own disc.",1383004800,4,1984,4.195250659630607
5838951,5,B00DOZNI8Y,"You know Vinny appeared in over 100 films and brought dignity to every role.  This collection is just a sampling of his work, that took the word low out of low budget horror movies.  I'll remember his performances in these flicks over a Tom Cruise blockbuster anytime.  No matter how flimsy a script or plot was, his unmistakable voice and attention to detail of character kept your attention.  In addition to this collection pick-up a copy of William Castles ""House On Haunted Hill"".  You'll have a nice summation of Vincent Prices career that will keep you wanting for more.",1382918400,2,576,4.777777777777778
5838952,4,B00DOZNI8Y,"Let me just preface this review in saying that I love these films, and this set provides THE best way available for viewing them. It even includes nice ""video bookends"" by Vincent Price (via Iowa Public Television) where he provides both an introduction to the films (5 out of the 6 anyway), as well as some closing words at the end. Even though these bookends weren't restored, it is still totally awesome to have Vincent Price himself introduce these films to us, any time we want!

However, the main items on this set, being the films themselves, were not given proper restoration. Not sure if SHOUT! couldn't afford to restore them, or didn't have permission, but it is a shame that the films were not given the same treatment as the Universal Monster films that were released in 2012 on Blu-ray. The films on the Vincent Price set still have visible film scratches, and the colors are slightly faded.

But like I said, simply releasing these on Blu-ray does provide us with the clearest prints to date. Plus, Pit and the Pendulum is finally in ANAMORPHIC widescreen, which is great. I do wish that Dr. Phibes Rises Again was included, instead of Witchfinder General (not that big of a fan), to go along with The Abominable Dr. Phibes on this set. Seems incomplete without it. Maybe they're saving it for a Volume 2?

Definitely worth picking up for fans of these films, even if you already own them on DVD. I just wish the films were properly restored, and that Dr. Phibes Rises Again was included.",1382659200,24,1503,4.642857142857143
5838971,4,B00DOZNI8Y,"Scream Factory shows their respect to one of horror's greatest leading men with ""The Vincent Price Collection."" The set includes six of his most memorable films for AIP (American International Pictures) released for the first time on Blu-ray. Many of these gothic treasures were directed by B-Movie King Roger Corman and based on the poems of Edgar Allan Poe.

Four discs make up ""The Vincent Price Collection."" Disc One consists of ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" and ""The Masque of the Red Death"" feature films and special features. The bonus material and movies for ""The Haunted Palace"" and ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" make up Disc Two. Disc Three contains ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes"" and its special features. ""Witchfinder General (aka The Conqueror Worm)"" and its bonus features close out the collection.

Most of the stories in ""The Vincent Price Collection"" take place in an old cursed gothic castle on a hill that overlooks a town full of frightened villagers. Vincent Price usually plays a disturbed prince or nobleman of some type plotting to kill his visitors or relatives in some ghastly manner. These plot points might all sound redundant, but Price, his co-stars and Roger Corman always deliver the thrills and chills.

All the films are presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen of some type. The pictures are vibrant and clean. All the colors and black levels look wonderful. The sound is DTS Master Audio Mono. These movies have never been heard in such clarity until now. The dialogue and rich musical scores scream out at the audience in terror.

Each of the six movies include special features. All but one of them has vintage introductions by Vincent Price himself. Audio commentary is provided on them as well, with Producer/Director Roger Corman speaking on his contributions to the set. It also contains interviews and trailers for the films. A 24-page book features an essay by author David Del Valle and rare production stills, promotional photos, and movie posters.

""The Vincent Price Collection"" is a treat for any fan of classic horror films. Every one of these movies is a masterpiece in its own right. They perfectly capture the wonderful filmmaking of Roger Corman and Vincent Price in their heydays. It's an absolute must-own item for genre collectors.",1382486400,3,2290,5.031662269129288
5838972,5,B00DOZNI8Y,"This is a wonderful collection of Vincent Price horror classics.  These versions have superior color to previous home video versions.  In the case of THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM, this transfer corrects an earlier, flawed DVD edition.

The supplements are a real treat in this set.  Most of the films have rare Vincent Price intros and outros that were filmed for an Iowa PBS TV station in the 1980's, which haven't been widely available before.  THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM has a rare prologue that was filmed for the movie's premiere on network television in the late 1960's.  In fact, the version of that prologue found in this set is more complete than the earlier release of it on MGM DVD.

There are also some interviews and/or audio commentaries with director Roger Corman, Price himself, Price's daughter Victoria Price, and authors Tom Weaver and Price biographer Lucy Chase Williams.  There's quite a bit of new material contained in the supplements, even for those who are habitual devotees of these films.

To those who are complaining about some ""missing"" titles, many of the titles they cite are actually the property of other studios.  For example, Warner owns HOUSE OF WAX (available on Blu-ray), Fox owns THE FLY (available on Blu-ray), Sony/Columbia owns THE TINGLER (available on DVD), and HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL might be public domain.  This set is a collection of films that Price did for American-International Pictures.

All in all, a great production from Shout Factory!",1382313600,39,1486,4.97165991902834
5838973,5,B00DOZNI8Y,"Received my Vincent Price Box Set set today directly from the Scream Factory and saved some money along the way - $ 10 to be exact. The quality of the films is fantastic. I was waiting a long time to see Vincent Price on Blu-Ray. I sincerely hope that someone will put out some more of his films on Blu-Ray, especially his best film ""Theatre of Blood"" and the second Dr. Phibes movie. He was a great actor and I wish there would be more actors around like him these days.

5838974,3,B00DOZNI8Y,"I will limit this to ""Masque"" as it was the only one I watched from start to finish.  I was disappointed with the transfer.  This is my favorite Price-Poe film and I wanted to see it done as well as possible.  I found the speckles, scratches, frame damage and splices very distracting.  Granted, they do not happen all the time but enough to take me out of the picture.  For me, the colors really only ""popped"" in the masque scene.  They look fantastic but there's one or two nasty splices there, also.  The good news is excellent contrast, clarity and sharpness.  The performances are first-rate, too.  Ms. Court really makes the film for me, too.  Not appreciated enough, I believe.  I am surprised a surround mix wasn't done for the audio.  Many films from the 60's (even '50s) have benefited from a good stereo re-mix.  I think most people will enjoy the film and maybe I'm being too picky but, as I said, it is my favorite of the Poe adaptations.",1382054400,3,951,4.491228070175438
5838975,5,B00DOZNI8Y,"This product is not yet released yet it is being reviewed. Why does Amazon allow this to happen? This and the practice of including all reviews of a title regardless of format make many reviews worthless. Also, just like those who voted for Obama, some of these are low information voters so allow me to enlighten you. ""The Tingler"", ""House of Wax"" and ""The Fly"" are owned by different studios which is why you don't see them on this set. ""House on Haunted Hill"" is in the public domain and could be included but the official studio release is through Warner. MGM made a deal with Shout/Timeless/TGG Direct to distribute some of the titles they control which is why you can now purchase some AIP and UA releases quite inexpensively. The 2 Price ""Dr. Goldfoot"" films as well as some of his other AIP pictures are available this way. Nobody wants to read reviews of the films from all of the Roger Ebert wannabees, we want to know about the quality of the product we are buying which can't yet be known. Amazon needs to keep reviews closed until the release date. I am rating this product only because I have to before I submit this.

5838976,4,B00DOZNI8Y,"I already own most of these titles, but not in Blu Ray, which wasn't around for many years to come.  I agree with the reviewer who decried the producers of this set for not including ""House on Haunted Hill"" and ""House of Wax,"" and of course that horror classic, ""The Fly.""  So I can only give the collection four stars, in solidarity.  Mr. Price was notorious for over-acting, but his overwrought expressions and mellifluous voice was, well... Price-less.  I think he may be one of the most underrated actors of his generation with an illustrious career that spanned generations.  He was never given his just due.  But maybe this boxed set will help correct that oversight.  If you have to overact, do it with the class and style of Vincent Price!  R.I.P.

This collection includes new and vintage bonus features. The six films: The Fall of House of Usher (1960), The Pit and the Pendulum (1961), The Haunted Palace (1963), Masque of the Red Death (1964), Witchfinder General (1968), The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971). Five of these films are the best of their generation and they remain in the Top 150 Horror Films of All-Time (The Haunted Palace is also included in this collection). This collection spans over a decade of Mr. Price's greatest work and is loaded with audio commentaries. All are worth watching but my favorite film would be Witchfinder General. Vincent Price himself regarded his performance in Witchfinder General as the finest of his horror movie career. It remains controversial as it deals with witch trials (still not a popular topic) not to mention the violence and sex was cut for a US release.

Overall, the picture and audio quality are above average with no major complaints. There is roughly 4 hours of total bonus content and 9 (!) audio commentaries. Many of the special features are exclusive to this release.

There are many more, to be sure.

PHIBES- represent a good portion of Vincent Price's output for AIP. These were all released earlier on MGM's MIDNITE MOVIES double feature DVDs. These are some of VP's best movies, w/ USHER allowing him to brood, PENDULUM bringing out his character's utterly insane vengeance, and WITCHMASTER showcasing his role as an eeevil, sadistic fraud. These are three of my personal favorites! I believe they capture him at his most sinister. PALACE is a wonderful Lovecraft tale.

It clearly states on the back of the box itself that this IS indeed a Region B Bluray Collection. However, it works without a hitch on my PS4. This is strange, because I have a Dracula Prince of Darkness region B bluray (that's put out by THE VERY SAME AUSTRALIAN COMPANY) and it does NOT work on my ps4 or ANY other bluray player that I own. Oh, believe me...I'm not complaining. I took a chance on this set (considering these films are not available on bluray even individually). There was a similar set put out in the US a few years back, but it has 2 or 3 less films and it has since gone out of print and you'll pay through the nose for it. Before purchasing, I heard a rumor that this set would definitely work on a US bluray player...but I also heard a rumor that it would NOT. I also considered that the people who said it DID work may have had an older set and the company has since changed their Bluray coding to indeed only work on Region B players. So, I took a chance for sure and told myself that if it didn't play, I'd just buy a region free bluray player (but I can't afford one right now). Words cannot properly convey as to how happy I am that this awesome set plays on my PS4. I just simply cannot wait to see Phibes and Witchfinder General in 1080p (not to mention all of the other films in this set).

All films are Region-B/2 you need a Region-Free or Region-2 player to view them. They seem to use the same transfers provided by MGM/Hollywood Classics that were utilized by Arrow and Shout!

8595506,5,B00DOZNI8Y,"I'm grateful to have snared this 5 star collection before it went OOP and the scalpers moved in.  Rest assure -- it's a treasure at any cost.  No one has come along with Mr. Price's wit, class or verve;  no one can.  He was one-of-a-kind and world that made him is gone forever.  Much of his finest work is preserved in these Shout Factory volumes, films many sneered upon back in the 50's 60's and 70's.
Well... I say the hallmark of a true professional is an ability to elevate *any* material, approach it as though it were Shakespeare or Ibsen.  Mr. Vincent Price did just that; he made the road rise to meet him.  (Even in clunkers like ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine'**  you can't find a frame where the Maestro isn't giving it his all.  That, brothers and sisters, is true class.)
Okay.  $150 to $200 is steep dues, no question about it.  But you'll never regret it.
Kudos to Shout Factory for these fine offerings.

**(Note: the two  Dr. Goldfoot movies are not in these SF collections, perhaps mercifully so in the opinions of some, though both are the textbook definition of ""guilty pleasures.""  I wouldn't mind seeing them included in the next volume, if SF produce another.  And ""Theater of Blood""...  please!)",1461715200,,1227,4.585253456221198
8595507,4,B00DOZNI8Y,"Vincent Price had a second act in his career that most actors could only dream of; after a career of playing character parts and leading man in a variety of classics like ""Laura"" and ""The Ten Commandments"", he became a leading man in horror films for American International Pictures during the 1960's and 1970's.

Price appeared in a variety of horror films but his most treasured and revered are probably the Corman-Price-Poe pictures that began in 1961. This set gathers these films including what many consider Corman's masterpiece ""The Masque of The Red Death"". One of Price's best pictures made with Robert Fuest an art director/production designer who got his start as a director on ""The Avengers"" before moving to feature films. ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes"" is a masterpiece of horror, camp and outrageous humor that both pokes fun at the genre having fun with it (not at the expense of the genre) AND being a classic 60's horror film. In fact, many could claim that it's almost a meta-horror film.

The discs aren't in order of the year of release date.

""The Pit & The Pendulum"" is on disc one an the transfer looks exceptionally good but keep in mind there was no restoration done here so there are occasional specs that pop up but the transfer itself is relatively clean looking with nice detail and color.

Unfortunately ""The Masque of The Red Death"", while having nice, vivid colors, has about four brief sections of the film where the negative has been damaged. The presentation is relatively clean with nice detail particularly in close ups. The dialog is crisp and clear for both films on disc one.

The special features include an introduction from Vincent Price created for the series of films when they ran on an Iowa PBS station (in SD) as well as the ""rare"" prologue shot after the fact to expand the running time of the film. There's also an audio commentary by producer/director Roger Corman on ""Pit"" but, sadly, we only get an interview discussion for ""Masque"" from Corman. Film historian and author Steve Haberman provides an interesting and detailed commentar for ""Masque"" and we get the theatrical trailers for both films.

""The Haunted Palace"" and ""The Fall of The House of Usher"" appear next and both look really good with nice looking transfers that have depth and detail far beyond what we saw on DVD. I suspect that these are fresh transfers done by Fox for the MGM library (MGM inherited the AIP catalog).

Both films receive audio commentaries--""Usher"" from Corman and ""Palace"" from noted authors Lucy Chase Williams and Tom Weaver. ""A Change of Poe"" is an interview with Corman about ""Palace"" which, while it fits into the Poe canon because of the title and poem, really is an adaptation of an H.P. Lovecraft novella entitled ""The Strange Case of Charles Dexter Ward"". Williams appears again on a second audio commentary commissioned for ""Usher"" which also features Piotr Michael. David Del Valle contributes an interview done with Price and both films have introductions by Price as well as theatrical trailers.

The third disc features ""Phibes"" all by itself with  an audio commentary by the late director Robert Fuest and a second audio commentary by author Justin Humphreys. We also get the theatrical trailer. Sadly, the second ""Phibes"" film isn't here but on the second volume of the set and that one has no commentary (although one was produced for the overseas version of the Blu-ray which, I suspect, Arrow Films may not have wanted to license out for was charging too much for).

The highly regarded horror/drama film ""Witchfinder General"" (aka ""The Conqueror Worm"" in the U.S.to tie it in to the Poe films) was based on a historical novel and adapted by the late director Michael Reeves. We get an audio commentary by the late actor Ian Ogilvy (who was a best friend of Reeves--they grew up together and he appeared in all three of Reeves' theatrical films) with the producer of the film Philip Waddilove. We also get a featurette on the film ""Witchfinder Genergal: Michael Reeves' Horror Classic"" as well as an hour interview with Vincent Price (in SD)  and the featurette ""Introductory Price: Undertaking The Vincent Price Gothic Horrors"". Finally we get the introduction by Price for the film as well as an interview with Price's daughter Victoria Price.

I was never all that impressed with Michael Reeves' ""Witchfinder General"" although it does give Price an excellent role where his acting is toned down to the material (which Reeves and Price argued about early on--Price came to believe that Reeves was right and was going to make another film with him before he died).

The set is handsomely packaged in an Amray case with a cardboard sleeve and includes a 24 page book with an essay by historian David Del Valle.

This is an exceptional set I just wish that MGM had been willing to pay for a proper restoration for ""The Masque of The Red Death"" as, I'm sure, the British interpositive could be located and the damaged footage could have been interpolated for the film (although the UK release of the film was edited by censors, that footage was not what was damaged here).

Each set of this series has some exceptional and no-so-exceptional (but always interesting) Price films. It's a pity that for the third set that Shout couldn't have licensed ""Theater of Blood"", ""Madhouse"" and ""Twice Told Tales"" (the later two have received U.S. Blu-ray releases and both of which are licensed to different companies at the moment) for that set as they would have fit in quite nicely with that set.

It's a pity that the license for all three packages are so limited. If you wait too long, you won't be able to find all three as they are a limited release and, once they go out-of-print Shout, at least, has no plans to reissue them immediately (although I did ask about a stand alone release for the two ""Phibes"" films similar to the Arrow release in the UK.

I recommend this set but fans should be aware that there are some issues with ""Death"" but the rest of the films received largely solid looking transfers and the special features from Shout (under their Scream imprint) are exceptional with many being ported over from earlier releases as well as some new ones, too.

Or double disc from MGM's Midnite Madness series. For a lot less than what Shout Factory (and some 3rd party sellers) is asking for. While some of these films are ""Must""

Such great horror films, the acting and story telling can not complain about these films. Can not wait to watch them in October of halloween.",1440028800,2,248,4.297872340425532
