1498859,5,B00005JLQW,"Talk to Her (Hable con ella) is Pedro Almodovar's sixteenth film as a director. It is difficult to describe the plot of the film as it travels back and forth in time, ranging from intense moments of psychological insight to an amusing silent film sequence, and I would loath to give away any of the entertaining and twisting plot development so characteristic of Almodovar's films. It primarily focuses on the relationship between two men: the antisocial, sexually ambiguous and lovingly charming Benigno (Javier Camara) and stalwart but emotional sensitive Marco (Dario Grandinetti) as they attend their respective women in permanent sleep at the hospital. A chance encounter at the theatre leads to a later encounter where a seemingly casual friendship grows into a desperate bond. Solitude is the predominant theme of this lively, entertaining and provoking film. There are countless moments for the protagonists to contemplate their life and loves alone. Despite its serious subject matter, Almodovar's masterful handling creates an entertaining story filled with wit and humor. The characters possess compelling quirks and are wonderfully realised in a stunning cast. Amazing performances are given from peripheral characters such as the ballerina instructor, Katerina (Geraldine Chaplin) and the caretaker (Chus Lampreave). Meticulous Almodovar fans will enjoy spotting cameo appearances by past stars from his films. This is an intricate and ceaselessly compelling film that should attract a wide mature audience.
The film begins and ends in the theatre. The performances there suitably reflect the dilemmas evoked in the film and the relationships of the men with their women. The fascinating thing about this film is the way that a story between the men is handled on the surface whilst a subconsciouss story is told by the women in their comas. Gradually, through the use of flashbacks, their story emerges and we are led to image what is happening in their heads while in the hospital. It is interesting to note that the silent film sequence was originally written by Almodovar to be made into a full-length silent film. What we are given is a delightful though shocking glimpse of what that would have been. It is touching to see Almodovar's small nod of tribute to Michael Cunningham's The Hours which is a novel he states he really enjoyed. The film characteristically stretches our ideas of high drama and the far-reaching regions of sexuality. This is a beautiful film to follow from Almodovar's internationally successful All About My Mother (Todo Sobre Mi Madre).",1030492800,81,2581,5.266990291262136

1499174,5,B00005JLQW,"Pedro Almodvars 14th feature Talk to Her (Hable con ella, 2002) is very special. For me it is one of a handful of incontestably great films made this side of the Millenium. My first Almodvar, I saw it some 10 years ago and seeing every one since then from Pepi, Luci, Bom (1980) right through to Im So Excited! (2013) has simply confirmed my initial awe-struck reaction. The basic thematics of Almodvars worldview have been spelled out with admirable and thoroughly consistent artistic integrity over 19 films in almost 4 decades. A few words need to be said about this worldview before I get to the film.

Almodvar is deeply connected with post-Franco Spanish society and the way a country and its people adapted (and are still adapting) from fascism to democracy. Franco died in 1975 and the first General Election was held in 1977. Technically Spain democratized overnight, but in reality the transition was long and torturous, the tension between right and left which led to the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) extending through to this very day. Almodvar has always been on the left wing of the political spectrum and his feature films made in the wake of the collapse of a dictatorship can be read as both an attack and a celebration. The attack is on Francoism, a male chauvinist patriarchy perpetuated by the state-sponsored Catholic Church, brutally upheld by the justice system and by twisted authority figures. The celebration is of freedoms won with the advent of democracy including freedom of speech, freedom of movement, rights for women and sexual liberation. Sometimes the politics are stated explicitly. At the end of Live Flesh (1997) Victor exclaims, The Spanish have lost their fear and the general thrust of any given Almodvar film is the birth of freedom and love out of restriction and hate, the surge from darkness to light (from fascism to democracy) lying in the background even of the films in which politics and history appear to be absent.

The two main themes running through this attack and celebration are transition and identity. Everything in Almodvar is fluid and in a state of flux with a country and its people forever changing and searching for some kind of identity to move forward and achieve stability/security. This transition and identity is addressed in three key areas; in the area of politics and society (what does being Spanish mean?); in the area of the body and sexuality (as a repressed homosexual growing up under Franco we can understand how important sexual emancipation was both for Almodvar and also a great many other people irrespective of their sexual orientation); and in the artistic creative process itself (writing as well as filmmaking as expressed by a fascination with story-telling, cinema history and a very knowing postmodernism). The films variously focus on any one of these areas without ever losing sight of the other two. All About My Mother (made in 1999 and the film immediately preceding Talk to Her) miraculously manages to balance all three in almost equal proportion, but with a subtle emphasis given to matters bodily. In that film the character Agrado utters a statement from the very heart of Almodvars worldview. Justifying her trans-sexuality (the embodiment of transience) she says: You are more authentic the more you resemble what youve dreamed you are. The resounding applause accorded her by the audience and by Almodvar himself of course tells us that this director asserts the right of everyone to be able to be who they want to be in an emancipated state in a world without a closet.

In Talk to Her Almodvar shifts the emphasis almost completely onto transition and identity search within the body with all four central characters existing in closets of isolation/loneliness either of their own making or imposed by external circumstances. The character of the dance teacher Katerina (Geraldine Chaplin) states the landscape of this film most clearly when she describes a projected ballet she is planning to stage entitled Trenches concerning the bodies of dead soldiers from which souls emerge as ballerinas: From the body emerges the soul, from death emerges life, from the male emerges the female, from the earth emerges the ethereal, the impalpable, the ghostly. This concern with body makes the film by far the deepest this director has made with metaphysical meditation on matters of life and death, love and loss, being with people and being alone, being and non-being, all replacing his trademark hyper-active, sexed-up, gender-bending melodramatics. Almodvar has never been entirely without weight of course and I don't want to downplay the success of his other masterpieces (which I take to be The Law of Desire [1987], Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown [1988], Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! [1989], Live Flesh [1997] and Volver [2006]), but there is a deeply impressive intellectual rigor here along with a heaviness (especially in the final third) which is intensely moving and all the more effective for being rendered with such clarity. What follows contains spoilers.

The secret to the success of this film lies in its very tight binary narrative structure which informs how the characters develop throughout. Everything falls into either matching or opposing pairs which conveys the impression that nothing is finite, that characters and events are profoundly affected by and connected with each other on a subliminal level. The film is book-ended by two Pina Bausch ballets which act as metaphors for the main story, the first of which (Caf Mller [1978]) introduces our two couples and the second (Masurca fogo [1998]) celebrates the start of a new pairing, two of our characters having died in the course of events. In Caf Mller two ballerinas dance out their psychosis across a caf to Henry Purcells Plaint from The Fairy Queen (O, let me forever weep) while a man clears tables and chairs out of their path. In the audience two men sit next to each other. Strangers, they are a nurse Benigno (Javier Cmara) who is bored, and a journalist Marco (Daro Grandinetti) who is crying. The ballet pre-figures the scenario of the whole film which is concerned with two comatose women whose massive obstacles (the tables and chairs) the two men try to remove. The men are introduced as binary opposites. We see one man talks a lot, but does not move. He stays in the same place. The other man is moving a lot, but does not talk (Almodvar). Benigno is a 24 year old virgin who has spent his life at a womans bedside, first his mother who he nursed for 20 years and now his patient Alicia (Leonor Watling), a young ballerina put into a coma by a car accident and under his care in hospital. Marco is a travel writer who has spent his whole life on the move, a point emphasized by his introduction on a Body Trek exercising machine, his sweat linking on from the tears cried at the ballet. He likes really desperate women in trouble (Almodvar) and the film shows his relationship with two women; his ex-girlfriend ngela (Elena Anaya) who we see in flashback as the factor that has kept him on the move (she was a heroin addict who couldn't stay in Madrid); and the bullfighter Lydia (Rosario Flores) whose loneliness he emphasizes with when he sees her attacked by an evil talk show TV presenter (Loles Len). Their romance is cut short when Lydia is gored and put into a coma. She is admitted to the same hospital as Alicia and it is there that the long central part of the film takes place as Marco meets Benigno and the pair embark on a friendship.

In the hospital time moves backwards and forwards with flashbacks within flashbacks which are hard to summarize, but its clear there are two comatose victims, two men who want to help and two stories which are titled on the screen, Lydia and Marco and Alicia and Benigno. These parallel each other especially in two more metaphors which convey the emotional state of the two men and their conditions of loneliness. Marco is still pining for ngela and his sadness is visualized through a song (Caetano Veloso at a house party singing Cucurrucuc Paloma, a song about grief for a love lost) as he explains his love sickness to Lydia. Benignos mental state is expressed through a startling 7 minute silent film entitled Shrinking Lover which I will come to later. Needless to say, that too is constructed in binary terms. Both men leave the hospital at the same point in the film, Marco released from his bond to Lydia by the realization that Lydia had assumed a relationship with her ex-lover one month before she was gored and Benigno released from the hospital because it has been found that he has raped Alicia leaving her pregnant in the process. Both men are left alone, Marco resumes his lonely travels (to Jordan) while Benigno resumes his static existence, this time in a prison cell. The equilibrium is broken by Marco finding out about Lydias subsequent death which prompts a return to balance as he returns to Madrid to help his friend in prison. From this point the film stops jumping around and assumes absolute linearity until the end. Therein lies the weight of the film as we explore the friendship of two men and their concern for Alicia. In another binary opposite just as Lydia dies so Alicia wakes up. She comes to during childbirth, a fact that Marco has to conceal from Benigno. But three people awake upsets the balance again and Benigno commits suicide thinking he is reuniting himself with Alicia in the world of the ethereal. Actually, his spirit has passed over to Marco (shown to stunning effect in the interview scene in prison) as Marco takes over his life, moving into his apartment, falling in love with Alicia and eventually uniting with her at the end in the theater watching Masurca fogo with the title Mario and Alicia shown on the screen. The ballet closes off the films wonderful symmetries as two dancers, a man and a woman face up to each other and a prospective end to their loneliness.

The binary nature of the narrative and the feeling that everything is inter-connected with the actions of one character affecting those of another in the impulse towards some kind of ethereal equilibrium wherein everyone can feel secure is the perfect way to state flux and within that a declaration of sadness, of melancholy (Almodvar) in the human condition because this security stays forever tantalizingly out of reach for all of us. It is remarkable how all the characters, not just the four principles are defined in terms of transient loneliness. The nurses around Benigno all have their problems  Matilde (Lola Dueas) is a single mother whose husband has just walked out on her while Rosa (Mariola Fuentes) quietly burns a torch for Benigno. Alicias father (Helio Pedregal) is a psychiatrist widower, the concierge of Benignos apartment building (Chus Lampreave) is sad the media didn't come around after Benignos arrest to liven up her life, and even the films only bad character, the talk show presenter is left alone on the set, Lydia having (quite rightly) walked off.

Almodvar very carefully delineates the nature of the loneliness affecting each of the main characters which reveals even more binary combinations. Lydias loneliness is the loneliness of a female bullfighter alone in a male chauvinist world who has to constantly prove herself by taking increasing risks (tackling 6 bulls at once) while the gossips pounce on her sleeping with fellow matador Nio de Valencia (Adolfo Fernndez). She is presented as her fathers son in the way she attempts to succeed in a world where her father had failed (he had only been a banderillero, not a matador). Conversely Benigno is presented as his mothers daughter as Javier Cmaras remarkable performance draws out so exquisitely. He has spent his life beside the bed of a woman and has been denied the usual psycho-sexual development of a man. He has been feminized just as Lydia has been masculinized. Marco also has his share of gender confusion. He is attracted to women in trouble (close to death) because he wants to protect them, to mother them. It is Marco who cries constantly, in the theater, when he kills the snake in Lydias house, at the house party. It is Marco who is the woman in the relationship with Lydia conveyed in long car rides where it is he who does all the talking, not Lydia. Lydia is the quiet masculine non-talker who is defined most of all in the corrida where she is the picture of loneliness as she tames a bull to a sad melody on the soundtrack. The dying bull circling in slow motion, spiked with spears and dripping with blood is the very picture of loneliness which Marco is attracted to, the bull (a male cow) of course symbolizing Lydia. It could also symbolize Marco himself, his attraction to women who suffer writing large his own suffering. For Almodvar gender and sexuality are always fluid with no cast iron definition possible over something which is so transient.

The main catalyst for transition and identity search is Benigno who proves to be the independent variable in the experiment. Marco, Lydia and Alicia all have normal lives which have been knocked out of kilter by external events. Lydias vocation may be unusual, but she is a woman doing what she has to do to live in a mans world, having affairs and pursuing a career. Alicia is a young girl, a future ballerina enjoying the prime of her youth. Both are knocked into comas, into assuming different identities. In binary terms Lydias loneliness is defined before her accident while Alicias is defined after she wakes up to find herself a different person in a different world. Marcos loneliness is also nothing unusual. He has had his share of sexual relationships and is also pursuing a successful career. Lydia is beyond help and eventually dies (like the old Francoism which bullfighting symbolizes?), but Benigno profoundly affects both Marco and Alicia simply because he does not belong to the average world. He lives in a parallel world which has its own rules which makes him an innocent in the real world. His warmth and love is what finally makes Marco able to talk to her (to Alicia). Marco had been unable to talk to Lydia after she had fallen into a coma, thinking that state to be death rather than life. Benigno feels the opposite way, that coma is life albeit a changed one and that victims deserve the love and affection they would receive as if they are walking around and talking. Marco at first thinks (as most of us surely do) its crazy to conduct monolog conversations with a coma victim, but when he leaves the hospital he sits next to Alicia and says, Hello Alicia, Im alone again Benignos craziness has worked on Marco transforming him into a man who also falls in love with a coma victim. Indeed after Marco returns from Jordan he in a sense becomes Benigno by taking over his life (his apartment) and his love (Alicia). This is shown quite wonderfully in the prison interview where the pair are sitting opposite each other and Almodvar has his camera on a track. Both are sealed in their own little cubicle worlds looking at each other. As the camera shifts to focus 90 degrees on one the reflection of the others head falls over the head of the others, first Marcos over Benignos and then (after the camera slides left) Benignos over Marcos. Its as if they are sharing each others feelings, bonding as one person, but its also as if they are exchanging identities. Marco is shifting his terminal loneliness over onto the doomed Benigno while Benigno is shifting his kindness and caring over onto Marco. Marcos assumption of Benignos life and eventual romantic pairing with Alicia is then Benignos as well, for his spirit, his very essence now resides inside Marcos body.

Benignos loneliness is touchingly conveyed. Put simply, the man cares but has nobody to care for him. He has devoted his whole life to bedside care and what we see of his life in this film away from the bedside shows him to be unselfishly living the life of the person he is caring for. We see him bored at the opening ballet and we see him disturbed by the silent film he sees. He experiences both because he is living out Alicias life as she would want to live it, and he simply wants to recount the experiences to her at her bedside. We see him in his apartment trying to arrange it how Alicia would like it and he discusses interior designs with her with the idea they are going to live there together and he even tells Marco he wants to marry her. His life is completely sacrificed to Alicia and his loneliness (because she cant respond) is underlined again and again both in the script (Ive hugged very few people in my life) and in the mise-en-scene (his apartment is the saddest of a series of borderline locations which dominate this film). Marco says the special shoes Alicia wears on bed look like Ibizan shoes to which Benigno reveals he has never been to Ibiza. In fact he has never been anywhere and the only way he can travel is in the mind as he reads Marcos travel guides in prison. He empathizes profoundly with a Cuban woman seeing how time passes and nothing happens. I thought it was me, and when we hear in voice-over about his one and only trip (his suicide) the camera focuses on a photo of the guidebook cover with the woman leaning out of the window.

Benignos purity in his own world which translates as craziness in the real world is placed center of attention by Almodvar who here does something he also did in Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! He takes a social taboo (in the earlier film sexual abduction, in this film rape) and pushes it as far as it is permissible to go to state the case that human sexual desire is rooted in nature before society and religion comes along to impose rules which repress it, a repression which (Almodvar thinks) ultimately can be more damaging than the original desire itself. Benigno is possibly the purest, the most beautiful character in any Almodvar film and his actions are shown to be those of a kind, warm-hearted, loving man. His rape is a crime which is duly punished, but what crime is it when the outcome is so overwhelmingly positive? In effect he wakes Alicia up and gives her a new shot at life along with Marco.

As well as underlining the positive effect of Benignos action Almodvar contextualizes and puts his crime down to acute sexual repression. First, he visits Alicias home and is interviewed by her psychoanalyst father. The doctor asks him what the problem is and Benigno answers loneliness. It is here we find out about his peculiar life, that he is a virgin and that he took care of his mother for 20 years who was lazy rather than sick. She could have got out of bed if she had wanted to but chose not to, using and in effect abusing her son in the process. This smothering mother relationship is accompanied by a suggested antipathy for his father who walked out on them both. It doesnt need a psychoanalyst to diagnose an Oedipus complex here and it becomes clear as the film develops that Benignos psycho-sexual development has been arrested at the mother love stage and has not been allowed to develop beyond that. Also bed-ridden, Alicia is an obvious mother surrogate, a point underlined strongly in the silent film he sees and later relates to her.

In interview Almodvar has pointed out that on the surface the silent film (shot in b/w German expressionist style and set in 1924, the year of Langs Die Nibelungen and Murnaus The Last Laugh) serves two purposes. First, it hides what is going on in the hospital. Almodvar loves his character as a friend and just as we don't always want to see everything our friends do, so he cant show Benigno raping Alicia. If he did show it our sympathy for the character would be lost. Second, the silent film on one level actually inspires Benigno to rape Alicia  The film makes him recognize his desire and makes it real for him (Almodvar). Almodvar sees him as an innocent living an alternative reality with no sexual orientation at all. Watching the erotic film connects him with his libido and disturbs him deeply (he says so). It inspires him to commit an act which in the real world is a crime, but in his alternative reality is an act of love.

Under the surface though, the film is deeply symbolic and explains Benignos Oedipus complex-related sexual repression through a binary double metaphor. First, note the title Shrinking Man. The film is about the loss of potency, aka castration anxiety. The film shows a young couple, Amparo (Paz Vega) and Alfredo (Fele Martnez). Amparo is a scientist perfecting a new diet drug while her rich but idle (ie; impotent) boyfriend (Alfredo representing Benigno) looks on. He feels his manhood threatened by his brilliant partner and drinks the potion to prove his potency. But the drug causes him to shrink and as he does so there is a barely-perceptible dissolve as Amparo turns momentarily into his mother (Sonia Grande). The tiny Alfredo/Benigno returns to the mother-fold, but the mother is a monster and he hides out in his toy train set. He regresses back to his childhood, or interpreted another way the potion has revealed the real child within Alfredo/Benigno. Eventually Amparo rescues him, putting him into her handbag (an obvious vaginal symbol which pre-figures the real vagina he soon encounters). We notice the mother and Amparo resemble each other. The couple check into room 15 of the Hotel Youkali, so named after a Kurt Weill tango whose words reveal the loneliness of poor Alfredo/Benigno, Youkali being a refuge from the real world:

Youkali, it is the land of our desires, / Youkali it is happiness.
It is pleasure  / But it is a dream, a folly.
There is no Youkali. / And life goes on, weariness everyday
But the poor human soul / looks everywhere to forget it.
To leave the earth, / To find the mystery.
We dream on earth / To live on some Youkali.

In the room Amparo lays little Alfredo/Benigno on the bed before going to sleep. The little man pulls back the bed cover to reveal Amparos (to him) huge naked body which he takes delight in exploring. After climbing the mountains of her breasts he plunges south into the enchanted forest of her pubic hair. The camera is now square between Amparos legs looking at an enormous vagina which Alfredo plays with much to his ladys delight. The film finishes with Alfredo/Benigno diving into the inviting orifice to Benignos words as he relates the story, And little Alfredo stays inside her forever. We then see in color what looks like sperm connecting (or perhaps disconnecting) with an egg. Obviously the film which Benigno has seen and which we see as he relates it to Alicia is a double metaphor both for Benigno raping Alicia and for Benigno returning to his mothers womb. He is disenchanted with the cold reality of life, seeks escape in Alicia, but because his psycho-sexual development has been arrested at mother love, his Youkali, the land of [his] desires, is ultimately his mother. His loneliness is so acute that his subconscious desire is to return to his mothers womb, or to wish never to have been born, hence staying inside her forever.

The location for a statement on transition and identity happening within the human body gets perfect visualization in room 15 of Hotel Youkali. The human body becomes a transient location to equal all the other borderline locations that appear throughout the film. The film plays out in locations connected with transition, especially the transit from life to death  inside cars (Alicias coma is car crash-induced), the corrida, the prison, the graveyard, and especially the hospital where coma is the exact definition of being in transit. Other borderline locations are hotels  Lydias and Amparo/Alfredos hotels are both refuges from the hostile world; the theater and the dance studio  places where reality is transposed into an imitation of reality in poetic terms; and the homes of the characters which none of them properly inhabit. Lydia cant bear to stay in her house and asks to be taken to a hotel. Marco is always traveling and his apartment his defined by a huge world map on the wall suggesting perpetual travel. Benignos home is beside Alicias bed, not his apartment which resembles a home under construction. Alicias home is a psychiatrists waiting room where people come to find out where their lives are taking them. The only location in the whole film to have any warmth or sense of permanence is Alicias room with its carefully-arranged lights, pictures and ornaments. As Benigno looks at it we understand this is the Youkali for which he longs, but of course Alicia is put into a coma before he can get a chance. The sense of permanent danger is also hinted at by the book Alicia had been reading laying beside her bed  David Grubbs The Night of the Hunter, a classic story of childhood innocence threatened. The ultimate borderline location is the body itself - the bull fighter, the car crash victim, the sad lonely lover defining his life by protecting his lover, and the lonely man about to commit suicide because he can't take it any longer.

A profound meditation on transition and change mainly in the human body (politics are hinted at through the Francoist past bearing down on the next generation through Lydias efforts to be her father through bullfighting and Benignos domineering mother who we hear but never see; while cinematic post-modernism is addressed through the inter-textual pastiche of the Baush ballets and the silent film), do not think for a moment this is a gloomy art film. The first half is surprising light and funny and 'Shrinking Lover' is a superb mixture of comedy and surreal fantasy which is better than anything Fellini ever came up with. Thanks to a roster of superb performances, all the characters emerge as fully-rounded and warmly sympathetic with Javier Cmara giving an awe-inspiring performance at the very heart of Almodvars extraordinary film managing the transition in his character from light, amiable and amusing life to dark impending 'death' with consummate mastery. Javier Aguirresarobes bright and extremely beautiful cinematography and a wonderfully sensitive musical score (especially the amazing string quartet score for Shrinking Lover) by Alberto Iglesias also help Almodvar achieve a film which is to my way of thinking as near to perfection as it is possible to get. Strongly recommended.",1455408000,,26415,4.794072447859495

The compositions are so well designed, making for an intensely pleasurable visual experience, texturally rich.  This is a visual masterpiece.  In addition, the inclusion of one of film making's most ""memorable"" scenes (you decide which one that is) makes it a film to remember for life.  Be sure to watch for the use of orange/pink/maroon throughout the picture!  The sound track is amazing integrated with the imagery, making a most cohesive film experience, with the camera moving in and out, and around, as music changes and shifts appropriately, yet never in any staid kitchy manner.  The film draws you in throughout!

Conceptually --- The script behind this film comes with a gripping plot, though very disturbing to many.

1499424,5,B00005JLQW,"Other viewers have given excellent synopses of the overall plot and characters, so I won't attempt to repeat.

Upon reading the gist of the story, I wasn't sure whether I would like this film, because the women protagonists are all comatose. Indeed, as I watched, I found this theme echoed in the cinema-within-cinema as well, in which many of the women are also asleep or in swoons. The pervasiveness of the unconscious woman image is intentional, and weaves in with the movie as a whole to make a multi-level commentary on the relationships between the sexes.

On the level of plot and character, the story seems to me to be mostly about many different kinds of love and acceptance between people. It challenges the usual judgments that we may make about people and their feelings, actions, and relationships. I found the ending unexpectedly affirming, though some may disagree.

I whole-heartedly rate this film five stars - for a unique story line, for fine performances by all the cast, for extremely creative use of cinema within cinema, for the visuals (especially the scenery and the corrida) and for a well-chosen score.

A footnote about the rating: it is rated R for some nudity and sexual themes, including a scene in the film within a film that was intentionally done with props that are clearly not actual human body. The scene of the goring of the torera was handled with restraint, and did not shock me.",1392163200,,1419,4.80327868852459

1499583,5,B00005JLQW,"Silent agony, fiercely secretive intimacy, the hush of two women's feminine souls trapped within their dormant bodies - all remind one of our own blessings after viewing ""Hable con ella"" (Translated in English as 'Talk to Her'). Soft murmurs cannot echo without kindness shown, attentiveness by two men (Benigno and Marco). Beningo is the personal nurse for Alicia (comatose) while Marco conducts his own masculine vigil over comatose Lydia (a famous matadoress gored in the bull ring, now dormant in her hospital bed). Fierce too is the graphic eroticism presented in this Spanish language drama by our screenwriter & director (Pedro Almodvar, 2002 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay; 2003 Golden Glove Award for Best Foreign-Language Film; cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe; music by Alberto Iglesias). The plot is intensely played out within a powerful, intricately romantic storyline. Rose bouquets should be given out to Leonor Watlin (as Alicia) and Rosario Flores (as Lydia Gonzlez) for their complex performances. Superb work was done by Javier Cmara (as Benigno) and Dario Grandinetti (as Marco).

Yes, extreme intimacy surrounds all romantic discourse. And yes, richly-textured dialogue elevates the film. We achieve catharsis early on; our emotions are wrung out by Act II; we grasp unto eroticism as if it were our lifeboat. Perhaps it is. Who am I to say? The flashbacks convey to us like revolving mirrors flashing back in time - the unique history of each woman. We know these women as if they were our sisters. Lydia is so badly gored that she dies in her coma. Alicia becomes pregnant while comatose and has a stillborn baby; Beningo is charged with rape, sent to prison, and later commits suicide - unable to cope with his guilt. Superior tragedy merits high marks. The denouement is complete in all respect. Passion is not sacrificed. The complex theme of forced love (rape) by Beningo upon Sylvia is handled directly by Almodvar without pretense. It happened; there are severe tragic consequences to the act. However, there is hope Sylvia once she recovers. Marco protects that hope by not telling Benigno about her recovery prior to his suicide. Dramatic irony implodes in front of our very eyes. Act III secretly plays out her denouement, followed by a descrescendo, then by the subtle irony that it is now Marcol watching over Alicia at her dance concert.

Applause must go to the director, cast, and film crew for assembling a superior work of art - that suggests to one and all that lovely, delicate themes are to be held dear - even to those who remain comatose. Love spreads her silken wings wherever and whenever - she so desires. Compassion resonates herein. The dove flutters just above the storyline to ensure - as in the superb romantic film Amelie (in French, 2001)  - that heroines do possess noblequalities, even when struck down, that reveal much about their feminine souls. Pure romance even in a clinical setting, even while the dreams of a patient may be enhanced by contact with a kind soul - becomes our connection to this beautiful story; we invest emotions, and the film rewards us. Romance like a dove in flight has left her pallor on us by displaying Alica in her ballerina pose. All classical unities were adhered to.",1331683200,,3276,4.996336996336996
1499584,5,B00005JLQW,"La angustia silenciosa, la intimidad violentamente reservada, la quietud de dos almas femeninas de mujeres atrapadas dentro de sus cuerpos inactivos - todo recuerda uno de nuestras propias bendiciones despus de ver ""ella de timo de Hable"". Los murmullos suaves no pueden resonar sin la bondad mostrado, la atencin por dos hombres (Benigno y Marco). Beningo es la enfermera personal para Alicia (comatoso) mientras Marco realiza su propia vigilia masculina sobre Lydia comatoso (un famoso matadoress corne en el anillo de toro, ahora inactivo en su cama del hospital). Violento tambin es el erotismo grfico presentado en este drama espaol del idioma por nuestro guionista & director (Pedro Almodvar, 2002 Oscar para el Guin Mejor Original; 2003 Premio Dorado de Guante para Mejor Pelcula del Extranjero-Idioma; la cinematografa por Javier Aguirresarobe; msica por Alberto Iglesias). El complot es jugado intensamente fuera dentro de un argumento complejamente romntico poderoso. Los ramilletes rosas deben ser repartidos a Leonor Watlin (como Alicia) y Rosario Flores (como Lydia Gonzlez) para sus desempeos complejos. Magnfico trabajo fue hecho por Javier Cmara (como Benigno) y Dario Grandinetti (como Marco).

S, la intimidad extrema rodea todo el discurso romntico. Y s, dilogo generosamente-con textura eleva la pelcula. Logramos la catarsis temprano en; nuestras emociones son retorcidas fuera por II de Acto; agarramos a erotismo como si fuera nuestro bote salvavidas. Quizs es. Quin es decir? Las escenas retrospectivas transmiten a nosotros como los espejos giratorios que destellan atrs en tiempo - la historia extraordinaria de cada mujer. Conocemos a estas mujeres como si fueran nuestras hermanas. Lydia tan es corneado mal que se muere en su coma. Alicia llega a ser embarazada mientras comatoso y da la luz a un beb mortinato; Beningo es acusado de violacin, enviado a la prisin, y posterior se suicida - incapaz de enfrentarse con su culpa. La tragedia superior merece marcas altas. El desenlace es completo en todo el respeto. La pasin no es sacrificada. El tema complejo del amor forzado (violacin) por Beningo sobre Sylvia es manejado directamente por Almodvar sin pretensin. Sucedi; hay consecuencias trgicas severas al acto. Sin embargo, hay esperanza Sylvia una vez que ella recupera. Marco protege esa esperanza por no decir Benigno acerca de su recuperacin antes de su suicidio. La irona dramtica implota adelante de nuestros muy ojos. Acte III en secreto juegos fuera su desenlace, seguido por un descrescendo, entonces por la irona sutil que es ahora Marcol que mira sobre Alicia en su concierto de baile.

El aplauso debe ir al director, al molde, y al equipo cinematogrfico para reunir una obra de arte superior - que sugiere a todos que temas lindos y delicados son de ser tenido estimado - an a los que se quedan comatoso. El amor esparce las alas sedosas dondequiera y siempre que - ella tan desee. La compasin resuena en esto. La paloma revolotea justo encima del argumento para asegurar - como en la magnfica pelcula romntica Amelie (en francs, 2001) - que heronas poseen noblequalities, an cuando fulmin, que revela mucho acerca de sus almas femeninas. Puro romance an en una colocacin clnica, an mientras los sueos de un paciente pueden ser aumentados por contacto con un alma amable - llega a ser nuestra conexin a esta hermosa historia; invertimos emociones, y la pelcula nos recompensa.

Having watched it at the cinema and three or four times since, Talk to Her is one of my most memorable love films and has a tone that I can only describe as ""sweet"". As well it is suffused with love for one's fellow humans in all their variability, quirkiness and idiosyncratic ways and even the most mundane characters - receptionist at the new gaol where the occupants are termed ""interns"" - have a decency and humane humanness about them. With female matadors and emotional men who are quick to tear up at the slightest excuse, whether moved by art or some sympathy for others, this is a rich filmic experience - colour, music, dance, humour, death,honour, - brilliantly out together.

1499660,5,B00005JLQW,"I saw that ""Talk to Her"" was a foreign language Academy Award winner and that got my interest.  I was surprised to discover that it was not even nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar.  It was nominated for Best Director and won Best Original Screenplay.  I didn't know much about the film before I rented it.  I knew it had something to do with someone's relationship with a bull-fighter and that was about it.  I say this because I really didn't know what I was getting into and, by the end of the movie, I was pretty numb.  This film had an impact on me and I wasn't sure that I liked that fact.  If you've read other reviews you probably know why there is such a strong feeling pro or con on this movie.  After some degree of soul searching I acknowledged that the director, Pedro Almodovar, did a brilliant job.  I also acknowledged that the sequence of events were impressive but still fictionally created to achieve some sort of a purpose.  I finally came to the conclusion that, if anyone wanted to make a movie with this theme then nobody could have done a better job than the outstanding product delivered by Almodover.

On the positive side, the acting is very good to excellent.  The medical aspects seemed to have been fairly well researched.  I liked the meaning of the title of the movie.  There was always something happening or just about to happen to keep our interest as well as our curiosity focussed.  There are the subtle aspects of dialogue and scenes which come back to us with the realization that everything was put together so completely.  Of all of those subtleties, I liked the chapter titles that seemed so innocuous until we get to the very end and see the final chapter title.  In that chapter title, Pedro Almodovar come up with a conclusion of our ownwhich enabled the movie to continue in our minds.  The director also covered himself well in this journey into extreme immorality by getting us all comfortable with the morality of our key players.  When the first real clue of abomination unfolded most of us, I guess, were going to stay with the movie because we were invested in these people.  The outcome is the hard part to deal with but, again, Almodovar covers his steps very well and guides us to a choice of negative/negative or negative/positive.  (I suppose some might think positive/positive but I don't think that way).  I was emotionally drained and then I saw the last chapter title.

This is not a film that I could recommend to anyone I know.  Frankly, I'd be worried about what they would think of me.  I'll just leave with a comparison with ""Murmers of the Heart"".  ""Murmers"" shocked me in a bad way.  The scene I saw take place in present time let me ponder how disasterous this young boy's life would become in the future.  In ""Talk to Her"" I was shocked but I saw a better tomorrow.  I'm just not sure whether to thank Almodovar or blame him.",1280620800,4,2905,4.522072936660269
1499661,5,B00005JLQW,"My second favorite Almodovar film, after 'All About My Mother'. A moving and complex study of the relationship between two men, and their connection to women in comas.  A few brilliantly funny moments, and some ultimately very creepy undertones keep it from being over-sentimental.  Every character is more complex then they first appear, and the confusion between what is good and what is bad in both intent and effect is very rich.  Some great camera work too.  Gets slow in a few spots, and the sentiment still goes over the top in a few places, but still a terrific film about the similarities and differences between love and obsession.",1280275200,3,641,4.853211009174312

The universal themes explored here seem to layer themselves over time, building upon their foundation an even stronger and deeper exploration of all I thought it had to say.

This film keeps giving.

`Hable con Ella' revolves around two men as they bond over similar situations.  Both Benigno and Marco are in love with women in comas.  Marco's girlfriend, bullfighter Lydia Gonzalez, is thrown into a coma after she is gored by a bull.  Alicia, a beautiful dancer, has been lying in a coma for four years thanks to a car accident.  Benigno is the nurse who has been taking care of her.  While they were never `together', Benigno has fallen in love with her over the years and has come to consider her his soul mate.  He lives and breathes to be near her and talk to her.  Both men have separate yet related struggles.  Marco is struggling with his relationship with Lydia, wondering what he really meant to her.  Benigno struggles with a reality he isn't willing to face.

At the core of `Hable con Ella' is a story about the need to be a part of someone, of something greater than ourselves in order to feel whole.  As these two men bond over their situations they become intertwined in ways neither could have imagined.

What I appreciate about this film is that it understands how to introduce shocking extremes without taking one out of the film.  I read a complaint the other day by a so called Oscar blogger who mentioned that this film was one of the worst films of the decade.  His complaint was this:

""I really don't understand why people like this film. The main character does something TERRIBLE, and we're supposed to feel SORRY for him? I certainly didn't. I think he got what was coming to him. I don't mind the gross sexual stuff that Pedro Almodovar does. I just mind it when he asks me to root for a complete pervert. I just don't understand this film's screenplay win.""

This is totally narrow minded and completely misses the entire point of this film.  What Pedro does here is far from ask us to invest in a pervert, but he asks us to understand the mind of the lonely and come to terms with someone's understanding of love and expression.  We don't have to agree with the actions (and hopefully we don't) but like any good, constructive and provocative film, `Hable con Ella' understands the importance in understanding.  When one watches a film like `Dead Man Walking', do we not sympathize and or come to feel heartbreak for Sean Penn, despite his despicable actions?  This is a film about humanity and the imperfections that make us human.  Benigno is suffering, and while he makes some disturbing decisions, one must bare in mind that he is, in fact, suffering.

The relationship that forms between Benigno and Marco is one that speaks volumes to me, for it is one that is ambiguously profound.  While Almodovar leaves a lot of questions open, he understands that that is part of the journey for the audience.  We are left pondering the meaning of their bond and just what one meant to the other.  Marco's reaction to Benigno's actions is a serious point for reflection.

But am I giving too much away?

I urge you to sit down and really delve into this stunning film.  Pedro Almodovar really understands not only his characters but also his audience.  He knows how to paint a picture so vivid and so real that we are bound to relate, if we are willing to be that open and honest with ourselves.",1274745600,7,3676,4.578866768759571

Talk to Her is without a doubt a well-made motion picture, but it's a difficult film to approach and I felt while watching it that I was appreciating its merits without being truly involved with the storyline; I recommend it to people who typically enjoy what are considered ""art films"" but if that moniker scares you off then seek out another film.",1245369600,3,367,4.6461538461538465
1499665,5,B00005JLQW,"Pedro Almodovar's 2002 film HABLE CON ELLA is one of the film-maker's most elegant achievements. Benigno (Javier Camara) is a nurse in a Madrid hospital taking care of Alicia (Leonor Watling), a young ballerina who has lived in a coma for the last four years. Marco (Dario Grandinetti) is an Argentinian journalist who watches in horror as his torero girlfriend Lydia (Rosario Flores) falls into a coma after a bullfighting tragedy. The two men form an odd friendship, with Benigno's unwavering love for his ward contrasted with Marco's emotional turmoil. HABLE CON ELLA was the film sensation of the year that I moved to Spain, and I watched it many times then and later. After a recent viewing, I decided that I can fairly declare it to be a masterpiece.

HABLE CON ELLA succeeds on several different fronts, from strong acting by this international cast to the bold use of colors and the cinematography. But for me the most memorable are the two psychological tricks Almodovar works in the plot. He inspires such sympathy in the viewer for Benigno, a character who upon rational reflection is arguably monstrous. Then, at the close of the film, he provides what seems like a heartwarming happy ending even when tragedy has unfolded for much of the film. On my recent viewing, I was especially touched by Marco's insightful musings on love in the last flashback scene.

Almodovar's movies are often full of odd sexual twists, a fact with which this reviewer is well acquainted and quite used to. For viewers unused to the Spanish auteur, things may initially seem bizarre, but I would call on everyone who likes art cinema to give HABLE CON ELLA a chance.",1239580800,6,1657,4.830985915492958

In ""Talk to Her"" the two main protagonists are men, unusually for Almodvar, whose films have been notable for a succession of powerful and striking female roles... Benigno is a male nurse who is employed to care for a dancer (Alicia) in a coma after a car accident... At the private clinic he meets Marco, a journalist who is in love with Lydia, a female bullfighter also in a coma after being gored by a bull... They become friends and Benigno persuades Marco that he must talk to Lydia, even if she cannot hear (therefore the title). But then we lean that the likable and amiable Benigno has raped Alicia, the woman who is in love with her...

European art cinema has a great tradition but an uncertain future in the world increasingly dominated by Hollywood... Almodvar is an ornament of European culture which proved that the form still has much to say about the human condition and can say it with charm, elegance, and attractiveness...",1229212800,,1287,4.819004524886878

I enjoyed Volver very much; it had a cohesive plot and excellent performances, but also some of the comedy and absurdity of his previous movies.  ""Talk to Her"" was well done, cohesive and excellently acted.  I was particularly taken with the performance, in perfect Spanish, of Geraldine Chaplin. Although I enjoyed the movie and it is worth watching, it was not what I expected from Almodovar because all the characters seem to be damaged and have very sad lives.  Consequently, it was depressing to me.  I would rather be entertained by his films that contain absurd and humorous characters and situations.",1213142400,2,698,4.94017094017094

This drama was unexpected for me:  most of the time, the love objects are in a coma, with more than half of the action taken up in the static atmosphere of a hospital:  one man, unable to form relationships, loves his charge as a nurse to an absurd point; the other spends his time talking to his comatose girlfriend, but befriends the other man and also begins to love his patient.

While the story has psychological depth and a wonderfully consistent mood, I admit that I did not find it very interesting, when compared to his other films.  There is little humor in it, the characters are so strange that I wondered why we should be concerned about them for 2 hours, and the emotions portrayed are extremely rarified to say the least.",1210636800,6,815,4.47972972972973

Marco is a travel writer whose girlfriend Lydia is in a coma. When he asks the doctor whether there is any hope, the doctor responds, ""Medically or scientifically, no, but if you choose to believe, go ahead."" The male nurse Benigno does believe. He truly loves the dancer Alicia, who is a patient of his also in a coma. He talks to her, baths her, cuts her hair, and tenderly cares for her. He tells Marcos that the last four years caring for her have been the richest and most rewarding years of his life. The film would have been good enough with just this trajectory, but director Pedro Almodovar drives three of these four subjects toward entirely unexpected and ambiguous ends that leave you with many more answers than questions.

As always, Almodvar coaxes exemplary performances from his actors, especially Grandinetti--whose teary Marco is movingly guilt-ridden about Lydia's injuries--and Camara, playing a naive man whose obsessive attachment to Alicia takes a black-comic turn. With its striking visual flair and even a mini silent-film fantasy evoking Buster Keaton, ""Talk to Her"" is an audacious love fable with an enormous heart.",1185321600,6,605,5.586956521739131
1499741,5,B00005JLQW,"Pedro Almodovar has again given us a beautifully haunting film, a film that causes us to truly think about our lives and the way we live it.  In `Talk to Her' we have the story of two men brought together by the women they love, both of whom have fallen into a deep coma.  The first man is Benigno Martin (Javier Camara), a male nurse who has fallen in love with young aspiring dancer Alicia (Leonor Watling).  Alicia has been lying in a coma for four years after a tragic car accident and he has been caring for her day and night ever since.  The second man is Marco Zuluaga (the remarkable Dario Grandinetti), a journalist who is brought to the hospital after his girlfriend, bullfighter Lydia Gonzalez (Rosario Flores), is gored by a bull and thrown into a coma as well.

The real story here revolves around these men bonding in the face of their trials.  Marco struggles with loving Lydia, struggles with guilt over her predicament and his battles with whether or not she ever really loved him.  Benigno on the other hand ahs never had Alicia's love for she never truly knew him, but after spending four years at her side he feels as though they are in love and truly meant to be together.  He talks to her constantly, divulging his secrets to her, his passions, and he begins to live her life for her, watching the movies she once loved and seeing as much live dance as he can in order to have more to tell her.

The script is original and captivating and is only heightened by the superb acting and directing of this film.  Benigno's unconventional love of Alicia is a subject that is sure to cause a lot of controversy and talk, but also is Marco's devotion to Benigno in his time of dire straights.  Their relationship is an ambiguous one, one that raises my suspicion, especially in the final frames when Marco sees Alicia.  I'm brought to wonder if he wants to be with her for himself or in an attempt to have yet another part of Benigno.  You watch and you decide.

1499742,5,B00005JLQW,"Talk To Her is a movie about loneliness, the fragile connections between human beings, and the worlds we create within ourselves. Benigno is a lonely man, who had lived in isolation taking care of his mother for most of his life. Through his window he watches Alicia, practicing in a dance studio across the street, and falls deeply in love with her. This window is his only contact with the outside world, and Alicia becomes his entire world. Then Alicia is in a car accident and falls into a coma. Benigno works at a hospital as a nurse since his mother died. He serendipitously is hired to take care of her fulltime, which he does with care and love and joy. He dotes on her, and tells her everything as if she were an imaginary friend. Although she is completely unaware of it, he is now her window to the outside world.

Then Benigno meets Marco. Marco is a journalist who has fallen in love with the bullfighter Lydia, who has just been admitted to the coma ward after being gruesomely gored by a bull. Marco visits Lydia daily, while Benigno cares for Alicia down the hall. Benigno reaches out to Marco, which first frightens Marco because of Benigno's awkward lack of inhibition, but then they soon realize they share an intense yet one-sided love. They are both lonely men, who hide away from the world, and while they are limited in their abilities to connect sincerely with healthy human beings, they find themselves easily poring out all the love and locked up emotion inside them into their coma patients. This one-sided love for their coma patients slowly morphs into their own real friendship. Benigno supports Marco when Lydia dies, and Marco becomes the only one who will try to help Benigno when what Benigno believes was an act of love lands him in jail. Alicia finally wakes up, from what can only be described as giving birth to herself.",1165536000,6,1858,4.63030303030303
1499743,4,B00005JLQW,"In the Extras on the DVD, Almodovar narrates the entire film along with Geraldine Chaplin explaining his motivation in doing certain things in the film.  One thing he says is that many people are speechless after viewing the film.  Me too but I'd say the really bad thing about this film is its concept that women are no more than beautiful mindless objects:  sort of like babes in ""The Wedding Crashers."" But beautiful the women are.  The actress who plays the  bullfighter gives an incredible performance before she goes into a coma.  (Are there really female bullfighters?)  And best of all is the song Paloma.  The wedding scene was idiotic and should not have been included because it was unlikely to have happened the way it was filmed.  The photography was very beautiful.  (Do they really have jails like that in Spain?  Maybe Martha Stewart served her time in one like it.)",1161043200,4,882,4.7368421052631575
1499744,4,B00005JLQW,"""Hable con Ella"" is the first Almodovar film I see so I can't quite put this in perspective. What I can say is that this is a powerful drama done in a way that only non-American cinema looks and feels. There's just a ""je ne sais quois"" that sets this kind of cinema apart and Almodovar seems to be a master of this effect.

Perhaps much of the reason behind that is how crudely and in-your-face Almodovar tells us the story he chose to tell us, never shying away from the bare naked truth of what it really means to be in a comatose state. This, in fact, is the story of two women who are in a vegetative state and who both have a man deeply caring for them. Benigno is a male nurse who hardly knew Alicia but who fell in love with her after she had a traffic accident and got under his care. Marco had feelings for Lydia, the most famous female bullfighter in Spain, but after she's gored by a bull, all that's left to him is trying to put the pieces of his life back together while seating at her bedside.

The core of the film turns out to be the developing relationship between Benigno and Marco inside the clinic. This lends itself to thought provoking moral issues that Almodovar has no problem in presenting us in a daring and touching manner. From showing us objectively the effort that's involved in taking daily care of someone who is in a coma, to a brilliantly metaphoric short and sexually explicit - in its own extraordinarily peculiar way - silent movie, ""Hable con Ella"" is never ashamed of itself.

Personally, though, I couldn't really connect with these four people. I felt there was some missing link that kept me from caring as much as I felt the viewer is intended to care. Perhaps this warrants a second viewing some other time, maybe then, with the plot details out of the way, it reveals subtleties on the characters that I couldn't quite grasp upon first viewing.

Marco, a writer, played by Dario Grandinetti and Benigno played by Javier Camara meet in a clinic in which the significant women in their lives both lie in deep comas.

Benigno an offbeat simple minded and virginal nurse is the prime caregiver to promising dancing student Alicia played by Leonor Watling.  He becomes infatuated with her, spying on her from his flat which overlooks her dance studio, whereas she barely knows him.  An auto accident has left her comatose and he manages to get hired by her psychiatrist father to care for her.  Marco's girlfriend Lydia played by Rosario Flores is an accomplished but rare feamle matador.  She tragically gets gored in the ring and lapses into a coma.

The men become friendly spending much time with the women in the clinic.  Benigno treats Alicia as if she were awake, conversing with her and caring for her every need but Marco can't get himself to follow suit.

Meanwhile, Marco is replaced at Lydia's side by her former boyfriend, also a bullfighter and he leaves the country. When he returns he learns that Benigno is in a bad way and visits him in prison.

Marco soon finds out that Alicia has awakened from her coma but her baby was dead at birth.  He has been forbidden from telling this to Benigno resulting in some sad consequences.

For me,  the gem on this movie was someone I had never heard of before, Caetano Velaso, at the piano singing  ""Cucurucucu Paloma"", a beautiful soothing version of that popular and traditional song.

Not bizarre enough for Almodovar
Usually Almodovar films are quite strange for my taste, and this one was more normal than his others.  There was no violence, no bizarre scenes, except for what I interpret as an illusionary aid to idea or thoughts, a sequence where a huge replica of a nude woman's body is laid out and a tiny man enters the vagina!  Now THIS is an Almodovar moment.

Simple movie, simple relationships
This movie is oddly simple about friendship as two men's lives come together because of the relationships with the women they love.  Their women both lie comatose in a hospital.  The journalist, Marco, meets the woman bullfighter and during a fight, she is gored by the bull and lapses into a coma.  Another man, a nurse/caretaker, Begnino, dutifully administers physical and nuturing for the woman dancer, Alicia.  She too, is comatose and Begnino is obsessed with her.

With a turn of a tragic event at the hospital,  Begnino, the friendship between the two men evolves deeper, not in any sexual way, just two friends caring for one another.

Talk to Her
The titles stems from Begnino tries to relay to Marco that communication is the key to caring for someone in coma.  Talk to Her...he says.

Many people may like Almodovar's films.  Yes, he is noted for outstanding honorary work in the film industry, but again, he's not for everyone.  ...Rizzo",1136937600,2,1708,4.712837837837838

If you find the idea of someone having sex with a poor woman who is lying comatose, defenseless and helpless, disturbing, then you might get ill.

There are two stories intertwined, but the one that actually makes some sense, with Marco (Dario Grandinetti) and Lydia (Rosario Flores) is cut short. Instead we are subjected to the pointless life of male nurse Benigno (Javier Camara) who cares for accident victim Alicia (Leonor Watling).

When the people at the hospital where Benigno works come to the conclusion that he must have had sex with her (while she was in a coma), needless to say they get rid of him and he ends up in jail. Sorry, I didn't have any sympathy for him at all. I thought he was a sick freak and he actually reminded me of ""George"" from ""Desperate Housewives"" in that he had grand illusions about some kind of ""love"" that doesn't exist.

The story of Marco and Lydia was fulfilling enough for me, and had Almodovar focused on this story alone, I think it could have been a much better film. As it is, I find he treads on that border between sick and disturbing. The fact that this film has won raves and awards goes over my head, because I not only think it doesn't work, I find the subject matter extremely upsetting.

1499841,4,B00005JLQW,"Almodovar here fashions a film unlike any of his others; he's a master at creating unique scenarios that defy easy categorization. An Argentinian reporter living in Spain, Marco, meets two people by chance--a female bullfighter, Lydia, and a male nurse, Benigno. He falls in love with the bullfighter, and forges a friendship with the nurse when Lydia is struck by a bull while in the ring and goes into a coma.

At the hospital where she lies, Benigno looks after another young woman in a coma, Alicia. It is there that the two men begin a friendship based on their mutual concern for the two women they are attached to.

The ending of this film is one of the strongest things about it; in fact, it's one of Almodovar's strongest endings of any of his films. It's brilliant, proving that fate often does come full circle in our lives. To say any more would be to give away the supremely clever, emotionally gripping plotting of this one of a kind film. What can be said is that Benigno belies his name; Marco is more tender than he might appear; and there's a surprise American actress in the story as well (yes, a real American actress who speaks surprisingly good Spanish).

It's always a real pleasure to see an Almodovar film and this is certainly no exception. The trademark infusion of Spanish culture is here as well, with scenes in a bullring--and there's also a concert of music by the great Brazilian composer-performer Caetano Veloso which is attended by Cecilia Roth (from All About My Mother) and other well known Almodovar actors.

There's also a very strange sequence of scenes from a fictional (i.e., made up by Almodovar himself) Spanish silent film called (English translation) The Shrinking Lover based largely on The Incredible Shrinking Man but also on Almodovar's fiery imagination, that has to be seen to be believed.

""Talk to Her"" uses unconventional and roundabout means to describe how relationships form out of life's tragedies: Two women in comas and the men who care for them. This is a beautifully photographed movie, and director Pedro Almodovar has crafted the film in such a way as to keep our interest in characters and a story that actually do very little. ""Talk to Her"" has elicited some strong reactions from viewers who object to how Benigno's behavior towards Alicia is portrayed in the film. Some people are left with the impression that the film condones Benigno's treatment of Alicia. I don't think that it does. It simply does not directly comment on the issue. Almodovar allows the characters in the film to comment on Benigno's conduct, but refrains from doing so himself. ""Talk to Her"" asserts that hurtful events in life often serve as a catalyst for the formation and discontinuation of relationships. Benigno's eventual abuse of Alicia is one of those events.

1499902,4,B00005JLQW,"It is difficult to write a review for this movie without providing a whole lot of spoilers to the plot.  It is about two men (Marco and Benigno )who love two women (Alicia and Lydia) that are both in comas.  They meet one day in the hospital and realize that they had been sitting next to each other at the opera recently.

Benigno, a male nurse, is taking care of Alicia who he really didn't know before her coma other than being kind of a ""stalker"" of her.  He first saw her out of his apartment window as she was taking dance lessons.  One day she drops her wallet and he returns it and walks with her to her building.  Noting that her father is a psychiatrist working out of their apartment, Benigno makes an appointment to see her father.  As he leaves her father's office he wanders around the apartment and goes into Alicia's room and steals one of her hair clips.  She returns to the room from the shower and quite naked and gets frightened by him as he flees.  Later after a car accident that put her in a coma she ends up in Benigno's hospital and he gets assigned to take care of her.

Marco is a writer of travel guides and his girlfriend in a coma is Lydia who was gored by a bull.  He thinks of his girlfriend as ""dead"" but Benigno tells him she hears everything if you just ""talk to her.""

Benigno the more mentally unbalanced of the two later does something stupid.  What transpires changes everything for the four people involved and makes Marco come to a lot a realizations about himself.

This is a good film for classroom discussion.",1119484800,3,1553,4.328719723183391
1499903,5,B00005JLQW,"This second last installment by Almodovar, before his more personal Bad Education, is by far his most mature and refined of all the films in his cinematic oevre.  Talk to her allows us a glimpse of what the human being is capable; at once extreme tenderness, punctuated by monumental obsession, traveling to abominable depths of depravity.  All of this, of course, is done in master strokes of visual composition, with sumptuous shots that penetrate the psyche.  Almodovar collaborator Alberto Iglesias rounds out this magnum opus with an equally astounding sound track, a hauntingly beautiful accompaniment, giving the film yet another dimension of brilliance.  All in all it's fantastic, almost inexplicable, a film that can only be understood by watching it in all its glory.",1117324800,,778,5.25
1499904,5,B00005JLQW,"Here is a film about women in comas and the men who love them. However, as the story unfolds, we learn that each man has a radically different perspective on love, yet they are able to bond with one another, maintain a friendship, and offer forgiveness. Talk to Her is a rare and unconventional picture that is not as much concerned with plot as it is with offering us three-dimensional characters, though the plot holds up its end as well--it just takes a little while to really heat up.

Marco (Dario Grandinetti), a freelance writer, has begun dating, and growing to love, a famous bullfighter named Lydia Gonzalez (Rosario Flores), who, before Marco came along, had a bad breakup with another bullfighter. Lydia ends up in a coma when she is brutally gored by a bull, and is taken to a clinic where Marco is at her bedside relentlessly. He meets a nurse at the clinic named Benigno (Javier Camara), who is caring for another coma patient, Alicia (Leonor Watling). Benigno seems to have a good relationship with Alicia, talking to her constantly as if she were able to hear him somehow, and volunteering to stay nights with her when the other nurse is unable to because of family problems.

Director Pedro Almodovar jumps around in time to give us some backstory on these individuals, and we learn that prior to the bullfight, Lydia, looking a bit upset, had told Marco that she needed to talk with him. How ironic now that the only communication they could possibly have would come from Marco speaking to her seemingly lifeless body. Benigno, ever cheerful, encourages Marco to talk to her, but Marco--an emotional man who is moved to tears by ballet and music--is hesitant to even touch Lydia. As we learn more information about Benigno and Alicia, their relationship gets creepier, and Marco's relationship with Lydia may not be all that it seemed to be either.

Talk to Her did not tell the story that I was expecting based on the outset of the film, but it is all the richer for it, because I was expecting a conventional picture where the one who is not in the coma learns life lessons from the inanimate partner somehow. But Almodovar is smarter than that, and gives us instead a film with a literary style, peeling back the layers of his characters gradually throughout the film until we see that the master plan was not to create a sappy romance, but instead to explore the depths of humanity, and show the different, and sometimes controversial, ways in which love manifests itself. The main revelation is so brutal that we see it coming a mile away but hope and pray that it's not true.

This is my first experience with a film by Almodovar, and rest assured that I will seek out his other films, as I thoroughly enjoyed Talk to Her. He tells a story the way it should be told, by letting the characters dictate what happens to them, instead of using them as pawns within the constraints of a plot. This is a film that is artistic without being flashy or showy, but rather by simply investing in its characters' emotions, and when we the audience can see that the filmmaker has done so, it is very easy for us to be brought into that world as well.",1116374400,6,3162,4.581272084805653

Almodovar wraps and joins love stories around profoundly forward-thinking social statements like a female bullfighter (played by Rosario Flores), who is both believable and fascinating as one of the principals.  In this film we are given the great gift of culture with some of the best artists and performances of today, in addition to a unique and touching human story of the one-sided love a disconnected young man has for a coma patient, formerly a dancer he espied through his front window.

I felt so bad for Benigno. I knew that it was wrong for him to go after that girl the way he did. It was such a borderline situation between lovesick and obsessed. One minute he's a caring nurse, the next a stalker. But I knew he was sincere. So sincere was he that I was hoping he would take his ""sleeping beauty"" and run away.

None of them really are willing to accept their life and see shortcoming for which they see little hope .....

The critical viewer may look on this film and say 'ignorance is bliss' but no we can not say that Begnigno is ignorant but rather he has mastered to ability to make the absolute best of even the most dire situations. Without giving away the story, even in jail the enthusiasm for life and his love of a young paralyzed dancer does not push him into despair....

1500010,5,B00005JLQW,"Talk to Her by Almodovar is really an exceptional film but be warned that the moral issues are disturbing. He does a great job of laying and intertwining the lives and stories of all the characters.

Basically the story is of two men and the relationships they have with two women in comas in a rehabilitation hospital. Marco has been in a stormy passionate relationship with Lydia, a fighter of bulls. Benigno, a mousey timid fellow, is the nurse for a beautiful young dancer who suffered brain injury after being hit by a car.

As Marco suffers with guilt and fear, Benigno urges him to talk to Lydia even if he thinks she can not hear him. What wonderful advice! We have known for the past 100 years, since it was discovered by Freud, that talking can cure. While Marco's relationship with Lydia was full of passion and conflict, Benigno's relationships iwth Alicia, the dancer, is more complex. He lived in the apartment across from her dance studio and came to worship her from afar. After she is hit by a car he becomes an orderly in the hospital where she lays. Benigno comes to totally worship this beautiful unconscious girl. He bathes her and moves all her joints and muscles daily so that her body does not stiffen in her unconscious state.

Then it happens. Alicia becomes pregnant while still unconscious. To say that Almodovar elicits a broad range of emotions from the viewer at this point is an understatement.

The viewer has been led to believe that Benigno is gay but in usual Almodovar style, he is very fluid in the way he characterizes sexuality. His sexuality seems to be constructed by fantasy.

On one side, Benigno's behavior was criminal, it was rape. He had sex with an unconscious women. Yet, we have the uncanny feeling that this timid shy zero nothing of a man was powerless in the presence of the vast beauty of his young patient. To make the issue more complex, after Benigno is imprisoned a series of good events occur as a result of his nursing and his one-sided rationship with Alicia.

Alicia was a double victim. A talented young beauty is struck down and becomes unconscious yet still alive. Then she is sexually violated while unconscious. But is Benigno a monster? He seemed powerless when he was attracted to her beauty before the accident and he placed himself in a situation where her powerful presence eventually resulted in a terrible situation, destructive to all parties involved.

In some ways the behavior of both men, watching carefully over the women they love, reflects man worship of the female. Even in a coma Alicia exerted the power of the beautiful woman. I know that my last comment will spark the ire of some but lets face it, beauty is a form of power.

All About My Mother is the only Almodovar film that I think is better than Talk To Her but both are exceptional films.",1101945600,2,2833,4.640718562874252
1500011,5,B00005JLQW,"The film opens with a stage production by an acclaimed choreographer Pina Bausch.  A woman, perhaps blind or dazed, wanders around on the stage while a man tries to move chairs and other things not to let her hit them.  What does that mean?

You will have your own answer later on, but the film here introduces us two men -- Marco and Benigno, both watching the production as the audiecne.  Months later, these two men meet each other at a medical clinic, where Benigno, a nurse working there, is taking care of a comatose woman Alicia.  Marco, whose severely injured girlfriend Lydia (and she is also in coma) is now taken to the place, is advised by kind-hearted Benigno to 'talk to her.'

The film tactfully reveals how come Benigno has been nursing Alicia for more than more years, or how Lydia came to be wounded like that.  And by the time you see what happen to these four characters in the following chapters, you will why Pedro Almodovar is now thought one of the most accomplished film directors in the world.

The film looks often melodramatic (in a good sense, of course) and sometimes very surreal, but it always is beautiful, and rich in tone.  The four actors are all impeccable (plus special guest Geraldine Chaplin), especially Javier Camara as Benigno, and Leonor Watling as ballet dancer Alicia.

There is one comical (and very sexually explicit) black-and-white part called 'Shrinking Lover,' which parodies old silent film style.  It is funny, but later you will find that its hidden meanings are so serious; it is shocking, audacious, and  even horrible.

And then, you will know that this is an Almodovar film, unconventional, daring, but somehow manages to be  compassionate.  Though 'Talk to Her' is not his most daring work, it still shows that only Almodovar can tell this bitter-sweet love story, with his taut storytelling skills and confident touch.

It is an old Mexican song entitled ""Coo Coo Roo Coo Coo, Paloma"" (or ""Cu Cu Ru Cu Cu, Paloma""). I can't seem to find a CD out there that has that song on it, other than the soundtrack of the movie. I'm sure there are some CD's by various artists released with this song.

1500015,1,B00005JLQW,"Pedro Almodvar's movie about the twists and turns of the human psyche and the complexities of intimacy. Although the film is well directed, the plot and theme is of such a perverse nature that I cannot give it the rating it would otherwise deserve. In addition to being somewhat predictable, the movie comes out as nothing more than vulgar cinema attempting to make the grotesque appear acceptable if not noble.

 Almodovar tries to make the demented and perverse character of Benigno (Javier Camara)appear as a sympathetic fallen hero which he cannot be. Benigno's actions are harldy the inescapable dilemmas Oedipus encountered: they were conscious choices. Benigno's actions can only be seen as morally unjustifiable and beyond redemption: no matter how hard he tries, Almodovar's subsequent attempt at portraying Benigno's self-inflicted demise as a tragedy fails because it can only be seen as a just punishment. Trying to further present Benigno as a fallen hero because his crime, by chance, allows Marco (Dario Grandinetti)to find his true love is but a failed attempt. One cannot justify the most vile criminal acts by the positive occurrence of chance and mere coincidence.

 The movie's suggestions as to the twists of fate and how such could justify such sick criminal conduct is utterly naive, perverse, and grotesque. In short, the storyline itself is nothing more than trash. Its ""creativity"" shows more a lack of imagination: as if the story writer got tired of old noble themes and had to go find new ones in the depths of the morally revulsive to pass as novel and creative.",1091491200,19,1592,5.064885496183206

Lydia is badly gored by a bull. Both women slip into a coma and it is in the hospital that the two men meet. Without giving the plot away, they both lose the woman in their lives, but they find friendship with one another.

Phew! Still with me? As with most of Almodovar's films, there are subtle depths that require repeated viewing to appreciate them fully. Almodavar deftly weaves the separate strands of the complex relationship of the four leading characters into a tightly focused and compelling piece of story-telling. Sad and uplifting, ironic and sympathetic, touching and unsentimental, this is a wonderful film.

Something is mysterious, culturally refined, elevated in sometimes incomprehensible way.  It's truly different so it must be good.  All of these approaches with Almodavar's ""Talk To Her,"" prove faulty.  In the end, the movie, with me at least, just didn't connect.
The plot comes across as a contrivance, a contrivance that doesn't necessarily work.  Two women are placed in the same hospital in a coma.  One is a dancer, one is a bullfighter.  Two men stand vigil waiting, talking, watching, wanting above anything for their objects of affection to wake up.  The two men gain a confidance with one another, a bonded friendship, and the story plays out with different pathways taken, paths not always moral, not always sane.
I believe from this we are supposed to get a juxtaposed look at different relationships, communication, what is love, and all this other deep meaning of life pondering stuff.  That seems to be the gyst of things at times in foreign films, we English speakers have this general sense that it's trying to say something deep if we could just stay awake through the droning plot to decipher the undecipherable.  In the end, I found ""Talk to Her"" leaving little impression and stiving to hard to make a revelation.  A revelation on what...I'm still not sure.

Talk to Her has a memorable plot. It really deserves the Oscar it got in 2002. Some other great things are its music, art direction and photography.
It is not a long film. The complexity of the main character's mind is the reason of the first hour of the film. The way he introduces the other man how to care his patient is presented slowly, but every step has its reason. Sure he has got a perverse mind in the end, but there is no reason to consider this is a perverse film...
After this, I cannot resist to ""review some reviews"". I think this film is morally irreproachable. The rapist, finally pays a price and you can feel sorry about him, but this is not a way to justify his behaviour. You can understand him in some way but he is clearly guilty of what he does.

Deciding to make myself look the part, I picked up this DVD and found it quite good. I'm not familar with the director, so I know nothing about how this stacks up to his other works on any terms.
The film begins to tell two storIies that eventually intertwine, and the two respective main characters become friends. Our hero is Marco, a journalist, whom we identify with because he is strong (despite that we see him cry in the first 3 minutes) and gentle, and more level-headed than Benignon (not sure I spelled that right), a male nurse.
Benignon is caring for a comatose dancer whom he has been infaturated with for some time. We see him as childlike and obsessive, but not in a bad way. We feel sorry for him in a helpless kind of way, due in no small part to the brilliant acting. He meets Marco, who is grieving his girlfriend who has also fallen into a coma after a bullfight.
The men's relationship is insightful, non-pretentious male bonding. We are wary, as Marco is, of Benignon. We are unsure of his sexuality and when his meekness may break into an unspeakable act.
Here's the low-down on the much-talked about sexual content of the film. Firstly, there is no sex, but there is a rape, which is not shown. Because we can rest assured that the rape was not violent, I don't see what the big deal is. It was not a plot device either, but  a believable and consequential event. There is a magical realist scene in which a man crawls inside a woman's vagina. The scene is only vaguely sexual, more exploratory than anything, and is really too weird to be offensive to me.
The film is in  Spanish, a language which I have not studied.  It is quite powerful and there is nothing really overbearing about it. The drama is sincere and effective, the dialogue and acting natural and believable, and competently filmed, although in this genre of film, that is a minor requisite. The tragic events don't drag the film down into gloominess or bitterness. In fact, it is still overall rather hopeful and pleasing, as was ONE FLEW OVER THE CUKOO'S NEST.
This is a given for art-house enthusiasts, but those mainstreamers looking to expand their horizons could do well to check out TALK TO HER",1073347200,5,2314,4.5576923076923075
1500118,2,B00005JLQW,"It seems that people are of two minds about this film; either they think it was offensive (""glorifies rape""), or they think it was one of Almodovar's best films (part of his ""mature stage"").  I will offer a third view: like all of Almodovar's films, it's entertaining but ultimately trivial; not even worth the fuss of such serious discussion.
Habla con Ella certainly marks Almodovar's ""mature"" stage, in the sense that the music and themes are more serious and less neurotic or whimsical, and the production value looks to be at an all-time high for his films.  Perhaps this is because he recently turned 60.  But despite this, his consistent trademark is still maintained here:  the film is very entertaining yet never displays any poignancy that could elevate it to classic status.",1072396800,9,785,4.924242424242424
1500182,5,B00005JLQW,"Pedro Almod&oacute;var, the famous Spanish director, is an auteur, and so you like his style or you don't. He makes rather frantic and gender-based movies, such as ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"", which I liked but found rather like a chicken with no head, and ""Tie Me Up ! Tie Me Down !"".
Apparently he's softened up at this stage. Talk to Her has not much in the way of quirky female characters : in fact, the two women are in a coma. Marco, a journalist and travel writer, is fascinated by Lydia, a famous female bullfighter, and tries to get an interview with her. He gets more than that, as they become a couple. But she is gored in the arena and falls in a coma.
At the hospital, Marco meets Benigno, who works as a nurse for Alicia, a ballerina also in a coma. It becomes quickly obvious that Benigno's relationship with Alicia is a bit more than nurse-patient. Despite himself, Marco takes to a friendship with Benigno, but events will conspire to complicate this seemingly idyllic situation.
Talk to Her is a tightrope event. Almod&oacute;var's story is at once touching and comedic, profound and shallow, and you can take it as great camp or a great drama. The theater plays, and the silent movie parody that Benigno goes to see, also reflect this duality. They are ironically funny, and somewhat ridiculous, but they are also pregnant with significance and can be taken quite seriously.
Look at the scene, for example, where Marco goes to Lydia's house to kill a snake because she has a snake phobia. After doing the deed, Marco sheds a tear. This is campy, but there is also a mystery : why is he crying ? This is answered later in the story, of course, but that's not my point. It's easy to slip from one to the other. It's ironic but also very honest.
Without wanting to spoil the ending, when Benigno commits an act which we would not expect, he suddenly appears to us very differently - it's very incongruous but also chilling. Like most of Almod&oacute;var's movies, Talk to Her is about relationships, but this time about relationships when there is no one answering you on the other side, and how we can forge worlds for ourselves outside of social mores and seem perfectly normal... but also how easy it becomes to fall to the other side of normality.
To someone who is unfamiliar with Almod&oacute;var, this is probably the best movie to start with. It's as colourful and stylized, but it's also very accessible and thematically profound.",1069286400,8,2471,4.618181818181818
1500183,5,B00005JLQW,"The most important consideration to keep in mind when watching Almodovar's penetrating film, ""Talk to Her"" is that the film, the plot, and the characters should not be viewed in a literal sense, but rather symbolically, almost allegorically. The two ballets that bookmark the film, as well as the silent film within the film, represent the messages that the diretor is attempting to convey; that being the navigation of the obstacles one encounters in relationships and living itself, and the various ways humans attempt to connect, learn about each other, and overcome the many obstacles.
Almodovar makes clear that this need for connection transcends the pat male/female roles and even the accepted notions of human sexuality and sexual orientation. It is no accident that among the characters are a male nurse, a female matador, a seemingly macho travel writer who cries when sad memories are awakened, and women in comas as the objects of affection. Almodovar brilliantly turns all ""acceptable"" roles on their ears and categorically proclaims that true love is spiritual and can exist and be fueled by many seemingly unuusal situations. The need for human connection supercedes humanity's constant efforts to dictate what constitutes a ""normal"" relationship.
""Talk to Her"" is a fascinating exploration of human loneliness and the need to connect in any way possible. It is one of Almodovar's most poetic, enigmatic and affecting films.",1067731200,5,1439,5.288209606986899
1500184,4,B00005JLQW,"A lot of these low rates reviews seem to have a problem with the rape case in this film. Not the story (if it's belivable), not the acting nor the cinematography, but with one simple thing that this movie is saying.
Rape issue is more symbolic than straight forward, seeing how the rape scene is actually played as a silent film-in-film. The woman in silent-film is in state of sleep, when her little lover enters her and stays there forever. Alicia is in coma (deep sleep) when her lover enters her and stays there ""forever"" (manifested in pregnancy and the child).
There is nothing heroic nor romantic about Benigno, but it's lonelyness, sadness and misplaced love, or feeling of love that comes from him. He's misguided by his own obsession that is disguiesed as love. He commits the hideous crime (which to him is an act of love) and is punished for it by....oh guess what...death. There is no rape glorification there, good people (by the way, anyone noticed comments on rapes within church ?).
Alicia's awakening is not some excellent side-effect of a rape, but its symbolic to the fact that those unlucky victims of rape can have somewhat normal life even after such terrible thing. It may not be easy, and they'll have to go through it step by step (just like Alicia starts practicing for dancing), but it's doable, if very hard.
Other than that, Lydia's character is great, and bullfighting scenes are breathtaking, such contrasts against each other: gracefull woman against bloody, wounded, 500kg bull. Too bad she was in for so short time.
Also dancing scenes are amazing too, cinematography is wonderfull, it's trully beautiful movie, do watch it if you have chance. (I just wanted to discuss the rape issue anyway).",1066521600,15,1728,4.821548821548822
1500185,5,B00005JLQW,"Pedro Almodvar presents another brilliantly twisted love story in TALK TO HER (Hable con ella), one that I can't stop thinking about. Javier Cmara as Benigno, a coma hospice nurse, was the standout performance for me. Beningo is both masculine and feminine, man and child, gentle and aggressive, caring and obsessive. At first glance, he appears to be grounded in the harsh realities of working in a coma clinic, but soon we see that he living in a fantasy world in which his comatose patient, Alicia, will marry him. He lovingly cares for her: cutting her hair, manicuring her nails, massaging her lifeless limbs and taking her out onto the terrace to sunbathe. He constantly speaks to Alicia, describing movies and dance performances, asking her opinion on furnishings for the love nest he's creating for them out of his late mother's apartment. Norman Bates through the lens of Almodvar.
Rosario Flores cuts quite a figure in the role of Lydia, a bullfighter. She is a rangy figure, all huge features on a long, slim face and ropy body. She looks quite out of place when she wears 'traditional' women's clothing and jewelry with her hair down, but is striking in the elaborate traditional dress of the toreador. When she appears in the ring she is quite ugly (by conventional definition) but you can't take your eyes off her. Like Beningo (and all the other characters ultimately) she is an intriguing combination of male and female, power and submission, modern and traditional.
There is not a wasted shot in this film. Almodvar's eye is utterly precise, as he weaves this wild and unlikely story in which the characters' world progressively grows smaller, as their lives draw together and begin to overlap.
Although ultimately I might like ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER more, I could hardly deny the power of this film.",1064448000,4,1814,4.87378640776699
1500186,5,B00005JLQW,"Firstly I have to admit that I was not an Aldomovar fan, and although All About My Mother was the one I enjoyed the most, I did find his other output, especially his earlier films an 'acquired taste'.
So I did think twice before renting Talk To Her,recommended highly by a couple of friends for some time, but finally I thought winning the award for best foreign language film at the Oscars can not be accidental.
And true to the hype,(for a change!!)since nine out of ten of the films that have been hyped turned out to be disappointing to say the least, Talk to Her was a beautiful film, full of heart and life, tragic and sad yet far from depressing..a very important distinction.
Friendships, obsession, lost loves, and deaths are all themes interwoven cleverly by Almodovar.
I will not go on about the story of the film itself, since it has been well reviewed by many, but I have few observations to make,
The genuis of Almodovar is not only he is the best Spanish director today, and like Tornatore in Italy, soley responsible for reviving the Spanish Cinema industry, but he is an excellent writer as well. It is always more interesting for the director to be the writer too,as it gives the film a personal and much more artistic dimension.
An example of this great writing is obvious in Talk To Her, as I felt sympathy for Benigno,instead of the revulsion that the act that sends him to jail later will undoubtedly and normally induce.
Although I am generally against bull fighting, I too found  myself sympathizing with Lydia, the female matador (beautifully played by Rosario Flores), and this is all the result of powerful writing!
The soundtrack was beautiful,tragic and melancholic but somehow subdued and never overbearing..just gently complementing the scenes.
For me personally, this is Almodovar's best film to date, one that will surprise you, will captivate you from the first minute to the last, a film that reminded me why I love cinema so much.",1064188800,,1966,4.748538011695906
1500187,5,B00005JLQW,"I've watched this film, probably 6 or 7 times, and each time, I've walked away with something new.
Almodvar has brilliantly weaved together this new masterpiece by incorporating silent film, music, ballet, flashbacks, and scenes shot out of sequence to come up with a seemingly simple film which will surly stick with you for a long time.
Telling you the plot would be pointless, this is, in my opinion, one of those that you just have to watch, having no idea what's going to happen.
The acting is exceptional, the character's are unforgettable, the script is perfect, the pace is such, so as to keep you guessing, but still allows time for all the subtle elements which makes this such a rich cinematic experience.
Don't hesitate with this one!",1063497600,,746,4.790697674418604
1500188,4,B00005JLQW,"I recently watched ""All About My Mother"" and was so impressed with Spanish director, Pedro Almodovar, that I had to see his next film ""Talk to Her"".  I've always been a fan of his work but ""All About My Mother"" was his last film that really made me to go out and buy the dvd.  ""Talk to Her"" is an interesting film but I didn't enjoy it as much as ""All About My Mother"".  The story involves two men, who almost meet at a dance recital and then become friends as the two women they are in love with lay in comas at the same facility.  It was hard to feel sympathy for Benigno ( a male nurse who sees to it that he is caring for the woman he is obssessed with) after a certain point in the movie, which I won't reveal, but it was interesting to see the friendship develop between him and Marco, who's bullfighting girlfriend, lies in a coma as well.  Almodovar provides interesting and diffrent situations in his movies that you don't see in the typical Hollywood fare.  If you are a fan of Pedro Almodovar, you'll want to catch this film.  Otherwise, I say buy or rent it with caution.  My personal favorites are ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" and ""All About My Mother""---you can't go wrong with either of these two films.",1062374400,,1233,4.261802575107296
1500189,5,B00005JLQW,"""Talk To Her"" is one of the best foreign movies released in 2002.  The storyline has many creative and daring scenes, giving it that unique dramatic climax.  Every scene continues to grow in interest, forcing the audience to never blink.  The emotional acting is great.  The longing feelings are expressed the best.  The production and the directing is also magnificant.  The Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay and the additional nomination for Best Director were well-deserved.  However, the voting academy wrongfully dissed ""Talk To Her"" for Best Foreign Film.
A man's wife lays in a coma after a bullfighting accident.  At the hospital, he meets a man whose ""love of his life"" also lays comatosed.  The two become fast friends.  Many dramatic turns occur amongst the four.  Suddenly, a shocking event occurs, which changes everyone's lives, awake or unconscious.
""Talk To Her"" is recommended to those looking for heavy drama.  This will give them an experience to never be forgotten.  Don't rent the english version.  As all other foreign films, they change the script, therefore, demolishing every characters' emotions.  The spanish version expresses everything that the producers intended.",1062028800,2,1198,5.297872340425532

Lo que es realmente increible es como Pedro Almodovar transmite el amor de una forma inocente pero eso si, esa inocencia no es nada mas que la mascara de la verdadera cara de la lujuria.
Dicen que es un poco sadica, si es sadica o no, eso realmente para mi no me importa, yo soy un cinefilo convencido y veo lo que sea tanto si me guste como si no.
Las intervenciones de los invitados como Paz Vega, Elena Anaya etc... fueron claves, a parte que la escena de Paz Vega en el corto en blanco y negro fue sublime, bastante salada ;-)

Although at first glance these two tales appear to be unrelated, towards the end both intertwine as friendships are made and new love blossoms. But anyone who has watched it knows that there are a multitude of themes and issues running throughout this film. I won't necessarily go into what I interpret the themes to be because other reviewers have done a good job of exploring them. I simply adored TALK TO HER. I believe it is the best foreign film of 2002. The cinematography of the arid Spanish countryside is gorgeous and brings back happy memories of my trip to Spain many years ago. The characters are convincing and three-dimensional and the emotions displayed between them are realistic. It is amazing how well controversial subjects are treated with grace and skill without offending the audience or letting those scenes overpower the rest of the film. TALK TO HER is a pure delight. It only makes me wonder why I waited so long to see it in the first place.",1060041600,2,1107,4.624365482233503
1500252,5,B00005JLQW,"Post perusal of the aforementioned reviews, one is inclined to interpret ""Talk to Her"" quite superficially. However, critical attention to the film's musical themes elicits deeper, more profound interpretations that urge viewers to question whether this film is as innocent as it seems.
Benigno is a victim of plutonic love. After developing an obsession for Alicia, a ballerina who delves into a coma for years, he not only nurses her as an intimate friend, he eventually martyrs himself for her as well.
If one pays attention to the subtlest details within the film, he or she will see there is limited, circumstantial evidence that deems Benigno guilty of the ""crime"" against Alicia. There is just as much evidence to deem another guilty.
The director masterfully punctuates the movie with a retro ""talkie"" that implies a warped phenomenon in Benigno. However, poetic intuition reveals an ulterior motive in another seemingly innocuous character.
Marco, a man who befriends Benigno, while caring for his comatose lover, Lydia, becomes Benigno's nemesis in pursuit of the same woman. Critical viewers will notice how each relationship overlaps like themes and motifs in a musical composition. This is relevant to understanding Marco's betrayal of Benigno. For instance, after caring for his own comatose lover for months, Marco discovers that his lover, Lydia, had repaired her relationship with her ex-lover before she had her debilitating accident. Distraught and alone, Marco wanders into an affinity for Alicia still in an unconscious state. It may not seem likely that Marco is capable of perpetrating the ""crime"" unto Alicia, but there is a few key lines in the film that allude to this strong possibility.
At one point, Benigno and Marco discuss Benigno's feelings about Alicia. He confesses in public he's in love with her and would like to marry her, despite her comatose state. Marco chides Benigno for confessing such ""nonsense."" Moreover, Marco tells Benigno that he won't be around to help him if ""it"" ever comes to light. What exactly is Marco alluding to? It seems Marco possesses some hidden knowledge of something, (perhaps the crime against Alicia), which Benigno knows nothing about.
The director deliberately leaves controversial angles of the film ambiguous in order to challenge viewers. No great work of art is simple. Any great work of literature, film or music is deliberately left ambiguous in order to provide multiple interpretations.
The director of ""Talk to Her"" doesn't want viewers to take any detail in the four relationships for granted. Unfortunately, though, most viewers are not as critical as the director would like, and only see the surface of any complex relationship. Yet, not everything in this world is as rosy as a harlequin romance. There are dark, hidden forces in the human psyche that manifest themselves in every human relationship--especailly when that relationship involves competition for a desired object.
In my humble opinion, Marco radically usurps the love of Alicia from Benigno's loving, caring, nurturing, and most importantly platonic hands. But, like a saint who dies for the sins of his loved ones, Benigno unconsciously takes the fall for Marco--a man who makes a choice to sacrifice the love of a friend for the love of a woman in a most complicated way.
This is why the film earned an Oscar. If the film were as cut and dry as other reviewers would have you believe, surely that award would not have been granted.",1059091200,,3481,5.130281690140845
1500253,4,B00005JLQW,"Another in a long line of outstanding Almodovar movies this flick does not dissapoint fans of his outlandish look at life. There are plenty of plot analysis reviews, controversy and interpretations so look around for the ""right"" one. What would a Almodovar movie be without ruffling a few feathers? The essence of the movie involves the lives of four people, two couples in love(one in a bizarre one way romance)  where there are two women who end up in comas. It is a well done movie.  There is a movie within a movie that is excellent, done in black and white in old silent movie style. The set designs in the black and while silent are magnificent  and reveal a tragic love story where the ""little man"" (he takes a potion) makes the ultimate sacrifice to prove his love. This sequence is in itself  worth viewing the movie. Besides the cinema itself the added features to the DVD are super. I thoroughly enjoyed Pedro Almodovar and Geraldine Chaplin as they discussed  the whole movie as it plays without dialogue, explaining details and revealing unnoticed situations that may have been missed by just watching the movie. Their excitement over the results of their labor are infectous. Whatever you do watch the directors commentary version AFTER you have viewed it once. The performance by Caetano Veloso is outstanding as he sings an incredible version of ""CuCu RuCu Cu Paloma "" and is so good you'll be tempted to buy the soundtrack. Almodovar admits in the discussion of the film that he is not the same director from the 80's or 90's so if you are expecting the old Almodovar he has moved on. He has evolved and matured but continues to push peoples buttons in even more provocative ways. So is the movie funny like some of the older movies? Yes and no, there are moments where the ridiculous though somber scenes hit on both sides of the pendulum. The acting by the cast is very, very good, especially Beningo the male nurse who is a sordid character. His transformation from being an effeminate male nurse to a ""tougher"" type in prison is a thing of beauty; it is like two different people. You will ultimately be the judge of this movie but if you like Almodovar more than likely you will enjoy this movie where everything comes together for your viewing pleasure.",1058400000,26,2276,4.665835411471321
1500254,4,B00005JLQW,"Yes, a good film. Most reviewers miss the cutting cynicism. [Cynicism that suggest tragedy for us all, sorrow.  But, don't.]  For example : You had better turn up the microphone and even if you do, people don't hear what you have to say, they only want to comment on the fact that you said ""inmate"" instead of ""intern"". Or : Even if you have something vital to say, your lawyer will make you tell nothing; if you're doing a ballet, like Geraldine Chaplin's character: it had better be about destruction and war and ghouls. People end up like the endless patterns of plants in the movie's background scenery. To wit :  this is echoed by the appearance of the xerox'ed pairs of vegematic dancers at the film's end. We don't talk to one another -- we are ""talking to plants"", there is a lawyer or a psychiatrist or a glass shield between us. Dancing is not being a dancer--it is just more leg stretches. The truth of love cannot be spoken person to person. We could follow one another around with a microphone pressed to one another's lips, but all that is emitted is a gutteral sigh, like in the finale. Still, this movie shows us that it needn't be like that.
And, the main character survives amidst comatose humanity because he is true to his emotions, not fully willing to ""sell out"" and become a real life zombie. In the end, we are forced into shedding a tear -- perhaps a hopeful gift from this talented filmmaker.
I don't have a lot of DVD's but I have ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" -- don't let this title fool you into a negative reaction. This is meant to signal humor much like in ""I Love Lucy"", where often the comedy stems from Lucille Ball's being on the edge of nervous hysteria. A wonderfully funny movie.
As for ""Talk To Her"" thanks, Almodovar for a last chance before total anaesthesia -- hopefully we will come out with it before the next one kicks.",1057536000,2,1880,4.443478260869565
1500255,5,B00005JLQW,"Those familiar with Almodvar's work know that his characters are always colorful, diverse, his films being anything but boring and conventional. Perhaps this was the most obvious choice for most original screenplay at this years Academy Awards...

First, I must comment on some of the other reviewer's statements that Almodvar condones the violent act in the film, and I must say I couldn't disagree more. He is simply the storyteller of this lonely tale, not the advocate. Furthermore, in listening to his commentary, (which proved to be as fascinating as the film itself) he explains the motivations behind the characters (unlike most other mainstream films, where the protagonist is either evil or good with no grey area) this gives the characters more depth and realism.

That being said, 'Talk To Her' plays like a symphony of poetry, colors and even passionate music, that evoke complex emotions within us. Almodvar has a very unique style, he is a true master of his characters, they are what drive his pictures. It is the story of four people that are mirror images of one another and yet so different at the same time. The twisting plot developments that will leave you speechless and at the edge of your couch. I know I was mesmerized from beginning to end.

A film with many themes, the main one being solitude and loneliness. Yes, it has elements of tragedy, but also encompasses humour, wit and thoughtfulness. The short silent film fantasy in which a little man attempts to please a woman with what can only be described as total and complete commitment, both amusing and heartbreaking. It is also a pivotal change in the film's direction. If you are a fan of Almodvar, then you have no doubt seen this already, but if you've never seen his work before, I recommend trying this one first (most recent of the 17 films he has directed). It is a true work of art.",1056240000,11,1874,4.76
1500256,5,B00005JLQW,"I have seen All About my Mother and Talk to Her. Both films are unique and interesting in their own ways. Almodovar tries to convey universal themes by adding outrageous characters, spins and situations to his films.
Although I have not completely figured out the film, it is one that is filled with meaning and real-life struggles.
Some themes it evokes include male-female dependency.
It is interesting to see that Lidia, a woman is a matadora, she kills and has a more stereotypically masculine job. While her ""lover"" is masculine and not effeminate like Benigno. Benigno's woman is the one that lives, she is the creator of art of meaning, she is a dancer.
There are many themes and ideas in this film about male dependency on women and vice versa.
In my opinion the character of Benigno should not be extoled for his actions with Alicia, but he does it out of mental sickness. From the beginning Alicia is glorified as the girl that has a father that is a doctor. The audience does nto develop a relationship with Alicia, because she is very wealthy and above the other characters in class.
The film makes you think and is definentely worth buying!",1055894400,,1153,4.684729064039409
1500257,4,B00005JLQW,"Winner of the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay
When I read that a foreign film won a screenplay Oscar, I knew that I had to see the movie.  I'm not sure if that has happened in the history of the Academy Awards.  I had also heard positive reviews, but I did not have any sort of expectations going into this movie.  I have a difficult time comparing the screenplay to an English language film, but this was a very good movie.
The movie opens in a theater where there is a dance performance going on.  Two men are sitting next to each other, but they do not know each other.  One of them is deeply touched and the other notices this and remembers it.  The performance is over and they go back to their lives.  Benigno is a male nurse who has one patient, Alicia.  Alicia is in a coma.  Benigno shows incredible care and tenderness for Alicia and early on we get the image that he is a fantastic nurse and that she is well served.  Marco, the other man at the theater, meets a female bullfighter, Lydia, and they begin a relationship.  When she is gored one day and ends up in a coma, Marco meets Benigno.  They begin an odd friendship and Benigno helps Marco learn how to better care for Lydia.
It is at this point where we begin to see a different side of the characters.  Benigno is revealed to a bit more obsessed with his patient than one would deem healthy.  It is clear that he believes himself in love with Alicia.  Marco's love for Lydia is being tested by the coma as well as by his memories of their time together.  As the movie progresses we see more and more of the backstory that got the characters to where they are at the start of the movie.  This changes our understanding of Marco and especially Benigno and it changes how we perceive their relations to each other.
By the end, Talk to Her went in some directions I did not expect with the characters.  I was surprised by this movie, but it was a pleasant surprise.  I liked Talk To Her.  I can't speak to whether or not it deserved the Oscar that it won, or if it deserves a spot on a Top 10 list...but this is a good movie and if anyone has an interest in foreign movies, this is one to see (not necessarily the one to see, but it is one to see)",1055721600,3,2223,4.185882352941176
1500258,5,B00005JLQW,"Talk to Her has a tone that Hollywood movies usually cannot reach.  It reveals information slowly throughout and lets you develop your own thoughts about the characters.  You spend a great deal of the beginning trying to figure out if the main character is Marco or Benigno and then you realize it's really one big story.
As is common in movies, you begin to sympathize with the characters, but here they do things to make you think twice about them, not unlike situations in real life where friends reveal their weaknesses.
Marco and Benigno really occupy different facets of the male psyche.  Marco is outwardly masculine, but sensitive to the point of tears in the right situations.  Benigno is sexually ambiguous and cold emotionally, so his actions later are a big surprise.  So while the movie seems to be about the women in these men's lives, it gradually becomes about the friendship they develop between themselves.
The filmmaking is tremendous.  The same idea could have been a tedious bore with the wrong director.  I will certainly take this as a cue to see Pedro Almodovar's earlier films.",1055376000,8,1102,4.86096256684492
1500259,1,B00005JLQW,"Talk to Her is the kind of film that breaks your heart as a viewer, and not in a good way. So much about it screams out for adoration - the gorgeous photography, the economy of dialogue, the small moments of humor. And yet, all of that is squandered in the final third of the movie, which tries (and fails) to romanticize the actions of a complete psychopath. The character in question is Benigno (Javier Camara, in an outstandingly creepy performance), a male nurse who, an hour into Talk to Her, commits a crime that can't possibly be justified. But director Pedro Almodvar stupidly insists on turning Benigno into a symbolic martyr of some kind, which has to be one of the most fatal flaws in movie history (and I saw Scooby Doo). The result of Almodvar's misguidance is bound to make most viewers, conservative or liberal, bitter and hostile toward Talk to Her.
Benigno's portrayal undermines nearly everything in the film. It makes his deep friendship with a journalist (Dario Grandinetti) seem implausible. And it causes Almodvar to abandon the character of Lydia (Rosario Flores), a female bullfighter who dominates the fascinating opening third of the movie. Once we learn a secret Lydia has been hiding, her character (admittedly comatose) vanishes, and she is sorely missed. We're then left with a sort of ""love triangle"" that rings false in almost every way.
The turning point that sends Talk to Her spinning downward is a short movie-within-the-movie that, at first, is a campy spin on old silent movies. But a few minutes in, it turns into one of those self-pretentiously disturbing scenes (think Prince Charles) that should have a warning sticker on it saying, ""Director Going Overboard"". You will squirm, and worse, for no real purpose. Almodvar has been hailed as great director and portrayer of women. But you'll be hard pressed to find the subsequent scenes woman-friendly. Talk to Her starts out a fascinating study of relationships, only to then wallow in the literal objectification of women. Here, women are a tool to help men find salvation. It's a stupid and arrogant idea, and it'll make Almodvar no new fans, no matter how clearly talented he may be.",1055116800,25,2176,4.899728997289973
1500260,5,B00005JLQW,"This past March, Talk To Her won Pedro Almodovar the Oscar for best original screenplay. This is not surprising, as Talk To Her is a brilliant, wondrous story. As I watched it, I couldn't help but invest completely in the characters. The character that I cared about most was Benigno, a young male nurse who is very much in love with Alicia, the comatose girl that he cares for. I was very much moved and saddened by Benigno's story. Although Benigno becomes less sympathetic as the story progresses, he remains the focal point of the story, in my opinion. It's very touching and sad to see his love/obsession for Alicia unfold.
The other major character is Marco, whose bullfighter girlfriend Lydia is gored by a bull and remains in a coma just like Alicia. Marco and Benigno soon strike up a friendship, taking solace in their ability to relate to one another. Soon, as Benigno's troubles grow, Marco becomes his only true friend.
It's a beautiful story that works on many levels. It's about relationships. The ""relationships"" between two men and the comatose women that they love, and the relationship between the two men themselves. Indeed it can be disturbing at times, particularly as it becomes clear that Beningo has some psychological problems to deal with. However, I found Talk To Her to be an incredibly moving and profound experience.
I have not seem many of Almodovar's films. I enjoyed his 1999 Academy Award-winning All About My Mother, but I found Talk To Her to be even beyond that fine film. Based on this one, I plan to delve deeper into the work of Pedro Almodovar who seems to be a genuinely imaginative, compelling and complex filmmaker.",1054771200,5,1660,4.7874564459930316
1500261,4,B00005JLQW,"Pedro Almodovar's ""Talk to Her,"" a first-class film that provided a pleasant surprise on Oscar night, comes to market with commentary from the ""chatterbox"" Spanish director and one of his actors, Geraldine Chaplin.
Almodovar, who won an Oscar for ""Talk to Her's""  screenplay, spends a lot of time describing the obvious, but the commentary does have its moments. The director (""Matador"") returned to the bullfighting arena in this film, and displays a detailed knowledge of the blood sport's rituals. Actress Rosario Flores spent four months learning how to fight, Almodovar says, and actually received offers for representation as a matador.
Almodovar, suffering from a cold, does most of the talking, laughing at his own torrent of words and at one point promising Chaplin, ""I'll be silent at any moment."" His chipper chat is in contrast to the film's fairly somber tale of two women in comas. Veteran actress Chaplin is respectful of her director and overly reserved.
Images are a bit soft and tend to be flat in outdoor scenes and dark indoors. Colors are OK, but unusually reserved for the director's work. The Spanish-language film comes in adequate Dolby Digital 5.1. Engish subtitles are in bright yellow, clear and easy to follow. Almodovar and Chaplin's commentary is in Spanish, also with subtitles.",1054771200,4,1310,5.150234741784038

But ultimately I found it impossible to identify with a rapist.  This movie is yet another example of rape and other violence against women is normalized and eroticised in film.  It's really very simple and the complex statement about how love crosses boundaries, is false.  A man having sex with a woman who is not able to consent, because she is in a coma, is disgusting and makes me very angry.",1054598400,16,545,4.75531914893617

He managed to create a style of his own, visually and conceptually. This movie is a lot different from all his earlier movies. You can recognize his camera style, the acting, the music, and the light comedy but you will not see the strong melodrama and the camp elemets. This movie is Almodvar mixed with a bit of Bergman. This is a start of a new phase in his directing career and I am looking forward to see what he is going to do next..",1054512000,3,611,4.230769230769231
1500372,5,B00005JLQW,"Some directors have infrequent moments of brilliance in an otherwise average output.  Other directors approach the exceptional but just don't quite make it.  Pedro Almadovar is a gifted artist who consistently creates works of art on film that are brave, bizarre, are about subjects that few others would venture, and his end product is not only a story well told but one told with an attention to every detail that makes movies magic.  His sense of atmosphere, of color, of set decor, of flashbacks - stream of conscious writing just when the story seems oddly concrete - of choice of music - all are first rate. The black and white silent movie within a movie is at once hilarious and tender.  Almadovar is a poet and he is graced by a company of actors who obviously treasure the experience of his creations.  Muc has been said about the story line of this movie and another synopsis is simply redundant.  Suffice it to say that here is a story about how we as individuals bond with others and the circumstances that can accompany that bonding, here, stretches the imagination in a wondrous way.  ALL of the actors are excellent and wholly credible.  The DVD is graced by a conversation between Almadovar and Geraldine Chaplin in one of the most sensitive interactions with creator and created that is on film.  This is a lustrously beautiful, wise, gently comedic, and tragic tale.  With all of the inherent gloom and doom in this story the viewer is left with a refreshingly life-affirming glow.  This should be in every movie lover's collection.",1054166400,,1551,4.771535580524344
1500373,5,B00005JLQW,"""Talk To Her""--the title holds more than a bit of irony for the women in this film are in comas. This is the most enigmatic of Almovodars films. And the male nurse Benigno is the most enigmatic character to appear in any of those films. Does Benigno like women? Yes apparently. Does Benigno like men? Yes apparently. Apparently, but nothing is certain about Benigno. Like many of Almovodars heros and heroines Benigno is obsessed by  someone or perhaps two someones. We know he is obsessed with Alicia, a dancer, now in a coma, who he has been hired to care for. But also he is obsessed with the soft spoken travel journalist Marco. Marco's bullfighting girlfriend is also in a coma and so he visits her in the hospital where Benigno cares for Alicia. Marco catches Benignos eye and to lure Marco to him he positions Alicias nude comatose body in provacative postions and leaves her door ajar so a passing Marco will catch a glimpse of her and enter. So the two meet and a strange friendship materialises over a shared obsession over comatose Alicia. But neither of them can ""talk to her"". So they talk to each other. But as always in all obsessive love triangles someone ends up betraying someone. That proves true here as well but nothing else about this love triangle is usual.
 The characters all remain enigmatic perhaps even to themselves but obsession proves to be the thing that gives life its meaning as is so often true in Almovodars films. To Almovodar women are mysterious and never moreso than when they are in a coma. By having the object of desire both vulnerable and close and yet so utterly remote at the same time Almovodar gives us his most mysterious meditation on the nature of love yet.  The very funny fantasy scenario with shrinking man climbing into sleeping woman is perhaps the most absurd literalization of obsession ever filmed.",1054080000,6,1857,4.690184049079755
1500374,1,B00005JLQW,"I am absolutely dumbfounded and amazed at the number of people who rhapsodize about this film, and can only conclude that its popularity is an example of ""the emperor's new clothes"" mentality... What I'd like to point out is that one of the main characters is a stalker and rapist who completely violates the woman with whom he is ""in love."" Apparently, viewers of this film who like it seem to think his actions are less repugnant because he is depicted as being ""in love"" and because his victim is in a coma! ... Well, I don't know how they define love, but stalking, violating, raping and impregnating a defenceless woman are hardly part of MY definition! To me there is nothing bittersweet about this story and I felt nothing but revulsion and anger towards this character and the movie as a whole. The director utterly manipulates the audience to feel sympathy for this idiot; it amazes me that most viewers seem oblivious to this. If a story about a lynching KKK member were just as beautifully,skillfully and cleverly filmed, acted and scored, would you not see beyond that to its repugnant core?!!! It's a horrible premise, sugar-coated to seem ""poignant"" and ""deep"" and ""moving"", but one which, in my opinion, anyone who is truly caring would NOT be able to get beyond. Besides all this, it's a pretentious, totally melodramatic movie with an utterly ridiculous, laughably overwrought ending. I can't believe anyone could find this movie moving. And what is all this ridiculous stuff about how Pedro Almodovar loves women, understands women, etc. I think this movie makes it pretty apparent he has no empathy whatsoever for women and in fact quite probably has a few problems with them! (Incidentally, 4 bulls were slaughtered for the purposes of making this film, leading Almodovar to be charged and fined. Nice guy. Caring, sensitive guy.)",1053907200,19,1850,4.8949044585987265

Odd, but not bizzare, view of redemption via not-quite-mature love.
It's the story of a mama's boy, who falls in love with a ballerina next-door, but is too shy and selfconscious to woo her in a normal way. But his opportunity comes when she is put into a coma with a traffic accident. He becomes her primary caregiver. He talks to the comatose girl and does her hair, her fingers, massages and washes her daily. Falling in 'love' with an object of desire who never talks back, never interacts except in his head. He is smitten with a silent movie and rapes her one night. fired from the job, jailed, out of touch with the only thing that matters to him, he eventually commits suicide. While she, still comatose delivers a stillborn baby and awakens as a result.
There is much to think about in this gentle movie...Interaction with the woman, interaction with another story line about a comatose bullfighter and her boyfriend. But most of all the story about him. Never loved, yet tender, unable to express himself to a live conscious woman, he truely loves her as a person despite her inability to return his love at all. A surprising movie, worth the time to see.",1053820800,3,1293,4.650655021834061
1500376,2,B00005JLQW,"Talk to Her could have been a great film.  Almadovar has obviously mastered the art of the narrative film.  He has developed and matured tremendously as a writer since his early overly slapstick films.  His visual abilities have progressed far beyond most of his peers.
So why did I make the statement that ""Talk to Her could have been a great film""?  Because there is a line that needs to be drawn as to what is acceptable in cinema.  Western society has progressed beyond the point of rape being anything but bad.  Sure every nation may punish rapists differently, but it is assumed that rape is a bad thing.  In Talk to Her, a character rapes a comatose woman, and that woman is awoken, revived, saved when she gives birth (a direct result from the rape) to a stillborn child.  In my opinion, this is sick and demented, to maintain that a female character can be saved by a rape?  The rapist is ostracized from society (and more importantly the comatose woman that he ""loves"") and rightly punished (jailed), but this does not fix the problem I have, the woman was still ""saved"" by being raped.  It could be argued that his ""love"" saved her, but that ""love"" was represented by non-consentual sex.  Of course the rapist has an excuse, he's a social outcast, boardering on mental retardation.  So, he didn't know better.  He didn't know it was wrong.  He was only living by his emotions, he wasn't thinking.  Does this make it any better?  I know this is Spain, a country deeply routed in Catholicism, but was abortion really not an option for a woman that is in a coma and becomes pregnant by rape.  Think of the metaphors involved in a much more progressive scenario in which the hospital aborts the baby, and she wakes up.  The abortion saves her life.  Not the rape.
Without that minor (?) plot point, Talk to Her would rank up there with All About My Mother, as one of Almadovar's greatest films.  Instead, Almadovar opened my eyes to his conservative, machismo attitude and closed my eyes to his talents as a filmmaker.
Of course, many Almadovar fans can look right past this.  Many did not even notice, or said I was reading into the situation too much.  So maybe its just me.  Or maybe I now understand what many of my leftist, intellectual friends have told me from the beginning, Almadovar is clearly a product of Franco Spain.  I can think of no greater insult.",1053388800,12,2372,4.553191489361702
1500377,2,B00005JLQW,"I think part of the critical honeymoon this film has enjoyed has to do with Almodvar's oeuvre, which has been consistently provocative, challenging, and interesting. He has made some very good films, such as the hilarious ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" and the intriguing ""Law of Desire"" (La Ley del deseo), and some very disappointing films, such as ""Matador"" and ""Tie me up, Tie me Down."" I would place this film in the middle of the spectrum, despite all the hype about it being Almodvar's most accessible film. My objections to the film are primarily artistic, but I happen to find it morally reprehensible as well. Had the story been done with greater depth and sensitivity, I would undoubtedly find little in the way of a ""moral"" objection. In fact, I find that the director ""uses"" the women in this film in the same way as the male characters use them, as vessels for their hopes, dreams, and desires, not as automomous individuals with their own hopes, dreams, and desires. I find that objectionable on many levels. Dario Grandinetti as Marco is effective, if somewhat one-note, and Javier Camara as the childlike Benigno is adequately convincing in a complex role. The female roles are lacking in the depth and richness with which Almodvar usually infuses his women, which is unfortunate given the title of the film. Caetano Veloso does a lovely version of ""Cucurucucu Paloma,"" but the tenderness of his version of the standard is out of place, even wasted, in a film which often descends into tawdry melodrama and very pat characterizations. I know we'll see better work out of Pedro Almodvar, and I hope he doesn't believe all the publicity about this particular film (as Simone Signoret famously said: ""My performance is finished, and publicity will not make it better"").",1052870400,5,1796,4.891803278688524

It was different even from the early works of the same people.  There was no moving picture in this film.  This was a very well done play where the movie approach was used just to move people from one scene to another and from one area to another.

Now I don't know if that's a mistaken impression or not, but ""Talk to Her,""is far from what I expected.  I don't think I've had a more rewarding motion picture experience in some time.  The only film that comes close is ""Y Tu Mama Tambien,"" and ""Talk to Her,"" is up a few steps from that wonderful movie.  Two men, two women, two totally different relationships bound by equally tragic events, and resolved in ways sad, perverse, and beautiful.  And don't forget - comic.  The humor in this movie runs from humane to surreal, and for the most part is simply touching.  One of the great ""finds"" of this movie was Caetano Veloso performing a gorgeous rendition of ""Cucurrucucz Paloma,"" that brought tears to the eyes of one of the movie's characters, and to mine as well; and Mr. Almodovar had the wit to allow the song its course.

1500429,4,B00005JLQW,"Pedro Almodovar, you either understand his films and like them or you shun his masterpieces like the plague. I'm of the former genre. I think he is brilliant. ""All About My Mother,"" was in my opinion a masterpiece. Cutting thru the sexual taboo's as with a Rapier, leaving you with your mouth wide open, or walking up the aisle.
I was a little apprehensive about this new film,'Habla con ella,' but I shouldn't have worried as it was another triumph for the Director. Who else could direct a film about two comatose women and two oddball men who are in love with them, one being unnaturally fixated. The two men for the most part would not have even met had they not seen each other at the hospital, where Lydia (Rosorio Flores), and Alicia (Leonore Watting) have close rooms. Both women were dancers so-to-speak, Alicia was a classical ballet student and Lydia, danced with the Toro in the Arena of the noonday sun, the bull hooked Lydia and a car caught Alicia.
The men Benigno, (Javier Camara), a nurse, and the one who talks to Alicia as if she were alive, and Marco (Dario Grandinetti), who is in love with Lydia, who is on the rebound from another affair....
Both men do a great job and you can feel their angst, especially Benigno, as he is not in control of his feelings for Alicia.
There was one of the greatest renditions of 'CU, CU ,RU, CU, CU, PALOMA, that I have ever heard, very sexy and moving.
Also, Almodovar brings in his stars from other pictures. At the nightclub you will see a few actors from All About My Mother. Marisa Paredes, (Huma Rojo) and Cicilia Roth (Manuela) By far Rosorio Flores eats up the camera, especially in her bullring outfit, her face and litheness gives her a wonderfully tormented and tragic look. She is an Almodovar actor.

As in most Almodvar films, this one tells of strange relationships and deep feelings. All the characters are well developed, and the intertwining of the stories is flawless.
Highlights of the film: Caetano Veloso singing ""Cucurrucucu paloma"" (don't miss Cecilia Roth's and Marisol Paredes' cameos in this scene), the bullfighting scenes, and the silent b&w movie scene.

The subject is love and it is handled with great humor, with an underlayer of scorching grief. Right and wrong is all in the perceiving. There is obsessive love and guilty love as well as fraternal affection and parental/surrogate love.
The cinematography is no less than exquisite, as is the use of color. The film is touching and unpredictable; the performances are wonderful across the board, including a supporting role splendidly handled by Geraldine Chaplin. What is striking is Almodovar's affection for the characters, despite their flaws and weaknesses. The humor is never at anyone's expense, never cruel. The pain evidenced by the characters is almost matter-of-fact in its presentation--randomly terrible things happen and somehow the survivors must go on.
There are some extraordinary moments, one of the most notable being a remarkable affecting performance of ""Cucurrucucu Paloma"" by Brazilian actor, singer, director Caetan Veloso. The soundtrack ranks as a cast member, so vital is it to the integrity of the film.
Finally, satisfyingly, the film ends on an optimistic note with more underlayers--of sadness, loss and hope. Intelligent and thoughtful, Talk To Her is a singular accomplishment.

Talk To Her is a story about the friendship between two men, about loneliness and the long convalescence of the wounds provoked by passion. It is also a film about incommunication between couples, and about communication. About cinema as a subject of conversation. About how monologues before a silent person can be an effective form of dialogue. About silence as ""eloquence of the body"", about film as an ideal vehicle in relationships between people, about how a film told in words can bring time to a standstill and install itself in the lives of the person telling it and the person listening.
Talk To Her is a film about the joy of narration and about words as a weapon against solitude, disease, death and madness. It is also a film about madness, about a type of madness so close to tenderness and common sense that it does not diverge from normality.",1047945600,3,1290,4.588744588744588

1500435,5,B00005JLQW,"I've seen several Pedro Almodovar films and been amazed by his amazing ability behind the camera and also the development of the stories around his characters.  The greatest mark of a director, of good film is when people don't appear to be acting but instead as if the watcher feels like they're watching someones life unfold.
Lydia (Rosario Florees) a female bullfighter, gets mauled and this leaves her in a coma. Her new boyfriend Mauricio losyti n what to do, stays with her though he knows her situation may be terminal.  Then he accidentally spots a nurse, Benigno, taking care of Alicia, in a coma as well.  There's a game of attarction between the four lead people in this film because Mauricio and Benigno are so genuinely in love with the women and eventually they literally fall in love with the other's capacity to love.  When confronted about his sexuality, Benigno opts to be homosexual so that Alicia's father, a psychiatrist he saw once while secretly stalking Alicia, won't suspect him as the obsessive he so obviously is.
THe movie, set up literally in neurosis and to some degree psychosis, lensed through love goes even further as Alicia, literally pops up, pregnant.  And Benigno's loving devotion starts looking a little too devoted.  Eventually mauricio discovers that Lydia is ""cheating"" on him.  She reunited with a lover the day of her mauling who now sits by her side, so he's been replaced.  The funniest, most warped scenes are when Lydia and Alicia are propped up in chairs next to each other for visits and sunbathing and Mauricio and Benigno talk both over them and to them.  Benigno has perfected the art of
""hearing"" Alicia and tries to train Mauricio until scandal erupts with the pregnancy.
Mauricio's devotion to Benigno is touching and even Benigno explains that in order to be visited in prison he had to tell the officials that Mauricio is his lover.  Their sympathy deepens into both understanding and friendship in a way that we see Benigno's sexuality has just never been explored by a living person and Mauricio's capacity to love is greater than his masculine ego about his sexuality.  To some degree there's this huge question of whether or not this whole mess has co me about to bring the two men together, one man who's always wanted to be devoted to someone living but has settled for his dying mother and then the comatose Alicia, people who can't reject him until he finds someone who loves him, whackiness and all.
I think there comes a point when we all love someone who we can love, regardless of gender, and the body no longer matters.  There's a high degree of spirtuality at play in this movie, particularly about love and simply loving someone, being availible to loving someone.  There's a couple of twists in the last third of the movie that veer sharply from where this seems like it may go and begins a whole new chapter, a new story between Mauricio and Alicia, which is startling and at the same time suggests that everything before was an attempt to get to that point.
A stupendous film because of a great story, as the best movies always are.",1047340800,3,3109,4.724584103512015
1500436,5,B00005JLQW,"One of Spanish director Pedro Almodovar's most skillfully directed, richly textured films. He's still exploring uncomfortable, unconventional behavior, and taken on its surface level,  the plot may creep a lot of people out, but you gotta admire the sheer filmmaking beauty of it all, and the classiness of a European perspective that includes dancer Pina Bausch alongside a moody female toreador.
For me, one of the most pleasant twists was Almodovar's inclusion of a healthy dose of the best music from Brazil, including a glorious live version of ""Cucurrucucu Paloma"" by Caetano Veloso... as charming and transcendent a performance as you could ever ask for. Okay, so now a bunch of people are wondering which Caetano albums to buy that sound similar in tone to that song. Off the top of my head, I'd recommend acoustically-oriented records such as 1975's ""Coisa"" and ""Joia,"" and particularly the more recent European concert album, ""Omaggio A Federico E Guilietta,"" which features Caetano playing with pretty much the same ensemble as seen in the film, and has the same subtle cultural spendor. It also features avant-pop cellist Jacques Morelenbaum, who has been Caetano's bandleader for the last decade or so. They're all favorites of mine, and hopefully of your's as well!",1046908800,,1279,5.178743961352657
1500437,5,B00005JLQW,"You could spend hours on end talking about Almodovar's art, the result of a work that has evolved from some more-sexually loaded works back in the seventies and eighties to his more mature and hilarious works from the past decade. Starting with ""La Flor de mi Secreto"" in 1995, you start to see a trend in his work. With the help of some of today's greatest Spanish-speaking stars, such as Marisa Paredes, Penlope Cruz, Javier Bardem, Cecilia Roth and this time around, the brilliant Argentinian star from ""El Lado Oscuro del Corazon"" Daro Grandinetti, charming Leonor Watling, the sexy Spanish singer Rosario Flores and most-peculiar Javier Cmara, Almodovar is on a trip to the unknown to tell the stories flowing from his heart, from his childhood, his forbidden places...
The plot was beautifully summed up by a reviewer on another site with these words: ""Marco [Grandinetti] is Sancho to Benigno's [Cmara's] Quixote, and as Benigno's hopes for his patient [he plays a male nurse] become fantasies, Marco tries to inject reality."" As hipnotizing the movie can result there's more to it than a brilliant storyline: direction is impeccable (as usual with Almodovar), filled with details to embellish the story; the music is... well, what else can be said about Alberto Iglesias, Almodovar's long time scorer? This is his most brilliant accomplishment so far!
The best advise I can give you is, get up, grab your keys and shoot for a theater that is playing it: you will laugh, you will cry and you will come back home craving for more. Be in the look for his next work, ""La Mala Educacion"" where he brings along Gael Garca Bernal, the young star from ""Amores Perros"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"". This is what happens with Almodovar: once you get started with his movies, you can't get enough of them. You need more!",1046736000,7,1812,4.829581993569132

See this film if you cherish screenplays, direction, ensemble acting, cinematography, editing, and music that are no less than brilliant.  It is Almodovar's best.  He has composed a masterpiece that immensely satisfies both one's left and right brains.

1500547,5,B00005JLQW,"In ""Talk to her"" Benigno is the fatty, strange, effeminate nurse in charge of taking care of Alicia, who is in a coma for the last four years. Marco is the reporter who falls in love with Lidia, the ""torera"" who got struck by a bull and is also in a coma.
Benigno and Marco meet for the first time watching a play. Benigno  notices how emotive Marco is, and comments the fact with a fellow nurse. Months later, they meet again in the hospital where Alicia and Lidia are interned, and start a friendship based on the fate of the two women.
Even if he's emotive, Marco can't understand why Beningno constantly talks to Alicia, even if she is not able to listen. Marco won't talk to Lidia, not even when Beningno says: ""Talk to her. It will do you both good.""
This is a good film, but, based on all the hype, and on what everybody else is saying about ""Talk to her"", I though it was going to be better. Almodovar once again concentrates the main theme of his movie on women, and they are the strongest part of the story, even being both in a coma. Everything revolves around  them. ""Talk to her"" is a big drama, with some funny moments, but a big undisguised drama nonetheless. There are no revolutionary direction techniques, the acting is good, but plain, and the sound score is boring.
The best thing about ""Hable con ella"" is that you leave the movie in a ""thinking mood"". You keep thinking about what would you do if you were Benigno, or Marco; you keep wondering if what they have done is right, under the circumstances, or just plainly condemnable.
I thing Almodovar has made better films than this one, like ""Carne tremula"" (Live flesh) or ""Ata-me"" (Tie me up, tie me down).

1500548,4,B00005JLQW,"The plot of the new Pedro Almodovar film, ""Talk to Her,"" sounds a lot like the setup for a really long, really bad joke.
  It's about a male nurse, a writer, a ballerina and a bullfighter named Lydia, and the ballerina and the bullfighter are both in a coma during much of the movie.
  But ""Talk to Her,"" although it has an unusual premise and moments of great humor, is not a long, bad joke; it is, in fact, one of the most moving and satisfying films of the last year.
  The nurse, Benigno (Javier Camara), is pudgy, plain-faced and perhaps a little too friendly to fully trust. Day after day, he carefully dotes on Alicia (Leonor Watling), a dancer who was thrown into a coma by a car accident.
  In a bed down the hospital hall, Lydia - who has been critically injured by a bull - is watched by a travel writer, Marco (Dario Grandinetti). Marco loves Lydia but as her condition fails to improve, his sense of despair increases.
  ""Talk to her,"" advises Benigno as the two form an awkward friendship.
  ""Her brain has been turned off,"" Marco tells him.
  ""How are you so sure?"" asks Benigno. ""A woman's brain is a mystery, and in this state even more so.""
  But Benigno often has the ability to sound wiser than he actually is, and Marco's realization of this fact makes up much of the film's drama.
  Spanish director Almodovar (who, on Tuesday, was nominated for an Oscar for directing ""Talk to Her"") loves to build movies from disparate elements: his plots, structure and style often seem borrowed from soap operas and 1950s melodramas, but his characters, and the situations they find themselves in, are decidedly edgier stuff.
  His best known film, ""Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down,"" is at heart an old-fashioned romance which just happens to occur between an escaped mental patient and an adult film star; the mother in ""All About My Mother"" (for which Almodovar won the 2000 Oscar for best foreign film) is actually a drag queen who has fathered a child with a nun.
  ""Talk to Her,"" while slightly tamer, is still a racy outing, and it isn't going to be everybody's cup of tea. But moviegoers who are looking for an unconventional story and don't mind flawed characters will enjoy some amazing scenes: A lovely, musical dream sequence; a series of shots in which Marco helps Lydia into her bullfighter's outfit; a bizarre and severely bawdy silent film imagined by Benigno; and a surprisingly happy ending that seems to come out of nowhere but, in retrospect, makes perfect sense.
  Prior to making this film, Almodovar lobbied to direct an adaptation of Michael Cunningham's novel, ""The Hours,"" and was rejected. Clearly, the book remains on his mind - a copy of it can be seen on Marco's bedside table. As fate would have it, on Oscar night Almodovar will be competing against Stephen Daldry, the director who eventually wound up bringing ""The Hours"" to the screen. It's ironic that, from Almodovar's frustration, came ""Talk to Her,"" a movie that's not only better than ""The Hours"" but one of the best movies the gifted director has ever made.",1045267200,,3047,4.652336448598131
1500549,5,B00005JLQW,"This is one bizarre, unique, and unforgettable film. The plot is fairly simple, yet richly engrossing: Two men are in love with women who can't hear them; each woman is in a coma, and their stories told in flashback.
Marco (Dario Grandinetti), a journalist, falls hard for a lady bullfighter, Lydia (Rosario Flores, so alive she seems to leap off the screen), who is gored in the ring. At the hospital where Lydia lies comatose, Marco meets Benigno (Javier Camara), a male nurse who takes special care of Alicia (Leonor Watling), a gorgeous ballerina who fell into a coma after a car accident four years earlier.
It's the unlikely friendship between these two men that gives the movie focus. Benigno tells Marco that talk is essential to these motionless women. Maybe, inside, they hear and understand. When one of the women becomes the victim of a crime, the film lurches into dark corners of the mind that Almod-var navigates with uncanny skill and passionate heart. The actors are outstanding, illuminating four different views of loneliness.
The film moves slowly and deliberately, remaining captivating from the moving dance performance at the beginning to the devastating conclusion. Rich in detail, and ingenius in its excecution, this is definitely one of the most unique films of the year. A definite must-see for anyone even remotely serious about movies.",1044230400,,1365,5.071111111111111
1500550,5,B00005JLQW,"Pedro Almodovar is indeed a director who betters from film to film. At least in recent years; his previous effort ""All About My Mother"" achieved much, including Best Foreign Film Oscar, but I dare say ""Talk to Her"" is even better.
In Slovakia, where I live, the poster to this film blared: ""The Most Beautiful Film of the Year"". I think this time the posters were not far from the truth.
You really do not have to know the synopsis before you watch it. Almodovar's films are not too interesting based solely on ""what's going on in there"". But his treatment is unique and his directing, I believe, could make a class-act even from a poor idea.
On the other hand, characters and their stories in Almodovar's films are so unique and hard to repeat that it makes them unforgettable. The same applies to two men and two women starring in ""Talk to Her"". It's enough for you to know the film is basically about two men taking care of two comatose women in a hospital. Both men are different from one another, but somehow the 'crazy' one teaches the 'normal' one something important about life...
As always, acting is immaculate, but also from supporting actors. You cannot help but smile while watching the rude TV reporter interviewing toreador Lydia about her love life at the beginning, or witness ballet teacher (Geraldine Chaplin) asking Benigno things about art. But the most endearing is the common janitor, firing criticism on the media people in coversation with Marco.
All kinds of emotions may surface while viewing this masterpiece, which is helped by brilliant score by Alberto Iglesias -- graceful, dominated by guitar and strings. The end of the film, rather satisfying in itself, is enhanced by wonderful use of English composer Henry Purcell's baroque motive.
The best European film of 2002 is really worth seeing. Its poetry, colours and humour will touch you in unexpected ways.",1043280000,,1890,4.83641975308642
1500551,5,B00005JLQW,"Spaniard Pedro Almodovar's unforgettable takes on the human condition have ranged from the ribald (""Labrynth of Passion"") to powerfully heartfelt (""All About My Mother"").  In between he's become his own cinematic genre.  From women on the verge of nervous breakdowns to women daring to reveal the flower of their secrets, Almodovar is one of the few filmmakers that can spawn a wave of eager anticipation at the box office with each new effort.  TALK TO HER  is built to engage the heart and mind -- becoming of one of Almodovar's best efforts in the process.
A quirky tale of friendship and fidelity, TALK TO HER chronicles the lives of two couples.  The catch -- both women in each union are in comas.  The focus of the story captures the patient waiting game of the two men: A nurse who has given his life to caring for a young dancer.  A journalist who has been seduced by a female bullfighter.  The two men forge a unique friendship with the journalist seduced anew by the nurse, whose unconditional love for the dancer offers a beacon of hope for his sleeping bullfighter.
Of course, this being the world of Almodovar, men coming to grips with their emotions and sensitivity never results in an easy resolution.  While both men find the ability to talk to their women with incredible honesty and selflessness, love turns to obsession for one, leading to tragic circumstances.
What makes TALK TO HER such compelling entertainment is its quartet of characters.  Both Dario Grandinetti (the journalist) and especially, Javier Camara (the nurse) deliver emotionally authentic performances.  As the film becomes a darker experience, neither men cause the audience to lose their empathy.  Rosario Flores' bullfighter is also remarkable, an earthy temptress that is as strong as she is insecure in her own passion.
From its lushly evocative score by Alberto Iglesias to the the classy sheen of the film's cinematography, TALK TO HER finds the director at his peak.  At the same time, this is challenging stuff.  Almodovar deflty handles the comedic and emotional ties with considerable grace, never sacrificing one for the other with banalities.  (A high point is watching Caetano Veloso sing the classic ""Cucurrucucu Paloma"" in a flashback sequence that is beautiful). It is by far his most assured effort as a director and writer.  While fans of the outrageous Almodovar past may quibble about his latest forays into more mainstream efforts, his skewed world view is very much intact.  Witness the now infamous short film near the end of the film, an erotic encounter that defies description.  With so much ink spilled on how Almodovar's women are the cornerstone of his art, having him essay such compelling male characters for the first time since ""Law of Desire"" is another key example of the director's ability to evolve as an artist.
You may find yourself questioning the narrative at some point, but it is a richly layered film that commands attention and plenty of talk once the end credits roll.  One of the year's best in any language.",1042588800,7,3045,4.923679060665362

I loved All About My Mother, Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, and The Flower of My Secret, but Talk to Her blew me away.  I stared at the screen even as the credits were rolling, mesmerized and wanting more.  You grow to love the characters and feel what they're feeling.

Whereas in the past his concerns have been almost exclusively with a woman's mindset as in ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" or ""All About My Mother,"" ""Talk to Her"" is about men and their inability to communicate, open up to their loved ones. Of course, being that Almodovar is a Spaniard, Machismo plays a big part in the world in which he lives, but here he is looking for the Universal; the things that bind us all together as Mankind. And what would seem a pretty basic theme in most directors' hands becomes in Almodovar's, a difficult, sympathetic and plaintive treatise rife with complexity and turmoil. Almodovar is never out for the easy fix. As one of the leads (Benigno played by Jose Camara), who has no problem showing his emotions, says to his counterpart (Marco played by Dario Grandinetti):""Talk to her...a woman's likes to feel that she is cared for and cherished."" (paraphrase)
As sometimes happens in life, these two disparate men become friends; the one coaching the other on the ways and means of understanding how to deal with what is not only in front of our eyes but also what is out there in the cosmos.
Almodovar's world is usually a hard candy colored world of zany characters, blatant sexuality and pure fun, but in ""Talk to Her,"" as in ""All about my Mother"" his palette is subdued, his mise-en-scene still and quiet.

Almodovar's stunning new film is a poignant masterwork that even exceeds his great ""All About My Mother"" as an emotional tour de force.  Incisive and witty, despairing yet brimming with life, this ranks as the director's greatest departure from his canon of crazy characters and slapstick broad humor.  Here, a gentle quiet settles over the characters right off the bat, with a dance of death that sets the stage for the pure pathos and ironies that follow.  he central characters meet at the outset (but don't, really until later)while watching a ballet, and their lives intertwine in unexpected, yet utterly real ways.  To be sure, there's the usual shock-value of Almodovar's unique worldview, where everything seems upside down, and yet always logical, as if all our existences were being played out on screen despite the obvious distances that exist between we the audience and the characters we come to love.  And here, unlike in the great majority of his classic films, the filmmaker focuses on men whose lives are utterly up-ended by dramatic encounters with the women they love.
There are parts of the film that will take your breath away - a silent film sequence where a shrinking man literally walks into a sleeping woman (a visually stunning interlude that doesn't make much sense when it happens, but ultimately becomes a crucial plot device) and a plaintive wail sung by Celetano Veloso midway through that will literally bring tears to your eyes.  The actors are terrific, the dialogue sharp and refreshing, the images visually deep and rich.  Segovia's landscapes are metaphors for each man's loneliness while the silence of their respective women (both in comas for most of the movie) is a heartbreaking, nearly deafening noise.  Almodovar captures more with simple twists of fate than most directors can manage in an entire film, and ""Talk to Her"" proves once again that he is a master of cinema - one of the truly great directors of our day.

Convencionalism has never been the word to define any film from Almodvar. All of them are unique, and &#145;Talk to Her&#146; makes no exception. Men who cry, a woman who bullfights --everything is unusual in Almodvar&#146;s world, but, at the same time, simple. This time, instead of telling a story of women, the director brings two men to the central stage, and their beloved women spend most of the time lying in a hospital bed.
 It all begins when Marco (Daro Gradinetti), a writer, and Benigno (Javier Camara), a nurse, are watching a show. Despite being side by side they don&#146;t notice each other. Later on, life will bring these two men togheter. Benigno works in a hospital as a private nurse for a ballerina (Leonor Watling) who&#146;s been in a comatose for years.  Marco&#146;s lover, a female matador, checks in at the same hospital, after being wounded by a bull.
Against all odds, the two become friends. Being  more experienced in nursing, Benigno tells Marco that if he talks to his beloved while she is sleeping that may help her in the healing process --hence the title.  Day after day, they meet at the hospital, and spend time togheter, they even pair up their girls in the balcony for a sunbath. But a twist in the story may jeopardize this friendship.
At first this movie seems to be very different from Almodovar&#146;s previous works. And it is. At this time, he is less kitsch,  and less hysterical, but still profund and poetic. Women may not play the major roles --as they usually do-- but their universe guides the whole movie.  At a point, Benigno says something that only Alomodvar could conceive: &#147;The women&#146;s brain is a mistery.&#148;
&#147;Talk to Her&#148; is Almodvar at his best, in the apex of his carrer. It is moviemaking at perfection. It is a brainy and heartfelt movie, in times when aliens and explosions tend to rule the screen. Pay attention to a black & white silent little movie that Benigno tells to his ballerina. And keep your ears to open Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso singing during a scene; and for Tom Jobim and Elis Regina&#146;s song Por Toda a Minha Vida.

1500654,5,B00005JLQW,"Universally acclaimed, openly gay and proud Spanish director Pedro Almodovar isn't afraid to shock his audience.  When you watch an Almodovar movie, you can almost picture the inimitable movie-maker smiling wickedly while thinking about the audience's reaction when they see his outrageous characters and the improbable situations that those characters find themselves in.  In his first feature film, 1980's ""Pepi, Luci, Bom"", a mousy housewife enters into a sado-masochistic relationship with a lesbian punk rock star, initiated with a ""watersports"" scene.  In ""Law of Desire"" (1987), my favorite Almodovar movie, we learn that the voluptuous female character Tina used to be a man (!), and had a sex-change operation to please her lover-- who happened to be her own father!  And in ""Kika"" (1993), a prison escapee frenetically rapes the titular heroine, and a dab of the rapist's, uhm... seed, falls from the balcony on to the face of an obnoxious talk show hostess on the street.
  And so we enter the wild, whacky world of Pedro Almodovar, where the director reigns over a kingdom of fabulously quirky, colorful characters.  In Almodovar's movies, let's just say that things happen that, well, just don't happen to ordinary people.  Throughout the '80's and early '90's, when characters with any kind of ""alternate"" sexual identity or orientation were all but invisible in American cinema, Almodovar's movies almost always featured gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered, and/or transvestite characters.  It's no mystery why his movies have been cult favorites in the U.S. for years, especially among gay and lesbian audiences.  Sure, there were lots of straight characters in Almodovar's movies as well, but they were no less outrageous.  Pedro Almodovar first became well-known to American audiences with 1988's ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" (nominated for ""Best Foreign Film"" Oscar and Golden Globe; Winner of ""Best Foreign Film"" by the New York's Critics Circle) and 1989's bondage-flavored love story ""Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!"".  In 1999, the filmmaker who made his name in the film world by breaking all the rules earned his most ""mainstream"" accolades to date with ""All About My Mother"".  Almodovar received no less than 24 international awards for the movie, which received both ""Best Foreign Language Film"" Oscar and Golden Globe.  When he accepted his Oscar, presented by fellow Spanish imports Penelope Cruz and Antonio Banderas, he cemented his stauts in American pop culture when audiences watched an emotional Almodovar consumed in pure joy-- truly a life-affirming sight and an inspiration to future filmmakers.  Almodovar's older films, most of them available on VHS or DVD, are musts for all serious GLBT cinema-philes.  And for all you trogs out there who wouldn't consider watching a movie with subtitles... well, then you'll just have to learn Spanish.
  ""Talk To Her"" (""Hable Con Ella"") is a drama with comedic touches.  The story is about the friendship that evolves between two men who meet by chance: Benigno (Javier Camara), a young, non-threatening-looking nurse, and Marco (Dario Grandinetti), a rugged-looking writer in his early 40's.  Benigno originally notices Marco in the theater, but doesn't yet speak to him.  Months later, Marco's girlfriend Lydia (Rosario Flores), a bullfighter, is seriously injured and falls into a coma.  She is transported to the clinic where Benigno works.  At the clinic, Benigno is taking care of Alicia (Leonor Watling), another young woman who has been in a coma for four years.  Through flashbacks, we learn more about the relationship between Marco and Lydia, and we learn about the circumstances in which Benigno wound up caring for Alicia.  As the movie progresses, the bond between the two men becomes stronger-- especially when Lydia eventually passes away.  It's at this point in the film when the plot takes a VERY strange turn-- which, while jaw-dropping, is believable only because Almodovar has perfectly developed the feelings and the motivations of the characters in ""Talk To Her"", particularly the two male leads, and then allows the audience into the characters' minds. In addition, the acting by all the major characters is flawless:  At face value, the audience thinks that they have everything ""figured out"", only to slowly see the characters in ""Talk To Her"" revealed in a more complicated web of human emotions, including joy, love, sadness, and loneliness.  Gender and sexual orientation isues are explored too: Benigno is straight, but pretends that he's gay so that he can continue to care for Alicia without suspicion by her father.  Lydia is a female bullfighter, used to having to prove herself as an equal in a male-dominated sport.  Yet her sensitive, vulnerable side is never neglected by the director.  Almodovar doesn't hesitate to show us an axiom of human nature often missing in American cinema: that MEN, like women, can actually have feelings, be vulnerable, and yes, Virginia, even cry.
  Pedro Almodovar has definitely ""matured"" as a filmmaker, but he hasn't abandoned his raunchy, racy side.  Now more than ever, Almodovar manages to expertly blend barrier-breaking humor with real human emotions and characterizations.  In a bold cinematic move, within ""Talk To Her"" is an outrageous film-within-a-film-- a seven minute, black-and-white, science-fiction-inspired silent film ""Amante Menguante"" (""Shrinking Lover""), which tells the story of an overweight scientist whose attempt at a diet formula runs amok. He shrinks... and shrinks... and shrinks.  Worried about not being able to please his girlfriend, he finds a new way to become, uhm... ""intimate"" with her... (And I'm not saying another word!)
  For those of us American cinema-lovers who are starved for original stories, Pedro Almodovar is proof that sometimes, we simply need to look across the ocean.  And if you look really closely, you may see Almodovar with a wicked smile... because he knows that with ""Talk To Her"", he's once again pleased moviegoers.",1033689600,19,6035,5.279581151832461
1500655,5,B00005JLQW,"As a middle easten woman , I ve found this movie stuning, the emotions it showed crosses all borders and languages, quiet few writers would venture in tackling a subject that deals mostly with men feelings ( quiet difficult to analyse) we were conditioned through the history of movie making to see women feelings explained and analysed and men's reactions towards them, this movie changed things upside down, this is the best movie for Almodavar. It is the kind of movies that doesn't leave you intakt after watching it.",1031702400,4,521,4.865168539325842

7940119,5,B00005JLQW,"I recently discovered Pedro Almodovar. I love, love his movies! In this one there is an unlikely but totally believable swapping of partners. Parts of the movie have surrealism, and ballet and bullfighting features prominently in the story line, as well as ill fated lovers, suicide, and happily ever afters.

What most affected and impressed me was the poignant relationship of one young man to a woman, and his simple plaintive advice to his male friend, ""Talk to her!"" Yes, it would be such a better world if men would really talk from the heart, patiently, and with loving attentiveness to women.",1488412800,2,600,4.882352941176471
