8556596,5,B00AQSMXCO,"Every time I see a documentary about the Holocaust I ask myself ""why/how did this happen? How could people be so evil and not think what they were doing was wrong?""
A gripping, real documentary that holds back nothing.  It tells the truth and has the evidence to prove it. It does not badger you but it is serious and humbling.",1501286400,,327,4.360655737704918

8556598,5,B00AQSMXCO,"A very good and well produced HISTORY CHANNEL DVD documentary about the Holocaust and how it all happened.  The six steps it took to actually to get to the point of murder. . . it didn't just happen from whole cloth it took trial and error.  This documentary uses interviews, images, and artifacts that are great aids to the viewer to better understand the Holocaust.  Would not recommend this for young viewers, or at least without an adult in the room.  It would be okay for college age kids followed by a discussion of the video.",1408579200,,532,4.510416666666667
8556599,5,B00AQSMXCO,I watched the show on the History Channel several times and hoped to get the DVD and my wish came true. The DVD added extra to the show that was not on TV as to what happened to key people of the Holocaust.,1408492800,,206,3.813953488372093
