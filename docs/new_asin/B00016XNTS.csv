With a lot of twists and turns
And not knowing what happens next.",1442275200,,91,3.8421052631578947
8007557,2,B00016XNTS,"The idea of a virtual being raises all kinds of interesting philosophical problems.  These problems are addressed, but in a very half hearted way.  Sex predominates as a theme, with a little bit of marital discord thrown in.",1380240000,2,224,4.868421052631579

8007559,1,B00016XNTS,"Charlie Curtis plays the computer virtual game that gains sentience and begins killing off boyfriends both in and out of her virtual world.  Despite killing two people at the beginning of the movie, the company obliviously continues developing the program.  There's no police invest, no reality in the movie itself (a computer program that can remotely stop brakes from working? -- yeah, right).

Pretty bad, cheesy special effects, even for the time.  Lots of female nudity, its only redeeming quality, but no story really.

Softcore porn at its finest.  Charlie Curtis has also appeared on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, per IMDB.

Awful film.  Not recommended.

Awful movie.  Subscribe to Playboy instead.",1244937600,2,705,5.214285714285714
8007560,2,B00016XNTS,"A computer programmer finds himself the victim of a sex stalker while working on an interactive cyber-erotic program known as VIRTUAL GIRL. This occurred when the program became self aware, and the computer generated femme fatale decides to pursue her new love interest. The film is certainly interesting even though it pales by comparison to many other Sci-Fi outings from this period, (1999). The effects while a little tired looking are at least still presentable though a couple of scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor. The launch of the program and the player's journey into her cyber-world were credible and held one's interest. This was not like Sly STALLONE's foray into cyber-sex in DEMOLITION MAN. Although VIRTUAL GIRL employs some of the same equipment, (head gear), there is also additional apparatus and the journey into the cyber-erotic world was detailed rather convincingly. While the script was predictable it did reveal some interesting twists, though not enough to pull the film out of the sea of mediocrity. Of note, however, is that female lead Charlie CURTIS did a stellar job, though spotty performances by others marred the finished product. This is NOT a pornographic film, and as such, the sexuality presented generally fell within a broad range of acceptable parameters. I would love to see this one remade using a bigger budget, (while retaining CURTIS). On a final note, the box art is NOT misleading as it accurately depicts some of the imagery presented in the film. VIRTUAL GIRL is an interesting experience, though I would suggest renting it first. Two and 1/2 stars, (**1/2), out of Five.",1236556800,6,1641,5.059040590405904
8007561,4,B00016XNTS,"Charlie Curtis is unbelievably H.O.T.  I'm surfing for more movies that she might have been in.  The movie certainly wouldn't win an Academy Award, but it was entertaining.  Did I mention that Charlie  Curtis is hot?!",1093824000,,217,4.944444444444445
