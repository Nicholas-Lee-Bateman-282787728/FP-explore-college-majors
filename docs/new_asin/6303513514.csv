7851600,1,6303513514,"This movie is crud to the 8th power. The story is stupid,even for a kids film. The animation is choppy. 99.9% of the songs are awful. The cast is forgettable at best. The only GOOD song is Evilmania but since this is the USA version,it had to be edited because some of the moments in said song were too awful to show to little kids. So even that is ruined. FYI:you can see and/or hear the full verison on YouTube. Just type ""Freddie as F.R.O.7"" or ""Evilmania"" on it and you can find said song. I give this film a 1 out of 10.",1334188800,,525,4.0576923076923075
7851601,1,6303513514,"Alright. I'm not sure exactly where to begin with this utter disgrace  so I'll begin in chronological order.

The setting  is at first in medieval times. Prince Fredrick, who is blessed with magical abilities  lives happily with his father the king and his mysterious aunt Mesima , a powerful sorceress. One day while on a ride through the enchanted forest, The king's horse is spooked by a serpent and rears up, causing him to fall and die. Fredrick eventually realizes that it was his aunt who killed his father. She intends to do the same to fredrick so she can rule the kingdom but ends up turning him into a frog instead. He swims away and meets the Loch ness monster briefly.

That is as far as sense exists in this story.

We are then told that Fredrick(now a full-grown frog) used His his powers to travel through time  and became a secret agent named FRO7 in the United Kingdom.

WHAT THE HECK!!!? I mean if he could travel through time all that time (not a single pun intended)  shouldn't his first inclination have been to travel bacwards  in time and Oh, I don't know... STOP HIS FATHER FROM BEING KILLED BY HIS AUNT???!!!.  Or at least  stop her from turning him into a frog???!

But no.

FRO7 is put on a case to stop a villan alongside his two human  companions Deffers  and Scottie. The Reason? All of the world's  Monuments have been dissappearing. The eiffel tower, statue of liberty ect. Beamed up to the sky. To solve the mystery Freddie and the others decide to hid in Big Bem.  The plan works and  it is discovered that his aunt Mesima is behind this also. Her goal? to take over the world.

THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE ANY SENSE!! WE ARE ONLY TOLD  THAT  FREDRICK TRAVELS FORWARD THROUGH TIME, NOT HIS AUNT. AND QUITE FRANKLY HOW THE HECK IS STEALING THE WORLD'S MONUMENTS GOING TO HELP YOU RULLE THE WORLD??!!!.

The latter question was technically answered by a long tedious explanation given by an ugly, fat, snake-looking man who started ranting about Freddie's Forefathers and how the symbols of their accomplishments would be gone along with his history when the nonuments were taken. Forgive me but I'm pretty sure the french bloodline doesn't exist in EVERY person in the world and Furthermore It didn't make sense after he explained it.

So what happens eventually? They take all the monuments. Everyone in the world falls asleep.

But with a little help from his old  friend the Lochness monster (HEAVEN KNOWS HOW A SCOTTISH MONSTER GOT TO THE UNITED KINGDOM) they stop fredrick's  Aunt and make everything right.

THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE WORST MOVIE IN THE UNIVERSE. THE PEOPLE THAT MADE IT SHOULD BE FIRED FROM MAKING ANIMATED FILMS AND BE PUT TO WORK DONG ANYTHING BUT THAT!!",1307664000,2,2710,4.612970711297071
7851602,5,6303513514,"This movie was one of my favorite movies as a kid and i used to watch it constantly. know i am able to share the film with my nieces and nephews. the animation and acting are a bit dated by today's standards but it is still good. the film has some parts were there is alot of talking which is when little kids may start to lose intrest in it, but it quickly picks up. my niece who is 4 Loved the film when i watched it with her and she was able to keep attention throught the whole film.",1275177600,,487,3.88
7851603,3,6303513514,"I remember seeing this movie when I was very young, and while it's not the best animated film I've ever seen, it's certainly not the worst. The animation is satisfactory, and Freddie IS rather handsome and charming for a frog. Everyone has their own opinion about this film, of course, but maybe you negative critics out there are being just a wee bit too harsh. There are movies out there that are far worse than this one, you know.",1157932800,3,433,4.493670886075949
7851604,5,6303513514,Our daughter Chase is three years old.  We have rented this video from the video store so many times that we could have owned about 3 copies.  We finally decided to buy one when she walked in the store the other day and knew exactly where it was located.  She has assured us it is a 5 star movie.,997488000,4,296,3.983050847457627
