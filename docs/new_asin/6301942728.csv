385814,5,6301942728,Great Movie.,1507420800,,12,5.5
385815,5,6301942728,"Pacific heights is a disturbing film. It tells us what so narrow may be the boundary between your expectations and your dissapointments. It's about the no sense of the legal fisures between a tenant and the owner of the property. It's about the funest consequences the ""butterfly effect"" makes its apperance (when the initial proposal of the contract simply doesn't come to its destiny); it's about the merciless study of the sociopathy and the pestilence of certain human beings.

John Schlesinger is the famous director of Midnight Cowboy - one of the most legendary films awarded by the Academy (probably the most devastating and relentless portrait - without leaving aside Scarecrows - of two losers in NYC). so, given the artistic stature of this director, it shouldn't surprise us the level of the subtlest implications of this complex script.

Arguably, a masterpiece all the way through (In my personal selections of the twenty best male performances decade by decade Michael Keaton is included in this selected list).

Go for it. It will capture you from the initial shot. Don't miss this timeless film.",1501286400,,1112,5.065573770491803
385816,1,6301942728,"A movie that starts well enough, with Michael Keaton as the tenant from hell who is bankrupting his landlords, but the ending is so jejune and disorganized that you feel you've watched two hours of pure silliness.",1501027200,,213,4.783783783783784
385817,5,6301942728,"I finally watched the whole movie the other day on TV. My mother always liked this thriller from watching years ago, and I see why. It reminds me of a Hitchcock thriller. I love thrillers, so suspenseful, and thought-provoking from beginning to end. Well casted, and it was neat seeing Melanie Griffith's mom in a scene!! (Tippi Hedren). I highly recommend if you like thrillers, and definitely a learning lesson for new landlords, do background check and be informed of the law in the state you live in for new tenants. This could happen to anyone and it was shocking to see the destruction a con-artist can do!!",1495497600,,613,4.685185185185185

385822,3,6301942728,Unintentionally laughable at times. Pulling pranks with roaches and turning off the heat are just weak ideas for a thriller. Is this a Saved by the Bell episode?  I always enjoy Keaton but he wasn't in it that much. Mathew Modine isn't a strong lead and Griffith doesn't do anything for me. Directing isn't suspenseful either.  Not a bad premise for the times but not a stellar movie that holds up like others from the era.,1488844800,,423,4.552631578947368

385977,3,6301942728,"This is a thriller worth watching. I have only one issue , for most movies I've got no problem suspending disbelief for crazy action or over the top plots but its alot to ask in this case.sorta Spoiler* since everything Hayes does is illegal and he'd be gone so fast his head would spin. No movie no suspense. But other than that its a pretty taught suspense film",1456272000,,363,4.352941176470588

385980,4,6301942728,"Unmarried couple, Drake Goodman and Patty Palmer have just purchased an expensive 19th century, polychrome house in the opulent neighborhood, Pacific Heights of San Francisco. They rent one of the house's 2 apartments on the first floor and immediately look for a tenant for the first floor of their apartment.

They end up coming across Carter Hayes, a seemingly good guy with lots of cash and drives an expensive car, who expresses a deep desire to move in but is reluctant to complete a credit check. He manages to convince Drake to waive the credit check where he'll instead give him a list of personal references in addition to an upfront payment for the first 6 months' rent via bank transfer.

Drake seemingly reluctantly agrees. But before any of the money can be paid, Carter one day arrives unannounced and forces himself into the apartment, locking himself inside. A series of horrible happenings follow and Drake and Patty will soon come to the realization that they have blindly let a swindling, calculating sociopath into their lives. When Drake tries to take charge, Hayes is always seemingly one step ahead. Drake and Patty must now fight for everything they have or risk losing it all to this sick madman

Overall: The plot for this film is really good but at many times often fails in using logic. I won't give any examples as not to necessarily give away any specific scenes from the movie, but logic isn't necessarily a big factor in this. Another reason this movie is well done is because it plays up a dirty situation that could actually happen in real life. Pacific Heights has its thrills and chills and would you expect a film to have anything less when you have one of films' ultimate villainous creeps, Michael Keaton as the main antagonist? Despite the rousing and at times chilling atmosphere the movie brings, it does have somewhat of a slow build up. Overall, this is definitely up for a watch and a treat if you're a fan of Michael Keaton filmography or 90s thriller films",1451174400,,2004,4.736389684813753
385981,3,6301942728,"Not as good as I remember it to be.

385986,3,6301942728,"M. Keaton is a childhood favorite every since my dad used to put Night Shift with Henry Winkler on the VHS tape in L. Beach, CA back in the day. I don't like the dishonest character, the grifter role he played, but he played it very well. Keaton is versatile and not just limited to comedies. Very intense, very informative film, yet touches areas that are negative at times. I liked it. Only reason I didn't give it a 4 or 5 is the same reason the original ""The Omen"" with Gregory Peck won't get a 5 out of 5 star even though it's sort of Rad, too: the subject matter was too bleak and grim. But awesome acting by all 3 main actors in Pac. Hts.",1443657600,,645,4.086614173228346

Talk about ""art imitating life"" - this sort of thing actually occurs in real life & I suspect that many movies like this, while excellently acted & produced, have proved to be the ""catalyst"" for others committing real offenses similar to this. The best part of the movie, however, was how Melanie Griffith's character deals with Michael Keaton's character in bringing him down!! Great film...!!",1421107200,,633,4.925233644859813

386433,3,6301942728,"Very suspenseful but unpleasant. The resolution does not make up for the injustice to the young couple. . .

Does the law in California really provide no remedy to home owners that are the victims of a squatter who has no lease, destroys the property, makes life intoleralbe, and dismantle and removes everything but the kitchen sink?

The conclusion should make me feel that justice (divine, not the justice of the State of California) is done but the victims of the sociopath are completely innocent so i am still disturbed about how the law of California, in the movie, has treated them.",1403740800,,590,4.7745098039215685

386489,5,6301942728,"The story takes place in an upscale rental unit, in the vicinity of the front yard, and occasionally in other settings, such as in a hospital emergency room.  The rental unit is a tattered Victorian home that is located in Pacific Heights.  Pacific Heights is the most expensive part of San Francisco.  A young married couple (Matthew Modine and Melanie Griffith) decides to take out a loan and buy the old Victorian home.  They begin to screen potential renters, politely asking each party to fill out a form to confirm their finances.  As it turns out, one of the potential renters somehow moves into one of the two rental units and begins ""living"" there.  Then the troubles escalate.  The renter (Michael Keaton) never pays the rent or the security deposit.  Michael Keaton has a male roommate who is a non-communicative thug, who makes loud noises at all hours of the day, banging large holes in the walls.  The two roommates keep thousands of cockroaches, who meander free in the apartment.  The cockroaches find their way into the apartment of the neighboring tenants, who are polite middle-aged Japanese professionals.  In one scene, we see the cockroaches spilling out of a small hole under the sink, and meandering around the apt of the Japanese tenants.  In another scene, the Japanese man drives a nail in the wall, for use in hanging a picture, causing an electrical fire, and causing all the lights in the building to go out.  The young couple hires an attorney with the goal of evicting Michael Keaton, but the judge tells the couple that Michael Keaton has a right to continue occupying the apartment.  Things go from bad to worse, to very worse, and to much more worse.  As the story continues, the couple finds itself in deeper sushi.  Another movie, WHAT ABOUT BOB, is similar to this movie, but PACIFIC HEIGHTS is WHAT-ABOUT-BOB-on-steroids.  In WHAT ABOUT BOB, an unwanted houseguest makes himself at home, and the protagonist gets angrier and angrier and drives himself into a fit.  The same sort of thing happens to Matthew Modine in PACIFIC HEIGHTS, who is periodically driven over the edge by Michael Keaton's antics.

The normally innocuous theme of PACIFIC HEIGHTS (the issue of evicting a bad tenant), contrasts with the developing horrors that beset the young couple. In a sort of perverted way, this contrast has a comedic effect, at least for the first 2/3rds of the movie.  A similar comedic effect occurs in a 20-minutes sketch by John Candy, called, ROY'S FOOD REPAIR.  What is innocuous in this sketch, is ordinary damage to food, such as a crushed portion of a birthday cake, or salt falling off from potato chips and accumulating at the bottom of the bag.  What is a developing cause of alarm, is the fact that John Candy charges money to repair birthday cakes, potato chips, and other types of food.  Sometimes, John Candy decides that the damage would cost too much to repair, and he refuses to help the client with his food.

At about the two-thirds point in PACIFIC HEIGHTS, the film discontinues its flirtation with innocuous comedy.  At this two-thirds point, the film segues into a pathological crime-thriller, almost on par with FORT APACHE THE BRONX or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.",1399852800,,3219,4.83029197080292

The first time watching for him and he thought it was a horror movie, given the crap the tenant has pulled for the last year.  I watched the second time and found myself amused.

I got no entertainment whatsoever out of this film.  The bad guy that lives in the apartment stirs up more trouble than simply paying his rent- he's looking for blood.  Who's blood?  Why, the same people firmly and persistently asking for his rent money of course!  The landlords!  Oh, and in order to keep an exaggerated storyline flowing guess what the police do when they're brought to the scene?  They DON'T question the fact that the bad guy (played by Michael Keaton) changed the locks on his apartment door which is an important and suspicious piece of information, and instead the cops choose to point the blame at the victim who just happened to wake up in a bad mood that day and couldn't keep his emotions in check (and he wasn't even *that* rowdy, really).

Michael Keaton isn't intimidating in his role because he resembles many other late 80's actors that try to be big and bad but completely miss the mark, Melanie Griffith is extraordinarily phony in her performance and overdramatizes just about every single line she says, and the actual suspense was probably noticeable and believable back in the early 90's but now Pacific Heights has become an unintentional comedy.",1342915200,,1431,4.808163265306122

386615,4,6301942728,"The character Michael Keaton plays is a realistic con-man/drifter/psychopath. That is what made the movie work for me. I've had it (DVD) in my collection for five years and saw it on video for the first time in 1998. I enjoyed it then and I enjoyed it this afternoon when I saw it for only the second time in my life.

  SPOILER ALERT!!!

Because I work in residential apartments I come into contact with fellows like this all of the time. The scene where Keaton hoodwinks Modine into allowing him to sign the lease without checking his background is a real nail biter. I kept saying to myself: ""Don't do it, Matthew, don't do it!"" Indeed, an older and more experienced landlord would never have fallen for the ruse, nor would a more streetwise individual. But Matthew was duped and this mistake cost the couple thousands upon thousands of dollars in legal and medical bills. Just think, if they had instead rented to Carl Lumbly's character, Griffin would not have miscarried due to the stress, Modine would not have been arrested for assault, or shot for that matter, and they would have had two tenants remain in their unit for the duration of their leases which would have fattened Griffin and Modine's bank accounts. After all they went thru it's no wonder they decided to sell it off at a slight profit. Yet it never would have come to this had they followed the common sense advice listed in the below paragraph.

The movie is in fact a cautionary tale to all landlords. ALWAYS DO A CREDIT & BACKGROUND CHECK!! No exceptions! While I enjoyed the movie I would give it only Three 1/2 Stars. The Four-Star Rating is by default. Still, it's an exciting movie and does its job quite well for its genre. I recommend it to potential viewers.

By the way, the packaging is somewhat lacking I would say. Don't expect the box to be delivered intact or the interior spindles to be unbroken.

386616,1,6301942728,"Here's the thing; a thriller, in order to be effective, needs to make sense.  You can't have a film that borders on the ridiculous, or in this case just jumps right in, expect to attain any respect and it certainly can't expect to deliver on its promise.  That is where `Pacific Heights' went wrong.  It lacks believability and it dives headfirst into stupidity.

And before you start griping that slasher flicks aren't `smart' either, I will be quick to point out that they are different animals altogether.  `Pacific Heights' is not a horror movie, it is a thriller.  Thriller's need to operate with a sense of realism in order to thrill because the audience has to believe that they could be in a similar situation.  Horror movies are made to tamper with unrealities.

The general concept of `Pacific Heights' is believable.  You have a young couple, Patty and Drake, who buy a beautiful Victorian home and pour in their savings to fix it up and rent out two apartments.  Unlucky for them, they rent one of the apartments out to Carter Hayes, a psychopath who is bent on destroying their home, forcing them into foreclosure and getting his hands on their property.  It's what he does for a living.  He's good at it.  Sadly, the law protects creeps who understand how to manipulate things in their favor, and Carter Hayes is a very good manipulator (and antagonist).

This could happen.

Where `Pacific Heights' losing steam is in the construction of scenes, the final chapter of plot progression and the horrendous performances that degrade any tension in the film.  First of all, director John Schlesinger is so clichd in his direction that everything lacks true depth of fear.  The spaces are creepy, but they are repeated too often.  His idea of thrills are cheap and he doesn't possess any range, limiting his bag of tricks to the predictable.  The twist at the end (cat and mouse) comes off cheesy and unrealistic by a large margin (poor helpless Patty is now a master-spy?) and it derails any faux chills that the film mustered up until that point.  The biggest pitfall though, is the acting.  Melanie Griffith comes off like she's trying too hard to act; her performance resembling a high school play.  She emotes without any real passion and fizzles mid-sentence at times.  Michael Keaton is just creepy, but not in an inspired way.  He has played multiple variations of this character before, mainly because his face carries this air of unease (he's kind of scary looking), but this performance is just lazy.  He doesn't do anything to spice things up.  The worst player, by a country mile, is Matthew Modine.  He is just atrocious.  Part of that is due to the fact that his character is a mess.  The script does him no favors.  He just comes off as a hotheaded four-year-old, unable to act like a man and deal with a situation properly.  He shoots himself in the foot every chance he gets, but Modine is just not convincing.  He spews vulgarities and throws his arms around and pouts and yells and just looks ridiculous.

At the end of the day, this film was awful.",1320278400,,3078,4.6934579439252335

386717,3,6301942728,"It seemed like a good idea at the time. Fix-up an old Victorian home in a fashionable San Francisco neighborhood, rent out some of the rooms to help pay the mortgage, and keep the best part of the house for yourselves. However, when the young couple Patty Palmer (Melanie Griffith) and Drake Goodman (Matthew Modine) do just that, their great plans turn into a horror story.

In this film the couple inadvertently let Carter Hayes (Michael Keaton) take possession of an apartment in their home before he pays any rent. Hayes soon exploits California's liberal tenant-rights laws and cannot be evicted. Hayes then slowly terrorizes the couple and the other tenant by making noise, starting an insect infestation, and damaging the newly-remodeled home.

Furious about the situation, Modine's character lashes-out and soon finds himself on the wrong side of the law. As the situation deteriorates, the couple begins to argue over money, fear living in their own home, and seek revenge on the renegade tenant.

''Pacific Heights'' shows the dangers that exist when an evil person chooses to exploit others and has no remorse about doing so. Although the film is somewhat depressing, it does show the dangers of being too trusting or naive when dealing with others.

While I liked the plot of the movie, the acting by Modine and Griffith, was mediocre at best. They often seem wooden and stilted when delivering their lines. And Modine's character became annoying as he initially downplayed the situation then lashed-out at others for his own mistakes. But the drama and exciting final few scenes make the film a good horror-drama.",1222905600,,1626,5.033457249070632

The second rental doesn't go quite as smoothly. A man named Carter Hayes (Michael Keaton from Batman, Batman Returns, and Beetlejuice) moves right in w/ what appear to be impeccable references, and a wad of cash in his wallet. Alas, Hayes is not on the level, and Patty and Drake soon find out just how off-balance this guy is! Hayes squats in the apartment, refusing to leave.

The building stress, and inabiliy to legally do anything about it, eventually cause Drake to snap, sending him diving on Hayes for a major beat-down! Well, this action results in Goodman's arrest. Of course, Hayes is seen as just a poor innocent victim in all of this. Goodman is even under restraining order, and cannot come within 500ft of his own home! What can this couple do to regain their property and their sanity? Watch the fun unfold! PACIFIC HEIGHTS is a magnificent Catch-22 type story of the common man caught up in the idiocy of the system. No matter how hard they try, Hayes is always protected by the law. There's a healthy stream of good old fashioned black comedy running through this movie's veins! Keaton is superb as the nefarious Hayes, driven to do what he does by whatever pathology rumbles through his head. I consider this to be his finest performance.

Carter Hayes is a con artist played by Michael Keaton.  Hayes isn't a smooth con artist like Gordon Gecko in Wall Street or as smart as Frank Abagnale Jr. in Catch Me If You Can who always seems to be one step ahead of the law on the contrary Keaton's character needs and manipulates the laws to pull off his cons they serve to protect him more than his victims, also victims to a flawed system.  He is also a psychopath, we get glimpses into his childhood that may explain why he is the way he is.
The victims in this movie are a couple who take a risk and buy an investment property depending a great deal financially on the rent of the two apartments they'll be renting out.  One of those apartments gets rented to our psycho con artist who wants the house for himself and so begins our game of cat and cockroach.
This is for fans of thrillers, it'll have you voicing your opinion to the screen or whoever you are watching it with about what you would do in that situation.  It taps into that fear that most of us can relate to, that is hardwired into us the fear of losing what we have, paying bills, and protecting what is ours.

386722,3,6301942728,"Pacific Heights is a prettt solid three star movie. It's not the greatest thriller ever, but it's definitely not entirely unbelievable. It's somewhere in between.

A couple (young couple, if you believe the back of the DVD) pools their life savings to purchase an old Victorian house in San Francisco, with plans to rent out the two rooms on the bottom floor in order to pay the mortgage each month. What they don't count on is Michael Keaton's sociopathic creation Carter Hayes moving in. Terrible events ensue.

It's a pretty solid premise and plays out fairly well, except that in order for Hayes' plans to unravel correctly, you have to assume that any landlord would be rash enough to accept you as a tenant without receiving any payment and without a rental application, shut off your power if you're loud at night, physically attack you and knock you through a glass window, and ultimately be unsuspecting enough not to watch out for you making bail once you've been discovered and arrested. These flaws, which feel more and more forced throughout, seriously damage the chilling nature of the film, and also damage what would otherwise be a very credibly psychological thriller.

Michael Keaton is the only credible actor in the film a well, although Beverly D'Angelo also has some good scenes. Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine give stilted performances that also hurt the movie, Modine more so than Griffith.

Now that I've said all the bad stuff about the movie, I'm changing my tune to say that it was still interesting to watch and for a movie made 17 years ago, it held on to quite a bit of its twists and intrigue. Identity theft is much more technologically advanced these days, but the idea of someone walking around pretending to be you is equally disconcerting in 2007 as it was in 1990. Pacific Heights is definitely still worth a watch.",1170201600,,1858,4.796875

386724,4,6301942728,"There is some first-rate acting in Pacific Heights by Melanie Griffith, Mathew Modine, Mako, Nobu McCarthy, Michael Keaton and every other role, however large or small in the film.  I'd rate Pacific Heights as a full five-stars were it not for the less than inspired writing.  (I often suspect some writers believe their audience is primarily composed of idiots.)

A young, unmarried straight couple, played by Griffith and Modine, buy a fixer up house on a corner lot in Pacific Heights.  The couple spends way more for the house than they can possibly afford unless they subdivide the home into three separate apartments, two of which will be rented out.  (Bankers generally look down, way down, on this type of financial risk.)

The first floor apartment at the rear of the house is quickly rented to Mako and his wife, sympathetically played by Nobu McCarthy.  A black detective wants to rent the apartment at the front of the house also on the first floor, but is told by Ms. Griffith that he'll have to fill out an application and a credit check will have to be run.  (Isn't this general practice regardless of one's race, sex or obviously ""apparent"" assets, such as car, clothes, shoes, hair style, etc?  But Pacific Heights tries to suggest the need for a background and credit check may relate to the detective's skin color.  But Ms. Griffith, who does the interview, isn't even told the guy's a cop!  Nor is he asked, ""What do you do for a living?""

The biggest problem in Pacific Heights involves the manner in which Michael Keaton (who drives a black Porsche 911 in the movie) cons and forces his way into the apartment that otherwise would have gone to the black detective.  Anywhere but California, and, I suspect, in California, too, Keaton's move into the first floor apartment isn't just unauthorized, it's a home invasion by a squatter!  Keaton never fills out an application; he never pays the deposit; he never pays his rent; after he invades the home he gets into a fight with Modine---and gets a restraining order that keeps Modine out of his own house!  The writing here is way too far-fetched.

As stated above, the acting is first-rate.  So is the direction.  And so are the sets and costumes.  And San Francisco is such a beautiful place to visit or film a movie.  The only problem with Pacific Heights is that the writing is far too weak.

386725,5,6301942728,"PACIFIC HEIGHTS is the ultimate story of the tenant gone completely crazy...and completely wrong! This is one of the best thrillers to grace movies besides FATAL ATTRACTION and DIABOLIQUE (the 1960s version).

Matthew Modine and Melanie Griffith play Drake and Patty, a couple trying to invest in their dream of buying a house in the beautiful suburbs of San Francisco, and restoring it to rent to the idea tenants. Enter Michael Keaton as Carter Hayes, the conman sociopath who seems at first like the most idea individual to pick as a tenant, but Drake and Patty have no idea what they are getting themselves into when they find out he has welcomed himself into the new apartment. Carter gets them both into trouble in some sinister ways, and uses the law to his full benefit to make everything look like it's Patty, and especially Drake's, fault. Over the course of the movie, these series of events start to take a toll on the relationship between Patty and Drake, and even worse, Carter's breeding roaches in his own place...disgusting! Things get really hairy after Patty does some very clever private investigating and really messes with Carter to the point that the climax of the movie brings it all into play.

Michael Keaton plays the crooked tenant to absolute perfection in one of his best roles as a bad guy. Modine and Griffith have excellent chemistry as the couple trying to fight to knock Carter out of their lives. Even an appearance by Laurie Metcalf makes for some entertainment you're sure to appreciate.

PACIFIC HEIGHTS is one of the best thrillers, great for a Saturday night stay-in or for an introduction into where thrillers got really smart again since the days of PSYCHO and WAIT UNTIL DARK. And you can't go wrong with the wicked performance by Keaton, and some memorable perfomances from the cast all around. PACIFIC HEIGHTS is the ultimate nightmare...and the ultimate experience of tenants gone...well, very mad.",1127692800,,1945,4.905775075987842

386787,5,6301942728,"I have to say this was a great feature. I liked the production value, acting, dialouge, and sequence of disasters that literally gets your adrenaline going. Michael Keaton portrays as menacing of a horrendous psychopath as you could ever want, and the private eye efforts of Melanie Griffith toward the nerve jolting conclusion were quite realistic and well performed. Quite a shock nowadays with the internet and virtual signatures responsible for thousands of new cases of fraud each day, to look back 15 years ago to see that your most professional criminals could do it just as efficiently back then as now if not even easier. I give it an A+ and it definitely is among the best films of the early 1990's.",1124150400,,709,4.772357723577236
386788,5,6301942728,"It was about 8 years ago at least when I first seen this film. At that time I was young and I couldn't remember it, but I just bought it the other day. I watched it, and it was totally different from what I expected. I could only remember this film being very nasty and the villain (played by the excellent Michael Keaton) to be more scarier. Even though the film wasn't what I expected it was still good. Many people hate Michael Keaton's character in this, I can see why, but the character I more hate in this is Matthew Modine's. His character always treats Keaton's very badly in it, and he never treats him nice in it. The ending is quite tense (it was the only part I remember from when I saw it 8 years ago), a bity predictable, but it was good. The film can also try to be funny in places, it can be too.
So, you might not expect such a psychological thriller that much in this, but it does reach a point in the film where it does become psychological as it nears the end.",1087344000,,980,4.109375

yuppies-cum-landlords,  Patty Palmer and Drake Goodman (Melanie Griffith & Matthew Modine) through their paces as they experience the WORST tenant in the history of landlord lore!
Carter Hayes, armed with power tools, garbage, his little cockroach friends, and the law on his side, are GUARANTEED to drive Patty and Drake out of their beautiful victorian fixer-upper that they have just purchased. It seems like Carter would like to pick up the house for himself and thus, tries his darndest to make Patty and Drake default on their huge mortgage.
Tippi Hedren, Laurie Metcalf and Dan Hedaya also star.
This is a great suspense filled movie with a ""killer"" ending.  Michael Keaton is perfect in the role as Carter Hayes.  He is one of the most flexible and versatile actors, playing good guys (Mr. Mom & The Dream Team), bad guys (Pacific Heights & Desparate Measures), cartoon characters (Batman & Beatlejuice), & a dying man (My Life).
This is a most excellent suspense film and highly recommended!

386790,5,6301942728,"Drake (Modine) and Patty (Griffith) are the average, healthy, nonchalant couple who having just purchased their dream Victorian house in Pacific Heights, San Francisco; get themselves further into debt as they delightfully tend to both the interior & exterior of the residence to a surpassed point. Fortunately within days, one of the flats is rented by gentle elderly pair who, like Drake and Patty, are pushed to the limits by new resident, Carter Hayes who rents out flat No. 2.
A smooth operator in both person and when away, hypothetically on business, Hayes brusquely tears their lives apart in what would seem like revenge for something they seemingly did not commit. Asking candidly for their first instalment of rent from the now-missing Mr Hayes, Drake loses his temper and gets physical with the slippery weasel and ends up naively in police cuffs. With Drake away, Patty resumes regular duties in the house which alas results in a terrifying experience for the broken lovers. A few drill holes and clunking-around later, Drake attempts to access the flat, but when his master key fails to work on Hayes' new lock, Drake pulls a berserker and decides to cut off the tenant's gas and disconnects his electricity. Living on Squatters Law, Hayes & Co. takes as much as they can as quick as they can, until Drake & Patty uncover the brutal truth of their new inexplicable tenant.
Michael Keaton with one of his alien straighter roles, as was he a year earlier in Tim Burton's `Batman', he acquaints us with another beguiling character from his mental library of personalities. Melanie Griffith is stupendous as the tormented wife and Matthew Modine as the everyday nonentity pushed to his individual limitations, is in an all-out performance in one of his more fashionable years when he also starred in the smash-hit war epic, `Memphis Belle'. With no bona fide soundtrack, of course excusing the sporadic classical wipe over, the film breeds on its sinister sound effects of creaking floorboards and mechanical shrills from an assortment of industrial tools. Griffith must have thanked her lucky stars after the flop of the highly anticipated film from Brian DePalma, `The Bonfire of the Vanities'. John Schlesinger brings an incredibly tight-knit story with menacing and suffocating direction that barley pauses for breath. One of his more finer recent pieces that only has the unbelievably underrated Richard Gere movie `Yanks' to battle with in terms of best contemporary movie from his catalogue. A brightly written script by Daniel Pyne, with one of the most far-fetched productions by Scott Rudin and William Sackheim.
Includes an Alfred Hitchcock style cameo from British-born director Schlesinger as an elevator passenger as does Griffiths mother, Tippi Hedren as a millionaire charmed by Hayes.",1047168000,,2811,5.139737991266376

I loved Patti and Drake's relationship, because they seemed like such a realistic 'starting-out' couple, and Keaton was great as the sadistic tenant.

Now, for the review of this film-total garbage!  None of the facts invested into this film hold any water whatsoever!  I simply had to cringe and laugh uncontrollably when the police arrive in favor of the Michael Keaton character after Matthew Modine beats the living crap out of him.  The most irritating character had to be the lawyer, a complete no-talent actress that belongs behind a counter flipping burgers somewhere!  Which by now, I am sure she is-thank God!  This movie simply proves, you don't really need to have talent to be making movies!  Now, what about the Melanie Griffith character?  She's the only reason this movie is even remotely interesting.  If not for her in the final act, this movie would fall face flat on the ground like it should have!  Lame script!  Lame characters (with the exception of Melanies character of course).

386794,3,6301942728,"This is a carefully programmed yuppie nightmare, something to titillate the emotions betwixt the sushi and the creme de mint, something to remind  the upwardly mobile that you have to keep your guard up at all times  because there are animals out there waiting to take it all away from  you.
Clever plot premise:  Yuppie couple, stylishly unmarried, possibly  for tax purposes, buy a painted lady in the Pacific Heights district of San  Francisco, a Victorian fixer upper for $750,000.  It's the 1980's and  everybody is getting rich in California real estate.  They are now in  yuppie heaven since there are two rentals on the property which take care  of $2300 of the $3700 monthly mortgage, which leaves them responsible for  only $1400, which is less then they were paying before, and now they have a  huge tax write-off and hopefully an appreciating property.  Of course they  are margined to the gills, but what can go wrong?
How about the tenant  from hell?  Forget about your wild parties and your late-with-the-rent dead  beats.  This guy (Michael Keaton as a slimy, upper crust psycho genius)  doesn't even pay the deposit.  He just moves in, squats, and our yuppie  couple is helpless to get rid of him since by law he now has possession.  He changes the locks, cultivates big ugly cockroaches, and pounds away at  all hours of the night, and chases off the other tenant.  Seems he has done  this before.  Seems it is an elaborate scam to gain total possession of the  entire property.  Next to go are the owners.  Naturally the cops and the  law seem to work for him, not our adorable couple.  (This is a little  fiction to further excite the passions of the audience, call it poetic  license, since we all know that the tenant/landlord laws in California are  written by and for the propertied class, as they are anywhere else, as is  only right.)
But this is a morality play.  Could it be that our yuppies  are undeserving of their wealth and are easy prey in the econ jungle  because of their naivet?  Could be.  But as this is a modern morality  tale, you can be sure that the woman, played with worrisome lines under her  eyes by the ever adorable Melanie Griffith, will turn the tables and kick  some male butt despite the handicap of having a not too bright boyfriend,  who is easily manipulated by our villain into some rather stupid male  behavior that makes things worse for our heroine.  Incidentally, he is  played with such annoying exactitude by Matthew Modine that I can hear the  rednecks in the audience screaming: ""Die yuppie scum!""
It should be  noticed that the adversary of the yuppies is not your standard ghetto  dweller, but a wayward member of the upper class, a fitting adversary in  this yuppie trial by fire.
