2801917,5,B000OY9VF2,"Les Claypool fans will love this fancy style footage of some very fancy style live music. This video is Enjoyable, entertaining, exciting, excellent, electric, elegant, and on to the F's, Fancy!!! The sax player is almost to fancy. Warning: if you are one of those rich snobby type fancy people that actually lives a fancy life then you really should buy the limited edition gold plated extra fancy copy when it never comes out.",1228089600,4,428,4.797297297297297
2801918,5,B000OY9VF2,"This was a long awaited release. The previous Primus live dvds have been excellent, but this provides a look into the other wild side of Les's career. This dvd is awesome. Les and his band, including gabby la la, are amazing live. Sound and video quality are superb. Enjoy.",1185408000,6,273,4.591836734693878
2801919,4,B000OY9VF2,"For this DVD, Claypool and his current company, sitarist Gabby La La, saxophonist Skerik of Seattle based band Critters Buggin', drummer Paulo Baldi, and an exceptionally talented xylophonist/percussionist named Mike Dillon, serve up extended jam sessions of songs from the albums 'Of Whales and Woe', and Frog Brigade's 'Purple Onion'.

The result is some awesome jams involving a sitar and a xylophone and a guy with a devil's mask on with its face cut off screaming into his sax microphone, as well as Claypool with an elvis mask on with its face cut off from the bottom of the sunglasses down. I don't know why I felt that needed to be explained, but I watched half of the show going, 'What the 'ell is that on his head?'

Anyways, for fans of Primus and Les and xylophone jams and sitars played extremely quickly, and guys with half-masks screaming into mics and stuff, this is the DVD for you. It is a reaffirmation of the sheer talent some musicians can have. Alright.",1183852800,12,975,4.695906432748538
2801920,5,B000OY9VF2,"I got this DVD from a friend for my birthday this year, and being a Les fan since 1990 I have to say I really enjoy this DVD.

Not much to say other than ""God I love that man!!!!!""",1182297600,,180,3.6153846153846154

8187196,5,B000OY9VF2,"Les Claypool is one of the hidden gems of rock music.  Under the radar of most people, he is as prolific as anyone in the biz and is what most rock veterans quickly cease to be and that is endlessly brave and interesting.  He revels in plying his craft by filtering his songs and talents through a myriad of band incarnations- Duo Twang, Oysterhead, Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains (with Buckethead and Bernie Worrell), Les Claypool's Frog Brigade, The Claypool Lennon Delirium (with Sean Lennon), to name a few!  This is his Fancy band and the DVD is excellent, both in sound quality and footage.  Culled from performances in several major cities, the band rocks, with a rhythmic xylophone and bleating sax no less. They excel in long jams that give you your money's worth and the highlights include the performances of Phantom Patriot, The Big Eyeball in the Sky. Holy Mackerel and D's Diner.  It's Les Claypool at his very best.",1481673600,,942,4.754601226993865

No, this is ridiculous. 1st off it's shot in 4:3, 2cd the audio is only stereo and finally the lighting is so poor, the video is average bootleg quality. Fancy, not. Ridiculous, yes.",1273449600,,190,4.588235294117647
