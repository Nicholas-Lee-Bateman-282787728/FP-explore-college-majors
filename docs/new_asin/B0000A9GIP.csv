The last time I went to Oakland was in October 2004 when I went to a taping of the ""Jeopardy!"" College Championship at the Petersen Events Center (unfortunately, there was no Petersen Events Center when this came out).

When my aunt Michele had my cousin Angie, I went into Oakland to go to the ""O"", or the Original Hot Dog shop.  I got a hot dog, along with those ""O"" fries (you got lots of them).

This video is spectacular, whether racing through Schenley Park with the Vintage Grand Prix, or marveling at the Bug Rooms at the Carnegie Museums.  I didn't purchase it here, I actually purchased it at the Heinz History Center when I was in Pittsburgh with the PSU Shenango History Club.",1134259200,,737,4.595419847328245
