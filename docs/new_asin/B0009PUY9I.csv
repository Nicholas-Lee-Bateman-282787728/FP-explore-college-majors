8064936,4,B0009PUY9I,"Columbia's out-of-print Volume 8 is a must for Stooge fans, since it opens with the ""Curly Shuffle"" video - a surprise hit for the Jump 'N the Saddle Band. The accompanying shorts directed by Del Lord (""Cash and Carry,"" ""Some More of Samoa"" and the topical ""No Census, No Feeling"") are also available on DVD, but the 1984 music video can only be found on this cassette. A solid and enjoyable Stooge compilation.",1273363200,,411,4.6438356164383565
8064937,5,B0009PUY9I,"In the earlier shorts, the stories were more important to the Stooges. In Cash and Carry, the boys go home to the city dump only to find that two poor children are living in their shack. The two are trying to save up money for an operation for the boy who is crippled with a limp, so the stooges take matters into their own hands. They invest the money the kids have saved in a treasure map that leads them right into the US Treasury! The story is funny enough to carry the viewer along, but it is also peppered with some very funny jokes and the typical slapstick routines.

No Census, No Feeling is a five star short all the way. To escape paying for damages done to a sidewalk sale, the stooges get jobs as census takers. They prefer to take the census of a young beautiful woman, but they do anything and everything to get as many people as they can, often imposing on each others' territory. Curly's antics are laugh-out-loud funny as he both retaliates on Moe and inflicts torture upon himself. Also featured is a trademark huddle when the boys wind up trying to take the census of a bunch of football players-- during a game!

Some More of Samoa features an outrageous story. The stooges are tree doctors and find a rare patient. The man looking after the tree has made himself sick worrying about the plant. The stooges recommend getting the tree a mate and are offered $10,000 if they can get another like it. Off they go to a remote island on a quest for the tree which just happens to be in an area occupied by savages. There are some funny pop culture references here including an immitation of popular radio personalities Amos N Andy. Curly is standout as usual with his cute and funny singing.",1161129600,,1707,4.415873015873016
8064938,4,B0009PUY9I,"This Stooges video is great as VHS tapes go.  Cash and Carry is one of their best, and No Census, No Feeling is good too.  DVD's are better obviously, but I haven't found Cash and Carry in a good DVD collection yet.",1127692800,,215,4.095238095238095
