7291152,5,B00ZRBQVVO,"I love Samuel L. Jackson so when I began to find this movie to have a  somewhat dark Disney feel, I stayed with it. I ended up enjoying the movie. It made me feel good.",1435276800,3,168,3.8
7291153,5,B00ZRBQVVO,Love this movie. One of S.L.J's best performances.,1527984000,,50,5.375
7291154,1,B00ZRBQVVO,The plot was laughable. A cheap foreign production that failed to employ a decent subject matter expert.,1527897600,,104,5.176470588235294
7291155,5,B00ZRBQVVO,"Lots of fun to watch.  great landscapes.

would pay to go to a theatre to watch.",1527552000,,80,3.9375
7291156,5,B00ZRBQVVO,Even though Samuel Jackson is way played out this was still a great movie carried by a kid I never seen before..He done such a good job SJ has never looked better..Good movie for kids and crabby old people too.,1527465600,,210,4.275
7291157,5,B00ZRBQVVO,i love there accent and the speech was great.,1527379200,,45,4.111111111111111
7291158,2,B00ZRBQVVO,"Without a doubt, this is one of the most ridiculous films that I have ever sat through. It starts off reasonably enough but after about 30 minutes it gets so unbelievable that it is impossible to take seriously. Honestly, I don't know how a script like this could have ever been green lighted for production. The circumstances and situations are just so utterly beyond belief that its asking way too much of the audience to suspend their disbelief.

Samuel L Jackson's acting is pretty on par with most of his action movies. He plays a bumbling and inept President of the United States who ends up depending on a 13 year old to rescue him over and over again throughout the course of the movie. The ""bad guys"" seem equally inept at their jobs, letting the two slip through their fingers in scene after scene. The only character portrayed as being competent is the 13 year old who seems to be going through a bit of an identity crisis until he stumbles across the President of the United States and barely avoids being crashed into be Air Force One.

About the only appeal of this movie is that it doesn't feature a lot of gore or bad language. Therefore, it might be of appeal to kids as a sort of family film. I could see a child buying into the premise of the movie but I'm afraid that it doesn't hold much of an appeal for adults.",1526169600,,1333,4.392712550607287
7291159,5,B00ZRBQVVO,"I loved this little gem! Found it on my Starz add on subscription and I'm sure glad I did. Samuel is always great but I loved the boy the most. His performance was outstanding! I though he and Samuel worked fantastic together!

A great feel good movie all the way around. And yeah, I have added the blu ray to my Amazon Wishlist ",1526169600,,329,4.2063492063492065
7291160,5,B00ZRBQVVO,Funny and deserved more play. Samuel L Jackson and the young actor play off each other well,1522281600,,91,4.411764705882353

7291164,4,B00ZRBQVVO,"Fun movie probably best suited to young teens, I think my nephew who is 12.5 and very interested in his Finnish heritage will really like this film. The director, producer, writers are all Finnish. The filming was largely done in Switzerland and German mountainous region. I read elsewhere a review that compared this movie to a comic book and I think that captures the tone - some unrealistic, predictable action that for me did not detract from this being an enjoyable movie to watch. This is a film I could watch with my nephew and his grandparents and not feel uncomfortable due to content. Pretty hard to find films like that anymore.",1513728000,,639,4.714285714285714

Might be one curse word, if that.
Action packed.  Funny.

Especially great for people that go hunting!",1488499200,,150,4.555555555555555
7291172,4,B00ZRBQVVO,"Before Air Force One Crashes over Finnland, the President of the USA, played by Samuel Jackson, is ejected inside a ""pod"" into the rugged, mountainous area of Finland. Unfortunately, the man who is supposed to be protecting the president sent him into the treacherous mountains to be hunted and killed by assains.
Meet the young actor, Onni Tommila, who plays the young boy fulfilling his community rite of passage to bring back ""big game"" to be used for food and to be photographed with the boy and put on the wall of a  cabin with the other ""men"" of his community. The problem is the boy isn't as big and strong as other boys his age. Still . . .
The movie has incredible action scenes. The President does have an agenda to stay alive that affects the world's well-being; and the boy, in his world, must bring back ""big game"" or bring shame on himself and his father. The boy recognises the president's assassins are the enemy and that protecting the President and getting him to safety are important. Samuel L. Jackson does an amazing job of carrying off being the President and recognising the importance of the boy's  ritual into manhood. It's a great movie!",1486425600,,1163,4.613526570048309

7291182,5,B00ZRBQVVO,My husband and I and our two grandson's loved this movie.  Very fast moving and slight humor. But a good underlying story about a brave young boy.,1481500800,,146,4.407407407407407
7291183,5,B00ZRBQVVO,"Great coming of age movie. A young man is of age when he, like all the men in the village and his family, go out into the wild on a great hunt. Unfortunately for him, he finds the President of the Unite States in a safety pod that was sent down when an assassination attempt was made while on the way to a conference over the Andes. What neither of them know is the President has been betrayed by one of his own and is even now searching for him to hand him over to the enemy. Samuel L. Jackson is on a role that is unfamiliar to him but he plays it very well as the pampered, whining westerner he is. He and the young man come to an agreement and understanding as they try to make it back to civilization and help before he is captured. It's a wonderful adventure story great for the entire family. Highly recommended.",1481241600,2,819,4.125

7291210,2,B00ZRBQVVO,"I had a tough time rating this one. Not the best acting by Samuel L. Jackson, (which surprised me, as I do like him very much) the plot was interesting but more then a bit of a stretch from reality. AH, that's right, ITS A MOVIE!  I think I enjoyed the young boy co starring in it more then anything.  The beautiful mountains were probably the best part of the whole movie. I am no critic, this is just my personal take and my thoughts, you may enjoy it more then I. Suggestion: I'd watch it if it was a snowy day and I was comfy and putting my brain in neutral for the day.  :)",1473033600,,578,3.9655172413793105

7291213,3,B00ZRBQVVO,"Ok, I'll start with what it was that kept me from turning this movie off after 20 minutes.
The boy in the movie was an interesting character, both in look and speech. The scenery was beautiful and the shots of it were impressive.
The effects and stunts were pretty good and again, shot well.
Now for the bad.
Sam Jackson was a poor choice for this movie. I am used to Sam being type cast as a tough, loud, ready for battle type of character. His portrayal of an American President was irritatingly weasely, at times appearing to be afraid of his own shadow. It becomes obvious as to why he needs the protection of a 13 year old boy. Sam would have been better cast as the villain ""big game"" hunter.
The movie never gives any of the characters a chance to develop, never really understood what it was the ""insider's"" beef was. What was it the President did, or didn't do that sparked this characters ire?. All we really get about the Presidents past is that he peed his pants one time...
I don't expect these type of movies to be realistic and I expect some absurdity, but I do want some continuity. If you are going to have a plane being blown up by a missile, then show it skidding to a stop in a forest, don't have submerged in the middle of a lake in the end only to have magically not submerged a minute later...
Expect nothing and you won't be disappointed. As unimpressive as it was, its still better than 75% of the movies they have listed on amazon",1470873600,,1456,4.298181818181818
7291214,5,B00ZRBQVVO,It was an awesome movie,1470787200,,23,3.8
7291215,1,B00ZRBQVVO,"So many other reviews detail why this movie is so terrible, it is not worth repeating.  There are so many good reasons not to watch this (plot, acting, special effects, pacing, story), I feel I must mention another.  This movie was so bad, I actually felt a little sick for watching it all the way through to its ridiculous, pathetic, ran-low-on-the-budget finale.  I half expected Sam Jackson to go Jules Winnfield at the end and chastise me for watching this aberration.  I was surprised at how bad this movie was.  I was shocked at the number of positive reviews for this movie.  Did I miss something?  Even the sets are ridiculous.  If Air Force One crash landed in a lake, remained whole (enough so that the lights are still on inside), so why is everyone on the plane dead?  How was it landed so perfectly?  Why, why, why did I continue to watch this train wreck when  I knew the punchline was not coming?",1470614400,,911,4.4939024390243905

7291217,2,B00ZRBQVVO,This was an OK movie.  Would never have paid for it in the theatre but God for free on TV.  Not a huge Samuel Jackson fan but he was reasonable.  The young kid was great.,1469750400,,170,3.8

7291307,3,B00ZRBQVVO,"Spoilers lurk.  A few years ago I was looking for something to watch with a Christmas theme and came across a movie called Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale.  It is an odd film combining something from Ralphie in The Christmas Story with a horror movie.  It has the same director and writer (Jalmari Helander) as this mostly English speaking movie.

Set in Finland, 13-year old Oskari (Onni Tommila who had the lead in the aforementioned Christmas Tale) is about to embark on a solo winter hunting trip, a tradition to become a man.  At the same time American president William Moore (Samuel L. Jackson) is enroute to Helsinki for a multi-nation meeting of some kind.  In another scene, a trio of goons accompany a supposed hunter into the mountain, but he isn't looking for wild animals.  Hes looking for Air Force One!  But wait.  Isnt the presidents plane escorted by jet fighters and doesnt the plane have anti-missile defenses?  Well yeah, but what if there is a conspiracy going on and somebody inside the plane turns off those defenses?  So there you go.

Prez Bill is placed in an escape pod and parachuted to the ground with his bodyguards right behind.  But what if somebody sabotaged those bodyguards parachutes?  While this all sounds silly enough and a reminder of Air Force One, the movie is actually is pretty darn good.  With the planes destruction imminent, the head of the security detail, Morris (Ray Stevenson) chuts out as the missiles head for their targets whizzing past him.  Very cool scene.

The President is rescued by Oskari and the two of them try to find civilization.  Their pairing is the best thing about the film.  Jackson, in a rare understated role, has a humanistic quality about him which plays nicely off his Im the President persona.  And Oskari has the he-man moxie that more than make up for his physical shortcomings.  So its President Moore and Oskari against Morris and his on-the-ground henchmen.  Back at the Pentagon, the vice president (Victor Garber), the CIA liaison (Jim Broadbent), the CIA director (Felicity Huffman) and the military chief (Ted Levine) ponder how to proceed.  And we try to sort out who is responsible for all of this.  Think twice before you decide.  This isn't a great movie by any stretch but it is an entertaining and satisfying diversion.",1454284800,,2311,4.804568527918781

7291322,3,B00ZRBQVVO,"Samuel L. Jackson is good as usual, and Onni Tommila, the young actor who plays the other lead, is good as well. Story wise, it's hard to believe that anyone who came across a plane crash survivor would refuse to immediately get survivor to safety, so the story fails there, but the story sells that point humorously, and it almost works. The villains are the weakest link for me. Really - a top security officer would sell out his country and murder all the people on those planes, some who presumably he'd worked with for years because he didn't think the President was a good enough leader, and disagreed with his policies. Didn't work. The writer needed to spend alot more time on that if he wanted to sell it. Many Americans disagree with presidential policies for a variety of reasons but most would not consider assassination a reasonable alternative. So the writer really, and I mean really, needed to show how that sequence of events came about. Not have his character talk it, but show it, braid into the story how the villain reached the conclusion that he needed to kill the President, and then to do what? To achieve what? And he did all that killing for money. As written this guy wasn't a double agent, he was a disgruntled citizen who decided to take the law into his own hands. And he sold out his team for what? $100 million? No, for a paltry $10 million. Now I don't  know any top level security people but I'm guessing that someone about to retire who was in charge of the President's security detail would be making a solid middle class salary, just guessing, maybe $200,000 (I worked as a legal secretary/legal word processor for years and made a decent salary as an experienced legal secretary before I became ill, but I'd estimate top legal secretaries who worked for big name attorneys probably earned well over $100,000 (six years ago), so someone in charge of the President's security detail would likely earn significantly more than a well compensated legal secretary). Now if this top security guy lived economically and invested wisely, if he had no children and his wife worked as a professional as well, he might be worth $5 million, with investments, property, at his retirement, which the story said would be happening shortly. And he could expect to receive his retirement income in addition to his/his wife's savings. Having him be worth about $5 million at retirement is possible (though again, I'm just guessing) so why would someone who was worth maybe $5 million and about to retire kill all those innocent people, some of whom he'd have liked and respected, for $10 million? Makes absolutely no sense. Even having him do what he did for $100 million wouldn't work because he'd know he wouldn't live long: he'd be hunted every second for the remainder of his life, and he'd be caught. The world is not a big place with security agencies constantly monitoring, and those agencies would be highly motivated to catch the man who'd slain the President of the United States, as well as all the other victims on Air Force One and the accompanying fighter planes. So to have him murder all those people and attempt to murder the President doesn't work if he does it for money in the story, because there's not enough money to justify his actions, plus he's already well off (unless he has some secret, money-pit addiction the film doesn't reveal). A better choice, in my opinion, would've been to make him a double agent, or possibly use religion as his justification. So, I had a problem with the primary, hands-on inside villain. The psychopath villain, well I don't like villains who're insane, it's hard for the audience to identify with insanity and I associate it with lazy writing. The James Broadbent character said the psychopath was an agent but that wasn't until the story's end - he was sold to the audience as insane during almost all the story. So neither of the two hands-on villains worked storywise for me. The other two villains, the Vice President wanting to be President, that could've worked, but it's weakly and unconvincingly sketched here. The only villain who worked somewhat was the Jim Broadbent character. He was willing to murder the Vice President to minimize risk of exposure to himself and that was believable. Had the writer focused on that quality of villain, the utter ruthlessness, quickness, coldbloodness, and effectiveness of Jim Broadbent's character during the bathroom scene, he would've been on to something. So the writer can write a good villain but he placed him too far from the Presidential action. Also when I see the James Broadbent character eating a sandwich during a Presidential assassination attempt, I know that wouldn't happen and I know this story is poorly told. If we have James Broadbent as a villain higher up in the administration, the last thing he'd want to do is bring  attention to himself by appearing to be less than concerned for the President's welfare during a national emergency. So I had a problem with the villain characters's presentation.  I also disliked the War Room sequences. The whole segment where the security teams are together and trying to figure out what had happened was unbelievable and told poorly - just don't think top security operates anywhere near as ineptly as was presented. The President character said it himself: ""I have the biggest, baddest, military in the world - where are they"" (I'm paraphrasing). Even I, who know nothing about Presidential security, wouldn't write something reflecting security ineptness to such an extent as the film represents, because I strongly suspect it's not true. I wouldn't be surprised if the President has a locator imbedded under his skin, in case he's kidnapped. In real life, security agencies of course wouldn't reveal such details to the public but I think we can pretty much believe that the President's security detail have both defensive and offensive strategies in place should the President be threatened. So the war room sequences didn't work for me. Good chemistry between the two leads, and a nice comedic touch by the actors and the filmmakers help make the film somewhat enjoyable and amusing. The music, though not exactly to my taste, generally sold the story well. Overall, I'd rate the film 2 and 1/2 stars rounded up to 3 as there are no half star options on Amazon. Well worth a watch if you're a Samuel L. Jackson fan because he, along with Onni Tommila, are quite good here and play their scenes with an enjoyable comedic touch.",1452038400,,6520,4.819642857142857

Sam Jackson plays the president of the united states (who better for the job) he don't need to do much in this movie to be cool anyway, his plane (Air-force one) crash lands in the middle of the wilderness, surrounded by terrorists on the ultimate hunt, he must survive with only the help of a 13 year old boy who is out to prove himself a man and a hunter and a hero, there is plenty of great action that's thrilling and exciting and funny at times all mixed in, its a really easy going movie, not a lot to think about, the set-up is there from the beginning and it could be a tad predictable but sit back and enjoy the ride you go on with the characters! it also stars Ray Stevenson who plays a nasty villain he's quite entertaining too, I think this was a gem and had fun with it no matter how silly it is, give it a chance, nice locations too, great effects, for a smaller movie it has a lot to offer!

Sure, it gets just a tiny bit ridiculous (it does seem, at times, more like a young adult adventure movie), but that's part of the fun.

7291387,3,B00ZRBQVVO,"""Big Game"" was a clever idea, and with a little editing and better, less repetitive writing could have been a great ""young adult"" film. For some reason, the writers pointed out way too often that the USA was the most powerful nation on earth. Most plot and backround stuff was not clearly explained. The relationship between the president and the kid was underdeveloped. The actors did a fine job with the script they had, and the cinematography was beautiful. Not fabulous but okay for older kids.",1446422400,,498,4.8023255813953485
7291388,3,B00ZRBQVVO,"Big Game(released Sept/14)stars,among others,Samuel L. Jackson,Onni Tommila,Felicity Huffman,Victor Garber,Ted Levine,Ray Stevenson and Jim Broadbent. I found this film to a surprisingly good dramatic romp, and newcomer Tommila acquits himself quite well throughout.
The story finds Jackson as the U.S.Prez. He is on a flight on Air Force 1(flanked by two jets)to Helsinki for a G-8 meeting. Below on the ground Tommila is a 13 year old who,as a rite of passage,is out big game hunting by himself,with just  bow and arrow in hand. He is rather shy and awkward, but admires his father and the others who have in the past,overcome the obstacles and brought back an animal to prove their worth. Also on the ground is a terrorist who is setting up his weaponry(a surface to air missile)to bring down Air Force 1. In fact on the plane the Prez`s top security man(Stevenson) is in on the plot. When the threat is detected of the missile`s below the Prez is hurried aboard his escape capsule(looking like an Apollo spacecraft).It is ejected to Earth while the other security team members don parachutes which were sabotaged and will never open. While Stevenson drops safely to Earth,the missiles pass him going upwards to blow their respective targets out of the sky.
Down on the ground Tommila sees a bright light heading his way while walking in the woods. He is soon running for his life to get out of the way as AF1 crashes into the forest,eventually landing in a nearby lake. It is shortly after recovering from that that he comes upon the Prez`s escape pod and frees him. It takes a awhile for the two to come to an understanding,but they eventually do, as the Prez comes to realize this kid is his only hope and better stick to him.
Stevenson is eventually joined by the terrorist,the son of an oil sheik,who definitely has some crews loose. They track the Prez and find him,with his young `guide`,just as THEY had found a freezer Tommila`s father had left him for his kill. The boy bravely stands his ground for a time but eventually is forced to run away,while the Prez is roughed up. He watches from behind some rocks as they stuff the Prez into the freezer and hook it up to a helicopter to air lift him out. However he makes an heroic jump onto the freezer,and in mid air he and the Prez talk about their next move. Before that can happen the crew in the chopper see the boy and drag the freezer down and through the forest to knock him off. Tommila has the presence of mind to cut the straps and the Prez and he land hard on the forest floor. Just as the chopper returns and the men come looking for them,the freezer goes on a downhill ``ski race``,landing in a lake far below;the same lake as AF1. The two hi-tail it and swim towards and into the downed aircraft. They are safe for awhile but the terrorist soon gets in and starts a bomb with a five minute timer. Within that time the Prez manages to kill the terrorist and he and the boy eject themselves from the plane`s cockpit seats. As Stevenson in the chopper comes in for the kill,Tommila fires an arrow at him. It hits his chest. While not penetrating the skin it manages to dislodge an old piece of shrapnel that had been very close to his heart from years before. He falls out of the chopper just as the bomb in AF1 explodes.
Nearby a US Navy Seal team arrives at the camp where Tommila`s father and other members of the hunting party are. While interrogating them the Prez and the boy drift harmlessly down close to their position and emerge from their seats. The boys father runs to his son`and the Prez explains just how brave a man his son actually is. Back in Washington a drama has played out behind the scenes. It seems the VP AND the CIA consultant(Graber and Broadbent)were also in on the plot to get rid of the Prez. In a washroom as the VP asks Broadbent who else knows about the plot,Broadbent replies by breaking the VP`s neck. He then verbalizes that now no one but himself knows.
As the film`s climax comes on us and Jackson explains Tommila`s bravery to his father,I found myself with a little lump in my throat. All played their parts well. The film`s action sequences are strong and it is edited well. There are some quite-not-real moments,like Jackson and Tommila`s ride in the freezer and surviving the fall into the forest, let alone the tumble down the mountainside and into the lake. Then there is the curiously silly dialogue of the Navy Seals as they spot the Prez and the boy floating on the plane cockpit seats towards their position. The one radios to headquarters that they have a UFO incoming in on their position. A UFO...seriously. They couldn`t recognize the parachutes....right.
Technically the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all a nice and enjoyable film with an unlikely pairing of a US President, and a Finnish boy on a ritual deer hunt. Under a lot of dramatic action the whole movie works well and moves well. Just do not look too closely at some of the action/plot sequences,just enjoy the overall ride. 3 1/2-4 stars.",1446336000,,5079,4.562979189485214

He has wowed us in roles like Pulp Fiction, the Avengers, Captain America, Django, The Kingsman and The Other Guys. So for me, his role in Big Game was a slight departure from what I am use to seeing from him. He was kinder and gentler, more vulnerable.

In Big Game, Jackson plays William Moore, the President of the United States. He has been betrayed and his plane shot down in the mountains of Finland. Meanwhile, thirteen -year-old Oskari (played by Onni Tommiila) is preparing to spend the night in the wilderness with only a bow & arrow.  Tradition requires that Oskari prove his worth by hunting big game and bringing it to his people. He wants his picture to adorn the wall with others from his village, like his father. What Oskari didn't realize is that he would be responsible for bringing the betrayed US President to safety while dodging a crazed killer (Morris, played by Ray Stevenson) and a rogue Secret Service Agent.

Personally, I think this is a decent movie with just enough action to hold the attention.  It isn't off the charts great, but there is a sweetness about Dear Oskari and a vulnerability about Samuel Jackson that makes you root for them both. And while predictable, there are a few plot twists and turns that keep the story moving. There are also a lot of great actors that bring the story to life including Felicity Huffman (CIA Director) and Victor Garber (Vice President).  Overall, on a lazy Sunday evening, this is worth watching. I give it 3 to 3.5 stars.",1444089600,,1603,4.626760563380282

7291472,3,B00ZRBQVVO,"Not that entertaining, and relies on a convenient event, rather than the characters coming up with a plan or doing something worthy of the whole brave hero thing the movies vibe is supposed to be all about to live.  It's based on a junior fiction book and although people die (are murdered) it stays pretty kid friendly.  Samuel of course has his mother combined with the f word catchphrase that he uses in most films but that's about it.  The most non kid friendly part of the film is all the Finish language with English subtitles at the start.  The film is supposed to be located in northern Finland which makes absolutely no sense as to why Air Force One would be flying over from whatever city it took off from on route to Helsinki, since it's not between there any other large city.

The kid who plays the main character just like how that character was a bit out of depth to be hunting on his own was a bit out of depth carrying a whole movie.  There's also some stunt scenes where he's leaping onto a freezer for example where the angle he's in the air would make him miss the freezer but the film jumps to him landing on it that was very poorly done.  It's interesting later in the film that when the American soldiers turn up they hold locals at gun point shouting orders in English when the film had established through the boy that they don't have much contact with the outside world (not knowing who the US president is) so how likely are they to speak English.  Plus where were all these soldiers for most of the film, surely there would all kinds of military support positioned to respond to Airforce One's flight plan if the thing ever went down.",1443312000,,1662,4.390879478827362

It is very much a Finnish film, and reinforces my opinion that Finnish cinema is a repertory company, with Helander at the helm. But what a quality company they are! This is a great edge of your seat action thriller, but with comedy, pride, and the interest holding quirkiness that is strong in many of Scandinavia's films. There are few actors who can hold their own opposite Samuel L. Jackson, but Onni Tommila, a rising star with a clear aptitude for comedy, action, and drama, here proved himself equal to the task!

Jackson plays the President of the USA, and is a major wimp - not at all like his other movies - and he did a fantastic job of it!

7291497,1,B00ZRBQVVO,"Great scenery, poor script, worse acting, Saturday morning cartoon-level directing. The first 15 minutes, when the plane of the POTUS is shot down, is note worthy for the utter absence of dramatic tension. The scenes of the situation room at the Pentagon are persons only barely pretending to be actors.
Various miracles occur in the first 20 minutes. The presidential pod is ejected from Air Force One and falls to earth by parachute while AFO continues to fly forward on its descent to a crash landing. Parachutes have a forward velocity of essentially 0 mph (depending on wind speed) while AFO continues forward at some 70-90% of its flight velocity. Yet the pod, upon landing, is surrounded by wreckage from the plane. The Finnish boy makes initial contact with POTUS via a paper cup/string telephone (not sure how the boy built that in the 3 minutes between opening the pod door and then speaking with the president. Plus, you will notice that the telephone still works even with a slack string. Plus the president yells out, ""Where are you"" when it is obvious: just follow the string. And then, even though we are in a very remote area of Finland (judging by the clothing of the tribe/village elders accompanying the boy on his rite of passage), the boy speaks excellent colloquial English, nearly free of accent. Happy happenstance for later communication with POTUS??!!
Later on, terrorists transport the president in a freezer box (but without the compressor) in order to keep the president ""fresh"" for later taxidermy work. Seems more practical to me just to put the president in the helicopter and save all that extra weight. However, the boy jumps on the freezer box just as the helicopter is ready to take flight in order to save the president. Only after some 10 minutes plus of flight does the chopper pilot notice the extra weight (not sure how as the weight was there from the beginning of the flight) of the boy. So they drag the freezer box with boy and president through the forest in order to knock the boy off. Problems: 1) why would the boy not join the president inside the open box rather than hanging outside to the cables, 2) flying at some 60-80 mph through the trees, the box hitting the trees with rather smash the box and president, or, more likely, 3) the trees would snag the box and pull the helicopter into a crash.
At this point, the extreme foolish of the plot, the lousy script, made me give up.",1442620800,,2433,4.686915887850467

7291550,3,B00ZRBQVVO,"Big Game is a sort of Air Force One meets Die Hard: With a Vengeance, but don't expect big action set-pieces. In this Finnish action movie, Samuel L. Jackson is a US president William Allan Moore, who has to team up with a 13-year-old local boy named Oskari (Onni Tommila) to survive when Air Force One is shot down in Finland.

Big Game has beautiful landscapes of Bavaria (not Finland where the story takes place), as well as interesting supporting players including Jim Broadbent, Felicity Huffman, Victor Garber, Ted Levine and Ray Stevenson, but most of them are sadly wasted.

But what about action? Well, it depends on what you expect from the film. This is Finnish director Jalmari Helanders sophomore effort, following his cult debut Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale (which also features Onni Tommila). Helander has a rather twisted, low-key sense of humor that matches the 1980s-ish, old-fashioned buddy-buddy film concept, but this kind of humor is not exactly what we expect from Samuel L. Jackson, who looks more like bored than low-keyed.

Not a terrible film, but there is something missing in Big Game.",1441756800,,1116,4.957219251336898

7291578,3,B00ZRBQVVO,"I can't really say that I was expecting great things from this, but I was intrigued by what looked like a fun trailer. It's too bad that pretty much every good moment was spoiled in said trailer. In BIG GAME, Samuel L. Jackson plays the President of the United States, who is on his way to a conference in Finland. At the same time, a young Finnish boy is in the middle of a rite of passage that will assure his reputation in a community of hunters. The president ends up with the boy after his plane is downed, hijinks ensue, etc. There's really not much going on in the plot at all. Even though the performances were solid, most of the actors seemed bored, like this was just a paycheck to them. And others, e.g. Jim Broadbent, were completely wasted in small roles that amounted to little more than exposition. As for the action, there were some decent explosions and a pretty good, if brief, fight scene between the President and a terrorist, but otherwise is woefully short on even that. To the film's credit, there was a nice message about taking a stand for one's self and making your own way in the world, but it wasn't really treated with enough depth to make it worth it. At best, the film plays out like a literalized hunting metaphor that might appeal to the less-demanding viewer, but the fact that it's in service of an obvious Obama stand-in will probably turn a lot of those same viewers off. For what it's worth, I didn't hate myself for watching this, nor do I feel like I wasted the money to rent it, but this is certainly not one I'd pay full price to add to my collection. It has its moments, but to really get full enjoyment out of it (what little there is), don't watch the trailer beforehand.",1441411200,,1716,4.382445141065831

7291587,4,B00ZRBQVVO,"This movie sounds fun, but it feels a bit forced at times. And I think Samuel L. Jackson was miscast. He does show a softer side, but i didn't quite feel the parental chemistry that producers must have been hoping for when they cast him opposite a kid. I give it 4 stars because it's worth a watch and will definitely appeal to kids and teens. Adults will probably not want to purchase it, unless they are a Samuel L. Jackson fan and collect all his stuff.

It looked like a film commission movie from Norway.  The pace was slow and the story undeveloped.  The complete lack of any attempt to be realistic was lost.  US forces having an armada of helicopters on foreign soil sent in by our situation room that could not track a plane and generals that just hung their heads low while civilians yelled at them.

Poor quality acting and obviously a poor under developed script killed what little it offers. I would not waste more then a red box dollar on this forgettable attempt of an action movie.

I found the plot simplistic but wonderfully refreshing...and will never understand what's in the mind of any Producer who believes that re-making an existing movie will entice anyone to come back to a known plot, used script and way past its prime theme (Fantastic Four and Spider Man to name just two recent remake duds).

The acting was so dreadful you can't really connect to a single character, even the little boy. Samuel L Jackson plays a POTUS who seems to have about two brain cells. Its just straight-out pitiful.

Fortunately he is shoved into his escape pod by a turncoat Secret Service agent over Finland. Good thing it wasn't over Iran. The president lands in a hunting preserve where a Finish boy of 13, undergoing his graduation into manhood, is hunting and killing  local large native animals, big game. To his surprise he isn't having much luck until he stumbles upon the President (""of the United States"") and bags himself a first-class world leader. Who thinks up this stuff????

Perfect movie for the pre-teen and teenager in your family. The young (Finnish) boy in the movie steals the show - he played his part beautifully.  Don't know who he is, but he was perfect.  You find yourself rooting for him more so than Samuel Jackson who plays the POTUS.

One reviewer said is was worthy of Steven Spielberg or Michael Bay.  Not even close.  More like Jackie Chan or John Woo.  It was that beyond belief.  The Europeans who put this crap together didn't even bother with any research.  They have the United States awarding the Medal of Honor to a 13-year-old Finnish Laplander.  The Medal of Honor is a purely military decoration that by law can't be awarded outside of the US Armed Forces.  The highest civilian award the US can bestow (and it can be awarded to foreigners) is the Medal of Freedom.  And that was merely the most minor goof in this movie that you.  It gets far, far worse.  You have to suspend a large degree of disbelief in most action movies, but this one stretches the viewers tolerance waaaay beyond the breaking point.

My twelve year old son and I glanced at each other repeatedly as if to say 'you gotta be kidding me'.  The only redeeming quality is that they wrapped up this foolishness in a bow in 90 minutes.  Guess Samuel L. Jackson needed a paycheck.,1438128000,,332,4.576271186440678

7291803,1,B00ZRBQVVO,"Beautiful scenery but the movie was a boring B-Movie--which I downgraded to a F-Movie. I turned it off after awhile because it was lame...very lame.  Additionally, I turned the movie off because of the following reasons:  The movie player Amazon is currently using is ""buggy.""  That is, it falsely determined that my computer system (Windows 7 Ultimate) and/or graphics card (NVidia GeForce GTX660) were not Blu-ray capable because there was no HDCP status.
Likewise, initially, the movie played in a Blu-ray (HD) format then the Amazon movie player crashed...then, after several attempts to get the movie playing again, the movie player only wanted to play the movie in a SD format relative to the false ""no HDCP"" status.  However, my computer it perfectly capable of playing Blu-ray movie disks because I play them often.  Also, I can play HD (1920 X 1080) movies downloaded from iTunes.  Hence, it is highly unlikely that I will view anymore movies from Amazon's Instant Video service.
Here are some additional issues I had with Amazon Instant video:  ""Will not play in Firefox browser unless Adobe Flash Player is enabled.""  Error message says ""Microsoft Silver Light is not available"" even though the latest version is installed on my computer.  Furthermore, once I got Flash Player working, it shows the movie with artifacts; and, the video seemed to be slow or somewhat jerky.

A young teenager is sent out to the wild to hunt a deer or bear as a right of passage for his dad's hunting club.

7291969,4,B00ZRBQVVO,"If Steven Spielberg, Michael Bay, and Tim Burton collaborated on an Amblin-style adventure with rocket launchers it might look something like Big Game. There's an over-the-top ludicrousness manufactured for maximum silliness by Finnish director Jalmari Helander (Rare Exports), employing a veritable army unit of recognizable American actors with one mini-Rambo of a kid hero. There's nothing to be taken seriously here at all, which is why Big Game turns out to be such big fun.

This is the perfect kind of loud, garish genre flick for somebody like Samuel L. Jackson, who gets plenty of craziness to chew on as William Moore, the floundering President of the United States. Here's a solid tip for any POTUS: It's never a good idea to piss off a Secret Service agent who is willing to take a bullet for you, but that's what he's done and now Morris (Ray Stevenson) has set in motion a revenge plot. Forcing Air Force One to crash land in the deeply forested Finnish mountains, Morris and a big-game-hunting terrorist plan to kill the POTUS and literally mount him on the wall.

What they weren't counting on was 13-year-old Oskari (Onni Tommila), and he's a Spielbergian child protagonist if there ever was one. He comes from a long line of accomplished hunters and seeks to gain his father's respect during a day-long rite of passage all alone in the woods. To return home empty-handed would be an embarrassment to his entire family. So this becomes a story about Oskari's need to prove himself as a man by helping the POTUS survive crashes, getting beat up, gunfire, near-drowning, and more, all with his trusty little bow and arrow. And Helander pulls out every play in the '80s action movie playbook. It's like he's been copying Renny Harlin's homework or something, and that includes the terrible dialogue drowned out by a bevy of explosions. With so many intentional cliches there aren't any surprises to be found here, except for the gaggle of talent Helander was able to assemble. Watching ineffectually from the Pentagon (which looks like a basement) are the Vice President (Victor Garber), the CIA chief (Felicity Huffman), a General (Ted Levine), and a brainy adviser (Jim Broadbent) who knows way too much to be totally innocent.

But is Helander actually trying to say something about all of the action flicks he's referencing? It doesn't seem like it, and too often he's simply going through the motions rather than pushing the story forward. However it's hard to stay mad at any film that allows Jackson to play a wuss in need of rescue by a child. Clearly on a budget, the special effects won't impress anybody but they're kind of endearingly cheap and enjoyable. That's pretty much what we can say about Big Game as a whole, and at barely 90 minutes it knows when to wrap up its prey and go home.",1435968000,13,2815,4.81198347107438
7291970,4,B00ZRBQVVO,"I enjoyed this movie. It is what it is, a good lower budget movie that surprised me. It was actually entertaining. There have been so many, rebooted, rehashed, big blockbuster and over hyped movies, retread sequels, and part 3 and part 4s  lately that have been worse than the first, lackluster, and disappointing, it was refreshing to see something in the action vein that at least tried to do something with some original flare. Yes, narrow escapes and saves are somewhat over the top but it is an fiction, action movie. The plot is somewhat standard but the movie is well done, entertaining and fun. It is a movie an adult could enjoy our a family as well. The cast and crew all do a good job and effects are good for a lower budget movie.

It's just that he's not very good at it. President Moore (Samuel L. Jackson) is about to enter a complex attempt on his life. The two cross paths deep in Finland's craggy woods, one step ahead of the terrorist team after the president.

It's true, Oskari isn't worth beans with a bow and arrow. He's still smart, tough, brave, and completely at home in this brutal landscape. And, like any teenage boy, a bit cocky, and out to make the most of it when he's in a position to give orders to the president of the US. As an adventure flick, it works pretty well. I found a good few laugh-out-loud moments, too, not pasted-on gags but the genuine humor in a boy's life, the lkind that only he can't see. Maybe not one for the ages, it's still popcorn-worthy enough for me.

7291993,5,B00ZRBQVVO,"What a fun surprise this movie was! I hadn't even heard of it but Samuel Jackson in a movie is pretty much guaranteed to be a good time.

I don't know what people expect from movies these days that they would call it terrible or leave one star ratings but my husband and I really loved it. Is it 100% plausible? Noooo...it's fiction, not a documentary. It's a sad world for people who need to over analyze everything they watch. It just saps all the enjoyment right out of the whole experience!

Grab some popcorn and get comfy and get ready to just be entertained. There are good guys and bad guys and action and heart along with some fun because, of course, it's Samuel Jackson. It's clean enough for the whole family to watch and it won't be the blockbuster hit of your summer, but we came away from it feeling like we'd had a great movie night. :)",1435536000,78,851,4.3125
7291994,5,B00ZRBQVVO,"It's so bad it's worth watching... The plot is absurd.... you will asks questions like how does a freezer with a generator get on top of a remote mountain?  If you eject from a plane traveling 400 mph and the plane crashes shortly there after,  how do you land in the same spot as the crash scene? Be prepared to laugh. ..",1435536000,5,322,4.17741935483871

7292002,5,B00ZRBQVVO,"This was a really good movie. The kid in the movie is badass. Where ever this film was made is beautiful. The mountains and trees-wow.
If your expecting one a typical Samuel L. Jackson film, this isn't it. This is more of a kids movie. Not to violent, cool action scenes and pretty cool story line.",1435363200,20,298,4.339285714285714

7292006,1,B00ZRBQVVO,i was really disappointed.  the movie as far as it went was ok but the movie had sort of a cliffhanger at the end with 8 minutes left on the feature.  i watched all 8 minutes hoping for the clean up and it never happened.  the scenery was fabulous but i could have gotten that from a travel show.,1435363200,,296,3.983050847457627
7292007,1,B00ZRBQVVO,"Awful movie. If the makers are going for B status, they should say so from the onset. Finland does not have rugged mountains such as these shown in the film. There are multiple incinsistecies from one frame to the next. Why would SLJ ever choose to align his talents with such a script and movie? Does someone have pictures of him in a less than favorable predicament?",1435363200,3,368,4.507462686567164

7292011,4,B00ZRBQVVO,"Samuel L. Jackson plays the POTUS. He is considered a feckless leader in the war on terror and as such, those who oppose the terrorists have planned to kill him. His plane is shot down over the mountains of Finland. At the same time Oskari (Onni Tommila) turned 13 and is going to become a man by hunting big game. He is alone in the woods with a bow and and about four arrows. He barely has the strength to pull back the bow. He rescues the POTUS from his escape pod and the two of them are on the run for their lives.

The film was okay. I was hoping the kid would do some Rambo/Home Alone type stuff, i.e. set traps etc. but it didn't happen. The film is basically kid safe. At one point Samuel L. Jackson says ""Mother F"" and stops short of completing the phrase. 3 1/2 stars.",1435276800,,779,4.091503267973856

8720768,5,B00ZRBQVVO,"This is one of those overlooked gems.  It's a story that's geared for a younger audience.  But it's mature enough that anyone could enjoy it.

If you're looking for a ""family flick"", this should fit the bill.  No cussing, bare breasts or other body parts.  Just a clean, fun movie.  Not a comedy, but some of the dialog between the principles will put a smile on your face.  And, not to worry.  There's more than enough action to satisfy anyone.  And all of it, not the usual .... blast everything on the screen out of existence either.  And that ""freezer"".  All I can say is they don't build 'em like they did in the past.

The interactions and relationship that develops between the president ( Jackson ) and Oskari ( young male lead ) is really fun to watch.  There's more than enough story line and plot to satisfy folks of all generations.

And the MOUNTAIN VIEWS and scenery are just out of this world.  If you like mountains and magnificent views, watch it just for that.  Not filmed in Finland, where it's supposed to be taking place.  The director needed/wanted mind boggling scenery and filmed the outdoor scenes in the  Austrian Alps.

A enjoyable winner for me.  I like the story, actors, and locations.

Buy it used or new .... you probably won't regret it.",1532908800,,1270,4.530973451327434
