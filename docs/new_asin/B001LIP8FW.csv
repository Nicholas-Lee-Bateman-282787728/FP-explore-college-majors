8318200,3,B001LIP8FW,"It's difficult to write a review on this because there are two things to consider.  First, the quality of the product itself.  This DVD is not very long, and its overall quality is average.  The editing isn't very good, the voice-over is occasionally drowned out by background noise and there is also a good amount of 'filler'.  To be frank, it all seems a bit amateur.  The producer, Mr Chip Croft, would be well served by taking his original video tapes, digitising them and then re-editing and re-issuing the whole presentation.

The second thing to consider is the material itself.  Despite the 1983 Americas Cup races being historic - this was the first time the United States had lost the cup in 132 years - there is very little visual material available.  There is the 1984 released 'Aussie Assault' which has only ever been available on VHS video (not DVD), and the two part 'Australian Story' presentation screened by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in early 2013.  Thus, this DVD is only the third visual presentation of this event.  As such it offers some unique footage which I certainly had never seen before.  For that reason alone this DVD has value.  It also has an interview with the helmsman of Australia II, John Bertrand, which I had also never seen before.

So, if you are a random person, this DVD probably has no worth for you.  If you are a sailor or perhaps have a general interest in the Americas Cup, it might be a worthwhile buy.  But, if you are an Australian who remembers with deep fondness and pride that early morning in late September 1983, then this DVD may very well be a must.",1412812800,2,1627,4.63986013986014
8318201,1,B001LIP8FW,"If you want an excellent documentary on the 1983 America's Cup either purchase The Aussie Aussault or The 25th Defense. The ""Special 25th Anniversary Edition"" was not very special.  Although it contained footage not in the two documentaries I recommended, the footage it contains is amaturish.",1236384000,5,293,5.369565217391305
