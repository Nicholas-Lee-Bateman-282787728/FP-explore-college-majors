8051174,5,B0007SV720,"Show #1: From the fall of 1975, Carol boasts entertainment icon Cher as guest. Included: A duet between a famed concert pianist (Harvey) & his protegee (Tim) erupts into war; Carol & Cher sing about ""prime time ladies""; Cher sings solo; a well-to-do husband (Harvey) prepares to leave his sophisticated wife (Cher) for a frumpy looking woman (Carol); a string of commercial spoofs; another chapter of ""As the Stomach Turns"" spoofs the Warren Beatty movie ""Shampoo"" (Harvey gets the biggest laughs in his ""Mother Marcus"" drag); and a wild musical finale saluting rock group acts.
Show #2: From the fall of 1977, frequent guest Ken Berry appears. And in this volume, the great Dick Van Dyke is finally seen in action during his brief stint as a regular. Included: Mr. Tudball (Tim) tries to paint the office, and gets no help from scatter-brained assistant Mrs. Wiggins (Carol); Ken and the Ernest Flatt dancers in a musical number about mail-order brides in the Old West; a once-famous concert pianist (Dick), now fallen on hard times, asks his wife (Carol) to injure his hands in order to cash in on an insurance policy, with painful results; and a movie parody called ""Stolen Serenade"" has a performing trio broken up (literally) when one of them (Dick) leaves his partners (Vicki, Ken) to join a prima donna big-time performer (Carol) which turns him into a miserable lush. A plot twist has Dick leaving Carol to rejoin his partners, and they suddenly become a smash hit while Carol's career hits the skids!
Just the rare appearance of Cher & Van Dyke's comedy work alone make this volume a valuable must for the Burnett collection!",1253750400,,1634,4.860215053763441
