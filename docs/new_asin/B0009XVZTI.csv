8070458,5,B0009XVZTI,"Great videos and behind the scenes not usually seen stuff. The live by request concert is intimate and great. Sort of like ""unplugged"". A great thing for fans to get more Toby.",1344211200,2,176,4.53125
8070459,5,B0009XVZTI,"If you're a Toby Keith fan, you need to own this DVD. If you're not, it's a good introduction to why the man is one of the most successful artists of today. The live concert is intimate and scaled down with just three other musicians on set. He answers some aduience questions and plays requests and his beautiful and moving performance of 'You Leave Me Weak' is worth every cent you pay for the DVD. It's incredible to see him sing something so personal. The bio has some great footage and photos that I'd never seen before and the video for Beer For My Horses, his duet with Willie Nelson, is also on there.

A DVD to treasure and watch again and again!",1261785600,5,655,4.32520325203252
8070460,5,B0009XVZTI,"This DVD is a must for any Toby Keith fan.  There are 3 selections to choose from. You can watch the making of 'Beer For My Horses', Toby Keith Unleased Concert or CMT's Toby Keith's ' Raise to Fame'. It is so engaging and sincerely displays 'the real Toby'. There is just something so unique, geniune and likable about Toby Keith, THE PERSON. I'm not a country music fan per say, but I LOVE TOBY KEITH's music. the guy is a genius when it comes to his song writing abilities and his strong musculine singing voice. He's the kind of person you want to welcome into your circle of friends. The DVD is around 2 hours long and is totally engrossing and enjoyable. If you like Toby Keith, you will love this DVD.",1125792000,23,708,4.323308270676692
