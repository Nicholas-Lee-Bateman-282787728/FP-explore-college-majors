7113538,4,B00VX21SPA,I thought it was a very interesting  and captivating story,1431734400,,58,4.8
7113539,5,B00VX21SPA,We just saw Diplomacy at the Louisiana International Film Festival and it was our favorite out of the entire four days of films. The acting is superb. One of those films where you forget it is a movie and you feel like you are in the room with them discussing the possible destruction of Paris. We are going to purchase the USA format DVD for our movie library. This is one you will want to buy and keep. Highly recommend.,1431561600,3,422,4.2875

7113541,5,B00VX21SPA,"A the creation of a director too little seen in this country, ""Diplomacy"" was barely distributed here outside of a few art theaters in major metro areas (read New York and LA).  This film definitely deserved to be seen by a far wider audience.  It addresses a mystery that has continued to baffle historians of the Second World War - why were Hitler's orders to level Paris disobeyed following the Normandy landings as the Germans retreated.  A drama, not a documentary, ""Diplomacy"" offers a plausible scenario with dramatic punch, and the performances uniformly live up to the occasion.  Succeeding generations owe a debt of gratitude, however Hitler's intentions may have been thwarted.",1431388800,5,688,5.116071428571429

7113545,5,B00VX21SPA,Very insight story about liberation of Paris and saving the city from destruction.,1461024000,,82,5.384615384615385
7113546,2,B00VX21SPA,"If you're making a historical movie about a major event, you need to make it exciting and credible. Diplomacy trips up right from the start and never recovers. The challenge about telling the story of what happened when the German commander of Paris was told to blow up the city in 1944 is simple - we know Paris survived unscathed. So how do you make a compelling film about that? Diplomacy is clearly a stage play shoehorned onto the screen without much thought or imagination. A mysterious Swedish businessman miraculously appears in the office of the commander the night before the planned destruction and basically bores the German (and the audience) to tears by asking him time and time again whether he wants to go down in history as the man who ruined one of the world's finest cities. Throw in some ill-advised and historically dubious gunplay and you have the indigestible lump that is Diplomacy. This one is a yawner.",1455494400,,928,4.770186335403727
7113547,5,B00VX21SPA,"Absolutely loved this, even though I typically don't go for foreign-language movies.  Brilliant dialog, fascinating premise, wonderfully acted.",1453248000,,143,6.944444444444445
7113548,5,B00VX21SPA,"If you don't mind subtitles this is a really great movie.  I happen to understand both German and French, so it was easy for me.  Very few errors in translation.",1449014400,,161,4.333333333333333
7113549,5,B00VX21SPA,"Saw in in a theater just yesterday. The plot is simplicity itself. General von Choltitz (Niels Arestrup) the newly appointed German governor of Paris, is charged by Hitler with a task of total destruction of the city with most of its population. Raoul Nordling (Andr Dussollier), the Swedish consul in Paris, attempts to convince Choltitz at the last moment to disobey his orders and save the city with its inhabitants. The movie is really a filmed theater performance, and has been indeed adapted from a play. Except for a few forays out of Choltitz's hotel headquarters, all the movie happens in camera and is distilled into a dialog between the two men. In essence it seems to begin as a conflict between blind obedience and ruthlessness and humanity and culture. As the drama progresses, both men are revealed to be different from their stereotypes and the conflicts acquire additional dimensions. The claustrophobic setting of the drama requires tight work of the director and the camera, of which they acquit themselves with distinction. Arestrup as Choltitz is excellent. Dussolier, although an accomplished actor, seems to be less convincing. I am not sure if those were the director's intentions, but my sympathy veered more towards Choltitz than Nordling. Notwithstanding all the good things I have to say about the movie (and there are many that I don't mention here) it fails to achieve a masterpiece distinction. Unlike the Downfall or The Mission, it does not convey the intensity of the drama and the verbiage borders on an academic discussion of morality versus duty. On my absolute scale  slightly over four stars, but compared to the often senseless and frantic action-packed trash that sells so well nowadays, it deserves full five stars.",1448841600,3,1757,5.079584775086505
7113550,5,B00VX21SPA,First saw this film at an independent film festival and loved it! It was a different angle to the Hollywood movie Paris is Burning. Very dynamic story between 2 men that changed the course of history,1448064000,,199,4.555555555555555
7113551,4,B00VX21SPA,A part of history to impoortant to miss. Well acted with goood captionis in English,1448064000,,83,4.6
7113552,5,B00VX21SPA,"I AM VERY INTERETING IN THE THEME SO I BOUGHT THE FILM, BUT I THINK IS BETTER BY FAR "" IS PARIS BURNING?""",1447977600,,105,3.608695652173913
7113553,5,B00VX21SPA,"Amazing true story and beautifully dramatized.  So simple, yet so moving.",1446422400,,73,5.636363636363637
7113554,4,B00VX21SPA,"This film dealt with the question of whether to destroy Paris or not. This was a very hard decision based on the facts that Berlin was bombed out and most of Germany was destroyed by vicious and immoral men whose hate blinded them to compassion and Christian values when confronting the enemy and as the Master had said, ""Love your enemies and do good unto them. Bless them that curse you..."" The German General could have chosen the low ground and obeyed Hitler but he chose the high. Morality will always be superior to ""just following orders excuse."" I see and hear this weak, evil, devilish excuse often and think to myself that the one who obeys an immoral order is the worst of mankind. To be moral and noble requires letting the good thought or result of my actions override the evil And harm I would cause. I greatly admire men like this fine German General's moral correct choice. The world can still visit old Paris as it was instead of destroyed rubble.",1445558400,,964,4.545977011494253
7113555,5,B00VX21SPA,"A character-driven gem of essentially 2 men in a room, with immense consequences.",1444348800,,81,5.3076923076923075

7113562,4,B00VX21SPA,"Did not know this story of the final days of German occupation of Paris at the close of WWII. Good script, acting, directing and filming. The fundamentals to the story seem to be truthfully portrayed in this dramatization except for those parts dealing with saving the family (ring scenes) of the German officer assigned to oversee the implementation of the explosives.

Four stars because it would have been useful to viewers to be given information as to what was researched to be true and what was added fiction. Might have been better to have the personalities of both the General and the Swedish consul be more accurately portrayed.",1437868800,,637,4.898148148148148
7113563,5,B00VX21SPA,Fascinating projection of what was said in a historic crisis that saved Paris! Wonderfully acted with high production values.,1437436800,,125,5.631578947368421
7113564,5,B00VX21SPA,"Adolf Hitler's purported goal was to enhance Mankind.  Yet, faced with the defeat of his Reich chasing his troops back to Germany, he, in his spite, sought to destroy one of the things on this planet that did enhance Mankind--The City of Light, Paris, France.  What is more, he threatened severe reprisals to the families of any of his army who failed to carry out his decree.  He was determined to render Paris, that is, The Eiffel Tower, The Arch of Triumph, Notre Dame, The Place de la Concorde, The Louvre to the approaching Allies as rubble by using planted explosives.  What he had on his side were three things:  the overwhelming emotional force within many Germans to follow orders, whether agreed with or not, the threat to the families of disobedient officers and the idea that other great cities in the past had been destroyed in wars; why should Paris be spared?  This from the man whose troops had so joyously ridden through The Arc de Triomphe just years earlier.  (A grim lesson for all countries contemplating the acquiescense of accept with occupation by a foreign force.)  This traps the general-in-charge, General Choltitz, portrayed like a charismatic steel rod with a hint of  hidden humanity by Niels Aestrup, into following the pointless, stupid orders given him by the Fuhrer.  His antagonist, Raul Nordling, the Swedish consul-general, painted with a delicate brush by actor Andre Dussolier,  must find a way in his diplomatic dialogue with the general to guide him around the orders that center his soul and the lives of his wife and three children and not destroy Paris.  it comes down to:  what is more important, the safety and well being of his loved ones or the glory of Man's great gifts to the world?  There are no explosions. no Seine River flooding of Paris.  The drama and electricity happen between these two men and they are surrounded by a superb ensemble of actors, directed with exquisite discipline by Volker Schlondorff to create a masterful cinematic experience.",1435968000,3,2006,4.876106194690266
7113565,5,B00VX21SPA,"I was already very familiar with the story of how Paris was (miraculously, imho) saved from the worst sort of destruction in the final months of WW2 but I was curious to see how this movie played it out.
I was not disappointed.
Everything about it was simply superb.  The casting, the acting, the sets (so mindful of a play which is natural since the movie was adapted from a play), the captivating cinematography, the editing----- to mention what immediately comes to mind.
I recommend this to all Second World War history buffs and particularly to the younger generation.",1434931200,,573,4.787878787878788
7113566,5,B00VX21SPA,"Volker Schlndorff's gives us yet another masterpiece in his 2014 film ""Diplomacy."" It tells an incredible story about the last days of the Nazi occupation of Paris. Roughly 80% of the film is conversation between the General Dietrich von Cholitz, the military commander of the city, who had been ordered to completely destroy it, and a Francophile Swedish diplomat, Raoul Nordling, who argues for its survival. Set during the uprising led by the Forces Francaises de l'Intrieur (the military structure of the French Resistance), and as Patton's U.S. Third Army and General LeClerc's 2nd French Armoured Division approached the city outskirts, this is nonetheless more a film of ideas than action. It's about the betrayal of ideals, standards, and allegiances. It's about definitions of guilt and responsibility. It tells a remarkable tale and is well worth watching.",1434067200,,866,5.328467153284672
7113567,5,B00VX21SPA,Beautifully done. An old style film based on the conversation of just two characters about the fate of Paris in WW2.,1433808000,,116,4.571428571428571
7113568,5,B00VX21SPA,A great piece of filmmaking ! Highly recommended.,1433635200,,49,5.25
7113569,5,B00VX21SPA,this is an excellent movie and the actors did a great job making the characters believable and interesting,1433030400,,106,4.944444444444445
7113570,3,B00VX21SPA,"Only for a few art lovers. Most of the film takes place in a generals office where dialogue reigns Its mainly a conversation between a Diplomat and a General. Very little action except at the end. I didn't know the story, which is based on fact.",1432080000,,245,4.3478260869565215
7113571,5,B00VX21SPA,"I loved this movie - the two leads were mesmerizing. Such intrigue and suspense that I wasn't sure I knew the outcome until the very end.

I can't believe how we take for granted that Paris was spared the description of what might have happened had it not been for two men who struggled with their own convictions.

I wish this movie had better distribution.",1431734400,2,358,4.492307692307692
8711596,5,B00VX21SPA,This is a well acted movie that looks at the efforts to save Paris in 1944 from destruction on the orders of Hitler. It is a nice compliment to the much older Is Paris Burning? But unlike that film which has a more broader perspective this film focuses on the discussions that took place between General Von Cholitz and the Swedeish envoy Nordling. This is a passionate and engaging dialogue based film. Overall a very well done production.,1530835200,,440,4.653846153846154
8711597,5,B00VX21SPA,"Very loosely based on historical events; Hitler ordered his troops to completely level Paris with bombs before they withdraw. The general in charge of the Wehrmacht garrison had his men placed all the explosives but never ordered the detonation to take place. It's really just a brilliant play about what is humanity. For a movie that is essentially just dialogue between two old men, it's surprisingly gripping. The end of the movie, a long shot of a camera panning back from the Pont Neuf to show Paris,  is tremendously emotional when you consider what could have been, what would have been, had Hitler's order been carried out.",1499731200,,631,4.897196261682243
8711598,5,B00VX21SPA,"This is an excellent film!  I am a history buff.  If you are not, you are still going to like this film.  It is an incredible story!",1495756800,,132,3.814814814814815

8711601,5,B00VX21SPA,I loved this movie. Such an amazing true story that is not often told. I now want to buy it for a gift to be watched in Mexico. Anybody knows if it comes with subtitles in Spanish?,1476835200,,180,3.891891891891892
8711602,5,B00VX21SPA,Slow start with subtitles but picks up and hooks you. Never thought I would feel empathy for Nazi Germany...,1476489600,,108,4.7368421052631575
8711603,5,B00VX21SPA,"Absolutely superior film. I don't know why it didn't get a million awards. Quite true to history, to the extent that we know it. Great psychological drams. In fact, now that I'm reminded of it, I'm going to watch it again!",1470268800,,222,4.439024390243903
