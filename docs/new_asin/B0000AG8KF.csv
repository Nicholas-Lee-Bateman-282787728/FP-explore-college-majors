8273939,5,B0000AG8KF,"Unfortunately, I've been unable to obtain a Region 1 copy of this dvd (with english subtitles / dubbed). Amazon has item listed as Region 1, but after ordering it...I received Region 2 (now having to return item to Germany). Does anyone know where to obtain a Region 1 copy of this film?!?! I would prefer it on Blu-ray (as with all animation), but I can't even find a Region 1 DVD copy of the damn thing.

From what I can tell (watching this on Youtube), it has an interesting story and beautiful 2D animation. I would love to add it to my collection!!!  Unfortunately, this title, as with many other titles from Europe (Gandahar, Technotise, etc) never see the light of day in the U.S. market.  I'm not certain exactly why that is...but it's most frustrating. Thanks to ""Gkids"" a few titles have been trickling down the pipeline...such as ""A Cat In Paris,"" ""Chico and Rita,"" ""The Secret of Kells,"" and ""The Rabbi's Cat."" I, as well as many others.  I would very much like to see more European animated titles available in U.S. I would like to own ""The Rain Children"" and numerous other titles!",1406678400,,1095,4.571428571428571
