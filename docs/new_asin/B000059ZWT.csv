1410220,5,B000059ZWT,"Tremendous thanks to Amazon.com for making available at last the admittedly terrible Dennis Hopper biker film ""The Glory Stompers"" on widescreen DVD-R.  Fine print on the case reveals that the release was licensed by MGM, 20th Century Fox, and Orion Pictures, and manufactured in Kentucky, USA.  Clearly lots of work went into releasing this nostalgic classic at last, so I hope fellow film fans will reward Amazon's efforts (and themselves) by buying this long-awaited treasure.",1327190400,2,479,5.373333333333333
1410221,5,B000059ZWT,"This a great old Hooper biker movie. I watched it years ago. Unfortunatly when I finally found it and thought I had the opportunity to purchase it Amazon screwed my order up. They advertised a seller that they have discontinued. They have charged me for the item and as of the seller they say they can no longer access their account. My advise, buyer beware of everything you buy here.",1228176000,2,385,4.514285714285714
1410222,2,B000059ZWT,"This turkey about rival biker gangs (featuring Dennis Hopper during his Easy Rider phase) was noteworthy for performances by Hopper, Jock Mahoney and Casey Kasem, but afterward they probably wished they'd never gotten involved with it.",1088294400,3,235,5.555555555555555
1410223,1,B000059ZWT,"This is really bad. Luckily, like 'The Annihilators' (worst film ever), it's so good it's bad.
  Dennis Hopper is bad, the bikes are bad, the extras are bad, the script is bad, the fights are bad... and 'Easy Rider' was just around the corner!
  Why do we still get a kick out of this stuff?",1028937600,2,291,4.236363636363636
1410224,3,B000059ZWT,"Oh, this biker movie is awful, you know it and I know it. But it recalls a time when films like this were completely shot on location (meaning the highways and deserts of CA) and it was easy enough to hire club members as extras, before the clubs became as sophisticated (well, relatively), wealthy and well-organized and even media-conscious as they are today. The plot is simple: evil biker Hopper, in full semi-articulate stoner mode (yes, like he always is, either onscreen or probably in real life) kidnaps ""good"" (well, relatively, he has a bigger, more jutting jaw, looks a bit more clear-eyed) biker Jody McCrea's girl, intending to sell her in Mexico. And McCrea (son of Joel, here taking a rest from his dimwit turns in all those Frankie-Annette beach movies) pursues. They fight, they snarl, they even spit at each other. And the bright, clear primary colors are appropriately blood-drenched. It's easily as ""good"" as your average pretentious foreign film of the period, in other words, and it never, ever stops to make a bit of sense. Love those 60's!",993772800,14,1063,4.846153846153846
1410225,4,B000059ZWT,"This biker movie was one of many biker films that were produced and popular in the late 60s and early 70s, due primarily with Roger Corman's ""The Wild Angels"" with Peter Fonda. Dennis Hopper went on later to star, produce and direct the cult classic ""Easy Rider"" with Peter Fonda. ""The Glory Stompers"" is one of the best biker films made, primarily because it starred Dennis Hopper. Although ""The Glory Stompers"" was entertaining, it was not in the same league as ""Easy Rider"" which, of course, was directed by Dennis Hopper. ""The Glory Stompers"" is not a great film, but a good film because of the acting of Dennis Hopper. Don't forget that Robert Tessier, who played in many biker films including ""The Born Losers"" with Tom Laughlin in the role of Billy Jack, does a fine job as one of the gang members. Very entertaining, so get the popcorn with plenty of butter ready, and slide in this DVD into the DVD player and have some fun.",1399507200,2,933,4.559523809523809
1410226,4,B000059ZWT,"Good 60's biker movie. Decent story, good seen old pans, and knuckleheads again. Hoppers good in this flick. I'd recommend if ya like the old biker movies.",1397433600,2,155,4.777777777777778
1410227,5,B000059ZWT,Now this is an old school biker movies good idea 4 the bike designing old school for picture quality is very good and so was the sound so so buy it,1383523200,,147,3.774193548387097
1410228,3,B000059ZWT,"Not the best story or quality but, hay, its an old movie on a low budget. I like all biker movies but prob not for your average movie goer.",1378684800,,139,3.8275862068965516
1410229,1,B000059ZWT,"Compared to Hells Angels on wheels this move is a real stinked. Highlight: Dennis Hopper, here is another acto that proved his worth in future films",1373328000,,148,4.730769230769231
1410230,4,B000059ZWT,This is a good drive-in movie biker flick. Dennis Hopper as the leader of a gang of outlaw bikers  is a little different since he is normaly the costar. A good movie to add to your biker movie collection....worth the money.,1356480000,3,223,4.439024390243903
1410231,5,B000059ZWT,"I really get a kick out of the older biker movies, i remember when i was young staying up half the night waiting for one to come on, the glory stompers was one of my favorites,",1355443200,2,176,3.9166666666666665
1410232,3,B000059ZWT,"Dennis Hopper is probably the best actor in a rather lame motorcycle classic. To much lovy dovy and a rather lacking luster concept of
what these Bikers really are all about. I think it's a hastily concerted script. Technical aspects are not very good. Can't recommend it.",1353801600,,272,4.808510638297872
1410233,2,B000059ZWT,"The Glory Stompers is that kind of biker flick that really wants you to think it's going to be all-out exploitation grit and grime, but then pulls its punches everytime.  Dennis Hopper is Chino, leader of the Black Souls, and he and his mates run the leader of the Glory Stompers to ground in order to get some payback for an earlier quarrel.  Mistakenly thinking they've killed him, they take his girl and decide to sell her to slavers in Mexico in order to keep her quiet.  Except Darryl, the Glory Stomper they thought they'd killed, is still alive, and hot on their trail.

I like these old biker flicks, but I don't know if I've seen one yet that really delivers on its promises.  The Glory Stompers is a mixed bag; Dennis Hopper isn't completely over the top like he would be later in movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Velvet/dp/B003U74NQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Velvet</a>, yet we can see that character emerging.  He and Robert Tessier are about the only threatening elements in the entire film though.  The rest of the Black Souls are closer to comedy relief, with an early appearance of Casey Kasem and Lindsay Crosby as part of the gang.  Jody McCrea is Darryl, leader of the Stompers, and, along with his right hand man Pony, looks more like he belongs in the Village People than in a motorcycle gang.

A lot of this movie is footage of bikers riding down the road, and there's another long section suppposedly highlighting for the squares back in middle of the country just how crazy the biker lifestyle was a la a love-in party where everyone is getting high and gettin' it on, all the while listening to a band that sounds a lot like Herman's Hermits.  Lots of T and A at the party, and a little nudity, but pretty tame overall.  Worth it if you dig these old bikes and late 60's exploitation, and if you're a big Dennis Hopper fan.  Most everyone else will be giving it a pass anyway, because the subject matter doesn't suit them, and since the movie never break far away from the stereotypical elements of the biker flick, that probably works out pretty well.",1340064000,5,2143,4.793478260869565
1410234,5,B000059ZWT,"Another beautiful sixties movie! Among the top five in the genre I dare rate this beauty. Simply love every second of the restored picture. So long awaited. Hells Angels of '69 and Devil's Angels I also recommend , If you're really in to It.",1331596800,2,241,4.5

7934757,2,B000059ZWT,"California cinematic exploitation cheese at its foulest... Hopper oozes with menace ""this cat is obviously suicidal"", Chris Noel whines, ""I just want something better than being a Stomper's girl"" Jody McCrea taking a break from his Beach Party ""Bonehead"" character still manages to come off as dumb and clueless as ever. McCrea is almost as unconvincing a tough guy biker as Gary Wood ""Pony"" who quietly suffers the indignity of Casey Kasem (""Mouth"") eyeing him with full lecherous intent while mouthing ""I, Love You""  Wood dances likes he's hanging out at P.J.'s, making the scene with Hollywood rather than biker trash and would it hurt the guy to maybe get some grease under his fingernails and a few oil stains on his cut-off. The fight scenes are clunky affairs ""You mother lover! We're gonna rub yo' face in the dirt"" though both Hopper and Kasem do seem to enjoy stomping a mudhole in McCrea before Magoo (Richard Tessier) whacks him in the face with a steel rod (they then leave him for dead, without so much as checking for a pulse) Convinced that they've murdered dear old Darryl (there's a biker name for ya') and that the Stompers will be out for blood, they kidnap Chris (played by Chris Noel...huh?) and what follows is pure hi-jinks and shenanigans. I saw this several times at our local drive-in and was amazed at how gloriously awful it was.... it hasn't improved with time. Glory Stompers is craptastic exploitation movie fare, made watchable only by Dennis Hopper channeling a low budget Marlon Brando as Chino  and Kasem's sublimely evil, yet lovable take on his character Mouth. The next time you're home alone on a Saturday night, break out the bong and some schwag, toss a pack of kettle corn in the microwave, grab a gallon of cheap wine and please no comments from the peanut gallery... this isn't MST3K",1438387200,2,1828,4.781645569620253
7934758,5,B000059ZWT,"With the recent biker violence in Texas, this movie about two rival motorcycle gangs (the Black Souls versus the Glory Stompers) at war with each other, is as timely as ever. Dennis Hopper is thoroughly convincing as a gang member who wants to send a rival members girl to Mexico to become a sex slave. Unfortunately for him he forgot to make sure her boyfriend was dead and now hes out to save her.

 The girl, played by Chris Noel, is almost as good a performer as Hopper. We are totally convinced she despises Hoppers character; yet, Hopper and Noel were having an affair during the filming. One of the Black Souls comments that she has too much class to be a Mama and Chris plays it that way, a classy broad involved with a motorcycle gang member. At one point there is a catfight between two Mamas that is very entertaining and very well choreographed.

The climax is a shocker and must have been somewhat similar to what happened in Texas, only in the movie it was on a much smaller scale. As I said, this movie is as timely as ever. The Glory Stompers may very well be the most important movie ever made.",1432080000,3,1111,4.383495145631068
