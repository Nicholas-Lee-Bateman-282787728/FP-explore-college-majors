preserve historical facts about WW2 would be happy to have it.",1386374400,,127,4.08
8272348,1,B00197XF78,"I wish Amazon allowed a rating of less than one star. This video is nothing more than a reissue of the old Battle Line series. The series was ok, good footage but a bit dated after 50 years. There are a number of other companies that have done a similar reissue and make it available for a fraction of the price. If you like old WW II documentaries this is ok but you can buy it a lot cheaper from other companies.

I am very interested in military history and have bought quite a lot of videos from Amazon over the years. I generally find the Madacy product to be overpriced reissues of old material in a fancy box. Packaging looks great, contents are ok to mediocre. Regardles of your interest in the material it is always available elsewhere significantly cheaper. But if all you want is a fancy box, then by all means this is the product for you.",1239321600,2,850,4.3125
