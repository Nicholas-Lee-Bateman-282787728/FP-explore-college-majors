3735612,2,B001OQCVFQ,"Ok, I am a nurse and take offense to this garbage of a show. A drug addict, workaholic, out to make good in the world, having sex on the job is F'in' crap. It just isn't believable or not pleasant to watch. I really  don't need to watch tv because real life is a heck of a lot better but hey I only work 36 hours a week and not allowed to work over 40 hours a week. There is sooo much cut backs with the economy I am lucky to be working. Anyway.......it sucks....really....really.....bad!!!!! Nurses deserve more respect!!",1244332800,6,522,4.2727272727272725
3735613,2,B001OQCVFQ,"The concept behind ""Nurse Jackie"" has potential.  Jackie is a passionate, dedicated nurse who struggles to satisfy various mutually exclusive demands: being a hero and saving-angel to her patients, snorting enough pills to satisfy her drug addiction and carrying on an affair with a co-worker, and being a good mom/wife . . .

. . . whoa there.  Did I just say that premise had potential?  Goes to show how far good acting can go to make a show convincing.  The more I ""think"" about the show, the less I like it. It just isn't believable.  The writers are trying to create a morally-conflicted character, but I feel that they are beating me over the head with a stick to make their point.  Like when they show Jackie laying down in a church pew pondering life. . . minutes before she was getting it on (quite graphically) with her co-worker.  Yeah right, like I'm supposed to be touched by that ""complexity.""  It also felt corny when Jackie kissed her lover good-bye, headed for home, and started quoting St. Augustine to herself: ""God, make me good, but just not yet.""  And that was just before she turned the key in her front door, greeted her two cute daughters and hunky husband . . . and gives the girls the moon-pie present from her boyfriend.  She gives a big smile to the camera and seems totally cool with that funked up arrangement.

Well, I guess if Nurse Jackie is fine with it, then so am I.  As in, I'm moving on to the next show and I really don't care what Nurse Jackie does with her life.",1244160000,10,1505,4.429090909090909

3735622,5,B001OQCVFQ,"This show is very funny.  I've seen all seasons, but I don't want to share the ending with you.  Like I said the series has a lot of really humorous parts to it.  The subject of her addiction starts out slowly.  I don't know if any of you have experienced addiction either for yourself or someone close to you.  As the show continues, the seriousness of addiction finally comes into play.  The character is a genius at protecting the fact of her addiction and continuing it despite interventions.  I am a recovering addict myself, so this show really hit home for me and was very sobering as the series progressed.  I have to say though that it did give me a ton of laughs.  Nurse Jackie is an opportunity to have some laughs, but also learn something about life.",1483315200,,763,4.431654676258993

3735683,5,B001OQCVFQ,"Potential spoiler alert:

A highly watchable series which I do not view as a comedy or even a dark comedy.  Nurse Jackie is a realistic depiction of a high-functioning drug addict on the decline.  She lies, she lies about lying and she lies about lying about lying.  No rule or relationship is sacred if it comes between Nurse Jackie, her self-image as a super-nurse, and her insatiable need for drugs.

Like so many sociopaths/narcissistic types she's capable of being irresistible.  Most people have the potential to be seduced and charmed by such rule breakers and Jackie has suckered her share of friends, lovers, colleagues and family members.  But she isn't overtly devious, malicious or sadistic.  Jackie masquerades as a devoted health professional and self-identifies as a  compassionate nursing professional.  But nothing is more important to her then her drug supply.  Not her husband, nor her children or her friends.

The relationship Nurse Jackie has with her husband, her children, her colleagues, her friends and any other people in her life that are a potential source of drugs is fascinating.  Whatever the early childhood cause for her inner demons and pain, she is now a sociopath masquerading as a highly driven emergency room nurse.  She's competent and seemingly caring, but she'll throw anyone under the bus - family member, patient, colleague or friend  if she is in need of a cover story or if she needs a fix.  And she's so narcissistic she will not release her image of herself as  ""competent nurse"" and accept she is indeed  powerless to help herself.  She simply refuses to commit to a rehab program even though she's lost everything.

I'm surprised how many reviewers view Jackie as a multifaceted and complex character.  Her web of deceit is complex, but there is no complexity to Jackie.  She needs only to maintain her image of herself as super-nurse, protect her drug supply and and control what everyone knows about her.  No one really gets intimate with Jackie. Not her husband, not her children, nor her boyfriend or her best friend. Inevitably her world falls apart and no amount of drugs will give her the ability to keep it all together.",1454371200,,2178,4.923076923076923

3735691,3,B001OQCVFQ,"It's not a bad show but like most mainstream TV shows and movies today there is a deep and persistent vein of racist imagery that can only be described as deliberate. For example, this is NYC, and there are hardly any black or brown doctors or nurses in a major city hospital. Second, the common theme is to show a black or brown person as a homosexual who winds up lusting after or sleeping with a white person.

There are no people of color having any kind of romantic, healthy, heterosexual relationships. Thirdly, the black females are always overweight, hostile, mean, and man-less. And the white people are somewhat angelic however flawed and their romantic relationships are largely unrealistic with constant kissing and touching and endless ""I love you!"" -- which if you know any couple that has been married for several years, that is NOT happening on a constant, all-day basis. And this is seen in the vast majority of white movies & TV shows.

And Jewish people are always shown in a tender, sentimental light and never in a negative light. This cannot be accidental nor is it surprising considering who develops and greenlights and produces most mainstream entertainment.

Again, it's not a bad show it's just the racist imagery that persists in the mainstream media entertainment that diminishes the humanity of everyone who is not white. The message to black and brown and yellow people is:

White is the norm. White is the default and all black and brown and yellow people are simply the backdrops or the wallpaper with no real, healthy lives of their own. That is white supremacy in a nutshell.",1451606400,2,1610,4.8014440433212995

Falco's affair with the hospital pharmacist is a major plot point, and is kind of amusing in light of her ever charming, devoted and handsome husband.  And that she swaps sex for oxycontin? Hilarious. Sort of. I think the idea was that she was annoyed at having to play Tony Soprano's wife while he cheated on her in every episode of the Sopranos. So, now Falco gets to have the on-screen affair she wanted. It's funny, but after a season the gag gets stale.",1444780800,3,600,4.405405405405405

3735706,2,B001OQCVFQ,"I was looking for something to cheer me up and entertain me, and based on a brief look at one episode I thought this might do the trick.  Season One was OK.  I especially liked Dr. O'Hara, played by Eve Best, and Zoey, played by Merritt Wever.  Edie Falco is just OK, at least in my opinion.  Then I made the mistake of watching Liz Brixius and Linda Wallem blather on with their patronizing attitude toward nurses and I realized the politically correct fix was in.  This becomes more apparent in season two when Dr. O'Hara has sex with the Hindu-American sex-and-drug addict male RN Sam, played by Arjun Gupta, in the visitors' chapel, and then reveals that she is having an affair with a famous female tv journalist.  Guns are really, really bad, except when owned by an illegal alien, who is not only taking American jobs but is set loose by Nurse Jackie (who just happens to speak fluent Spanish) before he can be arrested by the police, and we are all expected to cheer!  An EMT who can be relied on to have marijuana with him at all times - is that amusing?  The only male doctor is a pompous ass who feels women up and was raised by Lesbians. Really?  Is that humorous? There's much, much more, all way too tedious to document.  About what one should expect from CBS, who own Showtime.

There is a lot of talented acting - Jackie's kids, for example - , and if they would stick to comedy instead of trying to cram a socio-politico-sexual agenda down my throat, I would enjoy watching the show.  It's really a pity.  I am going to donate the dvds to the local public library.

3735715,1,B001OQCVFQ,"I thought Edie Falco was absolutely brilliant in The Sopranos. She is an excellent actress but that outstanding comedy/drama was kept vibrant not only by great casting and great acting but by something this series lacks completely = great writing. I agree with what other reviewers have said, that there is not one character to sympathize or identify with in Nurse Jackie. That is a fatal flaw.

I read years ago that impaired nurses are a considerable and dangerous problem today. I find nothing amusing about her drug use and find it ludicrous that she could function at all as an ER nurse. It defies logic that she can do this demanding job well and that a colleague does not notice that she's high.

Awful, idiotic, and ultimately boring series.",1440115200,4,749,4.753846153846154

3735739,5,B001OQCVFQ,"We bought seasons 1-6 on DVD and watched them all in a week. The show is similar to House M.D. but with more mature content and language. It was such a good production and well acted/directed, that I found myself disturbed by many scenes. The story haunted me for a few days afterward. Some bits were shocking and not for everyone (certainly not for the weak-hearted). If anything, it's sometimes too real. My 25+ years playing guitar in local bars with classic rock bands prepared me for the less moral behaviour, but some parts were things I heard about but never witnessed. If you're upset by immoral behaviour, skip this one!
Edie Falco is fantastic! I now know why I'd heard of her before (never watched the Sopranos). In the bloopers, it's apparent that she's the rock that anchors the cast.",1432080000,3,797,4.659574468085107

Jackie is smart, has a good job, and from outward appearances, it seems like she's got it totally together, yet she struggles daily with her pill addiction. The lies and deceit associated with her illness take their toll on those close to her. The show has a good supporting cast too. I think the show is on par with Six Feet Under and is so much better than Weeds, which I had to quit watching after season three because it seemed just too ridiculous.

I am a nurse and am aware that there are many nurses in this world who have drug problems, and the writers of the show are trying to paint a picture of a very complex character in this ER nurse who has a drug problem and a pharmacist boyfriend who gives her pills, and they increase the intrigue by showing the viewer that the nurse has a husband and a family.

3735826,5,B001OQCVFQ,Seasons 1-4 are really good but seasons 5 and 6 are OUTSTANDING. I think the show got some new producers/writers and it really shows. Must see! TV!,1402358400,,147,4.481481481481482
3735827,4,B001OQCVFQ,Wow the very first episode about rattled my head.  The acting is excellent the writing amazing.. I'm an old Nurse and as bad as it is in this show  it is not the norm. But  it is more the norm than you could know.  I assure you things have changed since the bad old cowboy days. I refer to the wild west.  As an old nurse there is no way I can afford to watch the rest of the episodes. So goes retirement.,1401148800,,405,3.8313253012048194

3735836,1,B001OQCVFQ,I love this show and Edie Falco is amazing in this role as a drugged out ER nurse. So imagine my anger when I received my package only to discover it only disc 3 of the season 1 and not the complete season as was indicated in the listing. They refunded my money and everything was handled correctly.  Just wish I would have received what ordered.,1395014400,,346,4.242424242424242
3735837,5,B001OQCVFQ,"I love this shows first season. It kind of lost the appeal for me after the second season but the first 2 were hilarious and outrageously off the wall. I tried to have my aunt, a former nurse, watch this but she took offense at Jackie being a drug user. I think she thought the show portrayed every nurse as high on pills. You have to understand that with all of Jackie's failings she is only human and is trying to do right for her patients.",1394496000,,442,4.151162790697675

3735846,4,B001OQCVFQ,"I am a nursing student who is almost finished with school. Nursing is much different than most non-Nursing people think it is. Nurse Jackie is somewhat typical of an ER nurse. She is imperfect yet she does her job well. Good on her feet. Uses dry humor to deal with the day-to-day frequent flyer patients.

She is also a drug addict that goes to extensive lengths to cover her addiction and still function in the world.

I watched all of this season in two sittings... it was that 'addicting' (lol) to me!!",1390608000,,506,4.489130434782608

3735851,5,B001OQCVFQ,"While I am not impressed with the substance abuse line of the show, it makes part of the script understandable and does portray that one will do what one has to do on many levels.

Nurse Jackie is a problem solver.  And she gets the job done!",1389225600,,242,4.127659574468085
3735852,5,B001OQCVFQ,"Nurse Jackie doesn't seem to get the attention some other series have enjoyed, even though Edie Falco has been nominated for numerous awards. I love, love this series. The characters are memorable and superbly acted by an extraordinary ensemble cast. Edie Falco can convey more in one deadpan expression than entire casts of other shows. Highly recommended. Don't rate it by how buzzworthy you think it may or may not be. This is a wonderful series with characters you won't soon forget.",1388620800,,487,4.951219512195122

When I finally ran out of Dexter and Doc Martin, I finally gave it a shot and was hooked. It is a terrific show though I find the half hour to be too short --- and wish it were a longer program.  I am binge-watching and gobbling up the series --- it's fun to start watching a good series when there are a lot of shows taped and waiting;.",1388102400,,455,4.044444444444444

3735855,5,B001OQCVFQ,ackie Rules Edie Falco plays the perfect drug addled nurse. The show gives you a different perspective of how drug addictions can easily take place in the medical field and how just because someone might have a drug issue it doesn't necessarily make them a useless drooling mess. Many addicts blend in and this show is an example of how.,1385078400,,337,4.633333333333334

3735857,5,B001OQCVFQ,Amazing show! Edie Falco is just brilliant in this off beat drama/comedy show. Her struggles make most lives seem quite normal lol. Love this show and the supporting actors are amazing too. The show grabs you in the first episode and holds your attention through out the season.,1383955200,,278,4.8125

3735864,4,B001OQCVFQ,"At least that's what I keep telling myself. I've watched three episodes of season 1 so far. It's been fun, although a little slow in some parts. This is awkward to say, but I find myself wanting to see more of Jackie's bad behavior. It's a bit of a guilty pleasure, seeing her substance use, her infidelity, and seeing how well she keeps it together. You know this can't last.",1379030400,,376,4.385714285714286

3735868,5,B001OQCVFQ,"Well, we instantly fell in love with this cast. The writers know life and how the most seemingly trivial things can blow up into everything we love and hate bout it.

It's amazing.",1376438400,,333,4.566666666666666
3735869,5,B001OQCVFQ,This is the best show on TV... point blank... This season is no different. There is not a single character that I don't enjoy on this show. From the drug abusing Jackie to the cute but crazy Zoey. The dialogue is brilliant and the stories compelling. This show never gets stale nor does it ever feel like it is trying too hard.,1375920000,,327,4.290322580645161
3735870,5,B001OQCVFQ,"This character is everything I despise in a person.  And I'm ashamed to admit I like this show!:) She has 2 adorable girls, a wonderful husband, and she cheats on her family with a guy from work.  The boyfriend gives her drugs. Despite being stoned on opiates half the time, she's a wonderful nurse.  This is a woman who lives on the edge 24/7.",1374192000,,344,4.34375

3735883,5,B001OQCVFQ,"I already fell in love with this show and bought the DVD to share with my family.

We first noticed the acting of Edie Falco (Nurse Jackie) in The Sopranos.  In Nurse Jackie she really carries a tremendous story of a person who continues to be great at her job while her personal life falls apart. The entire cast does a great job.

By the way, my family agrees with me and I will be buying the rest of the series available on DVD to send to them!",1368748800,,447,4.056818181818182
3735884,5,B001OQCVFQ,"As a nurse I can appreciate Jackie's no nonsense treatment of doctors, patients and coworkers. I can also understand the her weaknesses as she navigates life in and out of the hospital. Nursing is an extremely challenging career where it is difficult to retain your humanity without completely being lost and overwhelmed.

3735902,5,B001OQCVFQ,"I know most nurses don't like showing our profession in this light BUT nurses are human too. We're not perfect. There are shows about doctors, lawyers,  policemen, firemen, and every profession out there showing their humanity. So why not nurses? Yes, it is true that Nurses hold the position of #1 of all professions in the annual Gallup survey which shows, with 85% of survey respondents ranking nurses highest for honesty and ethics, The only time nurses were not first on the list was 2001, after the terrorist attack of September 11, when firefighters ranked first. Firefighters have not been included in polling in any other years. So why not show Nurse Jackie as a human? I find it refreshing. And I say that as a nurse with many years of experience under my belt. Some of the things Jackie does reminds me of similar things that I've seen over the years in real life on the job. Nurses tend to get the job done that needs to be done. We may not always tell everything about how we get things accomplished for the benefit of the patient but we do get it done. I'm not saying here that we all use drugs as Nurse Jackie does but that happens too. As I said, Nurses are human. I'm just saying that when the patient or the family needs something, be it medical, material, financial, or spiritual, a nurse can usually find a way to make it happen for them. Paperwork be damned if necessary. So when you see Nurse Jackie flush a tyrrant's ear down the toilet it may not be soo far fetched as you may assume. After all, Nurses are human too.",1360368000,3,1541,4.426056338028169
3735903,5,B001OQCVFQ,"I purchased this as a gift for my dad because he was such a Sopranos fan. Reading the premise about the show I didn't think it sounded good. Boy was I wrong.

No spoilers here.  Read on.

While it is terrible to glamorize drug abuse and infidelity it can be entertaining.  Just don't take it to heart and yourself act upon her indiscretions.

She is a compassionate nurse giving to those who deserve that extra something special.  Actually she gives something extra to those who deserve it in a wholly different way as well!

Sweet revenge and just deserts.

If you liked Edie Falco in The Sopranos you will probably like her more in Nurse Jackie.  Her roll is obviously much more pivotal and sympathetic.

Her husband is a doll putting up with her shenanigans though he, too has his own.  And then some.

She also has an oxycodone addiction which causes her to sleep with the hospital pharmacist and break her finger and hide the fact she is married with children.  The season is well laid out with Edie as a character who is really likable but also disturbing for her addiction and lies.  The rest of the cast is made up of some of New York's best actors and actresses.  As the season goes on, Edie's life becomes more visible to her coworkers and family.  But just enough.

3735916,4,B001OQCVFQ,"I'm conflicted on this show.  I've watched the first season and most of the second and have for the most part enjoyed it.  I am a fan of Edie Falco and have enjoyed other series' she's starred in such as ""Oz"" and ""The Sopranos"", and I am not typically one to be caught up in the morality (or lack thereof) in a storyline.  After all, this is adult entertainment.... right?

Well, I'm unfortunately conflicted about the morality of the show.  It isn't so much that there's a Mother with two school aged daughters in it who cheats on her loving husband.  It's her place in the show.  The theme of this series seems to advance the notion that you can cheat your spouse, steal and abuse prescription drugs, tell other people's children to - and I quote - shut the f*** up - as Jackie does in season 2 - and still be a decent human being who deserves our sympathy.

Nevertheless, I'll continue to watch - because it's all good entertainment.  However, I can't help but fear that this actually reflects the world view some people will want to emulate.  I would recommend it for what it's worth - a well directed and well done drama centered around characters it may be hard for many folks to (hopefully) relate to.

The Good:
---------
Well done, excellent acting and production typical of most Showtime or HBO series.

The Bad:
--------
Theme is questionable.  The protaganist is a nurse who is an addict and mother having an affair with a co-worker.  If you're going to enjoy this series you will have to put aside your personal taboos and appreciate it for it's better qualities.",1345420800,2,1576,4.522968197879859

3735931,5,B001OQCVFQ,"**NOTE - This review may contain spoilers**

I put off watching this for awhile because: 1)I was never a fan of medical dramas such as ""ER"" or ""Grey's Anatomy"" and 2)It received a less-than-glowing review on a website I used to consider quite reputable.

Said website was totally off-base as ""Nurse Jackie"" turned out to be just as clever and addicting as my other current favorites ""Dexter"", ""Weeds"" and ""United States of Tara"" (Showtime is certainly doing something right when they are able to produce the best shows currently on television). And when the opening moments of a show's debut episode features the theme from ""Valley of the Dolls"" (one of my favorite bad movies ever) I knew it couldn't be anything but great!

I never watched ""The Sopranos"" so I don't have anything to compare Edie Falco's performance to, but here she's just perfect playing the drug-addicted, overworked, underpaid nurse toiling at a New York hospital. She's also carrying on a sexual relationship with Eddie the pharmacist, even though she's married with two kids.

The supporting cast is also excellent and it's fun to see Jackie and her gay co-worker Mo-Mo lying in the chapel pews on their break philosophizing; or Jackie and best pal Dr. O'Hara running to each other whenever they need some friendly support for their personal crises. The running gags in the show are fresh like young Dr. Cooper's nervous tic of inappropriate sexual touching whenever he's in a tense situation.

The show can make you laugh one moment and cry the next; especially when Jackie goes above and beyond by doing something small like mailing a patient's due bills for them after they've died; or giving their survived loved ones cab fare home.

The best episode features the always-dependable Judith Ivey guest-starring as a foul-mouthed former colleague suffering from lung cancer who checks in to ask for Jackie's help in ""checking out"".

I also appreciated the show's basic filming technique; no done-to-death CSI-type editing here, so bravo to the producers for that.

Overall, a great series that is well worth seeing. There are commentaries on select episodes. After seeing this, I have to immediately go out and get Season Two. I'm as addicted to this show as Jackie is to painkillers!",1307577600,2,2259,4.973474801061008

3735934,3,B001OQCVFQ,"I like Edie Falco fine as an actress, but I'm not entranced by her character, nurse Jackie.  I certainly wouldn't want her to be my nurse in a hospital or anywhere else.  Perhaps she would be tolerated in a New York hospital, but I would hope not.  In fact, I doubt that she could hide her faults in any hospital.

Nurse Jackie is first of all a drug addict.  She needs a hit before she can go to work, and she needs several more hits during her workday.  Worst of all, the drug addiction is used for comedic effect, and there's nothing funny, to my thinking, about a druggie or a drunk.  For example, Jackie's supervisor accidently puts Jackie's drugs in her coffee, thinking she is using an artificial sweetener.  Suddenly, the supervisor turns into a giggly girl in lala land, rather than a dragon lady.  As Queen Victoria allegedly said, ""we are not amused.""  Patients could be jeopardized while she has the giggles.

And then Nurse Jackie is having a torrid sexual affair at work, despite the fact that she is married to a man who loves her and whom she loves.  They have two small daughters.  Jackie's paramour and her husband do not know about each other.  It's amazing that she finds time to take care of patients, with all this jiggling and juggling and hot text messages.  I'd want a nurse who had her focus on me, the patient, not one who was planning her next love tryst in the supply closet or looking forward to her next snootfull.

The atmosphere and sets are good.  Falco's acting is excellent as always.  She looks like a real nurse, not some starlet who was cast for her implants.  The problem is with the view the writers had of the central character.  Among medical programs, I prefer House, ER, and Grey's Anatomy.  They aren't perfect either, but they are better than Nurse Jackie.",1301443200,10,1803,4.520123839009288

I am not sure why I liked it so much.  Some of it reminds me why I left the nursing field.  Some of it is totally unrealistic. I never worked in a place where so many narcotics could have gone missing, however I was always in a small town hospital or nursing home, so I have no idea about the big hospitals.  I do know lots of nurses are in NA and AA.  But there are lots of pharmacists, mailmen, store clerks, ordinary people also.  Realistically those people get the meds somehow. Its a TV show, I never watch reality TV, so why do I want this show to be reality anyway?  I don't!  I could totally see Jackie as a human being working in a hospital in New York.  I spent 360 minutes in another world like I rarely find.  I think this was money well spent, and look forward to Season 2.  I love the characters, the layers.  My favorite is the new nurse, and her idealistic view of how nursing should be, in such contrast to Jackie.  There is enough of this show based in reality to provide suspension of disbelief for the whole 3o minutes. I could go on for hours, but I think instead I will go watch Season 1 again, until 2 is available.

I had enjoyed the premiere and thought it seemed like something I would like. After 26 years in healthcare, 12 in a county trauma center, I can tell you there are more Jackies than not.  Truthfully I have not watched more than three episodes before I became bored and have not bothered to watch any more of the series. The primary characters are fairly interesting, though the husband character is barely believable as her husband. He looks younger than her and they have no chemistry. The secondary characters are boring and never transcend the stereotypes they represent. But probably the most egregious error is the terrible medicine they practice at this hospital.  I can barely sit without pulling my hair out, at the stupidness I see on the screen. A medical advisor would be inexpensive in Hollywood world and could have injected some much needed interest.

3735965,5,B001OQCVFQ,"I see some complaints that ""Nurse Jackie"", as played by Edie Falco, is not a positive role model.  They have a point - Jackie cheats on her husband with a pharmacist who thinks he is her main squeeze, so that Jackie can be kept with a steady supply of narcotics.

But like the proverbial onion, Jackie has layers, and like another of my favorite Showtime eponymous characters, Dexter Gordon, Jackie is not by any stretch ""all evil"" and she is never, ever boring.

Jackie's an adulterous druggie - but she's more.  Years of having to literally manhandle patients in the Emergency Room more than twice her size have left Jackie with an aching back, and she could pursue more permanent treatment, but she and her family need this week's paycheck, so she masks her painful back with ill-gotten hard stuff.  Merritt Wever plays Zoey, a young nurse who is everything Jackie is not - nave, inexperienced, and as likely to want to cuddle her patients as treat them.  The interactions between the experienced Jackie and the still-learning Zoey are one of the cornerstones of the show.

Jackie does things on the other side of ""ethical"", but like Robin Hood, she does them because her heart is in the right place.  She knows desperate patients wait for potential donors, so when a brain-dead bicycle courier is brought to her ER, Jackie forges the dying man's signature onto an organ donor card.

If she sees nurses or doctors doing wrong or even not doing as well as they should, Jackie gets in their face.  She is not the touchy-feely one in her department.  But she is the one the others go to if they're in a tough spot.

Eve Best plays Dr. Eleanor O'Hara, an experienced New York doctor who is as anxious to use her doctor's wages to buy the latest fashions as her doctor's skill to take care of patients.  Peter Facinelli plays Dr. Fitch Cooper, a new and inexperienced E.R. doc who finds himself often on the receiving end of Jackie's verbal and physical barbs.  Haaz Sleiman is great as Mohammed ""Mo-Mo"" De La Cruz, another ER RN with a heart of gold who has fought in the trenches with Jackie for years.  Paul Schulze plays Eddie the pharmacist boyfriend.  Dominic Fumusa plays Jackie's solid gold husband, Kevin.  Kevin tends bar and helps raise their girls, and when you see Kevin in action you wonder how in the world Jackie could cheat on him.

But Jackie doesn't live in a world that is black and white.  Since the real world has plenty of grey, I'm willing to overlook Jackie's faults in favor of the entertainment of her company.",1267315200,33,2535,4.605790645879733
3735966,5,B001OQCVFQ,"As a nurse, I love this show. You'd think I'd hate it, due to the fact that Jackie has a drug problem and she cheats on her husband. But, she is actually a good nurse in spite of her flaws.  What I like about this show is that nurses aren't painted as helpmaids to the physicians. My problem with many of the medical shows is that they show doctors doing stuff that nurses do on a daily basis and the nurses are all but invisible.

Nurses aren't saints..we are professionals who want to be compensated for the work we do. And we're human. Sometimes, we're tired and cranky. Quite often, we're frustrated with a system that is more about the bottom line than actual patients. That's why Nurse Jackie rocks..because Jackie for all her faults and cynicism still gives a crap. She is a good nurse, and her faults can't change that.

I also enjoy the student nurse character..very realistic. LOL, she has that ""deer in the headlights"" look that we all had starting out..",1266019200,77,965,4.502857142857143
3735967,5,B001OQCVFQ,"We all remember Edie Falco as the subdued matriarch of the Soprano family, now she returns to TV with a brand new slate in ""Nurse Jackie"".
New York nurse Jackie Peyton is a gritty, headstrong, no-nonsense veteran employee of the All Saints Hospital that is just as aggressive and bustling as the city it's located in. Jackie excels as a caregiver but her personal demon is her drug addiction that is fueled with the help of the pharmacist that she is having a flaming affair (fellow ""Sopranos"" alumnus Paul Schulze (Father Intintola)). Jackie's only redeemable quality is her willingness to make sacrifices and compromises for her patients by breaking the laws of both the hospital and the system. When Jackie is not on the clock she is a loving wife of a bartender and the mother of two little girls.
On the clock her comrades are her gay co-workers Mohammed or ""Mo-Mo"" (also her shoulder to cry on and the one she confides in), Thor, and the ditzy intern Chloe. Then there is the airheaded Dr. Cooper (Peter Facinelli) who has just arrived on the hospital scene straight out of med school. Jackie's only doctor friend is the designer clothes sporting Dr. O'Hara from England. Finally, there is Akalytus, the hospital administrator who is hated by all.
I am shocked to see how many bad reviews this show has. I must admit that I started watching this show out of pure boredom and after watching the pilot episode I found myself wanting to watch the next episode and the one after that.

3735973,4,B001OQCVFQ,"I can't beleive that no one has mentioned this yet, or maybe I am just really a sick, evil person and I should get help now, but for me the appeal of Nurse Jackie is that it is a Seinfeldian Revenge show. Most revenge flicks are epic, when someone completely destroys your life or takes away everything that gave your life meaning, like Count of Monte Cristo or Kill Bill.

But I say Nurse Jackie's revenge is Seinfeldian because we're talking about little daily trials and tribulations that real people are expected to just deal with if you are to remain in civil society. I mean, have you noticed that she is essentially giving us the finger - but with a syringe instead of her middle finger? If not, don't feel bad - it took me longer than I care to admit to see it.

Nurse Jackie's life motto seems to be: Don't Get Mad; Get Even. While that is not really a good way to live, it is entertaining AS HELL to watch a character be on television.

I will use an example and not tell you which patient so as not to spoil, but on the episode that won me over, on her way home she encounters a person that reminds her of her patient that just died. She looks at him very sincerely and says ""Be Careful."" He looks at her like ""Who do you think you are, my mother?"" and says ""F- you!"" She doesn't even blink, just kneels down and does something that pretty much ensures that he will either be having an accident of his own, or just a really rotten evening. I mean she doesn't even think about it!

Am I a bad person because I thought that was freakin' hilarious? Possibly. But one of the first things she says on the show is a prayer - and I guess it would be the show's motto - ""God, make me good; but not yet.""  It TELLS you that she is in no way supposed to be a role model, or an example of a typical emergency-room nurse. I imagine she is as typical a nurse as Nancy Botwin is a typical suburban single mother.",1262822400,13,1909,4.1347708894878705

3735976,4,B001OQCVFQ,"Along with ""United States of Tara"" and ""Dexter"", with ""Nurse Jackie"" Showtime shows why it is quickly eclipsing HBO as the cable network with the best original programming.

I've never really been a fan of medical dramas, but ""Nurse Jackie"" is good stuff. The titular character, played to perfection by dynamite Edie Falco (completing shedding Carmela Soprano as effectively as Michael C. Hall shed David Fischer), is a character unlike we've ever seen on TV. She's not a virtuous heroine, she's not a villianess, and she's not really an anti-heroine either. She's actually mostly like a real person. She's so full of contradictions, virtues, and vices that she really seems less like a character and more like someone you know. And what's great is that the show doesn't try to give pat answers as to why Jackie is the way she is ... why she's a tough, compassionate caregiver and mother who also happens to be an adulterous opiate addict.

While Nurse Jackie and Edie Falco are superb, the rest of the characters are merely good, which is why this is a four star and not a five star review. Some of the characters shine (brainiac idiot Dr. Cooper and doe-eyed Zoe)whereas others still seem 2-dimensional or stereotypical (Miss Akalitus and Mo, the token gay nurse). Still, with only one season under the show's belt, even the less developed characters have plenty of time to find their place in this mostly fresh, funny, and unpredictable series.",1259712000,3,1447,4.878048780487805
3735977,4,B001OQCVFQ,"For those looking for conflict resolution or some sort of psychological undressing of Jackie - you have the wrong show. Jackie is too hard for that sort of Oprah candy. She has been hardened by the life she has lived in the Emergency Room. Like a soldier on the frontlines of battle, she is undergoing horrific trauma on a daily basis with no time to process or find healthier ways of coping. Clearly she is spiraling towards some sort of crash, which she is doing her best to stem off with drugs. But it is inevitable. This is what drives the show - how close can the writers take Jackie to the brink but not push her over? (When and if they do push her over that brink and into rehad, the show will lose its momentum - not sure what season two will look like.) I don't think the writers intended her to be some sort of ""character"" tied up in a neat bow of conflict, conflict resolution - hopefully in the third act. This show is more like The Wire, it intends to show life as it  is in certain segments of our society and people, flawed people, doing whatever it takes to deal with it and cope - not always successfully. An Emergency Room in Queens is the belly of this beast that is our healthcare system and society - characters like Jackie are intended to reflect the sickness that is the system.",1257206400,13,1301,4.288617886178862

Nurse Jackie is so screwed up and yet, she shows such compassion to the patients and staff.  This show is a tour de force for sure.  The episodes have to be watched at least twice to get all the nuances.  It is just edgy enough to be delightful.  I love all the characters and they all develop so nicely as the show progresses.  Gosh darn it, I have fallen in love with TV again.",1256688000,11,486,4.010416666666667
3735979,4,B001OQCVFQ,"Having never watched the Sopranos (heresy, I know), I didn't have any preconceived notions of what type of person Edie Falco should or should not be playing. Many of my friends tell me that the character of Nurse Jackie is a far cry from her Carmelo Soprano alter-ego.

Jackie is a full time nurse in a public hospital in New York City.  Like most nurses and emergency medical workers, she is overworked and underpaid and trying to make do with what life has handed to her.  On the surface, she is hardworking nurse who is a loving mother of two little girls and a devoted wife to Kevin Payton who runs a local bar. Scratch the surface just a little bit and the perfect facade peels away to reveal a drug addicted adulterer who regularly breaks the laws in order to suit her own perceived morals.

Nurse Jackie tackles quite a few heavy subjects during its initial season including assisted suicide, underage children caring for their parents, as well as the rigors of raising children who aren't quite perfect.  Medical dramas are a dime a dozen and the comedy versions just always seem to be lacking substance, however the staff writers of Nurse Jackie do a masterful job of mixing the heavy subjects in with very lighthearted, almost slapstick humor.

While the Peyton household hasn't been expanded on very much (honestly you could replace the husband and two little girls with bricks and you probably wouldn't notice much difference), the hospital staff shines in every way. Doctor O'Hara is the archetypal rich doctor as well as the ""straight man"" for most of Jackie's exploits.  While her character was explored a little bit in season one, there wasn't a lot invested yet.  Doctor Cooper is the hotshot doctor straight out of Med School looking to make his mark.  He's cute and naive and looking to make sure everyone thinks of him as their buddy while trying to become a serious doctor at the same time.  Zoey is the nurse counterpart to Cooper; the truly naive nursing student straight from school who hasn't had her spirit crushed by the real world. The rest of the hospital staff, Miss Akalitus, Mo-Mo, and Thor, all play delightful comedic foils throughout the season.  The cast list would not be complete without the mention of Eddie, the hospital pharmacist who ""supplies"" prescription pills to Jackie because he believes he is doing his duty as a good boyfriend.  Eddie unfortunately does not know that he is being used by Jackie who has a happy family at home as well as a husband with whom we are led to believe she is still in love with.

Fans of shows like ER will appreciate the drama, however it should be noted that Nurse Jackie is relatively light on the medical science side of the house.  While drugs are described, procedures mentioned, there is very little step-by-step-to-recovery type documentation on a per patient level.  You'll see gunshot wounds come in, chest tubes inserted, CBC and toxicity reports ordered but not a lot of breakdown into why a doctor orders which test, why they should look at alternatives, etc like in ER.  Nurse Jackie was written in order to revolve around the nurse not the doctor, and as such there is a much higher emphasis placed on patient care rather than just medical procedures.

My only gripe with Nurse Jackie is that there is zero conflict resolution throughout the entire season.  Season one ended with a cliffhanger and as with all other Showtime/HBO episodic shows, the next season will not premier until sometime in the next year. All of the ""will she get caught?"" questions that you develop from episode one will still be there after you finish episode twelve (with a few dozen extra questions thrown in by then for good measure). Other than that, Nurse Jackie is a great show, and I suppose that the fact that I want Season Two to start right now! attests to how addicting the series is.",1251676800,84,3861,4.711738484398217
3735980,3,B001OQCVFQ,"When I first heard the words ""Edie Falco"" and ""Showtime"" in the same sentence, I figured ""Nurse Jackie"" had all the makings of a great show, right? Wrong.

I really, really wanted to like this show, but it's just missing something. The story revolves around Jackie (Falco), a nurse at a New York City hospital. Although she appears to be happily married with two kids, Jackie's also having an affair with Eddie (Paul Schulze), the hospital pharmacist, who has no idea his lover has a family waiting for her at home. Meanwhile, Jackie also has a nasty little addiction to painkillers, and she uses her job and her relationship with Eddie to secure regular fixes.

""Nurse Jackie"" also boasts a colorful supporting cast, but quite frankly, I don't really care for any of the characters on this show, Jackie included. I think one of the biggest problems with the entire series is that the majority of the characters are extremely annoying, or just downright unlikeable. In fact, the only two characters I care for are Elenor (Eve Best) and Cooper (Peter Facinelli), who bring some much-needed comic relief to the show. The other characters are amusing at times and Falco has some good one-liners, but for the most part, this show just doesn't do it for me. I don't feel invested in any of the characters, and their motivations are never clearly defined throughout the course of the first season. Why is Jackie having an affair? Why is she addicted to drugs? I don't know, and I really don't care, because I don't like her character. It's such a disappointment, because the series has so much potential, but just sort of fell flat from the very beginning.

The one good thing I can say is that the last two episodes of the season were definitely the best of the bunch, so perhaps there is hope for ""Nurse Jackie."" However, if Season Two doesn't grab my attention right from the beginning, I'll be tuning out permanently.",1250553600,14,1915,4.71044776119403
3735981,3,B001OQCVFQ,"I enjoy watching ""Nurse Jackie"" because, as usual, the writing and acting are so much better than what you can find on regular programming, but it's getting harder to like.  At first I thought, ""Great, another complex character, I'll love this,"" but now I'm frankly disgusted with Nurse Jackie.  She is self-righteous and at the same time, morally bankrupt.  They need to explain why she feels the need to get it on with Eddie to the extent that she does, with such a handsome and supportive husband at home -- how she can pull off being unmarried to her co-workers when she's worked there as long as she has; how she can get away with telling off doctors as she does (okay, she's been around longer and the one guy is some kind of wet-behind-the-ears-resident, but it's still pushing the envelope of reality); and why the drug addiction?  At first I thought it was pain-related, but she does not seem to have any sort of disability.

I love Edie Falco, but they seem to have gone out of their way to make her look as unattractive as possible.  Her husband looks about 20 years younger, which makes her affair with Eddie all the more unbelievable.
