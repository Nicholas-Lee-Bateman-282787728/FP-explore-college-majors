They're short (perfect ""commercial breaks"" for a long rainy day), fun, and Huckle and his friends solve mysteries in a way that can easily be grasped by toddlers.  We will be ordering the next few as they become available!",1243382400,4,408,4.285714285714286

8316796,4,B001L1CNIY,"When my kindergartner was younger, we used to read Richard Scarry's stories and we both loved the fun characters and the morals in the stories. Recently, we discovered the cartoons based on the stories and they are indeed fun.
These stories focus on mysteries surrounding the vehicles in Busytown. Lowly Worm can't seem to locate his apple car and the Mouse family are baffled when their cheese car appears to be nibbled on. It is left to Huckle Cat and friends to solve these mysteries. This is a cute collection of stories for younger children.",1304380800,,546,4.757894736842105
8316797,3,B001L1CNIY,"I think this DVD is good. My 2-year old enjoys these mysteries, and I like the Richard Scarry illustrations. However, the sibling rivalry between the two pigs gets old, and is in each of the six episodes (briefly). The other characters just seem to ignore it or laugh it off, but I hope my daughter doesn't immitate the pigs' selfish attitudes.",1289865600,4,344,4.655737704918033
