8375035,4,B002NGF9RS,I enjoy and watch a lot of stage plays and decided to try this one. I found it to be funny and it kept my attention. I think the characters did a great job with their roles.  I didn't care for the noise from the audience. The volume could have been better. Other than that I think that it was very good.,1292112000,,303,3.8870967741935485
