5536636,5,B00AZNEVK2,"This (mostly) sticks to the book for the pilot (with a few added amusing bits), and expands greatly for the rest of the series.

5536637,5,B00AZNEVK2,"I found this series(? it only contains four episodes) to be charming and offbeat - two things I adore. Dirk Gently is perfect - wacky, brilliant, eccentric and he manages to be loveable even though he is pretty selfish. Darren Boyd is wonderful (I love him!) as Dirk's somewhat confused sidekick. He is the brick tied to the balloon string that keeps Dirk (sort of) grounded. Helen Baxendale, although a wonderful actress, is nasty and icky in this show - I didn't enjoy her performance at all. Maybe she wasn't meant to be likeable - if so, she did that really well. She plays the doctor girlfriend of Richard McDuff (Darren Boyd). Not to be forgotten: Dirk's old and unreliable car - The Princess - is almost a character in her own right and was a fun addition to the show.

The series is based on the novels by Douglas Adams, of Hitch Hikers's Guide to the Galaxy fame, and you can see a little of that sense of humor in this show and his unconventional approach to reality is present as well.

I wish there was more to this series, it was very enjoyable!",1366243200,8,1058,4.420512820512821

5536639,4,B00AZNEVK2,"Lots of laughs at this loony London PI. An enjoyably jolly interlude for the investigator genre fan. Based on Douglas Adams' whimsical hero. Book was 9th on UK best-seller list in 1987, TV series piloted in 2010 and episodes in 2012. It is balmy but beguiling. Zanny; like ""Borat"" as a Private Eye. Intended to be a bit fantastical. Stephen Mangan has the look and temperament of his role of Dirk Gently. He solves cases using a chaotic web of interconnected events- not coincidence. Dirk needs a code of conduct and a cleaning lady.

Episode 1 Pentagon stalks a programmer to death, Dirk must find out if he was a quack or genius. An irrational web of chance reveals truth. Well, Gently truth.

Episode 2 MacDuff & Dirk turn security consultants from where Dirk was expelled. That offers a look at why, which leads to murder of Prof. Jericho. Dead man's colleague (Sylvestra le Touzel -Mansfield Park) might know something.

Episode 3 Dirk's former clients are killed forcing the agency must find the killer before copper Gilks finds them, plus find Melinda Fultone's (Lisa Dillon- Cranford) stalker.

5536691,5,B00AZNEVK2,"While I admire the high-energy (highly American) version of Dirk Gently being broadcast on BBC lately, I think this is THE Dirk Gently adaptation. Dirk is a man who is almost comically confident in his assertion in the fundamental interconnectedness of all things, and Stephen Mangan -- as a Dirk who apparently has enjoyed a Slim-Fast diet before delving into the mysteries of the cosmos as they relate to life in London and its crime elememt) is wonderful as a lovable rogue who you have to kind of hate. Closer to what Douglas Adams envisioned when he wrote his two Dirk Gently books, this series (sadly only one pilot episode and four regular ones) captures the wit, smarts and probability that all things just might be connected. The stand-out episode involves a bit of artificial intelligence and body swapping ... an episode that might even get you a little misty eyed by its conclusion, until Dirk ruins it all at the very end ... heh heh heh. A highly absorbing attempt to bring the other Douglas Adams creation to life. I might add that Helen Baxondale as a long-suffering member of Dirk's unusual circle is terrific ... funny, lovely and patient. If you miss the comic brilliance of Douglas Adams and wish to delve into something that doesn't guide you, as a hitchhiker, across the galaxy, take a look at this 2012 series and enjoy.",1491436800,3,1343,4.719148936170213

5536693,5,B00AZNEVK2,"First off, I am a big fan of the 2016 BBC America remake and wanted to watch this prior incarnation just to see what differences were involved. While the budget is clearly slim to none on the old series, I found the titular character far more appealing, interesting and lively.  He is just more watchable than the pale, almost-not-there version in the current offering. As each episode has its own standalone story, there isn't the same involvement with a complex story arc as there is in the new series but there is a revelation of past events leading up to the future.  And the various oddball events and off-kilter characters ring true. Even the score was uniquely entertaining so I bought the soundtrack. Only complaint was that there were so few episodes (just a pilot and then 3 episodes).  Would've been interesting to see where they could have taken this, especially with Stephen Mangan's more spirited take on the holistic detective.",1488844800,4,942,4.838509316770186

The first Dirk Gently book by the late, great, Douglas Adams is my absolute favorite book of all time. I was so afraid they would ruin it.  Once I finally got up the courage to watch it and once I got over the fact that it was something somewhat related to the actual Douglas Adams from the books, I really like it for what it was. I had to support it by buying an actual copy for myself once the it was officially release for the U.S.  This TV version of Dirk Gently is actually Dirk Gently, just in other stories with some nods to the books unlike the newer TV version of Dirk Gently, the one with Elijah Wood. The newer series is some whole other thing that just happens to have licensed the name Dirk Gently.  The newer one is not so bad once you force your head to just ignore the fact that they just took the name and ignored the Douglas' work altogether.",1488412800,4,1023,3.9950980392156863

5536714,4,B00AZNEVK2,"A pilot and three episodes of what I guess is a now cancelled British TV show themed on the old Douglas Adams ""Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"".

I remember being distinctly underwhelmed by the book back in the mid 80s, and there's more than a whiff of ""idea with not a lot of mileage in it"" in the show, but the acting is superb.

Dirk is played as a thoroughly unlikable self-centered oblivious git who you are going to hate by the end of the fourth episode. Well, I did anyway. YMMV.

The plots are standard ""hard-up detective solves crimes while police thrash about"" fare for the most part. It isn't the crimes that are the point, more the daffy way that the detective goes about ""solving"" them. He believes that everything in the world is interconnected and so following any lead no matter how disconnected with the case will eventually lead to the solution of the problem.

Unfortunately, when all is said and doe the show becomes just as formulaic as a Sherlock, House or CSI episode, with the missed obvious clue spotted two minutes before the show ends trope being worn almost threadbare.

I'm not really surprised the show was cancelled, though the scripts were very promising (if a bit uneven). The idea just doesn't seem to have much mileage in it from where I'm sitting, and the lead character is essentially an unlikable ""House"" type working a ""House"" type problem (as in: obscured and requiring many resets and restarts). We've already seen that before.

However, as a four show package it represents a worthwhile use of time, or did for me. I can recommend it with four stars as it stands.

Bizarre ""Gently"" style connection: The day I watched these (in one sitting) I turned off the DVD player and the cable station re-asserted itself on the TV,  and I was immediately shown a commercial for a coming attraction to be shown this October - ""Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"". Apparently the idea is being remade in an American setting a-la Sherlock, something which I was unaware of until that point.",1472774400,,2031,4.7175141242937855
5536715,4,B00AZNEVK2,It was funny but the lead character got a bit tiresome after a while. While I did enjoy watching the series I remember enjoying the book a lot more. Maybe it is because I was younger then. Maybe he's just more of an ass in the movie version. If you like Ace Ventura and Monty Python you will probably like this series. I'm glad I got it but I'm giving it away as I doubt I'll want to watch it again.,1472342400,2,399,3.9382716049382718
5536716,5,B00AZNEVK2,"The only problem with this series is it ended too soon. The dry British humor stays true to form, and captures the comedic genius of Douglas Adams.

5536733,3,B00AZNEVK2,"Bottom Line First: Not that funny. For some reason holistic detective work looks a like all other Sherlock Holmes based detective work. The lead is a mostly hateful twerp, made up to look and directed to act as ugly and creepy as possible. This is not too far from the Dirk Gently books, but on screen it can be hard to watch. For diehard fans of the late Douglas Adams and for those who like misogynist, socially repulsive private eyes who can solve their cases. An attentive viewer who is not snowed by the holistic stuff will usually have an idea of the solution long before the reveal.
))0((
There were only two books in the Dirk Gently series, mostly because of the early passing of author, Douglas Adams. I found the first one a tad hard to read. The second, was a fun ride with a wacky detective. The original broadcast of this TV show somehow got by me and I was eager to see the 2 DVD set. I am happiest that it is only a 2 DVD set.

The character of Dirk Gently was never meant to be attractive. This much the writers and director got correct. The problem is that the TV Dirk Gently is not intended to be taken in controlled bites. You are expected to watch him be aggravating, dishonest and otherwise unlikable for an hour at a time. This tops being funny and starts being aggravating. This is not what I want as my television watching experience.

The various plots are more or less tinged with Sci-Fi aspects, and the politics of the late 1980s, actually more like the 1970s but Adams was not one to produce copy on time. Of course he does not get along well with women, real ones anyway. Of course Dirk does illegal break ins and hides evidence, is hated by the local police and in turn has a low opinion of them and takes it personal when his clients die, esp before paying for services rendered and so on down the usual check list.

I had been hoping for something more like A Hitch Hikers guide to the Galaxy and got something more like Sherlock Holmes but with a less pleasant personality.  Keep in mind the original Sherlock Holmes was not known for his social graces.",1450310400,3,2087,4.3573264781491
5536734,5,B00AZNEVK2,What a quirky fun series.,1447891200,,25,4.2
5536735,5,B00AZNEVK2,"Great, albeit very short show.",1447459200,,30,5.2
5536736,2,B00AZNEVK2,"The pilot was an ok start, but it devolves into an uninventive, and perpetual, re-hashing of blatant Dirk Gently tropes lifted directly from the books (of which there was not a broad range, as there were only 2 books) and pasted into the show.  Fairly lame as an end result.
Sadly, aside from having a one-trick-pony feel, the basic character of D.G. is completely wrong.  Instead of creating a D.G. from the books, they went with some hip, fresh, young, newer re-imaging for him.  It's like they went with whatever they could reference from current popular shows they could relate to in positive ratings terms.

""Hey, I have an idea for a show!""
""What?""
""Dirk Gently! ... He's a character from a popular author -- you know, The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy guy!""
""Does it have a mass market appeal?""
""Kids would love it!  It would be very popular with the younger demographics -- like Dr Who!""
""Dr Who?  That one show with that rooster looking fellow and that Harry Potter villain taking turns as the main character?""
""Uh, ... yeah, that one!""
""Oh, ok, good, yes, my daughter loves that show.  Very hip, very popular. I like it. Who do we have that looks like those Doctor characters?  He definitely has the right appeal for prime target demographics.""

And so we have a wacky and zany Doctor caricature humping along as Dirk Gently (with a companion, even!), and the constant and repetitive trotting out of a few plagiarized ideas from the books over and over again, like a monkey banging away on some cymbals.  And, in the last 2 episodes (half of the run), the injection of an episodic hottie (""love interest"") seemed quite off.  Definitely a lack of originality, and the writing/dialogue is definitely subpar to Adams, grossly subpar.
I wanted to like the show, but  .  Maybe they just didn't have time to find their stride.  Or maybe not.  It probably would have been better if they just tried to do something more original, and simply borrows heavily from Dirk Gently; like the X-Files / Kolchak.",1446508800,,2006,4.691428571428571

5536753,4,B00AZNEVK2,Interesting take on the books by Douglas Adams.,1423353600,,47,5.0
5536754,4,B00AZNEVK2,"any way ya look at it, Douglas Adams is one of the most unique authors who ever wrote. his singular artistic vision is easiest to describe as Monty Python meets Kurt Vonnegut. for my money his magnum-opus, The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, remains the very finest science-fiction book(s) ever written. to say nothing of the fact that he wrote two and a half of the very best adventures for classic Doctor Who, ""The Pirate Planet"" and ""City Of Death."" (a third, ""Shada,"" was stalled in mid-filming by a BBC production strike, but had the potential to be everything the other two are.)
but alas, he was such a slow writer that he was equally famous for missing his deadlines. (he once quipped ""i love deadlines. i love the wooshing sound they make as they whiz by."") he managed only two non-Hitchhiker novels, those centering on Dirt Gently, a ""holistic"" detective who's ideals and methods are bizarre enough to make Sherlock Holmes look like Sgt. Joe Friday. the character couldn't help but get lost in the shadow of Arthur Dent & Company, but he has managed to develop enough of a following in his own right to make you wonder what took him so long to make it to film.
on the whole this series is as delightful as it is overdue. it's creator, one Howard Overman, clearly has an affection for the source material. it is presented and built upon in such a way as to surely make Douglas proud. it can't quite replicate the plots of the two novels for a number of reasons, but it does manage to transfer the feel and spirit of this singular character and his singular world. Dirk's unique adherence to ""the fundamental interconnectedness of all things"" finds him going on all sorts of seemingly random tangents, and he finds himself dealing with everything from murders to conspiracy theories to time travel.
fitting the role of our almost but not quite bumbling hero like the proverbial glove is one Stephen Mangan. he faultlessly conveys the character's obsession, unconventionality, and quirky outside-the-box way of thinking. his interpretation comes off as Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock's goofy kid brother. indeed the promising series is (or maybe i should say ""could've blossomed into"") the point where Doctor Who and Sherlock meet. (makes you wonder what Stephen Moffatt thinks of it, doesn't it?)
as has already been said more than once, a lead is only as good as his cast enables him to be. sure enough, Mangan's performance is only enhanced by Darren Boyd as his more by-the-book assistant/partner (depending on who's making the introductions), Helen Baxendale as Boyd's tart but tolerant squeeze, Jason Watkins as a police inspector with less than a fondness for Gently, and Lisa Jackson as his disgruntled secretary. (the agency isn't exactly thriving, you see, and she can't remember when she last collected wages.)
so the good news is the series isn't at all bad. but there's news of the other kind as well...
the BBC, for typically vague reasons worded in textbook bureaucratize, opted not to renew Dirk's adventures.
this is a particular bummer because there's a certain foreplay quality, a suggestion that the best is yet to come. it experiments with a range that could've evolved into something quite special. one episode in particular makes the tantalizing but unfulfillable suggestion that the Pentagon has their eyes on Dirk. how did he get their attention? at what point and under what circumstances were their paths destined to cross? what did they suspect him of and how would he go about defusing those suspicions? chances are the world will never know. (or as Douglas would say, ""i decline to answer on the grounds that i don't know the answer."")
so if such a dead-end is likely to frustrate you, you probably shouldn't bother. but on the other hand, anyone who appreciates Douglas Adams' whimsically iconoclastic vision won't be sorry.",1421107200,9,3865,4.902290076335878

5536776,5,B00AZNEVK2,"The late great Douglas Adams is famous, of course, for his funny and crazy Hitchhikers Guide science fiction novels. But these books aren't his only claim to fame. His brand of quirky and amusing science fiction is also well displayed in the made-for-TV episodes of this DVD, that are all based on some of his short stories about Dirk Gently, a wacky but effective private detective who solves complex crimes of a bizarre nature. A missing cat, time travel and the concept of synchronicity (even seemingly random occurrences are connected in the fabric of our reality) are all involved in one particularly enjoyable story. There are only a few episodes, which is disappointing. Sadly, Adams was not with us long enough to provide more stories of this kind. He is missed.",1397606400,3,770,4.885496183206107
5536777,5,B00AZNEVK2,I'm glad Amazon had it available.  I had recorded the set from the TV but somehow they didn't come through very well.  A pleasure to get such good copies.,1393372800,,154,4.275862068965517
5536778,3,B00AZNEVK2,"I purchased this on the strength of the reviews. It's OK, but not great. The laughs are few and far between and the characters are quirky, but perhaps not quirky enough.",1389398400,,169,4.483870967741935
5536779,4,B00AZNEVK2,"An interesting and quirky dramatization of Douglas Adams writing. Not entirely what I expected, but certainly well worth watching with good acting and well written script.",1386806400,,171,5.615384615384615
5536780,5,B00AZNEVK2,"Meet Dirk Gently (Stephen Mangan): half conman, half detective, half mad and all insolent cheapskate. In four movies loosely based on the Douglas Adams books, Dirk spins his bizarre and implausible cases to their twisted inevitable conclusions. Readers of the Adams books will recognize the tongue-in-cheek inclusions of the refrigerator from hell, unpaid receptionist, mysterious homicidal cleaning lady and Gilks, the enraged police detective. See if you can spot the momentary flash of the giant stuffed eagle in his office.

Dripping snark and pizza remnants, Dirk runs up unlikely expenses while stealing food and linking random coincidences with his quantum-level theory of the interconnectedness of all things. He dupes Richard MacDuff (Darren Boyd) into financing and joining Dirk as his partner? assistant? patsy? much to the dismay of MacDuff's girlfriend, Susan Harmison (Helen Baxendale). They shamble though each case, often to MacDuff's horror, yet somehow survive and sorta triumph in the end.",1383955200,2,1008,5.631578947368421
5536781,5,B00AZNEVK2,"These British programs of Dirk Gently just blew me away. They are entertaining, clever and just plain fun. I have seen all 4 total programs and I find it hart to believe that the BBC decided not to make anymore programs of Dirk Gently. Is the BBC on drugs? This is like the programs of the century and yet, they are pussyfooting around making more of them. Shame on BBC.",1382745600,,370,4.3
5536782,3,B00AZNEVK2,"As a long-time fan of Douglas Adams and the books this series is based on, I was excited to see the characters of the Dirk Gently series come to life in a TV series. The pilot episode of the series was actually very well written and the spirit of the the source intellectual property (the novels) was clearly there. However, as the series continued, the episodes became less and less like the source material. Still, there was some great dialog and the main protagonist character retained several of the qualities that made his literary counterpart appealing in the first place!",1379808000,,578,4.79
5536783,2,B00AZNEVK2,Douglas Adams was a brilliant author. I loved the Dirk Gently character. The series Dirk Gently was a poor reflection of the book's  hero. Snippets of moments from the books are inserted haphazardly into the story to lend some legitimacy to the show but fail miserably. Get the audio books read by Douglas to really understand who Dirk is.,1379030400,,339,4.745762711864407
5536784,5,B00AZNEVK2,4 wonderful funny additions to the original books. Wish DNA was here to give us more. The web of interconnectedness continues. Hoping for more to come.,1378252800,,151,4.846153846153846

Too bad there are only four. Perhaps more Dirk will be seen in some future incarnation...we can only hope.",1378166400,,260,5.069767441860465
5536786,4,B00AZNEVK2,"About the only things the series had in common with the books were the character names ( though not the actual characters),the concept of the interconnectedness of all things, and the personality of Dirk Gently. If you never read the books you won't know this and won't care, because the series is good.",1378080000,,303,4.735849056603773
5536787,5,B00AZNEVK2,Great actors and totally off-beat humor abound in this short-lived mystery series.  The Douglas Adams influence is very apparent in these few episodes.  Was very pleased with my choice.  The first episode with reference to Schrodinger's Cat was intriguing with lots of humor.,1378080000,,275,5.348837209302325
5536788,5,B00AZNEVK2,"Seriously had doubts about this, as couldn't imagine how any TV production wouldn't do a decent job of bringing the Douglas Adams hero to the small screen - WITHOUT the original plot lines. and new characters BUT the team here has done it and done it brilliantly well! My only objection is ONLY FOUR episodes including the pilot, and I was just whetting my appetite!
With a nod & a wink here to the original DNA plot-lines these episodes are well thought out, excellently acted and well produced!
(An Aside - just incidentally - Stephen Mangan would make a great smallscreen 'Jerry Cornelius' if anyone is reconsidering dramatizing the books f Michael Moorcock)
Can't recommend this DVD set enough...sure to become a collectors item, get it while you can!",1373760000,9,755,4.8604651162790695

8559843,5,B00AZNEVK2,"I love this series, and as much as I like Elijah Woods, I think it's a shame they didn't go on with this show. Patrick Mangan IS DirkGently! If you haven't seen this show you are missing out on one of the best adaptations of a Douglas Adam's books ever. I give it 10 stars out of 5!",1512950400,,282,3.8793103448275863
8559844,5,B00AZNEVK2,"Look, I'm an American...and though I like Elijah Wood as much as the next guy, I just don't get the American version of ""Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"". It's entertaining enough, but it is not ""Dirk Gently"". This version is the only true version, as far as I'm concerned, with a tone that most closely matches the genius that is Douglas Adams. The characters and actors are great -- Stephen Mangan is spot on in his role. Patiently waiting for a Dirk Gently/Sherlock crossover. Wouldn't that be great?! Please make more!",1511740800,5,530,4.835164835164835
8559845,4,B00AZNEVK2,"The original Dirk Gently, not to be confused with the show that is currently airing.  This show gives us a different actor playing Dirk Gently and takes out the science fiction that exists in the new series. This Dirk is very cheap and still believes in the interconnectedness of things as a way of solving cases. This show is not as good as the new one, but it is worth watching. This DVD set has 3 episodes and a pilot.",1511222400,,421,4.2625
8559846,5,B00AZNEVK2,OK if you have NOT watched this - - you are missing out!  We watched it on TV and had to buy it so I could watch it over and over again!  Next rainy day I'm going to break it out again.  This is so funny!,1510963200,,204,3.391304347826087

8559848,5,B00AZNEVK2,Purchased this after viewing the BBC's TV show Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. It's very funny and keeps with Douglas Adam's character Dirk Gently pretty well. I think Douglas Adams would approve if he were still with us.,1504915200,,230,5.078947368421052
