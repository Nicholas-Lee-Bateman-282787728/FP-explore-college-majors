3615904,1,B001GMH8VA,"I don't usually write reviews for anything, but this movie was soooo bad I felt compelled to let others know NOT to watch this movie.

I'm pretty open-minded when watching movies and like all kinds. I didn't find this movie at all funny or interesting, or even slightly amusing. My husband is an even bigger movie buff than I and he found this movie worthless.

It was the worst movie I had ever seen...  worse than House of 1000 Corpses. If I could, I would have rated this movie a big, fat ZERO.

If I were a guy, I'd say that the only good thing about this movie are the scenes with the nearly naked women fondling each other. Can't say I was that surprised since it was a National Lampoon movie.

Do. Not. Watch.",1240876800,6,716,4.274074074074074
3615905,3,B001GMH8VA,"National Lampoon movies of the last few years have really gone down in comedic value compared to some of there original hit movies. You may be pleased to know that this particular one is a step above some of the more recent ones, and fun to watch.

Set in the caveman era, Homo Erectus stars Adam Rifkin as Ishbo who is a geek type of loser who can't score with the cavegirls and lives in the shadow of his bigger, stronger, more athletic, butcher, more popular brother... basically a cave jock.

However Ishbo is actually the smartest caveman, but none of the others are smart enough to realize his ideas are smart, and want to stick to there primitive ways. So Ishbo is considered the stupidest caveman because he wants to evolve and the other cavmen don't even know what that means.

Ishbo's best friend and crush, Fardart (Ali Larter) end's up being clubbed by his brother and becomes his brothers wife. However, his brother cares nothing about her, and Ishbo still wants to be with her. He receives his chance later in the movie.

Also starring Garey Busey, Carol Alt, that chick from independence day, the master from Kung Fu (legend continues) and surprisingly Ron Jeromy!

Don't expect this to be anything more then a goofy, campy, silly kind of movie. There is nothing factual about this movie, it's just something for fun.

The comedy is something like American Pie meets those cheesy 80's flicks with lots of skin thrown in in case someone noticed there was very little to the plot if there is any.

Overall, it wasn't too bad, I hired this with very little expectation, but in the end, I thought it was pretty funny. It's not classic comedy, it won't have a cult following, but ehh, it's ok for a rental at least.",1229472000,2,1725,4.5811688311688314
3615949,3,B001GMH8VA,This movie has a lot of very funny moments and had a ton of potential.  It almost feels like they rushed to finish the last third and didn't develop the humor there.  Could have been a home run...instead fly out.,1328745600,,212,4.275
3615950,1,B001GMH8VA,"Hands down the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I sat through the whole thing thinking that maybe, just maybe, there would be some redeeming quality about it. That it would at least be funny or interesting or something.

I was dead wrong, from start to finish it was a boring and pathetic look at an idiot's life.

To this movie I say:

What you've just shown me is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever seen. At no point in your rambling, incoherent storyline were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational and interesting narrative. Everyone involved in this movie is now dumber for having seen it. I award you no stars, and may God have mercy on your soul.

If this comes on TV, maybe Comedy Central, and you're bored enough to watch it. Change the channel, do something else, because there are a million things that would be better than watching this film.",1312156800,,901,4.442424242424242

3615953,2,B001GMH8VA,"Like most comedies with shallow plots, this one treats you to some silly bathroom humor fit for young boys approaching sexual maturity.  Would have been great had I been in 8th grade and filled the room with my giggling buddies but beyond the T and A shots, it leaves you wanting for the humor.  Rifkin actually thought this was funny??  I think he could have done a lot better. It will be on my next yard sale table.",1285632000,,417,4.32051282051282
3615954,1,B001GMH8VA,"Lampoons are hit and miss with me.  This one was a big disappointment.  I found it very, very unfunny.  I laughed two times in the whole movie, otherwise it was one of the most boring movies I've seen.  Had more fun reading the negative reviews here on amazon.  BTW, I was going to list this as one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen until two days later I watched Surfer Dude. Unbelievable!  But I'll save that for it's own review.",1263340800,2,436,4.320987654320987
3615955,3,B001GMH8VA,"In a sarcastic form moviemakers have embedded a very notion of their surrounding which is jealousy and hatred of creative people if, especially, their out-of-a-grey-crowd natural stand does not fit social place they supposed for.

During ninety minutes authors leave a little non-satirised, whether it is nudism, same gender issues, feminism or family affairs.

Female nudity traditionally representing a top of aesthetic pleasure in modern civilised societies, is of a questionable apprehension while exhibited on a screen abundantly. Perhaps, a less popular title ""National Lampoon's Homo Erectus"" transparently poinits at authors' idea.

Not much miracles surround real people in a real life, and a major character forced down a cliff to only become a ""typical pre-historic specimen"" in the museum of a natural history erected circa two million years since his story had occurred.

In any case, this work is much better than both ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300/dp/B000QXDED6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300</a>&nbsp;and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meet-the-Spartans/dp/B00177YA06/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meet the Spartans</a>"", surely.",1254268800,2,1227,6.896774193548387
3615956,5,B001GMH8VA,"Wow. Apparently you either love this movie or you hate it.  I'm definitely amongst those that loved it.

As a fan of classic comedy by the true classic film comedians (Marx Brothers, Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, and more recently Jim Carrey), I think Adam Rifkin's cinematic offerings deservedly have a place with them. Like the movies of the above-mentioned comedy stars, ""Stoned Age"" is packaged and presented as zany, numb-skull entertainment, but executed with true wit and life-long knowledge of how to conjure up a laugh.

Like Allen and Brooks, Rifkin places his protagonist (""Ishbo"", played by Rifkin himself) in a foreign setting (prehistoric time) as if he were a modern day, overly-analytical nebbish that was suddenly transported back in time and is awkwardly left to deal with his dangerous and illogical new surroundings. When offered the bar-b-qued foot of a fallen tribesman, Ishbo refuses the disgusting extremity under the excuse that he's on a diet, to which the chef replies ""What's a diet?"". And we don't even question how cave man Ishbo came upon a pair of glasses. And it's great that Rifkin doesn't feel his audience is clueless enough to have to have it explained to them. Rifkin uses modern banter sparingly enough that when it happens, it seems as foreign to us as it does to his spear-chucking contemporaries, and the results are effectively funny.

There's a crazy quilt of a cast in ""Stoned Age"" which includes the late David Carradine, Tom Arnold, Talia Shire, porn star Ron Jeremy, Gary Busey, and a very, very competent (and gorgeous) Ali Larter who proves to have some amazing comedy timing. I don't know if Rifkin hired her mainly for her curves, but he got a true comedienne in the deal.

Granted you have your gratuitous gay cave man and Mastodon turds routines, but most of the movie is fraught with hysterical parody that really would be at home within the pages of National Lampoon Magazine. My favorite bit is the faux acid trip Ishbo experiences which finds him laughing at the dancing drawings on the cave walls and results in a helacious hangover and the discovery that the wild jungle sex he had that night was not with the cave girl of his dreams as he imagined. I also laughed my rocks off at the scene where a bevy of beautiful bare-breasted lesbian amazons wash Ishbo in the pond in preparation of impregnating the entire tribe. It's filmed exactly live a booty-shaking pool side hip-hop video with a hilarious original rap song to go with it.

Oh, and there's tons of DVD extras including Penthouse and Maxim Magazine photo shoots of the movie's cave girls.  As much as I appreciate a well oiled cave girl booty, I didn't think the shoots had much relevance to the movie and it kind of dumbed the package down for me. But I have a sinking feeling I'm in the minority of that opinion.  :)

As I said, you either love it or you hate it. At the price this DVD is selling for, it seems to be a better deal than actually renting it (I should have waited for these cheaper prices). For two or three bucks I guarantee you'll either laugh your butt off or you'll find a friend to give it to who will appreciate the wit and whackiness of ""Stoned Age"".
With better distribution there's no doubt this movie would be considered at home next to the works of Mel Brooks and The Marx Brothers. Hell, they even killed off the funnier original title (""Homo Erectus"") because the DVD distributors probably assumed  the more conservative and less educated video store dwellers would be offended.",1248825600,2,3522,4.712195121951219
3615957,1,B001GMH8VA,"Awful, this is one of the worst movies ever made. NL was once the mecca of amazing comedies, but now they are far from it, they make crude and mean jokes about other films and directors while THEY make movies like this one. Year One has the same idea and was truly brilliant, this however is a low budget, camp filled piece of garbage.",1247356800,2,335,4.25
3615958,5,B001GMH8VA,"There's been some strong buzz about this film for a while on line thanks to a whole bunch of trailers and funny little videos. I really wanted to check this film out for a host of reasons, not the least of which are Ali Larter (who's hot as Hell), Miles Dougal (Star of many a Giuseppi Andrews epic) and Rifkin, who I've been a fan of since DETROIT ROCK CITY.  Having only seen the web trailer and a couple of viral vids I could only hope that it wasn't the type of film that tries to show you so much of the funny gags in the trailer, then while your watching it you're sitting there saying to yourself, ""wow I should have just watched the trailer for 88mins"".

THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE FILMS! From the opening scene, a reference to 2001, to the closing scene, an obvious homage to Buster Keaton, this film delivers! NATIONAL LAMPOON'S STONED AGE is about a prehistoric Einstein named Ishbo whose tribe believes that both his inventions and the fact that he doesn't believe in clubbing women, is completely insane!! Ishbo (Played by Rifkin) is a caveman with some great ideas! Ideas that will help man evolve, but his father Mookoo (David Carradine), brother Thudnik (Hayes Macarthur), and friends Zig & Zog (Giuseppe Andrews and Miles Dougal) just don't understand why he isn't content living the life that the tribe has come to know and love. The film also features Ali Larter, Tom Arnold, Talia Shire, Bill Tyree (another Giuseppi regular), Gary Busey, Ron Jeremy, & Lin Shaye.

Now don't get me wrong, this isn't GODFATHER PART 2, but it's obviously not meant to be. It's just a funny little caveman movie that's smart, silly and really well done. And the cave babes are sexy as hell! From the opening scene with Miles Dougal (Zog) all the way to the very last frame tight on Adam propped up in a neanderthal man display in a history museum, this little film keeps it in 5th gear and doesn't slow down. From clubbing chicks to Mastodon hunts gone awry, Thudnik shows us what it would've been like (more so how easy) to become the Alpha-Male. While Ishbo is busy inventing things like bikes, fishing nets, and pants... his buddies Zig & Zog are busy finding things to smoke their funny grass out of. Meanwhile the love of Ishbo's life Fardart (Ali Larter) is trying to set him up with his lovely cousin, who just so happens to be an ape. Ishbo really can't catch a break, especially the night of his brother's bachelor party before he marries Fardart and he has one to many drinks with his cousin. Ishbo ends up screwing the chimp. Gross! Rifkin said that Woody Allen was a big inspiration to him and you can definitely see the influence. Not in a copy cat way, but the film shows obvious reference to his idol.

The DVD is LOADED with extras like bloopers, deleted scenes, outtakes, music videos, and ""old fool raps"". Also is the lovingly produced ""GAY-vemen"" featurette. The disc has a HILARIOUS commentary track, not your standard directors track, but done knowingly poking fun at themselves and each other. All you ""dirty caveman"" be sure to check out the ""STONED AGE PENTHOUSE PHOTO SHOOT"" & ""STONED AGE MAXIM PHOTO SHOOT"". This DVD is sure to become a cult classic and a must have for all DVD collectors. --- Jeremy Morrison",1242432000,3,3234,4.570689655172414

8306064,2,B001GMH8VA,"The Paramount release of Homo erectus (Stoned age) is odd in that Paramount usually releases unambiguous versions. So, why is this release confusing?

Aspect ratio.  As a general rule I usually determine a DVD/BD AR by picking an object I know to be round (e.g. car tyre, sun, moon, watch) so I know what ratio to set the TV on.  With this release I had to use the zoom function (on the rising sun) to get it right. Something wrong there as now some of the screen is cut off.

Run time.  IMDB lists the run time as 88 minutes.  This is the supposed 'unrated' version so one would expect additional run time. Not so. Unless the cut out material constitutes less than 60 seconds I think we have been duped.

On the plus side this does have subtitles unlike the Oz release but overall it is a sub-par release for Paramount.",1406678400,,820,4.355263157894737

8306066,4,B001GMH8VA,"I had just watched Meet the Spartans, which came out around the same time as this one. What a difference between the two. Or even Year One, with Jack Black (that one being a cave man movie). In comparison... Meet the Spartans was a sequence of parodies linked together that wasn't very funny, and no story. Year One was a really tired Jack Black movie.

Homo Erectus isn't a comedy classic, but it blows those two movies away. The sequences were funny and nicely surreal at times, the support characters were good (Gary Busey going snake eyes, David Carradine as the cave man dad, and even Ron Jeremy)... and seeing Ali Larter, also of Heroes...

I'd probably rate this a 3 and a half stars. Those who gave it one stars have no sense of humor. This is a fun, raunchy, old school style comedy.",1367452800,,792,4.455172413793103
