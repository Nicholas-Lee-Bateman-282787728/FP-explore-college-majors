7961107,4,B000065Q9B,"I have just started to watch this dvd, but from what I've seen so far, I'm pretty impressed.  The History Channel Presents America's Greatest Victories features: (1.  Nimitz at Midway  (2.  Eishenhower on D-Day (3.  Patton at the breakdown from Normandy (I think it should be correctly titled, Patton at the breakout from Normandy) (4.  Halsey at Leyte Gulf  (5.  MacArthur in the Philippines (6. Schwarzkopf at Desert Storm

I've watched Nimitz at Midway and Eisenhower on D-Day and both of those features were well done.  My father was a World War II vet so I grew up listening to tales about World War II so I don't consider myself a total novice about World War II though I'm no expert.  Well, Nimitz and Eisenhower was presented throughly enough that if I had no idea who Nimitz and Eisenhower were, I would understand who both were by the end of their programs.  The features also included their opponents which for Nimitz was Yamamoto and for Eisenhower was Von Rundstedt.  Both features gave biographies of both commanders before and after the combat which gave a personal touch to the presentations.  If you want a good primer of some important American battles and a profile of the commanders that fought those battles, I would recommend America's Greatest Victories highly.",1108425600,7,1284,4.857142857142857
