8145313,3,B000IFRRV2,"I really don't know many of the people in this DVD that are telling their stories about Rory, but that is what this is - THEIR stories. It was nice to see the historical side of Rory in the states, but this probably won't be watch too many more times",1387238400,,250,4.02

It appears to open and screen presents ""Play"", but it won't - any suggestions would be appreciated.",1287360000,,292,4.490566037735849
8145315,4,B000IFRRV2,"I stumbled on this DVD by accident while searching for something else pertaining to Rory Gallagher.  I have been a long time fan who never had the privilege of seeing him live, in the States.  I thought Songs & Stories was a very raw, real & touching account of Rory's life and impact on music.  You see the love and reverence Rory's legion have for him, long after his death.  You get to see that ""up-close-and-personal,"" because Rory's brother, Donal, is doing a lot of the story telling. I think the producers of this DVD caught the core of Rory's beginnings to tell the ""story."" Songs & Stories gives insight to Rory's ""every man"" persona - how genuine he was.  He was just a guy doing a job. Make the gig. Not just the buck.  Never compromise the talent; pride in the work. This is caught in numerous candid interviews of peers, musicians and family.

I always loved Rory's music, but I gained new respect for him because I learned that he could have blown down a lot of doors in the USA, but he wasn't going to compromise his vision. Songs & Stories was a lucky accident for me.  Any music fan will be captivated by this artful biography of Rory Gallagher.",1247875200,12,1162,4.422535211267606
