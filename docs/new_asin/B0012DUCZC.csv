3086554,5,B0012DUCZC,"I am terribly out of shape. I needed to begin exercising again. This program is perfect. It is aerobic but not so intense that it can't be done. Every day I can do a little more than the day before.. The pace is good, the changes and variety are fun.",1381449600,2,250,4.02
3086555,4,B0012DUCZC,"it is something to do when I cannot go for a walk or do more vigorous routines. It is not the hardest or work up a sweat kind ,but is better than not doing any. I love that there is not talking or ""come on you can do it"" by some over gregarious 'instructor' just examples of a bit of low impact exercises to get your daily 20 minutes +.",1375488000,3,336,3.8142857142857145
3086556,3,B0012DUCZC,"And the walkers are kind of weird looking. Tall and skinny like aliens or something.
The work out is ok though",1372636800,8,110,4.285714285714286
3086557,2,B0012DUCZC,The video is old and I didn't like the fact that the instructor didn't talk during the video.  Was just looking for a quick exercise routine using the Kindle.,1370131200,,158,4.448275862068965
3086558,4,B0012DUCZC,i enjoyed the seeing by doing.  There is no dialog during this video.  that is a nice change of pace.,1367107200,,101,4.0
3086559,2,B0012DUCZC,just not what I was looking for.  Wanted something that had more to it.  More movement and talking through it.,1365897600,2,110,4.45
3086560,3,B0012DUCZC,If you have amazon prime its worth a stream just for the sheer retro hilarity of it. Their outfits...kinda make you wonder where the matching capes are.,1364256000,6,152,4.666666666666667
3086561,4,B0012DUCZC,"I am just getting back into exercising again after a few years of very intermittent exercise.  I am 50 something and was a runner and avid gym attendee for many years and just slowed down over time. 25 pounds later, I am ready to shed the extra pounds and this an excellent start.  As the other reviewer noted, you can make it as intense as you want adding to the hand and leg movements with your own choreography.  The time goes by very quickly.  It feels like 15 minutes of exercise in 27 minutes and you can easily add your own 3 minutes of steps to make it an even 30 minutes.  Worth doing if you are inactive and looking to stay healthy and limber as you age.",1361145600,6,664,4.15625
3086562,4,B0012DUCZC,"If you want to see what exercise clothing used to look like, then look no further.  This is definitely a dated video, but it has merit for those who want to get moving with simple steps. The music is redundant and cheesy, but I can't find fault with the concept even if the production value is almost non-existent.  This is like watching an video game exercise program.  That said, you can easily change this up and add more intensity by using your arms more, so it's a great starter video.  Next time I will try turning the volume off and use my own music. There are no spoken instructions and the steps are very easy to follow. Well worth trying out if you are home-bound or prefer to work out at home some or all of the time.",1358380800,10,728,4.253623188405797
3086563,1,B0012DUCZC,"I have Prime so I thought I would try this as an alternative to Leslie Sansone's walking videos, and with Prime it's free.  BUT...I am shocked that they would even try to sell this.  No audio instructions, which is really okay, but this video was obviously shot in the 1990s, complete with clothes and hair.  ALSO, it is not a walking video.  The steps are straight from 1990s low impact aerobic tapes of old.  I knew all the steps which isn't bad, but this video IS bad.  Don't every buy or rent this.  Watch it for free for a giggle, but NEVER pay money for this.",1357084800,,565,4.273584905660377
3086583,4,B0012DUCZC,Very basic walking workout that is easy to do and you can listen to your own music while walking. Easy for an awesome older bod.,1457395200,,128,4.16
3086584,4,B0012DUCZC,"More my speed, not a lot of talk, just music and easy to follow movements and a free offer included in Amazon Prime.

3086588,1,B0012DUCZC,"I suppose if it was 1989 I would be amazed - but, in 2016, nah, not so much - - I thought this video would be treadmill or elliptical workout, but it was just some folks in bad leotards, moving around to bad music.  If you need a giggle, check it out, but if you want to workout to it, don't bother!",1455753600,,299,3.8225806451612905
3086589,4,B0012DUCZC,"Gives some variety to the ""Fonda Walk Fit"" - very similar routines, but walks at least another 1/4 mile.  Easy, low-impact.",1455580800,,123,4.857142857142857
3086590,1,B0012DUCZC,"Bad photography and video quality. ""Stick-figure"" animation explaining the moves. No annoying cheerleading, but there are no words spoken at all. Interestingly, there are a number of  strange crotch shots. At least it was included with Prime.",1453593600,,242,5.54054054054054

3086592,4,B0012DUCZC,"Yes, it's from the pioneer days, but if you are starting anew or coming back from a laps in your exercise routine, this is a good ""starter"" video. I've been recovering from health issues for months now, and since I'm totally out of shape this was a good fit: easy, but gets you moving.  **Note: there is no verbal direction, so if you've never done aerobics before you might want to try a video with verbal instructions.",1453075200,,420,4.454545454545454
3086614,4,B0012DUCZC,I like this video for its simple straight forward moves that manage to keep me moving to the end. I usually play this muted on my kindle while I watch something else on my tv.,1448064000,,175,4.0285714285714285

3086616,1,B0012DUCZC,"Not, this is NOT, not, not, NOT walking. This is a bad mislabeled aerobics routine. And it's a bad aerobics routine: Eerily silent and out-of-sync dancers, too much skin and too little spandex.

3086620,3,B0012DUCZC,It's pretty poor quality video (either just a very OLD video or they used antiquated equipment) ...  but it does serve the purpose - and it was free so 'you get what you pay for' ...,1439424000,,182,4.055555555555555
3086621,5,B0012DUCZC,I have not worked out for several years! I used to be in incredible shape! Very athletic; very trim and slender. A series of illnesses let to soft muscles and 45 pounds of extra weight. Ugh! This is a great routine for someone who is starting to exercise for the first time. There is nothing strenuous about the routine. The video simply gets you moving (which is the whole point of any cardio routine).,1437609600,,403,4.45945945945946
3086622,2,B0012DUCZC,No directions or talking from the instructor.,1436745600,,45,5.571428571428571

3086654,1,B0012DUCZC,Very outdated watched first 5 minutes then turned it off,1433721600,,56,4.7
3086655,5,B0012DUCZC,Great all over walking exercise video.  There is no one talking to annoy you and she has a perfect balance for a 26 minute workout.,1433721600,2,131,4.24
3086656,4,B0012DUCZC,At age 72 I found it a great starter video. As time goes by I will look for something a bit more strenuous.,1433721600,,107,3.6956521739130435

3086659,4,B0012DUCZC,"This was an easy workout to do in your home without having to go anywhere.  The video is straight out of the 80's and has some weird cartoon instruction in between sets.  I broke a little bit of a sweat and it got me moving, that's all I was expecting.  One note, there's no narration or queues - it's silent except for the synthesizer music.  But, it's all 8 counts of activity so you can keep up pretty well just by watching.  (Also, the one lady in the braided pig tails looks like she could not possibly be happier to be doing this - it's hilarious!)",1431388800,,554,4.188679245283019
3086660,5,B0012DUCZC,Love it!  So hard to find time to walk so this is an easy watch before jumping in the shower in the morning!  For people who just want to do a light workout or just getting into exercise!,1430697600,,187,3.8947368421052633
3086661,5,B0012DUCZC,Great workout easy,1429488000,,18,5.333333333333333
3086662,4,B0012DUCZC,"Uses very easy walking techniques that also utilizes core work as well as some upper body toning without weights. It is a good way to warm up your body in the morning. If done correctly, you should get between 2,000 and 3,000 steps. And every little step you take...will be right around that room.",1427328000,,297,4.518518518518518

3086685,3,B0012DUCZC,Very dated. Could be a lot more aerobic.,1424822400,,40,4.125
3086686,5,B0012DUCZC,Love it! It is part of my routine to warm up before doing the estrenous exercises. However this alone works beautifullyif.,1419465600,,122,4.857142857142857
3086687,2,B0012DUCZC,Very basic... not much to it!,1418169600,,29,4.0
3086688,2,B0012DUCZC,"Don't let the cover fool you. You are hopping into the way-back machine with this video.
The fault I find with this video is that there is a mix of video and animation. I can't quite figure out what the animation part is instructing you to do. There are no vocals, so you just have to watch to know when you are going into a different move or repeating the same thing.
The outfits and music are pure retro. That part is not bad - it is what it is.
I definitely prefer Leslie Sansone for a walking video. I won't be watching this one again.",1414627200,,539,4.09433962264151

3086691,4,B0012DUCZC,"Horribly, horribly cheesy.  Of course, the laugh factor is good motivation to continue to the end.  This is a very low intensity workout that beginners can easily do.  As I'm just starting out (again), and my asthma prevents me from doing to strenuous a workout at this time, this was a good one.  One other thing I really liked is if you don't have much room to move around in, like I do in my small apartment, this will work easily for you.",1404345600,4,442,4.289156626506024
3086692,4,B0012DUCZC,"Very simple and precise.
Quick steps and procedures ....not at all boring.
Only complaint ::: I wish it was longer ....-_-",1400889600,,122,4.857142857142857
3086693,3,B0012DUCZC,"I have done this workout a couple times and its great for in between strength training sessions.  I have to laugh at the outfits, though.  This has to be a remake from the 80's even though it says from 2009.",1385164800,,207,4.15

I broke a little bit of a sweat and it got me moving, that's all I was expecting.  One note, there's no narration or queues - it's silent except for the synthesizer music.  But, it's all 8 counts of activity so you can keep up pretty well just by watching.  (Also, the one lady in the braided pig tails looks like she could not possibly be happier to be doing this - it's hilarious!)",1431388800,,554,4.188679245283019
3321157,5,B0012DUCZC,Love it!  So hard to find time to walk so this is an easy watch before jumping in the shower in the morning!  For people who just want to do a light workout or just getting into exercise!,1430697600,,187,3.8947368421052633
3321158,5,B0012DUCZC,Great workout easy,1429488000,,18,5.333333333333333
3321159,4,B0012DUCZC,"Uses very easy walking techniques that also utilizes core work as well as some upper body toning without weights. It is a good way to warm up your body in the morning. If done correctly, you should get between 2,000 and 3,000 steps. And every little step you take...will be right around that room.",1427328000,,297,4.518518518518518

3321182,3,B0012DUCZC,Very dated. Could be a lot more aerobic.,1424822400,,40,4.125
3321183,5,B0012DUCZC,Love it! It is part of my routine to warm up before doing the estrenous exercises. However this alone works beautifullyif.,1419465600,,122,4.857142857142857

3321185,2,B0012DUCZC,"Don't let the cover fool you. You are hopping into the way-back machine with this video.
The fault I find with this video is that there is a mix of video and animation. I can't quite figure out what the animation part is instructing you to do. There are no vocals, so you just have to watch to know when you are going into a different move or repeating the same thing.
The outfits and music are pure retro. That part is not bad - it is what it is.
I definitely prefer Leslie Sansone for a walking video. I won't be watching this one again.",1414627200,,539,4.09433962264151

3321188,4,B0012DUCZC,"Horribly, horribly cheesy.  Of course, the laugh factor is good motivation to continue to the end.  This is a very low intensity workout that beginners can easily do.  As I'm just starting out (again), and my asthma prevents me from doing to strenuous a workout at this time, this was a good one.  One other thing I really liked is if you don't have much room to move around in, like I do in my small apartment, this will work easily for you.",1404345600,4,442,4.289156626506024

Quick steps and procedures ....not at all boring.

3321190,3,B0012DUCZC,"I have done this workout a couple times and its great for in between strength training sessions.  I have to laugh at the outfits, though.  This has to be a remake from the 80's even though it says from 2009.",1385164800,,207,4.15
8245376,5,B0012DUCZC,Great for older people and flexibility,1522454400,,38,5.5
8245377,4,B0012DUCZC,"Yes, yes, as others have said, this is cheesy. My guess is that it's from the late 1980s. I wore those types of socks and sneakers (but not that leotard!) when I was doing high-impact aerobics back in those years. Today, not so much. I need low-impact and arthritis-friendly. This delivers exactly that. No ones speaks, and if you turn off the music, you could do the program while watching TV. It's that easy to follow. Do this routine when you're not up to anything strenuous but still want to get in some movement.",1492214400,,517,4.51063829787234
