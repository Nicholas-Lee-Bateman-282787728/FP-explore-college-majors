8585812,4,B00CSKL0S6,"I purchased this DVD in the wake of a recommendation, and thoroughly enjoyed it upon revisiting this classic sci fi classic.  In my case, the recommendation came via an interview concerning my favorite movie of all times, Ender's Game.  In an interview I saw featuring Asa Butterfield who is a totally cool and awesome actor, he mentioned that he is a sci fi fan and the Matrix was his favorite movie; so I figured I ought to get my own copy of this movie to revisit it, as I had seen it years ago already.  I was glad that I obtained this DVD, as in watching it again so many years later I really enjoyed it with greater understanding and appreciation.  Thanks, Asa!",1527724800,,667,4.3983739837398375
