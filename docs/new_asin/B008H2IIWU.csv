5161517,4,B008H2IIWU,"If you are not really familiar with these 2 operas, go first to the extras where Peter Sellars explains his understanding and realization of the two operas. Both operas use the same minimalistic staging and customs. For Iolanta it works beautifully. In fact it is possible that the premier failure of Iolanta was due to staging it as a grand opera, when in fact it is an intimate and personal opera. Sellars gives to this opera various meanings and he knows how to accomplished it. You may agree or disagree with Sellars, but his interpretation is very well executed. The orchestra and singers perform wonderful. The music is an intimate Tchaikovsky, different from his grandiose operas or ballets, a real treat. I was very impressed by Willard White playing Dr. Ibn-Hakia. In summary, a very enjoyable and well executed Iolanta.
Persophone is a little bit more difficult.  The libretto by Andre Gide is quite dense and needs full attention. I am sure something is missed in the translation to English for those who don't understand French.  I was not convinced by the minimalistic approach. I felt something was missing, in particular because it is difficult to visualize the transition between the abduction, Hell and then back to Earth.  The Cambodian dancers are a nice addition although at some points it gets a little bit confusing.  The general theme is too big for an intimate production in my opinion. Sellars linked both operas as the search for light, which is interesting and meaningful.  The pamphlet enclosed in the Blu-Ray disc lacks more details on the operas themselves.",1369872000,7,1587,4.951127819548872
5161518,4,B008H2IIWU,",,, is how much more I enjoyed the Tchaikovsky ""Iolanta"" than the Stravinsky ""Persephone!"" Tchaikovsky's music for this brief opera sounds bold and original, while Stravinsky's sounds ""dated"" and superficial. Hey, remember what Stravinsky said about Vivaldi? Well, it bounces etc: Stravinsky didn't write 20 ballets; he wrote one ballet twenty times. :-)

No, that's nonsense of course, but ""Persephone"" is a thin work as staged by Peter Sellars, one which can't decide whether to be a vivid ballet or a pretentious opera. It never becomes either, but the Cambodian dancers are certainly more entertaining than the lackluster singing of Paul Groves or the sub-Sprachstimme recitation of Dominique Blanc. Bottom line: boring.

""Iolanta"" on the other hand, with the same scanty sets, achieves both emotional and musical intensity. The Princess Iolanta is born blind in this folktale with classical resonance. Her father assumes the Divine Right of protecting her from self-knowledge of her deficiency. Eventually he realizes his ""sin"" against reality, being confronted with two rescuers, one a lover and the other a Wise Man. There are as many interpretations of such a fable as the audience has the perspicacity to recognize, but almost any interpretation marks ""iolanta"" as a work of ""spiritual"" depth. The libretto, by the way, was written by Modest Tchaikovsky.

""Iolanta"" is an intimate one-act opera, yet requires ten soloists! Most of these singers are Russian, and their diction makes the Russian language surprisingly lovely and music-worthy. The principals -- Ekaterina Scherbachenko as Iolanta and Pavel Cernoch as Vaudemont -- sing ecstatically. The obvious non-Russian of the cast -- Willard White as the wise doctor Ibn-Hakia -- has potent stage presence, both vocally and physically.

An easy five-star rating for Iolanta, based on the fact that I look forward to watching/hearing it again. No more than three for Persephone, though I can imagine a better production making the music more impressive.",1362009600,7,2013,5.380952380952381
5161519,5,B008H2IIWU,I am a grumpy old lady who hates minimalist productions.  And the same set and same costumes are used for two very different operas!! Should have been a recipe for disaster BUT I really loved both productions on this dvd.  I cannot agree more with the first reviewer.,1358985600,14,267,4.541666666666667
5161520,1,B008H2IIWU,"The same meaningless set and costumes for both works results in this video being no better than audio recordings of the two works and therefore, as far as I am concerned, a waste of my money.",1356998400,6,191,4.333333333333333
5161521,5,B008H2IIWU,"If you want to see how potent minimalistic staging, costumes and acting can be in opera then Peter Sellars' twin productions of Iolanta and Pers&eacute;phone, commissioned by Teatro Real's Artistic Director, Gerard Mortier, are the epitome of this style. From the moment the spotlight focuses on Ekaterina Scherbachenko and her attendants, and the first words of Tchaikovsky's Iolanta are sung, this production is captivating. The singing is superb throughout, as it has to be as there is nothing else happening on stage to hide any imperfection behind. Set on an otherwise empty stage the simple `door' frames, with their improbably balanced obsidian stones, are used to indicate different rooms and structures within the imagined spaces of the story. This works exceptionally well with the lighting effects used giving both depth and definition to the artists' movements on stage.

Sellars uses the same set for Stravinsky's Pers&eacute;phone to great effect with changing backdrops and lighting giving the simple frame structures a completely different feel. Whilst I felt Stravinsky's piece was less compelling musically it was beautifully performed and had the additional interest of the Cambodian dancers from Amrita Performing Arts who shadowed the story in their unique form of ballet.",1355443200,27,1293,5.49748743718593
5161522,4,B008H2IIWU,"First out, this release was filmed in 1982 for archival puposes, and some allowances need to be made. The Bolshoi Orchestra was extremely close-miked, making them sound rather inferior. And miking of the stage is not entirely consistent, but it is good enough to appreciate the excellent, typically Russian, singing.

But the opera itself is intriguing. In the early stages, I agreed with the reviewer above. But as it developed, and the simple plot emerged, so the music developed, until, by the end, we hear some of Tchaikovsky's best operatic work (admittedly, being a one-acter, only in 3 or 4 set pieces. It is as if Tchaikovsky wanted the music to develop, as the simple story developed.

I have little to add to what has been written above, except to say, listen to this a number of times. The music will grow on you and reveal qualities that may not be apparent at first listening. It is one of Tchaikovsky's last works, and far from bing inferior, is an essay in musical development, composed by a master composer and presented by good voices. I always advocate that an opera should be seen and a lot can be lost by listening to CD versions. I think this is one case where the glamourous staging contributes little to appreciating the rare work.",1294272000,16,1254,4.695454545454545
5161523,4,B008H2IIWU,"Since this is the only readily available video of Tchaikovsky's last opera, anyone interested in this composer's theatrical output will certainly want to have it (the 1963 Soviet/Latvian dubbed studio film of the work is rather quaint and sometimes appears on the web in the Dreamlife/Japanese edition).  The Bolshoi production is extremely traditional and limited in visual appeal, with curtains filling out the thin sets at the sides.  The soprano's voice is sharp and a bit screechy and the tenor very over-parted, although in general the singing is certainly adequate as well as heartfelt.  The final effect of the work is quite touching, especially because of the way it hints throughout at Tchaikovsky's tragically repressed homosexuality (this has been pointed out quite well by John Warrack among others).  The final scene (when the blind Iolanta is at last able to see) can even be read as a very touching (gay) coming out episode.  The fact that this one-act opera originally formed a double bill with the two-act Nutcracker ballet is also intriguing, and our understanding of what the now more famous ballet was all about is helped by seeing how the opera sets up certain themes of adolescence, freeing oneself from elders and finding one's way (however hesitantly and hetero-normally) in the world of adult romance and love (although I should probably add that some early and more recent critics have claimed that Tchaikovsky intended simply to make a direct contrast between the serious, brooding world of Iolanta and the childish divertissement of Nutcracker).  If you are willing to make allowances for the rather wooden production, this DVD of the opera stands as a powerful and haunting work--and can easily be supplemented musically by Gergiev's compelling recording.",1271462400,20,1785,5.2020905923344944
5161524,4,B008H2IIWU,"This 1982 Bolshoi production is as old-fashioned as it gets: elaborate sets & costumes; declamatory, wooden ""acting""; crude makeup & wigs. But all that makes it easier not to take seriously the soppy story of a blind princess who finally sees the light & finds true love.

Tchaikovsky's score for this, his last opera, is often pedestrian & only occasionally up to his usual standard, but the few good tunes are worth hearing. What earns this DVD a ""4"" from me is the very high quality singing of all the principals.  All in all, quite enjoyable.",1271203200,13,546,4.677083333333333
8527889,5,B008H2IIWU,"Iolanta is a shamefully neglected short opera by Tchaikovsky and it is given a beautiful, minimalist staging here with wonderfully sensitive interpretations by a cast largely unknown to me",1436313600,,188,5.517241379310345
8527890,1,B008H2IIWU,"Completely awful. The ""Persephone"" is especially bad. Don't waste your money on this mess.",1428969600,,90,5.5
8527891,4,B008H2IIWU,"Let me say at once that my mere four stars does not in any way reflect on the quality of disc, performances, or production, all of which seemed to me very good indeed. It is simply that, while I enjoyed these two operas, I did not absolutely fall in love with them, nor do I feel very likely to watch them often. This will probably not be -- for me -- one of the gems of my collection; but this is a personal taste, and other opera fans may well be absolutely delighted.",1428364800,,470,4.064516129032258
8527892,5,B008H2IIWU,"Iolanta is a lovely, moving Tchaikowsky one-acter.  This quite conventional staging seems to me more successful than the Met production.  Galina Kalinina is a moving, lyrical Iolanta (she was the first Natasha I heard in Prokofiev's War and Peace), but all the roles are well sung.  The father's grieving aria is deeply moving, and the lovers' duet, which can seem a bit rhetorical, sounds natural and ecstatic.  Everything is in the right vein--the Russians know how to honor their most beloved composer.",1427241600,,505,5.121951219512195
8527893,4,B008H2IIWU,"I don't have a lot to say about this.  But I do have objections to the lack of props in the Tchaikovsky.  (Not much interested in the Stravinsky)  There is, I would think, a pivotal scene where Vaudemont asks Iolanta to pluck him a Red rose to symbolize their meeting and she gives him a White one.  She repeats the same mistake again, then cannot even say how many roses Vaudemont has in his hands without touching them.  It's laughable to see this played out without any roses.  It's like drinking fake tea at your daughter's fake tea party with her unicorn friends. This and the conclusion that without any props, all the singers can do is paw each other makes viewing a little difficult.  However, I love the music and appreciate a running narration of what the characters are saying, so I am happy to have the recording.  I've heard at least one cut but it didn't seem to hurt that much.",1426636800,,892,4.429447852760736
8527894,5,B008H2IIWU,"Wonderful production and interesting opera, not done very often where I live.",1425340800,,77,5.5
8527895,5,B008H2IIWU,"This opera is a wonderful delight to watch.
Unfortunately, the recent premier at the MET was a disappointing production, compared with this DVD.
As another reviewer stated.....this is opera the way it was meant to be seen.",1424476800,,222,5.027027027027027
8527896,5,B008H2IIWU,"Not too many people have heard of Stephan Mallarms concept of a total work: a piece that unites all of the arts in one complete performance.  Peter Sellars has just achieved it with his production of these two operas.  He has done the seemingly impossible: strip ""Iolanta"" of its fairy tale ""Russianness"" and  turn it into an ageless, serene, mystical work of art.  The same must be said of ""Persephone"": poetry by Andre Gide, flawlessly spoken by Dominique Blanc, impeccably sung by Paul Groves and the chorus of the Teatro Real de Madrid, with a minimalist setting that invokes both painterly abstraction  and Zen architecture, and danced by Cambodian Royal Dancers.  What a joy to have an literate opera producer like him.  The vocals?  As good or better than you can get elsewhere (wait for the Met's production of Iolanta with Ms. Nebretko).  This is opera as sacred choral music.  One for the ages..",1411084800,4,905,4.818181818181818
8527897,5,B008H2IIWU,"Iolanta is the most consistently beautiful of Tchaikovsky's operas.  Even the recitatives are lyrical. Galina Kalinina is touching  as the blind princess.  The beauty of her voice and face and the grace of her movements makes Count Vaudemont's infatuation credible.  Lev Kuznetzov's soaring tenor voice is a match for Kalinina's lyric soprano.  The rest of the cast is good but a little overshadowed the two lovers.  The plot  departs from the violent staples of opera by portraying normal (but fabulously wealthy) people confronting a problem like normal  people. Ibn Hakia's medical skills are not magical: they are what one would expect from a pupil of Rhazes (Ibn Zakariya Ar-Razi).
The full stage shots are fuzzy, but the face shots are sharp.  I found the quality of the sound recording satisfactory.  I expect that this little gem (1 1/2 hours) will be replayed often in my house.  I have seen the earlier Bolshoi movie: it is visually superior, but the lovers are not quite up to the vocal standard of Kalinina and Kuznetzov.",1405382400,9,1033,4.9476744186046515
8527898,5,B008H2IIWU,"I did not expect to be so deeply moved by this lesser known Tchaikovsky opera. Iolanta may not be performed much these days but it has striking attributes: a powerful, melancholy mood, gripping characters and a concentrated story that consistently holds one's interest. And if it is not quite as consistently inspired melodically as Eugene Onegin or Queen of Spades, Tchaikovsky can still be most persuasive here, successfully tugging at the emotional heart meter. Iolanta was Tchaikovsky's last opera, premiering in 1892 on a double bill with the Nutcracker (quite the long program!), and it is not hard to see how the joie de vivre of the ballet would win over more audience than the intimate, somber opera. Yet when performed as convincingly as it is here, Iolanta casts a strong poetic spell that leaves a powerful, lasting impression. At 1 hour and 45 minutes, it is quite substantial, no mere trifle length-wise. It more than holds its own on the opera stage.

The one-act work is centered around the blind Iolanta, daughter of King Rene in 15th century Provence, who doesn't know she differs from anyone else. The story is strong and dark, and I won't spoil the ending, but it is terribly moving. Tchaikovsky rises to the occasion with much music that is eloquent. It's hard to know where to start with the successes of this 2012 Madrid production. The singing is universally fine, with a largely youthful Russian cast offering clear and pure vocalism, with especially strong enunciation. Iolanta is eloquently portrayed by a silver-voiced Ekaterina Scherbachenko, evoking a radiant presence. Veteran Willard White not only looks the part of the Moorish physician Ibn Hakia, but also sings powerfully and evocatively, although not as clearly as the Russian cast. The most beautiful and impressive voice belongs to baritone Alexej Markov, who has a burnished, beautifully-produced tone and strong dramatic ideas as Robert, Iolanta's promised suitor. Markov reminds me of the young Sergei Leiferkus; I'd love to hear him as Onegin, a specialty of Leiferkus years ago.

Masterfully supporting and greatly enriching this moving work is the superb conducting of Teodor Currentzis, also dramatically insightful in Verdi's Macbeth on video. He totally has the measure of Iolanta, offering strong dramatic contrasts and consistently realizing the emotional undercurrents of the work. Currentzis elicits first-rate, idiomatic playing from the Madrid players.

Both stage and video direction are by long-time John Adams collaborator Peter Sellars, who puts a distinctive mark on the proceedings. He stresses close-up shots of the protagonists, which in such a personal and moving piece fits the action well. The costumes are modern and plain. His staging is modest - open door frames with symbolic objects (rocks?) on their tops - and it works convincingly. People enter and leave a scene but their emotional presence is never far behind. Most striking is Sellars' daring, dynamic lighting; the contrast is extreme and powerful. It seems often a very bright hand-held light is used quite close to the characters, which might have been disconcerting in the theater, but is largely unobtrusive or unseen on screen. The contrasts of strong and varied levels of light and ample use of shade are most moving - ironic in a story focused on a blind person.

Several elements stand out musically and dramatically; a distinctive on-stage string quartet toward the beginning, the touching love duet between the two leads, the strongly etched duet between Markov and his Burgundian couterpart Vaudemont (movingly sung by Pavel Cernoch) and the beautiful final hymn. The end scene is visually highly striking: the entire cast is in black, except for Iolanta awash in royal blue, standing out most dramatically from the others. A notable end to a notable opera. It brings numerous gulps to the throat.

Stravinsky's Persephone, at just under an hour, fills out the disc. Unusually, it has the same stark set as Iolanta, which seems to work well in this intimate Greek legend. The work features a striking Dominque Blanc in the spoken role of Persephone, a vocally off and on Paul Groves as the commentator Eumolpe (the only vocalist), a small, beautiful Cambodian dance troupe (with particularly eloquent hand movements) and a chorus. It is the soft side of Stravinsky, a complement to the Iolanta, and is a mildly agreeable pastiche, nothing more.",1376352000,12,4432,5.167130919220056
