8168194,5,B000MDH6RU,I bought this video for my nephews and they just absolutely love it!!  They were really into the story line and enjoyed all of the songs.  My one nephew watches it 3 or 4 times a day (he's 4 years old) and tries to sing along with the characters.  He even has made up his own dance!  This is a definite must have video that kids and parents can both enjoy.,1169510400,,356,3.971830985915493
