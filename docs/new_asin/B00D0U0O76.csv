5766209,1,B00D0U0O76,"The DVD has a problem. When you run it, it is impossible to reward or forward it. Once you stard watching, you have to finish the whole film because if you stop you have to start over from the beginning. You cannot search a precise scene. This is not the first time I experience this problem. I cannot say anything about the film. I just critiquing the quality of the DVD. And it has no english subtitles.
I just realized that I was sold the wrong DVD. The one sold by Amazon is supposed to be the USA version. I was sold the latin american version which does not have subtitles. Avoid buying from this seller: Dvd's Y Musica.",1430784000,4,626,4.26890756302521
