8678978,3,B00NLOKJXK,"This is a sentimental story (1930) of a woman (Helen Ware) who shares a Broadway house with a group of hoods. When her foster son (Douglas Firbanks Jr.) gets involved with a chorus girl (Billie Dove), Fairbanks gets convicted for a murder he did not commit. His God mother does everything possible to get him out of jail since the real killer is his girlfriend, Billie Dove. This is an old fashioned story even by 1930 standards. Billie Dove stands by his side out of guilt and deep love for him. Also cast in the film is Tully Marshall, James Crane, John Loder, and Claude Fleming. Forrest Halsey and Kathryn Scola wrote the screenplay, and the story was written by Frederick Brennan. Director John Dillons work is acceptable, and Fairbanks and Billie Dove did not produce any noteworthy sparks in their performance.",1465948800,,817,4.76056338028169
