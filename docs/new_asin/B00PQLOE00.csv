6819631,1,B00PQLOE00,I'm Susan SHANNON I'm deaf person from Australia. I'm not happy I watched this Blu Ray of  La Famille Bellier there's NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES !! Only French!! (I need Reg2/B for English Sublittles) Could pls tell me which one is DVD or Blu Ray for Australia? Thank you.,1461888000,,266,4.541666666666667
6819632,5,B00PQLOE00,"What a wonderful film - sweet, poignant, well-acted! Just beware that it won't play in US DVD players (at least I couldn't figure out how to make it work) and you'll have to set the computer for France to play - no English subtitles in this version, but you can turn on French subtitles to avoid missing the meaning when the dialogue gets fast.",1461110400,2,344,4.390625
6819633,5,B00PQLOE00,"Louaine Emera plays Paula - her mother, father and brother are all deaf and mute. Despite this they run a dairy farm making and selling their own cheese. Meanwhile at school a new guy turns up with dreamy Gallic good looks. He has ambitions to be a singer and so wants to join the school choir  Paula decides to do likewise. Their care worn teacher gets a welcomed surprise when he discovers that both of his new pupils can actually sing.

Mild plot spoiler later on here!!

Bolstered by their talent he decides that they may be able to audition in Paris for a top chance to join the best choir in the land  this would mean moving to Paris. The fly in the ointment for Paula is that as she can hear and speak  and as such she has become essential to the running of the entire family and her leaving is not at all welcomed. Throw into the mix a ton of teenage hormones, the politics of the local Mayor and some excellent songs by Michel Sardou and you have what is an excellent watch.

This is a film that for me took a while to hit its stride but once it did I was totally enthralled by it. Louaine Emera has the voice of an angel  the song at the end Je Vole by Sardou is a reworking of his classic letter to his parents and I was so taken with it that I downloaded it straight away. The acting, directing and just about everything else here is spot on. This is one of those films that reinforces, for me, why I love World cinema so much and also why French cinema has got a gloriously healthy future awaiting  cest formidable!",1458259200,4,1528,4.173469387755102
6819634,5,B00PQLOE00,"An excellent film that gives a good view into the lives of a Deaf family and a CODA.  There are parts that might be a bit brash or too ""real"" for American viewers, but this is certainly one of my favorite films now.",1455321600,,215,4.0
6819635,5,B00PQLOE00,"Surprisingly pleasant and good-heart-ed French musical comedy about growing up, first serious love, the hardships of being handicapped, and the life on farm.  The film revolves around a hearing-impaired family with a daughter who can hear.  She is a big help to the family, but she is also a very talented singer who dreams of more than just simple life on farm.  One day her voice gets discovered by her Parisian kooky music teacher...and from than on...

Highly recommended film for a Sunday afternoon :)",1454803200,2,506,4.91764705882353

8688983,5,B00PQLOE00,"ahhhhhhhh, c`est beau ca ..... oui oui, this surprised me very much indeed.

What a truely beautiful and entertaining small French film.
Both in a serious, honest manner AND with a light hand this film deals with the issue of mutism, which really is anything but easy to render filmwise.
How it is done, stirs nothing but my admiration. Why?:

1. It is largely refusing to use clichs and shows the family in their everyday life quite wonderfully real and three-dimensional.
2. there is no danger of any corny Kitsch-Alert.
3. musical entertainment - both pure score and the songs performed - is really well done and not intrusive. Instead, you simply have to acknowledge the musical class of typical French chansons by Sardou and Co..
4. Finally, my personal highlight:
Insanely-authentic and sensitively the young actress/""singer"" Louane Emera plays her role as a teen with so much heart and even more responsibility:
As she passes through all the nuances of her difficult role of self-obliged responsibility as a ""licensed famliy-translation-service"" in part-time via sign language on to her scenes about first love/adolescence/small rebellions and finally to her vocal passion, is simply superb!
Yes, I am truely more than impressed by her wonderful ""Paula"". It is difficult for me to imagine a better actress for her role. Very very huge compliment to Mademoiselle Emera !!! In her fabulously unexcited manner of acting she reminds me of a young Scarlett Johannsson, who often also features her characters with great understatement and exudes more radiance and depth than ""louder"" actresses who do overact.

There might be some aspects to criticize. For instance the extreme acting of mother Karin Viard might appear exaggerated and way overacted. But perhaps she simply plays an overly solicitous mute mother, I'm not sure. Yet these possible shortcomings are but as marginal compared with all the undeniable qualities.
One of the most obvious is, that I feel directly how much passion and commitment is delivered by everyone involved in the film on and of screen.
PLUS: There is a delicious balance between drama as well as humour in the film. Such honest films, they are unfortunately far too rare.

I will therefore gladly help to promote these Bliers. The great Amazon reviews of this film are just well-deserved!
I recommend this never ever (!!!) mawkish movie to absolutely anyone who is interested in relationships of people and their communication - hence 85% and smooth 5 stars! (I've seen it in French with subtitles.)
