8152608,3,B000JNRPNI,"This is an odd film in the career of Pete Walker. He started out doing crime and sex comedies but this film is right before his move into a full time and genius horror film director. It combines all sorts of random elements from his early career like random UK ""glamour"" girls that he met during his stand up acts in various comedy clubs, clear shoe string production values, a protagonist that you can't quite warm up too (there's rarely a Pete Walker protagonist male or female that is classically nice making him Pre-Almodovar), and a quick run time to make sure he doesn't wear out your good graces. From this stand point the movie is pretty interesting.

However, it's also not particularly funny. It's sort of awkward too. Anouska Hempel is a good Pete Walker lead in the movie. She's very self centered and casually callous. She just isn't particularly watchable. She's good looking and is mildly allergic to clothes but even that isn't enough to get past the fact she's much too good a Pete Walker lead. It's similar to the raging jerk found in The Big Switch his first film. His leads are supposed to be despicable but watchable none the less. Hempel is watchable...but not for long. For a movie that is something like Barbarella in present day, she should at least be endearingly ditzy but Hempel the whole way through is manipulative and clearly too smart for all that. It's acting...you can act it not be it. I don't think Christopher Walken in real life will kill me.

I can't comment on picture quality as it was on a VHS and clearly the VHS didn't come from a great source but there's lot of interesting Pete Walker moments. You can tell a Pete Walker movie in the same way you can tell a Woody Allen or Abel Ferrara movie. They look distinctly like their own. Walker here is clearly working quick on a sex/spy comedy to put on a double bill but his signature style is still here and it's one I like. It's very subtle and not particularly flashy but builds similar to Otto Preminger when he made Laura (this however is no Laura).

Interestingly, Anouska Hempel is now married to a Lord (those birthright things that still exist in the world outside of Canada and the USA unless you're named Kennedy, Bush, Gore, McCain, Kerry or Clinton) and has done everything she can to keep this movie out of circulation. I can't fathom why. It's not the best and it's not the worst. If anything, she can point out that in the 70s she looked pretty good. It's somewhat funny because her film Black Snake with Russ Meyer is rather readily available and it makes Django Unchained seem rather tame. I don't know the reasoning but you may get a kick out of thumb your nose at the British government.",1419379200,,2697,4.5338809034907595
