8211439,5,B0002VT1S4,This is a great show. This was when this type of air craft was new. and It hadn't been seen as much as today. It is a thing of beauty. This was at that time thought impossible for helicopters to do.,1389916800,,198,3.8536585365853657
8211440,5,B0002VT1S4,"THE best action TV show ever made. The theme song alone is excellent! Go on YouTube and see the reviews there. This is THE show people will still be talking about years from now. If you like military action with high-tech weapons, THIS IS IT! NOTHING else comes close(Knight Rider was cheesy; Blue Thunder was overrated; Streethawk was dumb). Airwolf will never be topped!",1277078400,6,372,4.828125
