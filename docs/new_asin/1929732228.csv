Anyhoo....mr. music is so deep and emotional and i cried at the credits (i love that font sooooo much)....so um i'm so choked up (choking on a luna bar, not a cookie) that i can't find the words to explain how i feel about this movie....so yeah.....watch it, now, over and over and over and over and over and over",1012953600,,443,4.402439024390244
