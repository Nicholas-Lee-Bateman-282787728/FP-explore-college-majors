5119299,4,B008220BGQ,"I just got back from a sneak preview of this movie, and thought it was a lot of fun, particularly with an election season in full bloom.

If you've seen the commercial, you know what it's about.... Will Farrell as the slick incumbent being unexpectedly challenged by Zach Galifianakis as the awkward newcomer candidate.

What follows is a funny, frequently shocking, sometimes unexpected series of sight gags and improvisations crammed full of light hearted humor.  And some of the flat out funniest political commercials created.

Some of the jokes fell a little flat, and some were a bit more gross than I wanted, but all told, it was a fun way to spend the evening, and was as funny as I expect from Will, Zach, and a surprisingly star studded supporting cast.  And a maid that steals the show.

Go see it if you've ever disliked politics or a politician.

Or if you want some good laughs.",1344211200,11,892,4.643312101910828

This movie - The Campaign, directed by Jay Roach, whose filmography includes some excellent comedies (the Austin Powers trilogy, Meet the Fockers) does a decent job. Can the movie do a good job of portraying the pressures and vices from a presidential campaign from a mock-serious humorous and (more or less) impartial point of view. I don't think the movie did a great job at it, but I can't deny I found the film entertaining nevertheless.

I think there's an excellent political satire hidden in some places of The Campaign. The movie pits two comedic powerhouses in Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis against one another in a political satire. Ferrell is a congressman who has won his seat uncontested for years until the large corporations bring in Galifianakis to replace him and to do their bidding. Zach plays a mild-mannered guy - Marty Huggins, a tourism enthusiast with ideas of bettering his hometown. When Huggins announces his candidacy, the stunned Brady quickly introduces him to the sinister world of politics. The movie is rife with copious smear campaigns, name tarnishing and disgraceful mechanisms employed to destroy each other's reputations. The setup is the entire movie. Beyond the setup, the entire movie is highly predictable.

The general premise of a politically inept fellow who is transformed into a charismatic candidate manipulated by the economical elite is very interesting. However, the screenplay is diluted by the coarse and vulgar humor employed throughout the film. For every scene that worked, there were five or six which only provoke groans because the actors and the directors were trying too hard. The humour always works better when the actors take their roles seriously and let the comedy naturally flow from their attitudes and reactions. When they try to force the laughs, they lose spontaneity and destroy the reality of the characters in order to transform them into caricatures.

All in all, the Campaign works as an entertaining comedy, despite not being very memorable.",1473033600,,2201,5.125348189415042

There are times during this movie where I was laughing so hard I had to stop it before I missed something.

The funniest part (or saddest part) about it is how much it feels like you are watching a real campaign between two politicians. They lie, cheat, manipulate their answers to match polling data, nothing is authentic, everything is staged. It's like watching an actual election in the US!

It's about a seasoned politician going up against an everyman who just wants to do an honest job. The normal guy quickly learns how to be cut throat. The voters are the real losers in it all. Again...it's exactly like US politics.

And without spoiling the end, I will promise you it pays off and is a great way to end this story.",1440720000,,742,4.514925373134329

5119983,4,B008220BGQ,"It's not Old School or Anchorman, but this is solidly in the upper-middle tier of Will Ferrell's cinematic output. In the words of Andy Samberg as Nicolas Cage, this has all of the classic features of a high-quality Will Ferrell film. That is, Ferrell playing a character who is completely clueless, has a heart of gold somewhere deep down there, but can't help but be continually led astray by his massive ego and his carnal desires. By re-situating classic Ferrell elements in the character of a John Edwards-esque southern politician, it stays fresh. The physical comedy and ridiculous improvised riffing are in full effect, showing some of that familiar sparkle that made Old School and Anchorman (and, to a lesser extent, Ricky Bobby and Blades of Glory) so magical. Also, did I mention that we've got Zach G essentially doing a much more likable version of the ""Seth Galifianakis"" alter ego from his Purple Onion stand-up special, and that alone is worth the price of admission. Finally, there's a solid supporting cast.

5120029,1,B008220BGQ,"Badly wasted opportunity with Will Ferrell as a Democratic incumbent congressman whose secure seat is thrown up for grabs after he leaves a raunchy answering machine message at the wrong phone number.  Two billionaires who are a barely disguised version of the Koch brothers (John Lithgow  and Dan Akroyd) decide to finance a goofy nobody they can control (Zack Glifrankis) as a Republican challenger.

The Campaign is way too broad and silly to function as a political satire--the only scenes that even come close are those with Lithgow and Akroyd who should be given their own movie.  Will Ferrell is just doing another variation on his blustery, oblivious idiot character from Anchorman and Taladega Nights--much of what he does during the course of the film would instantly end a political career (Punching a baby? Making a hidden camera sex tape with his opponent's wife and using it as a campaign commercial?) yet The Campaign improbably allows him to remain a viable political candidate throughout.  But if Will Ferell is never a believable politician he at least is occasionally funny--Zack Galifrankis seems to be playing a sketch character rather than a plausible human being and his grating, unfunny schtick gets old extremely fast.

Political satire requires some actual political perspective, something that is entirely missing in The Campaign.  Will Ferrell may be identified as a Democrat and Zack Galinfrankis a Republican but neither expresses any actual beliefs associated with their respective parties--even if neither of them believes in anything they would at least need to pretend to while running for office.  The Campaign is such a soft-headed muddle it makes the sappy Kevin Costner film Swing Vote look like sharp satire in comparison.  Warren Beatty's underrated Bulworth is really looking like a masterpiece at this point.",1431820800,,1850,5.244067796610169

Wasn't like these two guys didn't work well together I think Marty Huggins was the better of the two as he took it more serious. I think they do pretty good together but the movie storyline lacks big time and whomever wrote this had a fine idea and maybe worth the time? but this movie doesn't deliver with that genuine Will Ferrell behind it that passion isn't there. Land of the Lost flopped at the Box Office and I consider it the best Will Ferrell movie out there. You had genuine passion driven Will Ferrell in Land of he lost, Step Brothers, Talladega nights, The other guys, Hell even Everything must go wasn't to bad compared to this one. I would say this is one of Will's worst and the movie doesn't have re-watch value or enjoyment. I would pass on this one and pick up another flick if you want top notch Will Ferrell.

Will's character was brought up in the upper-class and ruled as such.  Zach was middle-class and saw things differently.

Despite having a few good moments, the film fails to generate enough laughs to keep it entertaining for even the films short 85 minute run time. There was a lot of potential here, but the end result is a somewhat dull and half-assed effort for a comedy. There were a few good moments in the film and I did enjoy the message the film had to it (as obvious as it was). Still, this is probably Will Ferrell's weakest film since Semi-Pro.

Basically, Ferrell is George W. Bush throughout the film and Galifianakas is a flamboyantly gay man.  After a while it gets nauseating.  You just want them to give it up.  Like watching those unfunny souls who try out for talent shows, you cringe and cannot wait for them to get off the stage.  The movie is like a boring SNL skit taken to the extreme.  How this got made into a movie, I cannot guess.

If you are a hardcore Ferrell or Gaifianakis fan, you might want to see this.  It MAY amuse you.  Don't expect belly laughs.

5120302,3,B008220BGQ,"Another tick in the long line of silly, themed Will Ferrell vehicles, this doesn't quite reach the heights of Anchorman, Talladega Nights or Old School, but fits comfortably on the second tier alongside Step Brothers and Blades of Glory. It's a steady rotation of softballs for Ferrell and co-star Zach Galifianakis, who tackle a political atmosphere ripe for satire with all the nuance of a six-foot dildo draped in the American flag. For what it's worth, most of the gags seem more heavily scripted than I'd expect from these two, so the few scenes that do allow some room for improvisation are, as expected, the best in the film. The comedians' giant personalities mesh nicely as the picture rolls on, but their relationship doesn't revolve around the kind of relentless give-and-take typified by the similar dual leads in Step Brothers. Ferrell's all-in as the scumbag lifetime politician, sleazy in ways that haven't even been defined in the English language, but Galifianakis is actually worth rooting for as his soft-spoken upstart challenger. Of course, it wouldn't have legs if he didn't get his hands dirty at some point, and his gentle nature makes it all the more rewarding when he finally gives in to his baser instincts and fires back in kind. Funny and thin, but you probably already knew that.",1392595200,,1309,4.954545454545454

In this movie it's not that it isn't funny there are some pretty good laughs in it but it's not a riot fest or anything. If you like them you'll probably like it. I liked it but I usually don't get my hopes up too high for comedies these days and I find that often waiting for the blu-ray release is the safe bet. Usually due to the ""extended cut"" or ""unrated cut"" is available. Too often the theatrical release of comedies are pg-13 which makes sense from a money making standpoint. Teens have more disposable income than their parents simple as that.
 Overall the picture quality is good not reference material but it has a nice solid picture with some slightly soft focus in some scenes but overall a nice transfer. The audio is well it's a comedy so it's not reference material either but it has a nice though slightly front stage heavy soundtrack. Surrounds are mainly for the score etc.

This isn't a film, it's a documentary.  If you see anything in this movie that hasn't in some way happened in real-life politics at one point or another, please raise your hand.  Anyway, film or documentary or whatever, this is still worth watching.  Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis come together as a seasoned political veteran looking to keep his job and a somewhat simplistic newcomer to the world of campaigns and vote-getting.  Katherine LaNasa plays Mr. Ferrell's equally political and self-absorbed wife (anyone flashing back to Leslie Bib in Taladegia Knights right now?) and John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd perfectly play wealthy brothers who are constantly scheming, even against each other.  Complimenting the stars is a host of supporting characters, including real-life individuals such as CNN reporters Wolf Blitzer and Piers Morgan and political talk show host and comedian Bill Maher.  If you wanna get some laughs while maybe learning a thing or two about today's politics in America, this is the DVD to get.

Maybe my expectations were too high, but whatever, this movie was not funny. I chuckled maybe once through the entire thing. I also don't know why I assumed from the commercial ads that this was a family-like comedy. It was extremely vulgar and explicit, but I wouldn't have minded that if it had been funny! The funniest part was when the baby was punched and that was one of the things from the commercial they used to hook people into watching this.

It's sad that with Will Ferrell's comedic genius, and the chance to make fun of the political system, that the filmmakers couldn't do better than this. What a huge waste. This movie is not humorous, just based on lame silliness and a bunch of dumb characterization. Even Saturday Night Life is funnier than this and it hasn't been funny since 1993.

That one word certainly describes the basis of the movie;Coupled with half-truths and quick 1-liners, it's worth watching.

That said, as a motion picture, it was rather bland and tasteless throughout much of the movie. I've rated this film as such due to its idiosyncrasies, all-star cast and occasional snappy joke.

Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis poke fun of modern day politics and scandals by exaggerating them then going to extremes. The story is a  great reminder of how modern average everyday people can rise to conflicting circumstances and overcome adversity standing in their way as the good nature and morals shine through to defeat the wrong doings in politics. While making you laugh the whole time.",1370649600,,476,4.8765432098765435
5120433,3,B008220BGQ,"I absolutely hate Will Ferrell, but I love Zach Galifianakis, even still, the Campaign is not usually the type of movie I would watch, so why did I? What put this film over the top and on to my radar, was it's Director, Jay Roach. He may not have name recognition, but when the man who Directed the Austin Powers and Meet The Parents trilogies releases a new comedy, I for one take notice. The Campaign is also different from most Ferrell movies, being that it has a storyline, and he is a co-star, lessening the chances of him running off on some insane hallucination. Ferrell plays four term Congressman, Cam Brady, a wildly popular brown nose, who is hated by the opposing party. He's about to get a fifth term, unopposed, when a group of millionaires decide to fiance a campaign against him, featuring the son of a legend in Washington. There's one problem though, this man's son, is a complete idiot. As the campaign rages it's the veteran politician against his haters money and both sides will go to any and all lengths to win. This movie was a million times better than I thought it would be and absolutely hysterical. The writers take the idea of a dirty campaign and bring it to the extreme, with some things that have to be seen to be believed. Zach Galifianakis doesn't disappoint, giving us perhaps his best character since Alan in the Hangover, and to give credit where credit is due, yes, Will Ferrell matched him line for line, in what was the only thing I've liked him in since Elf. The film is further supported by some comedic legends in bit parts, making it a terrific, well-rounded comedy, that uses multiple styles to achieve it's goal of having the audience in hysterics.",1370563200,,1694,4.5756578947368425

I've watched it several times and laugh my butt off each time.  For those of you who appreciate great one liners along with good sight humor this flick does it. Granted I have a weird sense of humor but I feel this will become a cult classic with the stoners.  I also love Howard Stern and Jay Thomas so go from there.,1370390400,,484,4.03125

It's an incredibly silly comedy, not a smart comedy, you don't have to be thinker, there is no reading between the lines. We were actually pleasantly surprised. I don't generally like Zach G. I don't like any of the movies he did, but by far, his character was one of the funniest characters ever in this. I absolutely loved him. The next day my husband and i rewound to the early part of the movie when he's talking to his dad in the boat. The dialogue was brilliant. This was not my favorite Will F. role, a bit more vulgar for our taste, but all in all, a fun saturday night, pizza, beer kinda movie...i guess we were not expecting much and that is what made it funny.

2. It has Zack Galifianakis in it ... I like him a lot, although he seems to sign up for anything tossed at him without reading it first. He plays a dumb, almost faggy southern boy who runs against Ferrell's incumbent character.

5120485,4,B008220BGQ,"Poking fun at the activities, habits and behaviors of those fine men and women who form the Congress of the United States of America is a time-honored American pastime. Turning over this rock and exposing the crawling life forms below is almost guaranteed to get laughs. Congressional politicians are pompous, self-serving, duplicitous, and always running for election. The Campaign takes advantage of the easy heehaws these 435 useless, ineffective folks provide on a daily basis. They are the low-hanging fruit on the comedy tree only inches above potty jokes. Will Farrell and Zach Galifianakis harvest an almost non-stop, belly-full of laughs for at least 70 out of the 85 minutes. Farrell's character Cam Brady is married to his hairdo and obsessively self-assured as he embarks on another Congressional campaign. Running unopposed, he has tossed caution to the wind. He sees himself as invincible. But on the last filing day, Galifinakis' character Marty Huggins enters the race. He's sponsored by a couple of rich moguls who now view their ""boy"" Cam Brady as a liability -- time to install a new stooge politician.

What follows is a rollicking campaign filled with outrageous accusations, unequivocal denials, repentant sinners and vicious winners. The movie is rich in sight gags and wisecracks. But for all these rapid-fire rim shots to generate humor, Cam Brady and Marty Huggins need a straight man -- a Bud Abbott, Dean Martin, Ed McMahon type -- the set-up guy -- the commentator -- the yang. That role in the movie is fulfilled by the same people who do it in ""real life"" -- the television news personalities: Wolf Blitzer, Chris Matthews, Dennis Miller, Piers Morgan, Bill Maher and others provide the context for the jokes. The result is a naturally funny and unpretentious political movie.

Unfortunately, the joke is on those American citizens who participate in this mockery every two years. Italy may have its Beppe Grillo, a comic-turned-politician, but we are saddled with a hundreds of humorless, narcissistic, inept politicians who are archetypical buffoons. Maybe this is why this country's legislation is driven by self-serving executive orders and expedient legal decisions instead of reasoned legislation. Of the three government branches, only the fruit on the lowest branch evokes bawdy laughter. The fruit on the higher branches whether colored red, blue or purple is heavy, distasteful and bitter. We can have a good laugh at the lowlife congressmen for we realize they are only political eunuchs lacking the balls to make a difference.",1366761600,,2984,5.428879310344827

Will Ferrell, who i think it incredible talented when put on a leash like Jim Carey) went crazy and make me laugh several times.

I was pleasantly surprised.",1361836800,,375,4.314285714285714

5120742,2,B008220BGQ,"I thought I would wile away the evening with Will and Zach - have a few chuckles - laugh at the shabby state of American politics. Will's ""You're Welcome, America"" is much better political satire than this. This seems like a series of lame jokes strung together for an hour and twenty-six minutes. Jason Sudeikis and Dylan McDermott do some strong work in this but Aykroyd and Lithgow are caricatures not real people that we should really inform ourselves about. I am a liberal Democrat. This is a lame SNL one-joke skit that doesn't end mercifully after 5-7 grueling minutes but drags on and on belaboring the message that the American public is stupid, easily manipulated and big business is laughing (and profiting) from our folly. Spend an hour and a half working to overturn Citizens United. Not watching this.",1360281600,,815,4.828571428571428

How about your co-worker sleeping with your wife or girlfriend when you get the promotion and he didn't.  I don't see any humor in that at all.

5120951,3,B008220BGQ,"Satire and outright comedy can be a mirror for the world to see its faults in a humorous way. They can bare the ugliness of a situation for all to see and yet not be ugly itself. They can make you think, make you laugh, give you a clearer understanding of the world around you, or be just plain wacky fun. This movie does none of that.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. Kind of. It has its moments, but they are few and far between. It's just that it is so utterly forgettable. It's not awful enough to make me laugh at how bad it is and it's not good enough to make much of an impact. It sought to lampoon the corruption and baleful nature of the modern American campaigning process but instead made the characters so over the top that they never seem plausible even in their own world. Example: A congressman gets caught having an affair in a porta-john in the middle of the day, gets caught making filthy phone calls to his mistress, and PUNCHES A BABY and he still has a chance of winning because he claims his opponent has facial hair like Saddam Hussein? I found myself thinking, ""no one would ever take these idiots seriously"" and ""are every one of their constituents mentally retarded?"". I was never quite able to believe the characters really meant to act the way they did and so couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept the world the movie took place in.

Two things intrigued me and they had little to do with the movie. One, during a scene in which the underdog's campaign manager is trying to teach him how to be manlier, you can see Burt Reynolds guest starring in what appears to be an episode of ""The Commish"". I really want to watch that episode now. Two, did Dan Aykroyd realize the irony of he and John Lithgow playing the exact same types of characters as the bad guys from his 80s hit ""Trading Places""?

For a better take on this kind of subject matter, two movies worth watching are ""Wag the Dog and ""Man of the Year"". The first was well ahead of its time as it was made in the late 90s but seemed to point a finger at the administrative foibles of the early 2000s and the second is a fun and interesting look at what would happen if someone like John Stewart were to take his fan's advice and run for office. Both of these movies have wit, great scripts, and wonderful performances and are far more worthy of your precious time than ""The Campaign"".",1358467200,,2378,4.327354260089686

The idea of a loud obnoxious villain vs. a good and loveable rube could have worked, only that's not how this script was written. It was more like unfunny a-hole vs. another unfunny a-hole. I didn't want to cheer for either charater, and their families were equally off-putting. The jokes about religion, adultary and 9/11 were just moronic. I feel dumber for listening to a Chinese woman act like a black slave.

I wouldn't waist your time. There were some funny parts, but none of them made up for the lack of thought put into this movie.

The problem with The Campaign rests in the execution and the picture as a whole. Most of the jokes are surface level funny, they might deserve a chuckle but more often, an eye roll. I think my main problem with it is an issue of restraint. Sometimes the leads are restraining too much, they were holding something back in the moments that needed over-the-top performances. In other scenes they went too big, where smaller character moments were needed.

5121333,5,B008220BGQ,"One of my favorite lines in this movie.

Just watched this movie last night, and while it took a little bit of time to get going, it was pretty good, and I was not disappointed. I watched this movie with my mother, and to be honest, the first 30 minutes were a little crude and profane for her. It also seemed a little unnecessary and a way to get some cheap laughs. After that though, I think she really liked it. She and I have been fans of Will Ferrell's 2000s works, and this was on par with some of the better ones.

Will Ferrell portrays a typical character that he is cast as, I'd say most comparable to the role of Ron Burgundy in Anchorman. Ferrell, as usual, plays the role fantastically, and is still as funny when I was watching him back in my teens. I thought that, even if a bit crude and profane, his performs was on par with early roles.

Zach Galifianakis was certainly a great pick for Will's counterpart. The only one I think who may have filled it better in my eyes would have been Steve Carrell. I think Zach played this character wonderfully, and it seemed right up his alley. The awkwardness he presented was appropriately funny, and it was a good contrast to the humor by Ferrell's character. I've always liked Zach, just because he always plays eccentric characters, and does it a little too well.

Overall, despite the beginning, I thought this film was pretty funny, and overall, satisfying. There were certainly crude and profane moments down the stretch, but they eventually toned that down a bit, and the rest of the laughs were certainly more memorable. In addition, I thought that this movie had a pretty good ending, and was a little deeper than I expected.

I think this is probably Ferrell's best film in the past few years, although the Other Guys is up there too, and I can only hope his next role, Anchorman 2, is his best work yet!",1357084800,,1870,4.440233236151603

5121423,4,B008220BGQ,"Some parts of this film had my husband and I laughing so hard we could barely breathe! We laughed at the parallels of modern politics; which in a way is quite sad. Dylan McDermott does a fantastic job portraying a smarmy political image consultant. I'm not sure that his character has an official job title, but Smarmy Image Consultant works for me. Zack's character is endearing & very likable mostly due to his naivete and spot-on moral compass. Will Farrell excellently portrayed a bumbling hedonistic ass-clown. I've never used that phrase before, but it's fitting for this description. The film was full of cheap shots and simple minded fun. It might seem like a silly ""leave-your-brain-at-home"" sort of film. That is until the viewer starts making connections between this comedy and the foundation of our political process.",1356739200,,830,5.065693430656935

As we have seen over and over there is no connection between the candidates campaign promises and their actual activity. It also demonstrates the Republican party struggle to find a decent human as their candidate. It is fine to watch it once.,1356652800,,376,4.8

5121430,1,B008220BGQ,"I'm not going to bother with explaining the movie; many others have already done so. I am going to try to explain the reason that I was shocked and offended by the fact that Will Ferrell agreed to star in this disaster of a movie.

Thinking that the election situation at the time would make this a great satire and/or commentary, this was a extremely disappointing film that was way off the mark. Call me a prude, call me an uptight conservative, but I would prefer to wear those monikers proudly than to even think of recommending this to anyone.

This is not a family-friendly movie, as was originally thought when it first came out. I wouldn't even call it worthy of being a PG-13. While the theatrics of politics is well-known for being gratuitous, this movie went beyond that by using high school mentality antics in using nudity and sexual language, swearing, and a scene in which Ferrell's character is shown having sex with his opponents wife, albeit from a modest angle.

If other Holly-weird celebrities starred in this debacle, it wouldn't have fazed me because the majority of stars have sold their souls for the price of fame. But I had hopes for Ferrell to stick to his ability to be funny without having to stoop to such a low level.

Ya, I miss John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Barbara Stanwyck and the other real stars of years ago. Will Ferrell is definitely not in this group.

If you are family-oriented and you place traditional values as ""musts"" in your life, do not waste your time or money on this.",1356652800,,1517,4.583025830258302

I can't say I was let down, however I still don't think the movie was as good as it could've been. The movie was hilarious i'm not doubting that, just fell a bit short for me, still worthy of 4 stars though. Zach Galifianakis really shines in the film, he plays the lovable character very well and Ferrel pulls off the corrupt politician. I don't really know how to pinpoint the one reason this one didn't fully do it for me though. I guess I just had too high of expectations, being big fans of both of these guys. Still, I don't regret seeing the film and if you're a fan of either one of these men you shouldn't be let down either.",1356393600,,733,4.205673758865248

5121565,5,B008220BGQ,"I almost didn't order this film after reading some of the reviews, but I did remember seeing a preview in the theatre and let's face it, Amazon had really lowered the price. Most of all, I took a leap of faith in Ferrell and Galifanakis.  I am glad I did.

It's not a stretch to call this a Blades of Glory for politics.  Ferrell is an over the top candidate parody and Galifanakis plays almost it almost straight with his parody as the challenger. To give it some gravitas, we have Dan Akroyd and John Lithgow as the superfunding Motch brothers, trying to buy the election.  The film even has cameos by Chris Matthews, Wolf Blitzer, Morning Joe's Joe and Mika, etc. Even Piers Morgan has a bit - how did they get all of these people?

There is lots of broad comedy here and lots of sight gags.  It is not sophisticated, but it is not meant to be.  However, a good deal of it is plain hilarious.  The scene of Will Ferrell's character trying to recite the Lord's Prayer at a campaign event with his campaign manager, Jason Sudekis, trying to prompt him by acting out the words is one of the funniest things I have seen on film in a very long time.

Probably the best thing I can say about this film is that I sure wish I could have been on-set while this was being made - everyone sure looks like they were having a good time!",1356393600,6,1326,4.23015873015873

Can't go wrong if you're looking for some laughs and to be reminded how sick our political system is.  Not as hoity-toity or annoying as something like Wag the Dog...it's nice to have a more humble, mainstream comedy every now and then.",1356134400,,454,4.6625

5121591,5,B008220BGQ,"I like the acting, the story and the direction.  One of my favorite Will Ferrell flicks.  I'd say this even if I wasn't in the supporting cast (1st 1/3rd of the film) ... Dylan McDermott plays a great bad guy and I like his return to comedy.  He played it well.

With all the Capitol Hill lunacy we face in our real life democracy, it was nice to daydream of an ending as that portrayed in 'The Campaign.'

I hope you like the film.

There are a couple of places where you will laugh so hard that you will cry.

There were a few moments, some would deem them crude while I find them hilarious, other than that I was very light humor that at times was a bit reaching for laughs.  Zack Galifianakis had his moments but after a while the effeminate accent was kinda of annoying (similar to the one from his Netflix special).  Aside from the few crude moments (and Dan Ackroyd) the funniest part-and saddest- is the realization of how true the movie probably is with respect to political commentary.",1355184000,,602,4.495412844036697

5121777,2,B008220BGQ,Decided to rent this movie since I thought it would be funny.  While parts of it were funny this movie was too raunchy for my liking.  I do not really like when they have young children swearing and saying nasty things.  Also I believe it would have been much funnier had they not had so much of the raunchiness.  Did laugh a few times but I won't remember this movie.,1355097600,,368,4.214285714285714

Yes friends, this was the least I've laughed while watching a movie since The Human Centipede 2. Will Ferrell stars, and it's hard to believe that this is the same man who starred in the family movie classic Elf. Now he's starring in this tirade of vulgarity. Then there's Zach Galifianakis. If they had the least sexy man in Hollywood contest, he'd win. Here, he plays the most mentally challenged character I've seen since Forrest Gump. It just angers me that this is what comedy has become. I remember when comedies were funny and made me just about wet my pants. Why can't they make comedies like Pootie Tang, Soul Plane, and Scary Movie 3 anymore. Have people just plain forgot how to make a comedy as funny as Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo. After seeing The Campaign, I'm afraid they have! Avoid this one like a really bad case of hemorrhoids!",1355097600,,1020,4.548913043478261

5121782,5,B008220BGQ,Omg this is such a funny movie! I loved it! It's an instant favorite for me. I don't know where they come up with this stuff. If you're a Will Ferrel fan you simply gotta see it. The southern accents and ridiculous politics are hilarious.,1355011200,,238,4.311111111111111
5121793,1,B008220BGQ,I just found the jokes weak and Galifianakis completely not funny.

I really enjoyed this movie it was a great laugh and had a good story. I mainly loved that it was classic Will Ferrel and Zach Galifiniakis. They portayed the characters perfectly and did a fantastic job complimenting each other with comedy.

of politics, elections, and money, money, money. So many scenes look just
like reality, you don't know whether to laugh out loud or hang your head in

borders on incredible to have a person's character undergo such a momentous

5121820,5,B008220BGQ,"This film was fun to watch all the way through. Will Ferrell plays an incumbent politician against the challenger Galifinakis (don't hold my spelling against me). Will Ferrell's character is the same as it always is in these movies, he's a mixture of Ron Burgundy and George W. Bush. Galifinakis' character is more of a departure. He's an innocent religious man thrown into the terrible world of politics. The film's plot is predictable, but it's not about the twists and turns, it's about the comedy. The film has a time limit however and should be enjoyed soon as the terrible trauma of recent elections wears off.",1354838400,,616,4.820754716981132

When you place limits on these dudes, you may not get the gut-destroying-laughter of the ""slo-mo-baby-punch."" These two actor/comedians are masters at subtlety. I would have liked more scenes like the ""ambush brunch"" and the ""office staff melt down.""",1354752000,,456,5.514285714285714

a interesting movie. I found it entertaining and different from the rest of the

Honestly, it takes a moment to build up steam, but as soon as it gets going there's no stopping it.  It does a great job of providing some crude, vulgar humor(which we all love) and blending it with a lot of spot on political commentary.  After the jab Ferrell and McKay had at Wall Street with The Other Guys, and now knocking politics down a peg or two, I find myself looking forward to whatever these to gents decide to caress together.  Overall, it was a fun entertaining movie, with a heartfelt, hopeful, albeit unrealistic ending.  If you love R rated comedies then give this one a try.",1354665600,,833,4.490066225165563

5121907,1,B008220BGQ,"I appreciate the commentary and caricature of American politics in this movie, but it must be faced with intelligence that there is a sort of movie that leaves the viewing audience a little dumber than they were.  Many it's because I'm 30, and this movie is made for 20.  I appreciate a younger viewing audience, but garbage in, garbage out.  This movie did make me see the masochism of the common American, who subconsciously enjoys being constantly lied to by powerful people who seem nice.  Where has all our morality gone.  I am feeling like America is politically diseased, and a very adolescent culture where huge money goes into lies (politically), and the dumbest entertainment (hollywood) in the world.  I think this movie is a brain cell killer, and dumbs the audience.  It is not a great comedy, even though there are some moments where I actually laughed.  I love the two main actors, but I have lost all trust for Gary Sanchez Productions.  I am tired of world that gets dumber everyday, so thank you Campaign for making me see the worst of it.

5121960,4,B008220BGQ,"Will Farrell and Zach Galifianakis do a great job in this off the wall poke at political campaigns. When Cam Brady (Will) and Marty Huggins (Zach) are steered by two brothers that have no interests in the state of South Carolina, only their own Chinese company, it gets messy.  All the usual political pitfalls are brought to play along with a few new concepts.  Kids to adults should get a few laughs, but I too agree they could have reduced the cursing a little as it didn't add any significant value to the experience, and it reduces the audience it will get.  The DVD/Prime release comes on the heels of the 2012 presidential campaign which made it all the more entertaining.  Most of us are glad to see all the mudslinging at an end, and this movie shows how it can all get out of hand.  I like how the movie ends on the realization that the one thing that really matters is how their family constituents were impacted and not the special interest of overseas company profit margins.

5121993,3,B008220BGQ,"The Campaign is a satire of American politics which follows Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) and Marty Huggins (Zach Galifinakis) as they battle for a seat in Congress; of course, some very raunchy, dirty politics are involved and some familiar characters and themes, as well (the Motch Brothers).

The movie was bit disappointing, considering I love some of Will and Zach previous work, like Step Brothers and The Hangover. It has some very funny moments, like the baby punching scene, the church/snake scene, a scene where Huggins' kids confess to some very raunchy deeds, and the political science major scene. However, instead of balancing its humor with a variety of jokes, it relies heavily on dirty jokes and excessive profanity from beginning to end. So, it has some hits and some misses. The ending was typical and predictable, but not bad. (there is a scar bit that I really enjoyed). The acting was great for what it was, as well.

Overall, it had some funny moments and was enjoyable; however, it's definitely not a movie for everyone, especially those who are easily offended or uninterested in politics. I recommend a rental before purchase.

The Campaign has some violence and blood, and 2 sex scenes without nudity. There is some very brief almost unnoticeable nudity for a few seconds during a scene, though.",1354060800,,1317,4.950226244343892

5121996,5,B008220BGQ,"I went into this movie expecting a decent, by-the-numbers Will Farrell vehicle by way of Ricky Bobby or the infinitely quotable Anchorman. I came out of the movie pleasantly surprised--Will Farrell is on top of his game in the role he plays in many of his movies: a self-absorbed idiot on top of the world. The formula works especially well in this movie, given the political undertones.

Zach Galifinakis was the biggest surprise: he plays Marty Huggins, a soft-spoken townie with a heart of cotton candy leading a content, if small life. The political rat race threatens to corrupt this life of his, and the titular campaign he runs against rival Cam Brady (Ferrell's character) is absolutely hilarious.

And yes, the scene in which Ferrell's character punches  a baby in slow motion is just as riotous as the trailers would lead you to believe. Don't miss this one.",1354060800,,868,4.851351351351352

That's just not the case.

I must say I thought the chemistry between these two were great!  The story might make one think about the ""behind the scenes"" of politics and just have a few laughs at a time when things are so rough for so many.

Nothing more than a truck load of sexual jokes and bad humor that involves punching a baby. Not funny in my book. I've liked Zach Galafianakis in his previous work and Will is generally funny but this movie just didn't work for me.

It represents new career low points for Will Ferrell, Zach Galifinakis & Jason Sudekis, who seem like they're in a contest to see who can make the audience wince the most with one mean-spirited, unfunny, dumb & dirty joke after another.

Relative to this election year's Obama v. Romney hullabaloo, it can be said that the story and the irony of the situations occurring all make sense and feel more intriguing to the smarter eye than Anchorman or Talladega Nights ever channeled through.

I thought the movie was unnecessarily crude and just wasn't funny.

Two rich businessmen (played by Dan Akroyd and John Lithgow) attempt to manipulate an election, putting up a silly local man(Galifinakis) against the incumbent who is plagued with problems (Ferrell).  Each eventually comes to the conclusion that they need to represent the district properly.

The antics of each are definitely amusing, but the movie feels way too short to me.  Usually when I see a film I expect more than 80 minutes these days.  If you enjoy politics and the crude humor of the two stars (plus the writing of Adam MacKay -- Ferrell's friend from the Funny or Die website), you will enjoy this movie.",1353715200,,702,4.768595041322314

Yes, it was crude in parts.  Political news is crude in real life.  Plus, this was classic Will Ferrell and crude was always a part of his style.  I laughed and laughed. We watched this the night before the Presidential election 2012 and it was perfect timing. We escaped the real political ads for the night and we were able to see that the parody was sometimes too close to the truth for comfort.

5122282,1,B008220BGQ,"This movie was a disappointment in every way. Will Ferrell needs to take a step back from these offensive and shameful films and re-evaluate a career that is spiralling into pathetic attempts at crude humor. Overall, the movie was far from entertaining. Instead, we found ourselves wincing at every possible joke, hoping it would not be the reason we would turn the movie off. The use of the F word is excessive to the point of being disturbing and honestly, I was embarrassed to be watching.

Zach Galifianakis was also not funny at all. I've never liked him but I like him even less now. His acting seemed unrehearsed and without any clue that he really wanted to even do this movie.

Without a doubt the most pathetic attempt at humor came at the expense of using the the Lord's prayer (aka the ""Our Father"") as humor with a disgusting play on words. Humor can be found in a lot of things but this prayer does not deserve to be delivered with such profanity in action and words. There are some things that you can't ""un-see"" in life. Take my word and avoid this movie because it's over-the-top profane and offensive.

5122320,2,B008220BGQ,"Slight spoiler alert...

Essentially, this movie depends on profanity for its humor.  While I am not a prude and an appropriately placed ""f-bomb"" can be funny when used with wit, that is this movie's downfall... there is no wit or subtlety.  I do like Will Ferrell and I think he can be funny, but this was a lazy piece of work by him and/or the screenwriters.  In fact, it may be the worst movie I have ever seen by Mr. Ferrell.

There are occassionally moments, like the trash talk before the first debate, that I did find funny but such moments are few and far between.  Frankly, I was bored because it was so ""over the top"" in the plot (such as the competing commericals of Will Ferrell's son calling Mr. Galifianakis ""dad"" and Will Ferrell sleeping with Mr. Galifianakis's wife in revenge) that I did not find it interesting.  There is also an accidental punching of a baby and then a dog.  Not that I am against punching babies or dogs for the sake of comedy, it was just another weak idea that was even more weakly executed.

Decent comedies from mainstream Hollywood are few enough.  This movie did nothing to alleviate the drought.  My recommendation is not to rent this movie, much less buy it.",1353542400,,1204,4.502304147465438

the secret service checks, waiting for hours outside in the heat and the blocked off parking.  What could

I was really excited to watch after seeing Will and Zach on several late night shows promoting the movie.  Unfortunately, the clips they previewed and the ones shown on the commercials were the best parts - if any scene could be called a best part - of this unfortunate movie.  Maybe I have just grown up and moved beyond the maturity level of Ferrell's humor because raunchy jokes and f-bombs just aren't funny to me.  At first I was afraid I accidently watched the ""unrated"" director's cut version, but alas, five minutes into a replay was all I could take before enough f-bombs were dropped that I knew it really didn't matter.

There are plenty of other reviews here to give you a synopsis of what little plot there was to this movie.  Honestly, it would probably have been much funnier as a 5 - 10 minute sketch on SNL - there were enough SNL cast members included that maybe this movie is just an overpriced, extended sketch.

But be warned- this movie is extremely over the top when it comes to lewd humor. Do NOT let your young children watch this movie, or you WILL be embarrassed! For those adults who can handle such humor, strap yourselves in for a foul-mouthed ride that will take you through the very slummiest aspects of the campaigning process.

Although the story is, of course, done in parody, and everything (including the raucous dialogue) is embellished and exaggerated upon, what remains true is that the CORE of the election process remains unchanged. The mud slinging, the character assassination, and the win-at-any cost attitude are all put to examination, exposing the absurdities of each of these time honored American ""traditions"". In the spirit of ""The Daily Show"", this movie brings very important issues to light by putting them under the spotlight with a humorous approach.

Zack Galifiniakis's performance was fun, touching, hilarious at times, and well crafted.  Will Ferrell even managed a surprising level of craft at times.

5122568,3,B008220BGQ,"This was probably more enjoyable than it had any right to be. The trailers and marketing for The Campaign had me thinking it was going to be another big miss from the Will Ferrell comedy output, and about five minutes in I was already regretting my decision to give it a shot. Ferrell seemed to be doing his usual routine, while his co-lead Zach Galifianakis was basically just playing a slightly altered version of his alter-ego Seth that he uses in his stand-up routine. About half an hour into the film though, I began to realize that I was actually having a decent time with it.

The narrative, about two stooges going up against each other for a North Carolina congressional seat, isn't anything fancy and is used mostly as a platform to get these two actors to go against one another. Unfortunately, especially given its increased topicality in the current year, the opportunity for political satire isn't used to its full advantage here by any stretch. It's surprising, given the fact that they assigned director award-winning director Jay Roach, that the film doesn't really concern itself with saying too much about the politics of it all. John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd portray thinly veiled versions of the real-life Koch brothers, but aside from that there isn't much in the way of any kind of commentary on the current political climate, which feels like a missed opportunity when you have the director of Recount and Game Change at the helm.

The Campaign won't do anything for you on an intellectual level and as far as the comedy goes, it certainly isn't as inventive as Step Brothers, warm-hearted as I Love You, Man or full-on hilarious as The Other Guys, but it settles itself into a comfortable lesser area where the chuckles come often and the whole experience is easy to digest. There weren't really any moments where I found myself wishing things would go by quicker or reach the inevitable, and very hokey, conclusion.

Ferrell and Galifianakis do things we've seen them both do countless times, yet I was surprised by how they were able to keep working in that same area without me getting sick of them. Lithgow and Aykroyd are a fun pair that are unfortunately wasted with very little screen time, but the biggest surprise of the cast is actually Dylan McDermott, who proves himself to be an impressively skilled comedic actor here. I've never thought much of the actor prior to this, but he comes along and steals the entire movie out from under the headlining stars, with every moment of his being more valuable than just about anything else in the picture.

The Campaign has the occasional moment that got me to laugh with some extra punch, such as a dinner table confessional with the family of the Galifianakis character, but mostly it's just a light and easy comedy that won't leave much on the mind but won't torture you either. There's a lot of missed opportunities, but for what it is this is a safe and mildly pleasurable experience.",1353110400,,2967,4.755339805825242

While it's probably better than say, ""Land of the Lost,"" it doesn't hold a candle to ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby."" Zach Galifianakis is competent and amusing throughout. Personally, I thought the ending was a bit too convenient and somewhat out of character with the rest of the film.

We found this movie to be especially refreshing in lieu of all the recent election attack ads and nonstop coverage that just ended last week. This is not Will Ferrell's funniest movie and it is Galifianakis that slows it down he just doesn't have the same chemistry as with his comedy partner John Reilly  but is still sure to entertain almost everyone and worth the price of rental.

Having seen many trailers for this movie, I was certain that I was in for a treat.

What a bummer this movie turned out to be. A SERIOUS waste of the comedic talent of the cast. The writers made Ferrel's and Galifianakis' characters two of the most unoriginal, unfunny, and unbelievable characters in the history of comedy.

5122651,4,B008220BGQ,"We watched this the night before the election, for a timely kick, and had some good laughs. We also enjoyed the many sharp shots at the corruption and flat out thievery now endemic in American politics. They even mentioned Citizens United! If only more people would speak up about the sick corruption of that law, which has made the buying and selling of our politicians fully legal. (Or at least finally official.)

The Campaign goes after that entire concept and hits a few bullseyes, certainly with the Motch/Koch Brothers, over the top tv ads, and just the criminality of it all in general. I love that at least someone is trying to wake folks up, and what better way than with a sharp comedy?

Unfortunately, Zach, who I often love, is the weak link here, despite some highlights. His character is just his onstage ""twin"" Seth that he's used for years, and he could have been better adapted to this material. Compared to Will, he's a weak sister.

But Ferrell is classic in many scenes, truly hilarious; the guy just has that magic whatever it is that makes someone funny just to look at. Few have ever played shifty dimwits with more flair and comedy than Ferrell, no doubt. McDermott is also spot on and really makes his character come alive. Aykroyd kind of reprises his Trading Places role, if backwards. Most of the other folks are likewise good enough, and Sudeikis shows again that he and Parnell are the cream of the SNL crop since Ferrell left for understated comic genius. I'd love to see those two together with Will on the big screen one day soon.

The blu-ray has a nice transfer but picture quality isn't very vital to enjoy this, and the only extras are some hit and miss deleted scenes. No outtakes?! No nothing else? Kind of weak for the price tag. Get the dvd instead.

All in all, The Campaign is worth seeing not just for Ferrell but to remind ourselves how bad things really are now, and how blithely we accept it while doing so little to change it. When will the real outrage at the endemic corruption kick in? Ever? Better be soon, before we're all taxed and debted into oblivion.

This film will play well as the years go by, in any case. Let's pray it's as a postscript to this era of total corruption, and not as prelude to something worse. Props to Zach and Will for getting it made.",1352246400,,2315,4.513126491646778
5122652,5,B008220BGQ,"""The Campaign"" is a heavy hitting comedy aimed at the process of campaigning for congress and modern American elections. The film was written by `Eastbound & Down's' Shawn Harwell and Chris Henchy and is directed by experienced Jay Roach. Jay has worked with both of the main stars in prior films as well as directed multiple political films and comedies. ""The Campaign"" directly satirizes politician John Edwards as well as the Koch brothers who are depicted as `the Motch brothers' played by John Lithgow and Dan Akroyd (Glen and Wade Motch).

If you are tired of all of the lies on television and sick of all of the guff coming from the news, go and see this film. It was a nice breath of fresh air. Not only was it funny but it was uplifting that there may be hope one day in the political process. All you ever hear about during a campaign is how one person is not as good as the other, how one will be better than the other in certain values. What character `Marty Huggins' (Zach Galifianakis) points out is that: we need to go back to telling the truth and go back to our humble beginnings, where it wasn't about image and power or money. Films like this greatly benefit our nation, they are lighthearted and deliver an important message through laughs and smiles. Sometimes I feel like there is too much drama in the world and it's nice to go out to a movie and laugh.

I did see this film twice, upon the first viewing everyone in the theater was cracking up and the audience ate it up. The second time was a much smaller audience later at night and I don't feel like the audience received it as well. Nevertheless, the message is there and if you are a fan of comedies the jokes are there too.

The irritable Chinese servants are straight out of 'That's my boy', while Cam Brady's wife is a bland version of the wife in 'Talladega Nights'. Much of Will Ferrell's character in the movie, Cam Brady, is carried over from previous movies. I liked Zach Galifianakis as Marty Huggins, he really played a comic humble little guy well.

Actually, the movie was going well, I mean it has a meaning to it, sort of like all these 'advisors' and corrupt businessmen chip in and the ruthlessness of 'The Campaign' tears their lives apart. Marty loses time with his family, then gets separated from his wife, while Cam goes through much the same thing. By the end of it their both worn down, with some hilarious scenes in the meantime.

But despite that promise, I couldn't help but shake that stench of reverse snobbery that infiltrates Hollywood comedies these days, kind of that all businessmen and middle class squares are, behind it all, bad or twisted people. Spray a load of dirty jokes on top and they give themselves a nice pat on the back for 'breaking barriers' or something.

5122680,3,B008220BGQ,"When I heard that Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis were going to be in a movie together I was ecstatic. Not only is Will Ferrell one of my favorite movie comedians but everything I've seen from Zach Galifianakis has been hilarious. However, after watching it yesterday I must say I was a little underwhelmed. This movie is definitely filled with laughs, but they aren't consistent. And when you put these two in a movie together consistency is key.

I'm not going to waste your time by describing the plot because you've most likely read it dozens of times before. If not, the cover makes it obvious. Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis are competing against each other in a political campaign. Will Ferrell plays his role perfectly and it feels like he was made for this part. Zach Galifianakis on the other hand.... It feels like directors are purposely making every character he plays extremely feminine and hypersensitive. Honestly it's starting to get a little old. We saw him play a human man child in The Hangover and the extremely feminine Ethan in Due Date. It's time to let him play some normal roles.

As a whole I felt like the focus was more on the bashing politicians than it was on the comedy. Which, don't get me wrong, I'm all for the bashing of dirty politicians, but as I said before with the two of these in a comedy together the comedy needed to be the main focus. Easily the funniest parts were with Karen Maruyama as Mrs. Yao, a maid who talks with an urban accent. Dylan McDermott (Tim Wattley) and Jason Sudeikis (Mitch Wilson) both gave great performances. To tell you the truth I think this has to be my favorite performance from Jason Sudeikis so far. I've seen him in a couple of other movies and I didn't really enjoy his acting. He did a good job here though.

Overall Score: 6/10 - I was really excited for this, but the movie just feels flat. It definitely had a lot of potential, but the end result is kind of underwhelming. I would suggest renting it before making the purchase.",1351987200,,2014,4.558011049723757

5122708,3,B008220BGQ,"When shady profit-hungry moguls the Motch brothers find their existing puppet politician is under-performing, they decide to replace him. Enter Marty Huggins, an amiable, slightly camp oddball with a loving family as apparently unelectable as he is. The casting practically writes itself: John Lithgow (Dexter, Cliffhanger) and Dan Ackroyd (Trading Places, Grosse Point Blank) have a whale of a time as a sort of evil flesh-and-blood version of Statler and Waldorf from The Muppets, while Will Ferrell (Anchorman, Talledega Nights) is perfect as the smooth, even-toothed incumbent candidate Cam Grady, who's a kind of amalgam of George W Bush (brain power, or lack thereof) and Bill Clinton (extra-marital skirt-chasing).

Zach Galifianakis (The Hangover, Dinner For Schmucks) is of course your go-to for the voter-repelling weirdo with the squeaky voice, suspiciously foreign facial hair and unmanly pet pugs (at one point replaced by all-American Retrievers of a more Presidential bearing).

It's not necessarily a bad thing that you basically sense where this is all going from the off; the overriding raison d'tre of comedy is to make us laugh, and The Campaign's mix of slapstick, name-calling and a couple of risqu set-pieces worked on that front for me. And, to its credit, it doesn't have to resort to aiming at the kind of vulnerable targets Seth MacFarlane's Ted was so happy to smack down. The Campaign would rather target fat cats than fat children, smug dogs than underdogs and the slimy rhetoric of campaign gurus than rhetorical devices dependent on the rule of three for which you can think of no good final example.

While The Campaign doesn't represent a career-best for this cast, that's largely because between them, they've starred in some all-time classics that take a lot of beating. This is a funny, sweet-natured and sincere movie driven mainly by its characters. It's not a political comedy in the vein of The Thick Of It or Veep; it happens to be about politicians, more than it is actually concerned with the intricate dance of how policies are made and governments run. Nevertheless, it contains a strong and welcome streak of cynicism regarding the US electoral system which every now and then augments the broader silliness with unexpected force - and you can certainly argue that a political system which has become bogged down by a focus on character needs to be satirised accordingly.",1351555200,,2418,5.131979695431472

Hilarity ensues as the two candidates face each other, and question the purpose of the whole campaign.

THE CAMPAIGN is funny.  I haven't truly enjoyed a Will Ferrell movie for some time, and Galifianakisis's film work has been hit-and-miss for me, so I was pleasantly surprised by how amusing this film is.  A lot of credit goes to director, who's proven with the AUSTIN POWERS films that he knows how to handle gross-out humor and slapstick.  Still, it's Ferrell and Galifianakis who carry most of the burden here, bringing a little depth and nuance to their hijinks.  Funny as these two are, the show is almost stolen by their respective campaign managers: Jason Sudeikis, playing it straight and probably being the most relatable, likable guy here (it may be the accent); and especially Dylan McDermott as the ace killer Tim Wattley (basically an updated Gordon Gekko, but in politics).  Also nice to see, as always, is Brian Cox as Marty's father.  And kudus to Lithgow and Akroyd, two comedy vets who still know how to do it right.

Overall, THE CAMPAIGN is a satisfyingly-amusing comedy.  It's got some belly-aching scenes, and a few others that fall flat, and a nice moral core that helps save it from utter forgetfulness (how many films of this sort do you simply not remember seeing?).  It's not as good as the two stars have delivered (ANCHORMAN and THE HANGOVER come to mind), and even Roach's first AUSTIN POWERS film was funnier (hell, maybe even the second one), but if you want to spend the evening with a few friends and some popcorn, you could do worse.",1351468800,,1858,4.789968652037618

The supporting cast was also perfect and this is very close to being a great comedy. The only thing keeping it from crossing into greatness to me is that the characters did seem a little overused from other movies, but if that's the worst thing about the movie that should say something.

5122715,3,B008220BGQ,"Are you unhappy with the current state of American political discourse? Do you want an improvement, or would you settle for any change that came along? If so, you might enjoy this latest offering from Will Ferrell.

  Cam Brady (played by Ferrell) is a four term congressman who was about to run for a fifth term unopposed when, after dialing the wrong number, he leaves an explicit message for a woman other than his wife. The family who received the message released it to the press and, almost immediately, Brady's polling numbers began to decline. Elsewhere, wealthy businessmen Glen and Wade Motch (played by John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd) were looking to increase profits by moving their Chinese factory to Brady's district while leaving the conditions (i.e. toxic work environment and low wages) the same. That way, the Motch brothers (Lithgow and Aykroyd) would save on shipping. When Glen and Wade saw the difficulties Brady was experiencing, they decided to support the son of a powerful Republican. Once he was told, Marty Huggins (played by Zach Galifianakis) agreed, filled out the proper forms and entered the race. To increase Marty's chances of winning, his campaign manager Tim Wattley (played by Dylan McDermott) gave Marty, his family and his home a complete makeover. And so began a slew of scandalous photos, unfounded accusations, and embarrassing misstatements we've come to expect from a contemporary election.

  Now, I have liked some of Will Ferrell's other films. The most recent example is Stranger Than Fiction where he played a solitary IRS agent who begins to hear the voice of an omnipotent narrator detailing the events of his life. As for Galifianakis, I like him as a comedian but find him lacking as an actor. The supporting cast, Lithgow, Murray, McDermott, and Brian Cox who I neglected to mention, are talented and I am a big fan of all of them. Still, I didn't enjoy this film.

It is a satire of the American electorate who relish slogans and sound bites over substance. It makes a statement on how our nation can be bought, but not as good as Steven Colbert. At times the film becomes too over the top and loses sight of the satire.

5122737,4,B008220BGQ,"After you watch a commercial or trailer for a new comedy, how often have you said ""I'll bet they put all the funny bits in the trailer."" Many times? I sure do. And, unfortunately, we are often correct.

Comedy is hard. What makes people laugh is often so subjective.

I made this comment after watching the trailer for ""The Campaign"", the new comedy starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galiafinakis. Given Ferrell's recent track record, I had no reason to think otherwise.

So, I was surprised by ""The Campaign"". It is pretty consistently funny and much better than you might expect.

Cam Brady (Ferrell), the unopposed, incumbent Democratic Congressman who represents a small district in North Carolina, is a born politician, willing to do and say anything for your vote. When a sex scandal looms, he doesn't give it much thought. He is extremely popular and doesn't really care. Even his wife seems to disregard the scandal; Cam is being considered for a Vice Presidential run and she can't wait to be Second Lady. But the Mocht Brothers (John Lithgow and Dan Akroyd) are disappointed with the profits from their Chinese Toy factory; the child labor earns too much and then they have to pay to ship the product to the United States. So they want to have a significant portion of North Carolina rezoned so they can build a massive factory, import Chinese child labor and save on the shipping. But Cam won't sign on prompting them to find a candidate to run against the incumbent. They zero in on Marty Huggins (Galiafinakis), the son of a former North Carolina congressman, who runs a small tourist agency. They send Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott) to run Marty's campaign and he immediately begins turning the new candidate's life upside down. Marty is initially resistant to the changes, but begins to catch on and prove to be a formidable candidate.

Directed by Jay Roach (""Austin Powers"") and written by Shawn Harwell (""Eastbound and Down"") and Chris Henchy (""Land of the Lost""), ""The Campaign"" may seem like a typical Will Ferrell film, but it has a lot more going for it. More laughs, more satire, more dark humor and it has something to say. All of this contributes to help make the film something worth watching.

Ferrell is clearly channeling his George W. impersonation. From the moment we first meet Cam, we realize he is a career politician, willing to say and do whatever it takes to maintain his power, his image, his place in Washington. As the Democratic incumbent, he sees his district as his personal tool box; he can play with anyone and anything he pleases. But Ferrell reveals more layers to Cam's character making him more interesting than the typical man-boy who refuses to grow up so often portrayed by the comedian. When Cam runs unopposed, Mitch (Jason Sudeikis, ""Horrible Bosses""), his campaign manager, has to make a few calls to cover up his boss' frequent missteps.

And when Marty enters the picture, you can see the momentary indecision cross his face. What should he do? Is Marty an obstacle and if so, how can he overcome it? It doesn't take Cam very long to remember all of the tricks and trades of being a politician and he soon kicks into high gear, providing a little bit of 'shock and awe' for his wet-behind-the-ears opponent.

One of the best things about ""The Campaign"" is watching the change in Galiafinakis' character. Initially, he decides to run because he wants to help preserve his district. As soon as he agrees, the Mocht brothers send in Wattley, to mold and shape Marty into a candidate the American voter can get behind. Marty, his wife and two kids, don't understand why their life has to change but Cam instantly criticizes his two small Pugs, his ""Chinese"" dogs, and when this becomes a campaign issue, Tim changes the dogs and photographs the family with two all American dogs.

Galiafinakis imbues Marty with the perfect amount of doe-eyed innocence and a strange, affected accent, both of which make him instantly strange and unusual. But as he realizes what is necessary to win the campaign, a reality hits and his demeanor begins to change. Throughout, you can see the new and old Marty fighting for dominance, fighting to take over.

But Roach does a very interesting thing with the two leads. As you watch all of this going on in Marty's life, you realize Cam has already gone through all of this. Watching Marty gives us insight into Cam's life and character. It is like watching two different stages of the same character concurrently.

Dylan McDermott is a real surprise. As Tim Wattley, the professional campaign manager sent in by the Mocht brothers, he insinuates himself into Marty's life in a funny and unexpected way, popping up behind or near Marty and his wife whenever he feels like something is going off track. He also seems barely able to control his disappointment in Marty, a fact that barely seems to register with the virgin candidate.

Jason Sudeikis is the straight man to Ferrell's Cam and doesn't generate a lot of laughs.

Sarah Baker (TV's ""Go On""), who plays Mitzi, Marty's wife is a standout. She experiences the same things her husband goes through, but gives us an idea of what the wife goes through. And she provides a good sounding board for all of Marty's strangeness.

Karen Maruyama is a scene stealer as Mrs. Yao, the housekeeper for Marty's dad. Every time she appears on screen, she says something that makes you laugh. Her character is pretty un-PC but the circumstances for her behavior are very memorable..

Dan Akroyd and John Lithgow play the Mocht brothers, greedy industrialists. The sequence of their tour through the Chinese toy factory is filled with some funny sight gags, which are, sadly, probably more truthful than they should be.

Jay Roach has created a funny comedy which derives a lot of laughs from biting comments about our current political landscape. There are a lot of laughs, the film contains a lot of dark humor and the performances are better than average.

However, the film falters in the last act because the filmmakers seem to feel it necessary to give some of the characters redeeming qualities. They have to do good, to become a good person, which detracts from the earlier dark humor, the political satire. It leaves the viewer feeling slightly wronged in a way.

But because there are so many laughs, so much humor, these few Hollywood-necessary moments at the end of the film can and should be overlooked.

""The Campaign"" is a funny, biting reminder of some of the worst aspects of American politics. And it couldn't be more perfectly timed.",1347580800,9,6573,4.795755968169761

Ironically, Roach directed two sharp-eyed HBO films, the recent Sarah Palin-skewering pageant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-Change/dp/B007KAUZY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game Change</a>&nbsp;and the Bush-Gore hanging chad saga&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Recount/dp/B001AMHNKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Recount</a>, both of which clearly brought forth the Machiavellian nature of the electoral process within the context of actual political history. Without real-life events to guide him, Roach retreats into a big-screen version of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Night-Live/dp/B0014CBN9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Night Live</a>-style sketch comedy with plenty of sight gags but frankly not enough jabs at the current bewildering state of political advertising.

Ferrell plays Cam Brady, a four-term congressman from North Carolina's fictional 14th district, who runs unopposed until a crude phone message he left for his mistress gets broadcast to the media. This act motivates the powerful Motch brothers, who are driven to build an economic dynasty in the district, to find the only candidate they could find at the last minute, Marty Huggins, a small-town travel agent who happens to be the unintended scion of a longtime political family in the state. Initially inept as a politician, Huggins gets groomed by campaign manager Tim Wattley to reshape Huggins' life completely. The movie then becomes a series of one-upmanship between Huggins and Brady that escalates into backstabbing tawdriness. These scenes are particularly hilarious, for instance, Brady's butchering of ""The Lord's Prayer"" during the first debate, Huggins being connected in Brady's commercials to Saddam Hussein just because of his moustache (shades of Trump's birthing campaign), and Brady's baby-punching gaffe (repeated over and over again in faux-news coverage).

My favorite scene is a throwaway montage where the Huggins family takes a break and reverts to their Twinkie-swilling, pug-caressing ways for one evening. As funny as these episodes are, I was hoping there would be a sharper political edge to the comedy. It all feels a few steps behind the surreal realities of the current presidential campaign, meaning provocative parody appears intentionally bypassed for a risk-free gag-fest, one that doesn't linger that long in the memory. Ferrell and Galifianakis easily deliver all the expected laughs as Brady and Huggins, although when the film gives off a whiff of pathos (e.g., Brady's meltdown in the office), the film simply feels off. Dylan McDermott is effectively slimy as Wattley, while Dan Ackroyd and John Lithgow have a good time playing the erudite Motch brothers (recalling the Duke brothers from Ackroyd's 1983 comedy with Eddie Murphy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trading-Places/dp/B0035LMTVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trading Places</a>). Personally, I got tired of Karen Maruyama's running gag as a maid faking a Deep South accent, but Katherine LaNasa and Sarah Baker were quite good as the campaign wives. Undemanding viewing.",1345334400,6,3798,6.609218436873747
5122739,3,B008220BGQ,"I pretty much like Will Ferrell and Galifianakis even in the bad movies in which they have appeared.  So I didn't think my money would be that poorly spent even if ""The Campaign"" turned out to be overall awful despite their usually good performances.  But this movie wasn't bad.  Not an award winner- but very much a fun time comedy with some solid laughs.

This is a comedy that knows it is a comedy and stays a comedy- even when it is delivering its ""message.""

I went alone to this movie and it genuinely made me laugh out loud- as it did the rest of the audience on more than a few occasions.

Run out to the movies and see it though?  I can't say that- but if you got some time on your hands and are convenient to a theater?  Sure- go see it.  As for when it comes out on some pay per view option?  I would definitely recommend it.  Good ""movie night"" rental.",1345075200,3,864,4.144578313253012
5122740,4,B008220BGQ,"It just occurred to me that ""The Campaign"", a boisterous, pedal-to-the-floor, wall-to-wall political satire, could have been inspired by Seth McFarlane's ""Family Guy"".  In some ways, Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis), the unassuming tour guide, could have been a character out of ""Family Guy"" (maybe Cleveland), or even Peter Griffin (with a few tweaks) himself.  Marty is a common man urged, especially by his distant, gruff father Raymond (Brian Cox) to throw his hat into the ring against the North Carolinian 14th district's slick but vapid 5-time elected senator Cam Brady (Will Ferrell), a cross between John Edwards, George W. Bush, and, surprisingly (to me), New England Patriot quarterback Tom Brady (must be the last name).  What follows for the rest of the movie is among the dirtiest, mud-slingingest, outrageous political rivalries ever set to film.  Seth is probably eating his heart out (unless he was one of ""The Campaign""'s writers).

  I'll try not to describe the plot too intricately.  The other posters preceding me have done a wonderfully complete job.  Instead, I'll try to give some idea of the satire's scope, which extends far beyond the political, which is practically everybody.  Christians, evangelicals, atheists, snake worshippers, outsourcing, unscrupulous organizations, gun nuts, children's books masquerading as communist manifestos, sex tapes, drunken joy rides, illegal immigrants, even babies and cute dogs - they all get parodied.  Much of the time, the satire penetrates the target; other times it's a little too strident and awkward.  Most of the time, though, I think you'll laugh, unless graphic profanity and images offend you (do NOT bring the kiddies).

  However, the biggest parody in the movie falls on the gullible public (aka, us), who eats this political swill and disinformation up.  It seems that the more offensive the accusation either candidate puts out, the more beneficial it is to his campaign! Nevertheless, the movie (and both Cam and Marty) realize there is a limit to the chicanery.  With Cam, it's his borderline pornographic campaign video ad; concomitantly, with Marty, it's realizing that his willingness to listen to his campaign handler's sleazy pointers has led to his wife ""contributing"" to that pornographic video ad.  Marty may have his idiosyncrasies, but he's not stupid.  But is he courageous enough to run his campaign based on the truth?  Can the truth actually help him win?

  ""The Campaign"" is a well-timed, sharp poke in the eye to our political system and citizen's values.  It even has a slogan (devised by Marty) that appropriately speaks to our state affairs ""I'm bringing my broom...because it's a mess"".  I kinda have a feeling Romney and Ryan will be borrowing that slogan pretty soon, and demonstrating that ""The Campaign"" may turn out to be not a ""Politicians Gone Wild"" production, but actually a real-life political documentary!",1344816000,,2922,5.2727272727272725
5122741,5,B008220BGQ,"It's fair to say that both Will Ferrell and Zack Galifiniakis are in top form in this excellent comedy whose release coincides with the Presidential Election campaign.

Ferrell excels in playing over the top alpha male type characters, and his years of impersonating Bush for example on SNL pays off handsomely in this entertaining romp, because he truly can adopt that type of presence.

I was half expecting another formulaic comedy, yet the writer dials up the absurdity from the get go, sending up the political election process, and I am sure it will appeal to people of all persuasions, and foul is fair in this campaign.

Cam Brady, career congressman runs unopposed for reelection until two billionaire businessman decide to put up an unlikely opposing candidate.  But can an unlikely nave nobody transform into a ruthless political somebody, or will he be eaten alive by the sophisticated political machine of one Cam Brady?

Ferrell plays Cam Brady, and Zack plays Marty Huggins who is a little odd, and definitely not your political type.  He likes to walk his (Chinese) pugs, but when he gets a campaign manager and image consultant, he has to get labradors because they are more American and they test through the roof.
His wife has to get a Katie Couric haircut.

Some of the funniest pieces are the political ads, which absurdify the negative campaign ads we often see, and are laugh out loud funny.  I also like the squaring off before they do the political debate where they do the dominant hand shake, and the stare-down, and the under the breath trash talk.  If you're like me you will be amazed at the antics these two resort to to get ahead in the ratings.  And you will be amazed at what gets them ahead in the ratings.

Even in the supporting roles, the actors are good, especially Dylan McDermott as the Huggins campaign manager, and Katherine La Nasa (formerly married to Dennis Hopper)excels as Brady's potty mouthed trophy wife, but the best surprise for me was Karen Maruyama as an Asian American maid role playing a different type of maid to please her throw back employers.  Truly hilarious.

If you have loved Will Ferrell movies I think you will love this because he is in top form here.  I hope this was helpful.",1344729600,8,2245,4.737789203084833
5122742,4,B008220BGQ,"'The Campaign' is very funny and entertaining from start to finish. Rated-R, and Acting Performance Superb. Of course, the political ads are laugh-out-loud fun, and ads like we have never seen before. The roles of the men who wish to get in office makes you laugh, but also makes you think about the what if in real life as you ponder if anyone with personalities such as a few the film portrayed could actually be elected to office. Overall, as a comedy, it's a great summer movie to get some laughs and enjoy. Highly Recommended for all those who love satire and fun-filled comedy!",1344643200,3,583,4.615384615384615
5122743,4,B008220BGQ,"With the fall elections upon us, director Jay Roach unleashes this timely skewering of politics and in fact, the electorate.  Will Ferrell is at his cornpone best as a 6 term congressman who again expects to run unopposed.  He makes a series of blunders that begin to concern his supporters.  Needless to say, they involve some profane and sexual comments and actions.

A pair of super rich brothers (a thinly veiled take on the Koch brothers) played by Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow sees an opportunity to unseat Cam Brady (Ferrell).  They need someone they can count on to relax hiring standards to build a Chinese-like sweatshop in Brady's district in North Carolina.  Through a local connection, Raymond Huggins (Brian Cox), his son Marty (Zach Galifianakis) is drafted to challenge Cam.  Marty is a dufus who runs a tour bus that takes visitors around the town. But the brothers send a political expert (very good Dylan McDermott) to run the campaign.

Marty is married with 2 boys.  Perhaps the best scene in the film takes place around the dinner table (think Ferrell's ""Talladega Nights"") when Marty and his family pause to volunteer sinful activities they have done that might come up in the campaign.  Unfortunately, the trailers give away some of the dialog, but the really raunchy stuff comes here from the mouths of the kids.  I was laughing so hard, it brought tears to my eyes.  Hopefully the home video (DVD, Blu ray) will include more of these bits.

While the writers and the Ferrell/Galifianakis duo pretty much deliver non-stop brilliant stupidity, some of the jokes do fall flat.  Perhaps the satire is also focused on the voters rather than the politicians.  Certainly, `tweets' of sex organs and thousand dollar haircuts will ring familiar, but many of the faux pas actually improve the candidate's popularity.  For example, when Brady puts out some obscene ads, his ratings go up.  When Marty pulls out a weapon, his ratings go up.  This isn't a perfect movie (few are) but there are enough hilarious scenes to make it worthwhile.  It is mean-spirited, raunchy, profane, vulgar, shameless and offensive.  I vote yes!",1344643200,2,2139,4.921787709497207
5122744,4,B008220BGQ,"If you like your politicians served up on a platter and skewered with sharp pierced objects, you're probably going to appreciate this movie and laugh a lot.  Will Ferrell and Zach Galfinakas deliver strong performances, though cartoonish, as the warring candidates, and there is a good supporting cast that includes Dan Akroyd and other recognizable faces, that lend an air of gravitas to this movie.  The best part of the movie are the satirical political ads shown, as there is such a thin line between those in the movies and those we're bombarded with on the air-waves, that it only takes a little suspension of belief to think that someone might actually air an ad like the ones in this picture.

The movie is short, which serves it well, and the humor is biting.  The movie definitely deserves its R-rating as the language and sexual content are strong.",1344556800,2,859,4.783783783783784
5122745,4,B008220BGQ,"Much of the success behind movies and their release dates is attributed to timing, and in that regard, ""The Campaign"" will be a smash hit. Smack dab in the middle of a huge political season and a vote to determine the future of our country right around the corner, ""The Campaign"" takes politics and humiliates it. Though as much as the joke is about politics, the joke may be on the people or the voters even more. Most of the gimmicks in the movie ring true, although taken to the extreme. Much of it shows how the way we vote, is not beyond ridicule.

 Will Ferrell plays Cam Brady, an incumbent congressmen who is running unopposed and is backed by big money. Despite scandals galore, he continues to be voted in, and this time he is running unopposed. That is until a big money corporation decides to create a candidate that will do their bidding. That is where Marty Huggins comes in. He is a weird guy. The only thing that makes him feasible is a father with a political background. They reshape his life and mold him to their liking. He can be manipulated and Brady and his scandals are ripe for the takedown.

 ""The Campaign"" is reality taken to the extreme. As much as the gimmicks in the film are over-the-top, ridiculous at times and sophomoric, they are all realities. Watching the movie is refreshing to laugh at the things that we complain about on a daily basis but also like wearing egg on your face because we buy into the political gimmicks. The political environment has become a schoolyard slap fight and ""The Campaign"" takes that fight to the extreme. The canned speeches, the blame game, the bought and sold candidates, the background politics, the poll numbers going up and down based on scandals and sound bites, and the lack of honesty are all fair game.

 For me, the movie hit home as a testament to the deteriorated nature of politics. Don't get me wrong, this is an exaggerated comedy and it is raunchy and revealing at times and I found myself laughing throughout. Yet, as much as it is a really good comedy, it is also a social commentary on how ridiculous we've allowed elections to become and how far we have to go to retrieve some sort of honesty and dignity in politics. Cause ""The Campaign"" is just a movie.",1344556800,,2243,4.525925925925926
5122746,5,B008220BGQ,"Synopsis: a five term congressman accidentally dials the wrong number and leaves an obscene, detailed, message to his mistress. The resulting publicity (and his superb attempt at spinning) nosedives his polls. Enter a couple of Wall Street scumbags who want to sell land to the Chinese so that they can build a mega-sweatshop in the district, so they finance a local, clueless, borderline gay stooge to run against the Congressman. He is aided by a cunning, evil, campaign manager. The campaign quickly escalates into total war, with no prisoners.

Ferrell is at his best in portraying a pretty boy scumbag and the obscene jokes and the vicious satirical jabs are nonstop. At times, I was shrieking from laughter. At other times, I thought that the satirical jokes were too extreme and unrealistic and then I remembered all the political crap from the past decade, from both the political idiots on the left and the political cretins on the right, and the equally stupid journalists, and the imbecilic constituents, and the greedy traitors from Wall Street, then realized that they did not go far enough!",1344297600,3,1104,5.0
