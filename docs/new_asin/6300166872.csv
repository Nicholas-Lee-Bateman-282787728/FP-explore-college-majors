As a very young Satanist, I always enjoyed this raven-haired buxom beauty's ""Movie Macabre"" presentations. She was an E.C.I. of Mine. Indeed, it was on her show that I first saw ""The Devil's Rain"" accompanied by her lighthearted {or should that be 'dark-hearted'} smart-ass {& what an ass it is!} commentaries.

 Much later, after the show was sadly placed in its respective video=coffin, I was delighted to find more of the episodes at the local library through 'Thriller Video'. Amongst them, were such titles as ""The Crawling Eye"" & ""The Carpathian Eagle"". European low-budget films no one alse would show. Segments such as the Mailbag, & characters like 'Breather', a greasy obsessed fan, the stereotypical pervert,  who would call up Elvira from a local payphone wheezingly exhaling into the receiver, always managing to disgust the hostess.

 Well, after having recorded them for My personal collection, I saw neither succulent hide nor long, shiny, silky black hair {it didn't matter that it was a wig} of her other shows, until this past weekend, when a friend of Mine unearthed ""Two! Two! Ah-Ah!"" {in the Count's accent} Elvira presentations!

 The first, called ""The Witching Time"" {to add to the effect, it should have been arcanely spelled ""tyme"", but I digress}, but like I said, a real limburger.

 There she was, the Gothic Goddess that she is, strewn out luxuriously sedictive on that opulent Victorian dais, like a feline succubus stretched out ever so alluringly.

""The Witching Time"" is about a witch who escapes the stake by transporting herself through time. Haggard, ragged, dazed & confused, she is overwhelmed by the progression of technology, after being found by the owner of the estate.

 When he locks her in a room while he calls a psychiatrist, she feels betrayed, & accuses him of summoning the Magistrate to see her burn. When he returns with the shrink, she is gone from out of a completely sealed room, which brings into question his own sanity to the doctor. A bit later, she re-appears to indignate him scathingly. From here on, she causes mayhem, causing the owner & his girlfiend into madness until they have a talk with a priest, who, I believe should have had a major role in the movie as an exorcist - here, he is merely a brief & transitory chracter who may have just as well been cut out. Speaking of editing, a recurring disappoinment was some of the more dramatic highlights being rudely censored, curtailed, probably in order to remain within the one hour timeframe, which was a pity.

 There was one scene in which the girlfriend lit but two of the three red candles on the candlearium she was carrying, but at least there was continuity, as a subsequent scene  showed only the same two candles lit.

 In the end, the witch is dowsed in a horse trough, disappears again, materializing by by a blazing balefire ignited by the crazed owner of the estate.

Another irrelevant storyline was in that the witch had fashioned an effigie of herself, which came into possession of the girlfriend, who finally ended the witch's havoc by throwing it into the fire. Now, why did she fashion a doll in her own image? Bad script-writing.

 Overall, ""The Witching Time"" is predictable, cheesy, but a great laugh at parties.",1123459200,,3403,4.834482758620689
7803532,1,6300166872,"This movie is just plain bad.  More like the plot and action of that Halloween movie of that Charlie Brown show.  But I'm not saying that Charlie Brown and the Great Pumpkin is bad, just that's a comedy cartoon of Halloween.  This is the category ""Action Horror"".  So I'm just a little surprised.  You don't have to watch it, and you'll be glad.",1003276800,,345,4.412698412698413
