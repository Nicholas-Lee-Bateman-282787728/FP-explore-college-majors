8382401,3,B002VR9QZA,"~ The lineup of performers for this 1993 concert includes some outstanding contributors to the history of jazz.  Unfortunately, between low-quality images and often truncated performances the value of this DVD is somewhat diminished.  The sound is good for a live concert.  The editing is bad to the point of being irritating - as soon as the last note of one performance has been played the video jumps immediately into the next tune.  The flow of the DVD would have been greatly improved by allowing the audience clapping to fade after each tune and give the viewer / listener a breather before the rapid switch into the next tune.
- The show starts off with a rousing 4:44 romp through a classic by the Count Basie Orchestra (CBO).
- Steve Allen joins the CBO for a brief 3:20 ride on the ""Night Train"".  While his playing is not spectacular, it is adequate.
- Nancy Wilson shows that she still has a great voice and great timing as she is backed by the CBO for a 3:09 version of ""All of Me"" .... one of the highlights of the show.
- Wynton Marsalis and Harry Edison do a fine 3:22 job on ""Shiny Stockings"" backed by the CBO.  Nice, but nothing exciting.
- Cab Calloway gives an enthusiastic 2:53 rendition of ""Minnie The Moocher"", but the voice is not good.
- ""Come Rain Or Come Shine"" is given a nice warm treatment by Della Reese backed by an all-star trio.  Della is still in good voice.
- Monk's ""Straight, No Chaser"" is performed by a group of all-stars backed by the Frank Foster Big Band (FFBB).  All are well known; some are unfortunately past their prime, and the group seems to be making up the arrangement on the fly.  In doing so, the strong players overshadow or dominate some of the weaker players and the track comes off as disjointed.
- Frank Foster fronts the CBO in a warm sentimental reading of ""Here's that Rainy Day""
- Rosemary Clooney's 3:42 rendition of ""I've Got It Bad And That Ain't Good"" with the CBO is taken at a very slow pace, which sometimes reveals wavering in the voice.
- Unfortunately, ""I'd Rather Drink Muddy Water"" by Joe Williams is truncated at the beginning so the recording seems to be joining him in the middle of one of his famous monologues.  The result is a short 1:25 appearance by Joe, who was in good voice.
- The 3:06 highlight and surprise of the entire show is the outstanding, enthusiastic, joyful piano performance on ""Hallelujah Boogie Woogie"" by pianist Dorothy Donegan.
- ""Oye Como Va"" by Tito Puente seems to be more about putting on a 2:06 show rather than focusing on the music itself.
- Perhaps the low point of the show is Michael Bolton's over-the-top rendition of ""Georgia On My Mind"" while the great Ray Charles sits isolated on a chair and listens to his masterpiece being reduced to a prolonged 4:15 showpiece.
- Lionel Hampton and Illinois Jacquet recreate the classic ""Flying Home""  Whatever amount Lionel's skills may have been diminished by age is made up by his enthusiasm and the great playing of Jacquet.
- The DVD has a pair of bonus performances: an all too brief 2:00 ""Willow, Weep For Me"" by Marian McPartland's trio followed by a sadly truncated 2:00 minute ""Pretty Baby, Bye-Bye"" by the great Joe Williams.",1366934400,3,3190,4.5691768826619965
