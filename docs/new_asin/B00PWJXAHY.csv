8750700,5,B00PWJXAHY,"Highly engaging and revealing film pained from different perspectives - very educational and well done by authorities on the topic; not at all surprising given the quality and success of past Fish Navy Films,  ""Why we fish"", and ""Fish Meat"". For folks that strive to understand the traceability and sourcing of their seafood, possible environmentally friendly solutions, or who merely enjoy eating shrimp, this film is worth watching.",1426204800,,434,5.382352941176471

8750704,5,B00PWJXAHY,"This is a must watch for everyone, even if you don't eat shrimp!  This film sheds light on so many health, environmental, and economical issues that our dependency on import and even local caught wild shrimp pose on not only our, but also our loved ones, daily lives.  I guarantee you will think twice before just grabbing a bag of frozen shrimp from the grocery store after watching this film.  Not only was this film incredibly informative, but it was very entertaining to watch.  I am typically not a huge fan of educational films, but 'Raising Shrimp' kept me engaged and interested from start to finish.  By the end of the film, not only did I want to learn more about the consumption of shrimp in the US, but I felt like I needed to share this information with friends and family.",1420934400,,786,4.507042253521127
