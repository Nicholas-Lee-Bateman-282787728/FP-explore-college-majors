OR IF YOU JUICE FRUITS VEGGIES WITH SEEDS WHAT HAPPENS IF THE SEED GOES THROUGH THE JUICER AND INTO WHAT YOU DRINK, WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU; REGARDLESS IF ITS A HOME JUICER OR A PROCESSED JUICE FROM THE STORE?  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE TERMINATOR GENE IN SEEDS CROSSES OVER ALL WILD PLANTS? THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT ARE GOING WRONG WITH GMO TREES, AND COMMODITIES IN GENERAL.  THIS DOCUMENTARY PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO AREAS NOT COMMONLY KNOWN THAT NEEDS TO TO TOLD TO ALL.  WELL DONE DOCUMENTARY.

What is not covered and should be, is why not make GMO weeds where the weeds can't reproduce????? Why modify the food, modify the weeds.  Maybe they are, but not the way we would like them too; but in a way that makes them more money... Just say'n...",1396656000,3,856,4.532467532467533

8363953,5,B002CGT0VA,"A Silent Forest is a documentary about the largely unknown potential danger to human health, and the environmental health of our planet, posed by the planned introduction of genetically engineered trees. Narrated by well known and respected scientist Dr. David Suzuki, the film lays out, in compelling detail, the dangers of open-air plantations of these untested man-made trees.

Cross contamination of private, national and state forests with patented genes contained in the pollen of genetically engineered trees is a known danger. Who would now own these infected trees? Would a company like Monsanto be able to go into a national forest and harvest the infected trees because they contain their patented genes? Could this be the ultimate agenda?  This film is a wake-up call to the dangers of genetic engineering plants and trees, and the devastating impact it will have on the land, the food supply, the animals, insects and all of us.

In easy to understand terms, this movie explains the severe ramifications of infiltrating our lands with (GMO) genetically modified or engineered trees and plants. It's amazing how scientists are so willing to plow ahead (no pun intended) with an agenda that has unknown consequences for the future of life as we know it.

Very scary stuff. Open your eyes and see what is happening in our world today with GMO plants and our food supply. If this is allowed to continue, in just 10 to 20 years our land will become contaminated and unable to sustain life. But we can fight against this insanity by collectively banning together. The first step is arming yourself with knowledge. Watch this program and tell everyone you know about what is happening right now in our own backyards. It is happening people, so WAKE UP and smell the roses because in the future, the roses may not have any smell at all.",1299715200,6,1841,4.909967845659164
