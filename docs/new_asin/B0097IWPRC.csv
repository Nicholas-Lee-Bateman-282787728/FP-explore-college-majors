5276910,5,B0097IWPRC,"... concerning the superstar status of ""countertenor"" Philippe Jaroussky, this DVD compendium of his Greatest Moments in Concert should certainly convince you. Jaroussky has a fine voice to be sure, but it's his technique that makes him special, his breath control, his tuning, his command of dynamics and phrasing, and above all his subtle artistry with the embellishments which bring Baroque music to life. His technique is second to nobody's of any gender.

These concert clips date from 2006 to 2011, and feature Jaroussky with seven of the hippest HIPP ensembles on the scene: Ensemble Matheus, Le Concert d'Astr&eacute;e, Ensemble Artaserse, L'Arpeggiata, Ensemble La Fenice, Concerto K&ouml;ln, and Quatuor Eb&egrave;ne, plus three 19th C songs accompanied by pianist Jerome Ducros, plus a Shostakovich Prelude for two violins and piano, with Jaroussky playing top fiddle. The composers include Vivaldi, Handel, Monteverdi, Purcell, Strozzi, Porpora, Caldara, Rossi, Cavalli, Sances ... and then Hahn, Lekeu, and Massenet! It's certainly true that Jaroussky's brilliant technique is on display more in the 17th/18th selections that in the Parisian salon songs; the former are simply better music, but the latter are charming enough. There are 33 tracks in all, a cornucopia of vocal splendors.

I mentioned the hipness of the HIPP ensembles, didn't I? Jaroussky is a remarkably ""good sport"" for a superstar. He's willing and able to play around with pop styles and jazz inflections, especially with Christina Pluhar's L'Arpeggiata and cornettist Doron Sherwin. And he pulls off some delectable spoofery with female tenor Marie-Nicole Lemieux. This is a DVD of high artistry and hi-jinks. Jaroussky is at his best in concerts, where and when his presence is best felt, rather in in fully-staged operas. Not that his acting skills are poor! He's at least as good an actor as Luciano Pavarotti ever was. But his singing is so much more astounding than his character-playing that one almost wishes he'd just stand stage-front and warble.

Jaroussky is paired with soprano Nuria Rial on two tracks: Monteverdi's ""pur ti miro"" with L'Arpeggiata and Handel's ""io t'abbraccio"" with Artaserse. This is a vocal marriage made in Heaven! The two voices are utterly dissimilar yet blend and tune with each other magnificently.

You can hear most of these ""moments"" of Jaroussky's various CDs, and indeed if you are a Jarousskynik you might well have those CDs already. Even so, it's a treat and thrill to see him project and emote. Don't miss it.",1370217600,8,2540,5.264197530864197
5276911,5,B0097IWPRC,I almost didn't purchase this marvelous DVD because of incorrect product details. The DVD is 161 minutes not 91 minutes and the aspect ratio is 16:9 and not 1.33:1.,1366243200,,164,4.689655172413793
5276912,5,B0097IWPRC,"I have seen and listened to most of the video clips on this DVD on YouTube and was positively enraptured by Jaroussky's performances. He is one of the few artists whom I find it fascinating to watch as well as listen to, since his emotive gestures and fantastic jaw control add to the expressiveness and drama of the arias he sings.

One of my favorite clips is Porpora's Alto Giove, which is a sublime, slow aria that Jaroussky sings so touchingly that I have to be mopped up from the floor and put in a bucket to revert back from a puddle to a solid state (NB Jaroussky omits the arias fast B section).

And then there are the videos with L'Arpeggiata from the Ambronnay Festival. The anonymous Ciaccona di Paradiso e dell'inferno, a typical ""morality"" piece from the Roman school around 1650, it is a dialogue between devils who try to tempt a soul into sin. But the soul resists, preferring eternal bliss in heaven to some devilish fun. It is a short piece, playing about 3:30'. Jaroussky enters to sing the first strophe in the role of the virtuous soul. When he is finished, one sees, much to one's surprise, L'Arpeggiata's fabulous chalumeau player and their violinist don sunglasses and sing the next strophe together, which describes the bright light cast by the fires of hell. During the next strophe, again sung by the soul, Jaroussky acts dismissively with the devils. These exchanges continue until the last strophe, when Jaroussky sings that he prefers the light in heaven and dons a pair of sunglasses himself.

Monteverdi's Ohime ch'io cado is a solo chamber cantata on a passacaglia bass sequence. L'Arpeggiata and Jaroussky start the piece in a way that corresponds completely with how one would expect to hear this composition. Then, suddenly, things change, and the ensemble starts to ""jazz up"" Monteverdi in an unexpectedly entertaining and fun manner. Jaroussky even reverts to his natural baritone voice for a few seconds, before putting his hand on his mouth in an as-if-surprised manner at what he just did. He quickly reverts back to his counter tenor voice, but by then, with the jokes - even Christine Pluhar has difficulty maintaining a straight face - the jazzed-up version of Monteverdi, and the fabulous singing by Jaroussky accompanied perfectly by freely ornamented passages in the chalumeau, violin and consort musicians drive the audience to wild enthusiasm. This is simply a video which one must see before dying.

The majority of the rest of the abundant video clips are arias from Handel and Vivaldi, accompanied by the excellent Ensemble Matheus under Spinosi's baton, Ensemble Artaserse and Le Concert d'Astree conducted by Emanuelle Haim. They mostly do not take the same liberties as L'Arpeggiata in the two pieces described above. They are ""just"" beautiful, though Jaroussky jokes around discreetly with Nouriel Rial in Monteverdi's Puro ti miro from L'Incoronazione di Poppea. The discrete fun the two singers have with the piece is fun to watch, and the singing is again fantastic. Jaroussky also sings Handel's Son nato a lagrimar (which Handel lifted from his own Brockes Passion twice over) from Giulio Cesare with Anne Sophie von Otter. This duet couldn't possibly sung better.

Jaroussky ventures into more modern repertoire too, notably the Trejo from Piazzolla's Los pajaros perdidos which he singes wonderfully, as well as some art songs, like Hahn's glorious pasticcio in baroque style, A Chloris, Lekeu's Sur une tombe and Salvador's  Linda. These art songs do not suit Jaroussky's style like they did David Daniels, and one gets a feeling that he is nervous singing them. They are certainly the weakest videos on the DVD. But there are only 3 chansons like that on the DVD, so one can easily skip them.

The only person who deserves some criticism for their performance is Emanuelle Haim. Watch her in, e.g., Vivaldi's Venti, turbini. When she conducts, she looks like she's halfway between cramps and a seizure. Her shoulders are totally stiff and she barely conducts the L'Astree musicians. The best compliment I can give Ms. Haim is that she looks like Stephen Hawking.

Surprisingly, the result is stil very good, but I now know why Haim prefers to only work with her own ensemble, who seem to understand her spastic jerks and don't mind endless rehearsals to get things right, because the grapevine says that Haim primarily conducts by talking a lot. One can understand that in January 2010 she was fired from the Paris Opra production of Mozart's Idomeneo after the orchestra complained of aesthetic and stylistic differences. It is simply impossible to follow her gestures, which is what most likely bothered the musicians at the Paris Opera. She was reinstated for a new production of Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie, but with her own Concert d'Astre in the pit. Since Concert d'Astree is an ensemble used to her idiosyncracies she needed them in the orchestra pit to get through the performances of Rameau because they're presumably the only musicians who can follow her (or who are so good that they can just ignore her and still play together).

This DVD is highly recommended for the generous selection of music, which runs for 161 minutes, and for the singing of the incomparable Philippe Jaroussky, who is one of the best singers in the world today in any category.",1362441600,5,5333,4.943080357142857
5276913,5,B0097IWPRC,"One of hte best DVDs for an evenining of great singing by a master of the art who is serious, funny, reverent and irrevent at the same time.  A masterpiece.",1360713600,,156,4.2
5276914,5,B0097IWPRC,"First I must confess that I find listening to a countertenor not enjoyable.  But I heard Jaroussky sing on u-tube and I really enjoyed his sound.  So I took the plunge and bought the DVD.  I really know nothing about this style of music so my judgements are purely subjective.  Listening and watching to this DVD, and I have done  many times now,  has been a joy.  Joroussky's voice is absolutely beautiful and enchanting.  The musicians that accompany him are outstanding.  The music is profound and somber, and yet, there a few laughs.  Buy this DVD it's really wonderful!",1359244800,3,574,4.707070707070707
5276915,5,B0097IWPRC,Jaroussky sings beautiful music beautifully.  Always.  An additional bonus are the performances that are humorous thanks to his acting ability.,1355356800,3,143,6.1
5276916,5,B0097IWPRC,I really liked this overal presentation. I encourage you to listen to this collection of Master Peaces. Selections from the best Baroque Operas and Composers that we know of. Each aria is very well executed and sounded really good. I love the subtitle option. You can actually sing along in many different languages and understand what they are saying. I got distracted by it's humor though.,1354838400,,391,4.9393939393939394
5276917,5,B0097IWPRC,"Many fans of artists have been longing for to own a video footage made professionally from favorite artist's concert appearance, yet, there was never been a single video on the market which delights fans, become an instant treasure and a happy reminder of the moments at the concerts one was able to attend.  This video is all that and more.  Its entire footage are dedicated to bring the excitement, incomparable beauty, intimacy and warmth of concerts Mr. Jaroussky never fails to deliver and not only that the selection of the arias and the concerts are so well done. It clearly shows Mr. Jaroussky's artistic growth from 2006 to current year during which Mr. Jaroussky developed as an extraordinary artist and a star countertenor.

His focus from the early stage of his career are to devote whenever possible to bring more interests in countertenor's voice, neglected composers' work and to direct limelight on fellow countertenors.  His legendary kindness, selfless dedication to his art and sincerity as a person are the natural driving forces in materializing all his wishes.  We have not enjoyed such an abundance of great countertenors and many baroque opera productions as today without his effort of many years.

This DVD captured all that went behind this gentle but strong-willed Apollo of
countertenors and most certainly will become a cherished treasure for not only his fans but also for music fans who love the ambiance of great live concerts.",1354838400,16,1460,5.0625
8537435,5,B0097IWPRC,"I write in 2018. If a certain American political leader should succeed in ending the world as we know it or bringing it to its knees, this disk should be put aside in advance for future as of yet unevolved, unborn generations of post-humans to learn from and cherish, so that they can see and appreciate what some of us were capable of being and doing. Counter-tenors can be an acquired taste, but I can't think of a better, more thrilling, and more profoundly moving way to acquire it. A series of masterpiece performances by a living-legend virtuouso of vocal masterpieces. Tears, sobs, yelps, and genuflections of joy at what we can be at our best and most exultant. If only the entire world and our leaders could be this way.

P.S. The region-listing appears to be incorrect, in that at least the Blu-Ray disk I received plays in any U.S. standard (Region A) Blu-Ray player and appears to be universally playable (Regions A, B, and C).",1516320000,,939,4.622754491017964

8537437,5,B0097IWPRC,"Philippe Jaroussky has performed in three series of Australian Brandenburg Orchestra concerts and I have been to four of his live performances.
Great Moments on Concert is 2 hours and 41 minutes of outstanding classical music enjoyment. As a bonus there are other performers and some architectural delights to add to the enjoyment of this DVD.",1473465600,,343,5.142857142857143
8537438,5,B0097IWPRC,"As well as serious spiritual music by Handel there is humour in the performances too in some songs by Vivaldi and Monteverdi. Henri Purcell's 'Sound the Trumpet' for instance, develops into the Latin 'The Peanut Vendor' and Philippe has a brief moment of jazz improvisation with a boisterous choir and lively percussion reminiscent of a street parade with Pascal Bertin.
The beautiful love duets with soprano Christine Pluhar accompanied by authentic instruments of the L'Arpeggiata Ensemble, from the era of Monteverdi, are wonderful.
 Again there is an unexpected tongue in cheek French version of 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight' as Philippe is joined by members of the Quartet Ebene  who form a harmonious choir as he sings the 'whimowey' chorus line. (sadly although she is pictured in the wings, the lovely duet with Natalie Dessay on 'Barcarolle' from this same concert is not included).
Several entertaining duets with contralto Marie-Nicole Lemieux including 'Nel profundo cienco mondo' from 'Orlando furioso' by Vivaldi, with the Ensemble Matheus, are featured.
The selection showcases the versatility and large charismatic personality of Philippe Jaroussky who brings the vocal music to life.

Several duets with contralto Marie-Nicole Lemieux are very entertaining",1459641600,2,1269,5.530927835051546

8537440,5,B0097IWPRC,"The very best of the singing art. The best countertenor in music history and one of the best classical singers ever. I have many cds from Jaroussky (and other countertenors and singers),  additionally, I had the pleasure to see the two concerts he performed at Colon theatre in Argentina (my country) last November. This blue ray reflects fully Jaroussky artistry. Rush to buy it. Do not say I did not tell you.",1419206400,2,411,4.708333333333333
8537441,5,B0097IWPRC,"This big fat share of PJ's wonderful singing is hand-picked by himself, so he explains.
This item is about the most comprehensive footage of any classical music singer there is to-date, so PJ fans are definitely rapturous, and so will those less acquainted with baroque music or classical singing, since the choice in this very substantial footage includes also a number of more light-hearted outings that are quasi-cross overs, and also includes a performance by Jaroussky THE VIOLINIST.
Philippe Jaroussky has, in more than one decade, became a cult figure in counter-tenor singing that almost NO other counter-tenor ever achieved. This can be accounted for by an indescrible and sweet timbre (especially in the years before 2010), ultra-elegant phrasing, perfect intonation and spell-bindingly gentee stage presence. He is also a keen communicator on stage, who yields absolutely no distance between himself and his audience, no matter how complex the work he's performing.
There is however ONE complete concert performance (that in Versailles in 2009) that I would absolutely wished to see and hear in its ENTIRETY that only found its way here in bits and pieces. That fantastic concert, on the other hand, has not been formally issued commercially.
IF that one is being included HERE in its entirety TOGETHER with the other contents of this collection, I can die with no regret.",1410912000,2,1383,5.20627802690583
8537442,5,B0097IWPRC,"Philippe Jaroussky is a countertenor gifted with the Voice of an Angel!  I enjoyed every moment of listening to this very gifted singer give heart and soul to every one of these beautiful songs written for the Castrati of the 18th and 19th centuries.  In my opinion I think Philippe's voice is most likely the closest we will ever come to realizing what an actual Castrati sings like.  The Castrati voice is unique in history, as far as I know, and very beautiful.  I would love to give a personal thanks to Philippe Jaroussky for his magnificent job of bringing this style of music back to us of the 21st century to hear and enjoy.  BRAVO!!",1407283200,2,641,4.491379310344827
8537443,5,B0097IWPRC,"The beauty of his voice is unsurpassed but when it is enhanced by his musicality and his artistic interpretation, everything is a revelation. The essence of the castrati voice, other than the virtuosity, is that it has a purity which would be the voice of angels. I think this is the one I like best.",1387929600,,300,4.472727272727273

Where is there a voice of more accuracy, more effortless control, more emotional truth than Jaroussky's?  And we are given everything from Vivaldi and Monteverdi  to Shostakovich, from  exquisitely sympathetic duets with Nuria Rial to swinging Purcell's Sound the Trumpet to burlesque singing contests.  ( Well, it's a shame he doesn't give us Mozart, Cherubino say, but certainly everything before that. )  As a bonus the filming is good and helpful, and the venues are Europe's finest.",1383955200,5,572,5.031914893617022
