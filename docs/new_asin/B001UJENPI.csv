3801856,2,B001UJENPI,"I had hoped this would be a nice film showing lots of scenery on the train rides. Something I could watch over and over again or even on a loop for a couple of hours. Unfortunately it's more of a commercial documentary, something you might see playing in gift shop whilst you were on vacation there. There seem to be more shots of inside the buffet section of trains than any thing else, and sadly due the voice over narration explaining everything constantly seen on screen (and it never stops) it's unlikely this will get watched more than once.

A shame.",1349395200,3,557,4.514851485148514
3801857,1,B001UJENPI,"I purchased this expecting to see all the views of scenery from the trains. Big mistake. If you lump every shot on the disc that shows views from the train it might total 5 minutes, the rest is about the food cooked on the trains, the kitchens, the rooms, etc.",1344729600,2,260,4.22
3801858,2,B001UJENPI,The quality of this video is good but I thought I would see more of what you actually see on these trains. Its really just a dvd to promote the train trips! Hawking all the amenities and stuff. Has alot of history but really hoped to see more of the National Parks not all the hoopla you can get from the trains! And its LONG! I put it in at 10:00 and its still going as I write this review at 11:25! What a diappointment! I will be sending this one back!,1334793600,,455,3.9565217391304346
3801859,4,B001UJENPI,"This video in Blu-Ray is vivid and gorgeous. It takes you places you may find hard to do for real and when it is finished, you feel like you were reliving your trip all over again. It is a good addition to my collection and fulfills my interest in both travel to places that would be almost impossible for me to get to and adds the excitement of riding the rails once again. I have probably missed all opportunities to travel this extensively but it does provide a second best experience that is exhilarating and very enjoyable. Perhaps I give it only 4 stars so that I may reserve one for myself in hopes of doing it for real. I grew up in the 50's when steam was both at it's zenith and near it's end. Some sweet memories there! Of course, doing it for real is hard to beat but this brings you about as close as you can get.",1293840000,5,826,4.136645962732919
3801860,1,B001UJENPI,"This video is not worth a nickel if you are hoping to see trains!!!!!  This video should be given away free by the U.S. government, because it is a 100 minute commercial for the national parks, NO MORE, NO LESS!!  The trains in this video are shown during the first 90 seconds of each 'great ride', their words, NOT mine.  The rest of the time, they are showing mostly the ammenities of all the places where they want you to spend MONEY!!  They show the hotels, and the lodges, and the cafes, and the buses, and the touring cars.  Yes, the video quality is good, 1080i, but I expected a lot more of the trains!!  Shame on me!!  CAVEAT EMPTOR!!",1284940800,4,643,4.308333333333334
3801861,5,B001UJENPI,"I put this in the machine thinking I would just play it in the background while I was reading a book, but I watched every second of it. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen! Maybe I was just in the mood for this kind of a virtual adventure. It was probably some form of escapism. I forgot where I was and enjoyed traveling to some far-away places that were worth visiting.

During the train segments, I felt like I was on those trains. At times I was glad I wasn't on some of them because I would have been terrified at the long and extremely high bridges. Excellent photography! I've never been to Alaska and had no idea just how beautiful it was. I knew about most of the other parks and had visited them, but not from the viewpoint shown on this DVD.

I kept wishing all the train lovers in my family could see it.

After I finished the ""Train"" part, I thought I would go fix some lunch and let it continue into the lodge and hotel portion of the DVD, because that sounded pretty boring. It wasn't. I had to come back in and start that section over again and watched every second of it too. Some of the hotels took 3 hours riding pack-mules to get to and others could only be reached by long boat rides. One hotel overlooked Old Faithful, and the inside of it was worthy of a novel being written about it.

If this DVD is an example of the Scenic National Parks DVDs, I've got to have more of them!",1267401600,23,1403,4.147058823529412
3801862,4,B001UJENPI,"I got this for my 79 year old dad for a Christmas gift, and he really enjoyed it.  He'd been on one of the trips, so it was a lot of fun for him to see the train again.  I wish each trip was a little 'meatier' and allowed more time to see the inside of the train, the view, etc.  But overall, it was a nice little show and gave me a couple of good ideas about possible future trips.",1264982400,10,382,3.691358024691358
3801863,3,B001UJENPI,"I felt obliged to give a blu ray disc along with the player.  I was hoping to show the capabilities of the blu ray.  Some of the shots were good, some OK.",1264032000,,154,3.78125
3801864,5,B001UJENPI,The filming is outstanding especially when viewed on a high quality high definition big screen monitor.  This Blu Ray DVD covers outstanding train rides that can be taken today.  This disc should not be missed by anyone interested in outstanding train travel today.,1248393600,17,265,5.1395348837209305

8343968,3,B001UJENPI,"Informative documentary, the only issue is the pacing is a touch too rush for a train related documentary.",1410739200,,106,4.944444444444445

8343970,3,B001UJENPI,I bought this for my toddlers to watch.  They expected to see trains and saw more interviews and park information than trains.,1395619200,,126,4.7272727272727275
8343971,3,B001UJENPI,"I love both trains and national parks, but I don't feel that this video did either much justice.  There wasn't much detail about the trains and precious little detail about the parks they serve.  Pretty shots but could have been so much more.",1371254400,,242,4.604651162790698
8343972,5,B001UJENPI,After working on these for 32 years I never get bored with good quality videos. This Blu-Ray is superb in detail and adventure. We plan to board the Grand Canyon tour this spring and maybe the White Pass before I get too old and cripple.,1364342400,,237,4.288888888888889
8343973,5,B001UJENPI,"I found this video to present a nice variety of potential train rides to enjoy while seeing our national parks. It also included some ideas for overnight stays while traveling. All of the footage was well done and showed the ride's high points to full advantage. Definitely something to view before taking any trip through the parks, or to the parks.",1362960000,,350,4.754098360655738
8343974,5,B001UJENPI,"Five different train rides, plus a whole second section of the dvd exploring some amazing park accommodations.  This gave me a good feel for whether or not such a vacation would be a good fit.  I was sorry to learn that at least one of these trains has gone out of service.  So... here is a beautiful piece of history.",1360195200,,318,4.266666666666667
