7127298,1,B00WAJ8RE0,Not a good knock off of JB music. The original is much better,1457568000,2,61,3.769230769230769
7127299,1,B00WAJ8RE0,I agree with all the other comments. Don.t waste your money. Its a rip off.,1456704000,4,75,4.066666666666666
7127300,1,B00WAJ8RE0,"This was a horrible waste of money and time. Obviously put together by someone outside of Jimmy's camp. If you like Linda Ronstandt, most of the middle of the DVD is old performances of her, not Jimmy. As a long time Parrot Head, this was almost insulting. DO NOT waste your time or money on this.",1455667200,4,297,4.321428571428571
7127301,1,B00WAJ8RE0,"I think this was put together with 80's tech. Weird Amazon is selling boot legs. Songs skip and video is poor. My case had the ""Jimi"" spelling as well. Too funny.",1455580800,4,162,4.258064516129032
7127302,1,B00WAJ8RE0,"I am very dissatisfied with this product; it is of cheap quality, and Jimmy's first name is spelled ""Jimi"" on the cover! Nothing new in the DVD that isn't already on Margaritaville TV website or Youtube.  Very disappointed.",1455408000,11,223,4.868421052631579
8712628,1,B00WAJ8RE0,Completely bootleg!!! Best way to treat this crap is to take the dvd (recorded side) & put a long knife scrape to it. OR take your frustrations out for being duped by simply bending it till it breaks!!!,1510876800,,202,4.342105263157895
8712629,5,B00WAJ8RE0,Really enjoyed it.,1501891200,,18,5.333333333333333
8712630,1,B00WAJ8RE0,"I rarely write reviews, but I have to on this one. The first clue is when the cover said ""Jimi Buffett"".  It went down hill from there. For example: very old and poor quality video.  The current video is not much better.  Save your money and buy at CD",1496102400,3,251,4.081632653061225
8712631,1,B00WAJ8RE0,"This thing is a certified stinker! Don't waste your money or time. I am a huge Buffett fan but could not even finish this -b grade docucraptomy. No offense to Jimmy, but this this thing reeks of amateur poop! Sorry to tell ya, but had to warn ya.",1495843200,3,246,4.145833333333333
8712632,1,B00WAJ8RE0,"Don't buy.  Collection of poor quality clips from interviews, movies and other places.",1492732800,3,86,5.615384615384615
8712633,5,B00WAJ8RE0,LOVE IT,1491523200,,7,3.0
8712634,1,B00WAJ8RE0,"What a JOKE (and complete RIPOFF)!!!  The story of Jimmy Buffett???  This is a mishmash of a few recycled clips from formerly released Buffett DVDs/Videos.  It is NOT a documentary or story.  In addition it contains a few songs from Linda Rondstadt's 1970s tours - go figure that one out???  I'm not one to post reviews of products - but this one was SO BAD, I felt compelled to warn fellow parrotheads.",1490400000,6,403,4.541666666666667
8712635,1,B00WAJ8RE0,"Yeah, don't buy this. His name is spelled wrong, and it's mostly a random Linda Ronstadt concert cobbled together with a few Jimmy (Jimi?) clips. We laughed our asses off at how bad it is, but I wish I hadn't spent money on it expecting a nice Christmas present for my Parrothead husband.",1484352000,,288,4.452830188679245
8712636,5,B00WAJ8RE0,"Love, Love, Love!",1482883200,,17,5.0
8712637,1,B00WAJ8RE0,I never thought I'd give it one star but that's all it deserves. The other reviewers described it well. When I saw Jimi Buffett on the cover I expected it was some kind of bootleg product ripped from You Tube.  Save your money.,1458604800,6,227,4.27906976744186
