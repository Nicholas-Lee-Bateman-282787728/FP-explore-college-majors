8008815,5,B00019G4HS,"Life with Father and Father's Little Dividend are absolutely great movies and great quality.
However, The Last Time I Saw Paris is also a great movie, but the production of the movie is defective.  It stops and goes on and off.",1464048000,,227,4.536585365853658

8008817,3,B00019G4HS,"I bought this for Life with Father.  It is a great movie!  I was very disappointed ;however, in the quality of the video.  I have seen this on tv many many times and the colors are brillantly beautiful - but not this dvd.  It looks like there is a constant glare on the screen, and the colors are very very dull.  I hope the company will reissue this and restore it with all the vibrant colors that this movie really deserves.",1389052800,2,426,4.209876543209877

8008819,5,B00019G4HS,"I felt very inclined to write a review on this DVD of Liz Taylors three movies that are stuck in public domain hell!  It arrived today- and let me tell you- getting my hands on this DVD title was NO easy task!  Amazon does not have it- and I got it off of ebay brand new for like $5.00- still sealed.  However- some the the sellers that specialize in DVD's on ebay list this DVD as available and then after you pay for it- you get an email telling you it is out of stock.  Good luck on your hunt for this release!!

Now about the DVD.  I was skeptical about it myself- I rarely buy these public domain titles simply because and to put it bluntly the quality generally sucks.  However, I remember years ago getting the Joan Crawford film ""Autumn Leaves"" on VHS from Goodtimes home video and was shocked to discover the print was fantastic.  As a matter of fact when Columbia Tri Star home video renewed the rights and saved Joans film from public domain hell- the print was almost exactly the same.  So I knew Goodtimes took pride in what they release.

After reading the above review- my hunt was on for this DVD- as I am an Elizabeth Taylor fan, and having the Liz Taylor signature collection that includes ""Father of the Bride""- I had to have the sequel ""Fathers Little Dividend""!

Now back to this DVD.  The print of ""Life with Father"" is just so so.  Not horrible - not great.  I wasn't really looking for thie film anyway- it is a bonus that it is included. The colors in this film are off- it looks like a colorized version. It may be- I haven't done my homework so I don't know if it was filmed in color or not - but it is definately a watchable copy.

""Fathers Little Dividend""- can I say how PLEASED I am with this transfer!! Granted it is not a ""remastered"" WB title- but let me tell you it is the BEST print you will find.  SKIP all the other public domain releases- this is the BEST.  I was actually overly pleased.  The black and white was even, there is specs floating about on the print- but the best way I can describe this print would be - it is like an official WB/MGM title released on VHS - (remember how MGM home video was releasing classics on VHS like crazy - minus the remastering that is so common today)- however sharper and more defined - without the graininess of VHS.  It is really a very good print- just don't compare it to the new WB DVD rematered prints of black and white films.

""The Last Time I Saw Paris""....aaaahhhh this is the last time you will need to look for a better print- unless offically released from WB.  GREAT COPY! The color is very good- the picture is very sharp- which I was worried about when I saw the opening credits- then when the movie officially starts it is clear- sharp- again- DONT expect WB DVD quality here- but also DONT expect the worse.  The sound and picture are great and Elizabeth Taylor is a true knockout in this film- she is gorgeous and this DVD does her justice.  The film does have the constant speckles running through it- but easily overlooked.

Even the packaging of this DVD is great.  The cover art is well done.  THANKS to Goodtimes! This is really a GREAT DVD for $5.00 of three films that are stuck in public domain.

I seriously recommend you fans get this while you can.  It is harder and harder to find.  You will likely not find it in any store- I know I couldnt.  It is worth it.  Again, don't expect digitally remastered quality- think again of the quality as an official VHS_ however clearer- and sharped- for DVD.  Enjoy!",1141084800,10,3514,4.309451219512195
