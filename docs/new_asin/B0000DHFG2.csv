1924920,1,B0000DHFG2,"This is not a film, like it says in the box. I feel very disapointed because there was not real description on this dvd item.
It also put under doubt the real saint that he was. When you buy something like this is because you believe in it.
It was so awful to me, I didn't bought a discussion I bougth a movie of the SAINT.",1278028800,5,323,3.909090909090909
1924921,1,B0000DHFG2,"This film/ documentary did nothing for me, and was a bland and at times inaccurate portrayal of one of the world's Most Loved historical figures.  Although I have done a large amount of reading and research on Saint Francis, I can honestly say that you can find out more about his life from ""googling"" him and reading two random web-pages.  It is hard to imagine in 60 minutes any less could be said about St. Francis.  Moreover, some of the information was completely false.  In my opinion, and this is only my opinion, this film in no way illustrates the Life of a man who merged with God and became a Living Prayer himself.  In others words, spend your money else where.",1217635200,9,673,4.483606557377049
1924922,5,B0000DHFG2,"I had always heard stories about St. Francis of Assisi, but seeing this documentary really showed this man of faith struggle with himself, his faith, his religion, and the higher powers within the Catholic Church. He just wanted to share his faith simply with others but his popularity brought problems of its own. It is a movie that every person of faith should see no matter what religious tradition they come from.",1202169600,,417,4.805555555555555

1924925,5,B0000DHFG2,This version of St. Francis is the most realistic of all of them. It reveals how all of us must struggle towards God in our journeys on earth. Watch it.,1141430400,6,152,4.1
1924926,4,B0000DHFG2,"In this production, St. Francis comes out of the birdbath.  He is seen more human like the rest of us than in many of the previous films about this remarkable saint.  We see and hear of his struggles all throughout his life.  We are told that even in the end of his life he considered himself to be a failure while at the same time able to demonstrate an amazing faith in God.  Insights into his life and times as well as his personality helps to fill in a lot of the blanks that exist in many other works about St. Francis.  This is a good resource for those well versed in the life of St. Francis and those who are just discovering him.",1119571200,21,638,4.112903225806452

8001098,5,B0000DHFG2,"This was a very good documentary, except as a traditional Catholic I was offended when the liberal author of the book on whom this documentary was based, and who played a big part as commentator, tried to claim that the Holy Stigmata St Francis received from the Lord (the marks of the nails in his hands and feet), were actually leprosy sores contracted from nursing lepers.  Although St. Francis did nurse lepers and the seriously ill, and contracted many infections from them....there's no historical documentation that he had leprosy. It was a great documentary, the historical re-enactments well done, and the location shots beautiful. The narrator did a great job.  But for the liberal host and author of the book, who obviously had an agenda, to try to debunk a long held and cherished memory of St. Francis (receiving the marks of Christ) was insulting.",1466553600,2,861,4.931034482758621

8001103,3,B0000DHFG2,This is not a movie. It is commentary with some  acted scenes. Commentary is by well known experts on Franciscanism and could be of interest to those who know little about St. Francis.,1402444800,,184,4.575757575757576

I read all the reviews on _Reluctant Saint - Francis of Assisi_ and was interested to observe the divergance of opinion regarding this film. I could not help but notice that opinion was pretty much evenly divided between those who really liked the film and those who really disliked it. For myself, I definitely find it helpful to be able to relate to a sanctity whose humanity is revealed rather than to a sanctity of one who appears to be superhuman. As a matter of fact, I believe that the great saints were not superhuman, but real human beings just like you and me who by their God-given free-will allowed God to literally enter into their souls and take over so that no longer did they live, but God lived in them, that is, the Transforming Union. This requires struggle and suffering and dying to oneself of which none of us are immune, but to which all of us have the choice of saying ""Yes"" to God. St. Francis entered into this struggle and came out the other end as a saint of momentous sanctity, that is, he entered into total union with God. All he had to do was ""Let go and let God"", a supposedly simple thing to do, but requiring the utmost simplicity and humility. That is the message and miracle of St. Francis and message to us all, that we are all called to a similar sanctity and only have to follow the lead of the great saints who, though all different in the example manifested by their sanctity - for St. Francis the Counsel of Poverty -, allowed themselves to be totally possessed by Love, that is by God Who is Love. To some saints this happens quickly, to others slowly according to God's plan for them and according to their need to grow in humility and simplicity,  ""Unless you become as a little child, you cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven"".
The reason I love this film is because it shows the humanity of St. Francis, a humanity to which we can all relate.
May we all be blessed by the Gift of St. Francis!",1378771200,2,2129,4.735849056603773
8001106,1,B0000DHFG2,"The movie should be viewed with a discerning spirit.  I have not read Spoto's book, but there is an interview on the dvd where he details his big guy education and profession.  As is all too common with theologians; however, I could not tell if he is a Christian or not.  He does not proclaim that he knows and loves Jesus, he just proclaimed himself.  Aside from Spoto and his book, which were reportedly used to make the movie, the movie has very little credibility, a fact which is most likely due to the editor Kris Liem and/or the production company, Faith and Values Media.  And here is why I am stating this.  Not very long into the movie, which is full of supposed expert commentary, a lady broke in saying ""I think he was on the brink of madness...what I know of people who are sort of treading near enlightenment, that you can go either direction, and he was hearing voices.  I am sure that he didn't know why.. that he wondered himself if he was crazy.""  Well, these comments set off the alarms of discernment, praise be to the Holy Spirit.  The mark of the deceiver was obvious.  I did a quick search on the internet to find that the lady, Gretel Ehrlich, is a practicing buddhist.  Later she said on the DVD  ""suffering was his path to enlightenment""  CHRISTIANS BEWARE...... the editor and producer, whether they know it or not, are engaging in syncretism, mixing the truth of Jesus with the lies of Satan.  The opinions of a deceived journalist are mixed in as if she knows, but her buddhist deception will mask the truth, particularly for unknowing or unaware Christians.  Pray for Jesus to lighten the way for the lost while there is time for them to be reborn.  Yes, even Gretel can be enlightened, and must be before she can be saved, but she must give herself to Jesus.  As Jesus states in John 10, ""Most assuredly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.""  There are many other ways to enter the spirit world such as Zen meditation, Shaman, even just with drugs as in the western world, but these ways all lead to death.  Enter into the sheepfold, the spirit world, only by the door, only by Jesus.",1293840000,6,2206,4.402469135802469
