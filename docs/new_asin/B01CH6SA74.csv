7682897,3,B01CH6SA74,"The 4K quality is excellent in this film, very clean and very sharp. It also has dual color range options accessible from the menu so you can play the movie in HDR or SDR (where a lot of 4K discs are HDR by default).

The cons:
There is a lot of footage on here that is lower res, what looks like 1080 and 480p shots. This is due to the methods that some of the old historical footage is captured in. So this equates to a good 20% of the film being shown within a frame, as the lower res video is shown in its native aspect ratio and size.

I would have given this a higher rating, but when you have a 43 minute film and the first 10 min is video in a tiny frame in the middle of the screen, it's a bit disappointing.

I don't think its a bad movie, but when you are paying for a 4k movie, you expect the entire thing to be 4k.",1465430400,91,827,3.824561403508772

With IMAX fidelity and narration from Patrick Stewart, it's one of those disks you'll pull out for guests when you want to show them what your system can do.  3-D and 2-D Blu-ray looks terrific and the 4K UHD is simply amazing but remember you need a player like the 4K UHD player (Samsung UBD-K8500) for it to play the 4K disc.

7682902,3,B01CH6SA74,"Let me start by saying I agree with the very critical review by 'Steve' but not the 1 star rating.
He is perfectly honest in all his statements but I like this enough to give it 3 Stars which may be a little generous, there is a fair amount of grainy video. Reminds me of the disappointing 4K release of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind which I was NOT very kind to.
If classic films like The Hunchback Of Notre Dame (1939) can be beautifully restored to perfection why can't everything else.
I have a 4K TV and player, both have HDR support but there is no way I can adjust it to look normal.
Maybe it's the nature of the technology to enhance everything but I consider it a Visual Assault or Insult!
In order to use HDR I have to -

1. Go to Personal Picture settings.
2. Adjust Contrast
3. Adjust Brightness
4. Adjust Color

Despite all this effort ALL the bright colors are still fluorescent and skin tones are washed out.
Every TV has a definite Contrast Ratio, the difference of the darkest & brightest values it can generate.
HDR does NOT expand this, it only increases the volume and in theory the color palette displayed.
So how many colors does it take to make an image?
As many as you can see.
If I want to watch a DVD or standard Bluray I have to make readjustments again.

HDR is not worth the effort for me.
I want NORMAL images, NOT Andy Warhol stuff.
4K discs are impressive overall but I honestly can't see the difference between them and the best 1080p ones.
I am tired of redundant technologies that do nothing to enrich my life, but only those who stand to make a profit by telling me it will.
Maybe I need a Thneed.
I am very happy with my standard Blurays and I will not replace them with 4K discs, but as I write this 8K definition is in the works so who knows.",1511740800,,1786,4.216374269005848

7682920,4,B01CH6SA74,"I really liked this.  It looks amazing in 4K HDR, no question about it.  There's some amazing footage here.  I have a few small complaints that keep me from giving it 5 stars.  They are, arguably, not fair criticisms, but I share them nonetheless:

- The first half or so of the film is real footage, but the second half talks about future trips to Mars.  We of course don't have real video of this, it hasn't happened yet.  So there's lots of CGI stuff here.  It looks great, but it'd be nice if they included a ""simulation"" sub-title to make it clear when we're looking at real vs CGI footage.  There is real stuff mixed in in this section, but I found it hard to trust what was real and what wasn't when I knew there was so much CGI mixed in.
- The older non-4K stuff is shown in smaller frames, rather than upscaling them to 4K to fit the screen.  There's no perfect solution here.  Especially some of the older 480i TV footage just isn't going to look good blown up.  Even with 720p or 1080i or p, there's not necessarily anything wrong with their choice to show it in a native resolution taking up part of the screen rather than showing it upscaled.  But it's not a common technique for dealing with this, so it was somewhat odd looking.
- It's short, but I knew that going in.  Still, would have loved to at least have a full hour, especially with the amount of CGI that's included.  But none of the IMAX stuff appears to be longer than 45ish minutes.

These are all minor complaints.  Overall this is a great way to get some really great 4K HDR space footage.  I hope there will be more releases that give us more content in the future, but for now there isn't much available besides this.",1496275200,2,1697,4.283018867924528

7682932,1,B01CH6SA74,"*updated July 2017 to fix a couple typos*

Let me start off by saying that when they claim this is narrated by our beloved Captain Picard they aren't telling the entire truth.  All told he narrates about 4 min of this entire ""film"" and the rest of it is narrated by a couple other people.

Now for the video quality itself.  If you are buying this for the same reasons I did, which was to see awesome space stuff in 4k HDR as well as watch a 1080p version in 3d while learning cool stuff then I suggest you DONT BUY IT.

First most of the footage isn't shot in 4k or even 1080p.  The majority of footage shown is stock footage from various other sources most of which is standard definition resolution.  The stuff that is in 4k is very minimal and clearly reused IMAX footage from something else.

This is stuffed to the brim with stock footage presented in a small box in the middle of your 4k tv.  Even the 1080p 3d disc has the same issue on a 1080p TV.  They use tons of old non hd footage and stick it in a box that sits in the middle of your tv.

The 3d parts themselves just like the 4k parts are minimal.  They do alot of taking old static images and making a person pop out of the background but most of the video is not shot in 3d or even presented in 3d.  The footage that is shot with real 3d cameras looks great as does the 4k stuff but it's so minimal I feel that the product description is false advertising and that's just unfair.

Don't buy this looking for great 4k, don't buy this to learn cool new things or to hear Patrick Stewart narrate and don't buy it for the 3d because added together each makes up about 10% of this movie.

There are better options out there so don't be sucked in by the lower than average price for a UHD Blu-ray.  In fact there are more informative videos on YouTube some of which are in 4k albeit not as high quality 4k as this.

Save your money for something better.  Something that doesn't misrepresent what it is to earn a quick buck.  You didn't buy a nice 4k screen and uhd Blu-ray player to watch standard definition content.  I know I didn't.",1489536000,171,2096,4.153846153846154

7682949,2,B01CH6SA74,"Color me disappointed.  I wouldn't have bought it knowing what I know now.  There are a handful of shots that are breathtaking, and because I saw ""The Dream is Alive"" in IMAX when it originally came out, I know there is a lot of high-def video available.  I was hoping for a lot of NASA space shuttle mission film in 4K.  Almost nothing is what you get.  The bulk is either much lower res, or is of things completely unrelated to the Space Shuttle.  To be fair, the title doesn't say ""space shuttle space footage"" so I can't complain too much, but do not buy this to see NASA space flight footage because there is little to see.

There's probably more shots of the Endeavor rolling through the streets of Southern CA and on the back of a 747 than any actual space shots.

Oh, and it's not really narrated by Patrick Stewart.  He does maybe 25% of the narration.  That's fine, but saying that's it's narrated by Patrick Stewart is like saying it has Shuttle mission video from The Dream is Alive: it's technically true but ultimately disappointing.",1483747200,14,1047,4.492063492063492

What on earth?

So to be clear you are watching this movie and it fills up the whole screen then suddenly you are looking at a box inside of the TV that has boarders all around it and the footage is not 3D an half the size of your TV, but the background is 3D.....OMG what were they thinking...why would I be buying BLU-RAY if not to see it on my big screen?

7682982,3,B01CH6SA74,Great movie.  Only like 30 minutes long.  Boy did I overpay!,1467936000,8,60,4.363636363636363

7682984,5,B01CH6SA74,Very interesting i-max video about space travel. I really liked the part about going to Mars. I really hope mankind can setup a permanent base there in my lifetime.,1466985600,,164,4.689655172413793

7682987,5,B01CH6SA74,Really good visuals.  This IMAX 4K UHD BluRay is a good compliment to UHD television.  A good door opener for IMAX dvd's,1465689600,3,120,4.409090909090909
7682988,3,B01CH6SA74,"While the topic is presented well, the film is only 41 minutes long (less than the 45 stated on the box). Patrick Stewart narrates about half of it; the balance is narrated by astronauts and others. These people are certainly knowledgable about their topics but lack the professional voiceover skills.

Additionally, about 20% of the film is in low-res letterboxed format, albeit with a pretty background.

I will give it kudos for an excellent use of sound mixing on takeoffs. Overall, I'd likely buy it again but that's mainly due to the lack of 4K BRD content as I write this.",1465430400,27,579,4.7227722772277225

8753000,5,B01CH6SA74,"The footage on this 4K disc is stunning. The launches especially, but also the ISS footage, make it well worth the purchase. Toward the end, it leans a bit too heavy on promoting the Ares and SLS, and rather than being a broad documentary about our ""Journey To Space"" it comes off as almost a commercial for those projects.",1523923200,,323,4.491525423728813

8753006,1,B01CH6SA74,"the 3d content is ""converted"" 3d - some of it is fair quality, but most of it is poor.  Adding insult to injury, some of the content is CGI (computer generated) which could easily have been rendered in ""native 3d"" and that would actually have looked good.  But it was converted 3d also and rather poor quality.
Don't buy this if you're into stereoscopic 3d movies.
(I didn't watch the entire movie, just hopped around a bit looking for any true stereoscopic 3d content.  I couldn't find it.  Maybe there is some in there somewhere... but I don't have the patience)
