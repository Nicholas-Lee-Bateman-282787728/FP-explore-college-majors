8308289,1,B001HADFVS,"If you don't know, Operation Foxley NEVER materialized, it was an idea they british secret service kicked around for a couple of months, submitted the idea and then it was shelved. Well that's what this movie or documentary is all about, the pointless dribble and discussions that took place. Its poorly edited with disjointed bits. Its one of those cheap movies that happens basically in one room. Even the scene of the a guy waking in the morning was shot once and they just repeated the same shot every morning. I would say spare your buck.",1393113600,3,543,4.666666666666667
8308290,5,B001HADFVS,"Of all the assassination attempts on Hitler's life, the one which could have worked was shelved by the British SOE and MI6 in 1944.  This docu-drama on that plan shows how sophisticated and resourceful the British were on actually setting the plan in motion.  Within this film a round table discussion with present day military historians bounce ideas off one another, as to the feasibility of Operation Foxley, adding another dynamic to an already spell binding movie.  A must see for any WWII buff.  I give it 5 stars.",1349568000,6,520,4.808988764044944
