I've loved Mae Marsh since the first time I saw her, in ""Intolerance"", in which she gave an amazing performance and looked so beautiful, refreshing and ""contemporary"". Ever since, I've been trying to get all of her work that was released on DVD, and, for no special reason, ""Polly of the Circus"" was the last on my list. But what a lovely surprise it turned out to be!  Even though it's not restored, the video quality is rather decent most of the time, except for a couple of scenes, but nothing extremely bad that could ruin the viewing.

The score is basically pre-recorded music obviously composed for movies of the early '30s, I think. (At some point we can hear an instrumental version of Gloria Swanson's ""Love, Your Spell Is Everywhere""), but still fits the scenes very well most of the time, though it sounds a bit dramatic in a few comical scenes. Anyway, for less than $6 you cannot expect music specifically composed for each movie, and besides, you can tell there was an effort for finding the right music, or at least adequate tunes that more or less fit every action. I should also mention that the intertitles are very nice, creative and easy to read and understand even for a non-native English speaker like me.

I highly recommend this lovely movie especially to Mae Marsh fans and to any silent movies fans. It's a bit slow at the beginning, but soon becomes very entertaining and dynamic till the very end.",1419984000,2,1470,4.599236641221374
