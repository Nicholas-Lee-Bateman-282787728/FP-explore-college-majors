4387075,5,B004IN21VQ,"I was happy to see Fighting Mad available on DVD.  This was filmed around Rogers, Arkansas in the 70's.  My grandparents owned a farm up there and are even in the movie!  Grandpa Frank Mayes is the old man who turns and looks directly at the camera during a scene, he's wearing his cowboy hat, overalls and glasses.  My grandma, Ruby Mayes is consoling Mrs Henshue on her porch.  There are deleted scenes of my Grandpa chasing Peter Fonda with a pitch fork and also being arrested, but we have those at home in our cedar chest.",1385424000,4,527,4.391752577319588
4387076,5,B004IN21VQ,This would be a great addition to any collection.  I might be prejudiced because my Father-In-Law is John Doucette. Arrived promptly at a great price.,1357084800,,150,5.0
4387077,5,B004IN21VQ,"The Dukes of Hazzard with a seriously violent twist. Peter Fonda in Fighting Mad takes on corrupt town officials using ""eminent domain"" to tear down local farms. Moving Violation is about a couple in the wrong place at the wrong time and they get pursued by crooked police officers with high speed car chases and gunshots galore! SHOCKER ending in Moving Violation. Some stars you may recognize on both movies from the 70's. If you like the Convoy, Smokey and the Bandit type movies with a seriously violent storyline, these are your movies.",1344297600,2,541,4.827956989247312
4387078,3,B004IN21VQ,"when the movie is letterbox some of the most important picture is cut off, i very much dislike letterbox dvds. thank you",1327881600,,120,4.5
4387079,5,B004IN21VQ,Moving Violation is one of my favorite car chase films from the 70s. It was a joy to see it again in a good quality print and it is recommended to anyone who likes Race With the Devil and the likes. Fighting Mad was a nice suprise and what more is it to say than if you are a fan of 70s cinema this is a good bargain. Load your gun fasten your seatbelt and enjoy the ride from a time when they drive for real.,1325462400,2,409,3.7674418604651163
4387080,4,B004IN21VQ,"This review is for Fighting Mad, since I haven't watched Moving Violation yet. Fighting Mad is a very entertaining film with a story about revenge, good script, and decent action sequences. The widescreen picture is pretty good and enhanced for 16:9 TVs.",1318809600,4,254,5.071428571428571

8430905,2,B004IN21VQ,"Part of this movie was filmed in my hometown. I'd seen this twice, but wanted a copy for myself. This is one of the worst movies to come out and is very hard to find for that reason. Now I have a copy. I could go on, but why?",1455062400,,225,3.6122448979591835
8430906,5,B004IN21VQ,The Story of a man who returns to his Arkansas roots to help his father  wage a war against a vicious strip-mining company that is trying to take they're land away and the local sheriff refuses to help. Tom Hunter (Peter Fonda) does what the sheriff won't and administers his own brand of justice. Peter Fonda has always been an audience favorite. Many of his movies are the best.,1451001600,,380,4.507246376811594
