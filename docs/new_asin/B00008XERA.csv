1865905,3,B00008XERA,"We all remember Chuck Barris as the creator of some of television's most successful - albeit notoriously mind-numbing - game shows: ""The Dating Game,"" ""The Newlywed Game,"" and ""The Gong Show.""  But did you know that he was also a hit man for the CIA?  Well, that's what he claims, straight from his own ""unauthorized autobiography"" entitled ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" which has now been made into a movie by director George Clooney and writer Charlie Kaufman.  Kaufman is known for devising elaborately absurd scenarios for his fictional films (""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Adaptation"" etc.), yet even Kaufman, in his wildest fantasies, could not have come up with a more bizarre premise than the one this real life story affords.  No wonder he was drawn to this material.  They are a perfect fit.  In the world of movies, who says fact isn't stranger than fiction?
In many ways, Barris was one of the men responsible for starting the trend towards ""reality television"" that so dominates network programming today.  His most famous hits (especially ""The Gong Show"") were all based on the premise that millions of Americans would be willing to humiliate themselves in public for a few moments of fleeting fame - and that millions more would tune in to bear witness to the spectacle.  Barris, craving fame himself, was simply savvy enough to plug into that national mood - and managed to make himself a fortune and turn himself into a household name in the process.  What most of us didn't know about Barris at the time was that, while all this was going on, he was ostensibly leading a double life as a secret agent, tracking down and killing any number of ""bad guys,"" all in the name of ""national security.""
Given the inherently incredible, jaw-dropping nature of the material, George Clooney, in his directorial debut, brings an appropriately surrealistic tone to the work.  He employs a number of visual devices that help to fragment the world in which the story takes place.  Certain scenes break through the constraints of time and space, as when Barris is talking on the phone in his apartment to an ABC executive, who is sitting in his office, and the two locations become one on the screen.  The sense of dislocation this technique creates perfectly reflects the mental split occurring in Barris' own disturbed psyche.  This style is further enhanced by the use of slightly off-kilter camera angles, color filtering and sepia tones in some of the shots.  Scenarist Charlie Kaufman, as always, brings his own quirky vision to bear on the material.  He cleverly balances the two ""sides"" of Barris' life, transitioning smoothly between those scenes revolving around his career as TV show producer and those revolving around his career as CIA operative.  Moreover, Kaufman does a nice job getting inside the head of this man who is trying to fight the demons of his own past, make a name for himself in the high stakes world of network programming, cope with his own inadequacies as a person, and come to terms with the vile things he is doing in his secret life all at the same time.
As Barris, Sam Rockwell gives a terrific, high-energy performance, capturing the sadness and paranoia of a man who seems to know deep down inside that his fame is probably undeserved, built as it is on mediocre ideas and a willingness to exploit the baser instincts of human nature.  Drew Barrymore brings her usual charm to the role of Penny, Barris' one true love and the only person genuinely drawn to Barris as a person, even though he is unable to commit himself to her fully, preferring instead to keep the relationship ""casual"" and uncommitted.  Barris finds it impossible to make a real, meaningful connection to another human being, so twisted has he become in his value system and bizarre lifestyle.  Rounding out the cast are Clooney himself, as the mysterious CIA agent who draws Barris into this strange netherworld of intrigue and danger, Rutger Hauer, as a fellow hit man who pours out his feelings about his chosen occupation to Barris, Julia Roberts, as the icy cool CIA operative who pops up at various moments and in various places to keep an eye on the young recruit, and even Brad Pitt and Matt Damon, who show up for a truly hilarious cameo appearance together, one that had the audience at the screening I attended howling with delight.
The $64,000 question becomes, of course, is this story even remotely true, or is it merely another case of this master showman's playing the public for all its worth?  I haven't the slightest idea.  The filmmakers certainly take it all very seriously, as evidenced by the fact that they have various friends and business acquaintances of Barris (Dick Clark, Jay P. Morgan) providing interviews for the film, interviews which hint at the dark possibility that the basis of the story might indeed be factual, given the kind of person these people claim Barris is.  This gives the film a kind of pseudo-documentary realism that heightens the verisimilitude of what we are seeing on screen.  Whether the film is really a true story or merely a grand lark perpetrated on an increasingly credulous audience, the fact is that ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" turns out to be a thoroughly entertaining, utterly loony piece of original filmmaking.
""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" marks an auspicious debut for Clooney as a director, who, in his work behind the camera, demonstrates a thorough command of vision and style.  One looks forward to his next endeavor.",1043366400,21,5508,4.866310160427807
1865906,5,B00008XERA,"1.  First off, Charlie Kaufman, you've done it again!  Adapatation was my #1 film of 2002 and although it's way to early to tell how this will fair for this year, I'm off to a great start with Confessions.  How much is based on truth, how much isn't?  We'll never really know, but who cares?  Sam Rockwell is truly incredible recreating the life of Chuck Barris.  Struggling to get a show to work on the air, becoming addicted to his ""contract"" position with the CIA, fearing commitment with his girlfriend.  This film was full of twists (classic Kaufman), humor, sexual visuals complementing living Barris' lifestyle, and a great beginning leading to you a wonderful ending.
2.  Cinematography - UNBELIEVABLE!!!!  Every, and I mean every, shot in this movie was like something out of a postcard!  It was truly amazed with the team of Clooney, Soderbergh, and Nigel Thomas Sigel as the director of photography.  Several different color tones were used throughout the film emphasizing the story in parts or complimenting the environment.  Various film formats were used, 35mm, 16mm, digital, Super 8....it was amazing how you really couldn't tell unless you were really paying attention to it.  But the style of photography just captivated me.  Some very good shots and very interesting setups.  For example, a transition from one scene in a bathroom that then zooms in on Rockwell's eyes...as the camera zooms out, we're in a corporate ballroom.  I researched this one take and learned it was done in one take with a rotating set.  A great trick without having to digitally edit and it came off flawlessly.  Other setups include Rockwell leaving ""his"" set and walking into the foreground of another which may have a person he is talking on the phone with.  This rids you of having to do split screens and adds a much better visual style.  It's a facsinating start for Clooney - almost too good.
3.  Acting.  What can I say, I was even impressed by Barrymore.  Rockwell is amazing throughout the film...Julia Roberts, the smart compliment to Rockwell, and Clooney was great and surprisingly didn't even steal any scenes from Rockwell.  Oh, don't forget to watch out for the hilarious cameos from Brad Pitt and Matt Damon!
This film was wonderful!  A must see especially if you liked Kaufman and want to see something a little different....this is probably the only memorable movie for January aside from Chicago going into wide release.",1043366400,5,2435,4.894865525672372
1865907,2,B00008XERA,"A project that had been through many incarnations before George got involved and attempted the seemingly impossible...should have remained on the shelf. Now I know why investors had previously walked away from this project...too much hype, too little film.",1043366400,4,256,5.589743589743589
1865908,5,B00008XERA,"Close on the heels of his ADAPTATION, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman scores again with CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND, based on the (fictional?) autobiography of the same title by Chuck Barris. It's also George Clooney's initial outing as Director.
At the very beginning when the audience sees a bearded and naked Chuck Barris (Sam Rockwell) standing as if in a trance while a frumpy housekeeper vacuums around him, the viewer suspects that the film will be something special, outrageous, or both. This is the starting point for an extended flashback as Barris recalls his young adulthood, when it seemed everybody but him was having sex, to his successful career as a TV game show creator and low-brow polluter of the American airwaves (""The Dating Game"", ""The Newlywed Game"", ""The Gong Show""). Pretty standard stuff except that along the way Barris is seduced by a penchant for violence into a double life as a CIA contract killer, and the schizophrenia brought on by his double life almost proves his undoing.
Rockwell is superb in the leading role, as is Director Clooney, who plays his square-jawed, no-nonsense CIA recruiter and control, Jim Byrd. (Byrd to Barris: ""Listen, you're thirty-two years old and you've achieved nothing. Jesus Christ was dead and alive again by thirty-three. Better get cracking."") Drew Barrymore does a swell job as Penny, the on-again, off-again love of Chuck's life, but she's deliciously upstaged by Julia Roberts in a new sort of character for her, that of the seductive and deadly femme fatale spy, Patricia. (""Prove how much you love me, baby. Kill for me. Then I'm all yours"".) Brad Pitt and Matt Damon have hilarious two-second cameos on stools. And there's one scene where a Federal official lectures The Dating Game contestants on the dire repercussions of introducing risqu&eacute; material into their game show appearance that alone is worth the price of admission. I don't know who that actor was, but he deserves an Oscar for a one-minute speech.
This is a movie that perhaps has to be seen twice to be fully appreciated for the deft and clever use of camera perspective, scene and timing changes, and almost-overexposed color, all of which keeps the audience on its toes wondering what's coming next. And the Big Question: who's The Mole?
This is one of the best dark comedies that I've seen in a long while. It's one of the must-see films of 2002/2003. Bravo, bravo!",1040515200,87,2415,4.965432098765432

But say it is, and thats not out of the question since the ""Galloping Gourmet"" Julia Child, was actually a spy as well as a cooking show icon, this movie did a good job.  The Cold War was only a few years ago, and too many people think it is totally over with big red buttons being pressed at press conferences after elections that were not the best for the country as we are finding out.  Stories like this are very interesting, need to be told, and for the reason of the average person being too dim to know or care about this important part of history.  Im an amateur historian, mostly WW2(involving the cold war as well obviously), and I'd never heard a thing about this.

It is played tongue-in-cheek, but the silliness factor gets pretty high at times.

1865974,5,B00008XERA,"As I was watching this expecting not too much and a bit distracted I was wondering vaguely how this managed to get such a good cast. Surprisingly the movie surprised. This a fine example of the hit man genre infused with comedy. Yes, they made yet another hit man movieI mean lets glorify the poor bastguys. So, so Hollywood. I actually Googled hit man movies and I was surprised at how many there have been. Ive seen maybe a half dozen, and if I feel like making the effort Ill look them up and make a list.

But this movie creates another genre: the hit man comedy. Leon: The Professional (1994) and Panic (2000) gave us the hit man we can identify with and empathize with while experiencing a little satirical intent along the way. But this expands the possibilities. I mean the hit man is Chuck Barris (oh, boy) of The Gong Show fame and infamy played by Sam Rockwell as the heroic flawed hero. (Story based on Barriss own book. Ha!) And how did the director get such a great cast? I mean George Clooney, Drew Barrymore, Julia Roberts and Sam Rockwell. Answer: George Clooney directed a script by Charlie Kaufman. Yes, Clooney was the director and did an outstanding job; and yes, Charlie Kaufman is the author of screenplays for such cutting edge and entirely original films as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Being John Malkovich (1999).

So yes I would be persuaded to take a role and not worry about the box office. BTW there are some interesting cameos including Brad Pitt and Matt Damon as The Dating Game contestants. They appear almost as sight jokes.

I grew up with the shows he produced! First time a movie made me want to read the book-it's usually the other way round.  Surprise cameos who didn't even have one line. Won't tell you who so you can be surprised too.  Well-turned performances by all the stars.
Favorite scenes: when 7 Americans were traded for one Russian spy & when Chuck tells Penny he's a hitman for the CIA. Supremely entertaining, though I had to fast forward through many sex scenes. Was Chuck Barris really such a slut? Or is that just how he tells it.",1472774400,,688,4.310077519379845

Confessions of a Dangerous Mind really doesnt get us any closer to a fact or fiction determination on that score, but it is a pretty cool flick. You get taken into his double life of sorts with this beautiful cinematography with the contrast of lights and darks depending on where he is. It really helps to create this image of a man of two lives who steadily becomes darker and more forbidding even in happy times.

Coupled with an A level cast who seemed to make the story leap off the screen. One may not get any closer to a truth, but Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is a very enjoyable almost two hour thrill ride that won't leave movie goers bored or disinterested.",1461369600,,788,4.397260273972603

Other reviewers made worthwhile comments about the over-the-top approach reflecting the over-the-top nature of the idea that CB served as an assassin etc etc, and those comments are probably on the mark.

The fact that it's based on some incredible facts (not literally factual, like a documentary would be) helps it to go down a little more smoothly.

If not, I think you'll find it too quirky.  Perfectly acted and just a work of genius, I think this is one of the best 10 movies in the last 30 years.

If you're on the fence about watching it, and you decide not to watch it, take a big spoiler and do an internet search for ""confessions of a dangerous mind coffee cup"" and watch the scene.  He's a spy and looking for a ""mole"", an inside counter spy whose been killing the other spies throughout the whole movie.  The mole finally meets up with him at the end of this scene.

If you don't agree with my analysis above after watching that scene, don't watch the movie, you won't like it.  Don't watch the scene if you think you want to watch the whole movie as it's a big spoiler.  But if you were going to ditch it, it will definitely change your mind.

I enjoyed this movie, sometimes more than others. Sam Rockewell does an excellent job with Chuck Barris character as does Drew Barrymore in her role as Penny. Clooney is also in the film as a CIA man who recruits Barris as an assassin for the Agency. Later, as Barris' TV shows get network distribution, Barris decides to continue his CIA assassin role, up until the point that he basically has a mental break. The movie is alternatively comedic and dark. It's well acted and Clooney's directorial debut is impressive, if not epic. I especially enjoyed the cameos by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon as Batchlors ! & 2. Good flick and worth your time.

I have always kind of liked Rutger Hauer, but I like him better after what is almost a cameo (very brief). George Clooney's character was understated but very appropriate - same for Julia Roberts. If you like Drew Barrymore in some films but not others, you would like her in this one. My wife dislikes most of what I watch (action & adventure, righteous revenge, medieval, etc.). Not from the U.S., she too was engaged with the drama and story. Not a ramped-up foreign espionage film but a character study with some of that in it.

It was the only movie I ever saw besides Young Frankenstein where I can recall laughing to bust my gut!  But, unlike the Mel Brooks film, I found that I was the only one in the whole theater who was laughing.  And it really did not matter.  The film could not have been better crafted, better scripted, more paradoxical and ironic and cynical and honest and uncannily true to the times I lived through.  I do not recall ever having sat through 5 minutes of any of Barris' shows, which were trivial forms of entertainment.  Being of the sixties, being relevant was the watchword of many 'intellectuals'.  But I suppose I took things too seriously to see the humor in Barris' mayhem.  The sixties were a time when everything was questioned and here was this guy questioning in his own way through his anger, yet so fragile and needy, while so completely unbelieving and untrusting.  After trivializing everything, could he really invest himself into any institution sincerely.  I get that other people don't get this film.  But it is as rich and odd and real as life itself... so absolutely bizarre that it can only be the truth.  And it can be the truth, yet never have happened because it reflects life so accurately.  The film Quiz Show comes to mind as a parallel to this film, although Redford tried for a classic tragedy and this is a comic tragedy, using very similar material.

There is profanity and a little spy action and sex for those who use those things as a measure of a great movie. ;-)  It is interesting that he may have been a CIA agent.

1866288,5,B00008XERA,"Hilarious.

I'm surprised that I've never seen this film until today, especially given the fact that I really like Sam Rockwell in particular.  And, even though I almost hate to admit it, I used to watch ""The Gong Show,"" ""The Dating Game,"" and ""The Newlywed Game"" when I was a kid.  I didn't know until watching this film, however, that Chuck Barris was the creator of all of those shows.  I just thought that he was a game show host, and I only new about his connection with the first in that list.

But while I used the word ""hilarious"" to begin the review, this film is really almost three films in one:  you have the first act which is a comedy.  But the second act is almost a thriller, where you find out that Mr. Barris was a CIA operative.  But then the third act almost becomes a tragedy, although I won't say whether or not there is a happy ending.  You'd have to ask Mr. Barris himself, and you'll have to watch the film yourself to find out, which I highly recommend.

The cast is excellent of course.  I really don't even need to say anything more about that, so I won't.

I guess this film did poorly at the box office, and that is surely too bad.  It is so much better than 99 percent of what comes out of Hollywood.  Even though the films are different genres, I would say that ""Quiz Show"" and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" might be a good twin bill in one night; Robert Redford directed the former while George Clooney directed the latter.  Both are surely excellent films in their own right, and it's too bad that you don't see more films made that are as good as these.

What's the theme?  Well, perhaps ""Truth is stranger than fiction,"" and Mr. Barris was and still is surely a strange guy.  And his story -- assuming that it is all true -- is even stranger.  But Mr. Clooney did a great job in adapting this to the screen, so much so that I put the books on my Wish List.  After all, I'm intrigued to get the story straight from the horse's mouth.",1371945600,,1972,4.25

1866295,4,B00008XERA,"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is the directorial debut of George Clooney, based on a screenplay by Charlie Kaufman.  Supposedly there was a lack of communication between the two, which led to dissatisfaction on Kaufman's part.  Well, at least according to Wikipedia, but that website is often only slightly more accurate in its adherence to reality than Chuck Barris was in his autobiography of the same name. (Was Barris really a CIA hitman who murdered 33 people? Probably not, but who the heck knows?) Whatever the case, the final script is very good.  As far as the direction, Clooney is amazing.  It's astonishing that this was his first time behind the camera, because he totally knocked it out of the park.

The cast of Confessions of a Dangerous Mind are all superb.  Heading up the film is Sam Rockwell, who does eerily stunning work capturing the persona & mannerisms of Chuck Barris.  He portrays Barris as a veritable con artist, a self-involved, womanizing egotist who eventually descends into paranoia, isolation, and madness.  It's an amazing performance.  Based on this, I'm genuinely surprised that Rockwell isn't a bigger name.  But, of course, in Hollywood talent and fame don't often align with the frequency that they should.

The rest of the cast is also noteworthy.  Drew Barrymore plays Penny, the long suffering girlfriend of Barris who puts up with his constant lies & cheating.  Clooney himself plays Jim Byrd, the icy CIA agent who recruits Barris.  Julia Roberts portrays Patricia, a seductive spy who serves as Barris' contact in the field.  Now, I am generally not a fan of Roberts' work.  However, watching her here, I was actually impressed.  It was interesting to see her in a darker, more cynical role than she usually plays.  She certainly did fine work with it.  Rounding out the cast is the amazing, underrated Rutger Hauer.  His character Keeler is a philosophizing veteran hitman who befriends Barris.  It's always a pleasure to see Hauer on the screen.  Even when cast in a relatively small supporting role such as this, he gives it his all, turning in a charismatic performance.

At first, I was genuinely surprised to learn that Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was a box office bomb.  I thought it was an amazing film, and so did my girlfriend.  But reflecting on it, I quickly realized that the movie is not easily classifiable.  It starts off as a comedy, but then transitions into a dark, disturbing look at a rather unlikable man living a double life who gradually experiences a mental breakdown.  Is it supposed to be humorous or somber?  Well, both.  But I think that for many viewers, who like to compartmentalize their entertainment into comfortable, easily absorbed categories, a film such as Confessions of a Dangerous Mind can be a turn off, as it straddles so many genres.

I definitely recommend giving this movie a try.  It really is an amazing film.  Myself, I'm looking forward to watching it again.",1358035200,3,2960,4.893360160965795

This is a marvelous film for first time Director George Clooney and an amazing performance at that for Sam Rockwell who plays the role of Chuck Barris himself.  The film lacks in narrative as the common thread through the film is that fine line of reality and what Chuck Barris perceives as his reality.  Recreating Chuck Barris' biography and interlaced with interviews from the people that knew Chuck Barris, we are given a possible tale that is often contradicted by the people that knew him.  Was Chuck Barris a member of the C.I.A. and how many people did Chuck Barris kill, we are left to decide from what is real and delusion.

  The transfer to Blu-Ray is astoundingly true to the source material. Everything in the film looks amazing up on the big screen and on your home HDTV.  The audio is clean and crisp and shows nice levels for any 5.1 setup.  Plenty of extras to keep you entertained after the film.

1866306,4,B00008XERA,"As with any film biography or autobiography, one can disregard the reality factor, as most screen writers and directors do, and enjoy (or loathe) a film for what is on the screen not what is in the book, very certainly not what reality testing might reveal  or mask). Given this outlook of mine, which was shared by Fred Astaire, for example, I take it that a writer named Chuck Barris, emulated such stellar humorists as Robert Benchley and Goodman Ace, by creating a character he chose to call Chuck Barris. He then defined this character so as to be most appealing (as he saw it) to the audience he was seeking to gratify. In turn movie makers, such as the screenwriter, actors,and, here more importantly,the, director, of a film to be, took the book and sought to use it as a framework for a picture which they wrote, directed and produced so as to meet their conception of a movie which would gratify their hoped-for audience. Never mind what the writer Chuck Barris was, or sought to be seen as being, never mind what the book seemed to be saying and what it did say. What was shown on the screen of a movie house or TV set was all that mattered; how many people would come to see the screening, and what they would say to the people they knew, was the only crucial concern.
What would I say about this film. It is a phantasmagorical construction for today, of, for example, what Clifford Odets sought to achieve for the Hollywood of yesterday, with bitterness and cynicism. Following great success with popular trivia on television, a man finds life empty of meaning.....but, oh, by the way, he was also a killer for the CIA. Fantasy within fantasy within fantasy within ....... Never having had the stomach to watch the shows in question when they appeared on TV, and having nothing but the vaguest memory of something happening with Chuck Barris, I was able to treat only what was on the screen.  On the whole, I believe there was some fine acting, some difficulty in handling the fantasy of murder, some confusion in handling the plot line with all its self-contradictory elements. Over-all, it is probably a film many will be intrigued by, if only to see how it all ends.",1319932800,,2182,4.578005115089514

He was also, according to his autobiography of the same name, a government hitman.  The movie is different, fun, with great cinematography and a wonderful, dead-on performance by Sam Rockwell.

The kicker here is Barris's claim that throughout his entire career he moonlighted as a CIA assassin. As a result, Confessions plays out as half biographical drama and half spy thriller, also tracking the purported killer from initial recruitment to lethal climax. Berry tells an incredible story, and this movie actually made me interested in this quasi-celebrity's life. He's certainly an intriguing man, and the way this movie is put together is very good. A tribute to of one of television's dark geniuses.",1267574400,,656,5.140186915887851
1866312,4,B00008XERA,"Chuck Barris says in his book of this name that, while creating the Dating Game and hosting the Gong Show in the 1960s and 1970s, he was also a CIA assasin. He ran around Europe, his story goes, killing commie agents, going from East to West Berlin, playing all kinds of nasty  games that would make  Suzie the 1969 prom queen blush.

This is what Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind is about, and George Cloney directed this, using Sam Rockwell to play Barris.

What makes the movie work is that it dramatizes tells Barris' story as if it were true. The film does not concern itself about what is real and what is fiction. By showing it as Barris tells it, it becomes plauseable.

And Cloney directs as an artist preforming a labor of love, not a star who ""now gets behind the camara."" His choice of Sam Rockwell, a brilliant charactor actor, is a brilliant move. By not chosing a big name, Cloney let's you focus on the story and not on the star playing Barris. He also makes great choices, such as grounding this firmly in time and place. It is not an action moive, but  smart film for smart people interested in a very specific era and mileu.

Rockwell really does not look like Barris, but plays himself in the situations Barris describes, and this allows the story to drive the film. Rockwell is a Barris we can buy because he tells the tale so well.

Cloney, Julia Robert's and Drew Barrymoore are also here, but just happen to be big name actors in a great little project. If any of the three wanted a star vehicle, this is not it. But that is great; keeping Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind a small film only adds to the mistique.

If you  belive it, it is amazing. If you can't, so what: it is still a great story.

Sam Rockwell does a great job as Chuck Barris and Drew Barrymore is a sweet, pathetic Penny Pachino which makes the love story of the film work on a basic level. Unfortunately the espionage elements which made up the majority of the book are glossed over in favor of artistic fluff.

Barris' friendship with Jim Byrd is cut away to merely boss and employee, while Patricia's eventual fate is meaningless b/c she is shown as a brief sexual fling with no susbtance.  It's too bad they wasted Julia Roberts in this part, that was the best part of the book.

1866317,3,B00008XERA,"To my surprise, most of the critics who praised the film were correct. It's an excellent `little' film that stays within its bounds, exhibits relentless energy & creativity by director GC  (whose career grows more & more admirable with each project), & provides a devastating portrait of a profoundly sad & depressed little man- not a delusional 1. CB had it all, & then gave up. Still, he's a multi-millionaire who's lived in France the last 20 years, so 1 wonders why he is so put off by something as ephemeral as a `reputation'?
  As for the film, it is ostensibly told in flashbacks as CB pens the book in the early 1980s.... There are also plenty of funny scenes, where a chubby bachelor wins a date over 2 studly bachelors played by GC pals Brad Pitt & Matt Damon, & where another bachelor CB escorts to Europe turns out to be a KGB spy who is exchanged for CB after he is captured in East Berlin. In the end, though, the film succeeds on the chances taken by GC- from casting the little known Sam Rockwell as CB, to all the little filmic tricks described above, to ending the film on a very odd note- a pan & scan of the aged CB's visage. The most quoted passage in the film, & the book it came from, is `My name is Charles Hirsch Barris. I have written pop songs, I have been a television producer. I am responsible for polluting the airwaves with mind-numbing puerile entertainment. In addition, I have murdered 33 human beings.' Too many critics focused on the veracity of the last sentence, while ignoring the import of the 1st 3- which truly are at the heart of this film.

The lead character, Chuck Berris (Sam Rockwell) - real life creator of The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game and The Gong Show - is thoroughly unlikeable and yet, I still wanted to watch.

Clooney's directorial debut is a huge success in my opinion, I was drawn in within 5 minutes and couldn't stop asking myself ""could this really have happened?  Is this true?""  Then I started asking if Berris was merely delusional and felt this to be the case when the prisoner exchange occurred (I don't want to be a spoiler by citing the details). The film just kept me guessing from start to finish and that means the director, cast and writer all did their work very well.  Clooney probably learned a lot from his work with the Cohen Brothers.

Every time I see Drew Barrymore, I fall in love with her all over again.  She's always perfect as that funny, intelligent, naive, vulnerable type of woman and she pulls it off beautifully here.

Even his recruitment is a scene that makes me laugh; like anyone would just walk up to you and offer you a job as an assassin.

Sam Rockwell does a fine job here, but he's easily upstaged by the two women in his life, long time girlfriend Penny (Barrymore) and fellow assassin Patricia (Roberts).

Now Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. Like those other two movies, we have a character who throws his whole life away to become a glittery celebrity. As such, Chuck Barris creates such abominations as Dating Game, Newlywed Game, The Gong Show. His TV ideas we learn are born out of his disgust for the human race: its need to be seen on TV even in a foolish light; its love of money even if it means selling out your spouse. In addition to seeing Barris' inner mind work as he creates these popular programs, we see his parallel life--mostly delusional we are to assume--of his job in the CIA, complete with killing 33 people. We assume this delusion is designed to make him feel important.

The directing is fantastic, but what really makes the story perfect is its writing.  Charlie Kaufman, here taking a step towards more mainstream, is one of the most talented writers Hollywood has ever seen.  With credits like Adaptation, Being John Malkovich, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, his offbeat, bizarre, and incredibly original material is always a surprise.  Even though this film is a bit more mainstream (many bizarre Hollywood filmmakers are stepping towards mainstream, such as David Cronenberg this year), Kaufman makes himself known in a few of the more wild scenes.  Sam Rockwell's acting is probably the best of his career, and Drew Barrymore pulls off the dumb personality very well.  The best acting, however, comes from Clooney himself as a CIA agent.  His description of Chuck's past in relation to the ""profile"" is some of the best acting I have ever seen.  This is very surprising, since it is very hard for directors to direct the film and still be able to pull of great performances, but George Clooney seems to be able to handle both very well.  Many filmmakers are sort of reverting to the ""true"" stories, with especial emphasis on the quotation marks.  Along with Confessions, Tony Scott has made the ""true"" story of Domino Harvey and Stephen Spielberg has made the ""true"" story of the aftermath of the Munich Olympics.

1866330,4,B00008XERA,"The sixties and seventies were turbulent times in America: Cuba had fallen to a communist revolution, a Hungarian rebellion had been crushed by Soviet tanks, and the Cold War was at its coldest. The CIA made a desperate gambit, eager to secure a master assassin who would fly under the radar and raise absolutely no suspicicion.

They decided to recruit game-show host Chuck Barris as their Ice Man.

George Clooney marks his directorial debut with a subtle, fast-paced, fancifully shot and whimsically paced bang. Sam Rockwell does a masterful job in portraying reluctant CIA killer and grandmaster game-show host Chuck Barris.

You remember Chuck Barris, right? High-toned, high spirited, pedal-to-the-metal host and writer and developer and uber-brain behind some of American television's most mind-rotting game shows, including ""The Newlywed Game"", ""The Dating Game"", and ""The Gong Show"". Oh, and according to his autobiographical ""unauthorized"" biography, a CIA assassin.

CIA Assassin?

Absolutely. According to Barris, while he was concocting runaway hits like ""The Gong Show"", he was serving his country and working with the fight to make the World Safe for Democracy by offing Russian agents and KGB lackeys. ""Dating Game"" super-sexy trip to West Berlin? Nonsense---it just provided Special Agent Chuck with the opportunity to play a Cold War version of 'whack-a-mole', literally and figuratively.

Clooney has solid directorial chops, and moves the film rapidly from the playful realm of whimsy, where characters are illuminated and shaded by filters and too much lighting, to the cold, grey world of Barris's nightmarish reality, where, as an aging, isolated CIA spook and killer, he's being stalked by operatives, assassins and thugs. Clooney is good in using music, set design, and dialogue to steer the film from the realm of comedy to stark terror in a matter of minutes.

In addition to being masterfully shot and scripted (with cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel, who did the camera work for both X-men movies and ""Apt Pupil""), Clooney is adept in moving what begins as a nearly slapstick comedy into a taut, horrific little spy-game where Barris literally fights for his life.

""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" is studded with first-rate actors and first-rate acting: Drew Barrymore plays Penny, Chuck's starry-eyed and long-suffering lover; Julia Roberts shines as mysteriuos secret agent Patricia, who reinvents the term ""Man-eater""; Rutger Hauer brings the lustre of ""Blade Runner"" to his role as a West German assassin and spymaster; and Matt Damon and Brad Pitt are note-perfect as spurned bachelors on ""The Dating Game"". And best of all, the 'mockumentary' feel of ""Confessions"" is accentuated by candid appearances from Dick Clarke, Jaye P. Morgan, and even Chuck Barris himself, who provides a grim coda to the festivities.

Clooney is also superb as Barris's CIA handler, and serves as a perfect accent to this psychedelic Cold War chess game. And make no mistake: ""Confessions"" is hysterically funny, even as this most dangerous game becomes increasingly serious and deadly.

""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" is a stellar, wickedly and consumptively absorbing debut by Clooney, and it's a fine tale well told. True story? Shaggy dog story? With this much style, who cares? Pop this on the DVD hopper, watch out for that guy down the hall in the trenchcoat, and enjoy.

1866331,5,B00008XERA,"Charlie Kauffman, who wrote the interesting and different ""Adaptation"", finally comes full circle with a consistently good movie. ""Adaptation"" was very different, very interesting, and in the second half, very violent. The violence in that movie brought it down from great movie to really good movie. The change from comedy to thriller was way too abrupt, and I found myself wondering if they were allowed to show a naked one toothed guy running after Nicolas Cage. But ""Adaptation"" isn't the movie that I'm reviewing. ""Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind"" was released late January 2003, among other great movies like ""Chicago"" and the little known but very sad ""Evelyn"", and such crappy movies like ""Darkness Falls""(yes, I know it falls, but I still saw your damn movie!), and the best Ashton Kutcher movie ever ""Just Married"" (I'm not kidding, by Kutcher standards ((known to be as Kushy)) that movie was a masterpiece). Therefore, teen audiences and even some lame brained adults missed this movie. I was one of those people (not because of the bad movies though!), but I did happen to catch this on video one night. I guess catch isn't the right word, since I consciously rented it, put it in, pressed play, and then watched it, but still...I at first did not know what to make of the movie, mostly because it couldn't decide on a genre. Biography, action, thriller, comedy, drama, morality tale, musical? Fortunately the movie carries all these genres under its rather heavy handed task of delivering a two-sided story. And that's where this movie falters. In delivering a rather profound and interesting action-comedy-drama, writer Charlie Kauffman and director George Clooney fail to present both sides of the story. It only shows how the plot benefits Chuck Barris (Sam Rockwell), not how it harmed others or hurt his wife or friends. Kauffman progressively heightens the tone of the film, darkening it ever so lightly scene by scene, like an artist painting over his picture of a green country with blue, then brown, then black. When the last act arrives, we immediately see how we got there, what led to that, how it was established before that, and more, on and on. The movie represents more a soap-opera than anything else. Actors overact in a campy and fun way, and the violence, what there is of it, is surreal and fairly comical even. The movie is the equivalent of a bad acid trip. Not that the movie itself is bad, but because it all has the look of a '70's era ""Don't Do Weed, Don't Have Sex"" propaganda film that are probably still shown in schools to this day.

Sam Rockwell, slightly underused talent overall (he has a great range), plays real-life game show host and purported CIA operative/assassin, Chuck Barris.

  As a movie in film history, one can see its embrace of the independent film genre and film noir. Cinematography and dialogue with a brilliant story and character make this movie an instant classic.

  One might not see how it can be so good. After reading multiple books of Nabokov prior to watching the film, I think I can appreciate it more. Unfortunately just reading random books of his will not do the trick.

  A ridiculous amount of parallels can be found between Confessions and one of Nabokov's most veteran works, Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle.

  Both are autobiographies (Nabokov's is fictional of course), both have the same general tense, dark, intellectual mood, and most importantly both refer to creating something new (TV shows in this movie and books in Ada or Ardor) as child rearing. I am sure there are more but these are all I can remember besides direct quotes and references to Nabokov.

1866341,3,B00008XERA,"George Clooney can file this one under wasted opportunity.  Good idea, poor execution.
Based on the semi-autobiographical book of the same name, ""Confessions"" follows the life of wacky television producer Chuck Barris.  We have Barris to thank for television programmes such as The Gong Show and The Dating Game (i.e. lowest common denominator television that proves that you should never underestimate the taste of the American public).  But, at least according to Barris, not only was he an oddball television guy, he was also a CIA assassin who killed enemies of the state for the US government.
Hmmmmm.  Well it is certainly an outrageous claim and therein lies the seeds of a good movie.  Whether or not Barris' claims of a secret life are actually true doesn't really matter for the story.  Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't, maybe he was mad (think A Beautiful Mind), maybe he was making it up - who knows.  But who really cares either.  What you have here is GOOD MATERIAL and a good opportunity to make a genuinely original movie.  Unfortunately, on his directorial debut, Clooney doesn't pull it all together and what we are left with is a rather forgettable film.
A lot of the problem is the uneven pace of the film.  Clooney spends too long trying to have us understand why Bariss is the way he is (a self-involved idiot whose personal relationships are as shallow as his television programmes).  And then when we get to the GOOD MATERIAL (the television shows and the covert operations) the pace is too quick.  Instead of focusing on what could have made this interesting he focuses on the familiar and the tedious.  Is it any real surprise that a television producer is sleazy, drunk and shallow?
The casting is interesting but perhaps what you might expect from Clooney.  Julia Roberts plays a spy (doesn't quite work), Drew Barrimore plays the long suffering love interest (does work), Clooney plays the CIA handler (unemotional and wooden) and Sam Rockwell plays Barris himself (believable idiot).  I'm also sure I saw a cameo from a non-speaking Brad Pitt as a contestant in The Dating Game.

The performances are top-notch, the plot quite interesting, and the movie is visually quite interesting.  But none of the elements work like this one underlying question:

Does ANY of this have any merit?  This is truly where the movie succeeds.

As none of the claims in the book about Barris were substantiated, neither were they disproved.  The first thing that comes to your mind is ""Who in their right mind is gonna believe this guy worked for the CIA?!!!!!!""  And if the CIA stooped to recruiting the likes of Chuck Barris, no wonder they have such a problem with credibility!!!!

1866343,4,B00008XERA,"I didn't care much for this movie when I first saw it in the theater, but I knew I would need to rewatch it, review my first impression, when it came to video (I also saw it in a theater that didn't seem to have a wide enough screen to show the complete frame -- and this film has a great deal of the action on the very edge of the screen).  And to be honest, I didn't want to take seriously a movie directed by George Clooney (though I didn't have anything personally against him, and liked several movies he's been in) -- yet I also knew the film should be given some credibility for having a Charlie Kaufman screenplay.
It's a movie that grows on you and improves with each viewing.  It's an honest look at a life that can only be evaluated through an incredible lie, and requires that the lie be given equal weight with the biographical sections of the story.  Contradiction?  That's what art and storytelling are all about.
Much of the movie takes on the appearance a colorized black and white movie, using subdued pastel colors as one of the disjointing elements in the film, the color appearing to have faded by the passage of time (the espionage sections are almost black and white, much of the time looking very film noir).  Other disjointing elements are the faces shown on extreme edges of the film and long silent shots of  the Sam Rockwell's character of Chuck Barris partially off the screen, usually when the character has been thrown out of sync by an event in the film. Though we are watching a movie about one of the great American success stories, it becomes apparent by the disjointed form taken and specific content selected that we are witnessing a life that never quite gelled, a life that was stuck in a cynical outlook of human beings and their institutions and became complacent in never becoming too comfortable with other people and what motivated them, always finding a way to expose everyone's self-interest, particularly self-interest grotesque enough to keep our attention.  And it was executing this work, the work of exposing our moral and intellectual inadequacies, that made Chuck Barris who he really was.  This is emphasized by allowing the most colorful sections in the movie to be during the scenes showing the taping of ""The Gong Show"", as well as the scenes  showing the taping of ""The Dating Game"" (after it was picked up for daytime TV) and during the auditions that lead up to ""The Gong Show"".
As ""American Psycho"" used serial killing as a metaphor for the business of Wall Street financiers, ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" uses the political assassin as the metaphor for television producer, and how specifically Chuck Barris used people in creating his shows, as well as how he used people in his personal life.  There are too many clues in the movie not to accept assassination as a metaphor (I'll admit Chuck Barris's book was more convincing, though not ultimately convincing).  And I don't want to ruin the fun of finding the clues by pointing them out.  But it's important to note that the ""hit man"" (maker of ""hit"" TV shows) was a political assassin, hired and trained by the U. S. Government, and not a hit man for organized crime, since what Chuck Barris did was nothing but live the all-American success story.  It was:  give the people what they want and reap the rewards.  What could be more American?  And even altruistic -- bringing joy and laughter to millions -- reverberated in the repeated use of the song ""If I Had a Hammer"".
And what makes the story of Chuck Barris so interesting -- a man who appears to have done nothing since the 1970s but write a creative autobiography -- is how timely the story is.  Chuck Barris may not be in operation, but the assassins are still with us:  bigger and more powerful assassins, more ubiquitous than ever.  Our sensibilities are constantly being subjected to a barrage of ""loathsome views of humanity"", though we call it ""reality TV"" and not game shows:  a change in semantics which affords several more forums where can see mocked ""some poor lonely people who are just craving a little attention in their lives"" and ""destroy them"".  In our day and age Chuck Barris would be a mere lightweight in this arena, for we a have a darker, more ""insidious, despicable force"" currently controlling our airwaves.  In comparison he might have really given us shows that brought joy and laughter.  At least he was more original.  To see so much trash on, redundant trash --  bad ideas spawned from other bad ideas --, night after night and then to see some pretty decent shows, like ""Wonderfalls"" and ""Firefly"", canceled to make room for more garbage . . . it is pure frustration for a media junkie, like myself.
George Clooney has given us a really good film: ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"".  If he never directs another movie -- I'm not sure if he has, is, or plans to direct another --, sort of like Charles Laughton's ""Night of the Hunter"", time will show that this one film was a real success.",1084492800,,4998,4.63193657984145
1866344,5,B00008XERA,"Nearly a year and a half after seeing this film the day it opened in theaters, I am still scatching my head at why it wasn't a big hit.  While I can see it not necessarily being deemed worth of an Oscar in the Academy's eyes, it's still one of the most entertaining, bizarre, and ultimately satsifying films I've seen in quite some time.  Furthermore, it was, in my honest opinion, the best picture of 2002.
I suppose a lot of people just didn't get this film.  True, the thought of a gameshow pioneer such as the great Chuck Barris moonlighting as CIA assasin seems absolutely ridiculous. So that right there may have turned some people away.  Then there are those who just don't think a movie about the life of Barris, be it fact or fiction, would be that entertaining.
Whether the stuff about the CIA is true or not is neither here nor there.  If Barris was in fact a CIA hitman, that is quite shocking and amazing...Hey- you never know!  If he did in fact make the whole thing up, I think that's equally shocking and amazing and further proves just how insanely talented Barris is (as good as this film is, the book is even 100 times better!).
In the  hands of excellent first-time director George Clooney, Barris' ""unauthorized autobiography"" is a film which greatly mixes various cinematic styles and genres.  There is plenty in the plot to keep most interested, whether its Barris' gory escapades with the agency, or his rise and fall in Hollywood.
Clooney has no problem ""borrowing"" techniques of great directors he's worked with in the past like Joel & Ethan Coen and Steven Soderbergh.  He manages, though, to put his own stamp on certain scenes.  While many scenes stand out, there is a great montage towards the end of the film where Barris' paranoia is spiraling out of control and he begins to suffer a breakdown on the set of ""The Gong Show.""  In this one scene alone, which is spooky and hilarious at the same time, Clooney proves himself as an excellent director.
Sam Rockwell is absolutely perfect as Barris, capturing the range of emotions he goes through on his thirty year rollercoaster ride in Hollywood.  Together with Clooney's direction, Rockwell paints a sympathetic portrait of a paranoid, womanizing loner who struggled with his eventual fame.
Strong support comes from Drew Barrymore as Penny, Barris' long suffering girlfriend and Julia Roberts as a sultry Mata Hari-esque spy.
Onca again, whether half of this movie is true or not is of no consequence.  This is an amazing film requires repeated viewing.",1081209600,2,2535,4.734090909090909
1866345,2,B00008XERA,"Being a fan of Chick Barris' highly entertaining and bizarre autobiography, I had high hopes for the big screen incarnation. Unfortunately George Clooney's film rightfully deserves to be gonged!
The main problem seems to lie with the way the book was adapted to screen, although most other reviewers would have you believe Charlie Kaufman can walk on water, the script takes a lively and humorous story and turns it into a depressing and totally unfunny campy joke. While Barris' account of his career and success in television makes it to screen as it is written in the book, everything Barris wrote about his involvement with the CIA has being dramatically altered in the movie version and come across like a camp spy B-movie.
In his book Barris claims to have answered a newspaper add for ""College Graduates: Free to Travel"" and lied his way through an interview with a CIA recruiter, after which being sent on months and months of boring surveillance assignments before being taken to watch a hit and then sent out to perform them on his own. In the film however CIA agent Jim Byrd simply walks up to Barris on the street and tells him that he's being watching him and he fits ""the profile""?! and asks him to be a CIA hitman on the spot? Ridiculous! It gets worse as we are treated to some of the most campy spy movie 'training' scenes since the ninja school in ""You Only Live Twice"". Not a single mission or encounter during his alleged CIA career makes it to the screen even close to the way it was written. Sure you expect a movie to stray a little from the source material, but when they made the effort to portray the tv career side of the story to the letter but rewrote the CIA exploits to the point that they don't even resemble the book is unforgivable.
The movie also cowardly dodges some highly ethical issues such as assignments which had Barris infiltrate and report back on the activities of civil rights groups. Adding to the problems they have changed the Patrica character from someone Barris knew for years even before she joined the CIA to a comic strip femme fatal he meets on a mission. His elimination of her when she is revealed to be the mole has being completely changed for the movie making the books gritty and surprising climax to his CIA career appear onscreen like the season finale of a cheesy soap opera.
Script problems aside, the film is gorgeous to look at and certainly captures the feeling of the book. There is some creative visuals and great editing. Acting is great with Sam Rockwell playing Chuck Barris with amazing realism, Drew Barrymore is perfectly cast as Penny Pacino nailing the tortured girlfriend character, Clooney isn't dazzling but tolerable and Rutger Hauer is superb in the role of Keeler. The only weak performance is Julia Roberts as Patricia Watson, she seems determined to prove once and for all just how terrible her acting is by providing a most lifeless and flat interpretation of an interesting and complicated character. When I saw that Maggie Gyllenhaal was in this film, I imediately pictured her playing Lucy Sue Glopp from the book, disappointingly this character never made it to the movie and Gyllenhaal appears extremely briefly as a one night stand.
Overall, the film visually is well crafted but the adaptation has ruined a highly unique story. I highly recommend the book.",1080432000,4,3351,4.72991452991453
1866346,4,B00008XERA,"From the moment I first lad eyes upon the CDM trailer, I knew, somehow, I would like this film. Based upon the book by the same title, CDM is a (true?) black comedy drama about former game show producer Chuck Barris. As a person of the present generation, before this film I had barely heard of Barris (though The Newlywed Game is one of my favorite programs on Game Show Network). But after watching the film for just minutes, Barris becomes extraordinarily famous again. Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is sublimely funny, all the while chocked-filled with perverted sexuality, and bizarre flare.
The film's plot centers around Barris' life; mainly from the start of his TV career, to his marriage. We follow Chuck through his early years, hungry for sex (who isn't?), and his days as TV creator. What spices this already interesting story up further is the little side job Barris holds as a contract killer for the CIA. As evident this severely complicates things. And of course excites things as well.
But probably the most excellent feature of the film is Sam Rockwell's absolutely magnificent portrayal of Chuck Barris. Rockwell is simply perfect as Barris; delivering a fluid and fun performance that even Holden Caulfield would have to admit is amazing realistic. It is indeed one of the best acting performances I've seen in quite awhile.
I must mention as well, George Clooney, Drew Barrymore, and Julia Roberts, all also shine as the supporting cast, making the movie truly enjoyable, even for acting sticklers.
The cinematography is also exceptional; with several quick switches between  fuzzy-overexposed film, to gloriously precise color, Confessions' visuals are continuously eye-catching, and complement the plot, and music of the film wonderfully.
And, of course, we also have veteran actor George Clooney in his first romp in the director's chair. And does he do a good job? I would definitely say so! The directing is probably the second best aspect of the film aside from the acting. I dearly hope Clooney decides to continues his directorial career.
There are two minor flaws of the film, though.
  The first would have to lie with Clooney's direction ( ironically, the best and worst aspects of the movie are the same man). Some scenes just seem a little too ambiguous in their confidence; it seems as though the dictor's ego is just a little too big.
  The second would have to lie in the editing towards the end of the picture. We are treated two flashbacks of Chuck's childhood, and his various problems with his mother. This is the only time in the film this issue is really addressed, and frankly, it is quite confusing. Somehow the scenes seem to imply that these early memories are the cause of Barris' troubles. I couldn't make the connection.  Either these scenes should have been cut, or additional scenes should have been added earlier on in the film for continuity. It would drastically improved the overall presentation of the movie.
But other then those extremely minor flaws, Confessions is still a amazing well written, well crafted, and well executed film, that should not only delight fans of the genre, but also fans of every genre out there.",1077926400,2,3183,4.92910447761194
1866347,4,B00008XERA,"This is a movie about BS and the way it can really mess up a life.  Not terribly vicious BS, just the typical Hollywood, game show TV type.  Chuck Barris is the king of BS. He knows it when he sees it and knows how to use it to get what he wants.  The problem is, he's so deep in it, he never really knows what he wants.  He just BS's his way through life.  He ends up naked in a hotel room in New York, trying to find some reason to keep living.
Until that point, Chuck Barris never really makes a decision his entire life.  He just goes with the flow, slings the sh**, and takes what comes to him.  You never really know what matters to him; I don't think this is a writing or directing weakness; I think the point is nothing really matters to him.  It's pretty amazing that you can make a movie about a guy who writes hit TV shows and works for the CIA and yet have nothing really matter to him, but the key element is the bull****.  As he narrates his life, he tells us all he wants is to get laid; that's not a desire, it's an appetite.  He gets into TV.  Why?  Apparently so that he can get laid.  It's impossible to believe that he has any higher goal, desire, dream for TV than that.
He meets Penny and their relationship is entirely based on agreeing that dating and romance is BS.  He becomes a CIA assassin without even thinking about it: Byrd offers him the job and he says, ""yeah, sure, I'll be a secret agent.  You get to F*** beautiul Eastern European women..""  he sees through the b.s. Byrd feeds him about serving his country and ""letting democracy get its proper foothold in the world,"" but he doesn't have anything better to replace it with.
There comes a point in the movie where Penny can't take it any more; she needs some kind of decision.  She asks him, ""do you even like me?  Do you want me around?""  but he can't give her a straight answer.  He's still full of BS:  ""everything's complicated.  I love you...in my own way.  Maybe not the romantic way, but what's that anyway?""  BS.  But so's what he just told her.  Penny tries to hang on to something: ""Did you just say you loved me?""  but even that statement is rendered meaningless by ""in my own way.""  What does that mean?  Nothing.  Everything.  Whatever he wants it to mean, and it can change from day to day.  It's BS.
And so he ends up naked in a hotel, ashamed of his life.  But, surprisingly for a Charlie Kaufman movie, he recovers.  His recovery looks something like AA's 12 steps:  First, admit you are wrong.  He writes a letter to Penny, asks her to forgive him.  Not take him back, just forgive him.  Second, catalog your mistakes.  He writes his autobiography.  Third, cut your ties to your old life.  He kills the mole and effectively ends his assassin days.  Next, begin your new life: he finally marries Penny.
And everyone lives happily ever after.  Maybe Kaufman was surprised; his characters never live happy.  So he throws on the ""Old Show"" ending and tries to act like the movies about broken dreams.  But it's not.  It's an incredibly movie about BS.",1076284800,,3051,4.292253521126761

1866350,5,B00008XERA,"This movie, based on the Chuck Barris 'Unauthorized Biography' of the same name, is twisted and compelling. Known to the world as host of ""The Gong Show"" and producer of other silly game shows, the plot alleges that Chuck led a double life as a CIA hit man. I recall reading the book when it first came out when I was in high school and finding it hugely entertaining though altogether unlikely.
When I heard it was being made into a feature film I was ecstatic, as I was always a fan of Barris. Overall this adaptation is quite good, but a good deal more depressing that I would have liked. Even the book, which has been recently re-released, is considerably more upbeat than the film. In his directorial debut, George Clooney acquits himself quite well. The film has an almost film noir feel to it, though I feel it's taken to extremes, for example in Julia Roberts' costumes: they scream 'cold war' so loudly, you might for a moment forget that you aren't watching Rocky and Bullwinkle chase Boris and Julia Roberts hither and yon.
The sets and locations are brilliant (for more on this, I highly recommend a viewing with the commentary turned on) and do accurately convey the era. The technical aspects of the film are brilliantly executed. Visual effects (mostly done 'in camera', i.e. not through cuts or editing) are superior. Particularly impressive is the 'rotating set' technique, which is explained in one of the special features. The sound editing is particularly noteworthy as well. The expression of unseen activities and moods through sound in this film is breathtaking, particularly in the pool scene late in the film.
Acting here is generally first rate: Sam Rockwell nails the Barris mannerisms, and Clooney is brilliant as the never smiling CIA recruiter. Drew Barrymore does yeoman's work in one of the more complex parts in the movie, and veteran Rutger Hauer is in peak form in a psychologically difficult part. The only performance I was not fond of was that of Julia Roberts, who, through a combination of direction and native acting abilities, came across as cartoonish, and distinctly less believable than the rest of the ensemble.
This is a fascinating and disturbing movie, a film that is more a psychological thriller than anything else. The DVD comes with some great extras, including deleted scenes, and an excellent audio commentary. It also comes with a short feature titled ""The Real Chuck Barris Documentary"", which is a gem and an absolute treasure for fans. Although the film was darker than I would have liked, it was generally well acted and directed, with innovative plot twists worthy of a story of intrigue and espionage.",1075680000,4,2663,4.86784140969163
1866351,5,B00008XERA,"""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" is about Chuck Barris who produced many television shows like ""The Newlywed Game,"" ""The Game Game,"" and ""The Dating Game."" He also was the host of the very famous ""The Gong Show."" This movie is based on his memroirs based on the same name. In the book he claims that he worked for the CIA and killed people as a second job. Sam Rockwell plays Chuck Barris in the film. Sam Rockwell wowed me in this movie, and then wowed me in a newer movie ""Matchstick Men."" What I liked about this movie was that the people who casted it were pitch perfect with Sam Rockwell. He looked just like the pictures of Chuck Barris that I have seen. He also looked different in every scene, something that I found very intesting. The rest of the acting was good. Drew Barrymoore was great as Chuck's girlfriend Penny. Julia Roberts was good with her short role. George Clooney worked in front and behind of the camera as an actor and the director, and I think that his vision of Chuck Barris' story was right on. The most important thing about this movie was that you care for the character of Chuck, and even though you know that he is not going to die on one of his missions, you can still get the thrill of what he feels like on his missions.
The movie begins in 1981 and we meet Chuck who is in a New York hotel suffering from a mental breakdown. Scared of everything he decides to write a book about what he believes to be a useless and wasted life. We flashback to 1955 where he becomes obsessed with television production and he believes that the future is big for TV. He meets the free spirted Penny, while sleeping with her roommate Debbie, and the two become attracted to each other. She also gives him the idea for his first game show ""The Dating Game."" After making a pilot he meets Jim Byrd who recruits people for the CIA. Barris agrees to becoming a member of the CIA, and decides to make dates on the show to the places where he has to go for his work. He is an assassian and uses the show as the cover for his CIA work. He produces more and more game shows and becomes successful, all while leading his double life. He meets another agent Patricia Watson and a shady guy by the name of Keeler, and becomes attracted to Patricia, while being involved with Penny. Things get much more confusing when it turns out that there is a mole in the CIA, and everybody cannot trust everybody else. Chuck cannot leave either because he knows everything about the organization. Every secret, everybody, and every plan.
""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" is a ""true story"" that I really can't believe it to be true. Barris really is believable though. Throughout the movies we are treated to interviews with Dick Clarke, the Unknown Comic, and Gene Gene the Dancing Machine from ""The Gong Show."" They all told the truth about Chucks activities, how he went away for long periods of time, etc. The movie was written by Charlie Kaufman who wrote great movies as ""Being John Malkovich,"" and ""Adaptation,"" and movies that are odd, but entertaining like ""Human Nature."" The similiar thing about all of his movies are that there is always an added twist. The same goes for ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."" Hollywood picked a perfect person to adapt Chuck Barris' story, and I cannot think of anybody that could do it as well as he did.

But who cares.  This movie has a lot going for it.  The lead is amazing, Drew Barrymore hits just the right tone, and Clooney's directorial debut is truly impressive.  A very worthy rental, but by no means is it a comedy.

Then Clooney comes on and starts talking about his own vision for the movie, saying ""I hope I didn't ruin it.""
It seems pretty clear he did.
The in-the-camera special effects, the performances, the sets and costumes are all top-notch, but the editing and tone of the film are in direct opposition to the material.  Clooney has made it into a film noir.  He took out all of the ambiguity and mystery.  The editing is a mess of unrelated scenes, poor music choices, unattractive color saturations and/or monochrome scenes.  For a film about a comic there are painfully few funny moments.  The script that enticed big names like Clooney and Julia Roberts and Drew Barrymore to sign on for essentially no money seems to have been thrown out the window entirely -- at least, there is none of the bracing originality that made ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Adaptation"" and ""Human Nature"" so refreshing.
The film seems to have been sold to the studio on the basis of the big names attached to it rather than the script or the original work behind it.  Roberts as the over-the-top femme fatale spy is totally out of place.  Barrymore as the goofball girlfriend is out of place.  Clooney as the deadpan CIA recruiter seemingly comes from a different movie altogether.  Rockwell does a heroic job with the material, and is easily the best thing going for this film, but even his performance cannot prevent it from going astray -- horribly astray.
Perhaps if a more-seasoned director like Milos Forman (""Man on the Moon"") had been at the helm, this shipwreck in tricky waters could have been avoided.",1074902400,14,1761,4.938983050847457

He moves the camera with the ease and grace that you will soon find yourself thinking that he is a seasoned pro at this.
Drew Barrymore's character is pretty run of the mill, but she is worth enduring for all the other awesome performances in the movie. Even Julia Robert's usually stomache-turning appearances become not only tolerable, but actually fun as her cartoonishly characterized CIA liason.

1866356,5,B00008XERA,"Years ago Chuck Barris wrote a rather astonishing autobiography in which he claimed that not only was he a sex-crazed Hollywood producer, but he also happened to have been an independent contractor (hit man) for the CIA. The project floated around Hollywood for quite a while, until George Clooney assembled a marvelous team to bring it to the screen. Clooney's direction is superb -- he uses interesting, compelling and surprisingly low-tech visuals to augment this remarkable tale and imbue it with a real sense of Barris's subjective POV. He gets top-notch assistance from cinematographer Newton Siegel (Three Kings) and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich). Sam Rockwell gives a magnificent performance as Barris, and the supporting cast is divine -- Drew Barrymore as long-suffering girlfriend Penny, Clooney as Barris's CIA handler and Julia Roberts as a mysterious femme fatale. Brief performances by Rutger Hauer and Maggie Gyllenhall are very funny, and cameos by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon are hysterical. The soundtrack is also very good.

DVD extras are exceptionally good -- a commentary track with Clooney and Siegel; a 23-minute behind-the-scenes featurette; 12 deleted scenes with optional commentary; Sam Rockwell's screen test; a featurette on the ""real"" Chuck Barris featuring Barris and augmented by comments from Jaye P. Morgan, Dick Clark , the Unknown Comic and other past associates; stills; and 5 Gong Show acts.

1866358,4,B00008XERA,"OK, this review is biased.  I was a huge fan of the Gong Show when it was on NBC in the late 70s.  Gene Gene the Dancing Machine...the Unknown Comic...Jaye P. Morgan!  I loved them all, but I especially loved the man in the center of the insanity, Chuck Barris.  The most ill-suited TV host ever was the perfect host for this crazy amalgam of ""talent"" that competed for a grand prize of around $500 and a cheezy statue.  My friends and I always thought that Barris was high on a snowy substance as he laughed and clapped and flubbed his lines - the luckiest man in show business?  Maybe, but this movie, adapted by the great Charlie Kaufman from Barris' unauthorized autobiography, suggests that there was a lot more going on behind his goofy on-air persona.
Whether or not you believe that Barris was a hitman for the CIA while creating, producing, & starring in his hit series during the 70s, this movie lets us imagine a world where Barris is chaperoning the winners from the Dating Game to such exotic locales as beautiful West Berlin as a cover so he carry out his assignments as ordered by the mysterious Mr. Byrd (George Clooney, who also directs).  He also interacts with the mysterious Patricia (Julia Roberts, miscast as the exotic beauty who may or may not be a mole).  Barris is initially disgusted by his CIA job, but finds himself drawn to it and eventually seems to prefer it to his public life as a game show clown.
I really enjoyed the artful surrealism to this film.  Since the story may or may not be the hallucination of a demented man, it's best not to take the film too seriously and instead enjoy the clever cinematography and trick shots.  I especially liked the sequence at 30 Rock in New York that show, via one long take, Barris' evolution from tour group member, to tour guide, to NBC executive.  I also thought the beautiful Drew Barrymore did a terrific job as the free spirit Penny who believes in Chuck all through his life, even when he doesn't deserve her love.  She is a much better actress than she gets credit for, and deserves a lot of praise.
The extras on this DVD are also terrific.  The audio commentary with Clooney and his director of photography reveal a lot of the tricks they used to make this story come to life (including a very funny inside joke involving Oswald and Ruby) and the featurettes introduce us to the ""real"" Chuck Barris, and show us the screen test of Sam Rockwell, who does an amazing job of completely becoming Chuck Barris.

1866359,5,B00008XERA,"I should have realized this was going to be a bizarre film when I saw that the screenplay was written by Charlie Kaufman of ""Being John Malkovich"" fame.  It was adapted from a supposed autobiography of Chuck Barris, the host of ""The Gong Show"" and ""The Dating Game"" television shows.  In the book, Chuck Barris says he was a CIA agent for many years and he murdered 33 people.  He supposedly carried out some of these murders while he was chaperoning winners of ""The Dating Game"" show to such places as Helsinki and West Berlin.
Sam Rockwell stars as Chuck Barris and he shines in the role which calls for him to be depressed and self-loathing as well as incredibly ambitious and outwardly successful television host.  George Clooney plays a small role as a CIA agent, but he also directed this film and he does a masterful job by using some very original film techniques to re-create the era of the TV game shows.  Drew Barrymore is cast in the role of Barris' loyal girlfriend.  She's a pleasure to look at and sometimes I wonder what she ever saw in Barris because he cheated on her all the time and rejected most of her hints about marriage.  But she's a fresh delight throughout, a juxtaposition to the dark intrigues that Barris was supposedly carrying out.  Julia Roberts has a small role as the femme fatale.  It's a good part and she does it well.
Sounds strange to you?  Well it does to me too.
I almost shut it off a couple of times because it was so outrageous.  But then I got into the rhythm of it and, by the end, I was completely captivated.  So captivated in fact, that I watched every single special feature on the DVD, including interviews with George Clooney, Drew Barrymore, Sam Rockwell and Chuck Barris.
The big question arises.  Was it true?  Nobody, including Chuck Barris, will answer that question.
Personally, I think it's all fiction.  But whether the story is true or not, it sure is creative.  And it has a lot to say about a particular era in the recent past.  It's hard to say if this was a comedy or a drama.  But it isn't hard to say that the film was well done even though it might not appeal to everyone.

I suppose the message of the movie is that Chuck Barris despises himself, and thus it is because of  that self-contempt that he projected himself outward, into shows such as the Gong Show.  Oh, and somewhere in all that contempt, is some sort of truism about America, and what Americans like and want. But I'm not buying that.  Director George Clooney obviously admires the edgier directors of his day - the Coen brothers, and Tarantino. (And one could roll it even further back, to the savage satires of Paddy Chayefsky (""Network"").) But he lacks their deft skills (Coen brothers) and/or thorough understanding of genre (Tarantino). And besides, even black comedies should, on occasion, be funny.  The secret life as CIA hit man bit is as boring and stupid as any act that ever appeared on the Gong Show. But hey, cynical Chuck really is a romantic at heart. That's why he has a divided psyche, the need for a secret life, since in his heart he knows what a toilet bowl his real life is. What bull! One star however for Julia Roberts twitching on the floor after a dose of poison.  (Somewhere in that scene is a metaphor for her career and/or her approach toward acting.)  Barris, truly a troll of a man, deserves to be forgotten.  Why Clooney decided to go with this project escapes me.  It's like watching a career suicide.

1866364,3,B00008XERA,"A film by George Clooney
Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is the debut effort from director George Clooney.  It is also based on the memoir by Chuck Barris.  Barris is best known for being the creator of the television shows: The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game, and The Gong Show.
We open the movie with Barris (Sam Rockwell) living in an apartment feeling very paranoid.  His girlfriend, Penny (Drew Barrymore) is trying to get him to come home, but it is very obvious that he is very freaked out about something and very non-trusting.  I think the movie jumps around a little bit with time, so we are taken back to when Barris is trying to pitch ideas for television shows and he has some measure of success when Jim Byrd (George Clooney) recruits Barris for the CIA.  Now Barris is living a double life as a Game Show creator/host as well as a CIA Assassin.  He meets Patricia (Julia Roberts), also an agent.  As the movie continues, Barris's paranoia grows.  He wants to quit with the CIA and just work on his shows, but Byrd keeps pulling him back in.  At first he thought it was fun, but no longer.  The movie covers a period of Chuck Barris's life, though we do get a flash forward where a much older Chuck Barris sort of reflects back on his life.  We see Barris both as the Secret Agent as well as the slightly out of control game show host.
One thing that the movie does not make clear (perhaps because there is no clear answer), is whether or not this is all true.  We know it is based on a memoir, but it has a feeling of not being quite right.  This isn't answered.  It is played as being true, but in other scenes, we wonder.  Did Chuck Barris really kill those men?  Is Patricia really an agent, or is she just a woman Barry is seeing?
Whatever the take you have on the movie, I found it somewhat disappointing.  It was fairly well made, and Clooney did a good job directing, but the movie didn't do much for me.  It was just ""blah"".  Nothing special here.  Move along.",1066608000,2,1983,4.322493224932249

1866366,3,B00008XERA,"""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" is a confused, smarmy biopic of Chuck Barris, the sad, rather insipid host of ""The Gong Show,"" whose life, even by his own admission, isn't worthy of a silver screen treatment. But it is so ambitiously and impeccably shot by first time director George Clooney that while the movie essentially succeeds as a lengthy showcase of cinematography, it does succeed more than it should. Clooney obviously went to visual preparatory school - drawing upon far more inspiration than just buddy Steven Soderbergh - to create a collection of pop images worth looking at, if nothing else.
Barris was the creator of ""The Dating Game"" and ""The Newlywed Game"" in the 1960s, ""Gong Show"" host in the 70s, where his performance as the tuxedoed emcee remains one of the most bizarre roles in television history. He bottomed out not long after the show was canceled, and then resurfaced with the title book, which flouted the highly dubious claim that he was also a CIA assassin for more than 20 years, collecting 33 notches on his silencer.
Charlie Kaufman's script tackles the book head on in an effort to humanize Barris and bring these ""spy encounters"" to life; Sam Rockwell never seems to age in the film, but he's capable as a forever insecure, puerile Barris. And Drew Barrymore is very good - maybe better than she's ever been - as Penny, Barris' long-suffering girlfriend. Barrymore delivers one line - ""Man, I'm gonna give you one more chance - got it?"" - as if she's said it too many times, to too many creeps.
Clooney balances the movie between Barris' rise/fall in showbiz and his CIA career under, well, Clooney, who as agency field boss Jim Byrd assigns Barris to reward his dating game guests with trips to Europe, serving as a perfect cover for a mission. Rutger Hauer, plucked from the trash bin of history, is a hitman partnered with Barris on a key case, while Julia Roberts is completely spinning her wheels (again) in a bit role as a shadowy assassin with bigger designs.
As creative as Kaufman has been with his original scripts (""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"") he never finds a unique structure of presenting the story, outside of a framing device that finds Barris at the end of his rope, naked in a hotel room. There is one amazing scene where Kaufman compiles all the criticism of Barris into one monologue by a Playboy Bunny (Krista Allen) that plays as the turning point of the film.
Mostly, however, ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" is an endlessly inventive visual experience. Clooney, with cinematographer Thomas Newton Sigel, uses every crayon in the box: split screens, rotating sets, infrared cameras, mirrors, deep focus, tracking sequences, offscreen dialogue, subtitles for dialogue drowned out by music. In scenes set in the 1950s, actors look like gleaming pieces of obsidian. Later, the classic Soderbergh washed-out look is employed. Clooney splashes his ego all over the canvas, but he's doing it with craftsmanship and flair that will serve him well when he pares his visual repertoire in later movies.
The drawback to such showmanship, of course, is that it relegates the story, and Rockwell's performance, to chunks of scenery. Kaufman's script can't quite decide how to present Barris, waffling between pity and derision, both informed with the slightly suffocating arrogance of Kaufman's attitude toward showbiz. And Rockwell, at times, seems to be playing the notes without hearing the music. It doesn't help that both Clooney and Roberts have bought so wholly into the Soderbergh School of Posture Acting that they've become uncomfortable with the smallest hint of enjoyment in the craft; they perform with Rockwell as if to beat him down with the rise of their eyebrows. Barrymore is perfectly cast as the easygoing girl with a sweet heart, but she plays Penny with a weight that, had it been duplicated instead of mocked by Clooney and Roberts, might have infused ""Confessions"" with some amount of resonance.
But never mind. Barris, as a man, is no John Forbes Nash, and since half the story is probably a lie, what we invest in a joker is wasted time anyway. ""Confession"" is never consistently smart or funny or poignant - it may, in fact, be halfway annoying - but the themes are overwhelmed, and rightly so, by the film's dazzling look. It may not entirely illuminate the complexities of Chuck Barris, but it is an impressive tour of the time Barris lived through, and helped create, even if, one day, it leads to the decline of the Western Civilization.",1066089600,,4533,4.903645833333333
1866367,5,B00008XERA,"I don't understand the negative reviews this film generates.  It's inventive, stylish and more than a little moving.  Sam Rockwell is superb as the disintegrating Barris.  Kaufman's thoughtful script perfectly captures the pathos and splintering consciousness of a thirtysomething loser who imagines he's something else.  Clooney's direction is clever and confident, and rightly so - this is the best actor-director debut I've seen.  He's clearly learned a lot from his buddy Steven Soderbergh, but this never plays like an amateurish homage piece.  It's quite simply one of the most original, interesting and well-crafted films of the year.  Like ""Solaris"", it's going to be one of those movies that everybody missed and then spends the next decade discovering on DVD.",1065225600,2,769,5.411764705882353
1866368,2,B00008XERA,"All too often, when an actor decides to try his/her hand at directing, the result is disappointing.  It's as if actors feel such a need to prove themselves as having a bold directorial vision that the style of their movie takes precedence over the substance.  That is the case here with ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.""
George Clooney overdirects this film to the hilt.  Count the number of unconventional compositions that serve no purpose other than to be unconventional.  I love experimental, original cinema, but I hate pretentious directors who think merely by shooting a scene from a crooked angle they're making high art.  ""Confessions"" should be much better than it is, since it's full of striking images, propulsive music and pretty good performances.  But it's a mish-mash, not helped at all by the mess of a screenplay by Charlie (most over-rated screenwriter in Hollywood) Kaufman.
And whoever made the decision to shoot the entire film in a funky, surreal color scheme should be denied the right to work in film forever.  Again, it serves no thematic purpose and does nothing but distract.
This isn't a horrible movie--it's not even necessarily a bad movie.  Yet, I just didn't like it.  It contains good elements--the acting, for one, is pretty solid over all--but I thought the whole thing just felt flat, and wasn't anywhere nearly as interesting or dynamic as it seemed to think it was.

1866369,4,B00008XERA,"I think Steven Soderbergh should be quite flattered: George Clooney's directorial debut, CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND, is a tribute to his work. Clearly the films they've done together have had a great influence on Clooney. Stylistically, the way the filters are used to indicate the mood and the location of the scenes is right out of OUT OF SIGHT and TRAFFIC. The cast including Clooney himself, Julia Roberts and cameos from Brad Pitt and Matt Damon gives one the feeling that casting for CONFESSIONS was done on breaks from Soderbergh's OCEAN'S ELEVEN. Luckily I really enjoy Soderbergh's work (except for last year's inexcusable vanity piece FULL FRONTAL) so this did not diminish my enjoyment of this film.
Just prior to seeing this film, I had listened to Chuck Barris' reading of his 'unauthorized autobiography' and heard Clooney discuss his approach to the film in terms of the central question of the truth behind Barris' account of his own life. Clooney celebrates the VERY fine line between fantasy and reality that exists in Barris' story. His claims of balancing the life of a successful TV producer with contract work as a CIA assassin-for-hire is so bizarre that it seems just as likely to be true as not, a notion this film exploits beautifully.
Sam Rockwell shines as Barris, capturing the real dichotomy of Barris' character: deeply shy and thoroughly obnoxious, consumed by failure and unbelievably successful. His slouchy stance and floppy hats pulled down over his face show that he's not comfortable in his own skin. I think Rockwell was a good choice both for the strength of his performance and also because he is not so familiar that he was unbelievable playing a biographic role. (Something that I think worked similarly for Greg Kinnear in AUTO-FOCUS.)
For once Drew Barrymore's flakiness is a plus in the role of Penny Pacino, Barris' on-and-off-again love (who is actually a Barris-styled amalgamation of many women from his past). Penny's styles and interest change with the weather, but her devotion to Barris is pathetically unwavering. Julia Roberts gives another one-note performance playing Patricia, a fellow CIA assassin and sometime lover of Chuck's. Slight spoiler: As a Bostonian I was disappointed by her on-screen demise, because in the book he claims to have bumped her off following a stroll through the city and dinner at The Union Oyster House. However, all the locations in the movie are deliberately vague, more theatrical sets than actual cities, so better not to make a strong visual identification with a specific place.
In all, a thoroughly entertaining exploration of artifice, as viewed through the life of one of the masters of the craft.",1064448000,,2698,5.0651685393258425

Clooney is the best out of the box actor turned director I've seen in almost ten years. There is no doubt he will direct more and I will be first in line. Clooney's style is very creative and fresh compared to today's computer eye candy movie. You can almost see the directors he's worked with in the past sort of come together. Then we have Sam Rockwell. This man was powerful and driving in the role of Burris. He stole the movie and ran with it.

But it definitely did not show. It was like George had been doing this for years. His acting is always superb, but put that with phenomenal directing as well, and what youve got is an all-around good movie. An excellent casting for Chuck Barris (Sam Rockwell) results in a film that will make you laugh and also keep you on the edge of your seat. The movie is based on Barris autobiography, about television producing, sex, and CIA assassinating jobs. Barris is a sex-crazed man who stumbled upon the up and coming television business. When his first pilot is cancelled, he is really down on his luck and out of work too. Luckily, a CIA agent (George Clooney) recruits him to be a top secret assassin who travels all around the world to kill people that America doesnt like. The story gets more complex and interesting and most definitely keeps your interest. Assuming that the story is not completely true (but hey, who knows) it makes for a good lot of entertainment, with laughs and suspense. I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, however I can see that this movie is not for everyone, but check it out and see, you never know!",1063756800,,1300,4.583690987124464
1866372,5,B00008XERA,"Chuck Barris (Sam Rockwell) spent every conscious moment since puberty chasing women -with little success. Then he discovered the newly emerging world of television. This was something he could do. He could put on a show. He understood the public's tastes. And there were available women galore. Barris started out giving tours at a  television network, and worked upward from there. He met a free-spirited woman named Penny (Drew Barrymore), whom he later married, through a one-night stand with her roommate. Penny believed in Chuck, encouraged him, and gave him all the independence he could want.  Chuck rose  to prominence at ABC when his ""Newlywed Game"" became a hit. He went  on to produce ""The Dating Game"" and ""The Gong Show"", in which he also starred. But Chuck Barris led a double life. Shortly after his success with ""The Dating Game"", he claims to have been approached by a recruiter for the CIA (George Clooney), who told Chuck that he perfectly fit the ""profile"" to do contract work for the agency and that his country needed him in its battle against Communism. Chuck agreed to the job. And the CIA trained him as an assassin who would use the cover of escorting ""The Dating Game""'s winning couples around the world to carry out his murderous assignments. Or was it all a fiction from the mind of this consummate entertainer?

""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" is based on Chuck Barris' autobiography of the same name, public records, and hundreds of hours of taped interviews. The film was directed by George Clooney in what is one of the most impressive directorial debuts ever by an actor. Charlie Kaufman, who has made a name for himself writing non-linear films, wrote the screenplay. The constraints imposed by the mostly linear nature of this film bring out the best of Kaufman's abilities, though, and result in his best screenplay yet. Chuck Barris' game shows were precursors to modern reality television and ""trash tv"". Sam Rockwell brilliantly conveys Barris' simultaneous inferiority and superiority complexes. He made me wonder if some of today's trash tv moguls don't suffer from the same neuroses. George Clooney employs a combination of traditional and heavily stylized techniques to bring Chuck Barris' story to the screen. The film's style gets heavy-handed as the story nears its end, but this seems an appropriate expression of Barris' eventual unraveling. The question that ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" elicits but never answers is: Is it true? Was Chuck Barris really an assassin for the CIA? The idea that we cannot know how much of this story is true and how much is fiction is probably part of the film's appeal. I am inclined to think that Barris' claims are a result of his peculiar combination of intense self-importance and acute self-loathing. But the man always knew how to entertain, and George Clooney has brought Chuck Barris' strange story to the screen with skill and ingenuity.",1063670400,5,2936,4.983673469387755

1866376,4,B00008XERA,"Although Chuck Barris didn't give birth to reality television, he helped raise it to its modern form. Don't hold that against him. Confessions, like most reality television, is a con. It's a fun con and an interesting con (hence the pun of the title from Barris' book and the film CONfessions of a Dangerous Mind)but nothing to be taken too seriously.
For those who don't know Barris was a creative wunderkind for reality television. He turned real life into a game show with programs like The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game and The Gong Show. Confessions posits that Barris not only did all of that he also was a hitman for the CIA on the side. Again, keep in mind that Barris used to twist reality into a game and vice versa. His ""unauthorized"" autobiography did much the same thing for that genre. The film obliges and takes Barris' claim at face value.
What we get here is George Clooney as a CIA operative who recruits Barris. In the process, Barris becomes a cold blooded killer in the name for democracy while making whoopie on the television world. Barris isn't very good with committment and, as a result, he ""dates"" his girlfriend Penny on and off throughout the turbulent 60's and 70's. He also manages to move from producer/creator/auteur to celebrity host when he creates The Gong Show. Barris' double life, the stress of television and his own ability to deal with the criticism of his role in ""dumbing down and humilating"" American culture bring about his downfall.
COnfessions is always interesting, visually stunning and possibly one of the best, off-beat scripts that Charlie Kaufman has written (and that's saying something). Kaufman uses Barris as a microcosm of the conflict in the world. His internal conflicts reflect the conflicts of the time. Kaufman also manages to make Barris' situation move from the absurd to the funny and then serious without blining an eye.
George Clooney's direction is sharp, witty and innovative. Clooney has a real flair as a director and his director of photography always keeps the film visually innovative and interesting. You'll notice subtle (and not so subtle)shifts in the look of the film as we progress from one world to another. In many respects, the schzoid look of the film reflects Barris' inner world as well. Interestingly, Clooney also chooses to interview various people from Barris' life and intercuts it with the action. These sequences range from funny (Jaye P. Morgan) to interesting (Jim Lange's comments) and act as something of a reality check for the film.
Sam Rockwell captures the manic energy that Barris generated on stage as well as the quieter, private moments of the man. His performance should have made him a star. Clooney nicely underplays his CIA contact. Drew Barrymore captures the free spirited Penny quite well and provides an interesting contrast to Rockwell and Clooney. The film is stocked with cameos from Clooney's friends (watch for Brad Pitt, Rutger Hauer and others in tiny roles/cameos).
The transfer is stunning with no analog artifacts. There are minimal compression artifacts but given the way the film is shot, that's not a big surprise. The sound mix and transfer is stunning as well. Clooney and his sound editors use the soundtrack as a springboard into other aspects of Barris' life. The extras vary from a documentary on Barris to the audition of star Sam Rockwell.
A bizarre, fascinating and totally unexpected mainstream film from Hollywood and Clooney, Confessions offers much promise for the star and director. Well worth viewing.",1063497600,,3545,4.979763912310287
1866377,2,B00008XERA,"Well, Clooney dropped the ball with this one.  The film is a mess.  Could have been great...The pacing is all over the place.  What am I saying?...There is no pacing!  Drew Barrymore and Sam Rockwell give excellent performances.  The only reason to see the movie is for them.  What the hell is Julia Roberts doing in this?  It takes you right out of the film.  The editor should get a spanking.  This movie should have moved.  It should have felt frantic and manic like Barris himself.  The only scenes that really work are the ones between Rockwell and Barrymore.

1866378,4,B00008XERA,"George Clooney shows yet another aspect of his interesting career in the movies by stepping into the shoes of Director for the strangely, absurdly interesting CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND.  Much of the feel of the biopic of Chuck Barris' life and times as an on-the-edge talent who gave us The Gong Show and The Dating Game is tongue in cheek or surreal or film noir (is the CIA assassin bit for real?).  There is a small statement at the inception of this prolonged purview of Barris' life that claims the film is based on diaries etc so we are led to believe this is indeed fact - stranger than fiction.  Clooney has a terrific style with pacing and view choices, color, mood, music - all of which contribute to creating a solid movie.  His generosity of spirit is also noted by quick cameo appearances by the likes of Brad Pitt, Rutger Hauer, Julia Roberts etc and his main characters Sam Rockwell, Drew Barrymore, and Clooney himself are all superb.  This is an odd movie and perhaps not for everyone's taste, but it certainly introduces a fine fresh look that bodes well for more work from Clooney.",1063238400,,1106,4.593908629441624
1866379,4,B00008XERA,"This is a pretty ""offbeat"" movie, to say the least.  For many  modern day viewers younger than 25 or so, Chuck Barris will be pretty much unknown to them. But for those of us who remember THE GONG SHOW or THE DATING GAME, it's a real treat.  That's not to say that  young people won't enjoy it, I just think they'll miss out on some of the fun.
The movie delves into the mad fantasies of Barris, and it never speculates on whether his ""autobiography"" is true or not.  Was he really a hitman for the CIA?  Well, it seems pretty darn unlikely, but it is presented here as though it is true.  But we also see that Barris slowly goes mad.  Is he deluded (like the lead in A BEAUTIFUL MIND) or is he just having fun with his readers / audience, or was it all true.  We don't know, and director Clooney doesn't give us the info we need to decide.  Therefore the movie has a slightly unfinished feeling, but I'm sure that was intentional.
The best parts of the movie are the Oscar-worthy performance by Sam Rockwell, and the delightful turn from Drew Barrymore.  Drew is a charming actress with a limited range (see DONNIE DARKO for the limits of that range).  She is sweet, sexy, vulnerable and loveable in this movie, as Barris' much abused girlfriend.  I really think it may be her best ""serious"" work.  Rockwell is a revelation.  I remembered him pretty well from THE GREEN MILE, but I think it's great that Clooney was savy enough to pick this guy.  He has a great look for the part, and he totally emerses himself in the role.  It's a performance that runs just about every emotional range, and the viewer goes right along with him.  If the movie had done better, I think Rockwell might have been an Oscar contender.  It's a shame he was overlooked.
Clooney does a very competent job as director, and I think it's great that he tackled such an offbeat project.  He doesn't take it too seriously, yet there is lots of loving period detail that makes the tone seem just right.  His performance is adequate if a bit generic.  He's another actor with limited range (see SOLARIS...if you dare), but he puts a nice twist on his charm as a villain in this movie.  Julia Roberts has a smallish role, and frankly, she is pretty bland.  Compared to the high-spirits and zest for life of Drew Barrymore's character, Roberts just isn't believable as someone Barris would chuck everything for.  I'm not the biggest Julia fan, but even I can admit that when she's on target, she is quite effective.  In this movie, I feel like she was just doing her buddy George a favor by showing up to work, but hadn't even bothered to read the rest of the script.
But, that being said, all in all, I highly recommend this movie for mature movie goers.  Kids will hate it, but for an adult who doesn't mind stretching the bounds just a smidge, it should be a nice, light treat.
Also, as an aside, the final shot of the movie is a real humdinger.  Clooney is to be congratulated for thinking of it!",1063065600,,2968,4.396330275229357
1866380,5,B00008XERA,"George Clooney is a fine actor and he has done excellent work in the past. However, when I heard that Clooney was going to direct, I was a bit apprehensive. There are actors who have done great work as directors (Orson Welles, Robert Redford, Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood), yet George Clooney did not strike me as one who would excel as a director. Then along comes Confessions of a Dangerous Mind to convince me otherwise. Working from a screenplay by the always-great Charlie Kaufman (scribe of Adaptation), Clooney has constructed a fabulous film that succeeds in just about every way.
Clooney has the benefit of an intriguing story, based on the book by Gong Show host Chuck Barris, a great script and a fantastic cast. Sam Rockwell is a fine actor, and Confessions is probably his best work to date. Rockwell carries the movie; A daunting task, but he succeeds admirably. He brings humanity and sadness to his character and even makes him somewhat sympathetic. Hopefully he will be getting better and better parts after this one. Drew Barrymore is great as Barris' sort-of girlfriend, Clooney himself appears as the CIA recruiter who's interested in Barris, and Julia Roberts shows up as a fellow operative. George Clooney has learned much from his friend Steven Soderbergh and brings an astute sense of visual style to the film. Clooney really deserves credit for an exceptional filmmaking job.
Whether or not Barris' story is true is really not of concern to me. Even if it's all fiction, then it made for a remarkable story anyway. It will give viewers something to debate after seeing the film. The real Chuck Barris shows up for a cameo at the end, in a very touching and sad moment. Indeed there's a strong element of sadness to the story as Barris realizes what he has been and what he could have been. ""I'm doomed to hell"" he writes. And not just for being the one responsible for The Gong Show.
Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was overlooked at the box office when it opened back in January. Perhaps it was the fact that George Clooney and Julia Roberts were only in small parts that kept people away. Or perhaps people were scared away by Charlie Kaufman's name, knowing it would likely be ""weird"". It's a shame though, because those people missed one of most unique and enjoyable films of the year. It's perhaps not for all tastes, but for those who enjoy quirky films beyond the usual Hollywood dreck, Confessions will be highly enjoyable.

1866381,4,B00008XERA,"I saw this movie in German and English. I loved both versions. It is so incredible it is probably true. In real life truth is quite often stranger than fiction. Chuck Barris famous for the Gong Show and other such inane and mundane ""entertainment"" claims to be a CIA contract assassin. He is sent for secret training where he excels at shooting targets of Chairman Mao, Fidel Castro and Lenin with his trusty M1 30.06 Garand rifle. He is taught to make nitroglycerine and other improvised explosives as well as other black arts all to the tune of Wednesday's Child which was also the theme song of another classic spy movie (The Quiller Memorandum). The most amusing scene in a horrible kind of way is where the would be assassins are taught how to torture, oops! I meant ""interrogate"" their captives for information. Chuck finds it all very funny and takes copius notes. Then off he goes, in between recording TV shows, terminating the enemies of Uncle Sam in various, strange locales all over the world. He is even captured by the STASI and KGB in a joint operation, and exchanged at the Berlin Wall for one of the previous contestants of one of his game shows, who it appears is a KGB spook. A wonderful scene in a dark German nightclub when Chuck goes up to the wrong female contact and says his code phrase but gets the wrong response. Quick to improvise, he finds the right one on his next try. Very well done are the intimate scenes. It is very true that people in high risk jobs tend to find release from the stress, danger and tension in sex, especially for spies. George Clooney is great as his Company controller and Julia Roberts is really sexy in her portrayal of a cold, amoral CIA officer or agent, we are not told which. Anyway, she dies. Chuck is too smart to let her poison him and she poisons herself inadvertently. The wedding scene is hilarious! Black comedy at its best. He cofesses to his wife that he is a CIA assassin in the limo enroute to their honeymoon, and she laughs in his face thinking it is a joke. I laughed till my belly ached. Very enjoyable.

1866382,4,B00008XERA,"Supposedly a `true story' the film is based on the `unauthorised autobiography of Chuck Barris' one of whom you have probably never heard of, but have watched his game-show concepts many a time.
The film begins with a middle-aged man who isolates himself in a flat away from the public, ex-girlfriend (Drew Barrymore) and moreover reality.  Sitting at his typewriter, Chuck (Sam Rockwell) narrates how pathetic life is in general and the common thoughts of young hopefuls who dream that in ten years time they will be highly successful, but by the age of sixty, retrospectively analysing where it all went wrong.  Five short minutes into the film I have already placed the film into the Drama bucket, until suddenly the camera cuts to a real-life commentary from some random woman, who obviously was acquainted to Chuck. This is shortly followed by commentary from the man himself Chuck Barris, looking like your average elderly man living next door.  Somewhat bizarre, you have to give Mr. Clooney benefit of the doubt, this being his directorial debut you can hardly expect him to weigh up to the likes of Scorsese and Peter Jackson, and so I will turn a blind eye.  I mean surely it cannot get any worse...
The plot lightens up later, with Chuck blagging his first job at NBC as a tourist guide, and I must say this is the first stage in the film that I become impressed with Mr Clooney. In one continuous shot, the camera centres on Chuck who is grouped with a bunch of tourists being shown around the works of NBC by a girl guide, with the camera swiftly moving onto Chuck now being a tour guide himself, showing a couple around the NBC building. The shot is worked wonderfully well and is clearly emphasised through the smooth movement between the girl guide and Chuck perfected by the scripted NBC dialogue of what both guides are saying simultaneously.
Chuck has bigger ambitions and in hope of sleeping with a woman at work applies for a promotion at NBC. Moving on from here, we see Chuck flying out with reality TV- Show concepts left, right and centre, all of which attract little attention from any TV producers. Chuck now laid off from work, with no one interested in his ideas for a television breakthrough is intruded by Jim Byrd (George Clooney) a CIA specialist in search of his next employee.  Agent Byrd having studied Chuck all his life insists that he fits the profile to be a very good killer for the CIA and persuades Chuck to go to a special training camp, where he will learn the necessities of the CIA.
Being involved with the CIA is obviously top-secret classified information and so we have the joy of watching Chuck ducking and diving around in order to prevent anyone, especially his girlfriend, sussing him out. This becomes all the more cumbersome when an ABC executive finally decide that they want to run his show `The Dating Game.' With the intention of quitting the CIA to solely concentrate on his TV show, Chuck is confronted by Byrd who delivers an irresistible proposition. The CIA will fund couples on `The Dating Game' to holidays in Eastern Europe and whilst the fortunate couple are having a romantic time away; Chuck will be on his latest mission plugging European Communists.
The film then takes you on board a roller-coaster ride, bringing in the likes of Julia Roberts, lots of killings, terrible talentless people, freakish flashbacks of Chuck in his youth, two quick famous cameo friends of Clooney (I won't spoil it for you), and a clever little twist at the end.
From an overall perspective of the film, it's really not as bad as the first five minutes would suggest.  Clooney experiments with the camera and does so quite well, Sam Rockwell, unknown to me before this film, is impressive and Drew Barrymore shows she is more than just a pretty face.

Leave it to Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation), sans make-believe twin brother Donald, to create a script so rich with dementia that even Barris himself would be proud.  Clooney takes the script and runs with it, and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel (who I insist must be an alias of Soderberg's, considering their stylistic likeness) and Sam Rockwell's Chuck Barris keep up the pace (and utter mahem) quite nicely.
As with all of Kaufman's other screenplays, the audience experiences the rollercoaster of the lead character's psychosis, which Kaufman is truly the master of representing in words.  Until Confessions, I don't feel as though any director or cinematographer has truly captured the visuals of Kaufman's mental madness more effectively than Clooney and Sigel.  I always thought Terry Gilliam and Kaufman would be a perfect pair considering their similar tendencies toward artist psychosis.  Quite possibly because of this, I noticed several similarities between Confessions and Gilliam's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
This is not a film for the average Clooney fans, since it will probably leave them scratching their heads just like Soderberg's Solaris did.  Though, at least Confessions does not feature Clooney's naked rear as the center of its mainstream hype, in fact it lacks any mainstream hype at all.  This is true indie, art house quality, with stylistic (bordering on experimental) editing and cinematography.  It all seems so fabricated, just like the story, despite its use of documentary interviews (which appear less real than the narrative elements) and found footage.
The Gong Show, Dating Game and Newleywed Show footage bring back all my childhood television memories of growing up in the 1970's.  Confessions is obviously a medium for a critique of U.S. television standards, which haven't changed much since the days of Chuck Barris.  U.S. television is still obsessed with its working class culture making fools of themselves on television.  We've even taken this to a new level of being ""entertained"" by ""real"" (usually lower class) people being chased and arrested on prime time television.  And who watches this stuff?  Generally the same class of people appearing on screen.  How sick is that?  According to Confessions, we only have Chuck Barris to blame for ""lowering the bar.""  My only criticism is that Confessions is only preaching to the choir.  Its art house, intellectual mentality will make it unapproachable and uncomprehendable for the people that really need to watch and learn, the U.S. working class.  Even the best of directors have this problem (Soderberg for example, except for Erin Brokavich which did appeal to the working class audience thanks to Julia Roberts) so I don't hold this against Clooney.
Confessions is a movie that would make his past directors, namely Soderberg and the Coen Brothers, proud.  Clooney has obviously learned a lot about directing from his acting career, and untilizes everything effectively while creating his own distinct style.  Other actors turned directors should watch and learn.",1053388800,14,3380,5.303939962476548
1866385,5,B00008XERA,"Confessions of a dangerous mind is George Clooneys first time as a director. I must say he was pretty good.  With an interesting script and excellent actors, all Clooney had to do was not invent too much and it would be fine. It was.
This is Chuck Barris unauthorized autobiography, based on the homonimous book by the same Chuck Barris.  Ever since he was young, Barris intention was to work on TV. Later, he was famous for being the producer of tv shows like The Gong show and The newlywed game, among others.
What I gather from watching the movie is that Barris title for his book is extremely appropriate. Being prisoner of a dangerous mind, Barris way to escape a monotonous existence and problems in childhood was to invent the life he always wanted to live. So, he made up CIA agent Jim Byrd, who recruits Barris to be a hitman for the agency.
About the movie: I first payed attention to Sam Rockwell in The green mile; in that one he was better even than Tom Hanks as a crazy psychopath. In Confessions., Rockwell delivers a stupendous performance as the troubled and yet funny Chuck Barris. Also great is roller-coaster-career Drew Barrymore. This one is a high-point in her acting; shes intense, pretty and serious all at the same time. Minor participations that must be noted are those of the director, George Clooney, as the enigmatic and kind of clowny CIA recruiter Jim Byrd; Rutger Hauer as a german spy; and, most of all, Julia Roberts as another enigmatic woman in Chuck Barris life.
All this makes Confessions... a good movie. The problem, though, is that, as it gets closer to the end, I felt the movie was a little pointless, and I couldn't see a plausible point for the movie to go. And in fact, in the end Confessions... didn go nowhere. It just stopped. But I still give it a good rating because of the interesting first 60 minutes, interesting premises, and, above all, Rockwells performance.

Barris is, of course, the man who first numbed American sensibilities with such TV programming as ""The Newlywed Game"" and ""The Gong Show."" To pretend that his life was really a cross between Goldfinger and The Day of the Jackal--what better way for a guy like that to build up his importance in his own eyes? And, further down the line, what better metaphor for a guy who knows he's wasted not only his own life, but the lives of countless others as well?

1866389,1,B00008XERA,"Well, I knew it had to happen sometime. After forty six reviews I finally have found a truly worthy recipient of only a one star rating. I have a fairly eclectic taste in movies, and usually manage to be entertained as long as the film has a decent story line and good production values. After all, the time and effort invested is a lot less than to read a good book. And since I love comedies, like stories based on real life characters (in fact, I remember Chuck Barris and when his shows were popular), and have truly enjoyed Julia Roberts and George Clooney in previous films, I had reasonably high expectations for this movie despite it's mixed reviews. However, I was so bored that I almost walked out during the movie.
This is a Charlie Kaufman film, so I was prepared for some combination of different/strange/experimental and unique. It is based on the autobiography of Chuck Barris, the controversial game show creator famous for developing THE NEWLYWED SHOW, THE DATING GAME and THE GONG SHOW, which at the time were viewed as prime examples of the decline in this country's culture resulting from mass market television. (And certainly were in some sense the tame and self censored forerunners of the current wave of ""reality programming"".) Supposedly, Barris was simultaneously a clandestine operative for the U.S government utilizing his cover to engage in espionage and murder. Sam Rockwell plays Barris, and may well capture the essence of his personality. Clooney and Roberts are undercover operatives, and actually are two of the mildly entertaining characters in the film given the way they overplay their characters. Drew Barrymore is Barris' perfectly matched long time girlfriend.
The movie is a combination of social commentary, parody, Hollywood artistic creativity, and comedy, but the elements are in the wrong proportion and never gel. It starts slowly and occasionaly picks up but never hits it's stride. It also has a lot of vulgarity, crude sexual references and what seem like almost continual views of Rockwell's naked butt. While I understand that the purpose of these techniques was to recreate the authentic essence of Barris, they came across as somewhere between distracting and too heavy handed.
I considered giving the film two stars, because there were a few really comic lines and it certainly contained moments of artistic brillance. But approximately ten minutes of enjoyment is not enough to sit through this  almost two hour film. The relatively large audience seemed to share my reaction, there was occasional scattered laughter, but generally little obvious reaction and several people left before the conclusion. I understand the risks of engaging in artistic creativity, and the fine line betwen success and failure. I am fully aware that some reviewers enjoyed this film immensely. But for me it was not even close to being informative, entertaining or artistically compelling. I would not watch it again unless paid a huge amount of money. Not horrible - perhaps even worse, boring and banal.",1045008000,13,3043,5.086
1866390,4,B00008XERA,"""Confessions"" purports to tell the story of Chuck Barris the ""creator"" of such early ""reality TV"" as ""The Dating Game"", ""The Newlywed Game"" and ""The Gong Show"", and, if this flick is taken at face value, a CIA killer with about 30 corpses to his credit.  Reviled for his shows, both the passage of time since his primetime heyday and the sheer volume of repellant programming today that passes for reality TV would make Barris a character fit for rehab (nobody had to eat horse rectum on ""Gong Show"").  Barris, in an inventive spin, says otherwise: he was not only as bad as he appeared in 1976 (when there looked like no end to how much ""stuff"" he had for us), but that he was a killer and a user of women.  Even the idea for ""The Gong Show"" came to him in an epiphany in a classic scene in which he imagines gunning down the vast swath of untalented Americans he'll need for his show.
The flick opens with Barris as a desiccated loser going to hell in a seedy NY hotel room in 1981. Penny, a love interest played Drew Barrymore, tries to save him, but Barris's sins are too great - he must tell all.  Flashback to a younger Barris, the perfect loser - a sexually challenged/driven white male whose inability to connect costs him the few chances of love that come his way (despite, or more likely, because of how sexually knowing he was as a child).  By the late 1960's, at a creative, career and romantic nadir, Barris is implausibly recruited for the CIA by a charming cold warrior named Jim Byrd (George Clooney).  Conceiving the idea for ""The Dating Game"" while learning how to torture and kill The Enemies of the American Way (in some apparently disused industrial park where it's always winter), Barris becomes a perfect killer (he's the only recruit who can shoot straight).  After a few apparently successful CIA missions, Barris's career and life pick-up.  The networks become interested in ""Dating Game"", and he gets serious with Penny.  When Byrd reappears, Barris hits on a ""perfect"" idea to explain his trips abroad - with winners on ""Newlywed"" and ""Dating"" winning trips to exotic Helsinki and glamorous West Berlin to go with their Amana refrigerators.
Unfortunately, Barris learns to hate himself - for both halves of his life (we learn that he was very sensitive to criticism, which he earned when creating ""Gong""), and when the networks cancelled his shows, he withdrew to a lonely existence with nothing to protect his fragile ego from the scorn it earned.
This flick is a bit of a gem, but it loses much of its inventiveness in the 2nd half (it takes a real nosedive after Barriss's inspiration for ""Gong""), and it's never the laugh riot the trailers make it out to be.  The flick suffers because of its dual story, neither connecting with the other, no matter how the plot tries to unite Barris the Prime-time impresario with Barris, the CIA killer.  In that vein ""Confessions"" seems to unintentionally mirror ""A Beautiful Mind"" -  loose espionage subplot with a charismatic spymaster/mentor (Clooney instead of Ed Harris); the spy characters breeze in and out of Barris's life, including the wedding scene, without ever touching Barris's career or Penny.  The ""spy"" story is inherently unreal, and it hurts more than helps ""Confessions"" because it quickly begins to appear like something Barris cooked up to explain his unproductive life.  Instead of a purveyor of horrible TV, profiting at the exploitation of average (untalented) Americans, Barris was a death-defying spy and himself a victim of exploitation.  The point is made best when one of Barris's more pitiable gameshow contestants victims is revealed as an enemy spy (and apparently a more valuable one), but it's made much too early in the film.  Unlike the guys who made ""Beautiful Mind"", ""Confessions"" can't divorce itself from the idea that somebody will buy Barris's spy story and its meaning, instead of Barris story of a guy who made millions from humiliating countless Americans.
Unreality is reinforced by the spies' characters - Julia Roberts supposedly worked less than a week on this movie, and it shows (as a sexy spy who doesn't let her cold war smarts keep her from going to bed with Barris faster than any of the other women who reject him immediately; the story improbably allows Barris to get the better of her in the end); George Clooney (who improbably settles on Barris as prime killer-material immediately after watching him lose a bar fight) and even Rutger Hauer as a drunk CIA operative who eludes an East Berlin dragnet that nets Barris, yet succumbs to a KGB mole that Barris eludes.  The implausible premise (well known and presumably recognizable pop-culture figure being sent undercover) doesn't help, and the fact that Barris's less plausible life as a spy is the one he runs to (rather than from, despite its menace), underscore how invented it sounds.
The spy-plot is a shame, because the film reveals a dark secret of Barris's past, one that frames the sorrow that sets the tone for the entire film, yet one neglected in favor of its sexier subplot.  Barris, it turns out, is a surprisingly sympathetic and even acceptable character by the end of the flick, which is otherwise wholly draped in shadows.  Despite its loyalty to the spy-subplot, the script bravely reconciles us with Barris as the master of exploitation, and makes clear that Barris can face that sin as well.  This is a film that won't appeal to everybody, but it's a clear sign that we need to see more from Clooney and Sam Rockwell.",1044921600,,5518,4.782334384858044

1866392,2,B00008XERA,"Growing up and watching The Gong Show, I always got the feeling that Chuck Barris was coated with a thin, oily residue. This movie does nothing to change that.
First, praise where praise is due. Confessions  is engaging, and well written. Barris slips between his show-biz and spy personas seamlessly, and the movie explains his inspirations for various game shows in a way that is ingenious. The principle actors are good in their roles (with the possible exception of George Clooney, whose mysterious spymaster is a trifle wooden) and Sam Rockwell's performance as Barris during his Gong Show days is dead-on.
That said, I didn't like the movie. Why? For one thing, I don't care for films containing scenes where one child actor asks another to perform a sex act. (But I'm just crazy that way.) This scene occurs a few minutes into the movie, and the child that does the asking plays the young Barris. We are then informed by the adult Barris, narrating, that he got what he wanted and that he's been looking for one thing from women ever since. He puts this in the crudest terms possible, and any sympathy I might have had for this odious little man pretty much flies out the window at this point. And we still have most of the movie to go.
Confessions also takes itself far too seriously. One would expect the odd concept of a game-show-host-turned-CIA-assassin to be played for laughs, and the film does have its lighter moments. But particularly towards the end of the movie, things become unrelentingly dark, culminating in a bizarre and belief-straining scene where Barris imagines The Gong Show audience to be filled with bloodied dead bodies. (Not to be missed is a prior scene where Barris pulls his gun and takes a bead on The Unknown Comic.)
Confessions contains crude language and some swear words, some scenes of sexuality and some of graphic violence. I also saw Rockwell's bare butt so often, I began to think it was some type of cinematic metaphor. When the end credits rolled, I was left with two bits of basic information. 1) Chuck Barris is not a happy camper (and maybe not too sane, either), and 2) I could care less.",1044662400,4,2140,4.706666666666667
1866393,3,B00008XERA,"...What is good about this movie is that it tries hard to be iconoclastic and gritty.  And, no question, this is a warts, warts, and more warts portrayal of the money-grubbing, narcissistic creep who brought us such fine entertainments as the Dating Game, the Newlywed Game, and the Gong Show.  As our culture sinks lower and lower into the pit of schlock TV, Chuck Barris was nothing if not incomprehensibly boorish before it became a mainstream thing.  Remember, he was a sick slickster before Robert Bork fell face down drunk in his yard, before Bill Clinton tickled himself while an intern got to know a cigar, before Survivor and Bachelor and all the horrendous exploitation television that has so captured the American imagination.
The story is a familiar one of materialism and lust leading to physical and emotional self-destruction and despair.  And that's part of the problem.  Chuck Barris is an awful and unsympathetic human being whose descent into the gutter--we finally see him grizzled and morose at the very end--is anything but appealling.  Sam Rockwell is a terrific actor who probably has captured Barris' empty soul, but there's only so much time you want to spend with the man.
Julia Roberts is adequate in her performance (looking quite unattractive in the process), as does George Clooney--who looks like a poor man's Tom Selleck as a mysterious CIA man.  And Drew Barrymore mails in the same character she's played in every one of her films.",1044489600,8,1466,4.959183673469388
1866394,5,B00008XERA,"My friend Joyce and I saw this together and by the end of it, we believed that Chuck Barris did work for the CIA as an assassin while he was producing ludicrous tv shows that pandered to the lowest common denominator.  Actually, it is BECAUSE he could create demented, inspired, cruelly laughing-at-your-audience shows like Dating Game, Newlywed Game and the Gong Show that we believe he could also be a CIA agent.  This is one twisted guy who does not respond to any of the traditional rules most people live by. He has no code of conduct, no sense of morality and was easily able to travel all over the world because of his shows, with no one thinking his travel odd.  It is utterly fascinating material. George Clooney (director), Charlie Kaufman (writer) and Sam Rockwell (the lead as Chuck Barris) bring it all home. It is riveting viewing.",1044403200,,845,4.657718120805369
1866395,3,B00008XERA,"Director George Clooney's ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" is an interesting film, a somewhat melancholy take on the life of ""Gong Show"" creator Chuck Barris. Though the project is ambitious for a first-time director, the acting is good and the film's visual look is great, the tone of it struck me as uneven. It's not the fun, zany trip that I was expecting, with its opening echoing more ""Sid and Nancy"" than ""The Dating Game."" Given the subject of the film is Barris and his outrageous claim that he worked as a CIA assassin, should it be so dark and solemn?
Sam Rockwell's a talented actor. His work in film, verging from his wacky role in ""Box of Moonlight"" to his dancing-villain turn in ""Charlie's Angels"" of all things, is consistently different and fun to watch. His take on Barris, who meanders somewhere between goofy and emotionally damaged, is compelling yet still doesn't make Barris an accessible person to the audience.
The film suffers the same flaw as ""Man on the Moon,"" which gave us two hours on the life of Andy Kaufman without letting us much find out about what motivated him. Though Barris is central to every scene, you can neither laugh at him nor particularly care about him. What drives him to get into television? Why would he make up the bit about the CIA assassin, if he did? If he did live as one, why do all the scenes involving his CIA work seem to scream 'plot device'?
One key into Barris' psyche is revealed toward the film's end, and it's a twisted, weird bit about his relationship with his mother. If it's true, and we are hinted that it might be, the revelation doesn't hit home the way it should because we know that half of Barris is telling us is a lie, so the audience isn't quite clear on what to believe.
Drew Barrymore's portrayal of Penny, Barris' chief girlfriend, is a delight. She's bright, always on and quirky, but the movie's tones are not always like that. I thought she was better than her material. And Julia Roberts and George Clooney provide little more than cameos, and their characters are so enigmatic, that plot so trivial, that they come off as one-note. (Still, Roberts does get the biggest laugh in the film.)
All in all, I was disappointed.",1044230400,8,2209,4.594936708860759
1866396,3,B00008XERA,"Despite its superb cast, wonderful directing, and crazy plot, ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" just didn't cut it. Based on the book ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind: An Unauthorized Autobiography,"" by Gong Show host Chuck Barris, this is the story about his secret life as host (and creator of The Newlywed Game and The Dating Game), including the time he spent as CIA assassin ""Sunny Sixkiller"", making hits while under the guise of chaperoning the game show contestants who have won vacation prizes.
Perhaps because he likes a good story, perhaps because he enjoys tweaking the establishment, perhaps because unleashing all that terrible television wasn't enough for him, perhaps (though not very likely) because it was actually true, Barris insisted in his book that he had yet another career: He was a decorated hit man for the CIA, with numerous assassinations to his credit.
This is a fairly outrageous claim, yet it is the peculiar accomplishment of ""Mind,"" written by Charlie Kaufman and directed in his debut by George Clooney, to have made a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not. Barris' triumphs and his crises mean the same to us: zero.
Unfortunately, there's nothing terribly witty, clever, satirical, or irreverent about Charlie Kauffman's screenplay. The movie attempts to liven things up by muddling the time line a little (a significant portion is told in flashback), but all that does is to mix around an otherwise linear story.
Ultimately, however, this isn't a movie of great substance, nor does it offer much real insight into its subject. The movie has a little fun with the spy aspects of the story (which, despite Barris' assertions to the contrary, are almost certainly fictitious), playing them with B-movie flair, but, in the end, they seem rather superfluous, and not charming or clever enough to keep us interested.
This is the directorial debut of George Clooney, and he is eager to show how much he has learned at the hands of the A-list filmmakers he has toiled under. So we get a style that is about 50% Soderbergh and 50% Coen Brothers. Sometimes it works, but mostly it comes across as too artsy, with all sorts of bizarre angles and unusual shots. Clooney frequently plays games with color, contrast, and focus. There are scenes that are black-and-white (or so leeched of color as to appear almost without hue) and others that appear intentionally colorized. Visual chicanery like this can be useful if employed for a reason, but Clooney's approach is that of a kid let loose in a candy store, and it often gets in the way.
""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" is blessed with a number of fine performances. As Chuck Barris, Sam Rockwell is phenomenal. Clooney gives himself the low-key role of Jim Bryd, Barris' CIA contact. Drew Barrymore is Penny, Barris' long-term, long-suffering girlfriend. Julia Roberts accepts a supporting part (or shall I say extended cameo) as Patricia, the resident femme fatale. There are also distracting, blink-and-you'll-miss-them cameos by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon.
It's nice to see Clooney choosing something offbeat (as opposed to ""safe"") for his first outing behind the camera. If he continues to develop, he has the potential to become a good director--he's just not there yet.",1044230400,,3293,5.0
1866397,3,B00008XERA,"This movie isn't bad, I just didn't like it. Charlie Kaufman's screenplay left me without conviction to one plotline. The story behind the lead character's rise to fame and wealth seemed all based on hard, verifiable facts, while the angle that highlighted the connection with the international underworld was spotty, difficult to follow, and unbelieveable (in a not good way).
To focus on each, The portrayal of his development of his career as a television producer and love affair with Penny, played by Drew Barrymore, is potent and inspiring. You see a man with dreams, and you see his dreams come into fruition despite his self-loathing nature. Because of the interference of the assassin plotline, the interesting story of his absurd rise to fame is consistently cut short. I can see the potential for an interpretation of this storyline conflict as a metaphor of Barris' 2 lives, both half-finished, constantly interrupting and interfering with the other. Nonetheless, it detracts from the quality of the film, in terms of entertainment value.
The CIA operative side of the story is equally half-finished, and ends up woefully dominating the plot by the end of the film. What starts as a movie about a TV producer with a nagging affiliation with the shady underbelly of US politics turns into a film about a lost soul who buries the invasive regrets of his underworld lifestyle in his self-destructive behavior. By the end, the CIA side of the story takes near-total precedence, and is ultimately pervasive to the overall storyline. Out of nowhere comes a trite spur of a subplot where the two highlighted agents doublecross one another and eventually end each others' careers in espionage. The plot never officially turns tables and works toward one goal versus the other, though. The theme is that Barris can't put his past behind him until the double agent is found and killed, but it's never enunciated with sufficient emphasis to redirect the whole narrative to that end. What emerges is a film where one scene ends and the next starts, with nary a reference to connect the two.
Where this film truly loses its value is in the 'gimme' scene where he's wandering through the backstage area of the Gong Show studio, seeing larger-than-life portrayals of his own subconscious, done up in backdrop scenery paintings. I would bet a finger that this was added to the film after an initial screening to an audience who found the inklings of Barris' inner demons nonconvincingly dramatized in the earlier scenes. What emerged was the same kind of give-away that happened at the end of <i>Being John Malkovich</i> where the tangled threads of the actor's subconsciousness are spilled onto the screen for anyone who didn't catch these more subtly portrayed points throughout the preceeding portions of the film. This is clearly a mechanism to open up the storyline to the regretfully substantial portion of the general audience without sufficient skills in dramatic interpretation to assemble and decipher the concepts by their own power. Shame on Kaufman, who, in the balance of the two films and annoyingly explicitly in <i>Adaptation</i>, seems to shun this mainstay of the Hollywood boilerplate offering.
If you stay to read the credits, you'll notice that this film's contributors are a who's who of Hollywood magnates. The way the film feels makes me think that a bunch of people saw what seemed like a ball to write, stage, produce, and profit from, but what they came up with was a neglectible story that never really communicates anything substantial about Barris, the TV industry, the CIA, the politics of the Cold War, or love and regret. This would have been a much better production with a more dedicated staff who paid attention to the quality of the end product rather than nailing each component scene, which at least is something that I can credit the film for doing unfailingly.",1044144000,3,3898,4.998461538461538
1866398,5,B00008XERA,"I saw the movie in Palm Springs where George Clooney and Sam Rockwell attended and did a Q & A after the film. This of course heightened the overall experience with the movie. It is done as a comedy yet your mind can linger on it afterwards and wonder if there is some truth to Chuck Barris. According to alot of critics there is not, but still we don't have the answer. That makes the movie fun. The question reminds open, leave it to our own speculations. The films colors are really full and than can darken when Barris goes on assignment with the CIA, giving it a film noir appeal. There is a frame of Roberts sitting half in shadow that looks very classic, reminding me of older generation films. When asked why Clooney placed an acrobat in one of the scenes, he said he just did, why not. I think that is what the film portrays, alot of creativity also it pays attention to the time period it is filming, clothes, attitude, etc. There is a scene where it shows a girl on the newlywed game, she anwsers with a really great response, that is pure innocence. Clooney said, "" Bob Eubanks denied that this was an episode, but Barris got the original for the movie, so apparently this really did happen."" Clooney called the lady up and asked her if he could use this in his film. She said, ""I'm a grandma now."" Clooney offered her 5 grand and she decided well what the heck. Sam Rockwell does a great performance. I was really impressed by his talent. He seems very quiet and reserved in person. Clooney of course, is very funny and captures a crowds attention. All the characters in the film are fun to watch and the storyline is captivating! So Clooney walked away with my pen and I walked away with some autographs and a satisfying film experience.

But at the core of this film is Barris himself: a man with his pulse on the tastes of an entire nation yet unable to commit to the one woman who adores him (Penny played by Drew Barrymore), a man who is always on the losing end of a bar fight who is recruited by the C.I.A. to be an assassin and a man without much education who can recite and comprehend the works of Shakespeare and Carlyle. But more than anything, Barris is a man who can't seem to find a place or a person that brings him comfort. He is a man who is always nervous, always unsure, and never completely happy or at ease.
Sam Rockwell is able to capture all the facets of Barris' persona and play out the rare intelligence of Charlie Kaufman's screenplay with assurance: this role will become a touchstone of Rockwell's career for years to come. Drew Barrymore has never been more enchanting, sweet and luminous than she is here: she lights up the screen whenever she is in the frame.
""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" is a dark, troubling film that nonetheless shines a very bright light on the life of someone who surprisingly, because it comes from such an unexpected source, has a very fascinating story to tell.",1043712000,2,1682,4.61
1866400,3,B00008XERA,"I am a frequent watcher of the late night talk shows, and George Clooney has been on all of them lately to promote his new movie, ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.""  The hosts and critics alike had very good things to say about this movie, so I dedided to see it.  Here is my take....I don't understand.
This movie is a biopic based on the life of game show creator Chuck Barris.  He created, among other things, The Newlywed Game and The Gong Show.  AND according to his book and this movie, he moonlighted as an assasin for the CIA.
The movie was dark.  The lighting was dark, the writing was dark, and the colors were dark.  The actors spoke in hushed tones and there was a lot of jump cutting which affected the continuity of the movie.  The movie was slow.  Painfully slow.  There was plenty of cursing and gratitious nudity, as well as some cameos by the Unknown comic, Gene the dancing machine, and Dick Clark.
As for my opinion, I can see how the critics liked it.  Its composition was original, its score and lighting extremely creative, and Drew Barrymore and Sam Rockwell gave great performances.  BUT, it was extremely slow, dull, and at times just plain boring.  I don't understand why the people who makes these things feel like they have to go over the top with the creativity and editing.
Negatives aside, I do not believe for a second that Mr. Barris was a CIA hitman.  He seems too frail and laid back to be able to pull off an assasination.  But, the whole ""Was he or wasn't he"" argument is brilliant marketing by the distributors of the film.
This movie was just OK.  Nothing special.",1043712000,12,1604,4.463917525773196
1866401,3,B00008XERA,"In the period from the late 1960's to the mid 1970's, Chuck Barris was the hottest producer of game shows on the Hollywood circuit. Everything he touched was virtually 'Midasized'. ""Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind"" chronicles the above time period, revealing both matter-of-fact and some rather shocking information - according to the film's storyline. The intro to the movie claims all information contained therein is taken from actual accounts from Mr. Barris himself. ""Confessions..."" goes to great lengths to attempt to prove to its audiences just how far one man would go to achieve celebrity status, including a stab at glory of wanting to be one of the most powerful men in showbusiness. The first half of this movie gets its point across rather nicely, as we get to witness Chuck Barris' struggles with network executives and his rise to the  top - of which he was well on his way during the period of 1965-1966, when he created and produced two of the biggest game shows of all time with both ""The Dating Game and ""The Newlywed Game"" (both of which in the recent past have seen continuous airplay in reruns on Game Show Network). Barris would hit paydirt again a decade later with ""The Gong Show"", which he emceed as well from 1976-1980. But, the strange premise of ""Confessions.."" reveals an ominous dark side of Barris - regarding his connections with the mob underworld as an undercover spy. The reasons for Barris' involvment with the CIA aren't stated very clearly in the film - it's as if the head secret agent (played by George Clooney) just pops up without just cause, although Clooney's appearance here is nothing short of spectacular (including an excellent job as a director for the first time in his career). It is at this point in the movie where things unravel a bit. It seems as if Sam Rockwell's portrayal of Barris' (character) is just going through the motions, moving from one disjointed scene through the next (from tracking down merciless thugs across Europe, to countless ""sexcapades"" involving numerous women). The bright spot of ""Confession...""'s second half, is ""The Gong Show"" (briefly mentioned above) footage (some of it being archival), although featuring a somewhat slightly above average emcee delivery performance of Barris (courtesy of Rockwell) from the program. The sets from ""The Dating Game"", ""The Newlywed Game"" and ""The Gong Show"" used here were constructed exactly like in the actual shows, another plus which adds an authentic touch to ""Confessions..."" The ""behind the scenes"" interviews from the few celebrities involved with Chuck Barris Productions, helped keep this picture afloat as well - as people such as Dick Clark, Jim Lange, Jaye P. Morgan, ""Gene Gene The Dancing Machine"" Banks and others, each give a brief and candid summation of what it was like to work with ""The Man Himself"". If it wasn't for the insights of these fine entertainers, ""COADM"" would have been a subpar effort, nonetheless. Anyhow, this couldn't truly be a Chuck Barris biopic without an appearance by ""Chuckie Baby"" himself. Even though this is probably a loose account of the 1982 text biography, ""Confessions..."" is still worthy of a viewing, especially if you're into (pictorial) biographies. Be advised, however, that this movie, along with its ""gematic"" scenes, contains lumps of coal as well. First half: 4 STARS: Second half: 3 STARS. Overall rating: 3.5 STARS (still above average).",1043539200,,3423,5.037037037037037
1866402,3,B00008XERA,"First of all I really wanted to enjoy CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND. The previews seemed intriguing and interesting  but despite my good intentions I left the theater feeling dismayed and disappointed. In his debut as a director, I am afraid that George Clooney missed the mark with this movie.
Chuck Barris (Sam Rockwell) is a *very* unlikeable protagonist. He is a selfish and egostical young man hoping for his big break in Hollywood developing and producing tacky daytime television game shows. During the movie Barris declares that he wants to live a meaningful life but feels depressed when he realizes that he has failed to do just that. However, as the movie continued I could care less whether he encounters some existential fulfillment or not as I really didn't care about him. How can I cheer for such a ill-concieved character as Barris? There was nothing to cheer for.
This movie was based on a true story. Scenes from interviews from various entertainment figures that worked with Barris were shown throughout the movie and it appears that everyone is in agreement that Barris was an a**hole. So who cares about his troubles? Speculation continues whether Barris really worked as a CIA operative at night while producing his game shows during the day. I don't believe it. His ego is so large that I believe it was simply an aspect of his overactive imagination.
Overall, CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND was a letdown. I left the theater feeling empty and dismayed.",1043539200,2,1480,4.896414342629482
1866403,4,B00008XERA,"Was Gong Show Host/Creator Chuck Barris really a CIA Assassin with over 33 kills to his credit? Or is he just a little bit insane? Confessions of a Dangerous Mind makes it possible to embrace either possibility....
  Starting with his childhood as a pervert-in-the-making, and going all the way until his actual writing of his ""Unauthorized Autobiography"" in the early eighties, Confessions traces the life of Barris, including his creation of ""The Dating Game"", ""The Newlywed Game"", and ""The Gong Show"", his recruitment and training into the CIA, and his mental breakdown following his career collapse. Sam Rockwell portrays Barris, and does one hell of a job. He has all of the mannerisms and body language down cold; Rockwell deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance. The film is directed by George Clooney, and he puts his years of acting experience to good use; His Directing is flawless, and he fills the screen with surreal images and casts several familiar faces in supporting roles and cameos.
  So was Barris REALLY an assassin...? Probably not, but the film made me wonder just how implausible that notion really is....",1043539200,4,1138,5.06951871657754
1866404,5,B00008XERA,"I'd like to start this review, ladies and gentlemen, with an impression. Gene Shalit a la ""The Critic:""
""'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind?' They should call it 'Confessions of a Great Movie!'""
I tip my Guinness to you, George Clooney, for you did not disappoint. The cinematography and the camera work were great. The pacing was good, and I never felt any of the boredom or discomfort I often do when seeing a movie in the theater.
Sam Rockwell was great. (I only wish they'd had more ""Gong Show"" segments because Sam had Chuck Barris's onstage mannerisms spot on.)
And, of course, the materail was great. There were some very funny parts, some very cool parts, and some heartwrenchingly sad parts. Plus, no matter how many times I see it, I still think the scene where Julia Roberts clears the table, and Sam Rockwell crawls across the table to kiss her is killer sexy.
I felt the same kind of giddy excitement walking out of this movie that I used to feel as a kid, after seeing a movie that struck a chord in me. I wanted to watch it again immediately. I couldn't stop thinking about it. They treated Chuck Barris with a great amount of respect, which I was very happy to see because it could so easily have gone the other way.
It's not a life-changing movie, but it is damn fine entertainment, and I will own it in the future. I also look forward to seeing Clooney direct again. I dig his style.
If you prefer a great story, classy directing, and some fine acting to the usual big budget, overblown direction shlock-fests or little-thought-necessary star vehicles, this film is time well spent.  Sharp, witty, and sexy.
Chuckie Baby, wherever you are right now, God love ya.",1043539200,2,1678,4.574750830564784
1866405,3,B00008XERA,"Although his name is Charlie Caufman, he should be, from this day forward, be addressed as the new Paul Schrader.  The only other writer to dive into the murky, pain stricken deeps of the male mind, is Mr. Schrader. Now, with his three most well known screenplays, Mr. Caufman comes full circle with his latest, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. He explores the fantasy of a man who is not really a winner or loser, but is in some kind of middle ground, Chuck Barris.  Barris, who claims in his novel from which the movie is based, that he killed 33 known enemies to the American government. Now with that, first time director George Clooney stages all of these killings as fantasy elements.  He lets us look inside of this complicated man, to try and find a reason to understand his madness. Although Clooney is a fine actor, he should have picked only one job and stuck with it. It appears as if he was trying too hard to fill the movie with as many ""things"" as possible. The complicated shots he pulls off are rather fun to look at, but serve no real purpose other than the fact that he paid close attention while working with the Cohen brothers. However, credit must be paid to the great Cinematographer,Tommy Seigel, who blows the mind with more colorful pastels than a box of crayons. Playing Barris, we see Sam Rockwell, who proves here just how fine of an actor he truly is. In this, his first leading role, Rockwell makes the transition from supporting player, to front runner with no problem at all. Altogether, the movie was not bad, but it had just a few to many things wrong with its focus and direction to be anything magnificent.",1043452800,3,1643,4.525252525252525

7987740,5,B00008XERA,"Considering this is George Clooney's first movie as director, I think this is a very unique and original film. It tells a very fresh, original story about of one of television's most infamous personalities. It is a masterful dark comedy and is very period accurate. I like the progression of the story and the progression of culture as well as television through the decades. The maybe he is/maybe he isn't assassin story is a nice juxtaposition with the television subplot. This is the movie that made me fall in love with Sam Rockwell and shows his range as an actor.
I really don't understand all the negative reviews; I think if you gave this movie a one star review you aren't meant to watch anything indie or halfway intelligent. This kind of movie is the antithesis of big budget braindead fare like Transformers. Succinctly put-if you like the Transformers movies and the fast and the furious, this is probably NOT the movie for you. But, if you enjoyed movies like the Hudsucker Proxy, Ed Wood, A Bronx Tale, or the original Hairspray then you will most likely enjoy this movie.",1500076800,,1087,4.726315789473684
