7857187,4,6303962424,"Thanks to the wonderful use of the internet, I relived an old WCW event in the 14th annual Starrcade. Before I begin I just want to state this is a review on the actual 1996 version of Starrcade which didn't feature the World Cup, which occurred in 1995. This event continued the nWo storyline with the main event being a reunion between two of the biggest icons in professional wrestling. At Halloween Havoc, Rowdy Roddy Piper made his WCW debut & confronted the leader of the nWo, Hollywood Hulk Hogan that lead to a series of events that brought this match together with it being labeled as ""The Match of the Decade"".

Unification Match: WCW Cruiserweight Champion Dean Malenko vs J-Crown Champion Ultimo Dragon. This was a history making match as this was the first time that numerous cruiserweight titles would be on the line in North America. This was a more unique performance than what was expected from the cruiserweight division as they actually did a great job in mat wrestling with Malenko using various submission holds including attacking the leg to Dragon trying to take the air out of Malenko. With the high-flying coming into effect at times, this was an outstanding match that was worthy of being on the Starrcade DVD.

Finals of the WCW Women's Championship: Madusa vs Akira Hokuto. This was the finals of the tournament to crown a women's champion in WCW for the first time (which didn't last long anyways for some reason). For the most part, Madusa got a shot here & there but this match was dominated by Akira as she would make history by being the only women's champion in WCW history.

Rey Mysterio Jr. vs Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger. Similar to Malenko/Dragon earlier in the night, this was a more unique performance out of both men's careers as they focused more on mat wrestling with moments like Rey doing the camel clutch to Liger applying a half crab to the point that it looked like Rey was about to give due to the pressure of it while the high-flying action came into play near the end of the match with both men even pulling off some stiff offense.

No Disqualifications: Chris Benoit vs Jeff Jarrett. Don't let the title of this match fooled as this stayed more of a wrestling match with both men being very aggressive with their offense & even brawling around ringside at one point. The bigger story here was the appearance of Arn Anderson along with the continuation of the feud between Benoit & Kevin Sullivan over Woman that actually lead to a surprise twist at the end of the match.

WCW Tag Team Champions The Outsiders (nWo) vs Faces of Fear (WCW). The first match that featured the continued rivalry of WCW vs the nWo with one moment to mention that again despite being the heels, Hall & Nash were actually cheered for more than their opponents in this match. This was a good average match with Syxx & Jimmy Hart getting involved as well as Nick Patrick being the biased official that he is. However, one impressive moment to mention is Nash's powerbomb to the Barbarian.

Finals for the Vacant WCW United States Championship: Eddie Guerrero vs Diamond Dallas Page. The end of their feud as they had battled for months going into this event & unlike their Halloween Havoc match, they are not fighting for the Battlebowl ring but instead for the title. And just like their Havoc encounter, this was a good match between these two as they worked well together despite their different styles. However, the bigger issue was the appearance of Scott Hall, Kevin Nash & Syxx that not only continued the feud between DDP & the nWo but also set up the feud between Syxx & Eddie Guerrero over the United States title.

Lex Luger (WCW) vs The Giant (nWo). This was actually a better match than their previous Great American Bash match from earlier in the year as they told a good story here with Giant being the dominate monster & even doing a couple of athletic moves for a man his size while Luger never gave up & actually got in some good offense on Giant to the point where Luger placed him in the torture rack. The bigger issue here was the appearance of Syxx, Nick Patrick & Sting who showed where he stood in the WCW/nWo war before Luger got the upset win along with the tease of the Giant's frustration over the nWo.

Rowdy Roddy Piper (WCW) vs Hollywood Hulk Hogan (nWo). WCW build this match as ""The Match of the Decade"" as these two familiar foes got at it for the first time in WCW. This was actually one of both men's best matches in their WCW run as they did a good job in actually wrestling with the brawling element only coming up once in a while as this was a good quality match that lived up to the hype it had. The ending was really something as it was something that nobody had seen before along with the beginning tensions between Hogan & Giant that lead to not only Giant quitting the nWo but also their title match at the next PPV event.

Overall, this was one of the best WCW events that happened during the nWo era along with this being one of the best Starrcades that I have seen. There wasn't a bad match on the card so this is an event that I would recommend.",1260835200,,5114,4.508090614886731
7857188,5,6303962424,"This title was labeled as Starrcade 1996 when in reality it contains Starrcade 1995. Misprints also occured with the covers and labels for Starrcade 1996, 1997, World War 3 1995, 1996, 1997. Alot of sellers are not aware of this as they just buy and sell titles for profit rather than actually being a die hard wrestling fan and or reviewing product before reselling it.",1241740800,,370,4.707692307692308
7857189,4,6303962424,"I had not watched wrestling since I was a kid, but the brilliant NWO storyline that resurrected WCW in the mid-90s drew me back in, and I found myself actually paying exorbitant fees to watch numerous pay per view events.  Starrcade 1997 was billed as one of the biggest nights of wrestling ever, with its culminating match between Hollywood Hulk Hogan and Rowdy Roddy Piper proclaimed the match of the decade.  It didn't quite live up to its hype, but the overall event certainly offers plenty of pro wrestling entertainment.  After pulling for bad guys all my life, I found myself entrenched in the WCW camp of good guys, hating the NWO with every fiber of my being - largely because I have always hated Hulk Hogan.  Hogan was very good at being very bad when he turned on WCW and joined the NWO, adding several more years to a career that was beginning to falter, and his confrontation with Roddy Piper stands at the apex of the whole WCW/NWO storyline that lit a fire under professional wrestling in the mid-90s.
The first match of the night is a cruiserweight unification match between Dean Malenko and the Ultimo Dragon.  This match was a little disappointing, as both fighters seemed a little sluggish, and the aerial skills of Ultimo Dragon were never put on full display.  The second match crowned WCW's first women's champion, with Madusa facing Japan's Akira Hokuto.  You can always depend on some great hair-tossing moves by the ladies, and Hokuto even adds a little foot-biting to the action.  All told, this isn't a bad fight, but an American flag upside the head of Madusa sees the Japanese fighter go home with the belt.  The third fight features Jushin Thunder Liger vs Rey Mysterio, Jr.  You have to respect Liger for much more than his wrestling abilities; just four months before this match, he had surgery to remove a brain tumor.  This was the first match between these two incredible cruiserweights, and although there is far less aerial showmanship than I expected, it's a darn good fight.
At this point, it's time for the big boys to start coming out.  Jeff Jarrett faces Chris Benoit (with Woman) in a No Disqualification Match.  At this time, an injured Ric Flair had endorsed Jeff Jarrett as a new member of the Four Horsemen, a decision which Benoit had, to put it lightly, a problem with.  All kinds of stuff happens in this match, including an attack by Hugh Morris and Konan on Woman, a peculiar act of interference by Arn Anderson, and Kevin Sullivan doing what he does best - clobbering Benoit.  Dissension among the Horsemen only increased after Jarret's ultimate victory in this match.  Next up is the tag team championship match between the NWO's Outsiders, Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, and the Faces of Fear (Barbarian and Ming) with Jimmy Hart.  The referee for the match is Nick Patrick, and by the time the match ends even Bobby the Brain Heenan is ready to admit the fact that Patrick has sold out to the NWO.  Barbarian and Ming get plenty of good shots in, though, making this a fun match to watch.  Next, Diamond Dallas Page faces Eddy Guerrero for the United States heavyweight title.  At this point, DDP was a bad guy who had spent the year tormenting the entire Guerrero family, but his recent refusal to join the NWO ends up costing him the match (although the NWO beat up on Guerrero and steal his belt after the match ends).  One of the night's better matchups follows, as WCW's Lex Luger takes on the NWO's Giant; a lot of stuff goes down in this contest.  Predictably, the ref gets knocked out, and Luger gets the Giant up in the torture rack not once but twice, only to have his legs knocked out from under him by Nick Patrick and then by Six.  The arena then erupts as Sting, who continued to be a mystery man hiding in the shadows, comes in, leaves his bat in the middle of the ring, says something to both wrestlers, and walks out.  Luger ends up taking the bat to the Giant, leaving the defeated big man wondering where his NWO friends were when he needed them.
Finally, we get to Hogan-Piper.  Hogan is his typically obnoxious, despicable, cowardly self, but once he and Piper finally start going at it pretty good, the match catches fire. The ref lets everything go, including Piper's use of his belt across the back of Hogan many satisfying times and the interference of the Giant.  A weird thing happens just as the Giant has Piper up and ready for the choke slam, as a fan tries to get into the ring.  The Giant has to hold Piper up while Hogan and the ref knock the crazy trespasser out of the ring, and then Piper manages to get out of his precarious situation and send Hogan to la-la land with a sleeper hold.  The place erupts with glee, as months of pain and ignominy are avenged by the traitorous Hogan's defeat.
Of course, the best part of any WCW pay-per-view event is the commentating.  Tony Schiavone is the consummate wrestling commentator, Bobby the Brain Heenan is hilarious, and the American Dream Dusty Rhodes leaves me in stitches from start to finish.  His unique vocabulary of Rhode-isms is as funny as the best comic's material, and there is nothing more entertaining than the sound of Dream getting overly excited.  All in all, Starrcade 97 is certainly among the most memorable of the WCW pay per view events, and it is still fun to watch all these years later.",1068249600,4,5343,4.586750788643533
7857190,3,6303962424,"A few of the reviews listed refer to the 1995 Starrcade instead of the 1996 one.  The world cup between U.S. and Japan happened at the 95 Starrcade, Piper-Hogan was at Starrcade 96, so make sure you are buying the one you want.
P.S. Don't pay attention to the amount of stars I put, I haven't seen it.",1033171200,6,301,4.189655172413793
