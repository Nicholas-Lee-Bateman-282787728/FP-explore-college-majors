Having a background in machining is helpful since,using dial/digital calipers and a micrometer etc,will be necessary in building an accurate 1911.i was hoping to find something that i haven't read already or can find on the internet and highend companies DO NOT divulge ""the good stuff"". How to make and use jigs/fixtures. Exact angles/measurements on SEAR/HAMMER engagement surfaces.the importance of the V.I.S and lower lug/link in 1911s etc
Unless your using AGI instructionals,companies are not going to reveal the actual details necessary to build a custom 1911 or their competitors or people with investors could buy files,lathe,a millimg machine and duplicate their performance. Ive only found a handful of books helpful and literally almost every DVD instructional was a marketing gimmick to show you all their parts. They don't explain the necessary primary and secondary sear angle cuts or how to set up your own jigs. If you know how to work a dremel/file and use flitz polish you can bypass 2/3 of all the videos.
If your lucky enough to own a bridgeport mill,lathe or $100000 C.N.C. Machine You wouldnt need videos.
I recommend older books on 1911 customizing and is the reason why they are $60-100 because they actually have great information in them. Go onto the 1911forums or BRIANENOS forums and look up reviews before wasting your time and money. You can find better info just asking a gunsmith on the forums and save the $100 for a nice set of GROBET files or ceramic stones.",1393891200,9,1580,5.034351145038168
