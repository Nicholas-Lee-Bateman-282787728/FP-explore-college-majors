8339948,3,B001SLNPSY,"This was a very good video for a casual White Sox fan or a relatively new fan that doesn't know much about the team's history. However, for us lifelong die-hards, it could have been soooo much better, and I must admit that I was a bit disappointed. As a lifelong Sox fan, I would have loved to see more of the great Sox memories from the more distant past. For example, there's a section of the video devoted to Sox no-hitters, but it never even mentioned Joe Horlen's no no from '67, which was actually broadcast on WGN with Jack Brickhouse's great call. There was also no mention or highlights of the Sox great pennant chase from 1967 which they were in up until the final day of the season. There were also virtually none of the great highlights of the Sox from the early 70s team featuring Dick Allen, Bill Melton, and Carlos May. For example, none of the following GREAT moments in Sox history are featured here:
(1) Jack Brickhouse's WGN call of the '59 pennant-clincher against Cleveland;
(2) The Sox blowout win in Game 1 of the '59 World Series;
(3) Dick Allen's game against the Twins when he hit two inside-the-park home runs in the same game;
(4) Dick Allen's game winning home run against the Yankees in '72 which sailed 500 feet over the speakers behind the wall in dead centerfield of old Comiskey Park, and Harry Caray's wild call of it as it sailed over his head in a game that he was broadcasting from the centerfield bleachers;
(5) Highlights from the HUGE weekend series featuring the South Side Hit Men of 1977 against the Kansas City Royals in a battle for first-place in the old AL West,one of the most exciting series of the past fifty years.
(6) Carlton Fisk tagging out two Yankees at home plate on the same play;
(7) Frank Thomas' first career hit against the Brewers;
(8) Tom Seaver's 300th win;
(9) Carlos Lee's walk-off grand slam against the Cubs.
(10) The rooftop clearing home runs of Dave Nicholson, Dick Allen, Richie Zisk, Greg Luzinski, and Ron Kittle
(11) Jose Valentin's home run against the Cubs at Wrigley, and his dugout diss of Sammy Sosa;
(12) The great comeback by the Sox against the Dodgers in 2005 featuring A.J. Pierzynski's walk-off home run;
(13) Jim Thome's home-run in the ""Black-Out Game.""
(14) The final game at old Comiskey Park.

I'm sure there are a lot more, but these memories come to mind right off the top of my head.",1478908800,2,2379,4.532558139534884

8339954,5,B001SLNPSY,"There is not much print and video media when it comes to the Chicago White Sox. This DVD is a must for any hard-core White Sox fan. It is also a good introduction to the franchise for someone who does not have much knowledge of the team. If you happen to know a White Sox fan, or are related to one, this DVD would be a perfect gift for all occasions. What I liked best about this DVD is the amount of rare White Sox footage that you probably will not see anywhere else. Highly recommended (but please note that this is a lifetime White Sox fan writing this reveiw).",1252195200,10,566,4.154545454545454
