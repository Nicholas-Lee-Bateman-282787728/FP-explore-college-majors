He is so enthusiastic and so knowledgeable to help people  learn about the subject matter.  The photography was beautiful and the two discs were a pure pleasure to watch. It is hard to believe that this same energetic man with curiosity and happiness just to be travelling with the many guides is the same fastidious man of Poirot who hates to get on an airplane and gets seasick on ships.

6395240,5,B00JW3SM1A,"Tracing the footsteps of the apostle Paul as he carried the message of Christianity over 10,000 miles is a personal quest for actor David Suchet.  He approaches this as if preparing to play the role of St. Paul, by finding out as much as he possibly can about the man, his times and his surroundings.  This is a fascinating documentary from 2012, featuring David Suchet whose onscreen presence becomes the ""everyman"" allowing viewers to journey with him.  Among the bonuses to viewers are interviews with experts and dignitaries as well as hearing the stories and legends from people in the locales associated with Paul.  We feel the thrill of uncovering a portion of the West Wall as Mr. Suchet works with modern archeologists, and come to appreciate even more the actor's ability to bring to life the real person, reconstructing his persona from all of the elements of his life, and the words that he wrote.  Along with the two episode documentary, there is a twelve page viewer's guide which enhances the information and the journey.  This belongs in personal DVD collections and would make a marvelous gift to all church libraries.",1406073600,2,1135,4.885416666666667
6395241,5,B00JW3SM1A,"It could be said the Brits produce programs that examine world history better than anyone else, at least in the English speaking world. Their own history reaches so far back, even to Biblical times (the Romans in Britain), so it's no wonder, really. Add to that centuries of superior education and scholarship combined with contemporary technical skill and experience and you have an almost perfect mix of ingredients to create documentaries that are informative, educational, interesting, entertaining and enlightening.

But there is still a magic ingredient that not all of these like-minded programs have: the perfect host.

Well DAVID SUCHET IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF ST. PAUL has the perfect host--David Suchet himself. Part brilliant classical actor, part TV icon, part enthusiastic Christian and part eager student, Suchet brings a life and energy to his role as Presenter in this wonderful 2-part documentary that is seldom seen in other similar programs. Looking substantially different from his most famous role, that of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, Suchet strides where Poirot would waddle, emotes where Poirot would ruminate, and enthuses where Poirot would explain. Much as I love Suchet as Poirot, I think I love Suchet as Suchet a whole lot better.

The series really begins with what proves to be its underlying current, Suchet's fascination with St. Paul, not only as a towering historical figure, second only to Jesus in importance to the Bible's New Testament narrative, but as a potential role that he might play one day. This is what gets Suchet's creative juices flowing. Confronted with a fresco of Paul, Suchet suggests that he looks quite like Paul. In another segment he reads from a non-Biblical source what is quite possibly the only existing physical description of Paul and the similarities between the two are startling. Suchet could indeed make a convincing St. Paul should the right production ever come along. Consequently everything Suchet discovers about Paul and his world such as existing roads where Paul likely tread, or amphitheatres and small rooms where he likely preached, feeds Suchet's enthusiasm to know more about him. This is the mind of a great actor at work, gathering information about a potential role, absorbing details and delighting in sensory experiences (such as touching the foundation stones of the temple in Jerusalem, where his glee is almost child-like).

Single-minded as this may seem, Suchet is also broad-minded enough to recognize that literally every detail he can gather is important whether it is specifically useful to his actor's research or not. Thus he takes his time speaking with Jews and Muslims to learn about their perspectives about Paul. He also speaks with a number of scholars and clerics and finds even his own long-held view of some of Paul's teachings being reconsidered. In short, Suchet seeks to be as comprehensive as he can be in his search for a better overall understanding of St. Paul. We are all the richer for it, for Suchet is a supremely gifted communicator. When he reads passages of Scripture the oft-repeated words take on a new life as only a classical actor can bring to such language. That is why, arguably, classically trained actors generally make the finest Scripture readers, especially when they invest the text with the conviction that is born of genuine faith.

Ultimately, in programs such as these, there are two criteria by which they must be judged. Number one: what have I learned? and number two: I don't want it to end. Obviously if one feels they have learned pretty much all there is to know about the subject in the time allotted, it cancels out the possibility of number two, because of course it can't go on if there is no ground left to cover! Despite that quandary, I didn't want it to end and I did feel I'd learned an awful lot about St. Paul. Perhaps the next logical step is to see Suchet in this long-desired role after all? With the recent plethora of Biblical movies being produced it is hardly outside the realm of possibility.

I honestly can't think of a better sequel.",1405900800,31,4103,5.0
6395242,4,B00JW3SM1A,"Well done documentary, well narrated by Suchet, wonderful scenery of the cities where Paul the Apostle preached but the outlook was very liberal in explanation of situations in Paul's life. If you believe that the Bible is true, that it was God breathed and is totally accurate you will find many inaccuracies in interpretation. For example Paul's conversion experience on the road to Damascus is not presented as it is told in scripture.  Suchet just seems to wonder what changed Paul's mind. Seeing the cities where Paul went, Roman roads he walked, etc. was very interesting though. We are selling it now that we have viewed it.",1405555200,6,631,4.897196261682243
6395243,5,B00JW3SM1A,"IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF ST. PAUL, 2014.  Paul is likely the most significant figure in the history of Christianity after Jesus. In this authoritative, entertaining and revelatory television documentary that was made by ITV for the BBC, and will air on public television in the United States, we accompany  David Suchet, the iconic  star of AGATHA CHRISTIES POIROT, as he goes on a very personal pilgrimage around the Mediterranean to learn more about the first century man, his motives, his radical thinking, and his legacy. As the camera follows the television star through locations in the ancient Roman Empire, Israel, Turkey, Greece, Italy, and Malta, Suchet's groundbreaking search shows and tells us about the New Testament figure who was so controversial in his own time, and is, still.  This amiable documentary illuminates the life of the biblical figure and apostle who was instrumental in transforming Christianity from a small Jewish sect into a powerful global religion, by walking more than 10,000 miles, and traveling many times that number by sea. The box set comes as 2 episodes, totaling approximately 1  hours, on one DVD.  It comes with bonuses including subtitles  thank you, RLJ Entertainment-Acorn, for although veteran actor Suchets voice is sonorous and clear as a bell, he does speak to locally-accented residents on his travels.  There is also a 12-page viewer's guide with a map, a timeline of the life of St. Paul, and articles on the Roman Empire in Pauls day, Pauls final years and the writings of St. Paul, plus a biography of David Suchet. I received this review copy from Athena.

Disc 1
Episode 1
Suchet begins his quest in Jerusalem, site of the crucifixion of Jesus, the stoning death of Stephen, and Saul the Pharisee's persecution of the new Jesus movement. In Tarsus, within present-day Turkey, the actor discovers another aspect of the apostle's lifehis Roman citizenship.  The actor then goes on to the mighty ancient city of Antioch, also in modern-day Turkey, and Ephesus.  He considers the event on the road to Damascus that changed Paul's life and set him on a mission that would result in changing the world.

Episode 2
As he crosses from Asia to Europe, Suchet follows Paul's route through Greece, from Philippi and Thessalonica down to Athens and Corinth. The television detective discusses Pauls perceived misogynist attitudes toward women and concludes that, while the biblical figure was an accurate reflection of his time in his disdain for women, still, he believed the end was nigh, and felt that men and women would be treated equally before God.  The actor then visits the sites connected with Paul's last years: Jerusalem, where the apostle was arrested; Caesarea, where he was imprisoned; and Rome, where, in his 60s, the formerly Jewish Saul, now Paul, may have been executed by beheading; at any rate, the apostle disappears from the pages of scripture and into the realms of speculation and tradition.

The full-color location filming is evocative; the television star talks to us with warmth and humor.  He tells us he has been fascinated by Saint Paul for more than 25 years, and would love to have a chance to play the scriptural figure.  The hugely-popular, critically acclaimed actor, who is a converted Christian, talks to archaeologists, scholars, clerics and locals, always seeking new archaeological research and new information about the great historical figure that was so important in shaping western civilization.  Mind you, several times, Suchet also tells us he believes he physically resembles the apostle; and, be in no doubt; several times Suchets actors ego takes center stage. (As it happens, Suchet has recently completed the unparalleled feat of portraying Agatha Christies legendary little Belgian detective in all 70 stories in which he appears; the final episodes will be available through Acorn in August 2014.)  Recommended if you are interested in the performer, the locations, the period or the subject matter.",1405123200,16,3997,5.132511556240369
6395244,5,B00JW3SM1A,"My wife and I agree this is the best Athena religious documentary made to date. It makes no difference which religion you belong; there is historical education to be gleaned from this two-part DVD. Of course, Saul, becoming Paul after conversion, leads THE Christian movement to the Gentiles. Jews today recognize St. Paul's life and zeal, even if they do not fully agree with his belief. The Muslim city of Tarsus thrives as Paul's birth place.
David Suchet, esteemed London actor, primarily known for his role as Agatha Christie's Poirot, is presenter through what is a fantastically filmed tour of the places St. Paul walked to spread his witness of his faith in Jesus. The facts uncovered from experts, archeological sites, artifacts (even Paul's bones), locals, and documents all support the incredible story of the man, his mission, and continued impact on today's modern world.

SDH SUBTITLES provided.
1= The crucifixion city of Jerusalem is David Suchet's starting point in following St. Paul's steps. Also where Saul (Jewish) witnessed Stephan's stoning, in the midst of Saul's anti-Christian persecution period. Paul's roman citizenship is researched in Tarsus (Turkey). Of course a visit is the Damascus Road,  location of Paul's change from being Saul, and his new positive focus on Christianity. One man's change touched the world forever. Next Antioch, home of the term Christian, and Gentile conversions, radical theology in the 1st century. Ephesus, a 2-yr stop, characterized Paul's intensity of belief.

2= Paul's collision course with Rome came through Greece, Philippi, Thessalonica, Athens, and Corinth. David Suchet follows Paul's life: Jerusalem arrest, Caesarea prison, and the scriptural disappearance in Rome. Suchet does it all without becoming preachy, but remains an amazed investigator in an amazing person (St. Paul) and how one man's belief continues to influence civilization's faiths and politics.

Not just for Christians, for anyone studying religions.
It is a definite MUST for Christian schools and worship centers.",1402963200,41,2054,5.429467084639499

Suchet's knowledge of the apostle's life and theology is excellent, and he tracks down just the right scholars and clerics to further enlighten us.  Poirot himself couldn't have done a better piece of detective work in unraveling the mysteries surrounding the life and travels of the saint, including some facts about his life that aren't in the Bible.  My biggest surprise was hearing Suchet speak without a Belgian accent.",1501459200,,515,5.107142857142857

6395248,3,B00JW3SM1A,"I checked this out of the library and was hoping for something much more than this was. If you do not come from the belief that the Bible is God's Word and that the Holy Spirit inspired all the writers who wrote in it, you will end up with a production much like this one... All the questions asking who Paul was and why he was what he was are summed up in the Bible...because God (the Holy Trinity) found in Paul a usable vessel. How Paul spoke and believed and got through all the trials was simple...He believed on Jesus Christ and the Holy Trinity Who never left him nor forsook him... The ""incident"" on the road to Damascus is a key part, but it does not get the attention it deserves, nor does the fact that the Risen, Glorified Christ taught Paul himself. You would think that a production on who Paul was, would delve more into the spiritual as opposed to psychiatrists and the like...Paul did not have an identity crisis. Read a good authorized King James Version Bible and you will get to know the man named Paul whom God used in a mighty way. I give it 3 stars as I enjoyed the location shots of places I will never be able to visit in this lifetime and for the attempt on David Suchet's part to try to get to know Paul. Actors feel they must dissect a person they are studying to find motive and personality etc.. and that is what David is doing here, but unfortunately, with very little Biblical insight, which ultimately hurt the production for me. It had potential, but I really question some of his sources of information. Perhaps too politically correct? Something Paul never would have done...Bow to the political liberal dictates of the day.
Spread the Gospel is what he did WITH GOD'S HELP...something this production never really gets around to saying...like they are afraid to say that Jesus is/was/always will be the Messiah, and He is God and He Himself used Paul to bring the Gospel first to the Jewish and then to the Gentile... But you won't hear that here on this DVD, but the good news is every KJV Bible tells you all about it. Look to God's Word, not actors to tell you the truth. God's only begotten Son will save you, if you believe on Him and who He was/is/and alway will be and repent of your unbelief, just as Paul did. That's how Saul became Paul, thru Jesus Christ the LORD.",1498089600,,2312,4.391608391608392

Since I am a dedicated Christian, the title of this DVD set grabbed me and I had to order it. So glad I did! Mr. Suchet, a dedicated Christian himself, goes to the Holy land and begins learning from the learned locals all he can glean about the life and times of St. Paul and how he became first a Christian and then how he began traveling the land and spreading the Gospel. This is a great historical explanation of Paul's life and dedication to his life's work as a Christian teacher who spread the word and wrote some of the greatest parts of the New Testament. If you are a new or old Christian, this is an extremely valuable work on how to understand the birth and growth of Biblical teachings and how they can be used to continue spreading the Word!

6395302,5,B00JW3SM1A,"Great documentary with beautiful scenic footage and commentary by ""Poirot"" but with a different voice! Inspiring story of Paul's travels was made real with Suchet's walking in his footsteps, so to speak!!",1422662400,,204,5.40625

6395304,5,B00JW3SM1A,This was purchased as a gift for my husband and he gives it five stars.  We learned about it when we were watching the latest Poirot.  It was a worthwhile purchase and we will be buying more of the series.,1422144000,,205,4.1

6395308,3,B00JW3SM1A,"David Suchet is a wonderful narrator and the landscapes were beautiful. I had a difficult time with some of his interpretations of what happened or why they happened. Same problem with his DVD on St. Peter and ""The Story of Jesus"".",1420761600,,231,4.658536585365853

6395310,5,B00JW3SM1A,This is a surprisingly good documentary by David Suchet. It was very interesting to see places Paul may have walked and hear Suchet's (an actor) take on Paul's life. Mr. Suchet adds a real human dimension to an amazing character.,1420416000,,229,4.75
6395311,2,B00JW3SM1A,"We were very sad to find this very boring, as we have always like David Suchet's acting. Here he is at turns colorless & overly enthusiastic over obvious tourist traps. It was rather embarrassing. We were interested in seeing the locations, but there was mostly just close ups & I'm guessing that you'd see more in a real tourist video. It should be noted that the views expressed in this video are from an Atheist  world view, which assumes the premise that there is no God, so that what Paul wrote & did was prompted by his own agenda.",1420243200,7,537,4.424242424242424

6395314,5,B00JW3SM1A,"A very personal, authentic personal journey with one of our best English speaking actors. He makes a very charming host as well as he traces the steps of the man who changed Christianity from a small Jewish cult to a worldwide religion. He brings the travels and writings of St. Paul to life. Paul was never one ofmy Bible favorites, but this video helps you to appreciate just how difficult and danger ous his task was and how effective he was. I am now a great admirer of St. Paul and will read his letters with new eyes. I should mention this is not a dry lecture-it is an highly entertaining adventure as well as being educational...you will love it..",1419724800,,655,4.466666666666667

6395318,2,B00JW3SM1A,"Great locations. Suchet has a great voice & is enthusiastic about St Paul but the whole trying-not-to-offend approach was a bit labored. St Paul is a historical figure and evidences of his life are found in many locations. Paul's life took a 180 degree turn from persecutor of the Church to one of its greatest Apostles. Suchet interviews a psychologist & the answer is: ""we don't know""??",1417996800,6,388,4.8059701492537314
6395319,5,B00JW3SM1A,Excellent depiction of the journey of St. Paul. David's enthusiasm was transparent and made it all the more relevant to those of us who love St. Paul.,1417824000,,150,4.592592592592593
6395320,4,B00JW3SM1A,Pleasant enjoyable video.  Certainly not the first traipsing around after St Paul but Mamet is a good orator.,1416700800,,109,5.055555555555555

6395323,5,B00JW3SM1A,This documentary brings Paul to life for the viewer.  It fleshes out the humanity of this Apostle.  Viewing this leaves you feeling that you have spent time walking beside Paul on his journeys.  Being filmed in the area where Paul lived and worked ( and in some cases on the very roads he walked) brings a whole new level of insight.  It should be required viewing for anyone interested Acts or  any of Paul's many epistles.,1415923200,,424,4.526315789473684

6395326,5,B00JW3SM1A,"I originally borrowed this from the library and after my husband and I watched it, he said we had to get it for ourselves. David Suchet is enthusiastic and even in awe about what he shows us and what he discovers. He begins his journey in Jerusalem and then ventures through the cities of Paul's travels. We learn about the history of the cities as well as Paul's adventures while there. As David Suchet goes along he asks challenging questions that are answered by a variety of people such as scholars, tour guides, and clerics. This is a must for anyone familiar with Paul and the Bible and can be enjoyed by those who are not.",1413763200,,629,4.431034482758621
6395327,5,B00JW3SM1A,"A thoughtful study of Paul's life and travels.  Worth the price if Bible study is your passion.  For me, it becomes much easier to understand the Bible, when I am aware of the cultural and historical background.  I would certainly recommend this to any serious Bible student.",1413590400,,275,4.808510638297872
6395328,5,B00JW3SM1A,Love David Suchet.  His commentary on this DVD makes you feel just like you are there.  Others have not been so kind but I felt he had a real connection to the subject matter.,1413331200,,175,4.117647058823529
6395329,5,B00JW3SM1A,"I don't think David Suchet can do anything wrong.  HE'S A MASTER AT POIROT, OF COURSE BUT HE IS A FANTASTIC TOUR GUIDE AS PROVEN BY THE TRIP HE PERSONALLY TOOK ABOARD THE ""ORIENT EXPRESS"".  HE IS CHARM PERSONIFIED.
THAT VOICE AND HIS HANDSOME SMILE REALLY IS PERFECT FOR HOSTING MANY SHOWS TO COME, I HOPE.  LOVE HIM, HE IS TRULY A GENTLEMAN WITH A LOT OF CLASS.",1412121600,,362,4.294117647058823
6395330,5,B00JW3SM1A,"From both historical and theological perspectives, this program is definitely five stars.  The moving words of St. Paul are brought vividly to life by seeing the world as St. Paul saw it.  David Suchet's awe and humility provide just the right perspective.  Highly recommended.",1411776000,,277,5.25

6395333,5,B00JW3SM1A,I am a great fan of David Suchet so it comes as not surprise that I would like this DVD.  You can tell that he is passionate about this subject.  His enthusiasm as he travels to the places where St. Paul went clearly shows through.  I enjoyed the fact that he really identified with St. Paul even to the extent of saying he was a look alike.,1410480000,,341,4.059701492537314
6395334,5,B00JW3SM1A,"David Suchet did an excellent job tracing the journeys of the Apostle Paul.  He takes you to the cities where Paul visited and stayed.
In each location he speaks with a local college professor or two who explain Paul and his journeys from the actual location. I bought it to show in our adult Sunday School.",1410480000,,307,4.482142857142857

6395336,5,B00JW3SM1A,"This DVD was awesome as well as inspirational. Not  only was the commentary excellent as presented by David Suchet but the background scenery of the deserts, the antiquities and the magnificent views were brilliant. It is a DVD I saw on PBS several times and it inspired me to buy a copy of my own.",1409788800,,298,4.418181818181818

6395339,5,B00JW3SM1A,"David Suchet does an excellent job of introducing us to the paths St. Paul followed almost 2,000 years ago.  He meets some interesting and knowledgeable people, who shed additional light on understanding this charismatic evangelist.  Suchet always delves deeply into whatever character he plans to portray, until he thoroughly understands him.  He does the same thing here, with Saul of Tarsus.
Suchet covers the life and journeys of the far-traveling Apostle fairly thoroughly (Malta may be an exception).  As he immerses himself in those locations, he helps to create the atmosphere the evangelists would have experienced on their visits.
This DVD is an inspirational journey that sheds considerable insights into the character and life of one of the great shapers of history.  Suchet is outstanding as our gracious and entertaining host.",1409270400,3,840,5.3816793893129775

6395343,4,B00JW3SM1A,"Interesting, but some of the ""experts"" Suchet interviews come across as lightweights in their expertise.
