1807987,5,B00007FCTP,"What an epiphany I have had.  The ""Wiggles Magical Adventure"" is one of the greatest musicals I have ever seen.  Originally released in 1997 (the same year my third wife left me over an incident in Baton Rouge), this song and dance show is 70 minutes of unadulterated joy.  These Wiggles have enthusiasm, laughs, melody, and a message.
I was extremely uplifted as I watched the plot play itself out and a birthday celebrated.  The songs are splendidly woven into the plot (and I don't want to give too much away, but the plot is basically about a thief getting caught and a surprise birthday for the lovable Dorothy the Dinosaur) and they are very catchy.  I couldn't help singing along as I made the 70-minute drive from my fourth ex-wife's house home with the kids for a long weekend.  The kids enjoyed it almost as much as I did!  And it never gets old--I have watched this truly ""Magical Adventure"" at least nine times and still shout for joy as Dorothy finally realizes the Wiggles remembered her birthday!!!  A wonderful musical and well-suited for just about everyone.  I can't recommend this highly enough.  Bravo Wiggles!!!",1047254400,2,1132,4.729591836734694
1807988,3,B00007FCTP,"My Son Loves the Wiggles but this movie was a bit too much for him.  He sat through about half the movie, and I think that is because he is tired.  The movie was nothing like the wiggles videos not that we expected that it would be.  I imagine that when my 18 mos old gets older he will love this movie but for now I would say that if you have a child under 3 you would be better off waiting on this video.  Now to the adults, before I say this let it be known that we are Wiggles fans in the house but for the adults this was boring.  While a few moments might have been entertaining on the whole this was an incredibly hard movie to sit through.  Usually I find the Wiggles excellent childrens entertainment and not too hard on adults but for me after watching this all I could think was I am glad that is over.  I still give it three stars as good children's entertainment and will probably give it 5 stars when it gets my son to sit still for a full 70 minutes.",1047081600,2,965,3.9689119170984455
1807989,3,B00007FCTP,"This was a nice addition to our Wiggles library, although the production values are a bit cheesy and the subplot involving the magic wand theft didn't keep my son's attention.  I suspect he'd have preferred more nonstop singing and dancing like the other videos.  Contains their hits, though, and the Wiggles as always are sincere and endearing and frenetic.",1046736000,,358,5.0508474576271185
1807990,5,B00007FCTP,"After collecting all the Wiggles tapes and DVDs we had to add this one as soon as it became available.  It was an immediate hit with our 21 month old son.  He is only now starting to work on his speaking and we found this tape to be a big help.  My thinking (such as it is)is that he finds the conversation easier to immitate than the singing.  Whatever the appeal of this movie is for him, we all enjoy the new renditions of our all time favorite Wiggles tunes and the few new songs as well.",1046649600,,492,4.041237113402062
1807991,5,B00007FCTP,"This movie was made in 1997. It is very good and my 2 1/2 year old girl loves it! It is fun, funny, magical and musical. It is filmed like a real movie and not like The Wiggles other videos.
In the movie The Wiggles are planning a surprise birthday for Dorothy the Dinosaur. Wally the magician hears the singing and sneaks over to see what's going on. He steals Greg's magic wand and Dorothy goes after it. She follows Wally around after the wand gets broken looking to see who can fix it for Greg and trying to find someone who remembers her birthday, which she believes The Wiggles forgot. Wally believes he can not do magic without the wand, but later he realizes he must only believe in himself to win the magic contest. The Wiggles then set out to find Dorothy while the surprise birthday party is being prepared for 6 pm that night. The Wiggles and Dorothy and Wally both have adventures on their journeys. Along the way there is singing and dancing galore! Finally, after Wally wins the magic competition by believing in himself, he and Dorothy arrive at The Wiggles house and to the party. They all sing and dance with joy. It's really is a feel good magical adventure. Even parents will love it! A must have!",1044921600,6,1217,4.4375
1807992,5,B00007FCTP,"One of the great things about The Wiggles is that their zany style seems to appeal to many adults, as well as to the children who are their main focus.  Of course, you either like them, or you don't.  If you do, this video will make your Wiggly library complete.
This movie is deffinitely one that will appeal to the adult set, as well, providing they enjoy the usual zany Wiggles style.  It has a cute storyline, and is packed with laughs from beginning to end.
Since it is a movie, and not the usual short-segmented music video, don't necessarily expect your very young toddler to sit through the show in its entirety.  He or she will enjoy some of the usual Wiggle fare, though.  It's loaded with new songs and lots of laughter.
Dorothy the Dinosaur sets out to catch the thief of Greg's magic wand.  Meanwhile, The Wiggles are planning a surprise party for Dorothy, who thinks that everyone has forgotten her birthday.",1044835200,12,922,4.557575757575758
1807993,5,B00007FCTP,"Over the past 3 years we have been watching all the Wiggles movies and my kids love these guys. They sit for hours watching, singing and dancing along.
The Wiggles Magic Adventure is a great time for the kids. Lasting over a hour in length you find some new songs as well as some real favorites like Point your Fingers, Dorothy Would you like to Dance with Me? and Hot Potatoes.
It was an enjoyable time watching the Wiggles search for Dorothy and  and Wally the Great as Wally tries to wins a Magic competition. You'll find yourself routing for the underdog in this one.
Overall very enjoyable and for the price it's a very good buy. While this video has been out in Australia for a couple of years now it is certainly different than any other Wiggles Video we have.",1044576000,8,767,4.401408450704225

The general consensus that it's a flawed visionary experience hasn't changed much over the years, so Coppola now brings us ""The Wiggles Magical Adventure Redux,"" a new version that's been slightly re-edited and includes an additional 45 minutes of never-before-seen footage.

The results are just as decidedly mixed as the original, with moments of astounding technical achievement and dreamlike power rising above poorly focused metaphysical posturing.",1422748800,,605,5.722222222222222

My older son got it as a present for his 3rd birthday 5 years ago, and would watch it everyday.  Then my younger son started watching it a couple years later, and loved it even more that my first.  If your kids love the Wiggles, then this movie is a must have.  It is refreshing to watch a Wiggle production that has a story line and incorporates the music into the movie.

My favorite part is when they go down Breezy Street (or something like that) and come out frozen - Murray looks so funny!  I also like when they are wondering what Jeff is dreaming about, turns out he's dreaming about being a cow!  I laughed out loud the first time I saw that part.

1808075,2,B00007FCTP,"My 2 yr. old and I picked this as one of our first Wiggle DVD. We've only watched a few episodes on TV and my daughter loved them.  Unfortunately, this movie was a bore.  There were a few short parts that kept my daughters attention (some of the craziness and the Hot Potato song which was sung by children not the Wiggles).  She kept saying, ""next song"" because there is quite a bit of dialogue and foolery between songs which she wasn't interested in.

Then he got into Blue's Clues, Dora, etc. but would still ask for it every once in a while. Now he's back on the Wally kick again. Fortunately, it's a quality movie with great song & dance numbers.

For some reason, I am not allowed to participate in the dancing (NO, Mommy...no dancing!).  I still enjoy watching it with him & if he won't let me dance along, at least I can get some housework done while he's watching.....",1131494400,3,576,4.133928571428571

Not only did I think it would be more economical to purchase but I noticed that my toddler was dancing and singing along with the catchy melodies and well choreographed dances that accompany just about every scene in the movie (O.K., I have to admit, I danced along with him).

The story line is about an aspiring magician named ""Wally"" who needs a magic wand to win a local magic competition. Ironically the prize is also a magic wand that once belonged to his great grandfather, ""Waldo the Great"". Wally steals Greg's magic wand in passing by a Wiggles show for some children. Witnessing this, Dorothy chases after him. Meanwhile the Wiggles ( Greg, Anthony, Murray and Jeff) spend the day looking for Dorothy and getting ready for her surprise birthday party.

There is lots of action and songs with Captain Feathersword and his crew and Wags the Dog.

Well, from the second I put it on, my son was transfixed with ""Wally"". Since we have bought it, Parker has memorized all the songs, dance moves, and dialogue. He loves it so much, we bought the CD soundtrack that has taken up permanant residence in the car. The songs are so catchy, my husband and I don't even mind that practically every waking moment is taken up by singing one song or another from this movie. A year and a half later, and we are still not tired of it. While the production values are horrid--the lip-synching in the last segment is kind of freaky, etc.--I don't think a little kid will really care. The message of the movie is a good one. Wally steals, then breaks, Greg's magic wand. The rest of the movie, Wally and Dorothy attempt to fix the wand and return it to Greg. When he has asked, ""Mommy, what is Wally doing?"" my son and I have had some good discussions about how it is not nice to take other people's things.

1808104,5,B00007FCTP,"My 20-month-old always wants to watch this video. I've tried Disney, Barney and other videos, but this is the one she wants. She says approx. 50 words and one of them is ""Wally"". She'll sit through the entire movie, which is an impossible feat for any other video. Even other Wiggles videos don't have the same addictive properties.
As an adult, I found it much less annoying than Barney or Elmo, but I've watched it with my daughter more times than I care to remember. I hope Wally comes back in a sequel, so I can at least have a little variety in my evenings :)",1069200000,2,564,4.330188679245283
1808105,2,B00007FCTP,"I'll have to admit that my favorite Wiggle, Greg, had been very careless when he informed Dorothy to hold his wand for a while and look after it.  Both, Greg and Dorothy, didn't know about this one other person who's really not a magician-he's Greg's enemy.  I think that stealing Greg's wand is like threating to kill him, and become the next Magician King in the Wiggles World.",1067472000,2,379,4.5588235294117645
1808106,3,B00007FCTP,"My 3 year old son is a huge Wiggles fan, and planning to dress up as a magician for Halloween, so we were very excited to get this DVD.  Thought it would be the perfect motivator for his creativity for the costume.  Disappointing though... Greg only appears as a magician for maybe 90 seconds.  The bulk of the movie concentrates on Dorothy and a new character (Wally the Magician).  It does have a good story line and some fun songs, but most disappointing is the lack of an appearance of the actual Wiggles.  The 4 guys appear briefly throughout the movie, but do not sing and dance as much as other videos.",1063584000,6,609,4.401785714285714
1808107,1,B00007FCTP,"My almost 2 year old son loves the Wiggles, but this movie was not for him.  I agree that this movie should be labeled for ages 3 and up.  That magician was just too scary for him.  We only have one other Wiggles dvd, ""Yummy Yummy"" which he loves (except for those puppets!)
The Wiggles are great for the 18 months to 3 year olds as long as they keep singing and wiggling!  That scary magician was just too wierd.  We couldn't even finish the movie.",1058745600,3,449,4.174418604651163
1808108,5,B00007FCTP,"I have a 2 yr old who absolutely loves the wiggles.  He has this one and the PlayTime and Safari and all are great.  This one has a cute little story but most importantly, lots of great tunes!  He loves to sing along and knows all the moves.  There is lots of time with Captain Feathersword, Wags and Dorothy too.  Fabulous movie that I don't mind watching with him over and over.  He gets some wonderful exercise and has a blast!  We know all the songs and really enjoy them.  If you've been taping the shows and think it's the same, it isn't.  The movie offers so much more.  Really is worth the purchase.  Safari is fun too - with lots of new songs that are really fun.  Plus teaches about animals.  We love the Wiggles in our house.  This movie is worth the price!",1057795200,,768,4.206896551724138
1808109,4,B00007FCTP,"My son is 22 months old, he just LOVES this DVD!  If I would let him he would watch it all the time.  He literally could watch it over and over again!  It really holds his attention and he really loves all the songs and characters.  He gets up and dances to the songs and when there isn't a song playing he sits very quietly and watches every move the Wiggles make.",1055116800,,365,4.027777777777778
1808120,2,B00007FCTP,"My two year old loves the Wiggles, and this seemed from the description to be a good pick.  It wasn't.  Here's the story...Thinking that no one has remembered her birthday, Dororthy the Dinosaur says ""what the heck"" and takes off on adventures with an annoying actor who plays a failed magician.  Meanwhile, the Wiggles are secretly preparing a surprise party for her.  The whole thin ""misunderstanding"" plot is wrapped up at the happy ending, though.
Not only does the video pad out a thirty minute storyline into an excrutiating seventy+ minutes, it does so with no good songs for the kids!  Worse, the Wiggles themselves have been shoved into a ""preparing the party and looking for Dorothy"" subplot!  Needless to say, my daughter was looking to play puzzles after twenty minutes of this boring feature.
Bottom line, the Wiggles are much better when they are the stars of the show.  They are also better in ""sketch-type"" video compliations, where parents can shut them off without interrupting any ""plot"" to play with their children, instead of having the TV babysit them for an hour and a half.  Truly, you can't go wrong with any of the earlier Wiggles videos, which have better songs to boot.  If you want a more recent pick, go for Wiggles Safari.  The guest star here, Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin, is actually very ingratiating and interesting and doesn't hog up all the screen time. Unlike the irritating Wally the Magician here.",1054252800,2,1438,4.85655737704918
1808121,1,B00007FCTP,"My 2 year old son is a huge Wiggles fan, of both the show and all the other videos.  This is unlike any of the other videos. If you have an older child who is a fan, they might like it, but for a 2 year old, it was just too deep/ (I never thought I would use that phrase for the Wiggles)",1052179200,2,287,3.5555555555555554
1808122,5,B00007FCTP,"Once I pried my daughter's 5 year old hands off the Wiggle's safari tape,  I finally got her to watch this movie, now she is like ""what took me so long???""  Sure the songs are all old hat, we all know them by heart, but they really put them in the story well.  They start the song and the child really feels like they know what is going to happen, not to mention they ""redo"" the songs a bit so they aren't so old.  Also there are a few good lessons on being a good person and a great friend, how can I argue with that????  I love this movie and so does my kid, we really enjoy watching this together.  Go for it, buy it, I'm sure they will like it.  Also, god bless the wiggles for being able to sing those songs over and over with such a sincere smile on their face, it has to get excruciating!",1050710400,2,795,3.93125
1808123,4,B00007FCTP,"My 22-month-old loves this movie (""WallyWallyWally,"" as she calls it--a reference to the theme song about the film's protagonist), and she will gladly sit through it several times straight through if I allow her to.  Initially, I was surprised.  She adores The Wiggles, and we own quite a few of their videos.  Yet, at her age, her attention span is short, and she typically gets up and leaves the room after just a few songs, regardless of which tape she's watching.
So, when I sat down to watch this with her the first time and saw that it was a traditional movie, with dialogue and plot, I didn't expect much.  But for some reason, it holds her interest, and she does her best to explain to me what's going on in the simple but pleasant story (regarding a sad-sack magician, Dorothy's disappearance on her birthday, and The Wiggles' efforts to find her in time for her surprise party).
After a few viewings, the film began to remind me more than a little of ""Barney's Great Adventure,"" which my son became similarly addicted to five years ago.  The two have a lot in common--similar plots and production, simple set dressings featuring bold colors, slapstick comedy, cheesey special effects, etc.  But I would rather watch this film any day than that one, as I suspect most parents would.
The film isn't great, but it's not horrible, either.  And over time, it's more likely to hold the kids' interest than the monotony of the song-collection videos from the group.",1050624000,13,1468,4.7109375
