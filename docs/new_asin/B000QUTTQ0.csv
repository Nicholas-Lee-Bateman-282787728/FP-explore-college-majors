2842392,4,B000QUTTQ0,"I THOUGHT THIS SEASON WAS GOOD. IT JUMPED AROUND AT TIMES AND LEFT US HANGING ON SOME ISSUES, BUT OTHER THAN THAT I LIKED IT. I THOUGHT THE MICHELLE CHARACTER WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR CHRISTIAN IF HE WAS REALLY READY TO SETTLE DOWN. THEY BOTH HAVE SKELETONS IN THEIR CLOSET. THE ISSUE OF COLOR MADE NO DIFFERENCE. I THOUGHT JULIAN AND SANAA HAD GREAT CHEMISTRY. THIS CHARACTER WAS THE ONLY ONE BESIDES KIMBER THAT HE HAD A CONNECTION WITH AND ACTUALLY HAD MEANINGFUL SEX WITH.. I ALSO THOUGHT THE WRITING OF THE DISRESPECT THAT HE SHOWED TOWARD KIMBER WAS NOT NECESSARY. POOR SEAN JUST COULDN'T CATCH A BREAK. I WAS SAD TO SEE JULIA GO. I KNOW SHE'LL BE BACK. THIS SEASON WILL DEFINITLY MAKE MY COLLECTION. CHRISTIAN IS HOT!!! AS USUAL. HE MAKES UP FOR WHAT IT LACKS AT TIMES.",1188518400,,776,4.471830985915493
2842393,3,B000QUTTQ0,"What can you say? there were some terriffic IDEAS explored.. bt the over all arc just didn't feel like it was solidly in place this season, sadly. and theer were alot of just.. call backs that felt.. just.. there to remind you how much BETTER the show was, sadly the move to Hollywood is anth- what the show was SUPPOSED to be about from the beginning according to the creator, although I will admit they've lined up some fantastic guest stars.

Season 4 though.. just felt wrong.. without the strength of the Carver mystery which really helped season 3, which was sadly not up to the first 2 intense seasons, season 4 just falls kind of flat on the floor.. and most of the events happening are just there to propel th the finale with Christian and Sean becoming Hollywood flesh merchants.. there were some nice character moments, like looking for a kidney donor for Liz.. BUT, sadly the hamfisted treatment of returning characters (like the drug dealer, there was a shock.. he was behing it ALL.. shocker eh?) and the real mishanging of the return of Merill Bobolit.. seems highly unlikely these characters who have been there since the early days (first season) of the show will put in appearances outside of the more.. dream like appearances (as Megan O'Hara did, again since her actual death in season 1).

Still this season. while it had its moments felt much of a let down.. and just felt a profound LOSS of something. Perhaps with all the big storylines gone, and returning more to the average, it still comes nowhere near the first 3 (yes even three had some great, if wholly unbelivable twists). Season 4 felt more as if it were just going through the motions, like 24 has the previous 2 seasons, while seasons 2 and 3 repeated the CLICHES that really haunted the last 2 seasons, at least the seasons before found ways to make them interesting.. and the writing and casting was just THERE..

Sadly though.. there just felt like the writing wasn't quite there, and as someone else said.. dropped plot lines, I was hoping to see more of a.. not emerging homosexual crush as it was at first implied.. but the younger Doctor played by Mario Lopez taking Christian out.. and Christian at some point.. realizing he isn't that age anymore.. which felt like one of the things the series at times TRIED.. that Christian resnted the younger doctor and it felt that this was dropped.. as was the crazy shrink played by Brooke Shields (just.. didn't feel finished), how about a return of Abby Mayes from season 3 which was one of the more.. interesting and creepy episodes.. season 4 is a must for all fans.. but felt more a set up for season 5, which I still have high hopes for.. FX makes, simply, the BEST shows on TV with this.. Rescue Me, and The Shield... amazing programming, and its ok to stumble.. let's just hope they pick thsmselves up and score.",1188259200,4,2854,4.6031434184675835
2842394,4,B000QUTTQ0,"Season 3 was dreadful and season 4 was.....Great!
I was so happy that my show was back after the lows of season 3. The most evident change is the return of humor and action that made 1&2 so fun to watch. I will admit that the show has gone kind of ""Alley Mcbeal""(descending into preposterous unbelievable territory.)But they have to keep the story development going and thats tough considering the situations the characters have already been through.

I doubt Nip Tuck will ever shock us again like season one did but season 4 is a great watch even for the initiated.",1187654400,,567,4.6138613861386135
2842395,5,B000QUTTQ0,I will say this season was a little more watered down than the others have been it seemed like. I think I speak for a lot of fans when i say i didn't like michelle at all but other than that still by far the best show on tv with the best two main characters.,1187136000,,258,3.709090909090909
2842396,4,B000QUTTQ0,"let me start off by saying Nip/Tuck is my fav show ever
I have never liked a show as much as I do Nip/Tuck I do
think that both Dirt and Rescue Me are trying to give
Nip/Tuck a run for its money....

Nip/Tuck has went downhill fast since season 2's finale
after ""The Carver"" the show has went nowhere and has
limped along I always watch each new season (as I did season 4)
hoping for this show to return to its roots and it has yet to
turn around...

With that being said FX networks has terriffic programing
and Nip/Tuck could change at any episode so I continue to
watch every episode and every rerun and I continue to preorder
every season on DVD as I have this one =)",1187049600,,671,4.075757575757576
2842397,4,B000QUTTQ0,"These idiots are talking about plastic surgery, oh no it destroys the human being. Shut up! This is a show about more than plastic surgery, it's about family, relationships, love, lust, lies and yeah I'll admit sometimes they went over the top. Who cares, if you are a loyal viewer then you would see these things. Nothing is perfect. I will continue to watch this show and I will buy season four just like I bought the rest. If you had a problem with season four don't bother watching season five because you won't go in excited about the show being back but you will look for every reason to cut it open without sewing it back up.",1184544000,9,632,4.364406779661017
2842398,2,B000QUTTQ0,"As a die-hard nip/tuck lover, think I speak for a lot of fans when I say season 4 was a major disappointment. I wanted so badly to like it and kept tuning in each week in hopes that the next episode would redeem the last. Alas, it never happened and only became increasingly frustrating to watch. Ultimately, the only reason to watch this season was the fact that it is nip/tuck after all (edgy, intelligent and still worlds better than most television) and viewers like myself have most likely invested a lot of time in prior seasons already. Understandably, it had to be difficult to keep up the intensity of seasons 1 & 2 but the show's slip that began in season 3 was acutely magnified in season 4. Poorly written plotlines and undeveloped new characters, both of no interest whatsoever, plagued the show and it seems that creator Ryan Murphy was perhaps too busy with other projects (Running with Scissors) to keep a watchful eye on the quality/progression of his baby.

For people who have not yet seen it, please don't ruin an otherwise enjoyable experience by having any expectations of season 4.",1181520000,46,1104,4.690721649484536
2842399,5,B000QUTTQ0,"As the fourth season of Nip/Tuck begins, things are actually looking up for plastic surgeons Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) and Christian Troy (Julian McMahon).  Sean and his wife Julia (Joely Richardson) are back together with a new baby on the way, and Christian is, well, being Christian.  However, things soon take a downward turn in a big way which marks big changes for the partnership, as well as for Sean and Christian.  Julia learns the baby will be born with some debilitating defects, which leads to her and Sean splitting again as well as some affairs, while a wealthy patient (Larry Hagman) purchases the business and Christian falls in love with his younger trophy wife (Sanaa Lathan), who is also involved in an organ harvesting ring with a dangerous femme fatale (Jacqueline Bisset).  Not to mention that Matt (John Hensley) joins Kimber (Kelly Carlson) in scientology, which actually seems to help him out, for a while anyway.  Christian also gets a pleasent surprise in getting back custody of baby Wilbur as things appear to look up again, but not for long.  This season has plenty of guest stars as well, including Kathleen Turner, Mario Lopez, Alanis Morissette, and Peter Dinklage; and sets the stage for the series to go in a new direction as Sean and Christian leave Florida behind for the star studded, and plastic surgery laced, land of Hollywood.  All in all, the fourth season of Nip/Tuck is another superb season of one of the best shows on cable TV, and if you're a fan, picking up this DVD collection is a no brainer.",1179964800,39,1545,4.785714285714286
2842400,5,B000QUTTQ0,"I think season 4 of niptuck is the best one yet.

2842662,3,B000QUTTQ0,"Nip/Tuck is still rather crazy and many things are always happening to these characters season to season.

This time we deal with the controversial topics of disabled children (before they are born) with Julian and Sean, Christian's new relationship with they new boss, Michelle, and her own murky past.

The drama seems forced and after the carver, the new ""kidney stealer"" thing sort of seems to pale in comparison. However, Julia and Sean and the situation with their baby is pretty heartfelt; they did a good job with this. Julia's later relationship with her Nanny, not as appealing, especially after all this couple has gone through. Sean is no exception to having an affair though. Quick to judge rather than also be what he is criticizing.

Many of the characters kind of made me angry at their stupidity this season, but it does have its good points.",1296691200,,859,4.829931972789115
2842663,5,B000QUTTQ0,"While perhaps not up to par with its preceding seasons, Nip/Tuck's 4th still delivers the goods - sex, violence, drama. The Blu-ray set looks stunning with some really vibrant colours and above average audio. Short review conclusion: if you are a fan of the show, this is a no-brain purchase.

***** Important note about other reviews *****

2842780,4,B000QUTTQ0,"Many people did not like this season of Nip/Tuck because of the weird twists and turns that occurred throughout this season. Unlike season three (Nip/Tuck's weakest season), season four is very entertaining at times. Even though very few episodes are boring, it always rises back up. This season deals with Macnamara/Troy being under new ownership by a woman and her elderly and sexually impotent husband. Later on, the two plastic surgeons move their practices to Hollywood, California, after experiencing so many ills this season. These of which include Matt marrying ex-porn starlet Kimber, Christian falling in love with the new woman in charge, a multiple of kidney thefts, the return of Escobar Gallardo, Julia giving birth to a son with a disability and Julia & Sean renewing their wedding vows, only to disregard that by having extramarital affairs with some whacked-out characters. This season guest stars Mo'nique, Sanaa Lathan, Jacqueline Bissett, Brooke Shields, Kathleen Turner, Rosie O'Donnell, etc.

My favorite episodes [10/15]:
# 1. Cindy Plumb - Sean becomes distraught after he discovers that Julia's unborn baby will have a rare disability. Sean and Christian sell their business to a new ownership, by a woman named Michelle (Sanaa Lathan) and her rich and elderly husband, Burt. Christian questions his sexuality and seeks a therapist.
# 2. Blu Mondae - Matt is influenced by a reformed Kimber to join a new religion: Scientology. Annie is caught making a mockery of her brother's disability. The doctors' latest pre-bono surgeries come under Michelle's fire. Liz discovers a shocking secret about Michelle.
# 3. Monica Wilder - Michelle feels threatened when Liz tries talking to her about what she saw. Sean and Julia try hiring nannies. Sean sleeps with the female nanny. They hire a male nanny who will also turn their relationship upside down. Julia gives birth to the baby.
# 4. Shari Noble - A female patient uses peanut butter to seduce her dog. Christian blackmails Michelle. Sean considers sleeping with Monica Wilder again, but resists. Escobar Gallardo is haunting Sean's conscience.
# 5. Dawn Budge - An overweight woman wins the lottery, gets liposuction and loses everything she has that money cannot buy. Sean and Christian bribes Matt to leave Scientology with a Porsche, only to hire deprogrammers. Sean and Julia renew their wedding vows.
# 6. Faith Wolper, PhD - A heartbroken, vengeful Burt finds out about Michelle's sexual relationship with Christian and uses it against them. Monica Wilder is stalking Sean and that comes to a very tragic end. Christian's therapist shows her devotion to him, in an odd way.
# 7. Burt Landau - Christian and Michelle have had enough of Burt controlling them. Matt and Sean debate on who should be Liz's kidney donor. Dawn Budge is earjacked. Christian plays a cruel mind game with Kimber, hurting her one last time before she gets revenge: She gets closer to Matt to spite Christian.
# 10. Merrill Bobolit - Matt and Kimber are married and his two fathers are livid. Everyone sees that Kimber is manipulating Matt except him. Merrill Bobolit is released from prison and has a disturbing secret to expose about his time in prison. Sean and Julia both discover they have been cheating on each other.
# 14. Willy Ward - Wilber is back in Christian's life and while Christian and Michelle gain custody of him, Wilber's biological mother is back, fighting for custody, causing friction and expressing her hostility toward Michelle.
# 15. Gala Gallardo - The season finale: Escobar Gallardo meets his fate. Christian discovers the truth about Michelle and her involvement in the organ harvest. The practice moves to Hollywood, California.",1229990400,,3711,5.093596059113301

2842782,5,B000QUTTQ0,"I almost did not buy this season after being disappointed in Season 3 (I thought it was too weird, and unrealistic).  I was shocked when Season 4 got even more weird!  However, I was actually more shocked to realize that I was having a great time watching it (I usually do not like shows when they get way outside of the box).  This season was extremely well written, and I would definitely recommend it.  This is the season that got me back on the Nip Tuck Bandwagon.

Season 1 and 2 were great,  3 was tedious,  but I still had hope for the 4th.

What in the world happened?  The storylines in this season were so weak,  you could drive a Mack truck through the holes!!  I found myself wishing episodes would be over and looking at the clock,  something I never did before.

2842809,4,B000QUTTQ0,"Love it or hate it, ""Nip Tuck"" cannot be ignored and season four is one of this series' best seasons (probably just pipped at the post by season two and miles ahead of the  Carver dominated season 3) The level of adventurous (if at times idiotic) incidents in this series is unparalleled . ""Nip Tuck"" just take risks, the actors take risks, the guests take risks , does Julian McMahon , incidentally, have it in his contract that he has to bear his butt  at least ten times in any one season???????

 It's all nonsense of course, but such believable nonsense and when, every so often (as in the scene between Dylan and the tramp) it touches on some real emotional truths, the result is  gut wrenching. This series will go down in history as one of unique bravery and what a high camp joy to have people of the ilk of Larry Hagman, Jacqueline Bisset, Kathleen Turner, Brooke Shields and Rosie O Donnell (best film work she has ever done and the funniest ) and of course Catherine Deneuve in one season. A wild, wacky, wonderful ride, don't miss it. Shame Season 5 is incomplete and this may stop its release on DVD till the unscreeened eps hit the US airwaves in early 09.",1218412800,,1171,4.427906976744186

2842812,2,B000QUTTQ0,"Oh BOY...how can a show that I love change in mere Seasons? I vowed last season that I would not watch anymore unless the writing improved. But oh boy, things have only gotten worse. A show that use to capitalize on grit and glamour, now appears to merely be trying to cover-up bad writing with sex and frankly more sex. I decided to just catch up on the entire season, give the show another chance, and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, I had trouble stomaching it. It was just too much. Storylines involving birth defects and organ thefts, and other issues have finally made me reconsider watching the show. The only redeeming value for the show was the return of the tattooed man. It appears that a show about the superficial has become just that. Perhaps a return to those original thoughts and ideas for the show will bring new life into the series. I guess the ultimate question is ""Will I give Season 5 a chance""?  Probably not unless someone tells me that the old fire is back.

still lingers the convict Escogobar. Christrian finally falls in love this time with the much under-rated Sanaa Lathan as Michelle and much turmoil succeeds because of it. Matt finally grows up but still fails at his worst with women. Sean and Julia can't seem to make things work no matter what and you so want them to due to the birth of Connor. Corruptness, many things that are illegal and much inner speculating of the 2 Dr's biggest things on everybodys mind ""are they gay"". This season also spouts the popular Mario Lopez shower scene and that chic from MTV Idalis surprises everyone w/her acting ability. Season 4 probably has the BEST guest stars, such as Larry Hagman, Alanis Morriset, Kathleen Turner, Melissa Gilbert, Mario Lopez, Monique, and former supermodels Jacqueline Bessit and Brooke Shields.

To my surprise, it was better than Season 3 and much better than 5, but not quite as good as Seasons 1 and 2 (IMHO Season 2 is the best). The good: (1) a great examination of Christian and Sean's relationship (as a result of Christian's therapy sessions), (2) a large number of great guest stars, (3) excellent resolution at the end of the season of many storylines, (4) the return of many characters from the past seasons, (5) still compelling drama and the occasional humor, ; The bad: (1) Sean/Julia - it is very tedious having a couple break up/cheat/get back-together/cheat/break-up....",1210636800,2,804,4.462585034013605

2842853,4,B000QUTTQ0,"Let me preface this review by saying that I have been a huge fan of ""Nip/Tuck"" since its inception. I have even converted a few of my friend into true fans as well. The craziness of this series pushes the envelope just enough but never goes completely over the edge, & I am always entertained. However, Season 4 is not as good as the ""Nip/Tuck"" that I have come to expect. Following up the Carver of the previous seasons (even though that big revelation ended up a bust) must have been a difficult job. The major story arc this time around involves Christian's new girlfriend Michelle & her madame, James. The entire storyline is pretty boring. The answers are given away pretty early on in the season, & we are left to wait until Christian finds out.

Some minor storylines that were good involved Sean's new son having a birth defect. We also learn more about Sean's past, & his relationship with Julia continues its bumpy ride. I won't spoil that ending here. There is another minor storyline that includes Matt & Kimber, which is interesting at first but seems to fizzle out. Liz also gets a little more development this season, which I was happy to see. To me, she is an irreplaceable character & one who makes the series.

For fans of the show, this season could be a letdown after the superb first 3 seasons, but ""Nip/Tuck is still easily one of the best show out there.",1209686400,,1377,4.504

2842882,5,B000QUTTQ0,"Spoilers below!

This season has it all:  great guest stars from Brooke Shields to Brenda Vacarro to Larry Hagman to Kathleen Turner; the return of little Wilber;
the demise of the vicious yet tragically miserable James; the ongoing Scientology issues between Matt and Kimber; the death of the terrifying Escobar Gallardo at the hands of someone we would not have suspected; the painful yet inevitable break-up of the MacNamaras; and a move across the country for the two surgeons.

I especially liked the continuity of various story arcs and characters:  Wilber's bio-mom returns briefly; Gallardo makes his last attempts at crime and blackmail; when Christian moves out of his apartment, he says an imaginary goodbye to many women we have come to know; and then he finds a way to rejoin Sean even when the latter moves all the way to CA to try to redefine himself without his best friend/business partner.

That last point brings up another strength of this season and of the series:  From the beginning, Sean and Christian have loved each other as best friends do but have had their differences, fights, arguments, estrangement, conflicts, ethical dilemmas, jealousy, competition, and more.  Yet they find ways to keep coming back together, despite the threats to their careers, the women in their lives, the various criminals they have been forced to deal with, and more.  There's even a funny bit involving Christian's non-sexual attraction to Sean, and some touching yet amusing scenes in ""Diana Lubey,"" in which Sean tries to make the very hetero Christian think that being gay is okay (after having been misled by psychiatrist Brooke Shields).  And if there's one person in the world who isn't gay, it's Dr. Troy!

2842968,4,B000QUTTQ0,"You know a season is completely nuts when one of the most sane plot points is about an Organ Harvesting Ring!!  This show is SO deliriously over the top...I just had a blast.  Watching it, my wife and I often found ourselves just looking at each other and shaking our heads in disbelief.  Can you imagine that if people in ""real life"" had to endure what Sean, Christian and company had to endure, they'd have long since died of strokes or heart attacks or just plain stress!

The show makes the machinations in everything from DALLAS to DYNASTY to SIX FEET UNDER look like perfectly normal, even boring occurences.

I love this show because it not only doesn't fear being outrageous, it THRIVES on it.  Dylan Walsh and Julian McMahon have the perfect blend of well-rooted and skillful acting, with just a dash of over-the-top over-acting.  Not for one minute is the show ""believable,"" but it draws us in nonetheless, thanks in large part to the skill of the two main actors.  They are a joy to watch, both as characters and performers.  I particulary like Christian Troy.  Never more than in this season have we seen his blend of totally self-serving boorishness (and cruelty) peppered with true, honest feelings.  He has a new love in this season, and theirs is a complicated relationship that you root for...even though you know it probably won't go well.

Meanwhile, Sean McNamara and his wife Julie are expecting a child, whom they discover has a very rare birth defect, and they must grapple with the preparations for that, and then the aftermath of the birth.  This is actually fairly touching and when little Connor arrives, we truly feel for a darling little baby saddled with such a horrible defect.  But in true NIP/TUCK form, into this fairly credible development comes a nanny in the form of a ""little person"" (Peter Dinklage, who is always very good) with an agenda.  Leave it to NIP/TUCK!!!

So, it's mostly good.  The camoes this year were particularly delightful, from a droll Larry Hagman, to an evil Jacqueline Bisset to a hilarious Rosie O'Donnell (whom I usually HATE...but I have to give her props here for a funny and touching and bawdy performance).  Alannis Morrisette was okay in her role as a new love for Liz (the wonderful Roma Maffia.)

But I continue to absolutely HATE both the character of Matt McNamara and the actor who plays him.  He's totally unlikeable and I believe still needs to be in prison for the hit and run he got away with years ago.  But John Hensley, who plays him, continues to irritate most terribly.  He's not a good actor, and frankly, he's almost impossible to look at.  I still wonder who thought to cast this guy!!  Nearly as annoying is Joely Richardson, a good actress whose character is just so terribly unlikeable.  But Christian Troy is an unlikeable character that viewers adore.  Julia is an unlikeable character that viewers just don't like.

But overall, the show is great!!!  I enjoy every episode (even the strange ""futuristic"" show set in 2026), and gladly spend my time with McNamara/Troy.  The main reason the show gets only 4 stars is that Matt McNamara/John Hensley causes me to drop an entire star.

If you've never seen the show before...by all means do.  But you must start with Season One.  It's well worth the effort to see them all!!",1193788800,10,3310,4.7125435540069684

The 4th season is packed with even more creative plots and twists and turns that will keep you on your toes.  Each episode of the 4th season continues to shock and surprise me.  Never a dull moment; keeps me interested throughout the hour wanting it to be longer.  The  appearances by special guest stars make it that much more entertaining.  A few of the 1st season characters also appeared in the 4th season, so someone just tuning in to Nip/Tuck may be a little lost.

2843038,4,B000QUTTQ0,"Having just rewatched the fourth season on DVD, my perspective of this season changed a lot.  When I watched it on TV the first time around, I was disappointed and thought that the show had become tamer and less interesting, especially with a tired retread of the Sean-Julia relationship and Christian's licentious affairs.  Thus, I found myself surprisingly reinvigorated when I took a fresh look at the show.

This season is much better when viewed a second time.  I understood the reasons for the characters' actions better and grasped the subtleties much more.  Not that there's much that's left to the imagination with a boundary-pushing show like this, but it's one of the best written shows on TV, and even though it falters from time to time, like with the ridiculous season 3 finale (and what ever happenned with that accident Matt was in during season 1?), there's plenty to make up for it, such as the beautifully and heartbreakingly well-written episode ""Reefer,"" where (SPOILER ALERT this sentence only!) Sean bonds with a homeless drunk after Julia finally leaves him for good, only to have tragedy come into both their lives again.  And finally, some resolution to the Escobar storyline, which I always thought ended a little too patly in the season 1 finale.
True, some things are tied up a little too conveniently and parts of this show are a little too contrived, but it's still a worthwhile viewing experience, for the great acting (when is Dylan Walsh going to get the Emmy nomination he truly deserves, along with Julian McMahon?), incisive writing, and the observations of plastic surgery that mirror the impact it has on society and us as flawed human beings.",1191628800,,1682,4.904929577464789

I thought the story lines in this season were much better than the last season.  I still think the first was the best.

I also think that since I don't have to wait a week to watch each show it seems to flow a lot better.  I will watch a couple shows at a time over a couple week period instead of having to watch it over a ""tv season"".

Nip/Tuck 'jumped the shark' this year with their look into the future, turning a present day suave and debonair Christian into a Liberace look alike.  We could feel nothing but pity for Sean acting like a 90lb weakling throughout the season.  The only thing that kept the interest was Joely Richardson's outstanding acting ability and the host of guest stars - Rosie O'Donnell was fantastic!",1190851200,7,695,4.8559322033898304
2843077,4,B000QUTTQ0,"Edited 3/15/09 - WARNING - SPOILER ALERT

This season, we discover that Julia's baby is Sean's, and that it has Ectrodactyly (lobster claw syndrome).  Surgeries include Sean doing a procedure on a Treacher/Collins syndrome patient (severe facial deformity), Dawn Budge is ""earjacked"" (her ear sliced off by an earring thief) a burn reconstruction on Escobar (he's back!), and a breast reconstruction on a woman (Escobar's wife) who's had her breasts brutally cut off.

Guest stars include Brooke shields as Faith Wolper (Christian's therapist), Larry Hagman and Sanaa Lathan as Burt and Michelle Landau, Peter Dinklage as Marlowe Sawyer, Rosie O'Donnell as Dawn Budge, Jacqueline Bisset as James LeBeau, Alanis Morissette as Poppy (Liz's girlfriend), plus the stellar, fantastic, and sexy Catherine Deneuve as Diana Lubey.

Some of the plotlines this season include Liz (the fantastic Roma Maffia) getting a kidney stolen (a la urban legend), the dog and the peanut butter, Matt joins Scientology, Sean has an affair with a potential nanny, Christian gets involved with Michelle, James (a woman) LeBeau has a dangerous hold over Michelle - running an organ theft ring, Christian battles with his own sexuality after his therapist hints that he might be gay, Liz's remaining kidney fails and she has to go on dialysis, Kimber seduces Matt to revenge Christian, Julia sleeps with Marlowe, Merrill Bobbitt returns, Wilber (Christian's ""son"") returns.

My favorite is the return of Escobar (Robert LaSardo).  Escobar is so bad he's good, and he makes for a few great episodes.  This time he's not just masking as Sean's conscience, he's really back.

The soundtrack is again fantastic (pick up the CD of the soundtrack to Season One), using music to complement the scenes, such as playing Don McLean's 'Starry Starry Night' (a tribute to Vincent Van Gogh) during the ear replacement surgery.

The season finale was fantastic, with major resolutions and some very big questions left for Season Five.  The fault with this season is that once again there wasn't enough surgery scenes.  Unlike Season's One and Two which focused on more surgeries, Season's Three and Four focus more on the daily lives of Sean and Christian, and have more personal trauma in them than surgery trauma.  I'd like to see them go back to the old formula of more surgery issues.  Since Troy/McNamara has made some major changes this year, I'm wondering how many more of the interesting pro-bono reconstructive cases we'll be seeing in the future.  Overall, Season Four is as good as Season Three but still doesn't measure up to One and Two.  Enjoy!",1190592000,19,2618,5.112676056338028

Also Nip/Tuck suffered fro ma alack of over all direction. A direction that the move from Miami to L.A. could help, especially if the scientologist storyline gets resurected, perfect fodder for season 5.

This season has a few more down-to-earth surgeries than last year, which is welcome, because although producers have said that while every surgery the docs perform is based on something in real life, a viewer still gets a little antsy and is like ""O...kay..."" But this season is just great. I loved the new addition of Michelle and the wonderful barrelful of guest stars, everyone from Richard Chamberlain to Rosie O'Donnell, who are all great.

I am only half way through this season, but the writers have stayed true to the format that has been working in the past.

2843084,1,B000QUTTQ0,"There was a very entertaining campy insanity that made the first two seasons a delight to watch (the end of the second season, with that lovable ham Alec Baldwin, was very very clever and fun). The quality, however, began to go down in the third season, with the whole ""castrado"" thing, but the fourth season is just awful. Very very boring, or as we say in spanish, aburridsima: no ideas, no narrative logic, no risks, no fun. Even the sex in this one looks pretty tame. I mean, when I was a kid, I remember that I knew when a comic book was running out of ideas when Batman went to the future to meet with the martians or something. I had the same feling when I saw the ""Nip Tuck from the future episode"". Maybe things will get better in LA, who knows?.",1188950400,11,755,4.25
2843085,3,B000QUTTQ0,"The first three seasons were much better. I cannot put my finger on any particular thing, but is just wasn't up to par.",1188864000,3,119,4.217391304347826
2843086,3,B000QUTTQ0,"Well Season 4 of Nip/Tuck wasn't all it could have been. The first three seasons were brilliant and inventive. Season 4 seemed more like a second rate soap opera than a groundbreaking television show. Organ thievery, the ""cult"" of Scientology, the affair with a little person, a flashback, a flash foward, this season was full of cliches that played out only slightly better than the last show you saw them in. Don't get me wrong I love Nip/Tuck, and season four was better than most other shows on television, but not by much.  If you love Nip/Tuck you will probably like this season alright. If you've been on the fence about this show, season four will probably push you over the edge (on the wrong side).",1188691200,14,708,4.619047619047619

8197641,5,B000QUTTQ0,"This is a very entertaining adult TV show. The plots by season 4 are not quite as compelling as season one, but still good. Some scenes, though not real I'm sure, are not for the squeamish at heart. Characters are fun dealing with the rich clients that need a Nip and Tuck here and there, or total makeover.  I don't think it matters that much if you missed the high jinks from other seasons. Most episodes are a fairly standalone within a certain season though. Try it out. Many times a comical or horrific view of life in the lucrative world of plastic surgery.",1506643200,,563,4.413461538461538
