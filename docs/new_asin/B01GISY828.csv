8762973,4,B01GISY828,"Wild, out-of-control rich girl, Lydia, parties without restraint and has no respect for those who are not rich. Shes responsible for the death of a cop, and her life changes dramatically. This film is a morality tale and very preachy. There are extravagant DeMille scenes and costumes. Despite melodramatic acting and an improbable, coincidental plot, this film is imaginative in many ways and is very watchable.",1486512000,,412,5.257575757575758
