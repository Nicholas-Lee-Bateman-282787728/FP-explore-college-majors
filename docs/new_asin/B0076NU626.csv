5057716,5,B0076NU626,"Love this dvd! I must say, I'm not a big fan of instructional golf dvd's, because the last thing I need when I'm over a shot is the echo's of some video coach telling me what I already know I need to do.  But when there is even a smidgen of info I haven't heard before, my ears perk up and I work the tips on the range and lo and behold, I see results. I'm aware that I suck at writing reviews and rarely do, but I am real happy with this and thought I'd share the joy!",1335916800,39,469,3.7373737373737375
5057717,5,B0076NU626,Why not get advice from the #1 teacher to all the PGA pros?  I basically started over with golf and this DVD will set you up with all the basics and the swing is starting to come along.  Worth the $35 I paid...A lesson by itself is over $50 / hour.  Might as well get the DVD so you can watch over and over.,1450051200,,307,3.765625

5057726,4,B0076NU626,Any task that requires motor skills requires much practice. This video gives you the tools to use on the course. The key is to take what Mr. Harmon describes on the DVD and take those skills to the driving range and course.,1431993600,,223,4.333333333333333

5057734,1,B0076NU626,Was not as advertised.  Over priced.  Don't get me wrong.  If you can get this product with two discs and four hours of instuction it is excellent.  But this was a rip off.,1422230400,,172,4.121212121212121

5057740,3,B0076NU626,DVD content was basic?,1412035200,,22,4.75
5057741,3,B0076NU626,"This disc was alright. When I first started golfing 30 years ago I purchased a vhs tape called""golf my way""by Jack Nicholas and I seem to have gotten allot more out of it.
While I bet Butch is a hell of a teacher/coach to the pros and probably a really good instructor ""in person"" to the average golfer I found his video had a little to much ""I like to work with what the individuals strengths are"" more than teach ""one certain way"" for everybody. Again, while that approach may work in person it doesn't really work in the ""instructional DVD""world.
That being said, I still gave it 3 stars due to the fact that through the picking and choosing there's still allot of good information on the disc.
In summary I'd have to say if you're just interested in what the great Butch Harmon has to say and/or you're about a14 handycapper looking to get to a 12 then by all means buy it. If you're serious about your game then personal instruction is probably the better Avenue for you.",1411948800,4,976,4.397790055248619
5057742,5,B0076NU626,Got this cd for my husband who is a late golf bloomer.  He needs help in all aspects of the game.  He said that Butch Harmon takes you step by step in everything.  He really appreciated my purchasing this for him.  And has studied it several time..  He said it's an A+ cd.,1411257600,,272,4.056603773584905
5057743,5,B0076NU626,Clear helpful instructions provided. He gets right to the point and avoids technical jargon. I think Tiger should get a copy and get his game back on track!,1410652800,,156,4.607142857142857

5057752,2,B0076NU626,"This was not what I expected. Based on promotional commercials, I thought this would be a comprehensive book on the golf swing. It was not. This book MAY serve the interest of a beginner golfer. It is far below what I would expect from Butch Harmon. I do not recommend this video at all. Not even for the beginning golfer. There are far better choices out there.",1404691200,,362,4.417910447761194

5057757,3,B0076NU626,"I thought it contains a lot of technical details and directions because Butch Harmon has good reputation in teaching golf.
But a good part of the video is for some famous players comments and opinion.
It is not much different from other golf video.
It is ok, but not worth for the money.",1397779200,,287,4.433962264150943
5057758,5,B0076NU626,"He is a great teacher and teaches you from gripping to swings but generally, it's really similar to Tom Watson's teaching in his dvd in 2010.
Was Tom Watson his student previously?
Anyway, it shows you to learn from scratches.",1395187200,,226,4.675
5057759,5,B0076NU626,Very clear and straight forward. This instructional video not only teaches you how to play golf but also explaining cause and effect.,1393459200,,133,5.090909090909091

5057762,5,B0076NU626,"Great addition to my Golfing Video's. But I always thought that his Dad would have taught Butch along the lines of  Mr. Ben Hogan fundamentals.

5057774,5,B0076NU626,the c/d is in very good shape. And as always Butch Harmon is very good in how he teaches golf,1376006400,,93,3.7
5057775,4,B0076NU626,"He is a great instructor and has great experience. My GPOP gave me this for Christmas. I looked at it and watched it and it was really good. The only thing is is that every thing he says is in Golf Digest. So if you have a sub., don't get this. Other than that is really good.",1375056000,,276,3.8596491228070176

5057777,5,B0076NU626,"I am always looking for ways to improve my golf game.  Having taken up golf later in life I still struggle with some of the basics, like best ball position for certain types of shots and stuff like that.  I bought this DVD set hoping that some of the advice that Butch had would be helpful to my game and my girlfriend's game. It has helped reinforce many things that I have either been trying to incorporate ito my golf swing or have heard I should be doing but wasn't quite there yet.

I must say that his presentation is refreshing in that he is not selling a specific 'swing', but rather things that need to be incorporated into the swing to make it consistent and effective.  He goes through the basics in such a way that it is clear why you should be doing something and what the effect is of not doing things the way he advises.

I haven't looked at the interviews of the big name golfers that are on the second DVD yet.  I suspect that is part of the reason for the higher price of the set.  Also, he is sponsored by Titleist and Winn grips, so expect so 'promotional comments' every once in a while.

Although I am a high handicap golfer I would think that everyone would benefit from some aspect of Butch's teaching methods and drills.",1371600000,,1245,4.2905982905982905
5057778,4,B0076NU626,"Great tips on grip pressure and ball position. The entire instructional portion of the video set (DVD #1) was superb. I

5057780,5,B0076NU626,"This DVD is very comprehensive meaning that it includes all parts of the swing from setup through impact, Driver through putting.  That being said it gives the fundamentlas without being overly complicated and intricate.  I cut 8 strokes so far by following the basics and practicing.",1367452800,,284,5.1521739130434785
5057781,5,B0076NU626,Purchased this as a gift for my husband. He says it's the best video he's used on golf instruction --- and he has several.  It is well-organized and the information is presented in a way that is easy to follow and practice. One of our best golf purchases!,1362873600,,255,4.3125

5057783,3,B0076NU626,OK but did not have enough slow motion scenes showing various positions in the swing and far too much of Butch hitting the ball. Would have liked more drills for improving ones swing,1361232000,6,182,4.545454545454546

5057787,5,B0076NU626,"Contains all the basic fundamentals needed to either start, or improve your golf game.  Butch gives great examples and is detail oriented on how he explains the game.

5057789,5,B0076NU626,"Hands down, Butch Harmon has the chops to be considered the finest golf instructor in the world. What serious golfer wouldn't want to avail him- or herself of the complete game wisdom of this man? The DVD is brilliantly laid out, allowing users to either work their way through his instruction from beginning to end, or to move easily to the areas of concern for their individual games. Butch is always straightforward and concise in his remarks, which the video enhances with repeat illustrations of key thoughts for every aspect of the game. A longtime follower of the various golf tips offered in monthly golf magazines, I'm going to do myself the favor of simplifying my life and using Butch's DVD as my Bible. If it's good enough for the likes of Tiger, Phil, Greg, Ernie, Adam, Dustin, and Natalie, it's good enough for me.",1344643200,6,829,4.724137931034483
5057790,5,B0076NU626,"This is a great DVD set.  I watched both length DVDs and rewatched a few parts. My wife even picked up on a nice drill for wedges.  Harmon emphasizes that he does not try to change your swing because we all have some built in tendancies that he can't fix.  But he does have several guidelines that he would prefer that you use in your swing.  I enjoy his easy going manner of instruction.  I also like his use of real golfers in the examples.  Of course, he also shows you a lot of Adam Scott and Nick Watney, two that he instructs. And they both have marvelous swings. Many say that Scott now has Tiger's old swing and it sure looks that way, but Scott denies it, of course. Watney's is also beautiful, but more powerful looking. I even watched the interviews with his old pros.  I especially liked the one with Greg Norman.  You will enjoy these two DVDs and you will likely  pick up one or two things that will help your game.",1344211200,6,929,4.232954545454546
5057791,5,B0076NU626,"When in trouble with your golf game always start from the basics. Always.  I've read, watched and listened to all of the instructers and finally at 70 years old I found a DVD that really starts at the basics with plan golf talk. The biggest problem I have is the pitching game and after watching AND wanting to learn  I found this DVD to really help me.  I bought this DVD because it showed some stuff I didn't see from other learning tools.  When I got it  I went to the chapters that covered my trouble spots.  I'm doing very well with my driver and other woods, putters except my irons and pitching distances.  I can't believe that Butch Harmon's DVD showed that I was about 3 inches too close to the ball.  As simple as that and I changed my iron shots the very next day to very well placed shots.  One hole that has a large pond short of the green has caused my problems for years and I always shot about a 5/6.  The day after I watched the DVD I birded the hole.  First time in 4 years.  Just one chapter was with the price for a, I hope, long life of great golf.  Thanks Mr. Harmon.",1342915200,19,1089,4.104265402843602
5057792,4,B0076NU626,"Butch Harmon is highly respected for his golf instruction. This video is great for the average golfer who wants to improve his or her game. I liked the organization of the DVD into stages of the game. He demonstrates each technique and at times shows them as done by popular PGA professionals.  My husband and I both learned plenty and got reminded of some things we had forgotten. It's a bit pricey, but has two DVDs and a lot of good tips.",1342915200,3,441,4.378048780487805

5057794,4,B0076NU626,"I'm returning to golf after a 10 years break. I wanted something to put me back in the game. This video is doing just that. All the bare essentials are there. I watch the video, go to practice range, coming back, I watch it again to understand what didn't work. The one thing I would have wished for more are close up shot.
Over all I am very satisfied.",1339372800,7,353,4.130434782608695
5057795,5,B0076NU626,I have bought many instructional dvd's and this one is the best so far. Covers everything you need to know to improve your golf game. Great for beginners but I would recommend getting at least 3 golf lessons from a Golf Pro so that you will have a starting point.,1339286400,10,263,4.28
5057796,2,B0076NU626,"The Butch Harmon DVD is very shallow in my opinion. Avid golfers and low handicap players will not be given the amount of information they desire. Mr. Harmon does nothing in explaining his concepts of the golf swing or comparing what he teaches to that of more younger method teachers. You gain no insight into Mr. Harmons idea of the release and how it should be accomplished ie active , passive or otherwise. I do not think the DVD is worth the money, not even close.",1338249600,21,469,4.465116279069767

8511018,5,B0076NU626,What more can you say about Butch Harmon and his spectacular family.  He is the best teacher out there and the pro golfers love him.  He is honest and uses what he gets in a golfer and just makes the golfer better with the skills the golfer has. This video is so easy to look at and his drills are so easy to use and remember. His simple instructions will make a poor golfer great.,1500163200,,381,4.066666666666666
