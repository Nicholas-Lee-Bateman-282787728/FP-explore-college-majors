2772533,5,B000NO241G,"I was flipping through the channels a few weeks ago and saw the Dog on one of the religious stations.  I prefer God and conventional church to the religious TV shows, but they were interviewing Dog and it was the most interesting interview, I ended up watching the last 45 minutes of the interview with Dog.  Dog described events including the Mexico capture of Luster and then himself being arrested and his trust/hope in God.  This was the longest my set has been on an interview on one of 'those' stations.  The host was the minister who married Dog and Beth.  I then purchased the book and read it in two days - a very interesting, quick, easy read (I am guessing written on a 5th grade reading level).  When I returned from my trip I opened up season 1 and was going to watch one or two episodes.  I watched six of the episodes on the first night - it was great to put the book and the Dog TV show together.  If it matters, I vote republican, graduated college, blah, blah, blah...",1189036800,15,986,4.320652173913044

I wish they released the complete seasons instead of best of.

2772544,2,B000NO241G,there was too much cussing in the dvd. I bought it for my nephew but he gave it back because he didn't like all the cussing and cursing. I thought he was a Christian and was not expecting to have to throw it away because of the language.,1369958400,,237,3.9583333333333335
2772545,5,B000NO241G,"I really enjoy watching the box set of Dog, the Bounty Hunter. I like how the family works together to find the criminals. They also try to help the criminals to get off drugs and they try to encourage them to make a better lives for themselves.

2772549,5,B000NO241G,I loved this set . The shows they picked were exactly what I would want to watch. I loved the wedding video too that was added to my set. It realy tugged at my heart when dog walked behind that wall and looked at the preacher and said  MY little baby died and he started crying. You can see the love that he and Beth have for their childred. And that makes the show special.,1361577600,,374,3.986666666666667

2772552,5,B000NO241G,"I have EVERY dvd of Dog the Bounty Hunter (except the ones containing only one episode on each dvd,with just 22 minutes running time-rip off). They are all great. What i simply don't understand is why they always sell only some episodes on the dvds rather than selling the whole season just like shown on TV? I live in germany and have no chance to watch Dog on TV,so even if i have bought every dvd available on the market there are still so many many many episodes that ive never seen! These ""Best of""-DVDs are just not fair! Real fans want it ALL!!!!!!!!!!Who decides which ones are really THE BEST?why does A&E decide that for us?they can not know,what our personal BEST OF episodes are-so therefore:Pleaaaaaase A&E,i hope you change your mind and sell the whole seasons soon to make it possible for every single Dog-Fan to see it ALL!

2772554,4,B000NO241G,"So I love Dog the Bounty Hunter, it is very interesting and at times quite funny. My only complaint is about the quality of the dvds. There is a thin fuzzy black/white line at the very top of all the episodes, and the credits at the beginning are either loud then quite or quite then loud. At least when the show gets going, the sound is normal so I am not too upset! Other than those technical issues, everything else is great!",1294272000,,428,4.2317073170731705
2772555,5,B000NO241G,I love this tape.  I was just turned on to the TV show this year and am hooked.  I love the message of healing in their hearts for these could be forgotten people.  And as for excitement...... non stop.,1285027200,,202,4.128205128205129
2772556,4,B000NO241G,"This is a great show; a lot of fun and excitement for people that like AND dislike reality shows (such as myself). The only flaw to this product is that the seasons aren't full seasons. I knew that I was buying ""best of"" seasons, by the way, but this product left me wanting more and that is the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5. Like Dog? Buy this product (it comes with the wedding special). Curious about the show? Buy this product; you won't be disappointed.",1267574400,,474,4.277777777777778
2772557,4,B000NO241G,"Sadly, since succumbing to the world of *political correctness*, Dog &Co. have become a (LONG IN THE) TOOTHLESS PARODY OF THEMSELVES.

Or, in the immortal words of B.B. King: The THRILL is GONE...

What was once a GREAT series (included here, hence my 4 STARS) has sadly become ""We're only in it for the $$$$$.""

Even reformatting the series has only led to the feeling that everyone involved is WALKING ON EGGS thinking ""GOLLY! I SURE HOPE WE DON'T *OFFEND* ANYONE..."" And with almost every new episode taking place in Denver or Colorado Springs, it's increasingly apparent that the DOG POUND HAS WORN OUT IT'S WELCOME IN HAWAII.

This, coupled with it's legendary PREDICTABLITY (""YOU SON OF A B**** MO-FO, I'M GONNA KICK YOUR A**!!!/OH, CHANGE. FIND JESUS. HAVE A CIGARETTE. CALL YOUR MOTHER. WE LOVE YOU! WE'RE YOUR BEST BUDS!"" BY THE END OF *EVERY EPISODE) has SUNK IT. It's on LIFE SUPPORT. (HAVE MERCY! PLEASE PULL THE PLUG!)

Buy this, but stop here. Watching the DOG waste away will just make you MADDER, SADDER and POORER.

If you want THE SERIES that's WHAT DTBH *USED TO BE* then tune in to OPERACION REPO! THAT TEAM IS ROCKING - AND REMOTELY *PREDICTABLE* IT AIN'T!",1252368000,2,1177,4.717073170731707
2772558,4,B000NO241G,"I do have one suggestion to improve the viewing of this series and that would be to reformat the viewing option of having to ""babysit"" the remote in order to progress to the next segment. The DVD should run through the entire DVD without having to manually advance to the next episode.",1249430400,,285,4.5
2772563,5,B000NO241G,A great deal for 4 dvds. There is an extra dvd that I didn't know would be in the package. I bought this for my son who loves to watch Dog.

2772565,3,B000NO241G,I thought the product was a good price and was sent in the mail at a very speedy rate.  The only problem now is that part of the DVD's skip and I'm not sure what to do.  I am not sure if you exchange products or not.  My son really wanted these series for Christmas and now on the 2nd DVD he has opened it skips.  He's afraid to unwrap the other two.  And the 1st one is open and fine.  Please help if you can.  If there is anything you can do it would be much appreciated.  It's been the first time i have ordered from Amazon and was very pleased.

I admit it did to a degree but it did leave me wanting more.  I get that it is the ""Best Of"" but what about the other episodes?  I think that there were some great episodes that were not included in this set. I do, however, recommend this set to all that enjoyed the show.

8179613,5,B000NO241G,"As someone who actually aspires to bounty hunt (like Dog Chapman with a gun or minus a felony conviction) this series is both entertaining and informative. Though Dog's methods deviate from the practical modern bounty hunter's, all of his procedures are still basically the same as any other bounty hunter (bail recovery agent, bail enforcement agent, etc.) protocol. It is certainly worth noting that Dog is not just some rookie Bounty Hunter that a network decided to film for entertainment--he is actually a veteran of the profession, almost a legend by now. Duane has netted bounties into the triple figures. The man has chased high profile fugitives of justice, battled demons of criminality, and has gone so far as to even have a television show about his life. The show is top notch: like ""Cops"" for 'the other guy'.

My Commentary, as a Registered Bounty Hunting Candidate:

In my state I am partially registered to be a Bounty Hunter. I am already in the state's database for ""bail recovery"" as it is called here in Arizona, so you could say I am a Bounty Hunter myself. Personally I think it would take a courage of brass to net bails or ""bounty hunt"" without a gun and various other equipment. Though while he was filmed he never captured more than a handful of fugitives known to carry firearms, and as far as I know, not once (at least on this box set) investigated/captured one on film, the man is a top-notch professional--take it from me. He does go on Bounty Hunts with a bullet proof vest, which is smart. If I were him I may go so far as to bring a bulletproof helmet with me as well. It is also curious to me that he doesn't use a taser (that's taser BRAND, not an imitation 'stun gun'), and brings just mace instead, on all of his hunts. Then again, as a radio host commented in an episode featured in this boxed set: Dog looks like he could ""kill a guy with a potato"".

In short: this show is informative. By watching it you learn about an obscure profession that many think died in the days of the ""wild west"". For me it honestly served as a crash-course educational video that illuminated my career search. It is also accurate. The scenarios featured in episode after episode are sometimes above and beyond what most bounty hunters do these days on a regular basis. Beyond this, it is also very creative and ""outside of the box"". It is worth noting that many (if not most) bounty hunters these days are all armed to the teeth with weapons and various tactical gear. Dog, as far as we know, goes on the hunt with nothing but body armor and pepper spray. For this reason, it is certainly very unique. Any bounty hunter you talk to will likely tell you that they keep at least one firearm in close proximity or on their persons during a bounty hunt. For me, this show offered me some basic stepping stones up to the platform of bounty hunting.",1424822400,,2864,4.514450867052023
