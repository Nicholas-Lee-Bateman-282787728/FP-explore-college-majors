5766205,5,B00D0U6NTO,"A more than excellent movie which unfolds like the bouquet of a mature mellow red wine, like savouring the myriad flavours of slow food! The actors, musicians and music open the viewer up to the mostly unknown world of long-forgotten traditional musical instruments and the accomplished but unknown musicians who still play their virtuoso music in long-forgotten villages...",1377475200,2,374,5.4655172413793105

8588241,5,B00D0U6NTO,"Fabulous music, amazing cast, incredible locations. Filmed in Israel, but it looks like it's another world. There's some electricity and a couple old VW's, but everything else looks like the 16th century. I think it was shot in the oldest parts of Jaffa...these are the locations Pasolini was looking for but couldn't find! And the people all look like Gypsies but from the Middle East. Eastern/Middle Eastern/Mizrachi music that will make you cry, it's so beautiful. Every shot looks like it is from an ancient age. The violinist looks like he stepped out of the pages of 1001 Arabian Nights. This is a real film, not a mere music video, and it culminates in a concert in a cave. If you like the music of JUNUN, or the mystical THE WIND JOURNEYS, you will love this! Please ignore the 1-star reviews from dummies who didn't read that the DVD doesn't play on standard USA equipment, which is clearly stated in the description. If you don't have one, get an international DVD payer so you can watch great films like this!!!",1446076800,,1022,4.683333333333334
