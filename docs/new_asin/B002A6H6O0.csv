8359022,5,B002A6H6O0,"If you liked Starsky and Hutch you will love this series except Hutch is a girl!
a really hot girl! the series is well written with plenty of action and comedy.
This is the best season but I would buy the complete series because once
you start watching you will be hooked and will want seasons 2 and 3!
too bad it wasn't picked up for a 4th season so they could admit they
were both in love with each other! the last episode seems to point to
the series heading in that direction but it was cancelled. too bad!",1394496000,,510,4.11

8359024,4,B002A6H6O0,This is an excellent program which has made the transfer from the period it was created until the present day well. It is strange but the rampant feminism of makepeace is the one thing which dates the program as well as the cars.,1279238400,,229,4.348837209302325

A month went by and no delivery. I e-mailed the company and they could not have been more helpful. They had me check with my post office, and when that didn't turn up the package, they sent a new set of DVD's. All e-mails sent were answered withing 24 hrs. I would definitely have no problem ordering from this company again.",1248393600,,472,4.314606741573034
