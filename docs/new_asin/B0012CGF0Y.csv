8245025,5,B0012CGF0Y,My son stomped on the DVD I ordered off JLC's EZChief site so many years ago. I was pretty upset since I didn't think I'd be able to find another original. Thank God. This showed up looking exactly like my last one -- no 2nd gen rip and photocopy -- and in better than estimated time.,1410220800,,284,4.089285714285714
8245026,5,B0012CGF0Y,"This dvd gives a 2 dimensional glimpse into the performance power of one of the greatest live bands that never made it big! I saw them 10 times when I lived down South and once in NYC years later...they never failed to please. A talented bunch of quirky, brilliant, bohemian ""cool nerds"" who rocked the house with an Irish alternative lilt. I miss them...I'm so glad this DVD exists to memorialize their work. Anyone who has seen them live knows EXACTLY what I'm talking about.",1331942400,,477,4.623529411764705
