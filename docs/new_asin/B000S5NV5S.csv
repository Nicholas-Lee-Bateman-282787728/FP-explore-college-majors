2881241,5,B000S5NV5S,"My granddaughter will not let me put in another DVD.  She has enjoyed many DVD's including Mickey mouse and Sesame Street.  She only wants to watch Word World over and over.  She has some of the toys from Word World.  She can spell DOG. She will be two in one month. World Word has her spelling CAT and Dog at 23 months. She can recognize many letters because she has watched word world.  On behalf of the adults who have to repeatedly watch their child's constant demand for the same show over and over, this show does not become annoying to watch multiple times as other children DVDs do.  It educates and entertains the the child without becoming annoying to the adult child care provider.",1202601600,,692,4.496
2881242,5,B000S5NV5S,I couldn't wait to get Word World DVDs.  It's one of the few shows (along with SuperWhy) that I would rate as equal to CBeebies on BBC.  Both Word World and Super Why are simultaneously fun and educational and have excellent animation.,1201737600,,235,4.571428571428571
2881243,5,B000S5NV5S,"I have a 2 year old who is starting to talk up a storm and he absolutely LOVES Word World.  He loves all the animals and he says the words that they build in the episodes.  He also says the phrases they use a lot - like ""share the cake, don't eat the cake"", which helps him learn good things.  I even like watching it. It's fun, silly, engaging and educational - It doesn't get much better!",1201651200,5,390,4.038961038961039
2881244,5,B000S5NV5S,"This for me, is the best kids show out there. We've loved Dora, Bob, Elmo and the baby Einstein shows...but nothing is as good as Word World. My sons get to choose one show they want to watch every day, for the last four days in a row they have chosen Word World (since we bought it!). They are almost 2 and almost 4. My 4 yr. old now knows the letters that they practice on Word World. Today he was spelling ""P-I-E, pie!"" and ""t-r-e-e, tree!"".

I highly recommend Word World, as it is interesting enough that they love it(even at age 2!), and as far as TV goes...it actually teaches them something! I'd say go for it!!This is the best show yet!",1201219200,5,645,4.201612903225806
2881245,5,B000S5NV5S,"This is the greatest show. My three year olds love it and laugh out loud while watching it. One of our 3 year olds is even picking out the letters and words that she sees on the program. Plus they have such good messages about getting along, sharing and being happy with who you are. It's such a great program. I'm glad these are out on DVD now so the kids can watch it whenever and I don't have to watch the clock to see what time it's on PBS.",1199232000,,444,3.9444444444444446
2881246,5,B000S5NV5S,"I just bought these two Word World movies tonight at Toys R' Us. Price was 12.99 but they had a buy one, get second for 50%off sale, so the price is pretty much the same as here if you buy both. I have no idea why Amazon won't have it until mid January.

Show is both entertaining and educational - my (almost) [...] daughter loves it.",1198800000,,335,4.075757575757576
2881247,5,B000S5NV5S,"My 5-year-old son is a 3-D learner (dyslexic) and I was having trouble getting him interested in reading or writing.  Since he's started watching Wordworld he and his 3-year-old sister run around the house shouting and dancing ""It's time to build a word"".  Next we run and get our letters and build words. Now words and letters are fun and exciting to him.  The most valuable aspect to this show for my son is that it gives him a 3-D view of letters and words and at the same time gives him the picture to go with it.(most Dyslexics think in pictures only - if there's no picture for it they're stumped)  Aside from that the characters and stories are very entertaining.  I find myself clearing my schedule to watch Wordworld.  It is also good for me to watch it with them because then later we go over the concepts taught and re-build the words.  They don't even know they're ""learning""",1194652800,39,887,4.472049689440993
2881248,5,B000S5NV5S,"This is a wonderful kids show! My 3 1/2 year old son adores it - he sings along and pretends to build words just like the characters. It is visually appealing with lovable, non-annoying characters. My son loves the stories and being able to pick out many of the letter. Great, educational, program!!",1193270400,21,299,4.660377358490566
2881249,5,B000S5NV5S,"This is, in my opinion, the BEST kids' show to come around in a very, very long time. It helps kids recognize their letters, sound out words, and spell, which I appreciate. However, learning aside- this show is fantastic. It is HILARIOUS, the characters are well-developed and lovable, and the quality is fantastic.
I know this show is meant for preschoolers, but my 7 year old loves it too. She is a beginning reader, and she feels very cool being able to recognize all the words in WordWorld. I am preordering both DVDs, and in the meantime we'll continue to catch it on PBS.",1191888000,32,577,4.5576923076923075

2881262,4,B000S5NV5S,Great video for those who already know the alphabet and are working towards putting words together and reading words. My 4 year old really likes this video asks me to watch it everyday. It is comparable to some of the Leaf Frog dvds as far as the amount of learning the kids are getting from watching it. What I like most about it is that it contains several different videos in this one video so it is not just the same video the whole way through. Definitely suggest this one!,1416009600,,478,4.322222222222222

2881268,5,B000S5NV5S,From PBS it's a great program for younger children. It takes the letters and forms the words so children can see and hear how the word is spelled and sounds.  Great way to help your little ones learn letters & words and not feel guilty they're watching TV.,1403049600,,256,4.333333333333333

2881272,5,B000S5NV5S,"My  son is 18 months old. He loves all of his Word World DVD's. They are entertaining and educational. They help sound out and spell words, and he loves ""DOG"". I would recommend them to friends. It is better to allow your child to watch learning DVD's like Word World rather then all that ""Junk"" on TV these days. It is mostly non-educational and inappropriate for young eyes.",1391990400,,376,4.529411764705882
2881273,5,B000S5NV5S,A fun creative way to teach letters and sounding out words for many children.  Younger aged preschoolers and older toddlers enjoy the characters just as much as older children.  We love this one and the rest of the series.,1387238400,,222,4.666666666666667

2881277,4,B000S5NV5S,i like the episode on it. what i don't like is there is a lot of promos and commercials to buy other dvd's. i think the company could have used the space on the dvd to add other episodes. this is not anything the seller can control.,1371686400,,232,3.9574468085106385

2881282,5,B000S5NV5S,"WordWorld is one of the best kid's shows in my opinion. They are simple, cute, educational, and fun! Both of my preschool-age girls love these and think it is fun to ""build"" words just like they do in the show.",1360886400,,210,4.275
2881283,5,B000S5NV5S,"Educational, and entertaining! I bought it for children on the autism spectrum for Christmas that I work with. They're 5 and 6 years old. They absolutely love it and helps them to spell.",1360454400,,186,4.666666666666667
2881284,5,B000S5NV5S,"As my 4 year old was getting ready for bed the other night, she said ""Mommy, I know how to spell tent"".  She blew my mind after I doubted that she knew how to spell it.  She then shared with me that she learned how to spell it from watching this DVD in her after school program.  I just checked out a few of the DVDs from our local library.  The others (and there are so many to choose from) I will purchase right here at Amazon.  Thanks Amazon for offering such a huge collection of WorldWorld DVDs!",1360281600,,500,4.061224489795919

2881289,4,B000S5NV5S,Seller delivered very quickly. This was bought for a Christmas gift for my little ones. They love watching Word World and it's educational. Great for pre-school through early elementary school age children. My wife and I like like to watch it with them also. It's not annoying like a lot of kids shows tend to be these days.,1355184000,,324,4.603448275862069
2881290,3,B000S5NV5S,"We love WordWorld in general and were happy to buy this dvd, but HUGE disappointment that it says on the box that the Music Video is ""Dancing Dog"" and it turns out it is NOT. The video is one with Pig in it. Of all the ones to choose from I bought this one because my daughter loves the tap dancing dog part, where they build their instruments then play as a band - she gets out her play drum - Wondering which disc actually has ""Dancing Dog""?",1348358400,,443,4.045454545454546

2881292,5,B000S5NV5S,"I absolutely loved this movie/show.  It is the cutest way to help early readers get a good start.  The animals are all spelled out and they make items with letters.  That's not the greatest description, but rest assured if you have a toddler/early school aged child, this is a fantastic investment.",1346889600,,298,4.803921568627451

I have ordered many dvd's,books,and games to get his attention and grab his interest. I have found that usually I'm repeating myself in telling him to pay attention to most dvd's. So when I ordered this dvd I wasn't expecting anything much different. When it arrived I emmediatly put it in and to my surprise he didn't waste any time in sitting down and watching this dvd!!I honestly couldn't believe my eyes and ears. I caught him hysterically laughing at the dvd and when it was over,he asked me to play it again. I plan on ordering all of these dvd's for his lesson plans.

Just don't give these guys 'Number World'.
Four useful words - THE EXTRAS DON'T COUNT! Sid the Science Kid is infinitely better value at 150 Mins ""plus bonus content"".

My sister is 9 and spelling is a large focus in school for her and this helps her so much because they break up their words and sound them out and put them together.

I asked her father if he ahd been teaching her the alphabet - his reply was something along the lines of ""she can't even speak properly yet - how can she learn the alphabet?!"" I took out a set of alphabet blocks and she casually recited every letter from A-Z. She doesn't have any siblings, and back then she didn't even have any friends. A few weeks earlier, I had added a few episodes of WordWorld to her DVD archive (along with Maisy Mouse and a couple of sing-a-long DVDs).

2881310,2,B000S5NV5S,"This show is not suitable for a child who doesn't know yet how to blend the letters. Unless your child a proficient reader of three-four phonetically simple words this show wouldn't help them. I wish the show makers started with the simplest words. Instead of starting with words like ""dog"" and ""pig"" the words that are spelled in the show are more challangenging like ""pie"" and ""cake"".The choice of the words that are spelled in the show isn't that good. The animals in the show are made out of letters and it is a good idea, but the letters are rarely seen clearly and unless a fluent reader your child will miss most of the words. Childern need repetition to learn reading and the words that are spelled on this DVD are rarely repeated. I would say that entertaiment side of the show is aimed at a 2 to 3 years old child, but educationaly it's aimed at a 5 to 6 year child, so there is a disparity. To start reading without difficulties childern need to understand clearly that one letter might produce more then one sound and they need to remember all of the sounds that produced by each letter. This wasn't adressed by the show.
My daughter, who is 4 found this show boring despite loving other programms about letters. She also adores animals but wasn't interested in stories about animals on this DVD. In general this show might sparkle an interest in building words, which is good, but don't expect that it would teach your child to read.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WordWorld-Welcome-to-WordWorld/dp/B000S5NV5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WordWorld: Welcome to WordWorld</a>",1233792000,10,1629,5.082089552238806

This concept really catches the attention of a preschool age child and holds it, which is very hard to do. The creators of Word World should be awarded for making such an excellent product. I would recommend this to anyone who has small children as it is fun to watch and very educational, and it will give you a very needed break as well:)",1229212800,,415,4.402597402597403
2881312,5,B000S5NV5S,"I discovered Word World by accident on PBS and it was the first show my toddler actually laughed out loud at. She turned two last month and she loves Word World. She knows the letters and loves shouting them out whenever the characters ""build a word"" and now she recognizes many words from the show on sight. I just wish there were more episodes. We love watching Word World together.",1228953600,,384,4.5
2881313,5,B000S5NV5S,My 2 year old daughter has a speech delay.  This series has encouraged not only to talk more but she is know spelling out a few of the words.  The dvds are great as all the toys that go along with it.  Keep them coming!,1228780800,,219,3.8222222222222224

2881315,5,B000S5NV5S,My 3 kids love this show and I can't believe that it took this long to come up with such a simple concept!  As a parent of 1 kindergartener and 2 not even in preschool yet this show has improved my childrens interest in reading and has inspired their interest in other methods of learning.  Even if you just had your first baby or a child entering the school age make this your first educational purchase!  Watch the show just once on PBS and you'll immediately realize (like I did) what this show can do for them.,1226707200,,514,4.278350515463917
2881316,5,B000S5NV5S,"I'm a kindergarten teacher and I love this show.  My class and I watch WordWorld on PBS everyday after lunch while they take turns going to the restroom.  They hate it when we have to turn it off and move on because they see the things they learn in the morning in a cool and fun cartoon.  This show is very good about reinforcing topics that we are covering in class, not only has it covered letters and sounds, but it has worked on our rhyming skills and using pictures to help figure out what the words really are. Even my students who have had a difficult time with reading love to ""build a word.""  I would highly recommend these movies to anyone, parents and teachers alike.",1221955200,4,679,4.322834645669292
2881317,5,B000S5NV5S,"This series drove me up the wall...why?  Because my 3 year old could not get enough it!  Which isn't always a bad thing.  He was so engaged with the characters and spelled right along with them.

Definitely worth a try for your preschooler!",1219276800,,240,4.511627906976744

2881319,5,B000S5NV5S,"My three-year-old adores this show. After he saw it once, he wanted to watch it every morning, but he usually wakes up after the broadcast. So I purchased this one, and it's great. He's really learning from it -- not just literacy skills, but social skills as well. He often talks about the characters and storylines (""Sh-sh-shark!"") and applies the same patterns in his everyday speech, such as isolating the initial sound of a word (""D-D-Daddy? Do you want to p-p-play?""). (No, he doesn't stutter!)

We highly recommend it!",1216252800,,525,4.898876404494382

When it came in the mail, which it came extremely fast, she just sat on the couch and looked at the cover forever stating ""ruff ruff"", so I put it in and she was running around the house clapping.  So I just want to thank you for your fast service and making my daughter smile :-)",1215043200,,331,4.0

8204293,5,B000S5NV5S,"I purchased this DVD for my grandson because the show is amazing. My daughter watches it on Amazon Prime and loves it. She learned her alphabet, both upper case and lower case, and the sounds the letters make just from watching this show! No kidding at all. I am a terrible teacher, but this show made it effortless. It is a fun show and they learn without even realizing it, which in my experience is the best way.

I highly recommend this show to anyone with small children.

He is an emergent reader (at 9 yrs, born with Down Syndrome) and I couldn't be more proud of him watching and spelling along with bear and dog and duck and all their friends.  He surprised me the other day by finding the word ""Barn"" in a shopping plaza (not the kind of barn he was hoping for...  Dress Barn, not the farm kind!) and I knew it was due to this excellent program.  Not only do they encourage good phonetic skills, sight word reading, etc..., but they also have messages about being kind to your friends which every kid needs to hear.",1448582400,,601,4.339285714285714
