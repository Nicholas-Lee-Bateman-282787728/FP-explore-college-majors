8146535,5,B000INYOXI,Excellent..although I am not ready for this..I'm not this far into training yet and the only downfall was it plays in my TV Dvd player but really wanted to use it in my laptop to take out doors with me...,1375574400,,204,4.125
8146536,4,B000INYOXI,"Novice handlers (and even some intermediate handlers) and their dogs will immediately benefit from the easy to understand exercises on the DVD.  It's amazing what you and your dog can do with just one or two jumps.  Your dog and you can really learn the foundations of handling and taking jumps.  Your dog will also develop a healthy balance between handler and obstacle focus. Yes, Susan does dwell on simple details, and that can get a little tedious for some us.  However, had I paid more attention to details early on in training, we would probably have a MACH by now!  I would also get Linda Mecklenburg's book, Developing Jumping Skills.  Jumping and cueing off the handler are the foundations of agility and it pays to do it right early on.  You will really be glad down the road.",1372896000,2,787,4.618705035971223
8146537,5,B000INYOXI,"Clear instructions from one of dog agility's greats!  Love the""all positive"" method.  My dog learned to jump with obvious joy.  I highly recommend all of Susan's books and DVDs",1355184000,,176,5.0
8146538,5,B000INYOXI,"This video shows a series of ingeniously designed, deceptively simple exercises that require minimal equipment and little space, but that nonetheless teach the dog a lot of hugely important agility skills. For instance, the ""focus"" exercises teach the dog to  ""mark its own line"" rather than focusing exclusively on the handler, while still remaining exquisitely attuned to the handler's body language.  Only a week of doing the focus exercises with my young dog has already improved his performance and enthusiasm. With all due respect, I do not believe that the negative reviewer understands the premises of this kind of training, in which the handler practices very short, frequently rewarded behaviors, using extremely clear criteria, until the dog is absolutely confident and reliable. Once the dog has a solid understanding of these behaviors, the more complicated stuff just involves stringing them together. There's an awesome sequence in which Susan Garrett cues her border collie through a long serpentine while standing at the other end of a large room, just by little flicks of her hands. Nobody needs to be able to do this on any agility course I've ever seen, but it's really, really cool.

Although this is not really a handling video, I believe that working through the section on front and rear crosses, which I haven't gotten to yet, is going to improve my consistency as a handler by making me more aware of my exact cues.",1303430400,14,1441,5.046218487394958
8146539,2,B000INYOXI,"Agility DVD's can be a little difficult to come by sometimes, and so when i finally managed to get a copy of this i was really excited.  I ended up paying 40.00 for this dvd, and really hoped it was worth the money!  ...... Well, i have to say, this DVD was the biggest load of rubbish i've ever watched.  I actually ended up having to switch it off and couldn't watch any more of it.  To give you an idea of the dvd - Firstly, its VERY basic - unless you have a 3 month old puppy who knows absolutely no commands i personally don't think this dvd is at all usefull.  The 'training advice' was on things such as 'sits' and 'stays'.  What is apparently the more advanced training in this dvd is how to get the dog jumping over 1 jump..... The dvd then goes on to tell you how to send the dog over 1 jump using your arm as a signal..  In my opinion, it was all advice that you could simply find out from either the internet or from a 1.99 Dog book on simple training.  I really thought this DVD was a total rip-off and its certainly put me off buying anything else by Susan Garrett!!",1268611200,13,1081,4.042253521126761
8146540,5,B000INYOXI,"LOVE this DVD set! Taped at a live seminar, here are dozens of exercises to teach your dog the nuts and bolts of agility with the bare minimum of agility equipment (or no equipment at all).  Tons of great advice on relationship building, setting criteria, teaching a dog a sold stay at the start line, understanding a change of arm, etc.",1200787200,19,337,4.524590163934426
