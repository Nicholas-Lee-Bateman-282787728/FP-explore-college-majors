869144,5,6304418698,"I usually don't like kung fu type movies, but this has to be the best one I've ever seen!  The special effects are absolutely top-notch for 1982, and they are very ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" like.  Of course there are a few cheesy moments (wait until you see the talking head), but they do little to detract from the overall high production values of this movie. The dubbing isn't all that bad either. I strongly suggest checking this movie out if you liked CTHD, or even if you usually don't dig this kind of thing.",986342400,4,522,4.484210526315789
869145,5,6304418698,"I laughed, I cried, I realized that the crying was due to the laughing.  I think that this is one of the defining martial arts movies of the 80's.  As if jumping off their own swords and exploding into throwing stars wasn't enough to laugh at, they put in a scene of ninjas flying throught a forest.  This almost killed me, my Hapkido instructor, and my Taekwondo instructor.  It will forever live in my memory as one of the funniest things I have ever seen.",982627200,,458,4.352941176470588
869146,5,6304418698,"If you like martial arts and asian swordfighting you can already stop reading and order this movie at once (i suggest the dvd). I've seen a lot movies like that but none could offer that much of all that makes those movies so great : lots of brilliant swordfighting scenes, lots of breathtaking techniques, lots of ninja mysteries, lots of pathetic dialogues, lots of honour and codex stuff, traitory, drama, lots of blood (yeah), lots of that... old 70es martial arts movies music and lots of humor as well. Plus good actors who perfectly fit their roles and some funny superpowers which are beyond any realism (just to name a single - you have one scene where a group ninja is flying [not jumping, they really fly] straight trough the trees of a forest, were you're forced to think ""oh really ?""). I've thougt about that footstabbing at the end as well and i guess there are only two reasons that make sense : 1.) he's trying to isolate the whole pain into the foot (you know like ""i stick a finger in my eye so i won't feel my hurting legg anymore"") or one that is even more possible 2.) he does it to keep his balance (you see that he's almost falling, but after he stabbed his foot he's standing still).
Anybody who read that...  until the end and still lacks the movie should get it at once ! You're missing the best !
Ps : I've got a new deepminded question though (only for the dvd version) : the english synchro's text is very different from the english subtitles .... why ?",980121600,4,1483,4.392727272727273

869338,2,6304418698,"I normally think highly of Hong Kong movies, but this one was super boring.  There was no story other than Chinese vs. Japanese martial arts.  A few fighters from the two countries decided that they were going to compete in a fight-to-the-death competition.  One came from the Shaolin Temple.  Another came from a school that felt they were the original top Chinese kung-fu school before there was Shaolin kung-fu. The other two competitors were from Japan's shoguns and ninjas.  The fight scene choreography and special effects were great, but no plot.  Just a super boring movie unless you just want to watch it for the fight scenes.",1483833600,,635,4.88785046728972

869634,5,6304418698,"If you believe that a movie can be so bad that it's good again, you definitely need to see this.

There are two important points:

-The creators clearly didn't want it to be bad.  They thought it was going to be serious and amazing.  That is, it isn't ""Not another teen movie"" or ""epic movie"" or anything else that is partially ruined by the fact that they're trying their butts off to be stupid.

-It's not boring.  You won't be treated to just a couple of goofy scenes hidden in long tracks of boring, overwrought dialogue or artsy camera-work.  It is consistently weird and funny.

So, get some friends together who are prepared for a little weirdness and have a great evening.",1316304000,,680,4.516393442622951

All the sound effects are heard before the action. If you can tolerate this GREAT mistake then you can enjoy this movie, but if you don't, then stick with the original chinese version.

P.S: I gave this movie 2 stars because of the dvd quality, but the film itself is a FAST CrAzY ACTION MASTERPIECE!!! It's a shame that FOX didn't saw it that way.

Its already bad enough you sat and watched through the corny and terrible storyline thinking you may at least see a good fight at the end. What happens is you are greatly disappointed and determined to put this movie on the garbage list. Its not even worth a 2nd watch and theres only a handful of kung fu movies that make me feel that way. Examples are the guy with secret kung fu, and hitman in the hand of buhdda. My list of terrible kung fu flicks is low, but this is a lock for it. Do not buy this movie.",1219017600,,678,4.143939393939394
869768,4,6304418698,"Highly entertaining film that pits the best in Japan against the greatest in China for an annual ""Duel To The Death"" to prove their respective martial arts superiority.  The movie gets most everything right by making both our Chinese and Japanese leads near equals (and both likeable in different ways) rather than leaning heavily towards one over the other.  It also does a nice job subtley showing the differences and similarities of the two cultures locked in battle (from garb and swords to ethics and beliefs).  The fighting here is pretty good although rarely lasting longer than a few minutes and implements Wuxia style flying and jumps here and there (this is an early film of Hero choreographer Siu-Tung Ching).  The violence is exagerated and graphic with enough blood and limbs being hacked off to keep me happy including an excellent decapitation!  As far as the production goes I was impressed with the killer soundtrack and memorable/bizzare visuals including a sky full of ninjas flying on kites, a talking severed head, a huge ninja that splits into several (including a fully nude female!), a legless man storming around on crutches... and the effects are all top notch (this is 1982 people?!).  The finale finally matches China's master swordsman against Japan's finest samurai and the results are a gruesome and entertaining way to top everything off.  The DVD release from Fox/Fortune Star looks and sounds great (and can be bought on the cheap) although the ""special features"" include nothing but 2 trailors?!",1191715200,6,1530,5.0717131474103585
869769,3,6304418698,"From seeing the trailer on other movies, and some of the reviews here on Amazon, I was expecting a great Martial Arts movie.  I did enjoy the movie and some of the martial arts scenes, but there seems to be some major gaps in this 1993 version of the film I have.  The editing is horrible.  There has to be some scenes that were left out!

The basic plot is that every year the best swordsman from Japan and China meet in a battle at a Temple in China.  Both of the main actors are very good, and there final battle is pretty cool, but I wished it lasted longer.  In between there is a subplot of ninjas who are trying to kidnap the best martial artists of China.

Some of the fight scenes are cool, but they are also very choppy.  In one scene, you can blatantly still see the wires holding up the actors.  It is 2007, those wires should be zapped out with computer tech.

The ending is horrible!  I thought, ""that is it?""... there was so much promise!

A good movie, but I am not sure why it is on some people's list of Top 10 Martial Arts movies?",1179273600,,1049,4.113300492610837
869770,5,6304418698,this movie really kicks a**.one of the most interesting fight scenes ever seen.and they weren't playing when they said fight to the death. I would highly recommend the movie for all martial arts lovers like myself.,1174003200,5,214,4.972222222222222

It is worth every penny!!,1148169600,2,443,4.285714285714286
869773,5,6304418698,"I bought this DVD through Taiseng awhile back for almost $30.00. And, in a way it was definely worth it. Although, nowadays you can get this movie for a few dollars. I recommend this movie if you are into the whole asian cinema, Hong Kong, and samurai movies.

The story is good. The sword play is awesome. And, there is plenty of blood that gushes out when the characters die!!! This movie is a blend of a solid samurai movie and a good chinese fantasy/Sword play/ kung-fu movie.

I suggest that you rent this if you are not a fan of asian cinema, but if you are I highly recommend this movie. Oh, I think some of you who  listen to rap will recognize the music from this movie. The Rza from the Wu-Tang Clan probably sampled a few loops from this movie.",1146268800,3,755,4.265734265734266
869774,5,6304418698,As other reviewers have said here this film is riveting because considering it was done well before CGI was developed its special effects (though mostly wired) are very believable.

You will like this movie if you are a kung-fu buff who enjoys a little wire work. Jet Li beware!,1141776000,7,434,4.878378378378378
869775,3,6304418698,"I could not decide whether or not I liked this movie, so I decided to watch again.  After watching for the second time, I have decided that I am stuck in the middle with this movie, there were some parts in the movie that just didn't make any sense to me.  Here are the parts that I did not particulary liked:
1.  Shaolin monks were supposed to be among the best fighters.  So, the part where a monk was walking with a Japanese guy and they ended up fighting one another for a very short time.  The fighting techics were not very impressive, and what the monk said something like ""let's not fight each other, let the young ones fight for us"", was a little annoying.  I would have liked to see some impressive moves by the Shaolin monk.
2.  I was hoping that this film would be more like The Crane-Snake Secret or The Super Stars movies.  You'll see some impressive hand to hand along with some different weapons being used in those movies.  In this Duel to the Death movie, the film relyed too much on the special affects.  You see so many characters fighting in mid air while flyin around, you just won't see what they could actually do without the special affects.  Also, the lot of the fight scenes were not on very long at all.  I felt like the film rushed through lot of the fight scenes.
3.  The Chinese guy and the Chinese girl had a little love interest in each other, but the Japense guy did not have a girl, so I felt a little bad for him.
4.  When the Japense guy found out that he's own people used him, so when he decided to ignore the order to kill himself, then when  why did he went on and want to fight the Chinese guy when the Chinese guy did not want to battle him anymore.  Japenese guy could easier have decided to not to fight the Chinese guy, but he was so into following he's samuri code of honor which did not make any sense to me.
5.  Very end, you still won't see any impressive marshall arts moes when you watch them dueling eachother at the very end.  They flew around the air a lot and did lot of sword fighting.
6.  I don't think the Chinese guy wore diffrent color outfits like the Japense guy did.  I would have liked to see what other kind of outfits men back then wore.

Here are things that I liked about the movie:
1.  The kite scene.  This is where you will see some impressive hand to hand combat moves.
2.  The beautiful sceneries.",1129680000,6,2371,4.1946902654867255

Also make sure you pick up the 1st DVD release as the picture is more acurate to what was released at the time it came out. And the dubbing is more what you came to expect of a great action packed old school flick.

869888,5,6304418698,"I just picked this title up at Circuit City for $6.99. Now, I've been wanting to get an older HK Kung Fu movie (for what it is) for a while now. I used to watch Kung Fu Theater every Saturday at 3:00pm on channel 5 (hehe) when I was really little. The only three I remember are Drunken Master, Jade Claw, and The Flying Guillotine. But they all had certain qualities that, while hokey, I had come to love about them: Bad audio Looping and dialog, The ""Snap"" sound effect during fights, bad Disco Music, confusing and overly-elaborate storylines, but best of all, over-the-top, reality-suspending action sequences.

Since those days, I have grown to love anime, Japanese fighting games, and modern kung fu flicks, (and Kill Bill, heh) and I had since forgotten about the old classics. My standards for Kung Fu action movies had even become elevated, requiring elements from the aforementioned modern media! Then I came across ""The Flying Guillotine"" at Best Buy a few months ago. The price was a bit too much so I didn't get it, but I was reminded of the classics and I wanted to get a proper cheapie Saturday Afternoon Cheesy Kung Fu Popcorn flick. What I got instead... was ""DUEL TO THE DEATH""!!! It is SOOO much more!!!

This movie's got it all: Over-the-Top Action sequences... Check! Awesome, slightly muted, 70's style music... Check! Japan Vs. China... Check! Dual Evil Plots... Check! Bad Dialogue Looping... Check! The ""Snap"" sound during fist fights, as well as a host over other overdone Foley Sound Effects... Check! Big Haired, Big Eyebrowed, Big Sideburned Asian dudes as well as Old long bearded Masters, as well as Shaolin Monks... Check Check Check! Extremely Well done Wire Fu... Check! Samurai and Kabuki Warriors... Check! Ninjas?? Hmmm... Well let's see... Let's go down the list here... We've got Stealth Ninjas, Shuriken Ninjas, Kite Ninjas, Sand Ninjas, Tree Ninjas, Leaf Ninjas, Flying Freight Transport Ninjas, Giant Ninjas made up of several standard size Ninjas, NAKED Female Boobie Ninjas, EXPLODING Ninjas (Nothing, absolutely NOTHING under the Sun says Action like EXPLODING NINJAS!!), Vanishing Ninjas, Smoke shooting Ninjas, Samurai Ninjas, Yes, there's even a Jack-in-the-Box Ninja, Ninjas that get sliced in two, Ninjas that get sliced in half, revealing another ninja jumping out from inside the old Ninja, and last but not least, the Naked Female Boobie Ninja!!! Nope you can never go wrong with that! (Im not making any of this up either!)

The movie reeks of outstanding production values, which is unsusual for a Kung Fu movie from that era. Excellent visuals ABOUND, and not just in the scenery either, but just in the styles of the characters movements and the camera angles. For instance, our Japanese Samurai hero is the Lord of the Stance! He uses very handsome looking stances and has a couple of beautiful finishing move poses! It's like the movie is thanking you for watching it by constantly providing small bits of on-screen eye candy! This movie also has awesome special effects (for what they are, at least)!

This movie is flat out FUN! It even has a few humor sequences (the scene with the little samurai kids is pretty funny). There are also moments where you're going WHAAAAT???!!, hehehe. It rarely slows down, and when it does, you can count on some action sequences right around the corner. And the action sequences have a tendency to LITERALLY go way out of control. There is tremendous amount of buildup in some of the fights and things quickly become accelerated to the point that it actually loses control and crazy stuff starts to happen!! You feel as though you're at the mercy of an uncontrolled car or rollercoaster that's about to hit something...  and then it does and then all hell breaks loose! It's at these points that the sequences are at their most over the top or their most violent! It really is something to experience! For Example:

[WARNING: MAJOR MAJOR SPOILERS!!! The following sentence is only for those who have seen the movie.] Probably the most memorable scene of the movie was when the hero is fighting a foe, and things escalate, then all of a sudden the hero slices the foe's head off, it goes flying and gets impaled onto a tree branch right through the ears, and we zoom in on it long enough for this disembodied head-kabob thingie to actually SPEAK, saying: ""Mark my words... You will DIE!"", and then, of course, ultimately EXPLODING!! Now THAT's Cool!!! [END SPOILERS]

This is now my second favorite Kung Fu movie, second only to Fist of Legend. I would also reccomend watching it if you've watched (and liked) Kill Bill. For this is pretty much the movie Kill Bill was trying to be! Get it, pop up some popcorn on a lazy Saturday afternoon, open your mind and suspend all reality, and Enjoy this GEM!! IT'S GOT NAKED FEMALE NINJAS IN IT FOR GOODNESS SAKES!!!!

Sorry for the Long Review!",1091836800,19,4881,4.830143540669856
869889,5,6304418698,"This film is amazing.  If you like kung fu/samurai flicks, this is the one to see.  I thought ""Swordsman II"" was great, this I think, is better.  This movie reminds me so much of the anime ""Ninja Scroll"".  The cinematography is awesome.  The fighting is superb, and the violence is incredible.  It captures the essence of Shaolin kung fu and the Japanese samurai.  Great sword play and an intriguing story.  This is a gem.  Now one of my favorite martial arts movies.  Two thumbs up, way up.",1086393600,20,491,4.540229885057471
869890,5,6304418698,"I saw it like that when Iv read the reviews. This movie got it all!. Its a classic for HK kung-fu movies as Scarface would be for gangsta movies.
What I liked the most about this film, despite being an old film, is that ur not left on ur hunger with lil teasers. For example, when u see a fight scene that u like, and it promptly stop (because the guys run away, or they got killed like instantly) all u do is hoping that u will see it again, like if ur doing sex and someone intterupts u. WELL THIS MOVIE BRINGS U TO ORGASM! Thats right, no lil teasing, its goes until the end with stronger and better fights until the famous DUEL that happens! And the last fight is the strongest and most complete! Its a little hardcore, but so realistic. This movie rocks, and the DVD is cool as well!",1084752000,5,788,4.123376623376624
869891,4,6304418698,"Wow is all I can say.  After years of dealing with kung-fu on crappy pan and scan VHS and letterbox format DVD's, this edition is a rare treat.  First off it's a fully anamorphic transfer, meaning it will preserve it's original aspect ratio on widescreen televisions.  It looks fantastic on my Samsung widescreen HDTV.  The colors are rich and vibrant, making the film look better than it probably ever has.  The fact that Fox and Fortune Star took such care in transferring a fairly unknown kung-fu film warms my heart.  Lest I forget the DTS soundtrack which actually offers a noticed separation instead of a generic Pro Logic sound, unlike nearly every other ""digitally restored"" DVD coming out these days.  The inclusion of the original trailer and original Cantonese soundtrack are like a buying a donut that comes with a refill of jelly.
The story is fantastic too.  There are all kinds of ninjas!  Kite ninjas, vanishing ninjas, even naked foxy ninjas!  The score is very effective as well.  A lot of older kung-fu flicks either have no score or a scattershot one at best.  This movie has a pronounced heroic theme that's quite catchy.
This kind of treatment should be given to more kung-fu films.",1074816000,4,1204,4.79126213592233
869892,5,6304418698,"Considering that this film was released when I was still in diapers this film was executed perfectly in every aspect. This story has it all. It has mystery, love, revenge, tragedy, and some of the best action I've seen to date. All of this is  staged around one duel based on an age old rivalry to see who is the best. Will it be the Chinese or the Japanese. This is an oldschool film, but it is waaaaaaaaay ahead of it's time. It's definitely one of my favorites and I'm sure that anyone who buys this film without any expectaions except to be entertained will love this classic.",1051488000,,580,4.37037037037037

Wouldn't all those ninjas get a little repetative at times?""  Well, all you doubters can walk outside and get a big 'ol ninja star to the forehead for all I care, because it doesn't get repetative in the least.  The reason for that is there is a wide variety of ninjas in ""Duel to the Death.""  It's got flying ninjas, exploding ninjas, hang-gliding ninjas, giant ninjas, multiplying ninjas, naked ninjas, suicide bomber ninjas, librarian ninjas, ocean ninjas, sand ninjas, and so many more.
And, oh yeah, there's this little thing about the two greatest warriors from China and Japan fighting each other for the honor of their respective countries.  But that's really just a side note to all the ninja antics going on.
So, if you're like me, then you'll love this movie because it's got so darn many.....wait for it....NINJAS!!!  Rock on!!!",1020470400,5,995,4.823529411764706
870008,2,6304418698,"This is not the worst movie in the world, but it is rather slow at times and has some pretty atrocious acting and costumes. There are a couple of nice fight scenes and the ninja action is out of hand, but these scenes are few and far between. The rest of the time is filled with attempts at arty wuxia drama which just doesn't work. It was one of the earlier ""arty"" kung fu swordplay movies, so it was novel when it was made, but in hindsight, it is just not nearly as entertaining as later classics like Swordman II, Dragon Inn, etc. HK fanboys and collectors should check it out for historical reasons, but casual kung fu fans should check out some of those other mentioned titles instead.",1010707200,,691,4.364341085271318

The DVD is high quality and has very little of the wear that most films made 20 years ago tend to show. The cinematography is great and illustrates the beautiful fight scenes wonderfully. The action is centered more on sword fights rather then hand-to-hand and the movie is filled with ninjas, samurai, and warrior monks. The fight scene at the end is one of the best i've seen. Overall, Duel to the Death is great martial arts film and should be in the collection of any martial arts fan.",1006905600,3,615,4.451327433628318
870010,4,6304418698,"I actually saw this movie at the theater when it first came out (I believe it was 1982). I saw it only once so I am writing this review from my almost 20 years old memory. This may be one of the best movies that came out in those days that helped bring HK movies to international recognition. As a martial art film the fighting scenes and special effects had broken some new grounds. The flying ninjas as well as the giant ninja that was composed of 5 or 6 female ninjas (if I remeber it right) seemed to me at that time somewhat ruined an otherwise great movie. The overly thick blood or ketchup that oozes out from the self-inflicted wound of the samurai kept bothering me for quite a while after the movie. One can't help but wonder why a movie that had apparently spent quite a good sum of money on special effects couldn't even get the blood look right.
Tsui (played Japanese, a big HK kungfu star in the 70/80s) was very good in the movie, I think he was the right choice. It was probably Lau (played Chinese)'s first action film role, I was rather suprised he was picked for the role because he looked sor t of weak in personality, but I think he played the character well (I don't know what the English version is like but the debate on Japanese and Chinese flowers really adds salt to the movie, and the two main characters do have temperament that reflect the two different flowers).
I was quite suprised that most of the reviewers here think the movie is funny, I certainly did not see its humurous side at that time. The footstabbing, well, all I thought at that time was he was showing his unyielding will even till death - the kind of strength of Japnese cherry flowers that he talked about earlier, it was also typical Japanese samurai spirit.",999043200,2,1758,4.379204892966361

Some of the darkest scenes appear with a slight haze. 4/5. Sound:Crisp,clear,the drawing of each sword,running through water,and each jump and flying action are crystal clear.some slight background noise can be heard for a very short time approxiamately 12 minuets into the film,it lasts for about 20 seconds. I did not hear any other faults. The English Subtitles are not at all accurate;some sentences are not complete,some words are missing a letter,and some explanations seem incomplete. This did not distract me at all,but was a little irritating at times. 4/5. The Film:Some excellent sword-fighting,less Kung-Fu. Characters can fly almost at will,move lightning fast,and somtimes turn invisible! The story is an entertaining one,but has it's slow points,made a little frustrating by those subtitles! You cannot root for either of the two main Characters,as each is equal in that;they both have supreme determination to represent China or Japan,in honour,dignity,e.t.c,and especially,by the sword!

I like the subtitle and language options, stuff like that makes a difference with a movie like this. The movie itself has an intriguing story and cool characters (I liked the Japanese swordman the best). The swordfights and battle scenes are great, and so are the special effects (especially considering this was an early 80s release). And yes there are tons of ninjas, flying ninjas, and they are awesome. This is just a cool movie, with a good plot that keeps up the action right up until the duel to the death at the end.

They are typically reduced to such obscene stereotypes in martial arts movies of 60s-80s, that it makes it hard to watch; they usually make Mickey Rooney's performance in Breakfast at Tiffany's look subtle and respectful.

The new dub makes the story stale; the old dub had so much flavor behind the voices. Now it sounds like a monotone snooze fest. I hate to say that about an incredibly fun movie, but it's true.

7870613,5,6304418698,"The gods clash and spew violence against each other atop the craggy cliffs. The ocean swells below, crashing upon the rocks as it claps to the shaking of the giants above, their great thunderbolts and plumes of fire sparking against each others breast bones and sheathed arms. Such is the feeling that the climax of Duel To the Death holds as two top swordsmen, one representing the Chinese and the other Japan, fight the eponymous duel where there can be no real winner. Duel To the Death is an achievement in emotion and style over nuanced and intricate, even acrobatic and balletic fighting. Fans of the latter will be disappointed as the fighting, whether it be hand-to-hand or weapons artistry, is absent and amounts to so many camera tricks and frequent posing and freezes but this along with the almost frenetic angles and cuts and sustained close-ups enhances the emotional core of the battle between the two warriors. The young Chinese swordsman was never intended to fight the Japanese swordsman as a Japanese lord had made plans with a disgruntled Chinaman to capture many of Chinas martial arts heroes, the young Chinese swordsman included. But when the Japanese swordsman learns of the duplicitous heist his honor is offended and he stands against his conniving countrymen; you know that no matter what happens the honorable Japanese swordsman isn't going to make it out alive and this makes him a tragic figure. His drive to fight to the death also binds the Chinese swordsman in his tragedy and the movie ends without finishing unfolding the final scene but seeing the two combatants mortally wounded, facing away from each other, just as the gods must have done atop the beaten down oceanside cliffs.

Duel To the Death may not wear as well with age as some other chopsocky movies but its inventive moxie and memorable scenes (SO MANY NINJAS!!!SO MANY NINJA TRICKS!!!) are sure to leave a lasting visual and emotional memory in the viewer.",1505174400,,1955,4.88855421686747

Even though the overall plot seems a bit simple, the twists and turns with it keep things interesting with great memorable characters found throughout the movie. The fight scenes are outstanding considering the year it was done.  Just keep in mind this is a fantasy-style kung fu movie with over the top martial arts, magic, and superhuman feats of agility going on. It's not trying to be a realistic depiction of martial arts or sword fighting in any way. The English dub is a bit silly, and makes some scenes more comical than they were probably intending (find a version with subtitles if you want a better translation), but the movie is still great even dubbed.",1492300800,,686,4.716666666666667
