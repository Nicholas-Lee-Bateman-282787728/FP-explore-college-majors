3915113,3,B002E2QH7M,"Certain films I love while having no explanation as to why, ""Lucifera: Demon Lover"" is not one of these films.

It lacks a lot of the stuff that makes a Demon film great.

There's no Demon on the soundtrack, very little Demon blood, it's not scary or action-packed, but it certainly makes me laugh like a Demon.

I guess ""Lucifera: Demon Lover"" is enjoyable for mostly the wrong reasons.",1255910400,,387,4.579710144927536

8366716,2,B002E2QH7M,"A woman stays overnight at the Devil's caste and dreams of Helga and her lover. They are Germans who speak Italian and like garlic. There are witches and spell casters and a guy in a red hood as Magda wants Helga's boyfriend Hans.

The restoration was bad in a number of spots and good in other. The erotica is the sell element of the film, and that aspect doesn't exist in the beginning and is heavy loaded into one scene of F/F lovers during some rite. Plot wise the story leaves much to be desired too. Over priced.

8366718,2,B002E2QH7M,Please do not buy it as is completely wastages of money. No sense of humor in this money as movie works on flash back.,1365292800,,118,3.9583333333333335
8366719,3,B002E2QH7M,"One of my favorite Euro actresses who touched every genre from Horror to Spaghetti Westerns to Sword and Sandal in the sixties and seventies was Rosalba Neri AKA Sara Bey, a gorgeous, fiery brunette who always threw herself literally into her roles.  Whether it was a murderess, warrior queen, sex goddess, or 'LADY FRANKENSTEIN', you could always expect your moneys worth from her presence.  Which is why I asked myself. what was she thinking when she signed on to this movie?  'LUCIFERA-DEMON LOVER' aka 'L'AMANTE DEL DEMONIO' seems to have been made in an alcoholic, drugged stupor.  Director Paolo Lombardo comes off as an Italian version of Edward D Wood Jr. as he  gives the film a sleazy, dreamlike quality bordering on the surreal with sex scenes appearing to wake up the audience and sequences suddenly going from day to night sometimes in the same shot. The actors including Edmond Purdom (what was he thinking??) carom about the proceedings like in trances and the film has to be seen to be believed. The plot (what there is of it) involves 3 girlfriends including Rosalba visiting a castle which is believed to be inhabited by the devil himself.  Rosalba sees herself in a portrait hanging on the wall in the castle and goes into a trance as does the audience transporting her back to her previous life in medieval times.  The film almost resembles Tom Parkinson's 'DISCIPLE OF DEATH' but with a much lower budget if that's at all possible. The 3 star rating is for Rosalba and her nutzoid performance . Mya Communication delivers a visually crude full screen transfer which actually enhances the sleaze factor in Italian with English Subtitles. For all you Euro Horror fans who think they've seen it all, this film is for you.",1290211200,4,1739,4.815436241610739
8366720,3,B002E2QH7M,"MYA must be an acronym for 'Mislead Your Audience' because, with very few exceptions, all of their releases are sourced from the WORST possible prints - they appear to be 3rd generation VHS copies, with rolling picture lines, glitches and blemishes galore, poor audio, no contrast, washed out or flaming 'hot' colors, you name it - if it's anything that makes your viewing experience painful, it's right there.

It appears to be a goal or hidden agenda of theirs - even when they re-release movies on the now-defunct NoShame label, whose audio and video were impeccable and had tons of extras, MYA finds a wretched copy  of  the film and releases it bare-bones - no featurettes, trailers, bios, filmographies,  inserts, etc. AND they're charging Criterion release pricing for these atrocities!

Another despicable, deceptive practice of theirs is to re-title a film and use a different cover on the release, so you think you've stumbled onto a rarity to add to your collection, only to find out when you get home that it's something you already have; only your copy is far superior. And I've purchased more than one flick that's been edited, apparently with a chainsaw, to add insult to financial injury. One bummer after another...

So what do we, the poor slobs who keep them in business, do about the heinous crimes committed against us?  I, for one, tire of lambasting them here on Amazon (read all the reviews I've written about their releases), so I'm calling on you to join me in BOYCOTTING MYA COMMUNICATION releases until that time comes when they begin respecting their core audience, the rabid fans of all things Eurocult, Gaillo, Eurosleaze, Crime Dramas and Eurohorror. Fight the future, my friends, and hit them where they've been nailing us - in the pocketbook.

The real drag here is that this flick COULD have been a great midnite cult gem as it has all the perks - Rosalba Neri nude more often than usual, other Eurolovlies running around in various states of undress, Gothic castles and graveyards, more nudity, high camp ratio, murders, did I mention nudity? Sorry. Unfortunately, it's barely watchable due to all I've referenced above, so save your coin and search elsewhere for your Eurosleaze enjoyment. If you absolutely have to, rent it, but don't give these cretins your cash...",1283385600,3,2304,4.920103092783505
8366721,1,B002E2QH7M,What is this company thinking to put out a pricey DVD that looks like the worst public domain VHS rip? Do they think customers are blind? This is really making me angry. Never again I will buy a MYA DVD. Too bad.,1259712000,12,212,4.071428571428571

8366723,4,B002E2QH7M,"The bad news is it's cropped and not a very good print. However, still, if you've never seen it,  and you appreciate Gothic Euro-trash, you'll probably still enjoy it. There's loads of Italian babe nudity and the almond eyed Rosalba Neri is stunning. Anyone who collects and understands these kind of films would love it in their collection.",1257897600,12,341,4.879310344827586
8366724,3,B002E2QH7M,"Lucifera: Demon Lover appears from the cover to be a lurid satanic romp like Satanico Pandemonium but instead plays like a gothic horror story set in medeval times.  Helga tries to lift a curse on her wedding dress but ends up enchanted by the Devil. If you like gothic Eurotrash this title will serve as a fun afternoon time-waster, but I'd recommend renting it first before commiting to a purchase.",1257120000,3,400,4.714285714285714
