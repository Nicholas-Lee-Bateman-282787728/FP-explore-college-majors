2639179,5,B000HLDFA4,"I've LOVED Dukes of Hazard since I was a kid and I'm so happy that they're finally releasing all of them together =)  This is just as good as the Seinfeld box set and I LOVE these boxed set seasons!

The best part is that Amazon has them for more than 1/2 off the retail price !!!  So I saved a bunch of money too =)

Back to watching more Dukes, I've got something like 89 hours left =)",1207267200,10,387,3.8607594936708862

RE: ""This title will be released on November 14, 2017"".....
QUESTION: Does anyone know if this is going to be a better mastering than the previous releases that ALL seem to have at least a few flawed discs?
Personally, I would like to see a Dukes release where all the crap-tastic double-sided discs are all replaced with single-sided ones.

The double-sided discs seem to be the problematic ones in every previous release.",1506124800,,452,5.026666666666666

2639245,4,B000HLDFA4,"The first season was the best, but nostalgia makes me love watching the reruns of all of the series.

I was happy when my wife bought me the complete set--the one in the orange box that also included the later movies. The box itself looks good on the shelf but is slightly annoying when trying to switch disks. That set also included the two movies--both in the unrated versions. Sadly, it didn't include the horrible cartoon.

Each series is complete with some slim bonus features. Having them on the shelf has meant that I can rewatch this show as much as I want. After rewatching, the first season is the best. The backlot of California studios is not as good as the Georgia backdrops.",1473897600,,688,4.540322580645161

2639249,5,B000HLDFA4,"One of the truly great shows - family-oriented, freedom-loving, fun-spirited! Wonderful to be able to visit Hazzard County anytime we want.

The collection itself is terrific - at least as far as the TV shows themselves. Whatever marketing genius thought they needed to pair the show itself with the ridiculously awful modern movie versions needs to find a job at which they are actually competent. But easy enough to throw that trash away... Would have preferred if they had included reunion shows and/or ""Behind the Scenes"" stuff.

Physically, the case seems plenty sturdy enough - with good-looking graphics all around.

I feel I wouldn't be doing the Dukes, and all the cast & crew for that matter, justice if I didn't address the recent totally misguided P.C. backlash - after all perhaps THE primary message of the show is the import and value of ""fighting the system"" in pursuit of that which is truly right. And recognizing that Amazon is not really the best location for thorough social discourse, I will simply say that if anyone believes that there is anything even slightly unwholesome, racist, or degrading about this show, then I know for certain that they have not REALLY watched the show. The show is all about positive messages around family, love, honor, respect, the golden rule, and just generally doing the right thing.

Many of the discs have titles that will not play and an inspection of the disc reveals deep scratches.  Many of the seasons have dual sided discs just crammed into a standard width DVD case.  After many attempts at playing them, I gave up and found a torrent.  Totally unacceptable QC from an industry that seems to have nothing but contempt for its customers.

Great care chases.. If you are not sure of plot look up on internet. You tube has short version of it. According to Dukes interview they wrecked 303 cars. The first season the only burned one side of the disc. The second season the got cheap. BURNED BOTH SIDE OF DISC. The second season only burned one side of disc..
The third season they BURNED BOTH sides. The fourth season burned one side of disc. The fourth season burned ne side of disc. Soon as watch others will add if one side burned or two sides burned. This is NOT IN ONE BOX SET. The shrink wrapped all of boxes to make one set. Yes it is cheaper to buy them each than as set. But when I ordered mine couple of the season only had 1 or two left. So I did not want to miss couple seasons buy ordering them alone. When they are out of stock never no how long takes to come back in stock. The extra interviews and specials were nice touch. Which is how I know 303 General Lee wreaked. Also bought the Dukes Of Hazzard book. Some of
the facts are off in it. If you are fan of show you will spot them. But still is nice read.  Season 6 they cheaped out and burned on BOTH SIDE OF DISC.",1465862400,7,1305,4.019230769230769

2639271,4,B000HLDFA4,"The show is as great as. Funny, action packed and full of great car chases and stunts. Though honestly the 7th season is pretty bad especially when they started doing the stunts with model cars and made the plots more and more ridiculous. But still I highly recommend the show if your a fan of car chases, comedy and classic shows like Knight Rider or The A-Team.

The box it comes in is nice but how the DVDs are sorted per case is isn't great. Some are stacked on a single peg inside the case which is bad enough with single sided DVDs but they also do that with double sided DVDs which are easily worn, damaged or scratched. So you have to be super careful with them. It would have made more sense to give each disk single sided and given it's own holder inside the cases. Granted it's more space inside the box but they could have excluded the reboot and prequel movies in the set or put them in a single two disk case which would have made more sense.",1463184000,2,956,4.224043715846994

2639291,5,B000HLDFA4,"This  use  to  be  one  of  my  favorite  shows  as  a  kid  a  long  time  ago.  No  other  show  that  I  know  of  has  more  car  stunts  then  this  one.  There  are  more  crazy  jumps  with  Bo  &  Luke  then  I  care  to  count.  &  that  red  car  of  theirs  never  suffers  any  damages  from  the  jumps  it  makes  at  all!  Roscoe's  car  does  once  in  a  while.  I've  thought  about  it  so  many  times,  (Why  is  it  the  Duke  boys  never  use  the  doors  when  getting  in  &  out  of  the  General?  I  guess  it  saves  them  time.  They  have  to  move  like  someone's  snapping  their  fingers,  chop, chop,  No  time  to  lose!  I  love  how  they  just  crawl  in  &  of  out  the  windows.  Or  maybe  their  doors  stopped  working  at  some  point  or  another.  Who  knows,  who  cares.  &  its  the  only  place  where  you  can  take  a  cruise  on  the  county  roads  &  stir  up  the  dust.  Sounds  like  the  kind  of  life  I'd  like  to  have.  A  place  where  the  traffic  lights  are  just  counted  out.  If  you  don't  have  a  sense of  humor  then  this  show  just  isn't  for  you!
The  show  is  cool,  as  well  as  all  the  characters.  Now  I  own  it  on  DVD.  The  DVD's  you  have  to  flip  them  over.  You  got  both  sides  A  &  B.
Its  not  easy  sometimes  to  keep  from  damaging  the  DVDs  having  to  flip  them  over.
Boss  Hogg  likes  to  walk  a  straight  line  &  keep  everything  running  smoothly  his  way.
He  plays  the  character  who  is  never  short  of  a  gibberish  personality.
&  Bo  &  Luke  flee  just  when  you  think  Roscoe  has  nabbed  them!
Laughs  silly  being  obsessed  with  catching  &  arresting  the  Duke  boys.  Well  I don't  know  Roscoe,  you  have  to  be  pretty  darn  clever  to  catch  these  2!  &  by  the  way,  Roscoe  (James Best)  is  not  the  same  person
 who  does  the  voice  for  Chief  from  (The  fox  &  the  hound)  I  thought
 that  it  was.  &  of  course  you  got  the  narrator  who  is  (Waylon Jennings).  I  never  really  get  tired  of  him.  In  fact  I'm  glad  that  he's  there!
Anyways  I  like  the  show. &  its  great  to  own  it  now  on  DVD.
I  am  thrilled!  I  think  I  got  a  pretty  darn  good  deal  if  you  ask  me.  If  the  complete  series  had  of  costed  me  175.00  I  don't  think  I  would  have  gotten  this.
But  I'm  happy.  That's  all  I  can  tell  you!  You  compare  this  show  to  the  A Team  series,  its  kind  of  hard  to  tell  which  show  is  better.  What  they  got  in  common  is  the  stunts.  They  almost  match  up.  Not  quite.
I  got  one  tip  for  anyone  who  may  want  to  buy  the  complete  series.  On  those  discs  that  you  have  to  flip  over
I  noticed  when  I  hit  the  play  button  every  time  I  here  a  scratching  noise,  luckily  it  only  lasts  for  a  second.  This  is  after  I  turn  on  the  receiver  for  the  first  time,  not  after  pausing.  On  the  other  shows  I  got  none  of  the  DVD  discs  do  this,  just  on  these.  You  guys  might  want  to  look  into  this.
So  far  it  doesn't  seem  like  anything  I  need  to  worry  about.  I  hope  not.  Maybe  I'm  wrong!",1456012800,,3228,3.8646209386281587

2639379,5,B000HLDFA4,"From 1979 to 1985, the very popular CBS program ""The Dukes Of Hazzard"" became a fixture and staple of Friday evenings for many viewers during that time (myself included). The show produced a total of 145 episodes, each time scoring high in the Nielsen ratings. Taking place in fictional Hazzard county in the Southern United States, the series focused on the continuing adventures of cousins Bo (John Schneider), Luke (Tom Wopat) and Daisy (Catherine Bach), along with the family patriarch Uncle Jesse (Denver Pyle), as they continually try to outwit the corrupt County Commissioner J. D. Hogg (Sorrell Booke) and the town's sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane (James Best). Usually assisting Hogg and Roscoe in their schemes are deputies Enos Strate (Sonny Shroyer)and Cletus Hogg (Rick Hurst). The Dukes are also good friends with the town mechanic Cooter Davenport (Ben Jones). Appearing in several of the season five episodes are cousins Vance (Christopher Mayer) and Coy (Byron Cherry), who stayed on the Duke farm while Bo and Luke went to realize a life-long dream of racing on the NASCAR circuit. Occasionally visiting in Hazzard is Boss Hogg's crooked nephew Hughie Hogg (Jeff Altman), who usually ends up more dishonest than his uncle. Boss Hogg's wife, and Rosco's ""fat sister"", was Lulu Coltrane Hogg (Peggy Rea), who constantly challenged her husband for authority and rallied for the equality of women in Hazzard, and was one of the few people in Hazzard that Hogg was actually scared of, though he seemed to genuinely love and care for her. The main narrator of the series for the entire run of the show was Country music superstar Waylon Jennings, who is credited as the Balladeer. After numerous requests from fans to see the Balladeer on-screen, Waylon finally appeared in one episode, the seventh season's aptly titled ""Welcome, Waylon Jennings"", in which he was presented as an old friend of the Dukes. Of course, there were many other celebrities who made guest appearances on the show, as well: Cale Yarborough, Jaine Fricke, Mel Tillis, Loretta Lynn, Roy Orbison, Johnny Paycheck, Dottie West, Tammy Wynette, Hoyt Axton, Donna Fargo, Freddy Fender, The Oak Ridge Boys and Buck Owens made cameos as themselves in various episodes. Now, all 145 episodes from all 7 complete seasons are gathered together in this massive collection, contained on 38 DVD discs. Each show is presented in its original, chronological order of broadcast. There are also numerous DVD extras that showcase the on-going popularity and legacy of this unique series, created by Gy Waldron. So, sit back and take a spin in the General Lee over to the Boar's Nest for some good old down-home fun, with ""The Dukes Of Hazzard"" on DVD.",1340841600,28,2715,5.035555555555556
2639380,4,B000HLDFA4,"THE DUKES OF HAZZARD ran on CBS from 1979-85 and was a comedy/drama series about 2 cousins known as the ""Duke Boys"" which were Bo Duke(John Schneider)and Luke Duke(Tom Wopat)who lived in a rural part of the fictional Hazzard County, Georgia with their foxy cousin Daisy Duke(Catherine Bach)and their wise old widowed Uncle Jesse(Denver Pyle)as Bo & Luke would often race around in their customized souped up '69 Dodge Charger called the General Lee evading the scheming corrupt police commisioner Boss Jefferson Davis Hogg(Sorrell Booke) who was always looking for an excuse to get the Dukes busted & out of the picture and Boss's incompetent county Sheriff Roscoe Coltrane(Jim Best)who was like his partner-in-crime, but Bo and Luke would somehow alway manage to get caught in the middle of various escapades & incidents that often occured in the area.

Since Bo and Luke and Uncle Jesse were on probation for previously transporting moonshine in the past, Bo & Luke would use bows and arrows for defense instead of guns since the Duke boys weren't allowed to use firearms, but Bo and Luke would still always manage to foil the disgruntled Boss's illegal scams.

The Dukes also had their wild rebellious mechanic Cooter Davenport(Ben Jones)who was often breaking or treading on the edge of the law who was also the Dukes best friend and considered part of the Duke family.

Deputy Enos Strate(Sonny Shroyer)was an honest, but naive young officer who often found conflicting morals since he was often reluctantly forced to take part in Boss and Roscoe's crooked schemes, but then Sonny Shroyer(Enos) left the show in the Dukes 1980-81 Season to start his own short-lived spinoff series ENOS which flopped and then cancelled by the Summer of 1981 and didn't return to the show until the Fall of 1982 when Schneider and Wopat left the show briefly, due to a salary dispute with Warner Bros.

Therefore, Enos was replaced by Boss Hogg's doofus cousin Deputy Cletus Hogg(Rick Hurst)in the 3rd and 4th Seasons of the DUKES OF HAZZARD in Enos's absence, but was even more clumsy & naive than Enos was, but was also a reluctant participant in Hogg's plans, but then Cletus was ousted in the Dukes 1982-83 Season when Enos returned to the show to be sworn back in as Roscoe and Boss's fellow deputy, but had temporarily partnered up with Cletus in the first 5 episodes of the Dukes 5th Season, but had no real explanation on why Cletus left and had only mentioned 1 time that Cletus had gone on vacation, but was never seen, mentioned, or returned again after the ""Big Daddy"" episode when Cletus made his last appearance as if Cletus never even existed.

In addition to the changes that occured in the DUKES OF HAZZARD's 5th Season; since John Schneider(Bo)and Tom Wopat(Luke)didn't report report to the set in the Spring of 1982 while filming was due to begin for the Dukes 1982-1983 Season since Season 5 was underway; the producers had to improvise by bringing in the new Dukes reluctantly hiring 2 lookalike replacements Byron Cherry(Coy Duke) and Chris Mayer(Vance Duke)as Uncle Jesse's long lost distant nephews to replace Bo and Luke which had so-called left Hazzard County to go race on the NASCAR circuit, but then the DUKES OF HAZZARD took a sharp nose-dive in the ratings which prompted the producers to bring the old Dukes back since the show was hurting and not going in the right direction without Bo and Luke.

Therefore, they brought the old Dukes back in the Winter of 1983 in the ""Welcome Back Bo & Luke"" episode when Bo and Luke had supposedly changed their minds and returned to Hazzard County after their NASCAR tour while Coy & Vance left Hazzard County to take care of a sick relative which resulted in Coy & Vance only lasting 17 episodes since the new Dukes were ousted from the show after only 5 months along with the fact that Cherry & Mayer were originally only contracted for just 10 episodes as stand-ins still with hope of a settlement being reached with Schneider & Wopat, especially since the scripts that were written for Coy & Vance were originally scheduled for Bo and Luke, but were literally crossed out and then penned in for Coy & Vance, due to Bo and Luke's absence, but this shows significant drop in ratings prompted Warner Bros. to renegotiate with Wopat and Schneider & a settlement with them was finally reached and the show proceeded with Bo and Luke for 2 more seasons.

Unfortunately, even the return of Bo and Luke was welcomed by ardent and casual viewers and Duke fans alike & resulted in a slight recovery in ratings, THE DUKES OF HAZZARD never completley regained its former popularity and never returned to its former glory since the premiere of KNIGHT RIDER on NBC in the Fall of 1982 had stole the Dukes thunder and became the hottest car on Friday nights, especially since supercar KITT outclassed the General Lee & had 10 times more breathtaking feats and advantages than the General Lee ever along with the fact that KNIGHT RIDER wiped everything out in the ratings back then at number 3 and had K.O.'d THE DUKES OF HAZZARD practically beating the Dukes to a pulp since the Knight 2000 made the General Lee pale by comparison.

Therefore the DUKES OF HAZZARD couldn't compete with KNIGHT RIDER and CBS had suddenly cancelled the DUKES OF HAZZARD quietly ending its 7-year run in the middle of its 1984-85 Season in the Winter of 1985 after showing its last episode ""Opening Night At The Boars Nest"" on 2/8/85 resulting in the Dukes 7th Season being an abbreviated season along with the fact that this show went stale, the Dukes were getting tired, and the whole cast & crew of the show ran out of steam.

Overall, I loved this show growing up and it was one of my childhood favorites that I watched throughout it's whole 1979-85 run on CBS, but I don't see why Warner Bros. felt a need to release the DUKES OF HAZZARD on a complete series DVD box set like Universal did with the ROCKFORD FILES, the INCREDIBLE HULK, KNIGHT RIDER, MIAMI VICE, MAGNUM, A-TEAM, AIRWOLF, etc; but my hunch on why Warner Bros. decided to make a complete series box set of the DUKES OF HAZZARD even though Warner Bros. already has all 7 seasons of the Dukes in individual box sets like Universal already had with the INCREDIBLE HULK, KNIGHT RIDER, the ROCKFORD FILES, etc. is perhaps due to the 2-sided discs on the individual DVD box sets freezing and skipping at times which was the same problem that Universal had with the double-sided discs on their individual season box sets which prompted Universal to re-release a lot of their classic TV shows with 1-sided discs instead of 2-sided discs.

So I suspect that Warner Bros. was inspired to do the same thing with some of their classic TV show DVD box sets like the DUKES OF HAZZARD and WONDER WOMAN for instance which both have a complete series box set as well as individual season box sets.

However, this show takes me all the way back to memory lane to when it was part of CBS's Friday night line up since I used to watch the DUKES OF HAZZARD at 9PM preceeding DALLAS at 10PM after I'd watch the INCREDIBLE HULK at 8PM which was CBS's Friday night schedule from January of 1979 thru November of 1981, but then the DUKES OF HAZZARD was moved to 8PM and DALLAS was moved to 9PM when CBS had cancelled the INCREDIBLE HULK all of the sudden in the middle of the Hulks short-lived 5th Season in mid November of 1981, due to budget cuts which resulted in the Dukes taking the 8PM slot away from the Hulk since the DUKES OF HAZZARD remained at 8PM every Friday night from mid November of 1981 till it tanked in February of 1985.

Something else I cant help finding intriguing about this show is rumor has it that the premiere of the DUKES OF HAZZARD in the Winter of 1979 resulted in the ROCKFORD FILES cancellation in the Winter of 1980 since the Dukes 9PM time slot on CBS conflicted with Rockford's 9PM time slot on NBC which resulted in the ROCKFORD FILES getting a slight decrease in ratings since the ROCKFORD FILES started losing a lot of viewers thru the DUKES OF HAZZARD since the Dukes were brand spankin new and an instant smash when it debuted on CBS on Friday January 26, 1979 when Rockford was in the middle of its 5th Season along with the fact that the DUKES OF HAZZARD was in its honeymoon phase of the show while the ROCKFORD FILES honeymoon phase of the show was already long gone.

Therefore, you could say that the Dukes beat Rockford to a pulp since the DUKES OF HAZZARD had K.O.'d the ROCKFORD FILES in the ratings since Bo and Luke(John Schneider) were peaking while Jim Rockford(James Garner)was creaking since Garner had ran out of steam and had reached a saturation point with his Rockford character unlike Schneider & Wopat which were just getting started in their acting career and their series with lots of spunk and energy while Rockford was getting tired and starting to drag since age caught up with Garner forcing him to quit the show.

Unfortunately NBC had cancelled the ROCKFORD FILES all of the sudden in the middle of its 6th Season after showing its final episode on Thursday January 10, 1980, due to James Garner developing chronic back and knee problems.",1340064000,7,9177,4.663782447466008

Before you purchase this product, here is something you need to know.  It is CHEAPER to purchase Seasons 1-7 INDEPENDENTLY rather than this set.  The price for Seasons 1-7 independently is $111.93...compared to the price of $203.99 for this set...that's a difference of $92.06!  Check it out for yourself, do the math, and save some money for the same product!  Keep between the ditches!!",1216166400,126,563,4.636363636363637
