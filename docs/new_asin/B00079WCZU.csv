8046368,5,B00079WCZU,I used to watch this when I was a little boy in the 1970's. The last time I saw this movie was when I was in my early 20's. i finally found someone who was selling it and didn't want a fortune for it. Great disney movie from the late 60's. Highly Recommended. If you are a disney fan Buy it.,1341273600,2,291,3.7868852459016393
8046369,4,B00079WCZU,"This video has 2 separate episodes from ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show that played on Sunday nights from 1953 to 1983. The first is the very popular ""The Ranger of Brownstone"", originally aired in 1968, and again in 74, 77, 79, and 82.  The episode is basically a compilation of six animated shorts that are edited into one long storyline. The best is the one with the music that every kid gets up and dances to, as the ranger directs the bears to pick up trash. Most of the stories feature the hilarious Humphrey the Bear trying to outwit the ranger in getting food where he is told not to... )This predates Yogi Bear and his Ranger from Hanna Barbera). Ranger Woodlore tries to run his forest in an orderly fashion but with Humphrey around anything and everything goes wrong. This compilation works and is hysterically funny.

This next episode first aired in 1970, then 71, and 77. ""Its Tough to be a Bird"" is the theatrical featurette that won an Academy Award  for Best Cartoon Subject 1969. It had been edited to lengthen it for the TV episode, and features a story about the trials and tribulations of being a bird in a man's world. They are shot at for starters, and yet man wishes he could fly like a bird. Very unusual animation style for Disney.
I highly recommend this video and others in the series.

Disney released many other titles from the TV episodes, just search on Amazon under ""Wonderful World of Disney"". To learn more about other episodes in the television series buy the book ""The Wonderful World of Disney Television, by Bill Cotter"", also available at Amazon.",1111536000,22,1602,4.630281690140845
