2568120,5,B000FIMG40,"I don't know how anyone could rate this film lower than five stars; unless they watched the film on a cheap TV with a small screen. `Roving Mars' on blu-ray blew me away by the quality of the IMAX HD cinematography focusing on the manufacturing of the rovers.  I was captivated by a realistic depiction of what it takes to get a spacecraft to make a 300 million mile hole-in-one landing.

I had read a review on Netflix where the wannabe critique stated that they didn't like all the CGI; they probably didn't know that some of the extraordinary footage of the mars terrain was actual footage from the HD-quality cameras on-board the rovers. It might have helped the common laymen if the filmmakers had indicted where the CGI stopped and the actual footage from mars began. I've been so engrossed by the rover missions (NASA made all the rover stills, panoramas and video available for download to the public, ever since the missions began [...]) I knew when I was when observing actual film-footage from mars, but I hadn't witnessed the utter clarity of the videos by playback on the computer. I'm astounded by the fact that the rovers are still up there working after four years, and this DVD will have a special place in my heart and in my imagination for the rest of my life imprisoned here on the earth.

In reference to the low ratings listed here: pretty much all IMAX documentaries are less than 60 minutes because of the giant-size of the actual IMAX film used for projection in IMAX theaters. I think its well worth twenty-bucks. It's something you'll proudly enjoy showing to your friends; providing you have a quality TV screen or projector.",1199318400,20,1653,4.673539518900344
2568121,2,B000FIMG40,"I'm very excited about science and engineering. We can't take for granted the courage and brilliance it took NASA and its contractors to design, implement, and deploy the equipment for this mission, then exercise the robots for this mission. And they did it all for less than what we pay for a baseball stadium!

This 40-minute film is disappointing, however. It's short on science; there is no discussion of the launch planning, the path of the rover as it travels to Mars, or any interesting facts. What is its weight? How did the timing work? How did the engineers design the rover, and measure its performance? What materials were used in its implementation? What diagnostics did it have? How much power did it use? What challenges were involved in surviving the harsh Martian atmosphere, its cold, the dust, and its chemistry?

The questions I have are simple, and endless. This film addressed none of them, I'm afraid. Worse, as others have pointed out, there's very little actual footage from the rovers. Most of the CGI scenes are flawed -- seeing stars through the shadowed surface of the moon, for example.

I admire the engineers and explorers in our space programs as heroes. This film does them disservice by failing to tell their wonderful story.",1197331200,36,1260,4.878504672897196

2568123,5,B000FIMG40,"This is the closest you will probably ever get to travelling to another world. A riveting story of how the Mars Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity travelled to Mars on their hugely successful mission. I too, took my 3 and 5 year old to see this at an IMAX and they were engrossed. The film is slightly extended from its original release to show the Victoria Crater that Opportunity will enter.
The launch and landing sequences are great and I recommend turning up the volume a notch or two for those.
Definitely recommended for those with enquiring minds.",1190764800,,551,4.690721649484536
2568124,5,B000FIMG40,"I have seen several other DVDs on the Rovers, on PBS television shows, but this one came directly from a theatrical release in IMAX format and is by far the best of the best.

The ""Roving Mars"" DVD has both standard 4x3 and 16x9 (enhanced) formats.  The latter fits a HDTV screen perfectly (1.78:1 aspect ratio) and looks superb when played from an upscaling or HD DVD player.

The introduction is narrated by a noticeably feeble voice over by Paul Neuman.  However, the main storyline is covered by the Lead Scientist, Steve Skyiers, who does a great job explaining the Mars Rovers - there are two, Spirit and Opportunity - without beating you up with  technospeak.

""Rovering Mars"" is only 40 minutes, but there are two extras provided on the same DVD; a 1957 Disney TV program called ""Mars And Beyond"", which is quite dated and rather cartoonish.  Fortunately, there is another extra about 25 minutes in duration, called ""Mars: Past, Present and Future"".  The latter is just as good as the main feature, a bunch of extra scenes that for whatever reason were (needlessly) editted out of the IMAX film.

The filmmakers did a great job with the animated special effects to accurately depict what the actual rocket launcher liftoffs from Cape Kennedy, and departures from Earth's gravity would have looked like from space.  The Martian landings took place many months later, about three weeks apart.  Amazingly realistic computer graphics were used to make this movie!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1188086400,13,1488,4.931726907630522

We searched the gift shop for the video but were disappointed that it had not yet been released.  Several weeks later I came across it quite by accident on TV and taped it for my older son, who loves outer space and has been fascinated by Mars and the rovers since our trip to the museum.  Most general audience space documentaries do not keep his attention, but he loved this one.  The narration is almost conversational, not your typical dry, boring voiceover.  The video is informative enough for adults and yet still accessible for kids.  The images are amazing, no matter what your age.

2568174,5,B000FIMG40,"From Walt Disney Studios comes Roving Mars, a George Butler film and presentation by LockheedMartin and NASA in the form of a captivating 40 minute film showing the detailed martian rover work at the Jet Propulsion Lab, the Kennedy Space Center, and other locales. Following that are computer animations of the successful launch from Earth across 300 million miles of space, and the sequential landings on Mars of, not 1, but 2 rovers six months later: Spirit"" and Opportunity"". NASAs Jet Propulsion Labs formed a group of scientists to run the project whose objective was to reveal if water existed or stills exists on Mars as a main goal. Most of the film shows the process of building the rovers and a part deals with the crucial parachute and landing systems. The end of the film shows actual and animated footage of the 2 Mars rovers and their journeys over the Red Planets desolate landscape in search of scientific discoveries, far exceeding their life expectancies. Quite a feat considering the fact that two-thirds of Mars launches over the decades missed the target. Highly Recommended. Five SCIENTIFIC Stars!

2568176,5,B000FIMG40,Being a Sci-Fi nut I suppose you would figure I am bound to like any documentary regarding outer space and you would be correct. I enjoyed this one about Mars because it is a very informative documentary. The picture and sound quality is brilliant. If like me your a scaredy cat this is as far into space as you would go even if space travel was possible.

2568212,5,B000FIMG40,"We are big fans of the Nasa program to explore Mars.  Our family contains tomorrow's astronauts.  So it was thrilling to see this incredably well done documentary, produced by Disney, that took on the excitement of the building, launch and touchdown of the two Mars robot rovers Spirit and Opportunity.

We had stayed up until 2:30 a.m. to watch the touchdown of the rover Curiosity on Mars and it was the most thrilling thing any of my family has ever seen.  We will talk about it for a long time.  So I decided to see if I could find any more documentaries about Mars exploration.

This was extraordinary in it's thouroughness.  It takes you right there as they build the two small Mars rovers, launch them into space and land them on Mars.  How absolutely incredible that something 300 million miles away can be hit with our explorers and have it all go perfectly.

We know now that Mars was a very wet planet at one time long ago.  We know the soil and rock compositions found there.  We know that many minerals such as hematite and olivine that form in the presence of water are there in abundance.  We know that the dust that blankets all of Mars is strongly magnetic.  We know there has been a huge amount of volcanic activity, there are cirrus type clouds of water vapor there, water appears to ooze from the cracks in the rocks at certain times of the year, and there is a mysterious ""bloom"" of methane gas in the atmosphere near the equator in the summer months.

Was there ever life there?  That is the big question and one hopefully soon to be answered by Curiosity.  And if life was (or is) there, it isn't a huge leap to assume that life is everywhere there is water.

This was just fantastic and took us by surprise as a very complete and well done documentary for those who are excited by the explorations by robot of Mars.",1345075200,,1839,4.425595238095238

2568214,5,B000FIMG40,"I just took my 15 year old son and a friend to the Petaluma Museum's showing of the Smithsonian traveling exhibit, ""Beyond: Visions of Planetary Landscapes"". The photos were breathtaking, and at the end, we sat and watched the whole 40 minute DVD of ""Roving Mars"".

This is a fabulous documentary!  First they are designing the rover (they actually sent up two identical ones, one right after the other), and you get a good idea of what a 20-year challenge that was. An ""origami"" rover - because after landing, it had to unfold itself.

Then there's wind-tunnel tests, looking for a parachute that wouldn't tear at 12,000 miles per hour. And the giant balloons that inflate around the rover and protect it after it BOUNCES across the Mars landscape on landing.

Even though we knew the rover missions were successful, the three of us were literally sitting on the edges of our seats, joining the nervous scientists at mission control, waiting to see if the little guy would survive the landing.

Disney did an excellent job on this movie. There's lots of real footage of the scientists at work and in the control room. I got such a kick out of the outdoor desert-y testing playground for the rovers, with a big sign in front of it stating ""Mars""! And there's fabulous CGI of the rocket in space and the landing, and the bouncing.

Both rovers, offically named Spirit and Opportunity, were designed to last 90 days and move around 600 feet.  Spirit sent back information for 6 years, 2 months and 19 days! According to a June 22, 2011, update on the
marsrover.nasa.gov website, Opportunity is still traveling, having so far clocked 19.3 miles!

I highly recommend this documentary, and am buying our own copy and a copy for a gift.

2568215,1,B000FIMG40,"Picture was not 1080p blu-ray quality. I own and watch many blu-ray and this one was more like DVD up-converted to 1080p. Maybe it's the IMAX camera, I was very disappointed in the picture quality. Some of the clips are not even HD, just standard SD. I watch all my blu-ray on a 106"" screen with high quality 1080p projector and this was terrible. May be okay on a smaller size HDTV but you will be disappointed with larger size HDTV or screen.

Roving Mars mainly focused on the beginning of the project up to the point both rovers landed at Mars. I felt cheated, didn't show any of the Rovers exploring Mars but the initial landing. I had hope to see more actual pictures of Mars, but only a few shots were included. I saw much more exploring and pictures of Mars from the Discovery channel show on this project than this blu-ray. Very disappointed in my purchase.",1301184000,4,866,4.446540880503145
2568216,5,B000FIMG40,"This is a quick and great overview of the Mars rover mission. The first three fifths of the movie is the preparation that was needed to build not only the rovers, but the landing mechanism to bring the bots safely to the ground once they got there. The remainder discusses the conditions once they got there and some of what they were able to find. There are not a whole lot of actual photographs and video that were sent by the rovers displayed here, it was mostly computer renderings.

When I say that it is quick, it really is. The DVD is 40 minutes long. There is obviously a lot more detail to the rover mission but for those who have a hobby-like interest or for a good family, educational viewing (maybe even a middle school or high school classroom), the visuals are great so visual learners should enjoy it.",1285200000,2,816,4.44
2568217,2,B000FIMG40,"The title of this DVD is a bit misleading. I was expecting to see actual images of Mars as seen from the Mar's rovers. Granted a few actual images were displayed but nothing that couldn't be obtained on the net.

The dvd largely concentrates on the planning of the rovers up to launch. Animation then takes over with the landing of the rovers and exploration of the surface.

Non the less the Dvd is enjoyable with great attention paid to the accuracy of the animation. Obviously it could not be expected to see the actual landing and deployment of the rovers if it weren't by animation.

If you are wanting to see real images of the Mars surface forget this DVd and wait until a Dvd comes out that does show the real images obtained from the rovers.",1256860800,6,750,4.420289855072464
2568254,3,B000FIMG40,"The concept is great, and you will learn a lot of great stuff about Mars and the voyages there.  But the execution fails slightly to live up to the promise.  It suggests that you'll feel like you're on Mars, and there's a bit of that, but most of it feels like computer-generated imagery more than actual footage, or the actual footage feels low-resolution.  Somehow, it all manages to fail to coalesce into a real feeling of being there.  The disc would be a solid disc on its own terms, but it just promises too much.",1242345600,2,519,4.431578947368421

2568259,5,B000FIMG40,"When the original broadcast of the bonus feature ""Mars and Beyond"" was aired on ABC in 1957, Sputnik was the first man made satellite. Televisions were black and white, had 12 possible channels, and no solid state components. Yet there it was, a vision of a Mars landing vehicle almost identical to what became the Apollo lunar lander when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon.

In this same 1957 Disney feature, we learn why space exploration is important - ""over population and the consumption of Earth's limited resources"" make expansion beyond our planet a necessity.

As a lesson in our capacity to imagine and create, and as a lesson in our ability to ignore unpleasant facts, this Disney show is a must see.

Roving Mars itself is an enjoyable documentary. Ponder a bit on what humans are capable of. Find reason to be optimistic that we can solve incredible challenges if we put our minds to it.",1216166400,,901,4.726114649681529

My guess is 60 percent is about the troubles of building the rovers, and then perhaps 35 percent is CG images of the rover landing on Mars, coming up to a rock, etc, and maybe only 5 minutes of this film (if that) actually contains any actual footage of the planet itself -- the real reason I wanted to watch this film!  The movie that I would love to see is one without any narrator, but with just images capturing the sublime grandeur of space (in this case Mars) paired of with some kind of subtle music by someone like Brian Eno.

That said, the CG images were nicely done, and some of the scenes of them building the rovers were interesting.  My final advice, rent it first (I did) before you decide if you really want to buy it.  I'm going to save my money for something else.",1207180800,7,968,4.26775956284153
2568262,5,B000FIMG40,"UPDATED 5/17/08: This is a great movie to introduce people to the story of the Mars Rovers Spirit and Opportunity. Ages of interest probably start at pre-teens to adults! Young children may get lost in some of the science, the dialogue, and the movie's pacing. This IS NOT a ""child's"" cartoon, and NO, it is NOT a grand Martian photo / footage feast either! :D The movie does contain a considerable amount of expository CGI and modeling, but I found them fascinating and educational in the context of what the movie was trying to communicate. People who want a wealth of real Mars views and Mars facts should visit NASA's official websites and see the rovers' ""Postcard"" movies, which show images of surface features.

For me, what makes this movie worth watching is the human connections that are made: Spirit had to work hard to achieve its success; Opportunity landed in an area where success was guaranteed. The ""teaching"" analogy here is some folks have to work hard for what they get while others seem to have the cosmos handed to them on a string. :) Yet, both types are important because they contribute to the whole of humanity.

In the movie, I saw the scientists' affection and enthusiasm for the rovers and how the rovers seem to develop their own personalities based on their experiences on Earth and Mars. After seeing the movie, I was ready to explore more of the ""real"" Mars and Martian features given on NASA's webpages.

Roving Mars may not be everyone's cup of tea. However, I enjoyed it because I am a fan of the Red Planet and its media and myths. In a world full of negative news and war, it's an uplifting 40 minutes. Don't we all need somethings uplifting?",1204761600,4,1680,4.630872483221476

It's a wax museum, but wax figures look far more life-like then what's on display here.
Aliasing is a constant problem too, but it's obscured by all the DNR, so it isn't as distracting as it would be.
Same goes for banding, which is not a major problem. The DNR kills this feautre completely. EE runs rampant too!
I couldn't even concentrate on the dialogue, and had to look away.
I watched it on a mere 50inch HDTV from 5.2 feet away.

SQ: No problems here. It's powerful and dynamic with some lovely use of surround. Pretty powerful stuff.

Extras: This is what single-handedly saves this BD, as it contains one fantastic and one pretty good extra.
The fantastic one is a bonus movie called Mars and Beyond from 1957. It's a must see, and should be seen before the main feature, if that were any good that is. It's 50min long and quite in-depth, featuring some truly imaginative animation, and interesting hypothesis.
The pretty good one is a sort of a making of called Mars: Past, Present & Future and runs 25min.
The PQ of both of these is better than the main feautre.
The 1957 movie has some specks, but nothing distracting.

This is one to get for the extras alone.
