4080240,5,B00376AVIA,Very Funny!!!!!!!!! Brings me back to the original films and skits... they never lost their touch after 25 years apart.,1273968000,2,119,5.0
4080241,1,B00376AVIA,"I rented this on 4/20 from the playstation store thinking it would be the perfect rental.  I got about 20 minutes through when I finally couldn't take it anymore and stopped the movie.  It's not funny.  What a waste of my time of all days, how disappointing.  Cheech & Chong essentially move around a lot, mention words like bong, joint, dope, weed, etc and hope people are stoned enough to laugh at them.  Most of the jokes aren't even really jokes it's just Cheech & Chong sitting on chairs pretending they're smoking and making stupid comments.  Anyone who actually enjoyed this must have been doing something much harder than marijuana.  Between the stand-up there's little snippets where some old blonde lady talks to people about why they like pot.

Here's a suggestion I can give to anyone who's still thinking of renting this.  Go down to the apartments near your local community college.  Watch the stoners that live there and ask them why they like pot.  I guarantee you it will be more entertaining than this DVD.",1273104000,4,1024,4.728813559322034
4080242,5,B00376AVIA,"In other reviews of ""live"" shows from comedy to Rock I usually say that my acid test is if I saw the show is it a good representation and if I didn't am I mad at myself for missing it...and I am furious that I didn't catch these guys on this tour because I think I'd still be laughing.  I picked up the blu-ray and the production values are top notch. Its also a unique way to present a live show with many inserted bits (I do not want to give them away) that while not giving the viewer the exact live feel maybe improve it to almost movie level...in fact this is more a concert movie than a documentary of a show....and that's not a bad thing..it means more laughs!!

There are also plentiful bonus features that I believe make this worthwhile to purchase. If you are a fan that goes back to their initial films and ""records man"" ...ooops , then this will be a lovely trip back.",1271721600,11,880,4.170588235294118
4080243,5,B00376AVIA,"If you are a casual or even huge Cheech & Chong fan, you will find something that you will enjoy in this DVD. For the casual fan, you will see all of the classic C&C bits, but for the hardcore fan, you will get so much more. Old faves are flipped in new ways, updated for the times, making them even more hilarious than the first time around, & various characters that the duo have performed as make appearances throughout as well. Also, you get a bit of Shelby Chong's performance & bits of Tommy Chong doing solo bits about pot (duh) & being incarcerated for selling bongs (see the documentary ""a/k/a Tommy Chong"" for more information). The production quality is top notch, & the program flows so well, interweaving between stage bits & backstage or character bits.

Even better, this show was shot in my hometown (San Antonio TX) at a theatre (The Majestic Theatre) that I have been to many times. I have even been on the outside balcony area that the two end up on trying to smoke a fatty in the DVD (don't want to give to much away, but it is one of the funniest parts). Also, make sure to stick around until after the credits for a quick bonus. Dave was here.",1271548800,23,1165,4.344036697247707

4080586,3,B00376AVIA,"CHEECH & CHONG'S ""HEY WATCH THIS!"": Throughout the seventies, CHEECH & CHONG were the rock & roll generation's numero uno stoner comedy team, pumping out a series of Acapulco gold albums like BIG BAMBU and LOS COCHINOS and motion pictures, notably UP IN SMOKE. In this filmed version of their 2009 reunion tour the dope obsessed duo are much older, thankfully no wiser and best of all, still funny. Trotting out their beloved assortment of crude characters, PEDRO & THE MAN, horny mutts RALPH AND HERBIE, blues singer BLIND MELON CHITLIN and tutu wearing glam rocker ALICE BOWIE among them, these raunchy, cartoonish routines will be familiar to fifty somethings jonesing for a nostalgic high; even SISTER MARY ELEPHANT gets in a cameo. Linked by emcee TOMMY CHONG's mellowed out standup comedy and the team's so-so backstage antics, some bits (LET'S MAKE A DOPE DEAL, an audience sing along of UP IN SMOKE) far outshine others (BORN IN EAST L.A.)...still, this is a vast improvement over their '83 concert flick STILL SMOKIN'. For those high school heads who couldn't make CHEECH & CHONG's latest trip in person (or don't remember if they went or not), HEY WATCH THIS scores high as a freaky, fun-filled flashback.

4080590,2,B00376AVIA,"I was a big fan of C&C back in the 70's & 80's. I bought all their albums, which were then taken away by my father, so I bought them again. They were funny and we would all do their bits - DAVE'S not HERE! I even did my own version of ""Earache My Eye"" with my band back in the late 70's. These guys were COOL!!!

Now here we are in the 21st century. We're not kids anymore, and with having been educated into the ""PC"" era a LOT of things we once laughed at just aren't funny anymore. They try to make fun of gays, cross-dressers, stoners, blacks, mexicans, and indirectly, blondes (Shelby). It just DOESN'T WORK. It ain't funny... why? Could it be that we've matured and are now more sensitive? Could it be that we aren't wasted? Could it be that they don't look the same, that because THEY are old that the lines don't work?

I watched ""Up In Smoke"" again recently to try to figure it out. Yes, I've watched this movie about a THOUSAND TIMES and know ALL the lines. I don't laugh at it like I first did, but a LOT of it is still FUNNY! The characters, the interaction, the JOKES are done with style and timing. I wish this would have been the way this... thing came off, but it didn't.

The ""live show"" strung together with other bits that were supposed to be backstage or in the balcony were more of a distraction than anything else. I would say they ruined it, but that would imply that it could have been good without them. This is clearly NOT the case. This was BAD from the ground up.

If you are determined to watch this in spite of my warnings, make sure you are under the influence of SOMETHING - anything!!! Test yourself to make sure you are in the right ""state of mind"". Take off your left shoe and sock and wiggle your toes. If this causes you to burst out in hysterical laughter, then your READY! Anything less will NOT cut it!!!

Perhaps there was a good reason they broke up ""way back when"". Maybe THEY realized they didn't have it anymore and didn't want to take away from the memory of ""the magic"" they had. If so, they were right.

RIP, Cheech and Chong. I really miss you guys! Something should be done about the impostors in this ""film"".",1365897600,4,2158,4.225728155339806

4080597,1,B00376AVIA,"One complaint you will hear about Elvis is that at the end he was old, bloated and not the same he was twenty years earlier. I love Cheech and Chong, saw them in concert during the 70s and early 80s. I bought this DVD because their show sold out here in Houston twice. I was shocked they were doing the same skits they did back then and in the movie UP IN SMOKE. How the people found this funny I am amazed. The show was interrupted with stupid commentary and stupid subjects.
I was very disappointed...You will laugh ten times more by watching UP IN SMOKE again.",1351123200,4,563,4.271028037383178

Their timing, their characters, their genius is shown here bare on stage the way they began. This may not be for everyone, but from the perspective of a life long fan I enjoyed it completly and found new laughs. Long Live Cheech and Chong!",1296345600,,362,4.338235294117647

4080606,1,B00376AVIA,"Holy Up in Smoke.... is there anything worse than this?  First of all, you cannot recreate or attempt to invigorate the classic Cheech and Chong.  Leave well enough alone.  I went into this with apprehension and was right; it was so pathetic.

Cheech and Chong have so much going on here;  they role play as two men watching the stage show; they are two ""thumbs up"" critics, Chong does stand-up for a while; they rehash some great scenes from the classic ""UP in Smoke"", but seriously, that film is rather historic, leave it alone.  Plus, you will be privy to some behind the scenes nonsense too.  Then, they have a pathetic skit that they are two dogs, nothing funny, just disgusting.  Chong plays the role of a blind guitarist, and continuing to be bad is another lame skit is an old couple viewing a porn film, one telling the other what is going on.  Not funnnnnyyyy.

Chong's wife Shelby has a small part in interviewing the two, plus she comes on, trying to lead the audience on.  She looks like some bimbette sleaze.

Cheech reenacts his guitar playing rocker with the pink tutu. When you are old, you are old to remake any skit.  Folks, don't try this at home.

I doubt this San Antonio audience even had laughs.  I believe their enthusiasm was just be see Cheech and Chong in their hometown.  They did not seem to be bursting with laughter as some reviewers said.

Folks.... these guys need to hang it up.  YOU CANNOT RECREATE THE CLASSIC CHEECH AND CHONG......  Rizzo.",1283212800,5,1477,4.547528517110266

4080609,5,B00376AVIA,"I just wish that Dave was here so that he could watch these two guys together again, doing what they do BEST.  And that is, making us all laugh 'til we cry.  Hey man, what a trip. EXCELLENT!  That truly sums it all up in just one word.  EXCELLENT!  Five STARS all the way.  You just have to watch the totally hilarious skit in which the two guys dress up like an old married couple, and go to a sleezy theater to see a porn movie together. OMG! I honestly had to stop the DVD twice during that particular skit, just to catch my breath again. I was laughing so hard I couldn't even breath right. I honestly have NOT laughed that hard in years and years. It was so great to see the boys back together again, especially after so many years of being apart. Believe me everyone, if you are a TRUE (and I mean a TRUE) Cheech & Chong fan, then you'll not only order this DVD from NetFlix, you'll also order it through Amazon, so that you can own this DVD for yourself.  OMG, it was great!  Totally awesome. I must watch this one again tonight, before I have to return it.  Way to go, DUDES.  Way to go!",1276300800,7,1095,4.098591549295775
