7820604,4,6302062438,"The Girl With the Hatbox"" is a cute, charming silent comedy of Russian
girl who travels between her home in the country and an apartment owned
by a greedy, rich couple in Moscow.

She meets a poor student with nowhere to go, and ends up marrying him
to give him the right to stay in the apartment although the marriage
starts as just a platonic arrangement.

Lots of hi-jinx ensue, almost all well acted, and I found myself
enjoying it way more than I expected to.

Yes, there are some over the top performances, and a couple of unneeded
sub-plots, including our heroines cruel ignoring of the post man who is
in love with her, but overall this is a breezy, sweet comedy, well
worth watching.",1318896000,,692,4.476190476190476

But looking back on in this film before that period it shows an actress with talent. Actually the other actors in this film are good too. This movie is about a working girl Sten. She meets a poor student on the street and takes to him even giving him shelter in a room she doesn't use. But her employers who own the building aren't happy. One cheats her out of her earnings by giving her a lottery ticket which happens to win. Then chaos erupts as the poor student doesn't want her to think he's after her money and the creepy employer fakes love.
This is a comedy with several quirky moments, the kind of light hearted magic the silents produced.",1070582400,3,792,4.394557823129252
