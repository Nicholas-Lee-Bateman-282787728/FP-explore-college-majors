8195315,5,B000QACZR0,"The entire prequel is a true delight. There is a bit more lore and mysticism involved as well as a more serious and somber atmosphere than other Macross titles. The animation, picture, and sound quality are excellent. The subtitles have some of the worst translation of the bunch, but it's not too hard to decipher. 100% worth owning for any Macross fan.",1398038400,,354,4.725806451612903
8195316,3,B000QACZR0,"The anime was excellent, and I finally got to see the entire mini-series. However, the english subtitles were some of the worst I have ever seen. Character names changed, not just from episode to episode, but sometimes from scene to scene. The subs often mashed the lines of two characters together. Much of the story line was lost due to poor translation.

I know there is another version out there that has a clean translation. You can tell it by the white subs versus the yellow of this version. The one with the white subs is translated neatly and makes perfect sense.

I would recommend that the retailers with this version cease doing business with their supplier on this particular item, and discount any remaining stock to compensate the buyers for the poor translation.",1205366400,16,778,4.798507462686567
