3443619,4,B0019SYV0W,"Offbeat, nearly cult movie, that people like or don't (I happen to like it).  A very mixed group of adventurers, including Humphrey Bogart and his Italian wife (Gina Lollobrigida), a teddibly English couple, a dubious trader (Robert Morley) and a trio of international thieves (including the inimitable Peter Lorre) take a broken-down steamer from Italy to Africa in search of fortune.  The broken-down steamer does indeed break down, and all hell breaks loose.  The latter part of this movie seems to be a pastiche of Hollywood tropes and cliches by scenarist Truman Capote, but it's all fun in a louche kind of way.

3443646,2,B0019SYV0W,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Having grown up on those classic black and white films of the 30s and 40s as a child I was fascinated by Humphrey Bogart. Not a great looking lead actor but not horrid either, Bogart was the everyman of the day, a guy like everyone else but who always had an answer. He was a tough guy who could work his way out of any jam, as adept at being the hero as he was the villain. While I had the chance to see many of his films there were a few I never quite seemed to find for one reason or another. BEAT THE DEVIL was one of those films.

Made in 1953 BEAT THE DEVIL reteamed Bogart with director John Huston. The duo had performed well together with films like THE MALTESE FALCON, THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE and THE AFRICAN QUEEN so one would expect more success to follow. This wasn't the case as many critics were not fond of this film. After watching it I can understand why. The movie feels like a film out of time, made way before many of the plot elements would become acceptable to audiences.

Bogart plays Billy Dannreuther, a wheeler dealer stuck in a small Italian village with his wife Maria (Gina Lollobrigida) as well as several other passengers of a freighter en route to Africa. Billy is the driving force with connections to a local willing to assist in the purchase of a field full of uranium, a piece of land worth millions and held by an unknowing owner. Among the other characters stranded are Billys backers, Peterson (Robert Morley), Julius OHara (Peter Lorre), Ravello (Marco Tulli) and Major Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard), a motley crew at best. None of the partners trust each other let alone Billy.

Also on board the ship are an English couple on holiday also headed for Africa, Harry Chelm (Edward Underdown) and his wife Gwendolen (Jennifer Jones). Gwendolen is prone for flights of fancy, guessing who is who and what their stories are in an attempt to raise herself above the boring life she leads. She makes the mistake of going one step further when she finds herself drawn to Billy and falling in love. This is the first item that to me felt a bit off. Ive come to expect fast forward romances in films today but one made in 1953 seemed odd.

Back and forth situations of trust and deception follow as the various members of the party attempt to outdo one another in a rush to get to Africa and the lad deal. Billy tells them to stay calm and theyll get there just fine but since these are an untrustworthy group the odds of that happening are slim. Harry isn't aware of what is going on under his nose with Gwendolen and Billy and the same holds true for Maria who seems more concerned with how she plans to spend the money they will make as well as dreams of all things English.

So with all of this going on why doesnt the movie work? To begin with the film has a tremendously slow pacing to it, more like reading a book than watching a movie. The high points are rarely treated as such and it feels like a level film rather than one with ups and downs that move a plot forward. The film also suffers from poor cinematography and film stock being used to make the picture, looking like a washed out foreign film of the time rather than something Hollywood would have produced. Between the cast, the director and a writer of stature (the script was written by Truman Capote) the expectations are high but never met.

The end result is a film that drudges along and doesnt deliver until the final shot. Bogart was said to have been unhappy with the film, perhaps because he helped bankroll it and it lost money, saying Only phonies like it. Critics either loved it or hated it and the reception wasn't as huge as one would expect. The owners of the film let it fall into public domain stature which may show their lack of faith in it as well. This accounts for the number of copies of the film available.

On the plus side is the resurrection of the film for fans of the feature as well as all things Bogart. The Film Detective is a company that seems intent on presenting many features that have fallen into public domain in as best a condition as possible. To my knowledge this is the first time that the film has been offered in blu-ray format. The presentation is well made with a clean copy which is more than many companies who prey upon fans can claim when it comes to public domain titles. The Film Detective offers their products with minimal to non-existent extras (in this case a trailer) but movie fans are more concerned with the movie itself as opposed to umpteen extras. In this case the movie is the best presentation you are likely to find.

Fans of Bogart and Huston anxious to complete their libraries will want to pick this one up. If you love old classic films you might enjoy it. Perhaps its not their best effort but it is interesting and worth seeing at least once.",1471132800,,4875,4.389811738648948

3443670,4,B0019SYV0W,"This may be the quirkiest movie Bogart ever made; not the traditional tough guy, leading man role.  Rather, Bogie is an apparent business failure, having gone form riches to rags, and is leveraging his former business connections to broker a shady uranium deal in Africa with an even shadier group of equally quirky ""associates"", played marvelously by the likes of Peter Lorre and Robert Morley.  Gina Lollobrigida is eye candy even by today's standards, and Jennifer Jones was marvelously flirty.  If you go into this with eyes wide open, and don't expect a Bogie shoot-em-up, but rather sit back and let yourself be pulled in to the dysfunctional lives of a group of dysfunctional people in a dysfunctional situation, you will hopefully enjoy the ride as much as I did.",1461024000,,771,4.915384615384616

I went to see this movie every time I had a chance whether it was showing in Berkeley or somewhere on the peninsula. Occasionally it would be shown on one of the local TV stations. I even recorded the sound track once off of a television broadcast with a reel to reel tape recorder just so I could listen to the dialogue. It is that good. The story behind the writing of the script and how it was filmed is almost as good as what could only be described as a really great movie made with an exceptional cast.

3443693,5,B0019SYV0W,"An international thriller turned accidental comedy, Beat the Devil is an unlikely cult classic from acclaimed producer/director John Huston, with an impromptu screenplay from a young Truman Capote (and by impromptu we mean written on the spot, on location in Ravello, Italy). Starring the eras heartbreakers Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, Jennifer Jones and Gina Lollobrigida (looking bright and buxom in her first English speaking movie), the film is full of improbable lines and fabulously paced dialogue. Supporting the all star cast, character actors abound, lending a comedic edge that is pure genius though sadly undervalued in its time. Plot wise, the story loosely revolves around two couples and a quartet of crooks, who are all passing time in an Italian seaside town. One is given to believe that they are all waiting and individually scheming to covertly stake claims on a uranium find in British East Africa. Ancillary to the plot, conservative Hollywood censors had a heyday with the films thinly veiled use of adultery and immorality as a plot device, so playfully and unapologetically executed (thank you Mr. Capote). Which is perhaps the key to what makes Beat the Devil so charming, for somehow its irreverence for the mores of the day, comes across as both lighthearted and refreshingly modern.",1445990400,,1312,5.222748815165877

In fact, having seen several previous DVD releases of ""Beat the Devil"" from other companies, this is likely the best it has ever looked on optical media.  While this is clearly not a full on restoration of the film (specs and lines appear throughout), it is certainly an acceptable print.  There's a fine layer of film grain visible throughout most of the film.  Many of the blatant blown-out highlights (especially in the outdoor scenes) - visible in so many awful public domains prints of this film - have been toned down and are, at the least, bearable.  In several scenes there is even an almost film noir-ish quality to the lighting and the blacks, grey and whites look quite nice.  In other scenes (again most notably the outdoor scenes in full sunlight) the contrast is flatter and not as balanced as it should be.  Still, overall, for a release that may not see the light of day on blu-ray ever again, this is welcome edition to any Bogart fan's blu-ray collection.

Back when it was released in 1953 it went straight from box office flop to cult classic and it has even been called the first camp movie of all time! Yet to see this film on BluRay and digitally remastered, is an out of this world experience! The incomparable Humphrey Bogart stars as one of the five disreputable adventurers who are attempting to smuggle uranium out of East Africa. Bogarts counterparts include pompous fraud Robert Morley and Peter Lorre portrays the German-accented OHara whose wartime record is forever a source of much contemplation and endless speculation. As a climax to their many misadventures and double-crosses, the uranium seekers end up facing extermination by an Arab firing squad. In todays day and age when the money-hungry blockbusters seem to take hold of all audiences, it is sweet to remember a time when great script and magical wit were equally as entertaining.",1443657600,,960,4.932098765432099

This cannot possibly be a fresh modern scan from even a release print, let alone any kind of restoration from original elements or even inter positives. It appears to be upscaled. ""Beat The Devil"" is a very under appreciated film. The film was produced by a company controlled by Huston and Bogart.

In short, outside of Bogart, every major (and most minor) characters are idiots and / or lunatics!

Despite a stellar cast the direction of John Houston and the writing of Truman Capote the bumbling is not comic enough and the drama is not compelling enough. There are some very fine individual moments which spread out farther between as the movie drags on. Not a bad movie but what a lot of talent to achieve so little. Good for a family movie night or a film buffs date night but maybe not something you will see over and over.

><><><><><><><><><><><><

Because there is been some discussion of technical problems with certain versions of this DVD is identified as the Collector's Edition from Eco Bridge Home Entertainment. Sound quality was for me excellent. For a 1953 film I found the transfer slightly washed but I am willing to bet my viewing experience on this DVD was superior to what most people saw in the movie houses almost 65 years ago.

There are a number of lovely moments In Beat the Devil. Gina Lollobrigida walks into a room wearing an otherwise modest but on her teasing dress and announces ""tea for two""; earning the single biggest laugh in the movie. After that her character is mostly bland and could have been portrayed by any woman with an authentic Italian accent.

The mostly invisible Peter Lorre receives some clever jabs based on the fact that he plays an escaped Nazi with the assumed name of O'Hara while living in South America. He will give us a lovely comic turn while delivering a homily to Humphrey Bogart. O'Hara, an underling henchman has been sent to a advise the Bogart character that it is important for people to avoid appearing suspicious even as Lorre is acting very suspicious. His character then mostly disappears from the movie having little more to contribute.

Humphrey Bogart plays the most necessary man for the execution of the the crime but otherwise his character is a bland version of Humphrey Bogart as Rick in Casablanca.

Robert Morley nearly makes this his movie. While he mostly portrays Robert Morley; his ability to be an overbearing but hollow and ineffectual bully nearly has him dominating the screen as he dominates his criminal conspiracy without ever impressing Humphrey Bogart.

The pleasant surprise in this movie is Jennifer Jones. She sparkles and crackles and is very much the center of her every scene. It is given to her to leave out a trail of unnecessary and elaborate lies confusing and misdirecting virtually every other member of the cast. I'm tempted to say that her principal dialogue consists of alternate plot lines considered by Truman Capote and instead handed to her and brilliantly handled by her.

The plot line is as neat a McGuffin as Hitchcock could have desired. But for all of its complexities and individual bright moments there is too much dead time in this movie with almost all of it piling up to stretch out the end. What we now know as the, comedy drama or dramedy would not be developed for at least 25 or 35 years. In its more modern formula there is a better sense of timing and of the mix of gag lines and danger. In 1953 the formula did not yet exist and so this movie has originality but it lacks balance.",1433289600,,3276,4.665511265164644
3443731,5,B0019SYV0W,"First of all, would someone look into their crystal ball and please tell me what most of the dialogue in ""Beat the Devil"" is all about? While you are doing that, I want to commend Echo Bridge Entertainment for offering a pretty darn good copy of ""Beat the Devil,"" complete with the Columbia Pictures logo at the beginning of the picture.

This wacky John Huston, Humphrey Bogart, Truman Capote comedy/adventure fell into the public domain many years ago. Through the years, it has been available in many incredibly horrible forms, usually with washed out pictures and low, muffled sound.

That's why I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this very affordable DVD version of ""Beat the Devil"" is available from Echo Bridge Entertainment. The print is not TCM quality, but it is still very watchable with a sharp, clear picture and good sound.

""Beat the Devil"" has a huge cult following and rightly so. So while you are enjoying Echo Bridge's version of this truly bizarre and delightful Bogey film, I'll wait for someone to help me translate some of the dialogue into layman's language.

Intricately restored and digitally remastered to suspenseful effect, it is a crafty film about strong, fleshed-out characters trying to out-swindle one another for stakes in African real estate plentiful in uranium, and it's also pretty racy for its time! The sizzling screen presence of Jennifer Jones and Gina Lollobrigida as they demonstrate themselves as initiators of husband-swapping (for lack of a better term) between Bogart's Billy Dannreuther and Edward Underdown's Harry Chelm, adds an underlying taboo to much of the dialogue's innuendo. A fine example of this is when Lollobrigida's Maria Dannreuther is alone with stiff Brit Harry Chelm, frustratingly trying to coax the ""schemer"" out of him with, ""First you make love to me, now you tell me you will ruin me!"" ""Heh, you'll forgive me,"" retorts Harry,""but it was YOU who made-"" ""Oh, shut your trap!!"" snaps Maria; a true tug-of-war of sexual tension, indeed!  A worthy ""Who's Conning Who?"" tale, equipped with a Rogues' Gallery of in-depth personalities, BEAT THE DEVIL can easily sit high among fellow crime-noir films of the 1950's, such as KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL and TOUCH OF EVIL, albeit with an extra tinge of scandalous humor!",1429488000,,1371,5.2318181818181815

So, what's to like? For one, it's timely. In the south of post-WWII Italy, a bunch of people are planning to go by freighter to Africa. How just the opposite of today's headlines! They are all headed on an African adventure, but not for a grand safari like Hemingway, but to make their fortune while the rest of Europe and America muddles through the post war doldrums. So why are they taking a ship--a freighter--and not flying? Ah, well, they're not your run of the mill wealthy industrialists and mining executives.

This is a story that perfectly integrates character and plot, so if I tell you about the characters, you'll figure out the plot, and vice versa. But they're really fun people to get to know, even the ones you don't like. I've watched the film several times since purchasing it just to get to know these people better. I watched it most recently a couple of weeks ago.

It's a testimony to the screenplay (Truman Capote) and to the director (John Huston) that they have been able to take what might seem as simple dialog and fashion some wonderfully hilarious exchanges, with the characters all the while in deadpan. Did I say it's a sardonic comedy? No? Well, it is. And ""sardonic"" may be the best I can do to describe it. I'm laughing (quietly) as I write.

Bogart is fine, and the leading ladies, Lollobrigida and Jones, perfect complements and contrasts to each other. Robert Morley, Peter Lorre, and the other supporting cast all make this a memorable hour and a half.

Black and white is perfect for this film, where so little is.

Finally, I did a search of the film and saw the different covers that were/are available. Of them, this is my favorite. The only shortcoming is that Peter Lorre gets cover billing instead of Robert Morley, who plays a more substantive role, one which I don't think Lorre could have carried.

When it was first released, it was way over the heads of the hoi polloi.  Bogart put his own money into the film, and it was the last time he did that.  Capote wrote script pages each night and Huston would shoot them the next day.  It's one of the great satires, and as you may have heard, satire is what closes on Saturday night.  There are too many hilarious incidents to mention.  Robert Morley, Peter Lorre, the gorgeous Gina Lolobridgita (Sp?) are all wonderful.  Sad to say, many people are completely lacking a sense of humor.  I couldn't live without humor.  All the superb performers in this classic film are dead.

3443789,5,B0019SYV0W,"There is a lot of talk on the Internet about a 100 minute ""original release"" version. Those people must have seen a European pre-release, but not here. What today we would call a ""director's cut"" is 89 minutes, and contains an early 3 to 4 minute scene of dialog between the Chelms, interrupted by the now famous 4 crooks stomping by. It was a 'suggested' cut by the Production Code Office (even then in its dying days) for containing ethnic slurs. American distributors also thought the cut greatly improved matters since, with the added voice-over by Bogart, it immediately shifts the focus to Bogart right from the start. Producers agreed, (and Bogart was one of the producers!) and that then became the official release of the film.
  The cut explains Jennifer Jones/Mrs. Chelm's mystifying remark after the men pass by, since she had already mentioned them in the previous, missing conversation. True, the cut speeds the opening, does shift the focus immediately giving us an anchor, and (except for the bad edit) is for me an equally satisfying version. But If you want the original, you must get this Moving Pictures Archive/ Digicom DVD version of 2009 - without the Bogart voice-over, but with the missing opening scene.",1379116800,,1229,4.903846153846154

BEAT THE DEVIL is my least favorite Humphrey Bogart and/or John Huston film. Even with its impressive supporting cast this comedy doesn't amuse me, its romantic subplot lacks spark and a number of double-crosses aren't at all surprising. Just can't watch this one without ennui setting in after about 20 minutes.

The four con artists from different countries who collaborate on an African uranium mine venture, plus other characters trying to capitalize on their greedy land grab attempt, are all unappealing.

Huston and his cohorts in crime (Bogie, Lorre, et al) loved to take Hollywood's money and then go off to exotic locations to get drunk and have fun and make a movie that surprised the heck out of the studio.  In this case they went bonkers and didn't want to release it, but who knows why, because this truly is a forgotten gem in the Huston/Bogart canon.  If you doubt me then you should know that the only reason the highly respected and much loved 'African Queen' ever got made was because John Huston wanted to go to Africa and shoot an elephant..just read Katherine Hepburn's memoir of the making of the film (which is almost as entertaining as the film itself)!  Most of 'Beat The Devil' was improvised along the way and has that spontaneity that only comes with improvisation as it moves merrily along.  If you fail to see the twinkle in Bogart's eye from the beginning to the final scene, then you're going to be sorely vexed at what happens along the way.  If, on the other hand, you catch on, you'll relish the devilish black glee with which this group of actors and grifters raise champagne flutes in a toast to the audience who are in on the con even if the studio wasn't.

3443818,2,B0019SYV0W,"""Beat the Devil,"" a 1953 release, is a 173 minute action/adventure/comedy, with a very distinguished list of talent before and behind the camera.  It was produced by its principal star, Humphrey Bogart, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca/dp/B001EBWINQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Maltese-Falcon/dp/B001EC0OQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Maltese Falcon</a>).  He was, of course, the American actor and cultural icon; in 1997, Entertainment Weekly magazine named him the number one movie legend of all time. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked him as the greatest male star.  The picture was quite popular at the time of its release; it was considered a witty, dry-humored spoof of the caper films that were then in vogue.  But its popularity has slipped somewhat, and, oddly enough, according to the Internet, it was allowed to fall into the public domain.  And that, I guess, accounts for its many inferior quality DVD releases out there, with muddy picture and sound.  The version I saw comes with another film on a disk that can be bought amazingly cheaply at various places.  And, criminally enough, it comes without subtitles, for a film once noted for its witty script.

The six are headed for Africa, supposedly to sell vacuum cleaners but actually to buy land rumored to be loaded with uranium. They are joined in the port by another, British couple also waiting for the ship, the Chelms.  Gwendolen is a constantly irritating confirmed liar who also blurts out the truth at inconvenient moments.  She is played by the Oscar-winning Jennifer Jones, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Song-of-Bernadette/dp/B00008LDO7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Song of Bernadette</a>), who looks odd as a blond.  And Harry.  Later on, in Africa, Scotland Yard Inspector Jack Clayton, sent out to the Dark Continent to track down something else entirely, accidentally trips over the gangster foursome.  He's played by Bernard Lee (""M"" in the earlier James Bond movies), who apparently despaired of playing a steady diet of cops and the like.  Most of the film's other stars play out their accustomed stereotypes as well, with Lorre as a nervous little illegal alien type; Morley as the pompous, blustering Englishman, Lollobrigida as the gorgeous Italian (what a reach).  Though Bogart is surely too old, and wearing his pants too high, to be a sex symbol in this one.

For the life of me, I don't know why Bogart would have paid to do exteriors on location in Italy, and then filmed in black and white, but he did.  There are other oddities.  I don't quite get the way the two married couples flirted with each others' spouses: perhaps it was considered sophisticated back then.  The four gangsters sit down to play cards, and it sure sounds like a game of bridge: not what you would expect of them, with its steep learning curve, though perhaps they learned it while incarcerated.  At one point in the movie, Lollobrigida's character takes a fall and hits her head; she's obviously been injured, but the movie never acknowledges it.  Be that as it may, Bogart does get good support in the acting department.  But the film is very slow in getting started; in fact some viewers may think it never does.  And yes, there is a subtle black humor running through it, for those who can catch it--without subtitles, Lollo's dialog is almost incomprehensible.  What a waste, considering the comic brains that put the script together.

The film is based on the book of the same name by James Helyick: it is considered by many critics to follow the novel more closely than usual, and uses the original names of most of the characters.  According to the Internet, the first screenplay was written by one ""James Neville,"" a pseudonym for the late Claud Cockburn, who was blacklisted at the time.  (The Communist Claud Cockburn was the father of the recently-deceased humorous columnist Alexander Cockburn.)  At any rate, the ten times Oscar nominated John Huston, (THE MALTESE FALCON,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Treasure-of-the-Sierra-Madre/dp/B001EBWIUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Would-Be-King/dp/B004VFONHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Would Be King</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-African-Queen/dp/B003F3KKCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The African Queen</a>), legendary director of the film, apparently didn't care for Cockburn's take and tossed it.

3443823,3,B0019SYV0W,"When Humphrey Bogart was in his prime, say from the time of  Petrified Forest in the late 1930s until say 1947's Dark Passage, he was hands down king of film noir hill. No question. There were prettier faces (Clark Gable), there were better actors (Spenser Tracey), there were actors with more angst per ounce (Montgomery Cliff) but for sheer gritty, grizzled, gnarly (nice, huh) film presence Bogie was the one. Of course even those who have not kept up with their history know that every king (or queen) has his (or her) day. And then-done. Well, not exactly done but since actors, like some generals, only fade away and hang on for just as long as studios think they have ""start"" quality to put in the bank. In the film under review, Beat The Devil, our man Bogie is in such a quandary. Clearly, on the screen, it is almost painful to see his physical decline (only slightly hidden by ""make-up magic"") if not his ability to throw off a few off-hand devil take the hinter-post lines in this one.

Fortunately this film, directed skillfully to enhance the black and white features, by John Huston, is not desperately in need of ""high"" Bogie to carry it along. The story line, about a motley crew of ""desperados"" seeking fame and fortune in post-World War Africa is fairly straight forward and mundane. Unfortunately, for them, they are stuck in an out-of the-way port in Italy. The keys to the kingdom that this crew is trying to corner in the heated up Cold War world- uranium (or some other equally precious commodity, if thinks turn out badly). If in earlier times gold or diamonds stirred men's (and women's) greedy thoughts just then in that red scare night it was that particularly important produce.  However not for one moment can any of the parties (and those like Ms. Jones and her down-at-the-heels British husband who wonder what this crew is doing out in the sticks) take one eye much less two off the others. And that, more than the thin plot line, is what carries the day here. The collective day, with likes of Robert Benchley, Peter Lorre and Ms. Jones, playing off against Bogie's world-wary, world-weary performance. Add into the mix a little off-hand infidelity for the good of the cause and that makes a very interesting mix. If you need classic ""high"" Bogie then go to Casablanca, To Have or Have Not or The Big Sleep.

3443827,5,B0019SYV0W,"This is possibly the most unusual film starring the most lengendary names in Hollywood. Beat The Devil stars Humphrey Bogart as a shady business man dealing with equally shady people who hope to purchase a piece of property in Africa filled with uranium. To try and pin down a genre for this film would be a very trying issue. It's humor is so off beat and subtle, not many would consider it a comedy. Sometimes in treads in the territory of thriller but the thrills are not that suspenseful. I think the film simply relies on the strength of it's actors and that's why it shines. Humphrey Bogart, as usual, a charasmatic presence and a man about town with a dry sense of humor.  Robert Morley is pretty much the epitome of the comical, english snob but is remarkably dignified when he needs to be. The rest of Morley's crew range from a philosophical Peter Lorre to a facist and hot headed facist ex British Major. This isn't an all male affair with Gina Lollobrigida providing the sex appeal and Jennifer Jones as the personification of this very off beat film; Her imagination adds much to the film and pays off for the surprise ending. All these personalities clash wonderfully and you forget that there actually is a plot. I think the best way I can summarize Beat The Devil is several strangers on vacation but they all tie together. Yeah, this isn't a great review but really, who could be very clever at analyzing this film ?",1303084800,,1433,4.554263565891473
3443828,2,B0019SYV0W,"""Beat the Devil"" is a tongue in cheek spoof of Bogart's famous films of the 40s, like ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Casablanca"". It comes in 1953 near the end of Bogart's career. Although he still had a few good films left ahead (e.g., ""The Caine Mutiny""), generally speaking his best years were behind him, and his performance in this film ranks among his lesser roles, exacerbated by the fact that he had been in a major auto accident during production (there is one scene near the end of the film when his injuries were not adequately covered up by the makeup).

Bogart made 80 films, was nominated 3 times for an Oscar and won for ""The African Queen"" (1952), and is considered the greatest male actor of the 20th Century by many. His list of outstanding performances is too long to list. Director John Huston said of him - ""He was endowed with the greatest gift a man can have -- talent.""

Bogart has his long time friend Peter Lorre (1904-64) along for the ride. They did 5 films together, beginning with ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941). In addition to his work with Bogart, Lorre is most famous for his terrifying role in ""M"" (1931) and his ""Mr. Moto"" films. Director John Huston said of him -"" Peter Lorre was one of the finest and most subtle actors I have ever worked with. Beneath that air of innocence he used to such effect, one sensed a Faustian worldliness.""

Lorre is joined by fat and jolly Robert Morley (1908-1992) instead of his usual partner in crime, fat and jolly Sydney Greenstreet who retired in 1949 for health reasons, and died in 1954. Morley was a wonderful actor, a lovable pompous windbag who graced film and stage. He was nominated for an Oscar for his film debut in ""Marie Antoinette"" (1938) playing a shy Louis XVI, and was nominated for a Golden Globe for ""Who's Killing the Great Chefs of Europe"" (1978), but personally I thought his best performance was as the missionary in ""The African Queen"" (1951) with Bogart. Incredibly, this film was the only pairing of Morley and Lorre.

The two female stars are Jennifer Jones and Gina Lollobrigida. Jones (1919-2009) was a terrific actress and was nominated 5 times for an Oscar, winning for ""A Song of Bernadette"" (1943). Her best work was in the 40s (""Since You Went Away"", ""Duel in the Sun"", ""Portrait of Jennie"") but she continued to work and was nominated for a Golden Globe for her final film, ""The Towering Inferno"" in 1974. Jones is a riot as the wife of a pretentious Englishman, and she steals every scene in which she appears.

Gina Lollobrigida (1927) is simply beautiful. One can hardly get past her beauty and enjoy her good acting in this film, which was her breakout role. She gave good performances in films like ""Trapeze"" (1956) and ""Never so Few"" (1959) before her film career went into decline.

Look for Bernard Lee (1908-81) in a brief appearance as an inspector from Scotland Yard. Lee would later gain fame playing ""M"" in the early James Bond films.

Director John Huston (1906-87) apparently conceived of the idea for this film as a spoof of his previous films like ""The Maltese Falcon"". Huston was one of our best directors, nominated 5 times for an Oscar for directing, winning once for ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948) that starred Bogart and Huston's father, Walter Huston (who won his only Oscar as Best Supporting Actor). Huston was also nominated 8 times for an Oscar for writing, and once for acting.  This was his last of 6 films with Bogart.

Huston co-wrote this film (as he did with many of his films) with Truman Capote (1924-84). Capote was best known as a writer of novels (""Breakfast at Tiffanys"", ""In Cold Blood""). ""Beat the Devil"" was his first of two screenplays he wrote, and he got the job because of his work with Jones' husband, David O Selznick, on ""Indiscretion of an American Wife"" (1953).

Despite the quality of the actors and the director and writer, this is an unsatisfying film. It lacks a solid base. Clearly it isn't meant to be taken at face value (a thriller), but nor is it very funny (like ""We're No Angels"") or even sly (like ""The Lavender Hill Mob""). The original novel was a thriller and it was Huston's desire to turn it into a comedy, but it ends up being neither. Bogart himself disliked the film, said ""only phonies like it"", and his production company (Santana Productions) failed to renew the copyright. The NY Times said -  ""A potential treat emerged as a wet firecracker"" and ""For all the studiedly suave professionalism, though, Beat the Devil ends up beating itself.""

There are some good things about this film. Jennifer Jones is terrific. Supporting performances by Ivor Bernard (the homicidal Major) and Mario Perrone (ship's purser) are brilliant, and there is the occasional plot point that will get a rise. But all things considered this is a monumental waste of talent that could have created a much better work.

Some reviewers will claim that it is a great film, a camp film, a cult film, etc. Perhaps. I'm sure the film will appeal to a small group of people, but generally speaking, if it failed at the box office, failed at the Oscars, and was trash talked by the people who were involved in it, chances are most people aren't going to enjoy it. Fans of the actors have so many better films they can choose from, why would you waste your time on this failed attempt?",1302998400,,5330,4.633474576271187

3443832,3,B0019SYV0W,"Is what Bogart supposedly said about this movie.  I've been thinking about that for a few days after watching the movie and think I understand what he means.

I suppose that could be done right, but the part that really bothered me was the African interlude where the bunch of ill-assorted crooks land on the shore of an African country where the main bad guy Peterson (Robert Morley) sold the natives some rotten guns.  The ruler, Ahmed, displays all the stereotypes attributed to Third World rulers: he's bloodthirsty (firing squads in the distance), effeminate (he sure seems to like Bogart a lot later on) and fatally attracted to white women (Rita Hayworth in particular).  Of course it's played for laughs, but I'm capable of deciding when to laugh. There's a sense here of trying to have it both ways - to expose imperialism and to use the old racist stereotypes for a laugh as well.

These two pictures scripted by Truman Capote couldn't be more unalike.

Certain aspects of Vittorio de Sica's INDISCRETION OF AN AMERICAN WIFE, screaming soundtrack violins in particular, can be annoying. I tried to stay detached from this story of a Roman love affair doomed to end, but got swept up in Monty Clift's performance and his interactions with Jennifer Jones. Those last 20 minutes or so really killed me. If you've ever loved and lost then watched your sweetheart go away forever at a train station or airport, this top shelf melodrama will reopen an old wound that it will simply rip your heart out through.

BEAT THE DEVIL is my least favorite Humphrey Bogart and/or John Huston film. Even with its impressive supporting cast this comedy doesn't amuse me, its romantic subplot lacks spark and a number of double-crosses aren't at all surprising. Just can't watch this one without ennui setting in after about 20 minutes. The four con artists from different countries who collaborate on an African uranium mine venture, plus other characters trying to capitalize on their greedy land grab attempt, are all unappealing.

3443854,4,B0019SYV0W,"You'd think that ""Beat the Devil"" would be far better known than it is, since it was one of the last movies that Humphrey Bogart did before his untimely death.

Maybe it's because Bacall wasn't in it, or maybe it was just too quirky for the masses. But taken for its own merits, this movie is a delicious little gem -- a funny, wry noir-satire, with a gang of rather inept criminals. Bogart does a fair amount of scenery-chewing, but a number of big stars of the time -- including Peter Lorre, Jennifer Jones and Gina Lollabrigida -- get plenty of good time.

Billy Dannreuther (Bogart) is part of a motley group planning to go to Africa, where a friend can help them illegally claim uranium, enabling them to become insanely rich forever. But trouble arrives: stuffy Harry Chelm (Edward Underdown) and his very imaginative, compulsively-lying wife Gwen (Jennifer Jones) arrive, and soon they're flirting with Billy and his sensual wife Maria (Gina Lollabrigida).

Even worse, Gwen's ""exaggeration"" habit is making the gang distrust Billy, thinking that he's withholding information from them and cheating them out of a fair share. He isn't, of course. But all the personal plots and distrust come to a boil when everyone boards the ship, and Harry reveals that he knows everything about their uranium plot. Now Billy has to save himself and his friends, without Harry being bumped off...

""Beat the Devil"" is an all-around satire -- it mocks grabby criminals, pathological liars, stodgy Brits, romance movies, crime capers, noir films, and even second-rate boats in less advanced corners of the world (""Of course, the captain is drunk!""). In fact, there's very little about this movie that doesn't poke fun at itself, or at the movies of the time.

And since it was adapted by John Huston and Truman Capote, you know that it's being witty as it makes fun. It languidly builds up in a sunny, dusty, ruined city where people plot and flirt, and then starts to boil when they get on board the crummy little boat. But even engine failures manage to be entertaining when Harry wrecks the oil pump while trying to fix it, and preening about his English know-how.

The cast is skilled in that under-the-radar way, where nobody hogs the spotlight. Humphrey Bogart plays a slightly more offbeat version of his noir characters. He's a lot smarter than anyone would immediately suspect, a lot nicer than you'd think, and he handles most of the awkward situations with mildly tolerant grace.

Other well-known actors of the time make deliciously offbeat appearances -- Jones is hilarious as the ditzy, chattery English girl, Lollabrigida is suitably slinky and grasping, and Peter Lorre plays an uncharacteristically hapless conman. Robert Morley are also quite good as Bogie's bombastic pal, and Underdown plays the insensitive, straight-arrow dunce perfectly. You'll constantly want to smack him.

Though not as respected as it deserves, ""Beat the Devil"" is a little gem of a Bogart movie, with witty, satirical writing, deliciously offbeat acting and lots of wild twists. Definitely a keeper.",1213142400,,3084,4.9980506822612085

If you don't find it on Amazon, you may have to search the Web for this edition.

1953 critics and audiences alike, anticipating a serious drama, missed the point of this noir-satire that delightfully lampooned the genre.  While bombing at the box office, it eventually became a cult classic when audiences realized they were supposed to have as much fun viewing it as the actors had in making it.  Knowing about the stormy frustrations and dysfunctions that went on behind-the-scenes makes viewing even more enjoyable.

The principle stars seem to delight in portraying the on-screen personas and stereotypes for which they were already famous.  Tough guy Humphrey Bogart spits out wisecracks with the nonchalance we have come to expect.  Gina Lollobrigida brings her predictable fiery Latin-tempered performance to the screen, along with her paparazzi-hounded cleavage.  Despite his bizarre bleach-blond buzz cut, Peter Lorre remains true to the character spoofed by so many impersonators on the Ed Sullivan Show.  Instead of ""Did you get the information?"" his most memorable line for this outing becomes, ""Time is a thief.""  The portly Robert Morely fits comfortably into his role as the foppish English con man.  The lovely Jennifer Jones, however, stepped outside of her better-known characterizations to display her rarely seen comedic talent as an intelligent but seemingly ditsy neurotic with an overactive imagination.

They are to travel by ship and, on the same ship, is a young English couple.

Technically speaking this version looks as good as any old movie. The DVD is digitally remastered and features a digital 5.1 surround soundtrack, Dolby digital sound, scene access and interactive menus. I don't have the gear to evaluate the 5.1 or Dolby, but the sound is fine on my tv speakers.

It's not a big Hollywood film, but a small independent (Bogart's own production company) that happens to have an amazing cast, is directed by one of the best (John Huston), with a Truman Capote screenplay. It's become one of my favorite off-beat films and can't recommend it enough.

What's not to like? Quite a bit if you read some of the disgruntled reviews below! But don't be dissuaded, it's a gem. And remember, Pauline Kael was a huge fan of this movie; if she's a reviewer you trust, that might be enough for you.

Other reviewers have outlined the plot so I won't go into that, and in any case, that's not the reason to watch this movie. The plot's certainly as good as any amusing Hitchcock film, with its MacGuffin and several surprising twists and comic suspense subplots unraveling throughout.

There are subtleties to Beat the Devil that apparently escape many reviewers, who perhaps wanted another formulaic 'noir' classic or some kind of slapstick laff-fest. If you like New Yorker cartoons, you'll likely enjoy this movie as much as I do: I've watched this movie at least 5 times and still love it.

Beat the Devil escapes categorization, except to say that it's a brilliant comic screenplay performed with skill and insight by several of the best actors of the 50s. Robert Morley is sublimely funny, and brings out the best in Peter Lorre and the other criminals in the gang.

Jennifer Jones is sexy and charming in her role as a compulsive liar, as is her classic and earnestly doltish husband. They reek naive British charm and are marvelous together, providing a poignant tension in contrast to the gang of conniving scoundrels.

Bogart himself has one foot in each boat, and much of the film revolves around the conflict he suffers in this double life, playing each off the other. As in most Bogie flicks, he's hilariously dry and sly, with lollapalooza actress Gina Lollobrigida playing his scheming wife. Everyone's on the make except Harry Chelm, Jennifer Jones' character's husband.

There isn't the passion of a Bogie/Bacall film, and it's not the classic noir we all love with Bogart, so don't be disappointed.

One word of warning: Beat the Devil slipped into the public domain, so the DVDs on the market are of varying quality. The one I have is ok, but only just... it's like watching an old movie, with herky jerky pops and cuts and some noise. It doesn't bother me that much though, and emphasizes the 'rare find' quality if you're feeling charitable. If you're a digital maniac, you'll be better served watching something Criterion's had its way with.

Beat the Devil is one of the most unusual 50s movies I can think of, and I don't normally watch any movie as often as I've watched this one. With the possible exception of other Bogart classics.",1098144000,,2826,4.751020408163265
3443871,2,B0019SYV0W,"What happened in this film? I couldn't tell you. One of the major downfalls of this film was the lack of quality that was used to transfer this film to DVD.  I felt at times that I was watching a very old VHS version of this film. There is even a moment where you get squiggle lines at the top of the screen as if you are watching this film on a rackety VHS player.  The fade in's and fade out's were horribly miscalculated.  I am always a believer that you should let your character finish his/her line or action before you go to a fade, that way you don't have audience members straining to hear or to catch a final glimpse of what is happening.

I am trying really hard to watch some of these older films.  They are the backbone to modern cinema ... but can't they be any better.  I am still waiting for me to discover that gem.  I think that is my mission now.  I want to see an older film that is virtually unheard of, but is movie making at its best.

So, what was wrong with Beat the Devil you may ask?  The fades were one aspect I had trouble getting over.  Another was what the director was trying to do with Bogart.  Trying to enjoy the spoof that the director, John Houston, was planting in the film was hard.  What Houston was trying to do was spoof all of Bogart's prior films.  This movie was like all of Bogart's films meshed together so to speak.  While you don't normally see this in many movies (the only one that comes to mind is True Lies with Arnie), in this film it was done so badly that the humor was lost to confusion.  This was one of those films that you have to watch, and your initial reaction is going to be the true feeling that you have for this film.  I thought about re-watching this film to see if it got any better for me, but as I thought about it, I had to pass.

My initial reaction was not good, and I had this feeling deep in me that it wasn't going to get much better with a second viewing.  Maybe I was expecting better, I mean Truman Capote wrote the film ... that should mean something ... right?

Finally, and perhaps I just need to see more of them, but I have trouble watching a satire without any jokes. Growing up in the era of Mel Brooks, I wanted scenes and words that I would just fall over with laughter about.  This film carried none of this.  There was only one scene that made me smile a bit (and perhaps it was because my throat was dry), and that was when Bogart's buggy went down the cliff and into the ocean. The only reason for me laughing at that was because it reminded me of Hawaii and our trip up a huge mountain!! Blach! Watch out for this one ... it's a doozie!!

They even end up with a taxi jumping into the ocean, an attempted murder by overboard throwing in the middle of some ocean night, a shipwreck that brings all that nice group of adventurers to some Morocco where they are forced to bribe the locals to get through, and that is not as easy as one may think.

3443874,5,B0019SYV0W,"BEAT THE DEVIL is a very funny movie which retains its subtle charm even after many viewings, It reminds me of the MALTESE FALCON not only because of the similarity of some of the characters but also because of the likeness of the screenplays. Both films essentially focus on a treasure hunt with an array of buffoons vying for the prize. Humphrey Bogart's characters seem to be about the only really normal people in either movie. While it is definitely considered to be a comedy, BEAT THE DEVIL is also not a bad adventure story. Most of the subdued action takes place on shore while the assorted crooks and cutthroats are waiting for a leaky old ship to take them to Africa.
The cast includes Humphrey Bogart, Robert Morley, Jennifer Jones, Gina Lollobrigida, Peter Lorre, Ivor Barnard and Edward Underwood.
John Huston was the director and Truman Capote contributed heavily to the screenwriting after the filming began in Italy. Truly a ton of Hollywood talent was assembled for this one movie in a relatively charming location.
It is no wonder that the movie is standing the test of time and is now enjoying a revival of sorts with even a minor cult following.",1053648000,,1165,4.74384236453202
3443875,3,B0019SYV0W,"This glorious spoof of the film noir genre of the 1940's, has direction by John Huston, an ever evolving script by Truman Capote and stars:Humphrey Bogart - HB (Billy Danreuther), Jennifer Jones - JJ (Gwendolynne Chelm), Gina Lollobrigida - GL (Maria), Edward Underdown - EU (Harry Chelm), Robert Morley - RM (Pierson), Peter Lorre - PL (O'Hara) and other notable character actors.
Basically a group of rogues are vieing with each other to be the first to obtain a rich uranium deposit somewhere in ""British East Africa"" but we are never told where precisely. It was filmed on location in Italy and features the only other comic role of JJ, (her first being ""Cluny Brown (1946)) as a congenital liar, whose Spanish Nurse taught her all there is to know!.What a pity Selznick did not recognise the comic potential of his wife and instead of putting her in soulful dirges like ""Indiscretion of an American Wife""(1952), he had developed her natural comic potential.""Beat The Devil"" did not perform at the box office in 1953/4 when released but is now, thankfully, being re-evaluated by discerning film connoiseurs, achieving almost a cult like status.
Being a strong amateur chess player, I particularly liked the scene outside the Italian cafe where JJ is ""duffing up"" EU again with an almost instant sight of the board, while chatting up HB.(Note to chess geeks - JJ plays much more weakly in ""A Farewell to Arms (1957) vs Rock Hudson!!).Incidentally HB liked to play chess himself when off camera.
The plot twists & turns and being English with a bawdy sense of humour, I laughed when GL says to EU ""I've brought you some tea & crumpet"" while almost smothering EU in the eye with her... well you get the point! It is reported John Huston rather sadistically requested JJ to climb to the rocking crow's nest- a fearsome climb - to do her leg stretching exercises on the ship taking them to Africa. The gang, led by RM, hope she breaks a leg - & not in the theatrical sense! My favourite scene is in the office of the African potentate who is questioning the motley group of rogues. In reality all he wants to know is whether HB has met Rita Hayworth as he is a big fan!.If you look carefully you can see her pin-up on his office wall. The quivering of RM's various chins when he is threatened with torture, is a delight to behold.
The trick of Nazis having escaped to Latin America after WWII, is lampooned by PL who insists everyone calls him ""O'Hara"" (our little Irish leprecaun!).Everyone seems to be having a ball. Look out for Bernard Lee playing his usual police inspector role. This was long before he shot to fame as ""M"" in the Sean Connery, James Bond series from 1962 onwards. I've noticed in memorable films there is usually a catchy tune somewhere and here is no exception as played by an Italian brass band. I even find myself whistling the pianola music played on the ship while Ivor Barnard is away with his stabbing swagger stick ready to bump off EU.I voted 3/5 stars for this film.",1048204800,,2998,4.637218045112782

And it's not only the quality that is lacking, its the content. All you get is the US recut of Huston's film (1954, 89', not 1953, 100'). It really changes the character of the movie. To the bad.
Check: Scene 1 should not be the flashback of the four crooks being marched off to the band - there is no reason to tell the plot as a flashback anyway. Spoils the whole layout. Scene 1 should be the following (censored in the US by the 50s - 50s, still sold today!!! - Censorship Board):

A man they pass turns round to stare at them  unpleasently. They turn round (towards each other).
2 Portrait shot of six small boys looking very ugly, glaring at them. Mouth movements as if  they were about to spit.

JJ: Here, it's unlucky to have someone spit at you unless you spit first.
EU: What a filthy superstition,
JJ: (chants:) May yours be defiled!
EU: What's that about?
JJ: These people may be thinking of putting a curse on us, like may your grandmothers be  defiled"". That's why I say it first, just in case.
EU: Wherefrom do you get all this stuff?
JJ: My old Spanish nurse told me.
EU: Surely you don't believe it now. You were only a child then.
JJ: She wasn't a child. She was old.
EU: I only wonder why your parents left you in charge of such a dirty, ignorant woman.
JJ: They cared for nothing except to have me off their hands. I told you that. They'd have sold  me on the slave market if they hadn't been afraid of the scandal. Besides my father was  incompetent. I suppose he just didn't know how to contact the slave people.
EU: I don't believe a word of it. Probably they were very fond of you, really.
JJ: (making as if to spit again)
EU: Stop it, Gwendolen! Don't do it!
JJ: You'll be sorry if you run into bad luck just because you didn't take proper precautions.  Suppose when we get to Africa there is a native raising and they are slaughtering all the  Whites! (prepares to spit again)
EU: Gwendolen!
JJ: If you don't let me spit I'll just feel like standing here in the street and screeming with terror!

3443878,3,B0019SYV0W,"This is a quirky kind of movie with an excellent cast who are not necessarily at their best, with a screenplay by a famed novelist, Truman Capote, directed by a Hollywood legend, John Huston, also perhaps not at their best.  Adapted from the novel by James Helvick, Beat the Devil is morphed into something of a self-conscious comedic spoof by Huston of his classic The Maltese Falcon (1941).  Here we have Robert Morley instead of Sidney Greenstreet as the greedy ring leader, and Ivor Barnard as the bodyguard with a knife instead of Elisha Cook Jr. the bodyguard with a gun.  There is no Mary Astor, but Gina Lollibrigida, an Italian brunette bombshell, and a blonde Jennifer Jones appear as the female leads.  Humphrey Bogart again is the star.  Peter Lorre returns as a German named O'Hara (part of a running joke about Argentina where so many ex-Nazis became ""Irish"" settlers after World War II).  But Bogey is now 55-years-old, ""a middle-aged roustabout""--to quote (twice) from the script, apparently a good-natured Capote dig at the legendary actor--whose tar-stained teeth do so detract from his leading man role.  (Gina, his on-screen wife, was 26.)  And Peter Lorre has gone from a bug-eyed skinny little perfumed dandy to a fully rounded, tired, middle aged man. Alas, how cruel the camera!
Nonetheless, this is interesting and diverting, full of double entendres and clever put-downs of all sorts, including jabs at marriage, English puffery and neo-Nazis.  I understand the movie has overcome the disappointment of its original audience and has become something of a cult classic.  I think those fifties matinee viewers probably missed most of the comedy and were offended by the easy adultery of the principals and the improper use of Humphrey Bogart.  A year later he was wonderfully cast as Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny, where he gave one of his greatest performances.
This is the kind of movie that Old Hollywood likes to watch nostalgically while satirically dissecting the performances, the script, etc., while nonetheless finding nuggets of humor, both intentional and inadvertent.  It is, for example, possible to find some hidden meaning in the fact that the rogues, once aboard ship, break out into a lusty rendition of the anonymous chantey, ""Blow the Man Down.""  And it is possible to observe that during the scene in which Jennifer Jones easily beats her husband at chess with her back mostly to the board (afterwards she quips, ""Harry's been all out of sorts today.  Usually he is a wonderful loser.""), that what Bogart really wanted to do was get the scene over with and get back to his cigarettes and the chess games he so loved to play on location.  One might also observe that had Peter Lorre been a little younger, and had they made a life of Truman Capote, the former could have played the latter with consummate ease.
Speaking of location, this was filmed in Italy in black and white, clearly on a budget, and as such might be seen as a spaghetti comedy.",1015372800,,2994,4.877712031558185
3443879,4,B0019SYV0W,"Humphrey Bogart heads a superior cast in this tale of a gang of swindlers who seek to covertly purchase African lands rich in uranium--but this is not the tough film noir you might expect: the script by director John Huston and Truman Capote upends the tale to create one of the most wry and wicked comedies going, and a remarkably fine cast follows suit with a host of eccentric performances.
Although Bogart does not look his best (this film was made toward the end of his life), he offers an understated yet very witty performance as Billy Dannreuther, the man the crooks hire to make the land purchase.  His leading ladies, bombshell Gina Lollobrigida and an unexpectedly blonde Jennifer Jones, are equally effective in the roles of Bogart's cheerfully pragmatic wife and the pathological liar with whom Bogart becomes romantically entangled.  But the big news in this film is the supporting cast. Robert Morley, Peter Lorre, Ivor Barnard, and Marco Tulli give drop-dead-funny performances as the largely incompetent foursome behind the landsnatch scheme; Edward Underdown (as Jones' long suffering husband) is simply the most completely ludicrous Brit to hit the screen since 1930s screwball comedy; and all the cameo players nail their roles to perfection.
It would be unforgivable to give away too much of the story, but suffice to say that one wrong turn leads to another.  But the film never overplays its hand, maintaining a low key tone that sets off the wickedly funny script to delightful effect.  Some viewers may not get the joke--much of BEAT THE DEVIL requires the ability to appreciate covert humor--but those who do will find the movie bears repeat viewing.

Beat the Devil is a very droll, dark comedy about a gaggle of unsavory characters planning a Uranium swindle in Africa. The only problem is, they're all double-crossing each at other every turn. In a way, Beat The Devil is a comic bookend to The Maltese Falcon. But here the entire story is about how this devious gang of double-dealing dunderheads are constantly stabbing each other in the back.

BTD isn't your typical Hollywood caper flick, and is all the better for it. Unlike most Hollywood movies, the BTD is entirely character-driven, not plot-driven. Plus, it was shot on location in Italy, giving it the look of a European film. When it was released, however, American audiences weren't ready for the foreign feel of the film, and many Americans still don't get its wry, wicked wit. But for those who do, it is a rare treat..

The cast is wonderfully quirky, offbeat & idiosyncratic. Bogart & Peter Lorre are back together, along with the incomparable Robert Morley, Jennifer Jones, Gina Lollobrigida, Peter Sellers & a bunch of great character actors that give this motley crew of disreputable misfits its wonderfully dry, tawdry humor.

His years of acting in movies result in a flawless, witty performance (even though he was succumbing to cancer at this point).  Jennifer Jones sets the tone of the piece throughout in what one imagines is a send-up of Marilyn Monroe as the catalyst for all the confusion amongst the motley crew of ""criminal masterminds."" When her flighty character encounters Robert Morley, Peter Lorre and Bogart's other co-conspirators at the beginning of the movie, she finds them suspicious because ""none of them looked at my legs!"" There are plenty of other clues to the skewed logic of the film in the screenplay by Truman Capote and Huston. Who among us has not met people like these? People so caught up in their ""clever"" schemes that they fail to realize how ridiculous they are. Only Bogart and screen wife Gina Lollobbrigida have a clue to how little thinking has gone into the get-rich-quick quest to acquire uranium m Africa. Morley is a hoot as the devious ringleader (a part that would have gone to Sydney Greenstreet in earlier years). There are mistakes, such as one scene in which bleached blonde Lorre is seen with brown hair, and. some flubbed lines here and there, but these bits don't affect the movie's sense of fun.
