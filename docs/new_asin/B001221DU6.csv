3071402,1,B001221DU6,"Disrespectful remake of Anthony Shaffer's play and the 1972 film version abandons all of the original's dialogue in an adaptation by Harold Pinter that reduces the original material to its essential plot elements, abandoning all of the sense of fun and playfulness of the original.  The problem is that the interesting thing about Sleuth was never the plot any more than the interesting thing about a Shakespeare play is the plot.  The joy of Sleuth was that the fancy dialogue allowed the two lead actors to go to town with broadly enjoyable performances.  Were Lawrence Olivier and Michael Caine ever more pure fun than in the 1972 filmed version of Sleuth?

This version features minimal set design (to contrast with the house in the original which was overstuffed with furniture, games, toys and little traps) and more direct dialogue.  This version of Sleuth actually feels like a repudiation of everything that made the original entertaining in the first place.  Harold Pinter may regard Anthony Shafer as a minor playwright but that doesn't give him the right to crap all over the other man's work.

It's not really a mystery why this version of Sleuth wasn't a hit with critics or audiences.  It's joyless, empty, pointless and has all the humor of an intellectual scold telling you endlessly how much smarter he is than you.  Harold Pinter clearly has no idea what made the original so entertaining.  To be fair to Anthony Shafer, who isn't all that highly regarded now, he also wrote the screenplays for Alfred Hitchcock's only great late period film (Frenzy) and for one of the most genuinely creepy horror films of all time (The Wicker Man).  Harold Pinter may be a critical darling, but try to find anything half as entertaining in his long list of credits for the stage and screen.  Sleuth might have worked if director Kenneth Branaugh had used the original play but it represents a very bad fit between material and writer where Harold Pinter is concerned.

Those familiar with the 1972 film of Sleuth will notice that this version closely follows the original in letter if not spirit for the first two thirds.  It's in the third act where Harold Pinter tries to make the material his own by turning Sleuth into a psychodrama with strong undertones of homophobia.  Not coincidentally, that's also about where this version of Sleuth turns from being merely mediocre to going completely off the rails.  The new ending like the rest of the film is blunt but ineffective.

Michael Caine and Jude Law do what they can, but the only way someone would likely enjoy this film is if they had no exposure to the 1972 original.",1473724800,,2632,4.8133333333333335
3071403,1,B001221DU6,"Pointless remake, with an uncharacteristically flat performance by Caine, who was fantastic in the original 1972 classic alongside the master, Laurence Olivier. In this updated version, gone is the wickedly delicious joy of the original as Caine slogs his way through the Olivier role of the aging writer and Jude Law hams it up Caine's old role of the young upstart. Even more egregious, Harold Pinter takes a chainsaw to Anthony Shaffer's brilliant script, while Kenneth Branagh looks on from the director's chair with garish glee. Patrick's Doyle's chillingly effect yet somewhat repetitive score is the only highlight.

3071405,5,B001221DU6,"Kenneth Branagh said that in Law and Caine, he was working with two Rolls Royces. And it's true. Caine is always good and he has the subtler role here. But Jude delivers an astonishing performance. He is chilling, breathtaking, beautiful, seductive, and dissembling.  Forget the  tabloid stories, pretty boy looks and rom-coms like ""Holiday"". This is a great actor. There is one scene towards the end where Law is viciously seductive, playing Caine's character, teasing him along with the promise of homoerotic play, and with his badly dyed blond hair and dazzling beauty, it was like watching a malignant Marilyn Monroe. Earlier in the film, he does a turn as another character, and he is unrecognizable. He's just brilliant. BUT--and it's a big BUT--this is not really a movie. It's a two-person play and it has that stagey, slow-moving theatrical feel to it. If you watch it as a play, and imagine yourself in a theater watching two acting giants go at it, you'll be enthralled. If intellectual and dialogue-driven plays are not your speed, then you will likely be bored. I just re-watched it years after it was filmed, and it did not deserve the tepid reviews.

3071421,5,B001221DU6,"Let's start off this potentially controversial review with a short history of surprises. And may I just ask you to hold off that ""No"" button at the bottom until we finish this review?

So, I was surprised to learn that Sleuth, a film I greatly enjoyed, was remade with Michael Caine, Jude Law, directed by Kenneth Branagh, and written by Harold Pinter. I was surprised, upon discovering the critical reaction, to find that it was so negative. Upon seeing the film, I was further surprised that it was NOT the total piece of crap that I was led to believe. I was less surprised that there were others out there like me, like Roger Ebert, who actually enjoyed the film. And there's a lot here to enjoy. Just for the right viewer.

Firstly, this isn't the Sleuth your parents watched. In the original Sleuth, Laurence Olivier's Andrew Wyke was a charming, devious, and dastardly gentlemanly snob with a gleam in his eye and a grandfatherly tweed suit. In the hands of Michael Caine, Wyke is a despicable, terrifying, manipulative bastard. You're going to hate him, I'm sure. The original Milo Tindle was a regular chap, up for a bit of cat and mouse, but hiding a mind as sharp as his suits. Jude Law's Milo is a different beast; he's at once despicable and charismatic, brilliant and stupid. It's a complex performance that's sold wonderfully by the talented actor.

Most noticeably different is the set design. Wyke's manor was originally a cozy and eccentric old English manor filled with odd trinkets and animatronic dolls. Kenneth Branagh, or rather his set designer, conjures up a post-modernistic sterile nightmare of cold, bleak steel, glass, and odd lights. The set design seems to be hiding its own secrets.

But the weight of the film is balanced solely on the shoulders of two very capable actors. And they both give electrifying performances. Michael Caine, with his hooded eyes and his calm, cold, clipped words, holds the screen and the audience in thrall. Wyke is a villain so ruthlessly cunning, so dastardly clever, so second-guessingly sharp he could cut you through the screen. I had my doubts about Jude Law. Could he hold up against one of Britain's greatest talents? Law's always been a capable and dependable actor, but his performance as struggling actor (or is it hairdresser) Milo Tindle shows depths of acting talent we haven't seen before. Some call his performance hammy. I'd call it no-holds-barred, subtle, edgy, smart, and utterly brilliant. Here is a versatile and excellent actor if ever I saw one.

Harold Pinter, who also wrote the first film, writes the remake as well. I guess we have to thank him for the games. And to the careful viewer, you'll see the entire film is the game. The characters dance little verbal circles around each other, they strut their intelligence and try to second-guess each other, to reach into the other's psyche and shake it around. They weave a maze of lies, bluffs, words and promises like cat and mouse. Except, in this case they're both cats. And they're both mice.

And Kenneth Branagh's camera has hidden secrets, too. To the casual viewer, it looks cold. Impersonal. To the careful viewer, that's exactly how its supposed to look. Ominous, foreboding, removed, and sterile. It enhances the mood, sets us on edge. Illuminates the characters and the acting perfectly, sometimes so well you'll want it to take a step away from Michael Caine's unflinching gaze.

I totally get why someone wouldn't like this Sleuth. It's cold, the characters aren't that likeable. It's heady and at times confusing. There's a lot of the worst bits of human nature on display here, and there's no happy ending (or is there?). The first Sleuth was more enjoyable, more rich, more wickedly entertaining. That's the opinion of the majority, and I respect and understand it. I ask that you respect and understand my opinion: I think Sleuth is a devilishly clever, excellently acted, riveting and edgy psychological thriller. I give it 4.5 stars. Pick up a copy and decide for yourself.

P.S. The Yes and No buttons below are not for saying whether you agree (or not) with the reviewer. The comments section is for that. Drop me a line to tell me how you thought. Thanks for reading, cheers.",1410566400,,4236,4.833103448275862
3071422,3,B001221DU6,"Not the theatrical equal to the Olivier/Caine original film, yet edgier in some respects, particularly with regard to the character and behavior of his wife's lover, Milo (played by Jude Law). Harold Pinter's screenplay is loaded with anticipatory moments, but some fall flat. For example, there are too many scenes (close-ups, actually) of Michael Caine staring but saying nothing. It worked once or twice, when you wanted to 'hear' the wheels of his imagination turning, and try to puzzle out his next change of plan in dealing with Milo. But it became rather tiresome.

3071428,3,B001221DU6,"I saw the Olivier-Caine version of Sleuth a long time ago and all I remember is that I liked it a lot.  I also liked the idea that Caine had now taken Olivier's role and Jude Law was the young upstart.  The background was part of the enjoyment for me.  Both Caine and Law are brilliant actors and I had to think that they must have had a wonderful time doing this movie.  I admit that I kept seeing the actors, not the characters.  This version is less realistic, more mannered and although the style suited the cold-bloodedness of the story I think I favored the old-wood warmth of the manor house in the original version.  This was too cold, too blue, too bloodless to engage me in any real sympathy for the characters. Well when I saw that Pinter wrote the script I knew this was not going to be a heartwarmer.  It was sort of like watching a boxing match or a chess game, ego against ego. I found this fascinating in the beginning, especially when the two actors were face to face where we could see the slightest change of expression.

The film held me on the edge of my chair for well into the second half.  But after that the appeal began to lag.  Perhaps the sheer nastiness of the characters outweighed any humor or wit that they both displayed in the beginning.  The gay element seemed to bring things to a new low and by the time one of the characters was eliminated I really didn't care about either one of them.

The acting is first rate.  Jude law produced it and this was a terrific chance for him to show his stuff. But Caine is showing his age and it's hard to imagine him as a serious contender for the affections of ""Maggie,"" the woman they are fighting over.  Law is incredibly handsome and I admit that a great part of my enjoyment of the film was just looking at him.

3071432,1,B001221DU6,"This re-make version of ""Sleuth"" isn't just a ""klunker,"" as another review notes, it's a disgrace.
It's difficult to believe that, having co-starred as the younger Tindle in the outstanding first version, Michael Caine -- otherwise a principled actor -- would participate in this movie.
A good re-make COULD have been done, and it might have been an ironic twist to see Caine as Wyke.
Just two examples -- the ""break-in"" in the first movie was comic and, as we see later, intentionally humiliating; the ""break-in"" of the second is improbable bordering on impossible.
In the first movie, Wyke and Tindle have a battle of wits; Wyke sticks to his plan, and Tindle adapts as things change and ultimately comes up with his own plan. In the second movie, these two straight men, both interested in the same woman for different reasons, engaged in a very tense evening drama, suddenly engage in a gay flirtation with each other?

Overstated and misguided direction fails this version miserably.",1366243200,,355,5.592592592592593
3071435,5,B001221DU6,"I suppose which of the versions you prefer depends on which version you see first.

I saw the 2007 Sleuth in an old thrift shop and decided to give it a see just because I love Michael Caine and Jude Law. It instantly went to my list of favorites; a movie whose dialogue has to be entertaining enough to compensate the fact that there are only two characters and one setting throughout the entire film is a fairly audacious endeavor, and Harold Pinter pulled it off beautifully. I could go into more detail, but I loathe when people give away movie twists in their critiques so I'll suffice it to say I found it to be a very clever and unpredictable film. I can understand why other people may not enjoy it; there are some very tense, awkward moments. But they just build to the eccentricity of Milo's character and the credibility of Andrew's reaction.

Then I found out that not only was there an older version, but young Caine played Milo! I figured it would be even better, as I'm yet to see a remake trump an original. I was really sorely disappointed. The only thing I truly enjoyed about it was Caine's performance, especially seeing him so young. Sir Laurence Olivier's enactment was charming for the first half of the movie, but I was completely unmoved by the rest of it.

All in all, I found the `07 version to be far more engaging (the creepy toys with their cheesy music of the '72 film really threw me off). I constantly found my mind drifting to other things during the older film, but effortlessly focused for the entirety of the new one (even after the first time around); the teeter totter of subtle and intense character developments keep me engrossed every time. Jude Law and Michael Caine have far more chemistry together than Michael Caine and Sir Laurence Olivier. Also, without giving it away, the '07 ending was grounded and realistic while the `72's was... well, tacky and implausible.",1361404800,,1911,4.5982404692082115
3071436,2,B001221DU6,"This film would have been great if it was just Michael Caine and Jude Law on an empty theatre stage.  Their performances really show off their skills and how well they play off each other. From the interviews I have read this not a ""remake"" of the 1972 version (which is often said with every remake), it is a film that could stand alone.  I have only seen bits and pieces of the '72 version. What really hurts this film is the setting of the film and the odd directing styles.  Mr. Branagh style is a little too much experimental for my taste, I find the angles to be odd and distracting. You have two wonderful actors performing, we want to see their performances. The use of the security cameras made little sense and comes off as if it was added in post production. The set was also a distraction, which could be from my own views in what a house should be like.  The modern furniture and art was distracting and took away from the performances of the two actors.  The script was disjointed and it was hard for me as an viewer to  try to get a lock on where the characters were going or who was playing who. And that could easily be the whole point in that you have to keep guessing who is acting and who is not acting. I would recommend this film to any Michael Caine fan or Jude Law fan (this is the first Jude Law film I have watched in its entirety). The two actors show off their acting skills but have a director who did not believe that they alone could make a 88 film basically with two men talking interesting.",1360627200,,1523,4.216494845360825

3071438,3,B001221DU6,"It is a remake of an older film with Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. I will not compare the two because I have only seen excerpts from the first one.

This film has no real suspense because we know at once what it is all about. The interest of the film is in the two actors and how they build their confrontation in a super-minimalist set. The only sophistication is the lighting or the lights if you prefer. But the value of these changing lights is to make you, the audience, lose your footing and it works.

What about the two actors and their playing, acting, gaming or hunting, titillating appeal and anti-appeal? It is OK here and you will believe the devilish turn-around, turn-about and hairpin spinning in the situation. But then we can wonder what the film is all about. Does it represent in anyway anything but that kind of expertise on the side of the actors to lure us with something that is so obvious that any avid reader of thrillers and pulp fiction knows ahead of time what is coming?

We know for example the detective is no detective and we know he has to be the young man of before in a way or another because he knows too much and the way he is dressed is sloppy. Not typical of even a village detective in England with rural herds.

Too bad because Michael Caine had managed to dominate and control his London accent, but Jude Law had some kind of slurpy (just the proper word since he plays a gay-gay game later on: ""gettin head. when a girl orally pleases you. it involves suckin and is messy if not done correctly, hints the name,"" as the urban dictionary says) accent when trying to be a detective that he was not. Only partially convincing. The London accent is a lot more melodious and musical than that.

Entertaining but maybe not enjoyable.

3071441,1,B001221DU6,"I must say that when  i first saw Sleuth it was in a Theater. before that i never heard of the movies nor the story. Obviously the play was much more exciting than the movie itself,But if i had to choose between the 2 versions. I undoubtedly  prefer the fist one ,because it follows perfectly the original script.
This last Version in 2007 wasn't what it meant to be. Of course Caine and Jude's performances are outrageous.

But the modern sofisticated Andrews house set ,and all the new adaptation weren't  nesessary. Personally i think that the fact in the original  story of happening in the 70s its mostly another character. It adds a lot of mystery and glamour.
I dislike it to be so modern and virtually exagerated.
I hated Tindle in this version. And of course the last 25 minutes i was about to turn off my tv,when Caine appears to be gay.
What the hell??!!! Anthony Shaffer wherever he is still must be crying in his grave.
still both actors where amazing. 2 thumbs up for M.Caine and Jude Law
Just to finish here is what i think.
Sleuth its awesome and much better  when you watch it ,or read it in its original version.

This movie is twisted and has a convoluted plot of deception and double crosses.

The plot begins to drag as the last twist of homo-erocticsm becomes just one twist too many.  It may have felt genuine or trendy if the movie had been done with a lighter touch.  The movie is interesting mainly because of the great acting.

The young man travels from London (where he was shacked-up with the lady) to the very high-tech home of his nemesis, to gain his consent for a divorce, and an incredibly dangerous game of wits ensues.

One encounters a parallel set of interactions between Caine and a youthful Christopher Reeve as we see between the old Master and Jude Law in the film under review.

What can I say about this movie to justify the five stars which I have awarded to it? The acting is stellar, the story is terrific, the cinematography is first-class, and all this gels into a marvelous film.

3071448,5,B001221DU6,"I didn't know what to expect going into Sleuth.

I don't want to give too much away as far as the storyline goes, but it's the kind of story that will keep you attached to your TV screen the entire time.  Why?

Because the film is about one man who goes to see his wifes much older ex-husband.  Actually, the older ex-husband is STILL legally married to the woman as the younger guy finds out, and this leads to one of the most delightfully presented and interesting mystery movies I've seen in a while because the two men obviously dislike each other and they both want the woman for themselves.  The story is about the two of them playing serious games with each other.  Head games basically.

I'm not sure if the two men even realized ahead of time if their little tricks would work or not, but both characters were witty and intelligent and were unable to completely fool each other, which is what made the plot so intriguing.

And the twists?  There's many of them.  One twist involving the detective totally floored me because I didn't see it coming.

You never actually see the wife though, because the entire movie takes place inside the mansion.  A witty storyline to say the least, involving the two main characters and the deadly games they play with each other.

I also like the score by Patrick Doyle (brilliant composer). This is why I saw the remake.

The first half of this film is very well-paced and dialogue is bloody sharp and witty and I couldn't bloody well understand why I didn't like it the first time I saw it. Then, I saw why again about 15 minutes ago as I saw the rest. SPOILER WARNING!!!! After a shocking reveal (no kidding), the movie descended into what looked and sounded like gay undertones in the final 20-30 minutes of the film. If so, it's very weird, as Sir Michael Caine swore he'd never do another homosexual scene after the infamous kissing scene in ""Deathtrap."" SPOILER OVER!!!

All that having been said, it's a...mediocre effort from Kenneth Branagh. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT ABOUT ONE OF HIS MOVIES. The first half of the movie is excellent, but the second half is very, very, very weird. SPOILER!!!

The 1972 version with a young Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier featured both in roles that were alternately cold AND sympathetic, so that both were likeable at times.  This is critical if a film features just two people and your loyalty is supposed to switch back and forth.  They were also contrained by 1972 standards, so that non-stop profanity and gay undertones were not available as an easy substitute for more complex and sophisticated writing.  In this 2007 version, 74-year-old Michael Caine is, sadly, too old and feeble-looking for the part (Olivier was a robust 65 in the role) of the cuckholded husband and Jude Law's oily sex appeal is too common and transparent to make him believable as the seducer of a spoiled trophy wife.  Beyond that, both Caine and Law are so coarse and vulgar that they end up simply unlikeable, competing for a woman who is so shallow and fickle that she hardly seems worth the trouble.  When Caine shoots Law at the end, it hardly seems more significant than swatting a mosquito.  All of this in a drab, techno-wonder gray mansion that makes it feel like the whole thing is shot in an immmense basement!  The pace is rushed, too, so that character development seems unrealistic.  All totaled, it's too bad that such talent, on both sides of the camera, was wasted in this pointless re-working of a clever film from 35 years ago.",1245542400,,1587,4.741818181818182

3071456,3,B001221DU6,"Those familiar with the deliciously over-the-top 1972 version of Sleuth, which pitted legendary Laurence Olivier against a lean-and-hungry Michael Caine, may rightly wonder, why bother? They already got this one right. The play by Anthony Shaffer was a clever bit of gamesmanship -- a sort of country manor ""cozy"" mixed with a black comedy of manners spiced by dashes of Grand Guignol theatricality -- and it was played to the hilt by Lord Larry and his upstart challenger, Caine. Great hambone fun, check it out if you haven't seen it.

As if to compensate for the inevitable 'why bother' factor, the remake brings some heavyweights to the ring. In a neat reversal, we now have Michael Caine in the role of Elder Statesman and Jude Law (who filled Caine's shoes in a tepid remake of Alfie a few years back) looking to prove his mettle. Kenneth Branagh sits in the director's chair and the script is by a not-too-obscure scribe named Harold Pinter. The movie almost collapses under the weight of that line-up, but audiences ready to rumble with a cynical exercise in style, wit, and showmanship may get malicious pleasure out of the proceedings.

Caine and Law, two wonderful actors routinely hired to add prestige to Hollywood piffle, are clearly having a grand ol' time tearing into each other. Caine, with his hooded eyes and horsey choppers, looks like he could literally eat Jude Law for lunch. When it comes to performance, he just about does -- the effect is like watching Law endure an 86-minute Master's Workshop in acting. But it'd be wrong to assume that Law rolls over and plays dead. He's an awfully good actor in his own right (as ""Gattaca"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" attest) and he comes out (and goes down) swinging. But for my money, Caine, with his expert timing and nuanced delivery, wins this match in a tiebreak.

Watching two fine actors do their best playing two nasty characters doing their worst is a guilty pleasure. ""Sleuth"" succeeds as an exercise in pure style. The slick set design, kooky camerawork, and acting pyrotechnics--not to mention the Pinter-provided repartee--kept my mind engaged even as I lost all interest in the human element of the drama. As the action escalates and the two Alpha males (Alfie males? Haha...sorry) engage in a Pissing Contest of epic proportions, Pinter injects an unexpected element completely absent from the 1972 version. While the first go-round played with the idea of British class-consciousness by pairing aristocratic Olivier and Cockney Caine, this update has a lot more to say about gender roles and the crisis of masculinity (surprise, surprise, coming from Pinter).",1235952000,,2643,4.961625282167043
3071457,5,B001221DU6,"To anyone considering seeing the film, let me just say from the start: I loved it.  I had not seen the 1972 version prior, and I'm glad I hadn't.  The 2007 version is a very stylized work of art, like one of Wyke's sculptures.  At first I found the direction and cinematography distracting, as everything seemed to be happening offscreen, but as the story developted, I felt that it added a very cool layer to the story, especially in relation to the final scenes of the film.  I LOVED the characters by the end of the film, especially Jude Law's Milo.  Both characters had moments where you can sort of sense the artifice....and you come to realize that that's excatly what it is.  Overall, a great mystery and a dynamic character piece.

As for the DVD, I highly reccommend purchasing the complete DVD if you want to see this film.  I was considering purchasing a digital download, but I am so happy to have been able to view the director and actor interviews and commentary after watching the film.  They answered a lot of the questions I had, and explained a lot of the choices that they made.  Let's just say, you see a lot more the second time around.

Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine were the stars of the original picture, and in this version Caine assumes the Olivier role and Jude Law takes on the part Caine played in 1972.

Screenwriter Harold Pinter follows the general plot outline of Shaffer's play, but the smart, witty dialogue is all his and he also does a major re-working of the third act that, once again, may be different from the original, but I'm not sure if it's any better.

The play is set in best-selling author Caine's isolated English manor house where hairdresser/aspiring actor Law comes to discuss Michael's wife, the woman both are bedding.  What begins as a genteel conversation quickly escalates into a potentially deadly game of cat-and-mouse where one cannot tell what is real and what isn't.

Kenneth Branagh, whose visual stylings are reminiscent of Orson Welles, directed the drama in such a manner that one is mesmerized, even though you are familiar with the play and know it's gimmick.

This is, of course, a remake of the 1972 original starring Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine, with Caine playing the role Jude Law played in the remake. While the original had it's faults, such as being a bit too long and dragging in some spots, it stands as a truly underrated classic written by the superb Anthony Schaffer. The games playing between Olivier and Caine build momentum through the film and all three acts of the film tie in together perfectly. There's a reason behind each of their maddening steps to one-up each other. In the remake, there is fairly good acting but they are trying so hard to breathe life into a vapid screenplay that none of their work pays off. The film never really delves deep enough into the back story of these two men and their feud and contains a very strange gay angled twist at the end. Kenneth Branagh's direction is frustrating. With his overlong aerial shots, shots that cut off the heads of his two actors and lingering still shots that rely on the overly teched up house to thrill you, rather than any kind of real story telling. The film, if you appreciate real film making and storytelling in the slightest, is an extreme letdown. I'm sad to see Michael Caine's name anywhere near this project, and Branagh's for that matter. Perhaps the performances and direction would have been more impressive had Harold Pinter's screenplay carried any weight at all. It didn't and all are left with little to work with.

Caine also appears in the remake, but he plays the Olivier role, and Jude Law takes over as Caine's old character from 35 years ago. The story revolves entirely around a twisted confrontation between eccentric novelist Andrew Wyke (Caine) and Milo Tindle (Law), an out-of-work actor who's having an affair with Tindle's wife. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, who is an absolute genius, this movie is an absolute joy to watch. Everything about it is highly original, even though it's a remake of a classic film...how often can a reviewer make a claim like that?!

People who are unfamiliar with Pinter's style may be put off by this film, but ""Sleuth"" mirrors Pinter's stage work and is an absolute delight for theatre fans.

Unfortunately, the last 15 minutes of the film kind of spin out of control, and the story gets unnecessarily weird for a while.

It is in a movie like this, that it is evident what terrific actors Caine and Law are.

His Royal Majesty, Kenneth Branagh, directs the movie with a firm hand, and it is very cathartic to watch all this talent go on display. However, I cannot bring myself to give it 4 stars, because of one 30 minutes-long scene somewhere around the middle, which is unbelievingly absurd, and obvious, and makes the characters look like they are blind/stupid/naive beyond reality.

3071468,4,B001221DU6,"I enjoyed the new ""Sleuth.""  Jude Law seems to be making a statement by replaying old Michael Caine roles,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alfie-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00077BOFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alfie (Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and now ""Sleuth.""  With two Oscar nominations for ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" in '99 and ""Cold Mountain"" in 03, Law is one of the great working actors.  In this film, he does an excellent job as the somewhat unsure Milo Tindle, the police inspector in disguise and then revealing Milo's sinister emotional underbelly.

Quite frankly, it's been years since I watched the Olivier version.  More fresh in my mind is a stage version at East Carolina University where a shot was fired and about four seconds went by until the vase exploded.  The actor turned to the audience and remarked, ""That was a slow bullet!""  So this DVD version comes with me straining to recall the 1972 version for which Michael Caine earned a Best Actor nomination.

Caine's career has been celebrated with nominations for ""Alfie"" in 1966, ""Educating Rita"" in 1983, ""The Quiet American"" in 2002, and two Oscars for ""Hannah & Her Sisters"" in 1986 & ""Cider House Rules"" in 1999.  The DVD extras are interesting as Caine describes a minimalist emotional exterior allowing the lines and the audience's imagination to fill in the blanks.  Caine gives a tightly controlled performance as Andrew Wyke.  The difference between his and Olivier's performance is also of note from Caine's perspective in the DVD special features.  I also found it interesting that this was shot in 4 weeks vs. 12 [think I recall that correctly] for the 1972 film.

Kenneth Branagh who was named as ""Best New Director"" for ""Henry V"" by the New York Film Critics Circle in 1989 keeps the cat & mouse game between these two characters ever moving and shifting.  The result is a highly cerebral film demanding the viewer constantly focus on subtle shifts.

Harold Pinter has had two previous Oscar nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay for ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" in 1981 and ""Betrayal"" in 1983.  He reshapes the original script with sado-homo-erotic overtones in the last third of the film.  In short, this is the sleaziest of the versions I've seen, which seemed superimposed on the story.

Haris Zambarloukos turns in excellent work as cinematographer, keeping the action moving in this one-house set.  I particularly appreciated the opening sequences shot from high in the house looking straight down.  When Michael Caine shakes Jude Law's hand at the front door, all we see is an arm protruding from the entryway.

Celia Bobak earned an Oscar nomination as Best Art Director for ""Phantom of the Opera"" in 2004.  Here she does an excellent job as set director, working with Ian White's art direction.

This is a stylish intense cerebral thriller with two blockbuster performances and good direction.  Enjoy!",1208131200,,2961,5.304721030042918

Certainly, no demerits on the acting front, though.  Both stars are superb.

There's an entertaining commentary with Branagh and Michael Caine that's at it's best when Ken quizzes him on the original film.

3071472,4,B001221DU6,"Given the ongoing onslaught of remakes of films, both classic and trashy, that Hollywood has been overdosing on in recent years, there is an obvious impulse to label this new version of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleuth/dp/B00005R24G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleuth</a>"" a remake of one of the few films in history in which the entire cast was nominated for acting Oscars (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Give-Em-Hell-Harry/dp/B000E7I736/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Give Em Hell, Harry!</a>"" would be the other; ""Who's Afraid of the Virginia Woolf?"" would be on the list too if they had not undone the inherent claustrophobia of Edward Albee's play with the unnecessary road trip).  However, usually when you are ""remaking"" a play, you stick to the play.  Such is the case with the various versions of classics like ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" where the changes between the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brando-Leigh/dp/B000EBD9TY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brando-Leigh)</a>&nbsp;version and the one with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baldwin-Lange/dp/6304052723/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baldwin-Lange</a>&nbsp;are relatively minute.  However, what we have here is a reconcpetualization, courtesy of Harold Pinter.  The key change is not simply updating Wyke's toys from games and puzzles to technology, but rather the way Pinter comes up with a totally new ""third"" act.

The point of reference for this movie should not be all of the remakes that Hollywood is infatuated with, but those rare reconceputaliations that are done for artistic rather than commercial reasons (the one that came to my mind the most while watching ""Sleuth"" was Akira Kurosawa's transformation of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Lear/dp/019832054X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Lear</a>"" into ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ran/dp/B000BB14YY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ran</a>"").  In that regard the key member of the production is not director Kenneth Brannagh but screenwriter Harold Pinter.  Getting Pinter to do this script was pivotal, because it is difficult to fault a Nobel Laureate when he wants to reimagine a script like this.  Plus, Pinter has a track record of transforming the works of others, proven once and for all time by his script for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-French-Lieutenant-s-Woman/dp/B00005LOKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The French Lieutenant's Woman</a>.""  If playwright Anthony Shaffer were still alive no doubt he would have recruited to update his play, but he passed away in 2001.  In that context getting Pinter (who had seen neither the play nor the movie) was a masterstroke).

I am not surprised that things have come full circle with Michael Caine now playing the Laurence Olivier role; we have seen such things before (e.g., Patty Duke going from playing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Helen-Keller/dp/B000056HEB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Helen Keller</a>&nbsp;to playing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie-Sullivan/dp/B0007YN268/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie Sullivan</a>&nbsp;in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Miracle-Worker/dp/0743457587/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Miracle Worker</a>.""  But while Caine's presence gives legitimacy to the proceedings and Jude Law's performance is as fine as anything he has done to date, this ""Sleuth"" is really Pinter's show.  Ultimately, I would maintain that this film is most decidedly not for those who have never seen the original because the ability to appreciate this ""Sleuth"" is predicated on your knowing the original story (notice that this time there are only names of two actors in the opening credits and not three).  The danger here is to be lulled by your familiarity with the story that you ignore the way Pinter has changed things up during the first two ""sets"" to up the ante for the fatal finale.  I still prefer the original as being one of the most effective twists I have seen in a movie (although I am sure it is much more effective on stage), but this one has its moments, most notably in the finale confrontation as Caine and Law engaged in the psychological duel that Pinter has crafted for them.

3071477,2,B001221DU6,"I don't know if I would go so far as to call the original film version of ""Sleuth"" a classic, but it is a darn good film and features virtuoso performances from Sir Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine.

Approximately a year ago, I heard of the plans to remake ""Sleuth"". Groan. Can't they at least try to come up with a new idea in Hollywood? Change the character's names and the title and call something it new? Why mess with a classic? Then, I remembered the original is a very good film, but not a classic. Michael Caine and Jude Law were signed to play the roles Olivier and Caine originated. This could be interesting. Michael Caine appearing in both versions? My interest was piqued. When I heard Kenneth Branagh was directing from a Harold Pinter screenplay, I was hooked.

The new version has some good things going for it, but the bad things far outweigh the good making ""Sleuth (2007)"" a disappointment.

Milo Tindle (Law), an out-of-work actor, arrives at the estate of Andrew Wyke (Caine), a hugely successful mystery novelist. Wyke has summoned the young man to discuss the affair he is having with his wife. Milo insists Wyke's wife is leaving him and Wyke is only too glad to let her go, he has a mistress of his own. But he wants the separation and divorce to be permanent; he doesn't want his ex-wife running back to him when Milo's money runs out. Wyke suggests Milo `break' into the house and steal some jewels worth One Million Pounds. Wyke has the name of a fence who will give Milo 800,000 pounds for the jewels and that should last them a while. Andrew has thought of everything. Milo agrees and Wyke uses his home's elaborate electronics and surveillance system to guide him through the process, to make it seem real. But it wouldn't seem real unless Wyke found the robber and defended his home would it?

""Sleuth"" originated as a play and it showcases two characters who play a game of verbal and psychological cat and mouse, sparring with one another, trying to gain the upper hand. In the new version, there are many changes, many of which benefit the overall film.

As Milo drives up to Wyke's house, Branagh introduces us to the elaborate security system the multi-millionaire has installed in his country estate. Milo's car triggers an alarm at the gate and his every move is caught on surveillance camera - there doesn't seem to be a centimeter of the expansive grounds he wouldn't be able to see on one of the system's surveillance screens.

As Milo attempts the `break-in', Wyke watches him every step of the way, directing him as he watches his adversary's every move. And Tindle gets caught up in the game, using his acting skills to become a `burglar'.

The new version of this film is about half as long as the original was. And this benefits the new film. Because of the length, the original version seems even more stagey; to watch two actors facing off against one another for the entire length of a film running about two and a half hours doesn't help the film escape its stage roots. The new version is about 90 minutes long allowing it to move at a faster clip, giving us less time to think about the fact we are simply watching two actors on screen the whole time.

It is also interesting to watch Caine take on the other role in the story. Michael Caine is one of the best actors of our time, but to see him play the other side of the coin provides for an interesting look at his career. He portrays Andrew Wyke in a suitably devious way. As the story progresses, we see shades of his anger, his relief, his amusement, all qualities we would expect to see in a famous mystery novelist.

And that is where the benefits of ""Sleuth (2007)"" end.

When Milo drives up to the large country estate, we expect the two actors to face off in a huge, expansive maze. The original film provided a huge country house for the two actors to chase each other through. Of course, this provides an advantage to Andrew (played by Olivier in the original) because he knows the various secrets of his expansive home. When Milo (Law) drives up to the estate in this new version, I had high hopes. It appears to be the exact same type of home. Then, he enters the house and we immediately see the hand of Andrew's wife in the ridiculous modern furniture and design. Initially, the house seems unusual and interesting. We soon realize the two actors are moving through a series of four rooms. What happened to the rest of the estate? This setting appears to be little more than a luxury apartment in some swank new building. It seems very small and claustrophobic. And very `play-like'.

For a while, the shorter length seems to benefit the film. But as Law's Milo Tindle becomes more engrossed in the story, the actor becomes less and less convincing. Law seems to think he needs to scream, shout and act like an actor in a horror film in order to get his character across, almost as though he is rushing through all of his character's emotions. You could put some orange glaze on Law and serve him at Easter dinner. His hammy performance is even more egregious when you watch him act with Caine. Caine is an accomplished actor and can make even the most over the top performance seem more natural. Andrew is an interesting character and Caine imbues him with calmness, making him more believable. Law, on the other hand, seems possessed by the devil as he grins maniacally and chews the scenery.

In the original, Tindle is a hairdresser, in this new version, an out-of-work actor. Yet, oddly, Wyke refers to the younger man as a hairdresser a few times. Is this a mistake? Did Pinter simply forget to replace all of the references to `hairdresser' when he copied the original script? Is this meant to be a put down?

If you are going to remake a well-known film, and rework the story, make sure it works. The beauty of the original is it is basically two stories and the two characters change their roles. In the first half, one man has the upper hand. In the second, the other does. In Pinter's version, one man has the upper hand. Then the other. Then later, the other regains the advantage. Oh, wait, maybe not. It goes back and forth, almost on a whim, and the game of cat and mouse loses focus and doesn't make sense. There is also a ludicrous plot development late in the story which does nothing to help Law's performance, only exaggerating all of the bad elements of his style.

""Sleuth (2007)"" is a big disappointment. Rent the original and watch two actors at the top of their game spar against one another.",1201046400,,6539,4.530508474576271

3305899,1,B001221DU6,"Disrespectful remake of Anthony Shaffer's play and the 1972 film version abandons all of the original's dialogue in an adaptation by Harold Pinter that reduces the original material to its essential plot elements, abandoning all of the sense of fun and playfulness of the original.  The problem is that the interesting thing about Sleuth was never the plot any more than the interesting thing about a Shakespeare play is the plot.  The joy of Sleuth was that the fancy dialogue allowed the two lead actors to go to town with broadly enjoyable performances.  Were Lawrence Olivier and Michael Caine ever more pure fun than in the 1972 filmed version of Sleuth?

This version features minimal set design (to contrast with the house in the original which was overstuffed with furniture, games, toys and little traps) and more direct dialogue.  This version of Sleuth actually feels like a repudiation of everything that made the original entertaining in the first place.  Harold Pinter may regard Anthony Shafer as a minor playwright but that doesn't give him the right to crap all over the other man's work.

It's not really a mystery why this version of Sleuth wasn't a hit with critics or audiences.  It's joyless, empty, pointless and has all the humor of an intellectual scold telling you endlessly how much smarter he is than you.  Harold Pinter clearly has no idea what made the original so entertaining.  To be fair to Anthony Shafer, who isn't all that highly regarded now, he also wrote the screenplays for Alfred Hitchcock's only great late period film (Frenzy) and for one of the most genuinely creepy horror films of all time (The Wicker Man).  Harold Pinter may be a critical darling, but try to find anything half as entertaining in his long list of credits for the stage and screen.  Sleuth might have worked if director Kenneth Branaugh had used the original play but it represents a very bad fit between material and writer where Harold Pinter is concerned.

Those familiar with the 1972 film of Sleuth will notice that this version closely follows the original in letter if not spirit for the first two thirds.  It's in the third act where Harold Pinter tries to make the material his own by turning Sleuth into a psychodrama with strong undertones of homophobia.  Not coincidentally, that's also about where this version of Sleuth turns from being merely mediocre to going completely off the rails.  The new ending like the rest of the film is blunt but ineffective.

Michael Caine and Jude Law do what they can, but the only way someone would likely enjoy this film is if they had no exposure to the 1972 original.",1473724800,,2632,4.8133333333333335

3305918,5,B001221DU6,"Let's start off this potentially controversial review with a short history of surprises. And may I just ask you to hold off that ""No"" button at the bottom until we finish this review?

So, I was surprised to learn that Sleuth, a film I greatly enjoyed, was remade with Michael Caine, Jude Law, directed by Kenneth Branagh, and written by Harold Pinter. I was surprised, upon discovering the critical reaction, to find that it was so negative. Upon seeing the film, I was further surprised that it was NOT the total piece of crap that I was led to believe. I was less surprised that there were others out there like me, like Roger Ebert, who actually enjoyed the film. And there's a lot here to enjoy. Just for the right viewer.

Firstly, this isn't the Sleuth your parents watched. In the original Sleuth, Laurence Olivier's Andrew Wyke was a charming, devious, and dastardly gentlemanly snob with a gleam in his eye and a grandfatherly tweed suit. In the hands of Michael Caine, Wyke is a despicable, terrifying, manipulative bastard. You're going to hate him, I'm sure. The original Milo Tindle was a regular chap, up for a bit of cat and mouse, but hiding a mind as sharp as his suits. Jude Law's Milo is a different beast; he's at once despicable and charismatic, brilliant and stupid. It's a complex performance that's sold wonderfully by the talented actor.

Most noticeably different is the set design. Wyke's manor was originally a cozy and eccentric old English manor filled with odd trinkets and animatronic dolls. Kenneth Branagh, or rather his set designer, conjures up a post-modernistic sterile nightmare of cold, bleak steel, glass, and odd lights. The set design seems to be hiding its own secrets.

But the weight of the film is balanced solely on the shoulders of two very capable actors. And they both give electrifying performances. Michael Caine, with his hooded eyes and his calm, cold, clipped words, holds the screen and the audience in thrall. Wyke is a villain so ruthlessly cunning, so dastardly clever, so second-guessingly sharp he could cut you through the screen. I had my doubts about Jude Law. Could he hold up against one of Britain's greatest talents? Law's always been a capable and dependable actor, but his performance as struggling actor (or is it hairdresser) Milo Tindle shows depths of acting talent we haven't seen before. Some call his performance hammy. I'd call it no-holds-barred, subtle, edgy, smart, and utterly brilliant. Here is a versatile and excellent actor if ever I saw one.

Harold Pinter, who also wrote the first film, writes the remake as well. I guess we have to thank him for the games. And to the careful viewer, you'll see the entire film is the game. The characters dance little verbal circles around each other, they strut their intelligence and try to second-guess each other, to reach into the other's psyche and shake it around. They weave a maze of lies, bluffs, words and promises like cat and mouse. Except, in this case they're both cats. And they're both mice.

And Kenneth Branagh's camera has hidden secrets, too. To the casual viewer, it looks cold. Impersonal. To the careful viewer, that's exactly how its supposed to look. Ominous, foreboding, removed, and sterile. It enhances the mood, sets us on edge. Illuminates the characters and the acting perfectly, sometimes so well you'll want it to take a step away from Michael Caine's unflinching gaze.

I totally get why someone wouldn't like this Sleuth. It's cold, the characters aren't that likeable. It's heady and at times confusing. There's a lot of the worst bits of human nature on display here, and there's no happy ending (or is there?). The first Sleuth was more enjoyable, more rich, more wickedly entertaining. That's the opinion of the majority, and I respect and understand it. I ask that you respect and understand my opinion: I think Sleuth is a devilishly clever, excellently acted, riveting and edgy psychological thriller. I give it 4.5 stars. Pick up a copy and decide for yourself.

3305919,3,B001221DU6,"Not the theatrical equal to the Olivier/Caine original film, yet edgier in some respects, particularly with regard to the character and behavior of his wife's lover, Milo (played by Jude Law). Harold Pinter's screenplay is loaded with anticipatory moments, but some fall flat. For example, there are too many scenes (close-ups, actually) of Michael Caine staring but saying nothing. It worked once or twice, when you wanted to 'hear' the wheels of his imagination turning, and try to puzzle out his next change of plan in dealing with Milo. But it became rather tiresome.

3305925,3,B001221DU6,"I saw the Olivier-Caine version of Sleuth a long time ago and all I remember is that I liked it a lot.  I also liked the idea that Caine had now taken Olivier's role and Jude Law was the young upstart.  The background was part of the enjoyment for me.  Both Caine and Law are brilliant actors and I had to think that they must have had a wonderful time doing this movie.  I admit that I kept seeing the actors, not the characters.  This version is less realistic, more mannered and although the style suited the cold-bloodedness of the story I think I favored the old-wood warmth of the manor house in the original version.  This was too cold, too blue, too bloodless to engage me in any real sympathy for the characters. Well when I saw that Pinter wrote the script I knew this was not going to be a heartwarmer.  It was sort of like watching a boxing match or a chess game, ego against ego. I found this fascinating in the beginning, especially when the two actors were face to face where we could see the slightest change of expression.

The film held me on the edge of my chair for well into the second half.  But after that the appeal began to lag.  Perhaps the sheer nastiness of the characters outweighed any humor or wit that they both displayed in the beginning.  The gay element seemed to bring things to a new low and by the time one of the characters was eliminated I really didn't care about either one of them.

The acting is first rate.  Jude law produced it and this was a terrific chance for him to show his stuff. But Caine is showing his age and it's hard to imagine him as a serious contender for the affections of ""Maggie,"" the woman they are fighting over.  Law is incredibly handsome and I admit that a great part of my enjoyment of the film was just looking at him.

It's a stylishly fun head trip but not really an enjoyable film.",1383955200,,1855,4.275071633237823

3305929,1,B001221DU6,"This re-make version of ""Sleuth"" isn't just a ""klunker,"" as another review notes, it's a disgrace.
It's difficult to believe that, having co-starred as the younger Tindle in the outstanding first version, Michael Caine -- otherwise a principled actor -- would participate in this movie.
A good re-make COULD have been done, and it might have been an ironic twist to see Caine as Wyke.
Just two examples -- the ""break-in"" in the first movie was comic and, as we see later, intentionally humiliating; the ""break-in"" of the second is improbable bordering on impossible.
In the first movie, Wyke and Tindle have a battle of wits; Wyke sticks to his plan, and Tindle adapts as things change and ultimately comes up with his own plan. In the second movie, these two straight men, both interested in the same woman for different reasons, engaged in a very tense evening drama, suddenly engage in a gay flirtation with each other?
Totally senseless.",1376524800,,941,4.8875

3305931,3,B001221DU6,"A fan of the Olivier-Caine version, I must say there are enough changes in Pinter's adaptation that warrant a remake.

Overstated and misguided direction fails this version miserably.",1366243200,,355,5.592592592592593
3305932,5,B001221DU6,"I suppose which of the versions you prefer depends on which version you see first.

I saw the 2007 Sleuth in an old thrift shop and decided to give it a see just because I love Michael Caine and Jude Law. It instantly went to my list of favorites; a movie whose dialogue has to be entertaining enough to compensate the fact that there are only two characters and one setting throughout the entire film is a fairly audacious endeavor, and Harold Pinter pulled it off beautifully. I could go into more detail, but I loathe when people give away movie twists in their critiques so I'll suffice it to say I found it to be a very clever and unpredictable film. I can understand why other people may not enjoy it; there are some very tense, awkward moments. But they just build to the eccentricity of Milo's character and the credibility of Andrew's reaction.

Then I found out that not only was there an older version, but young Caine played Milo! I figured it would be even better, as I'm yet to see a remake trump an original. I was really sorely disappointed. The only thing I truly enjoyed about it was Caine's performance, especially seeing him so young. Sir Laurence Olivier's enactment was charming for the first half of the movie, but I was completely unmoved by the rest of it.

All in all, I found the `07 version to be far more engaging (the creepy toys with their cheesy music of the '72 film really threw me off). I constantly found my mind drifting to other things during the older film, but effortlessly focused for the entirety of the new one (even after the first time around); the teeter totter of subtle and intense character developments keep me engrossed every time. Jude Law and Michael Caine have far more chemistry together than Michael Caine and Sir Laurence Olivier. Also, without giving it away, the '07 ending was grounded and realistic while the `72's was... well, tacky and implausible.",1361404800,,1911,4.5982404692082115
3305933,2,B001221DU6,"This film would have been great if it was just Michael Caine and Jude Law on an empty theatre stage.  Their performances really show off their skills and how well they play off each other. From the interviews I have read this not a ""remake"" of the 1972 version (which is often said with every remake), it is a film that could stand alone.  I have only seen bits and pieces of the '72 version. What really hurts this film is the setting of the film and the odd directing styles.  Mr. Branagh style is a little too much experimental for my taste, I find the angles to be odd and distracting. You have two wonderful actors performing, we want to see their performances. The use of the security cameras made little sense and comes off as if it was added in post production. The set was also a distraction, which could be from my own views in what a house should be like.  The modern furniture and art was distracting and took away from the performances of the two actors.  The script was disjointed and it was hard for me as an viewer to  try to get a lock on where the characters were going or who was playing who. And that could easily be the whole point in that you have to keep guessing who is acting and who is not acting. I would recommend this film to any Michael Caine fan or Jude Law fan (this is the first Jude Law film I have watched in its entirety). The two actors show off their acting skills but have a director who did not believe that they alone could make a 88 film basically with two men talking interesting.",1360627200,,1523,4.216494845360825

3305935,3,B001221DU6,"It is a remake of an older film with Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. I will not compare the two because I have only seen excerpts from the first one.

This film has no real suspense because we know at once what it is all about. The interest of the film is in the two actors and how they build their confrontation in a super-minimalist set. The only sophistication is the lighting or the lights if you prefer. But the value of these changing lights is to make you, the audience, lose your footing and it works.

What about the two actors and their playing, acting, gaming or hunting, titillating appeal and anti-appeal? It is OK here and you will believe the devilish turn-around, turn-about and hairpin spinning in the situation. But then we can wonder what the film is all about. Does it represent in anyway anything but that kind of expertise on the side of the actors to lure us with something that is so obvious that any avid reader of thrillers and pulp fiction knows ahead of time what is coming?

We know for example the detective is no detective and we know he has to be the young man of before in a way or another because he knows too much and the way he is dressed is sloppy. Not typical of even a village detective in England with rural herds.

Too bad because Michael Caine had managed to dominate and control his London accent, but Jude Law had some kind of slurpy (just the proper word since he plays a gay-gay game later on: ""gettin head. when a girl orally pleases you. it involves suckin and is messy if not done correctly, hints the name,"" as the urban dictionary says) accent when trying to be a detective that he was not. Only partially convincing. The London accent is a lot more melodious and musical than that.

Entertaining but maybe not enjoyable.

Obviously the play was much more exciting than the movie itself,But if i had to choose between the 2 versions. I undoubtedly  prefer the fist one ,because it follows perfectly the original script.
This last Version in 2007 wasn't what it meant to be. Of course Caine and Jude's performances are outrageous.

But the modern sofisticated Andrews house set ,and all the new adaptation weren't  nesessary. Personally i think that the fact in the original  story of happening in the 70s its mostly another character. It adds a lot of mystery and glamour.
I dislike it to be so modern and virtually exagerated.
I hated Tindle in this version. And of course the last 25 minutes i was about to turn off my tv,when Caine appears to be gay.
What the hell??!!! Anthony Shaffer wherever he is still must be crying in his grave.

I don't want to give too much away as far as the storyline goes, but it's the kind of story that will keep you attached to your TV screen the entire time.  Why?

Because the film is about one man who goes to see his wifes much older ex-husband.  Actually, the older ex-husband is STILL legally married to the woman as the younger guy finds out, and this leads to one of the most delightfully presented and interesting mystery movies I've seen in a while because the two men obviously dislike each other and they both want the woman for themselves.  The story is about the two of them playing serious games with each other.  Head games basically.

I'm not sure if the two men even realized ahead of time if their little tricks would work or not, but both characters were witty and intelligent and were unable to completely fool each other, which is what made the plot so intriguing.

And the twists?  There's many of them.  One twist involving the detective totally floored me because I didn't see it coming.

You never actually see the wife though, because the entire movie takes place inside the mansion.  A witty storyline to say the least, involving the two main characters and the deadly games they play with each other.

I recommend this movie to those who like to pay close attention to clever storylines, enjoy plot twists, and throw in just enough action to keep your attention.",1251590400,,1435,4.55859375
3305946,3,B001221DU6,"The remake of ""Sleuth"" interested me, though I didn't care for the original film because the plot didn't appeal to me, for some reason. However, I saw both versions because I like Sir Laurence Olivier (the greatest Shakespearean actor, director, writer & producer of all time), Joseph Mankewicz (the director of ""Cleopatra"" and ""All About Eve""), Sir Michael Caine, Jude Law (""AI: Artificial Intelligence"")and Kenneth Branagh (the greatest Shakespearean actor, writer, director & producer after Sir Laurence Olivier), respectively. I also like the score by Patrick Doyle (brilliant composer). This is why I saw the remake.

The first half of this film is very well-paced and dialogue is bloody sharp and witty and I couldn't bloody well understand why I didn't like it the first time I saw it. Then, I saw why again about 15 minutes ago as I saw the rest. SPOILER WARNING!!!! After a shocking reveal (no kidding), the movie descended into what looked and sounded like gay undertones in the final 20-30 minutes of the film. If so, it's very weird, as Sir Michael Caine swore he'd never do another homosexual scene after the infamous kissing scene in ""Deathtrap."" SPOILER OVER!!!

All that having been said, it's a...mediocre effort from Kenneth Branagh. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT ABOUT ONE OF HIS MOVIES. The first half of the movie is excellent, but the second half is very, very, very weird. SPOILER!!! I thought this version would have a different ending than the original (I based that idea on a line spoken by Milo early in the film), but the ending is the same as in the original.

This film was probably a deeply satisfying endeavor for the actors and director involved, but didn't deliver a very satisfying entertainment experience to me, a member of the audience.

The 1972 version with a young Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier featured both in roles that were alternately cold AND sympathetic, so that both were likeable at times.  This is critical if a film features just two people and your loyalty is supposed to switch back and forth.  They were also contrained by 1972 standards, so that non-stop profanity and gay undertones were not available as an easy substitute for more complex and sophisticated writing.  In this 2007 version, 74-year-old Michael Caine is, sadly, too old and feeble-looking for the part (Olivier was a robust 65 in the role) of the cuckholded husband and Jude Law's oily sex appeal is too common and transparent to make him believable as the seducer of a spoiled trophy wife.  Beyond that, both Caine and Law are so coarse and vulgar that they end up simply unlikeable, competing for a woman who is so shallow and fickle that she hardly seems worth the trouble.  When Caine shoots Law at the end, it hardly seems more significant than swatting a mosquito.  All of this in a drab, techno-wonder gray mansion that makes it feel like the whole thing is shot in an immmense basement!  The pace is rushed, too, so that character development seems unrealistic.  All totaled, it's too bad that such talent, on both sides of the camera, was wasted in this pointless re-working of a clever film from 35 years ago.",1245542400,,1587,4.741818181818182

Excellent acting from both Caine and Law. I think the reviews are too tainted by preconceived views and expectations from the previous movie. Be true to the acting experience and you will not be able to give it 1 Star will you?

3305953,3,B001221DU6,"Those familiar with the deliciously over-the-top 1972 version of Sleuth, which pitted legendary Laurence Olivier against a lean-and-hungry Michael Caine, may rightly wonder, why bother? They already got this one right. The play by Anthony Shaffer was a clever bit of gamesmanship -- a sort of country manor ""cozy"" mixed with a black comedy of manners spiced by dashes of Grand Guignol theatricality -- and it was played to the hilt by Lord Larry and his upstart challenger, Caine. Great hambone fun, check it out if you haven't seen it.

As if to compensate for the inevitable 'why bother' factor, the remake brings some heavyweights to the ring. In a neat reversal, we now have Michael Caine in the role of Elder Statesman and Jude Law (who filled Caine's shoes in a tepid remake of Alfie a few years back) looking to prove his mettle. Kenneth Branagh sits in the director's chair and the script is by a not-too-obscure scribe named Harold Pinter. The movie almost collapses under the weight of that line-up, but audiences ready to rumble with a cynical exercise in style, wit, and showmanship may get malicious pleasure out of the proceedings.

Caine and Law, two wonderful actors routinely hired to add prestige to Hollywood piffle, are clearly having a grand ol' time tearing into each other. Caine, with his hooded eyes and horsey choppers, looks like he could literally eat Jude Law for lunch. When it comes to performance, he just about does -- the effect is like watching Law endure an 86-minute Master's Workshop in acting. But it'd be wrong to assume that Law rolls over and plays dead. He's an awfully good actor in his own right (as ""Gattaca"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" attest) and he comes out (and goes down) swinging. But for my money, Caine, with his expert timing and nuanced delivery, wins this match in a tiebreak.

Watching two fine actors do their best playing two nasty characters doing their worst is a guilty pleasure. ""Sleuth"" succeeds as an exercise in pure style. The slick set design, kooky camerawork, and acting pyrotechnics--not to mention the Pinter-provided repartee--kept my mind engaged even as I lost all interest in the human element of the drama. As the action escalates and the two Alpha males (Alfie males? Haha...sorry) engage in a Pissing Contest of epic proportions, Pinter injects an unexpected element completely absent from the 1972 version. While the first go-round played with the idea of British class-consciousness by pairing aristocratic Olivier and Cockney Caine, this update has a lot more to say about gender roles and the crisis of masculinity (surprise, surprise, coming from Pinter).",1235952000,,2643,4.961625282167043
3305954,5,B001221DU6,"To anyone considering seeing the film, let me just say from the start: I loved it.  I had not seen the 1972 version prior, and I'm glad I hadn't.  The 2007 version is a very stylized work of art, like one of Wyke's sculptures.  At first I found the direction and cinematography distracting, as everything seemed to be happening offscreen, but as the story developted, I felt that it added a very cool layer to the story, especially in relation to the final scenes of the film.  I LOVED the characters by the end of the film, especially Jude Law's Milo.  Both characters had moments where you can sort of sense the artifice....and you come to realize that that's excatly what it is.  Overall, a great mystery and a dynamic character piece.

As for the DVD, I highly reccommend purchasing the complete DVD if you want to see this film.  I was considering purchasing a digital download, but I am so happy to have been able to view the director and actor interviews and commentary after watching the film.  They answered a lot of the questions I had, and explained a lot of the choices that they made.  Let's just say, you see a lot more the second time around.

Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine were the stars of the original picture, and in this version Caine assumes the Olivier role and Jude Law takes on the part Caine played in 1972.

Screenwriter Harold Pinter follows the general plot outline of Shaffer's play, but the smart, witty dialogue is all his and he also does a major re-working of the third act that, once again, may be different from the original, but I'm not sure if it's any better.

The play is set in best-selling author Caine's isolated English manor house where hairdresser/aspiring actor Law comes to discuss Michael's wife, the woman both are bedding.  What begins as a genteel conversation quickly escalates into a potentially deadly game of cat-and-mouse where one cannot tell what is real and what isn't.

Kenneth Branagh, whose visual stylings are reminiscent of Orson Welles, directed the drama in such a manner that one is mesmerized, even though you are familiar with the play and know it's gimmick.

Micheal Caine at his worst is always good.  Jude law could have been more subtle, and let me process this situation more. If you watch both films, and just watch you may see humor in the contrasts?  Maybe not?

3305960,1,B001221DU6,"Absolutely ridiculous. Harold Pinter's rambling, incoherent screenplay plays like a first draft of a trashy B movie script. This is, of course, a remake of the 1972 original starring Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine, with Caine playing the role Jude Law played in the remake. While the original had it's faults, such as being a bit too long and dragging in some spots, it stands as a truly underrated classic written by the superb Anthony Schaffer. The games playing between Olivier and Caine build momentum through the film and all three acts of the film tie in together perfectly. There's a reason behind each of their maddening steps to one-up each other. In the remake, there is fairly good acting but they are trying so hard to breathe life into a vapid screenplay that none of their work pays off. The film never really delves deep enough into the back story of these two men and their feud and contains a very strange gay angled twist at the end. Kenneth Branagh's direction is frustrating. With his overlong aerial shots, shots that cut off the heads of his two actors and lingering still shots that rely on the overly teched up house to thrill you, rather than any kind of real story telling. The film, if you appreciate real film making and storytelling in the slightest, is an extreme letdown. I'm sad to see Michael Caine's name anywhere near this project, and Branagh's for that matter. Perhaps the performances and direction would have been more impressive had Harold Pinter's screenplay carried any weight at all. It didn't and all are left with little to work with.

3305961,4,B001221DU6,"I knew even before I watched ""Sleuth"" that I would absolutely love it. This is a remake of the 1972 film with the same name that stars Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. Caine also appears in the remake, but he plays the Olivier role, and Jude Law takes over as Caine's old character from 35 years ago. The story revolves entirely around a twisted confrontation between eccentric novelist Andrew Wyke (Caine) and Milo Tindle (Law), an out-of-work actor who's having an affair with Tindle's wife. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, who is an absolute genius, this movie is an absolute joy to watch. Everything about it is highly original, even though it's a remake of a classic film...how often can a reviewer make a claim like that?! Caine and Law have an amazing on-screen connection, and both deliver outstanding performances. The screenplay was written by Harold Pinter, who is famous in the world of absurdist theatre. People who are unfamiliar with Pinter's style may be put off by this film, but ""Sleuth"" mirrors Pinter's stage work and is an absolute delight for theatre fans.

Unfortunately, the last 15 minutes of the film kind of spin out of control, and the story gets unnecessarily weird for a while.

3305964,3,B001221DU6,"Two terrific actors try to out-smart each other in ""Sleuth"", a re-make of a 70's movie starring Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. This version also features Caine, but now he plays the ""other"" role, with Jude Law filling his shoes quite successfully.
Andrew Wyke (Caine) is a wealthy novelist living in a high-tech mansion, and he doesn't seem to mind horribly that his wife is cheating on him with Milo Tindle (Law). Milo comes to the mansion in order to discuss this arrangement, and also to persuade Andrew to sign the divorce papers. However, their very polite and sophisticated argument slowly evolves into something much more dangerous.
It is in a movie like this, that it is evident what terrific actors Caine and Law are. They are able to be interesting and versatile, so that when the score of their cat-and-mouse game turns, you actually believe it is the other man who suffers. His Royal Majesty, Kenneth Branagh, directs the movie with a firm hand, and it is very cathartic to watch all this talent go on display. However, I cannot bring myself to give it 4 stars, because of one 30 minutes-long scene somewhere around the middle, which is unbelievingly absurd, and obvious, and makes the characters look like they are blind/stupid/naive beyond reality.

With two Oscar nominations for ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" in '99 and ""Cold Mountain"" in 03, Law is one of the great working actors.  In this film, he does an excellent job as the somewhat unsure Milo Tindle, the police inspector in disguise and then revealing Milo's sinister emotional underbelly.

Quite frankly, it's been years since I watched the Olivier version.  More fresh in my mind is a stage version at East Carolina University where a shot was fired and about four seconds went by until the vase exploded.  The actor turned to the audience and remarked, ""That was a slow bullet!""  So this DVD version comes with me straining to recall the 1972 version for which Michael Caine earned a Best Actor nomination.

Caine's career has been celebrated with nominations for ""Alfie"" in 1966, ""Educating Rita"" in 1983, ""The Quiet American"" in 2002, and two Oscars for ""Hannah & Her Sisters"" in 1986 & ""Cider House Rules"" in 1999.  The DVD extras are interesting as Caine describes a minimalist emotional exterior allowing the lines and the audience's imagination to fill in the blanks.  Caine gives a tightly controlled performance as Andrew Wyke.  The difference between his and Olivier's performance is also of note from Caine's perspective in the DVD special features.  I also found it interesting that this was shot in 4 weeks vs. 12 [think I recall that correctly] for the 1972 film.

Kenneth Branagh who was named as ""Best New Director"" for ""Henry V"" by the New York Film Critics Circle in 1989 keeps the cat & mouse game between these two characters ever moving and shifting.  The result is a highly cerebral film demanding the viewer constantly focus on subtle shifts.

Harold Pinter has had two previous Oscar nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay for ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" in 1981 and ""Betrayal"" in 1983.  He reshapes the original script with sado-homo-erotic overtones in the last third of the film.  In short, this is the sleaziest of the versions I've seen, which seemed superimposed on the story.

Haris Zambarloukos turns in excellent work as cinematographer, keeping the action moving in this one-house set.  I particularly appreciated the opening sequences shot from high in the house looking straight down.  When Michael Caine shakes Jude Law's hand at the front door, all we see is an arm protruding from the entryway.

Celia Bobak earned an Oscar nomination as Best Art Director for ""Phantom of the Opera"" in 2004.  Here she does an excellent job as set director, working with Ian White's art direction.

There's an entertaining commentary with Branagh and Michael Caine that's at it's best when Ken quizzes him on the original film.

However, what we have here is a reconcpetualization, courtesy of Harold Pinter.  The key change is not simply updating Wyke's toys from games and puzzles to technology, but rather the way Pinter comes up with a totally new ""third"" act.

The point of reference for this movie should not be all of the remakes that Hollywood is infatuated with, but those rare reconceputaliations that are done for artistic rather than commercial reasons (the one that came to my mind the most while watching ""Sleuth"" was Akira Kurosawa's transformation of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Lear/dp/019832054X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Lear</a>"" into ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ran/dp/B000BB14YY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ran</a>"").  In that regard the key member of the production is not director Kenneth Brannagh but screenwriter Harold Pinter.  Getting Pinter to do this script was pivotal, because it is difficult to fault a Nobel Laureate when he wants to reimagine a script like this.  Plus, Pinter has a track record of transforming the works of others, proven once and for all time by his script for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-French-Lieutenant-s-Woman/dp/B00005LOKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The French Lieutenant's Woman</a>.""  If playwright Anthony Shaffer were still alive no doubt he would have recruited to update his play, but he passed away in 2001.  In that context getting Pinter (who had seen neither the play nor the movie) was a masterstroke).

I am not surprised that things have come full circle with Michael Caine now playing the Laurence Olivier role; we have seen such things before (e.g., Patty Duke going from playing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Helen-Keller/dp/B000056HEB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Helen Keller</a>&nbsp;to playing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie-Sullivan/dp/B0007YN268/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie Sullivan</a>&nbsp;in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Miracle-Worker/dp/0743457587/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Miracle Worker</a>.""  But while Caine's presence gives legitimacy to the proceedings and Jude Law's performance is as fine as anything he has done to date, this ""Sleuth"" is really Pinter's show.  Ultimately, I would maintain that this film is most decidedly not for those who have never seen the original because the ability to appreciate this ""Sleuth"" is predicated on your knowing the original story (notice that this time there are only names of two actors in the opening credits and not three).  The danger here is to be lulled by your familiarity with the story that you ignore the way Pinter has changed things up during the first two ""sets"" to up the ante for the fatal finale.  I still prefer the original as being one of the most effective twists I have seen in a movie (although I am sure it is much more effective on stage), but this one has its moments, most notably in the finale confrontation as Caine and Law engaged in the psychological duel that Pinter has crafted for them.

3305974,2,B001221DU6,"I don't know if I would go so far as to call the original film version of ""Sleuth"" a classic, but it is a darn good film and features virtuoso performances from Sir Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine.

Approximately a year ago, I heard of the plans to remake ""Sleuth"". Groan. Can't they at least try to come up with a new idea in Hollywood? Change the character's names and the title and call something it new? Why mess with a classic? Then, I remembered the original is a very good film, but not a classic. Michael Caine and Jude Law were signed to play the roles Olivier and Caine originated. This could be interesting. Michael Caine appearing in both versions? My interest was piqued. When I heard Kenneth Branagh was directing from a Harold Pinter screenplay, I was hooked.

The new version has some good things going for it, but the bad things far outweigh the good making ""Sleuth (2007)"" a disappointment.

Milo Tindle (Law), an out-of-work actor, arrives at the estate of Andrew Wyke (Caine), a hugely successful mystery novelist. Wyke has summoned the young man to discuss the affair he is having with his wife. Milo insists Wyke's wife is leaving him and Wyke is only too glad to let her go, he has a mistress of his own. But he wants the separation and divorce to be permanent; he doesn't want his ex-wife running back to him when Milo's money runs out. Wyke suggests Milo `break' into the house and steal some jewels worth One Million Pounds. Wyke has the name of a fence who will give Milo 800,000 pounds for the jewels and that should last them a while. Andrew has thought of everything. Milo agrees and Wyke uses his home's elaborate electronics and surveillance system to guide him through the process, to make it seem real. But it wouldn't seem real unless Wyke found the robber and defended his home would it?

""Sleuth"" originated as a play and it showcases two characters who play a game of verbal and psychological cat and mouse, sparring with one another, trying to gain the upper hand. In the new version, there are many changes, many of which benefit the overall film.

As Milo drives up to Wyke's house, Branagh introduces us to the elaborate security system the multi-millionaire has installed in his country estate. Milo's car triggers an alarm at the gate and his every move is caught on surveillance camera - there doesn't seem to be a centimeter of the expansive grounds he wouldn't be able to see on one of the system's surveillance screens.

As Milo attempts the `break-in', Wyke watches him every step of the way, directing him as he watches his adversary's every move. And Tindle gets caught up in the game, using his acting skills to become a `burglar'.

The new version of this film is about half as long as the original was. And this benefits the new film. Because of the length, the original version seems even more stagey; to watch two actors facing off against one another for the entire length of a film running about two and a half hours doesn't help the film escape its stage roots. The new version is about 90 minutes long allowing it to move at a faster clip, giving us less time to think about the fact we are simply watching two actors on screen the whole time.

It is also interesting to watch Caine take on the other role in the story. Michael Caine is one of the best actors of our time, but to see him play the other side of the coin provides for an interesting look at his career. He portrays Andrew Wyke in a suitably devious way. As the story progresses, we see shades of his anger, his relief, his amusement, all qualities we would expect to see in a famous mystery novelist.

And that is where the benefits of ""Sleuth (2007)"" end.

When Milo drives up to the large country estate, we expect the two actors to face off in a huge, expansive maze. The original film provided a huge country house for the two actors to chase each other through. Of course, this provides an advantage to Andrew (played by Olivier in the original) because he knows the various secrets of his expansive home. When Milo (Law) drives up to the estate in this new version, I had high hopes. It appears to be the exact same type of home. Then, he enters the house and we immediately see the hand of Andrew's wife in the ridiculous modern furniture and design. Initially, the house seems unusual and interesting. We soon realize the two actors are moving through a series of four rooms. What happened to the rest of the estate? This setting appears to be little more than a luxury apartment in some swank new building. It seems very small and claustrophobic. And very `play-like'.

For a while, the shorter length seems to benefit the film. But as Law's Milo Tindle becomes more engrossed in the story, the actor becomes less and less convincing. Law seems to think he needs to scream, shout and act like an actor in a horror film in order to get his character across, almost as though he is rushing through all of his character's emotions. You could put some orange glaze on Law and serve him at Easter dinner. His hammy performance is even more egregious when you watch him act with Caine. Caine is an accomplished actor and can make even the most over the top performance seem more natural. Andrew is an interesting character and Caine imbues him with calmness, making him more believable. Law, on the other hand, seems possessed by the devil as he grins maniacally and chews the scenery.

In the original, Tindle is a hairdresser, in this new version, an out-of-work actor. Yet, oddly, Wyke refers to the younger man as a hairdresser a few times. Is this a mistake? Did Pinter simply forget to replace all of the references to `hairdresser' when he copied the original script? Is this meant to be a put down?

If you are going to remake a well-known film, and rework the story, make sure it works. The beauty of the original is it is basically two stories and the two characters change their roles. In the first half, one man has the upper hand. In the second, the other does. In Pinter's version, one man has the upper hand. Then the other. Then later, the other regains the advantage. Oh, wait, maybe not. It goes back and forth, almost on a whim, and the game of cat and mouse loses focus and doesn't make sense. There is also a ludicrous plot development late in the story which does nothing to help Law's performance, only exaggerating all of the bad elements of his style.

""Sleuth (2007)"" is a big disappointment. Rent the original and watch two actors at the top of their game spar against one another.",1201046400,,6539,4.530508474576271

8243537,1,B001221DU6,"Review of Sleuth
Hot Toasty Rag, December 5, 2017

Besides the title, the name of the characters, and the first few minutes, the 2007 Sleuth is a completely different movie than the 1972 Sleuth. Widely touted as a remake, featuring a toe-to-toe between Alfie and Alfie, it really isn't a remake at all. Anyone who liked the original will detest this version, and vice versa.

On paper, its a great idea: Take the actor who played the younger part in the original Sleuth and cast him as the old man. Take the actor who remade Alfie and cast him opposite the actor who originated Alfie. How can that possibly go wrong? Two reasons: Harold Pinters screenplay and Kenneth Branaghs direction. Pinter bragged not only that hed never seen the original but that he didn't use a single line of dialogue from Anthony Shaffers play. Even the most innocuous plot descriptionone man invites a younger man over to his house for a drinkcant be said about the remake, because in this version, the younger man invites himself over. That tiniest detail makes all the difference to Anthony Shaffers original plot.

Kenneth Branagh has proved time and again he doesnt really understand the classics. Just take a look at what he did to Murder on the Orient Express. In his direction, he places the camera in areas he thinks will add to the mystery of the story and will put audiences on the edge of their seats. For example, the first few minutes are shown through a security camera. Neither of the leads faces are shown during their initial meeting, which, if shown and well-acted, would have added an extra depth to the story. He constantly places the camera in different parts of the minimalistic house, hoping that stripes along the wall, elongated mirrors, or birds eye views will make audiences think, Oo! Im confusednothings what it seems!

At first, I had my doubts about Michael Caine taking on Laurence Oliviers role, because he doesnt reek of wealth and cunning intelligence, as the role requires. He was perfect in the younger role, because audiences forever associate him with Alfie, the lovable Cockney ladies man. However, in the remake, the role is entirely different. Hes rich, but his house is minimalistic and modern, rather than opulent and obviously belonging to the family for generations. He isn't cunning, either, and the entire raison dtre of Laurence Oliviers characterhis need for mystery and gamesis replaced by homosexuality, in a cheap attempt to make audiences think the film is cutting edge.

Jude Laws character is also cut down and changed. His role is far more cunning than in the 1972 version, but hes also written to be quick-tempered, disgusting, and almost deranged. Hes a very handsome man, but for some reason, hes continually drawn to roles that make him either physically unattractive or so horrible on the inside that his outsides don't matter. If you happen to have a crush on Jude, you might not want to see him in this movie, as hes particularly creepy. This film actually gave me nightmares after I watched it.

Without giving anything away of the plot, Ill express one more concern with Pinters script. In Anthony Shaffers play, the older character has a particular motivation that in turn, once realized, motivates the entire rest of the story. The remake uses the original motivation, but the way in which its executed is reduced in length and emotional impact. Therefore, the rest of the story doesnt make any sense. I watched both versions of Sleuth on back-to-back evenings, and while I didn't like the first one, I was appalled by how much I hated the second.

Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to language and violence, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.
