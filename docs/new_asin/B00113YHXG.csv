3059744,4,B00113YHXG,"I was the first review for The Simpsons ""Songs in the Key of Springfield"" and, by Sweden, I'll be the first here.

I've pre-ordered this. I've seen all the episodes on the Television (in color!).  And I don't care if others find this useless. Indeed they should. Useful reviews of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job seem contradictory to the spirit of championing the mediocre and random liquids spewing forth gratuitously; angst; food! shopping! wait...

I want to live in T&E's world.

Their skits are odd and it someone else's hands might create some laughs, but these guys just don't deliver any. Being obscure and odd can be original and funny but Tom and Eric aren't funny. The skits are just pointless. I would give these episodes negative stars if I could.",1290297600,7,362,4.5
3059805,5,B00113YHXG,"Tim and Eric's absurd comedy is the most polarizing thing I've ever watched.  I've watched it with people and had them doubled-over in laughter, and watched it with people who just stared at the screen, mouth agape in confusion.  There isn't much middle ground.  You either get it and love it, or you don't.

I'm in the former camp.  I think it's some of the most adventurous, weird, and somewhat off-putting comedy I have ever seen.  It sometimes makes me cringe, and sometimes makes me scratch my head, but I'm always laughing.  Tim and Eric have somehow made an art out of the comedy of the cutting room floor.  It all looks spontaneous and random, but I feel like behind the scenes, there is a strict adherence to this aesthetic of making sure that their show always looks like amateur hour.  The quick cuts and the odd freeze frames only add to this feeling.  Still, despite how amateur it looks, it's clear that it's intentional and done for comic effect.

It's hard to compare them to any other comedy.  What they do is pretty unique, and hopefully they'll keep it up for a long time.",1287446400,6,1091,4.538461538461538

I mean Dr. Steve is the only thing I can think of as to why the ratings for this show get past 2 (Tim & Eric themselves)!

Hell even 12oz Mouse was better than this and it looked like a retarded kangaroo made it! I don't know anyone who likes this show and I hope I never do, because I will have to fight them to the death!!!! This show is not worth the film it was recorded on, and Tim & Eric should have no access to film equipment or recording devices of any kind! If they had to go audio, the album would be stupid noises of constipation and farts with their mouths, or high pitched squealing directly into the mic with mass feedback! Don't comics get booed off the stage for crap like this? Tom Goes to the Mayor was (almost) just as bad, however it had enough other star power to make me laugh once or twice (at the guest star, not T&E) that it almost balanced it out... Almost! these guys are not funny! They are GROSS! No one needs or should want to see the kind of sick images they come up with! If I met Tim and/or Eric I would run, not because of this review, but because I would be afraid they would sweat of drool on me! They look as if they would be very unclean and and disease carrying... NO THANKS!!!

And one more thing, it's not even a cartoon, at least Tom goes to the Mayor was un-animated stills!!! It's Cartoon Network!!! Remember? I can see it now, in five years there will be no cartoons on Cartoon Network, just like there is no music on M(usic)TV! It's not just the [Adult Swim] time slot ether! They play live action movies in the early evening too, and I think I even saw an ad for a live action show in the afternoon! There is no shortage of cartoons out there, so there is no excuse for live action on a network that used to be exclusively animated!

EDIT: Just as I feared there are now several more live action shows on [Adult Swim]: Look Around You, which was a British show poking fun at old educational series. The original British Office, with Ricky Gervais. Children's Hospital, which feels like a wanna be Scrubs (I think it's even the same hospital entrance used in Scrubs), with a bit more risque elements. Eagleheart which I haven't had a chance to see, but looks like a modern western comedy type thing. And NTSF:SD:SUV, which I also have not seen, but looks like a send-up of all the thousands of crime scene/police investigation shows that exist today. That's now a total of 6 live action shows on a network that used to be dedicated to cartoons only. I can only imagine what the daytime Cartoon Network lineup is like now days. Probably only 2 hours of cartoons left!",1285977600,3,4511,5.885496183206107

Now, to some people, this moves it into the land of funny.  I just find it unwatchable.

The entertainment value contained on this simple DVD could easily be appraised at many times the cost of the disk (and accompanied cover art and space-aged polymer container).

Most of us spend a lot of our lives watching television, its almost completely unredeemably artificial and crappy. This show pokes fun at it all. They manage to do it in an entertaining and humorous way not in a preachy or nasty way. Many people are unsettled by the material because its uncomformist and intentionally off key, I personally enjoy the change.
 The DVD doesnt get old the work is dense in a good way and new things appear in it on every rewatching. When I am watching some completely retarded infomercial or tv show on the tube. I sometimes just start laughing as I realize how absurd the whole thing is as something from Tim and Eric pops into my head.
 Some bits don't work 100% but I give them 5*'s anyway for putting it all out there.",1227398400,11,869,4.493670886075949
3059837,5,B00113YHXG,"These reviews are not divisive at all.  Pretty much everyone who rated it gave it 4 or 5 stars. I think Tim and Eric fall into the category not of ""love it or hate it"" , but ""gets it or doesn't get it"".  I see there is a wide range in the ages of the reviewers.  I'm 39 and my 10 year old son thinks its the best show on right now.  My 12 year old thinks its idiotic.

You have to be able to appreciate offbeat humor and obscure(make that VERY obscure) references to laugh at this.  My only gripe with the show is occasionally there will be what appears to be an inside joke thrown in. Not really fair to the rest of us, but, oh well.",1227139200,3,634,3.875968992248062

3059839,1,B00113YHXG,"First off, I thought Tom Goes To The Mayor was usually pretty funny if a bit on the screwy side. However Awesome Show is absolutely terrible.
I know that those that enjoy the show will hate this review, but it has to be written.
  I enjoy some ""off beat"" and ""out there"" shows, mostly on Adult Swim such as Frisky Dingo and Squidbillies. I have tried to find something, ANYTHING, worthwhile in this show and besides Dr. Steve Bruhl who is occasionally funny, this show is more of a look into the sick and twisted minds of these Tim and Eric guys than anything worth wasting your time on.
  If you are the type that enjoys seeing disgusting bits, skits that go nowhere and are hopelessly ADHD(every show has several points where they rewind,play,rewind,play,etc. for no apparent entertaining reason), enjoy. If you have an actual sense of humor and don't daydream about torturing animals, don't bother EVER buying this set, regardless of how cheap it gets.",1223251200,11,955,4.734939759036145

This show is so unique and im sick and tired of people hateing on it. You don't like it, go Watch George carlins videos in 2001. His comedy at that time is horrid. Anyway for cheap price ( i bought this at 12.99 at best buy) You cant go wrong for 1 hour and 50 min of greatness!!!! anyway a must buy no matter how crazy it is!",1216771200,5,493,3.94
3059842,5,B00113YHXG,"The scene cues and we are introduced into the blank stare of an awkward and uncomfortable looking doctor.  His ill prepared segment on fruit cannot start because, as the doctor tries to subtly inform his colleagues, he does not 'have the fruit'.  After several clumsy attempts by the camera operator to break the awkwardness of the situation, we catch the backside of a quickly moving production assistant dropping a bag of freshly purchased supermarket fruit in front of Mr. Brule.  It works.

Almost if by force of habit we expect a punch line at this point.  It doesn't come.  Our minds reel as the plot is pulled from beneath our taught fingers.  No climax, no story development, no comfort lead in music.  Shortly thereafter you realize you are only invited to participate in the haphazard denouement of this story - you are riding the thing down into the glorious and hilarious catastrophe that it was meant to be.

As we let the show aspirate, we can detect notes of dark comedy and satire on commonplace social norms.  The sketches are often full bodied and rely on tongue-in-cheek jabs at poorly executed social posturing (Strategies in Leadership, Carol and her Boss) or the miserable failings of those with little savvy (Casey and his Brother, Shopping Indoors).  This show is a big cab with strong hints of spite.  Good to enjoy now or a few years down the road.  Although much like a good bottle of Monty Python, Tim and Eric will only get better with age.  If neither suit your taste, I'm sure a bottle of Who's the Boss Zinfandel would suffice.

There's more than meets the eye with this show, if you know where to look.  Chances are, if you don't, Tim and Eric are probably making fun of you.",1215993600,28,1708,4.6433333333333335

I have seen pretty much every show Adult swim offers and at first I really disliked The Awesome Show, but after watching it a couple of times early in the morning it grew on me.

I showed my wife the show and she is has more mainstream tastes, but she thought it interesting in a quirky way.  The best description of the show is sort of a parody of local cable channels.

It is obviously not to everyone's liking probably not to most peoples liking, but that is not the point.  For instance someone referenced Wonder Showzen.  I cannot stand that show, but I like the Awesome Show and that is my opinion.

I really cannot put my finger on what is funny or interesting about it.  I guess it is the weird awkwardness of it all that I find most interesting.

Before buying I would definately head over to adult swim and watch of couple of clips to see if it interests you otherwise you may not know what you are getting yourself into.",1215734400,2,1096,4.328431372549019

3059857,5,B00113YHXG,"I can't remember the last time wrote a review on Amazon (if ever) during my many years of patronage, but when I saw ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job!"" on the site I was compelled to speak out! I am a graduate student in communication/film, and I recently wrote a paper titled ""The Postmodern Awesome Show"" on Tim and Eric. Without delving into theory, I want to say that I think this show is on the cutting edge.

The familiar structural and contextual elements are used with a greater intensity and new dynamism. Tim and Eric build with progressive elements as well. The humor materializes largely through parodic intertextual references to media culture undercurrents and artifacts of the technical apparatus. These references are often exceptionally subtle...more so than in other ""sketch comedy"" shows. The degree of intratextual reference is also greater. Sketches do not refer just to their counterparts in preceding episodes. All the sketches connect to each other through highly individualistic and tightly interwoven stylistic and thematic elements. Tim and Eric effectively move beyond the constraints of linear narrative imposed upon ""Tom Goes to the Mayor"" without losing cohesive vision and style.

""Awesome Show"" will not, of course, appeal to everyone. You probably need to have both a progressive, open mind and compatible predilections for comic irony and non sequitur. A diagnosis of ADHD and/or Schizophrenia from your psychiatrist may also predispose you to appreciate the show. Either way, ""Awesome Show"" may just blow your fancy.

You have to be a complete braindead moron to find any of this funny. Everything is shot in like superbright vhs type film that turns your eyes inside out and and your brain into oatmeal and NONE of it is funny. It seems like Tim and Eric didn't try at all, and adult swim didn't mind. I can't believe it's on dvd, i wouldn't watch it if they paid me.

3059859,1,B00113YHXG,"What can one say about a TV show whose main objective is to be as deliberately awful as possible, and that somehow is supposed to be brilliant comedy?  I was astonished at how truly awful this stuff is.  The only time I laughed out loud was when John C. Reilly showed up as Dr. Bruse.  Reilly is a very good actor, and it was the only time during the show that I actually laughed heartily.  If I was John's agent, I would recommend to him not to do this show anymore, as it belittles him as an actor and artist.  Fred Willard also shows up, and while I love Mr. Willard's work, he can't rescue the scene he's in, which is pretty lame.  The series isn't completely devoid of laughs, but aside from John Reilly's work, I laughed maybe 3 times during the whole season.  The series is more creepy than funny.

It's a pretty poor indication of a show's quality when the episodes are a mere 11 minutes long, and I kept checking the DVD to see when it was going to be over.  The eleven minutes seem longer than Gone With the Wind at times.  The targets of the satire seem to be local cable commercials, which are actually funnier than most of the stuff here.  The ""gravy robbers"" is one of the dumbest (not ""funny dumb"") sketches I ever saw.  The ""editing"", if one can call it that, is not done with any rhyme or reason, even in an artistic sense.  It's all just random, and it isn't funny or interesting.

This is not brilliant comedy, as some say here.  I'm getting really tired of people simply thinking since this show (and others of its ilk) polarise people, that automatically makes its art.  Some nimrod on IMDB actually compared this show to Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, in terms that when The Rite of Spring first appeared, the audience was shocked at the performance of it, and it split the audience.  The Rite of Spring is considering a masterpiece by most in classical musical circles, because of its use of twelve tone music and atonal shadings, which were unfamilar to audiences when the work premiered.  Tim and Eric is not on that level, nowhere close to it, and it's a deep insult to anyone who is familar with Stravinsky to actually compare the two.  A couple of rules of life...

1.  Just because something is controversial doesn't make it brilliant.
2.  Just because something isn't mainstream doesn't mean it's good.
3.  Just because something like this is weird doesn't make it good.
4.  Just because someone doesn't like this doesn't mean they watch  Friends or Two and a Half Men.
5.  Just because something polarises people doesn't make it art.

Some have said it's deliberately surreal, but it isn't.  It's just lazy and incoherent.  It has some similar qualities to MTV2's Wonder Showzen, except Wonder Showzen had some real creative transistions in the first season (the 2nd season wasn't as good...the drugs they took must have worn off).  I think many who think this show is some sort of misunderstood artistic masterpiece are just reading way too much into it, and it's the product of their own imaginations rather than any brilliance on the part of Tim and Eric.

I only managed to watch 9 episodes of this.  The 9th episode was so awful I literally could not watch the 10th one.  I felt disgusted by the mediocrity of it all.  Never before in my life have I sealed a Netflix envelope so quickly.  Do not waste your time.",1212796800,26,3350,4.5083056478405314

The menus keep up the ""public access"" theme, and there were quite a lot of extras. The commentary features a different actor or crew member, along with Tim and Eric, during each episode. The outtakes, deleted scenes, and ""making of"" were hysterical, letting you see how much work goes into making it look so cheap and awkward! They talked about many of the running jokes during the season, what they intended and if it worked or not, and generally gave a great look into the mind of the show, and it was many times as funny as the episodes themselves.

You may be asking what does this have to do with Tim and Eric Awesome show? Well aside from Bob Odenkirk and David Cross making appearances in it they also seemed to have helped Tim and Eric from the start before making it over to Adult Swim.

Now as far as Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! goes, it is definitely an aquired taste. Alot of the humor in it is quite bizarre, and to me sometimes falls flat. The sketches that are funny seem short while others that aren't seem to drag on.

Pierre is a classic character.  Just looking at him makes you want to laugh.  The ""Doo Dah Doo Doo"" song alone justifies the price of the DVD.  Brule's Rules and the Skyler married news team are also great.

(and not in a good way). if that's the idea, i wonder why they didn't do it once and get on with stuff that's awkward and uncomfortable *and* funny, because some of this stuff really is a complete waste. i like these guys (their guest spot on human giant's 24-hour takeover of mtv was amazing), and i certainly understand how they amassed such an impressive cast of guest stars like david cross, bob odenkirk and john c. reilly (whose repeat performances as dr. steve brule alone i find to be worth the price of admission), but i've got to think that anyone who thinks this show is PURE gold is giving them a lot of leeway. i'd be glad to own this collection (and i do have a birthday coming up... *hint* *hint*), but you can be sure i'll skip over chunks of it (stuff like the extreme hackey sack sample video on this very page, which is a great example of a sketch just not doing it for me) to get to the good stuff (like the aforementioned steve brule sketches and the ""doo da doo doo"" dance instruction tape where one of the dance steps is to think about your dad). my recommendation for the curious customer is to search for some tim and eric videos and judge for yourself.",1205107200,22,2249,4.421686746987952

I don't get why so many talented people are doing this show with these guys. Maybe Tim and Eric have things on them and are blackmailing them to be on the show so they don't make it public. Maybe it does well because most people up that late are drunken frat boys and potheads. Adult Swim is really going down the toilet lately. The only original shows that are still funny on there are Venture Brothers and Boondocks. This is where we're going it seems.

You either get it and love it, or you don't.

I'm in the former camp.  I think it's some of the most adventurous, weird, and somewhat off-putting comedy I have ever seen.  It sometimes makes me cringe, and sometimes makes me scratch my head, but I'm always laughing.  Tim and Eric have somehow made an art out of the comedy of the cutting room floor.  It all looks spontaneous and random, but I feel like behind the scenes, there is a strict adherence to this aesthetic of making sure that their show always looks like amateur hour.  The quick cuts and the odd freeze frames only add to this feeling.  Still, despite how amateur it looks, it's clear that it's intentional and done for comic effect.

Don't comics get booed off the stage for crap like this?

The original British Office, with Ricky Gervais. Children's Hospital, which feels like a wanna be Scrubs (I think it's even the same hospital entrance used in Scrubs), with a bit more risque elements. Eagleheart which I haven't had a chance to see, but looks like a modern western comedy type thing. And NTSF:SD:SUV, which I also have not seen, but looks like a send-up of all the thousands of crime scene/police investigation shows that exist today.

His ill prepared segment on fruit cannot start because, as the doctor tries to subtly inform his colleagues, he does not 'have the fruit'.  After several clumsy attempts by the camera operator to break the awkwardness of the situation, we catch the backside of a quickly moving production assistant dropping a bag of freshly purchased supermarket fruit in front of Mr. Brule.  It works.

Almost if by force of habit we expect a punch line at this point.  It doesn't come.  Our minds reel as the plot is pulled from beneath our taught fingers.  No climax, no story development, no comfort lead in music.  Shortly thereafter you realize you are only invited to participate in the haphazard denouement of this story - you are riding the thing down into the glorious and hilarious catastrophe that it was meant to be.

As we let the show aspirate, we can detect notes of dark comedy and satire on commonplace social norms.  The sketches are often full bodied and rely on tongue-in-cheek jabs at poorly executed social posturing (Strategies in Leadership, Carol and her Boss) or the miserable failings of those with little savvy (Casey and his Brother, Shopping Indoors).  This show is a big cab with strong hints of spite.  Good to enjoy now or a few years down the road.  Although much like a good bottle of Monty Python, Tim and Eric will only get better with age.  If neither suit your taste, I'm sure a bottle of Who's the Boss Zinfandel would suffice.

I showed my wife the show and she is has more mainstream tastes, but she thought it interesting in a quirky way.  The best description of the show is sort of a parody of local cable channels.

3294354,5,B00113YHXG,"I can't remember the last time wrote a review on Amazon (if ever) during my many years of patronage, but when I saw ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job!"" on the site I was compelled to speak out! I am a graduate student in communication/film, and I recently wrote a paper titled ""The Postmodern Awesome Show"" on Tim and Eric. Without delving into theory, I want to say that I think this show is on the cutting edge.

The familiar structural and contextual elements are used with a greater intensity and new dynamism. Tim and Eric build with progressive elements as well. The humor materializes largely through parodic intertextual references to media culture undercurrents and artifacts of the technical apparatus. These references are often exceptionally subtle...more so than in other ""sketch comedy"" shows. The degree of intratextual reference is also greater. Sketches do not refer just to their counterparts in preceding episodes. All the sketches connect to each other through highly individualistic and tightly interwoven stylistic and thematic elements. Tim and Eric effectively move beyond the constraints of linear narrative imposed upon ""Tom Goes to the Mayor"" without losing cohesive vision and style.

""Awesome Show"" will not, of course, appeal to everyone. You probably need to have both a progressive, open mind and compatible predilections for comic irony and non sequitur. A diagnosis of ADHD and/or Schizophrenia from your psychiatrist may also predispose you to appreciate the show. Either way, ""Awesome Show"" may just blow your fancy.

You have to be a complete braindead moron to find any of this funny. Everything is shot in like superbright vhs type film that turns your eyes inside out and and your brain into oatmeal and NONE of it is funny.

3294356,1,B00113YHXG,"What can one say about a TV show whose main objective is to be as deliberately awful as possible, and that somehow is supposed to be brilliant comedy?  I was astonished at how truly awful this stuff is.  The only time I laughed out loud was when John C. Reilly showed up as Dr. Bruse.  Reilly is a very good actor, and it was the only time during the show that I actually laughed heartily.  If I was John's agent, I would recommend to him not to do this show anymore, as it belittles him as an actor and artist.  Fred Willard also shows up, and while I love Mr. Willard's work, he can't rescue the scene he's in, which is pretty lame.  The series isn't completely devoid of laughs, but aside from John Reilly's work, I laughed maybe 3 times during the whole season.  The series is more creepy than funny.

It's a pretty poor indication of a show's quality when the episodes are a mere 11 minutes long, and I kept checking the DVD to see when it was going to be over.  The eleven minutes seem longer than Gone With the Wind at times.  The targets of the satire seem to be local cable commercials, which are actually funnier than most of the stuff here.  The ""gravy robbers"" is one of the dumbest (not ""funny dumb"") sketches I ever saw.  The ""editing"", if one can call it that, is not done with any rhyme or reason, even in an artistic sense.  It's all just random, and it isn't funny or interesting.

This is not brilliant comedy, as some say here.  I'm getting really tired of people simply thinking since this show (and others of its ilk) polarise people, that automatically makes its art.  Some nimrod on IMDB actually compared this show to Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, in terms that when The Rite of Spring first appeared, the audience was shocked at the performance of it, and it split the audience.  The Rite of Spring is considering a masterpiece by most in classical musical circles, because of its use of twelve tone music and atonal shadings, which were unfamilar to audiences when the work premiered.  Tim and Eric is not on that level, nowhere close to it, and it's a deep insult to anyone who is familar with Stravinsky to actually compare the two.  A couple of rules of life...

1.  Just because something is controversial doesn't make it brilliant.
2.  Just because something isn't mainstream doesn't mean it's good.
3.  Just because something like this is weird doesn't make it good.
4.  Just because someone doesn't like this doesn't mean they watch  Friends or Two and a Half Men.
5.  Just because something polarises people doesn't make it art.

Some have said it's deliberately surreal, but it isn't.  It's just lazy and incoherent.  It has some similar qualities to MTV2's Wonder Showzen, except Wonder Showzen had some real creative transistions in the first season (the 2nd season wasn't as good...the drugs they took must have worn off).  I think many who think this show is some sort of misunderstood artistic masterpiece are just reading way too much into it, and it's the product of their own imaginations rather than any brilliance on the part of Tim and Eric.

I only managed to watch 9 episodes of this.  The 9th episode was so awful I literally could not watch the 10th one.  I felt disgusted by the mediocrity of it all.  Never before in my life have I sealed a Netflix envelope so quickly.  Do not waste your time.",1212796800,26,3350,4.5083056478405314

The menus keep up the ""public access"" theme, and there were quite a lot of extras. The commentary features a different actor or crew member, along with Tim and Eric, during each episode. The outtakes, deleted scenes, and ""making of"" were hysterical, letting you see how much work goes into making it look so cheap and awkward! They talked about many of the running jokes during the season, what they intended and if it worked or not, and generally gave a great look into the mind of the show, and it was many times as funny as the episodes themselves. They included footage from Awesomecon as well, and overall you see how much they care about their fans, which is awesome. Great Job!",1212192000,3,857,4.3625

You may be asking what does this have to do with Tim and Eric Awesome show? Well aside from Bob Odenkirk and David Cross making appearances in it they also seemed to have helped Tim and Eric from the start before making it over to Adult Swim.

Now as far as Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! goes, it is definitely an aquired taste. Alot of the humor in it is quite bizarre, and to me sometimes falls flat. The sketches that are funny seem short while others that aren't seem to drag on.

While those 2 shows will having you laughing in stitches with their well written, plotted out, linked together sketches, T&E just seems random and inprovised, which sometimes works and sometimes fails.

If you liked Mr. Show, and especially if you thought Bob was better than David, Bob Odenkirk appears regularly throughout this disc.  He is hilarious every time.

Even thought this is sketch comedy, I would not describe it as hit or miss.

If I were to compare it to Mr. Show, I'd say the T&E skits are shorter and not as deeply thought out.  And, where Mr. Show had a lot more production value, T&E is geared more toward the Public Access/local TV look (and they pull it off perfectly).

Pierre is a classic character.  Just looking at him makes you want to laugh.  The ""Doo Dah Doo Doo"" song alone justifies the price of the DVD.  Brule's Rules and the Skyler married news team are also great.

This one is just bad. There's really no intended purpose to any of this. It's simply a mashing of incoherent and obscurely done live-action sketches without any jokes, and with attempts at humor which fail miserably.

(and not in a good way). if that's the idea, i wonder why they didn't do it once and get on with stuff that's awkward and uncomfortable *and* funny, because some of this stuff really is a complete waste. i like these guys (their guest spot on human giant's 24-hour takeover of mtv was amazing), and i certainly understand how they amassed such an impressive cast of guest stars like david cross, bob odenkirk and john c. reilly (whose repeat performances as dr. steve brule alone i find to be worth the price of admission), but i've got to think that anyone who thinks this show is PURE gold is giving them a lot of leeway. i'd be glad to own this collection (and i do have a birthday coming up... *hint* *hint*), but you can be sure i'll skip over chunks of it (stuff like the extreme hackey sack sample video on this very page, which is a great example of a sketch just not doing it for me) to get to the good stuff (like the aforementioned steve brule sketches and the ""doo da doo doo"" dance instruction tape where one of the dance steps is to think about your dad). my recommendation for the curious customer is to search for some tim and eric videos and judge for yourself.",1205107200,22,2249,4.421686746987952

This review got a lot of flack, and I can see why. I was a bit too harsh on what I said. I still don't like this show, but I don't think people are stupid because they enjoy the show. Humor is subjective, and what's funny for some won't be funny for others. And I understand what the creators are doing, and in that sense they do succeed. For me it doesn't work, but I can understand its popularity.

Just when I think people have sense and may be getting smarter [...]. There's nothing funny about the show, it's just creepy. I don't get why so many talented people are doing this show with these guys. Maybe Tim and Eric have things on them and are blackmailing them to be on the show so they don't make it public. Maybe it does well because most people up that late are drunken frat boys and potheads. Adult Swim is really going down the toilet lately. The only original shows that are still funny on there are Venture Brothers and Boondocks. This is where we're going it seems.
