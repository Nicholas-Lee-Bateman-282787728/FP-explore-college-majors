3118075,3,B0013MYNYI,"This was recommended to me by an acquaitance from England, where apparently this is quite big, so I gave it a try.

This is about the adventures of a group of girls at a VERY unconventional school as seen through the eyes of a newcomer as they struggle to fight off not only foreclosure by the local bank.  But instead of holding bake sales and other normal fund-raising activities, they decide to steal the famous painting ""Girl With Pearl Earring"" from the National Gallery and then sell it on the black market--like I said, this is a VERY unconventional school.

This film certainly shows off a different side of England than what people expect and for the most part it's good fun; my only real problem with it is that the girls suffer no real setbacks in their efforts, no ""raising of the stakes"", as it were.  But like I said, it's all good fun.",1261872000,16,850,4.464516129032258
3118076,5,B0013MYNYI,"An excellent comedic romp, through a very Politically Incorrect All Girls School, for very interesting ladies. This is very British in that it pokes fun at all the English Stereotypes. It shows what British Society is really like under the faade of enforced cultural requirements.",1258243200,4,280,5.2444444444444445
3118077,5,B0013MYNYI,"For those who haven't enjoyed the Searle cartoons of the early 1950s film with Alastrair Sim, this movie is a delight. In this day of Will Farrell stupidity and dumbing down, it's a treat to watch something whose humour may be unsubtle but is fun. Rupert Everette steals the show in his 2 roles. I never thought anyone after Sim could do this but he does with style. I'm not going to spoil the surprises thriugh the film. I watched it on Virgin coming back from one of my London trip and am sure I annoyed other passenegers with my laughing. Who cares! Get the DVD because a sequel is about to be released and maybe this time whatever idiot is in charge of international distribution will make sure it gets a wide US release. Movies like this make it worth looking into a region-free DVD player!",1255824000,35,795,4.414965986394558
3118078,4,B0013MYNYI,"This is not a high brow film.  It is pure sugar - not recommended as a daily diet but great as a sweet and silly snack.  The original version and sequels were very risque for its day and the remake does a good job of trying to update the movie without going overboard.

An English school that accepts those girls that have been thrown out of every other school is not only in financial trouble but the government means to make an example of them too.  All of the different factions (goths, sexpots, toughies, geeks, etc.) of St. Trinian band together to save the day?

Rupert Evertt does not do drag justice (which is amusing....) but all the  characters are fun to watch.  Colin Firth and Stephen Fry were especially great to watch.  There are a lot of talented UK actors who appear in this movie and then there is a brief scene by Misha Barton.

This movie has more of a cult following then strong comedy to recommend it.  It is being released in dvd in the U.S. January 2010.  The movie studio is hoping to cash in on teenagers but I'm not sure it will appeal to the masses.

It certainly is not worth the high price tag of third party sellers.  Wait for the US distribution and decide whether you are a fan or not.",1252886400,,1218,4.2894736842105265
3118079,4,B0013MYNYI,"Gone are the comedy antics of Alistair Sim and Joyce Grenfell, and in their place are poppers, Youtube and emo's.  This modern update on the familiar ""St. Trinian's"" characters (which is actually based on the first movie from the original series, 1954's ""The Belles of St. Trinian's"") is just as delightful and irreverent as the beloved movies which inspired it.

When Annabelle (Talulah Riley) is enrolled at St. Trinian's girls school, run by her aunt, Amelia Fritton (Rupert Everett), she has no idea of the ""education"" that will follow.  The future of the school is threatened, however, when the Minister of Education (Colin Firth)--who also happens to be one of Miss Fritton's former flames--announces plans to re-form the establishment; meanwhile, the bank managers are threatening to foreclose.  The girls hatch a daring plan to steal ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" from a London art gallery and demand a ransom...but they'll need all their cunning to pull off the grand heist...

Rupert Everett rises to the task of playing Miss Fritton (along with her brother, Carnaby) and delivers a strong comedy performance, matched step-for-step by Colin Firth who pokes good naturedly at his old ""Pride & Prejudice"" persona in one hilarious scene.  Russell Brand is the new incarnation of Flash Harry, and Gemma Arterton (""Lost in Austen"") is the head girl, Kelly.

It's never going to be in the same league or level of public adoration as the original film series, but ST. TRINIAN'S is a bold, colourful comedy romp that can be heartily enjoyed even if you haven't seen the previous titles.  The Blu-ray release (which is only encoded for Region B playback) includes behind-the-scenes footage, bloopers, music video for ""Girls Aloud"", and the trailer.  Recommended.",1252540800,,1761,5.129370629370629
3118080,3,B0013MYNYI,"This new St. Trinian's is not all bad, but as the title of this review says, I'm not sure it's worth spending the money to buy it.  I did, because I don't rent movies anymore and I have all the other St. Trinian's movies (the original 1950's ones -  Belles, Pure Hell, Blue Murder & Great Train Robbery) and this one does try to follow in the same vein as the originals - unfortunately, whilst sexual innuendo and nudity was shocking in the 50's, its pretty much par for the course now, so it doesn't really work.
Also, as much as I adore Rupert Everett, he just doesn't have it. He plays the dual roles of Miss Fritton, Headmistress of St. Trinian's girls school and her brother, a notorious art dealer.  The school is in financial ruin and so the girls hatch a plan to steal a valuable piece of art and sell it to Mr Fritton, using a school quiz show as a cover.
Rupert is in fine form and his understated portrayal of Miss Fritton is good, but he just doesn't come off as feminine as Alastair Sim did in the original.
However, this is more than made up for by Colin Firth, who shows his comedic talent is more than equal to his romantic, playing the Education Minister out to shut the school down (and former lover of Miss Fritton). He has some great moments and, if you like British actors, do keep your eye out for Stephen Fry, who is great as the slightly drunken quizmaster of the school quiz.
I'll be honest with you - I laughed at this movie in places (mostly at Colin Firth and Stephen Fry) but for most of it I just sat and watched. Then I watched the deleted scenes and thought how much more sense the movie would have made if they hadn't cut them out.
If you want to while away a few hours watching 16 year old girls in tight skirts and/or goth makeup and 14 year old girls making alcohol in the school chemistry lab, then rent this movie. You'll have a pleasant time and you won't be bored.
But please don't buy it - not even for Colin Firth and Stephen Fry.",1235952000,10,1972,4.225464190981432
3118081,5,B0013MYNYI,"I had watched the decades older 'Belles of St. Trinians' because Alistair Sim plays the dual role of Miss Fritton and her brother and he was very good. But it was the humor of a different age and a different culture and I didn't think it was very funny. I bought this one because Rupert Everett was playing the dual role and Colin Firth is always good in everything, so I was curious. What I wasn't prepared for was how funny this movie is. I laughed all the way through it. There are references to Colin Firth's legendary role in the 1995 version of Pride and Prejudice which caused millions of women in the UK and US to have an instant crush on him. There are even Stephen King influences. Rupert Everett seems to enjoy himself immensely and is believable as Miss Fritton. And there are so many British movie stars in this movie that is looks like they were falling over themselves to get a role in it: Anna Chancellor, Stephen Fry, Celia Imrie, Russell Brand, etc. What a treat to find this!

3118092,1,B0013MYNYI,"l bought this because of Lena Headey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones/dp/B00DY64CR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones</a>), who's also in one of my top five horror films of the aughts --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Broken/dp/B001P9N944/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Broken</a>. I needn't have bothered. Headey's few scenes amount to about 5 minutes of total screen time in St. Trinian's. So if you're a Headey fan, you'll be disappointed. (She's also in a few deleted scenes, included in the special features.)

Stephen Fry is hilarious in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Bit-of-Fry-and-Laurie/dp/B000P0J0G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Bit of Fry and Laurie</a>, but again, he's wasted in St. Trinian's. He plays a quiz show host. He plays it straight, the unfunny ""jokes"" going to the less talented lead cast. As with Headey, Fry's part is small in this film.

Colin Firth -- brilliant in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-s-Speech-Blu-ray/dp/B003UESJHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King's Speech [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tinker-Tailor-Soldier-Spy/dp/B007G5K066/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</a>&nbsp;-- is likewise wasted in St. Trinian's. Firth plays the new Minister of Education. As with Headey and Fry, Firth plays a straight man to the ""funny"" girls at St. Trinian's.

Except that the girls are NOT funny. They're the standard unoriginal stereotypes -- Geeks, Goths (though they prefer to be called Emos), Beauty Queens, etc. A large cast of no-name, UNFUNNY, UNTALENTED nobodies. The jokes are crude, flat, unoriginal, and mean-spirited. For instance, the New Girl has green goo dumped on her. So she takes a shower -- while a hidden camera records her in the nude and uploads it to YouTube. That's supposed to be hilarious, I guess.

There was a drunken headmistress, played by a man in drag. I suppose some people still think that's funny. I found the ""joke"" to be old, tired, unoriginal. A drunken drag queen slurring her speech? Ho-hum.

As usual, there's a ton of FAKE, PAID-FOR 5-star ""reviews"" for this DVD. It's hard to find a product on Amazon without a ton of fake reviews. Just look for the long list of 5-star reviews that are very brief, and usually just say ""Five Stars"" in the subject line. Fake reviews tend to be lazy.

3118097,5,B0013MYNYI,"Possibly relevant caveat: I originally happened upon this movie curious about Lily Cole's foray from modeling into acting and was unaware it was a remake of the 50's film ""The Belles of St. Trinians,"" which in turn was inspired by artist Ronald Searle. Therefore, this review will not take into consideration its capacity as a remake and modernization.  My five star rating is not to say this is a cinematic masterpiece worthy of an Oscar but  instead is a commentary on the execution of its intentions as a fun teen comedy with a side of caper heist. The movie makes no attempts to masquerade as high brow film making so if that is what you are looking for this movie would not be for you.  In the movie Annabelle Fritton, niece of headmistress Camilla Fritton, played by Rupert Everett in drag, is left by her father, also played by Rupert Everett, at a boarding school for misfits and mischief makers. Annabelle does not originally fit in with the rest of the school and looks upon them in snobbery and disdain. The supporting cast of ""tribe"" members play their parts well and Gemma Arterton is the perfect sultry Head Girl. Eventually the girls all band together in order to save the school from being foreclosed on and the day is saved in the same irreverent fun of the rest of the movie. The one liners are funny and the upbeat music fits perfectly with each scene. Best are the classic school girl uniforms that have been altered to reflect the originality of each tribe. Recommended for a good laugh with a surprising high profile cast including Lena Headey and Colin Firth.  While I am weary of the overused review of ""if you like x (movie, book) you will like y"" I will say that this movie is closest in vein to Wild Child, a somewhat similar dumped at an English boarding school rom-com that was released a year after St. Trinian's.",1447113600,,1843,4.575757575757576

3118112,3,B0013MYNYI,"St Trinians, a wicked British high school, thrives on calamity and outrageousness but its crazy ways have led to financial difficulty. The film plot centres on the efforts of all those involved with the school to devise a plan to pay off the schools bills, and the narrative achieves some laughs with its outlandishness. The storyline also at times suffers because of excessive silliness, but there are enough decent pranks and giggles to offset its shortcomings. The quality cast also adds some extra spark to the movie.

BUT, the film itself is an enjoyably silly, very English comedy...not an Oscar-caliber film by any means, but it's a fun film that may surprise you how enjoyable you may find it to be...I like the concept of an all-girl school populated by outcasts and a headmistress in drag, who fight to save their home/school when it's bankrupt and the government tries to shut em down...cuz where else are they gonna go??  The teachers are also inept, so same with them...who else would hire em??  I love the funny rapport between Rupert Everett (as Camilla, too funny but believable actually) and Colin Firth as Geoffrey...as well as Rupert as Camilla's swindler brother...another fun role/surprise is Russell Brand as bootlegger Flash Harry who teaches ""crime""...love how Paloma's Andrea freaks even him out with her over the top ideas...""cut off 'er ear""...and it's fun how they get Russell/Flash to play the role of a gay German art dealer to swindle Camilla's brother...lots of little plots adding up to the big plot.  I did feel bad about the dog though.  And Camilla's/Geoffrey's um, DUET, on John Paul Young's ""Love Is In The Air"" is just hilarious and fun.  Lastly, Girls Aloud's performance of the ""St Trinian's Theme"" rocks.

Now, I need to see ""St Trinian's 2: The Legend Of Fritton's Gold""...I see it affordably priced now...not only to see further adventures in the school and Camilla/Geoffrey, but Girls Aloud's Sarah Harding (the blonde) has a role in the film...she is an aspiring actress...wanna see how she is...AND I want to see the early films too.

3118157,4,B0013MYNYI,"St. Trinian's (2007) is an update of the old Belles of St. Trinian's films based on the cartoons of Ronald Searle.  Searle started drawing St. Trinian's girls after meeting a friend's sister and wondering what sort of school would produce her. The girls of St. Trinian's are the worst sort of troublemakers: the smart, inventive, motivated ones.

When Annabelle Fritton (Talulah Riley) is dropped off at St. Trinian's, she doesn't fit in.  Her aunt (Rupert Everett) might be the headmaster, but Annabelle is too uptight and law abiding to immediately bond with the girls.  But just as she begins to find a place for herself, the girls discover the new Minister of Education (Colin Firth) wants to shut the school down.  The only thing to do is cheat to win University Quiz and pull off an art heist.

This British cult comedy is absolutely hilarious.  I saw it with my dad and we were both cracking up.  I do recommend buying the DVD because the deleted scenes are pretty funny.  I see why some of them aren't in the final cut, but others I would've kept in the film.  I can honestly say that St. Trinian's is the only movie I've seen that made me laugh at someone kicking a dog.

The cast is essential to selling the black comedy.  Head Girl Kelly Jones was Gemma Arterton's (Quantum of Solace) breakout role.  Juno Temple is a rising indie star.  Jodie Whittaker (Attack the Block) plays an utterly incompetent school secretary.  Rupert Everett is unrecognizable as both Camilla and Carnaby Fritton.  (St. Trinian's does its part to keep the British drag tradition alive.)  Lena Headley (Game of Thrones, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles) is also unrecognizable as a mild-mannered teacher until she shows her St. Trinian's mettle during the climax.

Colin Firth, usually the dashing hero, does quite well as the hapless villain.  Plus, his presence allows for a number of Pride & Prejudice jokes.  (Three of the actresses have also appeared in P&P adaptations.)  But his star power never outshines the large female cast, which is only fitting.  Whenever they're onscreen, the girls of St. Trinian's steal the show.

If you're in the mood for a comedy, I recommend picking up a copy of St. Trinian's.  Now if only I could find the sequel for less than $25.

Another thing to recommend it?  The terrific pop soundtrack, which includes the theme ""Defenders of Anarchy"" by Girls Aloud.",1339977600,2,2390,4.8108108108108105

Stern) and the direction is shared (Oliver Parker and Barnaby Thompson).

St Trinian's is 'school' for dysfunctional girls (nerd to goth) run by a wild headmistress Camilla Fritton (Rupert Everett in bucktoothed drag plus fuddy English gent's clothes as Carnaby Fritton).  The school is a major disaster zone and one Geoffrey Thwaites (Colin Firth) is sent to correct the issues.  The threat of bankruptcy spins its own dire consequences and the 'inmates' of the school find a way to correct that.

The major surprise is not in the plot but instead in the fact that some of Britain's finest actors agreed to participate in this mess: Rupert Everett, Colin Firth, Lena Headey, Toby Jones, Anna Chancellor, Celia Imre, etc etc could have their choice of about any film casting and win Oscars and kudos instead of boodos.

dear fans of the weird and bizarre,
.... it is about a girl's school for young ladies that just can't quite fit into any other school, run by teachers who are even more dodgy. The school is in trouble with the board of education and the Inland Revenue (IRS) and the film centers on the less than legal, but very clever way, they seek to solve these difficulties. Anarchy rules ST. Trinian's in the form of Miss Fritton, the head mistress in every sense of the word, who loves her school, and her girls and is determined to prepare them for life and success in a hard, cold world. All this is complicated by the arrival of Miss Fritton's niece who is certain she belongs elsewhere and doesn't realize at first that elsewhere is exactly where she's arrived.

St. Trinian's movies from the late '50's / early

a lot of trepidation.  I was honestly expecting a
bastardization of Ronald Searle's notorious school
for young ladies, but truth be told, I found this
very enjoyable and quite in keeping with the madcap
comic tone of the earlier films. In fact, it plays
less like a remake and more of a continuation of
the series. I expected Rupert Everett to be funnier
in drag (as Headmistress Fritton) even though his
performance eventually grew on me.  Alastair Sim's
performance(in the original) was hilarious.  Colin
Firth does his usual steller job, even though he's
playing an unsympathetic character.  There are a
few referances to his 'Pride and Prejudice' heart-
throb status - like his emerging out of fountain
in a wet shirt, and having his leg humped by a dog
named Mr. Darcy.  Russell Brand - a comedian I've
always had a certain repugnance for - actually made
a very effective Flash Harry, the iconic character
originated by George Cole and who's turned up in all
but one of the St. Trinian films.  The young ladies
are a mixed bunch, but all are attractive. (How cute
is Lily Cole as computer geek Polly?)  The U.S. DVD

3118179,3,B0013MYNYI,"Rupert Everett's goofily winning dual performance- as slimy art dealer Carnaby Fritton and as his twin sister Headmistress Camilla Fritton- is the only high point in an otherwise thoroughly forgettable film.

St. Trinian's (""like Hogwart's for pikeys""), is failing. Half a million pounds in debt and the prime target of the new Minister of Education (Firth) and his crusade to clean up England's schools, the girls must put aside their differences to save their school or else risk going to a 'normal' school. This move would surely negatively impact their bootleg vodka and designer tampon businesses.

The problems begin with the script; populated by poorly sketched characters and a story that stirs few emotions. The primary mistake is simply the attempt to cram too much into this feeble frame. The 'belles' of St. Trinian's are divided into stereotypical (and tired) cliques, but beyond the obvious superficial differences, these groups are basically interchangeable and provide very few surprises.

The various female leads are solid, but unremarkable. Gemma Arterton is a lone stand out- she exudes a smoky, dangerous and clever sex appeal.

There is a lack of memorable sequences and a number that fall flat due to sub-par direction and/or editing. One brief sequence early in the film involves the new girl being tarred and feathered, however, it is so poorly edited, I momentarily thought I was watching a montage of several mornings' worth of hazing.

Cameos by Stephen Fry and Russell Brand add little and are not as funny as the film believes them to be.

There is one bright point in an unexpected little twist in the ""Ocean's Eleven""-inspired heist subplot but it does not redeem this limp and tepid entry.

If you are NOT a fan of British entertainment, you may find much of the dialogue incomprehensible as the accents combine with slang. If you ARE a fan of British entertainment, you may not be amused by the film's focus on 'gross' humor and weak attempts at edginess.",1264636800,,1989,5.009090909090909

""St. Trinian's"", the fictional girls boarding school created by English cartoonist Ronald Searle and spawned several books in the late 40's and early 50's,  five comedy films from the early 1950's through the 1980's and now a reboot in 2007.  The film which cost around 7 million to make, earned over 12 million in the UK but is among the top grossing independent British films made and one of the top selling DVD's in the UK in 2008.

The film had a brief run in the US in Oct. 2009 to help generate interest in the second film ""St. Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold"" which was released in theaters in the UK in Dec. 2009 and now a US DVD release of the first film in Jan. 2010.

In this reboot, St. Trinian's: School for Bad Girls features an all-star cast from the UK.  Starring Rupert Everett (Stardust, Shakespeare in Love, Inspector Gadget), Colin Firth (Mamma Mia!, Bridget Jones's Diary), Lena Headey (""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles,"" Vacancy), comedian Russell Brand (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) and Caterina Murino (Casino Royale). Also starring Mischa Barton (""The O.C.,"" ""The Beautiful Life""), Talulah Riley (The Boat That Rocked) and Gemma Arterton (Quantum of Solace, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time), with a cameo appearance by U.K. sensation GIRLS ALOUD.

The school which had been depicted as the girl school where the bad girls attend.  In the original films, these female students were daughters of gangsters, crooks and shady bookmakers.  But in the 2007 revision, the students are broken down to groups from the Chavs, the Posh Totty's, Geeks, Emo's and the first years.

""St. Trinian's: School for Bad Girls"" revolves around Annabelle Fritton (played by Talulah Riley), daughter of Carnaby Fritton (played by Rupert Everett) who has left her previous school and will attend the school which is headed by her aunt Camilla Fritton (also played by Rupert Everett).  Carnaby leaves his daughter at the school but to find out that St. Trinian's is behind on payments and if they don't pay their bill, the school will be foreclosed.  But Camilla tends to not bother with the collection notices.

As for Annabelle, she  immediately sees that the school is quite unkempt and their students are a bit different from her previous school.  She is given an introduction by head student, Kelly (played by Gemma Arterton) and is introduced to various groups in the school and also receives an initiation of sorts when she has goo dropped on her head and feathers stuck all over her.  To make things worse, while she takes a shower, the girls at school stream her shower through YouTube and steal all her clothing.  Immediately, Annabelle wants out of the school and tries to call her father to get her out to no avail.  She must stay.

We see how education is done at the school of St. Trinian's.  The school tries to make lab-made vodka and have their teacher Flash Harry (played by Russell Brand) sell it for them to make a profit, foreign language teacher Miss Maupassant (played by Caterina Murino) can be seen teaching wearing S&M tight leather clothing and a whip, one teacher for art class who uses his body to pose in the nude for his students, another who teaches students how to fire weapons and possibly, the most sane teacher is the new teacher Miss Dickinson (played by Lena Headey) who was just hired.  And a former head student turned PR guru JJ French (played by Mischa Barton) who teaches the Posh Totty girls on how to look smart.

Needless to say that the school has a bad reputation and thus education minister Geoffrey Thwaites (played by Colin Firth) wants to use St. Trinian as an example to raise the standards for other schools and will do what he can to make the country know how bad of a school St. Trinian's truly is.

Meanwhile, the collectors have given St. Trinian's a few weeks to come up with their payment or else the school will be shut down.  Fearing that they will have to go to a normal school, the students of St. Trinian's come up with a plan to pull of a major heist and sell the painting in order to get the money to pay the collectors with the support of the school's owner Ms. Fritton.  Will they be able to pull it off?

The main students featured on ""St. Trinian's"" are:

  * Annabelle Fritton (played by Talulah Riley, ""Pride and Prejudice"", ""Doctor Who"", ""The Summer House) - A normal student who can't understand why her father sent her to St. Trinian's.  Daughter of Carnaby Fritton.  She slowly becomes one of the girl's at St. Trinian and goes through a major makeover in the first film.
  * Kelly (played by Gemma Arterton, ""Prince of Persia: Sands of Time"", ""Quantum of Solace"", ""Clash of the Titans"") - The head student and all students listen to whatever she says.
  * Taylor (played by Kathryn Drysdale) - The student most likely to get in your face.  An aggressive student and part of the Chav's.
  * Celia (played by Juno Temple, ""Year One"", ""Atonement"") - Part of the Chav's who uses her Internet instinct to help out the Posh-Totty's and has a weird hairdo.
  * Tara and Tania (played by Holly and Cloe Mackie) - The Soprano-like twins of the group ""First Years"".  These girls are very smart when creating things in the lab, making of explosives and more.
  * Polly (played by Lily Cole, ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"") - Polly is the top of the geeks at St. Trinian's.  A hacker and gifted computer genius.
  * Andrea (played by Paloma Faith, ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"") - Andrea is a member of the Emo's.
  * Chloe (played by Antonia Bernath), Chelsea (played by Tamsin Egerton) and Peaches (played by Amara Karan) - Chloe, Chelsea and Peaches are members of the Posh Totty's.  The fashionably, spoiled rich students.
  * Beverly (played by Jodie Whitaker, ""Wish 143', ""White Wedding"") - The secretary of St. Trinian's and knows how students and faculty can get a buzz.

JUDGMENT CALL:

This movie is definitely not your parent's ""St. Trinian's"" that they grew up with watching when they were younger, this 2007 reboot is a whole new comedy sporting an all-star case featuring on a new group of bad girls of today's generation of Internet users, member of a school click...may they be a geek, emo, chav or posh.  ""St. Trinian's: School for Bad Girls"" is much more rude, crude but depending on your sense of humor, you may find it quite entertaining in an unusual way.

Despite the negative critic reviews the film has received, the fact that the independent film has done well in the box office and it has done well in DVD sales in the UK, now has a sequel with talks of a third film being made, definitely shows you how this film has amassed a cult following.  Intriguing as well as the actresses who have gone on to bigger projects since the making of the first film, most have all returned for the sequel as well.

At first, I was sort of expecting something a film along the same style of the original 1954 film ""The Belles of St. Trinian's"" but with a twist and more modern but what we got is a more, girl-power driven comedy utilizing a more modern feel of today's generation, working together for the greater good for their school in the most obnoxious, crazy, campy but yet hilarious kind of way.

Similar to the original film which had Alastair Sim playing both the headmistress and her brother, Rupert Everett takes on the role of Camilla and Carnaby Fritton.  For the most part, it was a bit scary at first to see Rupert in drag but for the most part but you kind of ease into the role because the film is quite campy but yet funny.  Colin Firth as usual, very good with his deadpan humor.

Those who wonder about the top billing of other well-known talents such as Lena Heady, Russell Brand and Mischa Barton, its important to emphasize that the main talents are the students themselves, especially Talulah Riley and Gemma Arterton.  Brand is featured a good number of times throughout the film, with Heady in second (has quite a few scenes that were cut and are on the deleted scenes) and Barton's role lasts around under two minutes.  So, for ""The O.C."" fans wondering if Barton plays one of the main students in the film, she's doesn't.  And why she is receiving top billing on the DVD, I'm guessing it is to attract American fans who may not be familiar with any of the UK talent.

""St. Trinian's: School for Bad Girls"" is not a a great film nor is it a bonafide stinker.  It's all about one's humor and their sensibilities.  This is not a politically correct film nor should those who enjoyed the original films, look for anything close to it.  Personally, I think some going to the film to see something close to the original may find the campiness and ridiculous gags a bit too much for them but for some with an open mind to the film's style of comedy, you can find some enjoyment because it is so unusual and crazy. And personally, I feel that Happy Madison or Apatow-related films have made me a bit more lenient towards these types of comedy related films and by the end of ""St. Trinian's"", I was content by it.  I found it to be a wild, crazy and fun film!

Parents who have seen trailers of the film and saw many children on it, don't be fooled.  This is not a kid's film, thus the PG-13 rating.  In fact, these younger kids in the film are making vodka and other unusual concoctions in their lab, using explosives and up to some kind of trouble.

As for those who are wondering about the ""girl power"" theme, it's nothing like ""Mean Girls"" of one trying to achieve popularity.  These girls are the outcasts of their school and find solace at St. Trinian's because they feel like they belong.  Sure, they may be amongst a group of troublemakers or depressed individuals but they enjoy being at that school and thus, the will do what they can to fight for their school.  I think the lyrics to the theme by Girls Aloud describes these girls in the best manner:  We are the Best.  So screw the rest.  We do as we damn well please!  Until the end...  St. Trinian's.  Defenders of anarchy!

As for the DVD, it's cool that there are a good amount of special features included.  I will say that there are some scenes that were included in the deleted scenes of the DVD that I wish was included in the final cut of the film.  I'm guessing that the filmmakers tried to get the duration down to 100 minutes and it is essentially the reason why there are so many deleted scenes (19) included on the DVD.

Overall, ""St. Trinian's: School for Bad Girls"" is a film that can appease the teenage girls with its ""girl power"" theme, especially the young Internet generation who are on YouTube digs music from Girls Aloud or a member of a certain type of school click. For the guys, seeing girls being bad or girls in their bra and panties with fishnet stockings are probably going to catch their attention and for the grownups, the cast which has a good share of older and younger talent is going to attract their attention, especially those who are curious about how different this film is from the original.

Again, this film is not going to be for everyone.  Some may find the film too over-the-top, boorish, crude and all out ridiculous, while others may find it as an enjoyable 101-minute popcorn flick with wild and crazy British humor.  If you are part of the latter, then definitely give ""St. Trinian's: School for Bad Girls"" a try, you may very well enjoy it!",1264464000,10,12981,4.623251748251748
3118181,5,B0013MYNYI,"Ok, we aren't talking Shakespeare here. The comedy is broad and a little crass BUT it's done so well and with such a sense of fun that you're drawn into it for an enjoyable romp. Rupert Everett handles the Miss Fritton role just as well as Alastair Sim over 50 years earlier.

Rupert Evertt does not do drag justice (which is amusing....) but all the characters are fun to watch. Colin Firth and Stephen Fry (brief cameo) were my favorites to watch. There are a lot of talented UK actors who appear in this movie and then there is a scene by Misha Barton.

3352572,3,B0013MYNYI,"This was recommended to me by an acquaitance from England, where apparently this is quite big, so I gave it a try.

This is about the adventures of a group of girls at a VERY unconventional school as seen through the eyes of a newcomer as they struggle to fight off not only foreclosure by the local bank.  But instead of holding bake sales and other normal fund-raising activities, they decide to steal the famous painting ""Girl With Pearl Earring"" from the National Gallery and then sell it on the black market--like I said, this is a VERY unconventional school.

This film certainly shows off a different side of England than what people expect and for the most part it's good fun; my only real problem with it is that the girls suffer no real setbacks in their efforts, no ""raising of the stakes"", as it were.

I never thought anyone after Sim could do this but he does with style. I'm not going to spoil the surprises thriugh the film. I watched it on Virgin coming back from one of my London trip and am sure I annoyed other passenegers with my laughing. Who cares!

3352576,4,B0013MYNYI,"Gone are the comedy antics of Alistair Sim and Joyce Grenfell, and in their place are poppers, Youtube and emo's.  This modern update on the familiar ""St. Trinian's"" characters (which is actually based on the first movie from the original series, 1954's ""The Belles of St. Trinian's"") is just as delightful and irreverent as the beloved movies which inspired it.

When Annabelle (Talulah Riley) is enrolled at St. Trinian's girls school, run by her aunt, Amelia Fritton (Rupert Everett), she has no idea of the ""education"" that will follow.  The future of the school is threatened, however, when the Minister of Education (Colin Firth)--who also happens to be one of Miss Fritton's former flames--announces plans to re-form the establishment; meanwhile, the bank managers are threatening to foreclose.  The girls hatch a daring plan to steal ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" from a London art gallery and demand a ransom...but they'll need all their cunning to pull off the grand heist...

Rupert Everett rises to the task of playing Miss Fritton (along with her brother, Carnaby) and delivers a strong comedy performance, matched step-for-step by Colin Firth who pokes good naturedly at his old ""Pride & Prejudice"" persona in one hilarious scene.  Russell Brand is the new incarnation of Flash Harry, and Gemma Arterton (""Lost in Austen"") is the head girl, Kelly.

It's never going to be in the same league or level of public adoration as the original film series, but ST. TRINIAN'S is a bold, colourful comedy romp that can be heartily enjoyed even if you haven't seen the previous titles.  The Blu-ray release (which is only encoded for Region B playback) includes behind-the-scenes footage, bloopers, music video for ""Girls Aloud"", and the trailer.  Recommended.",1252540800,,1761,5.129370629370629
3352577,3,B0013MYNYI,"This new St. Trinian's is not all bad, but as the title of this review says, I'm not sure it's worth spending the money to buy it.  I did, because I don't rent movies anymore and I have all the other St. Trinian's movies (the original 1950's ones -  Belles, Pure Hell, Blue Murder & Great Train Robbery) and this one does try to follow in the same vein as the originals - unfortunately, whilst sexual innuendo and nudity was shocking in the 50's, its pretty much par for the course now, so it doesn't really work.
Also, as much as I adore Rupert Everett, he just doesn't have it. He plays the dual roles of Miss Fritton, Headmistress of St. Trinian's girls school and her brother, a notorious art dealer.  The school is in financial ruin and so the girls hatch a plan to steal a valuable piece of art and sell it to Mr Fritton, using a school quiz show as a cover.
Rupert is in fine form and his understated portrayal of Miss Fritton is good, but he just doesn't come off as feminine as Alastair Sim did in the original.
However, this is more than made up for by Colin Firth, who shows his comedic talent is more than equal to his romantic, playing the Education Minister out to shut the school down (and former lover of Miss Fritton). He has some great moments and, if you like British actors, do keep your eye out for Stephen Fry, who is great as the slightly drunken quizmaster of the school quiz.
I'll be honest with you - I laughed at this movie in places (mostly at Colin Firth and Stephen Fry) but for most of it I just sat and watched. Then I watched the deleted scenes and thought how much more sense the movie would have made if they hadn't cut them out.
If you want to while away a few hours watching 16 year old girls in tight skirts and/or goth makeup and 14 year old girls making alcohol in the school chemistry lab, then rent this movie. You'll have a pleasant time and you won't be bored.

I bought this one because Rupert Everett was playing the dual role and Colin Firth is always good in everything, so I was curious. What I wasn't prepared for was how funny this movie is. I laughed all the way through it. There are references to Colin Firth's legendary role in the 1995 version of Pride and Prejudice which caused millions of women in the UK and US to have an instant crush on him. There are even Stephen King influences. Rupert Everett seems to enjoy himself immensely and is believable as Miss Fritton.

I needn't have bothered. Headey's few scenes amount to about 5 minutes of total screen time in St. Trinian's. So if you're a Headey fan, you'll be disappointed. (She's also in a few deleted scenes, included in the special features.)

Stephen Fry is hilarious in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Bit-of-Fry-and-Laurie/dp/B000P0J0G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Bit of Fry and Laurie</a>, but again, he's wasted in St. Trinian's.

Firth plays the new Minister of Education. As with Headey and Fry, Firth plays a straight man to the ""funny"" girls at St. Trinian's.

Except that the girls are NOT funny. They're the standard unoriginal stereotypes -- Geeks, Goths (though they prefer to be called Emos), Beauty Queens, etc. A large cast of no-name, UNFUNNY, UNTALENTED nobodies. The jokes are crude, flat, unoriginal, and mean-spirited. For instance, the New Girl has green goo dumped on her. So she takes a shower -- while a hidden camera records her in the nude and uploads it to YouTube. That's supposed to be hilarious, I guess.

There was a drunken headmistress, played by a man in drag. I suppose some people still think that's funny. I found the ""joke"" to be old, tired, unoriginal. A drunken drag queen slurring her speech? Ho-hum.

As usual, there's a ton of FAKE, PAID-FOR 5-star ""reviews"" for this DVD. It's hard to find a product on Amazon without a ton of fake reviews. Just look for the long list of 5-star reviews that are very brief, and usually just say ""Five Stars"" in the subject line. Fake reviews tend to be lazy.

3352594,5,B0013MYNYI,"Possibly relevant caveat: I originally happened upon this movie curious about Lily Cole's foray from modeling into acting and was unaware it was a remake of the 50's film ""The Belles of St. Trinians,"" which in turn was inspired by artist Ronald Searle. Therefore, this review will not take into consideration its capacity as a remake and modernization.  My five star rating is not to say this is a cinematic masterpiece worthy of an Oscar but  instead is a commentary on the execution of its intentions as a fun teen comedy with a side of caper heist. The movie makes no attempts to masquerade as high brow film making so if that is what you are looking for this movie would not be for you.  In the movie Annabelle Fritton, niece of headmistress Camilla Fritton, played by Rupert Everett in drag, is left by her father, also played by Rupert Everett, at a boarding school for misfits and mischief makers. Annabelle does not originally fit in with the rest of the school and looks upon them in snobbery and disdain. The supporting cast of ""tribe"" members play their parts well and Gemma Arterton is the perfect sultry Head Girl. Eventually the girls all band together in order to save the school from being foreclosed on and the day is saved in the same irreverent fun of the rest of the movie. The one liners are funny and the upbeat music fits perfectly with each scene. Best are the classic school girl uniforms that have been altered to reflect the originality of each tribe. Recommended for a good laugh with a surprising high profile cast including Lena Headey and Colin Firth.  While I am weary of the overused review of ""if you like x (movie, book) you will like y"" I will say that this movie is closest in vein to Wild Child, a somewhat similar dumped at an English boarding school rom-com that was released a year after St. Trinian's.",1447113600,,1843,4.575757575757576

3352609,3,B0013MYNYI,"St Trinians, a wicked British high school, thrives on calamity and outrageousness but its crazy ways have led to financial difficulty. The film plot centres on the efforts of all those involved with the school to devise a plan to pay off the schools bills, and the narrative achieves some laughs with its outlandishness. The storyline also at times suffers because of excessive silliness, but there are enough decent pranks and giggles to offset its shortcomings. The quality cast also adds some extra spark to the movie.

3352643,5,B0013MYNYI,"That is true...the movie came and went from US theatres in a flash, or it didn't enter at all, and went straight to DVD in the US, which made me happy, as it's the only US release Girls Aloud are on...best girlgroup EVER, in my humble opinion...as well as Paloma Faith, the theatrical Brit soul/pop siren who's profile is rising in the US on her 2nd album ""Fall Into Grace"" on Epic...she's also an actress and plays Goth Andrea in the film.

BUT, the film itself is an enjoyably silly, very English comedy...not an Oscar-caliber film by any means, but it's a fun film that may surprise you how enjoyable you may find it to be...I like the concept of an all-girl school populated by outcasts and a headmistress in drag, who fight to save their home/school when it's bankrupt and the government tries to shut em down...cuz where else are they gonna go??  The teachers are also inept, so same with them...who else would hire em??  I love the funny rapport between Rupert Everett (as Camilla, too funny but believable actually) and Colin Firth as Geoffrey...as well as Rupert as Camilla's swindler brother...another fun role/surprise is Russell Brand as bootlegger Flash Harry who teaches ""crime""...love how Paloma's Andrea freaks even him out with her over the top ideas...""cut off 'er ear""...and it's fun how they get Russell/Flash to play the role of a gay German art dealer to swindle Camilla's brother...lots of little plots adding up to the big plot.  I did feel bad about the dog though.  And Camilla's/Geoffrey's um, DUET, on John Paul Young's ""Love Is In The Air"" is just hilarious and fun.  Lastly, Girls Aloud's performance of the ""St Trinian's Theme"" rocks.

Now, I need to see ""St Trinian's 2: The Legend Of Fritton's Gold""...I see it affordably priced now...not only to see further adventures in the school and Camilla/Geoffrey, but Girls Aloud's Sarah Harding (the blonde) has a role in the film...she is an aspiring actress...wanna see how she is...AND I want to see the early films too.

3352654,4,B0013MYNYI,"St. Trinian's (2007) is an update of the old Belles of St. Trinian's films based on the cartoons of Ronald Searle.  Searle started drawing St. Trinian's girls after meeting a friend's sister and wondering what sort of school would produce her. The girls of St. Trinian's are the worst sort of troublemakers: the smart, inventive, motivated ones.

When Annabelle Fritton (Talulah Riley) is dropped off at St. Trinian's, she doesn't fit in.  Her aunt (Rupert Everett) might be the headmaster, but Annabelle is too uptight and law abiding to immediately bond with the girls.  But just as she begins to find a place for herself, the girls discover the new Minister of Education (Colin Firth) wants to shut the school down.  The only thing to do is cheat to win University Quiz and pull off an art heist.

This British cult comedy is absolutely hilarious.  I saw it with my dad and we were both cracking up.  I do recommend buying the DVD because the deleted scenes are pretty funny.  I see why some of them aren't in the final cut, but others I would've kept in the film.  I can honestly say that St. Trinian's is the only movie I've seen that made me laugh at someone kicking a dog.

The cast is essential to selling the black comedy.  Head Girl Kelly Jones was Gemma Arterton's (Quantum of Solace) breakout role.  Juno Temple is a rising indie star.  Jodie Whittaker (Attack the Block) plays an utterly incompetent school secretary.  Rupert Everett is unrecognizable as both Camilla and Carnaby Fritton.  (St. Trinian's does its part to keep the British drag tradition alive.)  Lena Headley (Game of Thrones, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles) is also unrecognizable as a mild-mannered teacher until she shows her St. Trinian's mettle during the climax.

Colin Firth, usually the dashing hero, does quite well as the hapless villain.  Plus, his presence allows for a number of Pride & Prejudice jokes.  (Three of the actresses have also appeared in P&P adaptations.)  But his star power never outshines the large female cast, which is only fitting.  Whenever they're onscreen, the girls of St. Trinian's steal the show.

If you're in the mood for a comedy, I recommend picking up a copy of St. Trinian's.  Now if only I could find the sequel for less than $25.

Another thing to recommend it?  The terrific pop soundtrack, which includes the theme ""Defenders of Anarchy"" by Girls Aloud.",1339977600,2,2390,4.8108108108108105

While it IS decent enough, this movie doesn't quite have enough of the over-the-top aspects to raise it from ""amusing"" to ""hilarious.""  Some of the jokes are on the line between ""wickedly funny"" and ""just plain mean,"" often leaning towards the latter.  [Some of the girls make their own vodka.  When they are told that one person's death was attributed to it, their reaction was akin to ""So what?""  It was kind of hard to ""root for"" them after that.]  Most of the characters are either stereotypes or not ""evolved"" enough to really ""care about"" them...going down the list:  Hot but vacuous/shallow blonde gal, check; cute but really smart 'n' devious twin tweener-girls (think Wednesday Addams times 2), check; goth girl, check; uptight Brit in position of authority, check; plain-Jane new-girl-in-school that turns into ""hot girl,"" check; slovenly sleazeball (Russell Brand, of course...like he'd play anything else), and so on.

3352661,2,B0013MYNYI,"ST. TRINIAN'S seems like an awful bust, unless the extremes of slapstick and borderline taste are your bailiwick. It is a film that comes across as a cartoon that never can get out off the page - what one would expect when the 'writer' is a committee (Piers Ashworth, Jamie Minoprio, Nick Moorcroft, Ronald Searle (!), and Jonathan M. Stern) and the direction is shared (Oliver Parker and Barnaby Thompson).

St Trinian's is 'school' for dysfunctional girls (nerd to goth) run by a wild headmistress Camilla Fritton (Rupert Everett in bucktoothed drag plus fuddy English gent's clothes as Carnaby Fritton).  The school is a major disaster zone and one Geoffrey Thwaites (Colin Firth) is sent to correct the issues.  The threat of bankruptcy spins its own dire consequences and the 'inmates' of the school find a way to correct that.

The major surprise is not in the plot but instead in the fact that some of Britain's finest actors agreed to participate in this mess: Rupert Everett, Colin Firth, Lena Headey, Toby Jones, Anna Chancellor, Celia Imre, etc etc could have their choice of about any film casting and win Oscars and kudos instead of boodos.

dear fans of the weird and bizarre,
.... it is about a girl's school for young ladies that just can't quite fit into any other school, run by teachers who are even more dodgy. The school is in trouble with the board of education and the Inland Revenue (IRS) and the film centers on the less than legal, but very clever way, they seek to solve these difficulties. Anarchy rules ST. Trinian's in the form of Miss Fritton, the head mistress in every sense of the word, who loves her school, and her girls and is determined to prepare them for life and success in a hard, cold world. All this is complicated by the arrival of Miss Fritton's niece who is certain she belongs elsewhere and doesn't realize at first that elsewhere is exactly where she's arrived.
Strangely, it is not entirely dissimilar to the school we attended when we were very young.

St. Trinian's movies from the late '50's / early
'60's, I approached this most recent version with
a lot of trepidation.  I was honestly expecting a
bastardization of Ronald Searle's notorious school
for young ladies, but truth be told, I found this
very enjoyable and quite in keeping with the madcap
comic tone of the earlier films. In fact, it plays
less like a remake and more of a continuation of
the series. I expected Rupert Everett to be funnier
in drag (as Headmistress Fritton) even though his
performance eventually grew on me.  Alastair Sim's
performance(in the original) was hilarious.  Colin
Firth does his usual steller job, even though he's
playing an unsympathetic character.  There are a
few referances to his 'Pride and Prejudice' heart-
throb status - like his emerging out of fountain
in a wet shirt, and having his leg humped by a dog
named Mr. Darcy.  Russell Brand - a comedian I've
always had a certain repugnance for - actually made
a very effective Flash Harry, the iconic character
originated by George Cole and who's turned up in all
but one of the St. Trinian films.  The young ladies
are a mixed bunch, but all are attractive. (How cute
is Lily Cole as computer geek Polly?)  The U.S. DVD

3352676,3,B0013MYNYI,"Rupert Everett's goofily winning dual performance- as slimy art dealer Carnaby Fritton and as his twin sister Headmistress Camilla Fritton- is the only high point in an otherwise thoroughly forgettable film.

St. Trinian's (""like Hogwart's for pikeys""), is failing. Half a million pounds in debt and the prime target of the new Minister of Education (Firth) and his crusade to clean up England's schools, the girls must put aside their differences to save their school or else risk going to a 'normal' school. This move would surely negatively impact their bootleg vodka and designer tampon businesses.

The problems begin with the script; populated by poorly sketched characters and a story that stirs few emotions. The primary mistake is simply the attempt to cram too much into this feeble frame. The 'belles' of St. Trinian's are divided into stereotypical (and tired) cliques, but beyond the obvious superficial differences, these groups are basically interchangeable and provide very few surprises.

The various female leads are solid, but unremarkable. Gemma Arterton is a lone stand out- she exudes a smoky, dangerous and clever sex appeal.

There is a lack of memorable sequences and a number that fall flat due to sub-par direction and/or editing. One brief sequence early in the film involves the new girl being tarred and feathered, however, it is so poorly edited, I momentarily thought I was watching a montage of several mornings' worth of hazing.

Cameos by Stephen Fry and Russell Brand add little and are not as funny as the film believes them to be.

There is one bright point in an unexpected little twist in the ""Ocean's Eleven""-inspired heist subplot but it does not redeem this limp and tepid entry.

If you are NOT a fan of British entertainment, you may find much of the dialogue incomprehensible as the accents combine with slang. If you ARE a fan of British entertainment, you may not be amused by the film's focus on 'gross' humor and weak attempts at edginess.",1264636800,,1989,5.009090909090909

""St. Trinian's"", the fictional girls boarding school created by English cartoonist Ronald Searle and spawned several books in the late 40's and early 50's,  five comedy films from the early 1950's through the 1980's and now a reboot in 2007.  The film which cost around 7 million to make, earned over 12 million in the UK but is among the top grossing independent British films made and one of the top selling DVD's in the UK in 2008.

The film had a brief run in the US in Oct. 2009 to help generate interest in the second film ""St. Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold"" which was released in theaters in the UK in Dec. 2009 and now a US DVD release of the first film in Jan. 2010.

In this reboot, St. Trinian's: School for Bad Girls features an all-star cast from the UK.  Starring Rupert Everett (Stardust, Shakespeare in Love, Inspector Gadget), Colin Firth (Mamma Mia!, Bridget Jones's Diary), Lena Headey (""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles,"" Vacancy), comedian Russell Brand (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) and Caterina Murino (Casino Royale). Also starring Mischa Barton (""The O.C.,"" ""The Beautiful Life""), Talulah Riley (The Boat That Rocked) and Gemma Arterton (Quantum of Solace, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time), with a cameo appearance by U.K. sensation GIRLS ALOUD.

The school which had been depicted as the girl school where the bad girls attend.  In the original films, these female students were daughters of gangsters, crooks and shady bookmakers.  But in the 2007 revision, the students are broken down to groups from the Chavs, the Posh Totty's, Geeks, Emo's and the first years.

""St. Trinian's: School for Bad Girls"" revolves around Annabelle Fritton (played by Talulah Riley), daughter of Carnaby Fritton (played by Rupert Everett) who has left her previous school and will attend the school which is headed by her aunt Camilla Fritton (also played by Rupert Everett).  Carnaby leaves his daughter at the school but to find out that St. Trinian's is behind on payments and if they don't pay their bill, the school will be foreclosed.  But Camilla tends to not bother with the collection notices.

As for Annabelle, she  immediately sees that the school is quite unkempt and their students are a bit different from her previous school.  She is given an introduction by head student, Kelly (played by Gemma Arterton) and is introduced to various groups in the school and also receives an initiation of sorts when she has goo dropped on her head and feathers stuck all over her.  To make things worse, while she takes a shower, the girls at school stream her shower through YouTube and steal all her clothing.  Immediately, Annabelle wants out of the school and tries to call her father to get her out to no avail.  She must stay.

We see how education is done at the school of St. Trinian's.  The school tries to make lab-made vodka and have their teacher Flash Harry (played by Russell Brand) sell it for them to make a profit, foreign language teacher Miss Maupassant (played by Caterina Murino) can be seen teaching wearing S&M tight leather clothing and a whip, one teacher for art class who uses his body to pose in the nude for his students, another who teaches students how to fire weapons and possibly, the most sane teacher is the new teacher Miss Dickinson (played by Lena Headey) who was just hired.  And a former head student turned PR guru JJ French (played by Mischa Barton) who teaches the Posh Totty girls on how to look smart.

Needless to say that the school has a bad reputation and thus education minister Geoffrey Thwaites (played by Colin Firth) wants to use St. Trinian as an example to raise the standards for other schools and will do what he can to make the country know how bad of a school St. Trinian's truly is.

Meanwhile, the collectors have given St. Trinian's a few weeks to come up with their payment or else the school will be shut down.  Fearing that they will have to go to a normal school, the students of St. Trinian's come up with a plan to pull of a major heist and sell the painting in order to get the money to pay the collectors with the support of the school's owner Ms. Fritton.  Will they be able to pull it off?

The main students featured on ""St. Trinian's"" are:

  * Annabelle Fritton (played by Talulah Riley, ""Pride and Prejudice"", ""Doctor Who"", ""The Summer House) - A normal student who can't understand why her father sent her to St. Trinian's.  Daughter of Carnaby Fritton.  She slowly becomes one of the girl's at St. Trinian and goes through a major makeover in the first film.
  * Kelly (played by Gemma Arterton, ""Prince of Persia: Sands of Time"", ""Quantum of Solace"", ""Clash of the Titans"") - The head student and all students listen to whatever she says.
  * Taylor (played by Kathryn Drysdale) - The student most likely to get in your face.  An aggressive student and part of the Chav's.
  * Celia (played by Juno Temple, ""Year One"", ""Atonement"") - Part of the Chav's who uses her Internet instinct to help out the Posh-Totty's and has a weird hairdo.
  * Tara and Tania (played by Holly and Cloe Mackie) - The Soprano-like twins of the group ""First Years"".  These girls are very smart when creating things in the lab, making of explosives and more.
  * Polly (played by Lily Cole, ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"") - Polly is the top of the geeks at St. Trinian's.  A hacker and gifted computer genius.
  * Andrea (played by Paloma Faith, ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"") - Andrea is a member of the Emo's.
  * Chloe (played by Antonia Bernath), Chelsea (played by Tamsin Egerton) and Peaches (played by Amara Karan) - Chloe, Chelsea and Peaches are members of the Posh Totty's.  The fashionably, spoiled rich students.
  * Beverly (played by Jodie Whitaker, ""Wish 143', ""White Wedding"") - The secretary of St. Trinian's and knows how students and faculty can get a buzz.

JUDGMENT CALL:

This movie is definitely not your parent's ""St. Trinian's"" that they grew up with watching when they were younger, this 2007 reboot is a whole new comedy sporting an all-star case featuring on a new group of bad girls of today's generation of Internet users, member of a school click...may they be a geek, emo, chav or posh.  ""St. Trinian's: School for Bad Girls"" is much more rude, crude but depending on your sense of humor, you may find it quite entertaining in an unusual way.

Despite the negative critic reviews the film has received, the fact that the independent film has done well in the box office and it has done well in DVD sales in the UK, now has a sequel with talks of a third film being made, definitely shows you how this film has amassed a cult following.  Intriguing as well as the actresses who have gone on to bigger projects since the making of the first film, most have all returned for the sequel as well.

At first, I was sort of expecting something a film along the same style of the original 1954 film ""The Belles of St. Trinian's"" but with a twist and more modern but what we got is a more, girl-power driven comedy utilizing a more modern feel of today's generation, working together for the greater good for their school in the most obnoxious, crazy, campy but yet hilarious kind of way.

Similar to the original film which had Alastair Sim playing both the headmistress and her brother, Rupert Everett takes on the role of Camilla and Carnaby Fritton.  For the most part, it was a bit scary at first to see Rupert in drag but for the most part but you kind of ease into the role because the film is quite campy but yet funny.  Colin Firth as usual, very good with his deadpan humor.

Those who wonder about the top billing of other well-known talents such as Lena Heady, Russell Brand and Mischa Barton, its important to emphasize that the main talents are the students themselves, especially Talulah Riley and Gemma Arterton.  Brand is featured a good number of times throughout the film, with Heady in second (has quite a few scenes that were cut and are on the deleted scenes) and Barton's role lasts around under two minutes.  So, for ""The O.C."" fans wondering if Barton plays one of the main students in the film, she's doesn't.  And why she is receiving top billing on the DVD, I'm guessing it is to attract American fans who may not be familiar with any of the UK talent.

""St. Trinian's: School for Bad Girls"" is not a a great film nor is it a bonafide stinker.  It's all about one's humor and their sensibilities.  This is not a politically correct film nor should those who enjoyed the original films, look for anything close to it.  Personally, I think some going to the film to see something close to the original may find the campiness and ridiculous gags a bit too much for them but for some with an open mind to the film's style of comedy, you can find some enjoyment because it is so unusual and crazy. And personally, I feel that Happy Madison or Apatow-related films have made me a bit more lenient towards these types of comedy related films and by the end of ""St. Trinian's"", I was content by it.  I found it to be a wild, crazy and fun film!

Parents who have seen trailers of the film and saw many children on it, don't be fooled.  This is not a kid's film, thus the PG-13 rating.  In fact, these younger kids in the film are making vodka and other unusual concoctions in their lab, using explosives and up to some kind of trouble.

As for those who are wondering about the ""girl power"" theme, it's nothing like ""Mean Girls"" of one trying to achieve popularity.  These girls are the outcasts of their school and find solace at St. Trinian's because they feel like they belong.  Sure, they may be amongst a group of troublemakers or depressed individuals but they enjoy being at that school and thus, the will do what they can to fight for their school.  I think the lyrics to the theme by Girls Aloud describes these girls in the best manner:  We are the Best.  So screw the rest.  We do as we damn well please!  Until the end...  St. Trinian's.  Defenders of anarchy!

As for the DVD, it's cool that there are a good amount of special features included.  I will say that there are some scenes that were included in the deleted scenes of the DVD that I wish was included in the final cut of the film.  I'm guessing that the filmmakers tried to get the duration down to 100 minutes and it is essentially the reason why there are so many deleted scenes (19) included on the DVD.

Overall, ""St. Trinian's: School for Bad Girls"" is a film that can appease the teenage girls with its ""girl power"" theme, especially the young Internet generation who are on YouTube digs music from Girls Aloud or a member of a certain type of school click. For the guys, seeing girls being bad or girls in their bra and panties with fishnet stockings are probably going to catch their attention and for the grownups, the cast which has a good share of older and younger talent is going to attract their attention, especially those who are curious about how different this film is from the original.

Again, this film is not going to be for everyone.  Some may find the film too over-the-top, boorish, crude and all out ridiculous, while others may find it as an enjoyable 101-minute popcorn flick with wild and crazy British humor.  If you are part of the latter, then definitely give ""St. Trinian's: School for Bad Girls"" a try, you may very well enjoy it!",1264464000,10,12981,4.623251748251748
3352678,5,B0013MYNYI,"Ok, we aren't talking Shakespeare here. The comedy is broad and a little crass BUT it's done so well and with such a sense of fun that you're drawn into it for an enjoyable romp. Rupert Everett handles the Miss Fritton role just as well as Alastair Sim over 50 years earlier.
Well done and a lot of fun. Aw come on! Have a little guilty fun!",1263340800,,341,4.104477611940299
3352679,4,B0013MYNYI,"This is not a high brow film. It is pure sugar - not recommended as a daily diet but great as a sweet snack. The original version and sequels were very risque for its day and this remake does a good job of trying to update the movie without going overboard.

An English school that accepts those girls that have been thrown out of every other school is not only in financial trouble but the government means to make an example of them too. Will all of the different factions (goths, sexpots, toughies, geeks, etc.) of St. Trinian band together to save the day?

Rupert Evertt does not do drag justice (which is amusing....) but all the characters are fun to watch. Colin Firth and Stephen Fry (brief cameo) were my favorites to watch. There are a lot of talented UK actors who appear in this movie and then there is a scene by Misha Barton.

This movie has more of a cult following then strong comedy to recommend it. I do not think it will appeal to the masses but it is silly fun.",1262044800,24,982,4.297297297297297

8252233,3,B0013MYNYI,"As a fan of the original film and of Colin Firth, I couldn't pass this up.  It doesn't have the wackiness of the orginal, but it was a fun update, with some subtle nods to its precedessor.  It would have been a better film had they not cut out some key scenes, though - watch the deleted that are part of the extras and you'll see what I mean.  Not for every taste, but I enjoyed it.",1491177600,,383,3.948051948051948
8252234,2,B0013MYNYI,love the film just wish I could view it.  I did not not notice region B in the listing so it won't play on my machine.  Not economical to return for refund with the cost of shipping.  Anyone in region B want this copy ?  Just send a message we can work it out.,1490486400,,260,3.759259259259259

8252238,3,B0013MYNYI,"Colin Firth, in a very strange movie. Maybe they were going for a female, English, modern version of Animal House? I'm not sure. Ruppert Everett is also in this one..and his character.....Well, just watch it if you want to. I'm sorry I did.",1480982400,,240,4.604651162790698
