6284042,4,B00IOFDKMS,"Ah, a new installment of our favorite harem! For those of you who have seen the first season of this series you know what you are getting into, for those who don't, you should probably get Samurai Girls first season before starting this. Well, I was drawn to this series because of the amazing art, and the second season definitely holds up to what I would expect. As far as plot, not much to be had here, this is basically your typical harem series with a good dose of comedy and fanservice. Expect plenty of bouncing um, samurai, and plenty of sexually oriented humor! I personally like this series a bunch (being a guy), but mostly for its artistic merit, not the overwhelming (or lack thereof) story. Good news on this: the voice actors and art is the same, so you won't be disappointed with a new cast or anything. All of our old favorites are back along with some new characters thrown into the mix, so this should keep you entertained. Support the anime market in America and pick this up!",1405468800,10,996,4.478021978021978
6284043,5,B00IOFDKMS,"Simply one of the best, and I found that the story line from Samurai Girls flowed well. The main male albeit at times displayed as a typical Japanese male who just doesn't get it still comes around in the end. The harem consist of some serious butt kicking females with exceptional talents in fights. It can be comedy one minute and fighting the next. It comes as no secret who the Samurai
Bride will be, and for my 2 cents I was glad that it ended that way. Waited a long time for this one, and it is one on the special shelf in my anime library. Oh, and thanks for the uncensored version where the so called fan service is there it added to and didn't detract from the show as it does when the silly little censor police decide to doctor up a show to satisfy their perverted sense of propriety.",1404518400,10,796,4.209150326797386
6284044,4,B00IOFDKMS,"Samurai Bride takes up where Samurai Girls leaves off.  Muneakira returns to the Dojo after a long training journey only to find that the ladies have squandered all the funds and turned the Dojo into a Maid Cafe to earn money.  Then he learns that the Tokugawa's took credit for saving Japan and cheated them out of any rewards,  Forced to endure the Maid Cafe or lose the Dojo Munekira settles into life as the restaurant butler. As if things couldn't get any worse 4 lady samurai reutrn from the grave and  show up Looking to battle the heroes of Japan.  Jubei is unable to transform, and the remaining Saumri Girls are no match for the samurai from the past.  Munekira gets cursed, if he cant defeat the 4  (undead?) Lady Samurai b4 the month is over, he will die.

New Samurai Girls will be initiated, including a Samurai Monkey Girl. Gisen will return to help save them or cause untold Havoc, only time will tell.  Will the legendary Samurai Bride be Munekira's only hope to save them all again.

Samurai Bride is even MORE Grapic than the original.  The ink Splotches are gone.  There is Nudity in the Opening Credits, during pretty much all the episodes, and during the End Credits.  Samurai bride heavy handed on the Fan Service, but fairly light in the begining twards the Action (1 hit wonder fights).  Expect alot more drama and comedy (unfortunately falls a bit flat at times).
All in all its not the greatest anime of all times and the story line is kinda flat, but it holds attention enough to keep interest.

Yes- all the ladies from Samurai Girls will be topless in this one.  Fairly Often.  No ink Splotches.",1404345600,30,1625,4.548275862068966
6284045,5,B00IOFDKMS,"Yes, it's shoujo, harem, etc. But it also has a great story line, and lots of action. I watched the whole series on Anime Network with English dub. It's a must after seeing ""Samurai Girls"". The description says it's only available in English sub. Is the dubbed version one we'll have to wait for?
If you like this kind of anime, and don't mind it's only subtitled, get it! It won't disappoint.
The biggest reason I'm waiting is that I want the dub, so I can watch it again either subbed or dubbed.",1403740800,6,497,4.354838709677419

6284085,1,B00IOFDKMS,"This anime mite be easily one of the dumbest I have ever seen. The plot, what little there is is dull and it soon becomes evident that the fanservice carries this series HARD.

The opening the the first episode also had the honor of reminding me how much it pisses me off that to this day the Japanese engage in revisionist history and try to make themselves seem like they were the good guys in WWII.",1450569600,,401,4.276315789473684

6284088,5,B00IOFDKMS,"This show is only those who love the nude factor. I watched (and later bought) this show only for that factor. The plot is meh, the animation is wonderful, voice acting well done, and character designs are breath taking. Not for families.",1446163200,,238,4.690476190476191

6284092,5,B00IOFDKMS,"The Girls are back, So if you haven't see Samurai Girls. You might want to watch that first.

These girls just cant stay out of trouble. Loads of fun and laughter this sequal follows the girls as they try to find out who will end up the bride to the Guy that grants them special Samurai powers. Fan Service included, this anime cant get much better then this. The story continues with a new evil the girls just cant beat. Only the power of the Samurai Bride can conquer and save them all, but Who will the Samurai Bride be. And how will they stand up to the new girls that beat them so easily.

This series is great on Bluray and im glad I purchased this as I can watch it over and over in high definition.

Watch these Girls fight over Muneakira Yagyu to try to become his Bride.

Regardless thats not why you buy these kind of animes its for the harem humor. I absolutely loved it.

6284111,2,B00IOFDKMS,"The art work for this series is really awesome, I feel that certain details in the plot are lacking. I really did enjoy the first season but Samurai Bride really went off the deep end. Without spoiling the events of the show, one of the representations of the historical characters was objectionable to me. Those who have seen this series should know in particular what I mean. Aside from that the ecchi humor is about the same as the first and is quite predictable.",1408320000,,466,4.559523809523809

8644042,5,B00IOFDKMS,"- Synopsis: A sequel to the first season. New enemies appear and threaten the peace and tranquility that the main character and his friends have been enjoying for some time. Old faces and new faces appear in this one. Which further complicates the main character's life, as he has more problems than he can probably handle. Managing his harem already has his work cut out for him, after all. This season showcases new and silly interactions between friends and foes, as well as more stakes being on the line.

===========================================================================================================

- Comments: The fan-service is heavy in this anime, as this may be important to note for some viewers. The story is simplistic as it involves having to defeat new foes that have appeared. Nothing complex. Some of the other girls get more attention now since circumstances are a bit different and will essentially create more pressure for them to prevent them from sitting on the side-lines.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 discs that total in about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA due to violence and sexual content. And yes, it is uncensored.

- Conclusion: This is a simple sequel showcasing some more samurai girls and silly ecchi situations, as well as some interesting characters and fight scenes. Still a fairly light-hearted anime that is easy to enjoy. Moreover, nice detail in leaving many of the famous old men out and replacing them with cute girls instead, as many of them are based off historical figures.

8644043,5,B00IOFDKMS,"Samurai Bride.  A follower of the original Samurai Girls series, and just your typical average anime fan.

A great story, characters that have raw emotion and feeling, this is the main hook. These characters are meant to captivate you. Animation is beautiful, soo smooth, so graceful, it is a work of art, it is simply outstanding.

Be warned, there are no children here, this is for the appreciation of hardwork and dedication to loyal fans who enjoy the rewards from fan service, and beautiful animation. If you are an average fan of anime, and you like stylized Japanese culture brought to life, this is a must watch.",1459382400,,620,4.775700934579439
