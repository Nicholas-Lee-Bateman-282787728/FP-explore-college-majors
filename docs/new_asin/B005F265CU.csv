4670439,5,B005F265CU,The Thin Man series starring William Powell and Myrna Loy is as entertaining today as they were when they were made. Nobody played a better drinker than Mr. Powell.,1331510400,,164,4.689655172413793
4670440,5,B005F265CU,"Loved that all four movies were included in this package.  As with all Hollywood sequels, these get a little worse with each iteration but the dialog between Powell and Loy can't be beat!",1329004800,,187,4.666666666666667
4670441,5,B005F265CU,Luv'd it Luv'd it Luv'd it! Too bad there weren't five movies in the package! I had ordered it before an had a bad experience with the delivery and the quality of the movies (three out of four wouldn't play) but this time I hit the jackpot! Really glad I tried the order over...,1326844800,,278,4.166666666666667
4670442,5,B005F265CU,"The first four films are the best in the series so to get them all at one price that is affordable is certainly worth it. Not much along the lines of bonus extras (for those you need to get the BIG box set that has all six movies) but if all you want is the movies and nothing more, it's worth it. Picture quality is superb (could we expect different from TCM? of course not). Myrna Loy and William Powell have great chemistry and it shows here.

Buy this DVD.",1326585600,39,460,4.111111111111111
4670443,5,B005F265CU,This particular package has the first four of the Thin Man series. I was surprised to see all four CDs stacked together and hope they will not get scratched as they are on top of one another. Each movie is close captioned and in black and white. These movies are screw ball comedy at its best .,1320710400,4,294,4.175438596491228
4670444,5,B005F265CU,"Rarely has so little spawned so many good sequels. In this case, ""little"" is Dashiell Hammett's classic detective novel ""The Thin Man,"" a gritty detective story about a pair of married society sleuths, the legendary Nick and Nora Charles. The resulting movie (and its sequels) are prettier, brighter and wittier than Hammett's novel, but even the least of these four mysteries is fun.

""The Thin Man"" was the sparkling film that started it all. While shaking a martini to the waltz, Nick Charles investigates the disappearance of an old client, and the murder of his secretary-lover, who was stealing from him. It seems like an easy case, but Nick isn't convinced. Ex-wives, anguished daughters, long-suffering cops and creepy stool pigeons all show up for a dinnertime revelation...

""After the Thin Man"" returns Nick and Nora to San Francisco. They find that Nora's cousin Selma (Elissa Landi) has been abandoned by her husband (Jimmy Stewart) for a sexy nightclub entertainer, and that he's also blackmailing her ex-boyfriend. Soon he turns up dead, and it's up to Nick and Nora to clear Selma's name....

""Another Thin Man"" is an adaptation of another Hammett short story, and introduces us to Baby Charles. The new parents arrive in Long Island to visit an old friend of the family, who claims that a former business partner is trying to kill him. Of course, he dies. Disappearing bodies, international suspects, and lots of martinis are par for the course...

""Shadow of the Thin Man"" takes the Charles family to the racetrack, where a jockey is unexpectedly killed. Nick doesn't want to be torn away from his vices, but he reluctantly gets involved when the bodies start to pile up. Gambling syndicates, lethal sports and milk-drinking are all tied up in this.

It's more or less a given that none of the sequels would be as good as the witty, taut ""Thin Man."" But then again, a bad ""Thin Man"" movie is still better than most movies, today or of yesteryear. They had witty, literate dialogue, lots of booze, and a hilarious mixture of the romantic comedy and the hard-boiled detective story.

And of course, Myrna Loy and William Powell. These two actors had glorious, playful chemistry together, and charmingly talk to thugs, cops, freaks, and high society doyennes in the same breath. The charm was somewhat diminished by Nick Jr., like when Nora orders Nick to spank the kid. But on the flipside, there's acrobatic terrier Asta, who never fails to charm (especially when he gets his own subplot).

Watching these four ""Thin Man"" movies is like taking a trip back in time, to the high society of the 1930s, and staying with the wittiest pair of sophisticates imaginable. Outstanding.",1312675200,37,2692,4.916299559471366
4670445,5,B005F265CU,"The latest entry in Warner Home Video's ""TCM Greatest Classic Films"" series is this four-movie roundup of THIN MAN titles.  Keen collectors would know that Warners previously issued all six films in the THIN MAN series in a big box set several years ago (complete with a bonus disc detailing the careers of stars William Powell and Myrna Loy); but casual viewers will appreciate the chance to enjoy the first four THIN MAN movies in a handy, space-saving double disc package.

THE THIN MAN - In the classic original THIN MAN (1934), we first meet adorable Nick and Nora Charles and their pet dog-mascot, Asta. Nick (William Powell), a former sleuth, wants to settle down into a quiet lifestyle and manage Nora's (Myrna Loy) various inheritances, but his fun-loving wife would adore for Nick to involve them in the occasional murder mystery. She gets her wish when Nick's former client Wynant (Edward Ellis) goes AWOL shortly before his daughter (Maureen O'Sullivan) is to be married.  Special Features: ""Thin Man"" trailer gallery.

AFTER THE THIN MAN - Arriving back at their San Francisco home just in time for New Years Eve, Nick and Nora are immediately plunged into yet another baffling murder mystery, this time concerning Nora's cousin Selma (Elissa Landi), who is discovered holding a gun over the dead body of her philandering husband.  Penny Singleton and a young Jimmy Stewart co-star.  Special Features: Robert Benchley comedy short ""How to Be a Detective"", classic cartoon ""The Early Bird and the Worm"", and the trailer.

ANOTHER THIN MAN - When Nick and Nora are invited to the Long Island estate of Colonel MacFay (C. Aubrey Smith), an old business associate of Nora's father, they gather up Asta and little Nicky Jr. for what they assume will be a rather dull weekend of Nick fixing the accounts. But naturally, the Charleses always run into the most intriguing murder mysteries, and the MacFay case turns out to be a real doozy!  Special Features: musical short ""Love on Tap"", classic cartoon ""The Bookworm"", and the trailer.

SHADOW OF THE THIN MAN - A day at the races turns sour even before it begins, when Nick gets a speeding ticket, and arrives at the race-track to find all hell has broken loose with the apparent ""murder"" of a star jockey who recently threw a race. Later on during a visit to a wrestling match, another dead body emerges. Nick is sure the incidents are linked, but to investigate he'll need the expert assistance of Nora and Asta...  Special Features: vintage short ""The Tell-Tale Heart"", classic cartoon ""The Goose Goes South"", and the trailer.",1311897600,68,2586,4.883561643835616

4670447,4,B005F265CU,Some of these TCM classic movie sets have suddenly become very expensive.  Anyone know why?  A few are a cheap as 10$ but the Thin Man collection is almost $100. Is there some sort of licencing issue involved?,1512604800,,209,4.473684210526316

4670451,5,B005F265CU,"The first four (of six) THIN MAN movies are gathered into this one set.  While successive entries got a little more formulaic, all are still enjoyable.  The original THIN MAN (1934) had the happy coincidence of being post-Repeal yet pre-Code, and the chemistry between Nick and Nora Charles (William Powell and Myrna Loy) was something to behold and generally maintained through the series.  Their arch interplay, Nick's knowledge of the underworld and Nora's sense of fun and fashion were all a tonic to the generally moralizing tone of early-Thirties films.  Most people who invest in a set like this will find themselves just as beguiled as the audiences of eighty years ago.",1508198400,14,678,5.026785714285714

4670536,5,B005F265CU,"Powell and Loy, simply the best pairing of husband and wife in crime comedy/drama detectives ever in film. The two actors mesh perfectly and the humor and wit is subtle. Bought to round out my collection of Thin Man and other crime dramas of the era.
These pair are simply the best.",1461974400,,282,4.4423076923076925
4670537,5,B005F265CU,"There are 6 films in the Thin Man series, each starring William Powell and Myrna Loy. This DVD contains the first 4 in the series! They are all remastered to a high quality and the sound is excellent!  I first saw thw original films in the cinema in the late 40s early 50s and enjoyed the banter between the hero and heroine, Nick and Norah Charles, and the antics od Asta, their dog. The supporting cast was always good. Well worth a watch, and well worth the purchase price",1461456000,5,475,4.337078651685394

4670540,4,B005F265CU,"I love the Thin Man Series, especially the first two (""The Thin Man"" and ""After The Thin Man""). Absolutely hilarious! I hope they saved Nick's liver for science, because he was able to drink about a gallon of booze a day (morning, noon, and night), and not only survive, but stay lucid enough (in a ""Jack Sparrow"" kind of way) to solve baffling mysteries! However, starting with ""Another Thin Man,"" Nick and Nora had a kid, Nora cut down on her partying and drinking, and things started to get a little too normal (i.e., boring).

This set contains the first four movies, each on its own DVD; the quality of these DVDs is great, especially for the price. My only complaint is the packaging: all four DVDs are mounted on top of each other on the same spindle! Couldn't Warner Brothers (or TCM) have spared another 50 cents or so to accommodate a proper four-disc DVD case, with each disc in its own slot? I think all of us who purchased this set would have gladly paid it. Luckily I had purchased some quad DVD cases and successfully transferred the four DVDs to one of these cases, along with its title sheet, and Bob's Your Uncle, problem solved!

P.S. I ordered the seven-disc ""Complete Thin Man Collection"" several months ago, but, as of this writing, it is still unavailable from Amazon. So, I cancelled that order and chose this set instead. I am pleased with that decision, now that I have the discs stored in a proper four-DVD case.",1461196800,7,1439,4.552123552123552

4670573,3,B005F265CU,"Very good transfers, nice artwork on the discs, interesting selection of contemporary shorts - so what's not to like?  Well.... these films were written on the fly and made on the cheap. Their chief strength lies in the portrayal of the sometimes charming, sometimes flat-out bizarre relationship of Nick and Nora; one that begins to bloom in disc one, gets side-tracked in favor of silly and predictable plots in #s 2 & 3, and begins to snap back in #4.  If you adore the detective genre, find boozy humor charming, and are able to tolerate the cardboard sets and ham-handed extras in the Fred and Ginger vehicles, all may be forgiven.",1451433600,,636,4.7207207207207205

4670598,5,B005F265CU,"The Amazon title says ""Volume 1"", and indeed, this set only includes 4 ""Thin Man"" movies (there were six total).  But the box itself does not say Volume 1, and it would be odd to come out with a Volume 2 that would only have two disks in it.  On top of that, these are widely regarded as the best four, and a couple years later a different set with all six movies (THE THIN MAN, AFTER THE THIN MAN, ANOTHER THIN MAN, SHADOW OF THE THIN MAN, SONG OF THE THIN MAN, THE THIN MAN GOES HOME) came out.  You can find it here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Complete-Thin-Man-Collection-The-7-Pack/dp/B0090XK9FO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Complete Thin Man Collection, The (7-Pack)</a>. So, I don't think there will ever be a Volume 2 to this set, and I think the marketing is more than a bit false.

With that said though, Thin Man is great, the print quality while not outstanding is more than adequate on a big screen TV, and you can get these four films at a great price point.  Unless you are a completist, you are probably getting enough here and is the best value for your money.  All films are on their own disk, but are stacked onto one peg.  Mine came in fine condition however and is just a minor quibble.  Unless this ever gets the Criterion treatment, this is the only Thin Man I think I need to get.

For those that don't know Thin Man, these are detective/light comedy movies from the 1930's that featured a married team of investigators (dog in tow), that go on to have a son as the series evolved over the course of the decade. Nothing high brow here, but still done very smartly and for the most part very well (anytime there are so many sequels there is bound to be some drop off).  The snappy dialog between the two is a lot of fun and reminiscent of ""It Happened One Night"" and ""Palm Beach Story"".  I'll let the real movie critics argue over which is more indicative of the genre :) Lots of cocktails, fabulous outfits, and a bunch of lighthearted fun, especially for couples.",1438560000,3,2034,4.622222222222222

4670658,4,B005F265CU,"Well, I love Myrna Loy. You should see her performance in Mask of Fu Manchu with Boris Karloff, great fun!
But this is about the Thin Man films. Fun movies. Lots of alcohol. My DVD collection already has a large share of film noir. I wanted to round out my mystery collection with something lighthearted, and this fits the bill.
William Powell makes it look like he is improvising his lines, he is a superb actor and always makes it look natural. Loy is a great foil, always holding her own against Powell. They look like they are having a blast, and from what I have read they seemed to love working together.
The mysteries are suitably complicated, many of the characters could have been a culprit, and they are all gathered up in the end like an Agatha Christie novel for the big surprise moment. It is always done in a lighthearted way. Too much alcohol, it is close. But these cheaply made quickies are lots of fun, but I said that, didn't I? Well worth the price for some of what the golden age of Hollywood did so well- Entertain.",1401753600,2,1037,4.40625

4670690,5,B005F265CU,"There is something special about William Powell and Myrna Loy acting together.  They were perfect as a pair.  They are the Abbott/Costello, Burns/Allen, Laurel/Hardy, etc.  Their timing and words are pitch perfect.  As stated, most all reviews agree these are the Best of the Thin Man Series.  The two movies of the Thin Man not included, are The Thin Man Goes Home and Song of the Thin Man, these are two dogs.  The Thin Man Goes Home played off as the son solves the case and makes his dad proud.  Frankly, none of the actors jell, the storyline is weak and stupid.  The bad guy/villain is not believable at all.  Song of the Thin Man is ruined by  Keenan Wynn in his worst performance ever.  This is all ""Jazzed Up"" and just plain annoying.  What is missing most in these two films is Nick's buddies and a good story.
The neatest thing of all about the movie set is the Extras.  I would buy it over again again, just for the Dramatic Short ""The Tell Tail Heart"" by Edgar Allan Poe played starring Joseph Schildkraut, who was a great Villain/Scroundel.  Each movie has a Short Movie and a Cartoon, just like the old days in the Movie Theater.
Also worth the price of admission is Jimmy Stewart, as a ""Bad Guy"" and he plays it to a tee, just as he did ""Good Guys"".
My personal favorite is Another Thin Man, as it shows why Sheldon Leonard as Phil Church became one of the most successful TV producer/directors of the 1950s and 1960s. Four of his productions (all on CBS)--""Make Room for Daddy"" (1953), ""Gomer Pyle: USMC"" (1964), ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" (1961) (which won 21 Emmy Awards) and ""The Andy Griffith Show"" (1960)--were rated in the Top Ten. He had a further success with ""I Spy"" (1965), championing the cause of racial equality over the (initial) objections of the network by being the first series to have an African-American (Bill Cosby) in an equal co-starring dramatic role with a white actor. Leonard is also regarded as having invented the television spin-off.",1370044800,6,1978,4.56657223796034
4670691,5,B005F265CU,"There are a few times in cinema history where a sequel is equal or better than the original. Where instead of simply following the same plot almost identical, or trying to build off the same plot of the last film by repeating it sometimes lazily, a film might instead takes a different turn to try and outperform the original. Similar to what the Godfather Trilogy did. ""After The Thin Man"" (1936) is one of those films that takes a unique different turn from the original ""The Thin Man"" (1934) and it works brilliantly. Although in this review I will talk only about this particular film, and not the more inferior four follow up sequels that would later come. Which honestly never matched the creativity and originality of the first two films of this series. ""After The Thin Man"" (1936) is the second of the Myrna Loy and William Powell ""Thin Man"" film series after ""The Thin Man"" (1934). Event wise it takes place days after the first one left off except in San Francisco instead of New York which you can tell by the opening of this film. I highly recommend watching both ""The Thin Man"" (1934) and ""After The Thin Man"" (1937) back to back or in order of each other since they play out as though they're one film when watched together. I will not give away plot spoilers so I won't get into the plot of the film(s).  While the first film was a light fun comedy of a tag team detective married duel type film with Myrna Loy playing Nora Charles and William Powell playing Nick Charles this film goes a different route...and it works. Still a light and at times slapstick comedy this film takes a darker almost Hitchcockish type of turn, and by the end of the film has a more darken serious and psychotic approach than the original. It's hard to explain in words, but if you seen the original, and seen this follow up than you'll know what I mean. The later inferior sequels do not follow this style of this second installment and seem to bounce between simply comical and at times senseless.  James Stewart stars in this sequel and he's not the sweet ""Ah shucks"" type you're use too in films such as ""Made For Each Other"" (1939) and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946).  William Powell and Myrna Loy have the gifted presence to be silly and comical one minute yet cold and serious the next.  Elissa Landi plays her role nicely yet deeply as her character was meant to be.  I highly recommend this as I do of the original. Other than ""Another Thin Man"" (1939) which I would give 3.5/4 out of five stars and still is pretty good and watchable although it follows the first film's plot style, but not as great as the first two, I would stay away from the last three especially ""Song Of The Thin Man"" (1946) which is the sixth and last film of this film series and I found to be the worst of the series, and even Myrna Loy admitted in her autobiography wasn't that great script wise and had lost its appeal since after WWII films took a new road in regards to storylines and plots.  The Thin Man series represents classic post-code Hollywood of the 1930s and 1940s. Five out of Five stars for both ""The Thin Man"" (1934) and ""After The Thin Man"" (1936). I would also recommend buying only on VHS or DVD to have in your personal collection instead of ""Instant Streaming"", and there are sets available where you can buy up too all six in one package.",1369526400,,3340,4.440456769983687

4670693,4,B005F265CU,"The thin man series are good, TCM did a good job of cleaning them up so you might appreciate watching a couple of them.  The Thin Man series took off and the stories and scripts when down as each sequel came out.  However if you still like the Thin Man this is a good way to fill you brain up with bad scripts and great actors trying to earn the dollar that the studios would pay them to do these movies.

Mugs replies, ""Movies,That's it! What does the Thin Man got that I ain't got?"" To which Danny replies, ""Myrna Loy.""
