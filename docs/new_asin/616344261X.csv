208356,5,616344261X,"I've been procrastinating on watching The Master's Sun for a long time. Even though I've read so many good things about it all over the internet, the premise of this drama just didn't catch my interest. I'm not really a fan of ghost stories and I also didn't quite like the cover art that was used to promote this drama. But I must confess that the thing that kept me from watching The Master's Sun, sooner than I should have, was the cast. I've always been used to ""Kkot MiNam"" (aka flower boy) actors that I didn't find So Ji Sub very attractive. Later on I felt guilty for judging him based on the only picture I've seen of him (which, by the way, is the drama cover on the top of this post). Not attractive enough? I TAKE IT ALL BACK because So Ji Sub is oh super attractive and he just makes me swoon.
Same thing goes for the female lead, Gong Hyo Jin; she just wasn't as pretty as the other korean actresses I've seen so far and after watching this drama I've concluded that the Korean Drama industry is actually not only formed by pretty and good looking actors. Surprisingly, there are actresses that are considered for their acting skills, rather than for their good looks.

This drama did a really great job on combining Horror, Romance and Comedy aspects, creating a perfect and heartwarming mix that makes viewers keep wanting for more.
So basically due to a major accident our protagonist, Tae Yang, starts seeing ghosts. Because of her ability she behaves in a bizzarre way and for that, people consider her to be weird and crazy. She later on discovers that by touching Joo Jong Won (CEO of a grand shopping mall) the ghosts that torment her disappear, so then she decides to go after him.

The chemistry between the two leads is lovely and outstanding. Tae Yang is the nice and sweet girl and Joo Jong Won is the typical arrogant rich man but because of Tae Yang, he begins to change and we see that he does have a warm and generous heart. These two have totally different personality that they balance each other so nicely and I really loved watching how their relationship grew and developed. They are, by far, my favorite kdrama couple! I liked the side characters as well and the different ghosts, who appeared in every episode, have a story of their own which was interesting to watch.

The producers promoted The Master's Sun more as a horror drama, rather than a rom-com, making viewers expect lots of dark scary moments. But to be honest there isn't much ""horror"" in this drama. Apart from a couple of spooky scenes this drama is all comedy and romance.

After I finished watching this drama I couldn't stop myself from watching it once again with my sister. Now that even You Who Came From The Stars ended, (Review coming soon) I'm at a complete and utter loss. I've been reblogging The Master's Sun gifs on tumblr, reading So Ji Sub articles wondering if he's starring in new rom-com drama but no he isn't.  -__-

If you're a fan of Romance comedy drama I recommend to watch The Master's Sun. But if you're new to kdramaland, you should watch other kdramas before watching this one to completely enjoy and realize how truly amazing this drama is.
If you still aren't convinced to check out The Master's Sun then this will make you want to watch it right away: Forced skinship",1405555200,9,3301,4.511705685618729

208358,4,616344261X,"Great dvd. Good quality image. Good sound. The only problem (if you can call it that) is that the subtitles aren't translated very well. It's not too bad and you can still understand what's going on,  though. Also the way the dvds are packaged is a bit frustrating until you figure out how to get them loose without scratching them horribly. I recommend buying this.",1401148800,7,366,4.630769230769231
208359,5,616344261X,"I just finished watching this drama on Dramafever and am purchasing the DVD set as I write this.  Absoltuley LOVE the romantic couple in this drama....they complete each other as ""Forever Couples"" should.  Yes, there are bits of ""BOO!"" in this drama, but it only adds to the complete picture of how this couple completes the other.  I've seen both actors in other dramas and search them out periodically.....LOVE that they are both paired together in this endeavor.

*** So Ji Sub (""Ghost"" cyber-crime drama), Gong Hyo Jin (Pasta, Greatest Love, Thank You)

Excellent Series to add to your Korean Drama collection.",1399852800,9,614,4.980392156862745

208370,4,616344261X,"Solid drama if you enjoy Korean drama. The way the characters interact and behave is pretty standard and may confuse or even frustrate people not familiar with Korean dramas, but if your willing to be open minded and watch the whole series you shouldn't be disappointed.",1468281600,,270,4.891304347826087

208372,5,616344261X,"Love it love it love it.  SO FUNNY AND SWEET.  A nice twist on a ghost love story. Ok yes he rough handles her and some people may not like that but he also is dealing with a woman who is not quite ordinary and both characters change.  So for those who don't like the rough handling look at the lead actors face when he finds the child's notebook and his behavior after that is a strong message.  Over all we really loved this show all 4 main characters had great comic timing and were sweet.
Nice sweet ghost story.  Some scary parts but not so much that you will lose sleep over because it is so funny all the time.",1460332800,,617,4.066115702479339

208374,5,616344261X,"""The Master's Sun"" is to-date one of my favourite Korean TV dramas.  I'm crazy over So Ji Sub as an actor...he really does have a wide range of movies and made for TV film's out there.  His co-star in this series has become a favourite of my also.  They are a wonderful team as actors.
However I myself do not believe in ghost...however this is a fun fantasy and the story from beginning to the end will hold your interest.  I laughed, got my hair up over the troublesome characters, and I cried along with the leading female actress.

Are differences a stronger element when drawing two individuals together?",1447027200,,609,4.5504587155963305

208377,5,616344261X,"I absolutely love this series. I am glad for English subtitles. It is good to hear the voice of the real actors even if I do not speak the language, you get something from the way they speak the lines and the non verbals that go with it. The spooks pop out at you without making you disgusted. Thrilling. The actors were able to drag me into the story. And it is fun, romantic and mysterious. Love the sound track also. I became a So Ji Sub fan with this one. He has some great expressive hand gestures. All the actors were great in this one even the spooks.",1444089600,4,558,4.128440366972477
208378,4,616344261X,"I have a serious girl crush on Gong Hyo Jin,  I watched this one after watching and LOVING, ""It's ok, That's Love"" and I am sure glad I did. She is fast becoming my favorite K-drama lead.  This was a unique story with ghosts (sometimes scary ones), old and new mysteries, and a nice sweet love story.  I will say I had a major case of Second Lead Syndrome here.  I thought Kang Woo was super cute and sweet.  I am re-watching this one because I liked it so much and love it just as much the second time around.  My only complaint is that I think it was one episode too long.  I think they should have combined the last two episodes and it would have been pitch perfect.  But it is just a small complaint for an otherwise awesome show.",1442707200,,734,4.119718309859155

I started watching this and could not stop until it was done. It was sweet, funny, and scary - and not in necessarily in the way you'd think, since this does include ghosts. A lot of them.

It's a wonderful story with an ending that does not disappoint. Invest. You won't be sorry.",1411344000,,416,4.1234567901234565
208385,5,616344261X,"K-dramas may be an acquired taste. If you are like me and like expanding your media horizons and don't mind subtitles, I recommend you give them a try. There are all varieties, but the ones I have been enjoying lately are their romantic comedies. To wit: THE MASTER'S SUN.

MASTER'S SUN mixes the familiar tropes of the rich, distant young heir, So Ji Sub, and the less than respectable young woman, Gong Hyo Jin, with a healthy dose of the supernatural. Both these actors are tops in their field and the Hong sisters write some of the best rom-com out there anywhere: The comic touches are delicate and add to the story.

Ever since Tae Gong Sil (Gong Hyo Jin) awoke from a 3-year long coma, she has been seeing ghosts. They give her no peace, no way to sleep and make her look demented. That is until she unexpectedly bumps into Joo Joong Won (So Ji Sub), who appears to cancel her ghost-seeing powers just by touch. The story is helped by the strong performances of Seo In Guk (of KPop fame) and Kim Yoo Ri, as well as veteran actors, Kim Mi Kyung and Choi Jung Woo. With 17 episodes, there is plenty of time to develop all the characters and lead us through the trials and tribulations of these two characters.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1411171200,5,1253,4.346153846153846
