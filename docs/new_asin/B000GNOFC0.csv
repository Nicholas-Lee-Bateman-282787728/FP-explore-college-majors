8133619,3,B000GNOFC0,"To begin with, the DVD transfer is very good, but there are no subtitles, not even French ones. Audio is original French, of course.

The movie itself is lightweight, this is children comedy at best. It is surprising to see that this was directed by the same Gerard Oury that made the classic La Grande Vadrouille. It is not the fault of the actors or of the director, but the fault of a weak script. It has its funny moments but there are few and far between. I was not impressed with the cutting either.

I cannot recommend the movie, but if you want it and don't mind the lack of subtitles, this transfer is ok.",1362182400,,614,4.2844827586206895
