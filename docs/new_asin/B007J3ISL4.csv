5090445,2,B007J3ISL4,Why does this film play only this way? Press display on your remote control and you will see. Does olive films master films this way and not 1080/24p? I paid 26.95 for this disc and I get 1080/60p? Considering that most newer players on the market can up convert dvd's to 1080p whats the difference? Execept the price!,1369094400,,318,4.5
5090446,4,B007J3ISL4,"Actor Edmond O'Brien deserves so much more credit for a long, talented career. His skills bring so much to this film and others he appears in. A great actor who is still missed by his fans.",1367107200,2,189,4.277777777777778
5090447,4,B007J3ISL4,"Crisp image on this Olive Films release of Silver City. As usual Technicolor is beautiful and the film is a whole lot of fun. Director Haskin fumbles the death of the lead villain but, giving him the benefit of the doubt, that may have been done to please the censors. If you like Yvonne DeCarlo, as I do, believe me she never looked better.",1365724800,3,341,4.34375
5090448,4,B007J3ISL4,This movie is okay and other people may like it alot better than I did.  Their is a lot of plot and a far amount of action.  I just didn't care for it.,1363996800,,151,3.5454545454545454
5090449,5,B007J3ISL4,"The main REason I wanted this Movie is because the Assay Office Owner in the MOvie used my last name. I know this isn't a big deal but when you consider that there is onlo one man that was the Head of our Clan it is important especially when the spelling is correct.

Now to the Movie by todays standardit would be a ""B"" Movie and by itself it would not rate amung the Greatest hits but as I stated my reason for wanting it was purely Personal.",1362441600,,444,4.045454545454546
5090450,3,B007J3ISL4,"A mining assayer (Edmond O'Brien) with a criminal past that haunts him joins forces with a miner (Edgar Buchanan) and his daughter (Yvonne De Carlo) to fight off a claim jumper (Barry Fitzgerald) and his henchman (Michael Moore). This rather ragged routine western, directed by Byron Haskin (THE NAKED JUNGLE), doesn't have much to offer though western junkies may find it agreeable. For the most part, it's the usual shoot 'em up but the most interesting aspect of it a subplot involving Richard Arlen as a man from O'Brien's past, now married to O'Brien's spoiled ex-fiancee (Kasey Rogers, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN). The barely suppressed marital tension between the two provides more conflict than the miners vs. claim jumpers plot. De Carlo is gorgeous in Technicolor but O'Brien needs a strong role to show off his acting talent. Without a good part, he's a cipher. With Gladys George and Myron Healey.

The Olive DVD is a spiffy colorful transfer in the proper 1.33 aspect ratio.",1348444800,3,981,4.945454545454545
5090451,4,B007J3ISL4,"i liked this movie very much the story was good and the actors were very good also

5090452,5,B007J3ISL4,"After the 1940s, Paramount Pictures concentrated on producing bigger budget ""A"" Westerns. During the 1950s the studio featured such stars as Charlton Heston (e.g., PONY EXPRESS, THE SAVAGE, ARROWHEAD), Alan Ladd (e.g., SHANE, BRANDED), John Payne (e.g., EL PASO, THE EAGLE AND THE HAWK), and Edmond O'Brien. Among O'Brien's several Paramount Westerns, Olive Films has licensed (thus far) DENVER & RIO GRANDE and SILVER CITY. SILVER CITY is fine Western entertainment, beautifully photographed in Technicolor, with solid production values, and good acting from a great cast. In addition to O'Brien, Yvonne De Carlo, Barry Fitzgerald, and Edgar Buchanan populate the action. This is thorough enjoyable Western entertainment.

Olive Films has licensed a number of Paramount Westerns, including RUN FOR COVER (Jimmy Cagney's best of the three oaters he made), PONY EXPRESS, THE JAYHAWKERS (with Jeff Chandler and Fess Parker), THE NIGHT OF THE GRIZZLY (Fess Parker), THE HANGMAN (with Robert Taylor) and perhaps O'Brien's best film prior to THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE, DENVER & RIO GRANDE (with its spectacular train crash scene).

Hopefully, Olive will continue to release Paramount Westerns. O'Brien's WARPATH is spectacular entertainment, as is FLAMING FEATHER (with Sterling Hayden). Let's hope they will see the quality release that Olive has given to SILVER CITY, RUN FOR COVER, and DENVER & RIO GRANDE.

Highly recommended; don't pass this one up.",1339113600,14,1456,5.491071428571429

5090459,4,B007J3ISL4,"The main reason I watched this movie was because I wanted to see an Yvonne DeCarlo movie.  I had seen her in The Munsters, and was wondering what she REALLY looked like!  Well, she was pretty enough, but not distractingly so.  I really liked the character she played of a woman who was not afraid to work hard to bring flowers and sunshine into her father's home as well as being his partner in their silver mine operation.  She  still retained her femininity as she conducted business in a potentially rough  environment, without having any feministic points to prove with the men.",1438214400,2,582,4.6568627450980395

5090461,4,B007J3ISL4,Really good western genre. Much better than I expected. Yvonne DeCarlo was a fabulously beautiful woman with high caliber acting talent. Never understood why she didn't get more leading lady roles before she landed as Lilly in the Munsters.,1437436800,2,240,5.17948717948718

5090467,5,B007J3ISL4,A most pleasant surprise for an older western. Costumes by the famous Edith Head that make every scene stand out in a special way. Yvonne DeCarlo is breathtakingly beautiful. I just loved it.,1425945600,2,191,4.818181818181818

5090476,2,B007J3ISL4,"I love old westerns, but this one is just horrible. I'm not sure which is worse, the acting, the directing, or the script. The fight sequences are worth watching if only for the comic effect, especially the climactic one near the end.",1398902400,2,234,4.595238095238095
5090477,5,B007J3ISL4,"Ok, I knew absolutely nothing of Yvonne De Carlo until ""The Munsters"". As I matured, I can't remember what movie I saw Yvonne De Carlo in but she was great. She was a handsome woman. Kiss in the mouth pretty. And could act. Enough about my crush on her. Mr. O'Brien, my first recollection of him was in the movie ""D.O.A.""  This is a good movie. A guy does the wrong thing. Pays the price for it. Gets the girl in the end. That and Apple pie is what it's all about.",1395100800,2,464,4.043478260869565

5090481,4,B007J3ISL4,"This one is a pretty special for its action scenes -- atop a train, through a sawmill (one fall looks so sudden and harmful, I'm not sure it was planned). Stunt work almost as startling as seeing Barry Fitzgerald play a villain. And it's a good story too, Edmond O'Brien as a man unforgiven, when we know he should have caught a break by now. A very sexy Yvonne De Carlo is all his regardless, and the dopes and villains will pay.",1373932800,,430,4.2560975609756095
5090482,3,B007J3ISL4,"The basic story of a love triangle plus good versus evil flowed nicely through the film, albeit this is definitely not a deep dark film by any stretch - more of a Saturday matinee. The scenes shot in the saw mill were completely implausible as the automated equipment used within the mill certainly didn't exist in the Wild West - a bit imbalanced that they didn't think the details better. No matter, though this isn't the big budget production, it is certainly enjoyable for anyone who likes westerns and who wants to mindlessly kick back for a spell and just watch a movie for fun.",1369094400,,584,4.571428571428571
8518157,3,B007J3ISL4,"Ordered the wrong movie, thought this was another movie seen in my childhood. Enjoyed the movie somewhat. It's always nice to stumble onto an old movie that I had never seen before. Not a great movie, just ok.",1529020800,,209,4.526315789473684
8518158,5,B007J3ISL4,Loved the movie when I was a child and it did not disappoint.  Maybe a westerns but the story is clean fun with less graphic violence,1528329600,,133,4.115384615384615
8518159,5,B007J3ISL4,"Silver City was released in 1951. It starred Yvonne De Carlo. A fine western involving mining, with lots of rock'em sock 'em action. Fans of Yvonne De Carlo will like this the most.",1479254400,,181,4.515151515151516
