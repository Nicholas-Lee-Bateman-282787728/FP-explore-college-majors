8257911,5,B00157YLV6,"first let me start by saying to mr john spazzano that in caes you did not know it there are a good number of bootleg copies of your dvds on the market, this is unfortunate because people like  me  had to pay full price for the dvds, the ones i bought i found out later did not even come from your people and they came with no case or art work . i strongly insist that you put macrovision on all future dvds , i guarantee you that if your order one of your dvds right now it would most likely be a bootleg copy. now as for my opinion of the dvds , they are outstanding in everyway production ,content, presentation, these are the third best i own out of about 67 dvds on martial arts . im very confused by the person who wrote in and said there was little or no instruction content, the dvds are jam packed  with exellent  material and are well worth the price ,i hope to see more from you and your lovely wife whose beauty is quite distracting by the way.",1454630400,2,955,4.037037037037037
8257912,5,B00157YLV6,"This is by far the best Instructional DVD I've watched in a long time. Not just the camera work and angles but the repeats, the slow time, the full demo, the reasons.
Excellent DVD thoroughly recommended.",1421712000,,204,4.694444444444445
8257913,5,B00157YLV6,"I'm going to side with John on this one.

I'm a qualified Silat instructor, and as such I didn't learn very much from the DVDs, but that's probably to be expected for something that's pitched at an introductory level. However, the production/camera work/angles are great, as are all of Suzzane's explanations. I regularly skip through it when I'm looking for inspiration/ideas for lesson plans. I'd recommend this to anyone with an interest in Silat.",1331164800,3,450,5.081081081081081
8257914,5,B00157YLV6,"Let me start by saying I am married to Suzanne Luna Spezzano and I am unsure how our product got on the Amazon site. It is listed as ""currently unavailable"" but I do not recall listing it on Amazon and would love to know who did so. That said, the review above needs some qualification. We sold hundreds and hundreds of this first DVD and The Cat's review above is literally the first response we've had that the DVD is not instructional or the material is not delivered well. In fact all of the response was quite the opposite. I don't know if/what axe to grind is at play here but I can assure you Suzanne's first DVD set the standard for combining production value with top notch instruction.

In other news her follow up DVD is out now: ""Madjapahit Silat 2: Cohesion, Structure and Pathways"" and is available at [...]

thanks for your time,

8257915,2,B00157YLV6,"On the bright side the production of this video was top notch. If you've seen any of Bob Orlando's Silat and Kuntao videos, you'll find this video boring and lacking of content. After watching this DVD, I felt I had learned very little with this set and can't suggest it to users who want to learn. This video is for experienced users who already know the basics and are looking to expand beyond their master level utilizing some advice from Ms. Spezzano, although new drills and moves won't be found here. In some ways, this video makes Silat look like Tai Chi as the tone is unlike any Silat video I have seen.

I'm unsure as to the skill of Ms. Spezzano, however I can confirm that as a teacher, she didn't translate her skills into a usable form that I could digest.",1267747200,2,770,4.384615384615385
