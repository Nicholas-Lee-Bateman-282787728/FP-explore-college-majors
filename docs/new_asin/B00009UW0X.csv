1890467,5,B00009UW0X,"This is a must have for part of any workout routine.  The DVD starts off with bascis such as choosing the right ball size, proper form etc. The workout consists of 15 workouts that challenge every muscle in your body especially your core. It's best to watch it first before doing it so that you can become familiar with the routine but the workouts are very easy to follow and the instructor (Liz) gives clear, detailed instructions. Liz takes you through 2 sets of each exercise so you will definitely feel the burn but most important is to make sure that you select the right ball size and that it is inflated properly because at first mine would sink in a bit when I sat on it but I looked at the instructor's ball and noticed how hers looked when she sat on it.  One should never worry about bursting the ball when they sit on it because it can withstand over 300 lbs. (but once again inflate it properly) A set of hand weights are needed for a portion of the workout (for arm & chest exercises) along with a yoga mat to place your ball on. Do give this DVD a try though because it is worth it!",1066608000,77,1098,4.223809523809524
7993024,4,B00009UW0X,"I had this workout DVD several years ago, but gave it to my niece. When I decided to go back to the stability ball, she couldn't find it and it wasn't available any more, so I went to my normal 'last resort' - Amazon.com. I am so happy to have this workout DVD again. It really is a good workout. The DVD arrived in the time it was promised, it was exactly as described.",1443312000,,370,4.013513513513513
7993025,4,B00009UW0X,"Anyone who likes these DVDs and exercises regularly (at least 2-3 times a week) should be able to use this DVD.
I usually do tummy workouts from the floor and wanted to strengthen my back and legs more.  This DVD worked out my legs and core muscles a lot.  take it slow but DO it.",1381968000,,280,4.072727272727272
7993026,4,B00009UW0X,This workout is great for strengthening your core. I like to use it to mix-up my weekly workout routines. The leg and bun workouts are great if you like lunges ... the ball really helps to stablize you so you can work harder.,1289692800,,225,4.255813953488372
7993027,5,B00009UW0X,"I am a very experienced exerciser with 90 percent (or more) of my workouts being done at home w/ DVD's and the like.

I am a ""graduate"" of Tony Horton's P90X workout (which is amazing, a 90 day high intensity program from Beachbody) and in my Post P90X workouts I've been utilizing a mix of disciplines using a large amount of Beachbody workouts by both Tony Horton and Debbie Siebers alternating those with Yoga and Pilates programs.

I am new comparatively to working out with the stability ball but have really enjoyed what it brings into my exercise rotation. I had one of Liz Gillie's Pilates DVD's (Target Tone) and really liked her a lot. She didn't dissapoint me at all with this ball workout.

She has a great variety of exercises that workout your whole body and does a great job explaining each exercise. The Dummie's programs in general are very good (I like the Pilates workout for Dummies with Michelle Dozois quite a bit as well). There are many tips that are given throughout and modifications to make the exericises either less or more challenging.

 My only minor complaint is that there were times I felt that things were a bit rushed especially in terms of the tempo for the dumbell. I find there's a lot more benefit to a bit of a slower cadence, especially on the negative portion of the reps.

Still, it one can just go slower and do less reps if they want, or just pause the program if they want to do as many reps at a slower pace.

 So, overall an excellent program that I'd highly recommend!",1185667200,2,1518,4.494545454545454
7993028,5,B00009UW0X,This workout DVD has a warm-up and cool-down segment along with a great range of exercises using the stability ball.  It is possible for a beginner to benefit from using this routine as well as someone who is already in great shape.  The exercises on this DVD will strengthen your back muscles and lessen the chance of hurting yourself when working at home or a job.,1169769600,3,366,4.53030303030303
7993029,3,B00009UW0X,"I bought this dvd because I was looking for a stability ball workout that incorporated weights.  This dvd had a segment that includes weights, however I found it to be very rough and rushed.

I was always taught that when working with weights that it needs to be slow and steady so that you don't injure or over work your muscles.  I found that to be the case with two other DVD's as well. (Total mix and quick fix).

I've worked out to the DVD twice, because I wanted to give it a far shot.  However, a second time didn't change my mind.  I also, like the other reviewer, thought it was too long.

A book that I would recommend for anyone looking for stability ball workouts with weights is ""Weights on the Ball Workbook"".  It has over 350 pictures of exercises with weights using the stability ball.  You can create your own work out or follow one of their plans.  I really found this helpful and an excellent guide.",1126051200,14,918,4.347058823529411
7993030,3,B00009UW0X,I thought this DVD would be fun and interesting.  The workout is so segmented due to the pauses (chapters) in between the workouts.  The exercises did not make me sore and many exercises can be done without the ball.  I would not recommend this DVD unless you are looking for a DVD that you can skip the exercises that you dislike.  I prefer a more fluid workout that easily transistions between exercises.  The chapters made the workout seem too long.  Truly disappointing!  I would recommend Denise Austin's Shrink your Female Fat Zone which uses a stability ball or the QuickFix Stability Ball training instead.,1123545600,6,614,4.846153846153846
7993031,4,B00009UW0X,"I get a good work-out from this video, even though it is fairly lack-luster.  Very unintimidating.  Working out with the ball really does spice up your exercise if you find yourself getting bored!",1106524800,8,196,4.909090909090909
7993032,3,B00009UW0X,"I exercise frequently (but not in the best of shape) and bought this DVD in the hope of toning up some more.  I learned some fitness ball exercises from one of the fitness trainers at the local YMCA and found those to be quite challenging.  I was hoping to find more challenging moves on this DVD, but I was disappointed.  I found the exercises to be too easy and did not feel any soreness at all the next day.",1104537600,12,410,4.1645569620253164
7993033,1,B00009UW0X,Every single one of the exercises can be done without the ball. This title is just an excuse to add to the Dummies range and man they must be desperate. The exercises are just everyday exercises but they somehow found a way to include the ball. Sometimes the ball is just rolled by your hand while doing an exercise. Absolutely ridiculous. I suggest buying a TamiLee Tighter Assets title.,1085875200,15,388,4.63768115942029
