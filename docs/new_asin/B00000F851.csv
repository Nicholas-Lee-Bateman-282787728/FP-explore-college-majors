7907324,4,B00000F851,Movie is a tale of good judgement and what is truly wise. I have used this film when teaching about India to middle school kids and to computer class to show graphic story telling. I hope it goes on to DVD as the video (now 14 years old) is a little shaky.,1301529600,,256,3.9423076923076925
7907325,5,B00000F851,"""The Tiger and the Brahmin"" is a story filled with the mysteries of the ways of the world and the consequences one must faced if they meet up with the enemies of the world. Ben Kingsley's narration and Ravi Shankar's music sets the story in a haunting yet interesting world of India. The illustrations are so unique in style that one could imagine actually being in India the moment they watch it. This story teaches about how to deal with a difficult opponent, which makes the story an excellent treat for the whole family to watch.",1093737600,,533,4.5625
7907326,5,B00000F851,"This production works on so many levels, and has been a favorite of our family. Ben Kingsley does a masterful job - from the arrogance of the tiger, the naivete of the Brahmin, and the clever and amazingly funny and wise jackal, who knows the way of the world and a lesson on how to deal with difficult people.  The artwork is beautiful, and the minimalist, meditative approach to animation is a peaceful island compared to today's animated videos.  Add to all that the sitar music of Ravi Shankar, and this is a rare gem. If your kids are in the 7-12 age group, we envy your experience of seeing the Tiger and the Brahmin, and this small glimpse into the traditions of India.",1073001600,3,676,4.443548387096774
