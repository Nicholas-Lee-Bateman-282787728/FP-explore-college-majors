7883682,1,6305120757,"As you could guess from the length of the film, this is just an overview of the subject. They actually encourage you to seek professional instruction on the subject, and after that they show the contact information of Tony Scotti's school of driving... And speaking of Scotti, he appears for some ten seconds at the end of the film, but othervise he acts only as one of the drivers on the film.
During the film, they use the same footage over and over, but for some reason they have reserved new material for the end credits of the film. For having to see the same clips over and over, the film is somewhat boring. And although the copyright year of the film is 1994, the material seems to date from the 80's.
There is one useful bit of information in the film: When stopping for a red light, leave enough room between your car and the car in front of you (so that you can see the rear tires of the car in front of you), so you have room for manouver if something surprising happens. Now, as you have read this review and learned this advise here, you don't need to see the film.
