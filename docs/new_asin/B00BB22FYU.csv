5568856,4,B00BB22FYU,"Good thriller movie.  The scenery and atmosphere gave this a ""creepy"" feeling throughout, very well done.  Plot was much better than the standard fare we see today and no ""shaky"" cameras trying to convey a you are there feeling and making it difficult to see anything.  Well worth a watch.  But beware!  You are not alone, even by yourself.",1361232000,4,340,4.694915254237288
5568857,4,B00BB22FYU,"It was a dark and stormy night and the plumbing was bad. This is a fresh concept I wish had been better executed. On Brewster Island three young adults go camping. Craig (Alexander Nifong) and Tracey (Stella Maeve) are a couple while Derek (Jamal Mallory-McCree) is a third wheel.

As a storm brews, the threesome break into a home on the island. We are shown flashbacks of the events of the previous night with the owners apparently accidentally creating their clones from their septic tank. As campy as that sounds, the film is not campy.

I didn't like any of the main characters. Craig reminded me of the Ashton Kutcher we don't like. Tracey was moody and showered with her back to the camera, and Derek was too serious. As they battled their smarter, stronger, and more likable clones, I found myself rooting for the evil clones.

The science was not well developed as one might expect when you put ""clone"" and ""septic tank"" in the same sentence. The dialogue lacked zing. Character and dialogue would have made this an excellent film.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs or nudity. Brief sex scene. 3 1/2 stars",1360022400,,1108,4.695876288659794

5568866,3,B00BB22FYU,It develops a little slow on the overall story but as I stuck with it I got into it more.  I ended up watching it all the way to the rather disturbing end.

5568867,4,B00BB22FYU,Some parts had me laughing out loud; very strange but entertaining and the best best best part was the very last bit so its worth it to watch the entire movie to just see that part. The quality is a little below a lifetime movie,1484092800,,228,4.088888888888889

5568872,4,B00BB22FYU,"The concept of the story is unique in that one character decides to make a conscious choice between the born person and the cloned person. Perhaps with a higher budget the story could have resulted in a better-produced movie. However, the story prevails despite the obvious flaws of the film. Four stars for effort. Perhaps the concept can be kept alive with a pre-sequel as to how the clones were devised.",1481241600,2,406,4.732394366197183

Okay, yes, it's a bit cerebral, and yes, it does have a few logical leaps, but that's to be almost expected in any sci-fi type movie.

On the one hand I enjoyed the concept but felt the movie didn't even get close to its own concept. The acting was pretty bad - which made it a little better because once again with nothing to expect it kind of seems not as bad. One of the best parts was how nothing made sense so there was little if any thought required - I just watched it to see what ridiculousness was coming next. In that way it kept topping itself.  I'm glad I watched it because for whatever reason I felt entertained by the complete lack of anything and the movies' ability to just go there. and there. and there. and even there without rhyme or reason or common sense.",1443744000,,790,4.266666666666667

They haven't spent much time together because she spent time overseas for the summer and he spent his working back home. I believe Derek is on his way to the military and maybe they hanging as a last hurrah. Whatev. Here is what I can tell you...Craig played by Alexander Nifong is beautiful. He was my reason to keep watching after the first 20 minutes and Tracy is played by a woman who appears to be cloned out of Brittany Murphy named Stella Maeve. Her IMBD shows quite a lot of work so I am sure I will see her somewhere.

Anywhooo...these three friends end up in the woods, setting up camp but Tracy needs to go to the bathroom. She is sent deeper into the woods by the boys with a shovel and toilet paper but stumbles upon a house that in flash backs seems to have a secret. A couple was murdered there by their very own selves. Ummm..yup hence the cloned title.

During a storm our trio head to the house, use the toilet and shower which somehow sends their DNA I guess into the septic and creates lookalikes or so it appears.

Ironically a scientist used to live here and somehow, someway his secret laboratory is still functioning.

It gets more interesting when the nude clones of the trio show up and personalities and dispositions alter who trusts who and what they all want from each other.

Well, I've given enough away but here it is in a nutshell.

5569012,3,B00BB22FYU,"The problem with Cloned: the Recreator Chronicles is that well, it's not very frightening.  It's not really a horror and it's barely even suspenseful for that matter.  The acting is average at best.  The movie feels more like a teen drama the likes of which you'd see on any episode of Beverly Hills 90210 or Melrose Place (yeah I know old references heh) than the kind that's supposed to be suitable for a thriller.  This affects the plot in a big way.  Now the idea of clones on the loose that matches that of the 3 teens who happen to be wandering through the wilderness and find a vacation home to stay in isn't very frightening.

In fact this movie has all kinds of flaws.  When the teens break into that very vacation house because nobody's home and assume it's okay to spend the night (wow what kind of person would ever think breaking and entering is okay?) they awake in the morning to find the owners (a goofy man and his wife) returning.  The teens quickly try to sneak out the house without being caught... however from here the story falls apart.  Actually on a side note, what kind of man and woman stop to kiss each other upon returning home?  You'd want to relax and unpack your bags at that point- not make out!  The teens soon get caught but the owners blow it off as no big deal and instead take them out back to bury a dead clone body.  When the teens unwrap the blanket and notice they're seeing clones, well they run away scared and confused.  I won't reveal anymore.

However this is definitely the best part of the movie because afterwards when the 3 teens return to the house they find that their clones have followed them, and they communicate with their clones throughout the entire film.  The problem is that the story is written for teenage drama lovers.  Not for those looking for a serious suspense.  The story's supposed to be about these cloned being superior in every way so they want to wipe out their inferior (the real) teens, however instead several love triangles and unproductive (and uncreative) writing takes place instead and the movie drags forever.

Stella Maeve's clone falls in love with Alexander Nifong's character- the guy the real Stella loves but has relationship struggles with (by the way Alexander seriously reminds me of Ashton Kutcher!) For the longest time Stella's clone tries to win over Alexander, while the real Stella gets angry and jealous.  As for the other teen, well his clone wants to make him believe he's different from the other teens and that he doesn't need them, which is clearly all a mind game to eventually make the real one weak and easily killable.

Stella Maeve is beautiful and she's the reason anyone would want to continue watching Cloned: the Recreator Chronicles.  The writing is really bad.  I think the wife and husband should have played a bigger role instead of being written out so early.  I will admit one thing, I enjoy watching whenever the clones appear on TV at the same time.  It takes me back to the older days of television when we'd see a person on screen making us believe he or she's communicating with an entirely different person (usually due to one of them dressing differently) even though they're actually the same person.  You'd often see a faded black strip of film in the middle of the screen to indicate the two characters obviously aren't on the screen at the same time- just an attempt to make it LOOK like they are.  Well technology has advanced so much that I don't even know how they make the same person appear on screen at the same time in a believable way anymore.  Technology makes it look like we really *are* seeing two different people.  Just a little observation there.

Overall you'd be better off skipping this movie.  Hopefully someone else won't clone this film with a sequel, haha.",1415750400,,3809,4.6

A DNA sample from the toilet is possible, but creating enhanced replicas with ALL memories intact from DNA alone won't work.  The replicator would have needed to acquire full brain scans, and implant those into the replicas.  That wasn't in the movie.

The clones and the originals however were interesting.  Both sets never considered their doubles anything except a threat.

Although both were plotting against the other right from the start, they played nice at first. Trying to get other off guard.  But Craig grew close to Tracy's replica quickly.

When the originals faced off against the replicas, the Craigs and Dereks were separated from the Tracys.  After Craig and Derek killed their doubles, they found the Tracy who'd won that battle.  Craig and her kissed passionately, assuring Derek she was the original.

At the end all 3 were back home, with Tracy in Craig's arms. Then Craig gets a call, revealing that the original Tracy was still on the island and wounded.

Right from the start both sets knew there was only room for one of each.  Suddenly Craig had to decide which Tracy lived and which died.  It was no longer a choice between the original and the replica.  It was a choice between the one who loved him and the one who didn't.

Sometimes you never need to go any further watching a film than the opening credits.

This is such a film.

I suggest going for a nice walk. Why not write in your diary or journal? Call a friend and have a chat about old times.

No? OK, then at least zap forward about 45 minutes into this crap rather than actually spend time watching it, eh?

Then thank me.

Where so many other films try to be smarter than what they are, this film just is what it is. CLONED is proof that not all films need to be brilliant in order to be perfect."" - YouWonCannes.com. ""I thought it would suck, but this movie idea was genius, and the plot was even better."" Mike Duan, Facebook. ""Cloned was a solid little movie that was a fun ride. It's worth watching."" - Jason Grey, TriskaidekaFiles.com ""Cloned starts out as your standard slasher film, but it is much, much more than that. I really like this film."" - Mike Thomas, matchflick.com",1368489600,,659,4.53781512605042
5569123,4,B00BB22FYU,Small budget but still entertaining..little thriller but moves along nicely with some nice twists. Don't expect too much and you may enjoy it also.,1367798400,,147,5.166666666666667
5569124,1,B00BB22FYU,"The only way to make this movie better is by making it just a little worse, so it crosses firmly over into ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" territory.  I don't know how they got ""Q"" from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" to make a cameo in this train wreck, but it almost certainly involved gambling debts or blackmail.

I find it hard to describe how awful ""Cloned"" is--at first I thought the worst thing about it was the absurd premise (DNA from feces gets automatically and magically converted into clones the same age as the original, with all of their memories and personality somehow intact?), but that is NOTHING to the interaction between the characters.  I would suspend disbelief on that sci-fi premise long before I would accept that any group of people would say and do the things they say and do in ""Cloned.""

And I wouldn't have bothered writing a review of the stupid thing if a few people had not given it four and five stars.  That's just insane.",1367452800,5,960,4.590643274853801
5569125,1,B00BB22FYU,"So I actually watched the whole movie, but the caveat is, I was browsing online at the same time. There was no way this movie would have kept my undivided attention. The weak story was only slightly less interesting than the acting, which reached new heights of awfulness. It's pure campiness, which I expected and enjoy. But this was bad. I really wanted to like this movie, and I almost did for the silliness of it. I had hoped it would be along the lines of Cabin in the Woods. But sadly, it was neither clever, nor scary. And not even the tiniest bit believable. Sorry.",1366848000,,573,4.415094339622642
5569126,5,B00BB22FYU,A fun romp in the woods with hot actors and a Sci-fi mystery. It's entertaining and well crafted. I recommend this film.,1366156800,2,120,4.5
5569127,4,B00BB22FYU,"When compared to the big budget hollywood stuff indies just can't compete, they don't have the budget or the names. But  it all depends what you're looking for. For me this was a fun movie. Compared to other indies I think the movie is very well done. Camerawork was nice. The actors were good, maybe not award winning but good enough that it was easy to watch. God I've seen some horrible acting in indies and compared to those these guys were oscar winners! The story was original and so what if things were unbelievable, that's why it's called fiction right? The main thing I will say is it was an enjoyable movie, kept me interested to the end and got me involved in both the story and characters. I think that's pretty good! I give it a 7/10 easily.",1363392000,3,754,4.385714285714286

8565151,1,B00BB22FYU,"Good production.
But terrible message for women and black men!
As a woman: Behave, and you get the man. Be smart, and you get left behind.
Be black, you have resentments against society, and be thought of as not smart. And you can be lucky to be accepted in the end by a (white) society by ignoring a truth, that you recognized.
As a white men: you can be dumb as hell, and still get the (adoring) girl in the end. (who used to be smart as an original)
That is so retarded and outdated, and upsetting.

Also, the end result was telegraphed 30 mins early, and was completely called.

I was disappointed in that end, and what it says about the people who created the story.

Can't say why without spoiling the movie for people who want to see it.",1503705600,,364,4.714285714285714

There are so few movies that have an unknown plot or twist(ending) these days.

8565158,4,B00BB22FYU,"First 20 minutes is a painful slog and this is easily one of the most ridiculous setups for a horror sci fi movie in history.  Once you get past that point though, if you like somewhat cheesy sci-fi horror movies, this one will do.  And even though it's a stretch to say that this movie has any psychological depth, it does make a few stabs at working the clone as the sort of darker amoral id of these characters and everyone's fears about being replaceable and inadequate in some ways and adds a little dose of complexity to the cliche run, scream, fight, run mechanics of a standard horror flick.

Purely in terms of twists, the ending is excellent. Although, it works so well as surprise precisely it seems to me because it seemed so out of character for one of the main characters who reveals himself to be a total jerk at the end.  I couldn't help be a little offput by the mysogynistic nature of the ending and I'm sure others will be offput as well.",1491696000,2,957,4.359550561797753
