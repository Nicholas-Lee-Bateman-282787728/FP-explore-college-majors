8093787,5,B0002TR2ZU,"Why not try to better our riding experience with specific stretches & exercises tailored for the Equestrian?
We make a difference- our body language & stiffness matters to our horse.",1395187200,,182,5.1
8093788,5,B0002TR2ZU,"I highly reccommend Equistretch videos. The videos are the next best thing to a live class with Kristi and Dan, which is a real treat.
My husband and I have used Equistretch videos for three years and really enjoy the stretching routines, as they address rider specific muscle groups and build core strength and flexibility. We are both middle aged and trail rider, fox hunt and I do some dressage. I have two of the videos and their travel book and stretching bands which I also enjoy.  We use a variety of yoga and exercise tapes and make Equistretch part of our regular routine. Dressage guru Jane Savoie has some nice things to say about their work-outs on her website. Enjoy!",1258675200,,680,4.619834710743802
8093789,5,B0002TR2ZU,Not worth the money.  Very old and very tame.  Not at all a stimulating workout.  Better off doing Yoga or Pilates!,1222214400,3,115,4.380952380952381
8093790,5,B0002TR2ZU,"I have been performing the equistretch workout for 8 months now with outstanding results.  Not only has it helped my riding abilitiy immensely but it has virtually eliminated any problems I was experiencing with back pain.  I ride Dressage at Medium level and accordingly train fairly heavily 5 days a week.  As an added bonus, it not only improves your riding, but makes you feel so loose and supple.  I have also slimmed down quite a lot in the stomach and buttock region due to the workout.  Just simple things like bending down to put on your spurs are now so so easy.  It is very easy to stay disciplined with the workout because it is fairly simple to do.  There is no huge physical exertion involved and you feel so much better as soon as you complete the workout.  My husband is a keen golfer and he was experiencing quite severe hip discomfort due to the amount of practice he does.  He started on the workout 4 months ago and his hip discomfort has totally disappeared.  On the weekends we now perform the workout together before we start our activities.  We sort of feel that we are cheating somehow because we both have such a huge advantage over those that do not perform a specific workout designed for their sport",989366400,17,1228,4.51131221719457
8093791,5,B0002TR2ZU,"Equi-Stretch has been a part of my workout routine since 1996.  I have been an avid fitness enthusiast for over 13 years and I have a Master of Education in Recreation Therapy.  Although I am not an active equestrian, the Equi-Stretch video has been the perfect way for me to balance my weight training goals.  I have tried a variety of home videos in the past and Equi-Stretch surpasses all of them.  Whether I am in need of a boost in energy, a calming, non-stressful release of tension, a mood enhancer or an all-around toning and firming routine, I find that I get it all in one workout with Equi-Stretch.  For a Mother of a toddler, I apprectiate having a tape like this one that can fulfill my personal needs at home.  I highly recommend this to anyone - from a beginner to advanced, from children to seniors.  The instructor shows safe modifications to suit the moves and positions for persons of all levels.  Thanks Equi-Stretch for years of personal success with your 5 star video!  Congratulations for being on Amazon.com! Leslie Berry, M.Ed.",973555200,15,1052,4.673913043478261
