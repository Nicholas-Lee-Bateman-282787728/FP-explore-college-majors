5086100,5,B007HCI4SE,"I rather enjoyed this movie from the 1950's.  The way in which we view the character of Semira, the beautiful yet mysterious young woman from the desert, is rather impressionistic.  Her origins are never clearly stated.  Is Semira really a human being, or is she a human incarnation of the ancient Egyptial goddess, Bast?  Is her brother really human, or is he an incarnation of the ancient high priest, who guards the Pharoah's tomb?  Intriguing!",1363564800,,447,4.906666666666666

5086103,4,B007HCI4SE,"Bel-Air (not the Chevy automobile or the menthol cigarette) was a 1950s low budget production company headed up by Aubrey Schenck and Howard W. Koch. They made over 25 films in a variety of genres including three horror films (THE BLACK SLEEP - 1956, PHARAOH'S CURSE - 1957, VOODOO ISLAND - also 1957). PHARAOH'S CURSE is the best of the three utilizing a no-name cast, atmospheric photography, a remarkably effective mummy, and a no-nonsense running time of only 66 minutes. This is one of those late night horror show movies that I remember fondly from my childhood.

A trophy wife (Diane Brewster) travels in the Egyptian desert in search of her adventurer husband (George Neise) so she can ask him for a divorce. The expedition is led by the stalwart Captain Storm (Mark Dana) who is ordered to bring the husband back before he can ransack a pharaoh's tomb. Along the way they encounter a mysterious exotic woman (Ziva Rodann / Shapir) who turns out to be more than she seems. Once at the tomb an expedition member is transformed into a centuries old blood drinking mummy (great make-up!) and things go from bad to worse.

What makes PHARAOH'S CURSE so effective is it's successful combination of elements. The script is remarkably intelligent for a potboiler, and the unknown actors turn in low-key, effective performances. The real star is the black & white photography which looks like something out of the 1930s. I'm sure the filmmakers studied Boris Karloff's THE MUMMY (1932) before making this one. The MGM LIMITED EDITION DVD-R, while containing no extras, offers a wonderfully crisp transfer that looks way better than the one I saw on TV. Old school, low budget filmmaking at its best.",1351036800,11,1699,4.875432525951557

5086106,4,B007HCI4SE,"MGM Limited has released another low budget gem from the fabulous fifties with Director Lee Sholem's 'PHAROAH'S CURSE'-1957, a different kind of Mummy movie made at the time when Mummies were few and far between in the Horror genre.  The film is part of a series of programmers produced by Howard W. Koch and Aubrey Schenck and emerges as the best of them without utilizing venerable horror stars from the past.  Here we have Mark Dana as part of an expedition to find a lost brother in Egypt's Valley of the Kings and gets involved with a mysterious Arab femme fatale played by the underrated Ziva Rodann and soul transference as the spirit of a royal priest possesses the body of one of the leaders of the expedition. The film predates Hammer Films 'BLOOD FROM THE MUMMY'S TOMB'-1971 directed by Seth Holt by a number of years and gives it an eerie edge on other low budget horrors of its time by giving our Mummy vampiric tendencies having him drain blood from the throats of some of the cast.  With some nice chiarascuro photography by William Margulies, the film emerges as a prime example of good low budget filmmaking for its time.  It also has an added plus by having the awesome beauty of Israeli actress Ziva Rodann here billed as Ziva Shapir in its cast.  With roles few and far between in the late fifties and early sixties , she may be known by fans by appearing (and saving) Director Douglas Fowley's cult voodoo favorite 'MACUMBA LOVE'-1960 and Director Riccardo Freda's pepla 'THE GIANTS OF THESSALY'-1961, a film highlighting the voyage of Jason and his quest for the Golden Fleece predating Ray Harryhausen's classic effects saga , Director Don Chaffey's 'JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS'-1963 ,by a few years.  With her sultry mysterious presence and gorgeous hypnotic eyes, Ziva steals every scene.  MGM releases it in a no frills beautiful full screen transfer and gives the negative its just rewards so you can throw away your boot leg copies.  Along with Director Edward L. Cahn's 'CURSE OF THE FACELESS MAN'-1958, it's one of the best Mummy movies of the fifties and deserves being excavated from obscurity.",1335830400,24,2123,4.781420765027322

driven ""horror"" anymore. It's fun to see what passed for it, back then. I love how everyone

5086130,5,B007HCI4SE,"I saw this on tv in the mid 60s and it was scary when the man that turned into the mummy came out of the secret passageway.

5086131,4,B007HCI4SE,"Okay, let's start with this.  If your idea of a mummy is the big-budget, special-effects extravaganzas of the last several years, you'll be sadly disappointed in this movie.  On the other hand, this movie represents its era of horror well.  It moves slower than the modern flicks, but the characters are well-developed, and the story takes interesting turns.  And the suspense builds slowly... and builds some more... and builds...

This is a slightly different mummy than any I'd seen, even the Karoloff classic.  This mummy is out for blood, literally.  Actually, strictly speaking, the mummy itself doesn't do much bloodsucking.  The curse in the title causes a member of the expedition to become a ""mummy"" that self-perpeutates by removing all the blood from those nasty British desecrators.  I won't give any more details on this aspect of the story, because it might spoil the fun.

In some ways, this is almost two short stories.  There is the fairly long setup story, while a small army group accompanied by the archeologist's wife (of course!) trek to the dig, meeting various concerns.  Then starts the core story with the mummy and the curse.  This was typical in its day.

With a runtime just over an hour, this is a fairly short vid.

There is a great deal of implied violence and the occasional onscreen assault within the 1950's limits.  Younger children might have nightmares if they believe the whole curse thing.  Most tweens and teens should be okay.",1392422400,2,1469,4.90650406504065

5086133,3,B007HCI4SE,I personally enjoy watching Mummy movies. Although the story didn't make sense it was an old movie and I like watching them to see the difference in how they were done compared to today.

Will they get there in time to prevent the ""Pharaoh's Curse?"" or will we have a fun watching a one-by-one blood sucking as the Pharaoh has his why?

5086136,1,B007HCI4SE,"Pharaoh's Curse (Lee Sholem, 1957)

Pharaoh's Curse, a barely-feature-length attempt at horror from the late fifties (two decades earlier and we'd be referring to it as a two-reeler), can have the word ""barely"" attached to many aspects of it. Barely coherent. Barely competent. Barely acted (at all, much less well-). Barely watchable. The list goes on.

There's a plot, which you've heard about a thousand times before (and it gets thinner every time): a group of Egyptologists, with assorted military personnel, open the tomb of an Egyptian pharaoh (that somehow seems to be in the jungle--I didn't think they had many of those in Egypt), and a curse visits one of the scientists, gradually turning him into a mummy. Not that you'll care, assuming you even remember the movie, apart from a mildly clever twist at the end, more than five minutes after you've shut it off. It has no real distinguishing features that would make it stick in your mind; the direction is barely there, the actors are listless at best, the cinematography is lackadaisical. There may be a reason to watch this, but I can't off the top of my head think what it would be. *",1365379200,,1149,4.768844221105527

This is another good late-night time filler when you're having trouble getting to sleep.  A horror flick featuring a cookie cutter love that triangle fitted neatly into the 1950's marriage morality guidelines.  Pretty, neglected wife becomes interested in handsome young army officer but can't leave her hubby because;  A) she really love s him deep down... or not;  B)  She loves the status of being the wife of a famous explorer....  or not;  C)  The censors wouldn't pass the movie otherwise.....  Yep!  The conflict is neatly resolved when the overbearing (but stupidly ""brave"") husband meets his end taking on a supernatural foe in a cursed tomb.
