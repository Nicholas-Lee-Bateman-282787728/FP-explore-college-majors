8544966,5,B000CCSG2A,"I was dupped into buying all three copies of After Midnight,two titled under different names Broken and The Document,all titled After Midnight when you watch the dvd. Of all,I would suggest The Document because it includes a cd with interviews from Amy Lee,Terry Balsamo,and Ben Moody. But if you want it for the cover art After Midnight is your best choice,there is an actual pic of Amy singing on the front,I can't tell if the eye on Broken is her's or not.",1183593600,,459,4.609756097560975
