8305973,1,B000M32UBW,"I've been studying the Wu Style Tai Chi with two different Chinese Grandmasters for almost a year, and the routine sequence on the DVD is not the sequence of moves that is taught in the traditional Wu Style. The instructor moves too fast for the beginner to grasp the details of the movement, the video quality is very poor.",1426636800,2,324,4.508474576271187
