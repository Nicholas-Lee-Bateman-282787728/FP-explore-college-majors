8333839,5,B001PMRJPQ,"Two in a series of four films, based on novels written by writter Tom Clancy. Alec Baldwin stars as Jack Ryan in the first film ""The Hunt for Red October"" and the part of the Sub Captain is played by Sean Conery at his best. In the second film ""Patriot Games"" Harrison Ford takes over the role of Jack Ryan and does a superb job and is later brought back in the third film ""A Clear & Present Danger"". James Earl Jones does a great job in his supporting role as the Director of the CIA in all of the first three films. Ben Affleck takes up the mantle of Jack Ryan in the fourth and final film ""The Sum Of All Fears"" which introduces us to Ryan's character as he is first brought into the CIA with Morgan Freeman playing as the current Director of the CIA. All four films are available on blu-ray and for total enjoyment I would recommend that you buy them all. None of these films dissapoints and will keep your interest till the end with all the twists and turns of the plots.",1252713600,2,976,4.169312169312169
8333840,5,B001PMRJPQ,two great movies with two great main actors.  What more can a person ask for.  Nice way to get to good blu-ray movies for a reasonable price,1245196800,,140,4.148148148148148
8333841,4,B001PMRJPQ,"To have the complete collection, these early movies are a must.  I have now upgraded to Blu-ray on all of them and it is truly worth it.  Color, picture and sound are well worth the investment.",1240617600,2,193,4.333333333333333
8333842,4,B001PMRJPQ,"The picture quality for the movies is fairly good, but not spectacular.  There are scenes in Hunt for Red October where the grain of the film is so noticeable that it's a little distracting.  That said, the quality is better for the majority of the movie.

For some reason, the special features included for Clear and Present Danger in SD don't play well with PowerDVD 8.  It only shows the top left corner of the picture.  I can't say I'm too disappointed though, since the movie plays fine.

I'll leave reviewing the movies themselves to film critics...",1240531200,2,555,4.670103092783505
