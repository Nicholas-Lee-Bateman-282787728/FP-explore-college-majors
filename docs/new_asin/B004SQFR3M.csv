8440074,1,B004SQFR3M,"Yet again, as I was writing about in my review of ""711 Ocean Drive"", Amazon has pulled another switcheroo.
The listing says the movie is available for Prime Users. With excitement, we click on the 'play' button and...nothing. A message pops up in Amazon's streaming player saying that this title is not available.

Again, as I mentioned in my review of ""711 Ocean Drive"", I don't care if the movie is available or not. But don't SAY it's available and tempt our purchase or clicking to view. That's manipulative and shoddy. Amazon ordinarily has such good digital content service that this sort of shoddy, disingenuous, and deceitful behavior is almost unbelievable. But, here we are--two times now--this has happened.

It is a poor show saying you have something when you don't. Deceitful, exploitative, arrogant, rotten, and an assortment of other ways of describing abysmally bad. All are ways of describing this sort of service.",1391472000,3,932,5.045454545454546
8440075,4,B004SQFR3M,"I am grateful for the opportunity to buy this title which I have been trying to get on DVD unsuccessfully for some time.
The disc arrived on time and in good condition.
I screened the disc and found the picture and sound quality to be quite good.
I would have liked that it would have been better packaged:  a more protective wrapping to protect it against the rough handling packages experience at the hands of the postal service personnel.",1373414400,,441,4.582278481012659
8440076,5,B004SQFR3M,"Glad to see that this movie is offered on Amazaon Instant Video.  It's a classic.  The movie stars Robert Young long before his Marcus Welby, MD days.  Great to see him star in something that was not his typically goody-goody role.",1344211200,,231,4.585365853658536
8440077,1,B004SQFR3M,"Absolute horrible DVD, very sloppily made, dozens of jumps and cuts, a total embarrassment and disgrace for the people that sold it.",1338249600,,132,5.045454545454546
8440078,5,B004SQFR3M,"I originally saw this movie at a film noir film festival and, having fallen in love with it, bought the DVD.  The plot is a bit unusual in that its focus is on a man who gets himself involved romantically with too many women.  Each of the women involved has striking personalities and qualities, and the way the movie treat the man's relationship with them is subtle and successfully brings out the meaning of his philandering.  Rita Hayward, who plays the trashiest woman, really brings a lot of charisma, and the plot twists are surprisingly brutal.",1322265600,,551,4.71875
8440079,5,B004SQFR3M,"jkm3 is out there. This is an excellent movie with more wonderful twists and turns than a sidewinder. Great cast, and script. One of MY favorite movies. And very happy that it is on Amazon to buy. All I had was a copy I taped from TCM and ended up losing 6 years ago. Now I will put it next to my other favorite...DOA!!!! One of the best ending's EVER!!!!!!!",1319846400,,358,4.128571428571429
8440080,2,B004SQFR3M,You won't believe it either.  Jane Greer and Susan Hayward both in love with Robert Young.  No way.  Film quality is sub par also.,1313020800,5,130,4.333333333333333
