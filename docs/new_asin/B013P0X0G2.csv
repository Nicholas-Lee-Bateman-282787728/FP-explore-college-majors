8728377,3,B013P0X0G2,"The bright side is the uncut prints of Once Upon a Time in China and America and From Beijing with Love, the bad side, well besides Once upon a time being cropped from a scope aspect ratio, the three other titles are butchered Miramax prints of Jet Li's movies.
Continuing the trend of releasing Fist of Legend, Legend of Fong Sai Yuk 1, The Enforcer/My Father is a Hero, and Police Story 3 in versions that only reflect the normal Weinstein approved cut of the film. I don't know if Weinstein just doesn't have the rights to the uncut versions or what the deal is. . It's a shame, because the quality transfer is great on The Defender/Bodguard from Bejing, Born to Defense/ The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk 2 prints. But sadly once again, we have to settle with a old Universe Disc of Fong Sai Yuk 2 that is uncut or the old World Video release of Born to Defense, and hell I've seen Bodyguard from Beijing in a dodgy but uncut disc from Beverly Wilshire.

I fully expect the next release of 5 movies will include the butchered The Master release paired with Swordsman II, also butchered with maybe three other movies hopefully not butchered beyond belief. They could have replaced those three Jet Li Titles with other uncut titles I know they own, like Dragons Forever, Tiger Cage 1 and 2, Wing Chun, Swordsman, anything else but three compromised, butchered prints, I guess we're extremely lucky they even included the original language track on those movies. So far it's only worth it for the two movies that are actually uncut and non-tampered with. Which thankfully I only paid about 10 dollars for it, that's a fair price for two movies that are at least not edited.",1445904000,6,1667,4.556666666666667
8728378,4,B013P0X0G2,"I'm pretty sure anyone interested in this collection already knows about the films included (four Jet Li actioners of varying quality and a mid-tier Stephen Chow comedy) - but the set's technical specs are harder to come by.

First of all, don't be put off because the description mentions English only.  Each film has its original Cantonese audio, in mono or 2.0 as appropriate.  The English subs are not dubtitles, and Spanish subtitles are also provided.  And yes, English dubs are present for those unfortunate souls who don't like ""reading movies"".  Born to Defense, Bodyguard From Beijing, and Fong Sai Yuk II have Spanish dub tracks as well.

The five films are housed on three discs stacked in a spindle keepcase.  Born to Defense and Bodyguard From Beijing share a disc, as does OUATICAA and From Beijing With Love.  Fong Sai Yuk II gets its own disc.  No flippers here, thankfully.

The films are in 1:78 anamorphic widescreen, except for Fong Sai Yuk II which is in 1:85.  The framing of OUATICCAA looks a little tight, but the information present is the same as on my old Hong Kong release, only much brighter and clearer.  In fact, all of the films look great compared to their previous HK releases.

There are zero extras included, which was pretty much to be expected.

Now the bad news: Fong Sai Yuk II and Bodyguard From Beijing are presented in their US edits with replaced music tracks.  This is more egregious in the case of FSY2, as an entire sequence is excised.

Despite these concerns, I am pretty happy with my purchase, especially at this price point.  As the world shifts away from physical media, I doubt we are going to see better release of these films any time soon - though I would love to be proven wrong!",1445040000,13,1738,4.645901639344262
