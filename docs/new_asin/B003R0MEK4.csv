4175610,5,B003R0MEK4,"Nighttime serials ruled television in the '80s, and Falcon Crest delivers all of the scandal, betrayal, insults & face-slappings you'd expect.  Jane Wyman, as ruthless Angela Channing, makes this show - truly a Queen of Mean if there every was one.  Her devious plans, schemes & verbal abuse are deliriously entertaining.  The supporting characters - vengeful Richard (David Selby), brazen Melissa (Ana Alicia), womanizing Lance (Lorenzo Lamas), crazy Emma (Margaret Ladd), murderous Julia (Abby Dalton) and the always put-upon Maggie (Susan Sullivan) - just add to the campy dramatics.  The first season took time to get things rolling, but Seasons two and three are just out of control and wonderful entertainment!",1353196800,3,716,5.423423423423423

4175613,1,B003R0MEK4,Looks like we have screwd over by Warner Bros. again we went through this with Knots Landing getting 2 seasons released 6 yrs apart then they used us then disrespected us loyal fans by not releasing the seasons 3-14 with no explination.....then they used us again by telling us that if we bought Falcon Crest season one they would consider realeasing Knots landing so we bought it then 6 months later they released Season two of Falcon Crest then stoped releasing it all together and Knots landing season three never got released... As hard as it will be we need to send a message to Warner Bros. by not buying from them until they can promise us to release the entire Seasons of Knots Landing and Falcon Crest cause if we keep just supporting them by buying anything they put out we will never see either show on DVD....,1340668800,26,821,4.516778523489933

4175615,5,B003R0MEK4,"Please release seasons 3 through 9!!!! Why release 1 and 2 and not the others??? It is a great series and those who have started watching it would love to actually finish it!!

Thanks!!!",1337558400,2,186,4.470588235294118
4175616,5,B003R0MEK4,PLEASE RELEASE SEASON 3 and ALL of the Falcon Crest series. I am waiting patiently to continue the saga!! It is so frustrating to not have the complete series available- I purchased season 1 and 2 and am now left hanging!! Hurry!! It is time to uncork the rest of the series!!!,1329523200,21,277,4.346153846153846
4175617,5,B003R0MEK4,"Finally.....Falcon Crest: The Complete Third Season!! Warner Archive has been promising a worthy release of this season....and it does not disappoint!! The video and audio clarity, sharpness and color are like new and a joy to watch and hear. Every episode is given the restoration and the results are a triumph! Each episode has a preview bumper, full credits and full unedited scenes!! Even the ""halfway"" point of each episode is marked with the original ""Falcon Crest will continue......"". No extras which is a disappointment but you can live with it. Chapters are included. The menus are clear and simple but nicely done.
Story-wise this season is one action-packed episode after another....no wasted time or action at all! All 28 glorious Season Three episodes!! This season covers the aftermath of the shooting at Falcon Crest revealing the occupant in the coffin and others. Angela and Chase clash hard and fast this season, Angela not even waiting for Chase to recover physically or emotionally. Cliff Robertson is solid and pleasant as Michael Ranson....and his supporting role is carried through every episode. The season deals with Julia's incarceration and mental instability and eventually her fate....Lance and Melissa's marriage crumbles....Cole is married....ownership of Falcon Crest changes and shifts........Angela marries....and then we have possibly the best Falcon Crest cliffhanger ever!!! No disappointments here folks!! Season Three is the perfect appetizer for Season Four which will continue many of the story threads.
Have no hesitation at buying Season Three....this vintage has aged to perfection....and makes the viewer eager and desperate for more!!!",1321228800,,1682,5.54863813229572

C'mon guys, get with it!!  Give the Falcon Crest fans and potential fans as reason to buy this entertaining show!!!.

4175656,5,B003R0MEK4,"I enjoyed watching Season 3 again of Falcon Crest, but now where are the rest?  The one thing I didn't like was having to spend $52 to see it (28 episodes x 1.99) as Amazon did not offer a cheaper complete season price.  But since this is one of my favorite classic TV programs, I paid it as I would for other seasons if they'd put them on.  I also wish they would add all the seasons for Knots Landing.  Right now only two have been released on DVD.",1378166400,3,450,4.022471910112359
4175657,5,B003R0MEK4,"I've always been a big fan of Jane Wyman.  She made ""Falcon Crest"" a show worth watching.  What a great actress she was and especially on here.  She looks so innocent and sweet yet on this show, she's everything but that.  She's manipulative, underhanded and willing to do whatever it takes to get her way.  She's always a treat to watch playing Angela Channing.  You also can't go wrong with handsome, sexy, talented Robert Foxworth playing Chase Gioberti.  It's great to see Chase and Angela battle it out.  Chase is the upstanding, kind, nice, do-the-right-thing man whom you admire and you wish that you could play Susan Sullivan's role as his wife, Maggie, because he's just too darn sexy and hot looking to be believed.  Besides, he's a nice guy who does the right thing and gets things the right way.  This show has a great cast, great storylines, great guest stars and is worth watching over and over again.  I can hardly wait for Season Four to come out.",1377388800,3,963,4.605882352941176
4175658,5,B003R0MEK4,After several years of waiting for this to be released we viewed the first 2 seasons again and then the 3rd season.  We are anxiously waiting for the next season to be released.  What took you so long???,1377302400,,203,4.315789473684211

4175660,5,B003R0MEK4,Buy it. Watch it. It's worth it--so many priceless moments... nothing compares in the 80s primetime soaps. This season is even better than I remembered!,1375488000,2,152,5.12

4175663,5,B003R0MEK4,"The first 3 seasons of FC are among the best any primetime soap has ever produced, and I think Season 3 is the greatest of those three.  Unfortunately, it was all downhill from here.  Enter the Nazis in Season 4, and, well, yeah, not as imminently watchable. Seasons 4-6 were reasonably good, but the last 3 seasons were pretty dismal, with the final one becoming completely unwatchable.  I personally started tuning out in 1987, along with most everyone else, apparently.  Still, I consider these first three seasons to be superior to anything that Dallas, Dynasty, KL, or any of the other primetime soaps ever gave us.",1374883200,5,620,4.820754716981132

4175665,4,B003R0MEK4,I am glad I bought this. I enjoyed it. But....Major brain surgery and she does not lose even one hair on her head? Season two was the best so far. I am waiting for season four. I really hope we don't have to waite so long this time. The picture quality is good. The color on some shows are not good. The sound is great.,1373673600,,319,3.923076923076923

We watched the first 5 episodes. This season is one of the best of the show. The video quality was very good, although not letter boxed for the wide screen.

I give it 4 out of 5. I want Amazon to offer a full season pass for season 3 for one price. Watching all episodes at 1.99 can get pricey .. and the season 3 DVD's are supposed to be out this year.",1362441600,,500,3.8076923076923075

Waaay back in the summer of 2011, we passed along word about a conversation we had with the team at the Warner Archive Collection, asking about whether Falcon Crest - The Complete 3rd Season was coming. A user of the Home Theater Forum website had spread word that he'd heard it would come to DVD in early 2012, but obviously that timeframe has come and gone a year ago with no sign of the title. But our own contact with the studio may have told us that the timeframe might not be accurate, however they could confirm that it was indeed an item they were working on.

Today we found out that the Warner Archive is still working on Falcon Crest - The Complete 3rd Season for DVD, and are hoping to have an MOD release of it ready later this year. How much later? Well, there's not date set in stone yet, so until that's finalized they don't want to take any public guesses (because anything could be subject to change, of course). Package art and cost aren't finalized yet either, but we'll have all that for you as soon as the studio makes it all official. You've been patient this long, so just hang tight and we'll keep you updated as further developments occur.

And we know that any talk of Falcon Crest always seems to bring fan questions about other primetime soaps of the era, especially the Warner-owned show Knot's Landing. The last information we have about that one - the same thing we've said a couple of years back now - is that it's still stalled due to ""heavy music clearance costs"" that are involved (but as far as we know, Warner's still trying to make the numbers work and make it happen if they can). Frankly, we have nothing new to report about that one, or anything else. There's no need to ask; if we ever have news, we'll post it on the front page as soon as we can. Hopefully we'll find out good things about the other shows, but right now we just want to let Falcon Crest fans know to start saving your pennies; it should be happening in the not-too-distant future. Stay tuned for updates!

NOTE: It has been emphasized elsewhere that this title is for North American/Region 1 release only, being a Warner Archive title. That may or may not be the case; we don't have access to overseas information being strictly a USA/Canadian site. However, while this item will initially be available via the WBshop.com website, which would only ship it to U.S. addresses, just about all Warner Archive titles soon after their release date will also become available via Amazon.com's CreateSpace program, too. And Amazon will ship that product anywhere in the world, so an overseas fan with a player capable of reading a Region 1 DVD will be able to enjoy it. We just wanted to make that clear, so global fans don't panic.

The thrust early on centers around Dr. Lantry, Chase's doctor during his recovery, and if it will be revealed that he took bribes from Angela to have him killed. In the background, Maggie's sister, Terry (Laura Johnson) comes to town with an agenda of her own and inserts herself squarely in the affairs of the Giobertiis and Channings eventually ending up with Michael Ranson  (Robertson), Chase's friend from Baltimore who has made the Tuscany Valley his home. Meanwhile the custody suit for Joseph waged by Cole against Melissa and Lance heats up as Lance and Melissa collude to dig their heels deeper into Angela and Chase's empire. Julia returns  in the second half and all wonder of her intent. All  of this culminates in a season-ending plane crash in Italy involving both families, Richard Channing and his secretary-turned lover, Pamela Lynch, leaving all to wonder just who will live to see another day.",1481241600,,1056,5.022857142857143
