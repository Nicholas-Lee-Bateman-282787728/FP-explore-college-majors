This movie had bad acting at best all the way through it, no solid good plot, marginal Kung-fu (pretty funny too) a lot of criptic information with half attempts at native English language and the other half with words way too big to fit the situation.... pretty humorous actually at times.  It takes a LOT for me to go a 3 tiered thumbs down on any sci-fi flick, but this was so bad, that even with only 10 minutes left in the movie I turned it off, put it in the box, and dumped the box in the trash.  The end..... I would give to anyone for the shipping cost, but why would anyone want to pay even that much for it??  A complete waste of time and money.",1265500800,4,912,4.341176470588235
