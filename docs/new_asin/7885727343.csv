1152185,4,7885727343,I agree with those other reviewers that these 6 are not the best. However I still enjoy them and glad that I purchased them. These 6 films are good fun but probably not as good as the FOX movies. I can't hardly remember them. However I think they are more about traveling to solve the mystery. I hope Fox will someday release them. I'd purchase them in a heartbeat.,1096588800,29,365,4.304347826086956

The Fox films that are labeled ""politically incorrect"" are the great ones and Fox has capitulated to misguided Asian Americans.

1152187,4,7885727343,"First, let me say that Amazon does not control which movies are released on DVD's so I can't fault Amazon for selling these, it is what the market has available. Second, these are not the best Charlie Chan movies, but in all truth, these movies were never cinematic must see's but a way to spend and hour or so with some visual popcorn.

 Now to the real issues - The roles were filled by Caucasians. This may really demonstrate my personal ignorance in my pre-teen years, but I didn't know that at the time. I didn't care about mapping actors to characters, Since I grew up watching these on TV on the various old movie shows available in the 50's and 60's so they bring back some good memories of a rainy day and some enjoyable times I thought they were Chinese and Chinese Americans and they did seem like pretty smart cookies! So if anything, at that time, it made people of Chinese descent appear very smart and very cool.

 Viewing them today it is different. But back then, on a rainy Saturday (or whenever) I used to really admire the Chinese, because they were smart and resourceful. I can understand the concerns of Chinese actors and actresses, in today's context. So all of us should remember they filmed them in the 40's and China was our ally in World War II and we wanted to show our support for our allies and the studios wanted to make a few bucks. So, if we look at these today - oh oh. But sixty years ago it was business as usual and it showed a minority in a positive light.",1090800000,31,1495,4.328571428571428
1152188,1,7885727343,"I think that the biggest mystery of this release is why????  Why release these bombs as a first offering of Charlie Chan dvds?  The Monogram series were the last, and worst, of the Charlie Chan movies.  Sidney Toler looked as if he were the victim as he moved from one scene to another as if he were forced to deliver lines.  But that is history.  The real crime is that we were given this selection of bombs in a boxed set with nothing but scene selections and subtitles for 'extra features.'

I was particularly fond of a mysterious episode where the people around Chan were dying one at a time, to which he would remind the survivors that ""dead men tell no secrets"". Well, the six movies in the Chanthology (clever title) are not those late-night movies I remember. Apparently the Chan movies were released by two different studios.

1152191,5,7885727343,"I only came to know Charlie Chan and his stories from some of the novels translated into Chinese, when I was still in China years back.  I loved it instantly, not because of the sentiment that he was a Chinese, but because of the excellent suspense and witty writing successfully interwoven to create a unique detective with both western approach and oriental wisdom.  In fact Charlie, as depicted in the novel, does not really appeal to me as a genuine Chinese, though he was seen everywhere in the stories as giving witty oriental quotes.  he is very far away from contemporary China and as people of my age (70s) would not really recognize him as Chinese.  That, however does not stop me from enjoying the stories and Charlie as a successfully created literary figure.  It's so entertaining!

However, be aware that three of these titles are available as a 3 title 1 disc set. Charlie Chan: In the Secret Service/The Chinese Cat/The Jade Mask for a much much lower price. I actually have both. Now, note this is a Sidney Toler Charlie Chan, that means there is a little humor mixed in through the antics of Birmingham Brown. Played by the controversial actor Mantan Moreland. Many, including myself, find his humor very very funny. But, beware there are racial overtones here that many are offended by. Mantan Moreland brought life to those racial overtones. However, you have to realize that these films are from the late 1930's and early 1940's. African American actors were portrayed in a somewhat racist manner back then. I found these stories to be both humorous and enjoyable. And, in true Chan tradition you did not find out who the murderer was until the very end of the movie. My only complaint is that these movies run just over an hour unlike today's movies that at least give you an hour and a half for your money. Anyway, it's a great set, well worth the money, just not what they are charging here.

1152644,3,7885727343,"After 20th Century Fox finally dropped the Charlie Chan series after closing down their B-movie unit in 1942, they took the unusual step of letting star Sidney Toler shop the rights around other studios to continue the series. With the war effort in full swing and Asian detectives - even Chinese ones - considered bad for business it took him two years before finally poverty row studio Monogram committed to a new series. Gone were the slick production values that Fox gave the films even when they moved from A-pictures to Bs, along with the quality casting, behind the screens talent and scripts in favour of a more cheap and cheerful approach that kept the series chugging along pleasantly enough even if its glory days were behind it. MGM/UA's Chanthology ofers the first six of these Monogram releases in an extras-free set that offers decent albeit not outstanding copies that are more than acceptable considering how poor the public domain copies floating around for years have been

Not that it got off to a good start with Charlie Chan in the Secret Service, which has all the hallmarks of a picture the studio had no confidence in and just churned out as a fast and cheaply as possible to see if there was any life left in the old dog without risking too much. Most of the film plays out on just one location aside from a now infamous sequence of Toler walking through a hotel lobby and hailing a cab that drives him slowly to the murder scene while insistent dramatic music blares on the soundtrack: it's the closest thing the film has to n action sequence, but it's all too typical of the kind of padding Monogram threw into their cheapies to get them up to feature running time. Worse is to come when Chan arrives and delivers some of the most horribly unsubtle on the nose dialogue crudely setting up character background to the cop on the case you're likely to hear outside of a home movie or un film de Robbie Moffatt.

Thankfully once Chan is on the case, things pick up, but this is still weak stuff thanks to poor writing, a lack of any real introduction to most of the suspects and a less than compellingly constructed mystery. Chan's been slightly reinvented, or at least reassigned as a Secret Service agent just to reassure the more xenophobic audience members that he's on the right side, with his remit to investigate cases with national security implications, in this case the murder of a scientist and the disappearance of the blueprints for his latest potentially war-winning invention. This time he's assisted by Number Three Son Tommy Chan (a stilted Benson Fong, nicknamed Confucius Junior here) and Number One Daughter Iris Chan (Marianne Quon), as well as - most controversially - Mantan Moreland's Birmingham Brown. A brilliant nightclub comedian, here he's cast as a cowardly servant in the murdered man's house, and it's a role that would see him criticised as an Uncle Tom figure playing a racial stereotype that would make work increasingly hard to find n the 60s. Yet for all the criticism, he's no Stepinfetchit caricature, his screen persona owing more to a Bob Hope-style comic relief cracking wise to hide his fear. Despite a couple of unfortunate gags involving a tribal mask and blackface here, his part could just as easily be played by a white actor, and - as a valued star of no-budget films on the Monogram lot - even after he went to work for Chan on a regular basis in later entries he's never treated as racially inferior.

There are a few aphorisms along the way (""If man places self in way of finger of suspicion, must not be surprised when receives poke in the eye""), but some of them are incredibly heavy handed and overwritten: ""Suspicion like rain - fall upon just and unjust"" is fine until the writers have Charlie go on with ""You protect self with umbrella of innocence. But at moment your umbrella have big leak."" It doesn't help that Toler's health problems are occasionally apparent, not least in his substantial weight loss. Thankfully, while things would never be as good as the Fox days, the series did show significant improvement in his follow-ups.

Sidney Toler's second Monogram Charlie Chan film, The Chinese Cat, is a huge improvement over his first, with a noticeably bigger budget that gets the action out of the house and into various locations, and a much better plot that zips along very pleasingly to a fairly satisfying conclusion. Along the way many of the classic ingredients are thrown into the mix: an unsolved locked room murder, a challenge from a rival criminologist, a looming 48 hour deadline to solve the case, secret passages, hidden compartments, fun houses, an ever increasing body count and the obligatory attempt on Charlie's life in a case the detective can, and does, solve with his hands tied behind his back, all put together with much more pace and wit than Charlie Chan in the Secret service could muster. Unfortunately he's assisted by Number Three Son Tommy Chan, played again with the grace of an alternately bored and overexcited chimpanzee by Benson Fong, the weak limb to which no family tree may point with ride who's largely there to give his father someone to amiably insult (""Your assistance about as welcome as water in a leaking ship""), though he does stand up to torture surprisingly well. A more welcome return is Mantan Moreland's Birmingham Brown, now employed as a cabby reluctantly ferrying the Chans from corpse to corpse and no longer required to stand in front of African tribal masks. There's even a marked improvement in the quality of aphorisms (""Expert is merely man who makes quick decision and is sometimes right""), which were in noticeably short supply last time round. The budget doesn't quite stretch to making the funhouse finale work too well, but there's more than enough to enjoy along the way to make this perhaps the best of Toler's Monogram Chans.

""Shadey business do not make for sunny life.""

As the obligatory baffled cop on the case says, Meeting at Midnight aka Black Magic is dime novel stuff involving hypnotism, sances, mindbending drugs and murder from beyond the grave. The lazy writing makes itself apparent in the lack of interest it shows in the mundane business of uncovering clues. In one climactic confrontation Charlie describes the motives of everyone at a sance, but the film gives us no clue as to how he found them out: they're simply dropped in as clumsy exposition, but too late to have the desired effect. For much of the film one person's guess is as good as another's when it comes to who could have dunnit. Yet for all that it's an enjoyable enough entry, perhaps not as much fun as its reputation among fans of the more supernaturally inclined mysteries implies, but more than good enough to pass muster as a programmer.

At times Toler seems to be doing his best to hide his physical discomfort, his face flushed in some scenes even when sitting down, at others he seems to be genuinely having fun with a more playful performance. This time he's assisted by both Birmingham Brown (who, with his usual run of bad luck, has just started a job in the house the murder takes place) and Charlie's cheerful Number Two Daughter Frances Chan, played by one Frances Chan, who probably had the part as soon as they saw her name in the casting directory (although she'd already played Warner Oland's youngest daughter in the now-lost 1933 Charlie Chan's Greatest Case). Though she's not much more capable than her brothers, without the usual exasperated putdowns his various sons endured there's a much more easygoing chemistry this time round that makes a pleasing change from the formula that sadly wasn't repeated.

""My boy, if silence is golden, you are bankrupt.""

The Jade Mask sees Charlie trying to find who murdered a scientist loathed by all who met him - he even made his own family work as his servants - to get their hands on his latest formula in a case involving sealed rooms, poison darts, ventriloquists' dummies, poison gases and life masks. This time he's aided by Number Four Son Eddie (Edwin Luke), a very expensively educated bookworm with less common sense than his elder brothers (""Every time you open your mouth, you put in more feet than centipede""), with Birmingham Brown tagging along even though he has next to nothing to do until a silly sight gag after the even sillier revelation to a mystery that sees corpses walk and anyone who knows the identity of the murderer conveniently waiting to get killed rather than telling Chan. If Eddie and Brown are just along for ballast, Al Bridge makes more of an impression as the bucolic local sheriff on the case (""Seems to me when folks asked me to run for sheriff, I missed a fine chance to keep quiet"") and it's a pleasing enough Monogram entry in the series even if the solution is particularly outlandish.

""You're stupid thinking these people would murder anyone. They're too busy murdering the English language.""

The Scarlet Clue may well be the best of Sidney Toler's Monogram Chan films, seeing him on the trail of a gang of murderous foreign agents after secret radar plans who are operating from a radio and TV station located in the same office building being used for radar tests and where murder victims fall eight stories up. It benefits from a novel location, though not one greatly different from the radio stations used in other 40s films like Abbott and Costello's Who Done It?, and a decent list of suspects including a blackmailing actress who sees knowing the killer's identity as a ticket to better roles (no prizes for guessing how that turns out), a theatrical ham called Horace Karklos, a Svedish janitoress and a crabby sponsor. We know who the underlings are early on, but the mastermind who communicates only by teletype and who probably taught Ernst Stavro Blofeld everything he knew about dealing with employees who fail to reach their performance targets remains veiled in mystery until the final unmasking. Benson Fong's Number Three Son is much less irritating this time round, though still the but of Charlie's retorts (""I had an idea, but it's gone now."" ""Possibly could not stand solitary confinement."") and Mantan Moreland gets the chance to do two great but brief routines with is nightclub partner Ben Carter that are terrific bits of wordplay.

Unlike the previous entries, which used US prints complete with wartime savings bond tags, this title is sourced from a UK print with some scratches, but nothing too distracting.

""Cannot sell bearskin before shooting bear.""

Unfortunately, The Shanghai Cobra is a step down. At it's heart there's a decent yarn about a suspect who escaped custody during the bombing of Shanghai that left him in dire need of plastic surgery who might just be involved in a series of murders involving cobra venom that are related to a plot to steal radium from an American bank. Unfortunately the plotting is overly complicated enough to make you lose track of who is doing what to who and the execution pedestrian enough for you to not care that much. It feels like it's been rushed before the cameras while it's still being written in another room, the romantic subplot being given a bit more screentime than the usual take-it-for-granted attitude of other entries to pad out the running time - you even get to see that thrilling footage of Charlie hailing a taxi from Charlie Chan in the Secret Service again. Surprisingly Mantan Moreland and Benson Fong are given little to do this time round: they're just hanging around the sidelines waiting for someone to give them something to do, but no-one seems to know quite what to do with them aside from one clumsily executed u-turn/you turn gag. There are a few memorable images thrown up, not least a bizarre jukebox setup which is linked to room where the customers can be spied on by a giant television screen, but like so much else it's never very clear how this is supposed to work. There is one nice in-joke where Charlie finds the hidden mechanism to open the door to a badly hidden room and things pick up a bit for the explosive raid itself, but it's all too scrappily put together to work that well.",1345507200,3,12160,4.770546318289786

1152646,5,7885727343,"Amazon's Editorial by Paul Gaita is very haphazard and uses sensibilities of today to comment on the past. Regardless of whether any of the Chans were Chinese or not, it was good drama, played by good actors who did not belittle or demean the Chinese people. It is so stupid to keep repeating how terrible it is that Chan wasn't played by a Chinese actor - is it terrible when a Chinese actor plays in roles other than those written for a Chinese actor? Of course it isn't. Paul - keep your PC junk to yourself. That being said, this with Monogram isn't earth shattering, but it does have good stories (each of them individual in spite of Amazon's reviewer). The series had simply run longer than it should have (Rathbone only made a total of 14 Sherlock Holmes movies) and didn't have the writers or budget it had previously. What can it hurt? Buy Chantology; if you remember late night TV being in black and white buy Chantology; if you like a slowly developing plot without tons of CG buy Chantology; if you like detective stories buy Chantology;just buy it, you can't go wrong.

1152648,1,7885727343,"I had read several reviews of the Chanthology. I was prepared for lower film quality. What I wasn't prepared for was the lack of story, Keye Luke and Sen Yung being poorly replaced by Benson Fong and Mattan Moreland as well as Sidney Toler's change in attitude towards the kids. I can live with the poor quality of the film. the earlier movies have a silkier look and better effects.
You can tell there was some cost cutting going on. The stories are weak compared to classics like At the Opera or In Panama. The lack of a ""clue"" that helsp the audience solve the crime is a big issues. Its as if they wrote these without watching the old ones. All the movies here lack the key clue the audience can see if they are paying attention. (Like In Panama when the schoolteacher mentions nitro glycerine).

Next issue is the lack of Keye Luke or Sen Yung. The importance of their roles is exposed in these late films. Both were very good actors. Benson Fong has the smugness but lacks the comedic abilities of either previous actor. The son played the key comedic role int he movies and Benson Fong is not funny. Mattan Moreland relies on facial expressions and sterotypical phsical comedy and it fails all the time. You never really like Benson Fong or Maattan Moreland as they just don't match up. Keye Luke was the best..

Lastly, Sidney Toler must have been ticked off by the poor scripts and supporting casts. He seems very cynical towards Benson Fong and lacks the loving expression that Wanner Oland had and that Toler showed in the earlier filsm.

These filsm are merely for the super fan of Charlie Chan as they show how the stories were not as well executed and the casts not as good.

1152649,5,7885727343,"In ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf"", Elizabeth Taylor says ""something doesn't have to cause a 'gut-busting' laugh just to be funny.""  The same - paraphrased - can be said of the Monogram Charlie Chan movies.

Sidney Toler, Mantan Moreland and any of the Chan offspring never won any Academy Awards, critical acclaim or broke any box office records.  But each one of these films was produced to keep Monogram Pictures alive and movie-goers coming back to see the latest ""whodunit"" and every one of these is entertaining.

The villians were villianous, the detectives smart and the police were dedicated public servants.  I didn't need a dictionary or a blueprint to follow the story and I definitely felt as if I got my money's worth.

MGM has all but disavowed producing the Chanthology Boxed set due, regrettably, to political correctness so along with the Tom & Jerry cartoons (and I'm not talking about the cat and mouse) don't expect these films to be available in an uncensored version in the future.

I am sorry to see this set go out of print as these old films have a certain appeal.

1152652,5,7885727343,"This series of later Chan films is very entertaining, presented with a lot of cool mystery atmosphere in the sets and photography that the Fox films didn't have. In my opinion, on par with the Fox Chans when ALL aspects of production are considered. It's a stretch in the Fox films for a Honolulu detective to be traveling to Egypt, London, Paris, Monte Carlo, etc. to solve murders; in these Monogram films, it's all in his backyard, so to speak, although he is no longer based in Hawaii. There's one scene in ""Secret Service"" that is hilarious (unintentionally)-- near the beginning of the film it shows an extended sequence of Charlie leaving his office, his building in D.C., taking a cab, arriving at a large house and walking up to the door. The music is SO-O-O-O dramatic, and builds and builds, and finally he arrives at the door and it's opened, and.... nothing happens! What was THAT all about?!?

Scott ""The Perfectionist""
I own the Fox collections of Charlie Chan starring Sidney Toler -which are excellent, but was somewhat hesitant about this monogram set after reading some of the other reviews. I shouldn't have been! These hit the spot just like my other sets. Yea, I like #2 son Sen Yung too, but Charlie has a few cute daughters also, and Mantan Moreland more than makes up the difference with comedy relief. I generally only do reviews if I think you are going to waste your money or I think it's very good.
I like things that take you to another place and time and let you get out of your head for awhile- and this does it! As for a white man playing a Chinese role or vice versa; sorry, we are all born on planet Earth- not China or America- and all cultures and stories are yours and ours to share.

1152898,2,7885727343,"I've seen this boxed set many times, prominently featured in a chain bookstore. Thank goodness I bought it used: it's expensive at half the price.

MGM has given us six Charlie Chans from Monogram, three from 1944, three from 1945, each running slightly more than an hour. Each is on a separate disk, with scene selection and subtitles, but nothing more.

All six feature the reliable Sidney Toler and the consistently entertaining Mantan Moreland. Benson Fong appears in three as No. 3 Son Tommy Chan. The rest of the actors are mostly tried-and-true, long-lived career bit and character actors like Al Bridge (perennial cowboy), Gene Roth (perennial heavy), Cyril Delevanti (perennial butler), and George Chandler (perennial comic working stiff).

All six films are written by George Callahan, an inept, ""Swiss cheese"" writer: plots full of holes. Five of the six are directed by Phil Rosen, who started out as a cameraman for Edison and never did progress beyond the ""filmed stage play"" phase of cinema history.

The prints are all good quality visually, though a couple of them do not always track steadily. Monogram is responsible for dark scenes being consistently underlit. (One film, ""Black Magic,"" is marketed under its TV title ""Meeting at Midnight,"" which, an imposed subtitle tells us, was the ""original title."")

The best film in the set is ""The Shanghai Cobra."" The director is Phil Karlson, best known for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kansas-City-Confidential-MGM-Film-Noir/dp/B000PMFRVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kansas City Confidential (MGM Film Noir)</a>&nbsp;(1952), The Phenix City Story (1955), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walking-Tall/dp/B000VDDDWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walking Tall</a>&nbsp;(1973). He brings a noir sensibility to the visualization.

I get the strong feeling that writer Callahan needed and took strong guidance from those around him. Thus, the McGuffin in ""Shanghai Cobra"" is a cache of radium, not the usual jewels or war plans; the film has, uniquely, a romantic duo and a flashback. In ""The Jade Mask"" Al Bridge delivers more country corn than Toler ever did Confucius. The weakest of the six films, ""The Scarlet Clue,"" is redeemed only by Mantan Moreland's ""mindreading act"" with fellow vaudevillian Ben Carter.

(In my library I have an old playscript entitled ""The Haunted House: An Ethiopian Entertainment."" Be aware that much of Moreland's comedy is of that ilk. Be aware also that he was a talented entertainer, well worth watching for that--often the only entertainment on the screen at all.)

Let me close by admitting that, having seen most of these films in the distant past, I didn't watch any of them continuously, but kept stopping and starting the show. The only way I could find them interesting was by referring constantly to the Internet Movie Data Base, reading cast lists and actors' credits.

Fox dropped it after a handful of Sidney Toler films (which aren't available yet on DVD). Supposedly Toler bought the rights to the name Charlie Chan from the widow of author/creator Earl Derr Biggers and then sold himself and the rights to Monogram. The films suffer terribly. Toler is a tired old man in ersatz oriental makeup, and cheap, boring, repetitious ""comedy"" relief is provided in extremis by Mantan Moreland as a clich blabbering, superstitious black lackey. The stories are so-so, but whatever values there may be are undermined by those two main stars. Benson Fong, as Number Three Son, is generally good -- charming though not so enthusiastic as Keye Luke -- but most of the time he has to play opposite Moreland or, in one pathetic film, a Chinese actress named Frances Chan as his sister of the same name...and she couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag.

There are two more Warner Oland Chan movies that have yet to make it to DVD. It would be nice if Fox would release those along with the early Toler films. But forget these Monogram pot boilers.",1182816000,3,1249,4.65158371040724

There are many process shots and the Toler series includes many of his children (he had 12) to help him solve the mysteries (Keye Luke did not return as #1 son after the Oland movies) and it is nice to show Chan with his family in some of these flicks to give him a more human dimension.

Has there been a funnier character than Birmingham Brown in any series.  Well, maybe Kramer or Ed Norton, but I'd put Birmingham on the short list.

And Sidney Toler doesn't get enough credit for reviving the franchise and serving as an able Chan.  In fact, his Chan is edgier than Oland's in some respects, which better serves the mood in some cases.

1153020,3,7885727343,"Loosely based on novels by Earl Derr Biggers, 20th Century Fox's Charlie Chan series proved an audience favorite--but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor the studio feared audiences would turn against its Asian hero. This was a miscalculation: actor Sidney Toler took the role to ""poverty row"" Monogram Studios, where he continued to portray the character in eleven more films made between 1944 and his death in 1947.

The titles offered in CHANTHOLOGY are indeed the best of the films made at Monogram Studios--but sad to say they aren't a patch on the 20th Century Fox films.  Scripts are leaden, the casting is uninspired, and the best one can say for the films offered here is that they acheive a consistent mediocrity.  Sidney Toler is always watchable as Chan, but he falls victim to malaise; the real spark of the films is actor Mantan Moreland, an African-American who plays the reoccuring role of Chan's driver.  Changing times have led us to look upon Moreland's brand of comedy as demeaning to African-Americans, but he was an expert comic, and taken within the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s his work has tremendous charm and innocence.

The best of the titles in this collection is THE JADE MASK, which finds Toler and Moreland supported by a comparatively talented cast; the worst is THE SECRET SERVICE.  THE CHINESE CAT, MEETING AT MIDNIGHT, THE SCARLET CLUE, and THE SHANGHAI COBRA fall somewhere in between.  Speaking as a die-hard Chan fan, I find them of curiosity value only--the sort of thing you watch in order to say you've seen it, but nothing more.  The prints are hardly flawless, but they and the sound are at least reasonable; there is no bonus material of any kind.  If you remember these titles fondly, or if you are a determined collector, go for it... but all others should stick with the 20th Century Fox films, which are now being slowly released to the home market.

SPECIAL FEATURES BIOS:
1. Sidney Toler
Birth Date: 4/28/1874 - Warrensburg, Missouri
Died: 2/12/1947 - Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California
2.  Mantan Moreland

Special footnote, actor Sidney Toler starred in eleven Charlie Chan films for Monogram Pictures...many viewers generally rate these films as poor when compared to their Fox counterparts...but often contain memorable moments, such as the introduction of a number of Chan offsprings, and even a good picture or two such as ""The Shanghai Cobra"" (1945) and ""Dark Alibi"" (1946)...Toler immediately worked to gain the screen rights to the Charlie Chan character from Eleanor Biggers Cole, the widow of Chan's creator...Toler had hoped that Twentieth Century-Fox would distribute new Charlie Chan films if he could find someone willing to finance the new film series...Monogram, a low-budget film studio, picked up the series...Charlie Chan films were profitable for Monogram, changes were made, Jimmy was replaced by Benson Fong as Number Three Son Tommy and Mantan Moreland played the ever-present Birmingham Brown, who brought comedy relief  to the series.. by the end of 1946, age and illness were affecting Toler, very ill during the filming and it was through an heroic effort worthy of Charlie Chan himself that Toler was able to complete his last film, ""The Trap"" in August of 1946.

FACT FROM THE VAULT:
Created in a time when casting Caucasians in minority roles was
considered acceptable, the Charlie Chan films continue to spark
debate to this day.

Want to thank MGM Home Video for taking us back to those classic murder, mystery, mayhem with our ace detective...watching this legendary actor and his professional team of directors, writers as creator Earl Derr Biggers served up the best of the best during those early films of our favorite detective...wonderful character actors of the cinema brought back so many wonderful memories of the times when film makers cared about you who purchased a ticket and came back for more.

These films can rival the Mr. Wong and Mr. Moto series of film with the intriguing formula that is just short of having the good guys ware whit hats.

Charlie Chan in the Secret Service (1944) Chan investigates missing plans for a weapon designed to battle German U-boats and a murdered scientist. Can he trick the bad guy(s) into reveling themselves?

Charlie Chan in The Chinese Cat (1944) from the 1940s television series, a couple of murders, a chess piece, and the cat does not look Chinese.

Charlie Chan in The Jade Mask (1945) now a scientist Harper (Frank Reicher), has been murdered among others. Was it the sister (Edith Evanson) or the butler (Cyril Delevanti)?

Charlie Chan in Meeting at Midnight (1944) occult mysteries and Charlie Chans daughter seems to be the target.

Charlie Chan in The Scarlet Clue (1945) Mysterious happenings at a radio station and now Charlie into the theft of secret radar plans. You may find Radioland Murders (1994) more intriguing.

Charlie Chan in The Shanghai Cobra (1945) more murders and this time it has to do with radium. There is something venomous about the plot.",1503878400,,1421,4.682730923694779

* THE LOST WARNER OLAND FILMS:
Apparently all prints and negatives of four films were destroyed in a warehouse fire in 1937.
Through some fancy footwork, Warner Video has been able to bring three of them back to life:

--- ""Charlie Chan Carries On"" (1931)
Simultaneously with this lost film, a Spanish-language version was filmed using the same sets and costumes:
""Eran trece"" (""There Were Thirteen"") starring MANUEL ARBO (photo 3) as Charlie Chan.
It's in VOLUME 1 with English subtitles (coupled with ""Charlie Chan in Shanghai"")

--- ""Charlie Chan's Chance"" (1932) and ""Charlie Chan's Courage"" (1934)
Warner Video cleverly reproduced these lost films using voice actors, the original screenplay, still photos and music. Sort of like a one hour radio show with illustrations:
""Charlie Chan's Chance"" is in VOLUME 3 (coupled with ""The Black Camel"")
""Charlie Chan's Courage"" is in VOLUME 4 (coupled with ""Charlie Chan in Honolulu"")
Too bad they didn't do the same with ""Charlie Chan's Greatest Case"" (1933)

CHARLIE CHAN'S ASSISTANTS
Beginning with the eighth film (""Charlie Chan in Paris""), the series introduced various family members to assist their father in crime-solving.
Over the next fifteen years, four sons and two daughters fulfilled this role, all played by Chinese-American actors:
1) Lee = ten films (Keye Luke)
2) Jimmy = thirteen films (Sen Yung - later billed as Victor Sen Yung)
3) Tommy = eleven films (Benson Fong or Sen Yung)
4) Eddie = one film (Edwin Luke)
5) Iris = one film (Marianne Quon )
6) Frances = one film (Frances Chan - her actual name)

For a breakdown of the films that each family member was in (also details about Birmingham Brown)

It is foggy at night with a full moon. A man is at the gate to a mansion. The butler goes outside and hears a shot! In a smoky workroom two men wear gas masks. Roth call the master to tell about the shot. They show a secret room. The master trusts no one. A policeman arrives at the gate; it is opened and another man sneaks in. [Did you see what happened?] The policeman enters the house. Charlie Chan is in the Carlton Hotel with his #4 son Edward. Inspector Guthrie calls Charlie Chan for help, the government is interested in this case. Harper was working on a process to harden wood to be like metal. Roth explains what happened before Harper disappeared. Walter Meeker is the lab assistant. Chan talks to the people in the house to learn about them.

Edward and Birmingham have to leave the hotel room and go to the Harper house. That policeman is missing. Harper displays the missing man to shock the people. Can Chan find the missing formula for the gas? Harper made masks of the people who were there. The country coroner said it was a natural death, but Charlie says murder. The coroner said a poison dart killed Harper! That policeman is still missing. Two women tell about Officer Kimble. Rothe claims he knows who did it; but he soon dies. Chan gathers the people into the living room so they can be questioned. There is a dictaphone with Harpers voice. Chan said Harper died in that room. Lloyd Archer arrives, he wants the gas formula. Someone shot a dart at Chan at night! The room has no windows.

Downstairs a secret panel hides a room entrance. That dictaphone has Harpers voice on its records; can it be used to open the door? They find Jane inside. Chan searches the room and finds an object. Michael the chauffeur arrives only to drop dead. Birmingham finds the missing policeman - dead! Chan says poison darts killed the three men, fired by an air gun. Chan identifies the hidden murder weapon! There is a clue in a part from a mask. Chan shows how a dead man can walk. [Is this believable?] Chan explains how an ear from a mask will identify the killer. The killer is unmasked! His accomplice is convinced to talk and spills the beans. They are turned over to the police. There is an explanation for their skills.

The story and its details are incredible to me. It is interesting as an example of what entertained America. Producing four movies in one year told of their popular appeal. But the details are not believable once you think about them. That is why a good story is needed to make a good movie.",1485475200,,2556,4.443496801705757
