2582578,3,B000FS2VSQ,"Well lets start with the basics. The real title of this movie is ""The Explosive Dragon Fist"". It's about hildegarn, who by the way isn't a dragon...(Im getting all this info from the japanese movie with english subtitles) Anyway the move gives no real hints as to its cronology within the dragonball z story line other than the fact that Gohan is already doing the whole Great Saiyaman thing so its probably after movie 12. (duh) Im too lazy to explain the entire story from beginning to end but heres the readers digest version: On a far away planet called Konats in a far away galaxy thats really far away, some idiots practicing black magic wished for their big ugly evil idol to be brought to life (aka a mix between pinochio and Godzilla). Anyway the beast they brought to life was called Hildegarn. Hes unstopable about a day, when two kids use their magic flutes to weaken him (wow they pick up weaknesses fast on that planet). Then they use magic swords to cut him in half (wow some fast blacksmiths on this planet too). Somehow the flutes trap the two halves (head to waist/waist down) inside their bodies. Then finally the enders get involved and decide that the two brothers who saved the planet should be locked in music boxes and sent to the two ends of the universe. (gee interesting way of showing gratitude). Moving on, the two brothers (Tapion and Minoshiyal) are sent to the far ends of the galaxy. About 1,000 years later, one of the dudes that brought the beast to life, who had been traveling from planet to planet looking for the brothers, found the younger brother and killed him. (minoshiyal, cuz who wants to base a story around a person with a name that hard to pronounce) Thus the lower half of hildegarn was released. (legs and tail) Later the evil guy finds tapions music box and goes to earth, where he tricks Gohan into using the dragon balls to free tapion, who has a hard time keeping the upper half under control. (If he falls asleep, it escapes and tries to kill him) But freeing Tapion meant the super special music box which kept Tapion locked away was destroyed. So to help him, Bulma tries to contruct a new one but it doesn't work. Tapion, thinking it's ok to sleep, falls asleep and the upper half of Hildegard unites with the lower half and the full Hildegard reaks havoc on the town. The Z-squad tried and fails to beat it, then Goten and Trunks fuse and goof around, then after being yelled at by Picollo, they attack Hildegarn and it seems like they've won. But (dun dun dun) Hildegard sheds his ugly skin like a beetle and becomes even uglier than before (if thats possible). The only difference is that now, he has wings. Yay. So anyway he kills more stuff and at the last minute when all hope seems lost Goku goes Super Saiyan 3 and says some cheesy line before doing this awsome punch (evidently a dragon fist) where he flies up in the air and the dragon that comes out when someone summons the uses the dragon balls (the ones on earth) appears in gleaming gold like Goku's hair, and flies right through Hildegarn's torso, leaving a giant hole the size of  the roman coloseum, which obviously kills him. So yea, yay, Goku won as if you had any doubts. I know it was a bit long but it's a complicated story. There are alot of other details i left out so you wouldnt be reading an article the size of a harry potter book, but when the movie comes out, it'll just be more interested to watch.",1149465600,10,3438,4.457142857142857

2582582,5,B000FS2VSQ,BEST DBZ MOVIE!!! This is a must own for Dragon Ball Fans. Has Fusion Goten and Trunks and Goku turns level 3. BUY IT NOW...,1360540800,,124,4.0
2582583,4,B000FS2VSQ,"Long ago a monster was sealed away by two brothers. They used magical flutes to imprison it. In the present a stranger named Hoy arrives on Earth with the intention of reviving the monster. The Z fighters must rely on the spirit of the one that sealed it away.

This is one of the weirdest DBZ universe films. It is mainly about a day in the life of a bored and mischievous Trunks. He befriends a stranger and has his friendship tested. It's proof that Vegeta is a crappy father until he sees Trunks die at the hands of Cell, or when he saves the lives of Goten and Trunks in the battle with Buu. This movie is definitely different. I can see many people not caring for it much. I liked it though. It's nice to get a new look at DBZ. I think it's worth giving a chance.",1351555200,,769,4.126666666666667
2582584,5,B000FS2VSQ,"This is one of the best DBZ movies. Not just having Tapion in it. The story, the action, and Goku turning in his powerful Super Saiyan 3 form, Goten and Trunks doing the Fusion Dance, to become Gotenks, Gohan turning into his Ultimate form. The villains in this movie are really cool too. If you love DBZ so much this is a movie to check out.",1350604800,,342,4.196969696969697
2582585,4,B000FS2VSQ,"One Of My Favorites Along With Fusion Reborn, 2 Must Haves For DBZ Fans, The Only Downside Is The Japanese Audio Needs To Be Up To Par With The Dub (They Always Keep Jap. In Mono Even Though They Can Have It In Dolby Digital Like The Region 2's). But Overall Very Good.",1230681600,,269,4.09433962264151
2582586,5,B000FS2VSQ,"Wrath of the Dragon is definitely an alternate storyline.  However this is the case because it is directly linked to the Trunks storyline.  Without giving a spoiler, you find out the origin of the sword that Trunks carries in the series.  In the manga which gives more details, young Trunks, in his timeline, defeated the monster at a very high cost to the planet.  Of course, this movie is the ""what if"" Goku survived after Majin Boo and faced the monster.",1212451200,,457,4.604938271604938

2582588,5,B000FS2VSQ,"This is the last movie of the Dragon Ball Z series. As every true Dragon Ball Z fan knows the timeline of the TV series and the timeline of the movies do not go hand in hand. The movie ""Wrath of the Dragon"" serves the purpose of not only closure of the series, but also answers a peculiar question of one of the character, we see how does Trunks obtains the sword that he will later use to kill Freeza and King Cold.
As everything Dragon Ball Z is entretaining and exiting. Great fights, and great plot. Highly recomended.",1211846400,2,522,4.282828282828283
2582590,5,B000FS2VSQ,Ohhhh Dragons. Ahhhhh big yellow hair. Bang.,1197417600,,44,5.428571428571429
2582591,3,B000FS2VSQ,it's.....good great visial it needs more action more in depth and gohan become a ssj again 3.4/5 it's not worth buying unless you LOVE!! dbz,1188864000,,140,4.64
2582592,4,B000FS2VSQ,"Overall,despite some issues,this is a brilliant film. It looks gorgeous (especially when goku fires the super dragon fist and when tapion is summoned). Also, I think that the story is very strong and sort of mimics the majin buu saga, an ancient and very powerful evil being reborn. It even has a babi sort of character in it named hoi, the alien whio summens the monster hirudegarn.

The story could have happened in the DBZ universe. like fusion reborn it could have taken place in the ten years between the death of buu and the final episodes of dbz (when goku meets uub). Basically an old alien summons a huge monster called Hirudegarn. At first we only encouter the monsters legs and tail which gets beaten by gohan. Finally he is then complete when the upper half of hirudegarn is taken out of tapion, the hero who originally trapped him. The fighting then starts. Hirudegarn beats all he z fighters to the brink of death. Then goku turns ssj 3 and kills hirudegarn with a super dragon fist.

The fighting is amazing because hidergarn keeps appearing and disappering at will meaning the z fighters cant even touch him. My favourite fights are Vegeta vs Hirudergarn because its short, sweet and action packed. The next fight has to be ssj3 goku vs hirudergarn. Fans will like it because Hirudergarn throws a punch with a fist bigger than goku and goku just shrugs it off and smiles. Then he launches his dragon fist which looks amazing.

Howevor, there are some issues as I said before. Firstly, if you're watching it for the first time you'll find its quite a long time before the first fight but believe me its worth it. Secondly, if, like me you've seen all the movies you'll wonder where characters like piccolo and tien are. Neither of them have died and both of them would have sensed his huge power level - bizzare, it gives the impression that their scared or something. Finally and most importantly are the power levels of gohan and gotenks. Gohan appears to be in his mistic form and yet only seems to be as powerful as the characters who are super saiyan (goten and goku). Anyone who has seen the buu saga will remember how gohan took super buu apart so he should be on par with an ssj3. The same goes for gotenks who transforms into a ssj3 and after doing one of his super moves is defeated with one punch. Its like the creators have forgotten how powerful these guys are.

Despite these complaints the film is excellent and one of the most individual films.  The special features include character bios and trailers but its the film yuo will really enjoy. The music is also very could particularly when tapion attemps to banish hirudergarn.

Overall I would give this a huge thumbs up and consider this a must have for fans.",1176681600,,2742,4.585714285714285
2582593,5,B000FS2VSQ,"The last two DBZ movies along with the Trunks and Bardock specials are classics...I say this after watching the Funi-dubs and the subtitled ones.  The great thing about this movie is that it could fit into the Dragon Ball Z storyline (between the tournament saga and Buu).  Tapion, as the hero was great too. The story actually had time to developed (unlike the super 17 movie and the Brolly movies).

I am not going to give a summary of the movie just some observations.

1.  Watched the Japanese versions first, they contain the ORIGINAL audio and MUSIC, which was great for this one, the closing song...""If I can't do it...who will"" is much cooler than the generic DBZ music from Funi.

2.  The title ""Wrath of the Dragon"" does not match the actual movie.  The ""Dragon Punch"" was the closing move that kills the bad guy.  Goku does this move only once, as he appeared as SSJ 3.

3.  This is one of the few movies that does not have Goku doing a Kamehame ha wave or a Genki-dama (spirit bomb).  I find this refreshing.

4.  After watching this a few times, I realized that Trunks could have killed the monster using the sword (like tapion did originally), but Goku, in his cocky SSJ 3 mode, told him ""He's mine...I'll take care of this"".

5.  For a movie being based on his son, you do not see enough Vegeta.  I thought he was dead in this movie, until he appeared outside of the office building.

6.  See Adult Gohan not being able to go to SSJ 2 anymore frustrates me!  Is it just me but did they turn Gohan into a wimp after he met Videl. (At least he's not as weak as Teenage Goten in GT, that's down-right insulting!

Overall ""Exploding Dragon Punch!!! If Goku doesn't do it, Who can???"" was a visual treat.  Nice send off on Dragon ball Z Toryama-sensei.",1171497600,,1762,4.390092879256966

2582595,5,B000FS2VSQ,"This is by far one of the best DBZ movies, but unfortunately it is also the final.

If your a DragonBall fan I highly recommend this movie.

Watching Son Gohan battling the lower half of Hirudegarn in the middle of the city is just amazing,

And not to mention this is also where you get to see Son Goku use his Ryu-Gen (Exploding Dragon Fist) for the first time.

Definately 5 Stars",1168387200,4,383,4.277777777777778
2582596,5,B000FS2VSQ,This is the final DBZ movie and is by far the best of all. It is action packed.  It tells the story of how Trunks gets his sword. If you are a DBZ fan this is a must have.,1168300800,2,171,3.3846153846153846
2582597,4,B000FS2VSQ,"This was a grand addition to the family of DBZ films.  I enjoyed the large scale action and the intriguing plot, although I wish that Taipon would have fought once...oh well.  It still gets good reviews from me.",1168300800,2,211,4.526315789473684

2582599,5,B000FS2VSQ,"Finally came to Dvd this great movie...i`ve seen dragonball z since i was 8 years and its great...its a shame that in USA this anime came soo late,you lost the best because in my country came like about 10 years ago and this movie is the culmination of a great saga...Gotenks in level 3 , goku (as known as kakaroto in my country and in japan) gohan at full power, all the Z warriors at their best...i saw this movie like 8 years ago and when it cames to dvd a had no doubt about that you guys in USA will love it.

But wait is more...you guys in USA don't have them all, there is one more movie that was only launched on japan and in some places like my country, its  call ""Destroy the saiyans"" and its between the Cell saga and the Buu saga, and its a great movie too...so try to get it because all the movies of DBZ are great and have interesting histories and staff that helps to understand more about this ANIME.

If you have questions about more of this just write asking me.

(sory if a had bad words because in my country we don't speak english)

Well thats all so continue watching Dragonball z because its the best!!",1167177600,,1126,4.170506912442396

2582601,4,B000FS2VSQ,"If you're thinking of buying this DBZ movie ""Wrath of the Dragon"", I do recommend it. For anyone that is fan of the series, it brings some good action and fights. The story plot lacks a little effort to be interesting, and the whole progess of the movie goes by really fast. That's is why I give it only 4 stars. But if you do like DBZ and want to see good fights, then yeah buy this movie.",1163030400,,390,4.012820512820513
2582602,3,B000FS2VSQ,"this is the last dbz movie i have it, but it's not the best.  It mostly focus on Trunks beinag an only child, so thats boring.  But there are good fights in it",1162771200,,159,3.787878787878788
2582603,5,B000FS2VSQ,"It's fairly well known that the Movies never really fit in the Dragon Ball Z universe.  Granted one or two of them did so (Bardock, History of Trunks, Dead Zone) most of them were more of an ""Elseworlds"" tale.  Wrath of the Dragon fits in the tradtion of the ""Elseworlds"" tales, but also in a small way can fit into the DBZ universe itself.

Wrath of the Dragon is about a sorceror who tricks the Z fighters to release a legendary hero Tapion using the Dragon Balls.  The problem with this is that Tapion has half of an evil demon Hirudegarn.  As Tapion struggles with the demon, the other half of it starts creating chaos on earth.  Eventually the Z fighters learn the truth and attempt to destroy the beast.

This is one of the best Z movies, and is also one of the longest. The inner struggle with Tapion is realy well done, and the friendship he gains with Trunks is memorable.  This story is also quite a bit of a Trunks story as a few revelations are also revealed during this tale.  Overall this is one of the best Z movies, and is a great send off to a legendary series",1158969600,12,1077,4.266009852216749
2582604,4,B000FS2VSQ,"Well, here it is: the final DBZ movie.

Unlike most of the other DBZ movie releases, it seems like this one has been pretty well hyped through the commercials and the movie's general rep already. So I guess it makes sense that this disc come not in a regular black case, but a clear one with some okay art on the inside cover.

In general, the overall writing for FUNimation's dub as well as the original Japanese version is better than the average DBZ movies which are kinda lackluster and derivative. However, like most of the other DBZ movies this doesn't fit into the series' continuity, so don't even try and say otherwise.

For those of you in the dark, the movie focuses on an alien named Tapion who is considered a hero for sacrificing his body to seal up half of a giant beast-- Hildegarn (or as the dub calls him 'Hirudegarn'). It can only get better from here.

On a technical level, the video quality isn't exactly gorgeous in comparison to newer anime, but what do you expect from something made in'95?

As for ""extras"" we're given the same 'meh' FUNimation extras as usual: badly written character descriptions and some trailers for future releases.

In conclusion, this is a pretty good movie that's a must have for any DBZ fan, dubbie or subbie alike.",1158364800,2,1267,4.584070796460177
2582605,5,B000FS2VSQ,"It's hard to say goodby cause Dragonball Z had so many movie's but all good things must come to an end.

About the movie, The Z fighters have to fight an ancient monster called Hildegarn, who is used simply to cause terror around the galaxy. Gohan and Videl as the Great Saiyman & woman are the first who encounter this horrible beast - actually, only the legs and tail of the beast. They escape thanks to the fact that they can fly. I won't give too much away just see it.

After this movie hits store's, Funimation should start making a complete DVD box set collection with all 13 Dragonball Z movies.",1151625600,9,603,4.375
2582606,4,B000FS2VSQ,"One of a handful of stories written by Toei Animation worthy of the Toriyama original story. The film moves quick, the action is fun an intense, the characters are in full development (even the new addtions) and Dragon Fist! is just a kickass looking attack. One interesting point of the story is how it moves from one character to the next, being passed along, so it isn't focusing on a singular character. Something the other movies didn't really do. Because of this, it feels more like an American animated film (except in art style, naturally) and this brings my single complaint; It isn't long enough. The story could've been even better if played around with me. But I suppose Japanese children and teens don't have high enough attention spans... ?",1151452800,8,754,4.8076923076923075

8125758,5,B000FS2VSQ,"This is easily one of the best DBZ movies to date, even comparable (to a degree) to Battle of God and Ressurection of 'F'. It may not be canon like the latter 2 but has a great plot with awesome action sequences.

The plot revolves around a legendary tale of a disastrous monster who ravaged a far off planet who was sealed into the bodies of 2 brothers, and one one of the brothers, Tapion, has been awoken on earth which also releases the monster, Hirudegarn. Seemingly unbeatable, the Z-Fighters take to the battle field to help their new friend and save the world as they know it.

The inclusion of magic for the new additions to the franchise as a source of power is a breath of fresh air because it's a medium that was mostly only used for the original Dragon Ball movie series and adds a very respectable perspective on other sources of power to master as ki is for Goku and friends. Another thing that I find respectable is that while Goku is ever present in the movie, the focus is really centered on Trunks and Tapion while Goku serves a supporting role. Not that I wouldn't love to see more of him in the movie, but it shows that goku isn't the only defender in the universe and helps add depth to a new character and mythology within the series itself. Don't worry though, Goku shows his chops in the battle against Hirudegarn and is not a force to be reckoned with.

Where this is the last of the original series of movies and the fourth in the Buu Saga/former Final Saga in the series, it takes all the risks we needed to see in a once end of an era. Dragon Ball fanatics will love this movie and is a must have for your collection. 7 out of 7 Dragon Balls.",1447286400,,1671,4.264984227129338
