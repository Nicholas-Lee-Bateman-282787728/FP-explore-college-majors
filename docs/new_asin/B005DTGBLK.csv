4661819,3,B005DTGBLK,"Every year, about this time...I get into the Christmas spirit. Instead of all the trash I usually watch throughout the year, my attention turns to holiday movies. A good one leaves you feeling like you haven't wasted the last 2 hours of your life. The good ones are either funny, sad, romantic, or a combination of all of them. Most are pretty predictable. You pretty much know where they're going from the get go. It's up to the director and the writers to make the journey enjoyable for the viewer. Unfortunately, for me, this movie had none of those things. Emily is a career girl off on a business trip. Ben is at home waiting for her to get back, so they can get married. Right away, we know the whole movie is going to be about the journey. Romance is out, because they're apart for 98% of the movie. Sad is out, because no one is sick, dying, or losing their home. It's now up to the creators to make Emily's trip, and Ben's experience with the family...funny. I wish I could say it was a ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" experience, but it was far from it. I don't blame the actors. I blame the writers. The script was just plain boring all the way through. The cast did the best with what they had...",1322956800,8,1210,4.3584070796460175

4661822,2,B005DTGBLK,"They almost made me forget it was suppose to be a Christmas movie.  There were so many problems going on all the time I felt like I had been watching it for hours.  Way too many stupid situations for one movie.  I like Sarah Paulson a lot but the writers went way overboard on disasters happening to her on her struggle to get back to Denver for her wedding.  --Incidentally a big passenger plane can not land in Cheyenne, I lived there once.-- While some may enjoy this movie I found it too hectic for me.  The writers needed to let up on all the things that went wrong.  Also Dean Cain (another actor I enjoy), while his character on the surface was likeable can anyone imagine someone so aggressive, so demanding, with absolutely no regard for anyone else and so disrespectful to his employees -- other than Scrooge, but he was grouchy.",1416528000,2,839,4.450980392156863

4661830,4,B005DTGBLK,"It took me years to purchase this movie from Amazon because the pale gray cover/photo made the movie look so dated and uninteresting. However, I am glad I finally did purchase it because I enjoyed the movie very much and it is a much more modern movie that the cover suggests. It is a pretty traditional romantic holiday movie but around the holidays those type of movies are so nice to watch. Please ignore the poor cover and give this movie a try. It is worth it.",1390608000,2,465,4.35632183908046

4661833,3,B005DTGBLK,"It was an okay movie.  Funny but not side splitting.  It isn't one I would watch over and over.  Maybe a couple of times during the Christmas season.  I really liked Eric Mabius in How To Fall In Love.  That's why I got this one.  I find most of the actors when watching other movies then check them out online to see what other movies they have made and select more to watch. I find the best movies are the ones made just for TV.  Anyway, it's okay.",1374710400,,450,4.045454545454546

4661838,5,B005DTGBLK,"The movie was not bad.  It showed two people who were in love and one did not realize how important her husband to be was until she let her boss and job almost come between them.  But in the end real loves perseveres and that is what matters.  It's a family friendly movies, there was no indecent language which won rave reviews with me. It also showed when you are determined to do something or get somewhere you forget about everything else and ""just do it"".  My family and I thoroughly enjoyed it, Dr. Eason.",1324425600,8,511,4.347368421052631
4661839,4,B005DTGBLK,"Funny, funny....

The story about a ""Christmassy couple"", which does every important step in life at this special time of the year, works very nicely. The plot is filled with lot of very funny, heartwarming and droll scenes. It is three weeks before Christmas/Wedding. The bride named Emily (Sarah Poulson) is a sweet chick but stuck to her job and besides over organized and the perfect perfectionist. Her workaholic boss Tuck (Dean Cain) manages taking Emily away to work for 2 weeks, she travels 2000 miles leaving the groom named Ben (Eric Mabius) at home. He is stuck between a chaotic future mum in law (very funny playing Mimi Kuzyk), bridal showers and preparations for the perfect pre-organized wedding always the two - each day getting more nervous - families in his back. Will she be back at the right time?

This movie was first performed in 2006 on TV, and filmed in Halifax/Nova Scotia in Canada. It might not be ""the classic"" Christmas story, but it is very funny and catches you by all means. It is highly amusing and very well and naturally played and the characters are believable. Easily such a funny plot could change into something totally odd, but this story does not. You follow the protagonists with eagerness, joy and laughter and sometimes with some hidden tears in your eyes.
The prize of this DVD is not too bad, so you can do not much wrong buying and trying...;D.
I recommend this film for the most wonderful time of the year but also for before and after - it surely will amuse you....",1323648000,12,1516,4.652985074626866
8467465,4,B005DTGBLK,Super cute movie. I feel like Sarah Paulson was miscast though. She and Eric Marius didn't make for a convincing couple in my opinion. Still the story was enjoyable.,1510444800,,165,4.724137931034483

8467472,2,B005DTGBLK,"I ordered this solely for Sarah Paulson and felt embarrassed for her while I was watching it. She obviously made this picture for no other reason than paycheck and a lull in her career. It's an absolute dud. Not worth your time, not even for Paulson, who I'm sure would like to shove this one to the bottom of her resume.",1449187200,,321,4.278688524590164
