8338391,3,6303995896,"An ex-fiance comes back into Catherine's life.  Catherine is not terribly comfortable with this as we see from flashbacks that the breakup up was not particularly amicable.  Vincent is very uncomfortable with this as he  battles feelings of jealously.  He also worries for Catherine's safety as  he is haunted by ominous dreams of Catherine being in danger.
The notion  of an ex-fiance coming back into Catherine's life could potentially have  made a compelling episode, but unfortunately this episode goes off into an  unimaginative ""fatal attraction"" direction.
In 1998 I conducted  a poll among Beauty and the Beast fans asking them to rate the 44 episodes  of the first two seasons on a 1-to-10 scale.  31 fans participated.  ""Down to a Sunless Sea"" finished 36th out of the 44 episodes.
I  placed ""Down to a Sunless Sea"" 37th in my own personal  1-through-44 rank-ordering of the episodes.",916531200,13,894,5.034246575342466
