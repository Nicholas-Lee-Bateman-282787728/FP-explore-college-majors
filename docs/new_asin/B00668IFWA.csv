4961905,4,B00668IFWA,"""Overland Trail"" is one of those westerns that I not recall, perhaps its short life did not
 make it to Australia ?.
 The interactions between Bendix and McClure I found to be very entertaining, however one scene in
 the episode ""Perilous Passage"" I found to be a little disturbing.
 The stagecoach is used to transport Cole Younger for trial, at a way station Bendix is persuaded
 to let a sick lady travel with them, she turns out to be Belle Starr.
 When the coach stops for repairs the Marshall turns his back to her and receives a bullet
 in the back, my problem with the script at this juncture is that there is no demonstration of grief
 amongst all those who witnessed this, no one says a word about caring for the body,
 no more mention of that marshall in that episode.
 Perhaps that is a reason for the series short life, yes it is entertaining however was
 ""Overland Trail"" caring ?.",1340236800,,895,4.462962962962963
4961906,5,B00668IFWA,I was very pleased with my Overland Trail DVD set.  This set is a great addition to our collection of vintage TV shows.  Good shows like this one aren't made these days.  I wish there were more episodes available.  I highly recommed this DVD set to anyone who likes nastalgic TV shows.,1334707200,,285,4.423076923076923
4961907,5,B00668IFWA,I have really enjoyed watching this  series of The Overland Trail. I have always liked the two actors and I think they both did a good portrayal  of  Kelly and Flip. Doug McClure learned to ride as a young boy on a ranch and it helped in later years in the western movies he acted in.,1333238400,6,284,4.035714285714286
4961908,5,B00668IFWA,"This is another good western series released by Timeless Media Group. It stars William Bendix and Doug McClure.
Plenty of action in this series about the Overland Trail,a major stage route to the west all the way to the Pacific Ocean.
Willaim Bendix played the man in charge of the stage line with Doug McClure as his sidekick who had been brought up by indians. The two actors play of one another well. There are quite a few funny moments shared by the two actor's here like when the stagecoach almost sinks in the mud. Bendix exclaims it wasn't this deep the last time he came through,to which McClure retorts, ""were you standing in the saddle at the time"".Another episode has Bendix in the barber's chair with a very nervous  barber with a shaky hand after hearing gun fire outside.""I've calmed down now"" says the barber ""so I can now finish you off"" to which Bendix replies ""That's what I'm afraid of.
Another series that only lasted one season and should have lasted longer,but then Doug McClure would never have ended up in his most famous role as Trampas on ""The Virginian"".
I bought this series sight unseen and was happy I did.",1332115200,40,1136,4.596059113300493
4961909,4,B00668IFWA,"The ""OVERLAND TRAIL"" is an overlooked gem from THE GOLDEN AGE OF TELEVISION. It is rife with adventure, subtle humour, and themes that are worthy of reflection/discussion. The acting is first-rate and the scripts move the plots along at a good clip. My only complaint is there are only 13 episodes of this highly enjoyable show! Nevertheless, this DVD is good value for the price, and is a delectable addition to the DVD collections of those who appreciate the cavalcade of high-quality shows that pervaded TV fare of the late 1950's and early 1960's!",1331510400,,551,4.872340425531915
4961910,5,B00668IFWA,I have been looking forward to this title being released & I've not been disappointed. I saw the series when it was first broadcast over 50 years ago...seen nothing of it since. Timeless Media have done an outstanding job...I think the best yet. The LARAMIE series (especially the color seasons)were disappointing as this was my favourite western show. Congratulations to Timeless & keep them coming...are we to get full series of The Restless Gun?... as Cimarron City & Riverboat are soon to be released following parts of them coming out....following The Tall Man & Wells Fargo,1330992000,19,579,5.041666666666667
4961911,5,B00668IFWA,"if you grew up watching ""The Life of Riley"" on television, you'll find it difficult to watch these. Bendix plays a gunslinger that plays the role serious. Not that he wasn't a bad actor. He played it straight in the movie ""The Blue Dahlia."" Doug McClure, people will debate with me, isn't the best cowboy actor and how he got typecast in so many cowboy roles is beyond me. I was just never impressed with him. The series is light-hearted and not meant to be a straight, serious cowboy Western like ""Cheyenne."" The picture quality is beautiful. The price is a bargain. I remember paying $35 for a 16mm master of one of the episodes. Small tip: I discovered you need to watch the series in chronological order. Don't jump around from one DVD to another just because the titles are catchy. A couple recurring characters make more than one visit so you need to watch them in order.",1329955200,54,877,4.522012578616352

The quality of my DVD is not very good compared to many other shows I own. This is a big minus for me. It is a bit tireing to watch stagecoach rocking similar ways in each episode. These are obviously made in studio. Both main actors are likable, but I do not care about the Laredo-type bantering they have in each episode. If you like this, then the series is easier to like. The stories are O.K., but because of the light attitude between main actors, real excitement is lacking. Overland Trail is not a very serious business. Maybe it would have been better with a lot more comedy. Or a bit more tragedy. This is not nearly in the class of Gunsmoke, Have Gun or even Tate.",1354579200,3,814,4.1257861635220126
4961969,4,B00668IFWA,"I recently finished watching Timeless Medias' DVD box set of Overland Trail. It is a very enjoyable, much better than I expected. Doug McClure's ""Flip"" is just terrific and if you are a Virginian fan, then you will see the evolution of the Trampas character began here.

To me William Bendix was always Chester A. Riley in the ""Life of Riley."" So, it was a  bit disconcerting to see Bendix in a western. That said once I got over the obviously New Yorkish aspect of  the character, (explained away by simply stating that he is from the East,) it is pretty easy to enjoy his fish out of water aspect.

It is interesting to see them have Bendix constantly use a rifle adorned with a shamrock, apparently if the show had been successful, merchandising might have included a replica of the "" shamrock rifle"" on toy store shelves. I say this as a one time owner of a Daisy ""Lawman"" Winchester replica.

As it was, this mid season replacement lasted half a season, but back then that meant 17 episodes, which these days is almost a full season order and certainly more than what the cable networks  order for their successful series.

The  last episode is clearly a back door pilot for another series, there was only one episode that I thought was really bad, otherwise it is certainly worth the twenty bucks or so you'll spend on Amazon to sit down and watch this forgotten western that is really a showcase for Doug McClure's stardom in the sixties.
