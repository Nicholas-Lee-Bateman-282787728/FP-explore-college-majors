8338368,5,B001RNRHE6,"Beyond Glory was released in 1948. It starred Alan Ladd. A fine story of an officer at West Point,whois under interrogation after an incident with a plebe. Alan Ladd was at the peak of his stardom in this film. Fans of Alan Ladd will like this the most.",1477440000,2,253,4.291666666666667

8338370,3,B001RNRHE6,"5 stars for the movie. 0 stars for the lousy picture quality.  Alternately too contrasty with dirt, scratches, digs and splices, and abysmally murky.  Just as described elsewhere, you can barely make out the crucial battle flashback in Tunisia.  Unlike this mess, Get-TV movie channel presented a very nice restoration; which prompted me to seek out a DVD for my collection.  I only wish you could buy Get-TV's  remastering.  Alas and alack, you can't.

It's disgraceful that whoever now owns this terrific Paramount post-war psychodrama doesn't clean up a print and reissue it properly, to replace this public domain crap.  The film deserves to be seen by any movie lover from war buffs, to mystery-noir devotees, to romance fanciers, to chick-flick mavens.  It contains some of the best work of Alan Ladd as the guilt-ridden veteran who believes he is responsible for the death of his commanding officer, and perhaps the most touching performance of Donna Reed's career.

It is my fervent hope and wish that in near future someone come forward with a print of better image quality, but more importantly that this highly moving vintage 1940s flic not be lost and forgotten.  It is a true gem !",1460592000,4,1194,4.92
8338371,1,B001RNRHE6,This is a really bad copy of a good movie.  Its one of my favourite Alan Ladd movies but the quality of this bootleg DVD is not good.  I did manage to get a decent copy since i bought this one but I wish they would release it officially.  Its interesting also because it has the first screen part for Audie Murphy.,1269820800,,314,4.032258064516129
8338372,1,B001RNRHE6,"I strongly advise against buying this product, should it become available again or be offered elsewhere. It is not only the worst quality bootleg I have ever seen (parts of the recording are so deteriorated it is difficult to make out what happened), it is also the most overpriced. There seems to be at least one other version around, so one cannot even commend that it was made available at all. I would have given ""no star"" as rating, but that was not possible. I was rarely so annoyed, because the seller advertised this with a clip from one of the best parts of the recording, without stating what the rest looks like. Hence this is the only time I ever wrote a bad review, because I feel downright cheated.

Regarding the movie, which I won't go into detail on here, at least for fans of Alan Ladd, it is very interesting (even if it is not one of his best). I wish it were available on an official DVD.",1266624000,4,909,4.347058823529411
