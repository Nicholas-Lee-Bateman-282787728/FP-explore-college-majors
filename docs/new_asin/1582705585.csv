7997618,3,1582705585,"I loved Gail Thackray's book, Spiritual Journeys: Visiting John of God. In it she tells about the process of filming this documentary DVD. Sadly, the documentary does not live up to the description in her book (in my opinion). In the book, she describes the incredible energy of love present at the Casa, which everyone feels. She tells about incredible spiritual experiences during her healing on her first two-week visit to the Casa. More stories about her communication with spirit during her second visit gave me a better understanding of how spirit works to help us heal. The book gives an impression of Gail being a beautiful spiritual person, with her own special gifts and connection to divine sources. But in the DVD, she is portrayed as someone unsure about what to think about John of God. The worst thing about this film is that she fails to explain the reason why she felt so much pain during her physical surgery (which is highly unusual).

I had imagined that this DVD would be a great way to introduce others to the work of John of God, but I didn't even show it to my husband. It simply doesn't do a good job of portraying Medium Joao and the miraculous healings that happen at his Casa in Brazil.",1469923200,,1214,4.594470046082949
