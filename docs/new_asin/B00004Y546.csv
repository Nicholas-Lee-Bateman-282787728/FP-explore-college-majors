7926996,4,B00004Y546,"Meaning no disrespect to the honorable awards about to be mentioned, but honestly, is there a sporting trophy presented today that can truly compete with this majestic ""Holy Grail"" of hockey?

Major League Baseball? The first World Series champion was the 1903 Boston Americans, but in it's current form, the ""Commissioner's Trophy"" only dates back to the 1967 St. Louis Cardinals.

The National Football League? Coincidently, the ""Lombardi Trophy"" was first awarded the same year to the Green Bay Packers, and was not officially renamed after the legendary coach for 3 more years.

The National Basketball League? They awarded a similarly designed ""cup"" from 1947 to 1976, which was renamed the Walter A. Brown Trophy in 1964, that was redesigned to its current form in 1977, and renamed again in 1984 for departing commissioner Larry O'Brien.

Then there is tennis' hallowed Wimbledon Championship? Now the competition becomes stiffer as the Singles Champion trophy(s) date back to 1886/87. The Gentlemen receive a silver guilt cup while the Ladies are awarded a sterling silver ""Rosewater Dish"".

Another worthy contender is the America's Cup which is considered the oldest international sporting trophy. But seriously, England lost the grand ""Auld Mug"" the first year (1851) they awarded it to the upstart schooner ""America"". And let's not forget that given the multi-year format it has only been awarded 34 times.

The youngest of the aforementioned leagues, the NFL, has awarded the ""Lombardi"" 48 times. Again, I am not putting any of these trophies down, but rather, simply hoisting the historic Lord Stanley Cup above them all.

This excellent DVD, narrated by Dennis Leary*, gives an incredibly concise & informative look into this ""Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup"" that was first awarded in 1893 to the club from Montreal. And besides, if you consider yourself a true hockey fan, don't you want to someday pass the entrance exam given at the gates to Hockey Heaven?

* - Those people that say ""Oh, Dennis Leary, that's the comedian from Boston"" are wicked chuckleheads. He's actually from ""Wistah"". (Trans: Worcester, MA)",1453766400,,2129,5.204678362573099
7926997,5,B00004Y546,Great buy and good for understanding the highlights of hockey.  I would recommend to others.  Our town is a hockey town.,1369612800,,120,4.666666666666667
7926998,3,B00004Y546,"Highly recommended for a hockey fan. I'm not necessarily a hockey fan so can't give it more stars. Found much of the content interesting though. If it were redone and brought more current, I think it would be much better.",1361318400,,221,4.55
7926999,5,B00004Y546,was a very nice video it covered enough footage of the stanley cups through the years and beyond the most important,1333152000,,115,4.523809523809524
7927000,1,B00004Y546,"Have you ever watched mud dry?  Well I can guarantee that it might be more entertaining than this film.  A great idea lost by poor production quality, no story telling ability and strange production choices.

Good for the hockey fan who wants to catch some highlights.  Otherwise, good luck staying awake!",1152144000,,305,4.921568627450981
7927001,4,B00004Y546,"We are a hockey family - live and die by it - and have been without it for a year.  This is an excellent hockey special discussing the history of Lord Stanley's cup.  It is basically an ESPN special I think, so you are getting a TV show on a DVD.  But if you have wondered what the deal is with the cup, where it comes from, how do they fit on the names on it, why they hold it over their heads, and who is the guy in the commercial with the white gloves who is carrying it around -- it's a good show.",1127088000,3,501,3.7523809523809524
7927002,4,B00004Y546,Interesting info. but only runs about 50 minutes.  Not worth the price of admission I'd say.,1025654400,,92,4.75
7927003,5,B00004Y546,"Fans of hockey don't need to be reminded of how truly special Lord Stanley's Cup really is.  For many, winning the Cup is a dream, and the road to realizing that dream is long and arduous.  This documentary, hosted by Denis Leary, is a tribute to the history of the Stanley Cup, and the passion and dedication it takes to earn the right to hold the world's most famous trophy above your head.
Over the course of an hour, this film covers the roots of the Cup, the great hockey dynasties of the Habs and the Islanders, some of the best moments along the path to the Cup, some of the most heartbreaking defeats, as well as a chronicle of Cup history in the making.
Included on the disc are a slew of special features, the best being tense highlights from the '99 and 2000 Cup finals.
This is a must for any hockey fan.",1023408000,,816,4.258064516129032
7927004,4,B00004Y546,"If you are a hockey fan or even if you wonder why hockey fans are hockey fans, this is a pretty good DVD to add to your collection or to answer your questions.  While most of the footage included is of recent vintage, there is enough film of ""old time hockey"" to keep the long time hockey fans interested.  Denis Leary, who hosts the DVD, has the perfect personality to narrate this video, bringing the appropriate mixture of reverence and humor in leading the viewer from the history of the cup to its latest home in New Jersey.  During the 50 minutes of the DVD, the producers present some of the greatest performers during the playoffs as well as the Dynasties that have held the cup more times than any other teams.  In one of the more interesting segments presents what the cup means to NHL players, past and present, both who have been on Cup-winngin teams, and those who have fell short in this quest.  Another very interesting segment, the Cup's Escorts from the Hockey Hall of Fame discuss what happens to the Cup after the final game.
All in all, this was a very good DVD, the bonus footage of games 6 of the 1999 and 2000 finals allow the viewer to relive (or to experience for the first time) these two games that really presented what hockey is all about.  It also presents additional footage of some of the greatest players to play for this award.
I would, in a second, recommend this DVD to any hockey fan, either a casual fan or die hard.  It's well produced and doesn't leave out too much.  The only thing that could be improved is if it were longer.",972604800,20,1567,4.397923875432526
