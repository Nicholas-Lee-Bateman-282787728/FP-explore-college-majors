8217676,3,B000VA3JAC,"I loved the Fast Show, but truth be told, rehashing the same jokes again, and again, and again, gets old.  It's not Monty Python, which kept things shaken up and varied.",1495497600,,169,4.451612903225806
8217677,5,B000VA3JAC,"Some of the best British sketch comedy you'll ever be likely to encounter. Naughty tailors, a senile soccer commentator, and the world's unluckiest pensioner are just some of the great characters.",1384819200,,196,5.354838709677419
8217678,5,B000VA3JAC,"Pure classic English comedy. There will be nothing like it again. You can see Bits floating in from are you being served and Carry on films. Great sketches, Shame it only lasted a little while.",1362614400,,193,4.542857142857143
8217679,5,B000VA3JAC,"It's fantastic to be able to get this iconic show complete in one set of DVD's it is the kind of comedy you never get tired of watching, so many clever characters and sketches ,brilliantly  written to a consistently high standard . A must for any fan of comedy.",1325721600,5,261,4.326530612244898
8217680,5,B000VA3JAC,"I guess there's an element of ""love it or hate it"" to any comedy phenomenon and the Fast Show is no exception. For the unintitiated, the show was built around the short, quick-fire sketch with distinctive, memorable catchphrases. Sometimes these catch phrases were the only content of the sketch, were not intrinsically funny and the comedy was derived exclusively from the context and the frequent repetition of the phrase (""You aint seen me, right?"" or ""This week, I'll be mostly...""). More often, the sketch was more developed than this and presented real comedy, often in a slapstick or absurdist vein (Chanel 9, Suit You) and some of the sketches relied on a (slightly) more subtle element of pathos (Unlucky Alf or the legendary Ralph and Ted).

If all this seems a little old hat, it's worth remembering that the first series aired in 1994 and the last in 2000, so it is indeed old hat. If it seems tired, well, at the time it was a lot fresher than it appears to be now and 10 years is a very long time in comedy. While the show can't be considered to be a true ground breaker - Monty Python did much the same sort of stuff, several decades earlier - it certainly set the standard for its own period and garnered a devoted following.

However, for those of us who grew up (metaphorically, in my case) with Competitive Dad, Swiss Toni and Jazz Club, this is the one to buy. As far as I can tell this contains ALL the Fast Show material ever aired - the four series, several Xmas Specials, a collection of sketches that didn't make the main series and, a documentary. There should be enough there to keep you going for some time to come and it's a real gem.

For those who have yet to sample the delights of Arthur Atkinson, Johnny Nice Painter and the 13th Duke of Wymbourne, you may want to try it on for size before you buy it (the second series is probably the best), but with seven discs of stuff, you can't go wrong, can you? After all, watching comedy is very much like making love to a beautiful woman. You have to take her out of the box, slip her gently into the slot, turn on the power and have a good laugh.
