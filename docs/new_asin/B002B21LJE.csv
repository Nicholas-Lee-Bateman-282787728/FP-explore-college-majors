8360599,4,B002B21LJE,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

I first tried a workout by this instructor on a Exercise TV compilation DVD and like his workout enough to buy this.  This is pretty much the same moves, longer workout.  Instructor is high energy but manages to be non-annoying and gives decent cues.  I use one of my kettlebells in place of the ball and it still works ok.  Main thing, sweated buckets and got a good cardio workout on top of the weight moves.

I think the biggest downside to this for me was the music.  It was weird.  Sometimes it would be regular upbeat exercise music, then during active cardio reps, it would switch to slow jazz flute or sax or something.  Not motivating to keep pushing your hardest.  A minor con is that the background dancers kept changing and largely they seem to be everyday people --- that sounds bad, but what I mean is that their form doesn't always look very good or very together and I don't want to see that, I want to see the correct form that I need to emulate.  I just watch the instructor instead, though, so a minor con.  I guess some people like that so they feel the workout is relate-able and do-able for anyone and not just professionals but I would rather have people that motivate me to work my way up and become tougher rather than people who are just struggling as much as I am.",1306627200,3,1347,4.365461847389558

Second, I've actually had the pleasure of being personally trained by Michael Carson for 2 months back in 2007 in Los Angeles, well before this DVD came out, but the workout we did was very similar to this DVD.  Let me be clear however that this review is 100% genuine, and I was not hired, paid, or asked to review this product in any way.  In fact, the months I worked out with basically this same workout, I went from 212 pounds to 190, and I didn't even change my eating habits!!!!  However in the last few years I've taken a deskjob, eaten way to much fast food, and I'm at 235lbs.  I started looking for a workout to do at home like the one I did with Michael because everytime I went to the gym, I was wishing I could be taking a class from Micheal doing this workout, so I went to the internet to see if I could find something similar and BAM! Low and behold I happend upon this DVD and I couldn't have been more excited.  I already knew how amazing and effective this workout would be, so I purchased it immediately.  I've been doing the workout once a day for 4 days, and I've already lost 5 pounds, and I've only moderatley changed my diet in these first 4 days, if that's any indicator of just how good a workout this is.

So let me get to the DVD review specifically, if you're looking for something to really get you to drop weight, melt fat, and especially tone your core, and NOT just that but also really get a full body work out, THIS is the workout DVD to get, hands down.  Forget P90x and all of the other beachbody stuff that costs 100's of dollars.  Get just as good of a workout without going overboard, for way less.

Another good note is I have lower back problems and it's hard for me to do regular crunch's or situps, and pilates is too hard on my fragile back.  This workout really makes it easy to focus on your entire core, without some of the more strenous exercises, but don't think for a second that means the workout is compromised.  I think ANYONE could do this workout and benefit immensely.

There's 3 parts to the DVD.  A section where you learn the moves in detail and Michael very easily but thouroughly explains the workout, and the benefits, and any other misc. info.  The second and third parts are two different workouts, the SEXY 7, and the Extended Sexy 7 Cardio workout.  Don't hold me to exact times, but the first is just under 20 minutes and the second one is almost 30 I believe.  I'm so into it I keep forgetting to look at the DVD time readout as I go.  If the workout was 2 hours, I'd probably do it the whole time without even realizing.

I get as sweaty doing this as I did training for a half marathon, or any other workout gym, pilates, or cardio that I've tried.  Michael's a great trainer as well to watch and listen too, never cheesy, or over the top, he does the best job I've seen of anywork out DVD keeping you motivated, explaining the motion and reasons for each move without going overboard, and keeping it fun!!!!!  You feel like he's really talking to you, not just genric,and that you're in the room, having a great time.  A note to new buyers, since purchasing this standalone DVD and coming back to review, I saw that there is also a package deal with the ball, plus other equipment and ANOTHER DVD!!!  I can't review that one yet, but I'm sure it's just as good, if not better, so consider that purchase as well per your needs!

My only note to the DVD Production Crew is if Michael does another DVD, it'd be great to have audio options to have the included music, or no music but still with voices so you could play your own music at home.  A good compromise is that the music on the DVD isn't too loud, so you could probably blast your own tunes at home and still hear the voices.  I like to change up the music I workout to.  I guess a good con for a workout DVD to have is when it doesn't have to do with the workout at all!  Wait, what are you doing still reading this review?  Buy it already!!!

Thanks Michael!!!!!!!!!",1283040000,3,4100,4.249032258064516
8360601,5,B002B21LJE,"In July 2009, I was in San Diego working out a resort when I saw Michael Carson on a local TV news station.  He was demonstrating one of the 'moves' in the DVD and followed along at the gym doing four sets of 20s on each side.  The next day I was so sore!

I decided to take the 'one move' that I learned and incorporated it into my work outs. After two months, I decided to purchase the DVD. I have been doing the 15 minute session for the last four weeks.  Have not advanced to the cardio portion yet. The members at the gym have noticed my physical changes and I have referred them to this DVD.  The ironic part is that I am 10 pounds heavier from last year, my hips and abs are remarkably tighter.  My training routine involves pilates (which I have done for over four years - at least twice a week), working out four times a week (30 sets per bodypart) and until recently, the Sexy 7!  I don't do cardio, but my workouts are cardio based.

No other workout routine that I know hits the core as effectively as Michael Carson's movements. If you want to reshape (reduce) and strengthen your abs, hips, glutes and legs, this is the video for you.  By the way, I'm 48 years old and a former competitive bodybuilder.",1260144000,9,1216,4.206896551724138

8360603,5,B002B21LJE,"Get Sexy! Learn, Firm and Tone with Michael Carson is an excellent workout.  You really work your abs and waistline with this workout.  He is pleasant and easy to follow.  I sweated like crazy.  It has three workouts.  The first is learning the moves.  The second is cardio (16 minutes) with the seven moves plus floor ab work; and the third is cardio (24 minutes) with toning.  I love them all.",1253232000,4,395,4.47887323943662
