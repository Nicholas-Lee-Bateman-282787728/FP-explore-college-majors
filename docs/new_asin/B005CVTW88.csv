8465979,5,B005CVTW88,One of my favorite cartoons as a kid. I don't care how old I get - I still want to watch Rugrats! This is a Halloween special with Chuckie being dressed up as a werewolf/werewuff. Angelica being bad and the gang all there. Also some extra episodes from the series. Super cute.,1485043200,,276,4.326923076923077
