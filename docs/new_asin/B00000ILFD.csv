7910685,1,B00000ILFD,"i love coward  and collect everything i get my hands on
i see every play possible and every movie of his
but this  is  a real problem
it should be avoided  unless you must have every coward program that exists
its pretty bad",1217635200,,224,4.1395348837209305
7910686,3,B00000ILFD,"This is a must-have for Coward fans if only as a curio--but it's not really great work. Several of the artists seem not to understand what's going on in the songs. (For example, Vic Reeves, in ""Don't Put Your Daughter On The Stage, Mrs. Worthington,"" makes the mistake of saying ""She was as lovely as Peer Gynt"" instead of ""She was lovely as 'Peer Gynt'""--obviously not bothering to find out who or what Peer Gynt is, nor how to pronounce ""ingenue."")

Texas' version of ""Parisian Pierrot"" is excellent, and so is Marianne Faithfull's poignant rendition of ""Mad About The Boy,"" but the real highlight is the Pet Shop Boys' cover of ""Sail Away"": meticulous phrasing; a wonderful short guitar solo that you could imagine being performed by The Shadows; clever use of nautical sound effects. Coward himself would have hated it but I love it.

There are more misses than hits on this CD--but again, it's worth adding to the library if you're a Cowardophile.",1191974400,2,952,4.763636363636364
7910687,5,B00000ILFD,"This tribute concert video/dvd (and CD album version)were the brainchild of Neil Tennant.  Tennant, the lead singer of the Pet Shop Boys, has always admired Coward.  Tennant's songwriting reflects this fact.
This  outstanding gala event celebrates the life of Britain's most talented  songwriter & playwright.  This video presentation merges modern covers  of his most famous songs - made more potent with speeches and video  montages.
The performances by The Divine Comedy and Suede outshine the  headliners!
This DVD/Video is very entertaining and informative.  It's  perfect for Coward fans, Pet Shop Boys fans, and everyone else in  between.
* note:  there is a second Pet Shop Boys tune on the programme  that is not listed on the tracklisting.  I'd say what it is, but that would  spoil the fun.",935884800,15,801,5.1484375
