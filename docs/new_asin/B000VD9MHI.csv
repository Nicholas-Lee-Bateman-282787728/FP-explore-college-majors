2936440,5,B000VD9MHI,"Our homeschooled 13 year old boy wanted to do this program and he loves it. Having experienced American Government by Standard Deviants we couldn't imagine that we would be wasting our money. I would not recommend this for a 13 year old unless they are advanced in their studies. For my next child, I'll wait until she would be a high school level. His younger siblings (10, 8, and 6) LOVE to listen in and discuss the things they understand already. Standard Deviants never fails to entertain while teaching.",1242950400,3,509,4.730337078651686
2936441,5,B000VD9MHI,"At age 35, I decided to change careers and go into the medical field.  I bought this video to get me started in my first college anatomy course.  It was not only a great tool in learning but it also made it fun.  My 14 year old daughter has now taken them in her possesion.  She loves them as much as I do.  These videos are not only helpful to young adults but for older adults as well.  We also have this series for the course in algebra.  They offer a wide range of videos that have helped me to return to college after all these years.",982108800,9,539,3.9813084112149535
2936442,5,B000VD9MHI,This video was awesome! It great how everything was made so clear and simple! I would recommend this video to all who want to learn the anatomy or those who simply need to review the material! I have told all my class  mates about this one-Its a winner!,931996800,12,253,4.270833333333333
8218143,5,B000VD9MHI,"I took an EMT course awhile back , I was 42 then . The instructor said the course tests was 80% anatomy and the rest hands on . I was the oldest one in class , even older than my instructors . I never took anatomy in school and found these videos to be helpful . My test score averages was 95% , the only one who was higher than me was a paramedic who was doing a refresher course an he was 98 % on his scores . These videos made learning easy and fun !",1521072000,,453,3.6804123711340204
8218144,2,B000VD9MHI,I thought it was a video that explain the systems in a simple way.,1497312000,,66,3.7857142857142856

8218148,5,B000VD9MHI,Very helpful geology program - good review for tests - good for all ages - slightly silly (but still very effective).,1384473600,,117,4.619047619047619
8218149,5,B000VD9MHI,"I bought this Anatomy learning product 10 yrs ago when I went back to
college.  My grade went from a ""B"" to an ""A"".  The fun visual techniques
used helped my memory when it came to taking exams.
  Now my daughter is in college so I decided to get the DVDs for her.
She loves them and noticed a big difference with taking her college exams.
Both Vol. 1 & 2  are a must have if you want to retain what you study!",1363046400,3,410,3.891566265060241
8218150,5,B000VD9MHI,"i purchased this because we own some of the Standard Deviants videos and have watched others. As always, the cast gives bite-sized bits of information in a humorous manner. My kids watch these over and over again.",1357689600,,213,4.783783783783784
8218151,5,B000VD9MHI,"I watched this for help with Anatomy and Physiology. It is clear and easy to follow. They give some hints on how to remember things and keep all of the information straight. The part about the facial bones actually helped me on my big final exam. They do a lot of silly stuff including puns as well as little bits of song and dance, but all of that helps with the recall later. Since it's a DVD, you can go to the section you need. For instance, I wanted to go over the nervous system, again, and was able to review that information quickly and easily. Of course, I do read in college, this is just another way to get that information in the brain. It helps! I recommend it!",1287878400,3,674,4.1923076923076925
8218152,1,B000VD9MHI,I ordered this well over two months ago.  I still have not received it.  If I get it I am sure it will be as outstanding as all of standard deviants products.,1283385600,,158,3.90625
