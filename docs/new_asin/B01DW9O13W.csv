7725187,5,B01DW9O13W,Awesome show and also a great job with the production of the disk.  Camera work also very good.  If you have enough interest in this music to read this review then you will certainly not be disappointed with this purchase.  Great Stuff !!!,1473552000,,239,4.511627906976744
7725188,4,B01DW9O13W,"This is an odd one. The Bluray is region locked, so you'll have to do some playing around if you want it to play on your computer. The performance itself was done well musically, very well in fact. This is one of the better concept albums ever released, and the musicians and singers certainly do it justice. Jermain van der Bogt owns the whole performance. Man that guy is talented. Watch this just to hear him outclass everybody else up there. And everybody else does amazing, it is no small feat. The backing band is fantastic, they're spot on through the whole performance.

It is weird things like production choices that bring the immersion this tries to provide down. The biggest issue? There are multiple guys in the choir who just have t-shirts on. One guys' is beige with super gaudy designs on it. In a production that was meant to go to video, and even for the sake of the audience, I can't believe nobody said ""lets get these guys a different shirt."" I thought for a while that maybe there was some reason these guys were featured so prominently, yet looked like they just walked in off the street, but I can't think of one. There was obviously major thought put into the costumes, yet this just sticks out like a sore thumb. Totally crazy.

The camera work is fairly poor, as well. In another questionable production choice, they show the backs of props that were never meant to be seen. So the Dream Sequencer machine at the end of the video? Yeah, that is all plywood and screws. We all know it was, but it could have been so easy to show just what the audience was intended to see, and still have the cameras be dramatic and entertaining. They show closeups of the body of ""Me"" on stage, and he looks to be some foam mannequin. No effort at all was put into hiding that. They could have done a wig, even.

If you can look past those things, this is very enjoyable, and it really does the material justice.",1473033600,3,1922,4.423728813559322
7725189,5,B01DW9O13W,The sound mix is excellent and the performances are flawless. If you're a fan Ayreon or musical theater then this is worth every penny.,1472860800,2,135,4.666666666666667
7725190,5,B01DW9O13W,"I bought this because I am a huge Ayreon fan and I loved the Human Equation.  Well I must say that it is everything I hoped it would be and more.  It has to be seen to be appreciated, just listening to the CDs is a mere fraction of the experience.  The performance of Marcela is just amazing.  That being said, I am unable to view the BluRay in my player because, unlike what Arjen may have said, this disk IS REGION LOCKED.  I don't know what I am going to do with the set, I really like the art book and don't want to send it back, plus I have not seen the 5 disk set available in Region A yet.  My guess is I will wait and pick up the BD alone at a later date, perhaps used.

Helpful hint, if you find yourself getting overwhelmed keeping track of the characters and some of the lyrics - turn on the subtitles - works great.",1468886400,4,827,3.9457831325301207
7725191,5,B01DW9O13W,"Ayreon certainly needs no introduction. Most familiar with Arjen Lucassen and his numerous musical identities know that, for the most part, Ayreon has been a studio phenomenon. Yes, there have been a few Ayreon songs to appear in a Star One or Stream of Passion performance, but for years fans have cried for a live incarnation of this progressive act. Almost 20 years into the bands career the wish has become a reality. Not surprisingly, Arjen chose The Human Equation  the bands most accessible and universally embraced output - as the material for Ayreons live/theatrical debut. How would he make it happen? Would he be able to assemble the original cast? Would the live version capture the magic of the studio recording? Or would the original even translate into a live conception? Most importantly, though  would The Theater Equation capture and expand upon the original musical concept in a way that would bring a more robust and a more human expression to the story? In other words, would this production make The Human Equation come to life in a way Ayreon was never able to convey through the music alone? For me, the answer to all of these questions is a resounding yes. Is this a perfect theatrical production? No. Is this the perfect incarnation of all that Arjen hoped to convey with the original The Human Equation? While only he can answer that question, I would say yes. Having followed Arjens work from inception, The Theater Equation perfectly represents everything brilliant and artistic and insightful about the multi-faceted, multi-instrumentalist, multi-vocalist family that is Ayreon.

The Cast
Nearly 2 years from conception to performance, The Theater Equation would only become a reality with the great support from dedicated production managers, artists, musicians and well, lets face it, the original cast. To make matters more complex, Arjen himself had no interest in playing his best friend part. Miraculously, of the original cast, only Devin Townsend (Rage) and Mike Akerfeldt (Fear) were unavailable (and of course Mike Baker (Father), R.I.P.). But Anneke van Giersbergen  who was working with Arjen on The Gentle Storm project at the time  agreed to play Fear and Arjen and crew were able to recruit Mike Mills (The Father in Theory of Everything) from Australia to play Rage and Father. The young and talented Jermain van der Bogt filled in for Arjens role as Best Friend. Also, there are expanded roles on this version  the doctor, the nurses and the mother given a more impactful presence. Each one of them is also a member of the Epic Rock Choir, but their contributions stand out on this theatrical version giving the story a much more real life feel.

The Band
Joost van den Broek  who has played with Arjen for years  was recruited as musical leader/director, and he has done a brilliant job with not only selecting a core of musicians familiar with Arjens music, but also with the way in which he has incorporated the Epic Rock Choir into the music of The Human Equation. Ed Warby, long time drummer for Arjens projects, anchors this talented group, and (for those interested in this kind of minutia) only Warby and flutist Jeroen Gossens appeared on the original release (and van den Broek of course on keys). Nevertheless, the band is the foundation that makes this whole thing work  they are engaging and consistently solid throughout both visually and of course musically. Ed Warby is a pleasure to watch because he appears remarkably relaxed as he rips through these complex tunes. The multi-instrumentalist approach works here as the violin, guitar, keys, woodwinds and drums just rock it with passion and precision.

The Epic Rock Choir
One of the most fascinating aspects to this project, the choir is a group of vocalists who were recruited as understudies to the main characters. These vocalists were able to enjoy months of practice in their roles with the band and production crew. They essentially learned the movements and vocal parts so that when the original singers came in a week before the show, the understudies were integral in getting the main actors up to speed. In the documentary, James LaBrie says that these guys were actually essential in making the whole thing come together in such a short period of time. And although they play a supportive role for the main performance, these guys and gals (really comes out in the bonus material documentaries) could have easily stepped in to play the main characters if called upon by circumstance.

The Music
Act I was expanded from the original with 3 new reprises  Reprise Pain 1, Reprise Childhood and Reprise Pain 2  the latter brilliantly introducing and transforming into the iconic ""Day Eleven: Love."" ""Day 4: Mystery"" also includes an expanded choral section which echoes the choruses of the lead singers. Act II has 4 reprise sections  Vigil, School, Pain 3 and Trauma. These reprises really enhance the story in my opinion by simultaneously expanding the story while emphasizing recurring musical themes with different voices. The recording quality is extremely good and the 5.1 mix works extremely well. Each vocalist stands out in the mix, although Anneke and Irene are a little harder to understand because of their singing styles. Overall, this ""new"" version of The Human Equation is excellent.

The Costumes/Stage Set
How do you transform this kind of story  which takes place mainly within the main character's mind  into a stage based rock opera? The 3 tiered stage is fixed throughout the show, so there are no moving parts. This may seem like a bit of a letdown to some but if you consider a limited budget combined with the limited time the actors had to learn their stage environment I think it makes the most sense. Its cool how the car and the hospital bed represent the central focus. I think the costumes are somewhat cheesy and retro 80s 90s, but I suspect this was on purpose. Again, the emphasis of Ayreon has always been the music and the concept and not the visual, so I think the costumes, while a bit stereotypical theater, are all part of the larger equation. Too much complexity may not only have been impractical but it may have ruined the emphasis on the music and brilliant interplay of the different ""emotions.""

The Performance
Near perfection. Really, Im not sure how else to describe something executed at this level which was conceived in such a short time. And when you consider the main players only had one week with the band and stage set to perform  needless to say, its an astounding testament to the talent and commitment of the performers and to the understudies and all of the folks involved with the pre-production work. Of the original vocalists, of course, James LaBrie deserves mention. In lieu of Dream Theaters The Astonishing  where he plays all of the characters  it is astonishing how he blends in with all of the other characters here so seamlessly and so humbly. It is especially nice to see Eric Clayton (Saviour Machine) in the live setting again  he is so powerful, dynamic and passionate with his voice of reason. Heather Findlay (Love) is exceptional as well and for singers like Irene Jansen (who haven't been in bands or productions for years) it is amazing to see her passion and talent soar here. Devon Graves (Agony) is exceptionally good as well. I was not as familiar with his music but his theatrics and body dynamics come across with strength  he really injects a lot of energy and personality into his emotion. Marcela  who was a rookie find for Arjen way back when  has matured into an amazing singer in her own right. And while Magnus doesnt have quite the stage presence as some of his peers, his vocal performance has a cementing quality  so important for the familiarity of the original conception. Of the new singers, Anneke seems to have the biggest leap to make as Fear, but she puts forth a solid and convincing, yet slightly awkward performance. Mike Mills is fabulous  his energy, his Devin Townsend theatrical bent and his vocal diversity just perfect for Rage and Father. While I loved Mike Bakers Father, Mills nails it! Finally, Jermain van der Bogt wins an award for best supporting actor in this piece. Even though Arjen has never thought of himself as a singer, filling his shoes is no easy feat. I love the interplay between Bovio, van der Bogt and LaBrie. And lets not forget the Epic Choir. These are the secondary actors here but every one of them could have played their lead characters  their contributions in the transition/reprise sections of the production are invaluable and serve to make The Theater Equation an even more epic event compared to its studio predecessor. Oh yeah, the band brings it too!

The Video
Despite the lack of the huge budget stage production Theater delivers a very visually appealing and engaging performance for home viewing. Yes, the lighting is a bit dull at times  I thought it would be brighter. Sometimes the camera shots are a bit hard to figure out, but at least they are not jumping around every 3 seconds like so many live video recording these days. Of course, nothing can replace actually seeing a show like this live. But remember, Ayreon is about the music, the story, the drama. Arjen never asked anyone to bring this show on the road, but for those of us who have been following this band for a long time, The Theater Equation is a phenomenal incarnation, incredibly inspiring and extremely satisfying given the lower budget and the short time to prepare. The BD disc is high quality, with some great bonus content. The 30 minute try-outs performance highlight reel is most insightful in that you can see how well prepared the understudies were to deliver when called upon. The documentary is mostly hosted by Joost van den Broek, but provides enough detail about the passion and work that went into this production. Oddly, Arjen is absent during the videos and the curtain calls  making his only appearances at the end of the main performance and briefly behind Ed Warbys drums during the curtain call. I guess hes a humble guy.

The Artbook
This version contains the 2 DVDs/ the BD and the 2 music CDs in a 48 page hard-bound book. Filled with high quality photos of the main cast and scenes from the performance, a nice synopsis of the feature concept and expanded liner notes chronicling the work behind this production, this is the edition most fans and collectors will want to grab. Interestingly, the BD version didn't work on my updated PS3 but did work on the PS4. No frame freezes or lags between the audio and video. Not the highest quality Ive seen by any means, but very good. The CDs sound really good too  no over compression. (Note = Inside Out informed me that the original BD is defective  its region specific  but a new BD disc is to be shipped at a later date.)

Overall, The Theater Equation is probably everything we could ask for and more from Ayreon. Sure, with a bigger budget and more time, more elaborate sets this might have been more spectacular, but I think Arjen accomplished everything he could hope for with this release and far more than most of us fans ever dreamed.",1466121600,9,11161,4.818514644351464
7725192,3,B01DW9O13W,"The sound on the entire Blu-Ray is of pretty good quality, both in terms of mixing and recording. Good use of the possibilities of 5.1 speaker setups too, the back and center channels are actually getting some good integration while not overusing them to the point of ridiculousness.

But the video...sorry guys, but did you just pick random strangers from the street to work the cameras? Because it sure looks that way. There are amateur errors all over the material - people walking out of frame, heads cut off, stupid zooming all the time, half the characters are totally out-of-focus, and in many scenes you can literally feel the camera guy's anxiety because the image is shaky as hell since the dude didn't get the obvious idea to keep his hands off the camera handle while he's not moving it. It seems as if the camera guys had no idea and no clear plan about who does what job and who keeps a focus on which characters in which scenes. They were basically zooming around all the time on whatever they thought was interesting in just that moment. It even seems as if they had never seen the play before they had to record it.

And worst of it all, the person cutting all of this together didn't manage to cover up ANY of this afterwards. Worse even, he added a whole slew of own amateurish mistakes: cutting every three seconds (which is especially annoying when he randomly got his hands on a piece of pretty good material - but doesn't seem to notice that, since he switches to another, much worse camera angle nevertheless after a maximum of 4 seconds have passed, like someone gave him a rule to never keep any camera on screen for more than four seconds), using stupid fading transitions way too often instead of clear cuts, not syncing his cuts to the music AT ALL, and generally the cutting is way too hasty, especially in most of the more quiet and/or slow parts of the musical track which would work much better if the cutting style would respect the calmness JUST LIKE THE SINGERS ALSO DID BY PLAYING THESE PARTS APPROPRIATELY!

I am so glad to have seen this live, because the bad imagery definitely destroys much of the spirit and brilliance of this masterpiece!",1466121600,13,2181,4.572890025575448
8757015,4,B01DW9O13W,"This Blu Ray is NOT region free... even though it is listed as such.  It would only play on one of my four blu ray players.

The content is awesome musically and you can see they worked hard to put this show on.  Seems like recording it for a video was an afterthought.  The video production seems like it was recorded on iPhones by the audience or people off the street. Seriously, its that bad.  Also, the lighting of the stage was too dark and sometimes singers were completely in the dark.  Not sure that was meant to be like that.

Overall, this is still a very well done musical.  If this would have had professional Broadway production, the Theater Equation would be able to hold its own up against any musical and be known worldwide.  Sadly, only those in the know have heard of Ayreon.",1531180800,,794,4.383561643835616

8757017,5,B01DW9O13W,"Ever since I first heard The Human Equation album, I imagined what it would be like as a live performance.  To say that I'm pleased with the result is quite an understatement.  I love this music so much and I am incredibly happy to see it given the grand production it deserves.  It's awesome that so many of the original musicians were able to get together for this performance, and seeing their faces and mannerisms adds an entirely new dimension to the story.  I dearly wish I could have attended one of these shows, but I found out about them after it was already over.  However, I'm so glad it was captured in this format.  Thank you Arjen for making this all possible!",1517443200,,674,4.439024390243903

8757020,5,B01DW9O13W,"I have to admit, this performance is a dream come true for an old prog-rocker like me. Ever since Arjen Lucassen's album, ""The Human Equation"" was released in 2004, this great work has cried out for full dramatic treatment, yet it hasn't happened for various reasons (explained in the liner notes) until now.  The new live version is a magnificent achievement, all the way from the arrangements (masterfully reduced to 9 players by Joest van den Broek), to the singing (most of the original cast returning) to the staging (a ""unit"" set, with a real car, hospital bed, and imaginative lighting).  There are a few hiccups, but mainly because Arjen Lucassen was, in effect, creating a new art form with this work, a fully functional and dramatically cogent rock opera.

It certainly helps to have back almost all of the stellar original cast, a tribute to the very special nature of this event.  Back is James LeBrie in the central role, sounding better here (and on the 2004 album) than he has on any of the Dream Theater albums (I think Lucassen's lyrical style suits him to a tee). Also back are all three of the gorgeous women singers (Marcela Bovio, Heather Findlay, and Irene Jansen, sister of new Nightwish lead singer Floor Jansen and sounding every bit as good), Magnus Ekwall, Devon Graves and the booming bass of Eric Clayton.  Only the incredible voice of Mikael Akerfeldt (Opeth) is missed, but his role of ""Fear"" is ably represented by Anneke van Giersbergen.  Also new to the party is Ayreon veteran Mike Mills, who I think sounds even better than the people he replaced (the great song ""Loser"" is a real highlight).

As for the band, Lucassen himself played about 90% of the instruments on the original album,  which of course is impossible live. (Lucassen, in fact, does not play or sing at all in the live show.)  The one holdover from 2004 is drummer extraordinaire Ed Warby, which is critical to its success.  Warby has been the drummer for almost all the Ayreon albums, and has a unique style which is a huge factor in the ""Ayreon sound"".  Arranger Van Broek and the rest of the band do a remarkable job of recreating the magic of the original album.  The sound of the keys and guitars seem dead on, and there are very few ""holes"" where you feel that parts are missing.  Lead guitarist Marcel Coenen even seems to have mastered the idiosyncrasies of Lucassen's guitar playing, down to the odd ""bending"" of notes from below.  Even the original improv key and guitar solos are usually treated literally - Given this, it was a shame that no one tackled the incredible (and I do mean incredible!!) original Hammond solo by Ken Hensley on ""Loser"".  But, this is a small point.

A great addition in the live version, not in the original, is a 20 voice choir, which pays dividends on several songs, especially ""Pain"", ""Love"", and ""Loser"".  Van Broek even saw fit to give the choir several ""reprises"" not on the original album, all of which are effective.  It is a strong group full of good voices (some of whom served as understudies to the main roles) and their enthusiasm and sheer joy at performing this great music is infectious to watch, adding greatly to the impact of the whole.  Again, as a small negative, I wish that ALL of the backup vocals could have been covered, rather than about 50% of them - with that many good voices on the stage, it would seem to have been not only possible, but actually a ""no brainer"".

The Bonus DVD is also fascinating, for those that enjoy such things (I do!).  ""Behind the Scenes"" features interviews with many of the artists (strangely not Lucassen or Warby), lots of backstage footage, and gives a good idea of the huge scope of the project.  My favorite, though, is the ""Try Out Show"", a 1st run-through of the show with the understudies taking the leads.  Of course the singing is not as spectacular, but their passion and unbridled joy brought tears to my eyes.  Their performance is unfortunately cut on the DVD - I was upset whenever they skipped to a new song!  The 48 page, hard cover, full color book (11"" by 11"", about the size of an LP) is also very well done, featuring many stunning photos of the production.  There are not many super/deluxe editions that are worth the money, but this one certainly is. Actually, considering the 48 page book, BluRay, 2 DVDs and 2 CDs, it is probably a bargain!  (The DVDs play fine on my American equipment - I don't own a BluRay player.)

I have heard that Arjen reads reviews of his work, and I humbly hope that he might run across this one.  I hope this is only the beginning of live versions of his work - Certainly at least two of his other ""rock operas"" (""Electric Castle"" and ""The Theory of Everything"") would be incredible to see live and fully staged.  As for ""The Human Equation"", I think further live performances could work brilliantly either as a ""Broadway"" theater version similar to what we now have on DVD/BluRay, or as a full orchestra version.  Of course, either of these versions would require relinquishing some control, but many more people could hear and appreciate Arjen's incredible achievement.  I hope that he is at least considering it.",1482796800,2,5166,4.636663007683864

I just can't wait to get my favorite The theory of everything. And I am hoping avantasia would do the same. Or transiberian orchestra would film his Beethoven version that was great!

This is by far the greatest musical/operatic experience I have ever encountered and now it's on blu-ray. I would have loved to see the live show but did not know about it and it was only in Europe. I am so grateful that they recorded it and made it available. The vocalists and musicians are superb. Nothing on Broadway comes remotely close. The Human Equation is something to listen to and watch over and over and over again. I recommend turning on the subtitles because it is a bit challenging to follow all of the different characters and lyrics. The video work is good but not great. However, it does not prohibit the musical excellence from coming through one bit.
