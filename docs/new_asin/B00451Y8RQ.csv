8416456,5,B00451Y8RQ,"This collection of short films reminded me of elementary school. I remember seeing the smoking short, were they give nicotine to a rabbit. It was scary then, it's scary now. I could see someone not smoking or quitting because of these film. Also, hopefully the anti-alcohol films prevented a DUI or two. Some of the drinking shorts are about the dangers of alcohol itself. Others are about the danger of drinking and driving. The best of these is ""Nightmare For The Bold"" which appears to have been produced for servicemen. It show in realistic detail a night of drinking leading to disaster and shattered lives. On a campier note, there's the short ""What About Drinking"", where a bunch of super square teenagers from the 50s debate social drinking. Another short that stands out is the anti-smoking ""Time Pulls The Trigger"" which has a great animated sequence that's very psychodelic with anthropomorphic carcinogen characters parading about lung tissue and injecting poisons, brilliant.",1285891200,2,988,5.142857142857143
