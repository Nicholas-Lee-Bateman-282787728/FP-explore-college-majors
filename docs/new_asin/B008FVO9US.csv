8527365,2,B008FVO9US,"The image and the sound are of a quality that is not acceptable.  It looks very amateurish for a DVD that was recorded in June 2010.  I bought this DVD to enjoy an opera that was very well received in its time, and was performed many times until Rossini's one took over.  To make matter worse, Kicco Classic gives not information at all on the singers, orchestra or anything regarding this production. The pamphlet included with the DVD only details the libretto. With such poor sound and image quality it is difficult to comment on the singers and the production as a whole, but I give them the benefit of a doubt, thus the 2 stars. This DVD doesn't deserve the high purchase cost.",1369094400,10,682,4.483870967741935
