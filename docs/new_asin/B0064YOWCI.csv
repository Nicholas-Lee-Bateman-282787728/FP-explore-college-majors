4953761,3,B0064YOWCI,Incoherent and choppy plot with a lackluster ending. Most disappointing of entire Underworld series.,1518393600,,100,6.214285714285714

4953763,1,B0064YOWCI,"They should have stopped making these movies after the 2nd installment in the series. Underworld and Underworld:Evolution were good, but Rise of the Lycans, Awakening, and Blood Wars were just painful to watch despite the excellent cast they employed. Of the 5 movies this is probably the one I dislike the most. Thin plot (with holes) and not fluid at all. Save yourself the money and pick something else to watch. Thank me later.",1516492800,3,431,4.837837837837838
4953764,2,B0064YOWCI,It's just ok. The storyline needed work. Not as good as the first three movies. Total bummer.,1515542400,,93,4.529411764705882
4953765,4,B0064YOWCI,"This installment in the series is pretty decent.  It has a feel similar to the first movie which I loved and surpasses the sequels before it.  It has nice character development and an okay plot. Kate Beckinsale is in great form as usual.  If you like the series, this movie won't disappoint.",1515110400,,291,4.5576923076923075

4953768,3,B0064YOWCI,"So, here we have our impossible-to-warm-up-to protagonist in a plot set 10 years or so in the future from the second film.
A plot involving human attacks on Vampires and Lycans which ... completely vanishes by the end of the movie!
That's right -- by the end of the film the /entire basis of the plot/ has been forgotten.
Instead, it turns out that the ""humans"" are really Lycans -- some of them incredibly large.
Oh, and our protagonists from the first two films now have a daughter.
Still, I suppose this is one way of dealing with needing a new cast because of the time between films while keeping the protagonist as young as ever.",1513555200,,634,4.474137931034483

4953774,5,B0064YOWCI,I like the franchise.  This movie was unique because they brought the vampire and wearewolf battle into the fictional public view and contemporary times.

4953802,1,B0064YOWCI,"I loved the first film, and the first sequels were enjoyable, this one made me feel a bit sorry for Kate Beckinsale, who is still amazing in the role she created. This installment made me wonder ""What's a film like this doing around an actor like her?"" I'll still watch anything she's in, though.",1503360000,,296,4.5

4953810,3,B0064YOWCI,"I was soooo excited to watch this continuation of the Underworld Saga that I love.

But...this movie just left me lacking. I think perhaps it had something to do with the lack of returning characters.... everyone but Selene is gone. I would have loved for Michael to have been in the movie... I think it would have really elevated the storyline ....even if they couldn't have fit him in till closer to the end.

It wasn't that the movie wasn't enjoyable..it was..to an extent....I think my expectations were too high.

Apparently the director changed with this one as well....and I think that's where the bulk of the issues lie

Kinda disappointed in it... hopefully the last installment kicks it back up a notch",1502064000,,712,4.764227642276423
4953811,4,B0064YOWCI,"3D was decent. Not the best, but not the worst.",1501545600,,47,3.8
4953812,3,B0064YOWCI,"While the overall series is entertaining and likable, this one is under-par. It smacks of 'paycheck', which results in a movie being filmed before a proper script for it is written. What you get is little to no dialogue, and character interactions that make you scratch your head and wonder, ""what was the point of that scene."" Even the action, while profuse, is more quantity over quality...too much weak CGI and too little character development.

It gets three stars, but really, those are only because of Kate Beckinsale, and the fact that the legacy of the 1st two films deserved at least that much.",1501372800,,603,4.798076923076923
4953813,5,B0064YOWCI,Action movie worthy of your time. If you like the first 3 this one should not disappoint. Don't expect any Michael sightings because the actor is not in this movie.,1501286400,,164,4.5

4953826,5,B0064YOWCI,"I love KATE! Even the worst movies are improved by her presence.

4953831,2,B0064YOWCI,That was some terrible directing.  Can tell it was directed by a different person than the first three movies.  Fight scenes were just dumb and didn't make logical sense.  Pistols that never run out of ammo (including a 20+ round revolver that looks like it only holds 6 rounds).  Explosives that somehow go off sequentially from the button push of a single detonator.  And magically you can just shove a knife into a cars ignition cylinder and start a car.  Hollywood's reality is completely different from the rest of ours.,1497830400,,525,4.777777777777778
4953832,1,B0064YOWCI,Was charged the wrong price for all movies that we choose the SD version for $2.99.  It adds up when it happens every time we choose a prime movie.,1497744000,,147,4.068965517241379

4953878,4,B0064YOWCI,"This was mostly a typical Underworld movie with just enough twists to make it interesting. There was a lot of action and Kate Beckinsale is her usual great fighting machine. Also, with these types of stories, you have to disregard some things that seem impossible so sit back and enjoy the action. I watched the 3D version and was impressed with the depth and the few times I had to duck. Overall, if anyone enjoys the Underworld series, they should like this one.",1488585600,2,464,4.602409638554217

The movie is short and maybe that's part of its downfall because of the limited time to explain the story. Also, good luck keeping track of all the new characters. All but Selene are new, and they're all introduced within the first 15 minutes. I had to give one star because some of the action is OK to watch, but I'll agree with some other reviews in that many of the CGI sequences are pretty bad.",1484611200,,561,4.203703703703703

As a fan of the series I expected this wasn't going to be the greatest, but I still came into it with an open mind.  I was let down.

Too short and they could have taken a bit more time with the story so it didn't feel like an episode of something instead of a movie.  Also, the little girl looked absolutely ridiculous.  The thing I started off liking about this series is that the vampires don't run around hissing at everyone, as the movies go on more and more of the things I hate about other movies come into the Underworld movies.  Not happy.

Saw they are making a new one.  Maybe they shouldn't.",1478736000,2,689,4.198473282442748

The cast is good though some overplay their parts and the effects are in line with the rest of the movies. Kate Beckinsale pulled it off even after a break between films and some children.

4954061,5,B0064YOWCI,"After the other movies I was thinking that would be it. No more Underworld movies but imagine my happy surprise when there was to be more. I was truly filled with joy. These after all are films I view as the highest of the highest when it comes to films.

While I was worried where the story would go next that proved to be a baseless worry. In this story character development for Selene, no, all the characters on Selene's side gain more dimensionality. We see a side of Selene that is both tender and nurturing. Far away from the vampire warrior we have seen before and as a fan of the franchise that was wonderful to see. Half the time when this happened I was overcome with emotion because hey Kate Beckinsale was putting her acting on display (not that she hasn't before too).

Furthermore, Underworld: Awakening embraced its action horror title way more than the other previous installments. This was made the more clear when toward the end she goes full out and blows up entire building sectors. It gives a nod to how incredible Selene can be and the whole action aspect of the Underworld franchise. Which every Underworld director has owned.

Whether a fan of the Underworld film franchise or not, you, really should give the films a chance. All of them thus far up to Underworld: Awakening have had extraordinary acting, cinematography, and subtle, developed character development and interactions.",1462752000,3,1408,4.762295081967213
4954062,5,B0064YOWCI,"Let see, take vampires, Kate Beckinsale in skin tight leather, add some dialogue and you have this. Did I mention Kate Beckinsale?

The Underworld movies are fun, sure they are not that great masterpiece, but you are watching this for vampires and a certain actress who might be on the cover of the movie jacket.",1462320000,,312,4.672727272727273

4954064,1,B0064YOWCI,"The movie is an okay horror, but the CG versions of the Lycans were too fake looking and detract from the movie's realism. The movie was shot in 3D and looks good on a 3D TV.

This version has multiple mandatory previews that cannot be readily bypassed to watch the movie. I'm not buying any more Sony movie releases till they stop this practice. I'm not paying for disks that force me to watch commercials.",1462233600,9,407,4.426666666666667

I can't wait for next installment. If you're going to watch this you better check out Evolution an The rise of the Lycan.,1462060800,,412,4.098765432098766

If I am shelling out 15-25 a movie when everyone else is stealing them digitally I should be rewarded for it.

4954200,5,B0064YOWCI,"Fox TV says ""Beckinsale is back and fiercer than ever"" in this yet another excellent Underworld series movie. Bloody-Disgusting.com says this is ""The best Underworld yet"". Selene returns after being jailed for years to a new type of world. Humans now are aware of the existence of vampires and werewolves and are finding ways to exterminate both species. Now not only does Selene fight werewolves, she must also fight humans as well. However, to make things worse, a new breed of werewolf has been created. Bigger, stronger, and far more dangerous. There is also a treat for all you Lost Girl fans out there. You will easily recognize one of the main male characters in this Underworld movie and why the producers from Lost Girl wanted him on the SciFi Channel action/horror/fantasy show. This movie is action, horror, suspense, and fantasy rolled into one with OUTSTANDING CGI, special effects, sets, and backgrounds.

This is film FINALLY returns the series a pretty close to its original form (which was like crack to some of us, its combination of first figuring out that a great formula for a vampire film a central, brutal war with werewolves, another enjoyable legendary horror, with the added bonus of an understated but effective Romeo and Juliet story cutting the other way, plus intelligently written characters and dramatic story that develops those characters. Even about half the critics didn't turn their minds off because it was gothic fantasy-action and gave it decent reviews)--though its expensive CGI is inferior to the physical production design of the original. The runtime of this film is short, because it's a bit of an odd bird--great 3D digital photography using new cameras, but more importantly, this plot isn't as fully developed a film as we expect: it's a novella, not a novel, obviously made to set us up to link our again-deadly-and-beautiful-leather-clad heroine to a coming sequel that will return Scott Speedman's Michael Corwin character--plus enough complications laid for another film. The plot isn't thin or poor, as some have claimed--it's just smallish.

It is, however, true to the original, unlike the poorly written sequel and prequel, which both had generic plots centered around vampire-werewolf action porn, with the bonus of continually retroactively destroying the wonderful (characterwise) Viktor, the Bill Nighy character from the first film--each doing as much as possible to avoid capitalizing on the complexities of that away the brave, surprisingly deadly, cold and powerful warrior, mostly by replacing him with a generic tyrant-coward played by the same actor.

This is the ONLY film, following the first, with more-than-completely-generic storytelling (which story is, however, rather overwhelmed by the focus on action, which takes up much or most of the runtime, in contrast to the balance toward character-building of the first--but that's okay. The surviving characters are already established, and Beckinsale still looks stunning, athletic, and deadly in pleather). If Beckinsale and Speedman return for anotherl film, this will be a small but perfectly decent chapter in the quite good story of loss, loneliness, occasional vulnerability, black vinyl-wearing vampires, and anger that runs from it toward a hoped for legitimate sequel in the forthcoming Underworld: The Next Generation.

Note: With the unfortunate inability to return the Bill Nighy character to this film (they ruined the character in the crap prequel, anyway), Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister from 'Game of Thrones') turns in a quite decent performance as a very different sort of vampire elder.",1428969600,4,2808,5.435779816513762

His powers were said to be limitless and he hasn't appeared in two movies in a row. I was happy Selene had a kid with Michael but I was hoping it would be similar to the way lucion and victors daughter did it.

4954330,4,B0064YOWCI,"This the third time (or is it the fourth?) that Kate Beckinsale & Co. have set forth to prove that there is probably nothing sexier in this world than a cute babe in black leather packing heat and blazing away at anything that moves.

UNDERWORLD:AWAKENING is the perfect offering for the summer movie-going set: there's no plot, hardly any dialogue, no character development; just 89 minutes worth of gratuitous violence to satisfy you and your date (except for those syfy geeks and fan boys who theoretically have no dates) for one evening's worth of entertainment.  This time Selene (Kate Beckensale), the ultimate feminist take-no-prisoners warrior, must take on the human world, which has banded together to wipe out all vampires and lycans, so now she blows away a large number of good ordinary folks along with lycans.  She and her lover Michael (Sam Speedman) have now been captured and put into suspended animation. Twelve years later Selene reawakens (like the title says), breaks out of prison and is off on another mission. (Passing through a store to get herself a coat, look for a fast display that shows that lycans don't brush after every meal; just thought I'd mention.) It turns out that she and Michael have a twelve-year-old daughter (India Eisley), who whatever she is can be pretty fierce and crazy in her own right.  Meanwhile, lycon scientists have been working to produce bigger, stronger, better werewolves than ever before, so this time Kate gets as powerful a beating as any she can dish out herself.  Happily, being Selene, she manages to dispose of her enemies, and she and her little girl go off in the end in search of Michael, presumably to set us up for Underworld Part Five (REUNION, perhaps?).

The Underworld franchise has never really been a big one (as far as I can tell, MAD magazine has never done a number on it and I have never seen any exhibits at any Comic-Con) but it continues to be a terrific vehicle for Kate Beckensale, who is always photographed in the best ways possible.  She is not just some lightweight eye candy when action pictures seem to be her forte.  I say, may the powers that be be with her.",1419292800,,2153,4.737967914438503

It maintains the steady decline in the franchise and feels like a succession of completely unnecessary and unmotivated action sequences. Don't get me wrong, good action scene is not amiss, as long as it serves the story, and not the other way around, when a thin plot tries to hold kicking and screaming bits together. This movie lacks emotion, motivation or pretty much anything else. If you want action vampire flick, go for first Blade, at least it has gorgeous cinematography. If you want a movie about what would it mean to be a vampire, go for Only Lovers Left Alive, or for Interview with the Vampire. If you want some action, well, any Jason Statham or Liam Neeson would do. Safe to say, if they are planning one more of these, I am not on board.",1417219200,,894,4.391566265060241

4954399,3,B0064YOWCI,"How is this film like World War Z?  The lengthy action sequences only pause from time to time for a sentence or two of dialog.  And too often the dialog sounds like things we've heard a thousand times before, like, ""Jeepers, what's wrong?"" or, ""Jeepers, are you OK?""  But, hey, if you like your guns supplied with ammunition that is never exhausted, except when the right beat in a sequence arrives, then we've got a film for you!

It's great seeing Kate Beckinsale back as Selene and the whole cast does a fine job.  The effects are fine.  The movie overall is fine, but it's not the original Underworld and it suffers by comparison.  The original had layers.  It revealed things about the past as well as the present.  It had intrigue.  You might even say it had ""politics.""  Awakening, rather than striping away the layers, seems more of a single set-piece battle that simply unfolds in stages.

I personally think we could have been served up a far more interesting film if the makers had decided to concentrate on the human crusade against vamps and lycans--which would have made Selene's initial killing spree far more palatable--but instead they pushed the crusade into the background and gave us one man's attempt to crown himself king and one woman's efforts to stop him.

 It's a smaller story than it might have been, and as a result it lacks a degree of gravitas.",1411516800,,1375,4.651452282157677

I am clearly disappointed in this last one. I am a big fan of all the previous Underworld installements, but this? Shot more like a video game with all the frentic action sequences & excessive gore factor. Lacking depth even for a popcorn flick. And seriously, they fast forward 12 yrs and all we get is a quick recap and that's suppose to clear everything up. None of the original characters (those whom survived the last time around besides S) are in this movie. Choppy dialogue. So many holes in the plot.

4954429,3,B0064YOWCI,"im a huge Underworld fan, so will always watch the newest installments over and over. Awakening though is def my least fav though that's not to say its a particularly bad movie, its just .... lacking.
Whilst obviously kate B has dialogue, as the movie goes on she spends more and more time just standing there looking immensely puzzled with her mouth open and lips pursed. Theres lots of action but it just doesn't seem to lead to much except to see Selene twisting and jumping and strutting in her skin tight leathers. There is a quick insert of a new coven and elder/ Victor lookalike Charles Dance which could have gone somewhere but was more like something to add filler - Dances character was on screen briefly and was a shadow of what we have come to expect the elders to be like.
Yes Selene can now walk around in daylight - a thumbs down for those of us that enjoy the more traditional vampires that the previous 3 films had bought us.
Overall, its not that its bad but simply that its empty, Selene is a shadow of her former self, and I wonder how much better this film could have been had Len Wiseman come back to direct. Yeah ill gladly watch it again, as I said im a real Underworld fan, but that's the reason I will watch it not because its a fantastic piece of work.",1407888000,12,1280,4.3153526970954355

I'm not really sure how Selene is still alive. She is the worst fighter I've ever seen in an action film. I couldn't by into her badass-ness. She waste a bunch of bullets trying to take down a beast then only one bullet to take down another. Dumb. Her outfit is horrible, effects were horrible, and the action was horrible. Sad way to end a decent franchise.",1405296000,,598,4.2
4954460,1,B0064YOWCI,"Starring Kate Beckingsale, Stephen Rea, Charles Dance, India Ealy, and a bunch of others whose name I forgot. This came to the theatres for one week in January 2012, but I skipped it then. Then I bought the DVD in May 2013. In this installment Selene somehow got captured, as was Michael -- and frozen for 12 years. And somehow she got a daughter though her pregnancy was barely mentioned in Evolution (2005). Too many plot holes. At first it seems humans were on a campaign to exterminate all the vampires and lycans, but Stephen Rea's Antigen Corp. is secretly turning humans into super lycans -- though why is not explained, nor how, except through injections. Antigen claims to be researching for a cure but really wants to create a super race of giant lycans -- an idea found in the Alien films, and many others. The search for a super soldier, superman is a cliche done far too many times.
  Meanwhile Eva, daughter of Selene, releases Selene and both escape. Much chasing around. Selene finds another vampire, David, and he leads her to coven under a dam. Here we meet all that is left of the vampires. Led by Thomas (Charles Dance), who doesn't want to fight anymore. But Selene, who only knows fighting, starts more fights, underground, as the super lycans invade. Movie shifts to a simple war between lycans and humans. The scientists at Antigen all turn out to be lycans in disguise. The lycans kidnap Eva back and once again Selene goes to Antigen Corp. to get her out of there yet again. Long fight about that extraction. She has help from a human cop -- not much -- but she finds some humans who want to help the vampires. In the end she finds Michael frozen, she shoots at the chamber, goes back to fighting the superlycans and in the final scene goes back to find Michael and he is gone. The surviving lycans took him - up on the roof and escaped by helicopter. All this wide open for a sequel. Was one ever made? Should they?
  The film got severely hammered by reviews posted on IMDb and was exhibited for a week in the theatre. Previous Underworld films were: Underworld (2003), Underworld Evolution (2005), which were linked, Underworld Rise of the Lycans (2009), a prequel.
  Got mainly because I had the others in the series, and to see Kate running around in that black costume (probably latex, not leather). She has gotten older. The film is a lot shorter than the others in the series and pretty thin on plot. Not recommended for a good story-seeking audience.",1405209600,,2485,4.585585585585585

Kris Holden-Ried was terrific to watch - I was already a fan of his from the Lost Girl (2010-current) TV show, and it was great to see his big screen performance kept him in a similar paranormal format, i.e. he remained ""wolfy""!  The movie itself continued with the Gothic-look found in the original trilogy, which kept a nice continuity to it.  Lot of action in this movie, but if you are expecting flashbacks to the previous movies, look elsewhere; this film is really an action movie with the Underworld brand and Kate Beckinsale starring, but no true plot that moves the world created in Underworld, forward.

I love all of the Underworld series and like many I was a little bummed that Selene was missing from the third movie but she comes back with a vengeance in Awakening. While she seemed to show a little restrain in past (Unless you were Viktor or Marcos) she has little patience for anyone around her in her current state of confusion. The amount of violence she exhibits is fantastic and funny and oh so sexy. By far my favorite of the series. It is absolutely gorgeous in Blu-Ray.

Other than the fact that Kate Beckinsdale hasn't much left in terms of her career, I hope she doesn't consider doing additional damage by agreeing to do yet another of these SNORE BORE installments.

much CGI, too much deviation from the original movies (they couldn't even get Scott Speedman
to return), and let's face it....the story was totally lame.  The entire movie is like a 180 from the
direction the series was taking, and to write this type of story is a betrayal to all the fans who have stuck
with this series over the years.  Len, what were you thinking????",1390867200,2,474,4.488372093023256

4954559,5,B0064YOWCI,"I have seen this film many times without tiring of it, as it's frequently on cable. There is non-stop action and Kate is thrilling as super tough Selene the Daywalking Vampire Warrior. The script keeps my attention and the production values are high. I thoroughly enjoy this film. There is nothing cheap about this film. I think it is the best of the Underground films.
There are lots of well done Computer Graphics. The actual Vampire gore is minimal.
Kate Beckinsale still looks great even though it is ten years since she made the first of the Underground films. She is very convincing firing machine pistols, exploding grenades and wielding swords. She really kicks some butt!
I highly recommend this film, it is one of my favorites.",1376006400,,737,4.811023622047244
4954560,4,B0064YOWCI,This was a good movie with some nice 3D.  The effects are clean and not too corny.  The video is pristine and great to watch. The audio on a good system is amazing.

4954561,5,B0064YOWCI,"This movie is a great addition and must have to your Underworld collection! I never thought this movie was going to be made since it was 6 years since Underworld Evolution came out. Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009) seemed like just a filler movie that was probably the weakest of the 4 movies and a prequel. Kate Beckinsale looks great in Underworld Awakening and hasn't aged a bit; a little of that might be the make-up but she is still very beautiful at 40. I won't give out too much details for those who haven't seen this movie yet, but the ending makes it open for a 5th installment. I hope they make another Underworld movie to finish off the story line but only if Kate reprises her Selene role and have Len Wiseman either direct or write the story for it.

The Bluray quality is excellent! There are rich blacks which is important since most of the film has night time scenes. There isn't any noticeable grain. I was not able to watch it with full surround sound as I can't crank up the volume where I live.

I hope they never make a reboot of this franchise though because it was already done right and I can't imagine anyone else playing Selene! Who knows what studios will do though 10 to 15 years from now.",1375574400,,1223,4.359649122807017

This film is sub par. The story is aweful, the special effects are all cg (and not well done cg), the dark scenes (which comprise more than 1/2 of the film) are very unclear, and the writers must have ran out of good ideas because they copied the whole story off of the resident evil franchise.

I'm not saying that she's the best actress with a vagine, but she's pretty cool, easy on the eyes, and she was awesome in the first 2 underworlds!  i was really hoping that there was a new top-tier action/sci-fi/fantasy/gore/w/e but i'm pretty sure that we're gonna just have to be happy with 2 good one's out of the brand.  thanks, yes, but i can't help but feel like there could've been a lot more and i've abandoned hope since we got 1 stinker, and then another consecutively, and not many film franchises recover from that because they were only created from towels being thrown in.

i was embarrassed that i bought it, i was embarrassed that i got someone to watch it with me.  i really did apologize.  i actually threw it in a box in the corner and then put the lid on it, and then put another box on top of that one.

just don't do it, and if you must, don't purchase it.",1363824000,,1403,4.2218045112781954

It has a lot of holes in it's plot, and you'll find some of it a bit cheesy at times. I think what annoyed me the most is that they didn't bring back the original actor who plays ""Michael"" (Scott Speedman). You can clearly tell it's another actor with prosthetic make-up pieces applied to his face to look like the original actor. But, if you haven't seen the other movies in this series before watching this one, I still think you will enjoy this movie.",1363478400,,584,4.27027027027027

That's why if you ask me about say, ""Smokey and the Bandit"" I'll tell you only the first one is worth seeing, or say ""Tremors,"" this one, I'm a little more lenient, see the trilogy, skip the 4th movie and the series if kinda mot-so, mot-so, it ain't bad but it could have used a budget.
  That being said, let's look at ""Underworld,"" all three movies, great quality, surprising epic story arch and great characters.  Now take this movie it takes a side step from the others, the Lycan (short for lycanthropy: werewolves) issue isn't the problem anymore for the vampire heroine, not even her own corrupt kind are her problem.  Now humans have gotten involved, and they take no prisoners.  I a world where both immortals are hunted, what can the only hybrids do but try and stay one step ahead of the slaughter.  This story [with some helpful writing by one of my personal favorites J. Michael Straczynski (JMS)] takes ""Underworld"" into a newer age of storytelling where a whole new set of stories can be conceived and told in a new time where the Immortals are not longer hidden.

4954641,3,B0064YOWCI,"After learning of their existence, the humans have set out to destroy all vampires and werewolves, save for a few specimens that they plan to use for biological testing. Selene, the vampire death-dealer, awakens 12 years after being captured to discover that she now has a daughter, a vampire/werewolf hybrid who is the last of the Covinus line. Together, they are the only hope for survival for their dying breed! 'UNDERWHELMING' is a better title for the third entry in this struggling series, which places action and special effects ahead of story and character in another pointless chapter. AWAKENING is the least favorable of any of the sequels, boasting the worst looking computerized creatures yet in a tiring display of cartoon violence. The mythology between the two clans that once captivated audiences seems like an afterthought now as the direction of the series becomes increasingly unclear. The addition of teen star India Eisley as Eve seems questionable in a hard ""R"" Horror film, especially if she is to become the focus of future entries. Kate Beckinsale may look good in black, but she phones in another emotionless performance as Selene. Mns Mrlind and Bjrn Stein successfully maintain the same style and tone as the other films, but their eye for action is found lacking. While UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING may not be the end of the series, another sequel like this will surely bury it.

The whole '12 year old being a hero and then getting captured again and then the hero going back to save the 12 year old'. I'm not a fan of the injection lycan blood( when you see it, you'll know what I mean). That's..I don't know. It's not supposed to be like that in my opinion. It's either get bit or nothing.

4954703,3,B0064YOWCI,"I thought this movie had great action from start to finish (not to mention great sound and special effects), the only problem was the finish came way too quickly. An hour and 18 minutes is too short in my opinion, even for action movies",1357516800,,236,4.386363636363637

Being that it is a fourth entry in a series that has gone through constant director/writer changes in the past and was in the hands of first time or relatively new directors, I was prepared for something like the terrible resident evil movies. But having enjoyed the last 3 I figured I would give this a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised.

4954744,1,B0064YOWCI,"Im a huge fan of the series and was sick the other day and watch all 3 of the first movies and then ordered this one.

This is just plain terrible. Everything looks super fake, its like they cut the budget to a quarter of what they had on other movies, threw in really awkward camera shots (for the 3D effect in the theaters) and made the lycan look terrible. Michael is in it for about 2 minutes (that I saw since I stopped early) and was another actor. Overall everyone's acting is bad bad. Another thing that bothered me is in the first or second movie she mentions that she has not had the misfortune to have to kill a human (leading me to believe she did not ever want to), but in this one its a human bloodbath the first few minutes. I get that they captured her and they are the enemy but if they had at least made her seem like she didn't WANT to do it, it would have tied it together better.

At some point I'm sure Ill finish the movie just to finish, but if you like the first 3 do not ruin it for yourself and just pretend this one never happened.",1354406400,11,1059,4.038095238095238

4954747,5,B0064YOWCI,"Classicly trained actress Kate Beckinsale returns for another installment of Underworld...sounds awesome?  Yes?  Is the movie awesome? Eh..yes and no.

This movie definitely gives Underworld fans more of what they want, action, fighting, and a continuation of the story of Selene the death dealer.  So why not a five star review?  It does't have the Len Wiseman touch.  The reason the first two movies were so well received were because of the ambiance Wiseman created in his films.  Its not to say that this movie doesn't do that..but is just different.  And in a movie series, different is not always welcome.

Scott Speedman was also missed in this movie..I'm sure everyone wanted to learn more about Michael and his unique powers.

All in all, should you watch this? If you saw the other movies, then yes.  If not, you can opt to skip this one.  Also the 3D features are okay, but not nearly as good as in some other movies (ie The Avengers).",1353888000,,946,4.701219512195122

Borrowing a plot device from older horror movies, the star returns after being on ice for a number of years. The world may have changed during Selene's slumber but she has not. The movie has a decent plot that doesn't get in the way of the frequent battles, fights, shootings, car chases and other action. Staying with its strengths, they deliver a very entertaining flick that fans of the previous 3 movies in the series will certainly enjoy. Most of all, they seem to realize that Selene IS the series and they keep her front and center where fans want her.",1353456000,,690,4.663934426229508

4954760,4,B0064YOWCI,"It has been nearly a decade since the release of the ""Underworld"" film.  The original film, directed by Len Wiseman (""Live Free and Die Hard"", ""Underworld: Evolution"") and written by Danny McBride, the first film would receive mixed reviews from critics but would make over $95 million in the box office and would pave the way for two more films, a sequel and a prequel.

And now the fourth film, ""Underworld: Awakening"" directed by Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein (the duo who worked on the film ""Shelter"" and ""Storm""), join Len Wiseman (who continues to write the films) and reuniting with actress Kate Beckinsale (""Aviator"", ""Pearl Harbor"").

""Underworld: Awakening"" was presented in theaters in 3D and brought in over $160 million in the box office, becoming the first film of 2012 to break $100 million.

VIDEO:

""Underworld: Awakening"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) aspect ratio and you have the option of watching the film in 3D or 2D.

With that being said, make no doubt about it, ""Underworld: Awakening"" is one of the better Blu-ray on 3D live action release.  Not only do you get the 3D depth but there are a number of moments where shattering of fragments, blood, artillery, debris and weapons are flying all over the place towards you.  And the great news is that the 3D is constant, it's not like you will see a 3D effect every 20 minutes.  There is a lot of action in this film and there is no doubt that when ""Underworld: Awakening"" was made, there was an emphasis put on the action and making the 3D benefit from these action sequences.

With that being said, the video quality for this film is fantastic!  Sony hasn't really disappointed anyone with their Blu-ray releases of late and ""Underworld: Awakening"" is a film that retains its cool, dark look with blues, grays and blacks.  Black levels are nice and deep, explosions showcasing lighter colors such as oranges and ambers are vibrant.  Detail is very well done, especially showcasing the vampire or Lycan transformations.  Both 3D and 2D versions look amazing and videophiles should be pleased with both versions.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Underworld: Awakening"" not only showcases magnificent visuals and 3D, the lossless soundtrack is also immersive and fantastic.  Presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD MA, French 5.1 DTS-HD MA and English -Audio Description Track, like the 3D that is constant, as with the action.  There is plenty of action from cars crashing into each other, Selene unleashing a parade of bullets, elevators crashing, bodies being swatted like flies and hearing the groans, the growls, you name it...the audio is coming from all over the place.

I was so pleased with this soundtrack and just hearing constant audio coming from the surround channels was a major plus for me and also, the music soundtrack also is utilized for the surround channels as well.

You get an immersive lossless soundtrack with ""Underworld: Awakening"" and dialogue is crystal clear, there is nothing bad to say about the soundtrack for this film.  Audiophiles will definitely be pleased!

Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have always looked at the ""Underworld"" films as your vampire vs. werewolf popcorn action film series.  With ""Underworld: Awakening"", the writers were moving away from the ""Twilight"" mushy romance (or Romeo & Juliet romance, as I called the first two films).

This time around, Juliet (Selene) is separated from her Romeo (Michael) and the world has turned against them.  They are the hunted and she lost 12-years of her life, to find out that she has a child who may be the most powerful child with vampire and Lycan blood, and most importantly, having the blood of Alexander Corvinus, hence the immortality.

And what is quite interesting is the introduction of the two new characters, we have ""Secret Life of the American Teenager"" actress India Eisley playing Eve and a vampire named David (played by Theo James) as the next generation who will play an important role in the future of the films.

I admit that while ""Underworld"" films are typically popcorn action films, there was depth in the storyline as it focused on the war between vampires and Lycans and treachery that went on behind-the-scenes.  There was a sense of brooding darkness that followed the characters but this time around, since most of the vampires and Lycans have been massacred, the film changes from being vampire vs. Lycans film to now the humans vs. the vampires, Lycans and hybrids.

And there was no doubt that these films were now more action heavy, designed for 3D and the storyline, was made to be kept simple for those who have never watched the films in the trilogy.  And thus, the storyline is rather subjective.  Those who love the original storyline for its violent action but also romance, you can't have a romance in ""Underworld: Awakening"" when Juliet has been separated from her Romeo. So, without the romantic angle which has been a big part of the film series, you're left with the action and a storyline about being the hunted.

And once again,  it's another popcorn action film and with actress Kate Beckinsale wearing a tight leather uniform but this time with upgraded visuals due to technology and a futuristic setting.  I felt that the makeup and creature design were fantastic for this film as with the visual effects, especially the 3D and fantastic lossless audio.

The video and the lossless soundtrack were absolutely amazing and these two have been the strong points of the ""Underworld"" films but this time, they have raised the bar of how things look and sound.  The 3D really makes a difference and the constant immersive audio was a major plus.  And to top things off, there are a good number of special features to keep ""Underworld"" fans busy.  Make no doubt about it, this is a Blu-ray release that Blu-ray 3D enthusiasts plus video and audiophiles will surely enjoy!

Overall, while ""Underworld: Awakening"" is not a film that focuses on a deep storyline, fans of the previous films know what to expect and that is a lot of bullets, a lot of deaths, non-stop action and Kate Beckinsale looking awesome a decade later in tight black leather.

A worthy continuation of the ""Underworld"" film series that leans very heavy on the action, even those who have never watched an ""Underworld"" film can watch this film and enjoy it (there is an explanation of the first two films at the beginning of the film).  And for those expecting a lot of blood and gore, you get some of that as well in ""Underworld: Awakening"".

If you are looking for an all-out action film with vampires vs. werewolves, ""Underworld: Awakening"" will definitely appeal to you!  And for those who have been wanting better Blu-ray 3D experiences, ""Underworld: Awakening"" is one of the better 3D live-action Blu-rays that I have seen in a while.",1352332800,5,8349,4.9985517740767555

While Beckinsale and Speedman did revive their roles as Selene and Michael, nothing else mattered but the plot. Wow what a complete waste of one hour and thirty minutes. In fact this movie was so bad I'm trading it in for a gift card! SPOILERS TO FOLLOW. We find out Vampires and Lycans have been all but terminated by humans and Selene is captured and frozen. Selene is freed by another prisoner and we learn that the girl is her daughter. Selene protects girl and finds another vampire coven. They are taken their but lycans are called in and apparently these lycans are immune to silver and are larger than previous lycans. Can we say genetic altering has taken place?? This said company is run by lycans who created this girl who can transform into a lycan and has vampire healing. Selene kills company owner and while we are lead to believe Michael is dead, it isn't true. At the very end where Selene finds him frozen as well. Selene kills company president, together with her daughter they find Michael has broken out of the lab and is gone off into the city. The two of them are left on top of a helicopter pad and must go looking for him. The end of the movie leave us with a cliffhanger for a sequel to this movie. I'm still sticking with Underworld and Underworld Evolution. Do yourself a favor and watch those again and skip this one completely.

4954774,4,B0064YOWCI,"Kate Beckinsale made this movie work.  In my opinion, this is the weakest movie in the Underworld franchise.  The plot was not as exciting, in my opinion, as the previous movies in the series.  The good thing is that Kate Beckinsale has got the role of action star down pat.  She is probably one of the best female action star in the business today, right along with Angelina Jolie and Noomi Rapace.

The movie time frame takes place a few years after the events of Underworld 2.  You may recall that Underworld 3 dealt with the backstory and told the story of Lucian and Sonia.  Basically, in chronological order in terms of the story, this is the order:  U3, U1, U2, and then this one.  Here we find our hero, the female vampire Selene, awakened from a deep sleep.  Not a natural vampire sleep, mind you, but a state of suspended animation within a laboratory.  Humans have learned of the existence of vampires, and have won the war.  Selene learns that she has a child with Michael, taken out of her while she was in suspension.  Escaping from the lab with her daughter in tow, they set out to look for the remaining vampires.

Beckinsale did not start out as an action type of actress.  But with her experience in Underworld, Whiteout, and the recently made Total Recall, she has become one of the few female action stars in Hollywood.  Underworld is a pretty good franchise.  And this installment is no exception.  It is certainly worth your time to watch.  Stephen Rea, Sandrine Holt, Charles Dance, and India Eisley play supporting roles.",1349654400,,1545,4.613970588235294

4954780,4,B0064YOWCI,"If anything still qualifies as a ""monster movie"" these days, it's probably the ""Underworld"" series. In that regard, the abysmally bad acting is quite forgivable, as the focus of these movies is on creating a mind blowing spectacle of monster mayhem, not on reenacting ""Hamlet"". This movie does not disappoint where its success will be measured- the CGI werewolves are more convincing than ever, and their battles are a treat to behold. I still feel that ""Evolution"" is the best entry in the series, but it's cool that the writers have found clever ways to keep the show rolling (and based on the cliffhanger ending, it's safe to assume there will be another one, if the bottom line remains agreeable). Fans of the series will most likely be pleased with ""Awakening"", but newcomers may be confused about what all the fuss is about.",1348358400,,830,4.811188811188811

4954782,4,B0064YOWCI,"Underworld:Awakening(released Jan/12)is the franchise's latest incarnation. It has Kate Beckinsale as Selene,front and center once more(where she belongs),kicking both vampire and lycan butt. Ms. Beckinsale seamlessly pours herself back into her character,both physically and mentally. Starring along with Kate is Stephen Rea as the head of the  Antigen lab which Kate becomes prisoner in,Charles Dance as a vampire elder and a good assortment of other supporting cast members.
The film begins with a recap of the first two films which led to the circumstances that this one jumps off from. The human world has now become aware of the lycan/vampire threat and has done major purges to rid itself of these scourges. Selene's lover,hybrid Michael,has fallen into the city river and Kate jumps in after him. The authorities throw in a bomb,which when it detonates,freezes the waters around them,and they are captured. They remain frozen in the Antigen laboratories,the head of which and his son,are both lycans in disguise. Kate,one day,is inexplicably thawed out and escapes the laboratories.
During her flight she runs into another vampire,and also comes across a young girl huddling in the sewers,with lycans in the vicinity. She dispatches the lycans and during their meeting,the young girl explains it was her that unthawed her at the labs,as she was also a test subject,and that she is Selene's daughter and,as it is later learned,a hybrid more powerful than Selene and Michael put together.
Selene and her daughter flee to a local vampire coven where they are not exactly welcomed by its leader. When the place is raided,it is assumed it is humans,but it strangely turns out to be lycans. As the plot and action further unfold it is learned that the head of the Antigen labs has sent them to retrieve Selene,as her blood is needed to produce a super serum,which is resistant to silver. Selene's daughter inevitably gets captured and Selene must storm the labs to rescue her. In the process she discovers the cryogenically frozen body of Michael,who it was assumed was dead. She has no time but to put a bullet hole in the chamber then flee.
When the final battle finishes Selene's daughter gets a vision from her fathers eyes that he is on the roof,but by the time they get there he has fled. The film fades out as Selene makes her new mission known to take back the world from both the humans and lycans,and to reunite with Michael.
The plot is a good one,with plenty of action and a body count unseen in previous Underworlds,and that is saying something. J. Michael Straczynski is one board this time around as a co-writer,and as everyone knows was the genius behind one of the best Sci Fi series ever to grace the boob tube:Babylon 5. There is a small problem I have though with the story and that is the daughter,or did I miss something? My question is just how did she come to be? We know of course Michael and Selene were intimate but how the daughter was born in a laboratory,kind of stretches things;at least without some kind of hint. Was Selene actually pregnant when she was captured or did the lab artificially impregnate her during the freezing? But that would mean she'd have to been unthawed somewhere along the line for nine months. Or was the daughter born outside of Selene's womb? Many questions,no answers or hint of one. Would an extended version have at least given us a clue or will there be some type of answer in the next film? We will see. Until then,it is an unsettling part of the story,and I don't like loose ends like this,especially in a storyline of such complexity.
Technically the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. The only extra is commentary.
Not a bad addition to the franchise,with Kate back in the saddle again...finally. It is a shorter than normal film(the shortest of the franchise)coming in around 80 minutes. It does move nicely and the action is strong throughout. I have a problem with the addition of Selene's daughter and her origins,which is not explained at all and which we must except on face value. Not good.
An above average flick and recommended.",1348012800,,4128,4.830508474576271

It's so satisfying as you watch it with nothing of substance to get in the way of all those empty calories.  It's not deep, you don't have to ponder anything afterwards, it doesn't deal with important issues currently plaguing mankind; it's fun!

4954791,1,B0064YOWCI,"Get ready Underworld fans to hate this review. The Underworld franchise has been on a downward slope since the first one and this was the worst. Sure it still maintains the same Kate Beckinsale in the same slick black tight suit looking impervious to everything including bullets and claws. The movie is soaked in darkness, tones of blue and gore. Don't think you'll see any green here, just blue with hints of red splattered blood. The plot is paper thin like an 80s movie of having Arnold Swartzenager invade a compound and kill everyone. Well this movie Kate invades a compound and kills werewolves like she's an exterminator. Why? For a new girl that joins the cast and doesn't seem to have much to do with anything. It feels tacked on like they couldn't have her save her beloved boyfriend again. This is a cool and gory movie without much substance. Terrible dialog and even worse logic like how would a girl raised in a lab know what a mom and dad are to even know who her mom and dad are? Why would the fiendish lycan company bent on using this kid even tell the kid what a mom and dad are? Why bother teaching her English? Whatever. The girl doesn't even show up until 30+ minutes into the movie making me wonder why everyone is willing to instantly die for her. Everything seems thrown together with no cohesion. I'm not exactly why Kate is trying to save the girl other than the obvious she's Kate's daughter but Kate doesn't remember having her.

The movie excels at cool, gorey deaths and action... but so much of it that you grow numb by the end. The body count is probably near 100, but Kate remains unharmed. Its like watching Superman in a woman's body who can't fly with bad dialog. In fact she even brings someone back to life by touching his heart literally. Speaking of plunging her hand into someone's stomach to get to their chest... when she does it, there is no blood on her snow white hand afterward.

I'd probably feel different about the movie if any of the cast could convey any sort of emotion other than brooding badassery. Not even the child can convey some sense of weakness or emotion, she's too busy killing everyone too! Maybe that's just the vampire stereotype that they have no emotion... just like there is a stereotype that vampires hate sunlight, yet Kate Beckinsale can be out there in the daytime because 'it because it was a gift.' If only this character wasn't Superman. If only she had any kind of weakness or frailty. Even Superman has kryptonite, Indiana Jones had snakes, even the Terminator can be killed. Heck you can even strip her of her automatic pistol to show some sign of weakness. Pretty easy to kill lycan when all vampires are equipped with pistols and all werewolves are just brutish beasts without weapons.

Pass this movie unless you need a good laugh and eye roll. I just can't suspend my disbelief this much. Feel free to write and tell me how awesome the movie is and how it is in your top 5 films of all time.",1346371200,,2976,4.507407407407407

The good:
1. Lots of actions
2. Selene is a powerful vampire, the most powerful perhaps
3. The enemies have personalities, not just mindless lycans

The bad:
1. No romance
2. Supporting characters aren't that interesting
3. No vampire vs vampire battles

4954798,5,B0064YOWCI,"This film was my introduction into the ""Underworld"" franchise.  I've never been a fan of vampire movies, so I typically steer clear of them, but I was hungry for a 3D movie and took a chance.  I'm glad I did because I loved it! It's not a slow, horror movie, and it doesn't involve the usual vampire cliches like driving a stake through the heart or using garlic or crosses to ward them off.  There's plenty of gunfire, crashes, explosions and gorey deaths to satisfy the action fan.  The 3D experience is great because the movie was filmed with 3D cameras, so there's lots of depth and pop-out effects.  However, at times it was a bit difficult to appreciate the 3D effects because most of the scenes were dark to begin with, and I found myself adjusting the brightness more than once to compensate for the added level of darkness caused by the glasses.  Still, the 3D effects were much more enjoyable than in many other so-called 3D movies, especially those poorly done 2D-to-3D conversions like ""Clash of the Titans"" and its sequel.

After watching ""Awakening,"" I had to buy the first 3 chapters in the story because I was so impressed with this one.  The earlier films focus a bit more on story and the history of the feud between the vampires and lycans.  It helps if you've seen those movies, but I don't think it's mandatory if you're in it just for the effects and butt-kicking action.  The movie opens with a short montage of clips as Selene explains what came before, then she talks about how a war to eradicate the vamps and werewolves began after humans discovered their existence.

It does set up a 5th movie in the set and movie rumors say that scott speedman is coming back as Micheal for the 5th movie in the set but guess we will just have to wait and see if it's true.  As for the movie itself I personally enjoy it, good story line and lots of action scenes.  I did agree with a few reviews that said they wish the super wearwolf had more air time on sceen.  But it was still a great movie and well worth waiting for it to be on DVD.  So if you love to watch vampire or wearwolf movies then pick this up and enjoy some good horror on a free evening with your buddies or just by yourself while relaxing from life or work.

Underworld: Awakening has a very poor plot due to a probably very limited budget. Whoever liked the first 3 movies,I suggest you purchase the Trilogy on Blu-Ray and watch it in high definition-you will not waste your time and money and will be satisfied at the end. Don't waste a minute of your precious time on Underworld: Awakening or if you are a die-hard fan of the series- simply rent it.

4954824,2,B0064YOWCI,"On the positive side the production quality was good, lots of action and Kate Beckinsale performance was impressive.  However, this movie is the worst in the franchise.  The plot was swallow and predictable.  Dialog was cliche.  And all the other actors were severely out classed by Beckinsale.  This movie focused on the action and effects scenes and the script was merely to connect those scenes.  The movie is fun to watch for the action and effects but nothing else.  This was just a poor attempt to milk the franchise for more money.",1341532800,2,538,4.782608695652174

I agree with other reviewers' comments that the Lycans are cartoon-like, there is no plot development or exposition, the characters are caricatures, and the movie is too short to develop any story line. I believe the goal of any sequel should be to improve on the story and continue to develop the characters, rather than to simply exploit the popularity of earlier installments to make a buck. The door has been left open for another sequel. Let's hope it's better than this. I feel like I wasted my money this time.",1341360000,2,625,4.743119266055046

I guess I wasn't expecting this to be just that.. the story line was weak and uninteresting. It was a lot of noise, no story.

4954846,2,B0064YOWCI,"This movie is a black hole that sucks all of the joy out of a once decent franchise. Kate Beckinsale in bondage-ware cannot save this steaming pile. As some are fond of quoting main press reviewers, I would suggest a trip to the Rotten Tomatoes website, where this movie has a rating of 27%. That's not too far from, say, Ishtar at 19% or Transformers: Dark Side Of The Moon at 35%. So if you must put credence in mainstream reviewers, you might want to avoid this one. Just by chance I happen to generally agree with them when it comes to this movie.

If you //are// successful at checking your brain at the door for this one, you are still subjected to plot holes, disappearing characters and a zombie-like walk through by the main star, who must have been paid a bundle to agree to come back to make this movie.

Len Wiseman should have done whatever it took to retain Danny McBride, he knows the story and legacy the best.

About the transfer for the 3d release, it wasn't what I expect according the other reviewers wrote about it, the 3D complement the movie but if you focus only in the 3D effects you may notice that is not one of the bests like Gahoole or Journey to the Center Of The Earth (the best ones I ever saw).

4954853,3,B0064YOWCI,"This movie has one thing going for it.  Kate Beckinsale returns as Selene.  She has been held upside down is some cryogenic capsule for 12 years.  She manages to escape thanks to some mysterious person, and here comes the good part.  She finds her black boots and black leatherette outfit.  That alone is cause for applause.

The rest of the film you've seen before.  It turns out that a 12 year old girl (do the math) has been held captive by an underground werewolf colony.  She's rescued by Selena - who has done the math - and a new hunky vampire (Theo James).  The werewolves are headed by scientist Dr. Lane (Stephen Rea) who has turned his son into some super duper giant sized wolf.  Plenty `o guts are expelled over the 88 minute running time.  I guess we'll have to wait for yet another installment to find out what kind of powers young Eve (India Eisley) might possess.

Another thing going for it is the spectacular Blu ray transfer.  In 1080p and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, you can't ask for much more, assuming your display can handle it.  Blacks are really black.  The detail is excellent.  No complaints.  Likewise, I don't remember such an all encompassing soundtrack.  The DTS-HD MA has a 7.1 surround availabilty and the surround is used liberally.

Can't wait for the next movie!

On the SteelBook itself.  It could be better.  I gather the company that shipped it just bought them from Best Buy.  Somewhere along the line it obtained some minor imperfections.  Not pleased with this.  A SteelBook should be durable and I bought it because I am a collector, obviously I paid the extra money to have an awesome looking movie in my collection.  Very disappointed at the damage to the case.

The manufacturer of the case should also be ashamed, or whoever selected the quality it was made at. This is the weakest quality of SteelBook I have ever bought.  There's no way to tell before you get it, but you assume a certain level of strength and weight to the steel when you invest the extra money.

It's a cool case, but overall disappointed in the quality of the SteelBook itself.  I have bought collector's editions for other things that have much better quality, specifically the Collector's editions to both Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3.

Will be wary of buying a SteelBook from Best Buy in the future (I know an Amazon vendor sold it, but it still had the Best Buy stickers on it overtop the plastic wrap, of which I am thankful because I knew it was an exclusive and didn't want to get a knockoff).",1339718400,,1511,4.447272727272727

As for the movie itself, it is really PACKED with action. There are only a few scenes where something big isn't happening.

4954875,3,B0064YOWCI,"I have liked all the underworlds so far, and enjoyed this one too. It took a particularly different angle from the previous movies and strayed away from the original storyline the other 3 shared. This one was more of a vampire vs human movie only with a twist towards the end. It also was much more violet with showing gore than the previous movies which I actually enjoyed. As also owning the Resident Evil 3D, it seems like this movie was made to mirror the same sort of 3D action scenes. I was not too impressed with the 3D in the movie as I felt it wasn't utilized until the last 30 minutes or so of the movie. Until that time I found myself wondering if I should switch it to 2D.
Personally, I would have liked to see a better continuation of the previous stories, but the didn't do that. It may have been because the could budget the Michael character into this movie much. I still did enjoy the movie and recommend it to any fan of the previous ones.

Pros:
+More violence than previous films in the series

Cons:

You must watch all four to get the point of what it is all about. The action is great and she does gets her point. I would make it a point for viewers to see all four.

Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.
----------------------------------------

Bought this from FYE for 15.99, they were having a special sale on it.  I have been looking forward to seeing this for some time.  Ever since I saw the original 'Underworld' and 'Underworld: Evolution' years ago I have been a fan.

Well...this one fell short, hard.  For starters, Scott Speedman did not return as Michael.  There was an extremely brief scene with ""Michael"" but the person was obviously not Speedman.  But this was only the beginning of the confusions for me.

**Spoilers Ahead/And a lot of Confusion**

For starters...how did we the humans find out about the vampires and lycans?  Why did a silver grenade have an effect on Michael?  Why did an ultraviolet blast stun Selene?  Was Selene pregnant, where did that hybrid child (her daughter) come from?  Why was Selene frozen for 12 years?  Why was she freed by that human, or did her daughter free her?  Speaking of her daughter, why did the lycans create her?  How could that guy become such a HUGE lycan?  I mean he was IMPOSSIBLY huge.  Are there any vampires left besides that one covern?  Where is this franchise going?

Whew.  Simply put I was stammered while watching this movie.  Don't get me wrong, it is action packed and has Selene kicking some serious ass.  She is definitely a hard-core chick who can take care of herself.  Unfortunately action and Beckinsale's hot looks are not enough to save this film.

Is this franchise dead?  No.  It could still be turned around, but the next film needs to be OUTSTANDING.  It needs story, well developed characters, and the return of Scott Speedman.  Here's an interesting concept for the next film, have the next one set 100 years in the future.  Then we could have a lot of cool sci fi elements in it, i.e. flying cars and laser guns.  Just a thought.

Is this worth buying?  Only if you are a die hard fan (like me) of this series.  BUT...buy this one cheap, it's not worth a lot.  It will no doubt go on sale very soon, wait and get it cheaply.  I could and probably should delve more into the film for this review, but in all honestly I would need to watch this a 2nd time to give it a fair shake.  Right now I don't want to watch it again, 'Prometheus' is calling me.  Here's hoping that it doesn't suck...

Well that's my 2 cents worth, got to go, nightshift at my job is awaiting me.  I feel like a vampire some times...",1338940800,,2684,4.631130063965885
4954881,1,B0064YOWCI,"I found this release to have no continuity with the previous releases if this was to be a continuation as there was not enough back story.  I have been a fan of this franchise, but with this release, I think is has fizzled out.",1338940800,,227,4.159090909090909

I have only watched the first and second in this series and found them to be pleasant time wasters. In this one however I could not get beyond the idea that our heroine in this version is nothing but  a mass murderer who deserves to be put down despite the sexy skintight leather she wears. Sorry fans, but the humans are the good guys and the vamps and lycans are nothing but killers that deserve to be eliminated from the world. 'Underworld: Awakening'  is pure action from beginning to end and lacks any story, pathos, romance, sympathy, or vampire/lycan mythology that made the originals so interested. The CGI is obvious and uninterested from the fake cloud of steam that hides a naked Kate Beckinsdale to the less than interesting lycans. This leaves us with a 3D bloodfest which is why I guess 'Bloody-Disgusting.com' loved it so much. My thumbs are down - way down.",1338854400,3,952,4.52906976744186

4954884,3,B0064YOWCI,"I really love Underworld and Underworld: Evolution. I'm not too keen on Underworld: Rise of the Lycans, but it was passable. Unfortunately, Underworld: Awakening is a sad entry for what could have been a great addition to the series.

If you remember Evolution that movie ended with big changes for Selene, Michael and the rest of the Vamp community. Awakening does not cover that period, instead it picks up 12 or so years after. What follows is a convulted plot that does answer most of the questions hardcore viewers are wondering about. The movie attempts to be a mysterious, but it fails to do so and just leaves you wondering why Kate B. would sign off on this drivel. After saying no to so many proposed sequels, she picks this script to say yes to. I'm shaking my head as a write this.

I haven't written off this franchise. It could improve. There seemed to be some new ground to explore, but I'm not liking where the series has gone and wish they would retcon this movie all together.

4954885,2,B0064YOWCI,"I can't believe I heard this was good.  The characters were extremely flat and dull, aside from the super werewolf who gets maybe 5 minutes of screen time.  Also the cop played by michael ealy, who is a great actor, was interesting at first, but quickly decides to be a from vampire supporter, killing his own kind in a mere instant.  My least favorite part was the little girl.  Talk about a dull whiny little kid---the same as any scared little kid you'd see in a movie.  The only thing that gets this two stars is that the effects were good and there were some cool action sequences, however this is nothing special any more, and the sciences were not even all that memorable.

I have seen better CGI visual effects in B-Movies, there were no REAL bad asses in this one and why not more Bryan instead of Chucky's big sister? I mean come on now nobody is really scared of a little girl who looks like a swoled up purple mini Hulk when she gets angry. This is BY FAR THE WORST OF ALL UNDERWORLDS. DO NOT WATCH IT. I will erase this movie from my memory just like I did with Terminator 3 Rise of the machines. Seriously though, they could have just asked ME to do this movie in my spare time after work and after playing with the kids, at least i would have spent more time on the visual effects. How lazy can you get? Visual effects through CGI are much less labor intensive and were once used for skimping on Special effects done with Pyrotechnics and extremely talented make-up artists and modelers.

4954896,4,B0064YOWCI,"Why can't they all just get along? The Vampires and Werewolves ""at each others throats"" for so many generations instead of letting bygones be bygones and teaming up to feed on us mere mortals...I mean...how silly! Well I guess it's a good thing for us though, no? Because without the war there would be no action-packed Underworld series.

I'll try to keep this short since my review is a tad bit late to the party: The beginning of Awakening suggests that approximately 12 years ago the humans executed a major Vampire/Werewolf (Lycan) cleansing, but Selene (Kate Beckensale) was captured and frozen cryogenically in an experimental biotech lab. All other Vampires and Lycans have supposedly been exterminated...for the most part. Immortal survivors are in hiding literally underground...or should I say ""Underworld"". An unknown entity frees Selene from her ice-prison, and she creates absolute mayhem for anyone in her way to find out what has happened and where her beloved Vampire/Lycan hybrid Michael is.

The effects in the entire series have been great and Awakening only improves on the tradition. The movie is a dark, but visual spectacular. There's suspense, tons of action and a great storyline from the start of the prequel called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rise-of-the-Lycans/dp/B001VLFE7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rise of the Lycans</a>, to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-original/dp/B000TGJ80I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the original</a>, through&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evolution/dp/B000F6IOBG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evolution</a>&nbsp;and right up to Awakening.

All in all a very well done continuation of the story that pays to watch from the beginning. Yes, Awakening stands alone, but this is one movie that I believe was not intended for seeing prior to its predecessors. So if you haven't already, you'll want to view both Underworld and Underworld Evolution and watch them in order. The prequel Rise is certainly not necessary, but it does add a bit of perspective and history to the story.

4954897,2,B0064YOWCI,"What's with all the 5 star reviews? Are these people middle-schoolers or production/distribution company lackeys?

I'm a fan, but this new addition is an embarrassment to Len Wiseman's brainchild and Kate Beckinsale's talent. After the first 15 minutes, it becomes obvious that this is nothing more than a revenue generator. The writing had flashes of brilliance, but it means nothing when the directing and overall production is amateur. I was optimistic that the quality would be on par with past installments, but I was wrong. Very disappointing to one of my favorite franchises and I sincerely hope a 5th addition is axed to save from adding insult to injury. Len, what happened???",1338336000,,685,5.116071428571429
4954898,1,B0064YOWCI,"Being a huge fan of the first Underworld movie, I went into Underworld: Awakening with an open mind and low expectations. I was at least excited to see the ever lovely Kate Beckinsale make a return to the series, but that was as far as my excitement developed. As said in the other reviews, the plot and effects were awful, and for the most part, the acting was subpar. As somewhat of an effects artist myself, I was sad to see a departure from the great traditional effects (designed by the awesome Patrick Tatopoulos) only approach used in the first movie, to the use of really crappy CG work (also designed by Patrick Tatopoulos). Please, either give up on making this series, or let the original group of writers write and direct the sequel (if there is one), and please let Mr. Tatopoulos use traditional effects again instead of mediocre CG. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE.",1338249600,2,886,4.578616352201258
4954899,3,B0064YOWCI,"One of the most entertaining things about the first two UNDERWORLD films is that they were actioners through and through. They didn't bother with the ""reality"" of the world; They just gave us the situation: There were Vampires who all dressed like they went to a fetish boutique, and there were Werewolves aka Lycans who were living like the animals of their namesake and both of these mythical creatures had been at war for centures. We followed the adventures of Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a ""death-dealer"" vampire who fell in love with Michael (Scott Speedman), a human who became a hybrid lycan-vampire. Over the course of their forbidden love, they killed both vampires and lycans (well, in all fairness, Selene does 99% of the killing; and despite Michael's supposed ""power"", he barely kills anything) and became hunted by both. Under the direction of Len Wiseman, who did UNDERWORLD and UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION, the story was bloody, wild, exciting, sexy and darned entertaining. Then we got UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS, directed by the great production designer Patrick Tatopolis, and that was a big mess of a prequel designed to shed more light on why the war started and to elaborate on the characters of Lucien (a lycan) and Sonja (a vampire) and their forbidden love. That film was almost unwatchable, and not because it was so bad, but because the film's lighting in almost every scene is so incredibly dark it looks like they shot it entirely in a black hole.

Now we have UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING directed by Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein, a Swedish filmmaking duo, and this is their first major studio release. U: A begins with an energetic and shocking opening as humans have discovered the existence of vampires and werewolves and are in the process of exterminating them all. Gone are the days of the fun, comic-booky adventures of orgiastic violence and almost campy intrigue and now we have a film that is trying to hold a mirror up to the human condition. Words like ""Purge"" and ""Cleansing"" are used as Humanity bands together to wipe out these ""sub-human"" monsters. Selene and Michael are trying to escape to safety, but these jack-booted kill squads find them and...

The next thing we know is that Selene is in a research lab of the AntiGen Corporation hanging upside-down and naked in cryogenic stasis but is being released by something referred to as Subject Two. Selene, once released, finds all of her old clothes (the latex skintight bodysuit, the cool boots, the leather bustier) just being stored in a glass container. Before you can say ""suspension of disbelief"", she's back to blue-eyed business killing everybody she sees in order to escape and also to find Michael. What she does find is an ally in the impossibly handsome David (Theo James, all cheekbones) and the fact that she's been in stasis for 12 years. We also meet the antagonist, a very Mengele-type big-shot doctor, Jacob Lane (the usually terrific Stephen Rea, trying desperately to keep his face out there), who seems determined to make sure that the government and his own private army get Selene and Subject Two back. We then find that Subject Two is a 12-year-old girl (what a coincidence!) named Eve, who is a hybrid, like Michael (another coincidence!). I won't spoil who she is, but Selene suddenly has a really big reason to protect her. In the midst of all this, David's father Thomas (the great Charles Dance), the leader of a nearby vampire coven, looks to run and hide, and his headstrong son looks to stand their ground and fight against the humans. Then we get a Hulk-sized lycan, a vampire-friendly cop (Michael Ealy), and a really fun final act where all the serious stuff goes out the window in favor of watching Selene blast her way through impossible odds with her twin machine pistols.

While the previous films haven't been really big on character development, they did slow down enough to allow some of the newer characters to breathe life into those characters. This is another in the long line of ""We can't make the characters relatable, so at least we'll make them blow stuff up"" action films, like the masters of that kind of cinema (Michael Bay, Roland Emmerich) but with a tenth of the budget they get. My three biggest problems with the film are these:

First is that Marlind and Stein seem to be combining the styles of both Wiseman and Tatopolis without any real style of their own. The film does have some pretty fun gags and setpieces like the Wiseman films do, but the film also looks really dark, which may be less of a stylistic choice and more of a symptom of the standard sub-standard lousy 3D post-conversion.

Second, the entire cast, with maybe the exception of Beckinsale, seems to be cashing a check here. They don't really do anything interesting or have anything interesting to do other than stand around and glare occasionally. Becks (that's what I call her) knows that this franchise is built around her and she needs to be on her game. The rest of the cast seems to be sleep-walking. And was Wes Bentley just in the neighborhood when they were filming? Because that was a waste of talent and he's certainly not recognizable enough to be a ""cameo"". That was just bizarre.

Third, and perhaps the biggest turn-off, is the injection of unnecessary allegorical storytelling that's too much of a reminder of reality to really allow for the same kind of popcorn-munching entertainment that the first two films had going for them. While the first two films were not the breeziest pieces of entertainment, they never took themselves too seriously. With AWAKENING, there's the blasts of violence and energy to the film, but then it's weighed itself down with the persecution of vampires and lycans by humans, some of whom have an interest in creating a more ""superior"" race. Of course, a film with four different screenwriters (one of them being Wiseman himself and another being J. Michael Straczynski, who is best-loved as creating the TV program BABYLON 5, and who is most-hated for really screwing up Spider-Man during his run on the comic book), someone is bound to trip over someone else's ideas. It seems like each writer wrote about 30 pages of the script and then handed it to another writer with a completely different style wanting to tell a completely different story. if you watch the film, you may notice that the tone shifts about seven times throughout the runtime. The allegory within the film is absolutely without any kind of merit since the films themselves were able to sustain themselves simply on the conceit of Vampires vs Werewolves.

That being said, the film is pretty entertaining once you get past all the heavy-handedness. Becks continues to rock the outfit VERY well, and while her tone is much more serious here than it's been before, she plays it well. And to be fair to Marlind and Stein here, at least every shot of Selene walking away from the camera isn't shot at buttock-level, like Wiseman (Kate's husband) did constantly. The final act is a lot of fun, except there was one thing (a pretty important thing to be sure, as far as plot is concerned) that I was waiting for that just didn't come, presumably because they're saving it for a sequel.

One more thing: The idea of the Hybrid being this all-powerful being was kind of stupid until this film, because we finally see a Hybrid doing a good amount of damage.

It's not the most pleasant of universes to step in as far as the New World Order of UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING to visit, and you surely don't want to live there, but it's not an altogether terrible place to visit.",1338076800,3,7595,4.787185354691076

What follows is a story of capture and experimentation to find an antidote to the viruses that cause the changing of mankind into the lycans or the vampires. But whose side are the doctors really working on?????

This is a good story and it is really well written. It is nonstop action and it features some very good fight scenes and outstanding special effects. This is a very good continuation of the Underworld saga and if you liked the first movies you will like this one also.

My only negatives are why everything has to be filmed in the dark or with flickering lights. This effect is being used by so many Directors today and I hate it.

Apparently Selene has given Michael a daughter, which neither of them gets to meet for twelve years due to being captured and cryogenically caged.  We aren't shown an intimate copulation scene, so it is possible gene splicing in a laboratory was done in vitro style.  This clearly is a stepping stone into what is hoped by the producers to be a very lucrative and long term franchise.  I may only be one fan, but I'm going to suggest that they don't make special FX more affordable by using foggy darkness and blurred camera shots.  Obviously vampires don't need a lot of light to git-r-done, and lycans aren't given to requiring light either; however, YOUR  VIEWERS DO ya morons.  This sequel is a pitiful example of reclining upon the laurels of past accomplishments, using similar themes and exploiting Kate Beckinsale's physical attraction so thoroughly I'm surprised she wasn't wrung out like she'd been through a juicer.  I'm losing interest in the ""Underworld"" series after seeing how the producers are short-sheeting their fans in this latest film.  When I started watching the series in 2003, I was very eager to get my hands on ""Evolution,"" and ""Rise of the Lycans.""  I pre-ordered this 4th sequel, ""Awakening"" hoping it would continue to build on how intensely amazing the first three were.  Please don't spend all the budget on red epic 3-D camera gadgetry.  How can something that starts out so great end up so mediocre??  The producers are still over $177 million in the black, from the first four in this series, and need to re-invest some of it.  I will give them one more chance, but if ""Underworld"" sequel five sags from the first four like ""Awakening"" did from the first three, this fan is done, regardless of how tight Kate Beckinsale's latex cat suit gets.

This time though, it's just in spectacular 3D. Filmed with RED Epic 3D cameras, I can honestly say that this ranks with some of the best 3D I've ever seen before. As a Film student, I can tell you that it looks spectacular. The clean digital photography added to the fact that the film was actually SHOT in 3D rather than post converted makes a massive amount of difference.

A lot of people have been complaining about the 3D blu-ray because apparently it doesn't play in 2D. Well, when I bought mine from Wal-Mart, it said on the case that it DOES play in 2D as well. If you have a 3D TV, then that means your TV has the ability to convert to 3D as well. All you have to do is turn the 3D off on your TV, and voila! Crystal clear 1080p picture in 2D. The only thing I was rather disappointed with was the fact that there weren't many special features. Being a film student, I was curious to know how it was filmed and how it differed from shooting in 2D.

Spoiler:

It made more sense to me that this was actually a movie that kept with its tradition of vampire vs. werewolves and not both vs. humans. It was interesting to see the werewolves in control, getting the upper hand, but the story lacked a substance. There was hardly any meat on these offered bones.

Ultimately this film repeats the predictable and successful devices used to create the small franchise.  Vampires battling Lycans to the death, tons of gun play, minimal storyline supported by ample action, and Kate Beckinsale's latex outfit testing the structural integrity of viewers' zippers.  Sure, there is a hybrid daughter storyline used as a first step in the next spiral staircase of this series, and a little subterfuge, but both are actually afterthought in the grand scheme bullets, FX, and latex.

The major negatives of this film revolve around lighting and sound.  Adapting to the vampire/night motif is one thing; filming with engine oil over the camera lens during an eclipse is something completely different.  In other words, tons of scenes - some major actions sequences - too dark to discern.  The sound is equally egregious.  There are large stretches of filming with a distracting bass rumble that not only detracts from the overall viewing pleasure, but also causes headaches.  Hint: Every once in a while move your hand to the other side of the synthesizer.

4954930,3,B0064YOWCI,"The humans have ""noticed"" the vampires and lycans and are quite reasonably annoyed that they've been milking us for blood for centuries. A pogrom ensues and the few surviving undead have gone underground. Selene and Michael have been captured and have been in deep freeze for over a decade. Selene escapes, but who let her go?

And so we arrive at part 4 of the Underworld franchise. A new production team but no new ideas. Let's start with the bad and move onto the good...

Plot? there ain't none. There's a back-story, the story-boarders were clearly very busy bees, but there's no >story<. The cast run around a lot, look gorgeous or gross (depending on species) but no-one is really achieving much or going anywhere. Well, I guess you don't pick something like Underworld up at the video store after thinking ""Hmm, a good, complex story with twists, turns, chicanery and various other alarums and excursions is what I REALLY want tonight..."" but they could have made an effort couldn't they? The first two Underworlds had plot; tensions, surprises and so-on - complexity, however simplistic... how hard can it be?

Really though, Awakening is a vehicle. A vehicle for two things - the lovely Kate and some quite astonishing quantities of gore. That brings us to the good. Kate Beckinsale certainly is easy on the eye. Her skintight PVC uniform returns, and she certainly knows how to use it: her moves are familiar (if a tad... predictable); leaping from buildings, swirling of leather greatcoats, straining of bodices and gussets. For those of you who prefer good looking fellas? Well I'm hardly qualified to comment but this is a bloke flick so you ladies will have to make do with Theo James, because Stephen Rea and Charles Dance (doing a creditable, if unimaginative Bill Nighy impression) probably won't ring too many bells and a digitally projected Scott Speedman spends most of his screen-time upside-down in a fridge.

The gore... oh the gore. There's nothing subtle about Underworld Awakening. The previous episodes were bloody, but Awakening turns it up to 11, with head-shots, decapitations and the traumatic (and often manual) removal of critical organs. Even Selene's sweet, 12 year old daughter (and that barely counts as a spoiler, I can assure you) gets in on the act, ripping lycans in half down the medial line and so-on. OK, so it's a vampire/werewolf flick and we should expect stuff like this. It's fine. I can enjoy a good, brutalising evisceration like any normal person, but it does get a little... indecent? Desensitising? Dare I say it... unimaginative?

So there you go. More of the same (as a fellow reviewer has already said). I truly loved the first, enjoyed the second and was disappointed by the third. I think, for all its faults, Awakening is still a good gore fest, undead actioner, excellent for a Friday or Saturday night after coming home from the pub and it falls somewhere between its predecessors. Good but not great. Acceptable but not aspirational. I'll give it 3 stars. I'd like to give it 4, but I think 3 is the best I can do at the moment.

This is a 2 disc edition and the second has the usual line up of extras that I haven't yet got around to watching (or even listing). I shall remedy that at the soonest opportunity.",1337212800,2,3274,4.785840707964602

I didn't see the prequel one (which I believe was the third one) but really enjoyed the first two movies.

This movie is about an hour and a half long, but if you cut out the action scenes (by action I mean anything with violence in it) you'd have a movie about 15 minutes long that is nothing but back story. The graphics were pretty pathetic and every scene involved the lights flickering off and on. Very obvious special effects, especially in a scene where Selene is holding someone up to a window. That scene the green screen effect was very low quality.

My husband and I watched this together, and after and hour and a half we were both like ""Finally! The movie is really going to start now!"" and they left a cliff hanger for the next movie instead. -.- My only other comment was ""the writers were reading Twilight"".

It wouldn't of taken much to make this movie ALOT better. But the writers and director decided to skimp in certain areas. I'm sure they thought it wouldn't make that much of a difference, but it does.

It's the difference between an 'Ok' movie and a box office hit.

Most people wouldn't even notice that the movie is crap, because we're used to it. We're used to creative laziness. We see something that makes no sense in any universe and just write it off as ""It's just a movie! It's not real life! Get over it!! That fight scene was off the hook!!!"".
The writers and director could of EASILY made parts of the movie more believable and it would of made the whole immersion of the movie so much better.

When we see things that don't make any sense, and don't believe for one second that we don't see when you're being lazy, it ruins the 'mood'.

The movie starts with Selene and Michael trying to escape from humans who are awake to their presence and determined to eradicate vampires and werewolves.

India Eisley joins the cast as another test subject whose identity will probably not surprise anyone in the audience. Stephen Rea also stars as the head scientist, and his true agenda was actually a welcome surprise. Michael Ealy gets far too little screen time as a human detective with a story of his own, and Theo James brings some enjoyable eye candy but no romantic tension. Sandrine Holt is also very good in the few scenes she gets, and if you're familiar with Kris Holden-Reid's work you'll get a kick out of him here. There are some dysfunctional family subplots, but they aren't developed as thoroughly here as in previous outings. The cast is great, the twists are pretty good, and the action sequences are better than ever, but there is just too little plot developed in too short a time, and without the doomed romance that has up til now been central to these movies, there is a lot of pathos missing.

4954946,2,B0064YOWCI,"I had really high hopes for this movie when I heard that it was coming out. The teasers gave it just the right edge, but the reality was different. Making this movies was one of those ideas that seems better than it actually turns out to be. I could have said the same about ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"", but that's for another time.

We start with Selene recaping the Lycan/Vampire war leading up to her meeting Michael. Then it's like ""Houston, we have a problem--The Humans are trying to exterminate the Lycans, the Vampires, and us along with them."" Selene & Michael are captured, and spend the next decade or so on ice until they are able to escape, helped by the mysterious ""subject 2""  Ok---no more spoilers.

As far as the film itself, Kate Beckinsale starts strong, but gets bogged down trying to figure out where/when she is, and trying to find Michael. Michael appears in a couple of ""blink & you'll miss him shots"". It turns out that ""Michael"" is actually Scott Speedman's face digitally superimposed on a stand in. The production values seemed dark--Not grim & serious, but ""who turned out the lights?""  Were they trying to save money? This is not to mention that some of the most important dialogue seemed forced and awkward.

A lot of important details were either glossed over or omitted entirely. But then, what do you expect from a movie that's only 78 minutes long??? I'm hoping that an extended cut of this film will be released at some point. Maybe that will fill in the gaps until the next sequel.",1336953600,2,1523,4.605166051660516

Nice pace, sets, mood, CGI especially of the Lycans. The storyline started out fairly interesting but became disjointed (jumped around with not much character depth, thematics and scene continuity) and eventually just sort of ran out of creative gas. Acting was OK although there isn't much acting involved. Action scenes were mostly green screen and wires and seemed old and tiresomely redundant to what's been done in movies now for decades. Kate looks the part but her personality doesn't come through as an action figure you don't want to mess with.

an ""UltraViolet"" digital copy, and boy, what a mistake. I've spent the last two hours signing up on various websites (Sony, UltraViolet, Flixster) just to get this movie to play on my iPad, and it still doesn't work. The entire process is plagued by a horrible user experience, every time you have completed a step, there is another one which just makes you scratch your head. Besides signing up, you will need to install a download manager ... which lets you download the movie, and great, then you have it on your computer, and you still can't move it into your Itunes.

I could go on and on and on, but at this point I've learned my lesson. I just rather go straight to ITunes and purchase it there and done. Not worth the trouble. I'll stay away from anything that says UltraViolet digital copy in the future. What a joke, really.

All the effects have been utilize before.  The giant werewolf was a cheesy as a bad Hulk. The movie clocked in under 90 minutes.  why did you guys ruin the series with this mess?  Even the one without Kate was superior to this hastily made running through the motions film.  The film clocked in at under 90 minutes and the editing was excessively choppy leaving one with the feeling that a reel or two had been left on the cutting room floor.  The cheap voiceover at the beginning actually summed up what might have been an excellent movie (i.e. vampires and werewolves had been discovered by humans as being real and then were summarily ""cleansed"" from the face of the planet. Oh think what political themes and Nazi/republican slants could have been realized).  But NOOOO!  Instead, we are presented with a Saturday morning movie with action sans substance.

It's okay if you are just looking to mindlessly entertained for two hours. But the movie did very little to add to the story. It was more like it was just a set-up for the next movie.

Eve's character was very disappointing. They did not develope her character at all. She went from a scared child to a powerful monster in minutes. You learned nothing about her life or who she is. Nor was there any developement of Selene's character. While we all knew that both were going to survive, this movie does nothing to make you care whether they lived or not.

4954971,4,B0064YOWCI,"I waited to see this movie because it was so short on running time that I could not feel good about paying the same price for movies at least 30 mins longer or more that are just as enjoyable on the big screen.  That is just the practical side of my ideas about spending my money on films.

I can only hope that this ""movie"" which is only 1:22 not including the credits which are almost 10 minutes long with at least three different hairdressers listed in three different locations on the credits roll just for Ms. Beckinsale.  Whoa, that's a lot of hair manipulation for someone with a short hair style.  I wonder how many ""Trinity"" had with the change from greased down to short and scruffy?  And it's not just that, but it seems that there are literally three entire sets of credits from the Gaffers and Grips to the CGI & FX makeup teams.  I was also surprise that Ms. Beckinsale had not one dime of her own money into this project since the franchise has been a successful one.

But now onto the movie itself...  WARNING WARNING - SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

As I said - I can only hope this is a long teaser for a new cycle of movies with or without Ms. Beckinsale.  She is starting to get along in years and playing an immortal character that does not age or get more ""mature looking"" has got to be considered if the stories are to continue as well if Scott Speedman is no longer going to be the other leading immortal character of Michael Corvinus (sp?)

The story shows Selene getting blown apart from her man Michael by some sort of UV grenade by the mortal police forces in the beginning. We next see her frozen (tastefully not naked although very obviously nude in the container) with very well place fog and other obstacles, escaping with some help from a cyro-freezer after what turns out to be 12 years into a world without Lycans, and very few Vampires.  It's told that she (Selene) is labeled Patient #1 as it blares across the warning system.  And that she has ""some sort of"" special connection and link with patient #2. It's announced that both can each see through the eyes of the other.  Naturally we the audience thinks it is Michael who is patient #2.  But it's actually Selene's 12 year old daughter who is a human-hybrid mostly looking like Michael with the blue/black eyes and nearly black skin color change.  She's never been outside, never fed as a Vampire, etc.  But she knows she's Mom when she sees her and vice-versa.

Those familiar with the first two movies which of the three are the only ones with Selene in them and time line is from the beginning of movie 1 thru the end of movie 2.  One long storyline which I thought worked very well.  I'm just trying to keep with Selene/Michael for this is long enough already.

Here are just a few of the many things I have a problem with in this movie...
1) Vampires are ""dead"" beings, they cannot have children - yet Selene has a child during her 12 years of being captured and frozen.
2) Michael did ""die"" in the middle of movie 2 but Selene fed him blood that she had after being given the 100% ""pure blood"" of the first of both sides of the immortal creatures in this storyline ""Grandpa""  Corvinus himself (such a nice guy for an immortal who did nothing except have more money than can be counted, hire very loyal people to ""clean up"" Vampire and Lycan ""messes"", etc. and allowed himself to be killed by his Vampire son.) which gave her enough strength to beat the first Vampire ever who would be the strongest as in this storyline age equals abilities and strength as well as the blood it comes from.
...However, since Michael died, he might have been brought back, but he was brought back in the Vampire way of becoming UNdead.  Not alive as he found out when trying to eat solid food which caused him great physical pain - this was shown in the first movie when he was just Lycan.  So - how can two dead people produce a child???  This is one BIG problem for me and nothing was even mentioned about it in this movie.

Then we see the Vampires are actually far worse off than the Lycans, because the Lycans kept themselves hidden during the 1st & 2nd ""Purge"" as the movie calls the human eradication of all Lycans and Vampires.  Really??  That must have been one bunch of sissy Vampires with no elders to lead them to be decimated to near extinction by humans.  Same for the Lycans or so everyone thought, but nope...the Lycans in the great tradition of Lucian.  Sneaky and seemingly much smarter when it comes to staying alive and powerful. Now we have Dinosaur sized Lycan due to years of experimentation by the Lycans who were thought to be humans using the blood of Selene, of daughter and yep - you guessed the ending...Michael.  The first Lycan Vampire hybrid which would make him extremely powerful, but the daughter has BOTH original Corvinus blood which makes her immune to Daylight, as well as Silver, and pretty much everything else that would destroy typical Vampires and Werewolves.

So now we have the ultimate undead family of good hearted, but very fierce, Uber-Vampire Selene aka Mom, 1st hybrid Lycan that all other Lycans were supposed to yield to as shown in the ending of the first movie, and the Uber being with everything on the positive side for being powerful with not one single weakness...Mama & Daddy's little girl.  And with all that, it's very possible that she is also a triple threat - the daughter I think is mostly plain ole human on top of the duality of being a hybrid Lycan/Vampire.  One older doctor Vampire Lady was looking for her original bite marks and couldn't find any.  Of course not, she wasn't turned, she was...born???  How exactly did that happen, or is this a test-tube kinda thing??  Again...no idea from this movie.

And all this with no real explanations about most things that had happened in 12 years of Cryo-Sleep (hmmm - ""Ripley"" was asleep for 57 years), lots of very good FX, some excellent fight scenes and very excellence kill shots and other well done gore FX.  Now what?

Yes - all that I typed just to sum up what this movie only put into motion with an ending that certainly screams...NEXT MOVIE COMING UP!!  But who, where, what, why, etc., etc.  It's all set in the near future, but if Selene's last thoughts were of getting the Vampires back to the top of the food chain and powerful and a collective nation...Doesn't this seem a bit much like Blade 2 or 3 except that the Vampires are the ""good guys""?

Did this help or just make everything much more confusing?",1336521600,,6514,4.489397794741306
4954972,4,B0064YOWCI,"I loved the movie. I like that Selene had a daughter. I'm wondering what will happen to Eve. Who she will meet, what her life will be like now that she is not a science experiment????? Will Michael find out about Eve?

What I do not like about the movie is that Michael was nowhere to be found. The romance between Michael and Selene is dry. I know Selene and Michael never had a chance to get to know each other because of all the vampire and Lycan war. Which opens more questions?? Everyone knows that Lucian and Sonja Viktor's daughter fell in love and that is why the war started to begin with. We all read the books and saw the movies. The love between them was made believable. I fell in-love with the characters to the point that it saddened me the Lucian died.

In the case of Michael and Selene there was no love not like Sonja and Lucian. They had a child together but that is it. Why did they fall for one another????? Why is Selene so obsessed in being with Michael???? Sometimes I think that they are together because they are attracted to one another. They got caught in the heat of the moment, and Eve was created. I believe that Michael does not love Selene but only is attracted to her. She the only one who is keeping him alive.

Why did they fall in love so fast? I like an explanation to all this.
I want more of Viktor and Llona history.
More about Marcus life as a vampire and what about Marcus son, what ever happened to him?
Bring Viktor back, and Lucian I don't care if there dead.

 Michael and Selene meet and in 3 days Viktor, Lucian and Amelia are dead. Marcus is dead as well, but they never had time to stop and think, hey is this love I feel for you or is it something like a one night stand. Michael was pushed into this Lycan and Vampire war. He never imagined that he'd be in some strange underworld with a VAMPIRE named Selene with super human strength. In the next movie I like more love and action fighting parts too, but more love. What will happen to them will their relationship last when everything ends? Bad idea leaving Michael out of the movie. Not good.

The Underworld series was great and the plots were fabulous. A WOMAN saved a human Man's life hundreds of times. That is the reason why I love the movies. I mean, this man runs for his life gets into trouble and Selene the warrior Death Dealer comes to the rescue. That's great!

4954980,4,B0064YOWCI,"So what if this movie is predictable? It is a fun ride. If anyone is looking for a cerebral movie, this isn't it. I was really hoping all these years that Selene would return and with a child. After being suspended in time for a few years she does. But where's the child? Some spoilers ahead. Aha! Enter the evil scientists'. They captured Selene and Michael, imprisoned them in cryo tanks and took their child to perform experiments on. They have waited impatiently until child reached menses age in order to harvest genetic material.  Over time she has ""felt"" a closeness to Selene so she releases her and Selene proceeds to wreak havoc and create mayhem. Her boy friend disappeared, she thinks he is dead. She doesn't know she has had a child just yet. Selene is REALLY ANGRY and REALLY MEAN. She has much greater powers now. She slays her way to the heart of the problem where she nearly meets her match in a monstrous monster of a Lycan. Evil scientist just happens to be Lycan and he and others are creating uber Lycans immune to silver. The battle rages on. Did I mention that Child is not a ""child"" but a hybrid, daughter of Selene and Michael? Child dislikes head Scientist intensely. She kicks adz as well as her mother, ridding the world of Evil Scientist quite handily. Listen for the double entendre after she does that.  Selene finds Michael while decimating security personnel and Lycans and she shoots a hole in the cryo chamber to set him free while she continues to rid the world of Lycans. The ending finds Selene and Eve(?) and a helpful vampire entering the room where Michael was imprisoned but just ""that much"" too late for he has disappeared yet again. They race to the roof to see a helicopter vanish in the night sky. This role belongs to Kate. Without her there would be no Underworld series. I am glad they are back.

4954982,4,B0064YOWCI,"I watched Underworld Awakening with low expectations because I'd heard it had low reviews.
I was expecting fun action but didn't know if there would be any story or characterization to go with it.
I was extremely disappointed with Rise of the Lycans and felt that story idea was a great story that could've have been told allot more powerfully.
So I was concerned about the quality level of Underworld Awakening. I thought it might do a disservice to the original Underworld ethos.
I was pleasantly surprised. Underworld Awakening is an engaging and suspenseful action movie from the beginning.
It is everything an action movie should be and the action and related suspense is well done.
But it is more than just meaningless action. It has a good story to it.
The desires and motivations of the characters are well portrayed. There are a number of surprises and plot twists as well.
What I'm trying to say is that the action is driven by the motivation, desires and emotions of Selene and the other characters.
The movie does move at a frenetic, breakneck pace but there is depth in the story, not just meaningless action.
I've seen plenty of meaningless, banal action movies and I detest them so I'm not one who is quick to praise every action movie just because of the ""wow"" factor.
I require more than explosions, spectacular fight scenes and action. I require that there be a story and that there be characterization, that the movie has depth. And good directing is really nice and rather essential too.
Don't believe the poor reviews of this movie. Those people simply don't understand it or mistake it for something else.
If you liked the first Underworld movie, you'll like this one.
If you liked the sequel you'll love this one.
I thought the sequel to Underworld was okay and a bit of a letdown in some ways, however still possessing good qualities. But this movie, in my mind, captures the magic of the original movie, albeit in a different way.
I think some people are put off by the pace of the movie, that the whole movie takes place in no more than 2 to 3 days.
That isn't a problem for me.
Bottom line:
The story carries the action and makes this movie meaningful, enjoyable and satisfying.
If there is a sequel to this one (and the ending of Awakening begs for a sequel) I hope it is a well directed, well scripted movie that the creators take seriously and not just driven by hollywood greed.
Excellent movie - Don't believe the poor reviewers - Highly recommended.",1336435200,8,2482,4.6431818181818185

4954986,3,B0064YOWCI,"I finished watching Underworld Awakening and found myself unimpressed.

The story for this movie just wasn't that good, and I would consider it the worst of the series so far. Kate Beckinsale carries the movie, but only because she is very beautiful. That by itself helps to improve or cover up the other areas of the movie that are lacking. Some reviews say they finished this movie wanting more. I finished this movie saying is this it?

Kate has done a good job playing her part in all the movies, and they are lucky they have someone like her to make up for the poor story that she was given. I wish she would come to my house and bite me, but the movie itself was just mediocre. Good enough to rent one and never look at it again.",1336435200,,735,4.280575539568345

4954990,1,B0064YOWCI,"Huge fan of the Underworld with the 1st (dominant vampires) and 3rd (dominant lycans) being my favorites.  The 2nd was a disappointment to me as it killed off Corvinas and his two sons (one bitten by bat and the other by wolf).  This 4th installment is dead last imo.  The futuristic story line that has Selene and her child venturing into a world where Vampire and Lycan are hunted by humans is boring.  The made up - unknown city where a giant lab and their workers control the population through vaccinations is very similar to Resident Evil.  Although, isn't it the same story line in a lot of D list movies.  This installment is nothing more than images thrown together with fight scenes, very little dialogue, Lycan heads exploding with gunfire, and a lot of fog/mist.  There apparently isn't much daylight in this pharmaceutically controlled futuristic city.  For some reason, they are unwilling to let go of the character, Michael.  Note: he was horrible in the second installment and having his offspring run around doesn't do anything for this storyline.  With the elders gone, the Vampires underground, and Lycans looking like oversized rats this movie failed.  A story as old as time:  Vampire against Lycan and humans seeking protection from the Vampires.  It shouldn't have changed.",1336435200,14,1296,4.944444444444445

I downloaded it and linked it with my vudu and coincidentally this is one of the few movies that will not play on vudu due to Sonys decision. They should have kept the digital copy compatable with iTunes.

4954993,4,B0064YOWCI,"Underworld awakening doesn't have many flaws. It gives a short paraphrasing of early prequels to continue the underworld saga. The film includes humans now involved in the battle with some twists and turns of similar kryogenically frozen plots and more family members included. The movie basically mainly involves the camera following around kate beckinsale while others help her try to reunite with her love then her daughter. I did enjoy it, however I thought the film could have been longer and more detailed. It seemed they did not spend that much time on this movie but kind of made this as ""fast food"" film. With that being said I'm a satisfied customer with this rental. I look forward to the next one. thanks. Godbless

Not that Rise was a bad movie, it was a prequel when I wanted a sequel.  Nevertheless, this movie has all the hallmarks of the franchise, and then some.  Plus, it sets it up nicely for the next movie should there be one.  If you enjoyed Underworld 1 and 2, you will certainly enjoy this entry in the series.

A side note: The digital copy you get will be only accessible through the Ultraviolet platform.  In my opinion, the far inferior method of delivering digital copies.  Too many steps to get to your digital copy, plus you don't actually get a digital copy of your product (as in the file), you just get access to it in Ultraviolet's cloud.  At least with iTunes, if Apple goes kaput tomorrow, I still have my digital copy that will run on any number of platforms (Media player, DivX, etc.) whereas Ultraviolet and Flixster have encoded the copies so they can only be played by their programs.

4954999,5,B0064YOWCI,"Underworld Awakening is a great film for people that love the edgy, vampire movie genre- not the ""sparkly"" kind.

Pros:
1) Kate Beckinsale is back in the films
2) They added solid characters/actors to the cast: India Eisley, Charles Dance, and Theo James;  India Eisley the actress that plays Subject 2 is another hybrid and was able to do the whole ""transformation"" without it looking awkward.
3) They gave some more depth to the main character Selene, as another reviewer mentioned, she is no longer killing for the sake of killing and revenge, but to protect someone.
4) There wasn't a single ""sparkly"" vampire

Cons:
1) Scott Speedman is not in the film, he was previously committed to another film at the time, but hopefully the next film he will be able to do
2.  It was too short- which is a mark of a good film when you wish it was longer.",1335916800,3,847,4.516339869281046
4955000,4,B0064YOWCI,"Overall, I was very impressed with Underworld Awakening.  I was a little skeptical at first being that this is the 4th in the Underworld film series and, well, as we all know, sequels can be terrible the majority of the time. I am a big fan of the Underworld series and this does not disappoint any fan of the series.  I was fortunate enough to see the film in the theater and I was also fortunate to see it in it's intended format of 3D using the ultra modern 3D filming techniques, which add's incredible depth and perspective to the movie.  In it's intended format, it really envelopes you in the movie experience.  You almost feel as if you are there, and that's no exaggeration, it was simply incredible the way this movie was filmed.  I wish all the Underworld movies had been filmed this way, unfortunately, the technology was not available when the first films in the series were made.  Kate Beckinsale is, as always, fantastic in her portrayal as Selene.  I have always been a fan of Stephen Rea, who is one of the best actors on this planet, period!  He gives a good performance in this movie as a mad doctor obsessed with getting rid of the Vamps and increasing the Lycan's abilities in the new modern era.  India Eisley also gives a good performance as ""Eve"", the love child of Michael and Selene.  This movie has a LOT of action in it, more than the previous films in my opinion.  I like the first film in the Underworld films the best, no question, but this film is good and most people should enjoy it, especially any fan of the series.  I truly hope they continue making the Underworld movies.  I think, overall, the producers, film makers, directors, actors, and everyone involved with making the Underworld series has done a great job keeping them blended together, even with different variations of the four films that have been made.  There is so many different ways that this series could go and different directions and stories that it could take.  PLEASE make more of these films.  The four films already made did very well in the box office and even better with their DVD sales around the world.  It is a good series and it's something that the fans definitely want continued for at LEAST a few more films.  I'm not sure I would do a television series and that seems to be the demise of any film series.

4955002,3,B0064YOWCI,"Though the first two installments were short on story line and heavy on action, the thrd movie was even more so. There is really no further character development for Selene and the whole movie followed the formula: Action >> Segway >> Action >> Segway >> Action >> Inadequate Conclusion...

4955003,2,B0064YOWCI,"Well if you like Alice from (Resident Evil and Ultraviolet ) you will be happy with this movie. I like Milla jovovich's characters for what they started off as. But for Selene and the Underworld trilogy to have such a deep meaning and plot development? This 4 installment comes off as somewhat of a shocker to me. The visuals were still decent but the execution was lousy and rushed. The story was abysmal and the acting was just ok not serious.

Everything was just so fast that is just seemed rushed and not very well planned. The lycans looked horribly and I mean horribly designed and CGI'ed. I am really curious as to why this one had a higher budget than the previous three. The 3rd installment ""Rise of the Lycans"" was a revelation to this . I guess if you are one of those people that had a hard time following a deep story you'll love this. But if not then you will probably be horribly disappointed. There was very little character development here so I don't think you will care about anyone. She was good in it for what she had to work with and play with.

The only positives i can say about this over the 1st two installments. Is that she was finally a real vampire and a merciless killer. And the gore aspect was fantastic which wasn't in the previous two films. To see Selene kill humans with lack of empathy and suck there blood was just sexy. Other than that this movie doesn't offer anything above the 1st two. And to say that it hasn't progressed Technology over the 1st is pretty bad. I think ""Evolution"" and ""Rise"" looked way better than this one and that's putting it nicely. I really hope Patrick and Danny Mcbride jumps on board next time to save the franchise. I think if this continues this will be no more than a straight to video affair.",1335052800,3,1765,4.394495412844036

4955005,4,B0064YOWCI,"I saw the 2D version of Underworld Awakening in the theater, and I was totally entertained the whole time. Unfortunately, that whole time amounts to just 88 minutes, kind of short for a feature film, IMHO. Still, I'll be buying this when it comes out. Shakespeare, it is not. Underworld Awakening falls into the catagory of movies that are just plain escapist fun. If you want deep meanings and layered characters, you will need to look elsewhere. Plot is minimal, but action is nonstop.

  On another note, I have been all over Amazon here and the internet trying to find information on any extras in this blu ray dvd edition. I finally found the following, which I got from a site called Blu-Ray.com. I include it for everyone's information, though I have no confirmation the information is accurate on all points. With a run time of only 88 minutes for the film, Sony certainly has plenty of room on a blu ray disk for all of the following:

Sony is offering the feature in two Blu-ray versions - a Blu-ray/UltraViolet Digital Copy combo pack and a Blu-ray 3D/UltraViolet Digital Copy combo pack.

4955017,3,B0064YOWCI,"There is really only one film franchise out there that continually has me salivating for more, and that's the gritty, paranormal reality of ""Underworld."" While shorter than the other installments in the series, ""Awakening"" is one of the finest installments yet.

Where once vampires and lycans lived in secret, the war between them has escalated and the truth is out. In a desperate attempt to maintain the upper hand, humans have enforced martial law and are hunting down both species, identifying it as a ""virus"" without a cure. Their assault on the two races that have lived among them unnoticed for centuries forces individuals on both sides into hiding, but before Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and her hybrid lover Michael (Scott Speedman) can escape, they are hunted down. Twelve years later, awakening from stasis in a laboratory, Selene is determined to find out what has happened to Michael -- and to discover the source of her hallucinations, which permit her to see through another creature's eyes. Her desperate escape introduces her to David (Theo James), a member of one of the few remaining Covens, and then to the little girl that both humans and lycans seem to want -- Eve (India Eisley).

After she is badly wounded during a lycan attack, David takes them both to the Coven -- much to the disapproval of his father (Charles Dance), little realizing the consequences this will have for them all. If you have any familiarity with the franchise, you will know what this series is all about: the battle between vampires and lycans (werewolves) as it evolves in a futuristic society. The most successful installments have revolved around Selene and although I was not keen on the idea of this film back when it was announced (to be honest, I was disappointed they didn't make another prequel showing the rise of Lucian), the end result is marvelous. Changing the backdrop and introducing Eve could have backfired but it doesn't; we accept that the world has altered and are still rooting for our leather-clad immortal heroine to save the day in whatever way she can. And in this one she does, with her usual flair and undoubted style. Everything we loved about the earlier films is present here, from the jaw-dropping action sequences to the twirl of her coat as she kicks some lycan butt.

Even though it is violent, there's a lot to like about this film series and this film in particular. It explores an alternate reality in which the heroine is unconventional, a vampire seeking to protect her own from a lycan clan that would gladly kill Eve to harvest her abilities. I'm also fond of its consistent use of talented British actors in the roles of vampire elders -- in the original and the prequel we had Bill Nighy, in the sequel we had Derek Jacobi, and now we have Charles Dance. Throw in an incredible remix of an Amy Lee Evanescence track over the ending credits and you have a movie series that may not strive to be intelligent, but it is always entertaining. But putting all that aside, its immense success comes down to one rather trivial truth: it's just plain cool.",1332374400,29,3088,4.7790262172284645

First of all, all DVDs and Blu-Rays are ""digital,"" so the name is stupid.  What I think they mean is portable version, but charging for it is a ripoff.  Come on, we've paid for the content, not the format, and should not have to pay extra for a portable version.

The daughter was amazing and brought the maternal side of Selene out and the introduction of the new coven, the son especially, added so much.  The police officer was also a good supporting actor.

4955027,3,B0064YOWCI,"In ""Underworld: Awakening,"" Kate Beckinsale is back as Selene, the ""Death Dealer"" in tight, black costume. While the fourth entry of the ""underworld"" franchise is enjoyable enough with decent, if not outstanding, action set-pieces, the film suffers from its underdeveloped storyline. Action scenes are fun to watch (and there are many of them), but the film's pace seems more like rushed than fast-paced, not allowing us to connect to anyone in the film, until the final thirty minutes, in which the story finally decides on where to go.

""Underworld: Awakening"" opens with a quick recap of the previous films, followed by an action sequence showing what has happened to Selene and Michael since the last chapter. Now humans know the existence of Vampires and Lycans, and Selene and Michael are captured and imprisoned in a laboratory of a certain institute. Twelve years later, Selene wakes up again and runs away with a young vampire David (Theo James) and a little girl Eve or ""Subject 2"" (India Eisley), but they are relentlessly hunted by the werewolves.

Only Kate Beckinsale returns to the series. Her portrayal of Selene is as impressive as ever, but other actors are underused, especially two veterans Stephen Rea playing Dr. Jacob Lane, and Charles Dance as the elder of the surviving vampire clan.

As Len Wiseman, director of the first two ""Underworld"" films, had been attached to another project ""Total Recall,"" Swedish director team Mns Mrlind and Bjrn Stein was called in. I was not much impressed with their last effort ""Shelter,"" a thriller starring Julianne Moore, but at least they got action scenes right in ""Underworld: Awakening.""

4955030,5,B0064YOWCI,"Ok it could have been greater but I won't take away a star for a what if since I enjoyed the movie as a whole.

Pros: 1. Selena was herself, she picked off the people in the lab building where she had been cryo frozen for 12 years and Im glad that time didn't mellow he almost ballet like dispatch of her enemies.

2. Her daughter was delightful mix of her and Michael. The actress playing her was totally believable and indeed it takes a lot for a girl playing a 12 year old to his and snarl and be monstrous without looking stupid. She really was brilliant here beside adorabel.

3. The revelation of who set off the chain of events of human/vampire/lyca fight for survival was a shocker.  It seems that the Lycans have been busy.

Cons: 1. Time wasted on flashbacks not even done in sequential order. A wast of film time I thought. Who could forget the other movies to that extent.

2. We really don't know what suddenly tipped off the humans as two the two different species living right under there noses, thought I suspect the Lycans needed panic in the streets to accomplish their goal of a super, hugh, silver resistant werewolf. Still though because the movie started with the human preventive measures already rolling on the TV screens it is a bit confusing. But then the Lycan scientists security precation may well have failed without outside interference with them being put down.

3. The Lycans themselves were an odd bunch. They seemed more docile though no less deadly. They seemed to lack the grace they showed previously as they bounded after their prey and after catching, they were totaly absent that sink your fangs in and shake your head violently till you get a slice, they seemed less hungry then previous Lyacan generation's. Simply put, they were pretty clumsy and poorly tendered.

4. How did the Vampires with their keen sense of smell and hearing not take note that something was going on in that big lab building which woul have stunk of lycans to all hell.

5. What happened to the silver nitrate, the liquid silver bullets like the one that Craven used to finish of Lucian you would have thought they would be load with those. Thats a plothole and were were the Lycans Ultraviolet bullets? Both successful inventions seemed to go unused and the Lycans seem to die more by hide ventilation by regular machine gun bullets then silver.

6. And where did Michael go? Didnt he sense his daughter? Male Parents are just as dangerous when it comes to their young as the female. Will another movie tie all these loose end together? Will Vampire and Lycan finally learn to live and let live?

Basically what this movie needed was a moment called ""The Prestige"" as described in the Chris Bale, Michael Caine film. That one fantastic moment in the film that gets you jumping out of your chair and yahoooing that scene as the main one that made it all worthwhile.

But if you like Underworld Series you will like this movie plot points and all, Kate is as beautifull as ever and the blood keeps flowing.

In the end, on the roof where Michael was just seconds ago on camera Selena give a kind of we will rebuild and go on, almost Scarlet O Hara like. ""As God is my witness there will covens in abundance again.""

I guess its now up to Kate Beckinsdale and Len Weisman to see if they can bring this fantastic story stretching out over centuries to a respectable close?  I guess the best time to find out is to start googling in about a years time.",1330128000,3,3466,4.514376996805112

4955034,5,B0064YOWCI,"To the point: This action/horror hybrid was filmed using Red Epic 3D cameras on the set for most of the film, and the result? Good 3D in Underworld Awakening. When the movie starts, it's in 2D highlighting the previous films, but then it switches to 3D and wow. For 3D, I consider it great when the foreground, mid ground and background pop very clearly from one another in depth so there's no mistake it's 3D. This is clearly the case with Underworld Awakening during many scenes, but sometimes, the 3D pales and looks a bit flat during non action moments. The 3D is comparable to Resident Evil Afterlife 3D, which used the Fusion Cameras as Avatar 1 did.

Underworld Awakening 3D: Top notch 3D that has excellent depth and pop, as well as some 'pop out' moments with Selene's famous throwing stars and the Lycans attacking the screen. Very slick and stylish action throughout and Kate Beckinsale is fun to watch. The main storyline takes place 12 years after the 2nd film, Underworld Evolution.

There was a ""cleansing"" where the government killed all the Vampires and Lycans.  Of course, they never did get them all.  Now it appears that the Lycans have been holding up somewhere and reproducing (yuk--there's a mental picture that will burn your eyes right out of their sockets).  This time, a 12-year old girl shows up on the scene, and Selene just cannot let her get thrown to the wolves, so to speak.  Everybody wants the little girl, but don't let anybody fool you.  This is no ""let's play doll house"" kid!

Kate Beckinsale does a wonderful job and is in her prime fighting the remaining Lycans.  There is lots of action, chasing, blood and guts, heads lopping off, etc.  Selene is tough and MEAN!

4955040,4,B0064YOWCI,"It's rare that we endorse the systematic eradication of a species, let alone two of them. But when they're as threatening to man as vampires and werewolves are, I won't lose any sleep over it. Except that the vampires have a champion, however reluctant, and as played by Kate Beckinsale, Selene - with her slinky black leathers and take-no-prisoner attitude - swings the balance the other way yet again. So, here I am rooting for the bloodsucker and resenting humanity. Damn you, Kate Beckinsale.

I'm guessing YouTube, but however way it went down, the human world now knows of the existence of vampires and Lycans - and that means bad cess to vampires and Lycans. Humanity reacts predictably: it sets out to reclaim its seat at the top of the foodchain. UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING opens with a voiceover narration from Selene which recaps the first two films and then catches us up to current events, namely the Cleansing. The Cleansing proved to be dangerous - you could even say ""terminal"" - years for vampires and Lycans. It got so bad that Selene and Michael, her hybrid lover, opted to get out of town. Except that Selene was captured enroute to her rendezvous with Michael and taken to a high security research facility and cryogenically frozen, ostensibly so that scientists can conduct tests on her to find a ""cure."" Cue the ominous soundtrack.

Twelve years would elapse before Selene (or ""Subject One"") escapes her icy coffin and the clutches of Stephen Rea's creepy scientist. She emerges to a world which now believes that the vampire covens and Lycan packs have become near extinct. Selene's frantic search for Michael is derailed when she stumbles across a young hybrid vampire-Lycan girl (India Eisley) with whom she shares a psychic link. At least the film doesn't try to get coy regarding their relationship.

The remaining Lycans desperately want their claws on this girl (for a spot of DNA harvesting), and so Selene finds herself in familiar territory, reassuming her Death Dealer persona and kicking werewolves harshly to the curb. There's more to the plot than that, but that is the gist of the narrative. Except for one human police detective ally (Michael Ealy), the humans' involvement gradually diminishes in the story.

You can dismiss this franchise. You can make with the snarky and call it a B-movie and low brow and common denominator and cheesy and such, and my rebuttal goes like this: alabaster British beauty Kate Beckinsale furiously whuppin' butt in skin-tight black leather. Swedish directing duo Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein were charged with bringing UNDERWORLD back to the big screen, but they couldn't have done shizzy had Beckinsale not come back for another tour of duty. Beckinsale's cool swagger and deadpan determination are what I signed on for (sorry, Rhona Mitra). No, the dialogue isn't at an Oscar Wilde level and the acting is minimal and that's certainly not Scott Speedman briefly playing ""Michael"" (which may or may not be a good thing). But, again, I retort with Kate Beckinsale. She's like a classier Alice from RESIDENT EVIL (yes, because she has a cool British accent). Selene in the UNDERWORLD films is just one of my many guilty pleasures.

I've always felt that for being a vampire, Selene was lacking in certain ""vampiry"" traits and, in fact, she seemed to rely overmuch on firearms. So I'm glad we get to see a scene in which Selene finally gets to bloodily gnaw at a throat. I'm fascinated by her place in the vampire hierarchy. By many accounts, she's regarded as a traitor to her species. She's killed two Elder vampires. She fell in love with a werewolf hybrid. She happens to be immune to sunlight. One can see where the other nosferatu may eye her with suspicion. Selene follows her own moral code which doesn't necessarily coincide with the traditional edicts of the reigning vampire societies.

UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING unloads scenes of blistering action and more action. It also tries to give you 3-D, but don't hold that against it. I just saw HAYWIRE and made mention of how sturdy I thought Gina Carano was. But Selene takes even greater punishment. The special effects are top notch. I really like the big bad wolfman, and how he was depicted and then eventually defeated. India Eisley, the hybrid teen, merits two sequences in which she flexes her badassery. Werewolf skulls will get split in half. Other body parts will be cloven in two or eviscerated or just lopped off. Fun. And somewhere along the way Selene will demonstrate a pretty rough way to resuscitate a dead vampire. The way the film ends leaves a possibility for another sequel. Odds are, Stephen Rea won't be signing up for it.",1327449600,,4666,4.877679697351828
4955041,4,B0064YOWCI,"I love this series. Every movie has been good. But the 3rd installment wasn't nearly as solid as the first 2.

4955042,4,B0064YOWCI,"The Purge has begun.

Underworld has approached Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) in a violent way from the beginning. That's what I enjoy most about the series. Vampires and Lycans ARE violent. They are not nice, glittery, controllable things. After the events of the second film we find out that the humans have found out about these species and are doing what they can to 'cleanse' the world of them. This of course has brought about a war of sorts between the three different races.

Where we pick up is with Selene on her way to meet up with Michael to escape to a safer place, all the while she's showing she is still in top killing form, pulling off some beautiful moves. Things don't go as planned and she ends up waking up twelve years later in a cryogenic state. This is where the movie really starts.

Kate Beckinsale returns to the Underworld universe after a one movie hiatus, instantly reminding us why she was so good in the first two films. Her moves are sharp and fast and she has that cold stare that can send chills. Selene is a Death Dealer, the last of her kind. In a world where Vampires are quick to run and hide, she still stands up and fights. In Awakening, she's not just killing to kill, she's killing to protect. This equation brings in a new dynamic that adds more ferver.

For everything great that Awakening does, there were a few missteps. The CGI in more than a few scenes looks terrible, and the pacing at the beginning of the movie was far too brisk. Even I, someone who has seen the other films many times, was left wondering...'huh?' Once it settles down and decides what direction its gonna go in, the movie does a fine job of balancing pacing, action, and story. Awakening probably won't introduce new people to the series, but for those of us that enjoy the other films, it does a great job of building upon the story, adding a new dynamic and leaving more than a couple doors open for future installments.",1327190400,3,1945,4.4858757062146895

4955044,5,B0064YOWCI,"Thank God!  Beckinsale returns.  I had no difficulty watching Rhona Mitra, but Rise of the Lycans just hurt me.  I hate seeing non-returning actors replaced.  Yes, I know her character (Selene) wasn't even in the prequel, but I still thought the amputation of Beckensale would leave the franchise forever bitter and crippled from making new sequels.  And while filled with action, I struggled with the drop in CGI quality, especially for backgrounds.  But have no fear.  The budget is back, and it brought Beckensale with it.  The franchise is redeemed and primed for more sequels.

 After a quick recap of the first two movies' events, we are introduced to a near-future in which the vampires and lycans (werewolves) have been discovered by humans.  It is acknowledged in the movie that `now these nonhumans are more than myth' and, not surprisingly given human nature, the humans militarized a ""cleansing"" to eradicate the vampires and lycans.  In this middle of all this Selene (Beckinsale) is captured and cryogenically frozen.  This is where the background ends and this story begins.

 Selene is freed from her cryo-chamber after being helped by some unseen (presumably) nonhuman and escapes an extremely well-guarded research facility.  Conveniently, the her scientist-captors left all of her tight, shiny leather outfit in some chemical cabinets, so she was quick to find her normal form.  During her escape she encounters some thought-to-be-eradicated lycans and a little vamp-lycan hybrid adolescent--she's pretty tough and gets some cool action scenes.  This little girl seems to be the center of story because the lycans REALLY want her.

 The plot is quite weak; borderline pointless.  But that didn't bother me a bit.  Like the first two installments of the franchise, this flick cluster-bombs viewers with exciting action sequences, flesh-shredding assaults, people being slam-launched across the room into walls, a healthy dose of blood splattering, and some occasional creative acrobatics.  Oh, and watch out for the really, really, big bad wolf.  The lycans genetically engineered this mega-lycan that is around 12-15 feet tall and probably weighs a couple tons.  The fight scenes between MegaLycan and Selene are very exciting, brutal, bashy, gritty... The other action scenes are fun, too.  Including a lycan-on-foot car chase, some mass melees, and some spiffy close-quarters combat.  If you came with no care for plot and every care for mindless action, then this flick is most certainly for you.

 In the end I was thrilled with the production value, action-filming and set design--all of which were less impressive in Rise of the Lycans.  The effects budget seemed to be lower than it was for Underworld: Evolution (the best effects of the franchise in my opinion), but to no fault.  This is one of those ""movies for guys who like movies"" action flicks and one really wouldn't suffer for not seeing the prequels.  But you should definitely watch them anyway!",1327104000,137,2982,5.199579831932773
4955045,5,B0064YOWCI,"""Awakening"" picks up where ""Evolution"" left off. Alexander Corvinus is dead, and now no one is cleaning up after his offspring. Humans discover the existence of the immortals, and react in a predictably human fashion: they try to wipe them out.

The film did a great job carrying on the story. Everything still makes sense, and none of the ""rules"" of the world are changed. Vampires still hate lycans, lycans still hate vampires. We just have a new dimension added -- humans hate vampires and lycans. The ""mood"" of the earlier films hasn't changed much here either...this is very much a dark, somber atmosphere. Michael is notably absent, but (don't worry!) it's handled well. The new characters fit nicely into the Underworld world, and no one seems out of place. The story itself was good, and they were careful to make sure that it continued everything we've seen in the first movies.

The acting was all great, and Kate Beckinsdale did a(nother) superb job...she has a great way of conveying emotion with very understated expressions and tones.

Another aspect that I liked about this film...up until this point, with two exceptions (Sonya and Celine), we've seen pretty much nothing but evil vampires; werewolves, by contrast, have grown vengeful, but are justified in their quest for vengeance. Lycans are ""regular people"" who have been changed, hunted and abused, but vampires are the abusers and hunters. There is nothing very likeable the vampires, with the exception of Sonya and Celine -- at best they have been happy to profit off other's misery, and, at worst, they contribute to it. Here we see more ""human"" vampires...not perfect, but not horribly evil either.

The beyond gorgeous Kate Beckinsale stills rocks the role of Selene. I really hope she comes back for a fifth installment.

The IMAX 3-D was not really worth the upgrade, but I had no choice at my theater. The sound was great, even making the seats shake, but at least the 3-D wasn't a blurry mess that took away from the movie.

Now my 5 star rating is in context with the Underworld series, not comparable say to my 5 star review of The Dark Knight. If you like the series I don't see any reason you wouldn't love this one.",1327104000,3,887,4.211764705882353

*Mini-Spoilers Alert*
Humans have learned of the existence of vamps and lycans, and reacted predictably badly to the news.  Selene gets captured while she and Michael trying to escape the carnage and she awakens twelve years later in a specimen lab at a company called AntiGen and escapes, vaguely aware that someone called Specimen 2 (India Eisley) aided her.  Contacted by David (Theo James), a member of a ragtag coven of surviving vamps, she discovers the truth of her situation: Specimen 2 is her biological daughter and they were being experimented upon for reasons both obvious and not so much. Dr. Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea), head of AntiGen, who claims to be working on a vaccine for the lycan/vampire strains, has a different endgame in mind.  Thwarted by AntiGen's stonewalling after Selene's escape, Detective Sebastian (Michael Ealy) is also hot on her trail, having his own reasons for tracking her down.
*End Spoilers*

Much like Resident Evil, this is a franchise that's starting to run on fumes and needs a new jolt.  U:A does so, but like other flicks in the genre, the fault lies more in the execution.  Humans learning about lycans and vamps is just what was needed here, but letting us see the downfall of the two groups as it happened would've made a better story than catching up after the fact.

Cinematography and art design remain the same: oversaturated blue palettes for everything, all the time.  Plus lots of rain-washed city streets in the night, sterile lab rooms, dank & cold caverns and tunnels- all lovingly rendered in a gothic shade of blue.  Even the sunshine.

Blood and gore are ok, but inconsistent.  Half the time everyone, including the central cast, looked like they took shooting lessons at Mook Central:  too many times a person is standing stock still yet the bullet holes keep decorating the walls and surroundings (think Pulp Fiction when the guy tried to shoot Jules and Vincent).  But it's got eviscerations, lacerations and gougings galore- it'll sate your blood lust, don't you worry.

Dialogue gets utterly cheesy at times but it was never supposed to be Shakespeare, was it?  I'm just finding it hard to believe that J. Michael Straczynski had a hand in the script.  The cast is interesting for it's selection, but let's face it- all they're being called upon to do is snarl, growl, sneer, angst, and in some cases, die in a CGI rendering.  Nice work if you can get it.  :)  Notably absent is Scott Speedman, who has declined to reprise his role in the series (as yet), but his character gets a cameo to support the story.

Only real question I have is the soundtrack.  None of the songs even appear until after the credits start rolling, so what's the point of having Lacuna Coil & Evanscence around if you don't use them?

U:A is the kick start the series needed.  It's a popcorn flick with enough chops to hold down a spot in both the urban fantasy genre and the franchise itself.  Now all it needs is to lose the overpriced 3D effects and use the extra time to flesh out the story some more and everything'll be fine.",1327017600,4,3348,4.769097222222222
