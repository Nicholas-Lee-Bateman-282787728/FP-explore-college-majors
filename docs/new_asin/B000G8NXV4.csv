2602743,5,B000G8NXV4,"I have truely enjoyed going back and watching this series on DVD. The only bad thing about the series itself was that it was too short lived. It was a family friendly version of Blue Thunder and the interaction between the stars was wonderful. Dick Butkus and Bubba Smith are a hoot to watch.

As far as the quality of the disks, I have no complaints. The picture and sound was wonderful and they are a pleasure to watch. However, if you have a widescreen tv you will have the annoying black bars on the sides unless you expand the picture since this is in 4:3 aspect. The only bad thing I have to say about the set is that there are no extras, which would have been nice. Some behind the scenes on the helicopter or even some series interviews would have been nice.",1198368000,3,766,4.2827586206896555
2602744,5,B000G8NXV4,"A very enjoyable series with a memorable cast and catchy theme tune. The Sony Prints are outstanding quality and do justice to this show.
In my opinion it could have lasted at least three seasons. All of the elements were there for success.",1190592000,4,240,4.604651162790698
2602745,5,B000G8NXV4,"It's nice to see Blue Thunder, the TV series, released on DVD, in spite of the fact it lasted only one season. It was one of the great action-packed shows to come out of the 1980s. You had James Farentino who piloted Blue Thunder. A very young Dana Carvey, who was the co-pilot, who was always referred to as ""JAFO"" (Just Another Frustrated Observator.) You also has Dick Butkus & Bubba Smith, two ex-football players, who appeared in the series as well. I like other reviewers here would love to have Street Hawk, another short lived series, come out on DVD as well.",1159056000,10,567,4.514563106796117
2602746,3,B000G8NXV4,"At last on Dvd. I remembered this show from my early days. I loved as A Team and Knight Rider were broadcasted these days. Only 11 eps were made after its cancellation due to similar series Airwolf in the rival CBS.Based on the 1983 movie of the same title it features an advanced chopper capable of doing 360 loops,whisper silent mode record audio and video,turbo thurst and fires 6,000 rounds per minute in her gatling cannon. Of course is armor plated and bullets ricochets when fired to it.

The Dvd is Ok with good audio and video quality however no special features are included nor cast or series info.

Hope Street Hawk that also was premature cancelled arrives soon on Dvd.",1158451200,9,682,4.628099173553719
2602747,5,B000G8NXV4,"As a child I loved this show and I always kept a warm place for it in my heart.  This show is action packed, each show with shootouts and explosions, not to mention the wonderful aerobatics.  The remastering in superb, as it vividly brings out the blue tint in Dana Carvey's eyes and even shows the forehead lines on most of the actors.  Colors are well-defined and there is a strong contrast and warm lights.  However, when movie stock footage is used, it looks grainy compared to the series footage.  Numerous footage is reused during this series, but it's expected with the budget for aviation shots.  Explosion from time to time are corny cut outs, or just plain cheap, but the remastering makes some footage quite vivid.  Writing could be better, but there is a generous amount of action that exceeds Airworf.  If you're not a fan then rent it, but this is a must own for fans of this series.",1156896000,15,897,4.527950310559007
2602748,5,B000G8NXV4,"Based on the 1983 movie, ABC's ""Blue Thunder"" focused on the Blue Thunder Unit, a Los Angeles police unit which operated a high-tech helicopter (actually a modified French-made Arospatiale Gazelle)  with ground support. A few of its features included an electric cannon, night sensors, turbo-speed and a ""whisper mode"" that allowed it to run silently.

The series starred James Farentino (Police Story) as pilot Frank Chaney; Dana Carvey (Saturday Night Live) as his observer Clinton ""JAFO"" Wonderlove; Sandy McPeak as Cpt. Ed Braddock, the unit commander; Ann Cooper as Officer J.J. Douglas; and ex-NFL jocks Dick Butkus (Any Given Sunday) & Bubba Smith (Police Academy) as Officers Richard ""Ski"" Butowski & Lyman ""Bubba"" Kelsey, the ground support team.

ABC first launched Blue Thunder for a midseason run on January 6, 1984. Unfortunately, CBS's slightly more sophisticated helicopter drama ""Airwolf"" (which debuted 2 weeks later) from creator Donald P. Bellisario (Quantum Leap, JAG) countermanded Blue Thunder's intended run, thereby facilitating its cancellation after just 11 episodes.

While Airwolf was the more successful series with its grim and moody tone, Blue Thunder was just as watchable for its A-Team, Hunter-like tone: standard 80s blend of action and tongue-in-cheek humor. Regardless, the real star [in both shows] was, of course, the helicopter. Not to mention the catchy opening theme music. Again, in both shows.

Blue Thunder - The Complete Series is a 3-disc (529 min.) set featuring all 11 episodes from the 1983-1984 season. Special Features include: Digitally Remastered English Audio and High Definition Full Frame (1.33:1) Video, Bonus Previews, Closed Captioning.

2602757,4,B000G8NXV4,"Cool show that brings me back to my childhood.

As a helicopter (rotorcraft) pilot now, I notice little nuances that are Hollywoodish and others that are real world conditions/situations.
Sadly, the ""Complete Series"" is only eleven episodes as it was put up against ""Dallas"" in its time slot and the other Helicopter show ""Airwolf"" was airing at the same time.

Side note for any interested:
There were two helicopters manufactured for this series. both were disassembled and sold for scrap after production. As for Airwolf, all the extra stuff was removed post production bringing it back to a basic Bell 222 helicopter. It was then sold to a group in German who outfitted it for emergency response purposes. Sadly, it crashed in the early nineties (I believe '91) killing the three people aboard. I.E. - None of the helicopters from the 2 helicopter shows remain in existence.",1475020800,3,878,4.965986394557823

2602762,1,B000G8NXV4,I grew up and love the politically charged theatrical motion picture of the same name and I also have a soft spot for cheesy 80s television so the Blue Thunder television series was a shoe in to own in my DVD collection. However Sony's quality control program ruined that for me. I ordered the series and the first time Disc 1 and 2 showed up juggled loose in the case and the resulting damage was accompanied by what looked like glue on the discs. Thinking the glue was a onetime problem I had amazon send me a replacement and surprise surprise Disc 1 and 2 also had the same glue spattering on the discs that rendered them unplayable in my DVD/Blu-ray/computer. This is no doubt due to a problem in the factory resulting in glue getting on the discs during the manufacturing process but it seems to be widespread in the batch that amazon has in stock. I would love to own the series eventually but I will not take a chance again so buy with caution - you have been warned!,1452988800,,974,4.357142857142857

2602765,3,B000G8NXV4,"THE STORY: When bad guys in California can't be taken down by more traditional methods, Los Angeles PD's Astro Division sends in BLUE THUNDER, an advanced prototype para-military helicopter gunship on loan from our military (and overseen by the shadowy government agency known only as APEX). Aloof, my-way-or-the-highway hotshot Frank Chaney pilots the big blue whirlybird, with his trusty observer & sidekick Clinton Wonderlove, aka JAFO (Just Another ""Frustrated"" Observer) along for the ride. Issuing their orders (and reining them in whenever necessary) is their always hot-under-the-collar captain, the ever-aggravated Ed Braddock. The tech-heavy chopper receives ground & logistics support (and hardy-har-har comedy hi-jinks) from Rolling Thunder and its two-man team of Ski & Bubba.

THOUGHTS: The TV show version of BLUE THUNDER unwisely jettisons the strong themes from the movie it was based on in favor of harmless, A-Team style bloodless shoot 'em ups.  Seeing as how Stephan J. Cannell alumni Roy Huggins was a producer on this series that comes as no big surprise. Biggest weakness with this show are truly awful scripts, ripe with atrocious dialog and some of the most by-the-numbers contrived 'action TV show' scenarios ever seen. The acting ranges from competent to retched. James Farentino constantly hollers at his captain and other high-level government officials, yet instead of getting booted off the force like he would in the real world,  Capt. Ed ""I hate him but he's always right"" Braddock (Sandy McPeak) just tolerates Chaney's frothing outbursts and lets him have his way.  Farentino is a weak lead, IMHO.  He has little range and just either seems to be full-blown yelling to state his case or is a smug, unfunny wisearse. Sandy McPeak is okay as the gruff Astro Division commander but he's no where near the actor that the film version of Braddock is, the awesome Warren Oates. Former NFL gridiron giants Dick Butkus & Bubba Smith had only done comedic beer commercials prior to this so I have to let their ""acting"" stand as-is.  (They do have an undeniable camaraderie but their inclusion on the BT team feels forced, and the running joke about who is the meaner of the two got tired really fast.)  Dana Carvey, a few years before finding stardom on SNL, is fun as Wonderlove/JAFO, but the other cast members either ignore him or just seem to be unsure how to react to his comedy bits.  They simply may not have known how to handle his constant wise-cracking, who knows?

All scenes with the boxy star helicopter are shot in the remote mountains.  Any city-based action of the chopper and its aerial adversaries simply utilizes footage and outtakes from the movie. The land-based rig that Butkus & Smith ride around in, ""Rolling Thunder,"" is a lightly modified GMC utility van/laundry truck, with a silly back-up rig hidden inside, (""Junior""), a top-chopped GMC pick-up with a terrible rattlecan bomb camo paint job on it.  (There's no possible way two huge guys like Butkus and Smith could have ever squeezed into the little truck while it's in the back of Rolling Thunder when we see them launch out the back of the parent truck in order to engage the bad guy of the week in routine Baja-style desert chase scenes & M60 gunfire antics ...but hey! lets not think about that, shall we?)

ABC's BLUE THUNDER only started to really find its footing and show a glimmer of potential in the last two episodes, but by then its fate had been sealed by a combination of terrible prime-time scheduling and formidable opposition from the sleeker, faster, better-equipped and more adult-themed drama of AIRWOLF, and alas the black & blue THUNDER sputtered away into the sunset after a mere 11 episodes. Heck, Dana Carvey didn't even bother to make an appearance in the last episode, arguably one of the best the show had to offer.  If the producers had been given a chance to replace/refine their roster of regular writers and had another season's worth of episodes with which to tweak the show a bit, BLUE THUNDER could have been one of the action greats of the early 80's instead of a barely remembered also-ran.

THE DVD SET: 3-disc box set contains all 11 episodes.  Audio/video are solid & strong. Sadly, the set contains zero extras. BOTTOM LINE: If you're a fan of the super-vehicle shows from the 1980's then BLUE THUNDER belongs in your collection, right beside your treasured copies of KNIGHT RIDER, AIRWOLF and STREET HAWK. If you're merely curious then I suggest renting or downloading an episode or two first before buying. If you only know BLUE THUNDER from the movie, then lower your expectations several notches and you might enjoy it. It was neat to finally see the series in its brief entirety but for a high-tech chopper show I much prefer the slicker, sexier firepower of AIRWOLF. However, as with all things, YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary).  3 STARS",1443916800,7,4888,4.921020656136087
2602766,5,B000G8NXV4,"I was a big fan of the movie Blue Thunder. When I found out that a television show was being made, I was excited. Of course, I was only a kid when it aired and it only had 11 episodes. I thought there were more but I did enjoy every single one.

2602772,5,B000G8NXV4,"Many people believe the ABC tv series, ""Blue Thunder"" was mainly cancelled because of CBS' ""Airwolf"".  Airwolf had NOTHING to do with Blue Thunder being cancelled!  ABC debuted Blue Thunder on Friday nights directly against CBS' top rated show, ""Dallas"".  Dallas was at it's peak during this time and buried anything ABC or NBC put up against it.  Unfortunately, whoever was in charge at ABC didn't bother placing Blue Thunder on another night, so it never really stood a chance.  Although I was a fan of Dallas, I would videotape Blue Thunder so I could enjoy both.  I am glad someone was smart enough to bring Blue Thunder to DVD, even though it only lasted 11 episodes.  I highly recommend this show to anyone considering buying it.  You can see for yourself what a good show it was and wonder like I do what might have been had ABC been smart enough to even give an attempt of saving it.",1330128000,9,891,4.525
2602773,5,B000G8NXV4,"I loved this show, loved airwolf as well but this was a different version of the same idea dealing with more every day stuff.

2602774,5,B000G8NXV4,"I am the husband of the person who ordered this,and it was a Christmas gift for me. I am very pleased with the quality of the product and had wanted it for some time. I loved the TV Show in the 80's and a few years ago I had ordered DVD's of it from a party on E-Bay and they were very poor quality and only got to the middle of one episode and would freeze up-I have not made an E-bay purchase since, so it was nice to have the original authorized version that is of excellent quality. Though I have only watched a few episodes yet-as I receieved several DVD sets of various shows at Christmas,it brings back memories of watching them in my youth and all the arguments I used to have with friends over which TV Show Helicopter was better-Airwolf (which I also own Season 1 of) or Blue Thunder. I highly recommend this to others!",1294963200,5,829,4.1875
2602775,3,B000G8NXV4,"I'm kind of amazed that they decided to go ahead and release this short-lived series of BLUE THUNDER on DVD, since it only lasted 11 episodes after it's debut on ABC in the Winter of 1984 since AIRWOLF's premiere on CBS in late January of 1984 led to BLUE THUNDER's cancellation by the Summer of 1984 since BLUE THUNDER took a nose-dive & started losing too many viewers through AIRWOLF all of the sudden since AIRWOLF K.O.'d BLUE THUNDER in the ratings, especially since AIRWOLF was obviously more upgraded and more sophisticated than BLUE THUNDER ever was along with the fact that AIRWOLF could do everything that BLUE THUNDER could do, plus more along with the fact that AIRWOLF was the hottest most sophisticated high-tech superchopper of all times just like KNIGHT RIDER was the hottest supercar of all times which also made AIRWOLF like the KNIGHT RIDER in helicopters, which was why AIRWOLF went for a 2nd Season in the Fall of 1984 and BLUE THUNDER didn't since the ratings on BLUE THUNDER toppled drastically once AIRWOLF made its debut on CBS practically taking Thunder out of the title of this show since AIRWOLF obviously stole BLUE THUNDERs thunder.

Therefore BLUE THUNDER turned out to be one of those movies that eventually became a TV series after being a big hit at the box office that tanked, just like 9 TO 5, FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF, etc;  all did since they all cancelled after running for less than a year, which is probably why people shouldn't mess with an original, despite the fact that BLUE THUNDER with Roy Scheider and Malcolm McDowell was a very good and popular movie back in the Summer of 1983 that sold millions of tickets, which is what inspired the producers to make BLUE THUNDER into a series in the first place, despite the fact that the series ended up biting the dust.

So now that BLUE THUNDER:The Series, AIRWOLF, and KNIGHT RIDER have all been released on DVD, I'm anxious to see if they ever get short-lived STREET HAWK released on DVD, especially by Universal.

By the way, I just got word that the Shout Factory will be releasing the short-lived series STREET HAWK with Rex Smith out on DVD on Tuesday July 13th, 2010 for all you high-tech show fans.",1247184000,,2227,4.659033078880407

I enjoyed watching the episodes again that I had watched years ago; and there are the ones that I had missed because I was too busy working at the time. I am disappointed with the patches of cloudiness on the surfaces of discs 1 and 2. The discs are viewable, but the clouding should not be there; and I am not sure of the long term durability of the discs. The center hub holding disc 1 is loose and the disc keeps falling off. I returned the whole set to Amazon for replacement. The new set has the same problems.

2602777,4,B000G8NXV4,"I remember watching this TV series when it first aired, thinking it really wasn't very good. Then ""Air Wolf"" came along to steal the thunder away, and before you could say ""whisper mode"", Blue Thunder had been cancelled.

Looking back, this series really wasn't a failure at all. Granted the first few episodes are very repetitive and poorly written, but the series soon hits its stride. When compared to other 80's tv series such as Knight Rider and the A-Team, Blue Thunder fits in nicely. If you're a fan of the feature film, or just looking for escapist entertainment, 80's style, I think you'll enjoy this series!

Only eleven episodes, so I wouldn't pay more than $20! Wait for a good deal!
