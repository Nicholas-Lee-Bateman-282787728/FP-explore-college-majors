8121580,5,B000FF3E5I,"I was so touched by this documentary of a period in Mozu's life in Japan on the beautiful sometimes harsh snowy mountain in the reserve, that I decided to name my next pet, male or female, Mozu in honor and memorium to this determined deformed mother of five.  She raised 2 glorius females that made it through adulthood raising young of their own but ever so close to mother's side until end.  I guess with progress, technology, and knowledge, us primates have lost the instinct to stick together as a family from birth to death.  how do we as a species get back to the basics and become the spirited, upright primates we once were?  I don't think it possible but watching this little peek into Mozu's world, one can only imagine how we must have behaved as a troop of homosapiens foraging and hunting for food and shelter.  It was a matter of life and death that we all stay together for protection and to support one another in rearing the young and taking care of the old.  This is a heart-wrencing story of a little lady with a lot of spirit and determination.  The only way she could make it was to stay close to the troop which no easy task.",1374105600,,1148,4.36150234741784
8121581,4,B000FF3E5I,"This is another great wildlife adventure from the Nature series. Mozu, a snow monkey, overcomes many obstacles in spite being of born with deformed limbs. He and the other monkeys must survive the cold weather in the mountains of Japan with the help of the hot springs. It's a remarkable story of resourceful animals living in a unique environment.

The DVD of this episode is quite expensive.  However, there are low cost VHS copies available from the other sellers listed here at Amazon.",1209859200,3,489,4.879518072289157
