8110273,5,B000EHSMC2,Who would have though that putting the Bible in English would be such a crime ? Great insight into something we just seem to think was always that way. Tells the tale of how the Bible became the KJV and the man why was called to do it.,1506643200,,235,3.9166666666666665
8110274,2,B000EHSMC2,"I history of how we got God's word translated into English is most important.
What this man had to endure,It's an interesting story, of courage, determination, and perseverance.",1400716800,,177,5.357142857142857
8110275,5,B000EHSMC2,"This should be mandatory in public schools, private schools, every workplace, and government offices too.  We all need to learn to respect the people who gave their lives to bring the Word of God to our english-speaking culture.  Self-sacrificing zeal drove William Tyndale to spare his living-life by diligent labors, and his life-unto-death by martyrdom, so that we might know by what sins we brought God's judgment upon ourselves and our nations; and more importantly so that we might know by what deliverance the Lord was willing to reconcile men and nations to himself: the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.  This is a documentary, but it is by no means dry or dull.  On the other hand, it is not artificially exciting or enthusiastic.  It simply sets before us the facts and realities that every good person must find intensely engaging, and life-directing.  May it be blessed to all who watch.",1399852800,,893,4.92
8110276,2,B000EHSMC2,"An OK DVD, but elementary for someone with a little knowledge of him.  Well put together historically. I would recommend this DVD for new Christians  I give it 4of 5 stars for new ones and a 2 for those with some knowledge of Tyndale.",1391644800,,234,4.295454545454546
8110277,5,B000EHSMC2,"The more I read and view material about Tyndale the more impressed I am. Tyndale, more than any other single person is responsible for what ultimately became the KJB. The Powers That Be? Give Us This Day? That's Tyndale. Dr. David Daniell is superb as always. (Be sure to look for his books on Tyndale and the English Bible.) He points out that Greek translates into English on a word for word basis better than from any other tongue. I especially liked his differentiating English from Latin translation. English - Rise from thy bed and walk. Latin - Levitate and perambulate about the room! Tyndale is the language of Shakespeare and the King James Bible, the sublime summit of literature in English. This video was absolutely riveting.",1376265600,2,738,4.818897637795276
8110278,5,B000EHSMC2,"This man was amazing in his character as well as in his faith, thanks to him we have a better understanding of God's word. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for putting it in english. He died because he believed in his work.",1376265600,,225,4.022222222222222
8110279,4,B000EHSMC2,"William Tyndale is one of my heroes and his portrait hangs over my desk. He is a man who lived his life in service to God and left a legacy which we simply cannot underestimate. Tyndale was, of course, the first man to make and print a translation of the Scriptures from the Greek into English. His translation formed much of the basis for the eventual King James translation and in that way is still in use today and is still precious to many believers. He gave his life for his work which eventually totalled all of the New Testament and the first two sections of the Old. He gave his life for the privilege of translating Scripture. And what I most admire about Tyndale--what I would most want to emulate--is his passion for the Scriptures. He trusted in the promises of Scripture, that it is living and active, and had great faith in what would happen when the Scriptures were released to to English people.

Man With A Mission is an interview with Tyndale scholar and biographer Dr. David Daniell who wrote William Tyndale: A Biography. This book is, by all accounts, the authoritative account of Tyndale's life. Daniell knows as much about his subject and this DVD is complementary to that book. He provides an overview of Tyndale's life and provides many fascinating and little-known details about the man. He takes us from the years of Tyndale's formal education to his martyrdom, focusing primarily, of course, on his work of translation which was so often done in secrecy and while hiding from the Catholic authorities.

This is a very interesting presentation and one that is well worth viewing. It clocks in at 42 minutes and, unfortunately, the disc does not include any bonus features.",1200960000,8,1699,4.736486486486487
