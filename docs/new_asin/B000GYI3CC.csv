2620745,4,B000GYI3CC,"Once again, BBC-TV has ditched a series idea and CBS has picked it up, via Jerry Bruckheimer.
It would appear that Bruckheimer - the genius behind ALL the CSI shows - has grabbed someone else's ""failed"" idea and run with it.
Eleventh Hour is now a ""Hit new series"" on CBS, Thursday nights behind CSI Las Vegas. It has the same main character - Dr. Ian Hood; the same major premise - government-contract scientist-troubleshooter, only this time, he's an American working for the FBI - and the same female tough chick backup, although I haven't caught her name.
I don't know the characters in this series, but if Bruckheimer has done his homework as well as he usually does, they are at least superficially well-thought-out, with plenty of room to be fleshed out by the actors themselves. Just look at what the various CSI, Cold Case, and Without a Trace actors have done with their parts, and you can see how much leeway Bruckheimer gives his actors to fill in the corners. And with Patrick Stewart as an example, the lead in the American version has BIG shoes to fill.",1225152000,,1068,4.626315789473685
2620746,1,B000GYI3CC,"A non-mutant or alien filled sci fi show with Patrick Stewart? Made by the BBC?! This should be great!! The only way they could screw this up would be to ham-handedly make political statements in EVERY episode...

And so they did. This show was bad in so many different ways. In order to build suspense, they use bad keyboard music and choppy, stilted camera angles. At least once per episode there is a speech about how science is the final arbiter of Truth and will save us all....even as the charecters fight against things like science-created viruses that threaten to kill an entire city.

The ubiquitous episode on how global warming is going to kill us all was particularly bad. In it, it shows 50-75% of the UK being covered by a 2 meter rise in ocean levels. This means that the bulk of Britain is a flat plain about 6 feet above sea level. Clearly, this is not the case.

In the US CBS is remaking the series and, from the clips I've seen, are doing the exact episodes as this version. Save your money, watch the propaganda for free.",1216339200,11,1043,4.450261780104712
2620747,3,B000GYI3CC,"First of all, I am a huge Patrick Stewart fan.  I can watch anything of his and be enthralled by his superior acting ability.  Now, let's get to the fine print:  buy or not buy?  If you are a sci-fi fan, especially of the world catastrophe science type, you will enjoy this.  The writing could be better, but Stewart holds it together.

  My biggest beef of 'Eleventh Hour' is that is only 4 episodes of approx 70 minutes each!  Within just a few short hours you've watched the whole thing.  I'm just not a fan of 4 episode Series'.  A consumer just doesn't get the bang for the buck.  If you can cabbage onto this for under $20, including shipping, you will probably just break even on satisfaction level.  I personally think NO show should be called a series if it involves only 2 DVDs and four hours of total running time.",1196294400,3,825,4.348684210526316
2620748,5,B000GYI3CC,"All four shows were very well done.  Though the last two differ in style than the first two, they are equally as watchable.  Nothing trite about these episodes.

2620749,5,B000GYI3CC,"This short series proves to be a fascinating experience. The quality surpases the current popluar US series CSI type thriller. The hero, Dr Ian Hood (Patrick Stewart), a special scientific adviser to the British Government, troubshoots evidence of pollution, cloning, pandemics desease and even a possible miracle 'water cure'.  A clever juxtapositioning of his Scottish 'minder' (special branch detective) Rachel Young (Ashley Jensen) creates the perfect 'odd couple' defending citizens against evil doers. The script is Sci-fi style - written by Stephen Gallagher (Doctor Who), and each episode provides a thriller, that intrigues and facinates and holds the viewer's attention to the last minute. Great viewing!",1179360000,12,714,5.735849056603773
2620750,2,B000GYI3CC,A disappointment.  Deffinitely not Patrick Stewart's better work.  Quite anti-God and anti-American.,1178928000,4,100,7.25

2620752,4,B000GYI3CC,"The question can be asked - what will Patrick Stewart do now that will equal the recognition he got as a Star Trek captain?  The answer:  this classically trained actor has a large scope of projects from which to choose.  This failed series didn't get a chance to succeed.  Past the first two episodes, the writers didn't even try to do their job.  I'll never know what happened, but it's a loss to those of us who want to see credible actors in a competent, entertaining series.  I am happy to have got the 4 episodes that exist and hope some entity will someday revive it, if Stewart will give it another try.",1168473600,3,611,4.3628318584070795
2620753,3,B000GYI3CC,"Patrick Stewart (Prof Ian Hood) serves as a Government Science Advisor whose job is to investigate anything unusual--not just crimes, but from the episodes, I'm gathering anything that could have an impact on public health and welfare.  From what I gather, the show was a mid-season replacement and was only four episodes into the run before cancellation.

As another reviewer said, 11th Hour is an interesting showcase for Stewart. Prof Hood investigates everything from illegal cloning to miracle cures in those four episodes.  I suspect if the network hadn't cut the run as quickly, the show might have stood a chance of succeeding.  While the fourth episode was not the most compelling, the cast did seem to catch their stride at that point.

Downside is the film is awfully dark and the quality is not what it should be.  Still the four episodes are worth watching and owning if you are a Stewart fan.",1165190400,9,906,4.85064935064935
2620754,3,B000GYI3CC,"No, not really but ""Eleventh Hour"" is what he worked on between shooting ""Mysterious Island"" and ""X-Men: The Last Stand"". The first two episodes deserve 4 stars while the last two 2 and 3 stars respectively. Overall this was a show with promise that was cut short because it didn't attract enough viewers in the U.K.

""Eleventh Hour"" created by writer Stephen Gallagher and produced for ITV combines elements of ""Doctor Who"" (Gallagher was a former write on ""Doctor Who"" during the ealry 80's), the old BBC show ""Doomwatch"" and ""The X-Files"" to create a compelling series that probably would have had more to offer if it had gone before four ninety minutes segments. While the show could be a tad derivative the strong performances by the cast and fine imaginative direction (particulary for the first two episodes)made the show watchable and worthwhile. The second pair of episodes ""Kryptos"" and ""Miracle"" had promise but had some major script problems that if solved would have made (the latter particularly)fascinating and fun TV.

Patrick Stewart plays Professor Ian Hood a controversial scientist sent in to investigate any weird crimes. He's protected by a bodyguard Rachel Young (Ashley Jensen). It seems that Hood's crusading approach to science has made him many enemies in different industries and, as a result, there are folks who'd love to take the good doctor out with a bullet vs. out for a cup of tea.

**Spoilers ahead**

The writing for the first eight episodes (they are two part episodes)varied from extremely good to spotty but on the whole the show exhibited a lot of promise. Interestingly writer Gallagher and the uncredited Simon Stephenson drop you right into the lap of our main characters without a lot of background or exposition. It makes the first episode challenging but fascinating as you try and figure out the characters as you also solve the mystery at the heart of the film. The first episode is a bit derivate borrowing from films like 2004's ""Godsend"" but on the whole Gallagher does a solid job of making the story interesting enough despite the fact that the premise itself isn't all that original.

In the first episode of the series ""Ressurection"" Hood and Young are called in when a fetal graveyard is discovered. What Hood discovers about their DNA and their link causes him to suspect that someone is trying to clone humans in the U.K. The duo must uncover who is behind this and why before there are any adult victims.

The second episode started off with a premise worthy of ""The X-Files"". While demolishing a old church and relocating bodies buried on the site one of the workers contracts a mysterious and deadly virus. Hood and Young must uncover what is at work and whether there's a chance it will spread to the community.

**End of spoilers**

The last two episodes had promise but the writing was a bit spotty. Of the last two ""Miracle"" was the most fascinating with a great premise but denouncement at the conclusion that undermined the entire episode.

The DVD comes with text interviews with Patrick Stewart and actress Ashley Jensen as well as a filmography for the cast. The show comes without subtitles however which would have been useful for some of the thicker accents for us U.S. viewers. The shows looks quite good in its DVD transfer and fans of Stewart or ""The X-Files"" might enjoy the show.

The show will be airing on BBC America starting the week of 12/3/06. Stewart is marvelous and the supporting cast quite good as well. I'd give the show 3 1/2 stars. If the show had continued I quite imagine like ""The X-Files"" and other shows of that type the writing would have improved over the course of the series as the characters and situations were developed.

This is entertaining enough for a rental if nothing else although Stewart is often better than the material he's working with.",1160784000,26,3853,4.822727272727272

2620779,5,B000GYI3CC,"This series far surpasses any CSI knockoffs that crop up on both sides of the pond. The elegant and always watchable Patrick Stewart lifts Eleventh Hour even higher in his portrayal of Ian Hood, a government scientist who investigates the unusual, whether it's medical, environmental or the seemingly natural. Of course, any and everything Hood examines includes an edge of danger if not outright crisis. Stewart's distinctive voice gives the ring of truth to Hood's authority, and his bodyguard, played by Ashley Jensen, contributes a dryly wisecracking appeal to every plotline. Of the four episodes,""Miracle"" may be the most poignant, as cancer patients flock to a water source credited with curing a child--but which in fact may be making things worse for others.  Just released this spring by Acorn, this series originally aired in the UK a decade ago, but its solid writing and credible story sense gives it a fresh and timeless feeling, making it a perfect addition to the Acorn library.",1464652800,,994,5.098159509202454
2620780,4,B000GYI3CC,"In this 2006 British television mini-series, a science-fiction influenced crime drama, Golden Globe nominee Patrick Stewart (X-Men films, Star Trek: The Next Generation) brings his commanding screen presence to the role of Professor Ian Hood, now special scientific troubleshooter for the British government. A man with a taste for danger, Hood has the technical acumen, analytical skills, passion for justice that make him the ideal expert to call in a crisis. Hes backed by his tough-minded, Scottish-accented, wisecracking police-seconded Rachel Young (Ashley Jensen, Ugly Betty, Extras)as his bodyguard. In this four part mini-series, Hood  takes on rogue cloners, ruthless polluters, resurgent viruses, and other menaces at the frontiers of modern science. This is an ITV/Granada production that was written by admired sci-fi writer Stephen Gallagher (Dr. Who), filmed in Manchester, U.K, originally broadcast in the U.K. on ITV in January 2006, and remade in America, starring Rufus Sewell, in 2008.

Its rather different than an American series of similar material might be, paced contemplatively, muted, dark on the screen as well as in intent. No car chases, fistfights, you know.  In it, Stewart is surrounded be a company of distinguished British actors, all of a certain agewhat else would you expect?  We have Roy Marsden, Adam Dalgleish in many televised treatments of the work of British author P.D. James. Sir Ian Holm, unforgettable in Alien. Susan Wooldridge, who was Daphne Manners in Jewel in the Crown, also played in Hope and Glory.  Jane Lapotaire, who was Princess Irina in Downton Abbey.  Clare Holman, Blood Diamond, Inspector Lewis, and a long, long TV resume right up to the current day with Death in Paradise, Scott & Bailey.  The four episodes are  each of which was originally a two-parter:

1. Resurrection.  Police find 27 deformed human fetuses in a mass grave, following on several smaller fetus finds in Eastern Europe.  Hood suspects they are failed attempts at human cloning, work of the mysterious Gepetto.  The life of a surrogate mothers at stake: Hood races to find Gepetto.
2.  Containment.  A worker exhuming bodies from a church dies a gruesome death from a pox-like disease. Hood joins an emergency medical team struggling to identify the infectious hybrid virus, prevent panic and pandemic.
3. Kryptos.  Hoods former classmate the eminent Richard Adams may imminently be making a breakthrough on global warning.  Meanwhile, he seems to be suffering a breakdown, claims that insidious powers are sabotaging him.
4. Miracle.  A childs cancerous tumor seemingly disappears after he has drunk water from a new spring. Hordes of hopeful cancer patients rush to the site, as does Hood.  Only problem is, the water seems to be making all those cancer patients even sicker.

Some of the episodes, as ever, are weaker than others: some seem to have suffered from time constraints.  The boxed set, which I received for review in contemplation of an honest unbiased review, consists of two discs running approximately 274 minutes.  It has subtitles, thank goodness. Be warned, sensitive souls and those with young families, it contains violence, strong language, disturbing images.  Despite its age, it  has an intelligent, ripped from the headlines feel, as does Stewarts other work.  A good, well-acted sci-fi thriller that will grip the viewer from first to last, rate some binge-watching.",1463097600,,3428,5.282287822878229
2620781,5,B000GYI3CC,"The stories were gripping a decade ago in the first Acorn release, but now four feature-length (1.5 hrs) stories include SDH SUBTITLES. It is fictional suspense drama and at least one episode is even more current in topic than 10 years ago. An attempt to Americanize the series occurred in 2008, but this set takes us back to the original fine British actors and locations.
Patrick Stewart plays Dr Hood, a British Government Science Advisor unconcerned with his own threatened life due to the cases hes call to address. Rachel (Ashley Jensen) is government supplied body guard; with an accent on body and with a darling Scottish accent, especially when excited. Other British guest stars create fine casts in all episodes.

1== Resurrection ==
Ian Hood, Science Advisor, followed by bodyguard Rachel are after a doctor trying human cloning. Deformed fetuses in a mass grave is the starting point in a quest to find Gepetto (Jane Lapotaire) the prime suspect. Is cloning going beyond stem-cell research?
2== Containment ==
Disease appears caught by an exhumer of cathedral crypt graves. Hoods called in to aid a virus emergency team. Can they avoid a pandemic? How many gruesome deaths? Not all agree on procedures including a virus specialist (Nicholas Woodeson). Also see Jack Deam. It could happen. Extinct diseases, even the black plague, are kept alive in selective science labs in America, and likely elsewhere.
3== Kryptos ==
Mental health afflicts Hoods old classmate Richard (Donald Sumpter). He makes wild accusations of sabotage on his work on global warming. Hoods investigation gets risky and includes an old flame (Susan Wooldridge). After a decade since this fictional story first appeared, global warming has become additionally accepted as a threat worldwide, although not nearly to the Kryptos level of threatening to submerge London and NYC. Fiction based on truth, but truly more relevant a drama than when it was filmed.
4== Miracle ==
Spring water cures a lads kidney? Hood and Rachel test the substance of the claim. Is it a hoax? Staring Clare Holman (Inspector Lewis Inspector Morse Island at War).",1462406400,2,2123,5.100574712643678

2620783,1,B000GYI3CC,"Lordy, but I wanted to enjoy this series. I mean, Patrick Freakin' Stewart already.

The production values were very good, as I expect British production values to be. Color and sound, lighting and the scenery were fine, this last of which I enjoy from British television. Patrick Stewart and Ashley Jensen were marvelous. But, even Patrick Stewart couldn't rise above the dreck that comprised the four story lines of the series.

Stewart portrays a physicist-government trouble shooter who is simultaneously nerdy and adorkable. Jensen is the police woman who is his government-appointed bodyguard/minder; she is spirited and snarky and a joy to watch.

The title of the series is supposed to derive from a ticking-clock catastrophe to be averted by Stewart and Jensen. But, really. One such doom was essentially a 'publish or perish' peril of an academic. Another had to do with a 'miracle cure' that was anything but (and the one bit of science the show had was well-intentioned but bogus). The stories are lamentably ignorable with no real sense of urgency - or coherent thought.

Really, one star is generous, and that is for the acting which mightily tried to overcome the material but instead left Stewart chewing the scenery on occasion. One can only hope while this was going on he was imagining chewing on the throat of the writer.",1455667200,,1341,4.973214285714286

The 3rd episode (1st of the two on the 2nd DVD) is another matter entirely. It is boring. It is predictable. (Which is not entirely a bad thing - you can predict the ending and save yourself the bother of watching it!) But the worst of it is that it's so politically heavy-handed, one wants to run screaming from the room. To attempt to inject this much fear and hysteria into the threat of global warming, the writers must have been drinking Al Gore's magic Kool-Aid!*  It's an entire hour (although, goodness knows, it seemed longer than that!) of ""Ohmygod, the world is going to end!"" interspersed with sneak peeks at the big bad capitalist conspiracy to suppress this shocking news!

The 2nd episode dealing with an outbreak of small pox was an interesting idea, but the writers played fast and loose with some of the scientific aspects of the story (e.g., observing viruses using a low-power light microscope was rather laughable).  Episode 3 told the story of a how a research institute entirely focused on environmental research that was funded by an oil company was murdering it's scientists for trying to publish results that showed evidence of global warming.  The process of doing science as portrayed throughout this episode was utterly unrealistic and ridiculous.  The writers seemed obviously intent on making a rather heavy-handed political statement...that's fine but they could have done it in a way that was true to the way science is actually practiced.
