2245941,5,B0007VY3ZK,"The History Channel re-aired this series recently in a marathon one Saturday. I was at work, and it was a slow day, and we happened to turn on the TV when the programs were up to about Abraham Lincoln, in the early afternoon. For the remainder of the day, besides a few minutes here and there of having to take phone calls, my co-worker and I were absolutely glued to the TV. When 4:00 came around, I got home as quick as I could, and my fiancee and I saw and watched at least another hour of the program together.

Of course, the programs are not as in-depth as some of the more serious history buffs might have hoped for, but they were great for providing not only a general overview of each President's administration, but also for giving you a sense of the feel of the times in which each President lived; plus there was plenty of misc. trivia along the way - ""useless information"", as I like to call it - and I loved that, as well, because it's just interesting stuff that you would never hear in a history class.

My fiancee and I intend to buy this program and show it to our kids one day, because it seemed very much to us like something that would be good for them, and we plan to put a lot of work into their education.

In short, we HIGHLY RECOMMEND this series.",1116374400,169,1273,4.209016393442623
2245942,3,B0007VY3ZK,"PBS did such a great job with ""The American President"" series in 2000 on PBS (except for it not being chronological).  So why did the HC attempt their own Presidents special 5 years later?  Well it looks as though they thought a hipper presentation might draw a younger and therefore larger faction of viewers... but all they did with their ridiculous drum machine, fast editied hip-fest-  was turn off the Presidential Trivia Nerds like myself who were marking their calendars for this thing.  AND kids... well kids have a plethora of programs to watch on TV or DVD before they'll want to settle in on the ins-and-outs of Franklin Pierce's administration.  What a waste.

Don't get me wrong.  It is informative and well-researched... but just obnoxiously presented.  Perhaps this DVD release will be a good thing for teachers to use though...as they have a monopoly on the children's eyes/ears that I think the History Channel intended it for.",1111622400,15,944,4.930379746835443
2245943,1,B0007VY3ZK,"I saw this documentary when it originally aired on the History Channel.  I was so excited about it that I almost pre-purchased the DVD set before actually viewing it.  Boy am I glad I held off!!!  The thing that utterly ruins this is the dreadful editing.  Images flash across the screen at such a rapid pace that the viewer can't take them in.  All the sustained movement on the screen makes it extremely difficult to concentrate on anything the narrator or historians are saying.  Not only is there not enough time between images to allow the mind and eye to adjust, but much of the time images are ""artistically"" rendered to shake, fade, run across the screen like a train, overlay one another, bump into each other like boxing gloves, etc..  This works for about 15 seconds.  After that it is literally painful to watch.

This is all so sad because this could easily have been an absolutely brilliant production.  One of the great things about Ken Burns films is that Burns carefully chooses only the best images to illustrate the story being told.  He chooses quality over quantity and doesn't over-edit.  His images make the viewer feel as though they are a part of what they are watching.  As I watched Presidents, however, I felt like I was in a pinball machine.

Having seen (and greatly enjoyed) plenty of History Channel documentaries, I fully realize that they generally incorporate more flashy editing techniques than Ken Burns documentaries.  Believe me, though, the Presidents documentary went annoyingly WAAAAAY overboard.  Don't make the mistake of buying this!  (this product compelled me to write this, my first review ever)",1111276800,52,1643,4.894927536231884

2245947,4,B0007VY3ZK,"The Presidents is a miniseries that originally aired on The History Channel in 2005. It is an overview of the first forty-three men to have been President of the United States from George Washington to George W. Bush.

The series is composed of eight episodes each about forty-five minutes in length. Each episode covers five or six presidents. Every person to have been president is covered including Grover Cleveland twice as he served non-consecutive terms. Each segment mainly covers a couple of the most important events or accomplishments of their administrations along with some personality traits of each man. From this series you can learn such personal facts such as how angry Andrew Jackson could be, the humor of Abraham Lincoln, or Richard Nixon's secretiveness. Because of the limited time of the series, only the most important events are covered. Most importantly this includes conduct of wars as the president is the commander-in-chief and is ultimately responsible for the conduct of a war. This includes Lincoln and the Civil War, Franklin Roosevelt and World War II, and even George H.W. Bush and the Gulf War. These segments include interviews from historians that help explain the story of each president. This is expanded with later presidents as contemporaries who personally knew a president, including journalists and advisers, are interviewed. This even includes an appearance by one former president: Jimmy Carter.

Due to the nature of this presentation, there were a couple of disappointments. Oftentimes, this comes from wanting more coverage of a particular president. More time is given to those that had a bigger effect on American history such as Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt. For example, Gerald Ford's segment says little else other than he was a decent man who made the tough decision to pardon Nixon. The narration even mentions other accomplishments that are overshadowed by the pardon, but never explains what they are. As a minor annoyance, I was surprised during the Warren Harding segment that one historian interviewed suggested that history has been unfair to Harding and instead considers him a near great president. This is despite the overwhelming consensus among historians that Harding was one of the worst presidents.

Despite some points that are missing here and there, I thought this was a generally enjoyable look at the history of the American Presidency. While not the deepest examination of the presidents, it is likely to be enjoyed by those that are interested in American history.",1469750400,,2569,5.245742092457421

Yes everyone has their opinion but all the shows that had me glued to you are being fizzled out of your programing. Pawn stars, American restoration, American pickers, counting cars. Those type of shows, not hitler crud or cursed island whatever. I'm watching you 80%+ than I used to 90% would be more accurate.

2245979,1,B0007VY3ZK,"This propaganda piece from American companies makes the Russian's work look good. Histrionics, lies, and all around elevation of men who were inherently less than idealistic than what most schools teach about. Your best bet is to look at this as nothing more than cheap agitprop or some type of hilarious cover up of wealthy white men with outdated values.

Most of the ""great Presidents"" owned slaves, denied expression to women, believed in wage-slavery, didn't think Native people were human and didn't want to pay centralized taxes for England's protection.

America (USA) has never been a ""democracy"", it has always been controlled by a small minority of powerful and wealthy elites, using indoctrination, a contorted educational system, a specialized intelligence police force, and propaganda, such as this, to shape the masses. These are the ""men"" to blame for the gigantic, bureaucratic war state that is America today. Go read Orwell or Howard Zinn again, unless of course you like to believe in lies.",1387152000,,1010,5.190184049079755
2245980,5,B0007VY3ZK,I have had a number of very good educational films from the History Channel. This collection of brief stories about our 43 US presidents is a good starting point in understanding who these presidents were and how they contributed to the building of our nation. The write up on each president might be brief but each story contains some key pieces of information that stands out.

2245986,3,B0007VY3ZK,"As a history teacher, it is not always easy to catch the attention of high school students. The series does this fairly well, but there is a left-leaning bias that must be fleshed out with proper discussion, as well as presidents from both parties who get a pass or are skewered without proper balance. Clinton's presidency is made to look like one huge scandal. Nixon is ripped apart with little mention of his tremendous accopmlishments in office. Reagan is brushed off as little more than boob who stumbled into good fortune. One would think that Carter is the closest thing to a saint on Earth. Did they really have to focus on Taft's weight so much? It would have been nice if the producers told the truth about Wilson: that he would be appalled today at what the Fed has become (and also the constant picketing of women in front of the White House). Well, any decent history teacher with a fair degree of knowledge can augment the program.",1355616000,6,945,4.597633136094674

2245988,5,B0007VY3ZK,"I have watched this show before and it was good. My favorite presidents were Lincoln and FDR. President Lincoln freed the slaves and he was president during the horrific Civil war between the north and the south. Hundreds and hundreds of soldiers were killed in battle. the tragic was when Lincoln was the first president to be assassinated in office. FDR was the longest president in the US. He was the president during WW2. FDR was crippled with polio and he asked the congress to declare war on Japan after Pearl Harbor was attacked. I love this show and it is one of the best educated video for people who were struggled with American History because American History is one of my favorite periods because I want to learn how our beautiful country was rised, created, and fought bravely for our freedom and for our leader.

For each president you are introduced to them with basic facts followed by a discussion of their major accomplishments as US President.  Being produced by the History Channel this is a good quality documentary with great factual information.

2246002,1,B0007VY3ZK,"As a history teacher - I was thrilled to get this program. The Early information - from funding to 1961 - done well - Lincoln is given a less the positive review and the 20th century presidents are given the great Marxist treatment - only the American left can provide. Example - The Pledge of Allegiance is quoted - but they take out ""one nation under God."" Very sad!!!!!! Carter is given the respect - Reagan should get - yet Reagan is treated like a president who failed, when Carter's administration was failure from start to finish. In short - if your a Democratic Marxist who believes in cradle to grave regulation you'll love it - it is a modern political fairytale. If you are a Free market, God fearing capitalist - who believes in equality of opportunity and not outcome - don't bother!!!!!

It is time to tell the left - no more - we will not listen to your lies and historical distortions. Without question - Reagan was the greatest president of the 20th century - and anyone who will tell you different - is a Clinton loving Marxist - who overlooked one scandal after another - his too, would have been a failed presidency if it was not for the Republican Congress that balanced the budget in the 90s - not ""I Feel your (wife) pain"" Billy! Bill was the reason for the housing market failure in the early 21 century - not Bush - he tried to fix it and the democrats in congress refused to address the issue - check out youtube congressional hearings. Don't waste your money!!!!! If you believe the world would be better without America in it-Obama - then you will love this video. Sad thing about Democrats and liberal republicans - they would not know the truth if it bit them in the back side.

2246003,5,B0007VY3ZK,"Since I was in school I grew up to know the names of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, john Adams, Abraham Lincoln and all the like and to know the many great deeds these great men did for our country. They formed a nation out of separate states with separate values and beliefs to bring together in the common goal of freedom.. We all know these great deeds and deep down we all still hold dear that want to be free.. Men like this helped build the core of our own beliefs and the foundation of our great nation, this nation I love and believe in..I thank these men for that.

Did you ever wonder what these great men did in their spare time or what kind of odd things they did, maybe what kind of quirky things did they do? I often wondered this because I know I have many quirks like most people but I never heard what our leaders of the pasts were..What hobbies did they have, were they depressed or like Roosevelt did any other presidents have any kind of handicap...Or what caught me funny was oh yeah I forgot about that Millard Fillmore guy lol..Or even Ulysses S Grant whom I've always been fascinated with But I never heard some of the things about him that I heard on this documentary..I was so fascinated by all of these episodes that I just keep watching them time and again...Abraham Lincoln was such a great man and being that I'm an Illinois native I love hearing the stories of when he grows up so some of the little things on here helped me understand who he was. I also was sad that despite these great things he had so many tragedies...

If you don't own The Complete Book Of U.S. Presidents, any U.S. history books, or you don't know much about the presidents, you'll learn by watching this.  Myself, I've been able to name the presidents in order and the years they served since I was probably 8 or 9 years old.  Learning the biographical information and many details about their presidencies came in later years through reading, taking history courses, and watching this program, which does an excellent job of summing up in a short amount of time each president, their administration, and the events happening at the time they were president.  Also included for each president is a rundown of certain characteristics, such as personality, marital status, number of children, management style, etc.

The total running time is 6 hours and 40 minutes and is presented in widescreen.  The series is broken up into eight parts.  My personal favorite part covers the time period from 1865-1885 (Johnson to Arthur).  I think Edward Herrmann is the perfect narrator for this series.  Comments are given throughout the series by historians and even some ex-presidents.

Each video is short (I want to say no more than 10 mins. each), colorful, with lots of pictures, with music, and has an interesting narrator. I also like that they include little known trivia facts about each president. It is easy to create questions for students to answer just by listening to the video and I would recommend it for low level up to average level students as an assignment or with upper level students as an introduction to a unit or president. It is appropriate for 5th-6th grade all the way up to 12th grade.",1290988800,8,772,4.3310344827586205

I feel they focused on Reagan's negatives and made him look at an idiot and discredited his impact in America. They gave Carter an open opportunity to defend his administration himself on the video. I got the ""Pre-Obama"" (Carter - Bush 43) updated one which is good. I saw the Carter - Obama version on TV and an glad I do not have that one. They cut Bush's segment and added a bit on the ""Amazing Hope that Swept Across America"" and how America can finally look forward to it's future and all that drivel. Nothing factual. They should have waited till we had three more Presidents and done another special. Regardless of your feeling towards Bush or Obama... It was a puff piece and it is not History... it is adoration. Aside from that... It was a very good piece... Get the pre-Obama one if you can.",1276041600,11,913,4.408284023668639
2246022,5,B0007VY3ZK,"The History Channel has come up with a series about our presidents, that is steeped in trivia, without being too deep, and is something from which even Sean Hannity could learn. Our presidents are divided into three DVD's with a bonus feature about some of the wives, very few of whom interested me outside of Eleanor Roosevelt.

This production can tell you who the first re-elected Democrat was since Andrew Jackson, who was the first president from West Point, who was the first born west of the Mississippi, who were grandfather and grandson presidents, who was the only Ph. D. or ordained preacher, where the candy bar, ""Baby Ruth"" came from, and which Republican president challenged the captains of industry and won. One of my favorites was an actress who sat beside President Calvin Coolidge at a dinner. She turned to him and said, ""I bet I can make you say more than two words during dinner."" ""You lose,"" he replied.

The series provides an endless stream of information about each of them. A scroll announces each president by habit, personality and temperment, home state, and age upon taking office. Narrator Edward Herman continues telling something about each one. It ends with George W. Bush. The series was circulated in 2004.

I've had this for many months now, but yesterday was one of those lazy, rainy, nothing-to-do days that was perfect for watching ""The Presidents."" I recommend it for one of yours.

Myself being one of the serious students, watch these videos on a regular basis to help reinforce my broad general knowledge of American History. Students of history can tend to get caught up in the more popular areas of American History and neglect others. By focusing on each individual president, the viewer not only learns about the men, but also the political climate and issues that they faced. Each president will begin by a set of ""fun facts"", such as info on him and interesting facts. From there his administration will be covered in addition to a good overview of the nation during his term. One of my favorite things they do in this series is have a hint of modern rock playing in the back that gives it a strong edge and and interesting clash.

2246028,1,B0007VY3ZK,"Overall, this set of DVDs (based on the History Channel documentary) is entertaining, and I enjoyed watching it. However, I was surprised by how much praise, adulation and attention are paid to President Jimmy Carter. No matter your political stripes, Carter's four years in office (1977-81) are hardly considered one of the high points in American history. This documentary makes Carter sound like one of the ""great presidents"", up there with the likes of Washington, Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. Indeed, if you knew nothing about American history prior to watching this program, you'd believe Jimmy Carter was the greatest American president since FDR.

I was also surprised to see that Carter himself appears in this documentary as an interviewee, commenting on his presidency and why he did this or that. If the History Channel was going to include Carter as a panelist, why not also include Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton? All of these presidents were ""former"" presidents by the time this documentary was produced, and I would have rather heard ANY comments from any of those men than Carter.

Carter comes off as somewhat dim-witted, as he literally tries to explain and justify different decisions he made as president. It strikes of self-aggrandizement, shameless self promotion, however you would put it. It reeks of irresponsible history and shoddy research and production values.

I would not be so vocal about this, were it not for my memories of the energy crisis, the hostage standoff with Iran, and the blunders and snafus that lead to the contentious 1980 Democratic presidential race, which all culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan. If the producers had spent the amount of time and energy on Reagan (who unarguably DID change the world in a positive way by ending Soviet Communism) that they spent on Carter, I would award this 5 stars. But as it stands, I cannot recommend this set, and I would encourage anyone to steer clear of it.",1253232000,37,1975,4.996960486322188

2246033,4,B0007VY3ZK,"This presentation of The Presidents is pretty good until about the post-Eisenhower era.  After that the modern day bias of the press kicks in.  This is unfortunate, because most of this series is terrific, and gives a pretty evenhanded summary of the presidencies of most of the presidents.  By doing so this series gives the viewer a wonderful look at American history and the place each of the presidents occupies within it.

Lyndon Johnson gets a very sympathetic hearing from this series despite the fact that he is responsible for the Vietnam disaster.  The bias really begins with Richard Nixon, who is virtually caricatured.  The press hated Nixon's guts, and this comes through very clearly in the treatment that ""The Presidents"" dishes out to him. (I am no big Nixon fan, but this series wrongly states that he escalated the Vietnam War when in reality he promptly began drawing down US troop levels in Vietnam, notwithstanding his attacks on Communist sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia.) Jimmie Carter's failed presidency mostly gets a pass for its disastrous failures on both the domestic and international fronts. The series makes no mention of the crazed levels of inflation and interest rates that occurred on Carter's watch.  His feckless foreign policy is portrayed through rose colored glasses--Carter himself informs the viewer that Carter learned how ""to work well with others."" Watching this series, one would conclude that Carter was a successful president, rather than the one-term failure that he actually was. (To this series' credit, it does a fair job analyzing Gerald Ford's presidency.) Ronald Reagan is introduced as ""a former movie actor"" rather than as, for example, the former two-term governor of California.  Nothing is said of the speed that Reagan's countermanding of Carter's policies had in reviving the American economy and position abroad.  Instead, Reagan is portrayed as not very bright, and ""out of the loop.""  His economic and tax cutting policies ""simply caused deficits.""  Bias can go little further.  Put simply, this series' portrayal of Ronald Reagan's presidency is unacceptably biased, and a good example of why the American people no longer place any trust in journalists or the press.  George HW Bush is portrayed as having been ""wise"" to break his promise on making tax cuts, and the series (without rebuttal by anyone) intones that the Bush and Clinton tax increases (""which were probably a good idea..."") helped fuel the boom of the 90s!  I suppose it was too much to hope that modern-day journalists could avoid the big government, pro-high tax bias that so permeates the modern-day press.  An objective look at our recent presidents will no doubt have to wait until America has a more unbiased press interested in reporting the news, rather than pushing a single leftward political bias.

But enjoy!  Excepting the last four or so presidents, this is a fine series, well worth the viewer's attention.",1242000000,16,2957,5.114345114345114

Histrionics, lies, and all around elevation of men who were inherently less than idealistic than what most schools teach about. Your best bet is to look at this as nothing more than cheap agitprop or some type of hilarious cover up of wealthy white men with outdated values.

Most of the ""great Presidents"" owned slaves, denied expression to women, believed in wage-slavery, didn't think Native people were human and didn't want to pay centralized taxes for England's protection.

America (USA) has never been a ""democracy"", it has always been controlled by a small minority of powerful and wealthy elites, using indoctrination, a contorted educational system, a specialized intelligence police force, and propaganda, such as this, to shape the masses. These are the ""men"" to blame for the gigantic, bureaucratic war state that is America today.

2246044,3,B0007VY3ZK,"I caught most of this series on 'H' and really enjoyed the historical ""flyovers"" of the presidencies.  Most deserve in depth treatments like they did for ""Teddy Roosevelt an American Lion"", or a dramatic treatment like HBO's ""John Adams"".  I started having problems when we hit the presidencies where I was a sentient adult AND of voting age.  Reagan they hit pretty fair and well and hit both sides of the fence given the ten minutes they had to use. George H. W. Bush made no mention of his illegal invasion of Panama to extradite his Iran Contra/Cocaine go between, Noriega from Bush-the CIA years... just a sentence or two would have been nice.  Clinton's whole presidency came off as a daisy chain of sex scandals with not one mention of the bitter neo-con and Starr Wars attacks that began beginning before he was sworn in continued unabated until his impeachment - yeah he had some personal issues AND he was far more right of center than I would have preferred in a Democrat, but...  Then we get to the Son of Bush were they obliquely made only glancing blows to a richly deserving punching bag.  I don't know what to say, here?  Are they (History Channel) waiting for the dust to settle before committing to a version of history? Are they helping Rove revise the last 8 years, or at least put them in a softer light?  I don't know?  But, this one 10-minute block in particular tainted all of the other presentations of the previous 42...  Bush wasn't unlucky, he was just incompetent.  Okay he was decisive, but if you decide to put your hand in a fire at some point you might decide to change your mind.  Not George.  Maybe when this series is revamped to span through the 50th Presidency the history 43rd will have gelled enough for them to mention the constitutional vagaries of Bush policies, orders and signing statements. Maybe they'll make more prominent the unprecedented executive power grabs, and obstructions of justice.  And, maybe the Bush Doctrine will have more of a negative connotation by then. All I can say is 10 minutes?  No way, can't be done.  I guess it's all too fresh, still.

An earlier review stated that this series was reflective of a left-wing bias in our media. (H'oh, boy. More nuts)

One thing this series did illustrate loud and clear is that some of what has felt like 8 years of insanity should not but viewed as innovative or new.  The history of this country is filled periods of insanity and injustice very similar to what have just experienced.  It's amazing that we still hold the Constitution in such high regard with all the contradictions we are and have been enmeshed in.

I think the only reason I give this a 3-star is that it leaves me wanting more...  And, I suppose that is a good thing.",1232928000,,2746,4.584016393442623

2246059,4,B0007VY3ZK,"2003's ""The History Channel Presents The Presidents"" is a nicely done survey of our first 43 presidents.  Each President gets a concise description of their time in office, buttressed by short commentary from various historians and a few prominent personalties.  The segements include paintings, pictures, photography, and as we get closer to the present, motion pictures of each man.

No great historical depth is promised or delivered here.  The intended audience is clearly the general viewer, many of whom will have forgotten some of the more obscure presidents.  The narration is short, punchy, and tone-neutral.  For presidents who served before the era of widely-available television, video dating as far back as the terms of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, turns these men from statues into real, breathing, moving human beings in context.

This DVD series is highly recommended as an introduction to the history of our presidents, suitable for a wide variety of interested viewers.",1204588800,45,999,5.406451612903226
2246060,4,B0007VY3ZK,The 'only' problem is that once the DVD reaches the Carter administration - every Democrat President could do little wrong and every Republican President could do little right. The opinions of the 'experts' take a huge LEFT turn. Even high schools kids point out how bias the comments are.,1201046400,5,289,4.918367346938775
2246061,4,B0007VY3ZK,This is a very insightful and entertaining program. It may not be detailed enough to satisfy ardent history buffs but it does cover the major events of each president's administration as well as the personal quirks of all the chief executives. Highly recommended.,1200960000,3,263,5.1395348837209305
2246062,1,B0007VY3ZK,"I generally have no problem with history channel productions, but this one reeks of left wing bias.  I admit I only watched the disk with the latest presidents (Johnson, Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush).  I don't think there are overt untruths in the documentaries, but the slant is very clearly to the left.  When talking about any of these presidents, who have 4-8 years of history you're compressing into a 10 minute ""documentary"", you could choose to pack your ""documentary"" with favorable accomplishments, or unfavorable controversies and failures.  I would compare the tone of this documentary to that of many in the liberal/mainstream media (of whom 80-90% have been documented to vote democrat in presidential elections since Kennedy).  The discussions of democratic presidents are ""gushing"", glossing over problems as though they were mere victims of circumstances beyond their control.  Republican discussions are filled with much more negative language and choice of content.  Watching the Carter and Reagan ""documentaries"" back to back almost made me sick (due to the GLARING difference in the way they were treated).  I would sum it up like this: if you recognize the media is leftward/democratic leaning, you will very likely notice and be annoyed by this biased ""documentary.""  If you don't think the media is leftward leaning, you will likely think this is an excellent series, as it is literally an extension of the current mainstream media perspective, which in my opinion is quite left of center.",1198800000,59,1526,5.246913580246914

2246065,4,B0007VY3ZK,"It would take thousands of hours to create a comprehensive historical analysis of these fellas. This program was a fair and interesting set of facts and folklore about the men of the executive branch. I would recommend viewing this and purchasing it for the home or public library. This was well done. One nice thing to note about this and other History channel presentations is to add that good authors with interesting viewpoints were included in the interviews and lectures. Also consider ""A History of God"" by The History Channel.",1184716800,9,534,4.944444444444445

It is wonderfully segmented so that if you just want put it on for an half an hour or so, no problem.

The details and trivia of each of the presidents is tastefully done and as unbiased as is possible in this day and age.

We're continuously learning more and more every day and it's interested my 6 year old as well. Now we all have trivia quiz's at the table and love it!

Well done, History Channel and thanks!",1168905600,4,505,4.070707070707071

2246071,5,B0007VY3ZK,My husband and our 24 year old college grad son sat spell-bound in front of the television over the holiday.  This series on the Presidents must be one of the best ever produced. As far as I'm concerned I hit a home run with this gift.,1168300800,3,235,4.108695652173913
2246072,3,B0007VY3ZK,"I enjoyed most of it, however I found that there was a major slant to the right. Herbert Hoover and Warren Harding were called fair to good presidents?? Who are we kidding. AS someone who is going to be going to grad school for American presidential History, even most right wing scholars would lump Harding and Hoover into the bad category!

I did however like hearing about people like Polk who WERE fairly good presidents.

I would buy it!",1148688000,4,442,4.582278481012659
2246073,4,B0007VY3ZK,"Very interesting but many facts omitted. To be fair, it's possible they were simply trying to avoid the series being 85 hours ;-) There are many facts here, and just as much coverage of what a given expert thinks and feels. When you can tell the political stripe of a historian, it's a red flag.

For example, the man dominate in discussing Bill Clinton practically gushed as well as giving him credit for things he did not do. The same man was the main expert in judging George W Bush - he clearly hates him. It makes me wonder what else this documentary has glossed over and slanted. Maybe, maybe not, but when sold as history, I want history not personal opinions and theories.

To be fair I should note I'm Conservative and am probably equally slanted the other way. But I listen to all. I didn't fast-forward through Bill Clinton now did I? ;-)

Overall though I'd say buy this set, as well as ""Founding Brothers"" and ""Founding Fathers"" also from History Channel. They are great. Who knew Samuel Adams wore the same red suit everyday?",1144540800,15,1039,4.545454545454546
2246074,4,B0007VY3ZK,"Excellent coverage. I learned a lot, and haven't seen it all yet. My wife taught elementary school socoial studies  and she was the one who ordered this after we saw part of it on PBS.",1143244800,6,184,4.257142857142857
2246075,2,B0007VY3ZK,"Like a previous reviewer, this is my first-ever review on amazon because I felt this series was absolutely butchered by the editing and use of images.

Not only do the images flash across the screen so quickly that you cannot absorb them and they give you a headache, but it is done in a repetitive and even misleading manner.  In a series about all the american presidents you'd expect to see a few shots of the white house.  However, the same shot of the white house is used over and over and over, and when you get tired of that, they shoot it from a different angle and show that over and over and over.  It's very distracting to watch.  It's almost like they couldn't think of anything for an image half the time, so they went to that tired old shot of the white house, over and over again.  I think if they put some time into it they could have found hundreds of paintings, photographs, newspaper articles, statues, locations and objects to shoot video of.  Heck, even more shots of the inside of the white house would have mixed it up some.

Worse than that is the inherent misleading nature of presenting modern video (with cars!) of the white house, capitol or Washington, D.C. while you are talking about events 200 years ago.  The entire city of Washington looked very different than it does today and 80% of the presented video is not accurate to the time period it is talking about.  They constantly zoom in on the capitol dome when the dome was not finished until 1863, and constantly show the wrong facade of the white house for the period.  At one point they talk about John Adams creating the U.S. Navy while they show a jet landing on an aircraft carrier and a submarine surface (but no shots of any ships of the period).

Sometimes the image being shown is even completely misleading.  For example, when talking about ford's theater they show a wide shot of a small church in the countryside and then zoom in to the real ford's theater sign that says ""ford's theater.""  When talking about the senate they show the interior of the library of congress.  When talking about a print shop in philadelphia they show a random building in williamsburg.  When talking about Congress Hall in Philly they show a shot of Independence Hall.  When talking about the early years of diplomacy with Great Britain and France they repeatedly juxtapose Big Ben, the Washington Monument and the Eiffel Tower as imagery when NONE of those had been built yet.

These things go on and on until it gets more and more painful to watch.  The script and information presented is actually not bad, though I thought they missed a lot of great opportunities to color the characters with more interesting anecdotes and stories.

Bottom line is, turn your tv off and play it through your stereo.  The information is great but the video renders it unwatchable and even misleading.  If you can't do that, read a book on the subject.",1137715200,92,2916,4.578034682080925
2246076,5,B0007VY3ZK,Totally disregard the negative review that is given about poor editing. This presentation is perfectly fine and does an excellent job covering all 43 presidents. It's amazing to see how different each president used their position. Highly recommending. Who does it better than the History Channel?,1137196800,11,297,5.478260869565218
2246077,5,B0007VY3ZK,"I absolutely LOVED this program and have learned so much from it. the ONLY criticism I have is that, in the beginning segment of each president, they have a little info card that flashes accross the screen so fast, you can't read it all unless you pause your dvd.

other than that, it is an absolute wealth of information. I have so much more respect for the presidents now. it seems that just about every one of them - even the 'bad' ones - really tried to make this country better. so many institutions and organizations were made from these presidents, and I didn't even know that until I saw this.",1130112000,66,601,4.414414414414415
2246078,3,B0007VY3ZK,"I thought the History Channel document of the Presidents was really well written and very good. I enjoyed watching about the presidents we all know about and learning about ones we rarely hear about like Buchanan, Arthur, Polk among others. My only complaints were the opinion of James Madison and War of 1812 deserved a lot more credit. It was the only war in which our country was invaded by another. James Madison is the only president during a time when our capital was sacked. I would of liked to of seen more about his presdency and how he managed to keep the country and politicans together after such an event.
My second problem was why during Wilson's term they didn't mention the women picketing right in front of the White House day in and day out.",1118880000,18,759,4.547445255474453
