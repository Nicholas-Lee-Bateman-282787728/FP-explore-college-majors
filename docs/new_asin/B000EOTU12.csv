8112054,5,B000EOTU12,"I first saw this version of ""Ah! My Goddess"" online via another legal video streaming service and I fell in love with it.  I'm a huge fan of the OVA and this was done by the same director/producer Hiraoki Goda.

This anime is excellent for those who are either new to Anime or for those who like Fantasy and ""Slice of life"" anime. It's characters all have great stories and the overall story arc reaches a nice climax at the last show of the first season, and finishes in the first episode(s) of the 2nd season.
Great good guys, some moronic fall-back characters, wonderful bad guys (not very dangerous overall) and great mix of romance and missed opportunities by both of the protagonists.",1418515200,,690,4.6016260162601625
8112055,5,B000EOTU12,"I can not explain it in words how touching the story was about love and commitment between the two love birds, but I give it 6 stars for the story of true love and friendship for all the characters with a few exceptions.",1417996800,,220,4.1395348837209305
8112056,3,B000EOTU12,"The conflict in the Ah My Goddess is caused by the passivity of its main character Keiichi, who even though he could ask Belldandy to do ANYTHING for him, he holds back. He really does love her but even though he's going to college, he's like a little boy when it comes to the opposite sex. Belldandy on the other hand, doesn't know a thing about the grittier sides of human relationships so she's never going to make a move...well, that's not entirely true. When Skuld finds out that Urd is making a magic pill that will embolden Keiichi, she sabotages the concoction. But on accident, it's actually Belldandy that eats it, and as a result, her feelings for Keiichi are magnified a hundredfold, to the point, to the point that she becomes a borderline tramp! In the next episode, when Urd and Skuld have to temporarily return to Heaven, Skuld again messes up things by turning Keiichi into a girl so nothing freaky will happen while she's gone! The last two episodes on Volume 5 feature Urd prominently as the mysteries of why her angel never appears are raised when Skuld wishes for her own angel after hearing Belldandy singing with Holy Bell. Marller, the ineffectual demon who wants revenge on our girls has gained a little more power by becoming the servant of ""The Lord of Terror"", a powerful demon who is currently trapped inside a bottle and will try to encourage Urd's questionable heritage in order to make its ambitions of destroying the world real.

This volume of Ah My Goddess was not a particularly enjoyable one for me. To me, the show is at its best when the magic takes a backseat to the characters instead of driving the plot, like the early volumes, when they were apartment hunting or when they were go-kart racing. Now, everything involves some magic gobbledy gook every installment, which is really quite boring. The character of Skuld has become increasingly annoying incrementally and serves no purpose other than being a wedge between Belldandy and Keiichi. That was another thing about Volume 5. It wasn't really that funny. We've started to get some darker undertones that do not suit the show at all. I like Goddess but I feel its best days are behind it.",1151193600,,2185,4.690104166666667
8112057,5,B000EOTU12,"The quiet in the Morisato household is blown away in the most recent episode of this wonderful series. Urd and Skulds interference creates an opportunity for the relationship between Belldandy and Keiichi to take a major step forward. Later though, Skulds brattiness and the sisters uncompromising devotion to one another causes problems that threaten to change the storyline permanently. Unquestionably, the star of this series of episodes is Urd, who proves to be far more complex, and facinating, than her slacker reputation would have suggested.
I have found this series a genuine treat for the moment I first saw it, and my admiration for its story telling has only increased with this entry. While the ultimate happy ending is coming into question, I've got to see how this turns out. If you ever had an interest in this story, don't miss this entry.",1149811200,3,856,4.993006993006993
8112058,5,B000EOTU12,"Ok. Nobody yet gave any shred about what actually in the volume 5. I will do it, but not too much. The volume 5, In your eyes, is a volume where many big things happen. First, the relationship between Belldandy and Keich gets really upgraded. Urd tried to make a love pill that may make Keich to be a warrior of love. Skuld, who is always dedicated to protect Belldandy from Keich, put extra seasonings on the Urd's pill when Urd is out of her room. On top of that, Belldandy, not keich, took the effect-unknown pill, thinking that it is a candy. And, all the funny things are happening, because of it. I will say no more, otherwise Ah My Goddess lovers will kill me for leaking the secret. In the second episode, Urd and Skuld went to the heaven for maintanonce of the igdrasil system, leaving Belldandy and Keich alone together at the temple! Skuld, of course, prepared something that will protect Belldandy from keich's potential misdeeds. The ingenious idea of Skuld is a magic dessert that transforms Keich into a girl, well not 100% but almost. To return him back to a man, Belldandy tried medicines to Keich but unfortunately herself also got poisoned by deadly virus. And, the female Keich did lots of things to cure Belldandy. This episode has something very important but I will not say it here. But any way, the first and second episodes brings Belldandy and keich's relationship into a big big step forward. The third and forth episode is more serious than humorous. Skuld admires Belldandy's guardian angel, Holy Bell, and wanted to have one for herself. But she is too young and needs more power to create and support her own angel, so Skuld has training with Belldandy. So far, the story sounds like nothing fun but there is some complication with Urd too in terms of the guardian angel matter. Ooh, I may have said too much.... But, one thing that I do want to say is that this episode has my favorite scene where Urd commands her guardian angel to appear, which is truly moving and touchy. The last episode of this volume contains a story jumping to heavy realm from the overall romantic tone of the entire show. This episode in fact opens the whole series of stories for Volume 6 (The Last Dance). Urd became the legendary Lord of Terror who is believed to possess the power of ultimate destruction. Hand-in-hand with Marla, the demon and also a sworn enemy of goddess, Urd attacked the temple with power beyond that of her two sisters. I am not blowing too much whistle, this is already known in Vol. 6 product introduction any way. So, all in all, volume 5 certainly forwards dramatically in both Belldandy & Keich relationship and the scale of storyline. As always, brilliant pictures and beautiful music. I think that this volume is one that you must listen to in Japanese original recordings rather than English dub. Because there are so many vocal nuances and delicate tones that simply don't be generated other than in original language. Can you imagine that Urd is saying in the same way as Belldandy does in whispering soft tone? Oftentimes, I found movies that others recommend are actually boring to me, so that I seldom believe others advice on movies. But, I cannot help praise it so much that this series is a something different.",1149292800,3,3262,4.645328719723183
8112059,5,B000EOTU12,"I was a little worried after the last AMG! disc that the plot was going to turn into one big horrid jumbled mess with gimmick after gimmick character introduced.

Glad to say that wasn't the case.  If the last volume was filler material, fan service, and a little too stereotypical harem manga, this one's none of those things.  Each episode advances the stalled plot along nicely, and are done well enough you actually are anticipating the next volume's release again.  After 4, I wasn't so sure. ;)

I won't spoil it, but let's just say that we FINALLY see Keichi getting a pair in this one, even though he does still act like a nancy around Bell.  The writer's must have realized him being that shy and lame with gals was not only hindering the plot but also getting repetitive.

Lotsa fun bits with Urd!  I still gotta say I prefer the very first Volume over this one, but this has been the closest one to hold that similar magic and make you feel like the plot's going somewhere interesting.  Hope you enjoy it, I did!",1149120000,3,1023,4.456989247311828
