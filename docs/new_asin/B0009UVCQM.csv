Leisa does alot of pilates based moves that really work the glutes and do youever feel it, its a great video to have!!!",1130457600,4,284,4.480769230769231
2322174,5,B0009UVCQM,"i use to use all of the Buns of Steel tapes and Jane Fonda and Kathy Smith, and i have really become a fan of Leisa Hart and her style of fitness instruction, and this SEXY BUNS tape is probably the BEST BUNS WORKOUT i have ever used. It is not an overly advance workout like a Cathe F or some other over the top tape, its a moderately intermediate to advanced style that is fun fun fun, My butt was sore for days, and not in a painful way, it was a great glute blast and leisa is a great leader. I  SO LOVE THIS WORKOUT, it is more than a FIVE STAR.",1129507200,5,550,3.824561403508772
8066795,4,B0009UVCQM,"This is an easy way to benefit your buns. The workout provides low stress exercises for you. your butt is not killing you, but if done enough, shows great improvement in the shape of your glutes.",1257897600,,195,4.444444444444445
8066796,1,B0009UVCQM,"Very rarely do I write a review, but I felt compelled to do so, because of how bad this DVD was.

This workout is not strenous at all.  It will not tone or sculpt your buns.  As another reviewer wrote, there are no repetitions of exercises.  I was not challenged by this workout, nor did I feel the ""day after burn,"" which you need to feel in order to see results.

I recommend Tamilee Webb's I want that body series.",1171324800,,417,4.1625
8066797,5,B0009UVCQM,"after 6 weeks of doing this workout, i am totally ready for my bikini and the beach....leisa hart saved me during my last pregnancy with her awesome fitmama workouts, and 5 months after having my baby, and just 6 weeks of doing this video, i have never felt better...the music and the set are very cool, pretty colors and sexy tone...i loved the lunge routine and the bootie could feel it the next day...you sometimes forget you are working out since you are not jumping up and down, my heartrate was ideal and i was in the groove, this is a great great video that i give total recommendation to.",1147737600,,596,4.427272727272728
8066798,5,B0009UVCQM,"i thoroughly enjoyed Leisa Harts innovative and SEXY routine...i got my heart rate to the ideal level for me and i got a great feeling from my hubbie after doing this Buns workout for three weeks, he likes the way my bootie is firming up and i like the way its looking in the flesh...this is a really great and fun workout and not a chessy deal like carmen electras strip tease, this is a great workout, and all of the Sexy videos(Abs, Legs, Arms) are VERY VERY GOOD!",1146528000,,467,4.258426966292135
8066799,2,B0009UVCQM,"Let me premise this review by stating that I love Leisa Hart and her DVDs. I am used to getting either a solid cardio workout or solid sculpting workout from her, but this DVD delivered neither. If you're looking for some sexy stripper moves, then this is a good one, but if you want a workout, then skip it.",1146441600,4,308,4.237288135593221
8066800,5,B0009UVCQM,"unliek soem fitness dvds, this one has a pace that is quick enough that you can do all the routines without feeling lost, and Leisa hart instructs it thoroughly and gives cues in advance so you can follow along and get a great workout while burning thebootie fat...i loved this routine, the dvd is great!",1145750400,,304,4.545454545454546
8066801,1,B0009UVCQM,"I have been exercising (pilates & low impact cardio) regularlly (five days a week) for several months.  I wanted to purchase a few dvds that would target specific areas that we women deal with: buns, arms, and abs.  I have purchased two Leisa Hart dvds: Sexy Arms and Sexy Buns.  I love the Sexy Arms dvd but I really do not like the Sexy Buns dvd.  The exercises are quickly paced and very difficult to follow.  As soon as you figure out the exercise Leisa switches to a new exercise.  Each exercise is only done for 2-3 reps.  This is not enough reps to even warm up the buns, and definitely not enough to tone them.  Proof is in the workout: I was excited to recieve the dvd and thus did the entire work the first day.  I felt no burn and no soreness.  Although the filming is good, the background colorful, and instructor cheerful; the workout is disappointing. Use your money to buy an effective dvd. Sorry, I can't recommend one, I'm still looking.",1145491200,5,954,4.4
8066802,5,B0009UVCQM,"after having my third baby, i never thought i would say after 4 months after delivery that my butt would be as firm and tight as it is, and its all because i hvae been faithful to only following one instrucotr and leisa hart is the one, i loved her prego videos and have been loving her sexy series, every video is unique and makes me feel soooo good, i can't wait to do another, and my hubbie is loving the results with my body getting ready to go back to our high school reunion, buy all four of the sexy series dvds, they are all so different and well worth it, i really enjoyed them and continue to get great results.",1138320000,3,621,4.098360655737705
8066803,5,B0009UVCQM,"I use to love BUNS OF STEEL and some of the original fitness videos, but i took 6 year off and didn't exercise much,  well last year i started up again and found LEISA HART to be extremely good at leading safe and effective workouts. This BUNS workout is very very good. The moves firm up your tush and really lifts up those sagging cheeks! I could feel this workout for days, it was exceelent, and i have started to feel more sexy and look more sexy, what a great video!",1133740800,3,471,4.175824175824176
8066804,4,B0009UVCQM,"This dvd starts out with 'sexy' aerobics and then goes to butt shaping and toning movements.  In the warm up and in the actuall workout itself, there are plenty of sensual taps, hip circles and hip shaking.  It's a little weird at first and you might want to make sure no one is watching you or you'll either burst out laughing or stop the dvd.  The toning works your tush from every angle and position, with a variety or exercises and tempos, and then there are the usuall squats and lunges etc.  You'll need a chair too.  If you want, you can watch this with only the music rather than Leisas cuing (which she does well anyway).  Overall, this is a good workout that will shape you up a bit, but it's certainly not my absolute favourite.  She's motivating though.  Worth taking a look at - and do the routine too.",1133049600,5,815,4.3509933774834435
