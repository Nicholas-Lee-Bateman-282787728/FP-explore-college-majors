7800463,2,1618900196,"A great deal is made in this video about the Elves being immortal, and humans being mortal. As a matter of intellectual history the ever tendentious Joseph Pearce seems to miss that this dialectic between immortals and mortals is NOT a theme of Christian ideation --- for who pray tell would the immortals be in an earthly realm in Christian ideation?? ---- but rather just a hoary old trope of paganism. Reactionaries have often approved of pagan tropes when it serves their purposes to give things a mythic edge. And how in the world is Tolkien's Lord of the Rings described here in the official description as the  greatest work of literature in the 20th Century.??? Huh??
