4522913,5,B0051IAW6S,"I love this DVD! It is so powerful that sometimes we watch just one chapter and are impacted by the mystical nature of Syd's talks. Syd is again inviting us to ""step inside"" into a ""new world."" It's true! Listening to Syd speak about enhancing life on this DVD proves that I don't have to do a lot to find newness in my life. I am directed into my own wisdom through the feeling Syd shares about the essence of life. In a simple and sagacious manner, he shares that the principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought connect us all. Syd helps us find our way home. He points us to inside ourselves; there is no greater gift a human being can offer than to direct us to our true self. Not to be missed. You will love it!",1311033600,4,718,4.172661870503597

4522916,5,B0051IAW6S,"Viewing this video opens one up to their inner self and wisdom of the ages, if one is really ready.  Sydney Banks speaks so simply and elegantly to the answers of life we all seek and guides so gently and lovingly to the truth within each one of us, though the 3 Principles, Mind, Consciousness and Thought.  All you have to do is listen quietly, and get that beautiful feeling which guides you inside yourself and the understanding comes.  You do not have to figure it out, just listen beyond mind.  Its that simple.  No techniques.  The one thing, he says you must do, is leave  your mind behind to enter the spiritual reality and hear at another level of understanding.  He talks about thought, and how through thought and free will, each individual on earth has different experiences and beliefs.  He explains how mental health is just a thought away if we have the courage to drop thoughts of the hurtful past and live in the now.  Not only that, but he further talks about the Oneness and God and you get the feeling and understanding of us all being One spiritually, yet when we enter the physical reality as human being thru thought and free will and the ego, we have different realities of life.  Somehow when we are born we forget who we are and that's  the game of life.  He has broken through the mystery of the ages and delivers as best as one can with the mind the Ultimate Answer as this DVD is titled. Truth will always be a mystery, yet we can be aware and live in the Spiritual Reality here and now if we choose.  Sydney Banks is so clear in his teaching, ""go within yourself for the answer, not to anyone else for the answer to life"".  I am so grateful to have heard this wisdom and it has changed my life.  Thank you Sydney Banks.  Now it can change your life, for sure buy this DVD and share the earth shattering news about Thought and the Truth within each one of us.",1308528000,11,1889,4.3210227272727275

Her feeling level improved, changing from anxious to calm and peaceful.  I LOVE this video - will be watching and sharing it a lot.  - DoctorT - a general adult psychiatrist (MD) in private practice.",1307491200,4,314,4.654545454545454
4522918,5,B0051IAW6S,"This DVD allows you to experience the profound love, humor and wisdom of an enlightened being, as he shares the Three Principles uncovered at the moment of his enlightenment. It is a precious gift to the world; especially now that Mr. Banks is no longer with us in physical form. The feeling shared mysteriously quiets the mind, and guides one within, where all answers lie. This spiritual knowledge has already transformed thousands of lives; it is truly the hope for humanity.",1307404800,4,478,4.91358024691358
4522919,5,B0051IAW6S,"With humor and compassion Sydney Banks talks informally about 3 Principles that guide us to love, wisdom and a quiet mind. The audience consists of professionals in the field of mental health and speaks to a transformation in that field.  As a psychiatric nurse I cannot recommend it highly enough. And it will change the world you live in.",1307318400,6,340,4.762711864406779
8452772,1,B0051IAW6S,"I love Syd Banks. He was a good man who spent the decades after his enlightenment experience trying to get other people to see the truth. He wasn't in it for money, fame, or followers - he just wanted people to see what he saw because he knew it would change their lives. It changed my life.

This video, however, is not worth the money. It's a bit like buying a DVD entitled ""Everything you need to know about computers"", and they send you a 40 minute ad for a computer school.",1473811200,4,478,4.195652173913044

Which isn't easy to find, but there are four parts that I found there by googling. Looks like those are the originals from which this version was edited. It would be nice if more of his videos were available for downloading - in full. Cheers.",1437091200,3,366,4.397058823529412

8452781,1,B0051IAW6S,"The video is a complete waste of time for people who are not already familiar with the 3 principles.  Plus, even if you do know what he's talking about from prior knowledge of the subject, the video will not offer anything more.  The video shows Syd Banks speaking about how the 3 principles will change your life, but because the audience members are already devotees of his philosophy, he barely mentions what the 3 principles are!  Even though I like Syd Banks and I agree with his philosophy, the video was terrible and I would not recommend it to anyone.

If you are interested in this kind of philosophy, I would recommend Joe Bailey's book ""The Serenity Principle.""  Even though it was written for people in recovery from addiction, it applies to all people.  Joe's book explains his vision of Syd Banks' philosophy and principles very well.  Joe's book can and does change people's lives!",1345161600,13,896,4.741935483870968
