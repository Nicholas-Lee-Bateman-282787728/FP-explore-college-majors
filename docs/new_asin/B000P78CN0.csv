8189715,1,B000P78CN0,"As with the cover and the description of Volume 1 it leads you to believe that there are Aesop's Fables and it promises that the classic fables  will delight and educate your child. There are no such stories on this disc. They are the 1920s and 30s, black and white, silent cartoons (music and sound effects dubbed in). The heading for some of them is Aesop's Fables (songs) and the title of the cartoon is Circus Calamities (or some such). Others are headed Looney Toons and star Bosko and the other early characters. This is not what I wanted - or what I thought I purchased.",1224028800,,577,4.443396226415095
