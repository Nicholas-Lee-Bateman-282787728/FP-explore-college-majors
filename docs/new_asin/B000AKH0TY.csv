2389316,5,B000AKH0TY,"OK, guilty pleasure time.  Don't laugh, but long before she shaved her head and became some sort of icon/figurehead for the lesbian nation, Joan Jett chewed gum, kicked ass, and took names, trafficking in crunchy glam, Stones, and AC/DC-influenced wedges of star-spangled noise and uh, albums containing a lot of covers.  Granted, for the most part I've always been a sucker for a girl with an electric guitar, but Jett was the real deal, coming into her own long about the time of 1983's ""Album,"" despite hitting big a few years previous with ""I Love Rock N' Roll,"" armed with an arsenal of Les Paul Juniors, clad in tight black leather or spandex, Converse high-tops, long raven tresses and, oh those eyes - she was truly dazzling (sigh)...  Anyway, this double-disc collection gathers most of the ex-Runaway's videos, some concert clips and TV ads, as well as preview interview footage with dame Jett and musical partner Kenny Laguna.",1134432000,30,937,4.917721518987341

8078675,5,B000AKH0TY,"I'm a Joan Jett fan from her earliest Runaways LPs and I am glad to own this video collection. It is out of print and could be updated with some new interviews for re-release, but worthwhile for historical purposes.",1487721600,,215,4.538461538461538

8078681,5,B000AKH0TY,"This cool dvd is a must have for Joan Jett fans! It has the video's for songs like ''Bad reputation'', ''Do you wanna touch me?'', ''I love rock
N' roll'' and ''I hate myself for lovin' you''. It had all the video's of Joan Jett I've been looking for! Get it today!",1234137600,6,265,4.115384615384615
8078682,4,B000AKH0TY,"As any rocker knows, Joan Jett was the ORIGINAL ""Rock Chick"" and set the standards for all future fem rockers to follow in her wake. After leaving The Runaways (which also featured super rock chik Lita Ford)and forming the Blackhearts, Joan Jett carved out a niche that only she could stand in. There was literally no competition from ""Lite rock"" girl groups ala VIXEN. This 2 dvd set contains a mind staggering amount of videos that span her entire career. With Joan & Kenny introducting each vid and interspersing little anecdotes here and there, it's absolutely the definetive Joan Jett fan's dream. BUT, HERE'S THE FLAWED PART. Whereas the introductions and interviews sound and look fantastic, some of the videos themselves weren't remastered and look grainy and SOUND ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!  The vids for ""Do ya wanna touch me?"", Cherry Bomb, Everyday people, and many more sound as if you've covered your speakers with blankets! The sound is muffled and flat and the volume differences between clips is erratic from one clip to the next. as a J.J. fan, I can handle it, but would love a proper remaster that would LOOK and SOUND great enough to pump the stereo up to 10 and rock the neighbors! Unfortunately, when I pump the stereo up to 10, it sound like it's on 6. I would have given this 5 stars easily, but the sound quality belittles the fantastic content. REMASTER!!!!!!!SOON!!!!!! Otherwise, Joan Jett Rocks and this collection is amazing!",1234137600,9,1451,4.874493927125506
8078683,3,B000AKH0TY,"This is a pretty cool collection to have of Joan Jett on video, however it is marred by the fact whoever did the DVD programming of it didn't exactly create the menus in a universally functional manner.  Be forewarned that the menus may function only partially or not at all on your DVD player.  The first disc was unwatchable on my OPPO DV-980H because the menu didn't work at all and was only partially workable on my  Philips 5 disc player, but navigatable enough to view the vidoes.  There's no disclaimer about this limitation here; you won't find that unless you see it on the producer's website.  The technical issues aside, if it works on your player or you are content to watch the DVDs on your PC, this is a great collection of videos to be enterained by.  Joan Jett does seem pretty bored presenting each video in between though.

cheers",1201392000,6,848,4.5394736842105265
