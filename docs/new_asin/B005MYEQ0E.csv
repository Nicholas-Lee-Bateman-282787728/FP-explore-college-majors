4839573,5,B005MYEQ0E,"I wasn't totally in love with the show, but I'm an Usher fan. I feel like the Los Angeles show would have been more banging! I've been dying for Usher to release some sort of concert on Blu-ray. Really wish Confessions or 8701 would get put on Blu-ray. If you are a real Usher fan, this is a must have!",1325289600,,302,4.05

4839576,4,B005MYEQ0E,"The OMG tour did not come to my city and I'm a huge Usher fan so I thought this would be a good substitute.  The footage was good but I wasn't too fond of the song choices/lineup.  I've seen enough of this tour on YouTube to know he did a hot steamy number to ""Trading Places"" which was not included on the DVD.  Bummer.  Also being a huge fan and not familiar with the song ""Monster""  which the DVD opened with was a little off putting.  The dancers were fabulous as was the set and Usher himself.  The crowd seemed a little subdude to me and perhaps that is why Usher didn't seem as into it or as playful as usual.  He also kept it pretty clean, for which I was a little disappointed.  We all know Usher can move his hips and it wasn't enough thrusting for me, lol.  Despite of these little things, I enjoyed the DVD and would recommend it.",1323216000,9,842,4.110429447852761
4839577,5,B005MYEQ0E,"Being the fanatic that I am of Usher, I am probably not the best person to base your purchase desion on, But...... How can you not want to purchase this DVD? It was one of the hottest tours of the summer full of titillating dance routines and of course mind blowing vocals. I'm impressed with every new DVD of USher's and I'm quite sure you will be as well.... But don't take my word for it. Check it out!",1322179200,3,405,4.139240506329114

4839608,3,B005MYEQ0E,"Having been an Usher fan from when he was a kid ... and having purchased his Truth Tour Deluxe DVD ...

Just when I thought Usher couldn't do any better ... I was proven right!

I'm only giving this 3 stars and here's why:

1. The tour is in support of an album rife with euro-pop cliches. Yeah, I get it that this performance is in London so naturally Usher caters to the home crowd ... and in the process loses much of what made him special in the first place his mastery of R&B. But chasing money on the level Usher's on will do that.

2. Aside from the ""magic carpet"", this performance pales in comparison to The Truth"" tour. The dancers ... most of which look like euro runway rejects ... didn't dance with the same intensity as the Truth tour dancers. Maybe they weren't available.

I know Usher wants to keep things fresh and by courting the euro pop / EDM crowd ... he thinks he's growing as an artist.  But let's face it ... The Confessions album ... which the Truth tour was supporting ... may very well be his definitive work. I hope he doesn't spend the rest of his career trying to duplicate those sales numbers.

And while Usher shouldn't make every concert a rehash of the Truth tour ... until he produces another release comparable to Confessions his concerts should be informed by it.

This DVD on it's own merit is good but coming behind a superior predecessor the new material just doesn't captivate as well visually beyond the obvious gimmickry involved.",1401494400,,1474,4.4535315985130115
4839609,4,B005MYEQ0E,This is an incredible concert of an incredible performer. Here you can see how perfectionist Usher is and how dedicated to his job he is giving his all to his fans. The lighting is just amazing and he really can sing and dance!!!,1379635200,2,229,4.348837209302325
4839610,5,B005MYEQ0E,"Wonderful concert DVD . Can't stop watching it. Must have, great for parties. I also ordered his 8701 live DVD.",1379462400,,111,4.6
4839611,1,B005MYEQ0E,"Music had no emotion, lyrics barely understandable unless you're a true usher fan and the whole concert seemed like one long song... Hard sitting through it all.",1375747200,,161,5.0
4839612,5,B005MYEQ0E,"This was such a great concert, Usher looks amazing, mature, very hot ... Especially during ""Hot Tottie""
High energy throughout !!!
Great Songs! Many fave's like ""You remind me"".
I also love the simplicity of ""There Goes My Baby""... It's just Usher on stage & you feel like he's singing directly to you! His voice is oh so heavenly during this number.
I recommend ""OMG TOUR LIVE FROM LONDON""for not just ""Ursher baby "" fans, but for everyone! You'll become a fan after watching, guaranteed!!
Enjoy",1371427200,2,496,4.77906976744186

4839614,3,B005MYEQ0E,"My girl friend lloves this CD and plays it at least once weekly.  I'm not that much of an usher fan but parts of it were entertaining and parts were repetitive.  I knw Usher is a MJ devotee, but his choregraphy and ""attempt"" to creat MJ dance moves fall short.",1363910400,,260,4.18
4839615,5,B005MYEQ0E,It's what I wanted to watch!. This concert contains most of the greatest hits hat Usher has performed through the years.,1358208000,,120,4.761904761904762

(maybe for my daughter) But I watch it like four times, with family and friends. This is what a show suppose to be, just plain entertaining!! They spared no expense on this show and a LOT OF HARD WORK. I am now a true fan of Usher's live proformances, I now see why they sell his tickets for a 100 bucks!",1346544000,,404,4.0625

4839631,5,B005MYEQ0E,"I totally LOVE Usher AND I saw this concert when it was in the states. Once I received it, I watched it right away. I gave it 5 stars as far as picture quality, but BE WARNED: make sure you choose the 5.1 sound under the options menu when playing it. If you don't, it will sound like garbage!!! I thought there was a serious defect with the Blu-Ray until I figured this out! Otherwise, it broght me right back to being at the concert!!!",1339632000,,436,4.141176470588236

4839636,5,B005MYEQ0E,No suprise. A great DVD by one of music's best stars of the last 15 years.(EVEN THOUGH HE HAS BEEN IN THE INDUSTRY SINCE 93) The perfromances are great and the songs make you want to play your Usher cd's right after. He did a professional top of the line show you do not get from all R&B and POP stars.,1327104000,4,302,3.9672131147540983
4839637,4,B005MYEQ0E,"This is Usher's fourth live DVD concert to be released I believe. Of the last three, I believe this is my least favorite. It is good though. It just seems rushed...and Usher just seems to be more than a little bored. It could just be the way it was recorded, I'm not sure. He's doing his thing though, and the dancers and musicians are certainly on point. Usher didn't seem to relate to the audience too much this time out.  Maybe it was editing, I'm not sure, but for me it's an important part of any show. You want the audience to at least believe you're having a good time doing what you're doing!... I don't think the London show was a good show to record. The crowd seemed a bit tame to me. Stateside would have been much better I believe... The entrance was hott! U really don't get to see how really good this is until you look at the DVD extras! It's great. The song selection, staging, dancing, and costumes are all excellent as well. It was well worth the $11.99 I paid for it(I thought that was cheap!). I own a lot of concert DVDs. This one ranks somewhere in the middle. So go out and get, it's great!",1326931200,,1114,4.230046948356808

Although he patterns himself after the greatest POP singer of all time, Michael Jackson, he has his own style and spins .  His vocals are not as strong as Michael's was as he performs but he is without question a talented performer worth recognition on his own merits.  I recommend this be added to your collection.  In my case, I'm just starting one.",1430006400,3,451,4.518518518518518
