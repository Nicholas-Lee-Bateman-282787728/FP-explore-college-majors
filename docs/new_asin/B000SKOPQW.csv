The team of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera (both of late) went into the venture to give the duo's fans something more to like. Bud Abbott voiced these cartoons himself, although Stan Erwin was the voice of his late partner, but he still put on a convincing show. These are extremely hard-to-find cartoons (why are these not out on DVD?)and this VHS is the only available alternative (try to make sure your VCR doesn't devour it).
