2647919,5,B000HXDENA,"This film is beautifully realized.  The history of these dancers and how much they've contributed individually and collectively is a joy to behold.  It should be required viewing for anyone interested in being an entertainer or being entertained. Dancing has kept these beautiful women vital, joyous and alive. Peggy Lee said it all when she sang ""........if that's all there is my friend , then lets keep dancing........."".",1247356800,,424,5.220588235294118
2647920,5,B000HXDENA,This DVD provides a great lesson in African American history.  It is also inspiring and entertaining.  The spirits of these women are phenomenal.  We can all learn from their endurance.  Highly recommended for all age groups.  Great family entertainment.,1215993600,,254,5.410256410256411
2647921,4,B000HXDENA,"BEEN RICH ALL MY LIFE is the story of five women who ranged in age from 84-96 at the time of filming.  These ladies were chorus girls at the storied Harlem nightclubs such as The Savoy, Cotton Club and Apollo Theater during their heyday in the 1930's and 40s.  Despite their advanced ages the women perform together as a group known as ""The Silver Belles"" and retain their senses of humor, love for performing and zest for life.  The film lets us experience the decline and eventual demise of Bertye Lou, the oldest and perhaps sassiest of the group, and celebrate her life with her friends at a lively wake.  We also see first hand the universal realities of old age all the women are realizing.  Some history of Harlem and African American struggles in the 20th century are taught along the way but the former chorus girls and their personal lives remain the central theme.  The movie is a bit unfocused at times but is still an inspirational story of the need to embrace life no matter what your current age or circumstance.",1211673600,7,1027,4.554347826086956

2647923,4,B000HXDENA,"I love tap dance and used to do it myself, so this documentary really resonated with me. Loved seeing the old photos of the women as young dancers at the Cotton Club...and seeing them still hoofing into their 80's. It was very heart warming. I wish there were more old footage, and a little less of them riding the bus and hailing cabs. But overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and recommend it to anyone who loves dance.

Don't miss the dance lesson--learn the Shim Sham Shimmy!",1169856000,5,481,4.528735632183908
2647924,5,B000HXDENA,"Energizing and encouraging!  Wonderful peek into the history of tap and how great to keep going no matter how old one gets.  I look at this over and over again.  These black women dancers had to put up with a lot, but they are not dwelling on how hard it was.  They are continuing on and teaching all of us about the wonders and joys of tap dancing. Even the spiciness is done with class.",1168819200,7,388,4.133333333333334
2647925,5,B000HXDENA,"This film is a wonderful depiction of Harlem, USA.  For those of us who grew up in Harlem and Washington Heights in the 1930's, 40's and 50's, it is an exciting and wonderful story and brings back fond memories of an era gone by.",1165104000,,229,4.204545454545454
2647926,5,B000HXDENA,"I saw this film in a premier showing with the film maker and three of the Silver Belles present.  The film was most entertaining and touching as you journey back in time with these wonderful, fiesty women.  Their lives have been filled with struggles, triumphs and finally, well deserved recongnition.  The audience laughed at their wit and marvelled at the story of their lives.  They started their careers as very young women who were given a shot at show business in the 1930's in the hot spots of Harlem during it's Golden Age.  The Cotton Club and the Apollo Theatre were their homes for many years.  All of them give great credit to those who taught them 'the ropes'. They are still busy performing and passing along the heart of dance to the young dancers who are coming up today.  I felt privileged to be taken on their journey and found myself, along with the rest of the audience, laughing at their tales of the old days and being touched with sadness at their losses and struggles.  Better than being called 'survivors' they can be called triumphant and heroic.  The sound track was wonderful and had everyone's feet tapping along.  If you like dance, music, history, biography, show business or just a great story, I think you will thoroughly enjoy this film.",1161388800,15,1271,4.684684684684685
2647996,5,B000HXDENA,"My stepmom who passed in 2005 told me about these ladies and I was fortunate to see them briefly in person in Harlem.  While browsing Amazon Prime, I decided to watch this because I wanted to see more.  The next thing I know I was crying like crazy because to my surprise while watching this, the camera scrolled the audience.  ""My Stepmom was in the audience.  How could this be?  At first I saw what appeared to be her and I let it go that she was just on my mind.  As I continued to watch, again I saw someone that looked so much like her, I did a rewind.  Too my amazement, it was in fact my Stepmom in the audience with friends smiling and enjoying the performance.  What are the chances to get such a jewel of a present.  Now I must try and purchase this for enjoyment, memories and to enjoy it again this time with my stepmom.  Thank you universe.",1467072000,,854,4.152439024390244
2647997,5,B000HXDENA,What a fun look back at the dancers from the Cotton Club in the 1930's. These ladies were fantastic dancers in their youth and as older women.

2648048,5,B000HXDENA,"Viewed this on Amazon Prime. Whoever came up with the idea of producing this I take my hat off to you. Because several other reviews have already summarized the film I won't. It was interesting hearing about the lives of those that are taken for granted in the background. These beautiful, brave African American women went on strike, in the 1930s, at the Cotton Club to get better pay and less (reasonable) work hours. Their successful strike benefited others more so than themselves, but they still remained the dignified ladies that they were. I hope that at 80+ I can still shake a leg as well as they did. I plan to buy a copy for myself, my mom and possibly my aunts for Christmas.",1442102400,,687,4.504

2648079,5,B000HXDENA,"Saw it on Netflix, loved it, and bought it. Here's the review I wrote on Netflix for it: You will fall in love with these senior citizen dancers. They are too loveable for words, as old folks tend to be who have lived life comprehensively and have much to share with you. The filmmakers let the dancers tell their stories and stayed out of the way. See the special features as well as the film itself. A wonderful and poignant film about triumph, tragedy, and triumph again.",1388275200,,474,4.459770114942529

2648082,5,B000HXDENA,"Been Rich All My Life is a touching, sweet and moving documentary that looks at The Silver Belles, a group of elderly women who danced in many famous Harlem nightclubs primarily during the 1930s. They were not shabby when they performed at The Savoy, The Cotton Club and The Apollo Theater with Cab Calloway, Jimmie Lunceford and Duke Ellington; and they still wow the audiences in this film! Their story moves along at a good pace; I was fascinated by what I saw and I cheered these ladies on as they put on their tap shoes and danced up a storm! I easily became attached to these fine people and I was sad to see some of them having to cope with difficulties associated with old age. The choreography and cinematography are fantastic; and the interviews with people like the current owner of The Cotton Club add color to their story. There are excellent black and white video clips; and the still photos are wonderful. In addition, the musical score enhances the film.

The five Silver Belles consist of Bertye Lou, Cleo, Elaine; Fay and Marion. Their manager, Geri Kennedy, protects them fiercely--as if they needed it! Geri admits that they essentially ""manage themselves"" but as they are aging I think it's great that a younger woman is looking out for them.

While it's terrific to see them triumph on the stage whenever they dance, it's sad to see them having to deal with life's struggles and especially some of the health issues associated with the aging process. After all, these ladies were between the ages of 84 and 96 when this was filmed! No longer dancing because she's afraid of falling, Bertye Lou refers to herself as ""the orchestra"" and her sister troopers still love her and cherish her as one of the group.

It's hard to say too much more of what happens without spoiling it for you; suffice it to say that troubles set in when Bertye Lou has to go to the hospital, Cleo falls and breaks her knee and her arm and Marion requires a pacemaker. I shed a few tears as I saw them fighting to stay alive and become well again.

The DVD comes with some bonus features. I especially liked the interview with Director Heather MacDonald (it includes bonus scenes) and the featurette entitled ""Dance Class: Learn the Shim Sham Shimmy."" If only I could dance like that!

Been Rich All My Life is one of those rare documentaries that truly move me. People interested in the history of Harlem night clubs and heartfelt, social-cultural documentaries from an African-American perspective will not be disappointed. People interested in dance should also get this film.",1355961600,2,2574,4.698447893569845
2648083,5,B000HXDENA,"I loved this documentary about the Silver Belles.  I had heard about this troupe, but knew very little them collectively and individually. All members were over 80 youthful years of age and loved to dance.  They were determined and traveled to meet as a dance troupe to teach, inspire and pass on dance steps.  I felt fortunate watching this documentary.  It was as if I was between eras and had the opportunity to watch women pioneers that interacted with other great artists and experienced racism and sexism  It was great that they participated in the development and formation of the Artist Guild (I believe that is the correct name), which impacted their pay in the 1930's & 1940's following their strikes.

I felt so attached to the character and had to Google to see who was still alive. I have to confirm and research more, but it appears that Cleo Hayes is the only one I could find that appears to still be alive.

Excellent documentary... quite entertaining, educational and touching!",1346457600,,995,4.783625730994152
2648084,5,B000HXDENA,"BEEN RICH ALL MY LIFE is wonderful documentary featuring the 'Silver Belles', five former showgirls who once performed in chorus lines at the famed Apollo Theater, the Cotton Club, Connie's Inn, the Savoy Ballroom, and Small's Paradise during Harlem's golden era of entertainment.  Following a hiatus of four long decades,  these five former chorus dancers are brought together again to do what they love best.  They dance!  Featured are Bertye Lou Wood, Cleo Hayes, Marion Coles, Fay Ray and Elaine Ellis performing their famous dance steps with glitz, style, and glamor to sold-out audiences.

Even though `Been Rich All My Life' is not a high budget documentary, it is an exemplary film because it is a well executed parallel story.  This makes it an excellent film for two reasons.  First, the narrative of the story is told in the voice of the women themselves.  Each speak with candor and reflection; all fascinating personalities expressing their life story beginning with their early days as children to their days as young struggling teens fired by determination and circumstance to emerge as celebrated chorus girls who would performed at historic clubs during the heyday of the Harlem Renaissance.

Second, the story of these remarkable women speaks to the inescapable challenges of aging. Yet, in the personal narratives of these women one is struck by their determination and courage;  notably, the will and spirit of the human heart to triumph no matter the obstacles.  In this regard, the story of the 'Silver Belles' shatters the notion that mid-life and `old age' dooms us to sedentary lifestyles, robbing us from physical activities and careers we once loved; careers that required physical rigor and endurance.  Thus, it is precisely the testament of these courageous and talented women who teach us the true meaning of being `young at heart', and to pursue whatever your dream or talent despite the physical limitations which come with aging.  It is this lesson which resonates with those at midlife,  but it is also a universal message about courage and hope for all who suffer physical challenges and disabilities.

Well directed, `Been Rich All My Life' has historic archival footage of Harlem's neighborhoods and prestigious nightclubs during the 20's and 30's, including film clips of the famed glamorous showgirls who danced and performed on stage and in films.  At the time of filming this documentary, these former chorus dancers now aged 84-96, welcome us into their early life history as they talk passionately about their love of dancing, but also about the struggles and challenges they incurred as underpaid, overworked showgirls where competition was fierce.  They speak of exciting traveling tours to South America where they were treated 'royally', yet their difficulty coping with racism at home despite their patriotism performing to US servicemen during WWII.  And almost poetically, they speak about their personal lives; the men they loved, and the families they raised.

These amazing stories begin with the eldest 'Silver Belle', Bertyle Lou Wood, age 96 who began dancing in the late 20's with the famed Bill `Bojangles Robinson, and later on performed with  legendary band leaders like Cab Calloway, Jimmie Lunceford and Duke Ellington.  Feisty, sassy, and loveable, she explains that when she was approached about the idea that there was an interest of putting together a dance troupe of former Harlem chorus girls she was thrilled.  Thus, the formation of `The Silver Belles' was born in 1985.  Under the watchful and devoted care of their manager, Geri Kennedy these senior women braved tiring rehearsals, long commutes, aches and pains, and other personal setbacks for the enjoyment and thrill to kick up their heels and move their feet to their favorite dance steps, joyously performing once again to audiences who adore them.  Their vitality and natural talent as they dance shows in their beaming faces.  And it is especially touching to see how much they love and care  for their audience as they bask in the standing ovations they so deservingly earn.

This great documentary is well balanced with serious topics, yet also spiced with humor, music, and lots of laughter.  We also learn fascinating personal stories and tidbits of information about famous jazz celebrities they worked with; stories such as the time the chorus girls `chipped in' to purchase a young Ella Fitzgerald her first gown.  Foremost, at the core of this extraordinary story of the 'Silver Belles' is the strong friendship bond among these talented women who once again share a love for dance by performing during the golden age of their lives.

BEEN RICH ALL MY LIFE is a testament to the history of African American showgirls, their legacy and influence on the culture and tradition of chorus dance and jazz, and its inspirational significance to aspiring talented young dancers of today.

But only a truly gifted documentarian could have made Been Rich All My Life.  What Heather MacDonald has done is to fashion an exquisite film about five stunning, powerhouse women who danced in the chorus line at Harlem's Apollo Theater (striking for better conditions and establishing a union along the way) and other NY ballrooms and theaters in the '30s and '40s and now, thanks to MacDonald, will dance forever.  Unlike some annoyingly omnipresent directors, MacDonald allows the films subjects, these glorious high-stepping women, to tell and show and dance their own individual and collective stories.  Been Rich All My Life is a lively and terrifically moving film, a celebration of a certain kind of riches money can't buy.  I'm so glad YOU will now have the opportunity to enjoy this film on Vimeo.
