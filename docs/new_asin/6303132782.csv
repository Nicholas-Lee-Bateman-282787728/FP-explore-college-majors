568326,5,6303132782,"There is a virtual treasures chest of unusual films that were released in the late sixties/early seventies that are beyond categorization such as Director Richard Wilson's 'THREE IN THE ATTIC '- 1968 and Director Philip Gilbert's excellently underrated 'BLOOD AND LACE'-1971. Synapse Films has filled a bit of that gap with this excellent Blu-Ray release of Director Ted Post's production of 'THE BABY'-1973, a low budget example of how to get a great ensemble cast of three underrated actresses Anjanette Comer, Mariana Hill, and veteran Ruth Roman working their mojo on a great script by Abe Polsky under Post's subtle direction to come up with this unsettling, gripping affair of child abuse and fetishistic imaginings.  You'll also spot exploitation actor Michael Pataki as a sleazy party guest.  Released over a decade ago on DVD in a dark,full screen transfer by Image Entertainment, Synapse has cleaned up the negative and released it in its proper 1.78 ratio unchaining it from its TV movie of the week look and presenting it with the transfer it always
deserved.  Extras include two separate telephone discussions with Director Ted Post and Actor David Manzy (the baby of the movie) discussing the casting and highlights of the shoot and an original theatrical trailer.  For those who seek the unusual in film, this gem is for you and deserves a better reputation than it has.  Hopefully this Blu-Ray will take care of that pronto.

568327,1,6303132782,"My sister and her life partner have ""date night Thursdays"". That is when they leave their kids with me to watch. Usually, they go to a ""water sports club"" at someone's house. It's never at the same location, but they are always good enough to leave me contact information in case of an emergency. Since I do all the laundry in the house, I have never seen any swimsuits or beach towls that most people take to the pool, lake or ocean. I have been unable to figure out why they would attend a club like that with no known necessary equipment or apparel.
I saw this movie in the kid's movie section on the five dollar shelf at a big box (it has a big red circle with a smaller one inside it) store that I cannot mention here. Although a bit dark, I thought that the kids would enjoy what looked to be a comedy.
After putting in the movie, my flip cell phone rang and I had to leave the room with the kids in it for a call with my boss. Our weekly sales teleconference for our multi-level phone card  business is usually scehduled around the same time. I locked the door behind me to keep the kids contained. They had plenty of food and a restroom right next to it in case they needed it they could just knock and I would quietly let them out.
A couple hours later, I figured the kids were finishing up the movie so I discreetly checked in on them.
What I found was quite unexpected.
Due to a gag order by the court, I have to spare you the details as I am still undergoing (what I consider unnecessary, but they still insist) an invesitgation with various state and federal authorities.

Yeah, I just wrote that. You'll think the social worker is a weird but helpful person until bloodthirsty psychopathology kicks into full throttle and you realize you're just out of reach of one of cinema's most demented villains.

We have a grown man that lives as a baby, his demented mother played by a very convincing ""Ruth Roman"" and two psychotic sisters that live in a creepy house.""Baby"" who has no name only the title of ""Baby"".When the story the story begins Baby has to have a care taker come and visit periodically by law and she has mysteriously disappeared. They don't elaborate on this nor do they really use it in the script except to mention it.

So they need a new care taker for baby and right away the new caretaker thinks something fishy is going on.
So she gets nosy and demanding which disturbs the family greatly.

568363,3,6303132782,"Featuring a diaper wearing adult male, with the mind of an infant, The Baby (1973) is a psychological thriller, where it is clear from the start, that something quite sick and weird is occurring.  Some absurd and over the top elements, make for a story that holds your interest, as you wait for the rug to be jerked out from underneath.

Social worker Ann Gentry (Anjanette Comer) is assigned to a case involving Mrs. Wadsworth (Ruth Roman) and her family.  The youngest member is a mentally impaired adult male, known only as Baby (David Manzy (Mooney)), who wears a diaper, crawls on all fours, sleeps in a crib, and mumbles like an infant.  In need of constant care, Mrs. Wardsworth sees to her sons needs, with the help of her two daughters Germaine (Marianna Hill), and Alba (Suzanne Zenor).

Gentry takes an overactive interest in her new charge, and eventually tries to take Baby out of his home, causing the Wadsworth family to entertain thoughts of homicide.  Things appear bleak for the dedicated social worker, as violence erupts, in the films brutal, and unexpected conclusion.

With some perverted and sick aspects, The Baby is a fun slice of 70s horror, with an over the top finish that you might not see coming.  Veteran Ted Post (,) provides some solid direction, and with Ruth Roman and Anjanette Comer leading the way, the acting performances are generally good, although David Manzys portrayal isn't always convincing.",1388448000,3,1437,4.88477366255144

568367,3,6303132782,"The Baby (Ted Post, 1973)

Veteran TV director Ted Post (Hang 'em High, Good Guys Wear Black) and screenwriter Abe Polsky (The Rebel Rousers) turned in this 1973 gem, one of the few movies I have ever seen that I can truly say defies description. IMDB lists it as a horror/thriller; it is that, but only for about ten minutes of its length. Pieces of it are melodrama, absurdist comedy, even a minor dose of courtroom thriller. But the one overarching genre that defines the whole film, were such a genre to exist, would simply be ""weird"". This is an unforgettable, if low-budget and amateurish, movie.

Plot: the Wadsworth family--mom (Strangers on a Train's Ruth Roman), sisters Germaine and Alba (High Plains Drifter's Marianna Hill and The Way We Were's Susanne Zenor, respectively), and Baby (Chaplin's David Mooney), are recipients of social assistance because Baby is, in some way, mentally defective. Their old social worker leaves the case, for reasons we are never given, and Ann Gentry (The Loved One's Anjanette Comer) takes over. She immediately takes a liking to Baby--who's actually twenty-one years old, though does not walk or talk, sleeps in an adult-sized crib, and wears diapers--and quickly becomes convinced that, far from being a medical problem, Baby is being kept in this state through the family's negative reinforcement. She beings to wage a war against them to get custody of Baby, but soon finds out the Wadsworths are very accustomed to playing dirty when it comes to fighting the state...

The movie, which has faded into obscurity over the decades, is mostly remembered now for its twist ending; in fact, when we got to it (while it's perfectly set up, I gotta say I never saw it coming despite the rest of this sentence), I got the feeling I'd seen the movie before, despite being almost positive I haven't; either it's been copied somewhere or I've read about it in the past. I'd read online about the movie's big twist ending while watching it, and so I knew something was coming, but... wow. That was perfect. One of the best Big Twist endings of all time, right up there with The Usual Suspects and the original Ocean's Eleven.

Unfortunately, much of the rest of the film doesn't match it. There are a number of times during the film, most notably during Baby's birthday party, where Polsky seemed content to go for shock-for-shock's-sake. (Consider the character of Dennis, who spends the entire party sniffing after Alba like a hound in heat--even after she, oh, requests he hold his finger over an open flame for a full minute in exchange for sex.)  The acting, in general is wooden, this despite Post having landed some of Hollywood's solid B-list talent. Having recently seen Good Guys Wear Black, though, I feel quite comfortable putting the crappy acting down to Post's directorial (lack of) skill. The outdoor lighting is washy, though that could easily be a problem with the DVD transfer, and the indoor lighting is often murky. The pacing of the first seventy minutes of this eighty-nine minute movie are confusing at best. In other words, there are a whole lotta problems with this movie...and I'm going to tell you to ignore every last one of them and watch it, because that ending is such a killer. Trust me on this. ***",1359590400,,3271,4.823529411764706
568388,3,6303132782,"I recently caught this film on Turner Classic Movies' ""TCM Underground"" on a late Friday night.

Wow.  As you watch it, you'll wonder how to respond to it.  Some scenes are so bizarre and ridiculous that part of you wants to laugh.  But the performances are so serious and earnest that you feel guilty for wanting to laugh.  The whole movie plays that way: dark and sinister while crazy and absurd.

Playing it straight, the mostly-female cast gives you all kinds of female nuttiness: vindictiveness, bitterness, jealousy, sexual frustration, rage.  And the victim is a young man reduced to diapers and child-like screeches.  The actresses are all very good and do a great job of making their crazy parent, sibling or lover roles believable.

But unlike a lot of drive-in, grindhouse exploitation films, THE BABY not only comes up with a freaky storyline, it knows where it's going with it.  So your first impression in the early part of the film is merely a set-up.

They know where they're going, and it's going to be disturbing.",1358640000,,1031,4.801136363636363
568389,5,6303132782,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie,was it a horror film or a dark comedy or what? After watching the film I have to say it was more like a somewhat twisted Night Gallery type film. The actors were all pretty good,the mother played by Ruth Roman was very good,smoking cigarettes with a raspy smokers voice and the smokers cough. The hair on one of the daughters was pure 70's big hair,you have to see it to believe it. The story was a little strange but for some reason I didn't think it was too far out. Well maybe a little out there. The copy of the movie I have has a very good picture,some people complained their copies looked faded. The movie is a better movie than I thought it would be the dvd has a good quality picture I guess that's as good as it gets nowadays.",1343692800,,781,4.178807947019868
568390,4,6303132782,"Now and then you get a movie that is so far out of left field, you need to view/review it on its own terms. This might be one of those movies.

Here's the scoop. A social worker, whose architect husband ""had an accident"", starts working a case where a mom and her two adult daughters take care of their ""baby"" who is actually an adult male who sleeps in a crib, doesn't have a name, wears diapers and seemingly hasn't progressed mentally past the age of an infant. Is this the case or is there a reason mom wants to keep him in the infant state? And why did the social worker volunteer for the gig? Is she as altruistic as she appears?

This is one weird flick with more than a couple disturbing elements. Mom rules the house and all in it. She's going to see to it that Baby isn't going anywhere. The one daughter is getting sexual gratification from Baby and they throw parties where drinking and drugs abound. The script and dialogue are better than you might expect. I was anticipating real trash but the producers/director tried to work the story straight up. The music, production values and directing were all decent. The plot progressed in a manner that was logical to its basic outline (as weird as it is). There were a couple of points in the story that didn't cut it and I saw the end coming pretty far off but this is till better than it should have been given the premise.

If you're into weird. This should do ya.",1331769600,3,1427,4.337078651685394
568391,3,6303132782,"""The Baby"" has been one of my favorite films of the '70s ever since I first saw it nearly 30 years ago back in the early days of VHS rentals. It is strange, perverse, hilarious, sickening and heartbreaking all at once, and really defies classification. Not quite a horror film, not quite exploitation, nor a full-fledged social drama, ""The Baby"" plays like a demented mix of ABC Afterschool Special with a touch of grindhouse cinema thrown in.

Ruth Roman is an indomitable force as Mrs. Wadsworth, a bitter, chain-smoking harridan who lives with her two grown daughters Germaine (Mariana Hill) and Alba (Suzanne Zenor). Together these three partake in the care and feeding of Baby--a twenty-something man who exists in an infantilized state, his world consisting of diapers, bottles and life in a playpen. Concerned social worker Ann Gentry (Anjanette Comer) arrives on the scene to investigate and quickly becomes obsessed with giving Baby a chance to live up to his potential. Things escalate until the story becomes a struggle of wills between Ann and the Wadsworths over Baby's welfare, which results in kidnapping and murder!

The story may be somewhat slow-moving for those born after 1980 who are used to non-stop action and excessive editing in their films, but for those who appreciate ""old-school"" technique and character development, stick it out because the payoff is HUGE. I am somewhat jaded but even I didn't see the twist coming (I won't reveal it here and spoil it for first-timers).

The two lead actresses really play well off each other (the interview with director Ted Post found among the bonus features hints that Roman may have purposely caused some friction so that the tension between Ann and Mrs. W would be amplified onscreen) and the film transcends its limited budget. The sorrowful cello score is wonderful throughout, especially heartbreaking during the scene when Comer looks at old vacation slides of she and her husband.

The best scenes involve over-the-top abuse as when Alba uses a cattle prod to discipline Baby, and when the women return home to find the babysitter suckling Baby in the nursery (Roman is scary as all-out brandishing that whipping-rope).

Five stars for the movie itself based on originality, entertainment value, and performances.

The new 2011 release from Severin Films however is a whole other story. I already owned a discontinued full-frame release from Image Entertainment that was put out about 10 years ago and was eager to own a remastered version so I purchased the new release. While the specks and blemishes have all been removed from the picture, the entire film looks desaturated. It's as though they used a beige filter on everything and the colors are not strong or vibrant at all. I immediately compared the two and the colors are much brighter and vivid on the old release. **NOTE** I posted two comparative screen grabs in the images section of this product. Judge for yourself. Also, since the film wasn't originally created in widescreen, they have cropped off part of the picture for this release. I am glad I didn't sell my old copy because if I had to choose, I'd rather watch it in fullscreen with some dirt and specks rather than a faded, washed out print.

There are two short audio interviews with director Ted Post and with David Manzy Mooney (who played Baby).

If you have never seen this before and love weird, offbeat '70s flicks, by all means get it. If you already own the Image version, be warned this one looks washed out.",1312675200,26,3518,4.910774410774411

After the few minutes, we've already witnessed a grown man gooing like an infant, a babysitter who feels compelled to nurse him, who then gets beat to death for her trouble, and a pair of sisters who use him for their own purposes. By then, it's clear there's no social commentary here, only crazy.

568451,3,6303132782,"""The Baby"" (1973) was another of those films the Army and Air Force Exchange Service saw fit to inflict on us overseas troops shortly after its less than spectacular stateside box office performance. It actually was quite a hit with our crowd, most of us were there to see Marianna Hill (who we remembered as the all-time most beautiful of the ""Star Trek"" series guest stars and who we saw in another AAFES film ""The Traveling Executioner"") and ""The Loved One's"" Aimee Thanatogenous a/k/a Anganette Comer.

Sure David Manzy's portrayal of the title character provides great mockfest material but the film itself is a solid psychological thriller. Note that this is not a horror film although it has a few mild horror elements toward the end. It is what you would expect had Russ Meyer (""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" 1965) produced and directed a remake of ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" (1962).

Ruth Roman, a minor glamor queen 20-25 years earlier: ""Jungle Queen"" (1945) and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"" (1951), gets the Bette Davis part and Miss Thanatogenous takes Joan Crawford's role. And Ted Post (director) and Abe Polsky (writer) insert a lot of misdirection devices so that the viewer identifies with and takes the point of view of what turns out to be a less than sympathetic character.

Social worker Ann Gentry (Comer) requests she be assigned the case of the developmentally disabled title character, the adult son of Mrs. Wadsworth (Roman). Baby cannot walk or do much talking but apparently is adept at servicing women; at least a babysitter and his half sister Germaine (Hill). This is a female empowerment fantasy situation worthy of Meyer's imagination. There are hints that Ann also wants in on this action.

Most of the story is told from the point-of-view of Comer, who must have been pretty creepy in real life, and you get to see what Wednesday Addams would have been like if she had grown up and gone into the social work vocation. The best element of the story comes late in the film when the POV switches over to Mrs. Wadsworth.

There is a lot of over-wrought melodrama (this is definitely not Hitchcock) and a rather depressing aging hipster party, but the worst scenes are those involving the title character; as he bawls, crawls, messily eats food, and is taught to fetch like a dog. It's a major testament to the discipline of their cast that they were able to do these mega-silly scenes with a straight face. It's all pretty disgusting and politically incorrect (including sequences of what appear to be actual disabled children) which might be what kept cast and crew from messing up the audio with their laughter.

This film will probably not impress horror fans but it manages to generate a fair amount of suspense, Hill looks gorgeous, and it works nicely as a twisted moral ambiguity piece like ""Baby Jane""",1237420800,2,2860,4.850409836065574

568453,4,6303132782,"This might be one of my all-time fave camp movies, and is also one that leaves me disturbed after watching it.  Lovely Anjanette Comer is a social worker who seeks out the assignment of looking into a family of 3 women who are raising an adult man who still functions as a baby.  Turns out the women - a violent mother and her two deranged daughters - don't seem to want the ""baby"" to learn how to walk and talk.  At the same time, one of the sisters doesn't mind slipping into his crib at night . . . The mother is played by Ruth Roman, who played a beautiful and feminine socialite in Hitchcok's Strangers on a Train; here, she is a seedy, chain-smoking, trash-talking old gal in a role that could have been played by a latter-day Shelley Winters.  One of the daughters has a hairstyle that looks like it could have been part of a horror movie get-up, and the other one is a characters who likes to punish her brother by shocking him with some kind of electric prod, and who will only let her boyfriend kiss her if he lets her hold a lighter flame to his hand first.  So, yeah, a really sick family - and then there's the ""baby,"" a grown man in a crib.  When the movie gets really warped is when you realize that the one ""sane"" person here, the social worker, might actually be a little off herself, and seems to have some unusual interest in the ""baby.""

Some of the bad points of the movie were: The grown man (who actually looks a little like Keith Moon in his later years) acting like a baby was pretty lame. On top of that, there were no cool sets or visuals. The acting was horrible (and not in a good, campy way). The dialogue and conversations were drawn out, boring, and annoyingly hard to hear.

This eerie little number is to cinema what Ed Gein is to psychopathology; it's the equivalent of dancing around on your property wearing a mask made out of bacon and singing Debbie Boone songs, or papering every wall in your house with pictures of Uncle Fester. Yes, ""The Baby"" is that offbeat, weird, whatever label you want to stick on it that translates as ""strange."" After watching the final credits roll, I pondered what I had just witnessed. The only explanation that seemed to fit is that Post and the other people associated with this film took the brown blotter at Woodstock. I think it is safe to say that this movie never had a chance of getting a coveted Oscar nomination or any other significant award. The only place that might see fit to recognize this film would be an insane asylum.
As ""The Baby"" starts, we learn that social worker Ann Gentry (Anjanette Comer) has decided to accept one of the strangest assignments of her career. She will begin visiting the Wadsworth residence a few times a week in order to monitor that family's treatment of their infant son. The clan consists of the husky voiced, chain-smoking mother (played with a nod and a wink by an aging Ruth Roman), two gorgeous yet snotty sisters named Alba and Germaine, and Baby. Nothing too odd here, except Baby is actually a full grown man who cannot speak, walk, or take care of himself. Baby spends most of his time in a playpen in the house or in a crib out on the lawn where he gurgles and gasps to himself and his family. Neither the mother or the sisters care much for Baby but they have to go through the motions if they want to keep those state aid checks coming in. The entire family tolerates Ann with barely contained disdain, grudgingly putting up with her frequent surprise visits. As Gentry gains a familiarity with Baby, she becomes convinced that the man-child has the capacity to learn how to speak and walk. When Comer's character becomes convinced that the Wadsworths are subtly thwarting her efforts to help Baby, she recommends the child be removed from the house. The family defies Ann at every corner, with the eventual showdown between the social worker and the Wadsworth clan turning into a surprisingly violent romp.
As weird as ""The Baby"" sounds from the description above, the movie gets even stranger up close and personal. A certain encounter between Baby and one of his sisters implies a behavior that is both shocking and deeply repulsive. Moreover, as time goes on we soon begin to suspect the actions of the angelic Ann Gentry. What are her motivations for the endless surprise visits to the Wadsworth house? The last social worker knew the boundaries of the job. Why can't Ann put her emotions in check? Even noticing Gentry's increasingly nosy behavior won't prepare you for the mind-shattering conclusion. That little jolt comes arcing out of the sky with the force of a thunderclap, throwing into confusion everything you thought you knew up to that point. Even better, once you watch the whole thing and remember the clues you will slap yourself on the forehead for not seeing where this one was going. Maybe it's the garish clothing or the hilarious birthday party for Baby where the d&eacute;cor and music is part psychedelic trip and part disco fever that prevents the viewer from keeping things in perspective. (This is 1973, remember, one of those awkward years between the hippies and ""Saturday Night Fever."" Yikes.)
The performances in ""The Baby"" are top notch. Roman believably plays the cynical matriarch of the clan, a woman so inured to the way things are that she will brook no upheavals to her family's stability from some high minded social worker. The actresses who play Alba and Germaine are two foxy gals decked out in huge hair and risqu&eacute; '70's clothes. They play their parts to a T, as two nasty young ladies who know the score and are loyal to their mother up to the bitter end. Anjanette Comer does an adequate turn as Ann Gentry, conveying just the right amount of concern and hardheaded persistence over Baby's status in the Wadsworth house. She also makes the twist ending believable. Congratulations deservedly go to David Manzy in the role of Baby. This guy never utters one word in the entire picture and after awhile you really come to believe this is a twenty something year old guy who never developed past the infant stage.
The DVD doesn't really give us anything to stand up and shout about. ""The Baby,"" perhaps more than most other films, really deserves a commentary track from some of the principal members of the cast and crew. I just want to know two things about this movie: what were you thinking and how in the heck did you manage to get a 'PG' rating for this film? This movie is so disturbing that I cringe a bit thinking about the kiddies going to see this one in the theater. If I had seen this as a youth I would have been permanently scarred. It took me years to get over the creepy commercials for the film ""Magic""; I can only imagine what ""The Baby"" would have done to my sensibilities. In short, if you like strange, check out ""The Baby.""",1070755200,21,5308,4.672008547008547

After reading about this movie, I decided to purchase it.  Well I watched it today, and I am not a bit disappointed.  Ted Post, who also directs Beneath the Planet of the Apes, also directs this one.  Baby is a young man of about 21-26 who crawls, eats babyfood, sucks his thumb, and dirties his diapers. He's Developmentally Disabled.

Baby lives in an abusive home, were his mother and sisters would rather see him abused his entire life, over growing into a mature adult.  One extraordinarily hurtful scene that stuck out to me, is when baby is repeatedly shocked by his two abusive sisters.  I recommend this film to anyone with an open mind and a caring heart for DD people. But I warn the close minded, this film (especially the diaper change scene) may be offensive to you. Do realize that there are Millions of DD people in the USA, and many of them also need care like the man in this film.

People that flaunt the disabled, usually are the ones that are offended by this film. They are offended, because they lack a heart and a compassion for DD people.

UPDATE 1/10/06

Know since I have had some experience in the HomeCare industry, I can know say that people like Baby in this film are not all that uncommon.  Once I forgot a lunch for a client I was working with and dropped it off at his facility for Developmentally disabled people.  As I was there a young man in his twenties was crawling on the ground towards me, sucking his thumb and hollering in baby talk at me.  He was wearing pampers (as he made very obvious to anyone that saw him) and he was being watched by his careprovider whom was a young gal in her twenties.  While I was there I took a tour of the facility and ran into so many other clients just like the Baby in this movie.

Working with people of this disability degree is not a career for me, I believe that it's certainly important to understand people in the real world like Baby. Sadly many people are offended with this film, as they are with people with disabilities in general.

A challenge for those that are offended with this film.

Take on a job in the HomeCare industry working with SEVERE DD people (like the man in this film). Try it yourself.

You will probably have to do the following in your job.

-Feed your client
-Change diapers (sometimes many times a day)
-Shower your client
-Give medications
-Fill Medications
-Budget the books
-Do errands and shopping
-Cook
-Clean
-Take your client out to movies and other misc activities
-Etc..

I think that after you work one on one with the SEVERE Developmentally Disabled you will develop a heart and a compassion for them and you will no longer refer to the man in this film as ""sick, or twisted.""",1044921600,6,2712,4.44040404040404
568484,4,6303132782,"This is very interesting film which I would call more of a psychological drama. The clarity, sound, and overall picture quality are excellent for this DVD as related to an early '70s film. Some ""behind the scenes"" would make it better however.
The actor who played ""Baby"" did an excellent job. He crawls, screams, cries, wears diapers, lives in a crib and playpen, sucks a bottle and his thumb like a real baby. he is very realistic in his role as a boy/man of about 21 who is living in a physically and emotionally abusive and deprived houshold. The opening scene of the movie, the interview, makes it clear who the dominating and weak forces are. The camera angles, positioning and angels bear out each characters position and continues as the movie evolves. The editing is good as is the storyline line for a movie of the 1970's. There are some interesting and disturbing scenes throughout the film. The innocent diaper change by the babysitter and a playtime accident where she consoles baby and an act of breastfeeding innocently follows turns into a violent beating when the mother unexpectedly walks in. The demonstration that ""Baby"" is capable of learning and doing rudimentary skills and the mother intimidating and scolding her retarded son followed by a cruel tortuing by his sister are just some of the scenes of noteworthiness and make this film quite interesting and certainly perverse. Although an odd film, the theme and objectives of each of the characters is very clear as is the history and rationale of the family and of the social worker.
There is much domination and revenge, directly and indirectly, in this film. Some scenes may be found, by some, to be strong and offensive but they give definite support and are essential to the storyline.

7838540,3,6303132782,"First, I give you the Blu-ray review:

I hate to say this, as I am one of the people who was waiting for this classic to be released on Blu-ray. Originally, the releases of this film were in open matte full frame. Now, that doesn't mean this is the aspect ratio of the original theatrical exhibition and I honestly have no idea what the original ratio was. However, this release cuts the top and bottom off of the open matte, which many of us have acclimated to, in order to re-frame it into a widescreen presentation.

If you are like me and have seen this on vhs and dvd in full frame, even a handful of times over the years, this Blu-ray presentation will feel very cramped, even if it isn't. You may find yourself feeling that the film is wrong, somehow, and looks more like a telefilm than a theatrical exhibition film. The same feeling of loss that occurs when watching a 2:35:1 that has been cropped to 1:78:1 is very present and troublesome in this film where the original top and bottom have been cropped right off of the film.

To clarify, you may find this transfer unobjectionable but, for me, the loss is stifling. The cutting off of that few inches of wall above a person's head and the cutting of the crown of a person's head and the cutting just below their chin or neck in order to fit a closeup into the new aspect ratio, quite simply, are just too distracting to allow for full enjoyment of this film. It just about drives me nuts trying to watch this version. I love this film and, for me, it just doesn't work in a widescreen presentation that cuts off the open matte top and bottom I am accustomed to.

Severin could easily have included a second, open matte and full frame version of this film, but they didn't. Beyond that, the color on the transfer is decidedly muted as compared to my original dvd, which is not uncommon with Severin transfers, but the re-framing is not something they generally do to their films and, for that reason, I encourage you to think about this issue before spending your hard earned cash. I'm only giving this a ""3"" because the film itself is so good, and so, I wish you luck in making a difficult choice between the full frame low resolution DVD with better color and full picture versus the high definition re-frame washout that should never have been released in this condition. It is not an easy choice given that it stands as the only Blu-ray to date.

And now, I give you a violation of my rules, a brief review of the film itself:

So, this is one of those films that warrants actual discussion, of all things, on the merits. You see, The Baby is an old style, slow-build, discomfort film. At least, that's what my grandfather called them. I call them psychological horror films. Whatever you call it, however you choose to label this oddity and rarity of a horror film, what you need to know is, simply, that this film will make you uncomfortable in the best possible way. Where most films dealing with the most difficult of all issues, the abuse of children, opt for a portrait of a small child being rescued from abuse by a grandparent or a foster parent or, even worse, a portrait of how happily we abuse victims adjust to our newer and better surroundings, this film paints a very different picture and it asks, and answers, the most difficult question we deal with in abuse situations.

Outside of abuse situations, most people think, wrongly, that the most important question concerning abuse is ""where were you touched"". Inside of abuse situations, we victims realize rather quickly in life that the most important question concerning our abuse is ""how does this part of my identity fit into, basically, everything that makes up the rest of my life"". This, being the most important question, is also the most difficult to answer, as it is uncomfortably intertwined with all of the other abuse issues, such as, who knows you were abused, who knows your abuser, are they still in your life, who are you outside of being a victim, do you feel like a victim, do you know how to trust, are you capable of loving another person without distrusting them, who do you want to tell, who do you not want to tell, and so on and so forth, down the line, in perpetuity. Somehow, being an abuse victim changes, fundamentally, much of the substance of the narrative of your individual life's story.

That having been said, this story, the tale of a man who was born into a sick family with a mother who, all too easily, convinced her two daughters to help her condition their retarded or possibly not retarded baby brother, named simply Baby, to never, ever, ever, learn. The ""baby"" in this film is a twenty-one year old toddler. He can't speak. He can't take care of himself. He can't even walk. The issue of whether he could, if properly motivated and taught, is nowhere near as important as the underlying ""discomfort"" element, that element being the issue of how someone in such a horrific abuse situation could ever, under any circumstances, escape, and into what kind of life a victim, so victimized, could even have.

This is old school horror. It tells a story that makes you ill, not because it is poorly told or annoying as so many horror films are, but, because it is real. There are retarded people all over the world who are being abused, right now, by paid caregivers. There are children, there are elderly people, there are hospital patients, all being abused, right now, while you read this, in a variety of ways you could not even imagine, assuming you are both a good person and not a victim. If you are either a bad person or simply someone who was harmed by a bad person, then you can probably imagine and, in case you care, I'm terribly sorry that is your circumstance.

As for me, I love this film, with my whole heart. I was victimized in ways too terrible to say, based on the vomit of the last person I told, and, though I am a healthy and well-recovered individual, I recognize that a huge portion of who I am is the product of what my abuser made of me. This film paints a portrait of a twenty-one year old toddler who will never recover, no matter what, and then shows you, as the viewer, one possibility of a potentially good outcome while simultaneously asking you to consider how good or bad that outcome might be. Of course, there is some violence, there is some blood, there is some creep-out nausea, there is some stuff Amazon would never allow me to mention. But, ultimately, this is a simple story of an extreme victim in extreme circumstances and what happens when a social worker decides to get involved. It doesn't go where you think it will, although, it might, depending on your particular answers to those particular questions.

Enjoy. This is a fun one.",1481414400,3,6749,4.528301886792453
