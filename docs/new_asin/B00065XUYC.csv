Add a hundred thousand dollars of other people's money, and you've got amature-laughable-dredge. You've been warned.",1377043200,,287,5.260869565217392
8478061,5,B00065XUYC,"Day of Redemption was an excellent movie.  Jeff Fahey took his ability to play a great law man as he did so in the ""Marshall"" and gave an amazing performance as Sheriff Frank Everly.  Also doing a great job was David Lee Rawlings who played the bad guy, Vincent Pope, and arch enemy of Everly (Fahey).  Both actors were very believable in their fight to the finish.  Included in with all the action, there are a number of funny moments that will leave you laughing.  This intense tale of justice and revenge should be a part of everyone's ACTION VIDEO library right up there with other Jeff Fahey movies like ""The Wrangler"" and ""Ghost Rock"" and classic westerns like ""The Good The Bad and The Ugly"" and ""Pale Rider"".  If you like action you will like this movie.",1102550400,4,762,4.4855072463768115
8478062,5,B00065XUYC,"""Day of Redemption"" is a modern day western set in the dusty, desert plains of Arizona. The intensity of the rivalry between Sheriff Frank Everly (played by Jeff Fahey) and escaped convicted murderer Vincent Pope (played by David Lee Rawlings)is established in the beginning and continues to build throughout this plot driven story.  Sheriff Everly not only faces the challenges offered by Pope, but also battles demons of his own. With the support of friends and townspeople, Sheriff Everly confronts his past and sets out to settle his future.

I liked this movie because of its excellent musical score,  spectacular setting, and ""gun slinging"", fast paced, action filled, suspenseful story. Writer David Lee Rawlings captures the audience from the beginning and holds their attention to the dramatic conclusion.",1102204800,3,814,5.34375
8478063,5,B00065XUYC,"I saw ""Day of Redemption"" at the 2004 San Diego Film Fest and loved it!  The story is gripping, the characters are  believable and the soundtrack is kickass.  Writer/producer David Lee Rawlings steals the movie from Jeff Fahey (in probably his best perormance in years) as the super-evil villain.  Don't wait... buy this movie!",1100304000,,327,5.0
