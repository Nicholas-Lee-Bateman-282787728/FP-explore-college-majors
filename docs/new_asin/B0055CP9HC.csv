4572983,2,B0055CP9HC,"I am a huge fan of Marvel animation, and have collected many of DVDs from Marvel and DC including the Justice League, X-Men, Avengers, Batman AS, Hulk vs Thor and others, which are all creative, artistic and visually entertaining.  I have viewed scenes from Loki and Thor; Blood Brothers, but did not care for the animation format and my question is why such drastic variations in the visual animation format from the same production company? I would think the fans would appreciate some consistency in this area, just as in voice casting.",1316304000,4,539,4.858695652173913
4572984,5,B0055CP9HC,"I have been aware of motion comics for a few years now, mostly from the Watchmen motion comic put together when that film came out.  Like a lot of people, I was really put off by it.  It wasn't good.  Didn't do justice to the story and it didn't do justice to the comics medium.  My thought was ""why does this exist?""  The answer seemed to be it existed as an alternative to the ""effort"" of reading.

  This is the prejudice I carried as other motion comics appeared as tie ins for shows like Spartacus: Blood and Sand, Inception, and Sucker Punch.  These grew a little better, but I wasn't moved.

  That is not until a few months ago when I saw other Marvel and DC efforts with motion comics.  I got really excited and began seeing the possibilities for motion comics as a genre.  I believe the first one to really get me was IRON MAN: Extremis.

  After that, I devoured everything else I could find, going from X-Men: Gifted to the Spider-Woman motion comic to Thor & Loki when that appeared on i-Tunes.  There were also some black and white Batman motion comics as well as some for Batgirl that were less inspiring but still excellent.

  However my excitment still lies chiefly with the Marvel efforts because they were the most involved, the most exciting and atmospheric.  Textured.  Artistic.  All of those descriptions come together in the drama Thor & Loki, which finally produces Motion Comics' first strong DRAMA.  It's worth a look.

  And I truly hope readers share my excitement and help support the medium, as I think it is and will be the most supportive and respectful to comic artists and painters that is likely to come along bridging the gap to video screens.

  It certainly shows the potential for artists who wish to produce pictorial or photographic narratives.",1310169600,37,1787,4.613418530351438
4572991,4,B0055CP9HC,"Magnetic Dreams get it and I think they made some of the best motion comics Marvel has released.  Not sure why they stopped but their approach was better then what we have been getting more recently.  While the 3D models don't always work the care taken to making sure everything plays out more like a film and less like an experimental animation make it flow better then most motion comics.

The voice acting might be the best in any of the Marvel Knights series I have seen yet and the story quite strong.  Loki's voice actor in particular is really good.  The story plays out like a Shakespeare play and it has a lot of good character moments.

My only complaint is there are no chapters so you can't skip the intro and the episodes are longer then most other motion comics.  So if you have to turn it off in the middle you have to fast forward through it.  Other then that it's a great addition to anyone's collection.",1404864000,,922,4.382352941176471

4572994,2,B0055CP9HC,"With Loki more as MacBeth than the God of Mischief.  The artwork is just that.  Artwork.  Static.  The plot revolves around Loki having already achieved his ultimate goal.  He is the ruler of Asgard.  Thor, Sif, Balder, and even Odin himself are imprisoned.  Now that he has the throne, he really doesn't want all the responsibilities that come with it and he really does not want to execute his step-brother.  Thus as all the action has taken place before this movie begins, this story arc is really only Loki talking about and thinking out loud about what he wants, what he has done, what he will do and how he feels.  It is very much like a low budget stage production.  No action.  No special effects.  By the end of the movie, Loki realizes he has made a mistake, many mistakes, but before he can act, again - no action.  He dies.

I have read a lot of Shakespeare, Chaucer, Beowulf, and read an equal measure of comic books.  I can appreciate what the actors and artists were trying to do here.  But this attempt does not meet the mark.",1388102400,,1042,4.405263157894737

4572997,4,B0055CP9HC,A little different from most stories I have seen of Thor and Loki The process of how they got the comic book in to the video was interesting. Using some of the actual art fro the comic in the video and mapping it on to 3d models was very interesting.  I must say it wasn't always effective but it was interesting. Some of the movement of the  3d models was not well done not very smooth and was a bit stiff but overall I liked it well enough.,1355011200,,442,4.011363636363637

4573000,5,B0055CP9HC,"This is the highwater mark of motion comics. It seems as if all voice actors, motion animators, and the director were inspired by Rodi & Ribic's incomparable character study and highly aesthetic rendering of, through Loki's soliloquys mostly, what he and Thor mean to one another as well as just how fated and perhaps unfair their destinies are. Though Marvel Knights Motion Comics had their work cut out for them, they succeeded admirably. Wonderfully even. This is the first motion comic I can call a beautiful work. It's not that the others aren't good, it's just that this is the one that truly pushes the envelope; when the letter's finally read, it announces its mastery to all. Amotz Plessner (remember his name if his work on this is any indication of what kind of work he typically puts out there) creates a hauntingly epic, otherworldly musical score that had me buying into this from the outset. And when the rest of the dvd delivered, I was totally sold. The voice actors enunciate their parts so well that they are all simply exquisite; even the minor characters become memorable. A huge plus for your purchase price is the lengthy documentary of Rodi & Ribic's discussion of their graphic novel as well as how that thought their work was transferred to a different medium. (They were well pleased . . .) You also get commentary. You couldn't have put together two such great creators on a title, nor could you have put together a better production than what you'll find on the Thor & Loki :  Blood Brothers digital motion comic. Look at the other reviews, and you'll see that most everyone agrees. This is ten dollars very well spent.",1348185600,4,1648,4.722222222222222
4573013,3,B0055CP9HC,"This had all the potential to be great.
1. I love norse mythos.
2. The vocabulary and grammar style is perfect asgard.
3. Loki and Thor are excellent characters.
4. An excellent match between music and mood.
5. The animation style is bizarre. With a fantastic production, a bizarre style can be incredible. With a bad production, a bizarre animation style is a disaster. There are parts that don't move that should.  There are parts that move more than you would ever expect. There are foreground/background details vs abstract cartoons that are too disparate, and yet, that makes it intriguing.

But in the end, the story just bored the crap out of me.

Unending dialog and little action. We hear how much Loki hates himself and how much everyone else hates him too. He even makes a great leap saying that everyone else created him, but that he has found a way to beat fate, to be better than the pathetic thing fate wants him to be and that everyone else has helped him to become, even himself.

If he was even a little evil, he would have killed every disgusting character that told him how pathetic he was in almost every scene, instead of listening to their words and deciding what they might really mean.

The ending was just sad. Was that supposed to be cool or thought provoking? Maybe. I didn't like it at all. I predicted it and it was just sad.

Since it is Marvel Knights, I assume this was a comic before it was a show? If so, fans of the comic will likely love the show. But not I.

So I give it 3 stars. 1 star for the boring pace and predictable and sad ending. 4 stars for creating this big of an emotional response in me.  Average that out, you get 2.5, so I rounded up.",1346544000,,1688,4.353503184713376
4573014,1,B0055CP9HC,"The DVD was so boring. The entire DVD is of Loki walking around and crying about how no one loves him. There is no action what so ever. And the worst part is that Thor is rarely in any of the 4 episodes.

4573015,4,B0055CP9HC,"I've read the other reviews and there are a lot of valid points. If you watch this expecting a typical Marvel version of a Thor movie then you will probably be both disappointed and confounded; based on that aspect I completely understand the less then stellar reviews. However, if you take this as a visually artistic piece (I personally thought the animation was ""freakin"" awesome) that plays out like a drama and you appreciate stylized/unique forms of animation I think you may really like this movie as I did. Yes, I am a comic book geek and no, I don't think this has much of anything to do with Thor either but I think it's a really cool movie nonetheless. If you are a fanboy I would probably avoid this but if you can appreciate something different I think it's worth a shot because you may come to really enjoy this like I did.",1344211200,,837,4.441558441558442
4573016,1,B0055CP9HC,"Devout Fan:
I will start by saying; I love everything Thor, except for this.  Having been born with the name Thor as my father before me, I have always been into Norse Mythology and the Marvel comic book series.  I have read over a dozen Norse Mythology books and every issue of Marvel's Thor from his 1st appearance in issue 83 of Journey into Mystery to issue 126 when its name changed to The Might Thor, to after issue 500.

 Film insertion to Marvel's Thor brand:
Marvel's Thor has had many different artists, different comic series, and an array of animation movies all in addition to the new films that we all saw him in the theater.  To say that this particular animation movie doesn't fit in with anything that came before it, is the nicest thing I can say. This movie is what you would expect from an art student you hired based solely on GPA.  It is as if the artist, of this film, unknowing or caring of anything that had come before was given free reign and decided to take this opportunity to kick off his/her career by launching a new medium.  Marvel should have trashed this film immediately upon the 1st viewing, because starting over from scratch would have been the only way they could have fixed it.  Whoever was involved in the travesty of this so called film are lucky Thor is a fictional/mythological character; because, were he were real, they'd be dust.  This film not only destroys the Marvel's Thor Brand, it shows that they will produce crap and mix it in with chocolate, in order to make another buck.

Animation/Graphics:
This film is done in a non-flowing animation comprised of sketches. All the characters of this film look as if despite being immortal, the god's bodies continue to age.  Everyone in the film has rough creases, deformities, and scars. Loki also seems to only have a few teeth. I have not seen any of the other Marvel Knights brand films, but it this is an indicator of what is to be expected, I'm done spending money on the Marvel crap-factory.  Fans of Marvel comics or Norse Mythology, heed my word: avoid interaction with all haste.",1342742400,,2085,4.575268817204301
4573017,2,B0055CP9HC,Good story line. Bad art work. Very bad ending. Marvel dropped the ball on this one. Do not buy this!!!!,1341360000,3,104,4.25
4573018,4,B0055CP9HC,"A very good story. Yes, there could have and should have been more backstory and history, but I believe that will change as the genre gains more support. For those of you that are not familiar with them, these are animated graphic novels somewhat along the lines of video games. Like others, I was hesitant at first about buying these. Marvel is definitely the best when it comes to artwork and production. I have definitely grown to appreciate these animated graphic novels. I still like animated movies like all-star superman, doom, etc. DC seems to have the advantage with the animated movies and the series such as justice league, justice league unlimited, etc.",1337040000,,665,4.893805309734513
4573019,1,B0055CP9HC,"I must admit I'm not a giant comic book fan and the comics I do read are more DC then Marvel but I do enjoy the Marvel movies and cartoons. After seeing the Thor movie I wanted to know more about Thor and Loki's relationship and ""Blood Brothers"" seemed like the perfect way to do it. I watched it with my father who only has a slightly higher opinion of this movie then I do and my opinion is that it was horrible. I couldn't stand the style of the moving comics, and the plot was horrible. The whole movie Loki is gloating, reflecting or tormenting himself but it's all a bunch of talking. NOTHING HAPPENS! And besides glimpses of Thor we never see him and at the end you wish he had stayed out of the movie for freaking five more minutes so there MIGHT have been a decent ending to a miserable story. I didn't even like the set up of it being episodes, it would have been better to have it be a movie so you weren't constantly interrupted by the scene of Thor and Loki about to fight which was the only good looking scene to begin with. I would barely recommend this to hardcore fans and I recommend avoiding it to anyone simply curious.",1334880000,,1139,4.205479452054795
4573020,3,B0055CP9HC,"I'm not familiar with the source material and Thor and Loki are little more than names to me. I know them only as Norse Gods. If this at all adheres to legend it seems like an interesting story. It doesn't really come out well here though.

Here's the scoop. Loki has defeated Thor in combat. He now rules over the kingdom. He has Thor imprisoned in a dungeon (as he does others who he feels have wronged him) and plans to execute Thor at morning's light.

What this has going for it is the art and language. There is almost no real animation here. Physical movement is kept to a minimum. But the design is pretty cool. The characters and their get-ups are designed well. The women are mostly voluptuous warrior types. Veritable wet dreams for adolescent boys. The language is of a near Shakespearean sound with very eloquent, flowery passages. Some of the thoughts run deeper that one might expect in this sort of outing.

For my money the story was where it all fell apart. It goes fine for most of the running time then just sort of stops. The climax is not very....climactic. Loki comes to a realization quietly, and when he tries to right things he's treated to a big dose of irony. I did like certain things. Loki's entire focus is on beating Thor and grabbing the kingdom. But, once he has it, he doesn't really want it. He wants the kingdom without the responsibility of running it. And I liked his feeling of persecution. He confronts all number of people he feels slighted him over the years. He never seemed to know when people were nice to him.

This isn't a bad watch. Just don't expect too much from it.",1334275200,,1617,4.452702702702703
4573021,5,B0055CP9HC,"After reading the mixed reviews about this movie, I still wanted to see it for myself. Some people seem to really not like it at all while others loved it. After seeing it once I would have given it 4 stars. I really liked it the first time around, but honestly, after seeing it a few times, I have to say I absolutely love it and will give it 5 stars. Understand, however that this movie isn't for everyone. If you are looking for a typical Thor vs. Loki beatdown, forget it. This is not about watching a fight or match. All we need to know is that Loki finally schemed successfully and defeated Thor.

The movie is pretty much about getting into Loki's head. The voice actor who voices old man Loki is perfect. He doesn't seem to have any other credits on IMDB except this, but whoever he is he sounds very professional. He sounds like he's done Shakespeare all his life and that's perfect for this. I absolutely love the dialogue and Loki's monologues. I love the way the Norse mythology has been brought into this story. In fact, in many ways its more Norse than Marvel. The Warriors Three do not even appear in it, (they are a Stan Lee/Jack Kirby creation).

The animation style is okay. I think its better than a motion comic. Its not all that colorful, but it has its own style. I only wish Loki didn't have to look ugly. I hate that. He looks much older than Thor or Odin, which makes no sense. We know Loki is mischievous and the trickster and God of Lies, etc. I don't think its necessary to make him look ugly or decrepit to prove that he's the ""bad guy"".

If you are a fan of Loki's, this is worth checking out. While his childhood doesn't necessarily justify his bad behavior, we can understand its roots. Loki's behavior is often a rash reaction to things done to him and that is something many people can relate to. Loki's often felt like he's just been Asgard's punching bag.

So if you want to see Thor kick Loki's butt for an hour you can forget it. If you want great writing and stories about Loki's past, check it out.",1329091200,19,2038,4.31331592689295
4573022,4,B0055CP9HC,"This was an awesome graphic novel/cartoon.  It was well done.  It is a good story, and done from the view of Loki instead of Thor as most of the movies or comics are done.",1325462400,,171,4.0
4573037,1,B0055CP9HC,"Great art but horrible plot. It didn't develop the story enough as to how Loki defeated and captured Thor. Loki is cast as weaker, smaller, and much older than Thor. The entire production is a close up of Loki talking as if he is in a Renaissance Fair. The dialog was so bad that at one point Loki and Thor's mother Frigga discuss how she didn't breastfeed him. She tells him she couldn't. Then they discuss how she is not his mother. She refers to Odin as his father and Loki responds that if she is not his mother then Odin cannot be his father. Which we all know that just because Frigga is not the mother doesn't mean Odin can't be the father. I felt like someone in High School wrote the dialog as it was poorly written and boring.",1324857600,5,736,4.226950354609929

4573039,1,B0055CP9HC,"Marvel's Joe Quesada proudly boasted that the Marvel Knights animated comics were a new brilliant idea.  Actually not new, because Marvel did them in the classic 1966 Marvel Super Heroes series.  Anyway, I saw the trailers for the Marvel Knights series, and I had high hopes (especially for Thor/Loki Blood Brothers).

SEMI-SPOILER ALERT:  The story begins with the classic evil trickster Loki in charge of Asgard, all the heroes and leaders in chains, and no clear explanation of how this happened. His prison guards all appear to be stupid or drunk.  Episodes consist of a frail, ugly looking Loki running around mouthing off at or about his prisoners, remembering his miserable past, and haggling with a couple famous female characters.  Loki also eats a pig's face.  There is a brief flashback of a snowy battle with Thor, but this was already seen in the trailer, and is the only action sequence.  Another character important to Loki shows up then disappears for the rest of the story.  At least the viewer can understand why Loki is so difficult all the time.

Later, after a date, Loki decides he might reconcile with Thor who has been locked up this whole time with his hair covering his face.  Thor is in a bad mod, so no-go.  That's all folks.  A lot of brooding and mental conflict with no pay-off.  I was hoping for a great show-down battle between the forces of good and evil, but no.

I didn't read the graphic novel, but purchased this video and watched it with some friends who are long time big comic fans.  They all erupted in sarcastic laughter at the end, and expressed disbelief that this story self-destructed so completely.  If you want some quality Thor stories, read the Kirby Thor comics from the 60s.  Even the 1966 Thor cartoons with limited comic animation completely surpass this failure.  How sad that the 1966 Marvel Super Heroes series have not been released yet in the USA.  Hey Disney, you own Marvel now so how about a DVD set before the 2012 Avengers movie.

FWIW, The recent Thor movie would be a much better purchase than Blood Brothers.",1321228800,3,2076,4.711111111111111

No spoilers, but I just want everyone to know this is a very Loki-centric comic and Thor's not in it much.  Not that Thor's lack of presence did much to detract from this comic.
