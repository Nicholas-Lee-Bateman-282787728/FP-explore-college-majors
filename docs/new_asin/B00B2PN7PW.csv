Content excellent as well.  I felt very lucky to stumble across this English Holocaust DVD on amazon.",1491609600,,379,4.371428571428571
8561590,3,B00B2PN7PW,"I love this powerful film, and gave the DVD a five star review.

But this blu-ray has forced French subtitles that can't be turned off.  Also, the visual quality is really no better than the DVD to my eye.  Since almost all the footage is old and low resolution, there isn't much of a difference between the two.  Beyond that, it looked to my eyel the blu-ray had aded visual artifacts I never noticed in the DVD.

So unless you speak French only, you're much better off with the regular DVD version.",1430784000,,500,4.391304347826087
