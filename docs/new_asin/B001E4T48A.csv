If you don't already have most of the Gong albums than this would be a great DVD to get.
If you are an avid collector of all things Gong, then this could be a huge disappointment.

This is a concert video filmed at a Gong reunion that has most of the musicians from the Pothead Pixies days, including Steve Hillage.  It is about 2 and half hours long of all music.  It is in widescreen format and the video quality is OK.  The filming of the concert is not that good.  The band is crammed on to a small stage (it seems like every Gong video I have seen is on a stage too small).  So, the camera angles can be bad and the right person isn't always focused and can be buried in the back.  On the plus side, there isn't much of the constant Pan and Scan and zooming in and out like many concert videos today.

The sound is only in stereo.  However, the sound quality is very good and better than a CD.

At the concert, they play all the great songs, including a big chunk of the Pothead trilogy.  The songs are expanded with long, well played solos.

The problem is that there is nothing new.  They play these songs just like they were playing them live 4 decades ago, going back to Live, etc. and Gong is Dead and then into 1980s and 1990s, like Live on TV.  Only back then, they seemed to play with more energy and innovation.  Here they sound like the are just copying what they used to do...almost like a tribute band.

Steve Hillage hasn't played with the band since the 1970s and it shows.  He hardly makes any presence during most of the concert.  When he does have a solo, it is the same solo he played in the 1970s.  At this festival, Hillage also did a 40 minute solo concert which is also available on DVD.  I think it is better than this Gong concert.

Gong is one of my favorite groups and I am glad to see the group continue on after many groups have folded.  This is a good concert, with some great songs and great solos.  If you haven't heard much by Gong, then is great.  To me, it was a disappointment because I don't think I really heard anything I hadn't heard before.",1351641600,,2127,4.179802955665025
8296299,5,B001E4T48A,"This is easily a 5 star concert recording for Gong fans, with the band in very fine form indeed playing like only Gong does. For anyone else, well, I doubt you'd be even looking at this page, but it may be closer to a 1 star for you, unless you are willing to take a chance, and take a little trip out beyond the visible to the Planet Gong.....

This compete show from the ""Gong Family Unconventional Gathering"", in Melkweg Amsterdam in 2006, is a reunion of all living members (Allen, Hillage, Smyth, Howlett, Blake, Giraudy and Malherbe, with the very able addition of Chris Taylor (drums) and Theo Travis (additional sax and flute). They look about the same as 40 years ago, just older...and they sound about the same - a playful mix of silly, sublime and over the top, yet with focused masterful musicianship throughout. The whole show is cool as a concert experience (very good sound, camera angles, and set list spanning their whole early catalogue, amusing costumes for Daevid and enthused performing by them all -Its especially nice to be able to see Daevid playing his glissando). The story of Zero the Hero, and the Octave Doctors and Pothead Pixies of the Planet Gong comes across more coherently than on the series of ""Gong Trilogy"" albums, and this is really the heart of the whole thing.

Musically the best part of the show for me was the last half when Allen comes out in his wizard's dress and pointed hat for a powerful set of Magdelene, Sprinkling of Clouds, She is the Great Goddess/Master Builder and Isle of Everywhere, ending with an extended You Never Blow Your Trip Forever (with audience sing-a-long). This sublimeness makes the equal dose of silliness worth it.

It had been a long time since they had all played together (30+ years?), but you sure would't know it from this show, such are the ties that bond... Till we all meet again on the Planet Gong...

(ps for a preview check out youtube, ""Gong Live At the Uncon 2006"" - there are a couple of good clips of Isle of Everywhere.)",1343779200,,2010,4.5905292479108635
8296300,5,B001E4T48A,"WOW! I was hoping the uniformly excellent reviews on this were at least half true, but WOW!!!  Considering the advancing age of the participants (I wouldn't mind having Gilli Smyth as MY space-whisperin' grandma), and the complexity/intricacy of the ""Radio Gnome Trilogy"" (That's Ga-nome to you, brother), I never imagined how tight, funky, spacey and ROCKING this would be.  During the first song, ""You Can't Kill Me"", Daevid Allen's vocals (who, by the way, looks like he just returned from Tolkien-land by way of Hogwart's) were a little shaky in the beginning, but by the end of the song, and throughout the rest of the concert, he rocked them, not to mention his excellent lead, rhythm and glissando guitar playing.  Also during the song I noticed a younger guitarist smokin' the leads Hillage-sytle, and figured that Steve himself, who was listed in all the credits, would make an appearance later.  Imagine my chagrin, when by the 2nd cut I realized that the young hotshot axe-man WAS Steve Hillage himself!  I guess the short haircut and clean shaven face threw me!  Another of the MANY highlights was Tim Blake's performance on keys, synths, vocals and general cosmic mayhem.  I thought Tim looked a little rough around the edges, but read recently of his almost fatal 2004 car accident.  Maybe his exuberance at being alive added to his nimble & exciting contributions.  The addition of fellow sax player & flautist Theo Travis enabled the reproduction of longtime member Didier Malherbe's exciting tandem overdubs on the original recordings.  Didier's contributions, along with Steve Hillage and his longtime partner and fellow GONG alumni Miquette Giraudy's keys & synths, were beyond exciting!  Tying together and anchoring this raging beast of a band was newby Chris ""I Can't Believe I'm Here"" Taylor's rock steady funk throbbin' drums (Pierre & Pip would be proud) and the group's secret weapon, Mike Howlett on bass.  Mike's awesome talent really shows, along with his pure joy while playing.  The filming of the show is first-rate, with great editing.  The video effects were tasteful and unobtrusive, and the sound is everything it should be.  For GONG fans this DVD is NIRVANA, for those wondering what the band is all about it makes a great primer.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

8296301,5,B001E4T48A,"A must for GONG fans! True, the artists are older and Gilli Smyth looks like a grandmother in her late 60's to early 70's, but the music is the Gong from The Radio Gnome trilogy we all love! C;lose your eyes and you are transported back to those days in the 1970's where they were young and sang of Planet Gong. The only change is they added a second sax player, Theo Traviscitude. Yhis adds quite a bit of depth to the woodwind parts. The return of Steve Hillage and Miquette Giraudy brings the circle complete. Sadly, Pierre Moerlen's passing onto planet Gong was missed but Chris Taylor did a good job filling in. If your a fan of Gong, BUY THIS DVD. Remember, I am , you are, we all are crazy!",1257292800,2,697,4.2481203007518795
