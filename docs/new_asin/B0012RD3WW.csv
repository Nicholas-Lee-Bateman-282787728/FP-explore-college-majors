8247407,3,B0012RD3WW,"Well I actaully bought this particular set a few months ago...the series is amazingly funny and the songs stay in your head for days! The only thing that had me a little sketchy was there was a differnt picture on the cover that I didn't see on the other box sets (of the same series), and the price was significantly lower then other sellers. After I recieved the series in the mail, I can say the product is legit, but there are no special features on this particular set. Also, there are actually 3 DVDs, not 4.
The series is hillarious, and if don't care about no special features, then I say buy this version.

8247408,5,B0012RD3WW,"This was an amazing find, and the price was too good to be true. You can't find it like this at the conventions. I had no complaints about this, but I strongly recommend you watch this with the Japanese dialogue and the English subtitles. The English dialogue is funny, but doesn't always make sense with what's going on. The original Japanese is a lot more clear, even if you do have to watch the bottom of the screen to know what they're saying. It was a great buy either way!",1220659200,3,478,4.322222222222222
