8108907,3,B000EF5MRM,The dvd is high quality but I wanted more.  There were a lot of highlights that were omitted from the dvd.  You might be better served just watching highlights on youtube of the Trojans.,1384646400,,186,4.4411764705882355
8108908,4,B000EF5MRM,"IF you are a USC Trojans Football fan you will love this video.  The main feature is a game by game look at the 2005 season.  This includes watching the highlights of what could be the greatest offense in college football history.  QB Matt Leinart, RB's Bush, White and Kirkman, receivers Jarrett, Smith, Byrd, Davis and that outstanding offensive line are highlighted time and time again.  The exciting win at Notre Dame and the fight to the end with an inspired Fresno State are memorable.  All Trojans will appreciate this years victory over UCLA.  Even the loss to Texas in the National Championship game at the Rose Bowl is reviewed.  As with prior years, the video includes footage inside the locker room before and after games giving an insiders feel to the production.

The bonus features are a new addition this year.  In the previous three DVD's produced as highlights for the 2002 through 2004 seasons, nothing but the main video was included.  These extra features are all interesting.  The Reggie Bush piece and the two on Matt Leinart are taken from Fox Sports West broadcasts.  I enjoyed the look at the 2006 Recruiting class the most.  The UCLA speeches were a special treat.

With all that was included, I would have appreciated even more.  As in prior years, the video team at USC failed to include video of Spring workouts, the summer camp and practice during the season.  Unlike past years, this video didn't include as much video in the locker rooms.  Pete Carroll is a remarkable motivator.  The atmosphere in that room is electric and seeing more of it, the fabric that binds the team, one to another, is inspiring.

This is not a video for everyone.  Fans of the college game will appreciate it but to truly enjoy it you have to bleed Cardinal and Gold.  This is an outstanding scrapbook, a celebration to yet another memorable year for USC Football.

Congratulations to the Texas Longhorns on their victory over the Trojans in the Rose Bowl and on their National Championship.

8108909,5,B000EF5MRM,"This DVD is a melancholy act to watch, since the march towards the greatest season of all time was interrupted by Texas. This does not stop it from being a must for Trojan fans and college historians. The 2005 Trojans were the best team ever assembled, but like other ""bests"" - the 1954 Indians, the 1983 Cornhuskers, the 1969 Orioles - history will not accord them the title because they did not close out. But this DVD shows something nobody will ever see again; two Heisman winners in the same backfield, plus a third (LenDale White) had he played his senior year. If Bush, White and Mike Williams all played four years. . . ?

Mind boggling.

Texas fans will love this because you can watch in awe at how great USC really was, then sit back in further awe of the fact that the only team in history that probably could have beaten this bunch was the '05 Longhorns led by the superhuman Vince Young. It was a battle between the Carthage and Rome; Troy and Athens; Patton and Rommel. It does not get batter than that!

Carl Weathers narrates this, and he has the voice of Biblical authority. It details each game, has plenty of interviews with key people (Matt Leinart's Fox show, Reggie Bush, Pete Carroll); highlights Bush vs. the likes of O.J. and Gale Sayers; and spotlights all the '06 recruits, who look like the 2008-09 national champs!

Take away all the other reasons to get this DVD: the breathtaking highlights of the insane Notre Dame game, played under the ""blue, gray October skies"" of South Bend, is worth the price.

It also makes no excuses about the Rose Bowl loss. Credit is given in noble defeat, which is SC's way.

Fight On!

8108910,3,B000EF5MRM,"First, I am a die hard Trojan fan, and don't even know why a Texas fan would attempt to review or discuss this DVD.  So most importantly, for Trojan fans, or simply fans of a football team that is more fun to watch on offense than any other in history, this DVD should have been 5 stars.  It wasn't for three reasons. First, the creators did not use any copywrited TV coverage and footage (presumably to save money), therefore the views of the plays are almost exclusively low endzone coverage and very hard to follow (occasionally they are brilliant as plays come right too them, but that doesn't justify the exclusive use).  Secondly, the narrator was dispassionate and over acting with vocal drama (yep, I know, hard to mix the two but he did).  Lastly, the script never allowed you to relive the drama of the game.  You did get a nice look at the players up close, but this should have been: (1) 30 minutes longer with better longer and better game scripting and (2) created with the mix of tv coverage like in every previous year.  Tim Ryan should have been used again as the narrator.  A major dissappointment when contrasted to each of the previous annuals, and given such a great year by such a great team.",1145836800,2,1214,4.490909090909091
8108911,5,B000EF5MRM,"This is an insider's look at USC's breathtaking 2005 season in which the Trojans won their 35th straight game, landed a 4th straight BCS bowl game, 3rd Heisman Trophy winner in the last 4 years, and much more. Highlights of every game, including big road wins at Oregon, ASU, and Notre Dame, lead up to the National Title game against Texas State.

The 2005 Trojan team may not have been the greatest team of all time, as ESPN touted in its hyped build-up to the NC Title Game, but this DVD shows why no other college team has even come close to USC over the last 4 years. Great for any fan of college football!",1144281600,2,611,4.3130434782608695
8108912,4,B000EF5MRM,"This video is a nicely narrated summary of the Trojans undefeated 2005 regular season - it has some great shots in the locker room featuring the coaches and players behind the scenes.

The individual game summaries are very limited however and don't always give one a great feel for the games.

As for the negative reviews by Texas fans - maybe someday the Longhorns will win 35 straight or have back-to-back Heisman winners which could provide fodder for a highlight video. Texas fans should go buy the 2006 Rose Bowl video and bask in the joy of that game.",1143244800,4,558,4.626262626262626
8108913,2,B000EF5MRM,"USC had a great team, no doubt about it, 34 straight wins, two heisman trophy winners, two straight national titles, very impressive.  However, they are NOT the greatest team of all time, despite all the ESPN bullcrap that was going on over the holidays.  The Rose Bowl game showed that USC is nowhere near being the greatest team of all time, they couldn't even their season's national championship!  Of course, no previous elite team ever had to deal with defending Vince Young, who should definitely have received the Heisman.  Anywayz, USC had a great team, and deserved to be #1 throughout the season, but they ultimately met their match in the Rose Bowl.",1142294400,,660,4.814159292035399
8108914,1,B000EF5MRM,"This item was reccomended to me yet I am a longhorns fan.  Oh well I will admit they had a good strong season, but when push came to shove they choked.",1142121600,,151,3.870967741935484
