8015784,5,B0001O3YRQ,"If you are looking for a gift for a kid, this Scooby Doo set will be really well received.  Our kids (7,6,4) will watch them as often as we will let them.  Even though the animation is crude by today's standards (I was worried it wouldn't engage them), the characters and storylines seem to be timeless in their appeal.  If you area a collector, you might want to consider the complete season 1/2 and 3",1199145600,2,402,4.333333333333333
8015785,1,B0001O3YRQ,"while not bad,these same shows can be found along with all the others on the complete 1st and 2nd season set that is out there.because of this i gave this set a 1.",1148601600,37,163,3.9696969696969697
8015786,3,B0001O3YRQ,"Overall the DVDs were good.  My 2 main complaints were that: 1) 2 of the 3 DVDs had the same episode and 2) Two of the episodes were not from the original series.  One, just had the newer beginning, and a slighlty newer tone to it, while the other had Scooby Dum in it.  The slightly newer episode was not terrible but the episode with Scooby Dum was awful.  I understood these to all be from the original series.  If they would have all been from the original series and no repeats I could have given the Colletion 5 stars.  With 4 out of the 13 episodes not what they should have been, that is 30% of the total.  Hence the 3 star rating.",1143417600,28,639,4.104838709677419
