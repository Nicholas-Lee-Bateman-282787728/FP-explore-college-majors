8366688,4,B000F9W16C,"I bought this mostly so that I would have Target Specifics with Jennifer Kries and Target Specifics Plus.  I like how those workouts are divided into 15-minute segments so that you can pick and choose which ones to do depending on how much time you have.  I also like how those two vary the moves, whereas the precision toning and sculpting videos are more focused, and to me, less engaging.  I got bored with them moving so slowly.  The others, like Dynamic Cardio, really keep you moving.  I hope that one day my coordination and dance moves improve so I can keep pace with them!",1246320000,,581,4.495238095238095
