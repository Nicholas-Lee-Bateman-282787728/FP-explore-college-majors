5093878,2,B007KFZ7ZG,"I am not sure about the other review here ... in fact, I read it a few times and ultimately found it far more entertaining than the movie itself ... wow ... watch the move, then read her review again. Maybe it was for different movie version for which the review may have been written. Cult classic? Maybe if you are a fan of Mystery Science Theatre 3000 and want to see this movie on their venue. I bought this specifically because it had Julia Landau in it and wanted to see more of her work. Sadly I was not impressed but faulted the direction and flow and screenwriting more than her part. Most of the main cast I have seen in other movies so I knew that it was not completely the fault of the actors that this movie seemed to simply fail. The filming and storyline seemed stilted and the acting of Eric Cushing even more so. I hope his other movies are better as he appears to have a long career (Since 92?) but a potentially ""ok"" movie crushed by the comic monotone over/under acting of Mr. Cushing who never seemed to be ""on target"" with the intended emotional marks of the movie. Maybe ""on target"" is a poor assessment ... he hit his lines, but the part/character he was playing was evidently rooted in some other movie (or comercial, for Anusol maybe?) ...  He is likely much better suited to the stage where such acting is sometimes a part of its charm (Like in highschool plays). Could I have done a better job mysef? Probably not, but, maybe ... I can ""read"" lines, too, and evidently that is all that was required his part. I was seriously put off by the poor acting of the main character and lackluster scene transitions. I almost turned it off in disgust ( and I like almost all movies as I watch them to be entertained, not to be a critic) but as I bought it to see Julia's work I watched it through. It may have simply been the directors' fault or the feigned attempt at period affectation that came and went without rhythm, but the movie simply lumbered like a kid jumping closely spaced mud puddles with inadequate leaps ... and frequently falling in. This movie completely missed whatever mark it was trying to hit, to include good storytelling.",1342483200,4,2165,4.399002493765586
5093879,5,B007KFZ7ZG,"Knowing the original script would be somewhat different from the original short story; the creators of this visually exquisite, superbly executed sensation have succeeded in transforming Charlotte Perkins Gilman's fine prose into a masterpiece which will more than likely, become a Cult Classic. The musical scoring is beyond hauntingly superb, driving the sequences beyond thriller limits and maintaining wonderful classical refinements. The 'reveal' ending is shockingly appropriate somehow. Though many purists of Gilman's work may find this a bit disturbing, they cannot deny that much of her work has been highly honored in this innovative film version. All contributors deserve accolades.",1336003200,6,694,5.881188118811881

5093881,1,B007KFZ7ZG,"The original story is not a horror story. Further, there is no fire in the story, and John is much less central to the narrative and does not seem to be effected much by whatever effects the narrator, who by the way has no name. The number of changes and infidelities the film contains to the original story is appalling. The crummy cinematography, sub par soundtrack and nearly worthless acting only held my attention because I wanted it so badly to be faithful to the story. It is not a ghost story, but rather a story about feminine oppression and mental health awareness. It is the story about a time in which mental disorders were not taken seriously and women, even less so. This film was not creative, it was clich, including and *especially* the ending.
I could not have been more disappointed and by watching this movie you could not waste time in a more efficient and painful manner.",1445904000,2,893,4.5875

5093883,1,B007KFZ7ZG,"This is a train wreck. It takes only the title from the Charlotte Gilman short story and develops it into a meandering mess of a film. Most of the performances are wooden, particularly lead and co author Aric Cushing, who possesses two expression he alternates through the movie. The score is so heavy handed it is laughable; how dramatic is a change in title cards? Pretty dang dramatic in the composers mind. The writing is incomprehensible. Kudos to Dale Dickey for a solid supporting performance in an otherwise bleak movie. Check out the 30 minute adaptation of the story if you need to see it.",1444867200,,599,4.714285714285714

It is re-fashioned as a total horror story, which is interesting because this is the way the original story was read by its original audience.  There are references to the short story, though, so if you are a fan of the Gilman piece, you may appreciate this aspect of the movie.

5093888,1,B007KFZ7ZG,"The thing that bothers me most about this movie is that people who see it will assume this is Gilman's actual story.  The producers are ingenuous about this, the trailer is worse.  This has nothing to do with the real horror of her story -- a woman who is trapped, mentally and physically, by her fatuous Victorian husband, and whose only release is identifying with a hallucinatory woman who creeps through the noxious yellow wallpaper of an old nursery.  The story is about the madness of a woman whose life is defined and controlled by her overweening husband.  The movie seems to be about a family that is cursed in one way or another (never was sure what that was about.)  The trailer claims the story is ""Gothic"".  Truth is, in Gilman's time, and even now, the story (the real one) is Modernist in both theme and style.",1442188800,2,825,4.54054054054054

5093894,1,B007KFZ7ZG,"I won't reveal the ""twist"" ending here....man, I sure wish I had those two hours back. I can't believe I sat through that whole movie. You'd be more entertained by sitting at staring at a wall covered with yellow wallpaper.",1433721600,2,223,4.6
5093895,4,B007KFZ7ZG,"A good movie but not great. Takes the traditional approach of supernatural movies. The time skip is just badly executed. I have watched other movies and series where time skipping is a smooth transition.

One character on one short part of the movie looked like Abraham Lincoln. His one line script is, ""You're going to burn in hell!"" That may be a satire that Lincoln is in hell.

Overall, a good movie deserving to become a member of anyone's video library.

PS. There is another movie on Amazon with similar title, http://smile.amazon.com/Yellow-Wallpaper-Alex-Childs/dp/B00L4AF5NW/ref=sr_1_1?s=instant-video&ie=UTF8&qid=1433640560&sr=1-1&keywords=the+yellow+wallpaper, but may be a different story as the preview showed a different timeline from what this movie was set on.",1433548800,,777,5.919642857142857

""What was that supposed to be?""  So out of curiousity I found the short story it was based on and read it.  I was even more confused.  The only part that remotely resembled the written story was the long lingering camera shots of the wallpaper in the attic.

5093899,5,B007KFZ7ZG,"Charlotte Perkins Gilman's story ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" is one of the most memorable of the Gothic horror tales.  While this production actually has little to do with the story as it was written, director Logan Thomas delivers a satisfying foray into the psyche that matches the effect of the tale. As it should be with full blooded gothic horror, you feel every tender nerve exposed and no neurotic stone is left unturned by the madness that follows one woman's slow descent into psychosis.  The film has a touch of Poe and, as one other reviewer noted, more than a touch of Lovecraft, but with a woman's viewpoint, as with the story.

Actor Michael Moriarty (early ""Law and Order"") appears in a sort of time warp role that somehow suits him.  Better than any production I've seen of this story, and the atmosphere was so thick with pathos and dystopia at one point that it reminded me of a virtually forgotten film I saw on videotape years ago:  ""Pate"".  This is the imdb link to the film:

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289755/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1

If anyone wants to see a Poe-esque dystopian movie, that would be the one to put on DVD.

5093910,1,B007KFZ7ZG,"Dreadful. After a few minutes I googled ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" short story plot line, thinking I misremembered it. I did not. The movie has nothing to do with the shorty story and the changes are all for the worse. Because actors who ""make it"" must have a certain level of talent, the actors in ""The Yellow Wallpaper""  were a reminder of the difference between amateurish, passable, inspired and masterful acting. These actors wouldn't have been chosen as leads in a local dinner playhouse production. How they were chosen for an actual, real life, professional movie is a puzzle. The resolution is a groaner, such a cliche in a culture that is awash in such ""supernatural"" creatures.  I kept telling myself the writers wouldn't be so lazy. But they were.
The short story had a lot of interesting psychological dynamics that could have made for a cinematic version similar to ""The Innocents."" Alas, no. Just plain silly.
The one plus was the cinematography. The creation of atmosphere was also compelling. Nothing more frightening than a creepy old house and the lighting and settings were first rate. Too bad all that was wasted on such a disappointment of a film.",1426636800,3,1165,4.878787878787879

I'll admit, I had my doubts as soon as I saw that Juliet Landau was in it (she's even worse here than as Drusilla in Buffy the Vampire Slayer).  However, she's practically Meryl Streep compared to Aric Cushing, whose  acting is on par with that of a dead rat (although, to be fair, the dead rat would probably have more facial expression and voice inflection).

If you like dead rats, some literally make an appearance in this movie as well, so there's an added draw. After watching half of this drivel, I couldn't take any more and had to turn it off.  What a shameful adaptation of a classic story.",1424822400,3,676,4.419354838709677

5093923,5,B007KFZ7ZG,"Gothic, suspenseful, haunting... this movie brings to vivid life Charlotte Perkins Gilman's late Victorian short story about one woman's descent into madness. Excellent photography, obviously direction superb, and high production values. Now, let me just say, I've seen reviews around that --in some cases-- tend to lambast the film as 'not being true to the author's intentions'... or some such. But, I would ask what these critics could possibly know of how the author would have wanted this rendered visually?

Absurd! The dear lady's been dead for 80 years! There are many ways to tell a story, especially one based upon written source material using the visual arts. You can certainly do a dry & clinical run-through of the material--- and you can also put your audience to sleep by that method ~Heh. Or you can draw the viewer into the story by, frankly-- and as was done here, putting out a terrific vision that is as dramatic as it is telling.

Absolutely stirring performances by the actors-- Bravo to every one! The real depth of this story, is, and this was the author's primary focus in life: the place of women in society. This story not only suggests other issues incredibly pertinent to today's society; such as the effects of postpartum depression, a male's 'presumed ownership' over the body & life of his wife, but also, naturally, mental illness and treatment.

It isn't a remake of the book and it isn't trying to be. Instead, it is the origin story of Charlotte and John. The performances by Aric Cushing and Juliet Landau are wonderful and fit the style and intent of the movie perfectly. The musical choices help to make the overall story that much creepier. It is not entirely realistic, and the surreal nature of the story and the style was brought out beautifully by the combination of all of the movies elements, from costuming to editing.",1423267200,,682,4.5528455284552845

5093938,4,B007KFZ7ZG,"A very short list of my favorite ghost and haunted house films has the Haunting (1963), The Uninvited (1944) and The Innocents (1961) as the touchstones. Now add the Yellow Wallpaper.

The Yellow Wallpaper is not a film of special effects or CGI. Almost none of the supernatural or metaphysical is actually shown in the movie. The Yellow Wallpaper instead plays on your own imagination, going by the theory, that what you don't see is more frightening then what you do see. If you are into seeing monsters, spooks or gore, skip this review and look else-wear. This is not the movie for you.

Not to give anything about the film away. The Yellow Wallpaper (the movie, not the book), is about three people - husband, wife and sister, who rent a house in the country. The is by necessity, as they have just lost their own home and young daughter to a fire. They arrive at their new residence, with clothes still soiled with ash from the fire. The film is up front about it being a haunting so there is nothing more to say about the plot.

The Yellow Wallpaper script may have a couple of holes and what seems to be a few illogical moments, or at least some things that can be open to interpretation but this is not concern, as the Yellow Wallpaper is a very effective ghost story.

For a ghost story, ask: does the film have atmosphere?, is it scarey?, spooky?, eerie?, Does it deliver chills?, does it hold your attention and keep you engrossed?, are the actors interesting and credible?, does the film deliver all these things while remaining realistic and minimizing special effects?  Yes, yes, yes, etc. The Yellow Wallpaper has and does all those things and sustains a sense of dread throughout its entire running time. On top of this, I counted four good jump-scares.  What more do you want in a spooky film?

The film is beautifully photographed and edited. This is the type of photography where you can see the haze of dust hanging in rooms and sun rays filtering through the drapes. There is an old feeling about the photography which is not accomplished by just tinting.  The photography and camera movements are concise and almost seems to be as proper and mannered as the antiquated Victorian behavior of the protagonists.

A note about the actors: These are not your ultra recognizable action-film actors or models. The folks playing these very normal looking people, appear and act as if they existed in an old photo. They have just lost their daughter, are therefor walk on egg shells. Their style of speech and behavior is measured, proper and almost halting which fits the middle class folks of the time period. These are people who seemed to be behaving as if this is how they imagine the next level of society above them would act. Their deliberate and proper effects makes the protagonists seem even more vulnerable. Its as if they feel that keeping a level headed, Victorian attitude will be enough to deal with any dilemma that they may find themselves in. They chose by necessity to don the previous home owners clothes (clothes from an even older time period) seems to put them even more out of sorts.

I noticed that there were quit a few one star reviews for the film stating boredom and not being scared.  This film is a mood piece and should be watched with shades drawn, the lights out, in a quite place and at night. Turn up the volume, as the excellent music and the superb sound effects are a large part of how the film delivers the atmosphere and chills. You don't want to miss the faintest creak of a floor board or the sound of the slightest breeze.  The film will not work if watched in parts or on your PC or with chattering company (you know whom I'm talking about)  Watch it alone it you can. Enjoy and be scared.

A few caveats

The end of the film throws a curve ball, and I can understand why some may not like the ending, and there are a number of scenes and plot points that I still do not understand.  Also note (other then the title and that there is something in the room behind the yellow wall paper) there is really no other shared content or meaning between this film and the book by the same name.

If you are interested in a 30 minute film that is closer to the  intent of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's  short story, I would recommend the short but effective film The Yellow Wallpaper directed by Stuart Hackshaw.  Its quite spooky in its own right and parallels the subtext of the original story.",1419984000,,4443,4.53

That's to be expected, I guess, since I think Shelley's Frankenstein is one of the most important works of Western literature, and this film at least takes a shot at the mood of Romanticism or Transcendentalism, which can be dark and frightening, violent, irrational, outright anti-rational.

Shelley is better because Frankenstein gives you a better view of the fight between early Enlightenment rationalism and Romanticism. Shelley goes straight for the God vs. the hubris of Man struggle, a subject constantly addressed in ancient Greek literature--Euripides, Sophocles, Aristotle, Socrates, Plato...those people.

That sinful modification alone should have prepped me for the mess that awaited me. The story is only tangentially related to Charlotte Perkins Gilman's material, reimagined as a meandering haunted house picture. The male lead is stiff and delivers lines with the cadence and expression of Napoleon Dynamite. His acting inexperience is awfully apparent in comparison to the more matured actors of the supporting cast. The two female leads do okay with what is given to them (with again the elder offering the better performance). The film has a softness to it that borders on blurry at times, which contrasts with the frustratingly dark scenes that I squint at with hopes of eeking out some missing details. The music cues are too loud and disjointed, seemingly used everywhere to help cover up the filmmaker's inability to tell a good story.

All in all, it's a bad movie with a supporting cast worthy of a better film.",1417824000,,1029,4.982558139534884

- We've seen some of these actors in some really good/great movies (""Alien"" ""Ed Wood"" ""Pale Rider"") so they ARE capable of competent performances, AND the original story ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" is one of the most quietly chilling depictions of a descent into madness ever written. This really should have worked.
But the original story immediately goes out the window and we get a flaccid story about a sort of parasitic house - which somehow prompts a steadily increasing procession of depressing, soporific monologues delivered in the most hangdog monotone droning ever heard outside an apiary - no - it would be far more entertaining to listen to insects buzzing and clicking at one another for over one hundred minutes.
The ""cinematography"" is sub par and unimaginative, the set design and costumes -while striving for period accuracy - don't rise above the level of poorly funded community theater. SO it isn't even interesting to look at. Below one star, this is DOA.",1414454400,2,1130,4.984126984126984

The acting, obviously on point. But it is not a ""today's"" ""horror"" movie.  In the age where TV shows are cornering the genre, movies have to work doubly hard to do the work they once did easily.

This movie however is far from the ""Teen Scream"" genre and really makes you pay attention and watch. I personally found it interesting and enjoyable. The ending was a surprise, (though you could probably figure it out before the reveal) all in all on a dreary day or a stay in movie day, if this one is on your list, give it a watch. You may like it, or you may not. But you will never know until you try it. Everyone has different taste. I don't judge based on lighting and quality of acting, story arc and directing.

It also helps that the movie doesn't throw unnecessary special effects in your face. It's very grounded in practical effects-which amplify the intensity and terror of scenes.

5094016,2,B007KFZ7ZG,"The TYW is a slow moving story about the loss of a child and the parents grappling with the aftermath of their loss. The story takes place in a leased home in another town as the couple and a sister try to start anew after the fire and the childs death.
The home is giving off a strange vibe to its new occupants from the moment they arrive.
I won't go into detail to avoid giving away to much of the story and spoil things. What I will say is that this is a slow moving story that really doesn't come together until the end and even then it doesn't reveal itself to my liking.
This is a low budgeted production with a couple fairly well known actors that couldn't help sell this story. The two lead actors performances were lets just say lacking experience. The direction was as good as the acting NOT and lacked an experienced eye and wasn't able to extract convincing performances from the cast. The writing was also lacking and didn't develop the characters very well nor tell the story in a convincing and logical manner.
Another area of major concern was the lighting or lack there of. I understand the director wanted to capture the lighting of the time period, but when you can't see much of anything what's the point of it. It didn't add any real mood or tension to the scene instead it made me strain my eyes to see what the heck was going on to no avail. The last big issue for me was the background music and its timing to induce tension and or fear in a scene. It was used so much in the first half of the movie to set a mood/tone when there was ZERO payoff in the scene. I was like the little boy who cried wolf to many times and no one believed him anymore. In the last quarter to half they figured out that they over played their hand with the music and almost stop using it for a scene setup.
Their was very little gore/blood and almost no violence and cursing and a total lack of sex and or nudity. This would be a good movie for the whole family if it wasn't so bad and boring. 2 generious stars.",1405641600,,2015,4.182519280205655

5094019,2,B007KFZ7ZG,"For the most part, this is not at all a direct adaptation of Charlotte Perkins Gillman's short story. For Logan Thomas' retelling of this story, I had a hard time getting past the horrible acting and even more so past the dramatic, choppy transitions between scenes. I think that the intent of the choppy scenes may have been to give viewers a feeling horror, being in a nightmare from which they can't wake. For instance, you're flying, suddenly you're falling, then suddenly you're being swallowed whole by an alligator with two heads. Now the two-headed alligator is your mother-in-law, she regurgitates you and after a few chews she spits you out, hurtling you through space and time. You finally find yourself naked, trying in vain to open your junior high locker to get clothing you know is in there, but you've forgotten the combination!  Oh the horror! Okay, and then there's the story line. What local residents our characters do come across impart that they're all in on a horrible secret that of course they're not willing to let our heros in on. The story flows from tedious boredom to tedious boredom to suprise intended horror back to tedious boredom. When we're finally brought to scenes that was to provide horror, there was no feeling of consistency to the nature of what horrible manifestation would ultimately ruin the young couple in the movie. It's psychosis? Or ghosts? Oh wait, now it's an evil shape shifting demon! Mangey demon dogs? Dead gladiator wandering the desert...wt??? Finally, when the real monster is revealed, it seems to me the viewer is ""supposed"" to conclude, oh yes, this makes complete sense even though there was no foundation set in the movie to ever suggest a...vampire! Worse yet, he's an extremely old coot of a vampire and he's been seated at the dinner table the whole time and no one noticed! Sorry for the spoiler. :/  Logan then inserts flashbacks to earlier scenes (sister-in-law tar-tar) that is supposed to validate the vampire-happily-ever-after ending and tie the inanity of Logan's story back to the strongest premise of movement behind the yellow wallpaper in Gillman's story. Logan's woman behind the yellow wallpaper is a vampire who opens a hidden door in an attic room each night to suck the blood out of the living and her husband is now a vampire slave, doomed to do her bidding for eternity. Genius symbolism or just plain stupid? Especially since everyone knows, attics get hot and vampires prefer the coolness of basements. Duh. Logan ends his adaptation set in the 1970's, with the ill-fated husband of our yellow wallpapered vampiress, greeting a new couple, who were apparently invited in as dinner, wearing the most ghastly polyester leisure suit ever.

It is a dark film, spooky but thought provoking.

The general gist of this is that it is based on two characters Charlotte and John, and is an origin story (rather than a remake) for the original Charlotte Perkins Gilman story. Events unfold after a life changing fire, Charlotte begins to start having visions and becomes reclusive from her husband and sister.

The excellent mysterious, spooky and dark storyline is complemented by brilliant music and wonderful actors. Some names to note are, Dale Dickey (Iron Man 3, Winter's Bone), Emmy winners, golden globe winner, and Tony winner Michael Moriarty, Veronica Cartwright.

The Yellow Wallpaper is not only chilling, but is also thought provoking and aesthetically beautiful. It depicts an accurate example of the crippling and isolating effect of depression as well as the slow creep of dread that can invade the mind. The beautiful lighting and nearly abandoned nature of the setting give an ethereal and dream-like quality to the entire film, further illustrating the haze in which the characters exist.

5094029,5,B007KFZ7ZG,"This film takes a remarkable risk for a movie these days by avoiding cgi and using an impressionist approach to lighting its gothic story. The moody, enigmatic atmosphere of this film is very unconventional for an american movie and the action and gore horror crowd may have trouble appreciating it.
The intense gothic atmosphere from the lighting, camera shots, and general cinematography is not something I have seen often in american films.
It has a lot more in common with european films. The films of Werner Herzog came to my mind. The film evoked memories of the emphasis on enigmatic and creepy mood in the movies Nosferatu and The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser. The pacing and buildup also reminded me of the classic David Bowie vampire tale The Hunger.
The unresolved questions and the unsolved mysteries are also very european. The film remains mysterious to the end and the final scenes daze and confuse more than they solve. What is real? What is dream, hallucination, haunting? Who are Eckhart van Wakefield and Burn in Hell Man? The inclusion of symbolic elements like the arid desert that needs to be crossed to get from the house to the outside world contributes to this also.
I found the cinematography to be simply beautiful. I loved the shots with darkened characters silhouetted by the light shining through windows. The extensive use natural lighting combined with filters reminded me of the films of David Hamilton.
The scene with the main character Dr. John Weiland going through the house with the candelabra as the only light is excellent and spooky.
The play of the three main actresses is bang on: Juliet Landau, whom I saw in Ed Wood, Dale Dickey, whom I remember from True Blood, Veronica Cartright, whom I've seen in a lot of movies and in the TV show Daniel Boone in the early seventies when I was a kid! In fact, Dale Dickey is positively eerie at times!
Aric Cushing has a very challenging role to deal with. A professional doctor and father who lost what is most precious to him in horrifying circumstances and has withdrawn into a sullen mood, deeply challenged to cope with what is happening around him and remain in control of himself. Not an easy thing to pull off. To his credit, he carries it off very well.
Even though he has a small role, it was also fun to see Michael Moriarty at play in this film.
The period reconstitution is convincing: costumes, make up, decors and scenery. Very good job for such a low budget. It also helps that the site and house they chose to film the movie is magnificent.
The only minor issue I had with the film was with the music and the sound mixing. Don't get me wrong, the music is very good and contributes greatly to the mood of the movie. The problem was with the intensity of the crescendos which was distracting at times, the music feeling occasionally too loud with respect to the mood set by the visuals, or the crescendo seeming unnecessarily dramatic. The scene where Dale Dickey is wiping dust from a shelf and shakes the rag is the one that stuck most to my mind. I think the music being more subdued would have worked better. The voice mixing seemed a little off also in some of the talking head scenes where it gave a TV teleplay feel.

5094031,5,B007KFZ7ZG,"Hauntingly Beautiful --

This is a film which honors patience.  It is not for those who need action-packed adrenaline stoking from beginning to end.  This is a film for those who appreciate the slow build up to terror of a classic Gothic ghost story.

The characters speak slowly in careful Victorian, but Midwestern American, English as the year is 1892.  The camera reveals scenes with a languid, sensuality.  Yet, there is a discomforting eerie quality that builds as the film progresses.  Most of the scenes are outside or within a 100-year old haunted house.  A few sequences are of a bleak landscape separating the house from town.  The sound track has a threatening undertone.  John encounters a rat-killing couple on a bicycle ride into town.  The encounter is the first of increasingly bizarre experiences that John, his wife, and sister-in-law, Jennifer have, after renting the house with yellow wallpaper.  Suspense builds, like waves, each reaching a bit higher, and the viewer's tension notches up.

The film is wonderfully atmospheric and full of symbolic allusion (e.g., town represents safety, where there is civilization, but it is cut off by desert, forest, and distant mountains, thus unattainable for those caught in the web of terror).  The stark Victorian mansion, at first, seems to offer a comforting respite for the grief-stricken family.  John and Charlotte have lost their daughter in a fire that consumed their previous house.  True to its Gothic literary antecedent, however, the house's hidden terrors slowly enrapture and capture its occupants.  The descent into terror and madness is a slow but steady incline, not a dash from a spring board.

John, a medical doctor, demands that the family maintain its rational, civilized understanding of reality and thus seek understanding of the inexplicable events that begin to occur after moving into the house.  Charlotte embraces the irrational-supernatural aura of the house as a means to reconnect with their deceased daughter.  Jennifer, the pragmatist, brings in a ""ghost-buster"" from back east.  So, what force will prevail and will the 3 survive as they approach the final horror the house dishes up?

The production is first class in all respects.  The sets appear historically accurate to the Victorian era.  The soundtrack music is wonderfully eerie and then shrieks like Psycho when the viewer's nerves are about to snap with tension.  The acting is superb by all 3 of the main characters, and the walk-ons are appropriately creepy.  The writing and direction bring to life for 21st Century viewers a classic Gothic tale of terror.

I was totally surprised by the ending (even though there were plenty of clues) but it wasn't until I read up on the original story that I could fully appreciate this re-imagining of the original.  As a writer, I have been mentally gnawing on how this movie sprang from the short story it is inspired by and I have to say I love it.  I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it (tho I am frustrated that I couldn't find an accurate write up of it anywhere so that I could compare my thoughts with the writer/creator's)so I will just say that the themes in the original story are all here, but in a parallel form.  Very clever, indeed.  I am not a huge horror fan and have never seen, for instance, The Shining.  I prefer subtler, more cerebral, eerie tales such as this one.  The photography was gorgeous, the music haunting, the sets very realistic and authentic.  I have to say I was puzzled by how wooden the acting was on the part of Aric Cushing but by the end I understood.  He was a completely different creature at the end and the difference served to highlight who Dr. Weiland had become.  The casting of Charlotte was spot on, of course.

If you've ever gone to a small art house movie theater and watched an independent film where nothing blows up, this may be the movie for you.

The film touches on several themes: Love gone wrong, tragedy, duty, faith, resignation and/or acceptance. Yes, it's Yellow Wallpaper, but it's taken a few interesting, artistic liberties from the story you know. It's gothic, it's intelligent, and it has been gorgeously filmed with a million tiny, beautiful details. Although there are a few lighter moments, overall, the film casts a shady pallor over the young couple struggling to build their lives again after a tragic loss of their daughter. The film is studded with a lot of familiar faces, such as Dale Dickey, Michael Moriarty, Raymond Barry and Veronica Cartwright -  all of whom add gravitas and undertones of grim determination. Aric Cushing could be seen by some as not emotional enough, but anyone with even the slightest knowledge of the early post-Victorian era should know that women were viewed as hysterical and unstable, while men were socially imbued to use and value restraint - and I believe you can see the struggle he carries of battling back the quietly simmering rage/pain throughout the film. Juliette Landau has just such the ability to show that sort of delicate old-world demeanor valiantly failing to find the strength she desperately needs to heal.

5094047,4,B007KFZ7ZG,"I was initially exposed to Gilman's haunting short story by the same name in an undergraduate class on American Gothic literature, and have been a fan ever since.  However, for those potential viewers that are looking for a faithful recreation of the original written work, you will not find it here... nor should you.  I can appreciate a contemporary artist using Gilman's writing as a jumping off point to create an entirely new piece as opposed to remaining confined within the purview of historical intentions.  Some of the best film adaptations of novels/short stories have taken such liberties with the foundational texts to great success, ""The Shining"" would be a good example.  Though this film is certainly not a Kubrick, the director has done interesting things with what is essentially an epistolary format.

Gilman's feminist intentions also remain intact which brings me to the character of Dr. Weiland, a subject that seems to be generating a lot of discussion in reviews.  The portrayal of Dr. Weiland has been described as ""wooden"" by several reviewers, but it would seem that this is by design, no?  Most viewers of the film have been subject to acting that can be characterized as a form of ""Realism,"" and if the film is viewed through this lens it can be a dimished experience.  Because of the somewhat surreal nature of the editing, script, and mise-en-scene, it would seem to me that Dr. Weiland's character is more of a symbolic representation of a conception of an idealized masculinity, an emotionless figure that is steeped in reason and duty.  His character provides the complementary framework from which the portrayal of Charlotte Weiland (and Jennie Gilman and Catherine Sayer) stand out.

But as the first scenes played themselves out I was completely captivated by this sad and beautiful rendering of a classic story.  So much of this was part dream, part real.  There are scenes laid out so perfectly that I know they will stay in my mind forever.  The camera angles, the smoke and the shadows, the light and the dark, the period clothing, the haunting music.  I think the most riveting scene for me personally may be the carriage scene.  There is this rush of wheels and dust and air and John and Charlotte are holding onto one another sobbing.  This sets the tone for the rest of the movie--this heavy weight of misery that hangs over every moment--which the actors portray to perfection.  Aric Cushing's character, who has just lost his child in a devastating fire, behaves in a sort of trance like state.  He attempts to establish some sort of normalcy as all the world falls apart before his eyes.  Juliet Landau, who plays Charlotte, is slowly coming undone as she wiles her time away in the attic writing what may be one of the most famous ghost stories of all time.  Both of them straying between two worlds hoping to find some way to be with their daughter once again.  It's as if they have found the intersection between life and death.

I have to admit I had a feeling there would be no happily ever after for these people.  The ending definitely took me by surprise though (and I won't ruin it for you!).  It will take you deep into your worst nightmare and make you wonder...hmmmm...so what did happen to Charlotte?!

I loved this movie.  There is nothing else to compare it to.  It's exquisitely presented, creative, frightening, and pretty classy.  It's the perfect film rendering of a gothic horror story.",1344729600,41,1909,4.575221238938053
5094049,2,B007KFZ7ZG,"First, I want to say that more than anything, this movie is just plain sad.  It is a case study for how to take beautiful material, and completely destroy it.

The first mistake the filmmakers made, was to not be faithful to the excellent classic short story by of the same name by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.  Had they actually made a movie that was faithful to her excellent work, then this movie might not have turned out so awful.  In the end, they included just enough references to the short story, (such as character names, the title, the daughter, etc.) to cash in on the fame of the short story, but changed enough of the storyline, (making the husband the central character and the pathetic ending) to make the movie horrible.

While not all bad, the bad portions so completely overwhelm the good, that you will find yourself wondering why you wasted the time.

The Good:
1.  The performances by the females....especially Juliet Landau, who would have been perfect if the movie had actually been a faithful representation of the short story. There are some great actors in this film.....Juliet Landau, Veronica Cartwright, Michael Moriarty and Dale Dickey.  They deliver subtle yet thoughtful performances and  all do as well as they possibly could have, considering the bad writing.  By the end of the film I felt sorry for them.
2.  The cinematography is beautiful and appropriate for the film.  Especially the backlit scenes.

The Bad:
1.  The disjointed and irrelevant scenes.  Particularly the duel and desert scenes, which don't fit the film, provide no explanation, and add nothing to the story.
2.  The predictable ""easy way out"", and disappointing ending.  So much time is spent building the suspense that the ending is fairly anticlimactic.
3.  The music is completely over the top, melodramatic, and just plain bad.  So bad in fact, that at times it is laughable.  It desperately tries to create a sense of fear and suspense, building to an almost manic crescendo, then cuts to a sunny scene of the front of the house.  It does this sort of thing so often, that when it comes to a scene that might truly be scary, the music is now ineffective and you have learned to ignore it.

The Ugly:
1.  The truly horrible job of the lead actor, Aric Cushing.  He must be one of the worst actors I have ever seen, and delivers a performance so deadpan and uninspired that anyone off the street could have done better. Compound this with the fact that he is not only the main character, but also the narrator. I couldn't figure out how he got the part until I read on IMDB that he is also credited as Executive Producer. Ahhhhh....that explains a lot.
2.  The disjointed nature of the movie.  The filmmakers took just enough details from the short story to intrigue you, yet change enough of the movie to make it seem like they were just capitalizing on the fame of the short story.  Case in point - the title.  The Yellow Wallpaper, you would imagine, would at least have a role in the story, but it seems that these scenes were cut out.  In fact, it seems like the movie was supposed to be one concept, and that they changed it midway through....hence the duel and desert scenes, which almost seem to be added as filler.  The choice to focus on the husband as the main character, especially when portrayed by such an inept actor, is extremely disappointing.

Despite the questionable glowing reviews, I invite you to see it for yourself, and judge whether what I say is true....if you can stay awake.",1344643200,6,3509,4.656910569105691
