Second, the instructor had no clue how to present a DVD Pilates course. She seemed to assume that everyone is double jointed as when she would rotate her arms from front to the back of her body. This REALLY bugged me. She made no modifications for people of different Pilates fitness levels and had no sort of pacing for her exercises which were either too fast or too slow. Her explanation on Kegel exercises again was VERY poor as her directions were the most complicated I have EVER heard for doing kegel exercises. If I thought I knew where they were before, I have no clue where they are now after her explanation. I wish there were some reviews out there before I bought this crap.
On a whole, I just thought the DVD was not very professional and showed how little able the presenter could teach what she did know.",1241395200,8,967,4.468926553672317
