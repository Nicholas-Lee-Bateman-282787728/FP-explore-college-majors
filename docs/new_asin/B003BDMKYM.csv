8393520,1,B003BDMKYM,"The 'documentary' Heavily Censors the most important facts about the HomoAnal Coprophile / Pederast roots and Leadership of the nazis, in a chilling and cravenly politically correct manner that is itself reminiscent of Nazi Propaganda.

The well established Facts about Ernst Rohm (founder of the nazi party and leader of its Homosex Terrorist Storm Troopers) and the other leaders of the nazi movement - that they were almost exclusively butch HomoAnal Coprophiles...,

- and that Rohm (notorious for his penchant for BoyRape and Consuming Excrement as a 'sex act') was not only Hitler's (""Du"" buddy) Mentor - but Coprophile lover as well; and that their threatened exposure of Hitler as a Homosex Pervert (and that Eva Braun was just window dressing to cover up the fact) was an important factor in the assassination of Rohm and other of Hitler's Boyfriends.

Amazingly the video on the Gestapo fails to mention Homosexuality at all, despite this being a Central Characteristic that Rohm looked for in Storm Trooper Recruits (see author Johan Hari, ""The Strange Strange Story of the Gay Fascists"") - because Rohm thought such perverts made the best Thugs for Brutalizing others in to submission.
However, later episodes will mention the alleged targeting of Homosexuals for internment in the Concentration Camps after Rohm's death, while carefully avoiding mention that it was mostly Homosexuals who founded and ran the camps.

What is Heavily Censored about the Camps (Dachau was opened under Rohm's SA control) is that after the ""night of the long knives"" - when one Homosex Pederast gang (Hitler and his SS) triumphed over the other (Rohm and his SA) - the first internees in the camps with the ""homosexual Triangle"" were Storm Troopers still loyal to Rohm (called ""Rohm's Avengers"")...
- and their Homosexual Designated Triangle was originally Brown (like the Brown Shirts of the SA) and wasn't changed to pink until later.

Hence - the fact that the Frist ""homosexuals"" interned in the nazi camps were SA Storm Troopers still loyal to their Coprophile Pederast leader Rohm - is just a little too much Reality for our carefully sanitized 'history' channel, who know who to pander to - just like their predecessors.

So Why Censor the Truth about the HomoAnal BoyRapist who were the Nazi Leadership - particularly given the parallels between that time and the Current age of Abomination that has also sold out its Military to Homosex Activists - I think Orwell had some insight about such Censorship:

""Not merely the validity of experience but the very existence of outside reality was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense."" George Orwell 1984 On the Thought Police",1314662400,3,2710,5.09009009009009
