1631706,5,B00005NFL9,"As I am still floating from watching Colin Firth swanker through the snow to 'claim his woman', every man should own a full lenght cashmere coat like that, shouldn't they ?. Not only was Bridget Jones brillant as a diary but is absolutely fabulous on the big screen, giving hope to all thirty something 'singleton's' that there is hope for them yet!
Although I could not fault the performances of the actors I could not help feeling that some of the original 'Britishness', if there is such a word, was missing from that of the book. But still none the less this was a truely five star performance by Renne Zellwegger, as well as the stunning Hugh Grant and the delicious Colin Firth who had never appealed to me before possibly because of all those tight trousers and bushy side-burns he had to adorn in the many period dramas that he starred in, but I certainly left the cinema (the British 'movies') feeling all warm inside. I have seen the film twice now and if anyone wants to go again then give me a shout !!!",988761600,2,1015,4.462365591397849
1631707,3,B00005NFL9,"I had a horror of enduring yet another Richard Curtis/Hugh Grant soft sell of bright New Labour England, but this is surprisingly agreeable, less for its prosaic filming than its insight into character - e.g. the steely cruelty behind Bridget's nice dad when he takes her mother back.  The diary form obviously couldn't have been reproduced without being cinematically stilted - the film finds an equivalent by colouring the film's world with Bridget's subjectivity, so that every scene is brilliantly over-exaggerated from her point of view, negatively and positively.  The result of this is that the hapless Bridget is always in control, shaping and telling her own story, to the point where she becomes the active, normally male, agent, in this romantic comedy.  Hugh Grant is dastardly good fun, Colin Firth is strikingly wooden, but the great surprise is game Renee Zellweger, proving once again that only Americans can really play British women.  Ahem.",988329600,5,958,5.201298701298701
1631708,5,B00005NFL9,"Dissatisfied at age 32 with the direction her life is taking, a young woman vows to make some changes, and to keep herself on track she decides to start a daily journal, hoping it will make her toe the line, in ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" directed by Sharon Maguire and starring Renee Zellweger.  Bridget (Zellweger) begins with some New Year's resolutions that include no more drinking or smoking, not being paranoid about her weight, and developing poise.  And-- last, but not least-- to avoid any romantic attachments to alcoholics, workaholics, peeping Toms or perverts.  Of course she promptly falls for the one man she knows who embodies all of those characteristics:  Her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).  In the meantime, her mother, Pam (Gemma Jones), continues to play matchmaker for her daughter.  At a holiday gathering of friends and family, Pam nudges her in the direction of an old childhood chum, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), now a respectable attorney, and recently divorced.  Their initial meeting, however, proves to be a less than monumental event, further complicated by the fact that Cleaver was Darcy's Best Man at his wedding, and has some tales-out-of-school to tell about the subsequently ill fated marriage that puts Darcy in a rather bad light.  But Bridget could care less; she thinks Darcy is rude and a bore, and anyway, Daniel is her guy.  Work is good, her life is going well and-- as she is about to wake up and realize-- she hasn't kept a single one of her resolutions.  And, oh! she should have.
 First time director Maguire proves with this auspicious debut that she certainly knows her territory and how to negotiate it.  She has the touch and the eye for detail of a seasoned professional, and her sense of timing is impeccable.  She successfully avoids a major pitfall that do in many rookie directors right out of the chute, by never fishing for the cheap, forced, disdainfully pretentious or concocted laugh.  Everything in this film, especially the humor, flows freely and naturally from the circumstances of the characters and the story, which makes it all real and believable and allows it to be readily embraced by the audience.  This is a funny, often hilarious movie, but it's also very warm and at times poignant, and for handling it so sensibly, and with such sensitivity, Maguire deserves to be granted even more kudos.  It's quite simply an exceptionally well made film, presented with a style and grace that reflects that of the director herself.
 Of course, having a superlative leading lady was certainly not disadvantageous to Maguire's efforts, either, and Renee Zellweger has never been better than she is here as Bridget.  With her quirky good looks, personality and charisma, she is endearing, and she invades Meryl Streep territory by affecting a perfect British accent.  Whether she's lip-syncing to a Celine Dion song, doing karaoke at an office party after having a bit too much to drink, or battling with a blender, it's easy to believe that someone would like her just the way she is.  Even with her hair mussed, or in a somewhat disheveled state, she's alluring, and it all has to do with who she is deep down inside; Zellweger makes it clear that this is a woman of substance, and it's easy to like her.  There's a down-to-earth honesty and accessibility about her that makes her appealing, and she's someone to whom many in the audience are easily going to be able to relate.  For her portrayal of Betty in ""Nurse Betty,"" Zellweger received a Golden Globe; ""Bridget"" should land her smack in the middle of Oscar territory.
 As Bridget's smarmy boss, Daniel, Hugh Grant turns in a noteworthy performance, putting a rather tarnished sheen on his natural charm that works so well for this character.  It's a nice departure from his usual bumbling, reserved Mr. Nice Guy routine he perfected in such films as ""Notting Hill,"" and ""Four Weddings and A Funeral.""  With this role he challenges Greg Kinnear's part in ""Someone Like You"" for the top spot in the Boss-You-Should-Never-Date category.  And Firth does a memorable turn as Darcy, fairly reprising his role of the same name in the PBS miniseries, ""Pride and Prejudice,"" from which this story is loosely derived.  Initially appearing a bit sullen, he gets the chance to develop his character as the story unfolds, and he does it quite nicely, ultimately revealing Darcy's true nature.
 In a supporting role, Gemma Jones gives a performance that deserves mention, doing a good job of fleshing out Bridget's mother in the brief time she is allotted.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Crispin Bonham-Carter (Greg), Jim Broadbent (Colin Jones), James Callis (Tom), Sally Phillips (Shazzer), Honor Blackman (Penny), Embeth Davidtz (Natasha), Shirley Henderson (Jude) and Celia Imrie (Una).  A warmly humorous, uplifting film, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is a delightful and satisfying experience with more than a touch of magic in it.  Not only is it an entertaining showcase for Zellweger's many talents, but heralds the arrival of a director from whom we can expect great things in the future, Sharon Maguire.  A well crafted, reality based comedy/drama that is enjoyable and refreshingly devoid of inane nonsense or gross jokes is a rare find these days, and this is one of the best to hit the screen in a long, long time.  It's a film to be heartily embraced, and one I guarantee you'll want to see more than once.",988070400,82,5428,4.923161361141602
1631709,4,B00005NFL9,"If you have read the book, do not go into the movie with any expectations about it. I'd say that it was ""loosely"" based on the book. ""Barely"" based, actually. The characters were the same, but the events in the movie definitely were not. They either made up completely new situations, or condensed about six months worth of entries in Bridget's diary into one scene.
Bridget's neuroticism (which sort of makes the book so funny) is replaced by a sort of down-to-earth quality, which was very strange for me to come to terms with. Bridget in the film is really determined to become a strong individual and has a few ephiphanies. It's very much at odds with Bridget-in-the-book's whole superficial self-help obsession. Bridget in the film is charming. Renee Zellweger plays her as a funny, charming woman who doesn't realize how appealing she really is. There is not a hint of Bridget's quirky self-obsession after the cringe worthy opening credits.
Bridget's mom in the film was a frumpy hostess on an on-air shopping channel as opposed to being a talk show host, and there was nothing about her legal trouble either, which is a pretty important part of the book. It just wasn't the same at all. I guess I liked the book a lot more than I realized, to feel so strongly about this.
Colin Firth was amazing. I'm not one to fall for characters or movie stars, but he just knocked me out. His Mark Darcy was incredibly appealing and likeable.
I guess the major problem I had with the film is I *liked* the characters. I could sympathize with them, which I could not do while reading the book. I wasn't ready for them to be happy on screen.
Anyway, if you go see it, and have read the book, beware. It's definitely worth seeing, but there are some huge changes.",987984000,4,1755,4.592356687898089
1631710,5,B00005NFL9,"I had great expectations for ""Bridget Jones's Diary, and, boy, were they met.  I absolutely loved this it!  In fact I saw it on Saturday evening with my mom, then the next day, when I already had plans to see a movie with my aunt, the natural choice was to see good ol' Bridget again.  I think this performance by Renee Zellweger ranks right up their with her's in ""Nurse Betty.""  And, of course, their are two more huge attractions in it.  Those being, of course, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth.  Hugh makes a fabulous bad-boy and should play one more often.  I must admit that I've had a crush on Colin Firth ever since he played Mr. Darcy in P&P, and I'm happy to say my affection for him has only grown after seeing him as Mark Darcy.  ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is the funniest movie I've yet seen this year.  Truly.",987984000,8,814,4.302631578947368
1631711,5,B00005NFL9,"I cannot rave enough about 'Bridget Jones' Diary'! It is so marvelous that finally there is a woman conveyed on film who's got a real body and has problems she's trying to control, and she can still get the man of her dreams.
Renee Zellweger does excellent as a thirty-two year old singleton who is having problems with cigarettes, alcohol, and men. Her mother is constantly trying to set her up and the latest is Mark Darcy, who has recently gotten a divorce. But Bridget has other ideas and is soon flirting with her boss (not to mention making a total fool of herself, but that's why we love Bridget!)
Nonetheless, the story is very sweet and enduring. And it is HILARIOUS! I haven't laughed this much at a movie since 'Meet the Parents'. I just loved the fact that this movie had a smart heroine who wasn't afraid to mess up and to just be herself. And it's nice to finally see Hugh Grant as a real bad guy instead of his usual roles. And I loved Colin Firth. This movie is definately a must-see! Bridget rocks!",987724800,25,1015,4.404255319148936
1631712,3,B00005NFL9,"This movie definitely has its moments. As a Washington Post critic so brilliantly put it:"" any movie where Hugh Grant gets punched in the face is definitely worth seeing"". That's a guy opinion, of course. As for us girls: HG is even more attractive as the scoundrel in this movie than he is in his usual mister-nice-guy role. The nice-guy slot in this movie is filled by Colin Firth, who does a stellar job as the dorky, stiff upper-lip, akward, but good-looking and as we find out weird but good-hearted ""top barrister"". He grows on Bridget and us in the audience like a very slowly rising yeast dough. As for Bridget: Rene Zellweger does a surprisingly wonderful job as the porky, chain-smoking, self-pitying british middle-class single girl who says the wrong things in the wrong places. The real weakness of this movie is that plot and  general concept seem to borrow heavily from the previous successes of this very successful British film team: Notting Hill and 4 Weddings. There is the slightly to very off-beat cast of characters, there is the odd couple getting together under the worst of circumstances as far as British social protocol is concerned, and there is the madatory happy end. In Bridget's case another weakness is that none of the characters really pulls you in and there is that spark that puts it all together. It is a movie of good moments, some great laughs and very solid acting, but an overall mediocricy that pulls it down to 3 star or matinee ticket level.",987638400,,1486,4.737451737451737
1631713,5,B00005NFL9,"I just returned from seeing the film, and I must say that I was NOT at all disappointed. Although I heard all the adulation piled upon the film, there was a lingering worry in my mind that it might turn out to be just another tedious romantic comedy. In fact, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is a breath of fresh air, resurrecting the romantic-comedy genre, pulling it out of realm of The Typical.
First and foremost, the beautiful Rene Zellweger is a very gifted comedic actress. Her timing, her adorable facial expressions, and her willingness to let go and immerse herself in a role are all evident in ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" I doubt another actress could have played Bridget with such charm and abandon. Zellweger allows the audience to peak into Jones's life without any reluctance, from exposing less-than-perfect legs to wearing a bunny outfit. Also of important mention...her accent! She carried the English accent brilliantly. After a while, I forgot she was American and completely believed her.
Hugh Grant, usually known as the ""good guy,"" does a 180 degree turn here, playing the slimey jerk that is Daniel Cleaver to perfection. Handsome? Yes. Insulting? Absolutely. And every moment he is on screen is an entertaining one. Colin Firth, of whom I've never heard, also turns in a dramatic and terrific performance as Mark Darcy, the arrogant and contemptuous man who seems to pop up throughout the film. He plays off the hard-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside bit quite well. It is without doubt that American audiences will be seeing more of him in the near future!
The best part is, this is a film you can watch again and again. The moments are often hilarious (the actors, fortunately, seem to be genuinely enjoying themselves), the jokes delivered sharply, and the pacing is near perfection. Most importantly, audiences can relate. Run-of-the-mill comedy it is not! Run to the bloody theatre now!",987292800,5,1906,5.034810126582278
1631714,5,B00005NFL9,"I just got back from seeing a sneak preview of this movie and... It was hilarious, having never read the book, I wasn't sure what to expect and since my ticket's were free, I said what the heck and went and watched it.  It was really well written, acted, directed, although a little predictable, but the story was strong enough otherwise to carry it over the weak moments.  Everyone involved did a great job, women will (as happend in the theater I was in) probably find it funnier than men, but as I said I loved it, so what more do you need, go see it.",986428800,2,554,4.216981132075472

The main character is stupid, substandard, and ungrateful, and if you think propaganda is too strong a word look at all of the reporters that we have today who, even if they did go to Oxford or have a law degree you'd never know by the completely stupid things that come out of their mouths.

1631894,5,B00005NFL9,"Not very often do I say that the movie was better than the book, but I do in the case of ""Bridget Jones' Diary.""

While the book was okay -- can't remember if I reviewed it yet, but I'd give it three stars -- I really can't figure out how someone was able to adapt the story into this great movie, which I've watched more times than I can remember. I'm a huge P & P fan, and I just feel that the movie portrayed the relationship between Bridget and Mr. Darcy much better than the book. In fact, in the book, I kept skimming, wondering, ""Where's Mr. Darcy?""

The movie ending was so much better, too; although, I can see where the author was going for her version of Lydia running off with Mr. Wickham in the book, using Bridget's mom and Mr. Tangerine.

Anyway, the movie is a hoot, definitely worth a watch! Renee Zellweger does a wonderful job. By the time you get to the end, you're rooting for a happily ever after, one of the reasons I'm not sure if I want to see the new release. I just can't imagine that Bridget has more doubts.",1474761600,2,1036,4.17

1632015,2,B00005NFL9,"I was surprised this movie was really bad overall. First, the movie does not come across as one full of contrived characters. It really does have a lot of contrived characters in the movie that you normally find in darker comedies. The actors almost look like in their scenes, ""Is this character really going to say this? I must make the whole character even more paranormal for this funny movie full of contrived scenes!"" I think that is usually a sign of an annoying movie and it happens all over this movie all the time. I do enjoy some movies with contrived notions of characters like ""Ace Ventura, Pet Detective"" as an example but in this movie it definitely isn't what you are looking for when you are expecting a cute romantic movie with a focus on romance and some insecurity.

The other part of the movie that was very annoying was the way the movie seemed to really overly dumb down the main character Bridget. However, I could not believe how really loathsome the character Darcy is to say the least! I felt sorry for Bridget Jones at the end of the movie and was not familiar with the story at all before this so I have no preferences for how the characters were supposed to be according to Jane Austin. In all honesty, I have watched many romantic comedies and never really thought to myself, ""How in the world is this male going to win the heart of the protagonist by the end of the movie?"" I also honestly think that the character of Darcy is really so bad that I think there have really been loads of men in their thirties watching this movie who have thought, ""That man is not really acting much like a real romantic taker."" Yes, I trust the general population of men for all their good or their bad to overall have a large component thinking to themselves that Darcy is a failed romantic to say the least. Darcy reminded me of the failed members of my family who I would not really want to talk to at a family reunion, and if Bridget Jones had any ""pride"" she never would have spoken to him again after the first few encounters in this stupid movie. Honestly, it is not even realistic. In all circles of American friendship, if you really want to hint at someone that you do not like them, and especially if you are more attractive than they are (ahem, Bridget), usually they would give up on you and do worse if you just said something like you did not like them with only hints. In this movie, at odds with all American psychology and probably modern British as well, when Bridget learns that Darcy now likes her he is basically delivering an atom bomb of American distrust as he starts talking about her flaws and then tells her he really likes her before running to return to his real relationship circle! In my opinion based on many professional and personal American relationships, I would only tolerate without passive insults such a character going from ""I despise you"" to the ""love me forever"" romantic standoff if the person was unquestionably a weird crazed idiot who I knew I would never talk to again and only sees me in a coffee shop who is totally random insanity! In American life, when someone says something like that in the same given conversation, nobody would question they are snake venom in the very least if they are all grown up. I think if the same movie was done in America I would definitely not have watched the movie at all. However, I did give it a small boring afternoon and I must say I am very glad I watched it as a last resort for entertainment when I was having a short day at home alone. I think it deserves more than one star overall because it can be a little funny even though most of the characters are really contrived and too pathetic to be mostly likable. I also enjoyed watching British culture in some of the scenes. Other than that, in the world of never ending feminist bashing, I think it is a little sad that the movie was made at all in the hedonist world focused on the constant dumb-downing of all women to say the least! Save your money for a less pathetic movie, please.",1461801600,,4044,4.420911528150134

1632039,4,B00005NFL9,"Bridget Joness Diary is a charming, witty movie adaptation of a best-selling book. It tells the story of a year in the life of 32 year old Bridget Jones. At the start of the New Year she decides to keep a diary and take control of her life. The movie follows her perpetually awkward and hilarious journey as she attempts to lose weight, stop drinking and smoking, and, most prominently, get her love life together.
 Renee Zellweger, a skinny Texan, was not the obvious choice for a plump, British office-worker but, to her credit, put on 20 pounds and pulled off the role quite nicely and with a fairly good British accent. She put a constant look of confusion on her face and mumbled certain lines with the perfect amount of awkward to make the audience both cringe and relate. Her performance was charming and let the audience imagine themselves in the role. Similarly, Colin Firth, who played Mark Darcy, used stiff posture and little eye contact at the beginning of the movie to convey Darcys propriety and sense of discomfort around Jones. Near the beginning, Jones overhears him insult her and it puts the two at odds through a good portion of the movie. Hugh Grant plays Joness flirtatious boss, Daniel Cleaver. Grant was perfect as the devilish, sexist man that Jones cant seem to stay away from. Hes mastered his smolder and talks and moves with the perfect suavity. The acting of one of the most unexpectedly strong ensemble casts Ive ever seen brings this movie to new heights and makes it a must-see. The cast as a whole was a very dependable bunch and made it difficult to dislike the movie, despite the not-so-original plot.
 Over the whole movie was the constant, sassy narration of Jones in her diary. The lighthearted, witty commentary was just the touch of freshness the movie needed to keep it from being a been-there-done-that type of story. The commentary was helpful in adding perspective, as well as many snarky or self-deprecating comments. Jones recorded her weight, alcohol intake, and cigarette intake as well as her comments on the events in her life. These comments gave us a peek into exactly what Joness brain was screaming during those painfully awkward moments,
 The soundtrack added much to the film. Often times it was more than just background music, it was hilarious commentary on the goings on of the movie along with setting the mood for each specific scene. For example, during a scene of a dramatic fist fight over Joness affection, Its Raining Men lightens the mood and adds an air of comedy and whimsy to the scene. There were many moments like that one where the film laughed at itself for you and made it different enough from other rom-coms to be refreshing and enjoyable.
 The film is jam-packed with scene after scene of brilliant direction and comedic timing. The awkward silences are deafening and the jerky timing only adds to the realness and the audiences secondhand embarrassment. The characters developed quite nicely over the course of the film, discovering new things about themselves and each other.
 Bridget Joness diary pushed past the odd casting of the lead and the semi-unoriginal plot to become a surprisingly witty, charming, and heartwarming film. Led by an amazing cast with some hilarious direction and good comedic timing, it never took itself too seriously and was the perfect amount of fun, funny, and romantic for any audience. The screen adds fresh, new elements to an already best-selling book, proving once again that translation from book to film is not only possible, but can have incredible outcomes.",1456185600,,3578,4.8686371100164205

1632092,5,B00005NFL9,"I didn't care for the book, but I really enjoyed the movie.  One of the rare instances where the film is better than the book.

I really like Rene Zellwegger in this role.  She has proved herself to be a very competent actress.  I actually thought she was weak, overwhelmed by the other actors in Jerry McGuire, especially Regina King.  But she was sweet and endearing, and I can see why people fell in love with her.

Rene Zellwegger is just right as Bridget Jones.  She is not beautiful, but she is quirky and sharp.  Her infatuation with Daniel Cleaver is understandable, because there is a sexy charm to Hugh Grant's character.  Of course, he is a cad, and Mark Darcy/Colin Firth initially makes a poor showing.

We know all of Bridget Jones's faults and vices, but we still sympathize with her and like her.  Best of all, we can understand why Mark Darcy would like her - just the way she is.  She is a breath of fresh air, great fun, and ultimately a good person.

I like Bridget Jones's friends, and I liked Bridget Jones's gutsiness.  This is a great film.  And Rene Zellwegger was a great part of this film's charm.",1436572800,,1124,4.4411764705882355

Swept off her feet by her charming boss, she is totally knocked out when she discovers he is not exactly the man he has portrayed himself to be. A handsome and brilliant childhood friend enters her life . . . somewhere along the line charming boss and childhood friend have known one another and have had a terrible falling out over another woman.

1632118,4,B00005NFL9,"I'm bad with chick flicks.  Despite being a chick, I tend to avoid them due to the condescension I'm sure to endure if I actually happen to like one of them. That being said, I really liked Bridget Jones's Diary.

Yes, I admit it is a futile battle.  The Notebook, Love Actually, Mean Girls, Pretty in Pink, She's All That - need I go on?  If it has charm and humor (bonus points for a gooey, feel-good ending), I'm sold.  So I figured it was high-time that I ripped off the band-aid and watched Diary, especially after falling head-over-holiday-heels in love with Love Actually during the Christmas season of 2013.

And, of course, I was proven wrong yet again.  This film was incredibly charming and warm, so much so that I'm still smiling about it a week later.  I try to keep a more casual film-watching atmosphere here (like picking a Redbox film for a weekend sleepover, as opposed to watching it for film class and obsessing over who created it and why), but I had to look up the creators of this film to see if they had also made Love Actually (yep), because it had the same feel, almost as if Love Actually and Picture Perfect (the Jennifer Aniston dud that I also happened to like) had a baby.

Quick observation: I know it's a style choice that keeps in line with the character's personality, but seeing ""Jones's"" on the title card (as opposed to the correct ""Jones'"") drove me insane.  Props to Amazon for fixing it in their description - correct title be damned!

Anyway, time to take off the Grammar Nazi cap and put on the Pseudo-Movie Reviewer beret.

Firstly, I can't be alone in thinking that casting for this film was puzzling.  It's a British film starring British actors, made by British folks.  Hugh Grant?  British.  Colin Firth?  British.  Renee Zellweger?  Texan.  Uhh, talk about needing an American lead to sell a film, but Zellweger did such a great job convincing me that she could really be British that I'll forgive and forget.  And, to be honest, it's hard for me to imagine an actress who could be more cutesie-awkward than Zellweger, so this role was meant for her.

Hugh Grant may be a cad for what he did to Elizabeth Hurley all those years ago, but by gum, he knows how to work a camera.  Despite having a mop of hair that borders on comical here, he has mastered the art of playing a character who is effortlessly sexy and devastatingly charming - so much so that you're glad you don't know him in real life...because you'd be in real trouble if you did.

Colin Firth has no personality here until it matters, which is essentially the third act of the film, and then you too find yourself falling for the shy guy in the corner who was wearing the reindeer sweater that his mum bought for him and who happens to, oddly enough, show up at every single event you attend.  Stalker much?  Or just weird coincidence?  I'm going with the former - that was just way too many coincidences.

Anyway, there are the same old cliches here that are typical for rom-coms, like how the girl decides to be an independent woman after being cheated on by a jerk, only to throw all 0f that out the window the second a new, halfway decent guy shows up.  Or how Mr. Right proves his superiority over Mr. Right Now because the former loves Painfully Awkward Girl just the way she is.  (Though, to be fair, this Mr. Right Now never demanded that Painfully Awkward Girl change the way she was to please him; she did those things on her own.  She just no longer felt the need to fake it for Mr. Right.)

Despite the fact that Bridget Jones's Diary would never pass the Bechdel test, it still makes for warm entertainment that ranks right up there with hot fudge sundaes and bubble baths as comfort devices for the jilted female (or vodka, if you're an edgier chick like Jones - ya know, in your granny panties).

While many would rank Bridget's bunny outfit as being perhaps her most outrageous frock in the film, I was particularly tickled with how she showed up to work in see-through clothes to grab her boss' attention.  Ballsy!  And then when she tells him off in front of the office before she quits, with her co-worker's support, well you can practically hear Donna Summer's ""Bad Girls"" backing her up.

As far as fight scenes go, Bridget Jones has one of the funniest brawls in the history of romantic comedy.  Imagine two British guys fighting, and that's exactly what you get here, complete with over-the-top hilarity involving being inadvertently sucked into an impromptu birthday celebration, only to be promptly thrown through a window.  This scene ranked right up there with Hot Fuzz's in terms of unexpectedly excellent climaxes that forced you to sit up and pay attention.  Good stuff.

The dialogue between Firth and Grant leading up to the fight is equally hysterical.  It's like they brought in a new crew of writers just to write those two scenes, and they are fantastic.

And I like the misdirection regarding the ending of the film.  Just when you think everything's going to be sunshine and roses, Mark (Firth) finds Bridget's diary - with like, 10 minutes left to go!  What the hell happens now?  The resolution is a bit cheesy and hard to believe, but it's romantic so screw it, I'm going along with it.

The lesson we all walk away with here is one that's as old as time: be true to yourself, and the nice guy will find you once you stop looking.  Ya know, even if said nice guy seems like a creepy stalker at first.  Hollywood says that's ultimately better than having your heart broken by the hot guy.  Not gonna lie - I'd gladly steep in hot fudge and vodka later on to nurse a heart broken by the hot guy, especially if the hot guy has a British accent and a bigger head of hair than mine.",1431648000,,5731,4.496131528046422

Now I'm not picky, you could have a bottle of Merlot, a bottle of champagne, a bottle or 5 of beer, or go the route I took and just jump right in with a bottle of vodka. While first perplexed by some of the British-ness you too will soon find yourself laughing at sweet and funny Bridget and her woes. You will fall in love with both of she British British male leads (whose names are possibly Hugh something and Collin something??) as Bridget hates on men you too will hate on men. Are you in a silly fight with a significant other?? Bridget will soon have you downing bottles of liquor and smoking your way to 20 pounds lighter and an avid journal keeper! Now the problem comes at the end- once Bridget gets her man (Collin or Hugh possibly, not sure on the names at all, frankly.) you will wish you'd chosen your boyfriend over that bottle of vodka, so beware not to make any unreasonable life decisions whilst in the middle of the plot line!

I never felt so assaulted by poor writing, weak acting and trashy language.  No way Id care to watch this with my wife or daughteror anyone else for that matter. What a waste.

No, I cant at all recommend this film. One Star only for BJD.

He is the perfect romantic interest (for me!) and the reason why I have watched this film too many times to count! He is so suave and sexy.

off!""), my favorite actress (Renee Zellwegger), who stole the show in
EVERY show she's ever been in (e.g., ""Chicago"", ""Jerry McGuire"", ""Cold
Mountain"", et. al.), and what is probably the BEST synchronized
soundtrack to screenplay ever put together for the big screen.  Every song was relevant to the accompanying scene, witness ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" and the stunning ""Someone Like You"" in the final scene.  So many movies blow it with a weak ending, but ""Diary"" does not...try it, you'll

Typical story - will she choose the good guy or the bad boy? Throughout the movie she writes in her journal. The journal entries and the rest of the scenes from the movie are hysterically funny. You get to see the not so sexy side of women. The most famous scene is probably the panty scene - which pair to wear for a date? I will let you guess how that goes.

I'm a recently single, thirty-year-old woman and I could very much identify with Bridget's love woes. I've been watching this movie since it first came out in 2001. I'm not in the habit of buying DVDs, but I bought this movie simply because it's timeless and absolutely endearing. Bridget Jones is one of my favorite heroines. She voices the fears of singletons everywhere. It's safe to say that there's a Bridget in every girl. She is a character you root and care for. She is sweet, guileless and irreverent. It's her foibles and vulnerability that makes her endearing. I invariably found myself cringing along with Bridget when asked, ""how's your love life?"" As a single girl, I've been asked this question one too many times. One of my favorite quotes by Bridget is: The only thing worse than smug married couple; lots of smug married couples.""  Colin Firth and Hugh Grant play their roles impeccably well. I found myself falling in love with Mark Darcy (played by Colin) every single time. As far as chick flicks go, this movie is one of the best! If you haven't watched it, then what are you waiting for? This movie is delightful, charming, and comical. You'll find yourself tearing in empathy for Bridget and in the next minute laughing. Plus, it has a great soundtrack!

1632862,3,B00005NFL9,"I bought Bridget Jones's Diary mainly because of the actors and the actress carrying the major roles, and in that, I was not disappointed. Rene Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant all carry their roles wonderfully. However, the plot line, while realistic and possible to relate to at times,seems to lack a clearly defined point. From an earlier review, it was mentioned that this movie, and the novel it is based on, is loosely based on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and that is inferred throughout the movie, with a modernized Wickham( Hugh Grant), Mr. Darcy(Colin Firth), and Elizabeth Bennet (Rene Zellweger). However, this movie lacks the beauty, the intrigue, and the suspense that only the original can afford. So, my recommendation is this....if you are looking for a ''no brain neccessary, just relax and zone out'' kind of movie with a great cast, this is perfect entertainment for you, but if you are looking for something a bit more timeless and a little less chick flick...I'd look somewhere else.",1360281600,,1017,4.988235294117647

1632930,4,B00005NFL9,"This movie did justice to Fielding's Bridget in every way. It kept with Fielding's British comedy. And you felt like you were watching Bridget Jone's life through her diary with the off screen narratives. It kept with a lot of the books' plots and style.

Rene Zellweger was a good pick to play her. She kept the character both funny and light.

Hugh Grant was the perfect attitude and image of the bad boy Daniel Cleaver. He played the perfect womanizer.

Colin Firth played Mark Darcy. He was really good at portraying the character. He was both macho and nice. And it was cute too, because Bridget's character is supposed to have this crush on the actor Colin Firth due to the BBC miniseries 'Pride and Prejudice'(1996).

The fight between the two guys for Bridget was perfect in the movie. I was very happy when Colin gave Hugh that last punch in the face.

**********************

Helen Fielding is an excellent comedic in this Bridget series. The first portion of the book Bridget had me laughing right at the start. Her New Years resolution was long with will not and wills. But there were some resolutions that I could even relate to.

The English slang words were both cute and funny (""emotional f**kwits"") There's also Jone's abbreviations (i.e.: v. and v.g. = very and very good) that even I found myself using for a little while.

Her love triangle with her boss Daniel Cleaver (all bad boy) and lawyer Mark Darcy (good guy) is really romantic. Daniel is the guy that she resolved not to obsess about as he is an alcoholic, workaholic, commitment phobic, chauvinist and emotional f**kwit (all things she also resolved not to fall for). Mark is the good guy who finishes last. Yes, he was already taken (the woman was a crazy needy woman who didn't love him). Yes, he couldn't make decision or stand up for himself (the clothes he wore were his mother's choices). But after a while I could tell that she should pick the lawyer over the cheat.

This is a good Brit-lit series (2 1/2 books). Bridget is a little over the top at times, but that's what makes the character so funny.",1349654400,,2089,4.609164420485175

Hugh Grant shows that he can be a humorous cad. Under Special Features, Rene discusses how she prepared for the movie - she moved to the UK several months before the shoot started and took a job in a publishing firm (incognito, of course).

1632960,5,B00005NFL9,"Finally we get the superb romantic comedy BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY on blu ray.  It has been a long time coming for all of its fans and the first question will of course be whether it is worth double dipping.  How much better is the blu ray presentation than the dvd.  I can happily say it far surpasses it.  I want to start by saying this splendid film has in no way aged and the story rings true as fresh as ever.  And this film is in no way just a chick flick.  Yes, it is a romantic comedy but it has a depth and realism that makes it something both women and men will like.  Renee Zellweger reigns supreme here as Bridget and provides slapstick comedy at its best while making you love and care for her underdog character.  Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are superbly cast as the male leads and the romantic foils for Bridget.  This is indeed a truly heartwarming tale.

Now for the blu ray.  I was very excited to see how pristine the video presentation is.  Colors pop brightly and skin tones are fresh and natural.  Black/white ratio is excellent.  The clarity and crispness is certainly what brings this film to new life.  The audio is 5.1 DTS-HD Master and works superbly.  Dialogue is always strong and present and the surround speakers get good use when need be.  But the music is a big part of this film and represents each milestone in Bridget's journey from Chaka Khan to Diana Ross and in those moments all the speakers come to life in  a glorious style that raises the emotional level of this film to an even higher caliber.  BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY is a superb film that gains new life with its blu ray release.  I highly recommend it.",1326067200,3,1643,4.35973597359736

1632963,5,B00005NFL9,"One of the things that continues to amaze me about good actors is the transformation they undergo as they assume a role.  My wife once made the observation that I found Renee Zellweger really attractive.  As I tried to explain, however, it is not Ms. Zellweger the person or the woman who I find attractive--although it may be a character that she opts to play.  The horribly mercenary woman that she played in ""Chicago"" was ghastly--and also really too skinny.  I liked her in ""Jerry McGuire"" and ""Nurse Betty""--but in ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" she really hit her stride--at least as far as I am concerned!  I am not talking as if I imagine myself to be be a film connaisseur--I just know what I like and what I find attractive--and the character that Ms. Zellweger embodies in this movie seems truly wonderful to me.  The Yiddish word ""Zaftig"" (i.e. juicy) conveys for me what might be called the ""well-fed farm girl look"" that Ms. Zellweger has achieved here.  And I can't say that this is my ideal concept of feminine beauty--but in this case it just seems to work!  I loved her awkward introduction of Salmon Rushdie at a publisher's event, as well as her confused appearance at a party dressed as a Playboy bunny because somebody had erroneously informed her that the theme would be the ever-fascinating ""Vicars and Tarts"".  Not all of Bridget's tastes appeal to me.  Smoking--forget it!  And tiger striped panties are not what I would consider ""sexy knickers"".  But her inappropriate frankness and endearing insecurity are traits that I find strangely attractive.  As Colin Firth's character said, here is what I would change about her: nothing (except for the smoking).",1305936000,,1675,4.8350877192982455

1632986,4,B00005NFL9,"""Bridget Jone's"" is played by Renee Zellweger who is able to pull off a remarkable English accent.  Her touching characterization of Bridget's cheerful ways show her as vulnerable and determined to become a new person within a year.  Renee does an excellent job in this role.  I was surprised how well the accent sounded, knowing she is from Texas.  She must have been determined to succeed in this role, gaining at least 30 pounds for her character, and showing off her plump fanny in pratfalls and embarrassing situations.

Bridget is a 32 year old spinster who has determined that her New Year's resolution is to no longer be alone.  She wants a soul mate and she is also feeling her biological clock tick.  A new red diary is used to reveal her inner thoughts, wants, loves and hates.  She does not hold back in writing anything she feels, including opinions on friends, boss, sex, food and exercise.  Her bungling and awkward ways are touching as she can't help but be open and honest with people.  Anyway, this is a year that many things happen to Bridget as she yearns to find someone who will love her just as she is.

""Bridget Jone's Diary"" has some thoughtful observations on the misery of single life, and plenty of laughs at ridiculous situations, and the ironies of many relationships.

The movie is entertaining and perfectly cast with Renee Zellweger as Bridget, Hugh Grant (as her lecherous boss), and Colin Firth (the neighbor she grew up with), Jim Broadben t (Bridget's dad) and Gemma Jones (Bridget's mom).",1284854400,,1526,4.760456273764259

He is charming while being slimey and you understand his motives in the end.  Our hero, oh wait, let me emphasize that - OUR HERO, Mark Darcy played by Colin Firth is perfectly cast.

He actually is doing a version of Mr. Darcy (which he so wonderfully played in Pride & Prejudice), set in modern day England.  He is a stodgy, boring lawyer who eventually falls for the charms of our gal Bridget and they fall in love.

It was better than the sequel but nothing to brag about.  The cast is first-rate but the plot is so silly and predictable that it doesn't give them much to work with.  Renee Zelwegger is pretty good as the pleasingly plumped-up Bridget who is in her 30's and without a man in her life.  She falls for the scoundrel Hugh Grant, who is always quite convincing as the charming cad and ignores the decent, square-jawed but boring Colin Firth.  We know the ending from the beginning so there's nothing to do but sit back and enjoy the show, if you enjoy this kind of thing.

Zellwegger is surely a game actress and gives every role her all, if it's the floozy dancer in Chicago (her best role, in my opinion) or the poor Southerner in Lone Mountain that won her an Oscar.  She has an innate likability, too, that makes watching her for two hours bearable, even in this silly story.  I like Colin Firth a lot and regret that there was not more of his presence here.  The parents were shown to be awfully stupid and hardly believable.

1633026,2,B00005NFL9,"Bridget Jones's Diary: 4 out of 10: There have been a great number of woman's films that have successfully crossed over to the mainstream. Sleepless in Seattle, Jerry Maguire and Aliens are three classic examples of ""chick flicks"" that men can watch with their ladies, enjoy the film, and still get credit for being a sensitive guy that likes what she likes.

Bridget Jones's Diary tries to come across as a frothy crossover comedy. You know one of those estrogen flicks that Hugh Grant now does since Tom Hanks was shipped off to make ""important films"". Diary however doesn't successfully crossover. It's a real chick flick through and through.

The thirty something equivalent of Sixteen Candles. In fact it seems to have basically the same plot and characters as that John Hughes eighties perennial. Instead of our sixteen-year-old ugly duckling we have a thirty two year old overweight alcoholic with virtually no social skills. And instead of one impossible cute and rich suitor we now have two impossible rich and handsome suitors that fight over our protagonist.

Now I have always felt Renee Zellweger was easy on the eyes and talented to boot. As for the extra weight she put on,(An act that the media with a straight face called ""brave"") well let's just say she wears it well. Her character however is such a horrible deceptive person that one really wonders why either man would want her for anything more than a quick shag.

Like those other lovable raging alcoholics of the silver screen say Arthur or The McKenzie Brothers two hours of screen time is one thing but day-to-day living is another. One really wonders how long either man would really stick around with Miss Jones? (A: Till he got tired of shagging her.)

One last question. What's is with the music? It's Raining Men? Ain't No Mountain High Enough? Does the CIA use this soundtrack on prisoners at Abu Ghraib? Doesn't the Geneva Convention mean anything?",1256169600,3,1931,4.857142857142857
1633027,1,B00005NFL9,"This movie is attempting to cloak a backlash ideology in a type of imitation-feminism.  Bridget Jones is the remake of Elizabeth Bennett from Pride and Prejudice without the intellectual capacity, class, and dignity. In the original story Elizabeth Bennett is not perfect; this idea of imperfection becomes a repeated theme in the Jones movie with one big difference--Jones lacks virtues.  Bennett's imperfections are also her virtues; she was blunt but by being forthcoming she was wise. In this new make Bridget is self-defacing.  She views herself as inadequate and the only way that she can fix her flaws is by gaining the affections of a male.  The heroine does not like herself.

  Over and over again the heroine puts herself down while repeatedly making the same mistakes.  She is a poor public speaker, but rather than avoid public speaking or get coaching she continually makes a fool of herself and this is supposed to be what is lovable about her.  I think that we can all identify with not doing things well, but Jones repeatedly bashes herself in the movie.  She calls herself a spinster and has several ""Bridget has done it again"" moments.  I think that there is a good argument that woman are being pressured to be so successful that any woman actually attempting to work and be glamorous and intelligent and do everything correctly will eventual have doubts about her abilities, but this film makes fun of heroine.  We aren't to question whether society has an expectation for women now that they cannot meet, we are simply supposed to laugh at this protagonist for failing all the time. A single woman struggling is now hilarious?

  Another problem is that at 30 her life does not resemble the typical 30 year old's.  She has no children. Utterly no dependents. Virtually no responsibility yet she cannot perform her job. How many female incompetent bachlorettes do you know? We are supposed to identify with her because she wears baggy underwear when she wants to be sexy.  Bridget tries to be a playgirl but doesn't know how.  She is too stupid.  The underlying message that I get is that no woman is really able to enjoy casual sex; she must mess it up, not enjoy it, or be mocked for her attempts.  Another issue is that Bridget wants a relationship, but is messing around with what in layman's terms we call an absolute jerk.  She is so despite for a man that she accepts Grant even though his behavior is disrespectful to her in the extreme.  He sexually harasses her at work and she does not leave or feel outraged. I find that believable if she was younger, but at 30 most women have a more experience with men and understand the workings or a relationship were as a young woman may not.

  The problem with Darcy is that he is not very nice to her.  He insults her and treats her in a condescending manner.  She doesn't fight back.  She makes a fool of herself and he feels bad for her.  That is not the novel that I read.  The point of Pride and Prejudice is that Mr. Darcy is prejudice and recognizes that he is reproducing social class discrimination when Elizabeth Bennett rejects him in a blunt, passionate, and outstanding way.  She stands up for herself beautifully when she exclaims that she will never marry him [because he is so disrespectful]. There are no scenes like this in this movie. Darcy looks down on her much like a Ph. D scholar degrades a fast food worker, and Bridget in the end runs through the streets in her underwear so despite that he not leave her. After he treats her poorly, the best way that she can express herself in written word is to pen that she hates him in her diary.  She doesn't state way she hates him or why his disdainful attitude towards her hurts her.

  All problems stated, the worst is that Bridget isn't in a relationship because she met someone that she has an affinity.  She is in a relationship because she is afraid to be single.  She sings all by myself and eats too much ice cream because being alone is embarrassing. It is her social status and not her personal loneliness that is the root of the problem. Ultimately, this movie teaches woman that above all else they must get a man if they are going to be acceptable members of society and that you should do anything--run in your underwear in the snow if you must, nothing is too shameful, to keep him!",1253750400,7,4339,4.588311688311689

She has a crush on her sexy boss who only wants to get inside her granny panties(played by a delicious Hugh Grant)I like him even better here as the slimeball boss. It was nice to see him get out of the stuttering dweeb role he usually plays.

1633033,5,B00005NFL9,"Based on the novel by Helen Fielding, the movie tells a story of a single woman in her thirties, who constantly worries about her weight, is bugged by being single, has crazy friends, and is struggling to stop drinking and smoking.
Even though Bridget is a smart, beautiful woman, she compulsively says what is on her mind and is constantly embarrassed in public; worst of all, she falls for the wrong guys. Renee Zellweger shines in the role of Bridget and adds considerable talent to the cast of the film. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant were great for the roles of Marc Darcy and Daniel Cleaver.

1633045,4,B00005NFL9,"This European comedy/drama flick was a bit comical, but also very touching and tear jerking too, since the bloody Bridget(Renee Zellwegger) and Daniel Cleaver(Hugh Grant) started out seeming like the perfect married couple who was hot and heavy and then all of the sudden POOF! Daniel decides to dump Bridget and steals Mark Darcy's wife(Lara)while Bridget discovers that Daniel ended up being unfaithful to her all of the sudden when Bridget walks into their bathroom and finds Daniel's mistress/Mark Darcy's wife(Lara)hiding in there naked, just before Daniel drops the bomb on Bridget and tells Bridget that he and Lara were even engaged to be married on top of that.

So then Bridget moves on by eventually dating the British handsmome Mark Darcy(Colin Firth) after getting over a tragic divorce with Daniel, but then one night Daniel decides to drop by Bridget's apartment one night while Mark and Bridgets friends are having dinner to try to get Bridget back, since Daniel's mistress/Mark's ex-wife(Lara)ended up dumping him and breaking off their engagement resulting in Mark and Daniel duking it out in the street trying to win over Bridget while Mark also avenges Daniel for stealing his former wife(Lara)by beating the crap out of Daniel in the process after a hasty altercation, which unfortunately kinda left Bridget caught between a rock & a hard place even though Daniel ended up getting what he deserved.

The truth is, I kind of couldn't help feeling kind of sorry for Daniel at first right after the ugly clash he had with Mark, since Mark nearly beat Daniel to a pulp, which also resulted in Daniel getting a double whammy in the process on top of that, but at the same time, it was like Daniel got what he deserved, since he broke Bridgets heart, but Mark did nothing to hurt Bridget or Lara and was a much bigger and better more mature gentleman than Daniel was and seemed to be a more compatible boyfriend/lover for Bridget.

The end was also very touching and heartfelt when Mark drops by Bridget's apartment all of the sudden on short notice on New Years and turning down a job in New York to inform Bridget that he wants to reconcile with her and then ends up reading Bridget's diary by accident while sorting through her stuff while he's trying to find something and reads a nasty little paragraph about himself(Mark Darcy) while Bridget is freshening up to look sexy for Mark to do hubba hubba, but then Mark walks out of Bridgets apartment making us and Bridget think that Mark was leaving Bridget again after reading the nasty stuff Bridget wrote about Mark, but then it turns out that Mark wasn't going to be dumping her and that Mark just wanted to surprise her with a new diary to make a fresh start together as an item again and for Bridget to make herself a new diary starting a brand new life with Mark.

Therefore, it seemed like Bridget's bloody diary lead to nothing, but trouble, injustice, and grief, kind of like how one innocent love letter lead to 6 sticky situations in the movie ""SECRET ADMIRER"".

So if you're looking for an interesting comedy drama, ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" is a good movie to watch and consider.",1226534400,4,3157,4.764168190127971

This movie delivers, with hilarious situations and a sweetness that leaves you feeling pretty good at the end.  Loosely based on Pride and Prejudice, the casting of Colin Firth as Mark Darcy is a tongue-in-cheek shout-out to fans of the original BBC production in which he excellently portrays the original Darcy.

1633048,5,B00005NFL9,"OK, I am an avid fan of Jane Austen, but Bridget Jones is NOTHING like Austen. Anyone with the slightest of ideas on the subject can see that.

Helen Fielding wrote both the novel and the screenplay to Bridget Jones's Diary and yes, it is loosely based on Pride and Prejudice. Can I repeat loosely!!!  After seeing The BBC version of Pride and Prejudice Fielding based the male character of Mark Darcy on Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, because of course she was taken by him and Colin Firth's portrayal.(as so many of us also are)  Other than some basic character traits they really are two completely different tales about different sets of people in drastically different times.

But with all Austen-isms aside, Bridget Jones(Renee Zellweger) is a strong, typical woman who is all too familiar to many of us.  She finds answers to problems in vodka and Chaka Khan, has issues with her body and is after all the wrong men! There is something about Bridget all of us can identify with.

Yes, slightly more promiscuous perhaps, maybe a bit more of a gutter-mouth but she's a character none-the-less.

Bridget is full of spunk and won't let anything or anyone keep her down, and in that aspect she is a real inspiration.

Mark Darcy(Colin Firth) and Daniel Cleaver(Hugh Grant) are enjoyable in there opposite of the spectrum characters, both after the affection of Miss. Jones.

1633050,5,B00005NFL9,"I just love this movie.  An absolutely wonderful, believable storyline.  Solid performances by Renee Zellwegger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth.

Renee Zellwegger is quite endearing in this movie and I actually think it's one of her best performances.  She's charming, funny, and does a great job getting you to fall in love with Bridget.  I also think her accent was fabulous.

Loved Hugh Grant in this one as it's a little different than his usual nice guy persona....it really works and he really makes you laugh.  Even though he's the womanizer in this film, he still is quite likable as you see that he and Bridget genuninely seem to have fun together.  (despite his ""wandering"" ways.)

Colin Firth is a mostly hoyty and serious attorney who has trouble letting hair down (unlike Bridget), but you can really see him falling for Bridget throughout the movie.  I found him quite charming and surprisingly sexy as well.  You find yourself rooting for him over the likeable Daniel Cleaver character played by Hugh Grant.  Firth defines Mr. Darcy in every way and does not disappoint with this performance.

1633053,5,B00005NFL9,"Much had been made back when Rene Zellweger landed the role of one of England's most recent iconic characters, Bridget Jones, a thirtysomething woman looking for love while dealing with her job, wacky parents, well-meaning yet misguided friends, and of course, the perils of her love life. Yet Ms. Zellweger pulled off Bridget flawlessly.

Yes, Bridget is not the prototype of the Independent Woman. And I think it is on purpose. The movie, in my opinion, is about not being perfect but struggling to accept the flaws all women have, so exaggeration can be handy in that regard. And poor Bridget does have her moments, from dinner parties with Smug Marrieds to bunny suits to caddish but handsome bosses that she knows she should avoid, yet cannot stay away from. What woman has not been attracted to the ""wrong"" man despite their better judgment?

Speaking of the caddish boss, Hugh Grant seemed to have loads of fun once he got to shed the stumbling, bumbling persona he is usually known for in his other roles. Daniel Cleaver is slick, smooth, and uses his good looks to entice Bridget - and a lot of other women. And he loves the thrill of the chase. He is not, however, honest and faithful, something that Bridget finds out in a most humiliating way, which leads to...

Colin Firth's Mark Darcy. As many likely know, Mark and Bridget's first meeting and subsequent relationship is based on Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"". Both Mark and Bridget are pressured by their respective parents to meet at the annual New Year's shindig, the turkey curry buffet, where Mark is rude to Bridget and insults her. From that point on, Bridget dislikes Mark, as well. Yet wherever Bridget is - be it a disastrous book launch party, staying at the same getaway spot as her and Daniel, or at that same Smug Marrieds dinner party - he is there, and always seems to catch Bridget at her most humiliating. (Perhaps this is what makes his declaration after said dinner party all the more endearing.) Colin Firth, on the surface, has the most thankless role as Mark Darcy, who is more severe and staid. But, like with the original story of P&P - a production he starred in and, of course - inspired Ms. Fielding to model Mark after - the metamorphosis is great. Colin Firth can say more with a small smile or with his eyes. But between Mark's aforementioned declaration, his helping Bridget out professionally [check out their faces during the courtroom interview scene], and being Bridget's white knight again at Bridget's own birthday dinner, it becomes apparent there is more to Mark beneath the surface, as Bridget comes to realize - almost too late. But, as it is a movie, she does - and the final scenes, to me, put the ""romantic"" in romantic comedy. And Zellweger and Firth had fabulous chemistry. As did Grant/Zellweger. So there are no complaints in the romance area to be had. (Firth/Grant were also hilarious and had great antagonistic chemistry as rivals.)

As for the comedy part? Check out the much-discussed Daniel/Mark fight scene! Hilarious. Only they can halt the almost girl-like fighting to sing happy birthday. (And there is a similar fight in the sequel involving a fountain. Thus showing TPTB knew the first fight was classic enough to do a retread!) Add in Bridget's flighty mother and chronically bemused/depressed father, and the laughs keep coming.

Bridget's friends offer a nice framework for the laughs as well as heart - even if they are sadly underused here versus the book, but at ninety minutes, it is inevitable that some things from the book get short shrift in the movie. That said, Sally Phillips as Sharon/""Shazza"" was a riot.

If you're looking for a movie where the heroine is self assured and is confident in herself without needing anyone else? This is NOT the movie for you. Ms. Fielding and those who wrote the movie seemed to like to mock all of the insecurities with weight, sex, and families that women moan about (thus making Bridget sort of an ""Every Woman"") and, for comedy's sake, it is much more exaggerated in the film than in the book. Bridget does get herself in some uncomfortable spots. But, despite her pratfalls, she does pick herself up - after moping, as some do - and carries on. But since the movie deals largely with her torn between two men, she is not the role model for the modern woman, although it is what Bridget WISHES she was, hence the smart irony of it all.

That said, if you are NOT looking for some deep meaning and just want some romance with a dose of comedy to chase the blues away? Sit back, grab the ice cream and/or a glass of wine, and enjoy!",1213574400,3,4614,4.688888888888889
1633074,1,B00005NFL9,"I picked this up because I heard that it was a modern retelling of Pride and Prejudice, that all-time favourite of women who can read English.

Elizabeth Bennett lived at a time when very few women could even think of independence and economic self-sufficiency. Poor, unmarried women had to live as dependents and ""poor relations"", basically unpaid, if well-kept, servants. Yet, Ms. Bennett refuses to marry a man whom she cannot respect and turns down another suitor because his proposal is insulting and demeaning. She has pride and self-respect.

Compare this lady with a ""modern"" woman who has a job and life of her own, but considers herself a failure when she can't get a date? Despite all her disadvantages, Elizabeth Bennett shines as a far more ""modern"" woman than Bridget Jones.

""It all began on New Year's Day in my 32nd year of being single,"" she says sardonically in what is to become the running internal monologue that ties the events in the movie to the entries in her journal.

Thinking that it was going to be another Gen X piece of claptrap, I gritted my teeth and prepared myself for what I erroneously thought would be a waste of time. Was I ever wrong! It turned out to be a sublime cinematic experience.

Renee Zellweger is definitely the star of this film. She positively twinkles! She is absolutely marvelous in the role of Bridget Jones, our single, thirty something, English Holly-Go-Lightly. Employed as a somewhat graceless publicist, the plump and perky Bridget enters into an affair with her caddish, handsome, sexy boss, winningly played by the ever charming and debonair Hugh Grant.

Meanwhile, her mother has introduced her to an attorney, the stiff-necked Mr. Darcy, played to taciturn perfection by Colin Firth. Even though they were once childhood playmates, he and Bridget do not initially click, and it is not love at first sight, as Bridget's mother had so hoped. Bridget goes on her merry way with her boss, unaware that he is two-timing her. When she discovers his perfidy, it is too late, as she already fancies herself in love with him.

Mr. Darcy, however, re-enters the picture, and what happens is a thing of beauty to watch. The film is very funny. Rene Zellweger as a Brit is totally believable. She is so good that she would even fool the Queen into believing her to be one of the Queen's own subjects. Without a doubt, this is one of Ms. Zellweger's best roles to date, and she is positively delightful.

Here, the film accomplishes that by making the central character tubby, clumsy, and possessing ridiculously bad luck and ill timing.

I'm all for a movie that champions a ""regular girl"" but the movie version of Bridget?  She has the luck of landing great jobs in competitive fields for which she's totally unqualified and inept, she's alcoholic and her vocabulary rivals that of an uneducated hooker. She doesn't try to educate herself or prepare properly for her jobs; she just wants to lose a few pounds and grab her guy. And yet, one of the sharpest legal minds in the country finds her fascinating? Uh huh.

BTW, how Fielding had the guts and thought to pull in even tongue-in-cheek references to Pride and Prejudice is beyond me. This has absolutely nothing to do with P&P. Bridget is the antithesis of Elizabeth Bennett.

Zellweger actually looks better at he more normal Bridget weight, but she is by no means an overweight Bridget. She does her usual cute mugging for the camera and can handle a semi-decent British accent. I just wish she had made the character a more sympathetic and likable.

I actually was put off by the language in the film, something that rarely happens when I watch a movie. I'm not offended by swearing in films, but soooo many repetitions of the ""F"" word--of ANY word-- starts getting ridiculous and annoying. The movie tries too hard to cram in edgy ""adult"" humor that actually comes off as painfully juvenile and boring. It takes away from the film and from Bridget herself. She winds up looking like a simpleton who keeps her mind constantly in the gutter.

The only scene I found funny in the whole film was the fight scene. I'll give a star to that. It was amusing. Most of the movie, however, just kept me rolling my eyes and yawning.

1633179,4,B00005NFL9,"Dear Diary,

Tonight, I went to see 'Bridget Jones' Diary'. I know. I'm a guy and I didn't go with a woman. But I went. I'll confess. I went to one of the most anticipated 'chick flicks' in years without a woman. I don't know. I just feel that the whole 'chick flick', 'guy movie' thing is a disservice. If the movie is good, why shouldn't everyone see it? If the movie is bad, no one should see it. Calling 'Someone Like You' a 'chick flick' does a disservice to females. Does that mean that they like tepid, recycled cr*p? I hope not.

I had a feeling I would like 'Bridget Jones' Diary', which is why I went on opening night, sitting in the middle of hundreds of women with their boyfriends and groups of female friends.

I was surprised by how much I liked it.

Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is a young, single woman living in London. At 32, she begins to wonder why she can't have a meaningful relationship. She begins to wonder why she isn't married. Her mother is no help. She attempts to fix Bridget up with Mark D'Arcy (Colin Firth), a former childhood friend. Things don't go especially well and she runs into the arms of her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). Their relationship blooms, hot and heavy, until...

'Bridget Jones' Diary' is certainly not the most original movie in the world. It is pretty evident who Bridget will end up with in the end. One of the things that makes the film great is the journey. Bridget has to deal with Cleaver's boss, an older gentleman who cannot remember her name, a lecherous 'uncle', three friends, a mother and father who are having their own crisis and her own relationships with D'Arcy and Cleaver. There are a lot of funny lines in the film, lines that are that much funnier because they arise from only slightly exaggerated circumstances.

Zellweger is terrific. From the moment she opens her mouth, any doubts about a Texan pulling off a convincing British accent disappear. She becomes a young British woman, and they are very different from young American women. She has the mannerisms, the tastes, the size, the accent of a young British woman. Zellweger received a Golden Globe award for 'Nurse Betty"", also a great film, and deserves another one for this role.

Usually, a film with ongoing voice over sort of sends me over the edge. However, the voiceover in 'Diary' is very good. It serves to highlight points in the film, rather than bridge them and make up for a lacking narrative.

Grant plays a character very different from his ultra-romantic, slightly dithering standard (see 'Four Weddings And A Funeral' and 'Notting Hill' for prime examples) and he reveals that he actually has a bit of range.

Firth is a real find in this film. Usually relegated to period British films, Firth portrays a very handsome man who gets on Jones' nerves. His ability to woo Jones' provides for some very romantic moments. Zellweger and Firth are a great, romantic couple. The fact that they have to work for the relationship only adds to the authenticity of the story.

Jones' mum and dad are played by Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent. Each is a very good actor, but their story seems tacked on and irrelevant. It only serves to draw us out of the main story, rather than compliment it.

The third act has problems. Primarily, it goes on too long. We already know who Jones' is going to end up with, get to the scene in which it happens. The third act reminded me a bit of the television series 'Moonlighting' and the reason the series drove its viewers mad. The series took forever to get David and Maddie together. 'Diary' takes a long time to reach the inevitable.

Overall, Diary, I really enjoyed 'Bridget Jones's Diary' and can't understand this whole 'chick flick' moniker it has received. If a film is good, shouldn't everyone go to see it?",1113264000,3,3800,4.613333333333333
1633180,4,B00005NFL9,"In this fast paced, modern age it seems, that society and especially the media have all these requirements and expectations of young single women. They should have a high profile professional job, supermodel looks, be suave, witty and sophisticated...oh and also be able to land that perfect husband and have the perfect 2.5 children by the time the old biological clock goes off. These ideals are all satirized and laid to waste in the hilarious British, romatic film comedy, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"". In this film we meet Bridget Jones, who hardly meets society's  standards and ideals. She's somewhat overweight (at least by Hollywood standards) and drinks and smokes way to much! Bridget is terrible at her different jobs in the media profession and has got to be the world's worst public speaker, who often blurts out the most embarassing comments at the wrong time. Too make matters worst, she seems to have no luck in the romance department. Bridget Jones is the kind of gal constantly making memos on how she's going to take the world on and make her life right in the process. Unfortunatly for every giant leap she attempts, there is usually a bannana peel waiting to embarassingly be stepped on. The film's plotline is liberally (and proudly) swiped from Jane Austen's classic novel, ""Pride & Prejudice"". Two men keep coming and going into her love life. First is her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) a witty, handsome, but vile Cad, who over and over again wriggles his way into Bridget's bed, only to find a way to break her heart, whenever things get serious. Bridget's other would-be suiter is family friend, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). He's a bit wooden in personality and even a stuffshirt and somewhat rude. But he's also kind, honest and dependable. Well I bet you can figure out, which guy constantly has Bridget's affections for most of the film! (BIG Hint: Nice guys seem to always finish last!) In the end Bridget goes for the guy, who just loves her for being herself, not for what she's trying to pretend to be. The script by Helen Fielding (based on her book & newspaper columns) and Richard Curtis (the dean of British romantic film comedies) is both witty and enjoyable. All three of the film's lead actors seem to have loads of chemistry together. Texas born, Renee Zellweger pulls off the British accent and totally becomes this modern day every-women, who finds inventive ways to become embarassed at any moment. Hugh Grant, who seems to have made a career out of playing eye lash fluttering, nice guy roles, gleefully takes on the devilish cad of the film with great success. Finally, Colin Firth seems like the only actor, who could play the Mark Darcy role. The movie's writers freely admit that they wrote the part for him based ironically on his own performance in the movie ""Pride & Prejudice"". The DVD of the film is fine. The picture & sound are sevicable but nothing special. In this collector's addition you recieve a nice behind-the-scenes featurette, that is quite interesting. Also included are deleted scenes, which to be perfectly honest, are as funny as anything from the final film. (This includes a hilarious montage of Hugh Grant's slimey, Daniel being interviewed, while sitting in a bar with a wide variey of seamy looking dates) It's obvious in this DVD edition that some of the extras are being used to hype the film's sequal, ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"".

1633182,5,B00005NFL9,"Both critics and audiences loved Bridget Jones diary and there are variety of reasons why:

Bridget Jones character ups and downs resembles both men and women in their early 30's:

Both men and women at this age, are contemplating

their status in life.

Their bummed out because they haven't met that  special someone, or they are bummed out, because throughout their life, they have met only losers  who are wasting their time  (which I very familiar with, except in my case, I've met mostly shallow women while the nice, beautiful girls are all taken.)

However, it's just romantic life that is  troubling people like Bridget Jones, contemplation about their careers and family are coming toward  the forefront of their life.

Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger)  is a British publishing assistant  who works for a publishing agency. She has a poor excuse of a lady boss and a male boss.

The whole film is narrated through the young, and  witty and vivacious eyes of Bridget Jones.  We learn how she feels about many people in her life, and we get to know Bridget on a very personal level, which is one of the reasons the film is highly acclaimed so much.

Anyhow, Bridget's male is Daniel Cleaver (played  as brilliant ridiculous as ever by Hugh Grant).  Ever since Mr. Grant made the fatal mistake of  picking up a prostitute, he's been ridiculed  (rightly so ) by the media, but he's also benefited  from it. He's played degenerate, characters for most

of his career, and the audience loves it.

Daniel, comes across as a very sly and romantic, and often blatanly horny boss, who wants Bridget, even going as far as sending her, really provocative emails.

Bridget (she has a young nieve mind) falls for  Daniel's (ahem) charms and starts seeing him,

unbeknowst to Bridget what kind of man, Daniel.  This changes though, when Bridget meets a family

called Mark Darcy (Colin Firth)  , who constantly seems to be meeting  Bridget at family gatherings.

Bridget and Mark Darcy seem to have a hate relationship.  He himself is rude, arrogant, and ridiculous at

times.

However, it's revealed that Mark also likes Bridget, and Bridget has the tough decision of

deciding which man to really give her heart.  As you can see the story is very real to the lives  of real women both in Britain and US.

Unfortunanetly though, once a woman makes the decision that Bridget makes, she is pretty much

stuck with her decision for most of her life.

The Dvd comes loaded with a bunch of extra features, in fact, if you haven't seen the movie,

I extremely encourage to watch the dvd and not the  vhs, since the DVD will give so many great items

to watch including:

* 2 music videos for the DVD

*Deleted Scenes!!!!

* Special Commentary

*Trailers

*Actual columns written by the real Bridget Jones

1633183,5,B00005NFL9,"""Bridget Jones' Diary"" packs enough fun, twists and turns to make two entertaining movies. Renee Zellweger turns in a memorable performance as Bridget an unmarried career woman still looking for Mr. Right in all the wrong places. Suddenly, she has two possible suitors. Her cad of a boss (Hugh Grant) who's probably all wrong for her but feels so right and a human rights lawyer (Colin Firth)who feels all wrong but is probably right for her. Her misadventures with both men will immediately win you over.

Now that we've got the plot and review out of the way I'm going to focus on what's different between this edition and the previous one. The first DVD released in 2001 and this one released to coincide with the sequel ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"" look exactly the same. There's nothing to distinguish one disc vs. another. Also, many of the special features are the same as well and, contrary to the amazon.com summary, many of these were on the original release as well.

The new edition features a handful of new featurettes. Jenny Bicks a writer/producer on ""Sex and the City"",  the editor of Allure Magazine and others comment on the difficulties in our narcissistic society. Her comments on finding Mr. Right in a world of Mr. Wrongs are frequently on target and quite funny. It's a standard but occasionally clever featurette that weaves clips from the movie with special footage highlighting the difficulty of finding the right person in a  society. ""The Bridget Phenomenon"" focuses on Bridget herself-Helen Fielding. Well, actually according to Helen and the film's director Sharon McGuire Helen really isn't Bridgett. She just assumed her identity for the famous columns she wrote. Interviews with the cast members discussing the perception that being single is full of woe. Fielding discusses the great appeal of Bridget lies in the gap of how their expected to be and how they actually are. ""Portrait of the Make Up Artist"" focuses on Graham Johnston the chief make up artist on ""Bridget Jones Diary"" and the newly released sequel. All the other featurettes and Special Features appeared on the first edition of this funny comedy with the exception of ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"" trailer. There's also reviews of the first film on this disc.

The original release had the feature commentary by director Sharon Maguire, the behind-the-scenes featurette on the making of the movie, deleted scenes. Contrary to the listing here the original Bridget Jones' Diary Columns appeared on the first disc as well. Missing from the new edition are the music videos. That's about it. The film sounds and looks exactly the same as the previous edition.

If you haven't purchased the film before or rented it on video but didn't buy the DVD, this new edition is worthwhile picking up. If you have the previous edition, these new featurettes will only make this worthwhile if you will watch them (some folks don't pay attention to featurettes at all or watch them one time)more than one time. All of the new featurettes are quite entertaining but hardly essential.

Regardless of which edition you buy, this is a delightful, funny, frothy and clever film that you can enjoy on your own or with a signficant other. Step into Bridget's world and, if you haven't seen this and are going to see the sequel, definitely pick this up first for a delightful introduction to Bridget and her men.",1100390400,16,3402,4.895833333333333
1633184,4,B00005NFL9,"Before Bridget Jones's Diary was released in theatres, much was made of the casting of soft-spoken American (from Texas no less!), Renee Zellweger as the very British Bridget Jones. It was seen as almost heresy by fans of Helen Fielding's very popular book of the same name. To almost everyone's surprise, Zellweger pulled it off with a credible British accent and a real commitment to the role (she even put on weight). Now, on the eve of the new Bridget Jones movie-The Edge of Reason, Miramax has gone back to the well with a brand new Collector's Edition DVD that promises new extras but is it really worth the double-dip?

There is an audio commentary with director Sharon Maguire. She comes across as soft-spoken but delivers an informative track as she talks at length about making the movie, praises her cast and discusses translating the book to the big screen.

One of the new extras to this DVD is ""The Young and the Mateless (an expert's guide to being single)."" It examines the single women scene with soundbites from successful stories, like the editor-in-chief of Allure magazine and a writer from Sex and the City.

""The Bridget Phenomenon"" is another new extra that looks at the success of the movie and how it perfectly epitomized single womanhood. There are interviews with Maguire and the cast with footage from the new movie. This is a nice look at the appeal of the Bridget Jones character.

""Behind-the-Scenes Featurette"" is a slightly cheeky take on the standard promotional press kit with interview soundbites from the cast and crew mixed with clips from the movie.

Another new extra is ""Portrait of the Makeup Artist,"" which features a profile on Graham Johnston who did the make-up for both Bridget Jones movies.

There are also four TV spots advertising the movie which is new to this DVD.

Seven deleted scenes totaling 11 minutes in length include an embarrassing marketing presentation that Bridget does for a book. There is also a nice scene between Bridget and her dad (Broadbent). Also of interest is an epilogue of sorts that is a sly homage to When Harry Met Sally (1989).

There is also a theatrical trailer for the new Bridget Jones movie, The Edge of Reason.

Fans of the original Helen Fielding columns are in for a treat as a collection of several of them from various years are included. They range from originals that inspired the first movie to more recent ones that make up the bulk of the second movie.

A new extra to this DVD is ""A Guide to Bridget Britishisms"" that features clips from the movie explaining common British slang, like ""fanny about"", ""daft"" and ""wanker.""

Finally, there are five reviews of the first movie from the likes of Rolling Stone, USA Today and Roger Ebert.

Fans who have the first DVD that was released might want to hold on to it as the music videos by Shelby Lynne and Gabrielle are not included on this new one.

Bridget Jones's Diary is much more than just the quintessential single woman's survival guide. It is a funny and engaging romantic comedy that champions a more realistic image of women. Bridget Jones is the photo negative of The Sex and the City women. She is not like them, with their perfect shoes and witty repartee. Bridget would be watching that show and not be on it. And this is part of the appeal of this movie to the average woman. This DVD is quite good. The new extras are entertaining but probably not worth buying the DVD over again unless you're a die hard Bridget fan.",1100217600,3,3475,4.686371100164203

Thinking that it was going to be another Gen X piece of claptrap, I gritted my teeth and prepared myself for what I erroneously thought would be a waste of time. Was I ever wrong! It turned out to be a sublime cinematic experience.

Renee Zellweger is definitely the star of this film. She positively twinkles! She is absolutely marvelous in the role of Bridget Jones, our single, thirty something, English Holly-Go-Lightly. Employed as a somewhat graceless publicist, the plump and perky Bridget enters into an affair with her caddish, handsome, sexy boss, winningly played by the ever charming and debonair Hugh Grant.

Meanwhile, her mother has introduced her to an attorney, the stiff-necked Mr. Darcy, played to taciturn perfection by Colin Firth. Even though they were once childhood playmates, he and Bridget do not initially click, and it is not love at first sight, as Bridget's mother had so hoped. Bridget goes on her merry way with her boss, unaware that he is two-timing her. When she discovers his perfidy, it is too late, as she already fancies herself in love with him.

Mr. Darcy, however, re-enters the picture, and what happens is a thing of beauty to watch. The film is very funny. Rene Zellweger as a Brit is totally believable. She is so good that she would even fool the Queen into believing her to be one of the Queen's own subjects. Without a doubt, this is one of Ms. Zellweger's best roles to date, and she is positively delightful. Moreover, Sharon Maguire's directorial debut is certainly noteworthy, as she shows signs of a deft comedic touch in her direction. This is simply a terrific film. Bravo!",1093910400,37,1713,4.8

I suspect there is something sinister behind the reasons why people find this ""entertaining"" or ""hilarious"". It just made me cringe. It's a terrible movie, but in fairness, the actors played their parts well, such as they were. But even the ruse of an actor gaining/losing weight for a role has become a cliche, ever since ""Raging Bull"". Hey, if you want a fat person, why not just hire one?

Not that there`s anything terribly wrong with that, but with such praise I expected something better and more original. Well, actually I didn`t, as this type of flick always follows the same routine. This british comedy is neither better nor worse than ""Notting Hill"" or ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", managing to deliver a decent enough story with competent acting and a couple (not many, actually) funny moments (just funny, far from hilarious). Rene Zellweger is an ok actress, but I don`t really see why so many claim she`s so excellent. She`s appropriate to the role, not terrific, and her character is nothing more than a ""been there, done that"" stereotype about the modern woman. Overall, this movie is an average and harmless comedy, watchable on a boring weekend afternoon and forgettable for the most part.

The book: I just wanted Bridget to quit kvetching  and obsessing about every single thing and get on with her life; it was too repetitive. The Movie: charming! A lot had to do with the actors: Renee Zellweger, Hugh Grant, and Colin Firth.
It's hard to steal a movie from Grant, but Zellweger manages to do it by playing an inept misfit in society, always foot-in-mouth, off key, dressed wrong - and lusting after the wrong guy. Just in case you haven't see it or read other reviews, I won't mention who the wrong guy is.

Renee Zellweger has been making movies for a decade but only recently has she begun to hit the Big Time. She certainly hits the mark here as a lovable, loopy Londoner in her thirties (same age as the actress) who is trying to deal with the prospect of spinsterhood. Whatever comes into her mind is likely to come right out her mouth without traveling by way of her brain, and Zellweger comic sense makes the most of the opportunities. She has a real sense of visual comedy, mugging without quite seeming to and performing pratfalls that seem almost unstudied. Though a Houston native, she also manages a respectable Brit accent. Hugh Grant plays a somewhat slimy ""Hugh Grant"" character with his usual disreputable charm, and Colin Firth plays a stiff, haughty barrister who is drawn to Bridget against his better judgment. Gemma Jones, of whom I have long been a fan, is terrific as Bridget's dissatisfied Mum who leaves her husband for the Shopping Channel.

1633214,5,B00005NFL9,"When Helen Fielding published BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY, the heroine BRIDGET became a symbol of the slightly overweight, chainsmoking, spinster-to-be that rang such a resonant bell both here in the United States and in England. Renee Zellweger had no trouble mastering a British accent as she stumbles and fumbles her plodding way in scene after scene, yet with each mini-disaster she emerges as the kind of woman that one rarely sees on either the big screen or small: one who is a walking mass of tics and insecurities.  Director Sharon McGuire borrowed liberally from PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen to update the tale of a young woman seeking lasting love, but having to stumble along the way.  Colin Firth, who played Darcy Fitzwilliam in the BBC production of Austen's classic, here reprises--sort of--his role as the emotionlessly haughty Mark Darcy who sees Bridget at first only as she surely sees herself, a lump of undesirable femininity that wears bad clothes.  He sees her, he rejects her with the same cutting remarks that as Darcy Fitzwilliam he used against Elizabeth Bennett.  Bridget turns to her trio of friends who in their unswerving and funny support very nearly steal the show.  Bridget chainsmokes in between binge eating, all the while threatening to blimp out as the rapidly aging spinster that all mothers warn their daughters about should these daughters forget that extra weight guarantees no husband.  But Bridget has gumption.  She jumps on a stationary bicycle, and despite the many references to her supposed pudginess, still manages to look quite attractive in the many scenes where you can see her legs and butt. Along the way, she begins an affair with her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), who starts off as the perfect date: handsome, suave, debonnaire, and single. Hugh Grant is the Cary Grant of our age. In most of his films, he is the male second banana to top rank actresses like Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock.  With these actresses, he need do no more than set up the inevitable romantic machinery that allows him to meet, romance, break up, and then reconcile with them.  He is quite good at that, but it is only in his rare role as the slightly raffish player that a newer and darker side emerges.  Grant as Daniel is not evil nor is he particularly vindictive.  He is a handsome man who has learned to trade in on his looks for so long that he has never had to look elsewhere for self-confidence.  Still, as a counterfoil to Bridget, he is roguishly charming as a man who once betrayed a friend and has had to regret it ever since.  Colin Firth as Mark Darcy comes across as the stuffy bear that he is, but it takes Bridget the longest time to recognize that he is the way that he is because of the ways that both she and Daniel are.  When Mark tells her that he likes her just the way she is, Bridget's metamorphosis from fake external Playboy bunny glamour to the more substantial beauty that results when one has one's emotional feet firmly planted becomes clear enough to both her trio of friends and to the audience who is not sure whether the stuffiness of Mark or the suavity of Daniel would be the better choice. The choice that Bridget does make is one that reaffirms the validity of common sense romantic entanglements.  BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY is a treat on so many levels that when she does make her choice, we can only applaud what to us would have been that same choice.",1058832000,,3431,4.685524126455907

Needless to say, in the conversion process from book to screen, lots of events were left out and the events that WERE included were distorted. The acting was mediocre by both Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant and the supporting actors and actresses. The only saving grace was Colin Firth's acting, but even then, his character's nature was tampered with by the directors till he was totally unlike Mark Darcy in the book.

Almost as if she couldn't simply tell him the truth, see him for what he was and love that and had to debase herself as she had worked so hard to erase from her habits.  Thats when the film really was a let down for me.",1048118400,3,480,4.184782608695652
1633241,4,B00005NFL9,"Renee Zellweger IS Bridget Jones, in my opinion, perhaps because I saw the movie before I read the book. Who else can convey Bridget's myriad and truly unique emotions with a simple roll of the eyes and a lift of the eyebrow? She makes us love her as she struggles with her ""singleton"" life as a 30s-something Brit who just can't quite get anything right.
Having watched the movie again AFTER reading the book, I was even more enchanted with her wonderful performance. And of course the addition of Colin Firth as an updated Mister Darcy, parodying his own performance as the haughty and brooding Darcy in the BBC version of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" is simply too delicious to miss. As Bridget devotees know, Bridget and her girlfriends have quite an obsession with Mr. Firth...and he plays along with the joke without once letting us down.
It is Hugh Grant, however, who gave me pause. Hugh plays Hugh, as he always does, but this time he's the villain, if you will--Bridget's faithless and rotten boss Daniel, who loves her and leaves her a number of times. I just couldn't quite see Hugh as the bad guy, and he did not, to my mind, resemble the nasty user in the book. On the other hand, I always find him a delight, so this weakness did not ruin the movie for me.
For those who like their movies to be absolute replicas of the book, this is not the one to watch. Rather, it is a delightful, fast-paced and maybe a little bit frenzied hodgepodge of bits and pieces of the book, with a little more thrown in. Some memorable parts of the book, such as Bridget's battle with the ""nasty underpants,"" are taken out of context, but still very funny. The book's gentle parody of Pride and Prejudice is still in evidence, and very funny, thanks to the above-mentioned deadpan performance by Firth. Bridget is no Elizabeth Bennett, but the whole thing works, somehow, just as it did in the book.
This is the kind of movie to pop into the VCR whilst drinking a bottle of wine with one's girlfriends in front of the telly. It doesn't get old, and it is simply pure pleasure.",1043712000,7,2064,4.506666666666667
1633242,5,B00005NFL9,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a film is rarely as good as the novel upon which it is based.  For one thing, it simply is not possible in 90 to 120 minutes (or in this case 98 minutes) to dramatise every incident exactly as and when it occurs in the book, nor is it ever possible to get all the humorous internal dialogue and cute thoughts that run through a character's mind.  But with a screenplay co-written by Helen Fielding (the author herself), Andrew Davies (who wrote the screenplay to Pride and Prejudice--the adaptation with Colin Firth), and Richard Curtis (The Vicar of Dibley, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Mr. Bean, Blackadder, Notting Hill) and then topped off with a terrific cast featuring Hugh Grant, who is absolutely wonderful here in the role of Bridget's bad-boy boss; and Colin Firth, in a modern-day reprisal of his signature role as Mr. Darcy--well, the stage is set for a production that just has to be good, regardless of its faithfulness (or lack thereof) to the original text.
In fact, for those familiar with the novel, the film does deviate quite a bit.  Certainly, it captures the essence of the novel, and it follows its basic structure insofar as the bulk of the events that occur in the book occur also in the film.  But what occurs or what is said at these events is for the most part very different from the novel, with the character of Bridget's mom's (Gemma Jones (Duchess of Duke Street)) toy boy and thus the entire ending being completely different from the novel.
I watched this film right after reading the novel, and I would definitely recommend against doing so.  If you've read the novel, let some time pass before watching the film, and then enjoy it on its own merits without expecting something that is too faithful to the text, for in spite of the deviations, this really is an cute film that is thoroughly enjoyable in its own right.  Just for the record, I've enjoyed this film much, much more upon subsequent viewings than I did initially!
Briefly, for those unfamiliar with the story, it's about a 32-year-old single British woman (played surprisingly very well by American Renee Zellweger--the only non-Brit of the lot) who is looking for love but always seems to end up with commitment-phobic, game-playing losers--like her boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).  To make matters worse, she's surrounded by ""smug married"" friends intent on making her feel inadequate, and a mother who is intent upon fixing her up.  It is during one of those fixing-up occasions that Bridget meets the seemingly arrogant and rude Marc Darcy (Colin Firth), a highly successful lawyer and the son of her parents' friends.  From then on, Bridget seems to bump into Darcy everywhere she goes, much to her chagrin and often to her embarassment.  And that is all I shall say, for I don't wish to give things away for those unfamiliar with the story.
In conclusion, I recommend this film very highly to anyone looking for a fun, light, and thoroughly enjoyable romantic comedy.  Familiarity with Pride and Prejudice is not necessary in order to enjoy this film--though one's enjoyment is bound to be greatly enhanced if one is familiar with and enjoyed the Pride and Prejudice dramatisation (which I recommend extremely highly).  After all, Colin Firth's original portrayal of Mr. Darcy was the inspiration for Fielding's Marc Darcy!",1041724800,,3373,4.836805555555555

I even liked that they changed the plot a little so that I didn't know about everything that was going to happen.  But...one of the things I loved about Bridget Jone's Diary (the novel) was her friends, especially Tom.  In the movie, they were so watered down!  And I hated that Bridget was so...inept, so wishy~washy.  I also hated that they made her look so sloppy.  Just because she was a little overweight (actually, she looked pretty normal to me) didn't mean that all her clothes had to ride up on her or that she didn't know how to brush her hair.

1633245,5,B00005NFL9,"Last year, in my class at women's college where I teach, I quoted the name of this film, as one of the best I saw of that year; yes, I talked about this delightful romantic comedy ""Briget Jones's Diary.""  The reaction from students, all twenty-something females, was, as it turned out, pretty loud, a sort of approving ""ohhhh.""  They thought, probably, I, thirty-something MALE teacher, would not be seeing this film.
Guys, (and this case, meaning males only) I say, ""Don't think that the film is made for only ""girls.""  That the film is based on Helen Fielding's bestselling books is nothing but its origin, and the film adaptation is more than what you expect, that is, more than just a descriptions of daily life of female office workers.  Not interested?  OK, you may ignore my advice, but I guess it's not a bad idea for any of us to get the inside view of vulnerable sides of those females working next to you, or walking on streets of London with their confident strides, apparently strong and independent.  And that is especially when delectable Renee Zellweger is Briget, heavy-smoking thirty-something, with no boyfriend, but with her own honest views on works, sex, and life.
One day Briget Jones meets her love, or thinks she meets one, in Daniel, her boss in the publishing company she is working at.  It started with an e-mail message from him, which was  tinged with slightly sexually harrassing comment on her skirt, but, hell, who cares! when Daniel is played by typically English handsome beau Hugh Grant.  Oh, but she should have known better.
Then, enters grim Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), who doesn't seem to know how to smile, who had once encountered Briget at the awful curry party (where he showed up in an eqaully awful sweater).  Behind his off-putting attitudes, however, it comes out later, there is something warm and human, but it takes time for her to learn that, and for true love to triumph.
As practically every British people know, the name of ""Darcy"" is inspired by Jane Austen novel ""Pride and Prejudice,"" and in acclaimed BBC TV adaptaion of that novel, Colin Firth played the namesake Darcy, an epitome of British gentleman, grossly misunderstood by the heroine.  As this BBC production was written by Andrew Davies, who also credited as one of the co-writers of ""Briget,"" it is inevitable for us to compare those two works, and there are at several points intentional allusions to this classic book in the film.  Perhaps Firth himself may loath to be typecast, but he is no doubt suitable for the role.  So is Hugh Grant, who plays this irresponsible twit Daniel, but, actually, he played the similar character (who repeats a favorite phrase ""the thing is"") in ""An Awfully Big Adventure"" (1995) alongside with Alan Rickman.  Check out if interested.
But the real treasure of the film is, as you know, Renee Zellweger, whose presence, literal and metaphorical, dominates the world of Briget Jones.  She is the one you can always relate to, male or female, and whatever she thinks or does would reveal those secret things deep in the hearts of those ""girls"" at your office, with lovely Renee always making you laugh and care for her, and if you're really working like her, most of all, look at your own life.  If you're a kind of person who wants to throw things at TV while watching ""Ally McBeal"" or ""Sex and the City,"" don't worry.  Briget's down-to-earth character would never make you.
And another joy is spotting some of the celebrities; two famous writers appear at a party scene, and look for Honor Blackman, ""Bond-girl"" in ""Goldfinger,"" and the first partner of John Steed in still popular 60s British cult TV series ""Avengers.""",1022284800,2,3672,4.784810126582278

I can't say the movie is a blockbuster because it's not true (as you should've noticed by yourself), but I have to clearly state that this movie will make you feel good about yourself even if you weight 300 pounds. Definetely.
The movie itself is about a girl whose life is just as messy as lots of other publicists who are about to lose their jobs if they don't come up with an interesting idea soon. Bridget, Rene Zellweger's character, ends up doing a new year resolution and starts to avoid her feel-good cigarrettes (casual or post-sexual activity) and lots of other things that had become a vice for her. The picture is filled with super funny situations, for example the costumes party where she ends up dressing as a funny-as-hell bunny with a white round tail.

I was very surprised by the performance of Hugh Grant.  He typically gets cast in the romantic lead role, playing some sort of charming, bumbling idiot that you can't help but fall in love with.  This movie, he actually tries something different.  He still plays an idiot, but this time he's the sort of idiot you love to hate.  It's a nice change.  And, if there are any of you out there who hate Hugh Grant, this is the movie for you--there is a particular scene that you'll love (but I don't want to ruin it for you).
Colin Firth also does a marvelous job.  His character is probably one of the most interesting in the movie (aside from Bridget herself).  He progresses in a way that you don't really expect from the beginning, and it's rather nice.  I love Colin Firth.

As with Russell Crowe in ""Gladiator"", Audrey Hepburn in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and Robert Powell in ""Jesus of Nazareth""; Rene Zellwegger definitely deserves an award for her performance as the typical British singleton Bridget Jones. I have read the book, which I found nothing special and actually sort of boring. However, one has to admit it is the type of novel which could undeniably make for a wonderful comedy movie. Add that the performance of someone like Zellwegger and... we have a winner!
When Rene Zellwegger was cast for the starring role in this production, eyebrows were raised high in Hollywood. After all, she is the typical American girl, not at all British. The fact that she didn't have the required accent didn't help either. But Zellwegger determined to overcome all these obstacles and gave the best performance of her life so far. After seeing this movie, no one can deny they couldn't imagine anybody else in the role. The part I liked the most was almost at the beginning, when she is alone in her apartment and lip-sings (and mock-plays) to the lyrics of ""All by myself"". I laugh so hard! I could imagine anyone going through such a situation and behaving exactly so.
To make a little history, ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" is based on the novel by Helen Fielding, about a 32 year British woman who seems to have no luck at marriage or even at a stable relationship at that. She feels marked for future ""spinsterhood"", ending her days alone, half eaten by dogs. She falls in love with all the wrong men, among them her boss, Daniel Cleever, played here by none other than British Hugh Grant. It is a relief to know Mr. Grant can also play roles where he is not always the laughing stock. But suddenly, one day love arrives at Bridget's doorstep - literally - and as it usually does, quite unexpectedly. Colin Firth is TO DIE FOR, in his role of the incomparable British macho who can make every lady's head spin around with love. He plays an insecure man, but who, in the end, knows how to claim what's his.
I was very glad the movie was so much promising than the book. Zellwegger brings to the screen a rich, comic, lively character otherwise too flat in the book. When we hope she would run right after her hero something always happens. One ends up feeling she might be too late
for her own happiness, but then... Oh well, after all, ""it's just a diary.""",1018310400,3,2467,4.583710407239819

If you are familiar with Pride and Prejudice, then you know how this one is going to turn out. It is an adorable romantic comedy, and it doesn't hurt that every time Colin Firth is on the screen he makes me melt. Enjoy!",1018224000,,672,4.299212598425197

1633276,4,B00005NFL9,",,,I read the book when it came out, and have been looking forward to see the film ever since. I love the book, and don't think the film fully got the atmosphere of it, though the film stands perfectly alone. Rene Zellweger is Bridget taken perfectly out of the book. A single woman in her thirties with people all around her expecting her to be a spinster all her life, while she is desperately hunting for the right man. She knows she eats too much, drinks too much, lives too unhealthy, and decides to start a diary to get hold of her life. The wonderful, funny part of it all is her self humour, and Zellweger plays this role to perfection.
All predictabilities are there, a boss to fall in love with and having an affair with, a mother who is trying to ""live her own life"" running away from her father with a man she meets while she is never satisfied with the life Bridget lives, friends, among them a gay man, who tries to advise her about her life, and the respectable, though terrible boring Marc Darcy. Zellweger plays her role so filled with charm and is the one who does the whole film. Huge Grant, as the boss, and Colin Firth as Marc Darcy do quite good acting, but without Rene Zellweger to glue it all together the film would have lost it's magnificiance.
Bridget Jones is British, and the story is British. Only one scene in the film was truly dissapointing - the fighting between Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) and Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) The scene were too violent and unreal, the story would have been much, much better if the fight could have been a fight to believe in. I think the fighting scene would do okay in an American movie, but not this 100 percent British story.
All in all a great film. Not to match the book, but then very few films do...",1016236800,3,1770,4.366666666666666
1633277,5,B00005NFL9,"While I'm trying very hard to not prejudice myself when a  movie strays too far from what the original book was about, I will definately admire a film more when it does capture what the author of the book had in mind.  This one does it, and does it very well.
A lot of bad things could have been done to this film.  They could have tried to make her more likeable by cutting down on the vices.  They could have made her slimmer.  Or, with reference to the recent ""The Time Machine"", they could have chucked England all together and put it in the U.S..
But they recognized that somehow Bridget is somehow likeable IN SPITE OF the mess her personal life is in, and maybe because of it.  So they left it in England, and kept all the vices.  And while Kate Winslett seemed the logical choice for the role, I thought it was a big gamble to get Texan Renee' Zellweger plumped up.  The gamble paid off.
One thing the movie adds that wasn't apparent in the book (nor could it be) was with the Mark Darcy part.  It would seem that he is secretly attracted to her early in the story.  As the book was her diary, we are not privy to it, and this was an interesting addition.
The two male leads are also very good.  Colin Firth seems to always come off as someone who needs a good bran muffin.  Well, he has that look here, but also shows a very human side.  And Hugh Grant does more acting just coming out of the elevator (showing his character's personality) in his opening scene than many actors do in an entire movie.  He does a great job playing a guy to does some scummy things, but isn't really a bad person.
Kind of like Bridget.",1015891200,,1625,4.2

Renee was great as Bridget, and I can most definitely identify somewhat w/ Bridget, except for the drinking. lol!

You can tell in her face that she gained weight, but the weight on her body looked just right for her. I think she needed a few more pounds on her body as Bridget--that's the consensus I've been getting from people who have read the book.

1633281,5,B00005NFL9,"Like many others, I was unhappy when I heard that Texan Renee Zellweger was cast as Bridget Jones. How was a svelte American supposed to play the beloved, blubbery, British Bridget? But Zellweger carries off the role beautifully. She's not afraid to seem as awkward, as perpetually embarrassed and as chubby as the book Bridget.
To those unfamiliar with the plot, here's a summary: Bridget is a thirtysomething Brit who struggles with her weight and her dead-end job -- as well as her lust for office scoundrel Daniel (Hugh Grant). Her overbearing mother keeps trying to set her up with Mark Darcy (Colin Firth from the BBC ""Pride and Prejudice""), whom Bridget despises.
The plot bears a vague resemblance to ""Pride and Prejudice"" overall -- making Firth's casting rather clever, especially given Bridget's obsession with him in the second book, ""Edge of Reason.""
As in ""Pride and Prejudice,"" our heroine discovers that the handsome, charming man is not quite what he seems -- and neither is the proud, arrogant one.
The dialogue here is clever and the acting is superb. This is one of those rare chick flicks that overcomes its genre on the strength of its humor: My boyfriend was playing a football game on his computer while this was on, and he had a hard time pretending he wasn't watching!",1014854400,,1294,4.833333333333333
1633282,3,B00005NFL9,"This was a cute film about a hapless, 30-something singleton trying to make her way in the world. I can relate to the main character on many levels, with the exception of the weight thing. I workout 4-5 days a week and wear a size 8. Nonetheless, the title character didn't look all that big to me. I think it's a sad commentary on society when a perfectly average-looking size 12 woman is considered chubby. That aside, the film is dead-on accurate in its portrayal of some of the self-destructive things that we females can sometimes do to ourselves -- the chain smoking, the excessive drinking, the binging and let me not forget the bad habit of hooking up with unsuitable men. In many ways this movie holds a mirror up to how some of us really live, which is markedly different from what we would have others believe. Not all single women are living like the gals on ""Sex And the City."" Some of us are quite ordinary and clueless -- but not me of course. 8-)
Zellweger is convincing as the earnest, if clumsy, Bridget. This is a physical comedy complete with many pratfalls and sight gags -- I was in stitches at the sight of those big ole granny panties that she chose instead of that little black thong. And who could forget her television debut that showed her entire butt the world after she slid down a pole?
I have to admit that ending surprised me because I thought that Mark was gone for good after he (rather nosily!) read some of our heroine's cutting remarks about him in her diary. But Bridget ran after him into the cold night, wearing next to nothing, and gets the surprise of her life. Ah, I am a sucker for a story with a happy ending. Some viewers complained that the movie implied that Bridget felt incomplete without a man, however, that is not my take on it. She wanted him, and he reciprocated her feelings. What's so bad about that? Further, I think that most of us desire companionship and spend quite a bit of time pursuing it and/or lamenting the lack thereof. It's not like Bridget closed herself off from the world and put her life on hold until Prince Charming arrived. True she did look in the wrong places and did wallow a bit in self-pity, but I think she was getting it together toward the end. At the very least, she was not afraid to make herself vulnerable even when she had plenty of reason to be gun-shy. And if that isn't courageous, then I don't know what is. I enjoyed this movie about an average Jane determined to proceed through life despite the occasional pitfall. That's all that any of us can do.",1014681600,4,2546,4.430703624733476

However, I realized different when I watched the movie.  Bridget Jones' diary takes place in Britain. The main character, Bridget (played by Renee Zelwigger) tells the audience about her past. We realize that she does not ordinarily have boyfriends, and , when her mother tries to set her up with a man, we find out why. We also realize that Bridget is not suave at all, which she realizes herself that New Year. She finds herself all alone, again, and makes a resolution to start a diary, among other things. Finally after consulting with her friends, she sends a naughty e-mail to her boss, who sends one back to her. After many such e-mails, her boss (played by Hugh Grant) asks her out. Later on, the man Bridget's mother tried to set her up with develops a crush on Bridget. Soon, Bridget is in the center of a love triangle and she must decide which man is Mr. Right.

We watch things happen to Zellweger seemingly at random - there's no apparent motive for the male characters.  I've been told that this is the entire point of the film, but if you're going to draw 2 dimensional characters as an artistic choice, it shouldn't look like an accident.
Maybe the studio wrote a $300 check to everybody else, but it offends me that DVD's are wasted on this vapid fluff while Drowning by Numbers is barely available on VHS.",1014249600,4,550,4.65979381443299
1633285,4,B00005NFL9,"I took the trouble of reading the novel when I first saw the trailer for the movie. After reading the book, I was quite disappointed and had no intention of seeing the movie. Several months later I have finally watched the film and I must admit I was really surprised. Very seldom does a film work better than the literary counterpart than it is based upon. Usually a film either matches the spirit of the original work or falls way short and does a discredit to the text it was based upon. BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY is a film that surpasses the book it is based upon. The movie flows much better than the novel and the characters are much more vivid and lifelike (well, Bridget's friends are toned down to a two-dimensionality, but most of them are worse scoundrels than Bridget).
Renee Zellweger pulls off a wonderful performance as the title character. It's hard to believe that the actress portraying this British singleton is actually an American, and not only that but a Texan to boot. Zellweger gives an emotional attachment to the character of Bridget Jones that is lacking in the novel. The character from the book is someone that is just as cruel and careless as most of the people she meets and encounters. However, the character in the film is someone that forms an attachment with the audience, someone that is likeable, someone that we cares what happens to.
Hugh Grant is perfect as the slimy boss, Daniel Cleever, and Colin Firth is perfect as Marc Darcy.
The language in the film isn't as vulgar as would be expected and the sexuality isn't as bad as it could have been either. I found myself laughing more than I expected and was surprised to find that after the final credits had roled that I actually enjoyed the picture quite a bit.

1633306,4,B00005NFL9,"In Bridget Jones's Diary, we are introduced to Bridget Jones, a thirty-something British woman desperately looking for love. Her co-worker and eventual love interest, played by Hugh Grant, is devilishly handsome and charmingly played by the suave Grant. Colin Firth, another Brit actor, adeptly plays a successful lawyer(?). Firth has a natural type of aloofness and pride that makes him suitable to play both this character and Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice. Both Firth and Grant contend for her affections. Renee Zellweger, ever lovable and emphatic, connects with the audience; as Jones, she portrays a size-12 smoking and drinking woman. She admirably attempts to ignore her matchmaking mother, quit her smoking and drinking, lose weight, and start a meaningful relationship. She records her social ups and downs and personal gains and losses in a diary which proves to play a key role in the movie.
The movie is filled with twists and turns and a few hilarious scenes punctuated by those more moody and dramatic. It is a light, romantic comedy which I highly recommend, especially to those of the female population. I really sympathized with Bridget and her earnest attempts to be a more contented, healty women. She showed real weakness in her diet relapses and emotional strife in the relationship with Grant. The almost cynical comedy was highly entertaining as was the fabulous performances given by the actors and actresses. The book would probably be better than the movie, but I have yet to read it.

1633307,4,B00005NFL9,"I have to confess that the primary reason I saw this hilarious movie was because of the casting of Colin Firth in the modernized role of Mr. Darcy inspired by the Jane Austen classic, Pride & Prejudice to which he also played the mysteriously deep Mr. Darcy. Colin Firth was well casted as the charming gentleman and hero in this romantic comedy.  Renee Zellweger was brilliant with her witty and fun characterization of Bridget Jones. I feared that as a native Texan, Renee would fail to accurately portray the tarty and tongue-tied English marm but Renee pulled the role off convincingly. Hugh Grant was perfectly cast in his role as the manipulatively charming Daniel Cleaver.

Renee' Zellweger is a fabulous Bridget and Hugh Grant and Colin Firth (Oh my!  He is gorgeous!!)do an admirable job of portraying Cleaver and Darcy.  However, the supporting cast of friends and co-workers are abyssmal portraying characters with no redeeming qualities--very unlike the book!  My biggest complaint of all is that Bridget, with all of her flaws and quirks, is one of the most loveable and sympathetic literary heroines to come along in quite some time and this movie portrays her life and her friends' lives as vacuous.  Where the book is charming, the movie is simply foul.  For anyone who loves Jane Austen's P & P and stories with any integrity, this is not the movie for you.",1011830400,,1009,4.747126436781609

Having Colin Firth as one of the leading men in both films is also a plus. Though we women often say we want a man who can communicate, why is it when the Colin Firth character (in both films) hesitates at the most important moments to say what's on his heart that we find it so romantically irresistable? I guess it's because in both films, the truth does eventually come out (something that doesn't always happen in real life).

If you've always wanted to be liked ""just as you are"" (my favorite line from the movie), this is the one for you...to watch over and over again.",1011744000,5,810,4.3933333333333335
1633310,2,B00005NFL9,"This movie was an agreeable way to blow 90 minutes. Perhaps its greatest virtue is it encourages one to read or watch Pride and Prejudice (again).
Please note: I have not read the book, Bridget Jones's Diary.
Hugh Grant, as Daniel Cleaver, or Wickham-lite, provides the best comedy. Charmingly sleazy. I liked how he referred to Bridget Jones by her last name, so I'm going to have emulate him in this review. In my opinion he was under-used. Even when he gets his come-uppence in the office, with Jones making a crack and everyone ha-ha-ing at the boss, in his eyes you can see a witty report but on film he says nothing. A lost opportunity.
Colin Frith is excellent of course. I find it difficult to describe his acting with his eyes when he is looking at the woman he loves. They show, at the very least, that he needs and wants her while at the same time exhibiting an uncertain pain and a questioning doubt of her ability to love him. A very similar look was used by him in A&Es Pride and Prejudice, incidentally, an excellent film.
Renee Zwelleger was alright. She had some loopy charm (I really liked her frizzed-out 1980s coiffure), but very little depth--which didn't seem to be her fault, rather the script's. She looked great, its hard for me to believe so much fuss was made about the weight she put on.
Several things were irritating about this film. In my opinion, having old people talk about their sex lives in order for the protagonist to show exasperated disgust and get a cheap laugh from the audience is lousy, desperate comedy. And several of the jokes seemed really dumbed down, like the audience couldn't figure out the humor without an arrow draw above it: for example, it kills the humor to have the mother introducing, hanging around, and then pointedly leaving Jones and D'Arcey alone together.
The blaring love songs I can tolerate. However, the several slow-motions were ridiculous and unitentionally funny. It also seemed strange to me that the diary, in the movie anyway, is not very important at all, merely an afterthought. Only at the end does it provide a curve for the lovers to overcome.",1011744000,4,2124,4.666666666666667

I sympathize with the other customer reviewer who noted the lack of serious out-loud snorting guffaws one experienced when reading the book.  Mark's character was left sadly shallow, whereas in the book he is allowed all kinds of depth and heroics.  But maybe I'm biased, as I wanted to see as much of Colin Firth as possible.  Anyway.  Still entertaining.  Hugh Grant perfect Daniel.  Renee alright--score one for the American chick no one thought could do it--but I wonder why, in the land of the Bard and theatrical traditions, they had to cross the pond for Bridget?

1633313,4,B00005NFL9,"The third in the line of successful British romantic comedies penned by Richard Curtis, `Bridget Jones' is thankfully a lot better than `Notting Hill' whilst never quite achieving the highs of `Four Weddings And A Funeral'.  With the books being such a success, it was only a matter of time before Bridget Jones hit the big screen.  She does it in style too, this being one of the best British movies of its type for a long while.  It tells the tale of Bridget, a thirty-something single woman looking for love - will it be the standoffish Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) or her suave boss Daniel Cleaver?  If this sounds either overly familiar or formulaic then you'd be wrong.  This is injected with enough wit, humour and fantastic performances to easily entertain for its running length.
Rene Zellweger is effortlessly endearing in her role as Bridget, a role for which she actually gained weight for - unheard of usually.  The fact that she is such a likeable character is that Zellweger plays her with such naivety that it's hard not to sympathise with her struggles to lose weight, find a man, and get a good job.  You get the feeling that this is a real woman, not some Hollywood fantasy.  Bridget isn't perfect and therein lays her appeal.  Hugh Grant as one of her love interests is great in a role that's thankfully a good deal different from the stuttering shy Englishman that he's so used to playing.  The serious Colin Firth is also good in a role that is basically a reprisal of his Mr. Darcy in TV's `Pride And Prejudice'.  It's a credit to the film that their rivalry is played out realistically without resorting to taking sides.  The supporting cast, of course, consists of various stalwarts from television, including Celia Imrie and Sally Phillips (from the award-winning comedy `Smack The Pony').
There's little to dislike here, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and an ending that is sweet rather than sickly.  There's even attempts to bring some humanity into it all with the breakdown of Bridget's parents' marriage.  Not only is this handled sensitively, but there's also a good deal of humour packed in there too.  There's no mistaking it: Bridget Jones is a winner.",1010361600,,2189,4.769230769230769

The movie almost turned into a completely different story, despite the close resemblance to the book at the beginning.  I probably would have enjoyed this movie if I hadn't already read the book, but if I hadn't read the book then I would have missed out on a whole lot of fun.  This movie was seemingly well made & not a complete waste of time.  Renee Zellwinger played a good part, but it just wasn't the same as reading about Bridget Jones.

I assume that the book was full of sharp and witty observations that rang true.  I have a feeling though, that even though Renee Zellweger does an outstanding acting job in the lead role, the screenplay does not capture that spirit.
Ms. Zellweger is a fine actress and the audience can certainly identify with her search for Mr. Right as her biological clock keeps ticking along.  Hugh Grant is cast as her boss and lover with an aversion to commitment.  Colin Firth is cast as a stuffy barrister who is also interested in Bridget. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the story moving along and some of it is humorous, but just not enough to make this lightweight romantic comedy rise above the ordinary.  I, personally, would never have been interested without the draw of the book's reputation and the fact that I am fast becoming a Renee Zellweger fan. She's a delight to watch and her freshness shines in every single role she's ever played.
At 97 minutes, the film still seemed too long.  But please  nderstand that I'm not a fan of romantic comedy as a genre.  I like a film to have a little more substance than the ups and downs of a romance that the audience knows is going to work out for the best in the long run anyway.  There's a happy ending of course, but so what?  Sometimes though, a lightweight movie like this can be fun.

  Hugh Grant's completely believable sleazy, British, upperclass, playboy boss Daniel Cleaver will leave you booing, hissing, and trying to shake his sleaze from your mind long after the movie's ended.

  Every actor on this film has something to be proud of. Bridget's wacky friends, her bizzarre parents, as well as coworkers and others are all wonderful individual characters in their own right.  It was a pleasure!

  The script was a gem.  Each scene is charming.  Situations and dialogue.  The  upbeat narration fills in any gaps, sets the tone, and moves the story along at a nice pace. Just as you think the climax of the film can't go any higher, along comes another twist that takes you on another loop of the ride.

  Well chosen music also adds to the emotional punch of the situations.  Bridget's last gutsy conversation with Daniel in the office and the subsequent musical choice of ""R-E-S-P-E-C-T"" by Aretha Franklin as she leaves, will have you rolling on the floor with laughter! An inspired choice!

  Her diary in the title is the record of her year of self improvement leading to her happiness and almost destruction, and the source of her narration. Don't miss this!",1007078400,9,1709,5.039426523297491
1633330,5,B00005NFL9,"When I heard about this movie, I had thought it was going to be another formula Hollywood comedy with a lot of double entendre's and sight gags, but instead I was truly delighted.
Bridget Jones' diary, is about your typical urban single girl getting beyond the point when her relatives think she should be married.  She has suffered through the ghastly fix ups and the constant inquiries into her love life to the point an affair with the office snake seems appealing.
This show is different with its British based sense of humor, so it is fresh in that respect.  Renee Zellwenger, put on some weight to more truthfully represent the average woman.  She also has the average woman's friends; all quite odd and suffering together.  Renee does a marvelous job at sticking her foot in her mouth as Bridget and often, no always says the wrong thing.  In other words, a portrayal of a real human being.  Her lipsynch with the song: ""All by myself"" alone in her room is one we can all sympathize with.
The story focuses on a time in her life where everything kicks in: Potential relationships, family problems and job dilemmas.  All the typical stuff the rest of us deal with, and as usual, all go down the drain at the same time.
Viewers of the old ""Life and Times of Molly Dodd"" TV series will particularly like this movie.  It reminded me very much of that.
A great movie, once again, Ms. Zellwenger, shows her wonderful comic talent.",1006992000,,1431,4.584313725490196
1633331,5,B00005NFL9,"I loved this movie...it has it all. Renee was wonderfully irreverent. She said what most women only think about life, men, etc.
I had never seen Colin Firth until this film and I almost didn't realize how fetching he was until the end of the movie. Greatly underplayed..I want to see more!
Hugh Grant was great as the villain-it really fit him. I watched the movie twice and now I have to buy it. It's a classic.",1006992000,3,412,4.363636363636363

It features Hugh Grant in a role he's not accustomed to but, handled very well. Then the ""treat"" in the film...Colin Firth who has been very underrated in films for far too long. This being the best part he's had that I've seen since his appearance in ""Circle Of Friends"". The remainder of the cast is superb and the film well executed. The icing on the cake are Bridget's own group of friends who support their friend very well and add all the bubbles to the champagne that this film deserves. A Great Brittish Romp it the Grand Tradition that carries over very well on this side of the Atlantic. BRAVO to everyone involved with this film.

I understand that it's a movie and that they couldn't keep all of the good stuff, but there was almost none of the good stuff.  Sure some of the scenes they kept in there (like the ""Tarts"" party) were well done, but there were some even funnier scenes in the book!  I think her friends were only in one or two scenes, and the same with her parents.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm glad I saw the movie for free and didn't go buy it first, like i had originally planned on doing.  Don't get me wrong.  I think the actors and crew did a wonderful job with what they were given, I just think that there could have been more done with the script.  So, I guess what I'd like you to know is that you should rent the movie first before buying it.",1004918400,2,879,4.063953488372093
1633334,4,B00005NFL9,"This movie will appeal to all - even the men will enjoy it if they give it a chance.  The heroine (played beautifully by American Renee Zellweger) has more bad vices, cellulite, bad language, and ineptitude than honorable virtues and noble qualities.  Bridget is a character most women can identify with, right down the the outrageous and loud but supportive group of friends.
Hugh Grant's character is so different from the charmingly lovable, tongue-tied misfit he often plays, and he pulls it off perfectly.  Daniel Cleaver is a cocksure, selfish womanizer who plays the charmer in order to get his hands on Bridget and her short skirts.
Colin Firth is delightfully in character as Mark Darcy - a barrister that comes off as being haughty and rude, but turns out to be down-to-earth, loving, and so sweet.  And Bridget, like most of us women, has a hard time seeing the real prize.
One of the best things about this film is the fact that it completely changes the audience's mind.  You begin by hating Darcy and loving Cleaver... by the end you are completely in love with Darcy and are cheering when he beats the stuffing out of Cleaver.  A delightful, funny, and very romantic film for women and men alike.",1004659200,,1211,4.7156398104265405

She flirts with him in an outrageous manner until, wonder of wonders, he does make a pass at her.  Bridget is hilarious as an awkward, tongue-tied, falling-down, sort of girl and Grant plays off her character well.  Her mother tries to fix her up with a stuffy lawyer, but Bridget is having none of that.

Bridgett is imperfect, as we all are; looking for love, as we all are; and a sincerely good person who deserves true love and happiness, as we all hope we are.  Taking her career in her own hands, not setteling for the hand me down man (Clever) and holding out for the one who loves her ""just as (she) is"", all these are qualities many women strive for.  This movie does not demean women for their habits, size, or style.  It empowers all women, even ones that aren't great public speakers, to hang in there.  Our Mr. Darcey is out there......
P.S.  The way Mark Darcey (Colin Firth) looks at Bridgett during her birthday dinner party made my heart ache.  When the right man looks at me that way, they will hear the shout of joy on Mars.",1003708800,2,839,4.2
1633346,1,B00005NFL9,"I saw this movie because I had a date and I have a passing resemblence to Hugh Grant. I thought it wouldn't do my chances with the girl any harm to be associated in her mind with a 'cute' Hollywood film star. My sexual predatoriness, of course, goes against the whole ethos of the movie, which is all about a plump English girl trying to find 'trooooo love.'
(...)Watching this film made me very aware that men and women have radically different itineries.
Women nowadays like to think they can enjoy a bit of a fling and 'play the field' in the same way that men have traditionally done, but, just like Bridget Jones in this movie, their hearts are not really in it. The pleasure of the moment is never just the pleasure of the moment, but is forced to have greater significance. What they want, therefore, is 'sexual excitement' LEADING TO a 'meaningful relationship.' This is what Bridget so clearly wants, and is of course the reason why she, along with so many of her sex, is obsessed by her weight. This is also the reason Hugh Grant's plasure-loving cad is cast as the bad guy.
As a man who also relishes a bit of pleasure and doesn't relish the prospect of being woven into one woman's cosy little domestic fantasy, I can't but find this movie offensive in the same way that an African American would find a racially inensitive movie offensive. Men are not mere adjuncts to feminine fantasy. We do not exist only to make their cosy little world safe and complete. We have our own needs, desires, and sensibilities, many of which this movie clearly offends.",1003276800,6,1564,4.549645390070922
1633347,3,B00005NFL9,"I might have had too high expectation after reading the two books and the reviews on the movie, before I saw it.  Completely on the other side of one of the other reviewers, I loved Bridget Jones in the books: I knew more of what she was thinking, than what she might appear before crowds of people.  It didn't matter if she was smart or beautiful, she was funny, sometimes even absurd, she drank alot, smoke a lot, very obbessed witht her weight, didn't have many interests. not quite diciplined.  But whatever she truly was, I loved her (biblically, since I am a woman).
I had been waiting impatiently for the movie to come along on videos ( I had missed te theatre season).  I can't say I was disappointed, but it was certainly not as satisfying as I thought.  Bridget appeared fatter than I thought- she was around 130 in the books but about 140 in the movie. She seemed rather slow reacting to insults (from the smug married).  She was an awful cook, not capable of cooking even for only 4 people!(in the book there were at least 12 people at the dinner).
I love Bridget Jones, but I am confused: what do I love her for?",1003104000,2,1125,4.358851674641149
1633348,5,B00005NFL9,"I always fancied myself as being *not* a Rene Zellweger fan.  But she did such a good job in ""Nurse Betty"", I thought I'd give her the benefit of the doubt.  Well, she is absolutely perfect here.  Much has been made of her dramatic weight gain for the role.  Well, for the first third of the movie, it's not so apparent.  ""Bridge"" is actually quite svelte and sexy.  It is only later on when she makes furious attempts to hide her bulk does the weight show (a scene with Rene in a bunny outfit does the trick nicely).  And you know what?  Bridget's insecurities are apparent -- because she can't help but wear them on her sleeve -- but even more so are her passions, and the latter neatly cancels out the former.  She is still sexy.  Credit goes to Rene for pulling off this neat stunt.  She also sinks imperceptibly into her English accent, and shows a flair for self-deprecating physical comedy heretofore unseen.
I always fancied myself as being a Hugh Grant fan.  Those who malign him for his repeated portrayal of shy and romantic Brits misunderstand that that is his greatest strength.  Play to your strengths, Hugh!  Fortunately, for those who need their performers to stretch, here Hugh mixes his usual character with a bit of caddishness.  And he does it so well.  You get every bit of the British wit he's so good at, plus a bit of danger, partially explaining Bridget's mistake at sleeping with her boss.  My one issue with Hugh is his insistence on maintaining his big-hair-and-open-shirt-with-big-collar look.  It served him well in ""Notting Hill"", but too much of a good thing is still Too Much of a good thing.
I didn't fancy myself a Colin Firth fan or non-fan.  In fact, I haven't seen (or noticed) much of the man's worth.  I did happen to catch much of his famed ""Pride and Prejudice"" performance.  It confused me.  Why was this shy, angry, and difficult man so swoonworthy?  Well, the first half of this movie brought back those confusions.  Even though she denies it, why is Bridget attracted to this furrowed brow of a man?  The answer comes (definitively) later on, and I credit Firth for his patience, his willingness to be looked upon by half the audience as a stiff bore, and his subtlety in slowly turning those perceptions around.
I'd also like to note that if Hugh Grant is in a movie penned (in this case, partially penned) by Richard Curtis (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill"" being the others), I'm there with bells on.  The one fits the other's words so perfectly, I'm hard pressed to find a better example of artistic simpatico.  Curtis, along with Andrew Davies and source novel author Helen Fielding does a fine job of adapting the book to the screen.  I read the book and, by the half way point, found Bridget's inner dialogues tiresome.  What was interesting in the beginning wore this reader down.  The film spends only as much time inside Bridget's head (and in her diary) as need be, utilizing sparse voiceover to great effect.  It also pares down the sub-plots (i.e., Bridget's mum and dad's marriage troubles; Bridget on TV), alluding to them only as plot devices.  A fine adaptation.  And credit should also go to first-time director Sharon Maguire, who infuses the film with a slightly surreal and definitely goofy quality, expertly handling the comedy (there's a wonderfully ridiculous party scene in which people keep asking Salman Rushdie for direction to the bathroom!) and the tender moments (the denouement teeters on the precipice that is melodramatic sentimentality, but Maguire does wonders in keeping it from toppling over).  This is a truly fine (and funny, and cathartic, and relevant, and revealing, and... etc.) movie.",1001376000,10,3691,4.760629921259842

Bridget is a single woman who is searching for a guy who is well,..... not psychcotic. In the midst of her search are wonderful friends, a kooky family, and an awful job.
This movie is not only romantic and endearing but its funny, the jokes come quick and fast and are filled with wit. Renee Zellweger takes the role and makes it her own creating a funny and quirky modern woman. She is especially humorous when she does any sort of public speaking.
Colin Firth shines as Mr. Darcy and the role fits him like a glove. (Those who have seen the A&E adaptation of Pride and Predjudice will remember him as none other then Mr. Darcy:)

Faster, funnier, more humour, less weight obsession, less parents, and very Pride and Prejudice-like, but I think that's good.
You recognise many things from the book but there are also new stuff, like half the plot for example. But it's excellent! We all left the movie in a great mood, happy and laughing, and I reread the book which I now can stand just because of the great film.

This film coughs up a few giggles, but it is just a girly movie, men will wanna go to Tomb Raider or Kiss of the Dragon.

1633367,5,B00005NFL9,"Bridget Jones's Diary was an absolutely brilliant movie. Although I am not used to all of the British humour and accents, you tend to catch on very well. The story revolves around Bridget Jones, a foul mouthed, near-alcoholic, chain smoking young worker for a publishing company. Her boss is an arrogant guy who likes her with short skirts on or off. She is torn between him, and a guy who supposedly stole her bosses fiance' off him. Things become very funny with some overly strange characters, including a sleazy TV director, a TV infomercial host who runs off with her mother, and of course, Bridget's friends who are just as bad as her although one swears almost every second word. Overall a very entertaining movie, but for this one, don't take the little kids to see it. For 15 and over. >Enjoy<",997315200,,802,4.654929577464789
1633368,3,B00005NFL9,"Given this is a light romantic comedy, with a likable lead actress, I suppose it is only fair to forgive a few failings, such as a predictable and hazily motivated plot...because (come on, be honest, now) is there any doubt about how things will end up in the end?  Does anyone believe Hugh Grant when he spins his tale?  (Even Liz Hurley would have trouble swallowing that one)  By half way in it is inevitable how the film will end and, unfortunately, that makes the second half of the film much less entertaining - you might find yourself checking your wristwatch (I did).  Also, there is a tremendous amount of foul language, which might lead one to expect a little subversive content, but no, there are very conservative values at the heart of this film (e.g. the two suitors are both wealthy, physically attractive and older than the eligible lady; she is shown as having no real interests aside from getting married and 'having a good time' (i.e. smoking, drinking, partying)) - the expletives are almost a disguise, so you might delude yourself that you're viewing some edgy material.  Despite these reservations, the film is saved by Renee Zellwegger who gives (a) great performance, and by the fact that the film-makers had the nerve to present a character that is flawed and fleshy - five stars for that, but not for the film overall.  This is probably a great film for a first or second date - although (at least for the guy) I'd recommend a few drinks before hand.",997056000,3,1477,4.661538461538462
1633369,4,B00005NFL9,"I've read both books and there were fabulous. Yes, the movie departs some from the book, but not in a demeaning or bad way a la ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil."" I found Renee's portrayal of Bridget to be charming. As far as bumbling or stumbling, the character in the book came across to me as such and I think Renee carried off its essence very nicely. The whole point of the book is the awkwardness of being a 30something singleton searching for love, place in the world, comfort zone, etc.
...on the weight issue, Renee is already underweight, she had to gain 30 pounds to look realistically 20 pounds over. And even at the weight she was in the movie, she was far from fat.  I rather liked seeing a normal-sized person for once on the silver screen. It was also refreshing to see an actress willing to do so for the sake of a good film, which this was.
I laughed from the time I sat down in the theater. The only obvious departure from the book was the lack of  her involvement with friends, which is not necessarily a bad thing. In the book, Bridget's friends played a larger role. The reduced role in the movie worked better overall because it would have been near as funny with all those tiny and insignficant details.",996710400,3,1235,4.3652173913043475

This movie was great!!",995846400,2,298,4.98
1633385,5,B00005NFL9,"I really enjoyed this film.  Forget criticisms about it not being exactly like the book - the film kept in the best parts of the book and jettisoned what was, in my opinion, a rather tedious and far-fetched sub-plot involving her mother.  A triumph!  Could have made a bit more of the circle of friends in the plot, they ended up being superfluous, but that was the only real weakness I thought.  The best romcom since 'When Harry Met Sally' I thought and a little darker and less cloying than 4 Weddings and Notting Hill..
Renee's interpretation of Bridget was a softer more childish approach, almost virginal.  For me that worked very well and did not jar with her naturally very warm and vulnerable on-screen persona.  For her to try to be as cynical and independent as the Bridget in the book appeared to be, might not have worked as successfully.  I thought her accent and mannerisms were impressively convincing.  The acting was slightly hammy in certain places (like the part when she takes over driving the car near the end - a bit TOO childish for a woman in her 30's I thought) but nonetheless endearing and attractive - I simply could not imagine another Hollywood actress playing the part so well and paying so much attention to detail in trying to be 'British'.  I would like to have seen someone like Kate Winslett doing a more hard-bitten interpretation but then it would have been an entirely different film.
When I saw it in the cinema, it was a Monday evening - usually the dead zone... it was packed.. and the atmosphere was great.  From the opening scene where Bridget mimes to that anthem of singletons everywhere 'All By Myself' (how many of us relate to THAT one !!) the whole audience was laughing out loud in sympathy and cringe-inducing recognition, and the belly laughs continued throughout until my jaw ached.
At the end of the film the audience spontaneously applauded (and this was in a British cinema!) which said volumes to me about the way this film appealed to everyone on some level - including the men, who seemed to enjoy it just as much as the girls.
How many women's jaws dropped at the first sight of Hugh Grant in the lift!  Wow!  Just raw bad-boy charisma wrapped in an angelic looking package...  Definitely a welcome but not altogether alien concept of Hugh.  Hugh has always played such affable good guys, but I think the Divine incident made him more interesting and 3-dimensionsal and the Daniel Cleaver character captures that duality brilliantly..  What is more attractive than the charming and slightly vulnerable [guy] that every woman thinks she can make fall for her?!  And Colin Firth as Darcy...  Again, any woman who ever saw Pride and Prejudice knows what a knee-trembler he is..  Tall, dark, brooding and intense, always leaving you with the feeling that there is more to discover - especially in that jumper ;-)  I remember him when he was in Dutch Girls years ago and he always had a certain something.  I can see him being the next big thing in Hollywood - and about time too...  I also liked the fight scene.  It was not only a quite realistic portrayal of the way guys actually fight like kids in the playground (instead of the ridiculous macho trading of endless punches and kicks you get in most Hollywood films) but it's such a British idea that a guy could land in your dinner and then say 'Sorry' ;-)
By the way, I could not believe what a big deal was made of Renee's weight in the press.  Since when is a size 12 woman fat!  My ... no wonder we are all so insecure.  I did not consider Renee fat in the film at all, but I did think that some of the camera angles and clothes were deliberately unflattering to make the most of a comedic situation..  Bridget herself embodies the constant battle to meet the expectations of what a woman should be to be considered 'acceptable' by society but like most of us is defined by the energy we spend in the struggle and the failure when we could be ploughing that energy into claiming the power that 50% of the population should have (yes clever plot guys but we're catching on...).
What Bridget does is show us that we can be interesting and sexy without being perfect or a size 6.  Daniel Cleaver's 'hello Mummy' moment serves to remind us that men don't just go for the Lara in the little knickers, they will cheat on a Lara just as easily as they will cheat on a Bridget, fat has nothing to do with it.  Lara's bitchy comment 'I thought you said she was thin' simply affirms the fact that Daniel is a liar, that Bridget's 'size' was actually not as important to him as to Lara, and Lara shows herself to be self-absorbed and deluded about her own attractiveness.  The idea that only beautiful people have beautiful lives is blown away.
And when Mark Darcy tells Bridget he likes her 'just as she is', it is a revelation that redeems the whole male species ;-)
So - impressive acting, great casting, a great interpretation of the book which doesn't detract from its message or its magic, a film that people can relate to and that can provoke conversation about the nature of people and relationships.  Funny, sad, romantic, with a bit of action thrown in too..  What more could you ask?
A big 5-star thumbs up for Bridget from me",995673600,16,5242,4.54468085106383

If you've read the book, it won't be a letdown.  I've seen the film twice, because one group of my friends couldn't make it to see it the first time I saw it and it was just as fun the second time.
It's better than the standard ""Chick Flick"", which means you can actually take a squeamish male to see this film and they can enjoy it too.  If I had one complaint with the film, character development wasn't as good as the book, such as in Bridget's parents and friends, but I guess you can't have everything..
Rene Zellwegger did an impressive job as the insecure Bridget Jones.  I was amazed she could pull it off!  Hugh Grant is wonderful to look at on the screen, but he does get the good looking man with the dark side roles these days, I've noticed.  Colin Firth had an impressive role, but I think there could have been more to his part other than the love him/hate him bit that was Bridget Jone's focus throughout the film.  I don't want to give the film's plot away.

Renee Zellweger puffed up approximately 25 pounds to play the british 30something.  I was very happily surprised by her performance as Bridge.  She brought great life to Bridge, and I thought that she did a great job. She carried the English accent off, and kept it for the entirety of the film..Bravo to Renee!
Of course, the book is much better.. But this is one of the better ""book gone to film"" adaptations I've seen thus far.
It's a good movie.  I thought that both Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver were convincingly brought to life by Colin Firth and Hugh Grant, respectively.  It's nice to see Grant not playing the ""nice guy"" for once.  He was hilarious as Daniel. If you're up for a romantic comedy, this is one of the best I've seen this year.  It's a jolly good show!

Who turns out to be (she thinks) the also maladjusted womanizing Hugh Grant. Along the way she tackles some of the most hilarious social situations ever presented to an American actress playing a down and out Brit.

Renee Zellweger's performance is excellent and her accent, to this ex-patriated Englishman anyway, flawless - if a little too upmarket for the role.  Hugh Grant seems happy to hand over his customary tongue-tied female-dominated Brit routine to Colin Firth. The amount of cigarette smoking  and foul language in the film seems excessive - until you go to a pub or wine-bar in the UK and realise that film's portrayal is entirely true to form.

And, with a Texan playing delightful, yet misguided Bridget??  Renee Zellweger was purrfect.  She even looks good with that extra(?)weight.  Collin Firth was as good as he was in Pride & Prejudice.  And who says a guy(Hugh Grant) who sneaks around on a great looking girlfriend(Elizabeth Hurley) also can't do it wonderfully on the screen.  The sad part about this movie is that it has been tagged a chick flick. Too bad, because it is a great laugh for both sexes.",991612800,2,628,4.715596330275229

1633406,5,B00005NFL9,"...Worldwide Success. Once again the makers of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill"" have Topped themselves with ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", a Smart, Funny and Realistic Romantic Comedy. The Formula Still works, combine an All British Cast with an American Leading Lady and watch the Characters and Chemistry Shine, but This one is a Little more Daring, Hugh Grant is cast against type as a Lecherous Philanderer... And it works Brilliantly. Renee Zellweger is cast against type as a Plump, Graceless Brit... And it works Beautifully. Colin Firth is cast as... Well, Colin Firth... And it works Perfectly.
Zellwegers British Accent is Spot On, she Silences her Critics with a Top-Notch Performances and even though she had to put on a few pounds for the role, I don't think she has Ever been more Attractive. Hugh Grant finally gets to lose his Innocent, Stuttering Persona for something a Little more Fun, and he looks like he is Loving it, as am I. Colin Firth Recycles his ""Mr Darcy"" (from the BBC Production of Jane Austin's ""Pride and Prejudice"") role in this film playing a man named... Mr Darcy. I am All too Familiar with this character as my Mother and Sister watch P and P Religiously, he fits the role like Pierce Brosnan suits Bond. My mother tells me that there are Many Other similarities between B J's D and P and P, fans of the Novel or the Miniseries should have fun picking them out. (My Mother sure did)
Director Sharon Maguire Knows the Terrain, that's Blindingly Obvious. She has, in many ways, made the Perfect Romantic Comedy, I Simply Cannot pick a fault. I Adored the Characters and Loved the Script which Literally had me Laughing Immediately and Constantly. From the Hilarious Starting Credits at the Train Station, the First Character to open his mouth had me in a Fit of Laughter, and During the End Credits it Doesn't Stop, as the Names roll, the Jokes just Keep on Coming. It's a film that Keeps of Giving.
Like All the aforementioned films, B J's D is a film for Everyone, Kids will enjoy watching Bridget fall over here and there, Women will like it All, especially the two male leads and Men will love the Humour and Zellwegers Loveable performance.

1633407,1,B00005NFL9,"Though not a bad performance by Ms. Zellweger, something must be said of Mr. Hugh Grant.  Under no circumstances should he be considered and actor.  A character perhaps, but not an actor.  The perennial nervous sissy brit.  Always the uptight slacks combined with a blue collared dress shirt topped off by the predictable blue blazer.  This movie is full of chock full of far missed shots at ""you had me at hello"" moments.  With a Cookie cutter chick-flick soundtrack, overly dry humor, characters forced past the point of cutesy, and meandering cockney accents all making for a picture that not even famed thespian Jonathan Lipnicki could save.  Kudos for a chubbed up Zellweger, now women everywhere who wasted their money on this movie can at least have the comfort of an improved self-image.

At first my attention was focused on Hugh Grant playing Daniel Cleaver, Grant is so much better in these love rat, charming but dangerous roles..more please! I watched in amazement as i found myself fancying him, i barely gave Mark Darcy (colin firth) a glance, although i did find him a superb actor.
It wasn't until i watched it second time round (it was that good..)that i found i was infatuated by Colin Firth, his potrayal of Mark Darcy was almost perfect, probably helped by playing the origanal Darcy in Pride and prejudice.  I watched in envy as his love for bridget became clear, why couldn't someone love me like that?  The way he looked at bridget, the way he helped her with her TV interview, the support over the blue soup...my heart melted.
But i'm getting so sidetracked over the fabulous firth, back to the film.  Superbly cast, superbly acted and so funny.  You leave wanting to see it again, and i don't know a woman who can't relate to something Bridget does.
I would reccomend it to everyone, men,women, married, singletons...you will all love this film.  I also think that Pride and prejudice fans will especially love this, as it shows Firth playing the character that won the hearts of so many woman (yes, mark darcy and Mr darcy are that similer...he was based on him after all.)
