4042908,5,B002ZXZIXE,The DVD was in good condition and my son who I am sure has watched it already has not told me of any problems. The seller sent it out quickly so there were no issues from that area. I order most of my items from Amazon because I feel it is good quality and very very seldom have a problem. When there is a problem it has always be solved fast.,1335225600,,343,3.8450704225352115
4042909,5,B002ZXZIXE,"...Amazon came through with prompt delivery and nice packaging. My son loves Ben 10, so he was extremely excited to find this gift waiting for him after school. I too love this show. It is one of the rare animated shows that has nice scripts, great voice talents, and splendid animation. My son and I also like that the series progresses with characters aging and developing their skills.",1297036800,,388,4.720588235294118

4042912,5,B002ZXZIXE,"My son is 10 and Autistic but higher functioning in some areas. He has loved Ben 10 since it came out. This is Volume 6 in the Ben 10 Alien Force Series.

A clarification on the number of episodes in these discs: The original Ben 10 (4 seasons) were all released as sets with all episodes for that season in the set. Typically that is 12-13 episodes or more. You can get all the following as ""seasons"" which contain all the episodes for that year:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ben-10-The-Complete-Season-1/dp/B000JLTRF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ben 10 - The Complete Season 1</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ben-10-The-Complete-Season-2/dp/B000S0SYJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ben 10: The Complete Season 2</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ben-10-The-Complete-Season-3/dp/B000ZIZX9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ben 10: The Complete Season 3</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ben-10-Season-4/dp/B0017O1F34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ben 10 - Season 4</a>.

Overall from a consumers point of view the fact they are releasing only 4 episodes per disc is a bummer. However my son loves these so much and would play them every waking minute if he was allowed so I still consider the price to be worth it for us.

DVD quality is fine.",1277164800,2,2538,9.741525423728813

4042914,5,B002ZXZIXE,Ben 10 Alien Force is my son's favorite cartoon and has all of the volumes.,1272844800,,75,4.066666666666666
4042915,4,B002ZXZIXE,"The sixth volume of ""Ben 10 Alien Force"" has our hero Ben Tennyson in four new-to-DVD episodes including the epic two-part special ""War of the Worlds"" (how cliche).  In it, he and all the other heroes he can gather get ready for the ultimate Highbreed invasion.  But suddenly the Omnitrix Master Control has put into reset making things even more complicated.

Along with these episodes is another Alien Database showing more spacey specs of more aliens and heroes.

Look for the seventh volume coming soon plus an all-new series ""Ben 10 Ultimate Alien"" on Cartoon Network.",1271894400,,573,4.9375
4042916,3,B002ZXZIXE,"I overall gave this 3 stars, not because of poor quality, but because of the limited  number of episodes included in Vol. 6.

All other Volumes had a minimum of eight episodes and while this one cost the same amount, only had 4 episodes.

I felt that this was a rip off!!!

I could have downloaded off of ITunes and I would not have felt quite so cheated.",1271894400,,355,4.176470588235294

The DVD itself was undamaged but I'm picky about these things so that was a bit of an annoyance.",1347840000,,308,4.15
