2874652,5,B000RPCJS4,"No doubt Jericho of Scotland Yards, portrayed with excellence by Robert Lindsay, a troubled man and, therefore, not exactly a beloved figure at The Yard. In fact, if not for his long term, erstwhile partner and still friend, The Sarge. he would be a complete outsider to the major focus of his life, work as a police officer, He also happens to be The Star  of the Yard, noted for the number and magnitude of his solved cases. His father was a corrupt cop murdered in his home by gunmen employed by nobody knows whom: but, Jericho thinks he knows who dun it, and is miserable over the fact that he cannot put The Big Boss away. The Big Boss has an effective organization including two members of the police force in his own precinct. No wonder Jericho is so quick to offense and so little controlled in his expression of his discontent. Though no overt mention is made of the matter, he is also Jewish. As if everything else were not enough.
There is a certain manipulation of plot endings to give convenient solutions without the logical evil doer being the criminal. Nonetheless, this and other inconsistencies paled for me in the face of the strength of Lindsey's performance,  the solid work of others in the cast. London is made interesting and one meets many characters within it. Not everyone will go for this limited series but I found it involving and interesting.",1305676800,7,1373,4.622950819672131
2874653,3,B000RPCJS4,"The stories are potentially good, but it's very difficult to understand a lot of what goes on. Jerico seems to be only half in charge of the case, and shouts a lot.",1275782400,,164,4.15625
2874654,4,B000RPCJS4,"The Jericho series is well worth watching, but its strengths are in its atmospherics more than in its scripts and its characters.  Jericho himself is a nicely-realized figure, but his trench coat and hat, his talisman and his everpresent cigarette are more important to his portrayal than his language or skills at ratiocination.  The real star of the show is 1950's London, with damp streets reflecting neon, nasty alleyways and deep class lines separating the (sometimes guilty) rich from the (sometimes innocent) poor.  The ultimate effect is noir taken to the nth degree and there is sometimes a comic book dimension to the series, both in its graphics and in its use of colors, the gritty yellow of Jericho's trench coat reminding me of the stark yellow of Dick Tracy's.  Many watch British drama for the country settings, the costumes and the domestic architecture.  Watch Jericho for the urban setting, but remember that the 'realism' is highly stylized, unlike that seen in the world of, e.g., Jack Frost.",1232755200,14,1013,5.005952380952381
2874655,4,B000RPCJS4,"If you have watched Foyle's War, you may think that the producers of Jericho have just cashed in on a fashion for period detectives. That may be so but Jericho captures its period far better than Foyle's War did. Set in the Nineteen Fifties, Jericho is at least in part based on real celebrity detective, Robert Fabian, known as 'Fabien of the Yard.' Fabien like Jericho having a TV series based on his cases. Robert Lindsay who plays Jericho is a talented actor who is equally at home in light comedies as well as in serious drama. He does not disappoint. The real surprise is the casting of Peter Bowles as the villainous heavy. Bowles is best known for his roles as upper crust English gentlemen in comedies. As the bad guy he is superb, a gem of inspired casting.

The real star however is the sets and the costumes. It took Britain a long time to recover from the Second World War, rationing for instance continued into the fifties. At the time Jericho is set Glamour, which in practise meant all things American, was finally being introduced even if it was overlaid on a background of neglect, grime and disrepair. The series portrays that brilliantly.

All in all better than most TV detectives from either side of the Atlantic.",1211500800,31,1235,4.609090909090909
2874656,3,B000RPCJS4,"I guess I just don't like paying money to see the dark side of life, it's interesting overall, but, the hopelessness Jericho against the corrupt & sadistic element of of fellow officers in Scotland yard is not entertaining and uplifting. I much prefer series such as Midsomer Murders.",1202428800,17,284,4.9375
2874657,5,B000RPCJS4,"This edition contains four episodes filmed in a VERY smoggy and dark London in the 1950s.  The staging is very well done and the characters are well thought out and believable. Robert Lindsay excels in his portrayal of a lonely, tormented, but brilliant detective who battles on all fronts.  Sounds like the template for all detective series, but I found them to be original and highly watchable.  I would like to see more.",1200096000,44,423,4.767123287671233

8202220,4,B000RPCJS4,"Inspector Jericho, of the London Metropolitan Police, doesn't crack a lot of jokes himself, but he doesn't mind when others do. As a matter of fact, he's the perfect straight man. And though hes driven, in ways that are only revealed slowly over the two series of Jericho, he is, above all, a decent man.  And a workaholic. Hes described by a friend: ""The only girl he ever loved married somebody else while he was away in the war.""

 But then, his lack of a personal life does help him crack cases.

Episode 1: A Pair of Ragged Claws Its a 1958 Newsflash!  ""Jericho Receives Queen's Medal."" The newsreel continues, ""Inspector Michael Jericho, just back from the palace, and showing his Queen's award for bravery to Assistant Commissioner Cherry."" That night, Jericho spends his time at a nightclub by himself, trying to forget he's a hero.
In the early morning, his loyal sergeant, Clive Harvey, picks him up. A man's been shot in a working class part of London, a  young black man who worked at the bus depot. It just so happens that he had a friend who is a young white woman. Which didn't sit too well with some parties.

Meanwhile, in a mansion in the posh Belgravia area, a maid finds an envelope carrying a note made of words cut out of the newspaper: ""We have got Sir Nicholas. You will have 120,000 in cash when we ring. Call the police and we'll kill him.""

Can the murder and the kidnapping, from different sides of the track, be related?

Episode 2: ""The Killing of Johnny Swan""
First a preview: It's the 1957 international cross country championship in White City Stadium. The whole of England seems to be watching on TV. It's the final lap and everybody goes crazy as Johnny Swan, the best British contender, passes the Soviet world record holder. The announcer cries, ""Come on, Johnny! And the world record has been taken by Britain!... And the Soviets are humiliated.""

Move to almost a year later, and Johnny Swan is now a star. The world champion race is coming round again but he's not letting that slow down the party. As a matter of fact, he and his teammates are at a casino. The high-end, veddy posh and totally illegal casino. And Johnny isn't winning. Jericho, Harvey and DC Caldicott are outside the casino watching arrivals from their car. Harvey groans to Jericho: 'You're not really considering raiding a gambling party attended by the Russian Ambassador, are you?"" The Russian Ambassador? As in the humiliated Russian Ambassador?

Episode 3: To Murder and Create An obviously uncomfortable Professor Charles Hewitt is being interviewed on television. He is the face of the H-Bomb industry and tries to explain: Sometimes its necessary to kill in order to preserve life.  This goes down very ill with the members of the Ban-the-Bomb group watching the interview.

But its Valentines Day, and Hewitt goes home to tell his bedridden mother that he is going out.  It must have a heck of a  date, because the next morning Hewitts body is found at the Thames riverside: Hes been strangled with cheese wire and his mouths been stuffed newspaper.

MI5 is sure that its a political assassination, so Jericho is NOT supposed to work it like a regular murder.  But Jericho is not very good at taking orders.

Not only that, but Assistant Commissioner Cherry issues a warning: Ive received information from a man at the local newspaper,  that alleges you have been having a relationship with a common prostitute. Ive been sent photographs. We know what Jericho only suspects. Another cop, in the pay of a crime boss, is behind the smear. This is just one topic that makes the series feel like a 40s noir. Yet its set in the late 50s.

Episode 4: The Hollow Men  Jericho is gathering some ribbing, and some resentment, from the cops in the stationhouse. Hes not only a hero, but the BBC is filming him in an introduction to a new TV series: Good evening, all. Im Inspector Jericho of Scotland Yard. Tonight you will see one of the recent cases of mine, dramatized for your entertainment. The parts of myself and others will be taken by actors. The Metropolitan Police are dedicated to rooting out crime in the capital, whether its among Londons poor or its high society. Its powerful, or its weak.

It sounds nice, doesnt it. But Jericho knows it isn't necessarily so. In the meanwhile, young Diana Hunter skips out of her cello lesson to walk with her beau, neither of them to return alive. Will being a hero interfere with solving the murders? This episode has good plotting (pay attention to the title!) and great history regarding the great London Smog of 1952.

The two sets of Jericho originally aired in England in 2005.  The two episodes of Series 1 are 112 minutes each. The two episodes of Series 2 are about 100 minutes each. Thats a nice long time to tell a multi-layered story in each episode. The Jericho mystery series is not based on any books.  I like the series, but I have some dissonance while watching it. It is set in the late 50's, but everything else about it looks and feels like 40's film noir, including the men wearing trench-coats and fedoras. The production values seem a little chintzy.

It did not gain a lot of traction in the important American market, partly because it was compared unfavorably to Foyles War. I am a huge fan of Foyles War, but it does a disservice to Jericho to complain that it is not Foyles War. Jericho has nicely-plotted mysteries, even if it doesnt have the historical depth of Foyles War. It might have been better received if it had had better production values. That is, if it actually looked like the late 50s.

There is one important story thread that is not resolved by the end of Series 2, to my immense annoyance. Obviously, the producers were hoping that this atmospheric show was going to continue onto a series 3, but it didn't happen.  So the viewer is left with an unfinished feeling.
