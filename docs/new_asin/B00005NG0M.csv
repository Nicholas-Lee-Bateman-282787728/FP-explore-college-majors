1633439,5,B00005NG0M,"If you have not seen Collective Soul in concert (which you must do before you pass from this earth), and are only slightly familiar with their music, buy this DVD! Collective Soul is unplugged and at their best! The photography and sound are excellent. This is truly a revealing piece on the tremendous talent of Ed Roland, a fantastic performer and one of the premier singer/songwriter/guitarists of this generation! Enjoy!",996883200,4,424,5.071428571428571

1633451,2,B00005NG0M,This was not a very interesting video and the music was lacking. I watched it once and I have no desire to even give it one more try.,1356480000,,133,3.7857142857142856
1633452,5,B00005NG0M,I saw this on direct tv in 2001. I had recored on to video (vhs) and played it so often it wore out. LOVE IT. Can't wait for my dvd to arrive. The Leann Rhimes in Mexico is also very good.,1317686400,,188,3.6097560975609757
1633453,5,B00005NG0M,LOVE THIS CD AS IT IS A LIVE PERFORMANCE IN MOROCCO THAT IS ACOUSTIC. BEAUTIFUL SETTING AND EARLY DAYS OF WHEN THE BAND HAD SHANE AND ROSS WHO I ABSOLUTELY LOVE WITH COLLECTIVE SOUL. ALL ORIGINAL MEMBERS OF THE BAND AS I REMEMBER THEM. THIS IS HOW I RATE A PERFORMER'S TRUE TALENT WHEN THEY CAN PERFORM WITHOUT ALL THE TECHNO GADGETS. COLLECTIVE SOUL DELIVERS ALWAYS LIVE. HAVE SEEN THEM ALOT AND NEVER TIRE OF THE TALENTED WONDER OF ED ROLAND THE HEART OF THIS BAND.,1258675200,,467,4.441860465116279
1633454,4,B00005NG0M,"This is very good acoustic music.  For the full Collective Soul experience, get the incredible ""Home"" DVD.",1207353600,,106,5.235294117647059
1633455,5,B00005NG0M,One of the best live dvd's ive seen.  If you like this I recommend Goo Goo Dolls Live in Buffalo,1206316800,,96,3.8
1633456,4,B00005NG0M,Music in High places is an outstanding series.  You get to see many stars in a whole new light.  The visuals are incredible and the sound is awesome.  I'm a fan of acoustic music and it is neat seeing the offstage side of some of these stars.,1188259200,,242,4.1063829787234045
1633457,3,B00005NG0M,"My partner bought this, I had no idea what it was and I loved it, a feast for the eyes and ears.  I smiled the whole way through.  Awesome band, awesome songs, beautiful country.  The next bit is His review...I'm sorry the acoustic version didn't do it for me. It doesn't matter who the band is I prefer them to be plugged in not unplugged.  I should have read the description more closely.  I do have their 7 Year Itch cd and I absolutely LOVE it.  Maybe a greatest hits dvd with original videos might come out in the near future - here's hoping.",1185753600,,547,4.211538461538462
1633458,5,B00005NG0M,"I've been a fan of Collective Soul since 1995 and bought this dvd a few years ago. Such a great look into the band and a chance to hear them play numerous songs live acoustically outside in Morocco. Every band member has speaking/interviewed parts, there is humour and seriousness, and a lot of passion in their music here. If you have ever heard a Collective Soul song before, you should see this. If you have never heard a Collective Soul song before...well that's impossible. You have heard of them you just don't know it.",1176163200,2,525,4.595744680851064
1633459,5,B00005NG0M,"The guys sound great, the scenery is terrific, and the interviews are good too! If you're a fan be sure to pick this up. If you're new to Collective Soul snag the ""Home"" DVD first and then this one.",1171411200,2,198,4.102564102564102
1633460,5,B00005NG0M,"I really enjoyed the guys just 'winging it with accoustic instuments.  You can only do that if you're really musical artists.  Exotic locales, shy but curious observers, and the Marakesh marketplace are all great.  The little kids jamming to ""GEL"" just busted open language and cultural barriers, it seems like a time when the world wasn't as crazy as it is now.  I loved how Shane and Will incorporated local sounds and instruments into their percussion.  Leave it to Collective Soul to make a dungeon funny and...to sing in a third world restroom. Whether singing in the desert, in a fortress, in a busy marketplace, in narrow walkways between homes, in the rain under an arch or just talking about their perspectives on life in a beautiful ancient building, this Collective Soul  DVD is a good and inexpensive investement in entertainment.",1169251200,3,842,4.9361702127659575
1633461,5,B00005NG0M,DO NOT PASS THIS ONE UP. BUY THIS AMAZING DVD AND YOUR EARS WILL BE SATISFIED...,1168300800,2,80,4.0625
1633462,5,B00005NG0M,"This dvd is excellent.  The scenery is fantasic!  I love this dvd and the Collective Soul dvd ""Home"".  If you love Collective Soul like I do, then both of these dvd's are a must!!!!! You won't be sorry.",1168300800,,202,4.2631578947368425
1633463,5,B00005NG0M,"I was disappointed with this DVD when I first viewed it. The scenery is awesome and the music is great, but it didn't seem to be enough. Later, when I explored the DVD, I found that there was a ""music only"" option. It has the complete performances of every featured song on the disc. I am especially impressed by Collective Soul's musical dexterity even when ""unplugged"".",1152748800,3,371,4.636363636363637
1633464,5,B00005NG0M,"I had previously read reviews before buying and decided I must have it.  I'm not a regular buyer over the net, and I'm very satisfied with the product as well as the process.  I'm researching more CS merchandise to purchase due to the past experience.  I like listening to CS while working at home, but this DVD made it hard getting anything done.  You can't take your eyes off the screen.",1151280000,2,389,4.436619718309859
1633465,5,B00005NG0M,"I thought this was a great DVD. Very unique from most that Ive seen, however it was the first ""Music in High Places"" DVD I had seen. Very cool locations. As far as poor compression, I personally didn't notice any problems at all. It was clearly recorded on HD equipment, not that you get true HD with your DVD player anyhow, but I felt the video was solid. Better than most concerts I have viewed on DVD. In the first scene when I realized they would be recording outdoors and in various places I was wondering how the audio would hold up. I have to admit I was really impressed with the quality. There is no doubt you catch ambient noises, even some raindrops in one of the scenes, but I think it is very well done and accomplished what they set out to do by filming out in nature. Very cool! As far as a rock band playing acoustic, it's clear they aren't as proficient with acoustic instruments, however I think it's a great change of pace and VERY real sounding. Yes the songs have a different sound as they do electrified, but I think they did a great job scaling them down. Honestly my ONLY complaint is that it was not long enough, its only about 12 songs or so. Of course I wanted more because I enjoyed it, but it really could have stood to be a bit longer to make it feel more complete. At the price they are selling it I would snatch it up in a second. Anything under $10 is a steal; under $20 is still well worth it.",1145750400,3,1427,4.173913043478261
1633466,3,B00005NG0M,"I have another music and high places DVD done by the Goo Goo dolls. On all my DVD players I found a lot of compression artifacts (blocks, jumping, etc.) That DVD stopped functioning altogether and I figured I just had a bad DVD.

This DVD shows the same compression artifacts. Lots of blocks with fast movement or scene changes. It is a real shame because the music and settings are wonderful. But I can't watch the DVD without extreme frustration caused by poor encoding. This happens on multiple DVD players for me. This Collective Sole DVD plus the Goo Goo Dolls music in high places are the only DVD's I have that do this.",1142467200,,626,4.491228070175438
1633467,5,B00005NG0M,"I really enjoyed the beautiful and exotic location of Morocco for this show. The director used a unique way of filming for the whole video; it was a very ""live"" look to the shots, and creative way of laying the guys singing and shots of Morocco.

 I also enjoyed the acoustic sound of Collctive Soul songs, it gives everything a different spin to some well loved, and often heard songs. Not to mention Ed Roland sounds pretty much the same singing here as he does for a ""perfect conditions"" music studio. That can't always be said for some artists, when they get outside of a music studio, into the rest of the world!

 And one last note; The guys of CS are really pretty funny to watch. They seemed to be very relaxed and appreciative of seeing another part of the world and way of living.",1140134400,9,790,4.390410958904109
1633468,5,B00005NG0M,"I am a C.S. fan since I first listened to ""Hints, Allegations and Things Left Unsaid""; man are these a bunch of great musicians with power lyrics and some thrilling songs. They actually came down here to Venezuela to play along with Oasis and I actually was in disbelief when these guys played first, opening for the other band....their abilities and dedication is simply unbelievable. I was able to meet their lead and rythm guitar players at a club the night before the concert and was really amazed how down to earth these guys really are.

That been said, lets go on to this DVD. I've always known these folks would sound perfect on acoustic performances, but this DVD gives you the chance to get inside these guys perceptions about a different culture, reactions (the monkey part is really funny)and simple knowledge about a new place (never been to Morocco actually) all this while playing their all time inspiring music in breathtaking scenarios, you couldn't ask for more. Look how music bonds, unites people from different backgrounds (the kids dancing around in Gel is simply hilarious). My personal favorite (and I am going over the edge here cuz ALL the songs ROCK) is ""After All""- the last song if you play JUST THE MUSIC- because both singer and guitar players are so IN to the song the the lyrics jump out of the TV's speakers and the guitars play those sad melodies that keep you in their grasp until they fade.

Must have record. As simple as that. C.S. fan or not...",1135296000,3,1484,4.6603053435114505
1633469,5,B00005NG0M,What a great DVD!  Unbelievable production with great songs makes for an truly unique audio/visual experience!  Watching them perform in Morocco unplugged was ingenious!  A must have DVD!,1133827200,,187,5.607142857142857
1633480,4,B00005NG0M,This is a great DVD!  I can't wait until Collective Soul puts out their newest DVD in February!!!,1130457600,2,97,4.388888888888889
1633481,5,B00005NG0M,"This is the one and only recording of Collective Soul doing an acoustic performance.....they sound as good, if not better acoustically than electric.  Their perfomance in Morocco is absolutely awesome.  Beautiful country and beautiful music.  It is amazing that even with the language barrier....the Moroccan people pick up on the beat....it is incredible.",1125964800,5,356,5.679245283018868
1633482,4,B00005NG0M,Very nice DVD of Collective Soul. As a big CS fan I was very interested in getting a DVD of them performing their music. Only slight negative was the lack of their formal electric based equipment (which is fully noted on the DVD description). The acoustic versions are nice but don't have the punch of the full band based versions. I still recommend - can't go wrong for $9.99.,1122940800,3,377,4.478260869565218
1633483,5,B00005NG0M,"i've been a CS fan for years and absolutely love this DVD.  The video and sound quality are excellent.  They are an extremely talented, intelligent, and down to earth band (was lucky to meet them backstage at their recent show in LA).  Will (bass) and Dean (rhythm guitar) told me they were approached by Music in High Places and were allowed to pick any place in the world, and they chose Morocco as a backdrop because of the scenic beauty and history. Both said it was an incredible experience.  I have seen the Goo Goo Dolls and The Calling's Music in High Places DVD's which are both also very well made, but Collective Soul blows them away with the acoustic versions of their songs.  I still can't believe that they didn't rehearse and took only a few takes. Ed Roland is one of the best songwriters and frontmen around today(see them live and you'll see how good he is) and his talent is apparent on this DVD.  I play guitar so it was invaluable to me for learning to play some of their songs.  They perform their big hits and a few gems that sound great played unplugged.  Interviews with the band members and the location featurette are very interesting and showed their willingness to adapt to their surroundings.

Check out their website for info about their tour and latest CD, [...]  As an fyi, Ross Childress (lead guitar) has exited (booted by) the band and their new lead guitarist is excellent.  Childress does play some amazing licks on his Taylor cutaway on this DVD.  I am hoping they will release a concert DVD of their recent tour.

Buy this DVD if you like their music ,want to learn or already play the acoustic guitar, or just want to escape from your reality for a couple of hours!  You will not be disappointed by the band's musical talent, or the sound and video quality.",1102204800,10,1798,4.5092592592592595
1633484,4,B00005NG0M,"Let me sum right at the start, any Collective Soul fan worth his loyalty to the band, has to have this awesome compilation.

Sadly as an avid fan from one of the PAL territories, I could experience this compilation in the NTSC format only abt a month back. Its a beautiful compilation. To be honest, Im a little bit peeved that there are no songs included from Disciplined Breakdown and Dosage. Both these albums were absolutely fantastic and the songs from them could have easily lend themselves to some beautiful acoustic prformances, not to mention that these album were released way before Morocco. In my opinion Music In High Places could have added an impromptu jam session showcasing a couple of songs from these albums.

But then again this is the only official Collective Soul DVD and for all thats lacking, I would still buy this because the songs have been done fantastic. Especially the unplugged version of Gel, where there are a couple of Moroccan kids singing in chorus and going gaga with the bands performance. One sore thumb is the lack of any Morocco style jamming with the band on any one [or more than that ;-)]of their songs, which would have been the icing on the cake.

The individual band members display a honest sense of attitude and though the documentary doesnt dwell indepth with individual characters, you do get a feeling that they are definitely an unpretentious lot.

Overall you know that the people who were responsible for the production loved what they were doing and that technical finesse has gone into the making of this DVD. Rock on guys!!!

1633486,5,B00005NG0M,"Months ago I was flipping the channels and stopped on MTV for a second... then I was glued.  I wasn't even much of a fan before this but I knew when it was over I wanted it on tape or DVD.  I want to invite my friends over if only to show them the performence of ""GEL"" with the children of Morocco.  Just Amazing.  Wish I could rate it higher.",1011916800,12,343,3.857142857142857
1633487,4,B00005NG0M,"Collective Soul's fans from the heavier more electric emphasis of their last few albums may be dissapointed at how mellow this disc is... but the band has ALWAYS had an emphasis on pure harmony.  They've ALWAYS been mellow under the volume.
The sound of just the five guys and their instruments, without the trappings of a studio, suits them.  The travelogue aspects of the disc are pretty good as well--the guys are clearly enjoying themselves--but the heart of the disc is the music.  Ed Roland's strong voice doesn't need electric to shine, and songs which they chose to include are only helped by the clean, clear sound of acoustic.
The photography and quality of the sound are excellent.  When I saw it on a shelf at a local store I thought the idea of a travel-music series (""in high places"" only) was a bit gimicky, but now I'm thinking about buying the rest of the series.",1007251200,6,880,4.621794871794871
1633488,5,B00005NG0M,"For all those who have been following Collective Soul since Hints/Allegations or who have just learned about this phenomenal southern rock band from their latest popular hits; Collective Soul in Morocco is totally worth watching.  This video shows a side of the band that many have never seen.  I've seen Collective Soul live around 4 times now and this video was like watching them for the first time.  With its narration through Morocco by the band itself, the video shows the little heard personality of this Georgian quintet.  The DVD shows great acoustic performances put together out of sheer whim considering this band is generally associated with it's heavy plugged-in sound.  I'd defiantly suggest this to anyone that enjoys the band's music.  By the way it also lets you listen to all the songs separately as a special feature without interruption.",1001462400,4,858,5.049645390070922
1633489,5,B00005NG0M,"If you like Collective Soul, or if your just a fan of acoustic music, this is the DVD for you. Collective Soul is at their best here playing a variety of hits in Morocco. Some of the songs that you wouldn't think would translate well to acoustic, such as Gel, are brilliant. Every song is great, the scenery is beautiful, ... you can't go wrong!

7946884,3,B00005NG0M,"Although I'm a huge Collective Soul fan, I've never been in love with this video. There is nothing wrong with it, per se. Some nice footage, and this is the only available official visual document (aside from music videos/TV performances/Woodstock 94 & 99 maybe) of the original band lineup, which is cool.

However, the thing to know here is that this isn't an ""optimized"" unplugged type of setting. I'm not referring to the fact that these are ""on location"" performances and obviously not in a conventional concert venue. Rather, it seems like most of the arrangements for the songs are the same as the regular electric arrangements, except that here the guy are just playing a bunch of acoustic guitars and hand drums. Again, nothing wrong with that, but this feels very off-the-cuff, like you are hanging out with the guys for an impromptou campfire jam or something, not a fully-realized, re-imangined ""unplugged"" performance (which I'd still like to see the band do at some point).",1395273600,,987,4.945783132530121
