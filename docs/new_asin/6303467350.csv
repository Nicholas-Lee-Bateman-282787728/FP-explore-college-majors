7848030,2,6303467350,"Very basic instruction of basic guitar chords.

It is a very short video of 30 minutes.

The instructor starts off extremly slow with easy major chords and then takes off at the end with bar chords and leaves you hanging.

It seemed to be rushed at the end as if the director was telling the intructor he was running out of time.",1108425600,,329,4.274193548387097

Contains a wealth of helpful information and is taught by Keith Wyatt in a very  efficient, down-to-earth style. Highly recommended!",959558400,15,261,5.046511627906977
