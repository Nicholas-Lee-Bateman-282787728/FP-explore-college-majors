8388823,4,B0035CP4M4,This was given as a gift and it was enjoyed very much. This tells more of the complete story. This showed that it was a lot more darker than the original version that came out back then. I would highly recommend this to fans of the show and those who are looking for something different.,1360108800,,287,4.236363636363636

8388826,5,B0035CP4M4,"Golion is like a compleat 360 from Voltron. The show is very serious and doesn't suger coat war. There's massive distuction, death seems to hunt everyone who's decent. Earth's been ruined by what looks to be a combo of nukeular war and the Garlra Empire. It apprears as if the Galra empire sent a massive ww3 in motion because we were demend a threat. They never fully say it, but its pretty much said that after things cooled down. Galra showed up and finished the job.  Yeah you read right this isn't barly funtioning Doom. This is a nasty vile group of sados, that love pain, abusing others, killing at the drop of a hat and eatting said victims. Yeah eatting them. Galra is run by a sedistic Emperor Daibazaal. Who demands perfection every time out other wise it gets ungly. Sincline the japanize version of Lotor. Is a compleatly S&M personality with a side of sick, sick, F78k. This guy is dangerous in every sense of the word. He kills anyone and everyone who puts him in a bad mood. He's also not above trying to use possible leathal force to get Princess Fala/Allura to fall into line. He beats the snot out of her look alike cousin and rapes her more times than we can guess at. None of the rape is shown on screan, but its very easy to see that it did happen. This is a great early war/anime.  Its pretty burtial at times and a bit shocking for those who have only watched Voltron. But its well worth buying if your a fan of Voltron who always wondered where certain parts of the show went. Espeical when it was dead clear that people were crying yet the voice actors were trying to sound cheerfull.  This is a great early anime that while not as good animation wise as say Berserk.  Is well worth picking up.  Be it the compleat set or a volume at a time.  My only real grip with it is that Merla from season three of Voltron was created just for Voltron. Is not in GoLion.  But thats a minor thing. This isn't for young kids, so if you have them.  Watch this on your own then decided if you feel they can handle it.",1337299200,5,2028,4.276762402088773
8388827,5,B0035CP4M4,"I ordered this on a whim, after doing casual research on old 80's shows I remember from childhood. I knew that most of the early anime shows such as Robotech, for example, were simply Americanized and heavily edited versions of Japanese shows. The actual shows were fairly graphic with violence (and language if you read the subtitles). Nothing excessive though by today's standards. GoLion is the original series that Voltron was based on. From the first episode, you see why it was edited for American audiences, the level of blood and gore, again isn't excessive but you realize that this ain't Voltron. There are no escape hatches (usually) and people die horrible, painful deaths. The plot is simplistic and yet pulls you into the action. Further along in the series, Sincline (Lotor) makes an appearance. Lotor from Voltron is boyscout by comparison. Whereas Lotor was cartoonishly evil, Sincline (the actual character) is a raving psychotic, obsessed with Princess Fala (Blue Lion's pilot Allura) to a more creepy degree. The witch Honerva is more powerful and cruel than her Voltron double Haggar. There are other differences between GoLion and Voltron that are surprising as well. The whole 52 episode series is available. Highly recommended.",1337126400,12,1251,5.167487684729064
