7561549,5,B0192PESFG,"So glad I got to go to the premier, Denver CO! With that out of the way...

This long awaited sequel continued the narrative of the original beautifully. It was more of what we wanted with new amazingly lovable characters. For me this was another coming of age flick, set in the verse we have come to know and cherish. The old characters gave us something familiar but even if you aren't familiar with the franchise this movie has so much to offer. I'm not much of a punk my self... at all really but I have said for years that SLC PUNK, the first one is my favorite movie of all time. The sequel, much like the first film speaks volumes to those willing to listen. Thanks James!",1455580800,3,679,4.263565891472868
7561550,5,B0192PESFG,"It's NEW. Get updates on beloved SLC Punk characters AND fall in love with new ones. There's truly someone and something for everyone to identify with and understand.

Some have trouble adulting, coping with parenthood, old rivalries, new crowds, and the ageless pursuit in trying to figure out who you are in this crazy, mixed up world and being grateful for the friends who support you.

Note: You can totally watch this movie without having seen the first one but you will love MORE of this one by having watched the first one.",1455580800,5,530,4.688172043010753
7561551,5,B0192PESFG,I saw the film at a festival and it was so much fun. I love the new characters and to be able to see some of the old gang from SLC Punk. Bob narrates the story from the grave and he hasn't changed. Don't expect the same movie as SLC Punk. It takes place 20 years later and Punk Rock has become iconic and mainstream. There's a nostalgia of the era and it shows some genuine punks still living the ethos but it's a more mature story. The soundtrack is as awesome as the first movie.,1452384000,14,481,4.020833333333333

7561603,5,B0192PESFG,"SLC Punk is one of my all time favorite movies. So I had a lot of mixed feelings when I heard about the making of this. After I saw the trailer, I didn't gave huge expectations for this movie. But I was actually pleasantly surprised. This is my new favorite movie. I love the new characters as well as the old. I love the new Jon the Mod and Sean the beggar! I also love how they used Heroin Bob to narrate it. It's the same old Bob just dead haha.
However, I'm really sad that Matthew Lillard was not in this film. Steveo was a one of the main characters in the first film, so it doesn't really make sense why he is not in it, or why they don't tell the viewer what happened to him. Because it does show how Jon the Mod and Sean the beggar change and become successful in life. So what happened to Steveo? That is really bothersome. But the film is still worthy of five stars. I really love the dialogue and the music, and all of the animations and stuff that made the first one good. It's definitely a sequel. I saw it was on Netflix yesterday and have already watched it twice. I came here to buy it so I could support the film and have my own copy. Definitely worth a watch at least. Check it out on Netflix then come here and buy your own copy. For $8 its definitely worth it",1496016000,,1280,4.043307086614173

7561611,1,B0192PESFG,"It's not like SLC PUNK was the greatest punk or punk cash-in movie (cough cough ....Fabulous Stains, Breaking Glass, Suburbia, We Are The Best to name a few), but SLC PUNK was a good movie.  On a technical level, the cinematography and editing was great.

I went in with low expectations and an open mind, but unfortunately Punk's Dead: SLC PUNK 2 is hot garbage. The first movie was about existing in a subculture and why.  This movie is a one dimensional hatchet job that puts cocktail napkin-note level characters in front of some very dated scenery of Warped Tour bro-punk, homophobic language and suicide girls references. inter-cut a community college style one-act of all the SLC Punk returning cast and there you have a half-baked and completely unnecessary nostalgia trip down mall punk lane.",1485648000,4,801,4.9185185185185185

7561674,1,B0192PESFG,"Useless, pointless drivel that should not have been made. I'm not a huge fan of the first movie, but there was no point to make a sequel of it. Hollyweird has no new ideas.

7561675,5,B0192PESFG,"I recently spoke with James about a book. I promised to review this, and here is my honest opinion.

You won't see Some friends, but most of the old cast share a story in what will now be forever known as the slc franchise.

James has a way with dialogue, and you can really see him flexing his muscle. Beneath the writing you can sense he is a philosopher;

The initial story has a stomp rythm, starts out dicey, and sorts itself out in a unique embrace. I really felt something in several moments.
Most certainly how not to treat your daughter at a gasstation. (that was laid out well).
I can't spoil the ending, but I was very impressed as always and I hope James Does well on his new projects.
He is an acceptation human being, and has really earned a shining star in american filming.
Hats off to you, on what is either a summary of an old flame, or the future of a new generation.
I hope you like the book I suggested.
Take care!",1476230400,2,935,4.212290502793296
7561676,4,B0192PESFG,"The original SLC Punk is easily one of my all-time favorite movies. No, this isn't as good as the original, but it takes place in a time when punk is dead. The magic is gone. There was no magic to begin with. It was an illusion. That's the point!
There's no Steve-O. Bob narrates from beyond the grave. The young punks have grown up and moved on.

7561680,1,B0192PESFG,"I loved the first movie, but I hated this one! The MAIN character is boring and annoying. I'd rather see the dude with the Mohawk or the chick headline the movie. WHYYYYY is a moody GOTH kid the main character of a PUNK movie???? HELLO!?$? The original movie was funny, exciting and sad, at the end. You really cared about the people and what happened.
This movie, the only thing you're forced to care about is some douche dressed like Edgar Allen Poe, trying to become cool, and failing!
Even the reoccurring characters were a huge let down. They aren't about anything except for finding and worrying about the main character. They are parents! That's the vibe they give off. They aren't funny. They aren't cool anymore. They aren't PUNK!
God dam**t! I really wanted to like this, but I could barely get through it. I waited for this movie to come out. I wanted a quick glimpse of my old teenage life, but it wasn't in this movie.
I can't believe that THIS is the sequal to such a great movie.

7561709,1,B0192PESFG,"If I could give this movie zero stars I would. The plot un this movie is very flimsy, it feels rushed, and thankfully it only lasts for an hr and 15 minutes. There is not enough time for any character development in regards to new characters, and the whole movie is based off ""Oh my God my son is drunk!"" Annabeth Gish does not return to pkay Trish, but it is ibstead Sara Clarke who does an absolute awful job. She doesn't even make an attempt to sound like the Trish from the first movvie who we know and love. Heroine Bob narrates the movie with a God awful visible skull cap, and does not even sound like the same Bob, much like Trish, which does not make any sense. All of the characters were horrible cliches of different sub genres, and no mention was made of Steve-O. Bottome line, the first movie was awesome, a second movie did not need to be made at all. Also apparently any negative feedback on Facebook will be deleted and you will be blocked fron the page, which I think is a bit childish.

7561710,1,B0192PESFG,"I've had a few beers, watched the SLC Punk! sequel on Netflix and feeling irate about something. This is the second time that I've had a distinguished ""cult creative force"" rear up and crap on my face with a sequel that is anemic, patronizing and lazy. The first time around was when the Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg/Nick Frost/Nira Park team gave me ""The World's End"" and expected me to cream my shorts because they used the same fruit machine as from ""Hot Fuzz"". To the powers that be that create a cult classic, move on to mainstream success and then think that they can tap into their initial cult fanbase by cobbling together weak-sauce clones of the original emotion and playing word association with the original masterpiece's plot, I have this to say: knock yourself out of the clouds, get the Hollywood out of your veins and do the bleeding work and innovation that landed you in mainstream success in the first place.
  Unrelated to all that, SLC Punk 2 sucks. Flat out. The two redeemable features of it are the quote that ""John the Mod turned Black Metal type"" makes at the end that more or less sums up my feelings against Christianity, and the fact that they got the original actors who played as Heroin Bob, Sean the homeless punk, John the Mod, Eddie the Metrosexual ladies man and Trish to come back. Wait a minute...they didn't get the actress who played as Trish! They grabbed some Twilight supporting character and filled her in expecting that I wouldn't find out! What the heck is this?!
  Overall, the sequel is a very rushed piece of trash that uses a cookie cutter to take plot elements and themes from the original to make a weak-sauce sequel. We start out by having Heroin Bob's ghost fill us in on the fact that he got Trish pregnant before he died, and that his son, Ross, has grown up as a goth working in his Mom's SLC-based steampunk novelty shop. He stays extremely straight (no drugs, cigarettes or alchohol) and falls in love with a fellow Victorian-era cosplayer until he walks in on her apathetically cheating on him (almost exactly like the scene from the first film where Steve-O walks in on Sandy, only Ross doesn't beat the guy unconscious). Rearing from this devastation, he joins his friends Penny (has a scumbag father, like Heroin Bob) and Crash (played by rapper, yes, RAPPER Machine Gun Kelly) and goes on a detour before showing up to a punk rock concert while his mother frets and calls on her three friends left from the original movie (Sean, John and Eddie). Throughout the 75 minute movie, Ross sinks into depression, gets drunk and takes drugs for the first time (a weak carbon copy of the acid drop scene from the first one), goes to a punk show and insults the audience before being beat on, and rebels against his former rebel mother (akin to, you guessed it, the scene where Steve-O does the same thing in the first film).
  Overall, the movie strikes me as the result of somebody out of touch with the themes of the first one naively over-analyzing the script, highlighting the ""major moments"" and trying to replicate it in a weak manner. Unfortunately, that naive idiot is the same person who wrote, directed and overall created the first movie. I read somewhere that he stated that he made the movie when he was ""young and naive"" and tried to make a sequel crowdfunded by fans that would ""get it right"". Well you know what, James? The first film perfectly captured the attitudes and anxieties of a young rebel being forced to look at growing up. It was rich, original, unique and edgy. It also stressed the zeal a punk (or really, any devotee or acolyte to any genre or movement) feels in regards to ""purifying"" his cause and tribe from the ""posers"". Yet, this sequel you dished out has one of the more strict characters from the first film openly embracing all derivatives and spinoffs of the hardcore punk genre. What the heck, man?
  In sum up, this is a very crappy sequel. The original SLC Punk! was not without its flaws, but believe me when I say that the sequel is absolutely abysmal. Nevermind the fact that Jason Segel didn't want to be a part of this, Matthew Lillard didn't want to be part of this. That says something. Overall, I think you'd get a more fulfilling experience of pretending that ""Without a Paddle"" was the spiritual sequel to SLC Punk!, with Steve-O growing up, becoming a corporate attorney, but neglecting his job because he loves to surf. Or just let SLC Punk! end! If directors are going to treat their fans in the same out-of-touch, patronizing way comic-convention panel emcees treat a room full of Babylon Five fans before Bill Mumy takes the floor, then they can shove their passion-project sequels where the sun doesn't shine.",1470528000,,4717,4.640718562874252

I live in SLC so the first movie has been a club classic around here and just something every teen sees, at least once! Everyone who loved that movie had anxiously been awaiting this sequel and let me tell you, it didn't disappoint! I love how James brought back a few key characters from the original, especially Shawn who was my favorite! This movie follows 3 young punks on a trip to self discovery. It has a lot of great one liners, the characters have been very well developed and you sit there rooting for them to succeed. The soundtrack is superb and you will be singing along while watching!

I was lucky enough to be able to attend the premiere screening in SLC for this and meet a lot of the cast and crew and let me tell you, these guys are top quality! They are all so humble, nice and all around great people!

BUY THIS NOW!! It's sure to be the next cult classic!",1459123200,5,990,4.232804232804233

Puerile, vapid, and cliche, this abortion of a movie is an insult to its predecessor. All the tropes are here: road trip; sophomoric philosophical ramblings; domestic and drug abuse; concert clips.

7561782,4,B0192PESFG,"I watched this last night via Amazon Instant Video. I've been following this production for quite some time on social media and couldn't wait to see it. I'm a big fan of the first film (it's one of my favorites), and not even mentioning the character of Steve-O made me think it would hurt the film. This is not the case. Having Bob back (as the narrator/ghost) made me feel all happy. He acts exactly the same as he did in the first one, although now, he looks older...which makes me feel old. Sean (takes 100 hits of acid in the first one by accident), and John the Mod are in this one, and the plot revolves around Bob and Trish's kid disappearing. So they're trying to find him. The film is watching Bob's son ""grow up"" with his friends, while they're on their way to a punk show, but taking the long way there. Ross (Bob's kid), is not a punk. He's not into punk music, doesn't look like a punk, doesn't act like a punk...he's just...Ross. He's into death. He's a weird dude. His two friends for the ride Crash (played by Machine Gun Kelly...who was awesome in this btw), and Penny are also great characters. The end hit me like a ton of bricks. Not in a bad way, just a big emotional feeling came over me. The soundtrack is outstanding. While the first one had older punk bands like The Exploited, Ramones, and Adolescents, this one has newer punk bands like Rancid, NOFX, and The Dwarves.

The acting is great. The film looks outstanding. I know this had a lot of help using social media fundraiser campaigns, and it's great. I'm happy to see that the money went to the sound and look of the film.

I highly recommend this one. I give it a 4 out of 5...it's a great movie. It's funny, it's sad, it's got a great soundtrack. The ONLY reason I took a star away from this...is it's REALLY short. It's an hour and fifteen minutes WITH credits. Credits are about 3-5 mins depending on the movie. I would've liked to see a little more of the characters. But I guess that means you guys did a good job with it then :)

Definitely rent this one if you're on the fence about it.",1458000000,2,2076,4.290816326530612

It seemed to lack any real direction and definitely didn't have any of the spark of the original.
