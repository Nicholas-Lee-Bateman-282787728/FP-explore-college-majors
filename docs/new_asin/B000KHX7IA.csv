8157072,4,B000KHX7IA,I originally checked this out from our local library when looking for video instruction in beginning guitar for my 10 year old. I studied guitar in my youth and still play. The presenter is likable and has a very nice style that is conversational and still detailed. The structure of the program is good and one can pick and choose different subjects. The best recommendation I can make is that we checked it out for free and purchased it to have it at home.,1194220800,2,458,4.464285714285714

I assume it was all that was indicated by others who had received it.",1173312000,,116,3.8333333333333335
