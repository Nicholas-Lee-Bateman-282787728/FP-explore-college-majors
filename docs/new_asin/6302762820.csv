509376,5,6302762820,"Just as I thought. I knew that Beverly Hills 90210 was going to go off air.  First of all, I would like to thank all of the staff, who made this show very plesant to watch. Second of all, I would like to thank the stars who did a very nice job on portraying for the show.  I will especially miss all of the stars including Jason Priestley and Jennie Garth who are my 2 absolute favorites.  Thanks Jason and Jennie!  You've been a very big help to me!!",993945600,2,451,4.033707865168539
509377,4,6302762820,"Anybody who wanted to see why 90210 reached out to teens the way Saved By The Bell and a million other shows could not, only needs to see this episode.
By far one of the most well written and memorable, it contains  angst, romance and drama all in one little cassette. Being a devout  Brenda/Dylan shipper, my only regret (and the reason why I cannot give it 5  stars)is that America's favirote TV couple was by then split up.  Understanding the all important pursuit of ratings, I still thought the  scriptwriting decision was one of the first that ultimately undercut the  sucess of the show.
Even though it's not for something reall heady and  intense (civil rights, against a war, for the environment etc...) the  resolute determination that ""Donna Martin graduates"" portrayed  teens in a positive light. To actually write a script where Beverly Hills  teens care about eachother to risk losing graduation (and presumable  admission to all sorts of fancy schools) is truly revolutionary.
Especially if you dislike the soapish backstabbing of later years, this  would make a wonderful edition to your collection. Although there is some  backstabbing with the Kelly-Dylan-Brenda triangle, it pales in comparision  to Donna's dilema and the subsequent protest. ""The Gang"" is shown  in all of their glory caring about each other and helping out the less  fortunate.",964483200,5,1365,5.053811659192825
509378,5,6302762820,"I have been watching Bev since I was 13 years old. I never missed one episode. Even if I had to work, I would somehow switch shifts with someone just so I could watch this show. It has become part of my life...sad to  say. I will truly miss this show. This graduation episode brings back  memories. Donna almost not being able to graduate because she was drunk at  the prom. Her whole class outside chanting her name as she is being talked  to by the school board.(Like that would really happen in real life.) But  honestly, this episode is not as good as the last episode, but this video  sure will go down in history. The show for many of us has become a part of  our life. We will look at our kids years from now as they laugh at us  because our favorite show will be a re-run. I recomend this video or any  Bev video. I hope that they do a reunion. Get this video!",960336000,,868,4.088757396449704
509379,5,6302762820,"This video is a must for anyone who loves 90210. It gives bits and pieces of the first two seasons, which brings back happy and sad memories of the characters. The video also talks about the character's feeling about  graduating from high school and about leaving each other. If you have  graduated or going to graduate from high school, this video will make you  feel sad as you recall high school experiences. The saddest scene is at the  end when they are looking at the sign that says, West Bev 93 and are  staring at it. This is a video that you will love to own about all of the  90210 characters!",959731200,21,603,4.339285714285714

509381,5,6302762820,Beverly Hill 90210 is the only thing I watch on Wednesday nights. After this season it's going off the air. What a bummer!,948326400,2,122,4.3478260869565215
509382,5,6302762820,I love 90210 and have wathched it from the beginning. I will continue to watch it until the day it goes off air and will miss it. The graduation was great all the actors were great in it and I hope another tape comes out  soon.,925603200,,227,3.9347826086956523

7830814,3,6302762820,"What's up with the description glitch? Those in the 9021""know"" are well aware that the gang at West Bev. tossed their blue caps in 1993, not 1990. That would make them older than I am, & it's just not true in the world of Aaron Spelling. (Sadly, many of the actors are much older in reality...). The lastest rumor I heard for postponing the series release on DVD is that in order to do so, they must re-purchase the rights to the music from the episodes, and as we all know, many, many bands were featured throughout the 10 year run (not to mention all the great background music from the Peach Pit jukebox). C'est la vie...for now we must watch our beat up VHS tapes with missing episodes and wait for the glorious day when we can ""call in sick"" for a week and watch the series as it was intended...non-stop on DVD!

p.s. I gave this a 3-star rating only b/c I'm miffed at waiting so long for the DVD series.",1137974400,2,909,4.254335260115607
7830815,1,6302762820,I am giving this one star ONLY because it is on VHS and not DVD.  I don't even own a VCR anymore and had to watch it at someone elses house!!  The day that they come out with all ten seasons on DVD I will buy them all and really wish I could now!  I just bought the pilot episode on DVD and am hoping that this will sell well and that they'll go on to put all the seasons on DVD already.  I know there is still a huge worldwide fan base who would purchse them!!!,1105228800,5,462,3.731958762886598
7830816,5,6302762820,"Hey, for all of you out there who can watch the show on reruns, consider yourselves lucky! I live in Canada, and they have never, never EVER shown reruns of 90210 here, only when it was still on the air. Ever since the last show there have been no reruns, and even the beginning episodes only played in reruns in the early 90's. So quit bitc*in and consider yourselves lucky you can still watch reruns. If they showed reruns here I would program my VCR to watch them or sacrifice getting up early. 90210 is a great show and I'll buy this episode, I too wish they would come out with 90210 on DVD. There is an online petition somewhere online but I don't think it's going anywhere. Anyway, 90210 forever!",1069372800,,703,4.374045801526718
7830817,4,6302762820,I truly enjoyed watching the graduation on video and I will watch it again and again. I am a huge fan of 90210 and the reruns have become all but impossible to watch on FX. They only show it at 7a and 8a I really wish they would put the entire season on DVD. They might be surprised as to how well it would still sell. I am sure there are plenty out there who agree. So for all you out there that are still huge fans maybe we should work on this!,1056499200,15,446,3.806451612903226
