8671337,2,B00MB9BJ5I,"This purchase is deceptive. It is listed as a DVD but it looks a VHS recording from a VCR in the slow mode. It is horrible quality. I have been wanting this for a very long time and am glad I got it but if anybody knows of a quality recording, PLEASE let me know. A quality VHS tape would be acceptable, but prefer a DVD.

Thank you",1435881600,5,332,3.8823529411764706

8671339,3,B00MB9BJ5I,"As with anything; the book was more interesting (more details) but this was a good dramatization of the event.  I think with perhaps a remake, the CGI and alien experience would make this more interesting to watch. I was sorry they did not dramatize what Barney was seeing through the binoculars and the real fear in what they saw.  The casting and acting was perfect though.  This focused more on the relationship of the two of them; their interviews with Dr. Simon; and the effect the event had on their lives.  I remember this story in the newspaper back in the 1960s when it occurred.  So I have always wanted to see this movie.",1412294400,4,632,4.508771929824562
8671340,1,B00MB9BJ5I,"First, let me say that Amazon gets 5 stars for their customer service. They were efficient, supportive and more than resolved the issue satisfactorily. Kudos!

However, the quality of the product was awful. This was ""a burned"" copy of a video tape, a bad video tape of a wonderful made for TV movie that featured two titanic performances by James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons. It is obvious that the tape that the DVD was copied from was smeared and extremely grainy. Further, the sound was overly loud and distorted. Granted it didn't cost much, but that isn't the point is it?",1412035200,6,580,4.686274509803922
8671341,5,B00MB9BJ5I,"The Earthstation1 version is the best of the non-official releases of this film (which has never had an official release) I've come across. It has nothing in the way of extras, and comes in a CD-size trimcase with the advertised picture on the cover. But it has a crisp, clear picture, free from artifacts or lacunae within the film, which so many other versions have. Highly recommended.",1410739200,3,388,4.8059701492537314
