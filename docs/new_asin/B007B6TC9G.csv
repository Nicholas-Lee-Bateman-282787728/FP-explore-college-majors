8513703,4,B007B6TC9G,"The Three-Way Match: Kenny King vs. Alex Payne vs. Silas Young was just a bunch of rollups and covers. The Kevin Steen vs. Claudio Castagnoli match was nicely paced at best. The Necro Butcher & Jerry Lynn vs. Brodie Lee & Delirious (w/Jimmy Jacobs) tag match was not great but pretty good. The #1 Contenders Match: Bryan Danielson vs. Tyler Black vs. Austin Aries vs. Jimmy Jacobs was too TNAish but still good in its' own right. The ROH World Title match: Nigel McGuinness vs. El Generico was a pretty good David-vs-Goliath bout even though this time, Goliath(Nigel McGuinness) won. The Steel Cage Warfare: Brent Albright, Roderick Strong, Ace Steel, Erick Stevens & Jay Briscoe vs. Adam Pearce, Davey Richards, Tank Toland, Eddie Edwards & Bobby Dempsey (w/Larry Sweeney) was a hardcore,smash-mouth good reminder of NWA's Wargames of the 1980's. I give this event a 7 out of 10.",1413244800,,880,4.912751677852349
