Box included 3 DVDs, 1 covering only Pearl Harbor with the other 2 covering the rest of the Pacific War. The DVDs included video, voice-over, and interviews. It was very thorough for the limited time afforded by 3 disks. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching and re-watching this set. Highly recommend!",1403395200,,466,4.695121951219512

8371867,5,B002KBE91I,To be honest I was a bit hesitant about buying this dvd but I'm really glad I did.  It's definitely worth the money and now a great part of my collection.,1270944000,,154,3.967741935483871
