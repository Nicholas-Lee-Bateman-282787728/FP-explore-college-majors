8333074,4,B001PCR5SC,Pretty good documentary type film.  There was a lot I didn't know and it was interesting to see some of the solutions some people have invented.  I recycle everything but it almost looks as though I have no impact.  Ironically the package is plastic ;),1520208000,,252,4.555555555555555

8333076,5,B001PCR5SC,"The documentary represents a thorough examination of plastic waste around the world and it concludes that the world we live in is made of completely non degradable plastic.

We learn about beaches, ocean floors, and surfaces being covered in plastic waste, five gigantic garbage patches in the worlds oceans, and that the worlds oceans are being treated as a garbage bin by people all over the planet.
Sealife and coastal wildlife consume, become ill and die as a consequence of our choices. ... Katarina Nolte",1403740800,,510,5.0
8333077,5,B001PCR5SC,"From plastics in the ocean, to plastics in animals, to plastics in us, this documentary covers everything you hoped wasn't true about the disposable mindset of humanity today.  Traveling across the world, the narrator explains how plastics are made, how recycling happens, what happens when we can't keep up with the recycling demands, and the potential consequences for humans and the world.

I'm a teacher, and it's hard to engage my students -- I actually had a student say, ""Why don't we watch more movies like this??  I learned so much watching it!""",1367884800,,554,4.935483870967742

8333082,5,B001PCR5SC,"Excellent warning regarding the dangers and health effects of plastic in the modern world we live in. Do yourself and our world a favor, toss all of the plastic containers and utensils in your kitchen. Problem is where do you toss them.  I put mine in my recycling bin and hope they aren't recycled into to some other horrible plastic product.  Don't buy plastic products anymore. Use glass and ceramics that are lead free.
