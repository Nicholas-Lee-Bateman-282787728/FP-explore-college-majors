8301266,5,B001F7Q4KW,"I have pre-ordered this DVD for my nephew. He is almost 4-years old and loves the Magic Cellar series shown on HBO Family. This is a great program for children. It is very educational by teaching children through storytelling about fundamental values. There is a lesson to learn in each of the story episodes that involves the consequences of not sharing, selfishness, being untruthful, not caring for the nature and the environment, and not being respectful of others in addition to many more. This is the type of programming that you would expect to see on PBS or Noggin.

There isn't any information above about the indidvidual episodes included on the DVD, except that they are episodes 1-5. I was able to find a synopsis of each of the episodes online.

The jackal sees his reflection in the river and the hare tricks the jackal into believing his reflection is really anther jackal. As a result, the hare is able to escape. Sometimes when it is truly necessary, it is acceptable to bend the truth a little to stay out of danger.

This is great family programming and I would recommend it to anyone with children ages 3-years to 10-years old.",1227052800,2,2862,4.644268774703558
