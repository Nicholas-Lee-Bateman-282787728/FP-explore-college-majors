8667100,4,B00LO1SWUO,"if you like pure talk and debate and philosophical films, this is one for you. This is an Australian film, and one night when the priest is closing up shop he gets a late night visit from an ultra violent young man who has questions. It is obvious he is hurt, but how hurt we don't know. The discussions and arguments get very heated and loud. Very interesting and very well written and acted. This is virtually a 2 man movie and they are both  terrific. I did hit the fast forward 2 times though, some draggy parts. Sometimes very poetic. sometimes too flowery. the reason for 4 stars? IT was very dark and I mean dark as no light, I found that very distracting and I did drift. The low candle light in the back was not enough to hold me.",1434931200,,739,4.204225352112676
