5925737,4,B00EKFI1HA,It was a nice conclusion of the series.  I was a little disappointed that it was not continued but nice job anyway.,1398038400,,115,4.2272727272727275

5925739,4,B00EKFI1HA,"My husband and I really enjoyed Season 1 and there is not much that we enjoy watching together, so I ordered this DVD. I knew it wouldn't play on our DVD player, however, I thought it would play on my laptop. It didn't. BUT it did play on my husband's computer! So every night we huddle together watching an episode. We are too cheap to purchase the correct DVD player just to watch this item and besides we're enjoying our special, different time together. I wish that this series would keep going and going.",1397952000,2,509,4.425531914893617
5925740,5,B00EKFI1HA,"I absolutely adore this series and was so sad when it ended.  I ordered the Region 2 DVD because I live in the U.S. and couldn't get the second season any other way.  Yes, I did have to buy a multi-region DVD player, but found a great Sony model here on Amazon for a great price.  I highly recommend the series and once you watch the first season, do as I did....buy this DVD and get the Sony DVPSR370.",1397865600,28,402,4.063291139240507

5925747,5,B00EKFI1HA,The Paradise has a great story to tell about people striving to overcome odds place in their lives by society and other obstacles. They add that one can not do all that needs to be done alone.,1477612800,,192,4.216216216216216

5925755,4,B00EKFI1HA,"I like this show, but it's like most stories of that era, slow-moving and not all that exciting.  The characters are interesting, but the most interesting ones don't seem to get much character development.  There is some intrigue, but when a very harsh crime is committed, it seems to get very little attention.  The story is really about a woman who works at the store and has a lot of great ideas, at least as many as the manager she falls in love with, and that makes him fall in love with her  but he seems to want to hold her back and as the story moves on she tires of it.  Like I said, slow-moving and not all that exciting.",1469577600,,631,4.181818181818182

5925764,5,B00EKFI1HA,Great show and good story. Too bad it got cancelled after 2 seasons because it was competing with Mr. Selfridge. I am happy the last episode of the 2nd season ended well. I don't like when a show is cancelled on a cliff-hanger.,1465344000,,227,4.3023255813953485

5925770,4,B00EKFI1HA,It is very interesting to think about how the concept of department stores developed and the challenges they had to grow.

5925801,3,B00EKFI1HA,"We loved the first season so much that we couldn't wait for the second.  It's good, but it somehow doesn't hit the spot like the first season.  The actors all did great jobs, so that's not it.  It's mostly how everything turned out, which is probably the fault of the author!!!",1453939200,2,277,4.392156862745098

5925803,2,B00EKFI1HA,"We loved the first season of The Paradise and looked forward to binge watching this one. Unfortunately, a lot of the magic and mystery is missing in this season. Absurd contrivances and plot-complications are added to keep the romantic leads apart and lead to ""interesting"" stories. Two episodes or so achieved the levels of bad first season episodes, but avoid this if you can.",1450051200,,378,4.921875

5925805,5,B00EKFI1HA,"Possibly the best series ever. I can't believe it was canceled after two seasons. The entire cast is magnificent for the two separate years this ran. A third season could easily be crafted based on the end episode concluding proposed venture which I will not spoil for others to see fresh for the first time.

I have to agree with another poster that often the best shows are canceled early while complete crap continues to survive year after year.

If you like smart plot development and hilarious humor laced throughout this is the show for you.

I would give The Paradise ten stars if I could.

The executives who canceled this show deserve jail time.

5925867,5,B00EKFI1HA,"Watched these two seasons on PBS and Netflix -- such a delightful period piece! Compelling characters, charming and intriguing story lines, and beautiful settings. I much prefer it to Downton Abbey. (and do NOT confuse this with the other ""store keeper"" series, Mr Selfridge, which is truly insufferable... The Paradise is based on the socialist-themed book Au Bonheur des Dames, by famous author Emile Zola.)",1432252800,,409,5.3076923076923075

5925912,5,B00EKFI1HA,"This is one of the absolute best British shows I have ever seen. Every part of this show ranks high, in my opinion. The characters, the settings, the plots, make this series worth watching. It could be compared to the quality of Downton Abbey. Unfortunately, I have learned that this show has been pulled because it competed with a similar show named ""Mr. Selfridge"". So that I had something to compare to I actually decided to watch ""The Paradise"" competition. I could only stomach one episode of ""Mr. Selfridge"" myself, so apparently I have very different views about what is considered quality television. Personally I think the BBC needs to bring The Paradise back. It is the kind of show that I am willing to pay to watch (which I did), alternatively, I wouldn't pay a nickel to watch ""Mr. Selfridge"".",1425513600,,806,4.723404255319149

I enjoy the whole department store aspect from the displays to the gimmicks they use to draw customers in.  And, of course, the people who work there, how they make it all work; their lives and their intrigues. And there's a lot of intrigue.

Season two is okay, they bring in some new characters, like a female french designer who prefers women to men, although she flirts shamelessly with men whenever she gets a chance, and we also get to learn more about Katherine's husband (who by the way is a  womanizer and can be quite cruel to Katherine and his daughter). In this season Moray is losing his edge while Denise seems to be operating in her element.

I have written several reviews and this one is to the producers who decided to drop this exceptional series. Sometimes series deserve to be cancelled but not when they are as good as The Paradise. The characters in this series are so well cast and each episode kept you wanting more. This series needs to be finished so it can be placed as one of the finest ever made. Downton  Abbey as successful as it is has much slow and tedious chapters , this series doesn't , Based on the novel by Zolla it is very well crafted and has many twists .

The story is much better, more intimate, more believable than the similar and popular episodes of 'Mr. Selfridge'. The main character is not a disloyal husband, rather, he is a stand-up good man who falls in love with a pretty, brilliant, shop manager. There were also many twists and turns and much intrigue with other characters. A shopping experience one won't forget.",1421193600,,527,4.802197802197802

Several of the actors showed talent, but most appeared to be valiently trying and floundering.  Sorry, we did so want it to be a good DVD, up to our standards of outstanding Brit. acting.

5926035,1,B00EKFI1HA,"For a show that had so much potential to achieve excellence, I was sorely disappointed with the second season and understand why Mr. Selfridge won out its spot on BBC. To go from an endearing love story, to a vomit inducing feministic-elitist plot completely ruined the entire story line; in the same fashion that Mr. Selfridge shortly lost my favor. During the late 1800s to early 1900s, it is historically accurate to highlight the feminist movement - for that, the writers receive credit; however, to be so short sighted as to limit the potential of the story line by injecting too much of a historical topic, I presume to endorse some hidden agenda, the result was the tragic disfigurement of a momentous show. I have not read the book, but feel that this show surely does not do justice to the writer's original intent - due to the obvious emphasis on topics and agendas that were not by any means the highlight of that time period. I am truly disappointed, but unfortunately have had to lower my expectations with the entertainment industry as very few original thoughts are relayed, and those that are, are infested with hidden ideologies. Do not waste your time with this season.",1419552000,10,1187,4.766990291262136

5926065,3,B00EKFI1HA,"Review contains spoilers:

This was a good show but watching the villain Mr. Westin torture his headstrong wife Katherine endlessly towards the end was abusive and horrible. Watching her go back to him because she's pregnant and suddenly this will make 'everything alright' was abysmal writing and quite unsatisfying viewing.  I was hoping Mr. Westin might die horribly or get caught up in one of his vengeful schemes and end up getting in trouble.

I honestly got a bit tired of the Moray/Denise romance towards the end. I wasn't really feeling it, and was rather bored with the 'does he love me, does he not.' Moray was quite cruel to Katherine and I felt his actions of flirting with her to drive  a wedge between her and her abusive husband caused a lot of suffering. He deserved to lose the paradise because of his dirty tactics.

I like the characters but unsatisfying for me, because Westin didn't suffer enough for being such a jerk to his wife.",1418688000,2,953,4.682634730538922
5926066,5,B00EKFI1HA,Great storyline,1418688000,,15,7.0
5926067,4,B00EKFI1HA,"As you may know, The Paradise was one of my favorite new costume dramas from BBC/Masterpiece Theatre in 2013 (Read my review of The Paradise, Season One). With that cliffhanger involving Moray and Denise at the first season's conclusion, I was a bit devastated. It wasn't a melancholy scene by any stretch, but this impatient girl wanted to know what happened next without waiting an entire year! Sadly season two, while being just as sumptuous and melodramatic as the the series premiere, did not keep my attention as it's predecessor. A few of the familiar faces from last season including Pauline (Ruby Bentall) and Lord Glendenning (Patrick Malahide) were very noticeably absent from the screen. Seeing as Pauline was sort of the comedic relief and such a sweet, fun character and Lord Glendenning was the voice of reason, their absence took away from the story. That said, this season is still worth watching and The Paradise series as a whole is a must-watch for costume drama fanatics.

As noted above, the absence of certain characters was felt, however, the new additions certainly added flair and a uniqueness to the story of the Paradise and it's evolution. Tom Weston (Ben Daniels), the dangerous and flawed new husband of Katherine Glendenning; Myrtle (Lisa Millett), the Paradise's head cook, a new shop girl and a new arrival from Moray's adventures in Paris certainly add tension to the budding romance between Moray and Denise. Season Two deviates from the romance and the spark of forbidden love to focus more on the store itself and whether or not it can survive with two alpha males in Weston and Moray at the helm.

The Paradise series in it's entirety is a first rate drama. Season One is by far the best, as it establishes each of the characters firmly in your heart! Season Two is a bit more ""soapy"" (sabotage, fights, abuse, heart attacks, etc.) than the first series, but it's still worth the watch, especially if you enjoy a sweet love story. The BBC produces the best period dramas on the planet and I really hope they continue to send stories like this across the pond!

5926074,4,B00EKFI1HA,"UPDATE 2: the final episode was really good! They managed to repair more than I thought they could in 52 min. Not all that I hoped for, but knowing they had so little time to work with,  they pulled it off. Changing my 3 stars to four! Wish I could do 3 1/2, though.

UPDATE: I have now watched all but the final episode. I'm going to stick with my three stars. I wasn't sure it deserved even that before. But there are a few redeeming and moving parts in season 2 episodes.  But it still could not live up to season one by any means.  Also, after episode 2 Audry is not in it anymore, another bummer.  I was hoping she would marry and keep her job, though not likely in that time period. And it was obvious Denise would ultimately end up with it, unless she worked alongside Moray after they married, which I hoped for. If they're so in love why can't they share? . I still have to watch episode 8 to see how it ends. . I doubt much can be done in one episode to fix all of the messes. I'm sure the leading couple will be together somehow, if they had any idea the show wasn't coming back. (I watched it on pbs.org when it was on there)

I've only watched the first two episodes of season 2. And I think I know why it was canceled. I can already tell it's not as good as season 1. They took the character of Pauline out, for one thing. I liked her. My husband did to, and enjoyed season one also. The characters chemistry seems to have changed from season one. I don't know if they had new writers for it but it seems the plot line isn't as well written. I would have been better off leaving what happened next after season one to my imagination, though not fully satisfied, than get mixed up in season 2.  Also, season 2 episode 2 had a homosexual lady on it. They didn't talk openly about such things in that time period, so why add it to the show? Trying to make a PG period piece too edgy and modern obviously failed this time. Not to mention that she vulgarly flirts with everyone and gets Dudley drunk, to make him look bad.  When I read/ watch Jane Austin and the like it's not like that.  I'm might watch the rest of the season, we'll see what happens with episode 3...",1418342400,,2178,4.117924528301887

5926103,4,B00EKFI1HA,A great story line and awesome characters. Always some drama and romance in this show. Not as great as Season 1 but definitely worth watching! Katherine is back with her husband and they own The Paradise. John is scheming to get it back. Katherine wants John back. John flirts with Katherine in an attempt to somehow win The Paradise back and is caught by Denise which makes for a very tense couple of episodes where they are on different sides of how their relationship should progress. The street is opening new stores but not under Johns hand and he is falling apart at the seams with losing The Paradise and his dream of owning the whole street of retail stores. Denise is a woman with strong business sense and goals in an era when women are seen and not heard. The whole gang from last season is back with some new faces such as Susie and she is a hoot!,1417737600,,859,4.375

5926127,1,B00EKFI1HA,"I am surprised by the number of 5 star reviews for season 2.  This season is no where near as good as the first!  There were so many things that I didn't like, I'm not sure where to begin.
 I think the writing was terrible and the biggest fault is that the writers didn't stay true to the time period.  After the big fuss in season one when Sam nearly loses his job after he is caught supposedly kissing Catherine's friend, then to have Denise kissed by another woman in season 2 with very little surprise or objection seemed way off to me. And then to have the series end in nearly the exact same way as season 1 except with Denise proposing to Moray and that they will marry after she has made her fortune?! No! That would have never happened! Personal ambitions are more important than relationships? Love is facing your challenges together.  Love is sacrifice.  I so wanted to see Denise and Moray work together to gain the paradise back or start something new altogether.  And then to have the ownership of the paradise resolved over the rolling of dice?  So stupid!  They spent the whole season building this crisis to have it resolved like that?
I also couldn't stand Mr. Weston and his extremely dysfunctional relationship with Catherine!  Are we to believe that moments after Mr. Weston is blackmailing a woman to be his mistress that as soon as Catherine announces her pregnancy that everything is fine?
If you liked season 1 do yourself a favor and don't ruin it by watching season 2.",1417219200,10,1495,4.544776119402985

In particular there is one girl who catches the eye of the owner with her new ideas for the store.  There are two seasons but unfortunately the show was cancelled by  in favor of Mr. Selfridge which is also about the development of a dept store in England.
I preferred this one but I guess the British audience liked Mr. Selfridge because that series is still on.  You can see Mr. Selfridge on Amazon.",1416787200,,619,4.3478260869565215

5926170,5,B00EKFI1HA,"Okay, there are plenty of detailed reviews here (122 of them!) already on Amazon. But be aware that Amazon combines ALL reviews of all formats of a TV series (including broadcast  streaming and DVD and BD) so I always suggest that you both  sort by newest first (if looking for BD and DVD versions) and also looking to see which format is being reviewed. This is really important if the review is of the version that aired on PBS. That is because the PBS episodes were obviously edited for time. On the BD they each run about 61 minutes and  since PBS includes funding breaks and previews of other shows, there must be some editing. There is no graphic language or violence in this series so that is not reason for the edits. With that said. On with my review. .  I won't repeat much of the information from  my Season One review and  will do my best not to provide any spoilers. BOY do I hate spoilers and episode summaries. Fore me they take the joy out of discovering a great story line.

Thuis BBC production which, though created before the ITV production of Mr. Selfridge  another story about the owner of a British department store- made its appearance on PBSs Masterpiece Theater more recently, Mr. Selfridge 2 was released a few months ago (see my review) and now comes Season Two of The Paradise. If you haven't seen Season One, you really need to start there. That show pretty much stands on its own. Season Two takes up the story a year after Season One.  I won't repeat much of the information and do my best not to provide any spoilers.

Youll find my review of Mr. Selfridge here on Amazon and I honestly have to say that I enjoyed both. They are similar yet different. MS is historical fiction and takes place just after 1900; TP was written (in a novel by Emile Zola) to take place in the mid-1800s but was updated to the later 1800s for the television version. Both focus on the owner of the department store as well as his love interest  whether it is his wife or his fiance. And there are side stories about the employees in the store

While Season One focused on the building and success of Londons first department store and the marketing ideas from rising shop clerk Denise (Joanna  Vanderham  who is really the focus of the second season and lights up the room whenever she is on camera), Season  two is all about romance, greed and deceit. The villain here is Tom Weston (a new character) who really is a nasty guy. And he loves to tighten the tension whenever he is on the screen. While I found many fun and happy moments in Season One, I found Season Two much darker. Yes, there is a resolution in the end of the 8 hours of the story but whether you find the resolution to your satisfaction will depend on how you see the personalities of the main characters.  Nearly all the cast from Season One are back with just a few new ones this time.

If I had to compare Season One with Season Two, Id have to give Season One the upper hand at a full five stars. The acting and the gorgeous set design and cinematography are certainly five stars but the script this time was probably closer to four. Still, Im rounding it up to five stars.

There are no bonus features on the DVD or BD as there were on Season One except for English Subtitles  which you probably won't need.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

It's a wonderful program without all the garbage of  many of the American programs and movies. You actually believe you are there at The Paradise when watching. The actors are wonderful. The Paradise originally aired on PBS in the U.S., so that's why you have to wait for each episode to come on Amazon Instant, instead of the full eight episodes you have in the first season. I'm going to miss the series greatly. There is nothing to compare it to or nothing as good. I wish we could've had the time in the U.S.,To sign a petition or something to have tried for a third season. I would have loved to see Denise & Moray's wedding. Katherine's baby.

Elaine Cassidys acting is suburb portraying  such a range of emotions from love to hate from happy to sad  (i.e. every imaginable range of emotion).  Although I am in love with all the characters.

In my opinion the storyline is not as good; the ""culture"" of the store has degenerated into backstabbing, gossip, greed, and ulterior motives, much like the modern workplace.

I believe there is too much comparison between this show and Mr. Selfridge, which is somewhat based on the real person but if it continues to do so not a very happy ending.

I love the subtle acting, the way the main character's role is downplayed - not in your face obvious as so much is today - but she has this depth, sweetness, yet inner strength. You can watch her face and see the thinking going on. There are no cardboard cutouts here. All the characters are multi faceted. Denise's main shop rival, though mean to be a contrast to her, still seems like a real person with  her own struggles. After all she has been somewhat used by the male lead. Anyway, love.

ps, and I do wish all the one star reviews because of incorrect dvd format would post somewhere more appropriate - as it's unfairly dragging down the reviews.",1413763200,3,800,4.355704697986577

Unfortunately, PBS chops it up and cuts out parts which are the nuggets, I get the whole episode with Amazon, which is greatly appreciated.

The user interface on the TV leaves much to be desired -- and where does one turn on the sub-titles since the audio is so poor. 2. Video looks like I am actually watching an old worn-out VHS tape - I would imagine that the HD version is superior but the non-hd is 'unacceptable'.  3. Downloading, or at least start of the streaming takes 2-3 times that for Netflix equivalent (at least for the two episodes I have watched) -- would the HD version take even longer to download I wonder?. 4. Audio track is poor, again compared to a similar episode of the same series (at least the one from the first season) seen on Netflix.

5926333,1,B00EKFI1HA,"season 2 esp 2... script ...awful just sunk into day time soap opera...  a new low...like ""Dallas"" ( the 80's American  tv show) in its 3rd horrid season.  c/on!  ALL the men 'hot for Frenchie?'.... the tart/lesbian? even Dudley?  horrific, then silly... could have created depth of character and interest and contrast. He would NEVER  have succumbed to a tainted seductress ( not  even pretty)....but, then this provided the redemption opportunity for Arthur and 'one armed man' with Dudley etc ( good  job script writers)... we all love a redemption story ( he helped Dudley/ yet  this was merely extension of his still 'blind' loyalty for Moray's late wife and Moray) Then... the depraved scene b/t Kathrine and husband ( yikes zero love  here just revenge and vindictiveness run amok and they have  his daughter to raise?) stating she knows she cannot stop his philandering so 'just do it in the house' and then kissin' nose nuzzling.... triple yuck.... and that she will 'love' him /pick him back no matter what he does?... to keep up appearances for the public and for well...you know who!! He resembles Katherine's (late) father ewwww. and acts even more depraved.  And silly unbelievable... the apathy /where is the outrage at the so obvious intent to break Moray/ The Paradise when it's obvious that the shop boy was paid/blackmailed by 'prospective buyer' to ruin the store. The 'so smart'  Denise, 'my lil champion' like a fool even when she knew?  What about newspapers saying the truth? let public/ outcry decide... Yet my favorite, Miss Audrey from first season: ""Girl, girl, you are having an idea.... I said no.""  Denise: ""Yes miss Audrey."" Perfect role and acting. I also really like Clara. Perfect, now lets get her back with her daughter in the foundlings home for a real redemption and SOME love and good news! a real good man for Clara and her daughter.... can we have one 'release'/ piece of goodness? Let Clara evolve into the goodness we know is there! ( no hope for Katherine tho)",1412812800,6,2005,4.821637426900585

That said I foolishly ""purchased"" Season 2, Episode 1, thought I had already seen it for free on PBS ROKU channel. I should have realized that only the first episode of Season 2 was available on Amazon when I could not figure out a way to access Episode 2 of Season 2.

I hope it will be reissued in the current of the USA.  This is one of the finest of Masterpiece TV programs, second only to Downton Abbey.  Try season 1 if you have not done so. You will surely enjoy it.",1410307200,,360,3.824324324324324

I cant get enough of Denise and I enjoyed the second season but I thought they ended it too abruptly, I wish the writers had kept the show going in spite of the competition, perhaps the money wasn't available to do so.

I was disappointed that NetFlix did not have the second season but this is yet another reason why Amazon prime is amazing and is a must have.. I can not believe, BBC removed this show. There must be a law against dropping a show no matter how bad it does. For myself, I would have never watched this show if I didn't finish the first episode.  Perhaps, if BBC thinks the show is doing bad, they need to make a deal withe Amazon prime and NetFlix in lieu of dropping the show. Thank you Amazon.",1409529600,,657,4.214285714285714

5926360,4,B00EKFI1HA,"I thoroughly enjoyed Season 2 of The Paradise. So much has been lost by our hero, John Moray and the machinations and intrigues  to keep him as well as remove him are delicious! There is a wonderfully evil new villain on the scene in the form of the new husband of Moray's ex-fiance. Moray's love for Denise is as strong as ever and the two lovers suffer many ups and downs in this series. Madame Audrey finally ""retires"" and There is so much to keep the viewer wanting more. I don't want to give too much away as almost every single episode would have to have a  ""spoiler alert"" and that would ruin one's viewing pleasure, but suffice it to say, this series is delightful with the usual gorgeous period dresses, the magic of the Paradise, people returning who we least expect and the usual delicious gossip.

I did a simple search on how to change the region code of the DVD player on my laptop and was able to view all 8 episodes of this season perfectly! I am a big fan of BBC productions, and thoroughly enjoyed this one. I prefer it to Selfridge (another similar series centered around the early development of 'the department store'). I was saddened to hear that they will not be continuing the series and will be looking next to read the book on which the series was based.  I loved all the actors who so wholly encompassed an endearing cast of 'characters' in this saga. Each season is well developed and closes nicely, so that nothing is open-ended.

I am so disappointed that they will not be making a season 3 of this series. I watch the other dept store series also, Mr. Selfridge, and enjoy it, but not like The Paradise. I could not take my eyes off it. I really can't understand why they wouldn't continue this series. It's such a nice one.

This far outweighs the Mr. Selfridge series.,1398124800,29,387,4.12

Why would you sell items that you are not able to view in the United States.  another thing is when I went to return this to the UK the postage cost as much as what I paid for the item and the postage combined to get it.
