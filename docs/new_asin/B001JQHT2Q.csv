3659096,4,B001JQHT2Q,"This is a beautiful but disturbing period film about an especially successful, especially tragic geisha. It is breathtaking, visually striking, funny, and intense at best... at its worst, there are moments that feel comically over-the-top, comically over-sensational. (Of course this WAS the '80s...) Those intrigued by the ""do they or don't they?"" mystery of geisha's sex lives will have a lot to chew on after watching this film. This is like ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" but it felt much more ""Japanese,"" much more believable: raw, gritty, and unforgettably glamorous.",1285027200,6,565,5.359550561797753

8313450,3,B001JQHT2Q,Movie was abit violent but a very interesting story and culture. Reading the word captions was a bit challenging for me.,1396915200,2,120,4.761904761904762
8313451,4,B001JQHT2Q,"This film is a good corrective to the sanitized picture of geisha life presented in ""Memoirs of a Geisha."" Though not totally coherent--the conflicts among different groups of yakuza need a second viewing to totally grasp--- it has an authentic feel and some beautifully staged scenes that dazzle the eye.",1389052800,,305,5.12
8313452,5,B001JQHT2Q,"I love this movie, it is sad but it's a great story to watch over and over. I enjoy it every time I watch. You would think for it being an older movie that there would be really corny acting but I guess that's just the difference between American and Japanese acting during those days. Most of our country was focussed on working, which is just as great as another country who already has done that to focus on perfecting a way of relaxing.",1371513600,,440,4.25
8313453,5,B001JQHT2Q,This gave me the opportunity to dispel inaccurate information about the life of a real geisha.  So many facts woven into a heartfelt story.,1369612800,,139,4.791666666666667
8313454,3,B001JQHT2Q,"I got surprised because the rating, 18, and ""nudity and violence"" were only on the backside (appropriately enough) of the disc case, which was not shown and not mentioned at the site nor by any reviewers, and I read them all.  I do think it ought to be mentioned SOMEwhere up front or by SOMEone amongst the reviewers. I think Amazon should require sellers to list ratings information; it isn't a great deal to ask of the sellers since the information is right there on the back, apparently.",1316304000,,491,4.579545454545454
8313455,5,B001JQHT2Q,"Anyone who has seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memoirs-of-a-Geisha/dp/B000EHRVMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memoirs of a Geisha</a>&nbsp;should have to watch this film for balance.  ""The Geisha"" (Japanese title, ""Yokiro,"" which is the name of the geisha house), is a true look behind the white make-up and fancy silks of the flower-and-willow world, and into the people who practice the profession.  It isn't elegant or pretty.  Geisha are like ballet dancers who exude grace and beauty while hiding bruised and damaged feet under dainty pink sandals.

The story follows Momowaka (Ikegami Kimiko,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House/dp/B003WKL6X0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House</a>), the daughter of a female-procurer and his geisha lover.  Her mother was murdered when Momowaka was a child, and her father (Ogata Ken,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vengeance-Is-Mine/dp/B000NOK0GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vengeance Is Mine</a>) sold her to the Yokiro geisha house when she was twelve.  Under the harsh tutelage of the Mistress of Yokiro Momowaka has grown to become the top geisha in the most famous geisha house in Western Japan.  She is perfect in form and figure, but empty inside and cold like a statue.  Momowaka frustrates her patrons who find that although they can rent her body they cannot touch her heart.  Her father, a blunt and hard dealer in flesh, is neither a good man nor a bad one.  He sells his daughter to a geisha house and his underage lover to a brothel with little regret, but at the same time he has single-handedly protected Yokiro from the influence of the yakuza gangsters for years.  He has kept the geisha district a haven for pleasure-seekers, but like everyone in the district, he is getting older and his enemies are getting bolder. Even timeless traditions cannot carry on forever.

As you can see by the DVD box, ""The Geisha"" has won more awards than there are room to print.  The Japanese Academy's 1984 winner for Best Director, Best Actor, Best Cinematography and five other Academy Awards.  It is, needless to say, a great film.  Director Gosha Hideo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wolves/dp/B001B1875C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wolves</a>) is one of the greats of Japanese cinema, and ""The Geisha"" is one of his best films.  He trademarks are everywhere, like vicious fight scenes accompanied by uplifting music, or a slow burning plot that explodes in the final scenes.

There are so many scenes I loved in this film.  There is a great bar scene, where a group of geisha share the establishment with a group of prostitutes.  Although lower of the social scale, the prostitutes are wild and free, and can drink and dance the Charleston, while the geisha are constrained by their position.  The envy mixed with disgust is palatable.  I loved how ""The Geisha"" takes place in Koichi, on the island of Shikoku rather than the more famous Gion district in Kyoto.  There was a time when no major city was without its pleasure quarters, and it is a nice reminder that Kyoto does not have a monopoly on geisha.

As always, Animeigo has done a remarkable job with a remarkable film.  Their dual translation, showing cultural notes along with the dialog, is necessary for the complex relationships of the pleasure quarters, where everyone is ""daddy"" or ""big sister"" or ""mamma"" or ""lord.""",1306108800,13,3509,5.665391969407266
8313456,4,B001JQHT2Q,"This is a good movie for Geisha fans. It portrays large-scale Geisha houses in the 1930's. The hair and makeup are more accurate than Memoirs of a Geisha. It shows the negative side of buying and selling women both as Geisha and prostitutes. The movie has a unique feature in that footnotes kept popping up to explain expressions used by the characters, it also showed the English translations of the songs used by the Geisha. It is artistically presented with lots of color. It had too many subplots that were a little distracting, but overall was a good movie.",1302652800,8,562,4.686868686868687
8313457,5,B001JQHT2Q,"Let me start this review by saying that I had low expectations while going into this movie. But I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was very well done and the story, acting, and cinematography were all exquisite. Now I see why the film's cover-art and backside features a layout of all the awards for best director, best actress, best actor, and winner of Japan Academy awards for 1984. Numerous nominations and ""awards"" were won for this film. I feel that this motion picture, ""The Geisha"", is a true authentic portrayal of Geisha culture. It certainly has a more of a REAL-Geisha (accurate) feeling to it which brings the authenticity of Geisha culture to fruition. If you like the art of film in general, or if you enjoy enlightenment on Geisha culture and the talented form of Geisha traditions, along with good acting, some comedy, and passion, then I would highly recommend this piece of good cinema-making.",1285286400,7,938,4.796296296296297
