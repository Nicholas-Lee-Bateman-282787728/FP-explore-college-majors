7800771,5,0973292903,What isn't there to love about Little House. My girls were raised watching Little House and we're thrilled to have this Season 1 on CD so they can watch anytime they want.,1366156800,,171,4.375
7800772,4,0973292903,"Little House on the Prairie is a good clean series, very watchable. Like anything on planet earth, there are occasional things I might have to explain to my children if I had any, but these are about as clean as you get. And they are entertaining. They take place in earlier America, pioneer times. They reflect community spirit, cooperation, family, honesty and to some extent christian values.",1250726400,3,395,4.91044776119403
