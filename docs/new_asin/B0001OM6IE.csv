2023333,1,B0001OM6IE,"This DVD should be relabelled INTERVAL TRAINING FOR MEN.
It's called Interval Training which is misleading as I thought it was a workout for women. It's not!",1214438400,2,157,4.851851851851852
2023334,5,B0001OM6IE,"This is a great workout for anyone! The aerobics are a little skimpy but b/c the DVD is indexed at the beginning it's no trouble to replay the section if you're so inclined! The weight section is quite aerobic itself if you use 10 lb weights. When you can find a challange after 26 years of working out, it's a delight.",1208736000,4,319,4.245901639344262
2023335,4,B0001OM6IE,"I know it doesnt say ""for men"" on the dvd case but it says that in the intro. I have done workouts on fit tv with Sharon Mann and Cathe and some of those work outs were tougher than this one! I think Gilad is a little old fashioned but over all it is a great workout that can be beneficial to men and woman. I just though it was a little cheesy with all guys and them acting simple at some parts but still good.",1194393600,3,411,3.7906976744186047
2023336,5,B0001OM6IE,Bought this for my husband to get back into shape.  He loves it!!,1168819200,2,65,4.0
2023337,5,B0001OM6IE,"I got a chuckle out of Gilad saying this workout was designed for just for men, because of their ""natural strength and abilities.""  I'm thinking Cathe, Jari & Mindy might have something to say about that!  Despite the forgivable machoism (Gilad is such a cutie, after all!), this is a very good workout.  It is broken down into five intervals:  The first interval is the 7-minute warm up.  The second interval is 17 minutes of cardio - here Gilad utilizes boxing moves, including punches, jabs, and skipping rope.  The third interval is 12 minutes of weights, with some upper body work - shoulders, chest, biceps, triceps - and some lower body work - mostly lunges.  The fourth 12-minute interval uses your own body weight - push-ups, sit-ups, and back extensions.  Gilad does these exercises in circuits and puts a little variation in the moves in each new circuit.  The fifth and final circuit is the 7-minute cool down.  Overall, this was a good total-body workout - some cardio, some upper body, some lower body, some abs, and nice stretching afterward.  Plus, the guys are *so cute* when they are trying to be macho with their high-fiving and growling at each other at the end of the workout :-)  This one's a keeper!",1163894400,32,1222,4.712264150943396
2023338,3,B0001OM6IE,"It doesn't state in the description but this workout is designed for men!  Imagine my surprise to find I was doing a men's workout!  But quite honestly--it is fine for women.  It is basically the same types of moves he does in his other workouts.  I love Gilad but his repoirtoire of moves is limited.  Seems to be a very similar workout most of the time...anyway-just an fyi that it is designed for men. If you like Gilad-you will probably like the workout although-it is actually pretty easy for a men's workout, unless you are a beginner.",1141084800,4,541,4.536082474226804
2023339,5,B0001OM6IE,"This DVD was so, so good.  He really is a great talent and knowledgeable.  I highly reccomend if you want to focus on ""summer abs"" as I call them.  Can't ever go wrong with Gilad.",1115424000,12,179,4.057142857142857
2023340,5,B0001OM6IE,"I love Gilad and his workouts. This video says its designed for men---pah! I do not believe that. I am a 5'3"" 125lb woman that could do this --- it is a great workout for me. Aerobics are good, but I love the strength oriented aspect of this video. Overall, a good buy.",1355097600,,269,4.09433962264151
2023341,2,B0001OM6IE,"I had high hopes for this DVD.  I really wanted to like it...but I did not.  I thought it was boring.  I love Christian contemporary music that is current and on the radio, but I did not like this music.  Also, the instructor did not have much umph.  I am used to a high energy class at my local gym and this is very much more layed back and boring.  The instructor seems very nice, but she just didn't seem too motivational.  I was going to leave well enough alone and not review this DVD, but I actually purchased it due to the rave review from the other person and I wasted my money.  Used it once and will never use it again.  Thought I would give my experience so that other people considering buying will weigh it out before purchasing.  Just wasn't my style of workout or music.",1333584000,,785,4.208053691275167
2023342,5,B0001OM6IE,"Although this video is for ""men"", it is definitely a great workout for women, too.
I currently do a variety of aerobics, free weights and different cardio including running and hiking.
Sometimes I cannot escape the house, though, so I do videos.
Honestly, most of those are Gilad's - I enjoy his style. This video is definitely geared more toward guys though - men should feel comfortable with it.

Besides a warm up and cool down, there is 17 minutes of cardio (not the typical girly aerobics - again geared toward men with jump rope, straddles, kicks, punch combos and jumping jacks)
11.5 minutes of weight interval training that includes squats, lunges, chest, biceps, triceps, lats and shoulders.
12.5 minutes of calisthenics - different kinds of push ups, back exercises, and abs.

I would not purchase this as my ONLY work out, but it is a great addition to my current routine. This workout can easily be made harder by working out with heavier weights.",1332460800,3,959,4.806060606060606
2023343,5,B0001OM6IE,This is a wonderful workout tape for men or women. Gilad is inspirational and very funny.  I enjoy his workouts a lot.,1294531200,,118,4.363636363636363
2023344,5,B0001OM6IE,This is a good video to start on (you do what she does just not as fast)  and to spin on regularly.  I like the music and the workout.  I am sufficiently tired and ready to be done at the end.  This is the best spin video that I own.,1294185600,10,233,3.6
2023345,5,B0001OM6IE,"I own almost all of the Gilad DVDs (including the one by his sister Ada).  This is, by far, his best all around workout and the one from which he developed his later ""body sculpting"" series of shows and videos.  No funny dance moves, no grapevines.  Just basic training like cardio manuevers (jumping jacks, knee lifts, et al) and straight forward weight and floor circuits.  I find myself using this DVD frequently, especially on days when I want a straight forward no-nonsense workout after work that won't grind me into the ground (like the Bob Harper or Jeri Love videos).  Unfortunately, this one, like most of his DVDs, is dated (filmed back in the early 90s with music to match).  As with all Gilad videos, the cues and form are perfect.",1289088000,6,744,4.641221374045801
2023346,4,B0001OM6IE,"I am 26 years old (female) and I have been working out with Gilad since I was 13 (my mom had all his tapes, so I used them too:) Anyway, I hadn't done a Gilad workout in about a year when I found the interval training dvd and decided to use it. I was a little put off at the beginning when he says it's just for men, but I can say that there was nothing ""just for men"" about the workout. It might be difficult for a woman who is out of shape, but I attend strength training classes (for women) at a gym, and all of his exercises I have done at the gym. And I can say I have a much harder workout at the gym. But this DVD is not bad for at home use, and women shouldn't be afraid of it :) My one complaint is that I don't really like how he does only 10 repetitions and then moves to the next exercise. I would rather do a lot more repetitions in a row.",1257465600,2,852,3.738888888888889
2023347,5,B0001OM6IE,"This is one of my favorite workouts and I do it several times a week.  I have a three-shelf bookcase full of workout videos and I choose this one because it's a perfect mix of cardio and strength training.  The cardio has a variety including jacks, high knees, marching fast, football drill types, boxing punches, etc.  I love the weight routine, I started out using 5 lb weights with it and I'm using 8 lb and 10 lb now really feel it the next day. Gilad and the rest are a little cheesy at times, but in a funny way ""come on boys, come on guys, come on men"". What I like about Gilad's style is it's just about the exercise, there isn't any filler chatter or gimmicks.  I like that if you want you can easily skip the ab/floor section and go right to cooldown too if you are pressed for time and you still get a good 40 minute workout.",1256428800,,836,4.1419753086419755
2023348,5,B0001OM6IE,"Even though this was made in 1990, interval training is the best way to train.  The fact that it's on the beach with the waves roaring is great.  Beautiful setting. I love everything about this DVD and I think Gilad is a great trainer.  I pretend I'm on a fitness vacation when I do this workout.",1253577600,2,296,4.25
2023349,5,B0001OM6IE,"For a number of reasons, I was very surprised to see that this workout was designated for men. But, truth be told, I figured that meant that it would be more difficult than most workouts, so that's precisely why I tried it. My exercise background: The FIRM, Jillian Michaels (BFBM, NMTZ, Shred), and TaeBo. I am 29, and still have about 15 to 20 lbs to lose. I work out 3 to 6 times a week. This was my first Gilad workout.

This workout is excellent! The cardio interval (17 minutes) is fairly intense because you are doing jumprope-type moves much of the time. He provides a few short breaks where you walk in place, and they all came exactly when I needed them. His cuing and form points are excellent, to say the least. I always appreciate when an instructor is reminding me to keep my knees soft and my abs tight (or whatever). He is also very encouraging and motivating, constantly saying, ""Good job."" And, just by looking at Gilad, I can tell that he is enjoying himself!

I also liked the crew, too. They were enthusiastic, and I appreciated that this video featured not only a diversity of ethnicities, but ages as well. I love to see various subcultures represented in workout videos. Love it.

Beginner modifications are explained and/or demonstrated for many exercises. For the push ups, I started in regular military style, and then just went to my knees when I needed to (the ""beginner"" in the video, of course, did all his push ups on his knees). I HAD NO PROBLEMS keeping up with this workout. None whatsoever. It was excellent, and I completed it in it's entirety!

If you're a woman and you're considering this workout, simply ignore the ""For Men"" part. I don't even know why they put that in there. It unnecessarily alienates a whole gender (Hello, marketing geniuses...). This workout is excellent for women and men alike. I'm glad I did it!",1249948800,2,1861,4.596385542168675
8015862,5,B0001OM6IE,I love this DVD!!! I use it all the time!!! It's like a real spinning class!!!! Great workout!!!!! 100% A+++++++,1515628800,,112,4.65
8015863,3,B0001OM6IE,"I usually like and truly enjoy all Gilad workouts.  Have and have done a wide variety of his workouts, from low impact, to step, etc).  However, this was the worst one ever used and did not care for it.  It is more geared towards men (and I'm not biased) with mostly jump roping and boxing moves.  Great workout for the calves; however wound up with plantar fascitis issues/heel issues for several months after doing this work out.  Could be coincidence but....",1509667200,,461,4.6419753086419755
8015864,5,B0001OM6IE,"This workout really gets the heart pumping.
The key is to stop or slow down when you have to.
Because you are in control of the workout/DVD, you can pause and restart when you are able.",1458000000,,185,4.166666666666667
8015865,5,B0001OM6IE,It will tone and strengthen the exerciser and instruction given and timing for each exercise was easy to follow. Beginners as instructed should do two sets and work their way up to third set of interval training reps,1440028800,,216,4.7105263157894735
8015866,5,B0001OM6IE,Very good work out good for advanced workouts,1428364800,,45,4.75
8015867,5,B0001OM6IE,"I have always loved Gilad and his ease at following his videos, especially since I have two left feet. Easy to follow and felt great afterwards although I was sore for several days! Just means that I need to workout more often!! Love Gilad and would tell women that this video is not just for men, if you are in good shape it will be a breeze and fun to do daily. Enjoy the burn.",1427500800,,379,4.066666666666666
8015868,3,B0001OM6IE,Intervals for Men. Not as good as some of the other videos. Didn't really enjoy it. First part (warmup/cardio) is repetitively boring.,1426118400,,134,5.136363636363637
8015869,5,B0001OM6IE,"The video is exactly what I needed, to help me get the body I want an to stay in shape.",1397520000,,87,3.4
8015870,5,B0001OM6IE,"Interval Training for Men is what you will find upon the start of this DVD. But you know what? I like a challenge and I love Gilad so this woman is gonna 'do the damn thing'. I'm a little out of shape so it will take me a minute to work up to getting through the whole thing but not bad for my 1st time do get past the warm-up, part 1 and 2 circuits of part 2 before quitting. I love his sequences, they are easy to follow and systematic which works for me.",1367452800,,457,3.8210526315789473
