4096291,5,B0039A9MCK,"Is Kenneth Anger a masterful filmmaker? No. But he is fearless. If you are really interested in film, this set is worth the purchase price. Don't expect narrative, don't expect cohesion or color correction or good sound editing or timeless themes. But what you can expect is to see some of the raw material of genius and ideas which continue to inspire other filmmakers. If you primarily like romantic comedies and family friendly films, stay away. But if you can devote yourself to a Godard marathon, then dive into this.

And besides all that high-falutin' stuff, this collection is a trip to watch over an evening or two. I didn't know quite what to expect, but I sure as hell had not ever seen anything quite like ""Invocation of My Demon Brother.""

I purchased the entire set because I had been searching for a long time for some way to see ""Scorpio Rising,"" a film I had a vague memory of seeing when in high school. A friend mentioned it one day and it turned into a mission to get my hands on a DVD or a video file or even a 16mm print. Fortunately, this collection popped up on Amazon and I had the pleasure of not only revisiting ""Scorpio Rising"" (my memories of it were completely incorrect) but discovering Anger's wild oeuvre.

Well worth it.",1366761600,13,1254,4.515418502202643

From short shorts like ""Puce Moment"" to single-subject meditations like ""Eau d'Artifice,"" to longer mystical works like ""Lucifer Rising"" and ""Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome,"" this is great stuff. I love Anger's mix of lush hedonism, the occult, and camp humor. LOVE IT!",1354406400,,393,5.15625
4096294,5,B0039A9MCK,"This collection would receive 5 stars from me for ""Fireworks"" (1947) and the shortened version of ""Rabbit's Moon"" (1979) alone. Throw in the other eight titles and you have a hit on your hands. It makes for excellent ""background"" visuals projected onto a wall or screen at a party, your favorite local tapas establishment, or similar gatherings (soundtrack optional). For close study I recommend one watch the films in their entirety with Anger's commentary ""off"" the first time though, then watch all of it a second time, Anger ""on"". (nb: the musical accompaniment to the 1979 version of ""Rabbit's Moon"" is a number titled ""It Came In The Night"", released in 1979 by an English (as I recall) band who called themselves A Raincoat.)",1332201600,11,732,4.911290322580645
4096295,3,B0039A9MCK,"It was good to see the films on this DVD set.  I had seen Scorpio Rising when I was in college 40 years ago, but had not been able to see the other films until I purchased this collection.  Kenneth Anger appeared recently at the newly opened IU Cinema.  Although he never made a feature-length film, he has influenced many directors over the years because of his willlingness to experiment with different subjects and techniques.",1301443200,9,429,4.693333333333333
4096296,4,B0039A9MCK,"I have to admit that I hadn't seen ANY of Kenneth Anger's films prior to acquiring this set, but like most, I was aware of him mostly due to his two ""Hollywood Babylon"" books, his admiration of noted occultists Aleister Crowley and Anton LaVey, mentions by/influence on some of my favorite directors, like Scorsese and Lynch, and Jimmy Page's score for ""Lucifer Rising"" (which went unused).  So I popped for this set, on faith that I would see something interesting & influential, and I wasn't disappointed (I think this 2DVD set is a repackage/remaster of the two separate volumes I've seen for sale, all in one set now).

This is a two disc set that compiles ten (10) of Anger's better known films (though others are not here), along with a newer work.  The films are:

Fireworks (1947)
Puce Moment (1949)
Rabbit's Moon (1950 - orig version)
Eaux d'artifice (1953)
Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954)
Scorpio Rising (1964)
Kustom Kar Kommandos (1965)
Invocation of My Demon Brother (1969)
Rabbit's Moon (1979 - shorter version of 1950 film)
Lucifer Rising (1981) - does NOT have any of Jimmy Page's score (Anger mentions that Pagey did 20 min of music but it's never been used, at least not here)
And
""The Man We Want to Hang"" - 2002, which is about the art of Aleister Crowley (including many pieces now owned by Jimmy Page)

The films range from around 3 minutes to 30 minutes, and explore images and themes of homoeroticism, the occult, cars, mythology, surrealism, and the like.  One can see why these films were so influential - great use of music (the popular period tunes used one after another in Scorpio Rising, for example, were clearly influential on someone like Scorsese, particularly in use of ironic/interesting song choices), composition of shots, cutaways to stock/similar metaphor footage, odd angles (probably influencing Lynch a great deal c.f. Eraserhead), and I noticed that some of the shots in a film like Eaux d'artifice seemed to be very stylistically similar to images that appeared later in European art films I've seen (everything from ""Pink Floyd at Pompeii""'s ancient art & bubbling mud pools, to ""More"", ""La vallee"", etc - I think some 60's and 70's European directors were probably very influenced by his techniques).  Restorations on these are quite good, given his equipment limitations (Fireworks was not lit well but still looks pretty good, and something like Rabbit's Moon which was shot in a studio and properly lit, looks great) and generally, everything here looks good.  Overall, I was pretty happy with the image quality, and I watched it on an 8 foot screen via a projection system and it blew up well.  I'd suggest, since there is basically just music accompanying the images, that you view the films with the commentary `on' because it's very insightful to hear Anger himself tell you what some things sympbolize/what he was trying to convey plus insight into the filming of each - Anger is a pretty unique filmmaker, and came from a more expressive/arty time, and I'm not sure that a younger audience would immediately `get' the experimental nature/subtlety/avant-garde-ness of this type of work (given today's beat-an-audience-over-the-head bombast in mainstream films).  The accompanying booklet has excellent essays by Scorsese, Gus Van Sant, and others, plus production information (and I need to track down the song he used in the short version of ""Rabbit"" - it's killer)

Overall, four stars for a `normal' audience, but five stars & pretty essential viewing for anyone who is interested in seeing the work of an influential/interesting filmmaker, whether you're an aspiring filmmaker or just a heavy-fan of film.",1275868800,42,3674,5.016420361247947

8392021,4,B0039A9MCK,"I bought this DVD because Im interested in experimental films that contain fantastic/surreal imagery, and Id read that Angers films fit that category. Most of the ones on this disc certainly do.

Anger is perhaps best known for his homoerotic films, which I gather he was one of the first to make or at least to get into relatively wide circulation. Three of the films in this collection, two very short ones (Fireworks and Kustom Kar Kommandos) and one longer one (Scorpio Rising), fit that description (I don't recall any actual sex, but there is male nudity). Two of the three feature hunky young guys and their hunky cars and motorcycles, with which they have a clear quasi-sexual relationship (Anger carefully explains in his commentary for Scorpio Rising that the men did have girlfriends, they just didn't want them on camera; true, maybe, but its obvious where their real affection lies). Overall, this aspect of Angers work is not my cup of tea, so I cant really judge it. I will say, though, that I think his idea of having the man in Kustom Kar Kommandos caress his beautiful car with a giant powder puff was brilliant.

I was more interested in the other main theme of these films, occultism based on the doctrines of Alastair Crowley, which lies on the borderline between standard paganism and Satanism (Anton LaVey makes a brief appearance in one film). I don't know Crowleys ideas in detail, but Im interested in this kind of mythology and imagery and was curious to see what Anger did with it. Im still not really sure what he was trying to do with it, but he certainly produced some arresting images in the process. They mix characters from ancient Greek (in Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome) and ancient Egyptian (in Lucifer Rising) mythologies with Christian ones in a thought-provoking, if often puzzling, blend.

If anything, I think Angers eye for imagery and mood shows best in two films that don't fit either of the above categories, Eaux dartifice and Rabbits Moon. Both are tinted completely in blue to suggest night scenes. The woman in Marie-Antoinette-style costume running through the gardens and fountains of the Villa dEste in Tivoli (a midget, Anger explains, chosen to make the fountains look taller) is quite haunting, though I wish there had been more of a story with her. For Rabbits Moon, a tale with commedia dellarte characters (Pierrot, Columbine, Harlequin) with a little Japanese mythology (the rabbit in the moon) rather incongruously thrown in, focus on the 1979 version, in which Anger has removed the excess repetition that (to my eye) marred his original 1950 version and also improved the moon images. (The later film is clearly an altered version of the earlier one, featuring the same actors and set.) Its really beautiful.

In my first pass through the disc, I played the films with Angers commentary turned on. The commentary does give some interesting information about events during the filming, the background of some of the actors, etc. However, I plan to watch at least my favorites again with the commentary off. (Ive so far done that only for Lucifer Rising.) That allows the music and imagery to come to the fore and play around in the mind without distractions, which they richly deserve to do.",1467072000,11,3257,4.863063063063063
