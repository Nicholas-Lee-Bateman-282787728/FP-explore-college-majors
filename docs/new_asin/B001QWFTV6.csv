8336668,4,B001QWFTV6,"Wonderful video of HH Dalai Lama's talk at St. John the Divine in NYC in 1997. Despite the fact that this was over 15 yrs ago, the message is timeless. He talks of the value and need of diversity in our culture. The Dalai Lama used metaphors that really hit home: a garden being more beautiful when it has many types of flowers and a restaurant being more successful when it has many dishes to choose from rather than only one dish.

He also points out that our society needs to encourage positive qualities of compassion for all; we can't just blame our political leaders because our leaders come from the society. If we as a society are not compassionate & wise, how can we expect to foster leaders who are. As always, the Dalai Lama give wise and stern lessons with love and humor...we need to pay attention to his message.

Definitely worth watching. Only negative comment is that sometimes the audio wasn't great and wish there was option for audio subtitles.",1347494400,,964,4.566473988439307
