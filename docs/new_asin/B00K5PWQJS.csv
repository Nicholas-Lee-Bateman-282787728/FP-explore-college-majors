8656047,4,B00K5PWQJS,We have always liked Walter Pidgeon's and Claudette Colbert's movies.  This was the first time we have seen the two of them together in a movie.  We liked them together and we enjoyed the movie.,1435708800,2,194,4.514285714285714
8656048,5,B00K5PWQJS,"Scary, for its time.  Allyson in a different sort of role.  And because I have watched Forbidden Planet a thousand times, a good example of Walter Pigeon's ""other excellent work.""  That voice.  Why didn't my mom and dad fix my vocal chords to sound like his?",1433808000,4,258,4.543478260869565

8656050,5,B00K5PWQJS,"Another gloriously glaring exception to the perpetually vague (not as in nouvelle) ""auteur theory,"" ""The Secret Heart"" is an unearthed gem of thoughtful production, fine performances all around, and some pretty damned creepy stuff going on in June Allyson's noodle. A glossy ""meller"" to be sure, but a highly intelligent one, giving all its characters a fair shake, even the nutsoid ivory tickling booze pilot who causes all the trouble in the first place. Wish I could be there to see ya'll discover this one.  hfs",1407369600,5,515,4.988372093023256
