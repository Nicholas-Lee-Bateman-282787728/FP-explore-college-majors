Strangely, this reincarnation of the recording has a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack whereas the packaged set offers only PCM stereo. Although on blu-ray, the performance is not in HD, it has been (re)formatted with an aspect ration of 16:9.

Harnoncourt offers a bracing, sharply etched performance hampered only by the sluggish and imprecise Pizarro of Alfred Muff. The other principals are nothing short of terrific and even Muff, through all his bluster, manages to convey enough of the villainy of Pizarro to invite a certain tolerance for his obvious weaknesses. This is my first encounter with Camilla Nylund, whose Leonore is both visually and vocally impactful. Kaufmann is Kaufmann, the lyric-almost-helden-tenor of our age.",1463097600,10,1170,6.786666666666667
