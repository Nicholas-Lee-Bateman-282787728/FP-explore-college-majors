3079607,1,B00127RAFS,"This was when the show transformed from excellent comedy to a silly cartoon.....GONE was the edge from earlier seasons.....GONE was nastiness and vulgarity from earlier seasons...The show started to decline big time in season 7 and season 8 is only worse...The following seasons are unwatchable....The show's best seasons (1-4) it was a sharp edged nasty groundbreaking sitcom....At this stage it become a goofy silly slapstick embarrassment..One of the shows creators (Ron Leavitt) left after season 6 and he is SORELY MISSED.....No Maam was stupid...Could have been priceless having Al and a bunch of his loser friends together but instead it turns into a goof fest...Al Bundy basically turned into a live action Homer Simpson....So if you like silly, goofy, slapstick then this season is for you....If you prefer the edginess then check out seasons 1 thru 5.....PERFECT EXAMPLE of how a once great show can decline if it stays on the air too long",1201651200,9,949,5.1688311688311686
3079608,5,B00127RAFS,"Season 8 will finally arrive in all its glory on March 18th I believe.  I still can't understand why this show has taken so long to be put out on dvd.

They intend to perform television's first sexorcism which includes them forcing him in watching hours of pro-wrestling.

25: Al Goes Deep
26: Kelly Knows Something

What a great list of episodes...Season 8 was very funny and proved once again that The Bundy's were the craziest, coolest, & hippest family around!!  Enjoy!",1200528000,21,3039,4.435483870967742
3079609,5,B00127RAFS,"The eighth hilarious season of Fox's MARRIED...WITH CHILDREN introduces viewers to the all-male No Ma'am Club founded by Al Bundy(Ed O'Neill) and Jefferson D'Arcy(Happy Days alum Ted McGinley). The club members are either bachelors or husbands who are disgusted by their wives' demeanors/lifestyles. Afterall,Al doesn't often enjoy the company of his 22-year wife Peggy(Katey Sagal). In Jefferson's case,he's still madly in love with his wife,the former Marcy Rhoades(Amanda Bearse). I'm assuming that Jefferson co-founded the club primarily to give Al moral support. At every meeting,the members wear white T-shirts bearing the No Ma'am logo,which consists of the female symbol,encircled with a diagonal line over the symbol. But sometimes,Jefferson would enjoy the absence of his wife,but not as much as Al! Kelly(Christina Applegate),daughter of Al and Peggy,is still working as a roller-skating waitress which she began doing last season. Kelly's 19-year-old brother Bud(David Faustino),after a brief course in driving school instruction(degree required),takes a job at the DMV(Division of Motor Vehicles) as an instructor. I'll state for the record that Bud received his driver's license during season 5. I'm sure with Bud as an instructor,no one fails a driver's test! Jefferson still works as a waiter at a topless bar,which he began doing last season. As for the opening montage,there's still an instrumental theme similar to the late Frank Sinatra's 1955 hit recording LOVE & MARRIAGE. Reportedly,Sinatra's beneficiaries still refuse to let Sony Pictures continue using L&M. Many reviewers have commented on this,saying Sinatra's family is greedy which I don't believe is true. Possibly,the families of L&M's writers,Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen,are forbidding the continued use of the song. Well,the families refuse for their own reasons. The similarity is heard in the closing montage also. I guess we can say that the Bundys were still Kings of the Fox network during 1993-94. The animated SIMPSONS drew high ratings in its fifth season then also.",1200441600,7,2062,5.5910543130990416

Married With Children is one of my all time favorite shows.  I was upset when it was removed from Netflix and haven't seen it in a couple years.  Now I see seasons on Amazon running from 6 to 8 dollars.  Just bought seasons 8-11 for under 30 bucks, not quite the free offer Netflix had, but still a great deal, and the original Frank Sinatra music is included in the openings.

All of the dogs ""talk"" to each other. Very funny! Two other memorable episodes are ""Assault and Batteries,"" where Al's plan to watch the John Wayne movie ""Hondo"" after he returns from buying batteries, of course goes awry. Another personal favorite is ""How Green Was My Apple,"" with the Bundys and the Darcys going to war over a property dispute.

3079754,4,B00127RAFS,"What is up with the introduction music? This is the first season I bought on dvd because I love this show and I remember watching it while growing up. Don't ask as to why I bought season 8 as my first Married With Children dvd set but I was really turned off with that absolutely crappy theme music. What happened to Sinatra's song? That song fit perfectley into the introduction, when I heard this, I was repulsed, I said to myself ""What the hell is this?"". I mean its not a deal breaker because the show is hilarious probably one of the greatest sitcoms ever but what happened to the original theme and introduction? Is it like that on all the seasons? You have to understand, growing up while this show was running I associated that song with Married With Children, it literally defined the premise of the show and not hearing it in the introduction is a crime. if anyone knows, please let me know, I'm curious. Did it have something to do with copyright laws?",1235433600,,963,4.446327683615819
3079755,4,B00127RAFS,"Seasons 1 through 6 were totally classic and on point. Nothing will every compare to the earlier seasons. With any show, you can pretty much expect it to decline with time. However, season seven was a big disappointment for me. It really lacked originality and the fun factor seemed to be lost in every episode. But, season eight semi-redeems itself. I actually found season eight to be funnier than season seven. Of course the magic of the earlier seasons is completely gone, but this show is a classic nonetheless. Add this to your collection & i cant wait for the final 11th season to debut on DVD.",1234137600,,601,4.626168224299065
3079796,5,B00127RAFS,"Season 8 continues the antics of the Bundy's with more flavor.  I enjoy Season 8 as I have enjoyed seasons 1 through 7.  Season 8 is when Jefferson shows his true colors, as kept husband.  The contrast between Jefferson and Steve is ironic and funny.  I enjoy watching Kelly and Bud's character's grow and become increasingly disfunctional.  Overall the show is great.  Watch it to laught.  If you are trying to find meaning this may not be the best choice!",1226620800,,457,4.6375

3079798,5,B00127RAFS,"Season eight isn't one of my favorite seasons but it's close.  I think my favorite episode in season eight is episode 166 No Maam because women take over the nudie bar and the bowling alley, Al's favorite hangouts, so he starts the organization NO MAAM.  There are actually quite a few good episodes like episode 158 A Tisket, a Tasket, Can Peg Make a Basket? and episode 163 No Chicken, No Check where Kelly and Bud buy a car and share it.  If you are like me, a big Al Bundy fan, then season eight is a must have for your Married With Children collection.

3079800,4,B00127RAFS,"I'm an MWC fanatic and I absolutely love the first 7 seasons but this season is when things start to get bad - with the introduction of No Ma'am and all those other weird storylines (Jefferson being a spy, Grim Reaper comes over.)

The only 5 good episodes here are 1) St. Valentine's Day Massacre (Kelly forgets to give Bud a valentine from a girl and he goes to her hotel to try to get some.  2) Proud to Be Your Bud (Bud goes nuts and his cool alter-ego tries to take over his body) 3) No Chicken, No Check (the kids buy a car and have to share) 4) Ride Scare (Al carpools with 3 fat chicks) 5) Kelly Knows something (Kelly goes on a sports gameshow but every fact she learns replaces something else in her brain. )

The St. Valentine's Day episode may be worth the price of this season alone.  Bud: ""You have 5 seconds to announce me. "" Sasquatch: ""It's Buuuud Bundy! """,1212969600,2,873,4.178571428571429

3079803,5,B00127RAFS,"I'm one of the many individuals who absolutely believe that ""Married...with Children"" is one of the finest sitcoms ever to be televised. Sure the humor is almost always crude, but that's what makes it so good. The Bundys are absolutely hilarious. Al's shattered dreams and Peggy's stupendous carelessness are the highlights for almost every episode. Kelly's low intelligence and Bud's failed love life completes the dysfunctional family. And let's not forget their neighbors: the chicken-legged Marcy, and the charming but unemployed Jefferson, and (from the earlier seasons) the one-and-only Steve.

3079805,3,B00127RAFS,"I love ""Married With Children"" and recently bought seasons 5-8. This season is good, but not as good as previous ones.

On the other hand you do have the first episode with NO MAAM which is a big plus...",1209340800,2,378,4.573529411764706
3079846,4,B00127RAFS,"I remember thinking how badly the show had slipped by this point and don't remember watching too many of the episodes from season 8 when it was on the air.  I always felt that Steve was better than Jefferson and the show suffered once David Garrison left.  However, I bought this anyway in an effort to add to my collection.  It was funnier than I remembered.  While I still think Steve was better, this season did contain my all time favorite Jefferson episode where he was intimated as an ex-spy.

Also the sports bar episode with the Jeffersons tour was a hoot with Marcy wanting to make out with Kelly in a Jefferson disguise as the guys sneak out to the sports bar.

I didn't like the original bunch of NO MA'AM'ers.  I'm glad E.E Bell remained and they built Griff and the other guy as the regulars after this.

Ed O'Neill was simply fantastic as Al as always.  I thought the casting for the show was terrific.",1209340800,,916,4.404761904761905

3079849,5,B00127RAFS,"People are complaining that this season is getting cartoonish.. Is that supposed to be a bad thing?? This show was never meant to be Shakespeare. If this show had to evolve and change, it's at least in an entertaining way. This season we have No Ma'am, more episodes of Psycho Dad, more trips to the nudie bar, Big 'Uns magazine, more 'chicken' jabs at Marcy, and Al even gets to re-live football glory filling in (secretly) for an injured college player. I think the cartoonishness, including the falling stunt dummies, is hilarious. Some highlights include when Al carpools with fat women, the Village People show up and sing YMCA and get mugged by killer housewives, Al gets circumcised by accident, Kelly's boyfriend burns Peg's couch, Al has a chance at a free Dodge Viper, and Kelly's job as The Verminator results in Bud growing boobs. Yes, the plots are definitely getting more insane and cartoonish, but so what? How boring would No Ma'am be if all they did is sit around Al's house? If you want a tame, grounded-in-reality show, when has Married With Children ever been the answer? That's the direction the show was headed in anyway, and it makes it all the more entertaining. Al Bundy's facial expressions, lessons of wisdom, and ""a fat woman Godzilla'd into the shoe store"" stories are absolutely priceless. You can't listen to his lines and not laugh, such as ""so when a fat woman thunders in, a pie wedged under each chin, I'm not supposed to ask if that's the star spangled banner she's belching, so I know whether to stand up or sit down?"" That was when he was protesting political correctness.
In the next few seasons, Al will settle on Griff as a second sidekick and co-worker at the shoe store, No Ma'am will be in for more adventures, and Al & Marcy will continue to tangle. Here's hoping there's another release in 2008.",1207008000,6,1841,4.685185185185185
3079850,3,B00127RAFS,"Married with Children is a great show overall. The very best episodes, I would have to say are the early ones with Steve (Seasons 1-3). Ed O'Neill (Al) and David Garrison (Steve) had great interaction and played well off one and another. Build A Better Mousetrap, and Her Cups Runneth Over, for example, are two of my all time favorite episodes. That being said, each season had their share of shining episodes including this one. No Ma'am, How green was my apple...etc. Enough about the show itself, What I am most disappointed in is the quality of the release. There are no special features other than some ""Minisodes"" of Silver Spoons and V.I.P. -- How they are related to Married With Children? I don't know. There is no commentary (I myself don't listen to the commentary, but some people do none the less), Heck in this release they cut down the packaging also! No booklet with the seasons' episode listing in it, just two slimline dvd cases. One case with two dvd's in it, and the other with the third disk in it. All in all you would get similar quality to recording re-runs on your DVD recorder (If you've got this, you've pretty much got what's here), and printing an episode guide from Tv.com. All that being said, I'm glad for the simple fact that it is being released. That's more than can be said for alot of other shows I.E. Night Court...

3079853,4,B00127RAFS,"Follow the wild misadventures of America's most outrageous family in ""Married... with Children: The Complete Eighth Season"". ""Married... with Children"" is the long-running FOX sitcom that changed our view of the typical family comedy. The comedy series follows the lives of luckless shoe salesman Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), his dysfunctional family and his bothersome next-door neighbors. In this season, Al starts an organization called NO MA'AM (National Organization of Men against Amazonian Masterhood) to protest against women taking over his favorite hangouts. Peggy (Katey Segal) is chosen for a $10,000 free throw contest in an all-star basketball game. Bud (David Faustino) finds a long-lost Valentine's card and goes on a desperate mission to find his lost love. Kelly (Christina Applegate) accidentally destroys her mother's favorite couch. An argument over an apple tree leads to a terrible no-holds-barred feud between the Bundy's and the Darcy's (Amanda Bearse & Ted McGinley). The eighth season of ""Married... with Children"" features some very funny moments and special appearances by Jerry Springer, Gary Coleman, Danny Bonaduce, Stacy Ferguson, Joe Namath and the Village People.

If you already have purchased the previous DVD releases of the long-running comedy series then feel free to check out ""Married... with Children: The Complete Eighth Season"". All 26 episodes are presented in their original full screen format. The 3-disc set contains a decent picture quality that is somewhat better than your average television rebroadcast. Its 2.0 Dolby Digital sound isn't outstanding but still acceptable. The 3-disc set includes two 3-minute mini-episodes of ""V.I.P."" and ""Silver Spoons"" and previews of other upcoming DVD releases. Overall, ""Married... with Children: The Complete Eighth Season"" offers the same weak extras and simple video/audio quality of previous box sets and receives a ""B-"".",1205798400,3,1911,5.635416666666667
3079854,3,B00127RAFS,"Married With Children's 8th Season was okay, but I don't think this 1993-94 Season of Married With Children was as good or as sophisticated nor as hilarious as most of the other seasons throughout Married With Children's 10-year run on FOX.

I especially don't think that Married With Children's Eighth Season was as good as the last 3 seasons of that show, plus I don't think the 8th Season was as good as the 3rd Season, 4th Season, 5th Season, 6th Season, or 7th Season either, although I loved the episode when the doofus Kelly Bundy(Christina Applegate) plays on a sports game show for Al and almost wins, which was an episode from the 1993-94 Season, but now I can hardly wait till they finally put Married With Children's 9th Season on DVD, especially since the 1994-95 Season is a lot better than the 1993-94 Season is.",1202860800,4,827,4.625850340136054
3079855,5,B00127RAFS,"Like fine wine, the Bundy's got better with time (Ok, Ok  the episodes with Seven in Season 7 were the exception).

Season 8 introduces ""No Ma'am"", the pose (you know - 4 touchdowns in a single game), and further character development past the Bundy and D'Arcy households.  The Bundy's Dodge is featured in two episodes (Al needs a part and the 1,000,000 miles).  Then there are more scenes at the shoe store. And finally, Al's football past is revisited.

What I like about this season is that the variety of Season 8 helps us understand - and lends background - to how the Bundy's became America's most laughed at and beloved (or reviled) family.

But if there is one episode of Season 8 that stands out, it is the ""Luck of the Bundy's"".  Only people who are so used to suffering misfortune (like Al), and then see their luck turn around dramatically, can feel the gripping fear of sudden good fortune.  Ed O'Neill's character plays this episode to the hilt.

What a season!!!",1202774400,8,978,4.606936416184971

3314105,5,B00127RAFS,"Season 8 will finally arrive in all its glory on March 18th I believe.  I still can't understand why this show has taken so long to be put out on dvd.

They intend to perform television's first sexorcism which includes them forcing him in watching hours of pro-wrestling.

25: Al Goes Deep
26: Kelly Knows Something

What a great list of episodes...Season 8 was very funny and proved once again that The Bundy's were the craziest, coolest, & hippest family around!!  Enjoy!",1200528000,21,3039,4.435483870967742
3314106,5,B00127RAFS,"The eighth hilarious season of Fox's MARRIED...WITH CHILDREN introduces viewers to the all-male No Ma'am Club founded by Al Bundy(Ed O'Neill) and Jefferson D'Arcy(Happy Days alum Ted McGinley). The club members are either bachelors or husbands who are disgusted by their wives' demeanors/lifestyles. Afterall,Al doesn't often enjoy the company of his 22-year wife Peggy(Katey Sagal). In Jefferson's case,he's still madly in love with his wife,the former Marcy Rhoades(Amanda Bearse). I'm assuming that Jefferson co-founded the club primarily to give Al moral support. At every meeting,the members wear white T-shirts bearing the No Ma'am logo,which consists of the female symbol,encircled with a diagonal line over the symbol. But sometimes,Jefferson would enjoy the absence of his wife,but not as much as Al! Kelly(Christina Applegate),daughter of Al and Peggy,is still working as a roller-skating waitress which she began doing last season. Kelly's 19-year-old brother Bud(David Faustino),after a brief course in driving school instruction(degree required),takes a job at the DMV(Division of Motor Vehicles) as an instructor. I'll state for the record that Bud received his driver's license during season 5. I'm sure with Bud as an instructor,no one fails a driver's test! Jefferson still works as a waiter at a topless bar,which he began doing last season. As for the opening montage,there's still an instrumental theme similar to the late Frank Sinatra's 1955 hit recording LOVE & MARRIAGE. Reportedly,Sinatra's beneficiaries still refuse to let Sony Pictures continue using L&M. Many reviewers have commented on this,saying Sinatra's family is greedy which I don't believe is true. Possibly,the families of L&M's writers,Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen,are forbidding the continued use of the song. Well,the families refuse for their own reasons. The similarity is heard in the closing montage also. I guess we can say that the Bundys were still Kings of the Fox network during 1993-94. The animated SIMPSONS drew high ratings in its fifth season then also.",1200441600,7,2062,5.5910543130990416

That song fit perfectley into the introduction, when I heard this, I was repulsed, I said to myself ""What the hell is this?"". I mean its not a deal breaker because the show is hilarious probably one of the greatest sitcoms ever but what happened to the original theme and introduction? Is it like that on all the seasons? You have to understand, growing up while this show was running I associated that song with Married With Children, it literally defined the premise of the show and not hearing it in the introduction is a crime. if anyone knows, please let me know, I'm curious.

However, season seven was a big disappointment for me. It really lacked originality and the fun factor seemed to be lost in every episode. But, season eight semi-redeems itself. I actually found season eight to be funnier than season seven. Of course the magic of the earlier seasons is completely gone, but this show is a classic nonetheless.

There are actually quite a few good episodes like episode 158 A Tisket, a Tasket, Can Peg Make a Basket? and episode 163 No Chicken, No Check where Kelly and Bud buy a car and share it.

It was funnier than I remembered.  While I still think Steve was better, this season did contain my all time favorite Jefferson episode where he was intimated as an ex-spy.

Also the sports bar episode with the Jeffersons tour was a hoot with Marcy wanting to make out with Kelly in a Jefferson disguise as the guys sneak out to the sports bar.

I didn't like the original bunch of NO MA'AM'ers.  I'm glad E.E Bell remained and they built Griff and the other guy as the regulars after this.

3314346,5,B00127RAFS,"People are complaining that this season is getting cartoonish.. Is that supposed to be a bad thing?? This show was never meant to be Shakespeare. If this show had to evolve and change, it's at least in an entertaining way. This season we have No Ma'am, more episodes of Psycho Dad, more trips to the nudie bar, Big 'Uns magazine, more 'chicken' jabs at Marcy, and Al even gets to re-live football glory filling in (secretly) for an injured college player. I think the cartoonishness, including the falling stunt dummies, is hilarious. Some highlights include when Al carpools with fat women, the Village People show up and sing YMCA and get mugged by killer housewives, Al gets circumcised by accident, Kelly's boyfriend burns Peg's couch, Al has a chance at a free Dodge Viper, and Kelly's job as The Verminator results in Bud growing boobs. Yes, the plots are definitely getting more insane and cartoonish, but so what? How boring would No Ma'am be if all they did is sit around Al's house? If you want a tame, grounded-in-reality show, when has Married With Children ever been the answer? That's the direction the show was headed in anyway, and it makes it all the more entertaining. Al Bundy's facial expressions, lessons of wisdom, and ""a fat woman Godzilla'd into the shoe store"" stories are absolutely priceless. You can't listen to his lines and not laugh, such as ""so when a fat woman thunders in, a pie wedged under each chin, I'm not supposed to ask if that's the star spangled banner she's belching, so I know whether to stand up or sit down?"" That was when he was protesting political correctness.
In the next few seasons, Al will settle on Griff as a second sidekick and co-worker at the shoe store, No Ma'am will be in for more adventures, and Al & Marcy will continue to tangle. Here's hoping there's another release in 2008.",1207008000,6,1841,4.685185185185185
3314347,3,B00127RAFS,"Married with Children is a great show overall. The very best episodes, I would have to say are the early ones with Steve (Seasons 1-3). Ed O'Neill (Al) and David Garrison (Steve) had great interaction and played well off one and another. Build A Better Mousetrap, and Her Cups Runneth Over, for example, are two of my all time favorite episodes. That being said, each season had their share of shining episodes including this one. No Ma'am, How green was my apple...etc. Enough about the show itself, What I am most disappointed in is the quality of the release. There are no special features other than some ""Minisodes"" of Silver Spoons and V.I.P. -- How they are related to Married With Children? I don't know. There is no commentary (I myself don't listen to the commentary, but some people do none the less), Heck in this release they cut down the packaging also! No booklet with the seasons' episode listing in it, just two slimline dvd cases. One case with two dvd's in it, and the other with the third disk in it. All in all you would get similar quality to recording re-runs on your DVD recorder (If you've got this, you've pretty much got what's here), and printing an episode guide from Tv.com. All that being said, I'm glad for the simple fact that it is being released. That's more than can be said for alot of other shows I.E. Night Court... Where's season 2 and beyond? and others of course. Just my 2 cents here.",1206144000,,1427,4.534883720930233
3314348,5,B00127RAFS,"I don't really like writing reviews so I'll keep this short and sweet. I feel MWC is the greatest show ever and this is another great season, it's ridiculous that all 11 seasons aren't already out on dvd while plenty of shows are already done and we even have seasons 10 of south park and the simpsons which aren't even over yet. Anyways buy this now it's worth every penny.",1206057600,3,374,4.357142857142857

3314350,4,B00127RAFS,"Follow the wild misadventures of America's most outrageous family in ""Married... with Children: The Complete Eighth Season"". ""Married... with Children"" is the long-running FOX sitcom that changed our view of the typical family comedy. The comedy series follows the lives of luckless shoe salesman Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), his dysfunctional family and his bothersome next-door neighbors. In this season, Al starts an organization called NO MA'AM (National Organization of Men against Amazonian Masterhood) to protest against women taking over his favorite hangouts. Peggy (Katey Segal) is chosen for a $10,000 free throw contest in an all-star basketball game. Bud (David Faustino) finds a long-lost Valentine's card and goes on a desperate mission to find his lost love. Kelly (Christina Applegate) accidentally destroys her mother's favorite couch. An argument over an apple tree leads to a terrible no-holds-barred feud between the Bundy's and the Darcy's (Amanda Bearse & Ted McGinley). The eighth season of ""Married... with Children"" features some very funny moments and special appearances by Jerry Springer, Gary Coleman, Danny Bonaduce, Stacy Ferguson, Joe Namath and the Village People.

If you already have purchased the previous DVD releases of the long-running comedy series then feel free to check out ""Married... with Children: The Complete Eighth Season"". All 26 episodes are presented in their original full screen format. The 3-disc set contains a decent picture quality that is somewhat better than your average television rebroadcast. Its 2.0 Dolby Digital sound isn't outstanding but still acceptable. The 3-disc set includes two 3-minute mini-episodes of ""V.I.P."" and ""Silver Spoons"" and previews of other upcoming DVD releases. Overall, ""Married... with Children: The Complete Eighth Season"" offers the same weak extras and simple video/audio quality of previous box sets and receives a ""B-"".",1205798400,3,1911,5.635416666666667
3314351,3,B00127RAFS,"Married With Children's 8th Season was okay, but I don't think this 1993-94 Season of Married With Children was as good or as sophisticated nor as hilarious as most of the other seasons throughout Married With Children's 10-year run on FOX.

I especially don't think that Married With Children's Eighth Season was as good as the last 3 seasons of that show, plus I don't think the 8th Season was as good as the 3rd Season, 4th Season, 5th Season, 6th Season, or 7th Season either, although I loved the episode when the doofus Kelly Bundy(Christina Applegate) plays on a sports game show for Al and almost wins, which was an episode from the 1993-94 Season, but now I can hardly wait till they finally put Married With Children's 9th Season on DVD, especially since the 1994-95 Season is a lot better than the 1993-94 Season is.",1202860800,4,827,4.625850340136054
3314352,5,B00127RAFS,"Like fine wine, the Bundy's got better with time (Ok, Ok  the episodes with Seven in Season 7 were the exception).

Season 8 introduces ""No Ma'am"", the pose (you know - 4 touchdowns in a single game), and further character development past the Bundy and D'Arcy households.  The Bundy's Dodge is featured in two episodes (Al needs a part and the 1,000,000 miles).  Then there are more scenes at the shoe store. And finally, Al's football past is revisited.

What I like about this season is that the variety of Season 8 helps us understand - and lends background - to how the Bundy's became America's most laughed at and beloved (or reviled) family.

But if there is one episode of Season 8 that stands out, it is the ""Luck of the Bundy's"".  Only people who are so used to suffering misfortune (like Al), and then see their luck turn around dramatically, can feel the gripping fear of sudden good fortune.  Ed O'Neill's character plays this episode to the hilt.

What a season!!!",1202774400,8,978,4.606936416184971
