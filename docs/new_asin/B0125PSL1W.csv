7342840,5,B0125PSL1W,"Best DVD of hers, been waiting for the last of her Killer series. And this is definitely better than I expected. Amazing!",1443052800,,121,4.545454545454546
7342841,5,B0125PSL1W,"Jillian is on her game in this one! There are some really creative moves that work a lot more than just arms and back. I also felt my quads, hamstrings, buns, abs...total body. Whew! Below is a breakdown of just the first 30 minute workout (there are two others) that consists of a warmup, four circuits, and stretching so you can see what I mean:

warmup 3min (jump rope; arm circles; back jacks; Matrix arm circles; diagonal cat cow; T arm swings); single arm rows; single arm burpees; pushups then rotating plank; swimming superman; repeat. Running ab hold moguls (forearm plank moguls); bridge lat pull to chest press; sit up chest fly triceps extension; Goddess squat and press; reverse fly in warrior III; repeat. Squat with wide row; static chair with flyes; squat thrust and plank jack; lying triceps press; static side lunge with a concentration curl; repeat. Three way curls (regular, hammer, reverse); reach and pull while pivoting; good morning with W press; tricep pulse; sumo squats with alternating anterior raises; repeat. Stretching.",1442793600,91,1050,5.0344827586206895
7342842,5,B0125PSL1W,"I've done level 1 and this is a great DVD so far. The workout is tough and creative, and I like that. Highly recommend it. My roommate and I are doing the one of each of the Killer series 2x a week each and we were pumped to add this in. Usual passionate, killer Jillian. I viewed levels 2 and 3 and they look brutal. Can't wait :)

Some have commented about the recording quality. I didn't notice any issues. The only thing that stood out was her background. There are these fuzzy glass panels that make the landscape behind it look blurry. But then the ladies are crystal clear standing in front of it. My eyes adjusted before the warm-up was done.

Lastly, I love the cover of the DVD. Can I say that? I know it's useless, but the pic and graphics look clean and fun.

Thanks Jillian for creating a workout that focuses on the upper body!",1442620800,4,841,4.24375
7342843,4,B0125PSL1W,This is one of Jillian's best work outs. I own every DVD she has come out with and she is back with one of the best. I've been a little disappointed in the past few that came out but this one is right up there with Shred It in 30 and No More Trouble Zones. The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the quality of the video. It is blurry and hard to see sometimes which is a little frustrating.,1442448000,25,403,3.8095238095238093
7342844,5,B0125PSL1W,"If this is truly Jillian's final DVD in the ""Killer Series"", then she has really outdone herself for a grand finale!  After finishing level one today, the DVD kept playing & went right into level 2, so I thought to myself what the heck, and did both workouts back to back; BIG mistake as I will be sore for days!!

I am a huge Jillian Michaels fan & I own every single one of her DVDs (except for her Body Revolution & Body Shred programs).  When I saw this DVD available for preorder, I had to get it for my collection, but I wasn't necessarily excited about these workouts because I honestly hate upper body workouts.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with these workouts because Jillian actually made these exercises fun!!

These workouts are actually total body workouts with an emphasis on the upper body (think squats with anterior raises, static lunge with bicep curls, static bridge pose with lat pulls, sit-ups with chest flyes, single leg tricep dips, etc.), so you will be working out your entire body & burning a great amount of calories.

I haven't tried level 3 yet, but so far I am extremely impressed with levels 1 & 2.  Jillian is the queen of circuit training & her workouts never gets boring.  This one is definitely a keeper & I can't wait to get my arms, chest & back toned.

I consider myself an intermediate level exerciser & I had to follow the modifications on some moves (never have & never will do a single arm burpee).  So, I wouldn't recommend this DVD for beginners (she has a great Beginner Shred DVD for newbies).

Also, I personally LOVE Jillian's personality, but I know she can come off strong for some people & I think I did hear her say the B word once in level 1 (although she was just referring to herself); I could've heard wrong though.

I definitely recommend this DVD & I think Jillian did a great job.  I hope Jillian will continue to create great DVDs!!!!",1442275200,28,1903,4.481159420289855
7342845,2,B0125PSL1W,"9/17 update. Received another DVD after asking for replacement. Again the recording is out of focus, blurred and gives you headache to watch it. At this point I'm going to ask for a refund. Nothing to have w/ JM she's awesome but I can't workout in front of a defected image knowing that I paid for it! Two stars not to be harsh, but I aspect the best from JM videos just like she's the best.
love JM workouts and I was so looking forward to this new DVD. The quality of this DVD is so very poor that at times you can't even see clearly JM and the girls face as is all blurred.  The one star is for poor recording quality. JM delivers as always a passionate and effective workout. Now, I wonder how can I get another DVD as I don't want to stick with an every day workout with a camera shot unlikely professional and zoomed out.",1442275200,7,828,4.142857142857143
7342846,5,B0125PSL1W,"As someone who owns pretty much every Jillian DVD I must say that this one was a surprise for me.  Two years ago I managed to tone my body and lose about 30 lbs through the magic of Jillian Michaels, but a broken foot and a second job forced me into submission and I am in pretty terrible shape.  I started up again with Jillian recently and decided to try this video out starting with workout 1 (thinking it would be an easy workout day)....crickets.  I was so so wrong!  This workout 1 was really difficult for me and included all sorts of new and novel moves.  I feel like I got quite the arm and even abdominal workout and am straight terrified to see what workout 2 has in store.  There are some really difficult moves one would just not expect in a level 1 like for instance One Armed Burpees!  That is just crazy town.  The workout is 4 circuits of pure arm toning hell in the best way possible and yes, I am sure that someone who works out for fun is going to come on here and say it was easy and they do it in addition to their 6 mile run, but those people are crazy (no offense...I wish I was that kind of crazy) and cannot be trusted to give workout advice to us common folk.  I really love this one and am glad that even given my intention of having an easy workout day, Jillian managed to slap me around and for that I say Thank You!!",1442275200,254,1347,4.071969696969697
7342847,3,B0125PSL1W,"This is probably my least favorite Jillian workout that I've done.  I was really hoping for more of a weights-based workout.  That said, it is a challenging workout.  I have a hard time with the warmup in Level 2...it slams you with cardio right from the offset, which is tough for me first thing in the morning.  Another issue I have with this workout is the pace.  I don't mind a quick pace, but she is often moving things along WAY too fast for me to change weights.  I'm using 3, 5, 8 and 10 lbs for this workout, and anytime I need to change weights, I need to rewind the video.  I did not find Level 1 to be very challenging, but now that I've tried the other two levels, I will be going back to it, and will perhaps be able to do more reps and larger weights.  Sometimes my initial impressions are not entirely accurate, because I'm spending more time learning the moves than doing reps.",1520467200,,894,4.2485207100591715
7342848,4,B0125PSL1W,Difficult but I am working up to it.  She explains the rationale behind each exercise and you really feel like you've accomplished something when you're done.  I have gone back to her beginner DVD but will work up to this.,1519171200,,222,4.525
7342849,4,B0125PSL1W,"Another great Jillian film. The workout is about 30 minutes and focuses specifically on your arms and back. She does mix in some moves that are more cardio based but she really strives to focus on the upper body. Level 1 is challenging but not impossible for someone to do that is a beginner. Jillian shows modifications to the moves so you can make it easier or harder. My only complaint is that the upper levels, Jillian tries to make it fun and hard but it just ends up being crazy. I find I lose my form and spend too much time trying to figure out what she is doing that it takes away from the effectiveness of the workout.",1518566400,4,628,4.241666666666666

7342852,4,B0125PSL1W,This is a great video that has some different moves so it isn't the same old thing.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it's a little too fast paced but if you have done Jilian videos you know she always keeps things moving.,1517184000,,222,4.045454545454546

I feel like I am working lots of muscles. However I do have a hard time for the first few times I do one of her work outs because she doesn't demonstrate the move before you start, you just kinda jump right in.",1513555200,,347,3.9014084507042255
7342856,2,B0125PSL1W,"This is a full-body cardio workout with a few arm moves - so if you're looking to build upper-body muscle mass (like I am), don't bother with this one

PROS

-Creative moves (though some are awkward)

-3 workouts, each with modifications to make the moves easier or harder

CONS

-Jillian moves WAY TOO FAST  - theres no way youll build muscle density

Youll either end up swinging heavier weights (bad form & risking injury) or using lighter weights (no muscle-building).
Plus each exercise is done for only a handful of reps so you never effectively work any muscle group.

If you need to switch weights, forget it!
It moves so fast that by the time you grab a new set, the exercise is complete and you have to pause & rewind. So annoying!

-Music is lame: very chaotic synthesizer

-Quality isn't great (Ive seen worse though)

-Maybe its just me, but I find Jillian annoying (so obnoxious and a tad full of herself). Also Jillian LOVES Ashley (whos performing the more intense versions) - she constantly comments on Ashleys perfect form, and refers to her as my girl Ashley and worse, Pumpkin (yok Pumpkin?) - ugh!",1511827200,,1118,4.653061224489796

7342858,4,B0125PSL1W,I've learned it to love Jillian Michaels workouts. She keeps you going well working every part of your body. This one was more challenging than some of her others. I had to go from using 8-pound weights down to 5 lb weights. I suggest having a set of light weights and one heavy weight because sometimes she tells you to hold both weights and one hand. Goodness knows with my small hands I can't do that.,1508630400,,404,4.328947368421052

7342873,3,B0125PSL1W,"Just received this and did it today. I guess it's just me but I was hoping for more exercises using weights. It's only really exercises towards the end using weights that  I really liked. When working arms and back I am a weights person, not being on the floor using one arm and kicking my feet back. I certainly don't think that's a beginners move. It's a good move, but should be in the 2nd or 3rd more advanced sections. One thing I definitely do not like is that she does not show you the exercise first and just keeps skipping around doing multiple things and without knowing what she's gonna do next makes it hard to keep form.  Form is everything when exercising. I have multiple DVD's and many show you the exercise first so you know what's coming next, not bouncing around to multiple things where you have to stop, look at the exercise, get in form. Good trainers don't bounce around without showing you the move first. I recommend watching the circuit first the entire way through so you understand the moves and then do it. Otherwise your gonna be flopping around not knowing what she's gonna do next. Now the more advanced segments it is understandable, because at that point you'll be used to the ways of the various exercises.",1492646400,5,1241,4.535714285714286

You work out in circuits and you can go at your own pace as well as with modifications which helps you to improve each time you workout, I also like the way that Jillian shows you the correct posture and emphasize good form instead of just completing the workouts.

This has to be one of Jillian's hardest simply because the first level is VERY difficult.  I saw someone else say that this really isn't a ""progressively harder"" DVD and I'd have to agree.  All three work outs are nearly equally hard with the second work out being the hardest (in my opinion).  As I've seen her do in other DVDs (especially Killer Buns and Thighs), level one is pretty balanced between cardio and strength; level two is INCREDIBLY cardio intensive (complete with me nearly having a cardio-induced panic attack in the first three minutes); level three is more focused on some very challenging strength/plank moves.

I've seen some complaints about this DVD being too full body.  I understand that, but Jillian always makes it clear that she likes to combine strength and cardio and for that I'm grateful.  I'm not the kind of person who has the time (or energy!) to do a DVD and then go out and run six miles.  I also don't really see how anyone can complain about not getting results.  I used five/eight pound weights with this DVD, completing each work out eight times and I saw incredible results.  My grandma told me that I have ""arms like Michelle Obama"" which is the single nicest body compliment anyone has ever given me.

The helpers in this DVD are really great--some of Jillian's best.  These girls are ferocious.  I was especially impressed with the modifier in each level.  Ashley struggles, but dang, so was I.  There are a few issues with editing in this DVD that are really noticeable, but I don't care lol.  It was only like once or twice that I noticed anyways.

Jillian has some really interesting, inventive moves in this DVD that has my body absolutely screaming.  I'll let you have the pleasure of discovering them.  Enjoying binding the dog...

Give this DVD a try--and don't give up after the first level.  It doesn't get too much harder than that!",1470009600,19,2291,4.622828784119107
7342910,5,B0125PSL1W,I love all of the Jillian's workouts and have about a dozen that I rotate regularly. This is the newest addition to my collection and it works. She includes a modification for every move (the easier version) which I have to use due to tendonitis and a tachycardia issue but it still gets the job done. My arms are definitely more toned.

7342947,3,B0125PSL1W,"I do my upper and lower body exercises on alternate days to give each muscle group a day of rest.  Abs tend to be included in lower body workout videos, so I usually do them on those days.  I want a concentrated workout for upper body.  It's tough to find one that thoroughly covers arms, shoulders, chest and back to the point that you're sore the next day.  This is not that video.  This includes lots of plank position and some goddess squats (deep squats like a sumo wrestler).  ""It's not my squatting day, Jillian!""  ""I did plank yesterday!""  Does this video work?  It does, but it's more like 30 Day Shred with a slight bias toward upper body.  It's like she thinks this is the only workout video you will use.  This will take you longer than 33 minutes per session if you're constantly changing from heavier to lighter weights without any helpful suggestions from Jillian.  You will also need to count your own reps to make sure you're even on each side.  It's pet peeve of mine when instructors start doing pushups without telling you how many or for how long.

7342948,4,B0125PSL1W,"This is a good Jillian workout! I love her mix of cardio and weights and I like that she uses a lot of compound movements so you are burning calories as you tone. I also like that Jillian gives modifications to make the workout easier or harder - so you can really make level 1 as difficult as level 3. You end up with 3 solid workouts - I try to rotate and do them all so I don't tire of one level.

I docked one star because although I think it's a good workout and I end up sweating and tired at the end, I haven't felt my muscles get super sore and I think there could have been just a little more focus on upper body (to contradict what I said in my first paragraph about liking the mix). In other words, I really like the mix, but feel like she could have done a little more upper focus. (For reference, I am in really good shape - and have done it all: skogg, P90X, Insanity, etc.)

Finally - Jillian is WAY less annoying in this one than in Killer Buns and Thighs and some of her other videos. So that is a huge plus! She is still chatty and does a lot of ""Isn't that right?"" and ""Huh? Huh?"" but it's way more tolerable than in some of her other videos.",1456963200,15,1161,3.9572649572649574

As an intermediate (sometimes a little advanced.. hehe) home exerciser, I have most of Jillian's DVDs and normally find her Level 1 workouts a bit too easy to give me a good sweat even with increased weights. This time was different though as I was sweating from the first circuit right through to the stretch, and my arms (and butt and legs!) are nicely sore this morning. Level 1 has lots of new and effective moves - even the warm up had a new twist with the back claps jumping jacks which I loved! As expected, the workout emphasises on the upper body but still managed to offer an effective total body workout (some squats, static lunges and plank variations). The 30 minutes flew by so quickly as they always do with Jillian's circuit workouts, and I found Jillian very encouraging (and a little toned down, which is to my liking) this time around :) I'll be back with an update once I have done more!",1448841600,3,999,4.347593582887701

7342990,5,B0125PSL1W,"I have most of Jillian's workouts and she does it again on this DVD. As someone at a more advanced level of fitness, I'm not sure I would separate these workouts into ""levels"" as much as three separate workouts focusing on the upper body. Like most of Jillian's workouts there are many different variants of plank and you will hit the abs and legs while doing this DVD. I would recommend having a couple of different weights to work with as there are a few more complicated moves that could easily be done incorrectly with weights that are too heavy!",1447804800,10,550,4.51

7342992,5,B0125PSL1W,I love this video but the volume is to low! I have to turn the subtitles on. It is not fun to use sub titles when working out. Need less to say JM is the best.

7342999,3,B0125PSL1W,Love Jillian Michaels videos...but this one is a little more complex movements. She requires multiple exercise movements at once. Which would be fine if they weren't so complex that balance is an issue. They are all done with weights so I feel the exercise suffers due to the balance and stability issue.,1445817600,3,304,4.865384615384615

It's well produced and the workouts are fun.  There are three 30-minute workouts (each workout progresses in level of difficulty).  If you've done her Killer Body workout DVD, you will recognize a few moves in this one, but most of the moves are new and fresh.  And even though this DVD focuses on arms and back, it gives you a total body workout.  Love it!",1444608000,11,513,4.347368421052631

All the levels are challenging for me and I'm very familiar with JM workouts (I do at least one per day but have a lot in rotation--One Week Shred, Kickbox Fastfix, Killer Buns and Thighs, Extreme Shed and Shred, etc, etc...). This is another favorite for sure and I can definitely feel it in my back right now from the level one that I did last night. Highly, highly recommended for chicks with spaghetti arms like me. I used to work on only abs and lower body but this one makes me want to keep working on my arms and back.",1444089600,3,558,4.224299065420561

8725463,3,B0125PSL1W,"I've only done workout 1 a few times, haven't tried level 2 or 3 yet, but it is a good workout.  Typical Jillian style workout.

I find it very annoying though that the girls are lifting 3s the entire time!  Jillian says lift heavy for certain moves & they never increase their weight.  I've done several Jillian workouts and never have I seen her allow this.  In fact I've seen her take weights out of someone's hand & toss them aside if they are lifting too light!!",1527724800,,467,4.32183908045977
8725464,3,B0125PSL1W,"HUGE JillKillin'Me Fan!  A little background, I've done 30 DAY SHRED, Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, 6 Week Six-Pack, No More Trouble Zones,  Ripped in 30, Killer Abs and Killer Buns & Thighs.
Did LEVEL 1 & first thing I noticed is that Jillian's 3-2-1 sysytem is not incorporated in this workout program which was ok for me bc its a good change of pace.  Even though program was not broken out in her 3-2-1 system there were still a lot of workouts that targeted the Abs....a few plank style workouts and floor workouts were definitely incorporated with the core in mind while still strengthing arms & back.  This workout was 4 circuits done twice with a nice mix of hand weight exercises and using your own body weight (ex: planks).  The one thing missing was the high energy cardio that you see in 30 Day Shred and Ripped in 30 (ex: high knees, jumping jacks, etc.)  It was more of a total body workout versus just arms and back - some people may find that is not what they want since that is not what the 'title' leads you to believe BUT I do not mind this because working out the entire body is so important.  Again, while strengthening other body parts like the core, she still worked out the arms or back.  I enjoyed both the warm-up and the cool down....some new moves but I thought they were very effective.  It is very fast paced and I had to stop and rewind when I had to familiarize myself with a new move or change weights.  Faster paced than 30DS and Ripped in 30 which I can do without pausing.  I would suggest reviewing workout program before doing it in order to make sure you are doing it effectively and don't inadvertenly hurt yourself.  I thought this was a solid workout and I will definitely be incorporating it into my dvd workout rotation.  I do think that you will get stonger but I agree with other reviewers that you will not build muscle mass unless you increase weights and slow down.  This not my favorite bc it is so fast paced and I'm a little concerned with injury and I need to give myself more time bc I need to rewind and replay.  Other reviewers are bothered by her music or what she says but honsetly I'm so focused on keeping pace and using proper form that it goes right over my head (lol).  When I have paid attention I think most of her words are positive/ explaining importance of move.  LEVEL 1 is a 3 for me (I normally rate her at a 4 or 5) but Jillian is still my Go To GIRL.  I will update my review once I do Level 2.
(Side Note:  If using heavier weights is your focus and building muscle your goal then I would strongly recommend Chalene Johnson's program ""ChaLean Extreme"" - you will not be disappointed - lost serious inches, metabolism was on fire and I really toned up.  Absolutely love this program and I do it at least once a year either on its own or as a hyrbrid.)",1527552000,2,2823,4.300567107750473
