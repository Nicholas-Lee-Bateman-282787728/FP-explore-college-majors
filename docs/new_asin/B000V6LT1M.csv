8216799,4,B000V6LT1M,"I have always found working out and fitness routines incredibly boring! My friend half jokingly recommended this DVD to me, and I have no idea why it was a joke, I love this workout routine. I haven't really done other pilates routines but this one is great. I am looking forward to trying some of her other DVD's.

Have fun working out, it makes all the difference!! :)",1374364800,,370,4.4411764705882355
8216800,5,B000V6LT1M,"The pilates work-out is 35 minutes long and pretty challenging, and I was sore the next day after doing it.  I like how it focuses a lot on your abs.  I'm surprised it got some bad reviews.  It's a hard work-out, but doesn't run too long, so it's easy to fit in your day when you don't have a lot of time.",1307664000,,305,3.8870967741935485
8216801,3,B000V6LT1M,"I got these DVDs as a gift a few years ago. I was super stoked on the whole concept, being an alternative lady into fitness myself. However I was very disapointed in the music, because as others have mentioned, it is not exactly what I deem indie rock. Granted, indie technically stands for independant label, and could in theory be kind of music... The music on it is OK, not particularly my taste and not particulary great for working out. But I digress.

The workout more or less was difficult when I started, and most moves have become easier over the years (I'm a sporatic exerciser.) Still, there are a few moves that are very advanced, which they show the beginner and intermediate girls doing, but I still can't achieve. (Like how about laying on your belly, holding your feet behind your head and lifting up...? Yea, ok)

These days I opt to use this DVD when I can't get to the gym and I just want to move my body. I use the instruction only audio option to put on my own music, which is actually a very cool and great option. More or less, this DVD is cool - but just OK.",1284422400,,1082,4.299019607843137
8216802,5,B000V6LT1M,"Is time perfect before going to work and you feel like you really worked out, it's more for intermediates.",1271203200,,106,4.631578947368421
8216803,2,B000V6LT1M,"As an old school punk and alternative rocker and not-so-old-school exercise DVD enthusiast, I was really hoping that Chaos's series of workout DVDs would be cool, fun, and get me a great workout without the dorkiness of other DVDs. Unfortunately, she's not really a Pilates instructor. Although she does give a modicum of alignment instruction at the beginning of the workout, she does not really know how to put together a Pilates routine. The moves alternate between too simple and too advanced, and there is not enough cueing in proper Pilates form. There is a reason that the best Pilates instructors put together exercises in a certain order, and zero in on exact precision of moves - all that is what makes Pilates effective, and safe! You do NOT get that here, and you could potentially hurt yourself. And while I like the idea of having cool background music instead of the dreck on most exercise DVDs, honestly, as a former rock critic, none of the music here sent me into throes of indie rock ecstasy (it wasn't bad, just not fab), and even worse, considering that this is an exercise DVD, it does not help you keep count with your moves. And that is really the main reason for music on an exercise DVD - to keep your workouts on rhythm and on count, so you're doing the right amount of reps and keeping each side even. I know somewhere out there, there is someone who knows how to put together a well-taught exercise DVD with great music. This one isn't it.",1248825600,11,1468,4.585551330798479
8216804,5,B000V6LT1M,"While I agree with the other reviews that this is more of an introduction to pilates, I gave it five stars because aside from it being a good work-out, the video was appealing to look at and time efficient. I know some people like to work out to videos for an hour or more, but I'm a student and it's nice to have a 35 minute work-out I can do in my dorm., shower, then head to class.
There is also the option of turning off the music and then you can use your own. Also the instructions were pretty good. I didn't feel like I had to stare at the screen to know what I was doing, although occasional looks were necessary.",1219276800,2,621,4.056910569105691
8216805,4,B000V6LT1M,"i like these 2 dvd's- the production quality is pretty low, but the workout, cast and music are good, with lots of music options, and even the ability to kill the music altogether and use your own.
not an easy workout the first time around, but not difficult to pick up at all- perfect to me, since usually they don't keep my interest long if I nailed it the first time...",1218931200,,372,4.253521126760563
8216806,3,B000V6LT1M,"I was excited to see someone put a spin on my boring old pilates classes, and was excited for this to come in the mail.  When I got it, though, I realized it's just one simple workout with three alternate music settings.  As anyone who uses exercise DVDs knows, variety is the spice of life, or boredom ensues.

While Chaos and her friends are entertaining to look at, the workout is VERY basic, and as I said, not very long.  I would have loved for this to have more ""meat"" to it.  On a good note, the DVD was very good to show a different character for beginners levels, intermediate, and advanced users.  So if you're looking for a basic workout with a twist, this one's good.  If you need something more, you might have to stick with the same old same old.",1205971200,5,760,4.2727272727272725
