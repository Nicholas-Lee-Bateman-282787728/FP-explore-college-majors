8355282,1,B0027ZH9HI,"Well, darn it!  I just tried to watch ""Home To Danger,"" which was very enjoyable, until all the skips and freezes started!  About halfway in, the film simply froze up for good.  I think I will take a pass on any more dvds from VCI.  This set was not cheap, either.",1391212800,,264,4.117647058823529
8355283,4,B0027ZH9HI,"I thought this was a absolute bargain for this wonderful group of 50's british black and white movie set although the story lines are a little corny in todays standards i just loved the way each story took me back to times of my growing up in england only a boy at that time.
 I enjoyed all the cars and trucks they use as this is my favourite automobile period full of cars that i now collect this is great winter time entetainment that takes me back in time.",1311120000,,460,4.168539325842697
8355284,5,B0027ZH9HI,These are good movies and they are good quality.  I am happy with my purchase.,1285372800,4,78,4.2
8355285,5,B0027ZH9HI,"If you like British Movies from the 50's you'll love these. Overall excellent quality transfers. I enjoyed each and every one of these six movies. I especially liked ""Bond of Fear"". Not only was a typical English family from the time period portrayed but also a Series I Land Rover complete with trailer (Caravan). I enjoyed every minute of it. Great scenery along the way too! Hope there will be more of these type DVD's in the future. Order it from Amazon.com as soon as you have a chance. Great movies at a small price!",1249084800,9,522,4.505263157894737
8355286,2,B0027ZH9HI,"As a movie lover and with the 'Ill try anything once approach' I decided to get this. I have the Hammer Film Noir set and the early Alfred Hitchcock movies where the entire cast was British. I figured I would enjoy this set of movies and well I was really disappointed. I would rent these before making the purchase to be honest.
I think that a die hard British movie lover ( and a die hard classic gangster movie lover) will enjoy this, and someone who really liked the VCI Forgotten Noir series might like this as well. But for someone who is a casual fan or likes some but not all gangster movies, this might not be everyone's cup of tea
Since all the titles are shown on Amazon's own page, I won't get into every single thing but from an overall standpoint I found them to be really, really dull and uninteresting. I found the characters to be bland and the stories to be just blah to the point I was getting restless watching, sort of like sitting in a college lecture with a boring professor and you're looking at your watch waiting for the lecture to end.
These aren't Hitchcock, these aren't even on par with the Hammer Noir and do not hold a candle to Warner's Gangster movies.
I am not going to say it's awful don't buy it, but I will say that this will captivate some, but not all. I suggest that if you really want to try them out you should rent them first if you are curious about seeing them.
Not everyone will agree with my assessment, but these movies will not meet everyone's tastes..
On a positive note the transfers I would say are very good - from an overall standpoint and VCI did a credible job with most likely some really obscure films",1246838400,13,1660,4.306709265175719
8355287,5,B0027ZH9HI,"VCI Entertainment presents ""BRITISH CINEMA:THE RENOWN PICTURES CRIME & NOIR"" --- (1950-1956) (453 min/B&W) --- (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Perhaps the beauty of 'Film-Noir' is its lack of limitation, and its problematic nature of strict classification. Translated literally as ""Black Cinema (or film)"" and so defined by French critics post WW2 to describe the increasing trend of American crime dramas shot with murky, shadowy grays often with anti-hero protagonists. Plot devices of amnesia, recent ex-convict characters, flash-back (remembered) narratives, femme fatales, shared guilt, pathos, classic nemesis and occasional obtuse camera angles are only a few of the recognizable stylistic norms building the distinguishing keys of Film-Noir. Most often plots were derived from the hard-boiled pulp fiction novels of the era. More of a theme or mood than a 'genre' - the Noir appeal spawned many contemporary imitations - The titles in this set is what we call 'Classic British Noir'.

DISC ONE:

BLACKOUT (September 1950) (73 min/B&W) - Robert S. Baker (Director)
The film is full of actors familiar from that period,including one of my favorite actors of that time Eric Pohleman. He really was a superb villain. The fact that he had a continental accent meant that this made him sound even more sinister to the post war audiences. Also featured is Michael Brennan who must have beaten up more leading men than he had hot dinners. Kynaston Reeves who usually played Judges has a longer part than usual. In all a reasonably entertaining thriller

BOND OF FEAR (April 1956) (72 mins/B&W) - Henry Cass (Director)
So here we have good old Dermot Walsh minding his own business, taking his family on a trip with the caravan in tow and ending up with a wanted criminal holding them hostage whilst on the move with their trailer.

HOME TO DANGER (August 1951) (66 mins/B&W) - Terence Fisher (Director)
Our heroine has her hands full and more when she returns home to claim the family estate after her father's death.  Could it be that another party is interested in the estate and is trying to kill her.

DISC TWO:

MEET MR. CALLAGHAN (June 1954) (88 mins/B&W) -  Charles Saunders (Director)
Based on a Peter Cheyney novel, and featuring his main character of Callaghan (De Marney), the film moves along at a brisk pace, and the plot, which is quite involved, never sags and retains the viewers interest all the way --- The scene in the nightclub, when he is tempted by singer Adrienne Corri, is a joy of deadpan expression and he certainly carries this film along in a totally professional manner --- You are left with the distinct impression that this is how the author imagined his main character to be.

NO TRACE (8 September 1950) (75 mins/B&W) -  John Gilling (Director)
The tale of a famous crime novels writer who commits the perfect murder in order to protect himself against a black mailer --- A guy he knew several years ago and with whom he committed some criminal events --- This is an effective, sharp and breathtaking nail biter.

RECOIL (August 1953) (79 mins/B&W) -  John Gilling (Director)
Her father is killed in a heist gone wrong and the criminal is seen by Jean (Elizabeth Sellars) --- Jean then sets about trying to trap the killer (Edward Underdown) --- Cleverly working her way into the confidence of the killer and his cohorts, Jean keeps the police updated on the future plans of the gang.
