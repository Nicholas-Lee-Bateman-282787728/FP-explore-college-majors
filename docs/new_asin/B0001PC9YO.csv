8015982,5,B0001PC9YO,"I love this video! Alexandra breaks down each move to make it ""click"" and understandable. The camera views create a perfect observation to be able to examine and scrutinize each move. The camera insets are an added bonus to be able to discern each move. The stretches focus on limbering up the muscles that are used in belly dance and to strengthen them to be able to execute the moves.

I'd reccomend this video to anyone beginning on their personal journey in belly dance.",1179014400,4,474,4.642857142857143
8015983,5,B0001PC9YO,"I have done a number of bellydance tapes, and this is one of my favorites.  I love how Alexandra faces a mirror while working out so you can see what both your front AND back are supposed to be doing :-)  You don't just learn to bellydance, you get a nice set of toning exercises for the arms, legs and stomach as well as a fun, easy low-impact aerobic workout.  Not only does this workout help develop a toned body, it builds body awareness and confidence as well!",1173916800,2,465,4.261363636363637
8015984,5,B0001PC9YO,"After having seen quite a few exercise and instructional videos on belly dancing, I rate this one highly.  This is the best of both worlds: great stretching, along with a well-done, not boring, instructional.  With some videos, you get too much repetition of one movement.  You will not with this one ... and this tape will not sit on your shelf after the first viewing.",1080172800,10,370,4.661538461538462
8015985,4,B0001PC9YO,"A new beginners video with a seemingly new face to the bellydance scene, yet Alexandra's been teaching in the Greater Seattle area for over 12 years and dancing for over 24 years!  Perfect for someone without any knowledge of bellydance and would like to practice in their home before joining a class or for additional practice of your base bellydancing moves you already know.
Video teaches: isolations, basic moves like hip lifts and hip drops, Egyptian walk, basic hips, the rock step, arm movements and more.  AND it covers a full warm up streches and cool down stretches as well as teaching proper posture!",1078963200,22,611,4.865384615384615
