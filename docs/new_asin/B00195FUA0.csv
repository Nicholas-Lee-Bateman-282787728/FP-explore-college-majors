8272041,4,B00195FUA0,"There is something breath-taking in the courage and determination of this lone turtle as she swims slowly across thousands of miles of ocean to reach that one beach where she will lay her eggs.  All the dangers of the ocean depths and the long-line fisherman above stand in her way, yet she goes on, intent on her purpose.  The photography is beautiful, F. Murray Abraham's narration is excellent, and I found myself rooting for this gallant turtle.",1414540800,,449,4.818181818181818
8272042,5,B00195FUA0,"Well worth the money to see how the life experience of one turtle
can bring about changes that we should all be aware of. Very enjoyable,
have watched this movie several times and continue to learn from it.",1365292800,,206,4.447368421052632
8272043,3,B00195FUA0,"It's time for a loggerhead to leave her foraging grounds (was it off the coast of Mexico?) and return to her nesting beach in Japan.  While she makes this journey of thousands of miles (sans GPS!), she faces storms, tiger sharks, long line fisheries, and the subtleties driven by climate change.

But the film's editors keep switching between loggerhead and green turtles, the turtles are often filmed close to the bottom of the seabed (with corals... across the deep Pacific?), and the loggerhead female is usually filmed milling around, not swimming in a ""biologically programmed"" direction.

There is some great footage... schools of sharks, jellies, turtles and fish at feeding stations, coral spawning, and more.  And there are some great clips of sea turtles.  However, it seemed that the film was edited from existing clips from various sources, rather than a film made to order about a loggerhead.

I purchased this because I wanted a 60 minute DVD on sea turtles, their life history and conservation challenges.  I'll keep looking.",1291766400,3,1040,5.08235294117647
8272044,5,B00195FUA0,"I recently purchased this DVD through Amazon and was very impressed by the prompt arrival of my purchase. The DVD in and of itself is truly amazing. The cinemaphotography was incredible and I
would recommend this DVD to each and every human being and their families. It is a true & rare gem. The combined efforts that went into the production and filming of this DVD were extraodinary. I will treasure this for the remainder of my natural life and hope to travel to  one day catch a glimpse of these endangered gentle dinasours of the sea. Swim on-  beautiful sea turtles!!! May the currents guide you home safely. Thank you Murray Abraham.",1280707200,,640,4.654867256637168
8272045,2,B00195FUA0,"I love turtles of all kinds, and sea turtles are really remarkable.  There are a lot of nice video clips in this program, and some are, out of this context, very interesting.  This purports to be a tale of a female Loggerhead turtle crossing the Pacific Ocean from East to West.  That much is clearly fiction.  Most of the better clips are of Green turtles.  This is mentioned at times, but often one is confused about the identity and even species of the turtle that is being depicted.  Sometimes, you switch from a few seconds in a clip of one turtle, to a clip of a clearly different turtle, with no mention of the change.  The narrative and clips frequently shift out to other species, often out of context.  For example, the narrative discusses a growing abundance of jellyfish, but there is no reference to the turtle that we are supposed to be following.  Do Loggerheads eat jellyfish in the open ocean?  Ultimately, the fictional approach of the movie makers becomes the kind that has been discredited in the past in many wildlife films.  With no credibility to the story line, the many diversions here into ""eco messages"" like global warning lose their impact and credibility.  It is hard to believe that the clips shown in this video really represent the places in the journey that they are supposed to represent.  Maybe all of the Loggerhead clips in this video were taken at only one or two locations.  It's hard to tell.  It would be nice to see someone track a real turtle for a year and make an honest, scientific documentary that presented a balanced account of its many (and interesting) real activities.  Certainly this film has its entertainment value, and some people will defend it vigorously on those grounds.  It does makes me appreciate the really good wildlife films, like the Blue Planet or Planet Earth series.  There is something about avoiding fiction that I think is a prerequisite for a good wildlife film.",1229558400,2,1937,4.714285714285714
