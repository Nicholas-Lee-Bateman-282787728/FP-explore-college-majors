But Lara Phillips will melt your heart with her beautiful performance, i can't understand why this talented beauty is not starring in more pictures. She does have a small role in the film ""Road to Perdition"" as Ruby a waitress. Lara looks like a young Susan Sarandon, and seems to have Susan's talent for acting. The whole cast in this film are great, the lead character played by an actor called Jeff Strong is the perfect vessel to hang such a complex emotional portrail of lonliness and an inability to know oneself, but this is where this film scores big, dealing with human frailty and the strengh of women. If you liked / loved Patricia Arquette in ""True Romance"" then please give this film your time.
I'm looking forward to hearing Lara, who is on the commentary track, along with the rest of the cast and the director. Barrel Entertainment should be commended for putting in the love for this release, extra's galore.
