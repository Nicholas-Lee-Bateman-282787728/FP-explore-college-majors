8088998,3,B000BMCY7E,The male portion of this dvd was god awful boring. I fell asleep.,1441152000,,65,4.076923076923077
8088999,2,B000BMCY7E,Not sure if it is because this DVD was made in 2003 but really for the little bit of tips I did get I could have gotten off the internet. Honestly if I knew the video was done in 2003 I probably would not have gotten it. And honestly I didn't think the make up itself was that great. The make up they did on both of the clients I don't see how it would hold up when taking photos....it is so light I can see it being washed out when the bride takes her photos..honestly I wish I could get my money back.,1341014400,,503,3.8461538461538463
8089000,3,B000BMCY7E,"This cd really did not do much for me.  The first makeup artist seemed to use some techniques that are not usually taught ex. the application of eyebrow color. She applied color going against the eye brow hair instead of the same direction.  The male makeup artist spoke too soft to hear what he was saying sometimes.  Although, his applications seemed more professional than the female.  Let's just say I have owned better how to makeup applications cds and books.",1214611200,,465,4.775
8089001,5,B000BMCY7E,"This video is excellent! I purchased it hoping that it would help me learn more makeup techniques, and that is exactly what I got. This video shows step-by-step instructions on how to apply makeup. It gives great tips and its really easy to follow. If you're looking for a really good video to help you learn new makeup techniques, then this is the video you want!",1207180800,2,364,4.53030303030303
8089002,3,B000BMCY7E,"Susie Galvez it's great!!! She gives you a lot of makeup tips and also advise you how to deal with your clients (for makeup artist or beauty stylist). Excellent explaining!

However, I gave this product a medium rate,
because the video shots are not the best. The entire DVD lighting was kind of dark. And it make me feel kind of sleeping.

However Susie Galvez it's excellent! and I would buy again a DVD from Her!
I repeat the Video filming and SHOTS on this DVD Were not the best.",1191196800,3,483,4.355555555555555
