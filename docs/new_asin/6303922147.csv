726522,5,6303922147,"Slow , hesitant building up of a memorable relation which happens in just less than two hours.. This is a great movie from beginning till the end.. You can't afford to miss it !  Both Page and Ford were excellent. Five  stars because that is what is technically possible here !  Listening  Amazon.com?",945907200,13,301,4.622641509433962
726523,4,6303922147,"I cannot remember how many times I have watched the movie late at night, crying and laughing throughout.  I like Page's ""spinster"" who shows the secret desires and wishes of such women.  As she and Ford grow  closer, she blossoms into a truer form of herself.  Ford is both charming  and comical in his predicament. He is falling in love while already engaged  to be married.  I found this movie unpredictable and engaging. I have even  gotten my two teenaged sons to watch on occasion. They like it also. I never  grow tired of viewing it.  Yes, it is blatantly sentimental with a happy  ending.  So what!! I like movies that end that way.  Then I turn off the  late show and go to sleep with a smile on my face.",928281600,15,713,4.343511450381679

How many sexy socialites with mink wraps, up-dos, and designer luggage have you ever seen in Altoona? WOW! Angela Lansbury who I first saw in ""Gaslight"" was stunning. But not believable visiting from a hick town in the middle of nowhere. Geraldine Page on the other hand was the most annoying woman on the planet imho. I get the lonely hearts single spinster deal, depressing and desperate. However, everyone really seemed to like her and found her most kind. Perhaps Avalon, Ohio is even worse than Altoona? A dashing Glenn Ford would most likely pass on this lady for a serious adventure but there we see him pining away for this screecher from his hotel room with his fianc.

I always try to appreciate the time, tone and morale of a films date and handicap the script to reflect code restrictions, current affairs, etc. There was no way to explain away the droll attempts at humor and elevated relationship themes.

One kick was to see the two Gladys's from ""Bewitched"" together with the ever reliable Mary Wickes to complete the lonely hearts club.

One way to sum up this film: you want to sit outside in winter vs a cozy warm restaurant and then choose the coldest seat in the house - cement! Avoid.",1494028800,,1248,4.633484162895928
726810,5,6303922147,"Well, there are such good reviews already written here, especially the first one, so I could not of wrote anything better. But, I will say:  I recently saw this movie for the first time and I am in love with the story.  My husband works for the Post Office, so he really loved the movie and actors.  I really appreciated how Geraldine Page was so kind to everyone she met.  She would give almost everyone a compliment, and made those around her feel that they were very special.  She is described as a 'Wall Flower' on the back cover, but I did not see her that way.  She was attractive, not a shy person,  she was not afraid to express her feelings; or her opinions too.  When Glenn Ford, has these accidental run ins with Geraldine Page, little by little he begins to really appreciate her personality and Charm; and later her genuineness and sincerity.  Weighing Geraldine Page to future wife  Angela Lansbury, who was totally selfish and came with a lot of baggage, namely her family.  'True Love wins him over in the end.'  I only wish the scene at the very end would of had sound and would of been longer.  Some really funny scenes in this movie, and a great cast of actors and actresses.",1493942400,3,1194,4.422018348623853
726811,1,6303922147,"'Dear Heart' is a dated, anachronistic paean to 'middle class' virtues that had as little to do with middle class reality c. 1964 as it does now.  This condescending mishmash trots out one contrivance after another in the most unlikely of situations where 'characters' don't so much interact as hit their marks and recite their scripted inanities.  The miscast Geraldine Page, who can be quite effective in certain roles but unbearably busy in others, is unfortunately in latter mode here.  Her busybody postmistress is a pushy annoyance as written, but Page's very 'muchness' makes her utterly insufferable.  She goes about calling almost total strangers by first names, inserting herself and her needs onto anything and everything and mugging incessantly at the slightest whim.  It's an excruciating exhibition.

Glen Ford is his usual humorless self and his glum performance takes whatever over-the-top life Page tries to inject here and kills it.  Angela Lansbury (who'd have been a better choice for Page's role) is sadly wasted but brings a refreshing level-headed balance to Page's flighty fidgetiness.  'Dear Heart' was clearly aimed at the suburban female audience of the '60s but it was dated even then and never found its audience.  Lucky for them.",1493164800,,1259,5.223880597014926

Sweet, charming, using the very best character actors of film and TV, this extremely well written movie has excellent plot structure and scene movement. Shot in sparkling black and white with perfect use of art direction, music and costume, its leads are working at the top of their form. It is very sentimental, but that is its most important virtue. Made at the ending of the studio system it has that visual sheen and excellent craft on every level that only a studio made film can possess. Directed by one of the best directors of this genre it is extremely moving and charming. It is one of my favorites of all time of which there are quite a few.",1467504000,,736,4.45925925925926

727101,5,6303922147,"This is a very sweet romantic black and white movie about a spinster lady, Evie, (Geraldine Page) who is in New York for the Postmaster's Conference. (She is the postmistress in Ohio.) She meets a businessman, Harry (Glenn Ford), at the hotel where they are both staying. Harry has been a life-long confirmed bachelor until he decides it's time to ""come down to earth,"" and has recently become engaged to Phyllis whom he met in Pennsylvania.  Phyllis is not with Harry in NY, and Harry and Evie start spending some casual time together. It is not long before Evie is quite taken with Harry. He tells her he is married, but she eventually confronts him that she doesn't believe it, and he confesses.  Eventually, Harry begins to have feelings for Evie, and they kiss in her room while he is there to make a phone call. Suddenly, a phone call for Harry is routed to Evie's room,, and she answers: it's Phyllis, and she asks to speak to Harry. He is quite surprised, and nervous and says he'll be right down. Evie then realizes there really is a significant other in Harry's life, and is once again let down by a man she truly cared about, but it appears is unavailable. She decides to leave the convention early, but as she is going through the gate to board her train at Grand Central Station she is paged and asked to report to the customer service counter. She is given a message from Harry that tells her not to move, not one inch. She sits down on her suitcase, and is obviously perplexed, but hopeful about what it could mean. Harry appears at the top of the long staircase at the station, sees her sitting on her luggage among the throngs of people, and goes to her. The crowed swallows up the actual reunion, but the end scene and title song play as a fade in shows them embracing and in a tender kiss. It is such a beautiful movie, and one that resonates with hope, even though up to that point your life has been lonely.",1443139200,3,1928,4.412921348314606

727432,5,6303922147,"I love this movie because of the sweet, innocent relationship that develops between two very different people.

In the midst of a convention at a New York City hotel, a kind, gentle, middle-aged single postmaster named Evie (Geraldine Page) meets a selfish, middle-aged, womanizing greeting card salesman named Harry (Glenn Ford) who has recently become engaged to a shallow, self-centered widow with a teenage son who ""needs a father.""

Geraldine Page is perfect as the thoughtful Evie, who is respectful of, and friendly to everyone she meets.  Harry has recently been promoted to marketing executive at his company, and he is preparing to settle down with his soon-to-be wife.  Yet, he still struggles with his old, irresponsible, playboy behavior toward women.  However, in a series of chance encounters, Harry and Evie  become drawn to each other.  They have both reached a point where they want to settle down and share the rest of their lives with someone they respect and enjoy being with.

Her vulnerability, her pain and joy shine through the character of Evie in a way that lifts this film from the era it so obviously is from.  Glenn Ford is perfect as the man who has had enough of relationships that are only ""surface mounted"".  There are several scenes that are memorable: one is the clumsy, but real kiss that begins with tentative touches.
The best moment is saved for last, and I will not describe it but it makes Grand Central station a place that may bring a smile as you pass through.

The movie always make me feel there is something about life that our very cool, and rather jaded attitudes cannot begin to know.  Nice song, too.

727437,2,6303922147,"I agree with the other 2-star review here.  I was compelled to watch this by  Robert Osborne,
whom I admire and often agree with, but not here.  I am immune to this strange movie's charms,
though it is a fascinating historical document.
I found both actors, though in some profound sense very effective,
creative not of amusing or fun people but expert in making weird, repressed figures,
both barely human: Paige's chronic, contrived ditzyness, a sort of Ohio Kabuki, seems a sad abstraction based on what
TV advertising and Family Circle-type magazines told middle class women to be
(she's waiting in stilted passivity for Ford or his equivalent to hit her like a truck); Ford plays (I couldn't tell if he was acting or dying piecemeal to finish this movie)
an inexplicably glum, vacant, sexless man
who is nonetheless magnetically attracted to the Paige character
(for he ""moves"" toward her at a glacial pace--that is the whole movie).
The dullness of the Ford character is exquisite--
What excites these people? They both seem designed by General Foods
and could be made of fake cheese or refined corn. This movie is the absolute,
late-baroque height of 50s uptight sexless-ness
in the service of some large, industrial mandate for conformity.
The bizarre thing is that it is from 1964.
This movie provides context for the exuberant appeal of the Beatles.
---
I did not read Bosley Crowther's 1965 New York Times' review of this movie until after I wrote this,
but he predicted my registration of this film, calling Paige's performance ""elaborate, artificial and improbable,"" Ford's character ""a colorless clod of the first water"" and the film's attempts at flirtatious, bond-building banter ""embarrassingly feeble and flat.""

Glenn Ford made a lot of good movies.  I'm guessing he was pretty much playing himself in this one as a fickle, hopeless chaser of skirts but wanting desperately to change his ways.  But it's the performance of Miss Geraldine Page as the equally desperate postmaster trying to connect with a man in a way that had always alluded her that makes this picture.  I'd only ever seen her in the John Wayne movie Hondo, and after seeing this, it made me sad that she had been somewhat disparaged in a biography of his.  Especially since she was the best thing about that film as well.  I highly recommend Dear Heart as a nostalgic journey for people my age and as perhaps an insight for younger viewers into the convoluted morality of a time long gone by.

727495,5,6303922147,"I am 54 years old, happily married, and love classic movies (especially the romantic ones).  My mother introduced me to old movies when I was in high school.  And now with each passing year, I am so grateful that she did.  I appreciate the artistry and emotional power of the classic movies, and ""Dear Heart"" is no exception.

I had the privilege of seeing this movie for the first time last year on TCM.  And I just watched it again on TCM.  This is a mature love story about two middle-aged strangers who cross paths while staying at a New York hotel.  The character played by Glenn Ford is engaged to be married when he happens to meet Geraldine Page's outgoing single lady postmaster attending a convention.  Circumstances keep throwing them together and ever so tentatively a romance buds.  I will not divulge the ending. You'll have to watch for yourself.

Geraldine Page is outstanding in the role of Evie, the warm, quirky, and wonderfully decent single working gal who has been unlucky in love.  While Glenn Ford is her perfect match as Harry the perennial bachelor who is trying to settle down.  All the elements including the direction by Delbert Mann, screenplay, supporting cast, sets, costumes, and photography are first rate.  And the beautiful and gracefully poignant score by Henry Mancini is unforgettable.  (Mancini should be considered as one of the great composers of the 20th century).

For the most part, current movies do not stir your heart or stay with you the way that a sincere and deceptively simple love story such as ""Dear Heart"" can. So Amazon, it's about time that you made this enduring love story available on DVD for all to enjoy.  Thank you for listening!",1342224000,8,1692,4.762886597938144
727496,5,6303922147,"Geraldine Page has a genuinely proven track record. Her riveting dramas have shown that she's a force to be reckoned with, but she's also had a few shots at comedy, and she never disappoints. I haven't seen Dear Heart in many years, but I'm waiting for the DVD. I would buy it in a heartbeat. I recall clever banter, a fun plot, the always reliable Glenn Ford, and a subtle and delightful perf from my favorite actress. This was Ms Page's fifth film, and she'd aready garnered 3 Oscar noms. She's not to be taken simply; there's always nuance behind her every move, inflection and mannerism. What more can I say? Love Page, this film, and wish someone would have the sense to put this on DVD, for the legion of fans who are waiting.

UPDATE: I ordered the film, and it's a decent transfer. The writing is below the standards of most Page films (Horton Foote, Tennessee Williams), but it's a sweet story. Glenn Ford is an actor I've always enjoyed, but he's not convincing as a lothario-type. Still, glad to have it in my Page collection.",1314316800,8,1037,4.51595744680851

727579,5,6303922147,"With those lines, Henry Manicini's song begins one of the finest romatic movies Hollywood ever produced. I have loved ""Dear Heart"" from my first viewing of it many years ago on television, and I was so happy when it was first released on VHS. I actually sent letters asking the movie be saved. Now, it is about to be forgotten again, and that would be such a shame. I hope someone will rescue this most wonderful of movies and release it on DVD. I promise to be an ardent customer.
Why is the movie so special? - wonderful script, superb acting, careful direction, and, of course, Henry Mancini's haunting score.
Geraldine Page, one of the finest actresses to grace the stage or silver screen, absolutely shines as the loveable, sometimes whacky, and always genuinely beautiful Evie Jackson.  Her performance in ""Dear Heart"" is a thing of beauty: to be enjoyed, marveled at, and treasured.
In the movie, Evie is a middle-aged postal clerk who hasn't found love. Despite being alone, she faces the world with courage and an open heart. Evie is one of those rare women who will walk right into your life and make it better if she is given the chance. She has, beneath her sometimes awkward exterior, a quiet, lovely grace; tolerance for others; and a quirky, disarming charm. You would think someone would see all that is there, but Evie hasn't found her ""Dear Heart.""
While attending a convention at a New York hotel, she meets Glenn Ford, a salesman, who thinks he has found love, but really hasn't. The script then masterfully unfolds, allowing this most unlikely of romances, to somehow find its way.
Mr. Ford gives an outstanding performance in this film. His work with Ms. Page is of the highest order. The film is also graced with a lovely performance by the most talented Angela Lansbury, who plays Glenn Ford's fiance. Combine three such fine actors; the wonderul director, Delbert Mann; a charming, humorous, poignant script by Tad Mosel; and include many of the finest supporting actors of that era; and you have nothing less than cinematic magic.
The movie has one beautiful scene after another. One of my favorites is when Geraldine Page and Glenn Ford are walking together in a hotel hallway, examining the room service trays left outside guests' doors, and commenting on what they tell about the people in the rooms. There is more insight into human nature in that one scene than in most movies. And the movie's ending - well, it is one of the finest ever filmed. If you want to know what love should be, look no further than this tender, romantic gem.
I love movies, and many of them I treasure, but ""Dear Heart"" is the one I cherish most. It so deserves to be saved. Someone, please save this movie and release it on DVD. If you do, it will, like the song says, ""... warm this night.""",1212451200,24,2799,4.643145161290323
727580,5,6303922147,"Probably one of the most romantic Films ever made, starring Geraldine Page and Glenn Ford as the unlikely couple thrown together by chance circumstances.

This Movie gives Geraldine Page an opportunity to show what a versatile actress she really is.  Compare this role, say,  to that which she plays in 'What Ever Happened To Aunt Alice' and you'll see what I mean!  From the moment this Movie starts, you are endeared to the character Evie Jackson; her simple and child-like innocence and vulnerability moves you to tears, and will capture your heart from the beginning.  From saving message cards sent to herself as mementoes from a 'lonely' trip away from home alone - to paying Bellboys to 'page' her name for nothing more than to feel 'wanted'...  Evie Jackson is one of those people who is naturally 'nice',  and blissfully unaware of it; someone nobody misses until they are gone from this life...  Somehow, Glenn Ford's character is no-where near good enough for her, but we rejoice in the ending that makes life worth living for Evie.

A Romantic comedy that although has amusing moments, they are,  at times,  so terribly sad and full of melancholia, they make us want to cry...

We are still longing for this Movie to come out on DVD, and perhaps now, having lost Glenn Ford recently, this may just happen, but the Video was only ever available in the USA, and so we may still have a long wait...

It was literally love at first sight and in fact both of us that day felt that at this party we were invited to we would be meeting our life partner.  We of course only discovered that fact later.

Staying at the same hotel:  a travelling saleman who is tired of his unattached, immature and uncommitted life.  He is adroitly and touchingly played by the versatile actor Glenn Ford.  Perfect casting!
This film is directed by Delbert Mann, who directed the innovative movie ""Marty,"" in which Hollywood glamor was dropped for a story about physically plain but very human and vulnerable people.
Above all, this is a movie about people who are trying to change, not only their lives, but themselves.  Even Ford's fiance, played by the ever talented Angela Lansbury, stubborn and stuck in her ways, desires a new life.  Unfortunately, it is not the one which Ford has in mind for himself.
