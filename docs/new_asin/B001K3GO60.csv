3663259,4,B001K3GO60,"This is another great Gin Miller workout. I've been working out with kettlebells for the last year and wanted something ""fresh"" without all the dancy prancy stuff of kettlenetics (that's NOT really using kettlebells). Gin brings lots of moves I haven't seen before while staying true to traditional RKC type moves. Music could be better (which is why only 4 stars), but, hey, I wasn't looking for music - just great moves. The 3 workouts focus on different body parts. Workout #1 arms and chest, Workout #2 triceps and back, workout #3 legs, but remember the advantage of kettlebells is you work the ENTIRE body - not separate body parts and Gin delivers. As to what weight to use, I started low 8#, but after the first workout went up to 15# and everything was quite doable. I would suggest lower weights if you haven't been working with kettlebells before because it is a different type of workout. Will use this again and again since it's easy on my knees, but tough on the muscles!",1242172800,8,985,4.634285714285714

I found Gin Miller to be an excellent instructor, she explains each exercise movement in detail. It's nice to see an instructor that has curves but is very fit. Please, start off with the proper size kettlebell. Since I've been exercising for a number of years, I made the mistake of buying a 15lb kettlebell. I was 5 minutes into the DVD and I realized I needed a much lighter kettlebell. I downsized to a 10lb kettlebell. Now I can get through the DVD. What a fantastic workout. You work your entire body in a short period of time. This DVD is a winner.",1241395200,17,776,5.815789473684211
3663261,5,B001K3GO60,"I thought this dvd was very informative, and gave a variety of exercises to begin using the kettelbell with.  The price was reasonable, and Gin Miller has been around in the fitness industry for a long time and is very good with cueing, execution and safety precautions.  I liked the way she progressed each exercise from the basic movement to adding more advanced variations to them.",1240531200,13,384,4.803030303030303
3663262,5,B001K3GO60,"I really like this DVD.  You get a good workout with it.  It's a little different than some of the other kettlebell workouts out there, but I feel this one is easier on the body but still getting you in shape.",1240012800,11,209,4.073170731707317
3663263,5,B001K3GO60,"I have been working out for 30 years but have rarely found exercises that do so much to improve the strength of my arms.  Not only do these exercises whip your shoulders and butt into shape but they also do a great job of tackling that horrible chicken fat.  I have been doing them for 3 weeks now and already see a big difference.  I considered myself in pretty good shape before I started this new exercise but I have not been this toned in a very long time and I've exercised almost daily since I was 19. I have had other tapes by Gin and have always thought she was a good instructor.  It is an intermediate level workout, so don't kid yourself that it is easy but if you are serious about getting in shape and don't want to drag out the step then this is a great new way to work out. Just be careful to research the size kettlebell you should get.  They suggest beginners should start with nothing heavier than a 6. I think the kettlebell is fun and challenging and I will be sticking with it for a very long time.",1236902400,39,1019,4.152284263959391

3663265,4,B001K3GO60,"I am new to kettebell and not a ""purist."" I really like the cuing and instruction Gin provides in the video. It was just what I needed to get started with this type of strength training. My only complaint is that the video is not chaptered to ""play all""; you have to keep selecting which part of the routine you would like to complete. Other than that, this is a good workout.",1233187200,24,376,4.236111111111111
3663266,1,B001K3GO60,"I am a huge fan of Gin Miller, but this workout is disappointing.  It is basically a weight workout using a kettlebell, rather than a workout with genuine kettlebell exercises.  For those familiar with kettlebell workouts, a lighter kettlebell will be needed, more akin to the weight you would typically use with dumbells.  For the few exercises she includes in the workout that most closely resemble genuine kettlebell exercises, her form is, at best, nontraditional, and at worst, potentially unsafe, especially if you are using the amount of weight you would typically use for traditional kettlebell workouts.  Although this DVD is less expensive than many of those sold by certified kettlbell instructors, it is not worth the money.",1363046400,2,736,5.211864406779661
3663267,2,B001K3GO60,Boring. Not much else to say. Not as good as the workout DVD by Angie Miller.  If you are just looking for a beginner set this would probably do.,1356912000,,145,4.0
3663268,5,B001K3GO60,"This was my first Gin Miller video.  She is a wonderful teacher.  She explains and demonstrates each exercise in a clear, friendly, easy to follow manner.  This was great for me - a kettle bell beginner.  Gin gives you a good foundation for doing kb exercises.",1356739200,,260,4.586956521739131
3663269,5,B001K3GO60,"I completely disagree with those who have disparaged this workout!  Gin is clear, precise, the video is perfect since she gives you two angles on all the moves so you can keep your ""neutral"" core going, and the music is NOT a distraction.  I've always been told tht kettlebell swings are to be powered by the hips, so I'm not sure why some reviewers said that these swings can cause back injuries. It's a workout!  Any workout CAN cuase injuries.  Standing up from the sofa can do that, too, but I thnk we all agree that we need to get off the sofa... LOL  Overall, I think this is an excellent intro as well as a guide for more advanced kettlebellers.",1320364800,,652,4.355371900826446
3663270,3,B001K3GO60,"I picked up this DVD used without knowing anything about it:  on the outside of my copy (which is just a cardboard sleeve), it says ""Bonus Kettlebell DVD & Workout Guide,"" and it also carries the Danskin Now label.  On the inside, however, it contains instructor Gin Miller's information, and the DVD itself is titled Calorie Burner Workout with Kettlebells, the same as what is being sold here under different packaging.  After doing some research, I learned that in addition to being sold separately, this DVD is included with the purchase of all Danskin Now (Empower) kettlebells, which come in 5, 8, and 10 lb. increments.

Gin works out alone in a bright studio with wood floors.  The screen sometimes splits into double or triple views to show different angles.  The Main Menu for this DVD appears as follows:

Safety Guidelines
Warm-Up
Workout 1
Workout 2
Workout 3
Cool Down/Stretch

If you select the Safety Guidelines, Gin appears within a small inset screen on the main menu.  I was disappointed in this brief (<3 minutes) overview, mainly because Gin suggests starting with very light kettlebells.  She seems to be suggesting weights consistent with the Empower brand (i.e., 5, 8, and 10 lbs.) rather than recommending the heavier weight ranges that most certified kettlebell instructors usually suggest, even for beginners.  NOTE:  Gin is NOT a certified kettlebell instructor.)

I was further disappointed in the Warm-Up.  Here Gin walks viewers through what she calls kettlebell ""throws"" (I have no idea why she uses her own terminology rather than to simply say kettlebell swings).  Gin's form for the throw/swing is totally incorrect, as she bases the move on a squat rather than on a deadlift; attempt this move with a lighter kettlebell only further exacerbates the problem.  I am very concerned that those with no prior kettlebell experience might follow Gin's poor form and learn bad habits which could potentially lead to injury.

Each of the three workout segments is meant to stand alone; in fact, you are automatically returned to the Main Menu after each ends (there is no ""Play All"" option).  I have broken down each segment in greater detail below.

Workout #1, 9 minutes
Gin begins this segment with her version of the kettlebell swing, kettlebell ""throws.""  Not only does she perform the swing move incorrectly, but also she doesn't even hold the kettlebell by the top of the handle--she holds it by the handle sides.  I simply substituted correct swing form while she was doing her version.  Other exercises included chest press (holding the kettlebell in both hands), overhead shoulder press, and upright rows with side toe tap.  The final move is a squat side to side to which Gin adds a swinging high overhead pull; this seemed somewhat unsafe to me, so I just did squats with cleans instead.  Similarly, she performs swinging bicep curls that I skipped.

Workout #2, 14 minutes
This section was my favorite of the three.  Gin starts here with lunge and row, adding a row with throw; I stuck with just the row.  Next comes a series that begins with passing the kettlebell under one knee; this is followed by a one-leg deadlift-type move, touching the kettlebell to the floor.  Gin then combines these two moves together, passing the kettlebell under the knee, doing the deadlift, and passing the the kettlebell back again.  Gin finishes with some triceps overhead presses.

Workout #3, 14.5 minutes
For this segment, Gin begins with a back lunge, first not using the kettlebell at all.  She then adds the kettlebell to hold, progressing to an overhead chop (I stuck with the hold).  In-between sides, she stretches the back/hamstrings with a hip hinge.  She also performs a Figure 8 move that involves weaving the kettlebell to either side (but not under the legs as with other kettlebell workouts).  The final move is what she calls an ""angel squat"":  basically a plie moving into lifting the kettlebell overhead.

Cool Down/Stretch (5 minutes)
Gin leads the view through some basic standing stretches here, beginning with stretching the sides/torso, moving on to the hamstrings (using the kettlebell to assist with balance), including the arms/shoulders, and ending with a few deep breaths.

I describe this as a ""fusion"" kettlebell workout both because it is appropriate to be performed with a slightly lighter kettlebell (I'm talking 10 lbs., not 5 lbs.) and because many of the exercises are not unique to kettlebell work.  Unfortunately, however, Gin simply does not do a particularly good job with this DVD.  She gets the fundamental kettlebell exercise, the swing (her ""throw""), TOTALLY wrong.  Those who have experience with kettlebells like myself will be able to make their own adjustments, but beginners could risk trouble if they attempt to follow along with Gin.

If you are new to kettlebells and are looking for a fusion-type workout, I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Body-Kettlebell-Bootcamp-with-Angie-Miller/dp/B001GIJRP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Body: Kettlebell Bootcamp with Angie Miller</a>&nbsp;or perhaps one of the Paul Katami DVDs (which I haven't tried).  I will keep this DVD (for now), as I think I can modify the one workout I liked to meet my own needs.  Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it, and my final rating would be 2 1/2 stars.",1318118400,6,5372,5.1476355247981544
3663271,5,B001K3GO60,I've tried several kettlebell workouts and this is the one I keep coming back to.  I'm 60 years old and wanted a cardio/strengthening workout in one since I'm definitely not an exercise guru.  Gin Miller does an excellent job of teaching the proper method of kettlebelling.  I highly recommend this video for beginner and intermediate kettlebellers.,1310428800,,349,5.196428571428571
3663272,3,B001K3GO60,"I adore Gin Miller and have just about every DVD she has released. And for the most part, there is no finer fitness instructor on the planet. However, she misses the mark on this one. She does not demonstrate proper kettlebell form, which probably will not cause injury as long as you stick with a really light kettlebell. However, some of the moves as demonstrated could cause injury if a moderate or heavy kettlebell was used. I recommend sticking with DVDs with instructors who are certified in kettlebell instruction.",1304208000,2,521,4.865168539325842
3663273,5,B001K3GO60,"I did not intentionally buy this DVD. It came with my Danskin 10 lb kettlebell and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised the first time I did it. The more I have done it, the more in love I have become with this DVD and with Gin Miller's style. No, it's not fancy and there aren't any other kettlebellers in the background. But that's what I like about it. Her movements are slow and well taught. There's a proper warm up and a cool down and she emphasizes the need for both. There are three separate workouts. You can do one or all (I do all of them) but make sure you do the warm up and cool down with whatever workout(s) you choose. This DVD gives me an excellent cardio and strength training workout in one. My tush is tighter, my arms are firmer and I feel like a million bucks after finishing it! My only complaint is that it's her only kettlebell DVD!",1303776000,,859,4.180722891566265
3663274,5,B001K3GO60,I have always been a fan of Gin Miller and she delivered this video better than ever! She never missed a que with her inspiring and soothing tone. The background music had the right tempo which kept me motivated as she ramped up the sets. The exercises felt so good I wanted to do more when it came to the end.,1298505600,,310,4.098360655737705
3663275,2,B001K3GO60,"The instruction on this dvd doesn't make a lot of sense.  It seems to me the instructor was confused and not real sure of even how to use the kettlebell.  For example, she would call your hips ""knees"" instead of hips? And when she says, ""stretch to your right"" she would be stretching to the left?  Confusing for sure! Also, she has an annoying way of saying the word ""guys"" a little too much for my taste.  Watch at your own risk!",1293062400,2,431,4.219512195121951
3663276,5,B001K3GO60,This workout is a great introduction to kettlebells.  The moves are simple yet effective.  The workout is broken down into 3 parts but I completed all three at once the very first time doing the video and first time using kettlebells.  Miller explains the moves well and is a great instructor.  The music is nice too.,1290902400,,317,4.607142857142857
3663277,4,B001K3GO60,"If you are just starting to use Kettlebells, this is a good way to do it.  Gin uses a slower beat and streeses form and shows each move from 2 angles.  This is not for intermediate or advanced, but a great learning DVD for newcomers.  I highly recommend it.",1281916800,,257,4.204081632653061
3663278,5,B001K3GO60,I am very happy with my Gin Miller's workout DVD. I have been using it since I got it. It is a 45 min exercise and I am very happy with its content. I recommend it to anyone who is considering working with kettlebells.,1277856000,2,218,3.977272727272727
3663279,5,B001K3GO60,Worth the purchase - she demonstrates great technique and also explains why and what you are doing very well.  Not for the faint hearted a great sweaty workout.,1273968000,4,160,4.714285714285714
3663280,1,B001K3GO60,"I bought this as a kit with a 10# kettlebell and a DVD and a paper workout guide.
My objections to this program are not related to being a purist. They are about safe, appropriate exercise.
This video is an exercise video using a kettlebell but it is not a kettlebell workout, and it does NOT demonstrate proper technique nor are several of the exercises safe to do with a kettlebell lacking proper technique.
I gave this one star because kettlebells can be dangerous and, between the video's improper kettlebell technique, and the weird paper workout guide from Danskin (which has **terrible** demo pictures!!!), anyone trying to do these workouts is likely to either hurt themselves or be turned off by kettlebell work.

Kettlebells are amazing, and a great workout tool, and FUN to use when used correctly.
Find someone to teach you correct technique and then go back and watch this and see how bad her kb instruction is.
I recommend Lauren Brooks, Vince Choo, and Troy Anderson who have youtube videos on proper kettlebell technique.
Put this DVD in a microwave and make a coaster out of it. It is not suitable for learning kettlebell technique.",1265760000,18,1149,4.803030303030303
3663281,5,B001K3GO60,"I am new to kettlebell workouts, so as far as how this relates to others I have limited experience as I have only tried two other workouts-one being Iron Core, which came with my kettlebell and Amy Bento's absolute beginner series.  I felt this workout was a good one, and as with all of Gin Miller's dvd's she explains the move and in this dvd also shows a side view so you can see what she is demonstrating.

I have a 7 lb kettlebell and a 10lb that I can work up to later and I find her instruction concise and easy to follow.  I didn't see any glaring differences between her style from the other two I worked with, but again, I'm not an expert.

As an exerciser, I am fit and work out daily, but I do not do a lot of workouts with weights, so for me the 7 lb kettlebell worked for me.  I find her to be a good instructor with a great sense of humor who makes whatever workout she is instructing fun, and one I'm sure to keep in rotation.

This video runs 49 minutes with approx 7 minutes of warm-up, 37 minutes of toning and 5 minutes of cooldown. I would consider this to be an beginner/intermediate dvd.

For me this was a good addition to my workouts and one that I will continue to use weekly to help to tone my arms, glutes, hams, quads and get an overall cardio boost.",1263168000,9,1279,4.092
3663282,5,B001K3GO60,"Let me say before I make my first statement that I wound up having big love for this dvd and now do it often, but, like me, you may have misgivings when you first begin playing the dvd...so I wanted to address that first.

QUALITY: I was worried at first. Not only is she wearing one of those microphones like you'd see someone wearing doing a product demo in a department store (think of the black head mic that the ""Sham Wow!"" guy wears) that makes you hear even breathing rather than just speech, but it was filmed in a very sterile studio, and either the editing guy was lazy or they were playing tricks on the instructor during production. Here's what I mean: One of the nice things about this dvd is that, in order to ensure proper form, you are able to see the instructor from both front and side view during many shots where form is especially important. On those takes, the side view pops up on half of your screen. Nice, right? But, get this, during the first shot there are two columns in the right corner of the room behind her. Next shot there is one column. Next shot 2 columns and a pink ball. Next shot 2 columns, a pink ball, and something on top of the columns, next shot one column and half of the pink ball...and so on, and so on,...it got to be really funny. I thought at first maybe they shot this over several months and weren't careful with the props but then I realized, since something changed each time it popped up, maybe the editing person did it to mark his place of which side shot went where. I pick up on odd things like that so allow my observation to be your amusement as well. So it's not exactly high tech and there may be some lazy editing on the side shots, but don't let that stop you, this is ONE HECK OF A GREAT WORKOUT!

CALORIE BURN: Let me start by saying I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily caloric expenditure. It has settings to also allow me to measure exactly how many calories I burn during a specific workout, as well as how many calories I burn per minute during that workout, and how much my calorie burn is increased after the workout if it's a strength training workout (which ups your metabolism long after the workout is over.) so I'm able to compare all my dvds. This hit a high calorie burn early in the workout and offered a high calorie burn in comparison to most of my other fitness dvds, as well as a metabolism boost afterwards due to deep strength training mixed with the cardio in this dvd. I was impressed and I forgot all about the crazy moving props in the background rather quickly.

INSTRUCTION: She has great energy and excellent cueing so you'll be able to easily follow along. She discusses not just how to do each move, but how to do each move safely. It kept my attention span very well and never tripped me up.

EQUIPMENT: One kettlebell. Although there is always discussion about weight, I think the easiest guage is to think of what weight of handweight you use. If you use 2 5-lb handweights in other workouts, then you should be able to handle a 10-lb. kettlebell. Personally, I use a 6-7 lb handweight in each hand during other workouts and I'm comfortable with my 12-lb kettlebell. Although I did grunt a couple times, no lie. You are pushed. If you feel too pushed, do less reps or use a lighter weight. It's simple to make it ""your own"".

MUSCLES WORKED: This is what I loved about this workout and why it's one my friends keep borrowing from my fitness dvd library as well. She does moves that work your muscles down deep from your ears to your toenails. Okay, so you have no muscles there...I still think she reaches 'em. This is a solid workout that didn't drain me, but that I felt literally ALL over the next day...chest, abs, buns, arms, thighs...she found muscles to firm up in places I didn't know I had muscles. And that's why I bought the kettlebell, afterall. It provides a deeper and better workout then simply handweights alone. Her twists work your obliques for a great ab workout and this kept my heart rate up at a great pace for a cardio burn combined with strength training. It is, bottom line, effective.

LEVEL: Although a beginner could do this with a light kettlebell because it's easy to follow, even a body builder would get great toning with simply advancing their kettlebell weight as they progress. It's a full body workout.

MUSIC: Good music paced to the moves. Kept me motivated. The usual.

BOTTOM LINE: I have a very large library of fitness dvds and I only have 2 favorites for my kettlebell workouts. This is one. Ignore the black head mic that makes you hear everything and the crazy set with props that move, and you'll realize your calorie burn is through the roof along with the toning, yet you will follow along easily and get fast results because of good moves, energy, and instruction",1262563200,43,4813,4.418263810597519
3663283,5,B001K3GO60,"I'm being redundant, but I really enjoy and benefit greatly from this DVD. I have been working out over 25 years and am very picky. I'm no supergirl, though, and I always benefit from good teaching. This workout is meticulously planned, cued and taught. Gin Miller has been a fitness instructor for many years, and her manner of instruction is impeccable. You can stop after the warm-up or first, second, and third workouts if you so choose.  This option is excellent when you have to take a break. Gin is so friendly and professional you actually do feel you are in a one-on-one class with her. Her advice on which  kettlebell weights to use depending on your fitness is timely and helpful. Her advice on technique and form is on target and very clear. And the music!--Love it. It's very modern with unusual accents, like, for instance, in one segment, the sound of a church bell to the beat of the music. Also, this is not a workout for just women or just men.  There are no other participants in the DVD, so you don't get comments about looking good in a strapless dress if you do this workout. Bonus for you guys out there!  Buy this, people.

I use a 15 lb kettlebell a little advanced than most and it is very challenging.  If you are a beginner definitely use a 5 -8 lb kettlebell, then increase the weight once you're comfortable. The most important thing is to keep using good form.
The only discrepancy is the three workouts are not continuous you have to click on to the next once you finish one but it's not that big of a deal.",1259884800,7,525,4.25

My legs, butt and shoulders will feel this tomorrow for sure. I look forward to working up to doing the whole workout with a 10# kettleball.

3663287,1,B001K3GO60,I am new to kettlebell workouts and was excited to see that Gin Miller (who I have worked out with in the past) had a DVD. It is obvious that she did not do her research while producing this DVD. Many of the exercises could be done with dumbells and most make no sense. Gin should stick to step aerobics. My advice...don't buy this...keep looking...I will...there must be other workouts out there that are better!,1256774400,9,413,4.52
3663288,2,B001K3GO60,"When I heard that Gin was coming out with a workout, I had the highest expectations. A workout combining an instructor I love with a form of exerice I love. What could be better?

But I have to agree with the reviewer who said it looks like Gin just jumped on the KB bandwagon. Gin usually gives good form tips and safe exercises. This is NOT the case with this workout. Some moves are awkward, and some are an injury waiting to happen. Gin's form is also quite poor on some moves, even the basic swing.

Those with some experience in KB's, like myself, could modify some of the moves, and perform others with correct form, and there is a quite nice, effective standing under-the-leg pass move that is unique, but I found it wasn't worth the bother. I used it once, then put it on my Ebay pile.

Those who have no KB background would be well advised to stay clear, as they could risk injury.",1253404800,11,891,4.323353293413174

For starters, Gin does not demonstrate proper kettlebell form.  You could injure your back on her version of swings, and the way she does her snatches makes absolutely no sense.

I would recommend buying from Iron Core with Sara Laurie or Kettlebell Goddess with Andrea Du Kane. Both of these dvd's give you a true kettlebell workout, demonstrate proper form and are significantly harder.",1252800000,57,552,4.778947368421052

I like Gin's approach to instructing the use of the kettlebell you get front and side shots showing you the proper form.
The workout is smooth and strickly works with the kettlebell. The segments are at a nice pace. I would reccomend this DVD for anyone starting out.

The only issue I have with the workout is that over time and hopefully as I get better with the kettlebell the pace may be a bit slow to keep me interested. Time will tell.",1252627200,4,504,4.3052631578947365

This DVD is not kettlebell training at all and at times the exercises she invented are quite dangerous.  Do yourself a favor, skip this one, and get a kettlebell DVD that is made by an actual certified kettlebell trainer (RKC).  You will get better results and won't get hurt!",1249776000,11,386,4.731343283582089
3663292,5,B001K3GO60,"This is my second workout DVD from Gin Miller.  Gin is an amazing trainer.  She motivates you with her beautiful personality and sense of humor.  You actually feel as though she is right there with you, encouraging you.  The workout itself is very effective.  I feel that good kind of sore the next day, and it helps to improve those trouble spots - triceps and upper thighs.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about Gin and this DVD,  I highly recommend it!",1247529600,2,461,4.548780487804878

3663294,5,B001K3GO60,"This is one great tape!  I have not been this enthusiastic about an exercise dvd, well, ever.  She is that rare mix of good instruction, technique and personality.  She explains things thoroughly but not so much that you get tired of it after a few plays.  Plus, her prompts and encouragements make you feel that she is in the room with you.  This is my first Gin Miller dvd and just got on to look for more workouts.  I've been anxious to try kettlebells for a long time and found this a wonderful intro to the workout.  As a side note, I am fairly strong with a black belt in martial arts, but I found the 10 lb kettlebell challenging enough to begin with.",1244505600,6,658,4.258064516129032
3663295,5,B001K3GO60,This Workout is really good.  Everytime we finish 2 of the 15min workouts we're dripping sweat.  She walks you through the excercises and really does a good job.  Highly recommend!,1243468800,2,180,4.933333333333334
8314198,5,B001K3GO60,"I actually discovered this workout accidentally when I was staying in a friend's home for an extended time. I started doing the workout because it was handy and continued because it is good. Gin is engaging, and the workout is easy to follow. The way it is divided makes it easy to do parts of it instead of the entire thing, which means I can get some exercise in even if I'm on a tight schedule. Very much worth the money.",1516147200,,424,4.246913580246914

8314202,5,B001K3GO60,This is a fabulous kettlebell workout. I was familiar with Gin Miller because I bought the Empower kettlebell that you can customize with how heavy to make it (which I also highly recommend) and the dvd included with that one is Gin Miller too. I really like her personality and style. She is encouraging without being annoying. Plus she's a bit older so even though she's in great shape I don't feel like I'm looking at a some young thing jump all over the screen making me feel old! I've been doing this one and the other one each once a week for about 5 weeks now. I was also doing other workouts 3 days a week but I am switching to all kettlebells. I only wish Gin Miller did 3 other kettlebell dvds but as far as I've been able to find this and the Empower one are the only 2.,1421193600,4,781,4.144736842105263

Sure it hurts at first, but within 3 weeks I saw measurable body-shape changes. Kettlebells are the only exercise that removed my muffin top and kept it off!",1400284800,,286,4.627450980392157

She is very detailed and explains how to do each exercise.
Workouts are short and easy to use for a busy schedule.
I use mine every day.",1398038400,4,213,4.219512195121951
