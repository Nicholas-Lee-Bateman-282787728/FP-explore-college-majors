Also helps you sort our feelings, relate to biblical persons that suffered through trials and temptations just like you do, and to know that you are not alone in this world. God is always with you.",1484956800,,263,4.5

7793149,5,0849959977,"I actually happened on this series when Max did it in front of his congregation. I consider myself more of a spiritual person, than religious. Having said that, I need to explain a little about where I was when I was introduced to Max's  teaching. I was at probably the lowest point in my life. I had shattered my leg over a year earlier, lost my job, lived alone and was still in a wheelchair with so many complications, that it was going to take more surgeries and considerably more time to recover. I was literally pushed into watching one of his church services on TV by a friend. I was not happy about it. I had, and still have strong prejudices against ,"" TV Evangelist"". I happened to watch the first  part of this series. His humor and decidedly humble ""story telling""  and sharing, did not strike me as ""preaching"" but as truly caring. This series was EXACTLY what I needed at that time. I can't recommend it enough to anyone who is struggling, hates being ""Preached"" to, and can not see how listening to someone like MAX LUCADO is going to help them one little bit. Living less than ten miles from his church in San Antonio, I had never felt like attending. I still don't attend regularly. But I have to tell others about this particular series. It introduced me to a man and his congregation, that I was sure didn't exist. NO JUDGING, NO CONDESCENSION, None of the things I had previously experienced in some Churches. I have the book, but if you have never heard Max speak, I highly recommend this DVD. There is nothing quite like listening to Max at least once, so that you can hear the laughter and humility in his voice.",1404604800,3,1635,4.443333333333333
7793150,5,0849959977,Max Lucado has such a wonderful way of taking a complex and sensitive issues and presenting them in a simple and straight forward fashion.  His points are consistently right on target.  I have watched it more than once in the very short time I have had it.,1404259200,,256,4.425531914893617
7793151,5,0849959977,It is a practical spiritual theologically sound picture of the the sovereignty of God in our lives if we will trust Him.,1398470400,,120,4.5
7793152,4,0849959977,"This is the first DVD I have seen by Max Lucado.  I have enjoyed reading some of his earlier books.  I love to just listen to his soothing words.  He sounds like he is talking to me directly.  The only problem I have with this DVD is the one woman who keeps nodding her head to everything he says.  I realize that she appreciates what he is saying, but her head nodding is a bit of a distraction.  So, after the first session, I listen without looking.  It works much better this way.",1383264000,2,484,4.139784946236559
