3151999,5,B001659HDE,"Sitting Bull was a truly great chief.  Again, it's hard to beleive that the white people were so cruel and inhumane.  Too bad this isn't shown more often.

3152000,5,B001659HDE,"A documentary for those who prefer to think and feel for  themselves free of annoying talking heads breaking the spell the film maker weaves to allow you to get into the heart of the man Sitting Bull not some myth or sanitized view of who he was. Sitting Bull comes to life through film maker John Ferry's  skillful use of  historical photos, the voice of Fortunate Eagle as Sitting Bull and narration by William Theobald. A must see for anyone who loves historical accuracy. Sitting Bull felt a stone in his heart and by the time the film ends you also feel it, his loves, and his sense of humor. A must see.",1247788800,11,609,4.371681415929204
3152001,5,B001659HDE,"Having always been interested in Native American History this is the best documentary I've seen on Sitting Bull, and I think I've seen them all.  It's educational in its historical accuracy but it also entertains.  I've never seen a movie, whether from Hollywood or in a documentary, that shows the lighter and human side of Sitting Bull, along with the sadness and tragedy. I liked that this film doesn't use shots of people commenting on camera.  This movie moves so well as it tells the story of Sitting Bull that it doesn't need that.  My only criticism is that even though the massacre at Wounded Knee took place two weeks after Sitting Bull's murder I wish the film had dealt with it more.  All things considered this is an awesome movie.",1235692800,13,744,4.648854961832061

8260957,3,B001659HDE,"With a small bit of American Indian heritage in my bloodline, I have a passion for the history of all of America's Indian tribes and their losses at the hands of the American's and the U.S. government as the U.S. developed and took over the Indian's native lands.  Too many lies, i.e., treaties, unkept by the U.S. government to get the Indians out of the way of expansion without equal conviction to enable the abe the Indian to maintain their traditions, lifestyle, and a permanent portion of some of the most scenic and beautiful land this country has to offer rather than to relegate the Indian to reservations with the least productive land in the west and the inability to live their lives by tradition rather than being compelled to change to the ""white"" man's way of life.  SAD!!!!  I read about this whenever possible and intend to watch any documentaries about other great chief's who struggled to look out for their people as they were being pushed aside.  A favorite story of mine tells the life journey and final major struggle for Chief Joseph to save his people.  A very compelling and sad story for the U.S. government and how they mishandled all of this.",1470009600,,1171,4.665048543689321

8260960,5,B001659HDE,"A true warrior fighting to the end to preserve his people and their customs and traditions.  Even with the ordered genocide, which by the way made Hitler look like an amateur, Native Americans have survived and many have gone on to rekindle their traditions and languages.  I truly admire their fortitude and dedication to family and ancestors.  Love is one thing we can't kill!",1454889600,4,378,4.875

8260962,5,B001659HDE,This DVD is extremely well done.  Anyone interested in Sitting Bull and the story of the Lakota should really get this.  This nations treatment of all the Native American tribes is beyond shameful.  The government did all it could to annihilate those people.  Shameful.  Visit the reservations today and see the pitiful existence of those humans.  Many thanks to Mr. Adam Fortunate Eagle and all those who participated in this master piece.,1414800000,3,440,5.041666666666667
8260963,5,B001659HDE,An outstanding movie incredible....very profound sensitivity of actual events and very informative details of what the LAKOTA Sioux and other Native American tribes endured and how they were robbed of their true selves thier beliefs custom language culture and traditions so many people are in the dark to the truth this is a great insight for true events of very respectable people who were the original desendents of our soil also known as TURTLE ISLAND  a eye opener for the ones who have no clue to wat endurance suffrage and sacrifice really is! To walk the RED ROAD IS A JOURNEY NOT MANY CAN HANDLE A WHOLE NEW MEANING TO LIFE AND BEING IN TOUCH WITH OURSELVES AND RESPECT FOR OUR HISTORY AND KNOWLEDGE OF OUR COUNTRY,1413676800,3,723,4.692913385826771
