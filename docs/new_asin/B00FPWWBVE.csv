6019873,5,B00FPWWBVE,"Another Great Multi-Pack from Mill Creek Entertainment!  I really enjoy most of the products from Mill Creek Entertainment.  And this one is no exception!  Like most Multi-Packs, you will get movies that either you already have and/or are in public domain.  While this is no exception, this does have enough movies that haven't made the rounds to keep me interested.
Here are the list of Movies this one has:
  1) Pandemic Part 1
  2) Pandemic Part 2
  3) Silent Preditors
  4) Bone Daddy
  5) Horror Of the Zombies
  6) Oasis Of The Zombies
  7) Revolt Of The Zombies
  8) Nabonga
  9) Teenage Zombies
  10) Bloodtide
  11) Creature From The Haunted Sea
  12) Dementia 13
  13) The Galaxy Invader
  14) Cosmos: War of the Planets
  15) The Little Shop of Horrors
  16) Snowbeast
  17) Tormented
  18) House on Haunted Hill
  19) Night of the Living Dead
  20) The Devil Bat
  While I have almost half of these on other Mill Creek Entertainment edtions, they have enough here to keep me interested.  And I do like the slimline type packaging they have started using in their multi-packs the last couple of years.  So it saves me space.  This Midnight Madness movie collection is a great one to have around",1401235200,105,1205,4.5893719806763285

8617849,5,B00FPWWBVE,"I mainly got this DVD for ""Galaxy Invader"", Don Dohler's (RIP) classic that is difficult to find. There are several genuinely good movies that could make this DVD worth the buy for you if you don't have them already, such as ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""House on Haunted Hill"", and ""The Little Shop of Horrors."" ""Dementia 13"", an early Francis Ford Coppola movie and collaboration with Roger Corman, is solid in that it showcases Coppola's film-making chops while still indulging in low-budget blood and gore. The other movies in this set are hit-and-miss. Some feature bad acting, some feature very good acting from the likes of James Earl Jones and Rutger Hauer. Snow Beast is another hidden gem, showcasing the writing talents of Joseph Stefano, who wrote the ""Psycho"" screenplay.  Cosmos: War of The Planets is an Italian remake of another Italian film, Planet of the Vampires (dir. Mario Bava), which is a classic, however this film is so terrible it's hilarious.",1499212800,3,968,4.938650306748467

8617854,4,B00FPWWBVE,"I could not get ""Pandemic 2"" to play. It reverts to the mid-point of ""Pandemic 1""... otherwise it has been fun to watch.",1479168000,3,120,4.260869565217392
