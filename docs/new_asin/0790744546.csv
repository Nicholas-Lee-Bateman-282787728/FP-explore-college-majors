117358,5,0790744546,"Diner is one of the best films I have seen and it is no wonder that I fell in love with this film back in the 80's. Released at a time when most buddy movies involved sex, fart jokes and bad dialogue Diner stood out by  showcasing the talents of some of Hollywoods best young actors. Set in  Baltimore, Diner is the story of a group of life long friends who have  survived High School and went on to get married, or go off to College. They  all face the realities of life we see ourselves and like good friends offer  comfort and support. Even when one or more of them finds themselves stuck  in a cross road there was always the Diner, that friendly Cafe that was  open all night where a group of guys could just hang out and talk guy talk.  Diner was that little film that stood out and became minor classic among  films. Barry Levinson would go on to make other films but this is still his  best. Easliy one of my most watched videos, thankfully my DVD copy has  taken the place of my well worn out VHS tape",960076800,7,1010,4.128205128205129
117359,4,0790744546,"This hilarious piece of nostalgia is a classic to me. A group of buddies tie up ends to their childhood and enter adulthood in the late 50's. Stars Daniel Sterns, Kevin Bacon, Paul Reiser, Ellen Barkin and many more.",958262400,,216,4.564102564102564
117360,5,0790744546,This is a good movie about young men growing up in the 50's. It has some of the best writing I have seen in a film and it features many of today's stars when their careeers were just beginning.,955929600,4,193,3.9743589743589745
117361,4,0790744546,"Diner is the first of four(thus far) Baltimore films that Barry Levinson has made and its the kind of film that you can watch over and over again leaving you with a ridiculous looking smile on your face.
  There is a  scene in Diner that summarises why the movie so wonderful and familiar.  Eddie(Steve Guttenberg) has a friend over he hasn't seen in a long time,  Billie. He wakes up around noon, goes into the kitchen and asks his mother  for a sandwich. She then runs around the kitchen and jokingly pretends that  she wants to stab him. After finally agreeing to make him the sandwich she  then kneels over to Billie(the quiet, polite friend) and says ""Billie,  do you want anything?Its no trouble."" Doesn't everyone have a friend  like that, the one your mother like because he's so polite, the one she  wishes you were more like. The half joking/half real complaint of the  mother about her son expressed in her light hearted insults is something  that rings a bell with just about anyone who has a mother. Its a lovely  scene.
  Elsewhere the film is seperated into episodes where these  friends get togather and talk and talk. You want to spend time with these  guys, because they represent everybody's friends.
  The main theme in the  film is why these young men can blow the whole night away talking about  whatever comes to mind (Mostly they decide which girl is ""Death"")  and their lack of communication with women. A theme which climaxes with a  terrific scene between Shrevie (Daniel Stern) and his wife Beth (Ellen  Barkin) when he completely loses his temper because she had messed with the  arrangement of his records. Eddie on the other hand insists that his fiance  pass a football test before they get married, and Billie has tough time  comprehending why a girl he slept with doesn't want to marry him or even go  out with him.
  There are other interesting side-stories like  Fenwick's(Kevin Bacon) hostile relationship with his brother, and his  untapped intelligence. There is Boogie's gambling problems and his cinema  bet which I would never reveal here except to say that it leads to  hilarious scene at the back of the cinema.
  Thankfully none of these  stories are taken to any melodramatic ends, with all problems kept at a  safe realistic distance. As a result some of the guys appear to be  caricatures like rebel, womaniser, virgin (never reveal which one) and  there are no real revelations in the end. But then again we don't want any  of that because we really like these guys and really enjoy their company.  This film gives dignity to the term ""FEEL GOOD MOVIE"". Just don't  let anyone see that silly smile after the film.",954892800,6,2662,4.705882352941177
117362,5,0790744546,"The locale, situations and dialogue are some of the best in a movie.  The fact that it takes place in Baltimore enhances its attraction to me since I live in one of the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC.  The exchange  between Steve Guttenberg and his mom in the film is great.",940636800,4,278,4.411764705882353
117363,5,0790744546,"Whether you're from Baltimore or from a suburb outside of New York as I am; whether you grew up in the 50s or the 70s as I did, this film will make you feel right at home. Very few movies can take the most mundane, the most ridiculously trivial moments and conversation from real life and make them interesting never mind howlingly funny. Diner succeeds in this and more. We know these guys: their sophomoric antics, their idiosyncrasies, their loyalties to best friends and their uneasy transition into the adult responsibilities of money, work, and marriage.
The scenes at the diner are deceptively complex in that Levinson has several characters speaking at the same time and yet we can follow the dialogue with no difficulty. The conversation, physical reactions and interplay between characters is so natural as to seem completely unrehearsed and unedited. It's almost as if we are at the next table eavesdropping on the fun.
The cast in Diner was rightfully recognized as a superb group of players and everyone from Daniel Stern to Kevin Bacon to Ellen Barkin has done prolific work since then.
I heartily recommend you watch Diner with your best friends and then go out for a meal afterwards. Whether you choose to order french fries and gravy is up to you.",929059200,60,1264,4.802752293577981
117364,5,0790744546,"I grew up in the 70s but could relate wholeheartedly with the story. This movie works on a multitude of facets.

117366,5,0790744546,"Too many witless ""coming of age"" movies were produced during the eighties, but this really was something special. A true ensemble performance of great intelligence and marvellous, often melanchony humour.  Barely aline is wasted and as with every one of the finest movies, you  sense that all the participants know that they taking part in something  special. There is also a wonderful sense of period and it is a pity that  Barry Levinson's work since (excpet perhaps for TV's Homicide) has rarely  hit such heights A classic which, rarely for me, I have watched on a number  of occasions.",918432000,,590,4.909090909090909

117372,5,0790744546,"Diner was unlike any movie of its day, driven by banter and ordinary events with not a lot of plot.  The saving grace is the great dialog in spots, all star cast, and loving shots of Baltimore. It many ways it is the progenitor to Seinfeld.  I've watched it at least 10 times and still enjoy it.",1486166400,2,295,4.157894736842105
117373,5,0790744546,"My advice to young men out there is to show this classic guy film to your girlfriend and if she sits through the entire film, laughs and enjoys the story THEN MARRY THAT GIRL because you have found Mrs. Right and you will live happily ever after.

If the girl is offended, thinks the film is ""sexist"", won't sit though it and watch it with you, or isn't willing to accept the story line as being legit---- THEN DUMP THAT GIRL because she will ruin your life.

117374,4,0790744546,"Hey, around my way, around my growing up working class neighborhood out in Riverdale about forty miles west of Boston in the early 1960s they called them, we called ourselves, corner boys (which would be immortalized in Bruce Springsteens song, Jersey Girl, with the line. aint got no time for corner boys down in the street making all that noise and that was the truth-the making all that noise part). Corner boys: those without much dough, those without a weekend date and no money for a weekend date even if a guy got lucky enough to draw some female companionship, someone who didn't care about a boss car to sit up front in and would accept the bus as a mode of transportation and thus seldom lucky, hung around blessed Tonios Pizza Parlor up the Down (the corner of Adams and Jefferson Streets) and, well, hung out. Hung out trying to do the best we could and if defeated then there was always a couple of slices of Tonios secret formula pizza sauce to die for delight and a small Coke. Hung around in late high school planning larcenies great and small (great the theft of some young womans virtue, small the midnight creeps through back doors but maybe no more should be mentioned since perhaps the statute of limitations has not run out.

So when I saw the film under review, Diner, with a cast of up and coming actors who all went on to other films and saw that they were six guys, count em six, who in 1959 in the great city of Baltimore hung around a diner talking the talk in between bites of French fries and gravy (our pizza slices) I knew that they were kindred spirits. Knew that despite the several years different in time since they were all twenty-something gathering together for a wedding of one of their members around Christmas time they were from the same species. And as the film unwound that proved to be the case.

Heres the plot. Wait a minute while this the place where I usually give a few lines of summary about what was what in the film this one is not driven by a plot but by the slice of life scenes of a bunch of guys who still have some growing up to do. Scenes such as one guy fake smashing up his car complete with a ketchup injury just to fake his fellows out; the classic trying to cope a feel from the best looking ice queen in town at the movies (moves I have to confess are more seemly among the middle schoolers today and even my corner boys would sneer at a guy who was into that silliness at twenty-something); guys getting into dough trouble with the constant need to bet on any and all propositions (our most famous one which I lost and am still ticked off about that I even made the bet was how high Tonio could throw the pizza dough in making the crust); guys with girl trouble from the dreaded pregnancy problem in a pre-Pill world, marriage issues (which we were too young to worry about in high school the high tide of my particular corner boy existence); and the endless discussions about sports (here a guy quizzed his fiance on football before he decide he could marry her-ouch!), girls, life on the edge, the future and double-down on girls.

Yes that all looked very, very familiar to these old eyes. The difference? These guys stuck together well into their twenties. By twenty most of my guys were in the military, married, in jail, or on the run. The fate of plenty of real life corner boys making all that noise. See this one.",1483142400,,3389,4.393312101910828

117389,1,0790744546,"It was so painful to watch! I wanted to see some of my favorite actors, whilst they were young/wild/developing...

My issues aren't with the acting but with the: story, editing, and lack of appropriate music/soundtrack. It's like the opposite of Purple Rain. There's ""no"" follow through wlth any story line.

SPOILER!  Mickey doesn't sleep with the friend's girl. The ""close call"" moment was miles too far. You never get to see Guttenberg's fianc... There are innumerous examples of the missed opportunities to develop even an ""ok"" sedate film.  This movie was shot in a bubble and was meant to showcase the actors, but there was no meat on the bone. I wish there was that really powerful moment (sad/intense/surprising/wild). but I promise that you will only be tranquilized. Wishing for it to end will be the only hope you'll have.

Positives? I wish I was working and didn't give 100% attention to it. Then it might be positively forgettable,",1466812800,,945,4.918238993710692
117390,5,0790744546,"One of my favorite TOP TEN movies. I watch it a couple of times a few times a year, especially over the holidays because the story begins on Christmas night and ends on New Year's Eve, and I never tire of it.
In ""Diner"", Barry Levinson created a comedic masterpiece. The story takes i place in 1959 Baltimore and one must allow for accepted gender roles of the time. It's an older coming-of-age plot about a group of young chums who are about 20 years old, making their way to adulthood, spending their late nights and early morning hours with each other in their safe place --- the diner. The story revolves around one of them who has tentative plans to marry on New Years Eve, and his antics to give his cold feet a pass to cop out gracefully. The viewer gets to know each personality through alternating bits of bravado and vulnerability. And the comedy ranges between ""nuance"" and hilarity.
The cast is amazing, mostly unknowns in 1982 when the film was made, and it served as a launching pad for most of the actors, Mickey Rourke, Ellen Barkin, Steve Gutenberg, Paul Reiser, and Kevin Bacon among them.
I would recommend it for anyone who wants to see an exceptionally well done production of a very funny story.",1466726400,,1217,4.536363636363636

117392,5,0790744546,"Dialogue is sharp and funny.  Young Mickey Rourke is the coolest.  This is the first of what I consider the great Rourke trifecta (""Diner"", ""Rumblefish"", ""Pope of Greenwich Village"") in which he pretty much establishes himself as the young leading man to beat for first half of 80s.  Whether he delivers on that promise of course is another story.  Soundtrack is great 50s rock n roll.  One of the better ""I Vitelloni""- boys to men- coming of age etc films.  Great cast of young up and comers and character actor types.

It is one of the films I return to at different times. Because, as a favorite film professor always said, when a student would complain about having to watch a movie he/she had seen before, the movie hasn't changed, but you have.

117429,5,0790744546,"Diner is essentially a movie about nothing. It is a plotless, hardly structured film that has no specific intention. It also just so happens to be one of the greatest coming of age films ever made. Director Barry Levinson romanticized his adolescence and growing up in Baltimore in the late 1950's (59 in the movie) to create this love letter to his home city.

The cast of this movie is just perfect. A group of young actor's who hadn't all quite made a name for themselves yet (some of them well on their way). Just getting together, bonding in a very natural way you would expect a bunch of young guys to do so. Each of these actors went on to do at least 1 memorable movie in their careers not long after, Kevin Bacon (Footloose), Mickey Rourke (Pope of Greenwich Village), Steve Guttenberg (Short Circuit), Paul Reiser (Aliens) and Daniel Stern (Home Alone).

For me this is the kind of movie that I could pretty much just put on anytime (particularly on a sleepless night). The comradery of the characters in this film makes you feel like these are people you may have once known or at least wanted to know at one point in your own life. That the whole movie revolves around the 'Diner' is a testament to the fact that, everyone had ""that"" hangout spot growing up. For Barry Levinson living in Baltimore it was the diner.

This movie made such an impact on me as a teenager that I actually made my wife take a pop culture test before I would marry her (true story). Because the movie doesn't have the standard ""Setup, Conflict, Resolution"", there is nothing to rush. The movie plays at it's own pace and when it ends you want to play it again.",1426982400,2,1649,4.453642384105961

They actually BET on whether he can go any 'further'. Just awful.

The scene when one of their fiance's is given a 'test' on her football knowledge was demeaning and humiliating-is that supposed to be funny too? The women are treated as nothing more than objects for the most part. These guys are total jerks. I don't see anything 'nostalgic' about it.

117466,4,0790744546,"The film that launched successful careers for Kevin Bacon, Ellen Barkin, Paul Reiser, Mickey Rourke and more set in the northwest section of Baltimore, Maryland, during the last week of 1959, DINER tells the story of a circle of male friends - now in their early twenties - who reunite for the wedding of one of their group.

The title refers to the Hilltop Diner that was located at Reisterstown Road and Rogers Avenue, Baltimore, their late-night hangout. However, the Hilltop had been converted into a liquor store, so the location in the film is in the Canton section of Baltimore. An element of the story includes the Baltimore Colts winning the 1959 NFL Championship Game. The semi-autobiographical film explores the changing relationships among these friends as they become adults through what is mostly a series of vignettes rather than a traditional narrative. Levinson encouraged improvisation among his cast to capture realistic camaraderie.

This comedy flick also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was 9 years old in the 3rd grade during its theatrical release in the Spring of 1982 and when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was the President.",1393200000,,1241,4.904761904761905

It was just hard to care about any of these characters, what they thought, or what personal problems they were struggling with.  It often seemed like both the actors and the characters they played were scratching and clawing to be the center of attention.

As a younger guy myself, I can relate to the plot of this movie, even though it takes place in a much earlier time period than when I grew up, I can see alot of similarities to me and my guy buddies when we were in our early to mid-20's...it is a good portrayal of those random years in your 20's when you are between school years and family years and life can be a bit crazy.  This is a great movie to pop in and crack a few beers with when you have a few of the guys over...and even better, it is yet another movie you can use to tie back to Kevin Bacon if you ever find yourself playing that game.",1384387200,,983,3.905

Rachel: Oh, you're not having fun, are you?

Michael: No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie *Diner* in my head.

Well, as it turns out, I'm sure Michael would have had more fun had he just listened to Rachel whine away about Ross and Julie and their cat. I mean, this movie is awful. No: AWFUL. As in, mind-numbingly boring. It has no plot, every single character is a pathetic loser, and nothing of any interest ever happens. You'd think with Paul Reiser, Kevin Bacon, and Mickey Rourke among the cast, pretty much any script would result in a decent film. Tell you what: *Diner* is a counterexample. Stay away.

117476,4,0790744546,"For anyone coming of age in the 1950s through the 1970s ""Diner"" will bring back lots of memories. And for anyone who's lived in Baltimore (as I did for four years in the late 60s and early 70s), the memories will be intensified. However, one doesn't have to fall into either of these categories to appreciate ""Diner,"" for in its own way it is truly timeless. For whatever reason, men in particular (or at least many of us) have a particularly difficult time accepting the fact that we are grown up. Some of us accept this reality in our early twenties, others, like the main characters in this movie, are still dealing with the issue as they approach age 30, and others still never grow up.

""Diner"" well captures that time of life when we are torn between hanging out with the guys (in the diner or wherever) and accepting our work and familial responsibilities. Although the movie is admittedly not profound and its storyline is rather thin, it is both funny (at times) and poignant, as we see each of this ""band of brothers"" working through their confrontation with adulthood and the real world.

(One of my favorite scenes in the movie is where one of the guys orders the entire right side of the diner's menu. I can empathize. I wound up doing that once when stranded in a springtime blizzard in Sloan, IA, long before they built a casino in that town, and the only open eating establishment was a diner that served portions that were hardly sufficient for a hearty appetite.)

All in all, ""Diner"" is a fine movie for an evening when all you want to do is lay back in your recliner and be entertained.",1381881600,2,1606,4.512027491408935
117477,3,0790744546,"""A simple story about a group of late 20-something year old men going to a diner and dealing with their growing adult lives is what you need to know about the Barry Levinson time-conscious cult classic, Diner. As a whole, I seen this film with a more open lens than I did with American Graffiti and The Last Picture Show which those two are quite similar in themes, tone, and atmosphere as those two films.

However, unlike those two films, Diner just did not connect as much as it could have with it altogether having a rather loose narrative and a story that will eventually come but I could not relate to that much and its presentation, whilst similar, just was not that exciting for the 110-minute duration. Comical at parts when we witness our quintet of whippersnappers chat about random things whilst eating some good greasy grub and watching a fellow patron eat a lot of food at a Baltimore diner. Dramatic parts when we witness the quintet watch one of their friends have their wedding and much of it is without dialogue (could be tearful for some) or when Mickey Rourke's character, whom is the best and most memorable one along with Kevin Bacon, having to deal with his landlord after a physical confrontation near a beauty salon (that was a little tough to watch though because it can happen).

While those sound like positive things, they were the only redeeming things I could get from the whole thing added to that some of the realism of the whole narrative. It could have turned a cliche eye but it did not and I congratulate Mr. Levinson for doing that but this film just was not for me.

Comparing this film to the two others, Peter Bogdanovich's magnum opus The Last Picture Show stood out as the best one because it was the first one I've seen out of these coming-of-age dramas (or comedies if some call it that) and that was still a little perplexing for me in places.

His Baltimore Trilogy (Diner, Tin Men, Liberty Heights, and also throw in Avalon) are an ode to ""Charm City"" and presented a more nostalgic and innocent version of the city in the 50s and 60s vs. the harsh reality of The Wire and Homicide that came later in the 90s and 2000s(though they were terrific HBO shows in their own right).

117513,4,0790744546,"""Diner"" is one of those pictures that has a bunch of unknown performers who would go on to achieve fame in show business.  There is Mickey Rourke, Ellen Barkin, Steve Guttenberg, Kevin Bacon, Daniel Stern, and Paul Reiser.  All of them relatively unknown at the time ""Diner"" was released.

The story is a coming-of-age tale about six long-time buddies who are at that tricky stage in their lives when they must go from carefree youths to responsibility-laden adults.  The story is set in Baltimore, Maryland around 1960 and sports ... in particular the Baltimore Colts of the NFL ... play a big part in the film.  The boys meet regularly ... late at night ... at the local diner ... as they have for years, and the diner is sort-of the focal point of the movie.

Eddie (Steve Guttenberg) is getting married, and the movie goes along with that wedding as its conclusion, but there are many adolescent-type adventures (and troubles) along the way, and we, the audience, are treated to a lot of laughs (""He punched out the wise men."")

If you wonder who ... of these future stars ... does the best job acting, it is not, as you might think, Mickey Rourke.  Mickey does good ""Look at me."" work, but for the purists who appreciate true-to-life acting, the winner here is ... Daniel Stern.  He outclasses his distinguished colleagues in the subtleness of his performace and the depth and thoroughness of his characterization.  I love these types of performances.  Kevin bacon is good too as Timothy ... the borderline psycho.  Ellen Barkin is very good, but, for some reason, she always gives me the creeps.  Steve Guttenberg, oddly, gets top billing in the movie.  But even the small parts are filled with quality performances.

But ""Diner"" is mostly a guy movie, though it is enjoyable for everyone.  It doesn't make any earth-shaking statements, and it I doubt it's on many critics best ten list, but it touches something deep in us and is perhaps a classic in and of itself.",1291161600,3,1972,4.705539358600583

117515,3,0790744546,"The Bottom Line:

Another one of those movies that coasts on nostalgia and the (supposed) likability of its cast, Diner is not a terribly good movie--it moves quickly enough and some of the characters' storylines are fun, but it's far from the classic that many people think it is.",1233446400,3,281,4.73469387755102
117526,4,0790744546,"This film is unique in that all the components came together so well for a very good movie that ages very, very well.  The script although a lot of improvisation was going on is very good too and add a great cast you get a very good nostalgia type film that together with ""American Grafitti"" from which this film is obviously inspired rank among the best of this particular type of film genre.  Anyone who has ever had a group of good friends in school or college can relate to this film which is a fine example also of the guy/male bonding flick the opposite of which is the chick flick.  I found I could relate to the characters portrayed so well here by the excellent cast and I could see bits and pieces of the different personalities represented in my friends at school and/or college.  For me the Diner was Denny's at Waikiki Honolulu in college and a McDonald's at Orchard Road in my high school equivalent.  Fond memories indeed and even now some of us who have reconnected still try to meet up from time to time to talk about the good old days.

This dvd version although not bad can still be improved with a restored picture quality enhanced in an anamorphic widescreen version instead of the matted version here.  The sound quality could also be remastered with at least a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound Option instead of the Mono that we get here.  The Special Features are pretty good with excellent interviews with the director and cast.

A very good film that represents the nostalgia genre well and if you liked ""American Grafitti"", you should like this too.  I'd like to see a Director's Cut version with improved sound and picture quality released either in the Standard or Blu-Ray format but this dvd version is pretty good as is.

117527,5,0790744546,"Diner, Barry Levinson's writing and directing debut belongs to so-called ""small"" or ""minor"" movies and it indeed does not have spectacular locations, breathtaking action sequences or even dramatic story. As Kevin Bacon comments in the Behind the Scenes Documentary, ""There's not that much of a story, really. What do we do? We drive around..."" What the movie has is ""a very honest portrayal of a group...of guys that people relate to on a very personal level."" The different generations of viewers react to film with devotion and recognition, and Diner has become one of the beloved long time cult favorites. Based on its writer/director's memories of growing up in Baltimore, the film takes place during the week between Christmas and New Year in 1959, and tells of the friendship of five guys in their early twenties. During the course of the film, we will get to know the young men, their fears of growing up, facing responsibilities, and making decisions, their fascination and insecurities with the girls.

From his Oscar-nominated script, BL makes the study of young men who hesitate to grow up but rather hang out in their beloved Diner. Daniel Stern's 'Shrevie' is an owner of LP collection that he seems to value more than his young and pretty wife (Ellen Barkin in her film debut). Mickey Rourke, played his best role (at least, IMO) as Boogy, the cynical womanizer with the most charming smile. Steve Guttenberg's Eddie puts his fiance through the enormously difficult football quiz and the passing score is the must for the marriage because he is scared to get married. Kevin Bacon plays Fenwick, a permanently drunk and lost kid, the character much darker than the rest of the guys. Timothy Daly is Bill who seems to be the most successful of the bunch, and know what he wants but can't make the girl he loves to love him. By making Diner, Levinson actually put his native city, sleepy and provincial 1959 Baltimore, on the cinema map, and that's just one of movie's pleasures. And there are plenty. Diner is filled with authentic and believable scenes, situations, and conversations that everyone can relate to. The Diner's menu has a lot to offer to the grateful viewers and fans of the insightful, ironic, entertaining, small but bright and shiny gem. Barry Levinson does not flatter six protagonists but he understands them and loves them because he sees in them the indelible part of his own life, his experiences, and his own childhood friends. As another great film about childhood friendship says, ""I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?""

Barry Levinson went on to create many good and very good films after Diner. These are just a few: The Natural, Good Morning, Vietnam; Bugsy; Avalon; Sleepers, An Everlasting Piece, Disclosure, Wag the Dog, and his Oscar winner ""Rain Man"" but Diner will always have a very special place for me. This is the film I keep coming back to again and again, and as the time passes it only gets better.",1221609600,,3007,4.81431334622824
117528,5,0790744546,"This is a film about a bunch of guys on the threshold of adulthood, set in 1950's Baltimore.  I'm not a guy, have never been to Baltimore and don't have much in common with any of them.  But I loved the film!  As Barry Levinson, the director, says in the added feature, when you are really specific to time, place and character, the appeal is universal.  He did a great job in making this film and one can feel the affection he has for the town and that time in his life.

Each fellow has some serious life problem to confront, many of which involve relationships with women.  It's not just a fluff, teen age movie--the situations are genuine and have consequences.  But the good nature of the guys--maybe the fact that they are still at the age where life can be a blast--makes the film really funny.

It was fun for me to see the cast--many of whom are now very well known, when they were young and starting out.  Kevin Bacon's performance was a real surprise--I thought he was terrific as a rather complex, self destructive guy.  Micky Rourke started out as someone rather loathesome but he turned out to be a heart-warmer.  His hairdo is worth the price of the DVD.  Timothy Daly, really good looking, is the token sensitive guy.  Ellen Barkin does a lovely job as the lone female in the group.  Steve Guttenberg is the spoiled kid you want to swat but has something lovable about him too.  Paul Reiser is always the smart talking funny guy.

I suppose I could take offense at the way they ""objectify"" women...but it's all done with so much warmth and humor that it was easy to just sit back and laugh.  The film reminded me some of American Graffiti but I liked this much better.",1204156800,,1684,4.415584415584416

All the stars-to-be,Mickey Rourke, Steve Guttenburg, Daniel Stern, Kevin Bacon and Ellen Barkin play small-time characters with brilliant conviction. At the diner, the gang collects to dream, boast,gamble and connive their way into the human race. All the pranks, risks, deceptions kids can conceive of, they individually try to pull off, in order to convince themselves that their adolescence will remain forever. Some dreams are achieved, others fall short, but this town clique changes in the end. Special recognition should be spent on the sensitive character that Ellen Barkin plays. As a less-than-gorgeous beautician with ambitions and under-rated, she is ""set-up"" as a gag. When things do not entertain, only hurt her, the way Mickey Rourke recovers his decency to reach out to Ellen is a very special moment. Small towns did that. Cities are less forgiving. Unpredictable, quirky, childish but ultimately exhilarating are the reactions to this nostalgic gem.

117533,5,0790744546,"I have some older friends that love the Brat Pack movies because they came of age in the 80s when they were popular. I however came of age in the early 90s, and though I've seen the movies I can't fathom why the Breakfast Club is so great. Diner is a different story.  I loved this movie. And of the 80s movies, I think it's one of the most underrated when we look back on that great decade of big hair, Reagan, and movie flicks that are of the period. Of course, I never liked or could understand why Reagan was so great either. But back to Diner, for someone like Kevin Bacon who has gone on to fame with Mystic River and other movies, Paul Reiser of Mad About You and Daniel Stern of the Wonder Years to name a few, its interesting to see where they came from. Even more, while the Brat Pack members of Breakfast Club type movies, with the exception of Demi Moore and Emilo Estevez all burned out, the fact that the Diner actors still shine brightly,by contrast,if sporadically, I think says alot about the film itself  and the acting. Tim Daly of Wings and Paul Reiser of Mad About You in 90s tv are really recent when you get right down to it. Again, the acting is great, the plots like the dick in the popcorn or the football quiz are wonderful insights into how guys think. And I like them even more as this cuts to the stereotype of being a guy but the movie itself is more of a thinking man's guy flick. I think that's why I like it. As I'm a thinking man. Exchanging football for History, I could see myself as an Eddie character ,and for a time and indeed sometimes now, I classify stuff like Shreibie, though there's no woman to heckle like Stern does. Its that type of transcendant quality that makes the film great.  Eddie's marriage,and I'm not sure if this is 50s behavoir or not, to his wife to be and the fact that Eddie still lives with his parents I think is an interesting plot line into how these guys think. Though it should be said, back then, parents slept in seperate beds, so it could be natural time period peice info while exercising the view of the character as well.  The DVD Diner I recently watched and I liked that. I think it has a lot of good features. There's interviews from the main characters as well as secondary characters, the director himself, the trailer of Diner, the ""Baltimore films"" catalog, and another trailor this time for I think it was Liberty Heights.

117556,5,0790744546,"I have a lot of affection for this movie, not least because I was born and raised in Baltimore - although I was younger in 1959 and lived on the other side of town. Baltimore is as much a character as any of the actors and the film lovingly recreates the city as I remember it.

Diner is about a bunch of guys who are never happier than when hanging out at the wonderfully nostalgic eatery of the title. The emphasis is on atmosphere and character more than plot, although there are several memorable set pieces - most enjoyably in the cinema when Mickey Rourke's date finds a surprise in the popcorn.

The cast - the heart and soul of the film - are universally strong, except for Kevin Bacon's periodic lapses of overacting. The dialogue seems natural and occasionally improvised - especially Paul Reiser's, whose character unfortunately gets lost in the middle of the film. The female characters are more basic and less deep, but then this is really a film about the guys. And their camaraderie - which developed during rehearsals and filming - is the major charm and attraction of Diner.

I love the film, but then I'm from Baltimore. But it must have universal appeal because my English wife also loves Diner and she's only been to Charm City once. It's a great film that rewards repeated viewings. For me, the only downside is the sight of the Little Tavern and the knowledge that those gorgeous little burgers are now extinct.",1093564800,10,1433,4.6117647058823525

I decided to watch Diner again recently, since I had little recollection of it.  Given all of its critical acclaim and somewhat cult-status, I'd say I felt just a little let down.  Really, I do mean a little:
--the storylines were interesting, but not fascinating;
--the ""witty banter"" at the diner was fun, but could have been better (think the coffee shop scene in Reservoir Dogs or the foot rub conversation in Pulp Fiction--now THAT's funny).
I think part of the reason for all of the accolades is that the film's ""free-form"" style was somewhat groundbreaking in 1982.  It has been done better several times since then.  Overall, I'd say this is a solid, entertaining film.  Great?  Nah.",1089072000,6,880,4.743421052631579
117558,5,0790744546,"DINER has been receiving a lot of unkind remarks in recent years, and much of it is undeserved. Time is really what has been unkind. In 1982, after years of hippie doldrums, disco ho-hum, and punk self-destruction, Barry Levinson reached back to a different era which seemed like a simpler one. But he did so without a nostalgic eye. He presented five young men at a point in life when hard decisions have to be made. To compound this, each of the five young men are facing critical issues at this critical time. (Notice I say five men, not six. Modell [Paul Reiser] doesn't have a plot line. He's there for comic effect mostly.)
Boogie (Micky Rourke), his gambling problems aside, struggles to keep his dreams but must learn to accept the responsibilities of life. The intellectual but alcohol-plagued Fenwick (Kevin Bacon) must face-down his crusty, aloof family once and for all. Shreevie (Daniel Stern) must learn to translate his love for love songs for love for his wife before his marriage completely evaporates. Mama's boy (with a twisted mama), Eddie, (Steve Guttenburg) who has no real excuse for treating his fiancee so badly, is the most desperate in need of growing up.
To me, Billy (Timothy Daly) has the most poignant of all problems. He's willing to face up to his responsibility; he's willing to do the right thing. In one scene, where he decks the last opposing player of a baseball team that had ganged up on him, he essentially has put his boyhood behind him. What's standing in his way is the woman carrying his child but won't marry him. (She has good reason, by the way, for being reluctant.)
But comedy is watching other people struggle with their problems, after all. To me, the more believeable the problems (and they are believeable) the more effective the comedy.
Levinson squeezes so much humor out of these characters, and the actors deliver beautifully. The ease with which the cast interacts makes the viewer wonder whether they had been friends for years before making this film. Unlike other comedies of the early 80s--the infamous one-liners strung together--DINER's tangle of plot lines grows logically; it progresses as a result of the characters, not the situation. And while the film ends, according to true comic convention, with a wedding, it is the only traditional aspect of the film. It was truly unique for its time. And perhaps the time will come again when people will appreciate the value of this movie.",1086566400,49,2451,4.838095238095238
117559,5,0790744546,"Barry Levinson has made a number of films that are both critically acclaimed and really enjoyable...but ""Diner"" is the one I always come back to when I need an example of a finely crafted movie that appears to be wholly natural (i.e., no one would ever assume that the cast was ever ""acting"").
Every actor in this film was in the early stage of their big screen career when this movie was made; every one went on to a sustained level of success.  Mickey Rourke became one of the hottest actors of the 1980's, Kevin Bacon went from minor support roles to leading man status, Paul Reiser's stand-up comedy took off and he eventually found his way to the successful TV series ""Mad About You"" after (most peculiarly) landing a role as a heavy corporate slimeball in ""Aliens"".  And Steve Guttenberg became a significant enough personality to land a role with Tom Selleck and Ted Danson in ""Three Men and a Baby"" before the decade was done (where he's gone since then is anyone's guess).
Ellen Barkin shoulders the thankless burden of being the lone female character surrounded by very well-defined male characters in a brilliant job of ensemble casting, and she is more than up to the task.  Not being ""one of the guys"", she is eternally the outsider looking in...yet being married to (and apparently an ex-girlfriend of) ""one of the guys"" keeps her connected, ambiguously at best, to a circle she is doomed never to fully understand.
That's because this movie is about ""the guys"" and what it means to be ""one of the guys"".  Character development is very well-executed; the actors throw themselves into their roles and present well-rounded (and uniquely flawed) young men that any one of us may have known (or been) at that same stage in our own lives.  Friends who have grown up together and are in the process of growing apart, not quite understanding the depth of responsibility that comes with adulthood.
All of that aside, the dialogue in this movie, particularly in the scenes in the diner itself (apparently improvised to a significant degree) really make this movie worth watching.  Quentin Tarantino couldn't write such believable casual exchanges between good friends.  It all seems to flow so naturally; these are conversations you could hear (or have) anywhere with your friends.  It's ""Sex In The City"" 20 years ahead of its time, focused from the mens' point of view.  A terrific soundtrack and a stunning collection of vintage automobiles (especially Kevin Bacon's old Triumph TR2) round out a thoroughly satisfying period piece which is timeless enough to have taken place anywhere at anytime.  You don't have to have grown up in the 1950's to appreciate a character study this good.",1079308800,9,2694,4.849673202614379

I look back on it, now the next morning, and the only sort of funny scene is Daniel Stern's character complaining to his wife that she isn't alphabetizing his record collection correctly.  He then storms out of the house leaving her in tears over it.  It's memorable but so sad and pathetic.  And he's maybe the most mature of the lot of these characters who are supposedly just out of high school but who look to me to be in their late 20s.
Of all the characters, I think I enjoyed seeing Kevin Bacon's the most.  He had some depth and complexity as a book-smart young man who knows all the answers on a college quiz TV show he is watching, but at the same time is so uninspired to do anything with his life.  I was hoping for more of a story to develop around him, but it didn't happen (having him go crazy in a manger scene is very anti-climatic).  Aside from his character, there was no one I could identify with.
It seemed to be boring scene after boring scene and there I am waiting for something interesting to grab my attention.  Ten minutes of Tim Daly playing simple piano in a strip club with a half-hearted drummer (who's obviosuly not even playing the drums) and a sax player who knows 1 riff is not my idea of engaging.
Maybe you had to grow up in Baltimore.
I give this 2 stars because I can't fault the dialog or acting, which is fine but nothing to get all excited over.  It's the story that is aimless.
Someone compared this to American Graffitti and I must comment on that.  The only real comparison is that they both take place in the 50s and are about what people are going to do after high school (and those characters look like high school students).  That movie has its hilarious parts, its serious parts, and its parts that make you cry.  It has dozens of memorable scenes and you actually care about the characters.",1067904000,5,2018,4.346666666666667
117563,5,0790744546,"I left Baltimore over ten years ago to live in sunny Florida. But whenever I'm feeling homesick for my former hometown, I'll pop Barry Levinson's nostalgic comedy/drama, ""Diner"" into the DVD player. ""Diner"" is the first (and the best) of  Levinson's 'Baltimore' pictures. These are a series of semi-autobiographical films, that takes place in the Writer/Director's hometown during the late '50's and early '60s. In this case the year is 1959 and it is the Christmas season. A group of buddies in their early twenties are preparing to see one of their own about to go to the alter and get married. In this episodic comedy, we watch as these young men go on dates, drive around, gamble, go to parties etc. No matter what, at the end of the evening they always end up at the diner. It is there, that they hang out and talk about every subject under the sun. From the important to the ridiculous (""Who's better, Mathis or Sinatra?"" Answer with sarcastic laughter: ""Presley"")This is an interesting and humorous film in which we watch how these young guys bond and communicate. They are in a way having their last hurrah before they settle down into lives that involve marriage, jobs, mortgages, kids and other responsibilities of adulthood. This is one of those films where the writing, directing and acting all come together to create something truely special. Levinson's directing (his first film) is right on the mark. He makes us care about these characters no matter how likable or unlikable their behavior may be. The writing (with much improvisation from the actors)is both comical and poignant. One could go on forever listening to the rich and funny back and forth dialogue between these friends(listen to the roast beef sandwich conversation).This film is also known for it's perfect casting, which included star making roles for Steve Guttenberg, Daniel Stern, Mickey Rourke, Kevin Bacon, Tim Daly, Paul Reiser, Michael Tucker and Ellen Barkin. Just about the entire main cast later went on to successful careers in movies and television. Everyone in the cast gives great performances all around. The DVD of this movie is a good transfer and includes extras such as trailers and an informative, half hour documentary in which Levinson and most of the cast talk about the making of the film. This is an excellent movie which I highly recommend!",1064188800,5,2349,4.931818181818182
117564,5,0790744546,"This is the first of films which comprise Barry Levinson's ""Baltimore Trilogy,"" the other two being Tin Men (1987) and Avalon (1990). No two share much in common except Levinson's obvious love of the city and his commitment to ""controlled freedom"" which allows actors to improvise, collaborate with him on script revisions, and in other ways participate in the completion of a film. The nature and extent of such engagement is unique. The results -- as evident in the trilogy -- are impressive.
I guess you could call Diner a ""guys film"" but the six mutually-dependent (co-dependent?) young men seem so immature, indeed so dysfunctional to me that I find it difficult to believe that any reasonably intelligent, self-assured young woman would want to have anything with them, especially as a group. Beth (Ellen Barkin) is married to one of them, ""Shrevie"" (Daniel Stern), who would much rather hang out at the diner with his friends than spend time with her. Eddie (Steve Guttenberg) is engaged to be married and already has concerns about being ""tied down"" as he prepares a prenuptial quiz based on Baltimore Colts trivia. His fiancee must get at least a score of 65 to ""pass"" or the wedding is off.  Modell (Paul Reiser) has a sharp sense of humor and apparently nothing else going for him. ""Boogie"" (Mickey Rourke) is a hair dresser by day and claims to be a law student at night while sinking further into (gambling) debt to his bookie. As for Timothy (Kevin Bacon), he lives on a meager monthly allowance from a family trust fund and is perhaps the most lethargic of them all, no doubt because he is almost always drunk or close to it. They are re-joined by Billy who returns to Baltimore from graduate school in New York to serve as Eddie's best man. Billy has a pregnant girlfriend who seems indifferent to any further contact with him.
According to Levinson, he shot the diner scenes last so that, by then, the six lead actors would have gotten to know each other and be more comfortable with each other...if not bond as tightly as the characters they portray in the film. My reactions to it when I first saw it were different from when I saw it again recently. Unlike in National Lampoon's Animal House (1978), much of the humor in Diner now seems somewhat stale to me. Also I now have much less patience with the central characters' immaturity and irresponsibility which I thought was rather cool in 1982. Also, I am much more uncomfortable now with how they view women and, worse yet, how they treat them. Finally, I now feel some degree of sorrow for behavior which seems so wasteful. Don't these guys realize that time is NOT unlimited, that getting as much formal education as possible is highly desirable, that decisions have consequences, and the number and quality of opportunities in their lives will rapidly diminish each year? Obviously, the movie hasn't changed. I have.
However, then in 1982 and again recently, I really enjoyed the soundtrack (available on a CD), featuring 41 classics which include Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On (Jerry Lee Lewis), Teenager in Love (Dion & The Belmonts), Mr. Blue (The Fleetwoods), Come Go with Me (Del Vikings), Beyond the Sea (Bobby Darin), It's All in the Game (Tommy Edwards), Whole Lotta Lovin (Fats Domino), Don't Be Cruel (Elvis Presley), and Goodbye Baby (Jack Scott). Each generates so many personal memories, including specific scenes in this film. The DVD version offers two especially interesting special features: an ""Introduction"" by Levinson and a ""making of"" documentary called ""Diner: On the Flip Side"" with Levinson and members of his talented cast (except Rourke).
Those who enjoy this film are urged to check out the aforementioned Tin Men and Avalon as well as American Graffiti (1974), Car Wash (1976), The Hollywood Knights (1980), Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), Mystic Pizza (1988), and Barbershop (2002).",1063929600,23,3891,4.877643504531722
117575,5,0790744546,"never ever did I see myself watching this movie, especially if i had heard about its plot before viewing.  But during a lonely night, no women, no food, no friends, no life, i was flicking the cable channel and i caome upon this hilarious unimaginable scene, where a man has his penis in a bucket of popcorn sitting in a movie theather (Isn't popcorn hot?).  Well that was enough to gain this lonely guys interest.  looking for something in the line of Animal house and Revenge of the Nerds, I find this heartfelt movie showing the development between friends from teenhood to adulthood.  Throughout this movie you see a difference in each character of friends, that models the average group of friends in most Amrerican movies and also in many ways reality.  You have your badboy, loser, smartguy, and shy type all indulged in various trials.
Wont ruin the movie, but the characteristics alone is very appealing in this movie, since it models so much the lives of young men today, which is one of the reasons I give this movie an A++++.",1031356800,,1037,4.644808743169399
117576,5,0790744546,"Barry Levinson has been hailed as a great director on the basis of such films as Rain Man, Good Morning Vietnam and Bugsy. Diner is where his career began and remains the best film in his entire catalogue.
Diner takes place in Baltimore in the 1950s and tells the story of five young men hanging onto their high school antics by the skins of their teeths while coming to terms with fast-approaching adult responsibilities.
College, work, marriage, and responsibility in general threaten the quality time they spend hanging out at the Diner, discussing ""What's on the B-Side?"" and ""Who's better: Sinatra or Mathis?"" (The answer, of course: ""Presley"").
The film's laughs originate from its good ear for dialogue and the fantastic acting, which at times appears to be improvised. The film's young actors include Daniel Stern, Mickey Rourke, Kevin Bacon, and Steve Guttenberg in the collective high point of their careers.
A thought-provoking and laugh-out-loud masterpiece.",1012176000,4,970,5.2243589743589745
117577,4,0790744546,"There's a curious genre of film that I wholeheartedly endorse: the guys-talking-the-night-away flick.  When done well, the genre's peculiar blend of nihilism and profundity easily sweeps me away.  ""Diner"" belongs to (or did it originate?) this genre, although its not as blatantly verbose as it's offspring.  Actually, the sitting-and-talking scenes are rather restrained.  Still, when captured on film, sincere conversation can be more exciting than the most thrilling of car chase sequences.
In this genre, seeing as many of the scenes are played in static locales with little action, acting is of the utmost importance.  ""Diner""s much celebrated young cast, made up of unknown pre-stardom actors, is nearly perfect (Why only 'nearly' you ask?  More later...).  Daniel Stern is always adept at playing this kind of semi-wise everyman.  Only here he has a dark streak, which threatens to do him in.  It's a welcome stretch for Stern, and he does well as the Diner group's most grown up member.  Ellen Barkin plays Stern's put-upon wife.  I've never found her appealing as an actress, but she plays her character's torment just right here, in what is essentially a token female role.  Mickey Rourke, if you can watch him without the benefit of hindsight, shows much promise as the group's lady prowling gambling addict.  His Boogie has some moments where he must talk himself out of seemingly insurmountable situations, and Rourke, with his shy boy's voice and devilish smile, makes them look easy.  Kevin Bacon plays against type, as a self-destructive trust fund kid.  Bacon's small stature works against him, in that Fenn is supposed to be a terrifying presence at times.  But somehow the point gets across, and Bacon, although he shows some signs of his amateur ness, deserves heaps of credit.  Timothy Daly, who we are used to seeing as a non-threatening nice guy, appears that way on the surface.  But Billy, freshly home from school, has a mean streak a mile wide.  Daly is both menacing and naive, a neat trick to pull off.  Paul Reiser gets probably the least amount of screen time, but he makes the most of what he's given.  Reiser always seems like he's doing his stand-up act when he's acting, but the effect works here.  Modell is a charming leech.  He's the kind of guy who'll sucker you into giving up half of your roast beef sandwich, with a gentle touch that won't even leave a mark.
Okay, so remember I said 'nearly'?  Well, there was one actor -- and character -- here that repulsed me every time he was on the screen.  Steve Guttenberg plays Eddie with little understanding of the kind of character he should have been.  See how Reiser shows Modell's likeability, even though he's kind of a scoundrel?  Without it, you wouldn't believe that the character would be allowed anywhere near the holy ground of the Diner.  Well, Guttenberg gives Eddie none of that likeability.  He's just a mindless, heartless, oaf of a man.  If he was in my group of close-knit friends, well, he wouldn't be for long.  Guttenberg, who managed to pull off the likable scoundrel character in the ""Police Academy"" movies(!), was just distracting here.  And he does not have the acting faculties needed to make the film's dialogue feel improvisational, as the other actors most certainly do.  Not that it was all Guttenberg's fault.  The character, as written, is unlikable.  There's one scene where Eddie gives his prospective fiancee a lengthy football trivia quiz, which she must pass before he agrees to the marriage.  Are you kidding me!  Is there a woman in this world (or in, more accurately, 1950s Baltimore) empty and stupid enough to subject herself to such humiliation for a misogynistic dork like this?
Eddie/Guttenberg aside, this is a near flawless little movie.  I bought into the boys' obsessions wholeheartedly, found their flaws quiet believable, and was engrossed by their conversations.  Writer/Director Barry Levinson, who I've always thought of as little more than an over-rated, Baltimore-obsessed hack, at least got things right his first time around.",1009411200,4,4070,4.991084695393759

117579,4,0790744546,"I first saw Diner in the early eighties and it became one of my favorites.  It captures the same feel as another coming of age movie, American Graffiti.  The stories occur only three years apart, with Diner capturing more of the fifties feel and being the grittier of the two.  While both of the films are excellent and understated, I can probably handle Diner on a more regular basis.
It struck a chord with me because a group of 5-6 friends and I spent each Friday and Saturday night during the early eighties sitting around a table in an all night cafe doing what the guys in Diner do - talking about women and the world in general.
The characters are normal guys, but at the same time they hold surprises.  Boogie, played by Mickey Rourke, works in a beauty salon AND goes to law school at night.  And this is in 1959!  Fenwick, Kevin Bacon's character, appears to be a delinquent with a drinking problem (which he is), but reveals an intelligent side.  Daniel Stern's character doesn't understand his wife at all, but has an encyclopedic knowledge of music history.
The entire starring cast went on to bigger (but not always better - where is that understated Mickey Rourke now?) things but the film contained firsts for several people involved.  This was Barry Levinson's directorial debut, Ellen Barkin's film debut and a breakout role for Mickey Rourke.
The DVD is a pleasant surprise.  It contains an anamorphic widescreen video transfer which is surprisingly free of nicks and scratches, although not perfect.  The widescreen presentation is a revelation when compared to the pan and scan VHS version.  City shots show much more and the group scenes flow much more smoothly without the cutting back and forth between characters.
Another surprise is the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track.  Most films in the early eighties were stereo, but many small films have not gotten the full DD treatment.  This one has and, though it is not an action-explosion-car crash movie, the benefits of the DD audio are evident.
There is also a documentary called Diner:On the Flip Side which has Levinson and all the stars except Mickey Rourke in it.  This is a nice addition as it helps explain how the characters appear to be a real group of friends, not just actors playing a group of friends.  The parallels with American Grafitti continue here, as both casts were brought to their shooting locations, housed in a hotel and spent an inordinate amount of time together before and during filming.
If you want a film that envelopes you like a warm blanket, and which has great dialogue and character interaction, get this DVD, call over a few friends and enjoy.",978220800,39,2653,4.762008733624454
117580,5,0790744546,"Couldn't help but note that all these fine reviews appear to be written by males.  Lest anyone get the impression Diner is strictly a ""guy"" film, I'm here to enlarge the audience base.  It's a no-plot hilarious film with enough bitter/poignant moments to lift it beyond comedy.  The acting is superb.  I can't say enough about Barry Levinson's firm grasp on the entire picture.  The actors, though now well known, were neophytes at the time.  Levinson took them beyond themselves.  Some of them have never approached the perfection again of their performanances in this film.  I think particularly of Steve Guttenberg and Mickey Rourke.  I became an instant Kevin Bacon fan first for crass reasons (be still my beating heart) and secondly for his excellent realization of his role.  They are bored, they are restless and no, they are not ""men.""  They are between adolescence and adulthood, a very unpleasant place to be.

117583,5,0790744546,"What is really interesting about Diner is that it came very early in the  career of its director and actors, yet although most of them have had  monster hits since then, they have never surpassed their achievement in  this movie. In none of his other films has Barry Levinson made his  slice-of-life Baltimore milieu seem so cohesive, so moving, or so  hilarious; in no other films did  Mickey Rourke and Steve Guttenberg--who  looked like nascent superstars in 1982 but squandered their early  promise--come across with such charisma and charm. Even the preponderance  of actors from this movie who went on to huge success--Kevin Bacon, Ellen  Barkin, Daniel Stern, Tim Daly, Paul Reiser--reached a personal best in  ""Diner."" In a way this is the ultimate ""guy  flick""--concerned very much with the way guys talk, think, and react  to each other and to women--yet there's enough humor, tenderness and  humanity in Levinson's vision to make this an excellent choice for any  audience. It's interesting to note that Stern also starred in  ""Breaking Away,"" another classic sleeper comedy about young guys  hanging out and trying to forget the future. The two flicks would make a  great rental double bill!",968544000,6,1203,5.051020408163265
117584,4,0790744546,"One of the most enjoyable sleepers of all time. A nostalgic piece of Americana. Levinson directed and wrote this small gem, but he also cast every character perfectly, and not a bum performance in the bunch. Filled  with many memorable comic vignettes, such as the 'roast-beef sandwich'  scene, the 'movie theater' bet and Steve Guttenberg's football quiz. While  the film basically lacks a plot, it is just a string of amusing episodes of  guys hanging out. Every character is expertly developed, Levinson tells us  more about his characters with everyday chitchat, than other directors do  with heavy dialogue. A lightweight comedy that never runs old, after  repeated viewings you feel like one of the gang, and you even choose your  favorite character. A great place to visit when you're feeling down, or  just to have a plain good time. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!",962755200,6,885,4.846666666666667
