8287315,5,B001CEEXTC,"Sergio martino is  certainly among the best crime movie directors that italy ever produced. And he truly tried something different with this movie. The film concerns a gruesome murder and the cop who is trying to solve it.  But unlike other crime movies their is alot of humor in this movie. An example of this is the funny car chase in which a man spins on his head as he is grazed by a car.  The story concerns a unorthodox cop and his young thief assistant who try to stop a kidnapping ,  white slavery ring. Like a giallo (murder mystery) , There is a sadistic murderer who kills people in this movie but he's connected to the criminal slavers and kidnappers.  The movie is well done and you can tell that sergio wanted to try something a little different than the standard cop or giallo movie.  He had just done the classic giallo 'torso"" and this movie was a break into a good cop movie with humorous touches. The actors are all up to the challenge here too.  It's about time this great flick was put out. And sazuma  does a fantastic job of cleaning up the print.  Unfortunately this company only puts discs out in europe because we need more great older movies to get this treatment.  And that includes american movies too.  This movie is very enjoyable and it makes a fine addition to any crime , giallo, mystery lovers film library.",1221609600,,1342,4.436734693877551
