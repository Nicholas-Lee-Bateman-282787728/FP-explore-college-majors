6808857,5,B00PIVK97U,"I love that they have launched a more grown-up version of Dora, as after watching her for 8 years now it has been a little tiring.  This DVD is a great introduction to Dora and her new friends.  It features four episodes that all teach great lessons of teamwork, friendship and overcoming problems.  I admit I did miss some of the old Dora friends but it was a nice change for her and my daughter loves seeing how Dora has grown up in to a ""big girl.""",1424563200,4,451,4.160919540229885
