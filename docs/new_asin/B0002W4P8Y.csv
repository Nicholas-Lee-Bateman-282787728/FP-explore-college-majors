2128371,5,B0002W4P8Y,"When we last left the staff of ""The Office"" it was at a crossroads: secretary Dawn and her fiancee Lee were headed for the States, Gareth was headed for a promotion, and everyone's least favourite boss David Brent had been made redundant. The only person not heading in a new direction (unless you count downwards) was the person who never moves at all: Tim, the every-man of the show whose future prospects were looking monotonous and bleak.

Now, three years later the BBC documentary crew have come to film a follow-up show and see where their previous stars have ended up. Gareth is on a power trip as the new management boss of the office, though he wields about as much respect as David did in his day. Tim is miserable, unsuccessfully trying to bond with the new secretary who is utterly baffled at his jokes and seated next to Anne, a woman with appalling manners and long-winded stories. Dawn is tanned in Florida, but without a real job permit she's forced to babysit full-time for the mean-spirited Lee's sister's baby.

And David. Oh boy. Reduced to a cleaning-produce salesman, he's attempting in his evenings to break into show business by guest appearances at pubs and nightclubs. However, the general public at large despise him, and he's beginning to realise what the rest of the world has always known: he's a pathetic schmuck. And here is where the show takes its most astonishing turn - in the first two seasons, we alternatively cringe and laugh at David's behaviour, but now we are made to feel profound pity for him. One scene in particular, in which David eats alone in an empty food court, actually brought tears of pity to my eyes. No one deserves to be this lonely.

But the Christmas party is looming. David pops into the office uninvited on a regular basis, and the manager Neil is so fed up that he tricks David into agreeing to bring a hot date to the party. Desperate, David seeks the help of a dating agency, which results in several appalling dates and brings up many misogynist, sexist and size-ist comments that only David Brent could possibly come up with. Meanwhile, Tim is bracing himself for Dawn's imminent arrival and praying that he won't humiliate himself yet again.

There are a couple of things I didn't quite agree with: Neil has always been a reasonable and likeable man in the past, but here acts quite jerky toward David (or maybe he's just reached the end of his rope in regards to his ex-employee), and Gareth seems a bit under-used. Worse however, was the complete lack of lines given to Jennifer, who has always been my favourite character. But the repulsive Chris Finch is finally told what we've all wanted to tell him since day one, and the actress playing Anne is so good that the creators probably wished they'd found and put her on the show sooner.

There is one scene that I really must point out simply because it's quite subtle but adds a lot to the overall playing-out of the show. When the staff pick out their Secret Santa names, Jamie (the *other* nice guy in the office), looks at his, smiles and promptly swaps it with Tim, who is in the process of declaring he can never buy his candidate a present. Later on, when Trudy is handing out the anonymous gifts, Gareth looks at his commando-soldier with distaste and demands to know who gave it to him. In the background we see Jennifer look at Jamie and mouth ""was it you?"" to which he nods. Given the fateful turn that Tim's Secret Santa gift takes, we can see that Jamie purposefully gave up his original name to give Tim once last chance. I never expected *this* show to make me go - ""Awwww"".

The entire two-part finale plays out to perfection. With the same wry humour, humdrum lives and scarily accurate portrayal of human behaviour, anyone who has been a fan of ""The Office"" will not be disappointed. Just when you think things can't get any worse for these characters, the heavens open and God (or at least the writers) throws them a curveball that may revive their fortunes. The performances here are Oscar-worthy, and I'm not exaggerating. From David's decline into depression and renewal of hope, to Tim's face when he hugs Dawn goodbye to the strains of ""I Want You Back For Good"", to Dawn's quintessential scene (don't worry, you'll know it when you see it), the talent here surpasses the television screen that displays it.

The Christmas send-off is the best possible ending to an amazing show, giving us everything we expect and more; the resolution to the Tim/Lee/Dawn love triangle in particular is done with a simplicity and poignancy I just didn't think this show could possess. At the same time we're expecting a `real life' ending, we're praying for a happy ending, and though I just can't give it away, I promise that you'll be more than satisfied.",1096675200,179,4787,4.65130023640662
2128372,5,B0002W4P8Y,"I heard about these specials on the office website, and being an avid fan of the show couldn't wait to see them, but I was worried when I didn't see them on sale on amazon or anywhere else. But luckily on a trip to Britain I was able to watch both of them on the plane, and they were better than I hoped for. Now that they are finally being released on video all office fans can complete their collection, because no office collection is complete without these specials, they are absolutely critical to the show.",1095120000,12,512,4.34375
2128373,5,B0002W4P8Y,"if you're reading this review you likely know how brilliant the first two series of the office were, so i won't bore you with what you already know. if you haven't had a chance to see the two christmas specials a word of warning, avoid reviews at all costs it's hard not to review the specials without hinting at some major spoilers. so if that's you stop now.

having said all that these last two episodes rank up with the very best conclusions to any series of novels, movies or television shows ever. as you've come to expect the humor is gut wrenching and hilarious at the same time. what is totally unexpected is steve and ricky's ability to provide the audience with a satisfying conclsuion without betraying the spirit of the show. too often these callous or cynical shows/movies/books change so drastically in tone in the the closing moments that they damage the soul of the show/movie/book (bad santa, death to smoochy). fear not with the office, it is a masterstroke ending that illustrates how much ricky and steve care about their audience.",1094515200,23,1052,4.717391304347826
2128374,5,B0002W4P8Y,"I was in England when they showed the Christmas Specials on the BBC. And as I am an avid fan of The Office, this was the day(s) that I had been waiting for for months! The special is not only the BEST ending to a series that I have ever seen, it is also the first time I have cried FOR SHEER JOY at the ending of it~

You will laugh with pain for the characters, and sit in awkward silence not knowing whether to laugh or cry for David/Tim/Dawn. It will fill all the gaps in your heart that the two season left! It contains all the painful David Brentisms only much more intensified as he is a despraite man at the end of his pitiful rope. Tim is at his all time low, while Gareth is at his all time high. And Dawn, well, you will see!

I definatly recommend this to anyone with a brain who has seen and loved The Office. It is simply The Best!",1093996800,33,844,3.958823529411765

2128415,5,B0002W4P8Y,"This show is a symphony. A perfectly constructed one, at that. The acting is spot-on and deadpan, as the cast maneuvers their way through one comedic/horrific scene to the next. The writing and directing for this TV comedy shines and lifts the product up to, dare I say, legendary status. Dare! Dare! Overall, this is one subtly brilliant television offering. This show, more than any other show that I've found (Seinfeld included) makes me want to watch its episodes over and over again - and never tire of them.

The true power of the show lies in the fact that only 13 ""episodes"" exist. And what does exist feels volumes and volumes deeper than the total of 13 could ever communicate. In short, it never wears out it's welcome.

Highly recommended.",1153958400,7,751,4.7251908396946565
2128416,4,B0002W4P8Y,"I have loved the office ever since I saw it when it was brand new in the UK.  I just had to buy the DVD's when I got back to the US.  The Special was the last piece that I needed.  I knew that it was made some time after the originals, so wasn't expecting it to be quite as good.  I was not let down.  The characters are still funny and get into their always crazy predicaments.  If you loved the first 2 series, I think you will enjoy this one as well.  I fell on the floor for David Brent's ""music video""...",1152835200,,509,3.8365384615384617
2128417,5,B0002W4P8Y,"Sorry to sound juvenile, but this is the freakin' funniest thing I have ever seen.  It is sly, intelligent and very English, which is a perfect combination in my opinion.

Ricky Gervais is a great comedian and equally skilled actor (even if he begs to differ).  When I first saw this on cable, I would giggle to myself for days recalling certain scenes.  Now that I own it (one of the smartest purchases I've ever made), I have not stopped laughing out loud, not one day.  I keep remembering hilarious lines delivered with perfectly serious faces, and I burst out laughing!

If you enjoy British humor, if you've seen only a few episodes of ""The Office,"" do yourself a favor and buy this gem.  Ricky Gervais is the best thing to come along in quite awhile. Whoever thought such non-stop fun and happiness could be found for such a low price?

Oh, and the DVD extras are even more hysterical if you can possibly believe it.  The interview with Ricky and Stephen Merchant alone is a gem.  But the music video, oh my God...The music video.  There simply are no words.  Enjoy!",1141516800,3,1072,4.526041666666667
2128418,5,B0002W4P8Y,"If you are undecided about whether to start with a single disc of this great show or go for a multi-disc set, my advice is to go for the set that includes season 1, 2 and the special. (Identified as ""The Office - The Complete Collection (First And Second Series Plus Special)""). Once you start, you will end up buying all three anyway, so you might as well save money by buying this set, which in sum costs less than buying individually. The series, the plot, the characters, especially Ricky Gervais, work their way into you consciousness, and you won't let go until you see the full way it plays out, so comic, yet so real and riveting. This is more than just a comedy, it's a world that is created and inhabited by the characters AND by you, the viewer -- they way they draw you in with soliloquies to the camera, and reveal little pieces of themselves. Comic yes, but also drama and character You will be very happy with this purchase.",1138406400,2,939,4.402298850574713
2128419,5,B0002W4P8Y,"The Office Special is a spot-on conclusion to the BBC series at the top of its game.  The Office Special ends the popular series in a touching and poignant manner wrapping up many story lines full circle. Special features include a must see full band version of ""Freelove Freeway"" featuring Noel Galligher of Oasis on backup vocals.  David Brent redeems himself in the end by proving he is more than just a 'chilled out entertainer' with his expose on the human condition.  Don't miss it!",1129852800,,488,4.7176470588235295

2128421,5,B0002W4P8Y,"The highlight of this has to be seeing David Brent (ably acted by Ricky Gervaise) in the music video he made - extraodinary - so hard to distinguish from other video's I have see - Daniel Bedingfield came rushing to mind!.

For those who felt like the two series of the office had left things hanging - Dawn about to leave, Tim in limbo, and David gone from 'the office"" then this will tie up all those nagging loose ends.

You are not going to enjoy this if you haven't already seen the rest of the series, it won't really make sense - the storylines won't have any background.

This has been made in the same Mockumentary style and picks up the staff of the Office several months later following where they are now and what they are doing. Dawn and her boyfriend are living in Florida, with a baby - but not everything is as it seems. The film crew decide to follow them back to a reunion of Werner Hogg Stationery Slough branch.

Real train-crash stuff. The same complete lack of empathy oozing to toxic levels from David Brent - it is excruciatingly funny to watch. However what I loved about this two part series is that Brent became the sympathetic character - instead of being the one you love to hate, I found I really wanted him to win. He gets challenged to bring someone to the reunion - but will he manage to get someone there. You will be hanging on right to the end for this one.

Highly recommended - definitely a keeper, watched it over and over again. If you liked this series, you might also like the hilarious series The Book Group - this is really worth seeking out for the same kind of off-beat humour - or even League of Gentlemen - another classic and odd-ball British comedy.

2128422,5,B0002W4P8Y,"This is an excellent ending to an excellent show.  I was sad when I discovered that there where only two full seasons to this funny show, but after this DVD it is quit forgivable.  They handle these characters with extreme care to make sure that they still get a believable happy ending.  The documentary with the actors is great.  You know that they had fun and that you had fun watching it. This is a great show for anyone that loves british humor and making fun of reality tv shows.",1125878400,,485,4.355555555555555
2128423,5,B0002W4P8Y,"The Office is an absolutely wonderful piece of television art. The whole crew totally deserved all their Golden Globes. BAFTAs and Television Critics' Awards.  Quite apart from the humor (and the savage satire of reality television), the ""Office Cycle"" (both series and the special) works because we end up (sometimes against our better judgement), empathizing with the characters -except, of course, the completely repugnant Finchy.  Ricky Gervais does a great job at portraying David Brent as equal parts Neanderthal berk, and emotionally-needy puppy dog/rabid hamster.

The Tim and Dawn plot line is the emotional core of the cycle (thanks Ricky and Steve for confirming that for me in the ""making of"" featurette), so it's really nice to see that getting the full treatment in the special.  Full marks too to the incredibly talented Lucy Davis (Dawn) and Joel Beckett (Lee) for their performances here and elsewhere in the series.  Beckett deserves huge credit for the menacing yobishness he brings to the part of Lee.  His acting plays a huge role in underlining our sympathy for Dawn.

I agree also with the earlier reviewers who point to Neil's dark side (particularly his friendship with Finchy) as an interesting character development.  It's a telling comment on currently- popular corporate mentality that ""a good earner"" must be humored even if he's a total git, and this along with Neil's mean-spirited treatment of David, is as good an indictment of white collar mores as I've seen in a long while.

Still and all, my favorite thing about the whole series is the STUPENDOUS acting job done by the whole cast.  In particular, I'd like to single out the ""minor"" characters Jamie (Jamie Deeks), Jennifer (Stirling Gallacher), Trudy (Rachel Isaac) and of course, the truly-awful-but-you-just-can't-stop-watching-him Keith (Ewan McIntosh)as wonderful illustrations of the old saying ""there are no minor parts (only minor actors)"" but my absolute favorite (of the series and the special) has got to be Martin Freeman who plays poor old Tim.  What an incredibly, amazing face!  This guy has a huge future in front of him as an actor.

Lastly, I just wanted to say. The last 10 minutes of the special are just indescribable.  You do have to watch the whole series to get the full effect but. Dammit. What an ending! I don't care if this destroys my reputation as a hard-headed critic of the arts (heh!), but that sequence simply reduced me to tears. It also made me go out and buy Yaz's album ""Upstairs at Eric's"" which features the song ""Only You"" that plays at the end of the party.

2128442,5,B0002W4P8Y,"Before this special, ""The Office"" was an all-time great comedy. After this special, ""The Office"" also became an all-time great show.",1123545600,,132,5.333333333333333
2128443,5,B0002W4P8Y,"Fortunately, the other reviews outline the details of this brilliant series and the ""Special"", so I don't have to. All the hype is true, and so I wanted everyone in my office to see the series, then had to reconsider. The characters would inevitably draw comparisons, and the boss=David comparison would reverberate for a long time. Perhaps with dire consequences. This is the pinnacle of British TV, note that I did not say British Comedy, as I am not sure it is comedy, maybe Greek style tragic comedy? The timing of the action, the pauses, the gestures, and the furtive glances in the show are all impeccable. Ricky Gervais has accomplished what John Cleese and Connie Booth did with the scripts of Fawlty Towers, and then put it into context of a believable scenario. If you watch the first and second season in order, the anticipation of the ""Special"" will put the ""Who shot JR"" Dallas episode wait into obscurity. You cannot believe that the second season ended the way it did, and you cross the fingers of both hands and feet hoping that the Special will fix that. Which it indeed does, and then it does it some more.

PS I watched the first episode of the US remake of The Office, and it did not draw me in at all.",1120953600,2,1222,4.504504504504505
2128444,5,B0002W4P8Y,"Just so you know - there are some Office Special spoilers in this review... :)

The Office is the quintessential television program.  Never before have I allowed myself to be so overcome with every emotion on the spectrum...  in only 14 episodes no less.  The Office takes us everywhere: from uproarious laughter to agonizing despair; from pity to poignancy.  And we are taken to these emotional extremes with a strong air of familiarity.  Who among us has not worked with a Tim, a Gareth, a Keith, a Malcolm or even a David Brent?

When I was first introduced to the series it took me a bit to get into it.  I watched the first episode 3 times and while it was mildly funny, I just didn't get what the big deal was.  Then a few months later I decided to give it another go.  This time I turned on the subtitles (I admit it... Stupid American).  I realized that I had been missing at least half the jokes!  I proceeded to watch both the first and second series in about 3 days' time.

The only thing that helped me get through the sadness of the final episode was knowing that The Office Special was out there.  When I got it, I couldn't watch it right away; I didn't want the series to end!  But I did finally watch it, and was not disappointed.

The comedy was a lot more understated in the Special than in the regular series, likely due to the entirely different dynamic of the ""new"" office.  It was plain that Tim missed Dawn, and possibly even Gareth as a desk mate... He was given Anne instead, kind of the female version of Gareth... :)  Watching David's life spiral ever downward was extremely difficult to watch.

What makes The Office SO brilliant is the realistic portrayal of people and situations, and The Special was no exception.  I read the reviews where people thought Neil had undergone a bit of a personality change - I disagree.  After all, he was friendly with Chris Finch in series 2, and I don't believe you can BE friendly with Finchy without being clueless (David) or a bit mean-spiritied (Neil?).  I get the feeling that Neil was a bit more patient and polite with David when he worked for Wernham-Hogg out of pure professionalism.  In the Special, he felt he didn't owe David that professionalism any longer.

I also believe that there was a lot of realism in Tim and Dawn's reunion.  She had been engaged to Lee for 6 years with no wedding date in sight.  She had given up her home, her friends, and her dreams with no appreciation from him whatsoever.  It would have been hard to believe she WOULDN'T run to Tim's arms when she opened the gift from him!

Even David Brent.  It was amazing that when he met Carol for the party he actually managed to restrain the sexism, the inappropriate jokes, and the sheer ego-mania that he normally exhibited.  But there was something about it that felt right; we finally got to see the relatively sweet guy that we all knew was deep down there somewhere.  And, his telling Finchy off was one of the best moments in the show...

If you want a show that can make you laugh, cry, cringe and even shake your head with disbelief, watch The Office!  You won't be disappointed.  Bravo Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant, and all involved in this gem of entertainment.",1119830400,9,3224,4.473413379073756
2128445,3,B0002W4P8Y,"I would first like to state that I love Amazon.com. I buy stuff each and every week from Amazon, and I love them. I would hug and kiss them if I could,  or at least provide them with a manly handshake. In any case, kudos Amazon for being the best!

Nonetheless, last week, something odd happened. I received a shipment with several DVD sets...2 sets of Penn and Teller's ""Bullsh*t series, Blood Simple, and 'The Office Special'. There's nothing odd about the shipment in itself, unless you are referring to my tastes, in which case I shall angrily shake my fist at you!

But seriously, folks, I ripped open the package like a 13 year old boy on Christmas morning, rather than the 34 year old that I am. My wife and I watched some of the Bullsh*t stuff together, and then I put in the DVD for 'The Office Special'. I had seen the entire run of The Office on tv and online, but wanted the actual DVDs...

I anxiously awaited some of the bonus features on the DVD! I wanted to see David Brent's entire video for ""If you don't know me by now"" (Juxtaposition Records, 2002), or maybe his recording of ""Free Love Freeway!"". Hell, I was just excited!

I put the DVD in...and waited for auto-load to kick in...

and then...

FULL SCREEN GAY PORN.

Honestly...white backdrop....no sound...guy on guy action...my wife and I kinda stared at each other, and then I hit the eject button.

We called Amazon, and I think the guy we spoke with was grateful that we have a sense of humor. In fact, when I tell my wife I am gonna watch some DVDs, she says ""yeah, sure, I bet you're gonna go watch some gay porn!"". So we earned some chuckles from all this! I have no problem with gay porn. Some of my best friends are gay por...wait now...no...  I guess I am a little concerned that I got gay porn instead of The Office. But what can I say? it was a joke at the DVD stamping factory, and it worked! I watched 8 seconds of gay porn! HAHA! oh, the hilarity than ensued!

In any case, the Amazon dude who took our call refunded my money, and we decided to trash the DVD, and I even got a small bonus gift certificate out of it, which I promptly used towards the purchase of ""Ali G Indahouse"".

I got that DVD the other day, and am pleased to say, no gay porn!

2128446,5,B0002W4P8Y,"A lot of us in the USA had to wait a while for this. The two series of The Office was something as close to perfect as you can reasonably expect and yet .. and yet .. we missed Tim, Dawn and there was some kind of itch that needed scratching.

Watching this double-finale and then the extras, while you lie blissed out in some kind of post-orgasmic glow, is like someone has taken the worlds most effective back scratcher, and has gone at that itch with a vengeance.

PS: the documentary/interview with Ricky and the beanpole guy (sorry I'm bad with names) is hilarious. Especially funny how Ricky treats any suggestions from the actors on how things should have proceeded with such funny contempt! you know he loves the cast and you know they don't mind him saying it.

I also felt for Tim and Dawn and Gareth in extra interviews as they fought against the idea that they are very possibly type cast for life, and very probably will never work on something as perfect as the show ever again. Tim, perhaps, says what we all think: (paraphrasing) well, if the office does end up being my best work and basically it is all downhill from here, I suppose thats still no bad thing ...

Even reading the other reviews here brings me a smile. I just WISH I knew more people who I can introduce the whole show to, and watch their reactions to the end..",1109894400,6,1344,4.385542168674699
2128447,5,B0002W4P8Y,"I was so ecstatically happy for Tim that I can't even articulate to you the depth and detail of my own emotions. It's ridiculuous, I'm not even a Love story fan but there was something so pure and childlike about the interaction between them, I don't know how they could have acted like that without really having those feelings for each other. Watch them together, they are so beautiful. Watching Tim meeting Dawn again after she has come back from Florida is incredible I can understand every nervous twitch and movement that Tim makes and am overwhelmed with gladness when Tim engineers the situations with Dawn to be like the old days when making fun of Gareth. After Dawn leaves the party, there is something so sad and honest about the way Tim is going on with his life acknowledging that he is never going to realise his dream of being with Dawn and really having to accept it that makes their final reunion so uplifting and fulfilling.

The way in which it unfolds so simply, The unwrapping of the gift in the Taxi with the drawing of Tim on the card and the ""Never Give Up"" slogan along with Dawns tears of realisation of the truth about her feelings for Tim is so moving. I only wish there was more. You just know that Tim will devote every remaining second of his life to making Dawn happy. I know I would, because as the show was designed to do, when you watch it, you become Tim and this really allows you to fully empathise with him. I love the way Dawn is beautiful but not too perfect like a model and how Tim is just an average guy, it allows regular people to realise that they can aspire to have such a perfect thing as what Tim and Dawn have without having to slave themself to try to be in the realm of the Hollywood beautiful people in order to find true happiness.",1106006400,10,1787,4.350299401197605

Having heard all they hype surrounding the show ever since the Golden Globes I just recently decided to watch the series.  At a total of 14 episodes (including the special) The Office is a relatively short-lived show.  For the material however this is perfect.  The Office is perfect for Americans that like Curb Your Enthusiasm and Arrested Development.  For a show like this it is amazing how great the acting is and how much tension is created between the characters.

While the show spends most of the time following the idiotic boss the main theme of the entire show is the relationship between Tim and Dawn. After watching the special I will miss these characters.

2)  The scene with Dawn in the taxi, when she opens up her secret santa gift and we see what it is and we read the note that came with it!. THE most moving moment of the finale (well, there were plenty of those!).

2128462,5,B0002W4P8Y,"Nancy Franklin wrote a review of ""The Office Special"" in the New Yorker's October 25th issue, the first sentence of which reads,

""Nobody who has seen the BBC series ""The Office"" has anything bad to say about it, and there's a reason for that: it's perfect.""

I couldn't agree more with her on that count; the first two seasons constitute the best sitcom ever made.  However, proceeds to damn ""The Special"" through faint praise, calling it ""less satisfying"" and saying that Gervais and Merchant ""bowed under the pressure"" to give fans a happy ending.  She concludes the review by saying,

""Still, one can't help wishing that Gervais and Merchant had left well enough...alone.  We needed a sequel to ""The Office"" as much as we need a sequel to ""Pride and Prejudice.""

Franklin is completely wrong in her analysis here, and here's why.  ""The Office Special"" can't be viewed as a ""sequel"" to the original series; it's more of a corollary.

The half-hour episodes of the original series were so compelling because no other work (sidebar: I believe the lofty word ""work"" applies to this stuff) has captured the awful, crushing, dingy mundanity of our lives like ""The Office.""  Enough has been written on that count which doesn't need to be rehashed here.

""The Special,"" on the other hand, accepts those facts, but appends them with this: our real triumps in life come in the face of that very mundanity, and they are the very few, very small moments of joy we manage wrench away from Our Office every now and again.  That sounds sappy in print, but I think it's important to keep in mind as you view (and invariably re-view) ""The Special.""

So what we have here is NOT a sequel, and don't feel guilty about the happy endings.  ""The Office"" as a whole wouldn't be as true to life if it didn't exhibit the little redeeming moments that other reviewers have pointed out here.  The brilliance of ""The Office Special"" is that it shows just how incredible a moment of ""connect"" (a la D.H. Lawrence) can be.  Watch the last ten minutes of ""The Special,"" again and again, as it shows and says all this in a manner that I can't.

2128465,5,B0002W4P8Y,"The Office hit me hard, much to the dismay of my coworkers who had to listen to my analysis of the series ad nauseum. Lots of people have reviewed this series, and I don't think another summary is necessary. But I wanted to offer a slightly different take on why this thing ""got in amongst me"" as much as it did.

For starters, I never thought of this series as a comedy. Yes, it has some very funny moments. (OK, it has some hilarious moments.) But they're not what define this series.

At its core, I think it's about David Brent and Tim Canterbury, two people who are really two sides of a single coin. Superficially, they couldn't be more different. One demands attention, the other shuns it. One is a juvenile and utterly self-deluded egomaniac, while the other is principled and sensitive. But both are finding it impossible to get what they want out of life. They're insecure and frightened, and they wear their dysfunctional personalities like suits of armor. Unfortunately, this comes at a high price. They are being dishonest with themselves and with the other people in their lives. In retaliation, life periodically dishes out humiliation, sort of like the shock the rat gets when he takes the wrong turn in the maze. We're on the wrong path, and Zap, we're not going to be allowed to get away with it.

The other (wonderful) characters in the series exist mainly to put David and Tim in situations that reveal who they are.  We find out that neither Tim nor David seem to respect themselves.  Tim sells out his dream to return to college by staying on the job for a paltry promotion. He eventually refuses a high position, allowing his bizarre desk mate Garreth to get the job instead. David is consumed by jealousy as he sees others (especially his new boss, Neal) getting the respect and success that elude him. But he prances sycophantically around the abusive and hateful Finch, whom he considers a friend.

In each episode David and Tim have failures and crises that seem to happen in parallel.  As David embarrasses himself with his guitar during the staff training day, Tim acts out and ultimately humiliates himself by asking Dawn out at the wrong time.  In the incredible episode in which David gives his horrifically embarrassing comedy welcome to the ""Swindon lot,"" Tim is literally stuck against the wall by Dawn's jealous boyfriend.

Tim wants a relationship, and David wants ego-gratification, and by the final episode Tim has a (great) girlfriend in Rachel, and David has a gig as a motivational speaker.  Both manage to bring these potential successes crashing down.

In this final episode Tim and David each have their one honest moment, but it's too little, too late. Tim, defined by his fear of taking chances, takes the ultimate chance with Dawn. Although the sound is off, we suspect he says those Three Little Words. David, having been scathingly sarcastic and insubordinate to Neal, must beg the man for his job. Sad ironies abound. There are no happy endings.

Now it's Christmas, three years later. Dawn is living in the States with her odious, soul-crushing fianc Lee, who is content to sponge off of his sister and her husband. Tim, having refused David's job, is under the boot of Garreth, and has an even more foul desk mate (Anne) than Garreth was. David sells cleaning supplies, and supplements his income with ""celebrity"" appearances so humiliating that even he can sense it.

Situations develop that threaten to propel David and Tim even deeper into irredeemable despair. David must find a date to bring to the Christmas party, challenged to do so by the recently engaged Neal. Dawn visits the Office for Christmas. Tim must not only face her, but must watch as the last vestiges of her hope for a future in Illustrating are destroyed by Lee.

But it's Christmas, dammit, a time for giving and receiving gifts. David receives a gift from a woman that he has clearly never gotten in his life. Finch notices the change immediately. Tim gives a gift to Dawn in the form of Three Other Little Words. They mean so much to her that they instantly change her life, and, presumably, his.

In these twelve half-hours, Gervais and Merchant demonstrate the consequences of failing to be honest with ourselves. The Christmas special brings it around full circle, and we are shown the path to redemption.

Watch this wonderful series. You could learn something important.",1100131200,123,4404,4.7902374670184695
2128466,5,B0002W4P8Y,"Phenomenal show! There's nothing one can reasonably say, except: See the series!

But two notes: Compare the tasty and ethical way the makers of ""The Office"" went out, to ""Seinfeld,"" ""Friends,"" ""Frazier,"" ad nauseum. Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke in their respective shows also bowed out gracefully at their peak. (If I could have voted to keep MTM on another year or two, I might have, but I would have been wrong.)

2128470,4,B0002W4P8Y,"""The Office"" is one of the most devastatingly real comedies in years, with clueless manager David Brent and his swarm of deadened cubicle workers. But the series ended on a sour note -- receptionist Dawn rejected everyman Tim, ghoulish Gareth became the boss, and boss David ended up ""redundant."" Now, in ""The Office Special,"" Ricky Gervais brings 'em all back for some second chances.

Three years have passed, and the BBC has returned to The Office. Not a lot has changed: Gareth (Mackenzie Crook) is in charge, but wields no power and gets no respect. Tim (Martin Freeman) is still floundering in a dead-end job, and longing after Dawn (Lucy Davis). Dawn has moved to Florida with her fiancee Lee, and is unhappily working for her future sister-in-law. And David Brent (Ricky Gervais) has become an unsuccessful musician/cleaner salesman/Z-list celebrity, who has squandered his severance package on producing a single.

But the filmmakers bring all the people back for a reunion over the holidays, including flying Lee and Dawn back to the UK. David struggles to find a date for the holiday party (with his usual show of unconscious prejudice), and Tim is given one final chance to win his beloved Dawn over. Will Dawn finally choose the man who adores her? Will David find love himself?

A lot of people felt unsatisfied by the dour ending of ""The Office's"" TV run -- it may have been realistic, but it left many viewers as miserable and unfulfilled as Tim was. Now Gervais gives us a different ending -- a much happier one. Even at their most unlikeable and idiotic, it was hard not to like or pity the people in The Office. Even the ridiculous David.

Now Gervais serves up the Special. It's a satisfying one -- for one thing, it resolves the love triangle that tantalized viewers from the beginning of the show. Romantics will be left teary-eyed and smiling, and lovers of realism may be satisfied by the lack of mawkish overemoting. And David -- who started off as an ignorant git, but gradually became pitiable -- finds some sort of contentment.

It's not quite as you'd have it -- Gareth is strangely low-key, considering he was so prominent in the series. And Neil has undergone a bit of a personality shift. But ""The Office Special"" displays what people love best -- the mix of ridiculous and real, with the dull paper company and its frustrated employees. Even though three years have passed, nothing is really different.

Gervais is a comic genius as David -- he still makes idiotically sexist, prejudiced comments and tries to court public adoration, but only makes an idiot of himself. Despite that, his loneliness is striking. Freeman and David are lovely as Tim and Dawn, putting a quiet depth into their sometimes touching, sometimes awkward scenes together.

""The Office Special"" is undeniably the end of the ""Office"" series -- it wraps things up so well that there is nowhere to go after this. The dark comedy of the series is still here, but given a softer edge that fans will love. Pure genius, and hinting at future greatness for Gervais' works.",1097884800,30,3070,4.803030303030303

Like another American reviewer, I was in England when the specials aired (lucky me) and like that reviewer, I wept for joy at the end.  It was hope-giving that David found Carol.  If DAVID BRENT can find someone who seems so wonderful, there's hope for anyone.  I also enjoyed Neil's uncomfortable facial expression when he David brings Carol into the party.  You can see his superiority fading with each second.

It was more than satisfying to see it finally dawn on Dawn what her situation really was, and to see her finally stop fighting and denying what she surely already knew.  To see her surrender to it, turning that car around to go and claim her real life, real love and real happiness.

But perhaps the most satisfying thing to me of all was to see David finally pull his nose out of Finch's arse, get off his knees and tell him what he tells him!  Has Brent finally seen Finch for what he really is?  Or has he always known?  Did it take Carol's kiss to give him the strength to find his own character and step away from his ""friend"" once and for all?  In either case, it was brilliant and perfectly done.

The big Christmas reunion orchestrated for the TV special will be a life-changing event for all three.

This excellent series has always been more than just a brilliant comedy; it is also a closely observed study of self-delusion in many forms, never shying away from the unfortunate consequences.
