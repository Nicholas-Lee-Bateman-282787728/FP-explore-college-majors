6034518,5,B00FWUX94M,"It sounds like a follow-up on the movie  ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". If it is as half as good, It will be super!!",1406160000,,117,3.68
6034519,3,B00FWUX94M,"""A lot of men went through something you can not even begin to imagine."" Eric (Firth) is married to Patty (Kidman) whom he loves and is living a life he can't seem to grasp. When he was a young man in the military him and a group of soldiers were imprisoned as POWs in a Japanese Labor Camp during WWII and forced to work on the Thai/Burma railway. He has become obsessed with trains ever since and relives his torture over and over. When Patti finds out that his captor is still alive she has to choose to tell Eric or not. First I'll start with saying that this is a hard movie to watch. While it is a little slow moving in some spots it also has some pretty intense scenes of torture. Most of it happens off screen but there is enough shown to make you cringe. I was looking forward to seeing this because I have liked the movies like this in the past. Munich I think was the best ""revenge confrontation"" movie even though it technically wasn't about the war aspect. Debt was also very good but was a little slower and had more of a psychological aspect to it. This one continues the trend away from straight ""I'll kill you"" to let's talk first type. This movie is good and worth watching but it does drag in a few parts but the last half hour is great and is really the reason to watch. The entire time you hope Eric gets the revenge he wants but when the time comes you start to second guess what you want for him. The fact that this is a true story really makes this more powerful. Overall, a movie that is good and worth watching but be prepared to struggle for a little while, the last half hour is worth the wait though. I give this a B-.",1404777600,27,1647,4.15
6034520,5,B00FWUX94M,"""The Railway Man"" is the dramatization of the memoir of British Army Lieutenant Eric Lomax, captured by the Japanese at the fall of Singapore in 1942, forced to work on the Burma-Thailand ""death"" railroad along with thousands of his fellow POWs, and made to endure privation and torture at the hands of his brutal Japanese captors. Colin Firth stars as the elder Lomax, whom we meet in middle age, beginning a new marriage and still suffering from acute PTSD. His wife (well-played by Nicole Kidman) is determined to end his suffering. She worms the story of his wartime experiences out of Lomax's former commanding officer Findley, played in the present by Skellan Skarsgard and in the past by Sam Reid. Lomax eventually undertakes a journey to Thailand to confront his past. The lives of the older and younger Lomax are played out in parallel, in a story that is so emotion-charged as to be very tough to watch.

The location shooting in Scotland, and in Thailand is extremely good, as is the recreation of the wartime death railway. A superb performance by Jeremy Irvine as the heroic younger Lomax are matched by the nuanced acting of Hiroyuki Sanada and Tanro Ishida as the older and younger versions of the Japanese Kempetai officer who tortured Lomax. The matchup of the music score and the story is so flawless as to make you forget it's presence. The pacing of the storyline is excellent, as the scenes shift back and forth from Scotland to the Far East and from past to present. The ending is something you have to see. This movie had only a short theater engagement in the United States, competing against the usual summer blockbusters. It is worth tracking down on DVD and is highly recommended.",1403222400,,1707,4.766891891891892
6034521,4,B00FWUX94M,"Sorry, I don't know how those reviews for Whitechapel are listed under The Railway Man, but this is a review of the movie The Railway Man.  It is a superb movie, well done and well acted.  Colin Firth doesn't a fine job portraying a former British Army officer
who was tortured badly at the hands of the Japanese during WW II.  The haunting dreams tear him apart inside and he has escaped inside himself with his hobby of trains.  Not models, but all aspects and schedules of regular trains.  He is on one of these when he meets Nicole Kidman and falls in love.  They wed and it helps for awhile, but she sees the torture that goes through in his dreams and reaches out to his friend Stellan Skarsgard to find out what is happening to him.  She finds out about his war troubles and the terrible things that he refuses to talk about.  He keeps seeing the Japanese officer that he felt was responsible for his tortures.  His friend has located the man and she encourages him to finally confront the main.  This was based on a true story and a successful book.  A very well done drama.",1401235200,34,1082,4.36
6034522,5,B00FWUX94M,"Eric Lomax (Colin Firth) is not ""a train buff"" but a ""railway enthusiast."" While riding the trains he meets the 17 year younger Canadian nurse Patti (Nicole KIdman) which appears to be a love at first sight and hasten marriage. Patti discover Eric has severe PTSD from the time he spent as a POW under the Japanese. He is mentally still fighting the war which has left an ""army of ghosts.""

Much of the film is consumed by Patti attempting to figure out Eric's problem, having to rely on a friend. Discovering that his tormenter is still alive, Patti must decide if Eric should know, not knowing what he might do.

The film was well done, It is based on a true story.and a book by the same title. The film left out some aspects of Eric's life, like the wife he left for Patti.

6034523,5,B00FWUX94M,"If any show deserves credit for breaking free of its original formula and striving to remain fresh and innovative, it's ""Whitechapel"". It began as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-three-part-mini-series/dp/B005G172Q8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a three part mini-series</a>, postulating what it would happen if the contemporary police force had to solve the mystery of Jack the Ripper. Using modern methods and historical precedence, old veteran Ray Miles and inexperienced, overpromoted Joe Chandler put aside their differences in order to hunt a copy-cat killer through the streets of Whitechapel.

Fast-forward to season four, and you'll find that the storylines, format and even the genre has shifted into something quite different. For the first two seasons ""Whitechapel"" was a fairly straightforward crime drama, whereas season three veered more into crime horror, with a range of macabre murders and the barest trace of unexplainable ghostly phenomena at work.

With season four, we've fully entered the Gothic genre, with all the staple characteristics and themes you'd expect: unexplainable supernatural occurrences, loss of identity, the onset of paranoia, the questioning of what's real and what isn't, and a shift away from the usual police procedural to include an added emphasis on each individual in the team as they undergo their own personal hauntings.

The characters are as strong as ever: by now Miles and Chandler have become a tight duo (the former is the only one who can help the latter with his crippling OCD tendencies)  and they're backed up by the over-enthusiastic historian Ed Buchan, who provides unpaid research out of self-importance and sheer love for the investigative process. There's also Kent, a young investigator who may or may not be in love with Chandler, the womanizing and irresponsible Mansell, who begins dating the hitherto unknown twin sister of Kent, and Megan Riley, the only woman on the team who is beginning to feel the strain of balancing work and home, as well as the men's unspoken assumption that she'll automatically be the one to comfort bereaved victims.

There are three cases altogether, each one divided into two episodes. The first has the team discover a tramp who has died as a result of 16th century torture, the peine forte et dure (in which a person is pinned down and has heavy stones piled upon him). This is followed by the discovery of an elderly woman burnt at the stake in her back garden, and the team realize that someone is hunting and executing witches in Whitechapel.

Written by actor Steve Pemberton (who plays Ed Buchan), the second case involves a grisy discovery of flayed skin in a museum, with a murderer who seems to take a certain interest in people who have eluded justice. Finally, the third case has the team in disarray as they uncover a disembodied corpse in the sewage tunnels. More are still to follow, with various organs removed, and it is Buchan who hesitantly suggests the possibility of cannibalism.

But throughout all these episodes is a subtle thread that connects them all, one that takes season four into darker waters than anything we've previously seen. Early on, Chandler is approached by a rouge MI5 agent who insists that all the grisly crimes that take place in Whitechapel have been engineered by a ""provocateur"": a dark force that incites otherwise ordinary people to commit heinous acts against other men and women. Naturally Chandler dismisses this accusation, but the audience is privy to scenes of a recurring figure in the background of certain shots, a little old lady quietly watching and seemingly waiting as the team go about their business. She first appears at a book-signing for Buchan's new book, approaching each member of the team and engaging them in conversation that prys open their deepest fears.

Like a spell has been placed upon them, all five members of the investigative team are beset by anxiety and paranoia, and it's only by pulling together and facing their fears that they have a chance to finally catch the perpetrators.

Between this strain of the supernatural and the grisy nature of the cases, it can make for quite a harrowing viewing experience! Everything is designed to be as creepy and unsettling as possible, from the unexplained scar on an MI5 agent's neck, to the accurate predictions of a police psychic, to the growing sense of demonic powers at work throughout the station.

Of course, some may not like this marked switch into the paranormal. If you were to watch this season immediately after the first, you'd find that it feels like a completely different show, and if there is one unnecessarily element, it's that this season really ramps up the grisliness. Whereas the first season was incredibly restrained in its depiction of death and murder, often implying rather than showing the results that serial killers left in their wake, season four has no qualms about giving the audience lengthy mortuary scenes, grisly slow-motion murder sequences, and plenty of slow-motion pans over blood and gore. Heck, even the bursting of a pus-filled blister is shot in extreme close-up. It gets a bit much sometimes and is certainly not for the squeamish.

But I applaud the writers and producers for realizing that the show's initial premise (copy-cat killings) had a limited shelf-life and that they weren't afraid to take their storylines and characters into very different territory. Sadly, it would seem that this is to be the final season of ""Whitechapel"", with ITV declining to commission any further episodes.

That it all ends on something of cliff-hanger may frustrate many, especially since the element of the paranormal (and more importantly, the team's *realization* of its existence) served to re-galvanise the show and promise a range of new supernaturally-themed cases for the future. Hopefully the Powers That Be will realize their mistake and at least give the writers a chance to wrap things up properly in one last mini-series. If it ends like this it'll be on a suitably eerie note, but there are still plenty of plot-threads left dangling, and the actors especially deserve some sense of closure on such compelling and likeable characters.

Also keep in mind that this is a British show, so check the region of the DVDs before purchasing anything.",1385510400,,6364,5.161008729388943
6034524,5,B00FWUX94M,"Note - when written this product included a season of Whitechapel and sweets.  This seems to have been changed subsequently by the supplier.  Hence the review of Whitechapel below!

This is a review of Whitechapel as, except for saying that Cornish sweets are usually good, I cannot add much about them!  Potential purchasers should note that these are Region 2 (European Format) DVDs and are not going to work for you unless you have a Region 2 or Region Free DVD player.

If ever a successful TV programme had to keep reinventing itself it is Whitechapel as anyone who has seen the previous seasons will appreciate. To its credit, we are now on the fourth series and each has been fascinating as a study in the dark side of human behavior. The first two series were about Jack the Ripper and the Kray Twins respectively, which are the only two crimes which most would associate with the Whitechapel area of London. We then moved on to two part stories for the third series, based on historical crimes which would not be widely known, but nonetheless were true crimes, details of which could easily be googled.

This series, however, again consists of 3 two part stories but these are based on rather gruesome crimes with medieval overtones of torture, rather than specific historical crimes, although Buchan usually manages to come up with some precedents. For example, the second tale which was probably the grisliest, involved a series of murders where the murderer specialized in flaying the faces from the bodies of his victims. This series is, on balance, probably a little more gruesome than what went before and there are definite supernatural overtones which were not present in previous series. It certainly retains the ability to shock and makes for dark but absorbing viewing.

Rupert Penry-Jones and Philip Davis are convincing DI Chandler and DS Miles, although their relationship remains less than harmonious on occasion since they are often not on the same wavelength. However, in many ways they do complement each other. Chandler himself often appears on the edge and at times close to a breakdown. Edward Buchan, played by Steve Pemberton, is the expert in historical crimes who is usually able to come up with the historical parallels which help to solve the crimes.

I imagine that Whitechapel is set to be with us for some while which is really good news. Dark it certainly is and probably not for the squeamish, but it all makes for great entertainment.",1382054400,3,2476,4.878571428571429

6034542,4,B00FWUX94M,"Colin Firth is Eric Lomax, a railway enthusiast who charms Nicole Kidman into marrying him. Unfortunately he is still beset my nightmares of his time as a POW of the Japanese and his PTSD threatens his marriage. Then the opportunity arises to return to Asia and seek justice from the Japanese officer who tortured him. This allows for a remarkable human story to take place.

On one side, this movie has a real charm to it. The older Lomax is engaging and it appears, quite the catch. However the scenes of his wartime treatment are pretty harrowing and definately not for the squeamish. Its important to note that the scenes shown are representative of the way Western POWs were treated. Indeed, things could get much worse. It was a brutal clash of cultures and left a bitter legacy into the current century. It is to the film makers immense credit, that the horrors of the Burma-Thai railway have been shown to the extent they have here. So, it is an important, informative film in this historical context.

The beauty of the film is the redemption that Lomax achieved. This is touch-and-go but his basic humanity triumphs, to his great advantage. After the viciousness, the gentleness of the resolution is wonderful. The fact it is essentially a true story adds to this. Indeed, you are likely to want to read more about Eric Lomax after.

6034552,5,B00FWUX94M,"This film is a didactic dramatization of a difficult and painful real life experience of the traumas of war.  The film is also a powerful and extremely effective film about penitence, compassion, and forgiveness, qualities which are rare and difficult to either express or achieve.

This film lasts 108 minutes.  One has to watch the traumatic first 100 minutes to fully understand and appreciate the powerful and cathartic final few minutes.  The penitence portion came first, contributing to the compassion and forgiveness that follows.

In the film, a now disillusioned, former Japanese officer says to his wartime victim, ""We were lied to"" - which as a historian, I knew was true, that the militarist Japanese government lied on a colossal scale to the Japanese population for much of WWII, about the disastrous turn of the war against Japan.  That deceit is depicted in a few second clip toward the end of the film; in the few seconds I saw that clip, which occurred during an indoor torture session, my perspective of the Japanese officer significantly changed.  Who - including a possible Buddhist - wants to abuse an ""enemy"" when lied to by one's own government?

Speaking from a Japanese ethos, the Japanese officer also says to his wartime victim, who had been a POW in Japanese captivity, ""You NEVER surrendered.""

The flashbacks in the initial part of the film include a sequence when the British military take control of the Japanese POW camp at the end of the war.  The British are asking each Japanese prisoner ""Are you Kempeitai?""  The Kempeitai was the infamous and brutal Japanese secret military police, who were responsible for the administration of POW camps.  When the Kempeitai Japanese officer is asked this question, he denies  that he is Kempeitai, and says he was only a ""translator.""  By this denial, the audience believes that this rat is a double rat, denying his own identity to escape responsibility.  So, one is misled to believe that this same ex-Japaneses Kempeitai officer will act the same way when he is is confronted, alone, in private, by his victim decades after the end of the war.  The surprise is, he doesn't.

During the war, this Japanese Kempeitai officer conducts himself toward British POWs in accord with the Japanese code of Bushido.  When confronted, alone, in private, after the war - following decades of his own reflection - by his wartime victim, this Japanese Kempeitai officer obediently submits, without protest, to his victims demands, thereby judging in retrospect his own wartime actions by that same code of Bushido.

Forgiveness and penitence appear to be such exceedingly rare events in life, which makes the film's message so vitally important - forgiveness anywhere, anytime, for anything.

At the time I post my review of this film, there are only a paltry 375 ""customer reviews"" posted on Amazon.  However, the message of this film is so exceedingly important, and so effectively expressed, that the film deserves to be viewed and appreciated by the largest possible audience.

One possible problem with widespread ""popular"" viewing of this film, however, is that people must first view those ""preparatory"" 100 minutes - 100 minutes of a small portion of the Japanese ""infamy"" in WWII.

Caveat:  This film is about the same ""Death Railway"" depicted in THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, although the depiction in the BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is tame by comparison. The depiction of the ""Death Railway"" in RAILWAY MAN is much closer to the truth.  The ""Death Railway"" was intended to exterminate allied POWs, which were primarily British POWs.  The death toll of Allied POWs was horrific.",1471305600,,3651,5.003311258278146

6034623,4,B00FWUX94M,"Americans are great at forgive and forget. All is forgiven and forgotten as soon as the war is over. Enemies became friends overnight and Americans couldn't go help them fast enough. The next generation couldn't care less about what happened before they were born.

But for many victims of atrocity, it is not so easy. This movie, a true story, showed the ugly nightmare of lingering pain. More importantly, it show the bumpy way to forgive and forget. To really forgive and let go the pain, the victim must get an apology from the enemy. To be truly forgiven and absolved of the crime, the enemy must sincerely apologize to the victim and repent. Germans had known that and have been apologizing nonstop since 1945. And the Jews would never let them forget. But, the Japanese had never acknowledged their war crimes much less apologize. In fact, they proudly kept their absolute loyalty to their emperor and their code of silence. They still consider their sacrifice to their lost cause a noble deed. The Japanese government even dared twice to whitewash history and tried to deny they had invaded Asia or committed unspeakable atrocities. No peep came from America. But Asians were up in arms and the Japanese had to back down.

Glad the British are not so quick to forgive and forget. Because they were so quick at surrendering without any attempt at fighting, the Japanese despised them and treated the POWs with contempt. Many suffered greatly in Japanese hands. This movie is made more powerful because it is a true story and is made by a new generation 70 years after the war had ended.

Collin Firth, always a great actor, did not disappoint. His agony burned through the screen. Nicole Kidman is nice eye candy. The editing is a bit confusing at times and interrupted the story flow. But the end is worth waiting for. Forget those shallow Hollywood trivial attempts. Watch this one!",1432857600,,1891,4.776758409785932
6034624,4,B00FWUX94M,I liked this movie. Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman did a good job.,1432598400,,65,4.076923076923077
6034625,3,B00FWUX94M,"It is odd how we in ""The West"" & especially here in the US seek to reduce or trivialize actions that took/take place against our servicemen/women & civilians abroad during wartime & otherwise.  Relative to WWII & the Pacific Theater of War, former POWs have long sought ... something relative to the injustices suffered @ the hands of the Japanese.  In fact, it has long been the policy of the US governments to not only not assist veterans & civilians in these efforts but to put up road blocks in the path of those seeking so much as apologies/acknowledgement of wrongdoing.  Then there is the staunch resistance of, in particular, Japanese Corporations to admit wrong doing.

The movie demonstrated how time could not heal the PTSD suffered by a specific service member of the British Empire in Singapore, ""The Gibraltar of the East"" when a Japanese force ~ 1/3 its size checkmated leaving the British Empire no options to maneuver.  Thus the largest # of Empire soldiers ever was taken prisoner.  These numbers were bolstered by significant numbers of reinforcements many landing as the force was surrendering.  Further, these troops had no grasp of exactly how Japanese refusal to sign Geneva accords as well as the Japanese being overwhelmed by the sheer number of POW.

I've not yet seen a film able to accurately portray the accounts POWs of ""Western Powers"" suffered @ the hands of the Japanese who, by the way, had gone through a dramatic transformation merely in how they ""cared"" for POWs during WWI compared to WWII.  For example, in WWII,  Japanese used a system of l slow starvation to weaken & eventually cause the deaths of both prisoners & civilians alike (not unlike atrocities carried out by Nazi Germany or the USSR).  There was almost an utter lack of medical care.  Mind you these are the general conditions under which all prisoners suffered.

Then the sadistic stuff... beatings, often to death, breaking bones that under such conditions take far longer to mend, are unlikely to mend correctly than we might expect.  There were hackings, bayoneting & of course decapitations often w/o cause.  Then hell ships moving POWs to the home islands to perform slave labor for various of Japanese corporation.

My biggest criticism of this movie & many others is that water torture performed is more akin to those CIA interrogation tactics declassified.  Not a good day, I'll admit but a far cry from the water torture performed by the Japanese in WWII.  Therein was performed a variation of what was once referred to as ""Chinese Water Torture"".  This wasn't just the perception of torture but was torture in it's cruelest forms

The Water torture applied to Japanese ministered POWs consisted of (1) a hose being jammed down the victims throat while he/she lay on their back; (2) the stomach fills with water until utterly engorged & the abdomen distended; (3) Once so, the victim was beaten, stomped & jumped on top.  OUTCOME:  excruciating pain, fatal internal injuries, causing the abdomen to burst open like a water balloon obviously leading to death.

As for forgiveness, I believe in the utter necessity of forgiveness both offered & sought.  Forgiveness is not about changing the other but rather oneself.  We must recognize events for what they are, then make decisions re: forgiveness.  If we can, if able to truly do so I believe it opens one's eyes to world's otherwise unavailable.

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit together at the table of brotherhood.

6034626,5,B00FWUX94M,"I just saw this movie on Showtime. It is about what really happened at ""The Bridge Over the River Kwai."" Not the fictional account of that famous 1950s movie with Alec Guinness, Bill Holden et al, in which the unspeakable horrors inflicted on British POWs building that bridge were somehow transformed into an ordeal suffered mainly by the British POW commandant. Pure fiction. And detested for many decades by the surviving prisoners and their families.

This movie is the real deal--the true story of Eric Lomax, who survived the horror to write a book about it. It is also about the ultimate befriending and forgiveness of his Japanese torturer, in a very moving final scene on location, on the actual roadway cut by the prisoners through solid rock with hand tools--a place where many died. I have seen this location previously in a war documentary.

6034667,3,B00FWUX94M,"Quite a bit of anglo prejudice
While the dramatic performances are quite good, it is also worth noting that this is a rather biased view, typical of a US/US/AU production.  Interestingly, the interrogation methods shown in the movie are have now been ""declared legal"" by the US and are in daily use by the CIA.  While personal experience such as that depicted may me deplorable, I fail to understand the demand for repeated Japanese apologises in the absence of any regret for the deliberate murder of of hundreds of thousands (cumulatively more than a million) women, children, and elderly in cities such as Dresden, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki (in the full knowledge that there were neither any military presence worthy of note nor even any substantial number of males of military age).

As with most, if not all, US/US/AU movies on this subject, race plays a major role in determining who was right or wrong. Nor has anyone ever mentioned the enslavery of a 100,000 Japanese POWs by the Soviets (US allies) AFTER the end of the war, with less than 10% surviving to return to Japan following several years of hard labor. So pardon me if I don't feel especially sorry for the protagonist in this movie.",1424131200,,1199,4.782608695652174

6034682,5,B00FWUX94M,"After months of gearing up to view and then review the Jolie film ""Unbroken,"" about ""Lucky Louie"" Zamperini, I now feel that movie can wait and I'll review this one instead. Set in early 1980s England, ""The Railway Man"" tells of Eric Lomax, a former British POW forced into slave labor on the Thai-Burmese railway project (AKA ""the Death Railway""). This included much of what Alistair Urquhart reported in his gut-wrenching book, ""The Forgotten Highlander,"" and also depicted in the 1957 Best Picture, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai."" Less sanitized than ""Bridge,"" ""Railway Man"" shows forlorn and enslaved officer POWs, as well as Lomax, a geeky lieutenant and train enthusiast, who was savagely beaten for constructing a radio receiver (without transmitter), so that he might hear Allied reports about the true progress of the war.

Where the film ""Unbroken"" ends, this one picks up with Colin Firth as the lonely, aging Lomax. A mature, if younger, woman (Nicole Kidman) enters his life and Lomax decides that love is worth the risk. However, years of stuffing his PTSD can no longer be kept at bay and Lomax spins out of control. His new wife tries to save their marriage by encouraging him to open up and resolve his distress. An opportunity arises for him to return to Japan and possibly meet one of his former captors. Wanting to face down his inner demons, Lomax travels to Japan.

For Lomax, what ultimately transpires is redemption in its purest sense. Unlike Zamperini's failure with ""the Bird,"" Lomax meets one-on-one with his former tormenter, Takashi Nagase, and after much turmoil, decides to take the high road. By this, Lomax grows in generosity of heart and lifts up his remorseful opponent too. Recognizing that both were victims, a bond is forged. There are no real winners in modern warfare, just survivors. In the face of great adversity, some of the most wounded people have gone on to become great souls, like Nelson Mandela. Although less celebrated, Eric Lomax came a long way too. As did Louis Zamperini. Having a faith that bore fruit in redemption had much to do with it. Fr. Dennis",1420675200,8,2109,4.871866295264624

The director did a wonderful job building and finishing the story. It made me wonder why it wasn't a huge theatrical success.  There are plenty of war films around, I liked that this one showed the aftermath of the traumas of war. It gave me a renewed repect for men and women who served in war time in those generations.

6034717,4,B00FWUX94M,"Taken from Eric Lomax's own book, ""The Railway Man"" tells the story of the Englishman's captured by the Japanese during World War II.  The film opens in 1980 where Eric (Colin Firth) struggles with post-traumatic stress some 35 years after the war's end.  Fascinated by trains his whole life, he meets future wife Patti (Nicole Kidman) while travelling by train to seemingly nowhere in particular.

Before you know it, the couple are hitched and soon after Eric's debilitation becomes worse, with agonizing nightmares and convolutions.  He refuses to talk about his war experiences, even with his wife who is desperate to help.  She finally confronts an old war buddy (Stellan Skarsgard), who tells her the story of their captivity in Thailand.  The film splits time between the present, as the mentally unstable Eric becomes driven to kill his old tormenter, who is still alive, and scenes of Eric's torturous time in the jungles of Asia.

Both Firth and Jeremy Irvine as the young Eric provide terrific performances.  As memories of his capture and a ""translator,"" named Takeshi Nagase, become obsessive, Eric decides to return to Thailand and confront his old captor.  The older Nagase is played perfectly by Hiroyuki Sanada.  The film is agonizing at both ends of the time span as we see the effects of war, compounded by capture and torture.  The true events provide an alternate take on the building of the railroad to Burma as opposed to the classic film ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957).  The final confrontation between Lomax and Nagase provide a tense but highly satisfactory conclusion to the story.

The Blu ray version of this film is truly a treat when it comes to the sound and video.  Using a 1080p video encoding, the film maintains the original 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The colors are robust and overall, nearly perfect.  Plenty of blood and jungle greenery are honestly depicted.  Black levels are excellent.  The picture is clear and clean throughout with virtually no imperfections that I could detect.  The film has a full array of sound and they are well displayed on the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  The environmental noises range from the surf in England to the ambient jungle sounds of Thailand.  There are numerous surround opportunities including some raging war footage and rumbling trains.  Everything comes across clean and clear.  Extras include a fine commentary track by director Jonathan Teplitzky and co-screenwriter/producer Andy Paterson as well as a 26 minute ""making of"" featurette.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.",1417392000,3,2580,5.059241706161138

I would not want to say anything that might amount to a spoiler regarding where the story ultimately takes you.  The ending of the film flat-out blew my away, partially because it was somewhat unexpected.  The odd thing was that I thought I knew where the whole thing was headed.  In a way, it led to the very conclusion that I was anticipating, but it was the way the whole matter was handled that left me frozen in my chair, thunderstruck, more deeply moved than I could have imagined.  The torture, although not gory, or exceptionally explicit, is harrowing.  I recommend that you sit tight and endure the ordeal.  You will be well rewarded for your patience.

6034731,5,B00FWUX94M,"This is the third film made dealing with an aspect of surviving the Thai-Burma Death Railway built by prisoners of war in 1942. This film starts out slow as the hero falls in love and his new wife finds he is battling an old hatred and fears from his days on the railway and his torture. The man is almost obsessed with railways and their operation. He drew a map of the Thai-Burma Railroad based on what he had seen traveling up from Malaysia and what he learned about what the Japanese were attempting to build. He was a radio operator, and helped with hiding and maintaining a secret radio. The Japanese found the railroad map and the radio and tortured him to find out who he was contacting and how he had known about the details to draw such a map. The Japanese interpreter who was part of his torture finally understood that the prisoner did not contact anyone as it was a radio receiver and that it was his interest in railroads that drove him to draw the map. In the film and the book the prisoner makes a journey to Thailand to revisit the scene of his imprisonment and there he meets the Japanese soldier who has been trying to repay for his role in the terrible treatment of the prisoners. It does end with some sense of relief for both as they understand each other and agree that revenge is not the answer. The film does not try to do a thorough study of the Thai-Burma Railroad, but it is a piece that helps give the terrible story a human face and the efforts to forget and forgive a truly wonderful message. Other films a person might watch are the 1957 Bridge on the River Kwai and The War to End All Wars that came out a couple of years ago. If you travel to Thailand this is certainly a portion of the northwestern portion of Thailand worth visiting as the train runs every day over a portion of the route that these men built more than 70 years ago.",1416182400,3,1869,4.2824858757062145

6034743,2,B00FWUX94M,"While finely acted, the journey of revenge that Eric Lomax takes in the film is fictionalized for dramatic effect. It paints Lomax as a man driven mad by a desire for revenge, and Takashi as his brutal tormentor. Neither of which was true. The movie as such, does neither of these men any justice, as it tells a fictionalized journey of revenge and cowardice. It takes more bravery and inner strength to atone for ones sins and forgive than to seek revenge, which is the true story of both these men. Lomax was traumatized by his experiences, and did indeed want to seek revenge for the torture he received at the hands of the kempetai for many years after, but he began to change his thinking after reading Takashi's memoir Crosses and Tigers. In it Takashi detailed the traumatic effects the war had on him, and how it was his life's mission to find forgiveness for his actions. Takashi was a mere interpreter, and not a violent interrogator, as the movie makes him out to be. But being witness to and complicit in torture, he was unable to live in peace with himself. He went on to build a Buddhist temple in Thailand to the memory of those his fellow countrymen killed on the Railway of Death, spending much of his own money and time helping those in Thailand and educating his fellow countrymen to the dangers of militarism. Lomax found him through his (Takashi's) public efforts. Both men met on friendly terms, and worked through their past traumas together, Lomax forgiving Takashi and setting him free from his own mental prison. This in a sense also freed Lomax, and allowed him to find a sense of calm after years of needing to find answers. Theirs is the true journey of forgiveness. The movie strips these men of all of this. Read their books first (The Railway Man and Crosses and Tigers), watch the movie for the drama.",1415491200,4,1834,4.594512195121951

The story of a emotionally tortured POW is also solid. It's true, moving, gritty, and like life, is not particularly pretty.

So, why does feel like it fell short of the mark?

It all comes together.....don't read long reviews here, as they have spoilers. People aren't professional critics here, and they reveal too much plot and ending. This is quality stuff, and you will be strongly affected by the ending. I would say, though, that the titles did not have to tell you the film is based on a true story. They could have saved it for end.
And one more thing...we've done some of the same things to people.
As Eisenhower said, Beware the military industrial complex. The...""acquisition of unwarranted influence."" The ""danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.""
Makes me wonder sometime, just how information is biased by the military before it reaches the president. Why, for instance, did ISIS make it so far, and accumulate so much power and wealth, when it isn't even a country. It had no infrastructure or technology, or banks...but now it controls vast areas, and has taken out banks and accumulated vast wealth. Sounds like something most countries like to do. So, how, or why were they able to do this...with our technology, how did ISIS make all these moves without our knowledge? It starts to seem like our military did know about this...and waited till it forced us to return...an extortion method. It makes me wonder how the military fed information to Johnson during Vietnam. What are they telling Obama that keeps him from closing Guantanamo? Why aren't I married to Ann Margaret? Who took the last of my Mint Milanos?",1412899200,3,1710,4.879725085910653

6034783,5,B00FWUX94M,"Almost 150 reviews for this movie at the time that I am writing this review, but I think more can be said, as the plot and historical context of this film have so many layers. These aspects initially drew me to the movie because (as I most recently commented in my review of ""Prague Winter: A Personal Story of Remembrance and War, 1937-1948"" by Madeleine Albright) my Donauschwaben (Danube Swabian) family faced confiscation of property, expulsion to concentration camps and labor camps, and murder by government forces in Yugoslavia immediately following World War II. These events are largely unknown to the world for various reasons, and although the events surrounding this movie are much more widely known, awareness and understanding of the atrocities committed during this time period simply need to be more pervasive lest the world wish to continue to repeat history.

While I understand some of the reviewers here in saying that the protagonist of this movie, Eric Lomax, did not actually participate in physical labor like the 180 thousand Asian forced laborers and 60 thousand Allied prisoners of war working on the 258-mile long Thai-Burma Railway north of the Malay Peninsula (over 100 thousand of whom lost their lives during its construction), for me it is really the relationship between these events and the lifelong struggles and eventual forgiveness displayed by Eric which provides the impact of the story that is so powerful. And unless you have the time to read the original book, I highly recommend a watching of the bonus feature called ""The Making of The Railway Man"" on the DVD. As an individual not typically fond of this type of feature, I think that the 26 minute duration was well spent, which goes into more detail on the historical context of the film, including original footage.

In this feature, actor Colin Firth, who plays Eric Lomax in the film, makes an especially important comment not typically exhibited in the mainstream media: ""It's not part of the history narrative we normally get through schools and that sort of thing. It does not make it into the mainstream big war adventure movies of World War II which tend to focus on the European wars or the North African wars and that sort of thing, apart from things like 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'. I mean it's a wonderful film in its way, but it doesn't really tell this story. And so I knew about it as something which somehow had the lid kept on it."" Well said. And regardless of your preconceived notions of Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman, who play starring roles in this film, the sensitivity displayed by both is commendable alongside their acting prowess.",1412467200,3,2657,4.876106194690266

6034802,1,B00FWUX94M,"The Railroad Man:"" the movie about the POW Experiences of Lomax, a soldier in the British Army, who worked on the Thai-Burma Railroad. In the beginning of the movie, we view his bouts with PTSD and, through his flashbacks, we watch the indescribable and violent experiences he endured in the hands of the Kempeitai and the Japanese Army. Aside from the fact that this Kempeitai officer taunted him for not committing suicide when the British surrendered in Singapore, this Kempeitai Officer decided not to commit suicide, himself. Furthermore, to save himself from War Crimes indictments, he also lied about his role with the Kempeitai, telling the British and Australians who captured him, he was only a benign translator. Many years after the war, this Kempeitai Officer becomes the curator of the POW Museum in the original spot where the Kempeitai held their chambers of horrors. Mr. Lomax then decides to go back to Thailand to face and kill the Kempeitai Officer who caused him and mates this indescribable pain and suffering. Mr. Lomax's initial intent was to, first, torture him, as he himself was tortured, and then kill this murdering subhuman-animal. After confronting this sub-human-sociopath, Mr. Lomax decided not to hurt and kill this subhuman-animal. The movie then takes a turn for the worse. The movie tells us that both these men have suffered so much since the end of the war, Mr. Lomax for the physical and psychological tortures he endured, as well as witnessing the brutal murders of hundreds of his mates, and the Kempeitai, also suffered because of all the tortures he administered and murders he committed. The movie wants us to believe that the perpetrators of atrocities suffer as much as the recipients. The climax of the movie is a dramatic scene where they heal each other through forgiveness, atonement and reconciliation. I was so looking forward to watching the former Kempeitai's violent demise at the hands Mr. Lomax. It was not to be. I was very disappointed. It ruined what could have been a great movie. We are told that after their mutual forgiveness, atonement and reconciliation, not only were both men healed from their past, but they become best friends until their recent deaths: 2011 for the Kempeitai and 2012 for Mr. Lomax. My final comment on this movie is simply, I find nothing wrong with Mr. Lomax forgiving this sub-human-animal. If, as Mr. Lomax says, it healed him from the anxiety attacks, flashbacks and insomnia, then I am happy. I do wish to caution that Mr. Lomax's forgiveness is only for himself and for no one else. He does not have the moral authority or any other sense of authority to forgive this Kempeitai sub-human, or the Japanese, for his mates, especially the ones that this sub-human sociopath brutally murdered. I have known and still know POWs and civilian victims of the Japanese who are quite happy living the rest of the lives hating and never forgiving the Japanese. Forgiving the Japanese may have healed Mr. Lomax, but for others this forgiveness is nauseatingly repugnant.",1411430400,8,3054,4.966796875

6034821,4,B00FWUX94M,"Beautifully acted movie on PTSD--with the trauma having been from World War II and the Japanese prison camps, not more recent wars. Colin Firth, Nicole Kidman, Jeremy Irving, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Tanroh Ishida, do a marvelous job. The only actor whose presence seemed odd, even jarring, was Stellan Skarsgard--he's a great actor, but not in the least convincing as a Briton.

The movie has been criticized for being too sentimental and having too cloying a message--but, since it's a true story, that criticism makes next to no sense. Furthermore, the end of the movie, and the message embedded in it, are worth repeating, even if not unexpected.

I had no difficulty following the swift cutting between the wartime jungles of Asia and the c. 1980s period of Britain--another complaint unfairly leveled at director Teplitzky.

I found watching the torture sequences harrowing to watch, which is as it should be.",1410739200,4,911,5.100671140939597

6034823,4,B00FWUX94M,"""The Railway Man"" (2013 release; 108 ,in.) brings to the screen, ""based on a true story"" we are reminded as the movie opens, the life experiences of Eric Lomax. When the movie opens, we are in ""England, 1980"", where Lomax, a railway enthusiast, makes the acquaintance of a woman named Patti on the train to Scotland. In a whirlwind courting, Lomax and Patti fall in love, and get married. It isn't long before Patti notices that Lomax has nightmares about his combat during WWII. The movie then jumps to ""Singapore, 1942"", where we get to know the young Lomax and his mates. As it happens, they surrender to the Japanese and are brought to a forced labor camp, where the scene isn't, shall we say, pretty. What really happened to Lomax in that labor camp? Will Lomax try and run away? What happened to the Japanese that ran the labor camp after the war? Will Lomax open up to Patti about what happened to him during WWII? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is based on the autobiography of Eric Lomax, who is portrayed in the movie by Colin Firth. Firth mostly did a great job, although he looked a bit young to me (in 1980, Lomax had to have been at least 60 years old, given we see him in WWII). There is also a great understated/restrained performance from Nicole Kidman as Patti, the loving wife who so desperately wants to help Lomax with his WWII demons, The movie is directed by Australian director Jonathan Teplitzky, whom I had not heard of before. Teplitzky brings the movie in a heavy-handed manner, as if we don't realize ourselves that this is a ""serious"" movie with a ""serious "" topic. All the Japanese are portrayed in the same way: sadistic, over-bearing, and screaming orders at the top of their longs, no seriously. It's only in the last 20-25 minutes that I really felt an emotional connection with the main characters, and that is a shame as of course in and of itself this IS an amazing story. At the conclusion of the movie, we get to see some pictures of the real people involved (Lomax and Patti, and a few others), and then the movie finally hits home.

I missed the movie when it played briefly at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati earlier this year, so when I noticed it was out on DVD, I eagerly picked this up. While certainly not a bad movie, ""The Railway Man"" didn't quite meet the high expectations I had for this, but I might suggest you check this out for yourself and draw your own conclusion.",1410652800,,2550,4.493534482758621
6034824,5,B00FWUX94M,"This is not an easy story at all. You'll need something clean to wipe your eyes. This is about the very worst things that happen to people in a war. They try to kill each-other. And this story is about two of three of the survivors of a prison-camp. It was a prison-camp where the prisoners built railroads for the Japanese in the south Pacific. The history of these few plays-out in ever expanding flash-backs to the tropical island prison camp and jungle railroad where they spent their time during the war. The story
(from an autobiography written by one of the survivors), has some surprising plot-twists. After two-dozen years of marital counseling and group-therapy, the main character is suddenly presented with the opportunity to exact his revenge upon the Japanese officer who caused him to be tortured during the war. As the story is told, the viewer can plainly see what any fool can clearly see is obviously righteous come-uppance...  ...-except for one except-...  ...our survivor has a change of heart.
The very least of all probable choices you could reasonably expect ANY other man to make,...and NOW you have a story to tell.

Nicole Kidman, who has decidedly not impressed me in the past, was believable and sympathetic in her role, a tribute perhaps to her ability to also grow as an actor.

I was initially saddened at the fact that a movie like this stays only briefly in the public theaters, but I've come to realize that the megaplex, with its over the top cacophonous assault on all the senses and preference for the attention-deficit audience seeking the next violent collision or de-humanizing flesh exposure, is no place for a movie like this.

I agree with others who have pointed out that the only slice of interest is the final confrontation between former enemies--and even that encounter isn't really as exciting as it could have been.  One should keep in mind that the Japanese wartime prison camp scenario has been visited countless times in other films and so the Deja vu factor is high and contributes mightily to viewer boredom and a dearth of excitement.",1409097600,2,659,4.918918918918919

6034880,5,B00FWUX94M,"`Sometime the hating has to stop' - a phrase uttered by Eric Lomax in this compelling film about WW II: if only we could all repeat that phrase throughout the world everyday by everyone.

Director Jonathan Teplitzky has created a monument against war in THE RAILWAY MAN based on the book by Eric Lomax (`Enemy, My Friend?') and adapted for the screen by Frank Cottrell Boyce and Andy Paterson. It is a brilliantly conceived and acted and presented cinematic version of a true story about a British army officer Eric Lomax (Colin Firth/Jeremy Irvine) who was captured by the Japanese during the fall of Singapore in 1942. He and thousands of others were forced to build the Burma-to-Siam railroad. Lomax was fascinated with railroads and that in part (and the fact that he had built a radio to hear what was happening in the rest of the world while he and his mates were held as POWs in a Japanese prison camp) was the reason he was singled out for torture - a torture under the direction of the Japanese translator Takeshi Nagase (Hiroyuki Sanada/Tanroh Ishida).

The autobiography works so well because of many factors - the back and forth telling of the story in modern times and in 1942 as filmed in Scotland and Thailand, the equally brilliant performances of the older and younger Lomax and the older and younger Nagase, the manner in which the undoing of the mind of Lomax is handled by Lomax's wife Patti (the always superb Nicole Kidman) and the support of Lomax closest friend Finlay (Stellan Skarsgrd/Sam Reid) when it is discovered that Lomax's arch enemy Nagase is still alive, working as a tour guide of the very camp where Lomax was tortured (Nagase remains deeply concerned about his actions in the war and is now working toward reconciliation). It is Lomax's trip back to the scene of his lasting mental anguish and confronting Nagase that is the most moving. (Nagase: `You are a soldier, Lomax. You never surrendered.' Eric: `I'm still at war.') But it also is made more deeply moving by the musical score by David Hirschfelder and the cinematography by Garry Phillips and a truly impressive supporting cast.

Twice in the film a poem written by Eric Lomax is spoken:

At the beginning of time the clock struck one
Then dropped the dew and the clock struck two
From the dew grew a tree and the clock struck three
The tree made a door and the clock struck four
Man came alive and the clock struck five
Count not, waste not the years on the clock
Behold I stand at the door and knock.

If only everyone could see this moving study of how war affects us all perhaps we could stop the madness. Or as Lomax states, `Sometime the hate has to stop. Grady Harp, August 14",1408752000,3,2680,4.598326359832636

Scotsman Eric Lomax DOB 1919 was an engineer, radio and railway enthusiast. As therapy for slave labor torture on the Kanchanaburi Thailand Burma Death Railway in 1942, 23 year old Eric Lomax detailed his memories during the ship ride home, which he published&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Railway-Man-A-POW-s-Searing-Account-of-War-Brutality-and-Forgiveness/dp/039334407X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Railway Man: A POW's Searing Account of War, Brutality and Forgiveness</a>&nbsp;in 1995 at age 76. For decades Lomax continually experienced night terrors of being dragged back into the torture room at Hellfire Pass.

Lomax kept lists of Allied and Japanese he suspected of being responsible for revealing he built a radio and sketched a map of the Death Railway crossing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bridge-on-the-River-Kwai-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B0017OB12O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bridge on the River Kwai (Two-Disc Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray</a>]. The lists were tacked on his home studio wall. Lomax refused director and actors access to his studio during the 2012 filming until Colin Firth insisted he needed to know in order to portray this quiet private man accurately.

Lomax decided to kill Kempeitai Secret Service translator Takeshi Nagase an educated man for his torture. Lomax readies a knife, memorizes the anatomy of the neck, muscles vertebrae arteries. He practices on animals. Lomax and his fellow POW meet regularly to be among those who share memories of the unspeakable. The retained structure of military hierarchy allows the POWs to contain some emotion and survive but not thrive. Stellan Skarsgard's Finlay character explains ""We don't love. We don't sleep. We don't live. . . . We are an army of ghosts.""

Lomax meets Patti on a trainspotting journey in 1981. He divorces his first wife and marries Patti during a brief respite from his continual nightmares. On their wedding day the night terrors return. Patti is a 20 year veteran nurse. Through Patti's investigation into why Eric has devolved into this unfamiliar personality, she encourages Eric to face his anger, vindictiveness, paranoia which incarcerate him away from intimacy with her and his passion for electronics which are banned from his studio. Eric explained to the director ""I am allergic to radios.""

Patti discovers an empty bedroom in their home with a packed suitcase on the bed, ready for Eric to depart at any moment. Eric wrote a poem, a meditation for escape from the suffering of retained anger:

From the beginning of time the clock struck One
A drop of dew, and the clock struck Two
From the dew grew a tree, and the clock struck Three
Then the tree made a door, and the clock struck Four
Then man came alive, and the clock struck Five
Count not, waste not the hours on the clock
Behold I stand at the door and Knock.

In response to interrogative torture, Eric spoke only truth. The Japanese could not comprehend an obsession with trains as adequate explanation for drawing a map, and wanting to hear outside news as a reason for building a radio.

Lomax was captured soon after his arrival in Singapore. He harbored no guilt for any of his own actions. His PTSD was uncontaminated by ruminative remorse over his own behavior.

Finlay discovers a newspaper article about Nagase with a photo. Nagase is currently giving tours of Hellfire Pass and the Kanchanaburi Death Railway museum. Eric is the only one of the POW who has a support, Patti who wants him to return to flourishing by facing his nightmares. The POWs ask Eric to seek out, face and kill Nagase so that they might feel experience retribution and perhaps release from the incarceration of hatred.

One day Patti discovers Eric and the suitcase missing. Patti knows she has taken Eric as far as she can. The rest of the journey is his alone. Eric takes the knife with him to Kanchanaburi Thailand.

The confrontation between Eric Lomax and Takeshi Nagase is quiet and chilling.

DVD extras include a Making Of featurette with host Lisa Ling. Chinese along the 5 day train ride from Singapore to Kanchanaburi offered food and water to the men who were refused both and kept locked in cattle cars. Chinese also provided components for the hand made radio secreted among the POWs. Interviews with Eric and Patti, induction photos of the 21 year old Lomax and Nagase, and director and writer commentary for the entire movie are in Bonus Features.

Spoiler Alert

Nagase writes letters of apology to Lomax for decades. Excerpts from Nagase's letters are included in the film. Lomax wrote back ""you are continuing to work for reconciliation"" and finally 12 years later, asks Patti to accompany him to Kanchanaburi to see the site of his torture. Patti advised Nicole Kidman that she had to actually see Hellfire Pass during location filming because it is a powerful indescribable experience as if the stones retain the emotions they have witnessed, similar to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Killing-Fields-30th-Anniversary-Blu-ray/dp/B00F3LC93C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Killing Fields: 30th Anniversary [Blu-ray</a>] of Cambodia and Nazi concentration camps.

The production crew moved the stones which POWs had broken and transferred into the jungle by hand, back into place for the movie. The actual stones handled by POWs long dead.

Takeshi Nagase died 2011.

Lomax' 93rd birthday was celebrated on set within Hellfire Pass in 2012. Lomax refused to view even brief clips of the film, fearful the visuals would cause his nightmares to return. But he did view some stills. Lomax constantly pushed the director to finish the work, so that the story would be told. Veterans who view Railway Man express relief feeling their dignity restored.

Lomax' story heals the gap between expectation and hatred, where forgiveness allows seed leaves of human engagement to appear.

During the last half hour or so, if you don't have a few tears in your eyes, there might be something wrong with you.

It does help to know a little about the fall of Singapore to the Japanese beforehand, as most people don't know of the magnitude of certain events in this story.

6034895,5,B00FWUX94M,"This is probably Colin Firth's finest lead performance since ""The King's Speech"" and ""A Single Man."" As with those two films,  he truly should get an Oscar nod, but this film was buried and did not last long in theaters.  So I do not see this happening, however richly deserved.
Other reviewers here have stated well the story of this film, the journey of Eric Lomax to reconcile the horrors he endured as a POW in WWII after the fall of Singapore.  He is ably aided by his devoted wife, Patti, who is played quite well by a sympathetic Nicole Kidman.
Director Teplitzky moves back and forth in time, with 4 actors playing younger and older versions of themselves.  In the case of Irvine and Firth, it is seamless.
Everyone in this does superb work, but it is Eric's film -- the younger and older man represented by these two very fine actors.  Firth's ability to embody nuance and deep feelings, mirrored only in his face and eyes, is on fine display here.  Plus it is a physically demanding role in places as well, for him and certainly for Jeremy Irvine.

I highly recommend watching something that has a little heft as well as heart and soul to it.

The US Blu-Ray Disk is fine, with somewhat less-than-stellar extras.  I felt a bit cheated there.

Note:  The US version of this film is different from the UK/AUS version.  Shorter, with some different scenes.

6034902,5,B00FWUX94M,"""The Railway Man"" concerns itself with the physical wounds of war that  manifest themselves and linger decades later.  The trauma these men experienced can only be expelled by closure which many define as retribution and revenge against those who inflicted the wounds.  Eric Lomax (Colin Firth) is one such survivor who despite the love of an understanding woman, Patti (Nicole Kidman), upon hearing his chief tormentor in a Japanese internment camp, Nagase (Nuriyuko Sanada), is alive and well and acting as curator at a museum where Lomax was detained wants restitution.  Justice will be served but in what shape and form? Regardless the ultimate outcome is an epiphany of sorts for both men.  Firth is brilliant in an understated and carefully modulated turn projecting the pain of Lomax through soulful eyes and forlorn facial gesticulations.  Sanada in his limited screen time beautifully assays a man whose heinous past forces him to make amends for his deeds.  Some would dismiss Kidman's role as window dressing but it's key in unlocking the horrors that virtually ate Lomax's psyche whole.  Lastly, Stellan Skarsgard delivers a memorable role as Lomax's commanding officer who may or not have coped better than Lomax after the war.  Without giving anything away ""The Railway Man"" doesn't follow Hollywood formula in portraying the events of the war but the adage of life being stranger, or truer, than fiction would be applicable here.",1408060800,3,1444,5.163090128755365

Based on a true story it begins with the tender courtship of Canadian nurse, Patti, and middle aged railway enthusiast, Eric Lomax. However, no sooner are they married than Lomax begins to exhibit post traumatic stress disorder and depression from his wartime experiences as a soldier-slave laborer on Japan's notorious Burma railway.
As Patti desperately tries save their marriage, a colleague discovers a news clipping of their Japanese torturer, who is now offering guided tours of the prison camp and railway where they suffered so greatly. Events then prompt Lomax to travel to the scene of the terrible crimes that were committed by the Imperial Army to confront his tormentor. What follows is a testament to the human spirit and the ability to forgive and make peace with the past, despite the horrific suffering one has endured.

6034908,5,B00FWUX94M,"I received this film today and I have just watched it.  I am so moved and stunned by this film.  There are not enough films about WWII with Japan.  Certainly not enough to make the kind of impact the WWII with Germany and the Holocaust have made.  My father was in the US Navy, and fought the Japanese in the Marshall Islands and Okinawaand was heading for the invasion of Japan when the Atom Bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.  This film gave me the deepest view of what would have happened to my father if he was somehow taken prisoner.  And, he never went into detail about his experience of WWII.  He was not unusual in that way.  I've watched a number of other well done films about the POW camps and the camps where European and Australian civilians, male and female, were imprisoned.  ""The Great Raid"" and ""Paradise Road"" are good examples.  However, ""The Railway Man"" was an intense personal experience focused on one man's wounded soul, who was most definitely in Post Traumatic Stress.  Eric Lomax (Colin Firth) who wrote his autobiography which the film is based on, was a tortured and starved British officer in a Japanese POW camp.  He lives with memories he can not get free of.  It is up close and personal.  He was repeatedly water boarded.  I defy anyone to not understand water boarding as torture after seeing this film.  Mr. Lomax does want to heal, and with the support and love of his wife Patti (Nicole Kidman) he does just that.  Both his wife and a fellow prisoner (Stellan Skarsgard), encourage him.  Just when it seems like he might choose suicide, he returns to the camp and finds the interpreter, Takashi Nagase, who was part of the Japanese torture process, running a WWII museum there, at the camp!  Eric Lomax goes there to track down this man and kill him.  He is unable to murder him.  And, realizes that the interpreter is suffering as well, from his role in the camp.  Eventually they find reconciliation and forgiveness, through their relationship with each other.  The film moves back and forth between Eric Lomax in the camp (Jeremy Irvine) and the post war Eric.

Colin Firth is so fine in the role of the post war Eric Lomax.  He captures this man's pain with such edgey emotional elegance.  Jeremy Irvine as Eric during his imprisonment in the POW camp is probably best known for his starring role in ""War Horse.""  In ""The Railway Man"" he finds the depth of his character better than I expected from a 23 year old man.  Nicole Kidman is quite fine in her role as Eric's supportive and truly loving wife, who is really at her wits end with trying to be more intimate with her husband.  She is desperate to hear his story and get through the wall he has built around himself.  Tanroh Ishida plays the POW camp interpreter.  And Stellan Skarsgard in his pivotal role as another prisoner is also a tortured soul.  He gives Eric the information to find the interpreter, and then commits suicide.  He lives with a sense of guilt that he did not protect Eric after the radio Eric built and a map he drew were found.  This is what specifically generates the severe torture inflicted on Eric Lomax.  All the acting is quite good.  However, it is Colin Firth that could get an Academy Award nomination.  He seems to me to be a candidate for any number of other film awardsGolden Globe, SAG, BAFTA.",1407801600,2,3325,4.54637436762226

And at least for me it was not convincing that we are suppose to believe that the same people we see young are the same people old.  For me it didn't work.",1407801600,,496,4.2105263157894735

But then perhaps it's her utter lack of inner-beauty that she so glaring put forth on The David Letterman show shortly after her divorce from Tom Cruise when she raised her arms joyfully and declared: ""Now I can wear heels again!!""

6034912,4,B00FWUX94M,"Over many decades I've screened multiple treatments of this story with varying degrees of appreciation. This one, with some minor bumps, was excellent. Tells the tale of a man beset with horrific nightmares - vivid recollections of suffering during wartime. And, like many of these films, is based on true events.

Colin Firth plays Eric Lomax, survivor. A former British prisoner of war and victim to the early losses suffered by many western nations in the Pacific Theater by Imperial Japanese forces.

Though none of that is known during the course of our introduction to his character - The Railway Man. An eccentric whose life is filled by understanding the UK's rail system better than any other living person. Passionate for everything locomotive, a gentle quirk who would never say a bad thing about another, nor ever raise his hand in anger. A proper English gentleman in the classic sense.

It's during one period of remission from his horrific PTSD that he meets and falls in love with beautiful Patricia Wallace. A wonderfully serendipitous encounter which leads two strangers on a train discovering true love.

Yet, it was only a remission.

After a magical courtship and whirlwind romance, it's soon after their union that Patty is shocked to learn what lies deep beneath the wonderfully droll exterior of her new husband. And that revelation sparks a tortuous journey to free him from the chains of the past. Confronting the shame, guilt, horror and anger as a young engineer witnessed and experienced almost unspeakable brutality during The Second World War.

Overall, a visually rich and superbly acted film that still doesn't quite ring with the moral authority the director and writers were attempting to achieve.

The bumps in this otherwise good film happen twice.

The first comes during the torture room scene. An intended indictment of ""enhanced interrogation"" by current governments of the west that I find ludicrous since we are again fighting an intractable enemy with no rules regarding warfare.

And what did we eventually do to finally stop the madness? Drop two nuclear bombs on their homeland.

If this was a parallel intended to bring shame - to me, it gave frightening pause thinking about the fearsome weapons we are prepared to use if things get well and truly out of hand.

I'm not ashamed - I'm terrified. So that's a fail.

Another clumsy attempt comes at an important scene as we flashback to 1942. Now a prisoner-of-war, Eric relates why no one ever built a railway from Burma to Thailand, completing the Pan-Asian circuit. He delivers what can only be described as a heavy-handed politically-correct history lesson doused in revisionism. There were many colors of skin that built the Trans-Continental American Railway. And many colors suffered anonymous and unhonored deaths. It was hardly white people taking advantage of asians. Although, yes, the Central Pacific (western rail) was indeed primarily Chinese immigrants - that blanket statement completely ignores the eastern rail line and it's suffering workers.

In truth, it was more like the powerful 1% screwing over ALL lower caste people, like they always do. A pronouncement that would've made a much, much stronger statement instead of going for the cheap shot straw man.

Those two ham-fisted messages aside - this was an excellent film. Though Kidman did seem off in some scenes, minor failings that can be attributed as character interpretation. Otherwise, both Oscar winners provided the production with outstanding performances, and the story of Eric and Patricia Lomax lives on as a warning to horrors of war, a testament to the power of love, and need for humanity to learn forgiveness; or else face enduring hatred that will eventually consume our collective souls.",1406764800,6,3776,5.108766233766234

6034914,5,B00FWUX94M,"With the notable exception of the Oscar-wining THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI (1957), few, if any, movies have dealt with the Japanese forced labor camps of World War II in which British POWs were made to work on the Thai-Burma Railroad.

THE RAILWAY MAN (2014) is adapted from the autobiography of Eric Lomax, who was a prisoner in one of those camps, and who was brutally tortured by his captors.  The film begins in 1980 where we find Lomax (Colin Firth) back in the UK, still trying to cope with his horrific memories of the war years.  A railroad enthusiast, Lax meets Patti (Nicole Kidman) on a train, and its virtually love at first sight.  They marry rather quickly, but then Patti must start dealing with the war demons that continue to haunt her husband.

Events reach a head when, through his friend (Stellan Skarsgard), also a former POW, Lomax learns that one of Japanese tormentors is now acting as a tour guide at the prison camp where he was once held.  Planning to avenge himself, Lomax travels back to the Thai-Burma locale where,  as they say, his life changes forever.

Directed by Jonathan Teplitzky, THE RAILWAY MAN is a powerful, often disturbing film about the after effects of war.  Firth, Kidman and Skarsgard deliver compelling performances, as does Jeremy Irvine, who plays Lomax in the extensive flashback sequences.  Much of this extraordinarily handsome film was shot on the actual Thai-Burma locales where the events took place.

The Blu-ray release from Anchor Bay Entertainment features audio commentary by Teplitzky and co-writer/producer Andy Paterson, as well as a Making of documentary that contains brief on-camera interviews with the real Eric and Patti Lomax.
