8618592,5,B00FTUY8OU,"This is pretty solid.... It's worth the buy just for R.C Sproul. I buy so many apologetcs volumes it's borderline obsessive. And to be quite honest with you, most are not impressive. For example, I am not in the slightest impressed with Ravi Zacharias in the Death of Truth & the Decline of Culture, or his Reason & Faith... It was terrible, you have to be an infant to be able to learn anything from those. Very surprising material from a legend such as Pastor Ravi....R.C just blows every trinity explanation out of the water on this, and he explains it in a theological understanding that can't be explained. This man may be one of the greatest teachers of our time because he delivers with such compassion and love. Then you have John MAcArthur who of course is a brilliant teacher but he lacks the love component. You get the best of all worlds on this and I will keep this in the family for life.",1462492800,,902,4.4397590361445785
