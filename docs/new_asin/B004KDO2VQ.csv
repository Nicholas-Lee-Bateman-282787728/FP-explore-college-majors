Neither the creators of this video nor the Chinese government seem to have a clue what Tibet and its tradition of Buddhism are about. This movie was visually awful. The entire video is simply different views of the outside of the these temples. So sad what China has done to Tibet. Oddly the ""music"" is mostly Tibetan. The first is chanting from a sadhana. After that, it's just folk music, similar to China's folk music. I don't personally care for or understand the ""screeching"" in that music, but each to their own, I guess. Thank goodness this was a free video on Amazon.",1436832000,,629,4.478260869565218

8432717,3,B004KDO2VQ,"Naxos Musical Journey series combines music with video of the country featured. The earlier Naxos sets were released in a 4:3 aspect ratio, which was OK if it does not include people, who look too fat in 4:3. The newer Chinese series is in 16:9, which is perfect for my HD wide screen TV. The video of Tibet looks great. The only problem is that I am not Chinese: the high pitched music is too screachy to me. Also, I have not accepted China's takeover of Tibet. I am not a religious person, but I did not like China's heavy handed destruction of the Tibetan monasteries and sending too many Chinese people there.",1361318400,,613,4.433628318584071
