4983973,4,B006DH5RPW,Although this movie is not scriptural (and doesn't claim to be) it is a great way to explain to children the Egyptian gods and how they worshipped idols.  Well done.,1391990400,2,165,4.5

8496707,1,B006DH5RPW,This is 100% artistic liberty and fiction with ZERO Biblical basis apart from the names alone.  Poor graphic animation quality as well.  This should have just been a fiction without ever having been attributed to Abraham.,1491782400,,221,5.111111111111111
