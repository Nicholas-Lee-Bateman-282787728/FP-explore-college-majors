6838926,5,B00PZX2CT4,"This must be the best submarine movie I have seen so far.  In my modest opinion it is way better and entertaining than Das Boot, Crimson Tide, The Hunt for Red October, K-19 The Widowmaker, The Enemy Below, or starting John Bon Jovi U-571.

Jude Law is back.  This time as an older, over-the-hill and with a receding hair-line English submarine captain who after being fired under shady circumstance from a marina company he has worked for all his life undertakes a daring plan to recover gold from a sunken World War II German submarine somewhere in the Black Sea.  Together with his Russian friend he quickly assembles a team of English and Russian crew members who soon...

This film has everything: interesting and thrilling story-line, adventure, plot-twists, good character development, international cast, and some really great scenes of deep underwater diving.

Interesting fact: one of the Russian characters in the film is named Zaystev...which also happened to be the name of the character Jud Law played in the film called Enemy at the Gates (2001).",1425168000,34,1061,5.0

6838928,3,B00PZX2CT4,"Black Sea (2014 release from the UK; 115 min.) brings the story of Robinson (played by Jude Law). Over the opening credits of the movie, we get WWII archive footage of Hitler, Stalin and submarines. When the movie opens, we see Robinson, a long-time submarine pilot, getting fired by his employer, due to the industrys changing circumstances. Robinson tries to forget his misery in the pub, alongside others who recently were sacked by the same company. But its not long before Robinson gets an opportunity to search for a long-lost German U boat submarine, which supposedly contains 2 tons of gold bricks, which was meant to be a loan from Stalin to Hitler (before Hitler attacked Germany). Robinson assembles a crew of 12 (6 Brits, 6 Russians), and before we know it, there are off in search of the U boat. Will they locate the submarine? Will they find gold? What becomes of the crew of 12? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Scottish director Kevin Macdonald, who previously has brought us quality movies like Touching the Void, The Last King of Scotland, and the Bob Marley documentary simply called Marley. (Im not such a fan of his previous movie, 2013s How I Live Now.) That, couple with Jude Laws name and reputation, was basically enough for me to take a chance on this. Alas, it was not to be Where to begin? How about this: theres been a fair share of previous submarine adventure-thriller movies. If 1980s Das Boot is the gold standard bearer (which it surely is), then Black Sea doesnt even make the podium for the silver or bronze. The group of misfits that comprises the crew of 12 seems mostly a collection of clich&eacute;s and one-dimensional characters (the drunk, the racist, the paranoid, the brainiac, etc. etc.). More damagingly, I simply didn't feel the tension when the movie goes into action-mode (diving to the bottom of the Black Sea, worrying about the Russian fleet above it, etc.). Compare this to the unbearable anxiety that befell the crew of Das Boot By that time the Big Plot Twist comes in the second hour of the movie (no worries, I won't spoil), I simply didn't care anymore. Neither did Jude Law seemingly, as he gives a phoned-in performance. When you think of his brilliant performance in his previous movie (Dom Hemingway, as youve never seen Jude Law before), the contrast is stark Im sorry that I cant be more positive about this movie. I really wanted to like it, but the promise or potential of this movie, which so desperately wants to be the new ""Das Boot"", simply never materializes.

Black Sea opened last month without any pre-release fanfare of buzz on just two screens for all of Greater Cincinnati, and was gone after just 2 weeks. The matinee screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. Not that it matters, as in all good consciousness I cannot recommend this movie, but if you're not convinced, by all means I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.",1424822400,14,3151,4.6859205776173285
6838929,4,B00PZX2CT4,"Submarine Films are like Train Films: usually consistent, usually decent.

BLACK SEA takes the drug-running submarine idea in the wake of former Soviet Union states' military surplus firesales, and adds some naval combat, corporate/espionage elements, and - most importantly - bank heist (Nazi Gold)/deep sea exploration tropes in a refreshing way. Their motivations are believable, their conflicts where insane and senseless similarly given the stress and personnel as well,--

Id saw its somewhere between The Deep and Hunt for Red October and for those that find fault with what can really be done and whats done in this movie should not watch it because there are some stretches and leaps. The greed undertones and how it works on the crew is also interesting as is how they got to be doing what they're doing.

6838953,2,B00PZX2CT4,"Having much respect for the acting talents of Jude Law, I had pretty high hopes for this movie. But after about the third or fourth scene, the film simply lost credibility. It's altogether conceivable anyone in their right mind would risk their life in a rusted-out, totally dilapidated submarine crewed by a group of openly incompatible degenerates on a rumor of striking it rich. Actually, considering such a weak script, I'm amazed the money was put up to make this movie at all. It just proves, ""life is full of surprises.""",1487808000,,527,4.802197802197802

Some of the acting might seem a little stilted, but here I'm nit-picking. Recommend watching this flick as a whole production; it's quite good, even if there are some technical question marks, but hey, I've been a design engineer for many years, so take the comment with a few grains of salt.

Cool Sub operational stuff going on inside, helps you understand how to manage a boat like this.

Jude Law plays the past of dupe and skipper in this undersea film. With a mix of further Soviet Navy sailors and British submariners, the crew buys a decommissioned Soviet Foxtrot class submarine in hopes of recovering lost Nazi gold in the Black Sea. Tensions flair as problems arise and dissention between the factions arise.

To go any further would be to do spoil the friction and yet camaraderie between the sailors. Much like any crew of a closed quartered group, there's a lot of bitching, moaning and complaining. But, as I had heard for many years, ""A bitchy sailor is a happy sailor"". For the record, Ping Jockey (sonarman) Baba, does a helluva job keeping that boat from the ultimate maritime fate.

Submarine captain Jude Law is fired by the salvage company he works for and is drawn into a scheme to recover lost Nazi Gold in a sunk Nazi submarine in the Black Sea. He recruits 6 former also fired crew members and through a contact decides to hire 6 Russian former submarine crew.  When one of his former crew commits suicide he finds a poor unemployed 18 year old friend of the dead man scrounging food in the dead man's apartment, and decides to hire this kid with no experience as a member of the crew. When the voyage is underway, the Russians decide that the 18 year old kid, whose girlfriend is expecting a baby is somehow a virgin and therefore bad luck on a submarine. One of the crew members hired as a diver is also a psychopath. The Russians and English crew members start to argue and fight with each other. They appear to act like a bunch of caged convicts rather than men disciplined by years of submarine service, in spite of the fact that they have all been promised an equal share of the gold. One of the English crew tries to argue the Russians should get a lesser share because the standard of living is lower in Russia and less gold will buy more in Russia than in England. A series of rediculously contrived mishaps leads the crew and the sub into a series of disasters. This disaster movie, thinly disguised as an adventure film rolls onto it's inevitable conclusion, with some dreadful acting and a miserable script. The only reason it got two stars, is that the suspense does build up at times, but then you ask yourself, why in the world would the charachter do that, when a perfectly good solution was available.

6839049,5,B00PZX2CT4,"This is a fun version of a heist movie: instead of a bank, the ragtag crew of specialists that gets assembled is in search of several tons of black market Nazi gold on the bottom of the Black Sea. The rusty sub they get for the job is hardly sea worthy, and the crew adores mutiny as much as every other one in every other heist movie. Plus, there is at least one double cross -- which all makes for an entertaining adventure.

To listen to Jude Law's version of a Scottish accent is also entertaining, though he does lose it from time to time when he acts angry. Since Mr. Law almost always plays the pretty boy, it's refreshing to see him playing a more rough-and-tumble character in this flick: he's not just a crook, but a filthy one with amble stubble, sweat, and grease that progressively builds up on him throughout the film.

Most of this movie takes place down in the bowells of he rusty sub, and the lighting is just great. It looks entirely convincing and is as suspenseful as it could possibly be.",1443225600,,1009,4.361702127659575

Good solid performances by all.  A dark, claustrophobic film about rights and wrongs, choices and following through with the decisions made no matter what, as close and tight as the environment which it depicts.

6839070,3,B00PZX2CT4,"Black Sea starts off pretty slow, it's sort of like a union recruitment TV commercial at the start where Jude Law's character is retrenched and gets pretty much nothing from the company he's given so much of his working life to, because he was only ever doing temporary back to back contracts.  He recruits others in the same situation to accompany him to find a sunken in World War II German sub that is hopefully full of gold bars that the Russians gave as a loan to Germany to finance their war effort just days before Germany attacked them (hence the fact the gold never made it to the Germans).  For some reason that I never saw as necessary, half the salvage crew is made up of UK unemployed or underemployed former maritime workers and the other half is Russians in the same situation. Since their plan was never to communicate with the Russian government or anything I don't really understand why the crew needed to have Russians as part of it.  I could understand one person who spoke Russian who could act as a translator listening into Russian Navy radio messages or something but half the crew didn't need to be.  But that's what we have here for the plot, half of the crew who hate and are racist towards other half, most of the crew can't speak the other's language, and the Russians who don't want to work with a teen who hasn't been in a sub before because it's bad luck.

For me nothing really memorable or exciting happened in the plot that will ever make me think about this movie again and certainly not years in the future.  I also wondered why if the German sub was just sitting there in the open and everyone seemed to know about this gold, why no one had bothered to get it before now?",1441756800,,1709,4.40952380952381

6839076,3,B00PZX2CT4,"In Black Sea Jude Law plays an ex-navy submarine operator Captain Robinson who has lost his job at a salvage company. He teams up with a crew of unemployed submarine engineers  some are British, others Russian  to search for the gold that a U-boat was carrying during the WWII.

Directed by Kevin Macdonald of The Last King of Scotland fame, Black Sea is less like an action-packed adventure film than a psychological drama set in a claustrophobic place. Dont expect something like National Treasure or the Indiana Jones series as the story of Black Sea is closer to that of a John Huston classic The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

I understand that this kind of tale needs an extreme situation where characters trust in each other is tested, but some part of the story is too unbelievable. You may also notice genre clichs here and there. Jude Laws acting is strong, I admit, but his character Robinson is not as interesting as it should be, having almnost no chance to show his professional skills.

Black Sea is a pretty entertaining thriller, but could be more so with a better script and more credible characters.",1441238400,,1118,4.712820512820513

6839160,4,B00PZX2CT4,"Usually movies involving submarines are about wartime or cold-war espionage or James Bond.  Director, Kevin Macdonald (""The Last King of Scotland""), takes us on a different mission.  A treasure hunt.

Jude Law is terrific as Robinson, a former submariner in the British Navy and more recently the boss of a salvage submarine.  He's unceremoniously fired as the company no longer wants to use subs to do its work.  Lounging about in a local pub, he's told by a former crewmen that he knows of a sunken Nazi U-boat loaded with Russian gold bullion deep in the Black Sea.  Robinson is interested and arranges a meeting with a wealthy financier (Tobias Menzies, TV's ""Outlander"").  Successful in arranging funding in exchange for 40% of the loot, Robinson acquires a rusty Russian relic of a sub, but it is seaworthy.  Next he acquires a crew comprised of 6 Brits/Scots and 6 Russians.  He needs the Ruskies to run the sub and the English speakers to go get the gold.  Not surprisingly, much of the crew don't get along.

Robinson is the right man for the job however.  The film could be one of those primers, companies show low level managers about leadership.  The crew and the sub must remain secretive, dodging the Russian navy who may or may not be looking for them.  In a head scratching confrontation between one of the Brits (Ben Mendelson) and a Russian (Konstantin Khabenskiy), disaster strikes which could sabotage the entire mission.  Without giving too much away, another wrinkle develops well into the operation that creates a tightening tension as to whether a few lives are more important that a fortune in gold.

The shipboard scenes which monopolize the film are properly confining and bleak.  The action is well filmed and the sound effects excellent.  This is an overlooked, exciting drama with edge-of-your seat tension.  Recommended.

The Blu ray disc comes with a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The transfer looks beautiful.  Impressive black levels give the black in Black Sea proper respect.  Greenish lighting aboard the sub looks realistic.  Facial hair, sweat and clothing show great detail.  This is a top quality disc from a technical perspective.  If anything, the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is even more impressive.  The submarine provides plenty of opportunity for testing your surround system.  Not only the thunderous growl of its launch but the chaotic elements of life aboard the slender tube.  Hissing leaks and rushing water are well displayed.  The sonar operator's stop watch, the sonar pings and the numerous moans of the sub fight for recognition in every scene.  Dialog is properly centered for the most part.  I did have to crank up the volume a bit in an effort to understand the heavily accented English the crew use.  Subtitles come in Spanish, French and English SDH.  Extras include an audio commentary with Macdonald, a 5 minute overview of the film and some trailers.",1436400000,,2932,4.940573770491803

Black Sea is a very realistic, gritty, and claustrophobic tale told at sea.  The characters are tossed into a crock pot, ill-prepared and desperate.

the past ten years or so, suddenly finds his services are no longer required, receiving a small cheque in severance pay
leaves 'Robinson' somewhat at a loss to what his future holds.
He'd long since lost his family, blaming this upon the work-load that he'd undertaken for the salvage company.
One of his friends comes up with what at first seems a hair-brained idea to go treasure hunting....it seems that during WW2
a U-Boat ladened with a cargo of gold had failed to reach it's designated destination, so the U-Boat and cargo lies at the
bottom of the Black Sea.
The operation has to be financed and a submarine made available, a sponsor readily comes forward....
The 'Captain' will need a crew, he turns to former naval colleagues along with a few Russian Seamen that are needed because
of the port and locations needed for the search.
The Submarine that has been acquired for the venture looks to be a rust-bucket, a decommissioned vessel, however still functional.
The search for the lost gold begins........
However, the dysfunctional crew are soon at odds with each other...
'The Captain will learn that planned arrangements are not as he believed them to be...
The film is a whole lot better than i'd been led to believe, though a film critic i rarely take notice of, actually got it right in my view.
The film has plenty of tension along the way with a measure of violent action and the usual dose of colourful language, i believe
that if like myself one watches it with no preconceived expectations either way most viewers will enjoy the movie.
Good Picture and Sound Quality.

Robinson (Jude Law) has been let go from his salvage company because they no longer use submarines and hence do not need submarine captains. He is soon given a salvage offer for gold that may exist on a submarine in the Black Sea. Its location is known, however the operation will be illegal, but the reward is high. They must use a Russian submarine, and thus the crew will be split, half Russian, half British. The drama begins right away. The crew includes a man who is claustrophobic, a near 18 year old newbie, and some psychos. The disagree over the food, sleeping arrangements, and share splitting. In fact the drama was a bit silly since the reward and short duration of the salvage far exceeded the need for bickering.  Then there is a twist, a few improbable moments, and an ending that wasn't formula. Enjoyable, but then again I literally spent years on a sub.

It is not ""Das Boot"" but it was in English.

6839221,5,B00PZX2CT4,"NOTE: DON'T watch the trailer. It gives away too much.

Take a chance and go deep. 90 meters below the black sea, where a U-Boat full of gold sits.  Yes there are cliches, including the cowardly lawyer lifted from Aliens for one, but generally the script and direction and acting overcome them with vigor. What the director understands is what is important in the story. The set up scenes are strong yet concise, whereas in most movies of this type you're half way in before anything happens. But the best thing about the movie is the acting. Having just seen Jude Law in ""SPY"" you will be astonished at how he lives in the skin of a character who is entirely different. He reminds me of a young Michael Caine, and that is a compliment. Credit to almost everyone else in the cast (I didn't like the ""virgin"" kid, but that's just me). The Russians and Brits here are so convincing you totally buy into the story and the inevitable conflicts. Don't know why this film didn't get more attention.

6839226,3,B00PZX2CT4,"This is one of those type of movies that you know what you get in advance.  You bring a ragtag group of sub crew members together (one that is a psychopath), make it a point to tell them everyone gets a share of the gold with the point of mentioning less people, more per share and let the action and suspense commence.  As a work of movie art, this is not, it is a fairly predictable storyline with some improbable leaps in logic and reality but for purely an action and suspense movie, this does the job as a popcorn flick on a weekend night.  If you ignore the plot holes, suspend some sense of reality and just go for the ride, then this movie has plenty of suspense to go around.  Jude Law is pretty good in the role and the various unique characters for the most part fit into the gritty crew.  Not a classic as far as sub movies go but ok for a movie night.

A couple other noteworthy performances too, but Jude is the chef in this kitchen. As for the movie, there are edge-of-your-seat moments, co-mingled with scenes where you say out loud ""seriously??"". Let's just say, what they are up to from the beginning is egregiously improbable, and then events make matters even more unlikely. Without being a spoiler alert necessarily, there is one scene where someone gets a piece of clothing that they're wearing lodged in a sub door that has water flooding through it. Rather than simply remove the article of clothing to break free, the man just yanks and yanks on it and he ultimately drowns as the water goes up over his head!!! That is arguably the most ridiculous and insulting scene I have ever witnessed.

Man, between his perform in ""Contagion"" and ""Black Sea,"" I bet those people feel less prophetic than the twits who assured their clients that the markets were solid on October 25, 1929. Unlike the doomed markets, Law's stock only continues to climb as he chooses films which are often not blockbuster fare but speak to the struggle of the human soul. Melodramatic? Watch this film and tell me it doesn't conjure as many existential questions stirring about your mind than a night reading Nietzsche.
""Black Sea"" is, on the surface, an amazingly realistic submarine disaster film. I'm sure that others will compare it to ""Hunt for the Red October"" and  ""Crimson Tide."" While I loved those films, they couldn't hold a candle to this. Why? Because the set-up is such a minor part in what truly comprises this story. Essentially, Law plays a man who has sacrificed decades of his life (both in terms of time and at the expense of his family) to the salvage company for which he works. Without warning, he is forcibly retired due to no fault of his own besides the horrific economy which is eating everyone alive. Upon meeting a group of mates (many of whom are also forcibly retired or barely working) at the local pub, he quickly learns that the only legitimate jobs open to men his age with his skills are those in low-paying fast food gigs. Unless . . . he can buck the system, defy its dismissal of him and others like him, and charter a submarine to a trench where a Nazi sub full of Russian gold is said to lie. To do so, he must gather a team of half-Russian, half-British sailors who are knowledgeable enough to perform the necessary tasks but also desperate enough to risk their lives.
I won't go more into the details of the plots because it really is a brilliant suspense piece, but I would like to discuss some of the underlying themes of the film. Foremost, it dissects capitalism and the modern economy in which men who have devoted themselves in service to corporations often are disposed of with less fanfare than a retired machine. What is the worth of a man who has sacrificed his humanity in service? When the corporation is God, family, lover, and parent rolled into one, how does one retain any self-worth when that rejects you? More and greater sacrifices are demanded of workers every day even as jobs become less secure. How long until we are simply indentured servants of these modern deities? Second, what redeems a man? Can he regain his soul by saving the humanity of his brother? Third, we must ask ourselves if the divisions and hatreds we harbour are truly our own or serve to keep us divided so that our corporate overlords may keep us docile and without threat. If we were to realise that we of the working class have far more in common and in shared interest than the relatively minor nonsense that divides us, we would overwhelm the elites. But while we focus on the differences, we will continue to squabble among ourselves and allow them to chuckle at our ineptitude as we crawl for their crumbs.
I invite everyone who loves a film which makes him/her ponder life long after viewing to watch this masterpiece. The acting is true to life, the dialogue is incredibly well-written, the special effects feel more like a documentary than special effects (I write that as the highest compliment), and the philosophic matter is par excellence. Just be sure to watch it with someone who appreciates multi-layered films.",1433894400,3,3595,4.670347003154574
6839239,4,B00PZX2CT4,"I've probably seen every single movie that features submarines and this one comes out slightly ahead of most competitors. While the vast majority of submarine flicks feature Navy subs with a full compliment of crew, the sub in Black Sea is manned by a skeleton crew with not only a major language barrier but a whole host of conflicting agendas. From the moment that the sub heads out to sea it is very obvious that if the sea doesn't kill them they will most likely end up killing each other.

Jude Law puts in an excellent performance as the sub's skipper and the supporting cast all seemed to pull their own weight. While this film is not action from start to finish, danger always seems to be just around the corner, and usually is! I would label this as more of a psychological thriller than an action movie. It has a solid script and story with plenty of plot twists and an overload of suspense. Definitely worth your time.",1433894400,,929,4.497041420118343

6839303,1,B00PZX2CT4,"Anyone here who has seen some of the best submarine films - ""Das Boot"", ""Crimson Tide"", ""Run Silent, Run Deep"", will be very much disappointed in this B/C rate film that employs the technical knowledge of a 4-year old.

I also don't think this was a good effort by Jude Law. My main focus of criticism is going to focus here on the technical failings of this film. First and foremost the type of submarine depicted in the film is a diesel-electric submarine. This type of submarine employs a technology model that was in use before WW1. Unlike a nuclear powered submarine which can remain submerged indefinitely since it's power source does not rely on oxygen, diesel electric submarines use their diesels on the surface to cruise when not submerged and to re-charge the batteries that are used to drive electric motors that power the propellers when the boat is submerged. Which means that the submarine performance-wise can only travel about 1/3 as fast submerged as it can on the surface, and even then to run the motors at full speed would deplete the batteries a lot quicker.

During WWII the Germans captured some snorkel technology from the Dutch and started fitting their Type VIIC U-Boats with retractable snorkels that did allow the diesels to run while the submarine was submerged. There were limitations to this however, firstly the submarine was forced to travel close to the surface, and depending on conditions could still be spotted from the air, secondly the portion of the snorkel that protruded above the water could be picked-up on Allied radar. The Germans realizing this went on to develop the radically new design of the Type XXI submarine, designed purely as an underwater craft with high underwater endurance and speed. The hull design was so revolutionary, it was used as a design basis for America's first nuclear submarine, the Nautilus.

First and foremost the key ingredient in making a submarine movie is that it must be technically accurate, submarines are very complicated machines, they are akin to spacecraft.

I don't have all day to go over all the ridiculous things that are wrong with this movie, but here are a few...

In this film they show the submarine running on it's diesels all the time while deeply submerged. In the movie, in the scene where the submarine loses it's engines and they wind up on the sea bed conveniently nearby the sunken U-Boat; they come up with the idea of replacing the crankshaft of the broken engine with the crankshaft off the German U-Boat. You could never do this!!! A German designed diesel engine is not going to have it's parts interchangeable with another motor of a different manufacturer. These marine diesel engines are massive motors, the crankshaft is at the base of the engine, bathed in oil, it is a massive forging, very large and very heavy. It is not accessible by means of some flimsy sheet metal panel. Diesel engines are heavily engineered out of solid components. This is not air conditioner repair folks. Not some toy-like thing 5 feet long spinning in space with no attachments to it like you see in the movie. The movie is ridiculous, where are the connecting rods?, where's all the oil? OMG.
The scene when the divers get to the sunken German U-Boat they are able to identify it with the Nazi swastika painted on it. The Germans never painted big swastikas on their U-Boats, just their capital ships on the decks for aerial recognition. Next the divers open the hatch to the U-Boat and walk right in, everything inside the submarine is bone dry???? Really? What about the seawater? This assumes that there would have been an airlock already flooded so they could even OPEN the hatch from the outside, remember pressure/square-inch would never allow you to open the hatch, even if there was an operational airlock, someone from INSIDE would have to operate that for you. All of the German crew were dead. Also not to ask a stupid question, but this German U-Boat in the story supposedly sank? Wouldn't there have been a breach to the hull, the sub would have been partially for fully flooded. I would have to reason, the Germans are pretty smart people, after all they had the first Jet fighter and ballistic missile in WWII, if the U-Boat as seen in this movie was in this good of shape they would have made it home; I would have thought. The next scene you see these guys dragging the crankshaft and 4 tons of gold on the seabed on a sled hauled by a winch, and this was after earlier in the movie the guy describes the sea bed as ""butter made of s***"", again more ridiculousness.

I could go on, like I said submarine movies by their nature are technical films, this film fails miserably on the technical merits or lack thereof.",1432339200,7,4725,4.728155339805825

I know next to nothing about submarines nor emergency floatation devices, but there is a part in the movie where it was made absolutely clear that you have to pull something in order to inflate the device once you are in the release chute (and the release chute is completely sealed off from anyone)...and yet an inanimate object (don't want to spoil this for you) was able to use this device successfully.

6839373,2,B00PZX2CT4,"When I watch a movie which is not a a fantasy (like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings) I want the scenes to be plausible even if unlikely. Almost no scene in this movie once inside the submarine has much of a basis in reality. The only good thing about the movie is getting to see the inside of a  ""Foxtrot"" class submarine (as identified by the ""sail"" and the sonar dome on the bow). None of the scenes involving sonar or diving , or  or even navigating the submarine were anything more than scenes which could be lifted out of Saturday morning cartoons.  The gold and ""drive shaft"" retrieval scenes were awful. One of my pet peeves is watching scenes where submarines make very steep dives- like 45 degree dives. These don't happen unless the boat is filling with water and actually sinking. The pressure differential across the length of the hull would be too extreme.  Some people will think I am being picky but these scenes aren't needed for dramatic effect- a normal sharp dive is scary enough because crush depth is only a few hull lengths deep, so if you apply trigonometry and say the sub is moving at even 5 knots and a down angle of 15 degrees.. it's not long before you have to worry... Why does it get 2 stars even? 1)Good acting  2)You get to see the inside of a Foxtrot.",1431216000,4,1283,4.351464435146443

6839402,4,B00PZX2CT4,"Here's one way to make a thriller: start with 40 million dollars of Nazi gold sunk somewhere in the Black Sea. Add to that 12 desperate sailors trapped on a rusty submarine. Combine with ample helpings technological failure, subterfuge, racial tensions, and paranoia. Add to that a killer cast, a stylish visual look, and a dark, riveting script, and you have BLACK SEA.

This may be controversial, anyone telling you this is a boring, bad movie or just-okay movie either didn't know what they were getting in for, or are wrong. Let's clarify: Black Sea is not an action movie. Those looking for explosions, fast-paced thrills, and dumb fun are going to be disappointed. Black Sea is also not a drama. Those looking for rich shades of character and dextrous handlings of complex issues will also come away miffed.

So what is this movie exactly? Black Sea is a stylish and excellent thriller that builds tension from beginning to end through a riveting and inventive script, anchored by a brilliant cast playing subtle if not complex characters. Director&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kevin-Macdonald/dp/B000PH40FY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kevin Macdonald</a>&nbsp;builds tension through the interactions and situation between the desperate men on the submarine - 6 seedy Russians and 6 tough Brits, all acting with the realization that they get to keep more gold when there are less people to share it with - with the other half of the tension coming from the inevitable repercussions of looking for Nazi gold hundreds of feet below the surface of a frigid sea in a rusty old submarine. Without a radio. As technical breakdowns add to emotional ones, so the pace escalates. Black Sea had me on the edge of my seat. It had me groaning along with the characters, and it had leaning closer to the screen, mouth slack-jawed and staring. That's what a good thriller does. And Black Sea is a good thriller.

It's biggest asset is its cast.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jude-Law/dp/B001221DU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jude Law</a>'s the only big star here and his work is tremendous, with the gravitas and desperation of a man with nothing left to lose. But he's not the only heavy-hitter on the submarine. Also on board are subtle, brilliant, and diverse actors like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scoot-McNairy/dp/B00UPHPIH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scoot McNairy</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ben-Mendelsohn/dp/B00N1QJ07Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ben Mendelsohn</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grigory-Dobrygin/dp/B00MU6AVQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grigory Dobrygin</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Smiley/dp/B008M0P9I8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Smiley</a>. If you don't know those names you're missing out on some amazing talents. When the script could get preposterous, these fine thespians keep it grounded and elevate the film with their sheer presence.

Add to that the stylish cinematography, excellent production values, and a very strong script, you have the recipe for an damn good thriller. This movie isn't going to win awards. It's no classic. But it definitely gets into the Top 5 submarine movies ever made, with Das Boot and Red October and Crimson Tide. Black Sea is WELL WORTH your time. It will deliver a tense, riveting, claustrophobic, well-acted, smart turn at the movies for once. 4.5 gold bars out of 5.",1430092800,3,3623,6.269076305220883
6839403,3,B00PZX2CT4,"This is a dark and brooding heavy drama of a group of British and Russian unemployed sailors led by former salvage submarine captain Robinson (Jude Law) that have been enticed by a mysterious financial backer to find and recover a shipment of gold that had sank coming from Russia to Germany in a German sub prior to the German invasion of Russia in WWII.  They know where it is, but because of political disputes no one has ventured to recover it in Russian patrolled waters.  Interesting film with good acting by Jude Law.

What starts off as a way to make money becomes something so much more. This is a movie that I can not do justice to in a review. The movie is nothing amazing and is not a classic but this is one of the biggest surprises I have seen in a while. I was sucked in right away and was interested and intrigued all the way until the end, which seemed to come almost too soon. This movie takes all the great aspects of a heist movie and moves the setting to a claustrophobic submarine. I could go on about how much I liked this movie but I will just say this is one you have to see to understand. I recommend this. Overall, nothing that will win awards or become a classic, but it was entertaining and very much worth your time. I really enjoyed this. I give it a B+.",1427587200,28,1113,3.9292035398230087
6839405,4,B00PZX2CT4,"Here is a genre film as elemental and entertaining as the tagline on its poster:  ""Brave the deep.  Find the gold.  Trust no one.""  Directed with characteristic muscularity by Kevin Macdonald, known for his dexterous shifts between documentaries (One Day in September, Touching the Void) and feature films (The Last King of Scotland, State of Play), Black Sea stars an unglamorous, vehement Jude Law as Robinson, a veteran submarine captain who has devoted his life to the sea at the expense of time with his estranged wife and son.  His life is upended when he loses his job without warning, just another dour victim of a corporate culture's disrespect for the salt-of-the-earth men and women in its employ.  However, the chance to lead a dangerous search for a long-vanished U-boat rumored to contain a fortune in gold represents an unexpected vehicle for redemption.  He could return home an empowered and wealthy man if he survives the arduous journey, including rapidly escalating tension among the twelve-man international crew, each promised an equal share.

The film runs afoul of a few clichd bumps in the roadI am not sure any submarine is large enough for both the Shifty-Eyed Lawyer with an Ulterior Corporate Motive AND the Wide-Eyed Lad at Sea for the First Timebut it is a riveting experience overall.  Macdonald exhibits an enthusiastic interest in the day-to-day routine on a submarine, training his camera on each man's analog technical expertise and related duties.  And he films the outmoded, rusted Soviet boat as if it were a haunted house, always heightening the claustrophobia and general atmosphere of unease.  The film builds to a busy and violent finale with a potent emotional component.",1425340800,56,1715,5.089285714285714
6839406,3,B00PZX2CT4,"Ahhh, Jude Law. Not sure what it is about the guy, but I tend to enjoy his films. This one, is no exception. Captain Robinson (Jude Law) has worked for his employers for 11 years and suddenly gets ""let go"". His company explains there is no longer a need for his position and offers him a tiny amount as severance pay. While having a few drinks with some of his buddies, he soon hears of a ""lost"" submarine, supposedly full of gold. He concocts a plan to go around the two countries fighting over it and get his own crew to salvage it himself.

The movie sounds like it could have been REALLY good. And don't get me wrong, it's a good time, but seeing as I have absolutely no idea about the ways of a submarine, I was completely lost as to most of the mechanics of the film. It was a LOT of working inside the submarine and some guy listening to ""bleeps"" and timing them to check their position. Also, I'm not really sure why the crew HAD to be made up of members from both countries? Again, maybe it's my complete lack of knowledge on the subject, but at least it didn't completely ruin the movie for me, at least.

All in all, I found it entertaining enough to sit through and it was definitely different than most movies I've currently seen.

8689894,4,B00PZX2CT4,"The plot of this film very much depends on the negative public sentiment and mistrust of banks and big business in general which is strangely not in vogue as much in 2018, but in 2014 when Black Sea was released, memories were more fresh of the 07-09 financial crisis and public resentment was much stronger than it is today. Thus, Robinson (Jude Law) a submarine pilot who has just been fired from his job at a marine salvage yard puts a team together to recover millions of dollars worth of gold bars that sank to the bottom of the Black Sea inside a German U-boat. This is a very compelling story that has few moments without tension present. I highly recommend this film.",1534118400,,675,4.495934959349594

Im probably a broken record here along with some of the other reviews but this movie was quite boring.

What GOOD could come from gathering a bunch of testosterone (men) into a small underwater tube?! Fights occur, unnecessary accidents happen.

I almost skipped past this movie after reading some of the reviews but I watched the trailer and saw Tobias Menzies (who I am obsessed with from Outlander) and got excited, thinking hed be in it. He was only in one scene.

So after about the first hour or so, the underwater scenes were pretty much all I stuck around for to watch. The ending was pretty good too.",1534118400,,1215,4.391111111111111

8689900,5,B00PZX2CT4,"Great film.  The story builds gradually, but the dark characters and aura of suspense keeps it interesting. Jude Law was great and the supporting cast was a perfect fit as well. This film provides a welcome departure from superhero movies, predictable sequels, and lame comedies.",1532217600,,279,5.2

movie, was simply wonderful; acting, plot, pacing, suspense, and thrills;
highly recommend for viewing.",1531612800,,178,5.392857142857143
