2418035,4,B000BITV1A,"Green Acres is really a terrific sitcom from the sixties. With stars like Eva Gabor (Lisa Douglas) and Eddie Albert (Oliver Wendell Douglas), a city couple with a socialite wife and his lawyer, who buy a farm in Hooterville, USA. They never mention the state. Lisa and Oliver are in their third season surrounded by an eclectic and eccentric group of characters including a domesticated pig named Arnold who watches television and makes a grand acting appearance in a local theatrical production. It inspires Lisa to contact an old family friend from Hungary in Hollywood. Arnold makes a big splash in Hollywood.

The supporting cast are stellar experienced veteran performers especially Mary Grace Canfield as carpenter Ralph with her brother, Alph. I love the Ziffels who raised their pig Arnold like a son to them. Arnold watches television and goes to school. Perhaps the Douglases weren't cut out for children when they babysit five children from a new neighbor. The series always has laughs in every episode. There are too many to chose from but I enjoy watching the thirty episodes.

I only wished that the DVD included special features like the inspiration, background, and history of the show. I would like to know what happened to Arnold, the most famous pig in show business.",1454630400,,1286,4.976744186046512

2418081,5,B000BITV1A,"Green Acres is one of those Henning series that tells you ALL you need to know in the
theme song [as a first-time viewer].

Someone was commenting about the condition of a few of the episodes. Listen, I'm not the
person I was back in the 60s, either. I noticed---on-line---that o-n-l-y the guy that played
OIliver's farmhand is still living. At 77, Tom ""Eb"" Lester---even during the popularity of GREEN
ACRES lived, simply, in an apartment over a garage... not VERY much better than his on the
show [over a barn]. He lives right, I guess. He was in MOST of the series' episodes except for
the first half of THIS particular season when he was ill [his absence was mentioned as marriage].
The video/audio quality is just fine [with me]. It's CLEAR enough to notice bruises on Mrs Ziffle's
arms, and severely nicotined fingers on ""Fred Ziffle's"" left hand. When he is seen on a phone, et-
cetera, he always uses the RIGHT hand... though he obviously was LEFT-handed.

Great series!

2418282,4,B000BITV1A,"The first two seasons, were entertaining as a cult-follower type TV show. The comedy is simple, and the situations are predictable, but the off-beat characters make it entertaining. This series shows some comedic wear in season three. The comedy gets even simpler, and some of the sharp-witted luster is missing. But, for people who enjoyed the series, you will probably want the third season to compliment the set. I bought the Movie...Return to Green Acres,....which, again, is only going to be purchased by dedicated fans of the series, and not necessarily Collectors of really good Comedy Movies. I gave it 4 stars, only because of my interest to add this to the other two seasons I already have...... Comedy-wise,....it's probably only worth 3.0-3.5 stars.

This beauty is thrown into a dump broken down house in the middle of a dopy farming community by her nutty lawyer husband. The farm characters are dopy simple idiots. The show is a lot of fun to watch. It is a simple, innocent delightful story. You won't be disappointed !!! Eva Gabor is lovely & the farm people are hilarius.

2418287,5,B000BITV1A,"Green Acres needs no introduction, so I will get right to the point. The first season was unique. We get to know all of the screwball story characters better than we do our own neighbors. The 2nd season isn't much different than the first. By the third season, you can tell that the writers are beginning to run out of ideas.

The Ziffels was a key element of the show. Fred, Doris & their son, Arnold, made for several wonderful episodes. The only member of the family that could be replaced was Arnold. He may have been able to do a lot of things that his human counterparts couldn't do, but after all, he was just a pig.

The original Doris Ziffel was played by Barbara Pepper, who died in 1969. She was replaced by Fran Ryan. It's not that Ryan didn't do a good job as playing Doris, it's that she just wan't Doris Ziffel. None of the Green Acres characters are replaceable. The show would have been better off had Fred just become a widower.

I don't think this show could have have handled a fourth season. That's the feeling you get while watching this Third Season. Even the glamorous Eva Gabor shows the signs of age and seeing her husband still doing the farming in his trademark three-piece suit is no longer a novelty. Even Arnold the pig isn't funny any longer.

The quality of the DVDs is excellent & Season Three, in my opinion, is worth buying. It is a Must Have for Green Acre fans. I gave it 5 stars NOT based on the previous two seasons, but by how it compares to today's comedy series. In that respect, 5 stars isn't enough!",1362873600,,1544,4.350694444444445

Season three introduces on of my favorite characters (after Hank Kimble)... the always sarcastic, disagreeable, arrogant and obnoxious Roy Trendell (Robert Foulk) who mismanages the phone company until he unloads it on the naive Oliver who mismanages it even worse.

They make us wait well over a year for another set of these to come out. Season 3 came out in December 2005, 13 months ago. I see all of these box sets of series in their entirity which were lame compared to Green Acres. Reality shows get box sets, tv series of today are released almost immediately when the seasons are over and yet, MGM keeps jerking us Green Acres fans around. Has anyone tried writing to them on their website? Has anyone ever gotten an answer from them? I think they give us the standard ""due to vast volumes of mail we receive, we cant answer individual letters."" Yeah, right. They used to have a phone number which I tried calling but all I got was an answer machine. Now their phone number is a Best Buy telephone number. You would have better luck talking to a wall instead of talking to one of their representatives. They don't know a thing about when season 4 will come out. It is totally ridiculous for the delay and I am not shy about saying so. MGM, put some Green Acres product out.

2418471,5,B000BITV1A,"Ever see a pig fall in love with a basset hound?

Ever been to a Rhuttabaga Festival?

Then you haven't seen life on ""Green Acres"".

The surreal 1960's comedy that has more corn than the Jolly Green Giant.

The recently deceased Eddie Albert stars with the late Eva Gabor.",1133913600,13,272,4.489795918367347
2418472,5,B000BITV1A,"Although later in the run, ""The Reincarnation of Eb"" is my favorite episode. In a series that was loony to begin with, I always get a laugh out of this one. I think half of it was adlibbed! Every so often a DVD comes along that's worth buying...every season of Green Acres falls into that category. For those of us old enough to remember the shock of CBS' cancelling these so-called ""rural shows"" in one fell swoop, it's a vote of confidence in great entertainment. What a wonderful show Green Acres was...and is!",1133308800,21,513,4.526881720430108
2418473,5,B000BITV1A,"Well, fellow fans (& the uninitiated-yet-curious), it's time to celebrate once again; so order yourselves a nice, big chocolate-chip pizza (better known to us fans as a ""Yucccccch!"") and settle down to a one-of-a-kind sitcom that has just entered its three greatest seasons!

And an exemplary season the '67-'68 episodes were: such all-time champs as ""The Rutabaga Story,"" a masterpiece of absurdity in which the denizens of Hooterville (much to Oliver's consternation) are antsy to put themselves on the world's food map by promoting their greatest specialty......rutabagas!  The topper, of course, is Lisa's unforgettable flight in a helium balloon, dropping miniature bag samplings of said delicacy, proclaiming ""Eat Hooters-ville roo-ta-beggers!!!""

Another top-ten episode would have to be ""Instant Family,"" in which Oliver & Lisa unexpectedly must mind a brood of four (while Mom's busy delivering Number Five).  The series sets the cliche honey-I'm-home sitcom genre on its ear, besting the Bradys even before those folks even came to be!!!  (It also gives the concurrent Doris Day/Brian Keith feature ""With Six You Get Egroll"" a good run for its money.)

In ""Our Son The Barber,"" Oliver grudgingly shells out money (& his photo I.D.) to let Eb take a correspondence course in being a barber.......Eb practicing his shaving on a mannequin is uproarious beyond words.

In ""Home Is Where You Run Away From,"" a runaway kid--going by the name of ""Carlos Hot-Peppers""--ducks out in various sections of Hooterville.

There's the legendary two-parter, ""A Star Named Arnold Is Born""; and ""My Mother The Countess,"" with its immortal catchphrase (""Hail to the countess, hail to the countess, RAISE YOUR GLASS OF BEER!!"").  We also have the initiation of the plotline involving Oliver taking over the Hooterville Phone Company, making it an even bigger shambles than before; and the romance between Arnold & Mr. Haney's basset hound.

A comedic treasuretrove, needless to say.",1132704000,16,1972,5.352750809061488
2418474,5,B000BITV1A,"""Green Acres"" was and still is often dismissed as a corny country comedy.  But its inspired lunacy, with hints of everything from old radio comedy to Theatre of the Absurd, has been a major influence on shows like ""The Simpsons"" and ""NewsRadio"" (which is where the quote in the title comes from).  Creator Jay Sommers wrote every episode with his story consultant Dick Chevillat, and instead of bland sitcom scrapes and sentimentality, they filled their scripts with satire, meta-humor and outright weirdness.  No one can forget the various ways the characters noticed the opening credits, or the fact that most characters can hear the fife music playing under Oliver's rants about ""The American Farmer,"" or the fact that Mr. and Mrs. Ziffel think a pig is their son (something that is taken for granted by everyone except Oliver).

The show started out fairly normal in season 1, turned weird and wonderful in season 2, and by season 3 was at its peak, with memorable episodes like ""The Rutabaga Story"" and the two-parter where Arnold (yes, the pig) gets a chance at Hollywood stardom.  Highly recommended, but be warned: this is weird stuff.",1129680000,87,1143,4.932291666666667
8087069,5,B000BITV1A,This is one of my favorite TV shows that I watched as a kid and I still enjoy a laugh or two even though Ive seen them a thousand times.  I wish they still made good clean family oriented television shows like this.,1510099200,,215,4.0

8087071,5,B000BITV1A,"This is a very helpful series. For all those people that read ""Home and Garden"" you now have a program that shows the upside to farming.

This is the Complete third season, consisting of 696 minutes of run time; so I suggest that you start early in the day if you have to work tomorrow. And do not be too impulsive and rush out to buy that farm. The package comes with two DVDs and a pamphlet describing in brief each episode. However you better have good eyes as both sides of the DVD are recorded on, leaving no room for labeling.

Fort many this is the first time to be introduced to such strong acting characters as Arnold (rumor has it became dinner at the end of the series). For the rest of us, we have an opportunity to visit old friends and see an episode or two that may have been missed. With any luck we will have the opportunity to buy the next season.

Oliver Wendell Douglas, born on a farm, and stayed there for two days, wants to get back to his roots. The opportunity arises and he purchases the Haney place from Eustace Charleton Haney himself. His wife gets the opportunity to share with him the challenges to adjust to the farm life?

The third is more outfield than the second However it never loses that something that makes you addicted to the series and want more.
There is an urban legend that when the series finished Arnold became lunch.

If you appreciate this fine program than you will enjoy reading ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" by Frances Mayes, where the story is retold Italian style.",1505865600,,1512,4.385714285714286
8087072,5,B000BITV1A,I'm a big fan of the Green Acres show so my wife bought me season 2 and 3 as a gift. (We already had Season 1.) We are both enjoying watching them from time to time.
