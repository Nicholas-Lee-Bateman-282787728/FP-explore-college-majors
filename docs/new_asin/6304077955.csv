771038,4,6304077955,"Probably the scariest film I have ever seen. It is very disturbing, but a valid statement from our modern world about how people use and discard each other. Filled with the ""fear of the millenium"" syndrome, it is  distrubing because it is all so real. Not an easy watch by any means, since  you'll probably end up feeling that the world is even more f%$#*d up than  you could ever imagine.",956793600,2,389,4.450704225352113
771039,5,6304077955,"Mike Leigh, perhaps the most underrated or overlooked film director of late, creates nothing short of a masterpiece.  Through Johnny, excellently portrayed by David Thewlis, we get to see the dark side of London.  I  should only say that Mike Leigh himself is a genius--an overly used word  but in this case fitting--for having written and directed such a smart  film.  Equally interesting are all the other characters in the film.  Pay  close attention to the dialogue and you will note the genius of Leigh.  Also, you'll need to pay close attention because sometimes the accents can  be hard to decipher.  At any rate this film is worth buying.  Also worthy  of buying is Secret and Lies, Life is Sweet and the recently released,  Topsy-Turvy.  Mike Leigh, thank you.",953856000,4,769,4.852713178294573
771040,5,6304077955,"Without a doubt, Mike Leigh's Naked is one of the most brilliant examples of filmmaking I have ever seen.
David Thewlis is nothing short of genius as the aimless Johnny, a combustible combination of brilliance and  depression, who's mere presence in anyone's purview contaminates and  destroys with the effectiveness of Round-Up.
Mesmerizing and fast-paced,  there is no shortage of excellence in the smaller plots and characters:  Greg Cruttwell is spectacular as the pompous, nouveau-riche Jeremy, and the  two female leads, Leslie Sharp and Katrin Cartlidge provide well balanced  juxtaposition as two very different femmes damaged.
Not for the faint of  heart, Naked will test one's own philosophy, and leave you stripped bare.",952992000,4,731,5.473214285714286
771041,5,6304077955,"There are few films which have a lasting effect on you after seeing them, and this one stays with you. I wouldn't label any film with an ability to change your life, for that's too lofty, but this film does approach such a  level. David Thewlis gave the main character such weight, I almost felt it  to be a documentary, and without the stylistic filters of shakey-handycam  movies, which are in prevalence in the avante-garde right now. That's  pretty impressive in my book. It's truly one of the great films of the  times. I hate to be an aesthetic dictator, but anyone who doesn't like this  film owns a numb life.",944438400,4,617,4.513513513513513

771043,5,6304077955,"Having been a fan of Mike Leigh's approach to filmaking for many years, I admit that Naked is the best of the lot.  It's actually a classic story in the ""Everyman"" tradition.  Thewlis' performance breaks all the  boundaries of contemporary acting and makes us feel almost as if we were  watching a docudrama - rather than a work of fiction.  And although some  viewers may criticize the film's ""lack of plot"", Thewlis' Johnny  is indeed fulfilling the journey of human experience.  Full-fleshed  humanity experiencing all that this life offers.  While, at the same time,  reflecting upon life in a fruitless attempt to find meaning to why we are  here.  It's a difficult film, but then so is life to those of us who do not  distract ourselves with escapist pursuits.  The film teaches us that a life  well lived is a painful one.  This is what we learn in ""Everyman""  and it's what we learn in Naked.  Bravo, Mr. Leigh!",932774400,3,919,4.63125
771044,4,6304077955,"This fantastically dark film is stunning in its singular intensity and its refusal to dumb down its subject matter.  There is very little real plot, but lots of interesting scenes will hold your attention.  If you are not a  fan of movies with a lot of dialogue you probably won't enjoy this film  very much, but at the same time if you think that cerebral conversations  about lofty subjects elevate a character you will find this to be a  disturbing surprise. Worth seeing.",912470400,2,475,4.662650602409639
771196,5,6304077955,"NAKED is not an easy watch for most viewers. But it is not that should discredited after one screening either. This Mike Leigh masterpiece is one you'd have to look at more than once to get the point(s). You really have to delve to catch the main character's drift, and that of the others--main and supporting.

Johnny (played by should-have-been-Oscar-winner David Thewlis) is drilling mad about the ""ghost world"" that is post-Thatcher England, and does not hesitate to voice it. Though he communicates through [supposed] non sequitur words and actions. (Similar to Enid in the Terry Zwigoff adaptation of GHOST WORLD). In addition, the late Katrin Cartlidge's performance as Sophie makes you want to take her and hold her in consolation. Louise, Johnny's ex (played by Lesley Sharp) shows that independent women do not have to be strong-willed to the point of pride. Plus, she is a picture who Johnny wants in a woman--though he never says so out loud. Greg Cruttwell's Sebastian shows how cowardly men (and women) tend to be when they want so desperately to be ""clothed"" in superiority and grandeur. And the consequences of not taking off that mask.

Thanks to the essays accompanying the Criterion Collection copy, the first viewing of NAKED does not have to be the last or one of many before connecting to story and characters.

Imagine. Johnny is the driving student that Scott (in HAPPY-GO-LUCKY) would have loved to have. In fact, NAKED in a sense does on a darker note what HAPPY-GO-LUCKY would do on a bright and sunnier note fifteen or so years later. Johnny is ""too mad"" (as some may put it); Poppy is ""too glad.""

Introverts of the world, who notice how bad, ugly, phony, and a drag modern society is yet seek better, NAKED is the film to see, share, and try to relate to. Not since DO THE RIGHT THING or CRASH has a film been so brutally honest. Mike Leigh is without a doubt the UK filmmaker of and beyond his age. And a storyteller not to be overlooked by anyone, anywhere.",1397692800,6,1989,4.706896551724138
771197,5,6304077955,"Say what you want to about the poorly written female characters and the overly dark material.

The real gem here is the performance of David Thewlis. In particular, the dialogue with the night security guard provides some of the most engaging back and forth cinema has to offer.

I don't really have an in-depth review to offer. I just wanted to contribute a 5-star rating while singing the praises of David Thewlis. Easily a career best performance.",1383436800,2,450,4.8311688311688314
771198,4,6304077955,"A rather strange film with a strange cast of characters ostensibly centered around a narcissistic and arrogant ""philosopher.""  All the characters, which include several put-on women and the men who abuse them, lead rather sad and squalid lives, which renders the film a bit hard to take.

771199,5,6304077955,"Naked is about as far from a pre-packaged formulaic Hollywood offering as you'll ever get.  The two hour plus film requires your complete attention and it's doubtful that watching it once will be enough to fully comprehend the film.  I saw this movie at a theater when it first came out and was simply stunned by Thewlis' performance.  I remember reading interviews of him describing staying in his generally despicable state for months before and after the three month shooting.  Since then, I've revisited the film several times on cable and was pleased to see that Criterion produced a lovely to watch DVD.  I watched both the film and film with commentary back to back, almost a 5 hour commitment, but well worth it.  Commentary features director Leigh, Thewlis and Katrin Cartlidge, who played Sophie.  Well worth a look and I found the descriptions of making the film as well as developing the characters fascinating.  Interesting to go back and look at the initial reviews of the film and the love or hate it generated among both audience members and critics.  If you're looking for a challenging movie, look no further and buy this one.",1373241600,2,1144,4.825641025641025

771202,5,6304077955,"David Thewlis as Johnny in Mike Leigh's Naked, is a force to be reckoned with!  He is as damaged, if not more so, than the unfortunates he happens upon along the way.  I can understand why he won the Best Actor award and Mike Leigh won the Best Director award at Cannes for this film.  After viewing this alone and then with several friends we are still talking about it months later.  It grabs a hold and doesn't let go.  Even though Johnny is despicable you get glimpses of the raw hurt he has endured and that in turn helped shape him into the poor excuse for a human being he has become.

The second time I watched it I started seeing the really dark humor of this film and by the third time I was actually laughing at some of the predicaments he gets himself into.  Katrin Cartlidge as Sophie was the other character that I couldn't take my eyes off.  Her performance is spot on and when I learned she had passed away at only 41 I felt a sadness for the the void left - she would have gone on to play other great roles.

The northern British accents were hard to understand when I first viewed it alone but then I put the subtitles on when friends came over to watch it and realized I had missed so much the first go round.  DON'T PASS UP THE CHANCE TO OWN THIS MOVIE - you will never regret purchasing it.",1369958400,4,1311,4.146245059288537
771203,5,6304077955,"Thewlis' character in this movie is just amazing.

771204,4,6304077955,"Naked is not a pleasant experience. There is much to enjoy about it, but the mood and plot are incredibly downbeat. That being said, there is a lot to appreciate here. David Thewlis is absolutely marvelous in the lead role. He is funny and charming, but at the same time violent and alienating. A terrific anti-hero. The score is wonderful, and the other cast members are very good.

The film looks and sounds quite good, which is expected from Criterion. The extras could have been a bit better, but what we get is good.

Overall, however, I cannot wholly recommend Naked. Not as a blind buy. If you are already a fan, the presentation is very good. If you've never seen it, I strongly recommend renting it first.",1345593600,2,714,4.5703125
771205,3,6304077955,"Mike Leigh is that type of director who seems to love his characters.  He loves to allow the audience to come to know them from afar almost, building delicately as the actors flesh out the intricacies that most directors may overlook.  There is an effortless flow to most of his works (at least the ones that I have seen) that you can't help but respect the approach that Leigh takes to creating an easy naturalistic atmosphere.

`Naked' almost feels like it was directed by a different personal altogether.

There is an awareness that is too present in `Naked', a self-awareness that hurts the film's impact.  It is far too aware of the impact that it is trying to make, so it becomes somewhat self-indulgent and off-putting.  Maybe that was the point, but it also plays against the film as a whole.  It doesn't help that there isn't much of a connective story here, just some random conversations over the course of a night out for a rapist fleeing a vengeful family.  I'm not against films that feature no actual arcs but focus heavily on character development, but sadly the central character isn't interesting enough to validate this approach.  The supporting characters are all far more intriguing and actually develop more insightful and poignant looks at the human psyche.

Many have toted David Thewlis's performance as one of the best of the year that was 1993, some even saying it is one of the best performances put to film.  I give that a bit of a shrug.  It is far too `on the nose'.  That's not to say that it isn't interesting from a certain angle, but overall it doesn't leave one with the intended impact.  Peter Wight and Lesley Sharp are far more ingrained in their characters and thus leave the viewer with a more impactful feeling.  Sharp especially glues this film together, for it is her at times silent observations that cement the film in some sort of emotional focal point.

The whole concept of Ewen Bremner's character, Archie, is a major downfall for the film for it tries to give the story an arc and fails to feel connected to the rest of the film.  It serves as a yin and yang for Johnny (Thewlis's character) but not in a cohesive way.  Johnny is a rapist, but mentally haphazard and arguably harmless (or at least he is painted this way), while Archie is a cruel and demented psychopath.  It doesn't add anything to the film and actually takes away from the heart of the film because it cheapens it.

Not to mention, Bremner's performance is gross.

At the end of the day, I see why some appreciate this film, but I can't fathom why anyone would laud it.  It doesn't know how to balance out its parts and so it comes off unfocused and somewhat forgettable.",1338422400,3,2691,4.585774058577406
771323,5,6304077955,"This movie... I ordered it and watched it the same night I got it. I was a fan of David Thewlis before I watched this movie and now I am a DIE HARD FAN. Mike Leigh's Naked is undoubtedly a classic, standing proudly with all the abstract favorites of the movie world like A Clockwork Orange, Pulp Fiction, and The Rocky Horror Picture show. Dismal and dark, Naked is a movie for people with an acquired taste for stories about people at the end of their rope.

This movie is explicitly sexual, including many scenes of rape, violence, and vulgar language, so be prepared for that. Although, for a movie so dark and serious, there are some very funny moments!

Brilliantly written, with award winning acting and succulent morbidity, I give Naked five well deserved stars, and I hope that you love it as much as I do!",1333584000,2,814,4.493243243243243
771324,4,6304077955,"Mike Leigh is toying with sexual politics in this bleak film. I won't say that rape is ""glorified"" because it's often consensual encounters that suddenly become violent. That may make feminists even more angry...there's little definition of just what degree of violation occured and whether the loser women expected many sexual boundaries.  Both men seemed likely to wind up dead or in prison by age 40.  One is quite terrifying while the other (main character)is merely misguided.  No happy endings here.",1324512000,,505,5.209876543209877
771325,5,6304077955,"My first contact with Mike Leigh's film Naked came with a series of soundbites that DJ's at the University of Maryland's college radio station had sampled and turned into station ID's. These included several monologues by David Thewlis' frustrated and angry protagonist, Johnny, including his rants about the coming apocalypse. This prompted me to seek Naked out on VHS, and I was both troubled and fascinated by Leigh's film.

Nearly twenty years later, Criterion has released naked on Blu-Ray, for the first time giving me the chance to see the film as it was intended. I'm struck by the composition and stark cinematography -- both of which hold up remarkably well, whereas many other films from the 1990's do not. And although the film documents a very specific time at the turn of the century in economically-depressed post-Thatcher England, it is still very relavent today.

Naked centers around Johnny, a young man from Manchester fleeing the repercussions of an act of brutality that occurs within seconds of the film's opening. He arrives in London, where he calls on his ex-girlfriend and her flatmate, developing a physical relationship with one as he longs for a romantic relationship with the other.

We then follow Johnny through the next forty-eight hours of his life, drifting through nighttime London and disrupting the lives of the various people he encounters until he inevitably returns to his ex-girlfriend's flat. Johnny's odyssey is at once satirical, tragic and so unflinchingly brutal that it becomes difficult to watch.

There is also a parallel storyline involving the owner of the flat, an affluent sociopath named Jeremy who is perhaps one step away from American Psycho's Patrick Bateman. Both Johnny and Jeremy are brutal to the women they meet, but are fundamentally different. Although the consequences of their behavior on the women they encounter is the same, their motivations are diametrically opposed. Without Jeremy, it would be impossible for the audience to have any compassion for Johnny.

Much has been made of Naked's misogyny, but I think it's important to understand the distinction between documenting misogyny and condoning it. Naked doesn't justify such behavior, but lays it bare for the audience to see. It may not be pleasant, but it's a part of human life that should be examined and discussed.

The film is in the middle in terms of getting the ""Criterion treatment"" -- besides offering up a solid HD transfer, it includes an interview with American director Neil Labute (In the Company of Men) about the film, who has also been charged with misogyny for his own cinematic studies of the dark side of masculinity, a thirty minute interview with Leigh recorded for the BBC, a commentary track featuring the director and some of the actors, and the original theatrical trailer (which makes Naked look like a relationship comedy). The extras all help to enlighten Leigh's motivations for making the film, but lack the ""film school in a box"" quality of other Criterion releases.

If you're coming to Naked as a fan of Leigh's other films, particularly those centered around family dynamics, I think you should be aware that this film is very different from his other work. It dispenses with his usual ensembles and almost solely focuses on a single character. However, if you're interesting into delving into the psyche of one angry and embittered young man and seeing how he effects the people around him, then Naked is definitely worth your time.",1323561600,4,3498,5.0625
771326,5,6304077955,"Yes, this film depicts brutal violence (especially towards women),emotional depravity and a procession of lost souls. But there are many touching moments of quirky humor and fleeting tenderness. This film is decidedly not sentimental and is not trying to give the feel-good take-away that some silly, unworldly reviewers on these pages seek. It is, instead, a masterfully created piece of artistic cinema portraying painful realities and real lives that are on the edge. The characters repeatedly just miss on making real connections with each other - It is one of those painful, voyeuristic experiences that strangely makes one appreciate life all the more - and feel grateful that one, at least, still has the opportunity to get things right. Oh, and the acting is ASTOUNDING.",1296259200,2,778,5.232
771327,5,6304077955,"...in its theme of drifter/womanizer, Naked however is altogether its own beast.  At once intriguing and appalling, in addition to some pretty memorable and f***** up main characters, there are a plethora of distinct minor characters that put in great performances as well.  I'm not sure what this movie said exactly, but you know fine work when you see it.  Part of what shocks so much are the ounces of truth that can be recognized in this darkness.  The other thing that shocks is the 'reality' these characters live in.  Taken as art and not reality, this is a 5 star movie.  Though there is reality in art, one should not be confused with the other.  Art is not a moral treatise, it simply says something that may resonate with the viewer, perhaps even bring understanding of something.  Or not.  This movie resonates either way.  It's pretty bleak, but it's a very interesting ride.",1268265600,2,888,4.707792207792208

771329,5,6304077955,"The 1990s were better than the 80s overall for cinema.  Not to give a history lesson, but the rise of the new independent market in 1989 (Miramax, Sex Lies & Videotape, etc.) led to  large number of successful independent films (the most since the 1970s).  When this film debuted at Cannes, in May of 1993, the decade was still finding itself (I use 1991-2000 as the scientific definition of the 1990s).

I think this incredibly well-made drama is a true 90s film.  There had been a few up until that point.  I would use The Double Life of Veronique (1991), Unforgiven (1992), Hard Boiled (1992), Short Cuts (1993), as great examples of the best of early 90s cinema.  And this film in particular is so well put together, that it is the first film I mention when someone asks me to indentify the best english-language films of the 90s.

Briefly stated, Naked is an incredibly well acted, well shot, and perfectly executed drama about transient people and how they interact in the digital age.  That alone must sound pretentious.  And when I first saw Naked on Criterion laserdisc in 1994, I thought the same thing.  But then the film simply grew on me.  This is a drama that demands that the audience sympathize with a brilliant-yet-brutal drifter of a man, Johnny, created and portrayed by the gifted David Thewlis.  Further complicating things for the audience, Johnny is from Manchester, a region of England that is not too well understood, even among Londoners.  But this film quickly makes you acquainted with Johnny and where he's from through the dialogue, which was put together by director Mike Leigh and his actors through intensive rehearsals and improvisations (making this film all the more remarkable).  They created these characters, the start point, and the end point as a team.  And it is an extraordinary work of art.

This film felt ultra-contemporary when it was new, and it still seems fresh today.  It was very well shot by Dick Pope, who has been Mike Leigh's DP ever since Life is Sweet (1991).  It features high-contrast day and night shots, revealing a London we seldom see in color films today.  Some shots - the 'catering carts' shot and the Johnny 'apocalypse monologue' in the office building in particular are  stunning.

Mike Leigh is not a filmmaker I would compare to Rainer Werner Fassbinder, but his dark themes and stagy dramatic elements in this film sure do come close to an urban Fassbinder film.  Like Fassbinder, Leigh  is both a playwright and filmmaker.  Each time you watch this movie, a new theme, icon, cultural or historical reference reveals itself.  This isn't Lost or a Rush album cover, but there are more than enough little bits for thinking audience members to chew on and discuss.

This film is somewhat experimental, in that it throws a lot at you in just over two hours.  It is not entirely realistic in that the topics the characters discuss are not usually what real people talk about when they first meet.  But I think that makes this movie all the more fascinating.  It is a real thinking person's movie - a true 21st century drama.  And you can immediately tell how much each actor was directed to construct their characters as much as possible.  Mike Leigh has his story take shape mainly through rapid and clever dialogue, and what a sweeping picture his actors' words create.  This is a movie about people without a home.  It is a simple yet rare theme in movies.

Johnny moves through London in a scenario loosely inspired by The Odyssey.  His journey takes him through over 30 sleepless hours, and 4 long conversations (or monologues if the other party is bewildered by his complexity).  But unlike The Odyssey, where our hero comes back to where he started to vanquish a villain, Johnny comes back to his odyssey's start point to meet another brutal, albeit wealthier version of himself.  That man, played by writer/director/producer Greg Crutwell (in his acting debut), is simply one of the greatest villains of the 90s, in my opinion.  His Jeremy/Sebastian character is at once unusual, unique, evil, awkward, brutal, and simply wonderful to watch.  Hollywood remembers great 90s villains played by Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Jack Nicholson, Kevin Spacey, and Ed Harris, among others.  But I will never forget this guy (he's an alt-villain, perhaps).  It is a real stroke of genius that Mike Leigh would construct the film so that the two male protagonists are essentially variations of the same theme (brilliant mind, brutal towards women, masochistic, perhaps suicidal), which allows this film to build layers and layers upon itself and the audience without hitting viewers on the head to pay attention to any one of the themes being thrown at them.  It takes multiple viewings to understand and appreciate Naked.

The editing and the film's score come together wonderfully.  Mike Leigh totally went outside his comfort zone to do many scenes that propel this multi-themed story forward (I think this movie set a record for number of shots and scenes in a Mike Leigh film).  Again, it feels fresh and crisp today as it wowed Cannes in 1993 (where Leigh took home best director honors, and David Thewlis was crowed best actor).  You just have to see it in order to understand what an amazing accomplishment it is.  Some scenes will sound like Montey Python.  Other scenes will feel like older Mike Leigh movies or plays.  And still other sequences are unlike anything Leigh had done before.  But the end result is Leigh's darkest and one of his very best works.  A must for any 90s collection.  And a truly visionary, risk-taking film that tries to dissect western civilization.....""in a quirky sort of way.""",1260230400,6,5681,4.833160621761658

You have probably never seen a movie quite like Naked.  It begins with a random rape scene and it ends..., well let's just say it doesn't so much end, as the movie finishes.

Naked gives you a tour of the dark underbelly of London as seen through the eyes of Johnny, an anti-hero if there ever was one.  An intellectual who is on the run from.., life? the law? his own demons? You can't really say.

The dialogue is fascinating, the scenes bleak as you view the desolation and wasteland of both London and the characters lives.

It all takes place over the course of a day or two, and when I was finished watching it, I sat with my mouth agape for several minutes as my brain continued to process what I had just seen.

Kudos to Mike Leigh for making a film where the characters truly dominate, and where you really, really, really need to pay attention to understand what appears to be going on.

771382,2,6304077955,"This is an unfortunate film, actually. Although, mostly interesting it begins to grate upon one midway through.  Mike Leigh's strengths are his ability to demonstrate the 'lives' of working class britons with heaps of wit, charm, cleverness and bits of rather heavy-handed (tho not quite sappy) emotionalism.  He's best when he keeps it light overall whilst making one or two quite heavy points.  The problem with Naked is that it is all about heavy with very little light.  In addition, Mr. Leigh tries but fails to lade his tale with deep metaphorical meaning in the way that the rather hideously bad film The Thief, Cook, Wife and Lover did although without the fantasmagorical posturing, pretension, piffle and puck. In a nutshell this is the tale of a working class Mancunian who is either insane or being driven insane by the workings of his mind.  His problem is that he is too smart for his class (that's breeding, mind), which shows in his glib verbosity and abstruse philosophical riffs which he bundles up in clever entendre and verbal puns.  The problem is that he is speaking university to working class yobs and yobettes which causes him to be alienating and alienated to those he interacts with, rather assaults.  His failure, or inability to connect on a purely personal, human level further damaging his diseased mind which causes him to act out more and so on.  Mr. Leigh attempted to stir in a few different ingredients into his metaphorical stew but he fails to, for instance, demonstrate that the working class protagonist's angry, abusive manner is equivalent to the posh anti-heroe's equally angry abusive behaviour with the difference being only that one can afford to 'pay' for his rapine behaviour while the other must merely take his rapes for free.  I'm uncertain why Mr. Leigh brought that psycho-social angle into the story because he had enough semi-meaningless flux to deal with in the story as it is.  There are other random bits of disconnectedness that I shan't bother to comment upon.  To sum up, this is an interesting but unentertaining, non-thought-provoking movie that is worth watching if you are a big fan of Leigh's movies.",1205712000,5,2166,4.9393939393939394

It has all of the worst traits of other movies that I used to think were bad, but now, in comparison to ""Naked,"" I am realizing were actually good.  These sour traits are:  rambling, meaningless, nonsensical, ""existential,"" blathering BS; disjointed scenes and lack of a story; characters that the audience has NO reason to like or continue watching for ANY reason; violent, misogynistic, nasty scenes that have no explanation nor reason to be included; a boring, annoying, worthless schmuck for a lead who should just be killed off to put viewers out of their misery; but most importantly, lack of entertainment.  Films are supposed to be entertaining, moving, provocative, interesting, humorous -- whatever the genre, a movie must have a REASON to be watched, a motivation for the viewer.  ""Naked"" has none.  The only reason I watched it is because I was told to study the acting technique for a film that I am working on, and believe me, it is NOT a film that holds your attention.

771384,5,6304077955,"Mike Leigh's dystopian, bleak London is rendered more forcefully in this film than perhaps in any of his others: a sense of hopeless nihilism pervades throughout and one is left empty, disturbed and yet somehow satisfied. None of the characters in the film is actively likeable, and yet one finds oneself rooting for the self-destructive Johnny, a misanthropic semi-fugitive whose story provides the main thrust of the film's plot, to take as many other people down with him as possible. In his subconscious quest to do just that, Johnny starts off in control, encountering and psychologically devastating a sequence of increasingly hopeless characters, each of whom is flawed in a specific way which emphasises their own mental frailty. However, as the film reaches its conclusion, Johnny finally becomes desperate as he encounters his own essential weakness and turns his attacks on himself. He is offered an olive branch: a last-minute way out, but ultimately, he refuses to accept it, preferring instead to continue his journey all the way to the bottom. French nihilism owes a debt here: one sees echoes of this film in the work of Michel Houllebecq, Gaspar No&eacute; and R&eacute;my Belvaux, among others.",1185494400,3,1212,5.188775510204081

Thewlis gives a virtuosic performance as Johnny, spewing abrasive, apocalyptic vitriol about women, God, and bourgeois society, when he isn't simply humiliating those in his immediate vicinity, like Louise and Sophie. Dreary settings and encounters with a variety of sad characters transform Johnny's bleak rants into an indictment of sorts against England's rotting welfare state.

771387,5,6304077955,"I first rented this movie not knowing really what to expect.  I had heard from a friend of mine overseas that this was a wonderful movie, something I just had to see.  I had fallen in love with Thewlis's performance as Remus Lupin and just needed to see more that he had been in.  At this point I had already watched some other movies with him in impressive roles, namely Gangster No. 1, Black Beauty and Total Eclipse, which I thought were all wonderful  Then I finally watched Naked and I was blown away!

His Johnny is not a nice man, not by any sense of the word.  He is rude, demeaning, cocky, and doesn't care a lick about anyone, including himself I am sure.  But he is also intelligent and funny in a sort of sadistic way, and I found that I could not help identifying with this character.  What a brilliant piece of art and look at humanity this film is, kudos to Mike Leigh for making such a rough and tumble look at the darker side of things.

My husband recently bought me the Criterion Collection Naked and I even got him to watch, and later admit to enjoying, the movie.  I would comment on my favorite parts, but there are too many to point out.  Every supporting actor in this really makes each scene different and each has its own feel and chemistry between the actors.  All involved did a wonderful job.

Oh and to the Remus Lupin fans (which I am of course, fangirl to the end!), there is a joke in there about werewolves that is pretty funny, given that he made this movie years before Azkaban. :)",1169769600,3,1517,4.299295774647887
771388,5,6304077955,"Mike Leigh's organic masterpiece, Naked, is a raw, unflinching character study of a man on the run from himself and everyone around him.  The setting of his journey takes place in the midst of poverty and loss of social identity during the thick of the Thatcherism era.  With Naked, he integrates the environment into his narratives much more deliberately than most others.  We get a sense that Mr. Leigh has a lot to say.  He delivers biting commentary on society, and how it affects the relationships of its characters.  All of the characters could even be viewed as a fragmented alter ego of the director, acting as translators for all his pent up anger and honest views of society under Thatcher.  In a sequence of literary symbolism, in which the main character, Johnny, wanders through the grim, decaying streets of London, happens upon Archie, ""the Scotsman with a tick,"" who is pacing around violently, repeatedly shouting (for his girlfriend) ""Maggie!"" But, nobody answers.  That minor narrative device, speaks volumes about how Margaret Thatcher (i.e. Maggie) did not respond to her people due to the lack of involvement on the wellbeing of the middle and lower-class society.

The environment, in which he creates, becomes a crucial factor in transcending his message, and by doing this he creates more depth and universal meaning in his stories.  A process that defines this realism is his approach to creating the dramatic narrative through lengthy improvisations during the development process.  He never reveals his intentions to the story until he captures it freely, and then creates the characters, molding them in an organic manner.

Although Naked is a fairly heavy movie by mainstream standards, its subject matter is highly socially relevant, emotionally moving, tragically beautiful and strongly acted by its leading and supporting characters.
David Thewlis's performance is simply brilliant.  The collaboration of Leigh and Thewis during their extensive creative process and character developement conjures up a truly tragic and unforgettable character study through improvisation.  Mike Leigh planted the seeds, but David Thewlis breathed life into Johnny, immortalizing him.

If you are passionate about films, this movie should not be missed.  This is one of the best British films of all time, created in the midst of the underrated, yet highly prominent era of true British independent cinema of the 1980s.",1166140800,4,2435,5.272020725388601
771389,5,6304077955,"The greatest movie that many Americans have never heard of, ""Naked"" won best director and actor at Cannes in 1993.  The action revolves around Johnny, played by David Thewlis, who rampages across the London night in a series of encounters in which he uses, abuses, and hurls vitriolic scorn laced with brilliant humor.  Everyone Johnny meets is twisted in some way, and the effect is only heightened by the couple of seemingly sane people the film offers, amongst them Johnny's original love interest played by Lesley Sharp.

In one scene Johnny is admitted into an empty office building watched over by a security guard, and rages aloud his dark world-view that includes both time and space, and the illusion of the present, ""But you're not in it now; you're not in it now,"" because the future is constantly kicking the present in the behind.  He is as merciless to a tourettic stutterer as he is ultimately to himself, and Johnny pushes to the very brink of madness in a film that uniquely captures the razor-thin divide between genius and savagery.

From a brutal landlord's wonderfully mangled French to another superb performance by Katrin Cartlidge, ""Naked"" stands testament to the sheer raw power and insight that occasionally graces our screens.",1158537600,2,1253,4.976076555023924

I recall that it made me feel physically sick at the time and I described it as the antithesis of everything I believe art should be - yet it is, undoubtebly, art. It is a work of brilliance which does not shine. A black, black, diamond. Yet I still believe it should never have been made. Most people live in hope; this film denies that. Whilst there are some who recognise the nihilistic world it presents, most will be shocked by it - and it's greatest disservice is presenting the world as it is to a majority which will deny it, and live their squinting lives not seeing because of it. A work of too, too, accurate brillance.",1151452800,4,954,4.426136363636363
771441,5,6304077955,"A thick and intricate plot will not be found here and if you're looking for one, you maybe sorely disappointed. However, if one is looking for rich, life-like, and carefully crafted characters than this film will satisfy and appeal to people who appreciate realistic and witty dialogue, interesting and complex relationships and very convincing performances.

The relationships that are manifested through this work of art are also carefully crafted to perfection as well; a film with a total of four main characters drives this film's run time of (128 minutes) into what feels like a nano second.

  Our beloved protagonist, Johnny, will garner the majority of the attention and rightfully so because he is so entertaining and easy to fall in love with; Johnny is raw, incredibly intelligent, witty, voluble, gregarious and highly charming. Johnny is a mere vagabond; a drifter; a true conversationist in every sense who converses with people on all different levels of society; he is a criminal on the run and yet so attractively likable.

The consequence of this criminal act moves Johnny like a magnet to it's opposite pole, or in this case, to Louis's flat in London (Johnny's ex-girlfriend)
After being invited inside by Sophie, one of Louise's roommates. It is here that we are delightfully invited into Johnny's outlook on life, time, space, technology and human nature.

The owner of the flat, Jeremy, is about as despicable and chauvinistic as a male can get. This is more plainly manifested through his treatment of women and material possessions. To Jeremy, women are less than material objects but are designed for humiliation and sexual abuse. He interchanges women faster than a politician exchanges handshakes at a campaign rally. Jeremy's brief appearances are powerful as he abuses his role as a landlord with impunity as well as dominating women with his wealth. His complete disregard for people's privacy along with his general outlook on life is appalling and highly disturbing indeed. Jeremy's character is immediately and appropriately defined when he is receiving a massage from a woman and candidly asks her, ""do you think women like getting raped""?

Jeremy's distasteful traits are further enhanced when he shares the same space with Sophie. Unlike Louise, Sophie is mentally weak and submissive but strikingly attractive in her own quirky sort of way as Jeremy confesses to her.  Sophie lives very much in the present or day-to-day sort to speak. She is by far the least dominating character in the film. Her attraction to Johnny is instantaneous and his interaction with Sophie truly exposes her neediness and emotional attachment.

Louise is the alpha female of the flat. She is the only female who is able to directly challenge Jeremy's personality. Her relationship with Sophie can be best described as delicately calculated. They are not close in any emotional sense, more like an economical one, but nonetheless, they make the best of living with each other. Interestingly enough, there relationship evolves into something a little deeper when Jeremy feels it necessary to spend the night.

The relationships between these four main characters are captivating because all of their performances are convincing and seem so very real. Observing Johnny's interaction with people is entertaining and very enlightening; no one is left unscathed when sharing the same space with him, not even the mentally unstable.  The real power in this film lies in the main character, Johnny, and the director's ability to invoke sympathy and compassion for a man who has committed such a horrid criminal act of rape.

By the end of the film we forget about Johnny's mistakes, in fact, we are so interested in Johnny's past life and where the forces of nature will take him that we don't want to see him leave.  It is quite saddening actually. Initially, Johnny begins with a clear concrete destination, towards the end of the film, he becomes a free-floating leaf during a fall breeze in the streets of London once again because According to Johnny, he has an infinite amount of places to go, but it's where he stays is the problem.

On a side note, I feel it would be unfair not too mention the beautiful score to this film by Andrew Dickson, another masterpiece from start to finish. It's too bad you cannot purchase this anywhere as I have tried many times with failure.",1144972800,3,4389,5.035862068965518

One reviewer in the Chicago Trib said that his portrait of homeless Johnny is equal to Shakespeare's Richard III as king.  It was a tour-de-force; a man so strung out, on the edge, and largely because his considerable intellect couldn't compromise the world he inhabited.  It was too horrific and he couldn't make it work.  Perhaps he reads too much.  He is paralized intellectually, hence emotionally.  Leigh at the end shows us what he should do, what is important in all the muck.  SPOILER -  The love of a good woman, but Johnny is simply unable to connect.  The last shot of him hobbling down the middle of the street, in pain, but with no other way open for him, is truly compelling.  end of SPOILER - This is not an easy movie; like ""Riff-Raff"" of the year before, it shows an English middle lower class in utter disarray.

771445,5,6304077955,"Mike Leigh generates the ideas for his films through intense reflections on an original idea that interests him.  Through his cerebral process and in corporation with the cast, he fleshes out the characters and the story around the conceptual idea, which brings both filmmaker and cast together into an enlightening experience.  Before shooting the film, both Leigh and the cast can identify themselves with the characters to the very essence of their being, which offers a deeper and more meaningful character.  Thus, Leigh centers most of his film on himself, as the idea originates within him. This is also the case with Naked.

The title that Leigh applied to his 1993 cerebral mesh of cinematic cynicism does tangibly imply the notion of self-exposure.  Even though it might, and does, suggest a physical display of the human anatomy, the title, more accurately, provides an allusion towards the complete revelation of the character, Johnny (David Thewlis), in the film.  Naked offers an absolute exposure of Johnny's thoughts, values, and other accumulated information both assimilated and adapted throughout a lifetime.  Nothing is too sacred, or secret, in Leigh's film, which viciously displays Johnny's contempt for society as a whole.  The contemptuous mood of the film filters through Johnny's personal confessions with strangers and outsiders, which seemingly rests within the highly intelligent, but mutilated mind of Johnny.  In a sense, this confessional approach of telling the tale of Johnny, functions almost like a personal purging of Leigh's own implacable characteristics.

A dark and secluded alley strikes the audience's retina in the initial scene.  The sporadic light in the alley exposes some of the bare red brick and a little of the dirty cement underneath.  The camera shakily and swiftly advances through the narrow alleyway accompanied by the intensifying sound of carnal lust.  A rapid succession of frames moves the audience closer to a man and a woman that, at first, seem to express their shameless desires for one another, when suddenly the man turns violent and grabs the woman's throat and wrist.  He continues his repeated hip thrusting motion while the woman begins to whimper and begs him to stop.  Abruptly, the man ceases his defilement of the woman, which gives the woman an opportunity to escape.  This man is Johnny.

From the brief, yet disturbing opening, the audience quickly discovers the dark side of Johnny, as he truly becomes the antihero. Most viewers will deem Johnny after his actions, as a spineless beast without moral fiber that deserves the worst possible punishment.  This is a notion that Johnny seems to be highly aware of, as he consequently steals a car and escapes the possible repercussions of social shame and the possibility of severe punishment.  However, what trigged Johnny to commit this vile act nourishes the curiosity, as he does have a strong sense of what is right and wrong.

The lengthy cinematic rationalization of Johnny begins when he seeks refuge in London, where an old girlfriend becomes his last opportunity for temporary sanctuary.  Antagonistically, Johnny thrusts his hostile and negatively skewed perspective of life on all that enter his existence such as the ex-girlfriend, Louis (Lesley Sharp), her roommate (Katrin Cartlidge), Brian the Nightwatchman (Peter Wight), a Scot with a severe tick problem (Ewen Bremner), and the sadistically misogynic Jeremy (Greg Cruttwell).  Everything from childhood trauma with his mother's sinful occupation to religious debates eventually leads into existentialism in regards to predetermined existence exposed by Nostradamus to the big bang theory.  Eloquent criticism oozes out of Johnny's spiteful mouth with intentional scornfulness that forms cerebral depositions in regards to the misery humanity faces.  All of these lengthy viewpoints should be revered and cherished, as Johnny emerges with a conviction similar to Achilles' faith in his own invulnerability.  It gets to the point where Johnny's ridicule of the society becomes intriguingly entertaining while his supreme ego crushes all verbal opposition with articulate and depressing gibberish.

Within the strong conviction of his own intelligence an immediate weakness surfaces in Johnny, as he always sees the glass as half full.  One of his strongest and self-supporting comments, ""...you might already have had the happiest moment in your whole life and all you got to look forward to is sickness and purgatory.""  In essence, Johnny's depressing cognitive skills seem to prevent himself from climbing out of the deepest of intellectual pits, as he always pushes himself down with his own negative perspectives while always assimilating newly acquired information to his already pessimistic life philosophy.  Johnny is that kind of person that brings darkness and sickness into the existence, which so many attempt to escape with self-help books and expensive shrinks.  However, Leigh seems to be painfully aware of this notion, as he exuberantly dives into this project to pull out something extremely dark within himself by exorcizing his own cerebral demons by fully exposing himself.

Naked opens with a despicable scene, an event that most could never see themselves accomplishing.  Through this scene, Leigh captures self-hatred through Johnny's existence in darkness, shadows, and an environment from which people strive to escape.  Nonetheless, Johnny seeks out these depressive times and places both physically and cerebrally, which the script and mise-en-scene so powerfully displays.  David Thewlis' performance is straight-out spectacular, as he embodies physically, intellectually, and spiritually the archetype for gloominess.  It is a performance that went under the Oscars radar most likely due to its negative content, but nonetheless, Thewlis mesmerizes, antagonizes, and amuses any viewer in any continent.  Lastly, Naked provides a cinematic canvas upon which Leigh freely reveals the darker parts of personal self-reflection, which offers humanity a chance through understanding and deeper contemplation beyond the mere glumness of existence.",1128816000,12,6160,5.4883474576271185

The auditorium was empty except for an old woman and two strange men who, lured by the title and the fishnet stockings on the original poster, had obviously come expecting a different kind of movie than the one they got.  There were times during the screening when I almost felt as if the theater had become part of the movie.

This is a film that's fascinating, but, damn, it's a bit of a ride.  I'm frequently catching it late at night, on IFC, and even just a few moments almost always wear me out -- definitely a movie that brings to your attention when you need to go to bed.  I appreciate ""Naked,"" as a filmic experience, and it is indeed an incredible one, but I have to wonder if this is what movies are supposed to do.

Still, it does what it does and what it does is unlike anything else you could want to find.

David Thewlis may have made a mistake starring in this because he is so brilliant, so engaging, so horrifying, so smart, so black that to this day, I still have a hard time seeing him as any other character -- whether he's in ""Gangster #1"" or ""The Prisoner of Azkaban.""  It's great work.  He'll make you laugh, he'll make you cry, he'll make you carsick.

I'd also like to nominate the scene between Johnny and the security guard -- their discussion of time, and space, and barcodes and apocalypse and Dadaist nuns -- to be elected to the office of the great scenes of the 90s, and to take a place on the larger list of the great cinematic moments altogether.",1127433600,61,1540,4.29757785467128
771448,3,6304077955,"Brilliant British direct Mike Leigh's ""Naked"" was one of the boldest films of the 1990's -- an utterly compelling and completely harrowing look a the life of unemployed drifter Johnny as he makes his way through the streets of London.  He stays a while with a former girlfriend, seduces her roommate and engages in philosophical and existential conversations with people he meets.

Everything you have heard about the performance of David Thewlis as Johnny is true, and then some.  There is not a false note in it and it is a mesmerizing turn that sustains itself in the memory long after the two hour movie is over.  It is probably that flawlessness that caused him to be overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences come nomination time.  To have played such a gruff and unpleasant character must have made it difficult for Academy members to separate the actor from the character.  Compare his performance here with the one his is probably best known for (Professor Lupin in ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"") and be prepared to be blown away.

Having said all of this I must qualify things.  This movie is *NOT* for everybody.  It is stark, vicious, and deals with unpleasant characters and subject matter.  Those who have not seen it, therefore, might want to proceed with caution.  This movie will haunt and disturb you.  It isn't without its moments of humor (note the conversation Johnny has with the security guard about the universal product code) but overall this is very gritty and very uncommercial drama.  Hats off the Critereon for giving the film an American DVD release and may it do the same for more Leigh films.

771449,5,6304077955,"It has been said that there is a fine line between genius and madness and this is certainly epitomized by the protagonist of Mike Leigh's Naked, a scathing, uncompromising portrait of an angry young man. Does genius preclude or cause madness? Most people can't see the dots to connect them unlike geniuses who are able to see the bigger picture. Naked is a film that is as direct and honest as its title suggests.

Mike Leigh's portrait of London is a drab, grungy one filled with desperate lonely souls and dirty, rubble-strewn streets - the antithesis of the warm, romanticism of Richard Curtis movies like Notting Hill. There is nothing romantic about Naked and it is Johnny's cynical worldview that dominates the film and is one of its most intriguing aspects. Naked is one of the most important films to come out in the 1990s. It is an angry howl of protest against Margaret Thatcher's `80s England.

The first disc features an audio commentary by writer/director Mike Leigh and actors David Thewlis and Katrin Cartlidge that was taken from the previously released laser disc. This is a smart, extremely informative track with excellent comments from all the participants.

Also included is the original theatrical trailer.

The second disc features ""Neil LaBute on Naked."" The director of Your Friends and Neighbors (1998) discusses what he likes about Leigh's film: the relationships between people living in a city like London and how they don't quite connect with one another.

""The Art Zone: `The Conversation'"" features novelist Will Self interviewing Leigh in March 2000 for a BBC arts show. Self comes off as pretentious at times (especially when he talks about his own work) but does have some spot-on observations like when he describes Leigh's work as being ""spiritual"" in nature.

Finally, there is ""The Short and Curlies,"" a short film Leigh made with Thewlis and Alison Steadman in 1987 about a romance between a hairdresser's daughter and a young man. This is a whimsical comedy and certainly a sharp contrast to the future Leigh-Thewlis collaboration, Naked.",1127433600,3,2079,5.02906976744186

He is smarter than basically anyone he meets or ever will meet but he has no job, no place to live and has no interest in having either. He arrives in London and sets out on an odyssey through the night to spread his philosophy on life to anyone who will listen. Doesn't sound like much of a film huh? Make no mistake this is one of the best films EVER made and contains a performance that can match De Niro, Hoffman or Brando any day. David Thewlis won best actor at cannes for his genuinely incredible performance in this masterpiece, and it's easy to see why. The raw power that he brings to this role has to be seen to be believed. Some people expressed surprise at his lack of an academy award nomination. Let's be honest about it. The performances that stay with you after the credits roll are too good for oscars. Day-Lewis in Gangs Of New York,Samuel L. Jackson in Jungle Fever, Campbell Scott in Roger Dodger, Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire, Newman in Hud and most of all David Thewlis for this film. Ignore the hype about the violence in this film. Robert De Niro played a violent person in Raging Bull and what did he get? A golden globe AND the oscar. David Thewlis lost because he played this role with unblinking conviction. De Niro was sexually violent in CAPE FEAR and he was nominated at the academy awards. Thewlis and De Niro both took the method approach to these roles, so why did the academy overlook Thewlis? If this film didn't win the best actor and best director awards at Cannes I seriously think that it would be virtually unknown. Now that Thewlis and director Mike Leigh are back in the public eye. Thewlis in KINGDOM OF HEAVEN and Leigh with his harrowing VERA DRAKE, it is a perfect time for a new audience to discover NAKED and see it for what it is a masterpiece. Like always the best films are sadly unavailable on dvd. This film is one of those rare times when I'd even settle for an extras free disc. If it wasn't for criterion, modern masterpieces like NAKED would come out on dvd with nothing but a trailer. There are two reasons why NAKED didn't win the oscars for best actor,film or screenplay: money and politics. This film wasn't marketable or politically correct. To see an actor like Thewlis wasted in rubbish films like Dragonheart is ridiculous. You would think that an awards academy who gave Sean Penn an oscar for his performance in Mystic River where he played an ultimately vicious and violent character and Anthony Hopkins who played one of the most evil characters of recent memory in The Silence Of The Lambs would at least give THewlis a nomination. Thewlis gives one of the best performances in the history of cinema and regardless of what the academy thought of the film Thewlis has created a character that will never be forgotten. At the end of the day a film like NAKED can't be measured by the box office or the amount of awards that it wins but by it's impact on a visceral level.",1125878400,41,3081,4.474245115452931
771511,5,6304077955,"The DVD release of this film is way overdue and I concur with the other reviewers that Thewlis is outstanding in the film, and to say the least, he deserved an Oscar award for it (given what an often vicious character Thewlis' character Johnny was, it's not surprising that the Oscars ignored this performance- after all, the Academy can't allow themselves to endorse a character who isn't Safe as Milk). His co-stars Katrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharp also contributed strong performances.

The commentary track in this set is fascinating and thoroughly enhanced my appreciation of what I already considered a masterpiece.

I can't remember if a comment I read (or maybe heard in the commentary) about Johnny was made by Thewlis or Leigh, but it was that Johnny is a character that is just a little too clever for his own good. Take the sarcastic bitter side of John Lennon without the hope and you've got a miserable man- that's Naked's Johnny all over. Although we see Johnny do some horrible things, he is also an idealist who is enraged by how far the world (and probably he himself) falls short of his expectations.

I'm glad Criterion is giving this film the presentation it deserves.",1124755200,8,1190,4.795121951219512

It follows the sardonic and brutal Johnny (David Thewlis) on a long weekend journey into the harsh London underground, as he berates, belittles, insults and insences everyone he meets to the point of finally being beaten up. It's poignant, thought-provoking, and brutally hilarious!

It also stars Gina McKee, my favorite actress (Bella in ""Notting Hill"", the girl in the wheel chair; and Nadia in ""Wonderland"") as a cafe girl who meets Johnny, takes him in, and promptly throws him out.

Just like real life, you wonder what makes him tick but you never quite find out.  Some of my favorite scenes are those with no dialogue where the camera just watches him standing outside a tube station or reading that stolen book.

771517,5,6304077955,"This film possesses a hypnotic pull that I am unable to resist. It demonstrates a clear argument against most human interaction. Johnny is on the run from doing something he probably shouldn't have.  He leaves Manchester and heads for London, where his ex-girlfriend Louise works and lives.  Their initial reunion is filled with tense silences and overt hostility. Johnny is antagonstic towards everyone and everything he sees. Yet, he does see, which is more than can be said for the rest of the characters in the film.
Clearly, Johnny is a stranger wherever he goes.  He's an outsider who loathes the hypocricy he associates with the inside.  It isn't that he is hopeless. Nor does he lack desire.  He desires that which exists beyond the palty grasp of human desire. He has heretofore avoided being nailed to the floor with compensations for thwarted, vulgar human desire.  There is no pleasure in consuming for Johnny. There is no pleasure in most things that he, or any other human, might covet.
Johnny believes in an angry, vengeful Judaic god that hates mankind. He seems to believe that humanity is a scourge on the planet. He obsesses over eschatological xtianity. He seems rather unimpressed with the basic living apparatus most civilized humans take for granted.  He certainly finds it most economical to degrade women as he sees fit.  Johnny is rare.  His truths are scalding to those careful, complacent types who make up the world of false ideals and false hopes. He will forever be alien in their world.  He will forever spit on their world.  But he is human.  He longs for attention, if not affection.  He is capable of feeling something other than the pure balm of hate.
The performances are all stunning in this film.  I particularly enjoy the late Katrin Cartlidge's turn as ""wicky-wacky"" Sophie. She's so wonderfully disturbed.  Her bouts of hysterical gibbering, her pathetic desperation to be cared for by anyone at all--are prize winning entertainment.  Cartlidge makes Sophie completely reprehensible in the end.  That is quality work.  Claire Skinner as Sandra is possessed with some festering inability to complete any of her sentences.  She's so perturbed yet so efficient in administering medical aid. She is also excruciatingly appealing--her 5 seconds soaking in the bath are tantalizing and simply evil in their allure.  As Jeremy, Greg Cruttwell creates an elitist who specializes in psychological torture. He's quite nasty and possesses no redeemable qualities.  He is quite like Johnny, except he is apparantly loaded. He really likes violent sexual encounters--consensual or not. He's cool, confident, and destined to remain an enigma.  It is the rare film that allows such a consummate bastard to walk away.  His deeds go unpunished and poor little Sophie whines and sniffles her way to absolutely nowhere.
Then, of course, there is David Thewlis as Johnny.  Quite a lot of praise has been bestowed upon his performance.  He's so rabid and manic.  He must speak.  His mind is racing and he'll tell anyone who is listening what is in his head.  Except, unlike a person who is undergoing a manic crisis, his thoughts are lucid.  Nevertheless, there is nobody listening.  It is sad, brutal, ugly and very much true-to-life for many individuals. Johnny represents what happens with good minds that cannot be yoked to systematic measures of untrammeled ""truth"".  If he possessed more will he would certainly make Jeremy look like a slap-happy schoolboy with his first fisting mag.",1086739200,9,3511,5.053913043478261

771582,3,6304077955,"This film is worthwhile if you enjoy intelligent, thought-provoking films with good character development.  While action is basically non-existant in this film, the dialogue is second to none.  The film almost seems like a modern rendition of the life of Socrates, as it follows a young homeless philosopher through London as he comes in and out of the lives of several people for the supposed purpose of gaining a better understanding of life.  The movie is very philosophical in nature and deals with the notion of self-fulfilling prophecies and what most closely resembles extistentialism.  I gave it only three stars because the film definitely has its downfalls.  Most of the philosophies of Johnny can be found in ""Fight Club"" and ""A Better Place"", just to name a couple.  In other words, not the most original system of thought.  The biggest problem with the film is the astounding level of ambiguity.  It is unclear how Johnny ties in to the minor character Sebastian whose lives end up somewhat intertwining.  It is also unclear what the constant rape and abuse of women on the part of the men in the film is supposed to represent.  Chances are that you'll finish the film and ask yourself ""What's the point?""  This would not be uncalled for as the film seems to have no definitive message or theme.  Despite the fallbacks, the film is still worth watching because if you do find meaning in the film, it will probably be the conclusion, as it seems to show that despite his detachment from society, Johnny is nevertheless human and therefore incapable of overriding his basic human instinct of survival.",1013990400,,1612,4.864468864468864

The movie was written and directed like all films should be, the director called all the actors to the set with only an idea of how he wanted the film to work.

As for myself I'm going to watch it several more times to get the full effect. I understand that not every movie is for every person, but the ideas expressed in this film make one think, even question his or her own existince.

771588,2,6304077955,"British cinema likes to deal with hard topics and this has led to some remarkable films in the past. A crucial part of those successes is always  the portrayal of even the most unsympathetic characters as real people with  plausible flaws and redeeming characteristics.
Naked fails simply because  it forgets to do this.
The film's central character, Johnny (David  Thewlis) is an emotional predator. He preys on those weaker than himself  for his own amusement. Intelligent, persuasive and articulate, he has  little trouble doing so as long as he is with the right people.
Fearing a  much deserved beating, he steals a car and flees his native Manchester and  arrives at the house that his ex-girlfriend  Louise (Lesley Sharp) shares  with two friends. There, he has a series of misadventures in which he  crosses paths with an assortment of unlikely characters.
First, there is  Sophie (Katrin Cartlidge) a young woman who is attractive enough that  Johnny wants to bed her and stupid enough that she thinks that it means  something. Later, he encounters a security guard who invites him in to the  building that he is guarding, a lonely woman seen undressing at a window  who invites him in to her room, a man putting up posters in the night who  invites him in to his van and a waitress in a cafe who invites him in to  her house.
Not one of these characters or encounters is at all plausible.  They are moving in a world where fear and suspicion are key survival traits  and yet everyone the Johnny meets invites him in to their safe  zone.
Thewlis does a great job with the material that he is given and  almost manages to make you believe in Johnny but the task is too  hard.
Watching this film is a little like watching one weeks episodes of  a typical British soap opera. People move around and events take place but  nothing actually happens.",967680000,6,1853,4.662538699690402

Then he goes on a  tour of London meeting lots of unhappy people and basically  offending them  in one way or other while he incorporates his views on God, life and  stuff.
And there is also a mysterious and evil yuppie hanging around who  goes round beating up and raping women before finally going to see Sophie's  nueroic and supposedly squeaky-clean other flatmate who come back from a  disastrous holiday at the last minute.

7860511,4,6304077955,"Mike Leigh's 1993 film NAKED is a drama on sexual relations -- how men hurt women, how some women accept that hurt out of low self-esteem and a desire to be wanted or supported. It is distinguished by its remarkably lifelike characters. Most of the film was worked out in improvisations for several months before shooting began. Leigh wanted his actors to create elaborate back stories for their characters, fully living inside of them so that when the cameras started rolling they would be completely convincing.

As the film opens, Johnny (David Thewlis) has to flee Manchester after a sexual encounter with a married woman turns into rape and she threatens to set her husband after him. Stealing a car, he heads to London to crash at his ex-girlfriend Louise (Lesley Sharp), gets involved with her flatmate Sophie (Katrin Cartlidge), and spends a couple of nights homeless in London. Interspliced with this are scenes of Jeremy, a rich real estate broker whose sexual conquests serve as an upper-class counterpart to Johnny's own. Naturally the viewer is led to wonder what will happen when these two men meet.

Something is wrong with Johnny, he answers anything said to him with a rambling torrent of words, a logorrhea that is a form of intellectual bullying; this deeply wounded man seems to feel the best defense against the cruelties of the world is a good offense. Only 27, Johnny is so wasted that he is taken for much older. In this, Thewlis's performance is one of the masterful screen portrayals of an eccentric or mentally ill person, like Dustin Hoffmann in RAIN MAN or Peter Sellers in BEING THERE.

But all of the characters here are memorable, and my thoughts have often gone back to them in the time since I saw this film. I do have reservations about the plot, inasmuch as the last scenes of the film (which were decided only late in the filmmaking process) too suddenly change the tone and may seem anticlimactic. Nonetheless, I would recommend this film and believe it a great one in spite of its undeniable flaws.

The Criterion Collection edition of this film is ample. The audio commentary track features Leigh, Thewlis, Cartlidge (and so must have been recorded before Cartlidge's death in 2002), and gives many details of the back stories that Leigh had his actors create. There's Leigh's 1987 short film ""The Short and Curlies"", where Thewlis plays a nerdy young man whose continual repartee might be seen as a prototype for Johnny.

A less worthwhile extra is an interview with film critic Neil LaBute, which is not especially interesting or informative.  There is also the godawful American trailer, with its American advertising voice actor, cheery music that never appears in the film, and a series of one-line bits of dialogue that make the film seem like a conventional comedy.",1402963200,2,2812,4.872384937238493
