This collection is inconsistent in the DVD menu, and the chapter divisions may be better, but otherwise, is ok, on par with (or slightly better than) the BGC2040 you remember watching on a CRT TV in the late '90s

*** Two words of advice. ***

1.) There is a newer version of this collection, with slightly improved graphics, and massively improved sound (from 2.1 to 5.1). Unless you are a Packrat, the new collection is the safer bet.

2.) BUT, the new collection DOES NOT HAVE a Spanish dub. If you want/need the SPANISH dub, this is the collection you want!!!!.

I'll repeat in spanish:
Hay una nueva coleccion de BCG2040 con mejores graficos y muchisimo mejor audio, pero sin el doblaje en espa&ntilde;ol. Si quieres o necesitas el doblaje en espa&ntilde;ol, esta es la coleccion que debes comprar.",1493251200,,995,4.662857142857143
7934243,3,B000059S0K,Never grasp it's true potential but robot suit fighting monster robots is okay. Animation isn't mind blowing but isn't horrible.,1375574400,,128,5.45
7934244,5,B000059S0K,"In the year 2040, Tokyo is booming again after the great earthquake. Humanoid machines called boomers have rebuilt the city and it's better than ever. Except for 1 little detail. Some of the boomers go out of control and attack people. Along with the A.D. Police, the Knight Sabers are a vigilante group that destroy the rogue boomers. What these 5 women are doing is noble, but the police don't like having their toes stepped on. Despite that, the Knight Sabers are the best equipped to deal with the problem. They don't have any idea that a sinister plot is in the works. A plot so devious, that maybe even they won't be able to save the planet.

Bubblegum Crisis is really cool. The futuristic neo-punk setting is unique and the characters are awesome. This was one of the first anime I ever bought and now almost 300 series purchases later I have to say it's still a favorite. This anime is timeless. I've probably watched it through 50 times or so and it never gets old. There's nothing stopping you from buying and loving this show so go for it. You'll really like it.",1354060800,,1074,4.507692307692308
7934245,5,B000059S0K,"The earlier volumes were good; this one's great.
The story begins to open up as we are hit with mysteries, dangers, and revelations. From the word go I was glued to the television, itching for the answers to my questions. I swear, I thought the suspense was going to kill me.
This volume doesn't have as much action as the earlier volumes, but it doesn't need it. There's excellent drama here. I especially like how Nene's place seems reversed; in the last volume, Nene was looked down upon, but here, she's the one who becomes disgusted and disappointed. It's an interesting reversal of roles.
To sum up, this volume is fantastic. Careful though; you'd better buy volumes 5 and 6 while you're at it, or you'll be left hanging, desperate to find out what happens next. Highly recommended.",1069632000,,788,4.717391304347826
7934246,5,B000059S0K,"If you have seen the original Bubblebum this is 10 years later and the gang has some new toys. The 2040 series is more in-depth into the creation of the boomers and the Knight Sabers. If you thought Priss hated Boomers before check this one out. If you are a first time Bubblegummer all the DVDs are great seperate but all tie together for a blast and crash filled show that will make you rush for the next episode. In 3 words ""GET IT NOW""",995155200,,439,4.176470588235294
7934247,5,B000059S0K,"This is where the series gets good. You have to see the previous episodes to really appretiate the events that unfold here. The previous episodes were seemingly just that. Episodes. However in the main stories, they were always giving bits and pieces to the puzzle of the main agenda of the story arc. If you've seen the other series before this part, and are wondering if this is worth the buy...then wonder no longer. This is truely where the story, and the action gets good.",992649600,,477,4.623529411764705
7934248,5,B000059S0K,"This is the fourth BGC 2040 DVD, containing episodes 13 through 16.  Where the previous episodes were largely individual and episodic (with a glimpse here and there of the larger world), this volume expands the focus and starts to reveal what's going on.  The main plot arc, somewhat buried, now clearly predominates.  Sylia's mood swings, Mackey's reason for returning to Sylia's life, the origin of the hardsuits, and Mason's obsession with the buried work of Sylia's father--all of these are explained.
What's left, you might ask, since there are ten more episodes?  Without spoiling anything, as good as this collection is--and continuing the pattern, it's the best so far--the pieces are only now in place for the real conflict.  Even if you just casually liked the show up to this point, you will not want to wait for the conclusion.  Additionally, on a technical level, the show is much slicker: the animation gets better with later episodes (usually the opposite is true), and those rather cheesy 3D computer graphics effects are gone or nearly so.  It's a rare show that consistently improves, as BGC 2040 does.  The first disc left me a doubter, but having continued through this point, BGC 2040 is one of my favorites.",982886400,7,1229,4.932038834951456
