Georgina Cookson is a blonde bombshell and I really enjoyed her scenes involving nude photography. Hazel Court also does a good job. Movies like this are not available on Netflix, and that's too bad. I really enjoy vintage and classic films more than current movies.",1421539200,,443,4.349397590361446
