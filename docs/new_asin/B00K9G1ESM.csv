I got it on dvd, and it has a English track. but I will be glad when they put the Blu-Ray out with a English track on it and let it be Region 1 or all region.",1439769600,,288,3.5873015873015874
8656873,5,B00K9G1ESM,"I recommend this film, ""Azumi,"" to all viewers. I thought it was great! This ninja/samurai action film was directed by Ryuhei Kitamura. The story centers around 10 war orphans that are rounded up by a war weary master swordsman (Yoshio Harada). The reason for this is that he is going to train them to become assassins. Their future mission's will entail assassinating certain influential leaders. The premise is that in doing so they will help to rid the nation of future wars: Wars that have torn Japan apart, and has cost Harada his only son. The film fast forwards into the future as the young orphans have now grown into young adulthood.

The character Azumi, ably portrayed by (Aya Ueto) is confused and conflicted by Harada's terse ideology that the ""ends justify the means."" And Azumi will eventually question these tactics. In the meantime, SPOILER AHEAD: the 10 orphans are to do a duel to the death before they depart on their mission. Each is told to pick out a dueling partner, and then ordered to kill the other. Of course the best friends of each orphan pick out their respective partners before they are told to kill each other. If any refuses to obey this order, their sensei, Harada, tells them he will kill anyone who disobeys. This order which Harada tells his students is to harden them for the rough journey that they must now embark upon. Training is over, and their mission is about to begin.

While on their mission-journey they encounter many conflicting orders. Yet, they obey. This films narrative gets more interesting as it progresses onward, and these young ninja encounter many obstacles. However, one in particular is a psychotic samurai who is released from his prison in order to deal with these expertly trained assassins. And he is very, very good with his sword. The problem is that he is uncontrollable and relishes the torture of his victims. You just know that he and Azumi will be the final combatants. I can say this about the film, and that it is a very interesting and original Japanese film, and has some of the most beautiful, and excellent cinematography around. [I will overlook the CGI put into the film]

All in all, I thought that this was a very good film. It is a fun watch, and the characters in the film each give excellent performances. This film is just the first of the Azumi films. Azumi 2 takes off where the first one ends. I found that one to be just as good as the first one, and is also loaded with plenty of action, and incredible cinematography. I recommend this film highly, and if you are into samurai or ninja action films you will definitely enjoy this exciting action adventure film. ""Azumi"" is well over two hours long, and that is just fine with me, because I found myself immersed in this action paced film. Enjoy. Highly recommended!",1155427200,,2809,4.670707070707071
8656874,5,B00K9G1ESM,Super comic-book action; reminded me of the first Conan movie (this is a good thing). Young amazon in cape kills alot of men.  I'm kind of speechless about it...,1150675200,,161,4.551724137931035
8656875,4,B00K9G1ESM,"I have never heard of the Manga (written by Yu Koyama) in which this movie is based on and would never had bought it if it wasn't in a six pack with another movie I wanted to see, but much like Shaolin Soccer - I'm glad I did purchase it.

The movie follows the lives of ten orphans, including Azumi (Aya Ueto), who are trained in isolation from child hood to be assassins.  Before the ten warriors leave their mountain home they are put to a final test by their master in a scene which flows with so much emotion, I believe it triumphs the `Horse Head Scene' in the Godfather.

The assassins have one mission in life and that is to kill the three most powerful warlords in the land and finally bring peace to their country.

There is beautiful swords play, outrageous fight scenes, emotional character development, and even a slight love story involved.

One by one, we see Azumi's brothers fall which leads to the craziest fight scene I've seen where there is at least two hundred people on screen at one time, but this is only a warm up for the final duel between her and the deadliest swordsman in the world.

It's probably a low B level movie, but I highly recommend it to any fans of sword fighting.",1142467200,,1205,4.357142857142857
8656876,3,B00K9G1ESM,"Azumi brings to the screen the story of a young orphaned girl who is taken in by a master ninja; the goal being to turn her and nine young boys into highly trained assassins that will kill the most powerful warlords and bring peace to Japan under the Tokugawa Shogun.  Little do these children know what awaits them...

On the positive side, the plot is excellent and opens a window into the mysterious Orient.
In addition, the cinematography is really something else.
Furthermore, shot on location it provides for some amazing scenery.

On the negative side, the acting is not all that wonderful.
Moreover, the characters are much more like characters out of a Japanese video game than anything else.
Finally, the music is all wrong for this movie; traditional Japanese music would have been much more appropriate than western style rock/metal music.

In short, the plot, the setting, and the battle sequences are wonderful, the dialogues and the costumes are average, while the acting and music are below average and poor respectively. Though far from being a masterpiece, the film will provide for an evening's entertainment.
For those interested in Japan and/or Eastern/Oriental enthusiasts, I would strongly recommend The Twilight Samurai, along with Shogun, the Eighties TV series, starring Richard Chamberlain.",1141516800,,1317,5.19811320754717
