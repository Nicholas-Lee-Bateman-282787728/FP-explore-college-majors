7840640,5,6303198120,"This is in my Top 5 of the boys' silent shorts.  Stan has been living with Ollie and his wife for two years, and Mrs. Hardy has finally had it up to here.  A big fight breaks out, and she storms out of the house.  As luck would have it, very soon afterwards Ollie's rich uncle Bernal drops by for a visit.  Ollie already knows that he's going to get his inheritance, but only on the grounds that he and his wife are still happily married.  (This premise is very similar to the one in his earlier 1925 solo short 'Along Came Auntie.')  In a real bind, Ollie rushes back upstairs and compels Stan to dress in Mrs. Hardy's clothes and to put on a wig he finds (they use a barbell under the dress to give the appearance of a bustline).  This has got to be one of Stan's best performances in drag.

Unfortunately, Uncle Bernal isn't content to just meet the wife and briefly shoot the breeze; he decides the three of them are all going out to a nightclub.  Stan manages to continue pulling off the ruse at the nightclub, but when a stolen necklace is dropped down the back of his dress so the thief won't get caught, things start going south.  Ollie continually tries to retrieve the necklace, but every time they're caught, be they on the dance floor, behind a screen, or in a phonebooth.  There's lots of great pre-code humor in the second reel.  Stan's wig finally gets knocked off when they're exposed on the nightclub's stage when the curtain is unexpectedly lifted, and the game is up.  Uncle Bernal storms away, saying he'll give all of his money to a dog and cat hospital instead, and one of the other patrons also has an additional insult and humiliation to mete out to Ollie.",1137801600,,1680,4.363344051446945
7840641,5,6303198120,"In ""That's My Wife,"" the problem is that Hardy's wife has left him in disgust right before his rich uncle arrives and reminds him that he will inherit everything as long as he is happily married.  The only logical thing to do is to have Laurel dress up as Mrs. Hardy.  The happy couple take the uncle out for a nice time at a night club, where eventually the truth is revealed and a bowl of soup adds insult to injury.  The best gags in this 1929 two-reeler directed by Lloyd French for Hal Roach-MGM, involving the tipping of a waiter, a pendant accidentally dropped down the back of ""Mrs. Hardy's"" dress, and a drunk who keeps trying to flirt with Laurel.  Of all the many times Stan ended up in a dress, this is the best of the bunch.",989798400,4,737,4.242857142857143
7840642,2,6303198120,"Standard effort from the boys during their silent era. Made during the time the boys were just beginning to make sound films, this particular effort is somewhat sub-par. Stan dresses in drag to pose as Oliver's wife  so he won't miss out inheriting his uncle's fortune. The night club scene  has some laughs, but how often can you chuckle at tripping waiters into  desserts and having their faces covered in whipped cream? A film for fans  only.",930787200,6,445,4.740259740259741
