8223316,5,B000WGZBRY,"Eight-hundred thousand shipments of dangerous (hazardous material) cargo go out each day. The contents include flammable materials, poisons, explosives, and even nuclear waste. Trucks must segregate the materials by hazard class - eg. acids are not stored next to bases. Drivers are re-certified every two years. The trucks are tracked by Qualcomm satellite technology and communications. Some also have a dashboard button linked to law enforcement and dispatch. Dispatchers can remotely shut down a haz-mat carrying truck (eg. if stolen) and lock the trailer doors. The cost for this technology is about $2,000 per truck, plus $50/month.

Rail tank cars hold 30,000 gallons. The railroads instituted their own regulation in 1907 after several haz-mat disasters. In 1970 the DOT took over the function after problems with railroads funding their own safety measures. There is a car-train collision every 90 minutes in the U.S. The Yucca Mountain nuclear waste storage facility is supposed to open in 2010 - 40,000 tons of nuclear waste has accumulated across the U.S. Specially designed casks will be used, and the trucks escorted by the military. Nuclear power generates electricity for about 75 million homes in the U.S.

Con Air started in the 1980s, and now moves 250,000 prisoners each year. Schedules are not published and changed constantly for security reasons. In addition, the planes used are unmarked. Escape risks are seated next to windows and their handcuff links are covered with a special steel box. The most dangerous are transported in small jets.

Disaster responses to haz-mat spills start with determining what is involved, possibly using an industry response line. Responders wear protective gear, which may include scuba-type breathing apparatus and high-technology sensors. There is also a national Spill Center that can locate qualified cleanup crews.",1255996800,,1876,5.439862542955327
