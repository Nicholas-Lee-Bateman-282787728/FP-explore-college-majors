2354745,5,B000A2XC5I,"Gunslingers is a collection of 50 westerns  that have only one thing in common: they are all public domain and as such it is possible for them to be presented in highly affordable collections. I paid $24.99 for my set and that comes down to about 50 cents per movie. The way that movie tickets cost nowadays, you really cannot complain about this collection.

This deal is even better when you consider that many of the movies in this collection are available as individual movie DVD's at prices of $5 and higher. Many of the movies in this collection are presented in better condition than they are from other DVD companies.

Additionally, some of these movies are of such quality and/or proven audience appeal you just have to wonder just why the movie studios did not renew their copyrights.  Chief among these are God's Gun with Lee Van Cleef and the parody classic They Call Me Trinity starring Terence Hill & Bud Spencer.

All in all, a great deal for the money.",1178150400,8,968,4.604651162790698

These twelve double sided DVDs contain fifty movies. Those made before the 1960s are mostly in monochrome, newer movies are in color. Some of these movies are duplicated in other collections. They have a variety of well-known actors: Roy Rogers, John Wayne, Tex Ritter, and Gene Autry. Others are: Tom Tyler, Bob Steele, Guy Madison, Johnny Mack Brown, etc. These movie are rarely shown today on broadcast TV. These stories are comparable to todays dramas on television. Before the 1950s most farms, stores, and ranches were owner  operated small businesses; there were few national chains or franchises. Some of these movies were set in the 19th century, others are in modern times (automobiles, radios, and telephones). The older stories are concerned with the economic struggles that marked the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The right to keep and bear arms was well recognized when these films were made. Those set in the 1860s use arms produced after 1870!

I got it for $8 and if it goes on sale again it would be worth it for a couple of good westerns.

2354760,3,B000A2XC5I,"I received this 50 gunslinger classics just this past Christmas.  There is no two ways about it as far as it being a bargain.  It comes out to way less than a dollar per movie even when including the shipping.  Although some reviewers here have mentioned the lack of any real quality westerns in the pack, the truth is that for the price you pay, there is a very nice variety of entertaining old westerns here that make it well worth it.  My problem with this collection is not the variety of westerns, or selection, but the quality, which is very low.  These might be some good old time western movies for the most part, but trust me when I tell you they are certainly not remastered in any way.  Having the Encore western channel in my home for years now has come to spoil me.  So many of there 30s and 40s era westerns are remastered that one can come to believe they all looked that way originally.  Either that or remastered westerns are the norm in most collections.  In this run of classic 50 westerns, (of which there are at least a couple of other titles in the series) they definitely are not. The earlier ones in this collection are very dark with extremely poor sound quality as well.  And the darkness is not something you can just turn your brightness control up and fix.  They still manage to remain dark and muffled even with the best of fiddling with them.  In a lot of cases, I just skipped the poorest ones, which I figure was almost a third of the entire collection.  In my opinion, this set still remains a decent bargain for the number of movies you receive for the price.  Just remember when considering it that the quality is as low as it gets in a good many of the movies...",1276300800,2,1699,4.3354430379746836
