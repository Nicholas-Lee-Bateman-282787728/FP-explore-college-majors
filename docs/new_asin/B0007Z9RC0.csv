8054590,4,B0007Z9RC0,"""16 Years of Alcohol"" (2004 release from Scotland; 96 min.) brings the story of Frankie (played by Kevin McKidd), As the movie opens, we see a man entering a pub, ordering a drink and then leaving without drinking it, trying to make a phone call from a pay phone to a loved one, but then confronted by thugs. From there the movie flashes back to the very beginning of the story, as we meet Frankie as a young boy, whose father is an alcoholic and openly cheats on his wife. As Frankie grows up, we see him being part of a youth gang that terrorizes the neighborhood. Then one day, Frankie falls for the record store manager, Helen. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it al plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the movie debut from writer-director Richard Jobson (ex-front man of the Scottish punk/pop band The Skids). The movie essentially plays as a 2-in-1 movie: the first part brings us the hellish days of Frankie the thug, while the second part brings us how Frankie tries to redeem himself, It's been mentioned before, but it nevertheless bears repeating: the first part of the movie has a distinct ""Clockwork Orange"" feel to it. The fact that we see a poster of ""A Clockwork Orange"" in Frankie's apartment only drives home the point. Second, there are quite a number of memorable lines in the movie, courtesy of the voice-over from Frankie as he fills us in on what is going on in his mind. ""Sometimes for some people things don't work out as they might've hoped"" is the opening line of the movie, wow. ""Where is hope in a hopeless city?"" is another one of them. Speaking of the city, the movie is set in Edinburgh, and the city is very much a part character of the movie, just beautiful. Third, not surprisingly, music plays a huge role in the movie. At tone point there is a scene at the record store where a Mott the Hoople vs. Desmond Dekker argument ensues, just hilarious (we don't hear either band). As to the music we hear, we get a smorgasbord, going from Kate Robbins to the Velvet Underground to Roxy Music to Gillian Welsh & David Rawlings (playing over the end titles), and of course the Skids, just to name those.

Bottom line: this is a bleak but powerful movie, dealing with the long shadows of alcoholism. The last 15 min. are nothing short of gut-wrenching. No, this movie won't let you walk away thinking ""this was a jolly good time!"", so if you are simply in the mood for something light, try another movie, If instead you are up for a top-notch foreign indie movie with a serious undertone, you cannot go wrong with this, and hence ""16 Years of Alcohol"" is highly recommended!",1413590400,,2674,4.5
8054591,3,B0007Z9RC0,"It is a next movie of a grim British reality Scottish-style while following a boy growing up into male-a school team coach (not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hung/dp/B003L77GPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hung</a>) to be killed by his former accomplishers for no apparent reason.

Is it an attempt to next time glorify the state-supported manipulative psychological services or convince public that British could produce movies not worse than Stanly Kubrick?

What I like is a classic English used to present this mix of Shakespearean-style drama with the hooligan flick of the seventies.",1329264000,,632,6.423529411764706
8054592,5,B0007Z9RC0,"This was me in the 1980's, No Lie! with acouple variations,my mates did come after me,But my dad &mum were not like that,
This film  studys that hard to make decision of the old (Hard man past) or the kinder gentler (adult) you must become if you want a future.",1303171200,,261,4.22
8054593,5,B0007Z9RC0,"I caught part of this movie while flipping channels, and it grabbed me immediately.  I'm sorry, but making a comparison to Clockwork Orange or Trainspotting is absurd.  There is no fantasy element in this film, and no sensationalistic deaths or surreal hallucinations, just people trying to become better people.  This is a straight drama with an edge of noir.  This film seems to be a memoir of someone trying to alter the path he set for himself early on, and it is difficult to reroute himself.  Really powerful, sometimes poetic, and firmly rooted in reality.  If you appreciate complex characters, fine acting, and superior filmmaking without explosions, I would highly recommend this film.  If I had to draw any comparisons, it would be to ""The 25th Hour"".",1259107200,4,762,4.952755905511811
8054594,1,B0007Z9RC0,"I ordered the wrong video on accident but thought ""oh what the heck, I'll watch it anyway..."" What a mistake, this is a B movie from England or somewhere. It's full of violence and there is nothing recovery oriented about it. Save your money order something else.",1247529600,,263,4.617021276595745
8054595,5,B0007Z9RC0,"In 16 Years of Alcohol the viewer gets a look into the life of an alcoholic skinhead (McKidd), his troubled family life, his induction into the drinking culture, his houligan friends, two bitter-sweet romances, and ultimately his move away from being an alcohlic bad-boy.

At the core of this movie is Kevin McKidd, definately one of the most talented and versitle actors today. McKidd takes us through his character Franks life with zeal rarely seen (sorry Brad Pitt could never touch McKidd). McKidd can be hideously ugly and violent in one scence, stunningly beautiful the next. Throughout the film we are repulsed by Frankie, learn to love him,  and (spoiler warning) hope the beating he recieves at the hands of his old ""friends"" acts as a final catharsis for his old life (instead of him getting killed). As he was in Bedrooms and Hallways, Rome, Dog Soldiers, and Journeyman, McKidd is infinitely fascinating to watch, and certainly the best actor out there today.",1191715200,9,971,4.950920245398773
8054596,4,B0007Z9RC0,"This is very similar to it's billing. A slight touch of trainspotting with a huge helping of A Clockwork Orange.  A group of houligans let by Frankie stir up trouble in a scotish town.  This movie focuses on the childhood, and then growth of frankie after ""16 years of alcohol"".  This movie is told in a round, from end to beginning and back again.  Interesting perspective, but not quite as gritty as it could have been.  This did not give me the trainspotting tweak, or the bite of the Ultraviolence from a clockwork orange.  However, does give you a slight flavor of what an Alcoholic does deal with, and what a troubled childhood brings with it.  Worth while to see for fans of independent films, and independent thought.",1154822400,4,725,4.6171875
8054597,3,B0007Z9RC0,"Well, the begining comes off as a wannabe A Clock Work Orange and just doesn't come off quite as shocking or brutal as Clock Work did. Eventually you understand that this is a very personal story and pretty much soley focuses on the main character who does a great job at acting. However, the over all film did not leave me begging for more or even a second watch. It attempts to be brutal yet the content is honestly far from it. If your going into this film with the hopes of endless bar brawls and sheer mayhem on the streets then I'd look else where or just watch A Clock Work Orange again. I just feel the film did not reach it's full potential. If you want an emotional and personal story about one mans journey to become ""a better person"" then have at it.

8054598,4,B0007Z9RC0,"I'm Scottish, therefore I drink.  The first time I saw this film I found it disturbing, yet gripping.  The second time you notice the Ska (Reggae like) soundtrack even more.  Excellent acting and a theme that you can lift your mug to.",1146441600,4,234,4.523809523809524
8054599,5,B0007Z9RC0,"The title of this film is a very simplistic black and white understatement to a richly coloured piece of art.

The subject matter, alcoholism, and the toll it takes on both society and it's young adult men is approached and played out with great subtlety and artistry- this is no public education piece that preaches at the viewer. Rather, it seduces the viewer with excellent directing, fine acting, rich color, poetically minimalistic dialog and a great soundtrack.

I was surprised to read that this was not in an accessible format- the copy I rented plays on U.S. video devices and computers with no problem at all.

My only disappointment with this movie is the lack of an available soundtrack for purchase.",1140566400,,712,4.867768595041323
