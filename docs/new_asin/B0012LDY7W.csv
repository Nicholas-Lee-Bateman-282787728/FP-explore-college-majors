8246700,5,B0012LDY7W,"The dance routine was very fun but very challenging for me. I'm not a professional ballerina but I use to take ballet and modern when I was younger. I wanted to be a professional dancer when I was 20 years old I chose to be a mom. So I use this dvd at home . I just started dancing again and its a blessing to be able to dance at home . for some of the movements I needed more space, which I don't have in my apartment.",1391040000,,419,3.772727272727273
8246701,4,B0012LDY7W,"I wouldn't go straight for this if you're a beginner.  There are too many fundamentals to learn first.  It isn't a teaching video.  It is a class video. Each exercise is thoroughly marked by Kathy and then performed by her students.  All excercises/steps are done on both sides.  I haven't tried it yet.  I have only been doing ballet for a little over a year.  I still take an adult level I class.  It will take me a while to learn these steps and get to this level.  However, it is a wonderful example of something to shoot for as an adult (39) beginner.  I would highly recommend it to those who are beyond beginner and want to supplement some classes.  Its like icing on the cake that all the music in class is done to worship music. :-)",1296172800,3,741,4.258992805755396
8246702,4,B0012LDY7W,I enjoyed the class and it does have a complete barre and center.  The problem is that many of the exercises take too much space to be able to do them in your living room. Plus I felt like some of the allegro exercises were done without a proper warm up: There was no warm up jump.,1294272000,,281,3.9298245614035086
