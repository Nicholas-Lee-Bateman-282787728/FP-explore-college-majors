There is no song menu and the quality is poor.

It looks totally homemade, which is not a good thing in this case. Even the videos that made the band famous look terrible here with blotchy pixilation.

The video features an old looking Donnie Vie taking you through a series of appearances and interviews. The black and white up close ups of Donnie talking don't make him look very good neither does his semi coherent ramblings. Let's face it, this band was riddled with serious drug abuse which eventually killed guitarist Derek Frigo and destroyed any real career they could have had. These guys had talent but the partying along with the music industry destroyed them.

I loved the old band but this shows what can happen when time, and drugs take over.

There are a few good performances on this disc and there are glimpses of Donnie's talent but this video does not do him justice, it simply makes him look like an old has been.

I'll give it 2 stars for his talent but for the quality and presentation I can't add any more.

I won't go as far as to not recommend this to any Enuff Z'nuff fan, but don't expect any REAL representation of the band in it's heyday.

Do yourself a favor and go buy the first Enuff Z'nuff album and Strength and crank them up to relive the best this band could be.",1157500800,3,1503,4.362007168458781

This version features the first North American DVD release of the hit music videos for ""New Thing"" and ""Fly high Michelle"" as well as two full videos from the reunion show with Donnie, Derek and Vik at the Cat Club.",1152057600,,394,4.383561643835616
