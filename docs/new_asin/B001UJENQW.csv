3801766,3,B001UJENQW,"This is an excellent DVD.  Casual, non-pretencious and warm and welcoming.

The Blu-Ray quality is quite good!  Yet keep in mind that the video was often shot as long as 5-6 years ago.  You'll see footage with tourists still using pre-Euro money.

It was apparently a TV series so the DVD is divided into 4 segments.  The Amalfi Coast/Naples segment is the weakest with the Rome segment the best and most accurate.  Venice is also excellent.

Great DVD.  Better than most.",1306022400,2,472,4.728395061728395
3801767,5,B001UJENQW,"I gifted this DVD to my future father-in-law for Christmas because he is a huge fan of both Rudy Maxa and travel DVDs. He collects all of these and loved this particular one so much that he has watched it several times over already! I've watched many of these myself when we spend time with him and I have to admit, these DVDs are not only educational, but entertaining! I enjoy them immensely myself and I'm 21! Highly recommended if you love to travel, but have limited resources to do so and don't want to sacrifice on beauty, quality, education, and culture.",1297209600,8,562,4.519607843137255
3801768,5,B001UJENQW,"Somehow I seem to enjoy these BluRay DVDs better than actually being there. Sure are a great reminder of what one has seen on holiday, without having to worry about being pick-pocketed or ripped off and, you don't have to worry about the weather either.",1289952000,3,253,4.644444444444445
3801769,3,B001UJENQW,"This is a great video if you are planning a trip to Italy. The only reason I gave it a 3 is because I ordered it for a group of Special Ed kids.  We are traveling different countries and I pay for all of this out of my pocket.  The scenery and guide are great, it just may not hold their attention as well as one produced for educational purposes.",1289692800,3,347,3.942857142857143
3801770,4,B001UJENQW,"It's more of a guidebook type of video, with actual travel advice.  It's not terribly insightful, but it's not annoying either. Fortunately, even if you're not planning a trip to Italy, it's nice to see these amazing locations in HD.",1276646400,7,233,4.825
3801771,4,B001UJENQW,This product was everything I expected and wanted. It arrived on time and in good condition. I would hightly recomemnd this product to a freind.,1276473600,,144,4.8

3801773,5,B001UJENQW,The images are stunning. It is in 1080i but still looks fantastic. Very informative. Rudy Maxa is interesting to listen to and he gives good tips for travelling in the areas he documents. I felt I had to review this blu-ray when I saw one of three reviews from someone who apparantly did not update their firmware and had problems watching the disk and rated this one star. There are other titles in this series including France and Italy which are also filmed beautifully and are interesting. Also video is 16:9 and not 1:33. Beautiful widescreen.,1247875200,12,548,4.71875
3801774,4,B001UJENQW,"This is a great disc to own, It has amazing picture & sound quality. Something we all expect from Blu Ray discs. Rudy Maxa is a great Host & gives us several tips which include even where to buy bus tickets, what to look for at a bus stop etc. there are maps of the location..all this & more, which should be helpfull to all foregin travellers who can sometimes get confused in places like these.
The photography & music are first grade & this is the next best thing to being there.
now for the drawbacks : There is just not enough of Italy shown, considering the storage capacity of Blu Ray discs a lot more could have been included. plus some extra features like interactive maps, best & worst seasons to visit, List of festivals & local Holidays, Important Italian phrases or words & their english translation etc should also have been included.",1244073600,27,848,4.47741935483871

Great DVD for your HD TVs.",1243123200,3,69,3.6666666666666665
3801786,3,B001UJENQW,"Probably better for potential tourist or returnees, but as far as showing panoramic scenery? Not enough sweeping views outside, way to much indoor footage and conversations about museums and cultural specifics.

These types of Travel Documentaries will get better once high flying Camera Drones are utilized, but hopefully a new type of Cultural Blu-Ray will emerge, one with few words, sweeping views, and engaging footage of what life is like at ground zero in these story book villages.

The Blu-Ray really could barely pass for Blu-Ray. If I didn't know what was in the slot, I really could tell for sure if it were a Blu-Ray, or DVD.

IMHO, Anthony Bourdain, though his documentaries are geared at cuisine, does a much better job at capturing the magic than Rick Steves. After watching the raw style of Bourdain, one comes away with what life is actually like in these locales.",1446854400,4,882,4.906040268456376

3801788,5,B001UJENQW,This DVD gives a good overview of the main cities and attractions in Italy for first-time travelers.  I am disappointed that the DVD is so old that the former lira money is still shown in transactions instead of the Eurodollar.,1440201600,2,227,4.675

3801820,4,B001UJENQW,"This is a truly enjoyable programme, which shows in a nutshell -if that's posible- the glory of great italian cities.
Something I really missed was the close caption facility, which would have made the programme much more accesible
to then non native english community. However, in spite of the above this is a must who love Italy and for those who would like to travel there.",1398729600,2,376,4.712121212121212

3801823,2,B001UJENQW,I'll keep this simple. Rudy should have taken lessons in Italian diction. He miss pronounces almost every Italian word. He may have been reading Q cards with out a clue as how to pronounce an Italian city so as a result the presentation is flat and lacks credibility. Rick Steves does a better job on this front. If you really want to hear how to pronounce watch Magnificent Italy.,1369008000,2,381,4.536231884057971

3801841,3,B001UJENQW,"I expected this to be more insightful of the beauty and heritage of one of the center of our cultural and artistic revolution. This disc barely scratches the surface. Though containing many beautiful and picturesque examples of architecture and horizons, the scope is minimal.",1356307200,,276,5.295454545454546
3801842,4,B001UJENQW,"I have to admit, I didn't know who Rudy Maxa was before I bought this video.  My wife and I are heading out on a Mediterranean cruise soon, and I was looking for videos the help prep us and inspire us.  This video hits Florence, Rome, Naples/Amalfi & Venice...and we're visiting all those places, so for the low price, I couldn't see a downside.

Each episode is about 27 minutes, and therefore, there is little depth.  But for quality of content, it's about the same as an episode of Rick Steves' show or Samantha Brown.  I believe it falls somewhere between the two.  Brown, to me, is a bit shrill and she tries too hard to be ""cutesy.""  Steves just has better written narration, IMO. Maxa is an engaging enough guide, I suppose...just a little low energy.

The quality overall, is excellent, at least on the blu-ray.  You really get a good sense of the area.  The best episode is the one set in Venice.  I got several excellent ideas and jotted down a number of places to visit.  Rome feels the most insubstantial...he tries to cover too many places and once.  But honestly, that's actually a fairly minor quibble.  This video provides nearly two hours of excellent ""tour prep"" in a solid, workmanlike fashion.  If you're planning a trip, then this becomes a 5-star must-buy.",1342915200,13,1278,4.592920353982301
3801843,5,B001UJENQW,"High quality video.  I've been to Italy and this video does a good job of it.  It was very nice to reminisce of the parts that I was familiar with.  Good job ""Best of Europe!""",1341792000,,175,3.942857142857143
3801844,4,B001UJENQW,"I have researched and researched for our upcoming trip to Italy.  I bought this blu ray for more of a visual of what I had read so much about.  I really enjoyed it.  It's a good value and it gave me a few new ideas.  Ca'Macana, the mask store in Venice is now on our list of must sees.  Of course in this short of time it's impossible to cover everything, but's still pretty concise.  It was nice to see St. Clemente, The Bargello, and the mask shop, which are not Must Sees compared to the Colosseum and St Marks.  I also enjoyed the tips such as how to ride a bus in Rome and a vaperetto in Venice. It is a bit older since the money used is Lira, but the information presented is still relavent and only the lira gives away the age.  More then anything it makes me more excited for my trip.",1327622400,3,792,4.032051282051282
