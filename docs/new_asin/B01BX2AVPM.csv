8751855,1,B01BX2AVPM,"Do not waste your money; this is the worst product that the BBC has ever made. It is a short documentary which only fleetingly discusses the Norse events in Scotland. I collect historical dramas/documentaries, but one week after I bought the DVD, I sold it to a second hand bookstore. If you're looking for Scottish history try the much better series ""History of Scotland"". If you are looking for historically correct dramatizations of Viking battles, check out ""The Last Kingdom"". Now that is BBC at its best!",1490054400,5,510,4.873563218390805
