3490838,5,B001BEK89C,immagini molto definite audio non da meno &egrave; sempre uno spettacolo vedere un filmato in imax superconsigliato,1259712000,,115,5.823529411764706
3490839,5,B001BEK89C,"This was really informative and stunning to watch. Really enjoyed it, look forward to watching it again.",1248566400,,104,5.176470588235294
3490840,5,B001BEK89C,I learned a lot about the Nile River that I did not know.  The color and picture in 1080P was jaw dropping.  I plan to buy more for Birthdays.,1246665600,,142,3.8620689655172415
3490841,4,B001BEK89C,"The history is short and simply: ""travel the river from start to finish""

The film shows an expedition of 100 days aprox across the Nyle. there are differents situation and different people in this period

The best value is the image quality and audio track, the music (very good multi channel) is like ""tribal music"", and is perfect according to the topic.

The aerial images are very well realized, and achieve an interesting effect",1241481600,2,434,4.837837837837838
3490842,4,B001BEK89C,"I'm astonished by the review that denegrated the sound track (music portion) which I found intoxicatingly beautiful, at least if heard over an audiophile sound system capable of decoding dts-HD. All images are very near to actual 3-D but there are several shots where temple columns bend inward and others where rivers run uphill, but they're brief. On the other hand, did they not exist, I've have given this film a five.",1233878400,3,422,4.875
3490843,5,B001BEK89C,"We thorougly enjoyed this blu-ray and highly recommend it. The photography was excellent with some great whitewater photography. The Blue Nile scenery was spectacular. I wish the culture along the Nile was covered more, maybe as additional chapters since this was made for IMAX theaters and the main feature was limited on time.",1232841600,2,328,5.2075471698113205
3490844,3,B001BEK89C,"Like many films in this genre, this one is often better viewed with the sound off. The blu ray transfer is good in most places and some of the cinematography is exactly what you want on a big LCD via blu ray. The narration is pedestrian at best, adding little and sometimes detracting from the enjoyment. It's a bit overwrought and melodramatic. If you can pick it up inexpensively, it does have some impressive eye candy.",1231113600,25,422,4.565789473684211
3490845,5,B001BEK89C,"The film wasn't long enough, I could watch hours of this material.  It truly leaves you wanting more.  It was as close to being there as I can imagine.  Better than a lot of movies where a lot more money was spent & to top it all off ... its real!",1132012800,2,247,3.803921568627451
3490846,5,B001BEK89C,The camera work in this movie was exceptional - it was like we were birds flying over the Nile (of course that was partly due to the domed IMAX). It was so interesting to see the natives and their interpretation of Christianity. They carved a church out of solid rock! If you're interested in Africa or figure you will never get there in person this is a great movie to see.,1130544000,,374,4.28169014084507
3490847,5,B001BEK89C,"Caught this at an Imax Dome theater and LOVEd it!

You really feel as though you are a part of the expidition from the source of the Nile in Sudan all the way to the end in Cairo where it empties into the Mediterranean Sea.

Dangerous, awe-inspiring, and educational. This film achieves in 45 min. what Hollywood only dreams of.",1122076800,6,328,4.45
8282967,3,B001BEK89C,"From the write up, I expected more scenary shots. Had lots of facts, many I don't remember learning before. I thought I paid a little too much for this.",1366588800,,152,4.275862068965517
8282968,4,B001BEK89C,"Some of the best footage I have seen of Ethiopia, my home for 2 years, and the upper Nile.  It was thrilling to see the falls again.  Almost replicates the sensation of hiking toward their sound in what seemed the middle of nowhere and then the amazing visual reality of the falls themselves.  Good shots of Ethiopians in the countryside & even the staged shot of Coptic priests with colorful umbrellas is a taste of life in that country.  The narration pushes too hard attempting to make drama and suspense with the result it seems contrived.  One wonders why that is necessary with such awesome cinematography.",1365120000,,612,4.735849056603773
8282969,2,B001BEK89C,"Some of the Nile, but much more of the travelers (whose situations seemed ""dramatized"" several times), and very little ""mystery.""

When you title a film ""Mystery of the Nile,"" the buyer should expect to receive a little more history, in-depth information, and...mystery. This film is mostly just a travelogue of a group going down the Nile.

And the soundtrack--awfully done!  The music itself was interesting and appropriate, but it was mixed at such a high volume that you literally *cannot* hear what the narrators are saying much of the time.  It's like trying to have a conversation with someone in a car while the radio is turned up all the way.

Nice photography, but a very frustrating experience overall.",1358208000,,713,4.957983193277311
8282970,3,B001BEK89C,"The images were amazing, but the narrative was kind of insipid.  Watching with the sound off would have been better.",1297641600,2,116,4.8
8282971,2,B001BEK89C,"Having recently returned from a week in Egypt absorbing the history around the Nile and spending 3 days on the very well traveled Egyptian section of the Nile, my husband and I were interested in more insight and knowledge.  This looked just right.  Soon, I realized I'd seen this years ago.  The photography was beautiful, though with such an exciting and groundbreaking adventure, I found the accompanying narration and facts sadly lacking in detail.  Just as an interesting section would begin, like in Sudan, the narration and film skimmed on and provided nothing of value.  Had I realized how cut up the film was, I would not have bought it.  It's only 47 minutes long and much of it is spent covering the characters instead of the Nile.  I wouldn't buy again or recommend it to others unless they wanted to see the scenery.  A great disappointment.",1293667200,7,854,4.761904761904762
8282972,1,B001BEK89C,"Mystery of the Nile is an enjoyable movie. But many (re)viewers do not seem to realize that the whole ""expedition"" never took place. The ""expedition"" is pure fiction and mostly filmed in studios. The Lake Nasser storm scene is a very clear example. All team members are actors or at least playing a role. Saskia Lange is no Spanish journalist but a German soap-actress. I think they should not have pretended that this was real, they even made a book about the so called ""expedition"". Mystery of the Nile is a fake documentary, but a very good one.",1279238400,7,548,4.6020408163265305
8282973,5,B001BEK89C,"I purchased Mysteries of the Nile because I had heard that the photography was terrific.  What I did not expect was to be so engaged by the story.  I was entirely absorbed in the narrative while admiring the photography, and I really liked the soundtrack as well.  I am buying a lot of these IMAX documentaries, and this one is at the top of the list so far.",1274400000,,358,4.235294117647059
8282974,5,B001BEK89C,"This falls in line with all of these series, the filming and narration are first class on all of them, the picture and sound quality are absolutely fantastic, and the narration and filming make it very interesting and educational all the way through to the end. I have been very happy with all of these series I have gotten so far, and looking forward to getting all of them that are released.",1265155200,,393,4.472222222222222
8282975,2,B001BEK89C,"Oh man this was so boring. We expected more then what it was. It was a 100 day journey in 70mins. This was a disappointment. There really wasn't anything you would watch to get info on Egypt. There weren't any mysteries. A lot of people know that the Nile is dangerous, if not, well i just told you, there goes the whole story, your welcome. I think its funny how they said so many people died doing the rafting of it, yet they had  beginers with then. They tried to over play everything an dit was boring. Good scenes some time, but if I wanted that i would have bought SCENIC ROUTE AFRICA.",1262044800,,591,4.230088495575221
8282976,3,B001BEK89C,"This video is not a beautiful travel log of the Nile, it is a documentary about a journey on ONLY A PORTION of the Nile, and a lot of it was about the travelers difficulty getting the movie made and what they had to go through.",1261872000,2,227,3.9565217391304346
