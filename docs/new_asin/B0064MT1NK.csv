4950640,5,B0064MT1NK,"My daughter learned all her letters and sounds at 19 months watching Letter Factory once a day for 3 weeks so I was interested in getting her a number video. I rented Numbers Ahoy to see what I thought since it had mixed reviews. I wasn't impressed as it's mostly about plot and little about counting or numbers but Numberland is much more focused on numbers and counting. We've had it less than a week and she's already starting to count things and she's only 20 months old! It's basic only focusing on numbers (1-10), counting, and a little skip counting but simple and focused is what works at a young age. Might not be as helpful for a 3 or 4 year old who can already count. As a bonus there's a vowel song from one of the other Leapfrog videos at the end as an advertisement and my daughter loves the song!",1328745600,94,811,4.2727272727272725
4950641,5,B0064MT1NK,"This is a numbers video for ages 2-5 years with the Leapfrog dogs--Scout and Violet! My 2 year old daughter and 4 year old son absolutely love this video. They have watched it a bunch of times now, totally glued. They sing along with it now too. It does a great review of counting to 10, counting by 2's, and counting different objects.",1328313600,14,336,4.349206349206349

I know it will benefit him later because it benefit my son when he was just 2 months old. It's very educational.

4950665,3,B0064MT1NK,"We really enjoyed Letter Factory and thought Numberland would be similar in presentation. It is a bit jumbled in the storyline and the visual presentation of the numbers is sometimes cluttered. I will explain a bit further. The story starts with a garden and needing to repair it. Then it jumps immediately to the storyline of needing to help a monkey re-pack a bus. Then it jumps to preparing a birthday party for the monkey. Then it jumps back to the garden. Through the video, the average length of time each number remains on the screen is too short. There is often a lot moving in the graphic around the number, which is distracting for children. It's just too much going on for them to focus on numbers. I don't recommend it for a lack of focus and lack of simplicity. It could have been so much clearer and more effective. The story and characters are not the goal. Learning numbers is.",1486771200,,893,4.518518518518518

4950726,2,B0064MT1NK,"The casting is AWFUL. All the voice actors sound too much alike. It would be a lot easier to watch if there were more variance in tone and delivery styles. It's just a bunch of animals that talk the same. Almost like a parody of a kid's movie rather than a real one, if that makes sense. And that hamster's voice is particularly ear shattering so watch out for that.

But it gets 2 stars, because, well... my 3 year old and 16 month old are watching it. They're not overly thrilled about it, but hey, maybe the 16 year old is learning something.",1459209600,,545,4.240384615384615

4950742,3,B0064MT1NK,"This is a beautiful video! Very well made.
It emphasizes the counting from 1 to 10, and to a lesser extent counting by two from 1 to 10. My 3 stars are because it only counts up to 10. I think it is too simple for a 5 year old and even for my 2 year old that already counts to 20.",1454112000,9,280,3.532258064516129

4950748,4,B0064MT1NK,Leapfrog has done it again! Great learning tool for my 3 year old daughter! The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was due to the fact that the counting by 2's part at the end of the movie was a little bit to much information at once.,1448668800,,238,3.877551020408163

I saw quite a few positive review for Numberland on here, so I bit the bullet and ordered it for my 2 year old.  I can say I love this video.  The songs are catchy, my son loves to watch it. I find the songs to be catchy too.  sometimes kids shows can have annoying songs, but these aren't bad at all.  I happen to be very restrictive compared to most parents when it comes to TV time.

Perhaps because I am an educator I liked the bonus feature that explains the mathematical concepts presented from an educational perspective.  Number theory and all that jazz!

If you are comparing this to Numbers Ahoy, I would go with this one, Numberland.  I watched Numbers Ahoy and there isn't as much educational value to it.",1440460800,15,849,4.419354838709677

4950772,4,B0064MT1NK,I bought this dvd for help with number recognition for my four year old.

4950993,4,B0064MT1NK,"I recently purchased this for my 21 month old son. We are just starting to watch educational DVD's as I generally do not let him watch tv and cartoons. He has 2 Scout puppies so I knew this would keep his interest as well as help with learning. I have NO PROBLEM putting this DVD in my MacBook laptop computer. It works just fine! My son is a ""late talker"" so we read to him as well as provide other means of interesting education. He has not sat and watched the entire DVD, however I never expected him to as he is not a tv/cartoon kid! We do allotted times of watching this as my boy is active and not much of a sitting kind of kid. The run time on this DVD is 36 mins.  I think once he gets a little bit older-past 2 years this would be more appropriate as it is recommended for ages 2-5 and attention span gets better as they are older. But it can't hurt for him to watch as it does teach counting in more of a cartoon sketch kind of way. Singing while counting to ten in repetitive skits broken up by a little cartoon story in between. Also if you live near a Costco, they sell about 4 different Leap Frog Scout and Friends for six dollars and ninety nine cents!

Numberland was one of four that were available.  Well, like others have said, my son wanted me to play this (and The Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park) over and over. Within a couple weeks, my son knew numbers 1-10 (and all his letters from The Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park), and was calling them out where ever we were.

So I'll start by saying that my son likes it, it captures his attention, the numbers are well described and illustrated since each number is seen visually associated with his humber of objects.  However, the story line starts off with Scout &co passing by a monkey walking down the road with a sob story about his ride breaking down.  Not to be a super jaded adult, but for the first 15min of me watching this grifter sitting in their car, I kept thinking- he's totally going to scam them, who is this suspicious monkey by himself on the road? yeah, very likely his bus broke down, what, was I born yesterday?  But no, it ends up being legit- he's the driver of the bus that carries the numbers around, and in fact it's his birthday that we end up celebrating later.  But I just find it weird having a story line where we talk to strangers and give them a ride in our car...

This is a great video that gives the kids practice in counting in order and recognizing their numbers.  Cute video with little catchy songs, but I wish that they had a little song that went along with the counting in order though because the kids do so well with that.  In fact, they keep singing the counting by twos ditty that is at the end of the video because it is catchy.  I don't really care for that add-in.

My 2 year old autistic daughter however really benefited from it!  I do think that throwing the counting by 2's in there is mildly confusing at this stage. My daughter went through a few weeks of counting things by 2's but not actually grouping them in 2's. She should have been rote counting but was getting confused.  Great video overall and will continue to show it to my children.,1354579200,,543,4.510204081632653

4951052,5,B0064MT1NK,"Leap Frog is an excellent toy company. All of their products are well made and educational. Our two year old son loves Scout. He has a Scout ""leap""top, a Scout stuffed animal, a Scout Tag Jr. reader, and all of the Scout apps available on iTunes. When I saw this video was available, I figured he might like it.

He doesn't just like it, he LOVES it! It is an excellent video. We do not allow our son to watch TV shows or movies that aren't educational. However, many of the education videos and shows out there can be boring. This video satisfies both mom and dad and the kiddo! The songs are cute and catchy (we all find ourselves singing them!), and our son can actually count items (so, for example, if he sees 3 blocks, he can count them, saying ""One block, two blocks, three blocks!"" How many two year olds can count?!) He can also count by twos. He learned those concepts from this video.

To the parents who complain about the songs being cheesy, well, what do you expect? Its a kid's video. The songs are cheesy, yes, but cheese works. Yes, they get stuck in your head...but they get stuck in your child's head too, and isn't that the point?",1339632000,3,1150,4.344186046511628

4951057,5,B0064MT1NK,"I'm the type of dad that buys his son toys & learning items that are just above the recommended age. It has paid off in spades. My son grows into learning the toys or videos. His ability to master them is above average. That is not said to boast. That is said to promoted Leapfrog's DVD's.

My son just turned two. He is growing up in a Bi-Lingual family which can cause a delay in actual speaking of words (not speech recognition). So I purchased this DVD and others to replace the Pixar movies he spent time watching. I have to say they are a classroom @ home. He sits, transfixed and is attempting his best to speak what he hears & sees in Leapfrog's DVD's. When he knows a Leapfrog DVD is coming on, he rushes to 'his seat' to watch (bottle in hand). When it ends, he hands me the remote to re-start the DVD.

I would highly recommend these products.",1333929600,,854,4.233128834355829

He loves the characters Scout, Violet and Max. The songs are very contagious too. It's quite a family affair when Number land is on.",1330992000,,298,4.339285714285714
4951061,5,B0064MT1NK,My two kids enjoy watching this over and over again.  They have learned a lot from watching the Leap Frog DVDs.  They are very focused while watching.  I would give it a two thumbs up.,1330560000,,184,4.2
4951062,5,B0064MT1NK,"This is a great DVD to teach your child numbers.  It is repetitive in that they go over th numbers a lot of times and it sticks with you.  The characters are all cute, but the only thing I don't get is Max, the monkey.  Why did they think it was necessary to have this monkey (who hardly looks like a monkey in my opinion) with an English accent I am not sure.  Are they trying to tech 2-year olds that people have different accents and come from different countries, if so, I think it is a little too early and maybe somewhat confusing to the child.  Nevertheless. this is a minor remark that I have but I love the DVD format and songs and my daughter likes it too.",1329868800,,666,4.092307692307692
4951063,4,B0064MT1NK,"My boys love Leapfrog products and the few letter DVDs we have seen from Leapfrog, so I figured this DVD would be a hit as well.  ""Numberland"" is a DVD that features the fun characters from Leapfrog products, but also numbers 1-10.  It is a perfect first counting DVD for kids to learn from and it fits nicely with the other Leapfrog products.  Throughout the DVD the numbers 1-10 are repeated and re-arranged over and over, but not in a boring way.  The DVD makes kids think too because it puts the numbers in different orders, has them answer which number is missing and so forth.  The animation is bright, colorful and kid-friendly.  While this DVD is only 35 minutes, my boys don't mind watching it over and over again!  The DVD states its for 2-6 year olds, and my boys are 3 and 5 and love it.",1329868800,24,799,4.358108108108108
