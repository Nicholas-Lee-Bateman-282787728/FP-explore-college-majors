8149846,3,B000JBXP2U,"The art is beautiful, the animation is basically nonexistent. If you're looking for a good story, don't get this. Interested in awkward conversation and cliche characters? Then this is the anime for you! Laughed when i should have been crying, covered my eyes when I should have been drooling over the boy love. It kind of sucked, but...I would probably buy it again... Crotch shots!",1251244800,3,383,4.907692307692308
8149847,5,B000JBXP2U,"This is a fun and sweet and mysterious story unfolding in four dvds, however anime works only seem to release subtitled dvds only now days. I loved this dvd series despite that the only english avilable is in subtitles. Anime Works I wish you would release dubbed dvds again. Undubbed cuts costs but doesn't make english speaking customers very happy. In spite of the subtitles this is a dvd worth watching. Beautiful and fun and the interactions between all the characters is a laugh riot. I loved it.",1210032000,,502,4.715909090909091
8149848,1,B000JBXP2U,I love the show but when my DVD arrived the packaging was opened and the DVD itself was horribly damaged with a large crack and warping of the protective covering on the DVD surface. Utterly unwatchable in such a horrid condition. I'll need to go through the order process all over again after sending the defective DVD back.,1207353600,,325,4.620689655172414
8149849,5,B000JBXP2U,"If you like your yaoi nice a fluffy, Gakuen Heaven (Vol. 1) is perfect for you.  If you like chibi hamsters, so much the better, as the preview at the end of each episode has it's own mini-episode of 'Hamu Hamu Heaven.'

It's the normal schoolboy who gets picked to attend the most exclusive acadamy in Japan story and is quite fun.

Four episodes, plus extras including two extra episodes of 'Hamu Hamu Heaven' and character sketches.

This four episode DVD is quite fun and enjoyable!",1200096000,5,486,4.616279069767442
8149850,5,B000JBXP2U,"This is one great anime. Keita, repeated called an average guy, is sent an invitation to Bell Liberty Academy. This school is known for only asking the best of the best to come to this top notch school. Its starts with Keita coming to the school and an incident with the bridge to the academy. Most of the mystery is at the beginning where we learn that The Chairman, always in the shadows at the begining, has specially requested Keita be invited. This causes some contention with the Vice Chairman and the rest of the board. There is some innuendo and some of it seems to deal with homosexuality but as of the third disk there is nothing explicit, not even a kiss. I would recommend watching this anime, though its not rated, its best for older teens and adults. Engish Subtitled.",1186444800,11,782,4.514084507042254
