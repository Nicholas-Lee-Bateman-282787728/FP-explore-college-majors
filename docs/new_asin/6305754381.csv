7893822,3,6305754381,Did not receive this dvd it was something different in the case,1483142400,,63,4.333333333333333
7893823,1,6305754381,"No spoilers here - I completely lost interest 2/3 of the way through this movie and don't know or care how it ended.

One-dimensional characters would have been an improvement; these were 50's-tech robots responding to punch-card commands.  No personality, no motivation, no reason to care.

Technical development was similarly non-existent.even tornadoes don't hit 400 mph wind speeds, so it would require at least a little exposition to suspend disbelief.

""Twister"" may have its plot weaknesses and technical inaccuracies, but at least it's an enjoyable guilty pleasure.  ""Storm Tracker"" isn't worth the trouble it takes to press ""Play"", let alone buy the disc.

Skip it for something else - anything else.",1196035200,2,709,5.342342342342342
7893824,3,6305754381,"OK, sure the movie is VERY CHEESY, but it is fun in my eyes and like I said I only payed a dollar for it so maybe I'm giving this to much lea-way to this silly action/disaster movie.

  After making a weather machine that causes hurricane Andrew, (Martin Sheen in full blown bad guy mode) wants to try again so he gets Luke Perry(who looks to be picking up a paycheck here) to help him and guess what, now L.A. is about to be wiped out by this thing.

  Martin Sheen made this movie because his daughter Renee Estevez is in it and as stated Luke picked up a paycheck, so that tells you why they made this one. It's not really that lousy, and if mindless entertainment is what you want, for a dollar you could do worse, but don't pay anymore than that for it.",1175212800,,758,4.122448979591836

The acting was bad, the premise of the story was
unbeliveable. I wish I had not have bought it.",999475200,4,146,3.8666666666666667
7893826,2,6305754381,"Not bad. it works Not much in the way of frills, but it's cheap! and amusing... The movie is a little less than believeable, but for pure cheese entertainment, you can't beat it....",995587200,4,181,4.515151515151516
