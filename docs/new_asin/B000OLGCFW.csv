2797506,5,B000OLGCFW,"My kids are crazy for Little Einsteins.... and they LOVE this new video. I don't think its too scary at all, not like a previous reviewer said.  There are a few scary elements, like all the Einstein videos... but there are also so many good and educational elements that it all balances out.",1188864000,2,291,4.490566037735849
2797507,1,B000OLGCFW,"My kids love the Little Einsteins, but this one was very disappointing. They barely made it through without crying and there have been nightmares ever since. So buy at your own risk, this one is very scary for young kids.",1188604800,8,221,4.55
2797508,5,B000OLGCFW,"This is one of the best Little Einsteins DVDs yet for exposing kids to classical music. Twice as long as a regular television program, its 51-minute main feature, ""Rocket's Firebird Rescue,"" will really make children familiar with Igor Stravinsky's ""The Firebird.""

Just about the perfect length for many youngsters' attention spans, the program tells the tale of the Firebird, a mythical crane that spreads music throughout Russia until a mean, magical ogre traps it. It also introduces kids to the painting ""Improvisation"" by Wassily Kandinsky, the amazing eggs of Carl Faberge, Russian nesting dolls, even St. Basil's Cathedral and the Baikal freshwater seal.

It's even better if you view it with a home theater set-up, as the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack includes the kids' ""Rocket"" flying machine zooming around you as it travels.

The DVD also contains a regular episode of the Little Einsteins television series, 2007's ""Rocket Soup,"" in which the kids fill up their transporter with its favorite food, a mix of cheese, peas, and jumping beans. It features Antonin Dvorak's catchy ""Humoresque No. 7"" (you'll know it when you hear it) and the painting ""Moonrise"" by Paul Klee.

There is just one bonus feature, ""Magic Mission,"" which plays the main feature with ""hidden"" pop-up cards. When selected with a remote, each leads to an animated fun fact.",1188086400,18,1356,5.15

2797549,5,B000OLGCFW,"When I ordered this, I didn't even realize there was an extra episode on the disc. My two-year-old loves Little Einsteins, and the Firebird Rescue and Rocket Soup episodes together just send him over the moon. I love that it has an auto-play feature so I don't have to stand there pushing menu buttons for him, or worry that he's going to try to mess with the remote himself. Einsteins as a show is fantastic for kids, of course-- I love that my son is getting such exposure to classical music through this series, and the day he picked up a stick and said, ""Look mom, I'm a conductor just like Leo!"" I about melted. He loves doing the dances like June, too, and ""playing instruments"" like Quincy. Since he's been watching the series, he's also become much more confident singing, and I can't help thinking that the Annie character has had an influence on that. Overall, a great pick for young kids!",1409356800,,899,4.521472392638037

2797556,5,B000OLGCFW,"All of the Little Einstiens are great but his one is especially full of lessons about science, art , and music!  We are raising a sharp little girl who can recognize many instrument sounds and name places in the world where these little characters take their rocket ship.
My husband and I are both art teachers so we are all about exposure to the arts.  She is only four now, but we know this knowledge will stick with her for a lifetime!  I took this one to the music teacher in our school and she uses it when she has a substitute teacher.",1402963200,,541,4.233009708737864
2797557,5,B000OLGCFW,"My 2 1/2 year old grandson is addicted to Little Einsteins, and of all of them, this was a particular favorite.  He can watch this over and over, ad nauseam... but they are intelligent videos in their own little 'appeal-to-toddler' way, and Disney did a good thing here.  Granted they are very formulaic, but the target audience is munchkin sized.  Definitely a good purchase.",1401321600,,376,4.84375

I was really disappointed because I thought I could trust Einsteins to be age appropriate.

2797600,4,B000OLGCFW,"My 2-year-old son is a huge fan of Little Einsteins, or, as he calls them, the ""Steins!""  He loves this movie and we let him watch it on rare occassions where we need to keep him occupied for a full hour.  My son loves the movie and dances, sings and does everything else along with the movie, so clearly it engages him.  I am sure he would give it five stars.

From the parent perspective, though, it seems like they made an hour long episode by repeating things seven times instead of three times.  And each Little Einstein gets to show off his or her unique talent, instead of focusing on one person like they do on a TV episode.  As a result, it feels like an overlong TV episode.  Of course, the TV episodes are great, so this is not really a criticism other than to say that if you watch it with your child, you will likely get a little bored and start wishing they would move the story along.  Like I said, the repitition does not bother my son, the intended audience, one bit.

Overall, if your child is a fan of the Little Einsteins, I am sure he or she will love this movie.  But it is probably not one you will want to sit down and watch with your child over and over.",1190764800,2,1179,4.131578947368421
2797601,4,B000OLGCFW,I bought this for my young grandson. He is a regular watcher of the Little Einsteins and loves Rocket and the music - especially the music.  What a way to introduce classical music to young children. Incredibly simple and enjoyable for children of all ages.,1190764800,,257,4.711111111111111
2797602,5,B000OLGCFW,"""Rocket's Firebird Rescue"" is a new full length adventure starring Disney's Little Einsteins.  The film runs 51 minutes, with an additional bonus episode titled, ""Rocket Soup"".  I'll admit that initially I was a bit put off by the ""Little Einsteins"" moniker.  I don't like the implication that parents  have to plunk their little darlings in front of a box in order to stimulate their minds.  There are many products sold to insecure parents who want to give their child every advantage, all seem to have titles that include the names of famous thinkers, composers, or artists, or else words such as ""brainy"", ""smarter"", or ""better"".  Though I'm not enamored of the show's name, ""Little Einsteins"" is quite fun and engaging.

There are four kids on the Little Einsteins team, each with a special talent.  The kids are between four and six years old.  Leo is the leader of the group and his special skill is conducting. Quincy plays a variety of musical instruments. June is a dancer, and Annie, the youngest member of the team, is a singer.  The animation is really cute, and the characters come across as sweet but not saccharine.

In this film, the children introduce a Kandinsky painting, a Faberg&eacute; egg,  Russian Nesting Dolls, and Igor Stravinsky's,  ""The Firebird"" at the beginning of the story. The kids start reading the story of the Firebird to their friend Rocket, who is a sentient flying ship.  They fly to Russia in order to rescue the captive Firebird.  An evil ogre has captured her, and she can only sing very softly while she is captive.  All the music of the area is subdued and the flowers are wilting.  The kids must use their abilities to overcome various obstacles and vanquish the evil ogre.

An interesting component of the dvd is the interactive ""Magic Mission"" option.  By using the dvd remote, viewers can click on nine feathers that appear throughout the film.  Each feather discloses a video ""card"" which has an image and a short bit of information.  After all cards have been collected, they reveal a hidden picture.

Viewers are encouraged to play along with the team.  They are asked to conduct with Leo, for instance, and he starts off ""adagio"" and progresses through ""moderato"" and :allegro"" to ""presto!""  Characters often  stop and speak directly to the viewer and ask, Will you help us?"" My toddler was always quick to answer, ""yes!""

""Rocket's Firebird Rescue"" is a nice representation of Russian folklore, reminiscent of Peter and the Wolf.  The music is lovely and the ""bad guys"" are not too threatening for very young children. I recommend it for ages 1-6, though I will add that my older children seemed enchanted by it as well!",1190505600,9,2675,4.821978021978022

2797604,5,B000OLGCFW,"My three year old grandson and I are big fans of the Little Einsteins adventures.  I had three DVDs and was getting a little weary of listening to the same stories (he was not!).  I knew the date this DVD was being released and ordered it that day.  It's a great story and my grandson loves it.  I like the adventure in the Little Einstein stories; the various places in the world that are visited; the 'missions' the children encounter and the way they solve the problems; and I love classical music.  My grandson uses many of the things he's learned from the videos and incorporates these into his imaginary playtime...the Nile Crocodile is chasing our car or Rocket will help us find something, etc.  The other day I caught him humming a piece of classical music from the stories.  I believe it's important to open the world to children in an age appropiate atmosphere and Little Einsteins does this well.",1190419200,,908,4.60248447204969

They viewed it non stop for the first few days and watch all four dvd's regularly. I haven't seen it yet but we will be visiting in a month and it will be one of the staples they take on the trip. I'll see it then I bet. It does get three thumbs up, way up from the three that it matters most to. Grandpa and Grandma are pleased to recommend any of the series.",1189728000,,497,4.03030303030303
