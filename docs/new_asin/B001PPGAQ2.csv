8334263,5,B001PPGAQ2,"Let me say right off that these two Tex Ritter films offer exceptional prints, clear and sharp with excellent audio as well.
And this is a fantastic buy for B-Western fans especially since ROLLIN' WESTWARD (1939) is very hard to find in any format and once thought to be a lost film. Charlie King starts this one off seeming like a good guy but we've all seen too many oaters not to know that he'll be getting bounced around by Tex before the end credits roll. Nice to see a young Hank Worden ('Ol Mose in Ford's THE SEARCHERS) as a not too bright crooked sheriff. Worden I understand was somewhat responsible for Tex and leading lady Dorothy Fay getting hitched in real life.
ROLLIN' HOME TO TEXAS (1940) has Tex and sidekick ""ARKANSAS SLIM"" Andrews busting a bank robbery gang involving escaped convicts from the penitentiary run by Tex's uncle. With Eddie Dean along as the sheriff there's plenty of good songs in this one. Tex and Slim sing one duet, ""...I'm Tex...I'm Slim...I'm me...I'm him!"". Western Swing star Cal Shrum and his Rhythm Rangers (they're pictured on the cover of the dvd) also get to perform several songs, so if you're a fan of Cowboy/Hillbilly/Western Swing music then this is one movie that you really need to see!!!
And as I mentioned, the ALPHA dvd is just great, looks great, sounds great...Get this one.",1260576000,,1333,4.6525423728813555
