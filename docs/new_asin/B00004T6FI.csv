I find the quality of Gaiam/Yoga Journal productions to be top notch, so I was looking forward to receiving this video.  We LOVE it!  Our only 'complaint' is we enjoyed it so much, we wish the practice was longer!  Rodney Yee and his wife lead us thru a gentle and beautiful 'dance' of yoga.  The gorgeous setting on a beach helps set a serene frame of mind. The married couple coach us to assist each other thru the poses, which we found very helpful.  I especially like the sequences where we are directed to take turns assisting each other thru one side of a pose, then together with our right feet touching each other, we both go into the pose for the other side together.  Lovely bonding time!  Namaste. :)",1042156800,3,790,4.4
7922320,3,B00004T6FI,"The video was OK, but not as good as we hoped it would be. My husband and I are athletic, however, we felt rushed and un-coordinated while trying to follow this video.
First, there is not much time between different poses, so we constantly had to pause the video and figure out how to position our arms and legs correctly so we can feel that we are actually doing yoga (and not aerobics). It has improved slightly when we followed the video a few times, but it is still rather fast paced. And second, this video requires lots of floor space, so don't buy it unless you have at least 20 square feet of practice space.
I feel that my husband and I bond better while doing yoga moves independently than following this couple-oriented video.",1018569600,6,737,4.466666666666667
