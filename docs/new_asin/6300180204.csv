216497,5,6300180204,"This is a gem that was obviously made on a low budget, nothing spent on anything, no well-known actors, at the time, yet the story is of such a special nature with a magic of inexplicable charm that I can say it is one of my favorite little movies of all time.  You don't know me.  My reviews hold no unusual weight.  My opinions garner no undue attention, but if you trust anything I ever say then get this one and to any age group, personality type, or of any type of relationship to you, show it to them.  They will smile the rest of the day at the thought of the movie and that you were so perceptive in offering it to them.  Few people can agree on the type of movie they like.  This one is universally accepted as a little known pearl of great value.",1151280000,11,756,4.074324324324325
216498,2,6300180204,"I  was overjoyed when I saw a DVD copy of this movie in Best Buy last week. I lost my copy a few years ago so now I can buy it again.

This is a  very romantic movie with great chemistry between Tom and Christina. I wish I could have seen her in other movies, because she's an excellent actor.",1148256000,6,293,3.85
216499,5,6300180204,"THIS film tells its story simply and follows its plot to its resolution without the use of gimmicks, trick photography, or computer enhancement.  It is a film about human naivete, prejudice wrapped in ""warm"" tradition, and human love that takes on the odds.  IF one had the time, it would be interesting to do a socio-psychological study of why this film fell through the proverbial crack when it was released in the States in November 1986.  Given the multiple ethnicities of the general population of the States, it would seem that there would have been a built-in reciptivity to the plot of this film.  Perhaps the film demands too much of an average audience.  EVEN though love ""triumphs"" at the end of the film, it is not an easy ""triumph.""  It is a triumph that makes you come to grips with the uncertainties of life.  AS the film ends, I wonder: How many ""baby boomers"" were born of parents who had to undergo such odds as Sarah poses at the end?: ""It doesn't matter when. If it takes a hundred years, I'll be here."" Love endures.",1144281600,6,1037,4.543010752688172
216500,5,6300180204,"I couldn't agree more with the other reviews about this wonderful movie.

Many comments discuss Tom Hank's great acting in this film.  But, there was another great acting role here; and that was Cristina Marsillach's performance as Tom's lover in the movie.  Nothing short of outstanding.

Can't wait for the dvd to be released, too.",1143763200,7,333,5.0
216501,4,6300180204,"This is a WWII movie which takes place in Africa, with Tom Hanks playing an American who joined the RAF to be a figher pilot.  He meets and falls in love with an eighteen year old girl (Christina Marsillach) named Sarah, who is apparently the youngest child in a large Jewish family.

This is a very romantic movie, and I highly recommend it.  If focuses on the relationships, and there are not a lot of special effects or shots of the beautiful country side.  A VHS tape cannot do it total justice, but it is not to be missed, none-the-less.  Let's hope for a DVD version in the future!",1127606400,5,587,4.348623853211009

216503,5,6300180204,"I couldn't agree more with the critiques that precede this.  This is pretty much my favorite Tom Hanks movie, I caught it on late night HBO and I fell in love with this sweet understated tale of two people in love under some very difficult conditions. Tom Hanks'is an American volunteer with the RAF who is wounded and sent to a hospital in Israel, while he heals he meets a young Spanish Jew that he falls in love with, however her family is againist the union, with so much difference i.e war, foreign military, religious differences and culture, the chances seem very slim for them.  The writing, directing is great, the music, romantic songs from world war two,is terrific, and the great underlying humor is some of Tom Hanks best work.  I don't understand why this isn't on DVD and considered one of Hanks best movies.  I loved this, and recommend it to anyone who is a Tom Hanks fan.",1091059200,17,889,4.5375
216504,4,6300180204,"This is an underated film that presents itself in understated way. It is a quiet movie that constantly moves you although you don't realize it. I takes you through the lives of the two main characters as they become helpless to the love they share.
It is an accurate portrayal of a families involvement, and a young womans ties to tradition and that of her own heart.",1058745600,3,367,4.492537313432836
216505,5,6300180204,"This is a quietly great movie. It did not hit the top charts after its premiere and soon went into oblivion. Only after Hank's success in the 90s, this film ""resucitated"" on TV. Every... needs concentration from viewers, and a basic understanding of sephardic history to appreciate its value. Mr. Hanks once said this is his most fondly remembered movie, believe or not. Hanks plays the role of an american fighter pilot enlisted with the RAF. After his plane was shot down in North Africa, he convalesces in Jerusalem. He meets a young sephardic jew (Cristina Marsillach) with whom he falls in love. Her family overall resists this romance. She is also caught with the dilemma: my family traditions or my love for somebody who is  ""different""?, and hesitates, but not for long. The film accurately reflects a part of the life of sephardic jews. The director is israeli (and sephardic I presume). It is also a true experience to hear Ladino, or Judeo-Spanish. As a Spanish speaker, I see it as a form of medieval Spanish preserved across time. This is unique. The only weakness I found was the audio. I highly recommend this movie.",1025222400,36,1131,4.770408163265306
216506,5,6300180204,"This movie is amazing.  I saw it once many years ago and I never really got over it.  It's an incredibly dramatic, romantic, touching, and realistic story of young love in the 1940s.  Hanks plays a WWII American pilot stationed in Jerusalem who falls in love with a Sephardic girl played by Christina Marsillach.  Of course, Marsillach's family is dead-set against their daughter dating the American.  The film focuses in on their forbidden love affair, and Hanks and Marsillach have amazing on-screen chemistry.  The characters are remarkably real and raw, as is the storyline.  There is no sugar-coated perfect ending, but it's not depressing either.  This is one of those rare films that is able to capture at once both the dispair of human prejudices and the optimism of human determination.  I rewatched this movie recently, and I was overwhelmed by the same feelings I felt when I watched it for the very first time.  Although it's out of print and one of Tom Hanks' lesser known films, it's definitely worth the effort.  Try getting your hands on a copy--you won't regret it.  Highly, highly recommended.",1022544000,102,1111,4.913978494623656

216535,5,6300180204,"Tom Hanks in a mostly Ladino language (with sub-titles) film .  . . Imagine that! A 1940s film about an American who joined the British forces prior to American involvement in WWII and finds himself in then-Palestine long enough to meet and fall in love with a beautiful, young Sephardic woman whose family speak Ladino. If one can imagine, the story becomes even more complicated than that. An interesting early Hanks drama and a fascinating look at inter-everything.",1475712000,,468,5.0
216536,3,6300180204,"There's a reason this is not one of Tom Hanks' better-known movies.  Well, two reasons.  First, it was very early in his film career (1986), before he burst into super-stardom.  He had already played one attention-getting role in Ron Howard's ""Splash"" (1984) opposite Daryll Hannah.  But he had not yet achieved the break-away fame and celebrity status that came with a decade of celebrated roles like ""Big"" (1988), ""Turner & Hooch"" (1989), ""Philadelphia"" (1993), ""Forrest Gump"" (1994), ""Apollo 13"" (1995), and ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""You've Got Mail"" (both 1998).

The second reason this movie is not well-known is because it's a fairly routine and often rehashed storyline as old as Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" -- forbidden love that goes against family, culture, religion, or any combination thereof.  Having said that, it's still a well-directed and -acted movie in that genre.  Definitely worth a watch.  If nothing else, it's a fun reminder of how young Hanks looked when he first became noticed and appreciated by Hollywood and movie audiences.  Long before he became the more mature, much-loved Everyman in the tradition Jimmy Stewart that he is today.",1475625600,5,1168,5.2032085561497325

Particularly interesting because it reveals the marrano culture, a little known group of Sephardic Jews who spoke Ladino, a sort of Jewish-Spanish, thriving in wartime Jerusalem.

216575,4,6300180204,"It's hard not to grant five stars to most of the film work of Tom Hanks. And in this film, Spanish actress Christina Marsillach offers a good  performance as a very lovely and sensual but conflicted 18 year old female lead.  However, this movie feels a little too stereotypical and ethnic for my personal sensibilities.  And it leaves too many plot loose ends to quite deserve a top rating.

This is worth seeing as an early example of the dynamic range that Hanks is capable of.  But as a story, it doesn't quite measure up to his later work.",1461801600,2,543,4.444444444444445

This movie is a classic as it revives old memories while at the same time shows off Tom Hank's early career in this underrated film. His character in this movie is very noble and kind-hearted as he tries his best to be with his new found love which happens to be a Sephardic Jewish woman from Spain. The beautiful woman who is played by Spanish actress Cristina Marsillach goes through a difficult time as she struggles to be with the love of her life which is Tom Hanks, an American soldier fighting during World War II. Together they go through ups and downs in order to be be united in marriage. Her family rejects Tom Hanks character and she faces a variety of other challenges yet she puts it all in the line and risks being with Tom Hank's.  Through the adversity they must fight all odds in order to be together forever and ever.

216600,5,6300180204,THE VERY BEST WAR/ROMANCE FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN.  THIS IS AN EARLY TOM HANKS FILM.  HE IS JUST EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!,1456876800,,113,4.6
216601,4,6300180204,"This film provides quite a nice treat in viewing old parts of Jerusalem including many Arabs in traditional clothes while hawking their wares.  Don't forget the occasional camel going down the paved stone streets!

tom Hanks plays a WWII RAF pilot born and raised in Montana as a minister's son.  He knows his Bible and appreciates visiting Palestine in those years, when it was under British occupation.  Because he has been injured, he has a nice long recuperation and meets a young Sephardic Jewish woman.

She comes from a strict orthodox Jewish family who still speak Ladino.  This love is absolutely taboo for her as it will mean breaking hundreds of years of Jewish tradition to marry a An American Christian man.  She will be disowned and exiled permanently from the family if she does so.

Hence the tension in the film is all about the intolerance of her mother in particular but also her brothers and her Father.  There is a wonderful scene of righteous anger as the mother and all her siblings confront her and scream and yell in Ladino.  She had not yet slept with this alien pilot but they think so.

I suppose it is a sign of maturity that I could see her parents' point of view clearly.  He is a passing fling and would never convert.  Even if he tried he would not be accepted and would not understand their language.  Her children would only be half Jdwish.  How could she raise them as Jews in Montana with a minister's son?  Clearly this is a case of young lust.  It is as common as dirt.  The parents want their daughter to stay in their community and in Palestine.  If you forbid the love affair, it could pass as a memory.  But it is a heartache to the young ones in the meantime.

Tom Hanks is young and slim and handsome in a blue uniform.  But for a minister's son, he certainly has a rather diffident attitude towards religion.  This irritated me.  Why can't he take his own identity seriously and consider that his children will be Jewish?  Doesn't he care about his own parents or family?

I think the film is a slow and low budget one with a very poor box office result.  It came on late one night here in berkeley.  I myself had been four months in Israel in 1982 and enjoyed seeing the old streets and desert scenes again.

I don't think this was just about racial or religious mixing.  It was about very traditional Spanish culture with women seen as mothers or who@@s.  He was a liberated fellow from a more loose culture.  Many immigrant families here in the USA found that their daughters were not held as special just to be virgins for marriage.  It is still a battle going on in traditional households today across USA and Canada and Australia.  In Europe there are honor killings against daughters who have affairs and try to live as modern french or German women.

It would be a great sequel if she bore tom hanks son and he never got back.  The child would grow up somehow and then what?  Turn against his own mother and become Christian because he thought his mother a who@@?

Note that the young Ladino lady doesn't work or study.  How to live?  Eat?  She must be a dependent.  She lives in hope that the pilot will not get killed and come back to get her. It would be a rough fate to be exiled to Montana!",1455926400,,3249,4.418918918918919

I'm always surprised because it's a very mature movie, heartfelt and heart braking at times, wonderfully shot, maturely presented by a very talented crew of filmmakers. Simply put, this is good cinema. A story told about people trying to connect in a disconnecting world, over cultural barriers, across a war. Love is delicate and tough.

Also, this is a great example of Hanks' mature dramatic roles. But consider that this role pops up in his carreer when he was paying the bills with the Burbs and The Money Pit and the like. This is a rare serious, dramatic, romantic piece for the young Hanks and foreshadows his later dramatic success.

This movie was the first romance I ever like. Recently rewatched it after many years and was pleasantly reassured that it still holds up. May become one of those timeless classic.

216714,2,6300180204,"A thoroughly irritating, circular drudge of a romance flick. Tom Hanks leads as an injured soldier in the heat of WWII, recuperating in a cushy Jerusalem apartment, who finds/forces love in a barely-legal, deeply religious young woman. The two don't seem to have much in common apart from being particularly good-looking, and though we aren't shown any compelling reason for their love to blossom (there's very little chemistry on-screen), such flowering proceeds regardless. It doesn't take long for the plot to settle into an easy cycle of ""our love is great"" > ""my family will keep us apart"" > ""I push you away"" > ""our love is great,"" which then spins out, sans-flavor, for the duration. At this point in his career, Hanks still had a ways to go as a serious actor, and his co-star most definitely wasn't recruited for her theatrical chops. At least it's nice to look at, with gorgeous locations and a beautiful young lady sharing a majority of the screen time.",1405296000,2,964,4.813253012048193

The Israeli family objects and literally kidnaps the daughter to keep them apart. Strangely, the daughter decides to defy her family so she escapes, spends the night with Hank's character but then goes back to family. What's the point, when she has a kid and it looks American, again the stuff hitting the proverbial fan. I guess I couldn't understand the logic here.

I love the film because of this attempt at showing and explaining a special group of people in Israel, and also for the love story between Hanks and a Ladino young woman. As with most such attempts, characters spend some of their time just explaining things that are special about this community of people. I enjoy showing the movie to my Spanish classes, especially to my upper-level students (in phonetics, grammar, culture), so they can listen to this Spanish dialect, which may reflect in part what 15th century Spanish in Spain may have sounded like. For Spanish language enthusiasts, Tom Hanks afficionados, and those who just love a good love story (that even has the lady in question repelling down a balcony using bed sheets tied to one another, brought to her by her understanding brother, so she can run off and see Tom!), I highly recommend the movie.

It's set in World War 2, the Holy Land, and Hanks is an RAF fighter pilot recovering from being shot down.

So much for the backdrop.

The scenes are superb, the props excellent and the acting get 5* from almost all involved.

The viewer is wrapped into the world of the middle east in an entirely beleivable way.

The love story that becomes the focal point blossoms, it's accurate and portrays we've all felt after the first few meetings.

The plot then delves into the aspects of prejudice within and external to families, of clannish beliefs, of anti-semitism and shows the prejudice there works both ways. As the saying goes, ""as you give, so shall you recieve"". It highlights the attempts of four young people of their time in trying to change this world of bigorty and small mindedness. It highlights in this case that it is often the women who are most vitriolic, especially against their own. I found myself wishing that such people could really have their actions filmed then be forced to watch themselves.

The conclusion to the movie was unusual, it left me feeling like only ""Fellowship of the Ring"" had before - so what's next? There's no definitive conclusion for me [others may view it differently], and there was so much more that could have been added to enhance the storyline. This alone cost it 2 stars.

I'm not disappointed I bought it, and will watch it more than once, but suspect I'll continue to be left with the unfilled anticipation I felt when watching the credits the first time.",1326326400,2,1617,4.669014084507042

Not much story to this, very thin plot.  And the ending... terrible. I wanted some type of resolution.  You don't get it here.  Does he make it ok through the war?  Does she wait for him?

An Israeli movie called ""Fortuna"" (1966) was a stronger movie dealing with modern romance and old world customs.  There was a movie about Arab Israelis (sorry, but I forgot the name) which gave you a rare glimpse into the lives of an Arab family, with a wonderful part about a young man and woman's wedding.

If you have a heart and a shirt, sell your shirt and buy this DVD (finally, after many years of availability only on grainy VHS). This is a quintessential love story, modestly uncontrived and straightforward. Tom Hanks is fresh-faced and wonderful in a boyish, aw-shucks sorta way, not surprising since he plays a character from Montana. Cristina Marsallach is simply stunning, an understated Spanish beauty whose eyes are haunting and expressive. The chemistry between both develops slowly but inevitably in the face of the pressures of war and time and diverse culture and family backgrounds. Hanks and Marsallach's characters are literally worlds apart; even so, the common denominator of love is their connection in the midst of war. I only regret the absence of some deux ex machina on the part of the storyteller at the film's conclusion, and fervently hope that he keeps his promise to come back after the war, and that she keeps her promise and is waiting for him. Life in post-war Jerusalem would have been difficult as we already know, but they would have had the strength and comfort of one another to face an uncertain future. This is a chick-flick without doubt, and a feel-good movie certainly. But it is believable, the characters credible and alive, the conflict not overblown but palpable.

7804093,2,6300180204,"Really long and drawn out, for me.  I like the story, and I like the acting, but the love story going back and forth so much between the two main characters is just a little much.  Maybe if the movie were a little shorter, a few scenes taken out, would help. It's funny how you can actually see Tom Hanks grow as an actor in this film, but not the lead actress.  It just kind of stays flat with all of the redundant ""No, I can't"" that belabors the whole film.",1504310400,,459,4.021978021978022

7804095,5,6300180204,Typical Tom Hanks performance. Even the co-stars were excellent. Don't know how I missed this when it first came out but glad I ran across it.,1494374400,,142,4.5
