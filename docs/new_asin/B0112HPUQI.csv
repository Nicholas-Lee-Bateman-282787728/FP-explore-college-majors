7321371,1,B0112HPUQI,"HC III almost seems like Tom Sixx was wanting to make a different movie, and used the HC franchise to get the funding.  The whole movie was more like a homage to the last portion of ""Natural Born Killer"" from the prison setting.  The movie's lead actor Dieter Laser, who was so impressive in the first installment of HC was literally almost completely unintelligible in this movie. One could perhaps understand 15% of what he said.  The movie had a 1970's or early 80's B movie feel, both in the cinematography and overall quality of acting.  The special effects were nothing to brag about, and the bulk of the movie was more like a very bad black comedy, than anything really driving off the HC franchise.  Tom Sixx phoned this one in, and in some respects gave the finger to the fans of the HC franchise.  He should have stopped after HC the first movie.",1445385600,8,856,4.490322580645161
7321372,1,B0112HPUQI,"This is so incredibly bad! I can't believe Tom Six chose to make an appearance in the worst of the series. There's no way to express how wrong this is. I thought the first HC was outrageous, a sort of variation on David Cronenberg's excellent ""new flesh"" films of the seventies and eighties. Then number two was repulsive in all the right ways, actually approached ""Eraserhead"" arthouse meets midnight movie status. Even the black and white worked well although I would like to see HC2 in color; It looked seriously queasy enough  in B/W. The main problem with HC3 is Dieter Laser. He is so over the top he ruins the film. It was interesting having the two leads from the first two together in a whole different story but what was Six thinking with Laser's performance? Laser was perfect for the first film but here he comes across like a drunk and pissed off OLD Klaus Kinski mixed with a drunk and pissed off OLD Hunter Thompson! What's worse, he's becomes boring after a few minutes and he weighs the film down, you'll want him off the screen ASAP. One interesting aside, I went into this blind to the cast. When Governor Hughes makes an intro I kept thing this guy looks familiar. I was pretty surprised to see it was Eric Roberts. He certainly has changed... I'll always think of him in his best roles - Paul Schneider in Bob Fosse's ""Star 80"" and opposite Jon Voight in ""Runaway Train"". He was probably the best thing about this film. Hopefully Six will have a change of heart, admit it was a VERY bad joke and give the fans of the first two flicks a better ending to this saga. The concept is truly horrifying as a unique twist on traditional ""mad doctor"" genre mixed with modern shock horror. The Dutch let me down I guess it's off to France in the meantime... until American horror grows a set again and remembers how to use 'em. It seems everybody in the world is continuing the great American Grindhouse (original ""Texas Chainsaw"", original ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Original ""Last House on the Left"", ""Deranged"", etc.) except the folks who started it.",1441670400,11,2058,4.547169811320755
7321373,5,B0112HPUQI,"This is one franchise you either love or hate, personally I love these movies and the way they dare to be different, the original 2 movies were gross out in so many ways, mainly due to whole ass-to-mouth business of course and vulgar potty humour and just disgustingly pointless but at the same time so much fun, the third helping is just as vulgar and disgusting if not more, the movie isn't much in the way of violence or gore even though there are a few messed up moments of course, the movie is utterly racist and sexist and just down right 100% incorrect on every level from start to finish, the movie is very entertaining mainly due to the come back of actor Dieter Laser who played Doctor Heiter in the 2009 original, he gives it his all with one of the most over the top eccentric performances in movie history, this guy is someone you love to hate, the biggest movie A-hole award for sure, the foul language in this movie is constant, the dialogue is continuously offensive, his character degrades women and is incredible racist and just plane hates anyone! The 3rd movie is yet again like the sequel set in another time-line, this time the 2 main stars from the original 2 movies appear together playing the heads of the prison, getting their influence from the Tom Six movies to create an inmate 500man centipede, the movie is rather funny too and self parodies itself making fun of the original 2 movies referring to them as garbage, Tom six the director appears too as himself and the movie also stars real life XXX porn actress Bree Olson playing a secretary who is constantly being sexually harassed and abused, if your a fan of the original 2 then this is a must as it continues the sick humour and action rather well I think, if your not a fan then avoid as you will be greatly offended, Look out for the Human Caterpillar scene it may slip into a future sequel.",1438128000,5,1879,4.465116279069767
7321374,5,B0112HPUQI,"I bought this movie's PPV for my son Jonny(age7) who loves monster movie.
We have never watch Part1 and2 for this movie.
We were so exited those monsters are so real and scary! (`')WOW!
Jonny loves it! We love it! Grand ma loves it! God bless America!",1438128000,4,251,4.361702127659575
7321401,2,B0112HPUQI,"I thought it was a pretty average movie it's outlandishly offensive like a live action South Park on steroids. Dieter Laser gives one of the most insane performances I've ever seen in a movie but I felt like it was a 20 minute short film padded out to an hour and a half.

Not in the league of the first two THC films.",1463702400,,318,4.0476190476190474
7321402,5,B0112HPUQI,This movie is more hilarious then scary. Another crazy ride the dear doctor takes you on!!!! I hope that this is definitely the last one.,1458345600,,137,4.52
7321403,2,B0112HPUQI,"I gave the movie a two star rating only because the theatrical teaser reel for it was excellent.

I knew as soon as i heard Tom Six was making a third centipede movie that it would be a disaster.
I enjoyed the first two movies and felt that he already took the idea as far as it could  posibly go.
This was intended as a comedy but the joke was flat and over acted.

Before you consider buying it , i recommend reading all the one star customer reviews and taking everyone's word for how bad this movie is.",1456358400,,506,4.090909090909091
7321404,1,B0112HPUQI,"I watched this on Netflix so I didn't even spend money on it. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. For starters, you can barely understand a word that was even said. The warden yells and is incomprehensible throughout the entire film. He is painful to watch. Every other character just feeds off of his energy and doesn't do very well. I would rather spend five hours watching peanutbutter - no punchline or joke. I would literally rather spend 3 times the length of this movie watching an inanimate object.",1455667200,2,510,4.554347826086956
7321405,1,B0112HPUQI,"I'm a huge fan of the HC series; part one is remarkably tasteful considering the horrifying subject matter. Part two changes things up by being exactly as graphic and horrific as you'd expect based on the subject matter.

Part three is... an objectively terrible film.

I'm not exactly sure what happened, here. It almost seems like they decided they couldn't make another good movie, so they would intentionally make one that is ""so bad, it's good"". Unfortunately, that is impossible to do intentionally. The terrible dialogue, casting, acting, and plot all seem to suggest that the writer and director are attempting to make the movie into a joke-- something that someone would not criticize because it is obviously INTENDED to be bad.

Well, I'm still going to criticize, because there's no excuse for capping such a great trilogy with such a terrible movie. The whole thing is absurd, B-movie gibberish. Unlike the other two movies, it seems to takes place in some kind of bizarre dystopia where there are no laws and everyone is insane. Half the lines are incoherently screamed by someone who barely speaks English, so make sure to turn on subtitles. Actually, don't do that. Instead, don't watch this movie at all.

Perhaps the worst sin of all? We don't actually see a Human Centipede until 3/4 of the way into the movie, and frankly they do almost nothing new with the concept.

This movie is unsalvageable.",1454630400,2,1415,4.879166666666666
7321406,1,B0112HPUQI,"This film damages the image of the first two films. This is not even close to the first two. The vast majority of the movie features Dieter Laser yelling in slow, loud, hard to understand nonsense. It is not until the very end of the movie that there is any centipede action.

I enjoyed the first two movies, but this one disappoints!",1453593600,,334,4.387096774193548
7321407,1,B0112HPUQI,"What happened? Part 3 is worse than the first, who would have imagened this even remotely possible. Laser gives a hilarious performance as the always yelling, hard to understand lunatic which resembles some of H*tler's speeches. Just awful. After the fantastic second one this is the biggest let- down in horror- history. And by far the worst movie Of 2015.",1451088000,2,357,4.966666666666667
7321408,3,B0112HPUQI,"I started with this series because of the mentioning of conjoined twins(my morbid fascination).  It was not what I expected but was certainly different.  Hey, it was cheesy enough for South Park to parody.  That makes HC 1 a winner in my book.

On to number two(no pun intended but somehow perfect).  Many complained about it being in black and white.  I, on the other hand, thought it was an excellent effect.  To me it was like I could almost FEEL the filth and grime.  Also this one is over the top in the shock value.  Also this movie was a sequel in name only because it has little to do with the first one at all.

HC 3.  To me it was somewhere between the other two all around.  It had shock value but not as much as HC 2 and Laser, although a prison warden, was basically the mad doctor again.  There were many meta jokes, Eric Roberts, and of course the 500 pieces of the human centipede.
Two things I do wonder about 1)Tom Six said there would be a surprise happy ending yet I could not figure out how and 2)how would this centipede be a good option when it could not sustain only three people?

Over all I enjoyed it but when movies start going into innings on sequels something is always lost in translation.  Oh, and contrary to a second season episode of South Park said someone DOES give a s*** about Eric Roberts.",1450656000,,1329,4.26
7321409,3,B0112HPUQI,"Love the first two, but this one was a little overrated to my taste.",1449532800,,68,3.9285714285714284
7321410,1,B0112HPUQI,"Total crap, he got lucky with the first film, 2 and now 3 are just pointless crap.",1449273600,2,82,3.8823529411764706
8723486,5,B0112HPUQI,"My favorite of the centipede movies, extremely over the top and violent with Erik Roberts as the governor.",1531267200,,106,4.944444444444445

8723488,1,B0112HPUQI,Didn't even work! Looks like a blank disc!,1525132800,,42,4.375
8723489,5,B0112HPUQI,"Many of you are not going to get this flick. If you're going in thinking it's going to be anything like the first two movies, well, you probably didn't get the first two movies either.

This is much more a black comedy than a horror. It has horror elements like gore and violence but on the whole this movie just made me laugh my ass off. I saw it in the theater and it holds up on the re-watch.

The Human Centipede trilogy is a work of genius by Tom Six and I can't wait for his next project.",1485907200,,494,3.9797979797979797
8723490,2,B0112HPUQI,bad movie,1485734400,,9,4.0
8723491,3,B0112HPUQI,Part 1 and Part 2 are waaay better. See this ONLY if you are a di-hard fan like myself.,1484784000,,87,3.6315789473684212
8723492,5,B0112HPUQI,Loved this movie.  Probably my favorite of the Human Centipede movies.  I can totally understand how some people hate it.  I think it's either a love or hate kind of movie.  The main character is absolutely insane but I find him entertaining and hilarious.  His sidekick (the main character from the previous movie) is great in his role as well.  I rented this from a video store but am definitely looking to pick it up on blu-ray.  Truly an enjoyable experience.,1482796800,,463,4.6419753086419755
8723493,1,B0112HPUQI,This review is based entirely for the movie itself. It's terrible. I own the first and second HC and bought this thinking it'd be good. Don't waste your money.,1481587200,,159,4.517241379310345
8723494,1,B0112HPUQI,This movie is junk. Dr from the 1st Centipede and the fat guy from #2. DO NOT spend money on this.,1474934400,,98,3.7142857142857144
8723495,5,B0112HPUQI,"Loved the first two.  Each one was done in a different style. This one is also different in style from the proceeding films.  This one is reminiscent of the old Roger Corman movies.  It pushes the envelope, sometimes to silliness at the expense of the film, but even with this, it was well worth watching.  Sick but enjoyably so.  If you liked the first two, get this one.",1469404800,2,372,4.411764705882353
