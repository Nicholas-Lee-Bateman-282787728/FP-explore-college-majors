8572788,4,B00BQRAZOC,"I enjoyed this documentary. I only wish that I came away knowing a bit more about Paul Kelly than I did. The filmmakers do present him as being somewhat ""unknowable"" based on comments from some of his associates.

I met him a couple of times, many years ago, and I found him to be a very nice guy.

If you're in the US and you have a Mac, Google ""VLC"" and ""Handbrake"" and you'll have everything you need to watch this movie on your Mac or send it to your Apple TV.",1384560000,,464,4.032608695652174
