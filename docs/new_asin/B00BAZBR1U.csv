5568823,5,B00BAZBR1U,There are not enough stars to rate this Item. I am so pleased with this it is exactly what I need to learn the 6D. The presentation is straightforward accurate and friendly as if the fellow is your neighbor or favorite cousin. Buy this and you will learn Quickly and love it.,1376438400,3,275,4.3076923076923075
5568824,5,B00BAZBR1U,This is an excellent video! I had just purchased my first DSLR (EOS 6D) and this video was a huge help.  I purchased this video along with the Canon 6D Instructional DVD by QuickPro Camera Guides when I bought my camera.  The QuickPro wasn't bad and did a great job explaining the buttons of the 6D but Michael's crash course video explained sooo much more along with going over all the buttons.  If I hadn't bought this video I wouldn't be getting nearly as much out of my 6D.,1369353600,17,477,4.337078651685394
5568825,5,B00BAZBR1U,"It is excellent, explained so well and so easy to understand, I have since ordered some more of his DVD's",1368057600,4,105,4.3
8565086,5,B00BAZBR1U,Good informative video,1494979200,,22,6.666666666666667
8565087,5,B00BAZBR1U,"This dvd is great to own if your new to using the Canon 6d. Gives you a great overview to the camera. Also, on the dvd is a photography crash course. Lots of good information! Highly recommend to any new Canon 6d user.",1453766400,2,218,4.093023255813954
8565088,5,B00BAZBR1U,"OMG THE BEST!!!  I got a 7D for my birthday a couple years back and had no idea what P, AV, TV etc.. meant?!  My pictures were horrible and it was so sad because we had spent 1500 on this camera!  I bought several books that were so boring I couldn't make myself read them.  Then I found this Michael the Maven Video!  Easy to watch and super easy to learn.  He explains it in a way that anyone can learn about boring old F Stops!  And you will know your camera inside and out.  Everyone should buy these !!!!!!
I just bought a 6D and I'm buying another MTM video - I can't wait.",1425686400,5,579,3.973913043478261
8565089,3,B00BAZBR1U,Too much about photography and not enough about camera settings and set up.,1406678400,,75,4.846153846153846
8565090,4,B00BAZBR1U,must have for a beginner starting out with FF camera. easy to follow and informative,1406505600,,84,4.666666666666667
8565091,5,B00BAZBR1U,"This was exactly what I hoped it would be. Michael does a great job of running through the camera and provides very helpful tips about how you can use the camera and how he sets up his camera and why. The Canon 6D is a more sophisticated camera than my 3Ti and I wanted to get to understand the different features and how to use them to their full potential. Michael teaches in an easy to understand fashion following each screen and explaining what each symbol means, how to take advantage of each one, and which ones he really finds helpful or avoids. I learn so much easier when someone teaches me verses reading and this was perfect. It resembles a one-on-one tutorial and you can stop, review, and go at your own speed. I am really enjoying the camera and would not hesitate to use his other tutorials such as using the Canon flash system with the camera. THANK YOU!",1399248000,9,871,4.416149068322981
8565092,4,B00BAZBR1U,"It is a good book to see what are the possibilities of the camera.
Also the technical quality of the DVD is OK",1393545600,,110,3.8260869565217392
8565093,5,B00BAZBR1U,"I bought both this and the quick pro guide video for reference when I got my 6D and found this to be much better, the difference between something mass produced, formulaic and slightly altered according to whatever model of camera (quick pro) and this for which he actually seemed as though he had a practical working knowledge of the camera. Not only did he explain what the settings do for example but also what his preferences were and why, he was just much more insightful, personable and clear in the way he presented the material.",1389398400,9,536,4.652631578947369
8565094,4,B00BAZBR1U,Michael simplifies the technical for all levels of understanding.  He has knowledge and knows how to share it. Good crash course.,1386374400,2,129,5.142857142857143
