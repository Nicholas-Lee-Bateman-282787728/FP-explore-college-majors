3498290,5,B001BSBBGM,"The film has undergone a reboot and has even been made into a musical. Seymour's (Jonathan Haze) plant has a taste for humans. The film spoofs ""Dragnet"" with  Det. Sgt .Joe Fink (Wally Campo) and Det. Frank Stoolie (Jack Warford). Jack Nicholson has a minor role as a creepy masochistic character.  Jackie Joseph who played Audrey would later appear in ""Gremlins"" 1 and 2 and ""Police Academy"" 2 and 4. She was also the voice for Melody in ""Josie and the Pussycats"" TV cartoon series. Dick Miller, the man eating carnations would make a living out of playing a character named ""Walter Paisley"" in a half dozen films or episodes.

It was always fun to stay up on Friday night and watch it on the old 17 inch Philco I had fixed my self by installing an old picture tube from a slightly smaller TV.

3498326,5,B001BSBBGM,"This 1960 film may be America's best movie.  It has just about everything you could want from a movie: mystery, suspense, horror, romance, comedy, crime, botany, and more.

The main character is Seymour who is a perennial non-achiever, mostly due to the influence of his overbearing and neurotic mother who is a hypochondriac.  He works in a struggling flower shop in the skid row district of Los Angeles.  He accidentally develops a hybrid plant which he names Audrey after his sweet and pretty co-employee who is definitely a bimbo.  The plant mutates into a man-eating monster and develops the ability to talk and demand food.  The plot goes on from there.  It is best to watch the black and white version to appreciate the original flavor.

Nowadays much is made of an appearance by Jack Nicholson which is small and unremarkable.  This may have been his first film.",1442707200,,870,4.824324324324325

There are much better copies available on the internet (legal too, it's not in copyright) that are sharp, all the shades of grey are there, and the audio is clear.",1441670400,,455,4.352941176470588

3498354,5,B001BSBBGM,"This is the CLASSIC, ORIGINAL, Directed-by-Roger-Corman Little Shop of Horrors.  It's been awhile since I played it.  I seem to recall there is a B&W version included, which is how it was done originally.  If you are a cultist of this film as I am, you will be happy with it.  I can imagine how some would consider the film lame, but I adore it.  For those unfamiliar:
Seymor Krelboyne, a shy young man who lives with his hilarious hypochondriac mother, works at an inner city flower shop owned by a Mr Mushnik. In his spare time, at said shop, Seymor develops a plant that is a cross between two unrelated but carnivorous plants.  He names it ""Audrey"" after his love-interest, a young woman who also works at the shop.  He is quite unhappy that the plant is failing until he accidentally cuts his finger and some of the blood drops into the plant.  The plant responds (like an animal, chomping its petals, acting excited) so Seymore squeezes more of his blood into the plant.  The next day, the plant is much larger.

Time passes and Audrey the Plant develops the ability to bellow ""FEED ME!!""  Audrey also devours humans, first a hobo that Seymore accidently kills and stuffs into ""Audrey"" then later Mr Mushnik, cornered by an armed robber at his shop, operating on instinct tricks the thug into climbing into the now-huge flower by claiming that's where the money is.  Mushnik is surprised and horrified by the result.  THird victim is a hilariously sadistic dentist character.  Necessity forces Seymor to impersonate the dentist and does a bang-up job of tooth extraction on a masochistic dental patient (first movie role of Jack Nicholson!)  Dr Whatever also ends up on Audrey.  Meanwhile, a city detective starts sniffing around and Seymor's romance with (Human) Audrey blossoms.  The climax in the flower shop when the now HUGE Audrey the Plant's true nature is revealed to a whole bunch of distinguished guests is hilarious.

Production values in this vintage comedy horror are pretty nil and VERY low-budget but the script is brilliant and the actors are quite good.",1418083200,,2076,4.8

3498367,3,B001BSBBGM,"This GOODTIMES version of ""Little Shop"" is recorded in LP speed and doesn't contain a HiFi audio track.

Slower speed non-HiFi tapes have degraded picture quality, with sound clarity that's dependent on the alignment of your machine's playback head (a stationary device similar to the sort found in a cassette deck). The slightest variation in azimuth from the mfr's dubbing unit means blurry audio, often with a background squeal. Additionally, such slow-moving tracks have limited frequency range and an increased amount of flutter.

All HiFi videotapes come with a back-up linear track such as described above, but on HiFi VCRs the sound, which is laid down on a slant alongside the video portion, is picked up by the rotating video drum. This simulates a tape moving at an enormous rate of speed. The advantage is a frequency response, dynamic range and harmonic distortion level that nearly equals CDs in quality (if you connect your VCR's audio outs to a decent amplifier).

All pedantry aside, for anyone still seeking a videotape of this classic film, choose one from a major studio rather than a budget brand like GOODTIMES.

.
As anyone who has seen it knows, THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS does NOT star Jack Nicholson. He has an amusing cameo only.

It's the odd story of nebbish Seymour Krelboin (Haze) whose crossbreeding experiments in the backroom of Mushnick's Flower Shop result in a man-eating plant. The meshuggah cast includes a guy that eats flowers (Miller), a pain freak who relishes Novocaine-free dentistry (Nicholson), and a bizarro plant named Audrey Jr. that frequently moans ""feed me"" in the voice of screenwriter/co-director Charles B. Griffith.

Roger Corman's no-budget masterpiece was created in three days. Never expecting what he considered a throwaway to do anything but disappear after a brief theatrical/drive-in run, Corman allowed its copyright to lapse. ""Little Shop"" has since become both a cult classic and a Broadway musical that was adapted in 1986 into a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/popular-movie/dp/B002NZK5TG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">popular movie</a>&nbsp;(directed by Frank Oz) that stars Rick Moranis, Vincent Gardenia and Steve Martin.

3498369,5,B001BSBBGM,What a fun time had by all as we watched one of the funniest movies ever. The remake (a musical? Really?) is not worth watching  ut this original is great.,1395705600,,155,4.166666666666667
3498370,5,B001BSBBGM,"Why they have the Mike-Only versions when they've done ""three riffer"" editions (with mike, kevin and bill) and Rifftrax Live! events (except Little Shop of Horrors and Carnival of Souls) aswell is beyond me - but I enjoy them. It gives you a perspective on how Rifftrax has grown into what it is today. Before Mike was trying to be comedic but also be a traditional commetary track - giving you information and tid bits about the movie and actors (which were inciteful in all cases, especially the mike-only Carnival of Souls, which has the most inciteful information into the movies actors, locations etc Salt Aire in particular always fascinated me - I was hoping it still existed/could be visited but it's been rebuilt three times - the latest incarnation is now used a music hall/venue for artists who want to play at the creepy carnival from carnival of souls. Which was actually an Morman themepark that was built on the Salt Lakes (but kept getting destroyed one way or another, first time moving - literally - due to a dry season with the salt lake, something like 3-5 miles away from its original location - probably wrecking most of the structure and entrances/pathways - 2nd time I believe there was a fire.) Strange. I don't have much else to say except this is easily my favorite Rifftrax'd (or MST3K'd) Roger Corman Film by Far. I didn't even know the musical from the late 90s was a remake of this pioneer in black  comedy from Corman! Easily one of the best films corman ever made (supposedly in 3 days because he had extra time from another movie, and someone bet him he couldn't make a movie in so many days - but that is true but not for Little Shop of Horrors but another film of Cormans. I don't think Corman could've crafted this great film, in Three Days (did I just say Roger Corman, and Great Film in the same sentence?! haha Seriously - its a hilarious movie by itself. Every character is so over to the top. Its justs a RIDICULOUS movie, perfect for riffing. The riffing is like the icing on the cake that makes it a great anytime watch you want to have a laugh. Highly reccomended (esp. The Three Riffer edition to the MSTies out there) for someone whos transitioning from MST3K to Rifftrax (as its a Corman film)",1395619200,,2241,4.547029702970297

It was amusing to see some of the local color elements like the kids getting flowers for their rose parade float after being lured to the shop by the Audrey II.

3498400,3,B001BSBBGM,"It is said that Roger Corman produced this campy cult classic in just two days for a mere $30,000 using recycled sets from a previous production, but of all his cheap quickies, THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is easily his most enjoyable! In it, a poor shopkeeper nurses a rare and exotic plant back to life in order to save his job, but there is only one problem... The plant demands blood! THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is a sadistic black comedy that shows just how far a little creativity and a few quirky characters can go without the need for a big budget or overblown effects. Mel Welles and Jonathan Haze make a wonderful pair as the boisterous Mr. Mushnick and Seymour Krelboyne, while the rest of the eccentric cast members come back with equally entertaining performances. Dick Miller strolls through set eating his weight in flowers, Leola Wendorff stops in daily to mourn another lost relative, John Herman Shaner takes great delight in torturing his dental patients, and a young Jack Nicholson gleefully welcomes the pain. The shoddy sets and cheesy special effects only add to the low-budget charm, along with the off brand of wicked humor. THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS would become the basis for a successful Off-Broadway musical, and would later be adapted into the successful 1980's remake.

Also I recommend the documentary Corman's World if you are a fan of Corman's movies. It is fascinating to learn more about him, his hundreds of movies and New World production studio.

My only small complaint is that in order to watch the movie in its original B&W glory you have to navigate through the special features. Why wouldn't they make the original format available on the main menu, alongside new colorized version?",1353888000,,596,4.730769230769231

I usually don't go for colorized versions of B&W movies, so I was very happy to see that they offer both versions on this disc. That being said, the colorization looks wonderful. The technology sure has come a long way since I first saw an I Love Lucy episode that had been given the treatment ten years ago. These colors are so vibrant and lifelike. Watching this Blu-Ray version is a completely different experience, from the amazingly clear visuals to the absolutely perfect sound. Restorations like this make my old-movie-loving heart soar.

Now, as if that weren't enough, this DVD comes with a fantastic bonus feature that took me by complete surprise when I received it in the mail today: There is a commentary by Mike Nelson. THE Mike Nelson of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and Rifftrax fame. Mike has done a full riffing of the film, which you can choose to watch by going to the Extras section of the disc menu.

3498411,3,B001BSBBGM,"This is very different from the slick 1980s version, with the soul-singing carnivorous plant and his toady, Seymour.  In this version, Seymour is a fool under the thumb of his mother, a psychosomatic invalid.  He is nurturing an unusual plant in which his boss, a skid-row florist with big ambitions, takes an interest.  Seymour stumbles on the way to make  the plant grow - feeding it the people he inadvertently kills.  His boss sees it as the key to his fortune, but is horrified by what he witnesses, eventually helping a team of idiotic cops as they investigate the strange goingson.

The humor is very much of the period, kind of slapstick stumbling and tripping, with a cast of strange characters from a man who eats only flowers to a hooker who tries to pick up Seymour and then disappears.  The most notable part is the cameo of the young Jack Nicholson, as a masocist in a sadistic dentist's office.

This film is rightly a 1960s cult classic, full of lurid detail and the most bizarre plot imaginable.  Unlike the 1986 version, the ending is much darker as are the characters.  It got me to laugh several times at its signal weirdness.  The scenes are also interesting, set in a drab corner of a very ethnic New York.

REcommended for those of us who grew up during this time.  I do not think that colorizing this is in any way necessary.",1300147200,,1349,4.547717842323651

3498413,5,B001BSBBGM,"""Shut up and bring on the food!""

There are many releases of this film
and there will likely be many more.
Buyer beware regarding video
and sound quality.
There is a colorized version (why!)
released by Legend Films (7/1/2008)
which is accompanied by the original
black and white version,
so it is a safe purchase,
although one reviewer has complained
that the black and white version
on that release has an omission.

An annoying aspect of the marketing of
this film is that often the name of
Jack Nicholson is placed as the star
of the film which is not only far from
the truth, but also an insult to those
who were. Jack Nicholson was in one short
scene and he was funny, but it was not
even part of the plot and could have been
omitted, although I am glad that it was not.

This is a dark comedy classic
by the legendary film director
Roger Corman.
Pair this with ""A Bucket Of Blood,
also by Roger Corman,
and you have a great,
and I do mean, GREAT, double-feature
of camp film-noir terror-comedy-satire
movies that that are unique and original.

A ""nerdy"" employee of a flower shop
managed by a hilarious shop owner
in a run-down city neighborhood
grows a one-of-a-kind hybrid plant
at the home where he lives with his
hilarious hypochondriac mother.
He brings the plant to the shop
in an attempt to save his job and
to establish himself as a ""somebody"".
The plant we learn is a carnivorous
one with an appetite for human flesh
and blood and the will and talent
to get it.

The comedy is relentless.
Every character, and there are
quite a few, is funny.
and as an ensemble, they blend
seamlessly.
Even the plant's line of ""feed me""
and ""I need food"" (etc) becomes funny.

This plant is more than a plant,
as we learn when it hypnotizes
it's ""father"" to find it food
and later yields flowers with the
faces of the people that it has eaten.
The plant may represent an alter-ego
of its maker.

A big part of the charm of the movie
is that it does not take itself seriously.
There is no attempt to polish the acting,
the action or the dialogue.
I'm guessing that every scene was done
in one take with minimal preparation
and I'm glad that it was.

This is not a great-achievement-of
-film-art five-star movie.
It is a entertaining-funny-enjoyable
five-star movie.
That is not to say that it is is not
good film art. There is a reason
that so many of the highly acclaimed
and respected filmmakers and actors
of later years worked for and learned
from Corman.

Honorable mention must be made
of the score.
The music for this movie and for
""A Bucket Of Blood"" by Fed Katz
are some very ""cool"" and ""hip""
avante-garde jazz jams,
especially during the final chase
scenes which are excellent.

Not all will like this movie,
but for those of the camp
and horror cognoscenti
it is great classic and a must-see,
must-have movie.",1293840000,,2819,4.477582846003899
3498414,1,B001BSBBGM,"Slingshot has pissed on us YET AGAIN!!! This time it's in the form of a ""3D"" (I use that term loosely) conversion of the Corman cult classic. It's a classic, and I was looking for a copy when I was in a production of the musical. I wasted $25 on this crappy copy!!!

1. IT DOESN'T COME WITH 3D GLASSES. Not a problem with me since I have quite a few kicking around the house.

2. The ""3D"" is no 3D at all. I got a bad feeling in my stomach when I saw how bad the (cheesy,I must add) DVD menu looked. I got really bad double vision after 5 minutes. No pop-outs, no depth... what a waste of eyesight.

3. The 2D version is crap quality. Not that it was a surprise since it's an old film and its print has been through a lot of transfers. But I can barely understand what the characters are saying. And sometimes I can barely see what's going on through the thick layers of grain. The nighttime scenes are the worst, specifically where Seymour kills the prostitute by throwing a large stone in the air and making sure it lands on her head.

4. There's no extras. Blow.

5. Time for another installment of ""Video Box Idiocy"", something I started on my review of ""Night of Horror"". The banner at the top of the front cover reads ""3D HORROR CLASSICS"". First off, this isn't a horror movie. Sure it has that b-movie horror concept, but it's a COMEDY. Then on the back of the box, the summary keeps calling it a horror movie when again, it's a COMEDY. If that wasn't bad enough, the last line in the summary reads ""Watch Audrey Jr. fight for his life in 3D!"". OK. Have they even seen the movie??? Audrey Jr. doesn't ""Fight for his life"". We only get 10 minutes of Audrey II and the only scenes we see him doing anything that even resembles ""fighting for his life"" is when he demands to be fed.

Overall, by all means buy this movie, but save your money on this pile of crap DVD.",1289347200,,1870,4.180555555555555

Forget the musical re-make made in the 1980s. It couldn't hold a candle to the original.

""Original"" is what this is, too. and nowadays, it's great to have it on DVD in which the audio is clear and the picture pretty sharp.

I have always particularly enjoyed the many humorous lines delivered by Mel Welles, who plays the flower shop owner. He is the real comedian of the cast, although the plant does quite well as do the two leads played by Jonathan Haze and Jackie Joseph. The latter two are a little more subtle in their comedy.

All the characters in here are totally whacked, from Haze's hypochondriac mother to Dick Miller's flower-eating character to the Jewish mother who always has a dead relative to moan about and to the dentist and his patient. The latter, of course, is Jack Nicholson, making his movie debut and looking about 16 years old.

In the end, though, what one remembers most is the plant demanding, over and over, to ""Feeeeeed me!!""

For that, the plant and the film never fail to make me laugh.",1236902400,,1256,4.462882096069869
3498423,5,B001BSBBGM,"You're probably all familiar with the Little Shop of Horrors.  After all, its several incarnations over the decades have endeared it to popular culture in a way which few movies ever emulate.  If you appreciate the subsequent musical antics of Seymour the Singing Plant, you owe it to yourself to watch this version--the cult favorite that started it all.

Plus, you'll get a look at one of Jack Nicholson's earliest roles.

Admittedly, the Amazon preview video isn't very informative, but this version of the 1960 classic is in full color for the first time ever, and has markedly improved in visual quality from versions previous, presumably because of the higher standards for something being watched on a high definition computer monitor as opposed to a low-def tube television.",1228435200,,782,5.0859375
3498424,5,B001BSBBGM,"With a story immortalized by the follow-up Rick Moranis remake, the original 1960 Little Shop of Horrors is a timeless classic of American cinema and storytelling.  After all, what is more quintessentially American than a wisecracking, blood-thirsty plant?  And although Jack Nicholson's much-promoted role in the film is rather minor, Little Shop does provide the curious student of film with the opportunity to observe some of his early work.

This DVD by newcomer Legend Films is a particularly good value to both collectors and fans alike because it contains not just the newly colorized version of the movie, but also a cleaned-up black and white version.  Why is this so important?  For starters, the original film is now in the public domain.  While this is great for ensuring wide availability of the material and its consequent long-term survival, it often creates a situation where a good number of shoddy copies flood the market, making it difficult to find a truly ""watch-able"" version of the film, or certainly one worth spending good money on.  The fully-restored black and white version provided on this DVD represents the best-available quality of the film, particularly because it has been significantly cleaned up by Legend, who appears to be the only studio paying due attention to classic films.

In our day and age of media overload and colors galore, a strong case can be made for the necessity of colorizing old films.  When you watch Little Shop of Horrors, I believe that unless you know the film has been colorized after the fact, you would not be able to tell otherwise.  This is not the shoddy Ted Turner-esque colorization of the 1980s, and the advance of technology in the interim decades certainly shows in a positive way.

I would be remiss if I did not also make special mention of a unique Special Feature attendant to this particular DVD.  Included with both versions of the film is a Mystery Science Theater 3000 style commentary by the show's former writer and star, Mike Nelson.  For the uninitiated, MST3K was a decade long cult television show wherein Mike and two fellow comedians would spurt forth hilarious commentary during a low budget sci-fi movie.  The whole process itself essentially constitutes an entire third version of the film, because it so dramatically changes the movie watching experience with its pertinent humor.",1227571200,,2372,5.017857142857143

The fact that Corman shot this film at record speed and made a great film is really something special.  I've never seen the musicial remake (even though some say it's as good as the original, just a different take on it), but I kind of don't want to ruin the impact this film had.

3498430,1,B001BSBBGM,"Some movies are so bad that they are good fun.  This isn't one of those.  ""Eating Raoul"" was one, but ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" is simply a mess.  As a horror film, it isn't very scary.  After all, a plant cannot move to chase you, no matter how hungry or big it is.  And as a comedy, this is just plain stupid.  There's a very pretty girl who spouts malaprops that perhaps are supposed to be amusing.  And a klutzy boy who always wears a scarf for no apparent reason and who keeps tripping over things and keeps tripping and tripping.  And a woman named Shiva (Jewish joke, get it?) whose relatives keep dying.  And then there's a very youthful Jack Nicholson who enjoys dental pain.  I'm pretty sure Jack would like to destroy all copies of this film.  That's how bad he is in it.

Somehow this became a cult film.  The reasons are inexplicable.  It isn't because there's an interesting plot.  Or that the acting and directing are superb.  I doubt that anyone finds the attempts at comedy to be very funny.  I suspect that even those who claim to like this film do not really like it, except for the fact that it is ""In.""

3498431,4,B001BSBBGM,"Sometimes camp becomes cult.  Such is what happened with the 1960 movie ""The Little Shop of Horrors.""  Roger Corman produced or directed one schlock film after another in the 1950's and ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" seemed like it would be another in a series of low budget movies.  However, fate had other plans for ""The Little Shop of Horrors.""

Mild, meek, clumsy Seymour Krelboin (Jonathan Haze) has an awful life.  His mother is a hypochondriac, his boss is bossy and overbearing, and Seymour has little talent for much of anything.  Seymour's life changes when he stumbles on seeds of unknown heritage.  Seymour nurses a seed into a plant, which quickly becomes the strangest looking plant that anyone could imagine.  However, the plant does not do well until Seymour accidentally cuts his finger; the plant suddenly perks up.

Life appears to take a turn for the better for Seymour.  His boss Gravis Mushnik (Mel Welles) begins calling Seymour ""son"" and Seymour finally has the nerve to ask Audrey Fulquard (Jackie Joseph) on a date.  Considering Seymour's life thus far, no one is surprised when the plant, called Audrey, Jr., by Seymour, becomes sickly.  There is only one cure for Audrey, Jr., best spoken by Audrey, Jr.:  ""Feed me!""  Seymour's life takes two parallel paths.  There is Seymour's life when everyone is around, which is great, and then there is Seymour's life at night, when Audrey, Jr., demands Seymour to ""Feed me!""  Eventually Seymour must face the consequences of life with a demanding, carnivorous plant.

One unusual performance in this film is that of a then unknown actor, Jack Nicholson.  Nicholson is hilarious and bizarre as pain-loving Wilbur Force.  I can see the future Nicholson in the character of Wilbur Force who would eventually utter the classic line, ""Here's Johnny,"" in ""The Shining.""

Corman managed to film most of this movie in two days for approximately $27,000.  This movie made the rounds of the drive-in movie circuit and would have disappeared into B-movie decay but for late night television.  This movie got a lot of airplay as part of various weekly horror movie shows (e.g., ""Chiller"" and ""Creature Features"") throughout the country to the pleasure of adoring fans, eventually spawning a Broadway play and a musical movie remake.  However, it is difficult to make a cult classic, and the remake ""Little Shop of Horrors,"" while clever and funny, fails to be as charming as the original.

""The Little Shop of Horrors"" is a cute and funny, though a bit bizarre, movie.  There is a lot of humor in this film if you have an open mind.  Sure, the special effects are cheap and cheesy, but, like episodes of ""Dr. Who,"" there is a certain charm in it all that keeps me coming back.  If you enjoy B-horror and science fiction films from the 1950's and 1960's, particularly if you also like Jack Nicholson, you are going to love this movie.

3498436,5,B001BSBBGM,"Roger Corman's Original 1960 version of ""The Little Shop Of Horrors"" is considered by many as a true cult classic comedy of B-Movies,even the most respected of film critics. Unfortunately depending on the tastes and opinions of film fans that were used to seeing this legendary film comedy through the public domain since there was a lack of copyright in the titles,(same thing had happen to ""Night Of The Living Dead"") and for many years since the dawn of the videocassette and late late movie shows,those versions were vastly inferior and often poor-looking in terms of presentation and contrast. Now the great folks at Legend Films have finally put out a brand-new definitive and excellent restored presentation of this cult hit on DVD in both the original black & white version as well as the disc's main presentation of showcasing a brand-new restored digitally colorized version too. As with previous selected Legend releases of classic horror/B-movies in their DVD series,the disc features a well-done and at times hilarious commentary by MST3K's Mike Nelson and the great thing is that you can listen to the track on both versions of the film,giving the b&w version sort of a MST3K-flavor to it (I love how he refers to the opening Filmgroup logo as little Reese Cups !).Despite packaging claims that is the first time the film has been colorized,it's actually the second colorized incarnation of the film. First colorized on videocassette in the very late '80's with lousy and at times amateur results,this Legend version completely blows away the first attempt and looks like it was actually filmed in color,but of course this films' legendary budgetary constraints prevented from actually filming it in color. Of course lets not forget that the film features a very very young Jack Nicholson,in his fourth film role,in a memorable role as a crazy dentist patient. I must say,this Legend version of ""Little Shop"" is probably the most superior and sharpest looking out of all the previous versions of the film that you're possibly going to see and no wonder it was transferred from an excellent 35mm print of the film ! Other extras,besides the Nelson commentary,round out the package including both restored color/unrestored b&w trailers to ""Little Shop"",and the following colorized trailers for ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"",""House On Haunted Hill"",""Carnival Of Souls"",and ""Reefer Madness"".Plus a gallery of nine man-eating plants,if any kids are planning to do a school project on man-eating plants,this could actually be a fun reference guide,and also a very short clip called ""Man Eating Plants"" which is actually the president of Legend Films Barry Sandrew vigorously eating vegetable plants such as celery (always eat your vegetables folks !).Well-done packaging,excellent eye-catching menus and a sparkling transfer of both versions will definitely please any film buff,both Hollywood and B-Movie fans alike !  This is by far one of the first best DVD releases of 2006 and is highly recommended for old and new fans alike instead of those who only prefer the 1986 spectacular Frank Oz musical remake with Rick Moranis and Steve Martin. Highly recommended !

UPDATE 11/24/06:
Just Recently,Buena Vista Home Entertainment in association with Roger Corman have finally released an ""authorized"" DVD release of ""Little Shop Of Horrors"" as well as a nicely restored original black & white version of Nicholson's debut film ""The Cry Baby Killer"".Unfortunately,the recent disc's presentation of ""Little Shop"" is in fact the ORIGINAL colorized version,slightly mentioned above,that was first produced and eventually released to video in 1987 by Color Systems Technology. The source print used for the color version (other than the fact that the quality was directly copied off a video master for the DVD) is surprisingly in quite good condition,but it really truly is one of the worst examples of 1980's colorization technology I've ever seen and will probably be the last. The colors are often the same as certain objects (ie: the outside of Mushnick's Shop and the greens for the flowers,etc.),tons of continuity errors (ie: clothing,signs,etc.) and does anybody wish to care seeing Audrey Jr. looking like a talking watermelon plant?  Reportedly,that color version was authorized by none other than Corman himself and it's easy to see why many directors above his stature hate and disregard colorization. Nicholson/Corman fans alike aren't going to be impressed with that bust of a release and it's very easy to see why the '87 colorized version was out of circulation for many years. Easier said than done,the newly restored Legend Films release is by far,hands down,the real winner due to the technology,version options,and bonus materials !",1152489600,,4750,5.247368421052632
3498437,4,B001BSBBGM,"Basic Plot: When the employee of a small street-corner flower shop brings in a strange-looking plant that grows and grows, the seemingly hopeless business skyrockets with more and more curious customers. Unfortunately, the secret to this monster of a plant is that it feeds on human blood!

The film itself was surprising. I expected it right from the start to be a dud, but it quickly blossomed (excuse the pun) into a pretty funny horror-comedy. It's a fairly cheap 1960 black-n-white movie, so don't expect anything of a masterpiece. But for the price it's so commonly found at, it's certainly entertaining and worth the purchase.

Now, as many DVDs will boast, Jack Nicholson did indeed take part in The Little Shop Of Horrors, but it's not one of his first big roles. He'd only done a few, pretty much unknown films before this, and his character did not get a lot of screen time. Just under four minutes, more precisely. He plays the part of a quirky, nasally-voiced dental patient named Wilbur Force who finds pleasure in pain (hence his excitement to be at the dentist -- insisting that the doc uses no novocaine because it ""dulls the senses""). While the small time he has on the screen is amusing, it is definitely too short! Nicholson fans will love to see him at just 23 years old, yet will be left longing for more.

Regardless of the brief nature of Jack's inclusion (again, it's still a great scene), I think The Little Shop Of Horrors is overall a decently funny movie that's worth the buy. Unfortunately, as far as extras go for this particular edition, there's nothing to look forward to. Unless you want to take an extremely easy quiz on the movie (it's three questions long for pete's sake!) or read a small bio on Nicholson (which is obviously invalid in its info, listing his ""1992"" movie as ""Batman2"" -- '92? Come on, everybody knows it's '89, and with that 2 or Z or whatever on the end somebody should really check these things for typos before sending them into mass production) then it's pretty much pointless to think of this DVD as the ""Collector's Edition"" it advertises itself as. And even though the sound comes through alright, the picture quality is a bit weak. So, for those thinking about getting the ""Platinum Disc"" DVD (the one with the cover having half of Jack's smirking face on it with a bluish background), I'd just warn you that there are probably much better deals for around the same price.",1146614400,,2435,4.671328671328672

Curiously three of these deaths are accidental but one is induced by the floristry's  owner and all of them are nightly facts. Additionally we have a broad display of characters depicted with sublime cynicism as the eat flower, the low budget Mrs. who lives according a predetermined script: familiar tragedy to get discount, and a masochist who thrives the dental interventions: Jack Nicholson in his beginnings.

The film was made in just two days and remains to my mind as the most surrealist American movie until now. This movie joins to Hallelujah, the hills and the Troublemaker as the purest and genuine independent expression of the craziest humor in those decades.",1123286400,,1124,5.037634408602151

""Little Shop Of Horrors"" was shot with a tight budget, but it doesn't matter, because if a director and his crew are creative, they can make a good movie with little money, and ""Little Shop Of Horrors"" is one of those movies.

The film has a very charismatic cast, all the actors play a eccentric character, but all of them are funny and their performances are essential to the success of the movie.

Seymour works at Mushnick's, where a steady stream of eccentric characters happen through, including Dick Miller (WAR OF THE SATELLITES, A BUCKET OF BLOOD) as a guy who loves to eat flowers.

3498445,5,B001BSBBGM,"This is THE Roger Corman classic. Made in three days on very little money it's an absolute classic of demented renegade film making. Crazy characters of the best writing, period music and atmosphere of those times. Jack Nicholson's first memorable appearance and some great performances of looney characters by Jonathan Haze and especially Mel Welles as Gravis Mushnick who never fails to crack me up with, ""So he won't be needing any more flies."" I cannot comment on this three D version as I have never seen it. I have the cheapo Hollywood classics version which is washed out but at such a cheap price hard not to scoop up. I saw the remake musical with Steve Martin and I walked out in the middle of it. No one can redue a masterpiece but this film definately needs an excellent copy released.

3498447,5,B001BSBBGM,"As every film buff knows, this is the schlock horror movie that later became the hit Broadway musical of the same name.  Like the musical, this was never intended to be a scare -- it  was done tongue-in-cheek and is really a spoof .
I had heard of this movie, but did not see it until after viewing the musical.  What surprised me was the amazing amount of  Jewish humor  in the original.  Mr. Mushnik, the flower shop owner,  speaks with a decidely Yiddish accent, and is constantly making puns like ""Aloha -- OY!""  Then there's Mrs. Shivah (her name refers to a Jewish  funeral custom), who is always buying flowers for some relative who died.  Never mind that traditional Jewish funerals don't use flowers -- it's a good gag.  So is Seymour's hypochodriac mother, who is the exact opposite of the usual Jewish Mother -- she DOESN'T want Seymour to get married, but if he does, he should at least get a girl with a really serious disease, not this healthy Audrey he brings home.  The dinner at Mom's is hilarious -- everything she serves is some sort of home remedy.  Cough syrup liquers, cod liver oil soup....  kosher, but YECCCCH!!!!
All of this gets lost in the musical rewrite, which went from Yiddish theater mode to Motown.  That was funny, too -- but if you are into collecting old Jewish humor, then the original ""Little Shop"" should definitely be on your shelf.  I give it five stars, not because it's a great cinematic acomplishment (it's not!) but because I see it as  a part of Jewish-American cultural history.  And besides, it's funny!",1071619200,,1552,4.602189781021898
3498448,4,B001BSBBGM,"I didn't realize there were other versions of ""Little Shop of Horrors.""  This one is kind of creepy if your looking for the Rick Moranis version.  This is an interesting movie to watch.
I actually found myself drawn to the TV, because unlike the funny movie, this one have the 'old school' king of twists that make it confusing.
It also has some of the same things (the dentist being fed to Audrey).  You should just watch this movie, because it's not what you think it is.",1069891200,,473,4.413793103448276
3498449,4,B001BSBBGM,"This is the original that started it all, in 1960 which the film was shot for only two days. It's an good film, with a lot of grainy feel to it in black and white.
  This version is about the bumbling Seymour who was almost out the door by his boss, Mr. Mushnick, for his incompetence. Seymour finds an unusual plant and Mushnick told Seymour if the plant turns out to be ok and fed, Seymour gets to stay at his job. Seymour names this plant, Audrey Jr., after his coworker, Audrey, who he loves. Before long, Seymour finds out that this plants wants nothing other than blood and human flesh...and ends up bringing dead people to the plant that were accidently killed. The cops were trying to find out what happened to the missing people (they were already eaten by the plant), and Mr. Mushnick stumbled on Seymour's secret. Mr. Mushnick offered a robber in the shop to the plant to save his life. The cops find out that Seymour is the one who killed the people when the pods of the plant opened up, showing the faces of those that were eaten, and there was a junkyard chase after Seymour. When Seymour goes back to the shop, he was mad at the plant, and intending to cut the weeds to kill it, he jumped in and the plant ate him.  When the others came back to the shop, they found Seymour's face in one of the pods, then the movie ends.
  There are some funny parts, and some silliness in other scenes (like the tramp that Seymour ran into, and their conversation is humorous!), plus you can find a young Jack Nicholson as the pain-loving dental patient.
  This movie reminds me a little bit of the 1920s or 1930s films by the way some of the acting and the grainy image has portrayed in this 1960 movie, but overall, it is a good movie to watch.",1053388800,,1746,4.304878048780488
3498450,2,B001BSBBGM,"If you've never seen Little Shop but love humor on the edge, this is more than worth the money (though I bought the same copy from another source for a dollar less).
But, if you love film, this copy is abysmal, not even close to Corman's original. There's dirt on the film, contrast is limited (though the movie is watchable) and detail is definitely compromised. It's recorded in VHS EP mode.
Corman made some great films, this title is arguably the best of its genre, and I hate to think that the original may be lost or missing, and this is all we have left.
It may have been shot in two days, but it was excellent B/W not so long ago.",1048291200,,638,4.237704918032787
3498451,4,B001BSBBGM,"Unfortunately, Little Shop of Horrors and every other Roger Corman Filmgroup production lapsed into public domain years ago and have generally been available on VHS and DVD only in poor-quality editions ranging from merely bad to atrocious. (The only Filmgroup features to get a decent official or semi-official release so far are Bucket of Blood, Beast from Haunted Cave, and Night Tide.) After researching every DVD version of Little Shop of Horrors available (there are at least eight!) I played a hunch and went with GoodTimes to replace my VHS copy, and I'm very pleasantly surprised at the overall excellent quality of the source print. When I saw the ""preserved using the best available elements"" line at the beginning of this disc I thought 'yeah, right,' but I have to admit that this is the brightest, cleanest, sharpest (if not exactly razor-sharp) print of this film I've ever seen. The black level, contrast, gray values, and shadow/highlight detail are fine, and physical damage is limited only to some very light speckling and blemishing (!!). On the downside, the transfer itself seems to be somehow deficient (low bit rate?), causing areas of flat white or smoothly gradated grays in the image to exhibit some very faint but noticeable pixelation or banding, especially during the opening credit sequence (areas of flat color seem to be DVD's Achilles Heel). The casual viewer probably won't notice this phenomenon unless it's pointed out, but it's there. That said, the superior quality of the source print more than makes up for this one barely noticeable flaw; this is still most likely the best edition yet available of this classic 'sick humor' gem and well worth the bargain price. It definitely blows away every TV print and cheapjack PD video version I've ever eyeballed. Grab this before it goes out of print.
The movie itself still entertains tremendously today, a funny, goofy (dare I say charming?) horror-comedy that basically plays like a stage farce (most of the action takes place on one or two sets). The story is essentially a remake of Bucket of Blood with a change in locale and a few fresh twists. This time Jonathan Haze portrays everyschlep Seymour Krelboine, who lives with his alcoholic hypochondriac mother (she listens to KSIK radio) and works at Mushnick's skid row flower shop. Seymour (temporarily) finds fame, fortune, and romance by nurturing (and eventually murdering for) an exotic talking cannibalistic plant. Mel Welles, in his finest hour (literally), steals nearly every scene with his droll portrayal of perpetually exasperated Gravis Mushnick, and Jackie Joseph (Andy Griffith Show, Who's Minding the Mint) seems born to play pretty, ditzy Audrey. Corman regulars adding to the fun include Dick Miller (Walter Paisley in Bucket of Blood) as Fouch, a flower-eating client, John Shaner as a sadistic dentist, and 14th-billed Jack Nicholson (featured prominently on most tape and disc box art) as his masochistic patient. Shot on a shoestring in just three days (at least all the interiors), Little Shop holds up better than many big-budget comedies of the day (anyone watched Story of Mankind lately?). Much credit must be given to Charles B. Griffith, unsung hero/architect of the AIP/Allied Artists/Corman style. His list of credits reads like Corman's greatest hits: It Conquered the World, Attack of the Crab Monsters, The Undead, Not of This Earth, Teenage Doll, Bucket of Blood, Beast from Haunted Cave, Wild Angels, Death Race 2000, etc. Griffith's clever, witty screenplay is a model of late-50s sick humor, working in a dead-on Dragnet parody, some wonderful malapropisms and bits of wordplay, lotsa Yiddish humor, and a handful of his patented icky-creepy moments. (Griffith also voiced the plant, Audrey Jr., played a few walk-ons, and directed some second unit scenes, all uncredited.) Fred Katz's memorable score is alternately goofy and spy-jazzy, and, unlike some of Roger Corman's other attempts at comedy (e.g. Creature from the Haunted Sea), I find his touch just right here, ably supporting Griffith's verbal bits with complementary editing patterns (check Sgt. Joe Fink and Det. Frank Stoolie's hilarious introductory scene). Lighter in tone and a bit broader and more farcical than Bucket of Blood (which I personally prefer), Little Shop, judged on its own terms, is still fresh and engaging, though the low budget is obvious at times. I'm not sure how fans of the Broadway show or movie musical will react to the original (I admit to being a purist myself), but if they share a taste for low budget horror or 50s-style sick humor they'll probably find it an offbeat treat.",1026518400,,4650,5.127799736495389
3498452,4,B001BSBBGM,"Roger Corman's original LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is a classic cult B-movie that is full of classic one-liners and immortal performances.
Jonathan Haze is fantastic as the nervous Seymour, who grows the Venus Fly-Trap plant (whom he calls ""Audrey Junior"") and ends up supporting it's flesh-eating habit.  Jackie Joseph plays Seymour's long-suffering girlfriend Audrey, while Mel Welles plays Seymour's eternally-flabergasted employer Gravis Muschnick.
But it is Myrtle Vail, as Seymour's mother, that gives perhaps the most hilarious performance.  She is superb.  Newcomer Jack Nicholson (yes, THAT Jack Nicholson) is fantastic in one of his early roles as a pain-addicted dentist fanatic.

3498453,3,B001BSBBGM,"Roger Corman vented forth this weird and weirdly funny little movie that became a cult classic the minute it hit theatre screens in the 1960s.  The story, of course, has been made famous by the later New York musical and the film it spawned: an incompetent floral shop worker grows a plant so weird looking that it boosts business at his employer's skid-row shop; trouble is, the plant requires regular feeding, and its food of choice is whatever body part happens to be, er, handy!
Mel Welles, who plays Mushnick, is very entertaining, and Jack Nicholson makes his screen debut with a really wild performance as the masochistic dental patient, but for the most part the cast is no-name; likewise the production values are non-existant, and print quality is mediocre at best.  The script, however, is rather witty, taking swipes at everything from hypocondria to garden club ladies to television's DRAGNET.  The whole thing is extremely uneven, but that's part of the charm.  Some viewers will find the joke isn't as funny in execution as it is in concept, and the film tends to drag a bit toward the end, but cult film fans are sure to love it!",1025913600,,1145,4.738693467336684

It plays up it's campiness.  This film is known for being the movie shot in two days.  It's a wonderful example of low budget done not too badly.  Little Shop of Horrors is entertaining, and its a must-see if you're a fan of the amazing musical, since you get a sense of how the production evolved.

3498458,4,B001BSBBGM,"If you liked ""The Young Frankenstein"", you'll love Roger Corman's 1960 cult classic, ""Little Shop of Horrors"":
The film's about an incompetenet ""Dragnet"" cop duo of Sgt. Joe Fink and Frank Stoolie who investigate the mysterious Skid Row disappearances of a bum, dentist, thief and a ... [woman].  The perp is a plant with a buddingappetite for blood.  This tongue-in-cheek horror movie flowers with the performance of a young Jack Nicholson* (as the masochistic undertaker) while blooming with plot characters such as Gravis Mushnik, the greedy plant shop owner and Mrs. Shiva, whose relatives just keep on dying...
Mind you, this is a low-budget film, so the film quality of this B&W is not crisp.  In fact, Roger Corman only paid the actors a one-week salary, rehearsing them on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and then filming them on Thursday and Friday!  But these actors and Fred Katz's background music really score over any budgetary contraints!  As it turns out, this low budget film will later re-sprout as a 1980 Off-Broadway smash and then turn into the Academy Award winning 1986 musical film version.  (Personally, I feel the plot is better in Corman's original but the 1986 version has outstanding lyrics and special effects.)  So, if you like your horror films with an irreverent twist, then you'll be sure to enjoy this film.
See ""Bucket of Blood"" also by Charles Griffith and directed by Roger Corman; ""Little Shop of Horrors"" with Rick Moranis, Steve Martin and Bill Murray; and, Young Frankenstein with Gene Wilder and Madeline Kahn.

3498459,4,B001BSBBGM,"I recently watched the musical remake of Little Shop of Horrors and enjoyed it immensely, and my curiosity about the genesis of that film lead me to its progenitor.  I hadn't realised that Roger Corman's original was intended as a comedy--I'd thought that it was a cheapie horror film with camp humor arising from its unintended absurdity.  This is absolutely not the case, and I was very pleasantly surprised.  The absurdity of Little Shop, and there is plenty, is all fully intended.  At times it is almost as if the Monty Python troupe is doing a black-and-white horror spoof, it is so good.  I find it impossible to say whether the musical remake or the original is ""better""--they are simply different, and each amusing in its own way.  I prefered Rick Moranis's Seymour to that of Jonathan Haze, but Jackie Joseph's Audrey had funnier lines and was less pathetic than Ellen Greene's.  But what really surprised me was that the comic touches I had thought were signatures of the Saturday Night Live/Second City crowd were all in the original:  the sadistic dentist and his masochistic patient; ""Pain"" magazine, ""Feed me!"", and more.  Futhermore, the original had some more absurd characters that didn't make it into the remake, including a parody of the detectives from Dragnet and Seymour's mother, a hypochondriac whose home cooking is all flavoured with medicine!  Although the sound and picture quality of the version I watched was poor, it was worth sitting through if you enjoyed the more recent version.

8284545,3,B001BSBBGM,"RELEASED IN 1960 and directed by Roger Corman, Little Shop of Horrors stars Jonathan Haze as Seymour, a klutzy worker at a Los Angeles Skid Row florist shop. On the verge of getting fired by the owner (Mel Welles), the young man brings his weird hybrid plant to the store to spur business. Unbeknownst to Seymour, it requires flesh & blood to grow and live. Jackie Joseph plays the other worker at the shop and Seymours potential girlfriend. A very young Jack Nicholson appears as a patient at a dentist office for about 8 minutes.

Back when this was released Im sure the black humor was almost scandalous (e.g. Seymour feeding body parts to the ravenous plant), but Corman got away with it because its such an inane comedy. A lot of the humor didn't work for me and I personally don't like black & white. But there are enough amusing elements to make it worth checking out and Jackie possesses a winsome sweetness thats a pleasure to behold. Filmed in late December, 1959, the late 50s/early 60s ambiance is a highlight.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 12 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles. WRITER: Charles B. Griffith. ADDITIONAL CAST: Toby Michaels and Karyn Kupcinet are on hand as high school girls in need of flowers for a float.
