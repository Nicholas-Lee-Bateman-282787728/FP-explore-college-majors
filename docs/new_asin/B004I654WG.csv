4384018,5,B004I654WG,I can't express how good this movie is.  It kept me on the edge of my seat.  And it was so cool that each idea I had about what was going on was WRONG!  Very well done!,1327104000,5,168,3.4864864864864864
4384019,5,B004I654WG,"SOLITARY was a brilliantly original movie.  It was a refreshing ""welcome"" from the usual ""humdrum,"" venturing into uncharted territory.
  I pride myself in being able to figure out the mystery, be it book or movie, long before the secret is unveiled.
  I must humbly admit I only solved one small fraction of the puzzling mystery (which most veiwers will.)
  I am blown away by proxy because Amber Jaeger (Sara)is just as blown away when she learns of her state. Therefore, my amazement is through her, or by proxy.
  In my eyes, it demonstrates true creative writing when I haven't got a clue of a story's ending and am taken aback when I discover it. That is what SOLITARY pleasantly provided.
  Just when I thought I had ""solved"" its seemingly random sequence of events, the story would throw a curve ball into the equation. And over and over again. And again.
  Don't be fooled! It is not a frustrating story as true frustration goes nor does it lack in intrique despite its purposefully consistant bewilderment.  No, on the contrary, the plot is riveting as is the superb performances.
  I might mention: You won't want to pause for a bathroom break lest you interrupt the mental momentum even if for a second or two. (Besides, your mind won't ""allow"" it.)
  SOLITARY is a relatively quiet movie which makes it so unsettling when any sound is intentionally produced. The director artistically captured the mood beautifully. For instance, the sporatic knocking on the front door as the persistant rumble echoes across the interior hardwood entryway. The unexpectant knock never grows old, remaining unforeseeable most every time.
  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat-a tense one at that-and my mind constantly reeling without any let up. It was pleasantly exhausting.
  I will not ruin this with a ""spoiler alert."" You shouldn't be robbed of the entire process that leads to a gratifying finish.  But no matter how ingellient you are,I will bet money you will never, in a million years, figure it out to its fullest extant. That is the beauty of this film aside from the fact the plot is phenominal. (Suggestion: Pay attention to every sound, word, and action no matter how insigficant. It will serve as a convoluted puzzle in progress.)
  I watched this movie late at night. If you're the sensitive type,as am I, be prepared for a sleepless night. My temporary insomnia wasn't helped with the knowledge that it was to be my birthday in a matter of days and my husband and I were going to celebrate in Northern CA.  You will understand why.
  Needless to say, I found Amber Jaeger's (Sara) endearing to say the least. You can't help but root for her, trusting only in her despite her evident unreliable (borderline bizzare) behavior and faulty memory. By design, the veiwer is left in the dark as much as Sara is. (She desperately wants answers,too!)
  If I had to judge SOLITARY on a scale of one to ten (ten being the best) I would give it a twenty.
  No, that wasn't a typo!
  I am most appreciative,

4384020,5,B004I654WG,"This movie tells a great story; about a woman who has a fear of leaving her home, which makes it increasingly difficult for her to find out what has happened to her husband.  Besides that, it seems she can't trust family to help her.  Solitary has suspense and mystery with a surprise ending that catches the viewer off guard.  Ms. Jaeger (Sarah) does an excellent job in drawing the viewer into her world and feeling the anxiety and difficulty the character faces.  This is one movie that definitely kept my attention throughout.",1304121600,2,530,4.728260869565218
4384021,5,B004I654WG,"Great movie!  The suspense was nail biting.  The acting was superb, writing phenomenal and overall production value exceeded my expectations.  A must see!",1303862400,2,154,5.608695652173913

4384023,4,B004I654WG,"I thought it was pretty interesting for Prime. Might give it three stars in the real world ... See what I did there? I see a lot of mixed reviews, but I thought the lead actress did a fine job.",1517356800,3,193,3.85
4384024,3,B004I654WG,"It was ok, not the worst movie. 100x better than mother! I felt like I was wasting my time, at least it wasn't mother. The lead actress was a bit too acting school over dramatic at times, but that could have been the directing.",1517356800,,227,4.181818181818182
4384025,5,B004I654WG,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It certainly didn't go the way I thought it was headed.,1517184000,2,89,4.5625
4384026,2,B004I654WG,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. On the one hand its very good with its twists and turns, or so the viewer might think. On the other hand, is everything really the way it seems. The ending was not as I expected and still has me thinking about the psychological aspect of several things pertaining to mental conditions versus what is real. Confusion of a movie but I stayed with it. If I'd known the ending played out as it did, I would have skipped it.",1517097600,,459,4.287356321839081
4384027,5,B004I654WG,This was a Great movie.  Stirring and completely unexpected ending.  Definitely recommend.,1517097600,,90,6.416666666666667

4384031,2,B004I654WG,"Pretty mixed up bag of theories, or treatments; not sure what this was suppose to depict.  It would have been so much better without the Dr's crazy antics and just let the whole thing be a coma dream or a trauma the patient couldn't accept until coming out of the shock.  Not well done at all; like the phone lines supposedly being cut the inheritance, etc. ridiculous.",1516665600,,369,4.492537313432836
4384032,5,B004I654WG,A movie for the thinking person. The acting is first rate and it keeps you guessing - like a modern Hitchcock film. Wish there were more quality indie films like this. Not to be missed.,1516579200,2,185,4.314285714285714
4384033,2,B004I654WG,"Line of thought of a Prime member (end of review has a spoiler with alert):

""Hmmm...mysterious...psychological thriller? interesting.....she's a cutie, too bad she's in this movie...
oh geez, oh for the love of god....oh geez c'mon now.... [SPOILER ALERT, stop here]....
where the heck did this commentary on the consciousness of comatose patients get in here?!...wtf I feel so unfulfilled.
Maybe me watching this is actually a bad dream.""

Most movies should stick to being either a psychological thriller like ""Gone Girl"" or a consciousness/coma/dream story like  ""The Fountain"" or ""Inception""; pulling off combos of the two like ""The Lovely Bones"" requires a whole other bag of tricks.  This one didn't do the former, which was the smarter choice for the final result; and it was way off for the latter.",1516320000,,807,5.137404580152672

4384035,5,B004I654WG,"This is probably a movie that you will either love or hate.  I'm not going to describe much of the film so as not to spoil any parts of it.  The story line had my mind going in many directions, but not in a bad way.  I predominantly watch and love mysteries and psychological thrillers.  This is one of the best I've ever seen...with just a tiny drop of scifi and spirituality added at the end.  This is the type of film that you'd really want to rewatch and talk over with your best friends.  The symbolism is HUGE, and you really won't realize it until the very end.  Every sound, person, room, door, house accessory is a symbol.  As other reviewers have said, ""nothing is what it seems.""  Despite the many twists in the film, in the final scene you will realize a common thread that has really run throughout the story.  The writing, directing, and acting was very good.  And, after you watch to its entirety, you will agree that the title of Solitary is quite befitting.",1516233600,,974,4.385474860335195
4384036,4,B004I654WG,Very good move about the subconscious and trickery of the mind. Had a real Brilliant Mind and Shutter Island feel to it. Worth a watch.,1515974400,,135,4.44
4384037,2,B004I654WG,"Bored most of the time, lost throughout the movie, poor acting. and then finally the ending that leaves much to be desired.  Not worth the time spent watching it.",1515801600,2,162,4.586206896551724
4384038,1,B004I654WG,"It feels that a group of high school students made this movie. Poor story, poor acts and total nonsense.",1515628800,,104,4.526315789473684
4384039,4,B004I654WG,"The story was great. I thought some of the acting was bad, but once you get to the end of the movie, you'll understand that it's not that at all. It's so much more.",1515542400,,164,3.8529411764705883
4384040,5,B004I654WG,"I have to confess that I see the beginnings of movies a lot more than endings.  I get bored easily especially when a movie is too predictable.  I decided to try this one day when I was home sick and was pleasantly surprised.  Yes, at one point I almost turned it off when I knew where it was going.  I stuck with it however and the thing is...  I actually had no idea where it was going.  I had it all wrong.

It is difficult to say too much without spoilers but I will say not to go by the one-line description of the movie.  That is just part of the story... scratching the surface.

The ending may leave you scratching your head and asking how this is possible.  Hey, it's fiction.  Don't over analyze it.  Just go with it and appreciate the twist.  Then think back to the subtle clues that all was not as it seemed.",1515456000,3,819,4.1075949367088604

4384042,2,B004I654WG,"Also found under the title Memory of Lies in some DVD region editions, Solitary is a slow paced confusing mess of a movie, about a woman who has a phobia that physically prevents her from leaving her house.  Her husband disappears one morning and she comes across intruders from time to time in her home, which she has called the police about, as soon as they asked to see what's behind a locked door, she carries on about them needing a warrant, they aren't that helpful after that and suspect her in being involved in her husband's disappearance if he has disappeared at all.  The phone line has been cut and things like this which make her feel more helpless and isolated.  Her sister occassionally visits and insists she see a psychiatrist she works with who she doesn't trust and doesn't seem to believe her version of events, if anything has happened he keeps raising the possibility she may have dreamt/imagined it.

The ending tells us what's going on, it's not like you wouldn't have worked out something like that was going on early in the film, but the ending fails to explain how what has gone on is possible. Spoilers - We're never explained how this technology is possible for a doctor to appear in someone in a coma's mind and interact with them, have them decide on a question and so on.  Basically the overall premise is like Total Recall, but we don't have Schwarzenegger or any three breasted women in this one.",1509753600,2,1430,4.592156862745098

4384044,5,B004I654WG,"I found this film gripping.  It had my rapt attention from beginning to end.  What I don't get is how this amazing actress, Amber Jaeger, has been in so few films.  I loved her in Take Me Home.  Bought the DVD of Solitary to see her again and again an amazing performance.  I'm wondering why Solitary isn't available to Amazon Prime members. It would expose them to Amber's work and maybe create buzz resulting in her getting more roles.  I can't figure out how an actress can be so good, and yet not be in more films.",1469145600,2,518,4.288659793814433
4384045,5,B004I654WG,"As someone who suffers from Agoraphobia I found this movie interesting. If you know someone who suffers from Agoraphobia but can't totally relate, this movie, in some ways, may help you understand what one goes through emotionally and physically, although its not typical, as this movie is more of a Psychological Thriller.

This is a good add to my movie collection.",1419120000,2,367,5.016393442622951
4384046,5,B004I654WG,"Very Hitchcockian!  I was riveted throughout the movie, but also very uneasy.  It is brilliantly acted, beautifully filmed, and deeply suspensful.

4384048,5,B004I654WG,"It did not seem like a high budget movie but that actually seemed to help.
I was pulled into the story right away. It was a suspenseful mystery, and kind of creepy.
The story kept developing into other psychological modes and was intriguing and awesome all the way to the end. I will not spoil it!
I highly recommend.",1409270400,,317,4.389830508474576
4384049,4,B004I654WG,"The formula has been used before but here it throws a few original ideas in.

4384050,3,B004I654WG,"I like ""rubber reality"" type movies. They usually give you a lot to wrap your head around, and it's fun to see how the pieces come together. This was not so much fun.

Here's the scoop. Sara has a wedding anniversary coming up and her hubby is taking her on a weekend vacation. But some bad things happen. Hubby goes missing. She becomes agoraphobic, and that's just a bit of it. Has hubby really disappeared? Is her shrink really a shrink? What about these strange police detectives?

This is a difficult movie to review without revealing spoilers. But let it be said that it begins one way, in that you start with a mystery and a mental illness. Then it begins to lead the viewer down an entirely different path where a conspiracy might be involved. Then in the last 15 minutes you get a punchline that is out of left field. As much as I liked most of it, when I realized what was happening at the end I felt cheated.

The performances were decent enough though I thought they turned the creep dial up a bit high on the shrink. It was directed well enough given that essentially everything happens in the house. There were no other sets to rely on. The music and sound design were good. To me, this failed at the script level. I think a better handling of this subject would be the movie ""Stay."" These are not dissimilar stories, and even though ""Stay"" sported a better cast and deeper pockets, it was a much better script.

This isn't a bad movie. It just isn't that good.",1331510400,2,1475,4.391941391941392
4384051,5,B004I654WG,"An icy cold Sunday afternoon led me to search for a film that I could sink my teeth into.  The enclosed explanation of this film was enticing, though later I would understand why it was also vague.  I was immediately drawn in by the isolation and apparent lonliness of this woman.  I wanted to figure her out.  Every step was a surprise for me, and as soon as I thought I got it, it became only to clear that what ever I was thinking along the way would be too simplistic.  The constant knocking on her door, always seemed unfinished to me, like grasping for some illusion of something.  Eventually, I understood why.  Beautifully directed, and acted, I am still haunted by the exquisit story.  The ending was a surprise, and I found myself in a puddle of tears.  My heart felt at once broken, and at ease.

I do not want to say too much to spoil the surprisingly magnificent ending, but let's just say it's worthwhile and leave it at that. This movie examines in depth some of our deepest fears, being trapped, not knowing whom to trust if anyone. Not knowing what is real and what is a subconscious fantasy, not being able to trust ourselves, our own thinking. I'm going to watch this one again.",1517443200,,699,4.426356589147287
