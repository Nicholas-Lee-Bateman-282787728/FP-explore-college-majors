The episode titled ""Life"" is the funniest show from the series (It's from Season 2).  Tim, Eric and John are the best for doing this show and brining it to DVD for us fans.  Pick this up if you are ready for many laugh out loud moments and multiple viewings....For your health!

Season 3 and 4 are not available yet but it's as funny and a little darker!  Awesome job guys!

4286514,5,B0048LPRDC,Priceless. I never laughed so hard. This helped my anxiety and depression more than almost anything along with other Tim and Eric shows. It really made me shake my head and laugh and realize that I'm in my own world too much and need to get out of it. I have severe depression with anxiety and this has an effect like the best drugs but the only difference is as a lasting effect and you know you can come back to it and it won't ever hurt you or mistreat you. I think some things can seem really silly but the older I get the more I realize these guys can help heal I know how silly it sounds but I guess it really worked for me and I just needed to say it.,1496707200,10,658,3.917910447761194

No, I'm not talking about the ""graphics"" that clearly mock 80's Public Access Shows (reminds me of Wild Chicago and what-not, it's one of the biggest draws of this show for me), on a general level there's heavy pixels and lines in the video.

4286824,5,B0048LPRDC,"""One small mankind, I'm gonna leap the heck out of this moon rocket."" That's a quote by Kneel Aurmstrang, one of the many hunks quoted by Dr. Steve Brule on his always informative public-access TV program. This is one weird show. I've never seen anything like it. It is jam-packed full of odd-looking characters with names like Terry Bruge Hiplo and Doug Prishpreed. Not that names matter much to Dr. Brule, who has a tendency to mispronounce everyone's name in a similar manner. ""Drangus,"" ""Brungus,"" ""Drangle,"" etc. He also really likes the letter R, adding it to words like drumpsters, pruppets, prizza, bringo, crasinos and broats.
Aside from the just-too-weird-for-me scenes with the Channel 5 married news team, Check It Out is pretty consistently hilarious. And for some reason it actually gets funnier upon subsequent viewings. It is infectiously quotable, as you can see from the other reviews on this site. Everyone seems to have their favorite lines. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes absurdist humor.

For anyone not in the know like I was, this is all new content. It's its own show. These are not the collected segments from Awesome Show, which is what I thought I was getting. It gets 4 stars because Reilly's character goes just a little too overboard. Some of the acting just breaks down into Reilly having a stroke for too long. Is that possible? Did I watch all cinco seasons of Awesome Show? Yes, and Billion Dollar Movie. Reilly just kinda runs it into the ground in certain segments.

The character is basically a complete moron that claims to be a doctor.  He constantly pronounces words incorrectly and gets facts wrong. He is a hysterical character and i have almost pissed my pants on more than one occasion while watching Dr. Steve.

4286909,5,B0048LPRDC,"""Check It Out"" with Dr. Steve Brule manages to transport you into its own world. As you watch you get sucked deeper and deeper into this alternate bizarro television reality. John C. Reilly is completely possessed by this character and whatever is real (if anything) and whatever is staged becomes less and less important. One of the charming things about this series is the viewer's complete inability to discern what parts may have included people who had no idea what they were going to be a part of. Dr. Brule takes on a life of his own and transcends the actor playing him. This is a credit to Reilly's masterfull acting and ability to sell the whole thing. I have watched this series and it still makes me laugh out loud, feel uncomfortable (in the way good comedy should from time to time) and find nuances I hadn't caught before. After one watch you'll be quoting your favorite Brulisms. (Having prizza for dinner?)

The DVD itself is well done, complete with some deleted scenes, alternate takes and extended segments. The only downside is you want more.

Many of the characters and guests on the show are also a bit odd and add to the show's success (you'll recognize several of them from Tim & Eric). They are so believable you find yourself asking if they are really actors or even told it's not a real show. I wonder how much of the show is scripted and if any of it is improv.

4286926,5,B0048LPRDC,"Check It Out! With Dr. Steve Brule is a spinoff series of Channel Five Married News Team segments from both Tom Goes To The Mayor and Tim & Eric Awesome Show Great Job! that stars the bumbling physician Steven Brule in an early morning program showcasing things that he himself & hopefully the viewer want to find out about such as Relationships, Puppets, Food, etc. Think of it in the aspect of the those tapes that Mr. McFeely would show Mr. Rogers on occasion.

The characterization of Brule as socially incompetent and ignorant man is BRILLIANTLY pulled off by veteran comedian actor, John C. Riley. One can't help but find humor in his genuine sincerity regarding the topics of choice and the people he interviews. He's like a little kid in a huge candy store that we call life and he just wants a heaping helping of whatever the heck god has in stock.

While I may not personally care for Tim & Eric's other works, they somehow got it right with Check It Out!, probably because John C. Riley has far more input on it",1355702400,,1022,4.489247311827957
