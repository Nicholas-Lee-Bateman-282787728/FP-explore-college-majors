6622264,5,B00NARLPEK,"Another superb volume of 16 episodes, carries Gunsmoke past the 400 episode mark, meaning we are about 2/3 of the way through the series (409 episodes of 635 filmed) remastered on DVD. 1965-66 was the transitional season, where 40% of prime time was broadcast in color. By the following season, 100% of prime time was color, with all daytime soap operas and game shows having changed to color by 1967, news and talk by 1968, and NET (the predecessor of PBS), by 1969. Some fantastic episodes in this volume include, Sanctuary, where a bank robber takes refuge in a church, and The Treasures Of John Walking Fox, featuring Leonard Nimoy (after he had filmed 2 Star Trek pilots) as an indian preying upon his friend's killer's greed. Season 11 is the final season of more than 30 episodes; season 12 had 29, and for much of it's color run, 24 episodes per season was the standard. CBS, please begin putting out full season sets, now that there are fewer episodes, akin to your full season sets of Hawaii 5-0, Mannix, and Mission Impossible, and speed up the pace, as none of us are getting any younger!",1418083200,7,1100,4.61734693877551

This half-season, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values.",1465084800,,320,5.530612244897959

6622317,5,B00NARLPEK,"Gunsmoke is as much part of our history and culture as baseball and apple pie. There have been certain phenomenons like Elvis, The Beatles that are or should be immortal. Gunsmoke both as the longest running prime time TV series is a reminder of a time in the mid twentieth century when the adult western ruled. There were many good westerns but Gunsmoke is a giant among giants and this volume is at present the latest release. It's well done and not only does it bring back memories but still stands as first class drama without violence and gore. It's filled with human stories, virtually all good and some that stand as powerful drama that transcends the genre.

I'm now 70 and afraid I might not live to see the release of all seasons. I think CBS should release all seasons in color at once. Season 12 is the season that was the 1st season broadcast in color which would continue until the last broadcast. I own every episode that has been released of Gunsmoke and I believe the people behind the releases would be surprised how strong the sales will be for the color releases. I believe that the episode with the great Bette Davis would be on volume I of season 12. I believe the 3rd episode. Go ahead and release complete seasons and do it before the age group most interested pass away. Here's a great idea. Release a specially discounted boxed set of the 1st 11 seasons for those who have hesitated on taking the plunge and release the color set individually as well as in a special boxed set entitled something like, GUNSMOKE: The Complete Color Seasons (11-20).",1463097600,4,1573,4.5583038869257955

6622322,5,B00NARLPEK,"I love a lot of the tv westerns that my dad loved and grew up on. I was born in 1966, so I wasn't born when the majority of them started. I still grew up on them and a few that I discovered, thanks to when they were released on DVD. Gunsmoke is my all-time time favorite. To see Matt Dillon, Kitty, Chester, Doc Adams, Festus, etc... on screen was breathtaking to me and I just fell in love with the show, from the very first episode. Other westerns like, Cheyenne (Which is my second favorite

Western, Starring Clint Walker), Wanted: Dead or Alive (Steve McQueen), The Texan (Rory Calhoun), etc... I really love watching on DVD since I have the complete seasons and like Gunsmoke, I never tire of watching.

Season 11 is another great and legendary season, with many guest stars, like seasons past. I bought Season 11, awhile back already. I did want to share some potentially great news for all of the Gunsmoke fans who are wondering when Season 12 will be released on DVD, especially the fans who grew up when they were originally on the air. I saw on a website that looked quite legit, said that the last Gunsmoke movie that aired in 1994, with the legend himself James Arness, who brought Marshal Matt Dillon to life, will be released, but no release date hasn't been set, but it's in the works and sounds like it will be in the near future. It also said Paramount is currently working on Season 12 and it should be released by the end of this year. So, it sounds like we just have to wait a little longer. It will be worth the wait. I wanted to share that news with the fans, wherever you live on what I found out tonight. Bring it on... Finally!?! Sounds promising...",1461110400,,1675,4.365384615384615

James Arness was the reason for that. It is just too bad his fellow actors never saw fit to award him with an Emmy because he surely deserved it. I have 12 seasons & look forward to more.

6622368,5,B00NARLPEK,"Gunsmoke ran for 20 seasons, the first 11 in black & white. Seasons 12 through 20 are still not released, I hope it's because CBS is fixing up the color on them.

While Gunsmoke is great (one of the greatest, if not THE greatest show ever), CBS deserves some scorn for dividing each season in half for DVD release. There is no reason each season can't be complete in one volume, rather than two halves. It would save CBS money since less packaging would be required, and that cost saving would presumably be passed down to us.

Regardless, the sound and video quality of these releases is stellar, and if you enjoy Gunsmoke, you will enjoy these official sets much more than the bootleg sets out there which were recorded over the air and have very poor video and audio quality. There aren't a ton of extras, but that's not CBS' fault, all the main actors have moved on to the afterlife.",1427846400,21,887,4.469135802469136
6622369,5,B00NARLPEK,"Gunsmoke is a real TV Western classic!  Season 11 is sure to not disappoint as the last season of the TV series filmed in black-and-white.  However, the price is a bit out of my ""comfort zone.""  Ever since, the studios decided to cash in on the consumer by ""double-dipping"" on a season through splitting them in two and charging the same price for a half-season that they used to charge for an entire season, I discriminate more on pricing.  Amazon is a little slow lowering their price on this Season 11 (Vols. 1 & 2).  Word to all other discriminating shoppers:  Each volume (1 or 2) of Gunsmoke: Season 11 was at a low of $19.96 (at Walmart) back on 3/31/15 before coming back up to what it is now (~$26).  Amazon has had this as low as $21.59.  Personally, I can't see paying over $20 per volume.  I've held out on other seasons of Gunsmoke and got most if not all of them below $20.

His son, embittered by the hard years after Elam deserted his family to go back to gunfighting, is determined to kill him.  Elams performance when they meet in Dodge is incredible.  Although Ive watched it several times and know how the story goes, I enjoy watching it over again simply because the acting is so great!  This is the magic of Gunsmokealways quality acting and scripts.  It just doesnt get much better.",1504656000,,530,4.844444444444444
