If you're going to buy one or the other, then you might as well buy this set.  It's a better deal, because you are getting two workouts for the price of one.  Unfortunately, neither DVD is that good.  I've posted more thorough reviews on each individual product pages, but here is an overall summary of each:

Urban Heat: Gloria (the instructor) tries too hard to have swag that she becomes a bit too cheesy.  The moves are cool and authentic, though.  The production is terrible with the music being uninspiring and the camera work lousy.  As a workout, it's broken down so much that only an absolute beginner will get a workout.

Urban Beat: Gloria is better as an instructor while the dance moves are a little more cheesy.  The production is still horrible in all aspects.  The music is even worse.  Any workout is nonexistent since one section will be broken down like the sister DVD with the next section throwing complicated moves at you with no explanation at all.  You go from not breaking a sweat because the moves are so slow to not breaking a sweat because you can't do the extremely complex cardio dance.

I don't recommend these DVDs, but they aren't the worst workouts I've ever done.  If you insist on getting one of them, then just go ahead and buy this set.  I find them to be badly taught, disjointed, and overall bad.  There are better hip hop workouts on the market, and because of that, I would say to give this set a pass.",1341273600,,1869,5.594306049822064
8118371,3,B000F6ZPJU,"The dances are all right, but it is very hybrid.  (Latin and Carribean) Not a lot of tru hip hop. It's would be difficult to follow for a non dancer. The videography is not conducive to learning the elements. It pans on dancers faces or torsos when it should be on the steps being demonstrated. For the price it's a good deal.  If you really want to start learning hip hop get the Madonna Grimes dvds.",1273536000,,401,4.2631578947368425
8118372,5,B000F6ZPJU,"the name speaks for itself. This instructional DVD really is True to Form. If you really want to know what hip hop is all about then this is the way to do it...by watching and practice. Just make sure to keep up with her lead because as she goes through the moves, you must keep your feet moving at all times with each and every step. After she breaks the moves down a bit easier, she goes through a routine from the top. This is great for those who really want to tone those muscles and start to sweat.",1232323200,,503,4.090909090909091
8118373,2,B000F6ZPJU,"In my opinion, this DVD is ok if you know nothing about hip hop. I come froma hip hop background, and I htought this would be a fun way to work out. Unfortunately, I don't know what kind of dance this woman is doing, but its not true hip hop.",1186272000,,242,3.86
