8731870,1,1886653534,"I thought that I might show this to my Peace and Religion class and place it in conversation with Diana Eck's work, but not after watching it.  I don't even know where to begin it's that poor.  First, his ""argument"" is largely a straw man.  He focuses exclusively on the claim that all religions are simultaneously true.  There aren't many people if any who work in religious pluralism who claim this.  Diana Eck, for instance, director of the Pluralism Project at Harvard and internationally recognized scholar of religion, does not claim this.  In fact, she says that all religions strive for the truth but only have access to a small part of that larger truth.  This brings to mind his misunderstanding of John Hick's analogy with the elephant and the blind man.  He focuses on the limitations of each man's view and misses the larger point that the whole elephant is THERE.  It's not that each man's view is true or that they are all simultaneously true (whatever this means) but that no one man has exclusive access to the TRUTH.  This is also Eck's position. Furthermore, religion is reduced, despite his ""argument"" against reductionism, to the exoteric, the outward forms and formulations of any religious tradition.  In this sense, religion is no different than any other aspect of culture. He does not appear to acknowledge what the perennialist tradition in religion has to say about the esoteric dimension of religion.  He should read Frithjof Schuon's The Transcendental Unity of Religions.  Lastly, although there are WAY MORE PROBLEMS with what he says in this video, he points out the ""problem"" with other religions, most conspicuously Islam, Judaism and Buddhism and then throws in several others, but does not subject his own beliefs in Christianity to the same problem hunting ""method"". In short, if I had shown this in class, I would have to spend two class periods dismantling his every claim.  Waste of time given that there are so many other reputable sources from which to draw.",1486166400,,2001,4.899109792284866
