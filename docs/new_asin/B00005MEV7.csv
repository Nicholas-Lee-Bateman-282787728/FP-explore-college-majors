1624581,5,B00005MEV7,"Martin Sheen plays an excellent John Kennedy in the 1983 mini-series, Kennedy. he's got the voice of John Kennedy down almost to perfection.
the DVD version is great. you get additional footage such as JFK's Inaugural Address, One Day in Berlin, One Week in October, and The Last Two Days.
throughout the mini-series you see the tension between Hoover and both Jack and Bobby, you go along on the campaign trail with JFK, right up until the shots are fired in Dallas.
good mini-series.
i surley enjoyed watching all of it.",1035590400,21,522,4.747252747252747
1624582,4,B00005MEV7,"It's wonderful to have this five-hour mini-series complete and on DVD.  Prior to this release, a VHS version of the program (squeezed onto one tape) edited out at least half an hour of the show.  This presentation is a two-disc release that has parts one and two on disc one and part three and the 75 or so minutes of documentary footage on disc two.  The mini-series itself is very well done and surprisingly poignant considering it was first broadcast in 1983.  Martin Sheen's accent, while at first startling and seemingly exaggerated, is actually brilliant and spot-on 99% of the time.  He is the best ""John F. Kennedy"" I have ever seen portrayed, hands down.
My only complaint (and this might be isolated to my own Sony DVD player) is that the picture occasionally slows and then speeds up.  This is not like a dual-layer pause but an actual slowing of the film and then a burst of speed to ""catch up.""  It is only slightly irritating and does not warrant you not purchasing it, since it is only a minor problem.  Overall, I was quite surprised to see the film and audio to be as crisp and vibrant as it appears.  I can't help but guess that this DVD is a great deal better than having watched the original broadcast in 1983.  And yes, it is expensive...but you are getting over six hours of material.",1010966400,3,1306,4.495762711864407
1624583,5,B00005MEV7,"This 2-Disc DVD set is outstanding. I recall seeing this mini-series when it originally aired in November 1983, exactly 20 years after JFK's tragic assassination. It's now great to have it available on DVD.

All the major elements that made up the presidency of John F. Kennedy are explored very nicely during this five-hour program, including the Bay Of Pigs invasion of April 1961 and the ultra-frightening Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962.

""Kennedy"" star Martin Sheen, who portrays President Kennedy here,  is certainly no stranger to playing Kennedys. Prior to this 1983 TV mini-series, Martin was cast as Attorney General Robert Kennedy in the 1974 telefilm, ""The Missiles Of October"" (opposite William Devane's portrayal of JFK).

In another ""Kennedy connection"", Sheen played Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach in the 2003 film, ""The Commission"", which explores The Warren Commission's examination into President Kennedy's 1963 assassination.

Mr. Sheen is probably now best-known for playing fictional ""President Bartlet"" on the NBC-TV drama, ""The West Wing"".

A major reason I purchased this DVD product was for the extra features included on Disc 2. Here, we get to see the real JFK in action, in a series of documentaries and historic film footage. These extras total 75 minutes, making this 2-Disc package a completely absorbing and satisfying experience for anyone who wants to look back into history at one of the most popular men ever to occupy The White House.

The four bonus programs on the second disc of this set are:

>> JFK's Inaugural Address to the nation (January 1961).

>> ""One Week In October"" -- A half-hour film produced in 1964 by the Department Of Defense about the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Lots of archival film footage detailing the events surrounding the Missile Crisis is included here. It's a good, concise overview of those terrifying days in October '62.

>> ""One Day In Berlin"" -- Excerpts of the speech JFK made at the Berlin Wall.

>> ""The Last Two Days"" -- A 19-minute color film chronicling the last two days of President Kennedy's life in November of 1963.",1005696000,12,2117,5.089595375722543
1624584,4,B00005MEV7,"This movie, first shown on NBC in Nov. '83 to coincide with the anniversary of of JFK's death, is a great tribute to the man, his times and his legacy.  Brilliantly portrayed by Martin Sheen, JFK comes to life on the small screen, and Blair Brown gives a great performance as First Lady Jackie. This DVD is the COMPLETE version of the 3 part miniseries that was originally aired on tv.
All in all,  GREAT release for the DVD format.  From Election Night to Assassination, the film tells the whole story of Kennedy's presidency.  Not to be missed!",1003017600,4,546,4.540816326530612
1624585,5,B00005MEV7,"I strongly urge you to begin your view of the DVD International release of ""Kennedy"" with Part 3 at the start of the second disc. Here we relivewhat we went through when Cuba was armed with missiles by the Soviet Union and Kennedy was reported to have done what he could to prevent a knee-jerk invasion of the island as some were advocating. It is simply chilling to have seen that sequence at this time in our country's history. (This is being written one month after Sept. 11, 2001.)
 This five-hour film appeared on NBC as a special in 1983. I cannot vouch for the absolute accuracy of the events reproduced here or certainly not for the characterizations. The private conversations are, of course, to be taken as historical fiction; but the acting is on such a high level that one can readily believe these very words were spoken at the times portrayed in the film.
 Martin Sheen makes a totally crdible ""Jack"" Kennedy, although he seems to be alone in his family for having that famous accent. He is hardly ever off-screen and has been directed to show the character, if not warts and all, at least as a human being trying to juggle several insurmountable problems (civil rights, Viet Nam, Cuba, and J. Edgar Hoover) all at once. His womanizing is reduced to a single female voice on a telephone; and Marilyn Monroe is mentioned only once in another context. His constant statements that he ""cannot"" remove Hoover from the FBI seem to imply many other skeletons in his closet, but this is interpretation.
 Hoover (Vincent Gardenia) is shown as a cross between Ming the Merciless and something out of ""Star Wars,"" totally obsessed as he is with gaining power of the country by having files on just about every one of consequence. His own perversions, explicit in future film recreations, are here only implied.

 The Bobby Kennedy of John Shea is your all-American that even Hoover cannot fault morally although the latter will keep insisting that Organized Crime does not exist in America. E.G. Marshall and Geraldine Fiztgerald make a fine Joseph and Rose Kennedy, both unable (like most parents) to see anything negative about their children or anything positive about any of their opponents.
 Blair Brown's Jackie in this script seems simply an airhead, more concerned with buying expensive gowns and redecorating a White House that will not hold her for more than 1000 days. Perhaps the real woman was like this; I do not know. But Brown does a marvelous job playing a vacuous fashion-plate whose popularity often exceeded that of her husband.

 The scenes of how Blacks and Freedom Riders were treated down south are nauseatingly graphic; and I plan never to watch that part of this video again. There MUST have been some citizens of those states who did not think or act in that barbaric way, but they are noticeably absent from these sequences.
 You will be interested in comparing the four special features with the film's versions of them: The Inaugural Address, One Day in Berlin, The Last Two Days (the Dallas trip), and One Week in October (the Missile Crisis). In the last case, the film handles the matter more satisfactorily.
 What is best about the film is its apparent objectivity. I did not see any halos around anyone's head; but the horns on the Soviet Ambassador and J. Edgar Hoover were fairly prominent. Superior viewing from DVDI.",1002931200,5,3359,4.795847750865052
1624586,4,B00005MEV7,"This is the way to view this mini-series.  It is really nice to have it on DVD, as it gives it to you in a compact package.  Parts One & Two are on the first DVD, with Part 3 and the bonus extras on on the second.  I only have one problem with the set, and that is the lack of subtitling in English or any foreign languages.
The mini-series covers the 1000 days of the Kennedy administration.  The omnipresence of J. Edgar Hoover gives it an air of mystery and intrigue.  It is very well cast and Martin Sheen makes a good president. (I honestly think Mr. Sheen has more Oval Office time than several of our real presidents.)
My other recommendations :  If you do not yet own the DVD of ""The Missiles of October"" - the TV version from the early 1970's with Martin Sheen as Robert Kennedy and William Devane as JFK, make it a double order.
But if you want to freak yourself out:  Get a copy of ""The Dead Zone"" from 1983.  If you are a fan of Martin Sheen, you may find yourself a little disturbed by his character of Greg Stillson - but you will probably let out a chuckle or two - especially if you are a fan of ""The West Wing.""",1002672000,3,1128,4.072398190045249

1624624,4,B00005MEV7,"I'd have given this 5 stars-a wonderful look at JFK-his life-his many loves,and of course his death. Starting at the beginning of his political career,this mini series recalls not just his career but his life,and how his choices affect others. Blair Brown shines as Jackie. Sheen is a magnificent and thoroughly believable Kennedy. The attention to detail-the homes the cars-taking those famous pictures of the family playing football-of the last ride through Dallas and bringing them to vivid life-is very very well done. So why 4 stars-Vincent Gardenia as Hoover-his strange facial expressions and speeches are just too weird. Yes Hoover was a creep-but I kept thinking I was in a hammer house of horror flick whenever he had a scene! I was sure he was about to turn into Dracula-or a werewolf! just really really out there weird. It was the only spoiler in a otherwise very well made series.

It's not as entertaining as ""The Kennedys"" mini-series, which I think is presented in a way intended to fascinate the viewer. In my opinion, this one doesn't necessarily get the viewer fascinated. Just a straight-style presentation like the kind to be seen in a college class or something. Maybe that's correlated with the fact that this production was made in the early 80's.

For some more interesting scenes, a slightly more intriguing variety of high-quality acting performances, and better opening music to fit the style of the story, I recommend ""The Kennedys"" mini-series.",1392076800,,647,5.10377358490566

1624636,3,B00005MEV7,"The five hour miniseries KENNEDY (UK/USA-1983) stars Martin Sheen as John F. Kennedy.

It opens on 11/22/63, with the first reports of a shooting in Dallas and how these news flashes affect various people. After the official word of JFK's death is given, there's a flashback to the 1960 election, and that's the story's actual starting point. By 45 minutes in and with John Kennedy in office a short while, FBI head J. Edgar Hoover (Vincent Gardenia) is introduced as a cartoonish furrow-browed anti-Kennedy family villain.

As history this miniseries clearly distorts and has a political axe to grind, yet at least Blair Brown looks and is terrific as wife Jackie.

Also with John Shea, who DOESN'T resemble brother Bobby, the zealous Atty. Gen'l, Geraldine Fitzgerald and E.G. Marshall as JFK's parents, Kevin Conroy, another poor choice as Ted Kennedy, and a minor role for Kelsey Grammar as Stephen Smith, JFK's brother-in-law.

One example of historic inaccuracy concerns would-be dynamite assassin Richard Paul Pavlick. This film gives his age as 36. Pavlik was actually 73 when he stalked the President-elect in Palm Bch., FL.. Perhaps such an old man wouldn't seem enough of a threat?

Most frustrating is the way the Civil Rights struggles of 1961 are handled. We see Freedom Riders beat bloody by gangs of white Alabama thugs. Martin Luther King rightly wants to know just what the Kennedy Administration will do to stop this violence against American citizens both black and white. As matters escalate, Atty. Gen'l. Bobby Kennedy angrily vows to send 400 Federal marshals into Alabama, 50 alone to protect Rev. King.

Rioters outside a church service presided over by Dr. King overturn a car and set it afire; they throw rocks through the church's stained glass windows. Everyone in the building are prisoners of a mob. During all this madness, King reaches RFK in Washington and he demands action. We see no resolution to this and nothing more of the Freedom Riders or 400 marshals. It's as if this lengthy section of the story never happened.

Seminal events in the thousand days of JFK's presidency are capsulized, also some family tragedies, plus we see J. Edgar's gleeful monitoring of an unnamed woman (Judith Exner), who supposedly consorts with both mobsters and the Commander in Chief.

He seemed ""standoffish"". I thought it was just a poor script. Just too ""talky"" about political decision making, etc.  At times it was just plain boring which is hard to do with a film about the Kennedys. I found myself fast forwarding through a lot of political talk sometimes to get to the point where something was actually happening.  The Greg Kinnear film is much better. They show a lot of what happened about the Bay of Pigs and the Missle Crisis without bogging down in too much boring talk. Both these situations come alive in the Kinnear film.

The head shot sequence was the most horrific, yet realistic scenes to be shown, as it depicted the horror that Mrs. Kennedy went through at that moment.  It changed how I thought of her and later in life, when I lost my husband in front of my own eyes, caused me to model myself after this nobel woman during his trip to the ER and ulitmate death.

Although I am not sure the series is true to the Kennedys' lives, I have to say that I was stunned at how the Presidency operated.  Naive' would be a good word for my state of consciousness regarding how the President runs the United States.  I thought most things were researched, well planned out, and implemented with as much forethought,intellience, and wisdom as possible. Instead, I discover Jack and Bobby riding on the seat of their pants constantly.

It was so disappointing to observe Hoover, as the big crazy bully, hanging over his own President as a vulture continuously waiting to take the Kennedys down. I definitely have a different mindset after viewing this series and have some major contemplation to do regarding governments and how they are run, not just the U.S., but all over our planet.

Having said this I found the series fascinating and a good study of history both in terms of content and style. I am now wishing that there was a series about Hoover. Speaking of which, he belies the notion that the characters were not black and white, good or bad.

1624659,5,B00005MEV7,"Released by NBC in November of 1983 on the 20th anniversary of the assassination; it was at the time the mini-series most talked about around water coolers the next morning. It grabs your attention with Blair Brown's recital of Alan Seeger's ""I Have a Rendezvous with Death""; (which according to the JFK Library was one of his favorites, and he would often ask Jackie to read it in the evening,) and keeps it right through to the shots fired. One is caught up in the lives of this family; that even though you know when and where the assassination takes place, it is still a bit of a shock. Martin Sheen brings another dimension to JFK; one which often gets lost in the writings of the media. You see the relationship between Jack and Jackie from a different perspective; one that I believe is correct, she was no mouse, but after Patrick's death it is well known that they were closer than they had ever been, and these two bring that to life. All of the actors rise to the occasion; but it is Sheen and Brown that truly shine. I was thrilled to find it available on DVD.

Still, the writing and acting here are pretty good for a TV movie of this vintage. Some parts go on way too long, such as the Bay of Pig and civil rights segments, and J. Edgar Hoover is creepy sometimes, but mostly just over the top. Resemblances are uncanny, though, to the real Hoover and Jackie Kennedy. Martin Sheen as JFK is close, but no cigar. EG Marshall as old man Kennedy does a great job. This is certainly no substitute for history, but as a TV entertainment, it remains impressive. The cutting is pretty contemporary for something of this vintage. This, overall, holds up pretty well.",1256428800,21,784,4.858208955223881

It's goood to see his infedelity was not glossed over. Martin Sheen and Blair Brown are spot on perfect as Jack and Jackie, interdispersed with perfect renactments of archival footage. He had a lot happen in less than 4 years as president, The Bay of Pigs, The civil rights movement, the birth and death of his two sons. Martin Sheen of course went on to portray another president in the West Wing. The name Kennedy will always be senonomous with tradgedy. If you are facinated by the Kennedy's and that era in America, this series is a must. It's frank, and as factual and real as it can be. A great forerunner to Oliver Stone's JFK",1209081600,7,804,4.513698630136986
1624680,4,B00005MEV7,"I was 10 when this TV mini series screened way back in 1983, the twentieth anniversry of JFK's death. The fact that my parents allowed me to watch this was to give me an understanding of a person I grew to admire, and still do to this day...Despite all of his flaws.

This mini series was cutting edge when it was created and looking back now, was probibly the first attempt to dramatise the little over 1000 days of office JFK had.

Martin Sheen, although at the time believed to have been mis-cast for the role, pulls it off well and probibly launched his career proper, and enspired his sons to do the same. No sign of President Bartlett here though.

Geraldine Fitzgerald plays a fine Jackie, wearing the infamous pink suit and pill pox hat for any actor these days is always tinged with ominous dread and sadness.

John Shea plays the all important Bobby role and with Vincent Gardenia as J Edgar Hoover, it great to see these two men playing off each other.

Because of the fact that it was only twenty years since JFKs death and the fact that sensitivity was still needed towards Jackie and the reamaining Kennedy's, many of JFKs shortcommings were ""papered"" over and his private peccadillos were only touched on, with Gardenia's Hoover playing off them.  Hoover is slightly mis-represented here as an aging surly dictator director of his FBI, hiding his own insecurities and sexualy. His obsession with the Kennedy clan was well known by 1983, however I feel that it was played on too much.

World events of the time are given due credit, including Vietnam and Cuba, but also the Civil Rights movement that inflammed its self during JFKs short reign.

Special Features of the DVD set include four short documentries and the last one called ""The Last Two Days"" shows the moments leading up to and including the assasination, as well as the infamous radio report.

Extended scenes DOES make for a longer miniseries, some of it not needed. But considering it's now the 21st century and some of the goals set by JFK himself still unachieved, this DVD set makes for a nostelgia trip back to 1983.  A miniseries made in it's time, a time still with unreleased information, without morphing actors into live scenes and a good attempt to get a handle on a president that meant so much to so many for such a short time.",1187308800,5,2318,4.618004866180049
1624681,5,B00005MEV7,"This is a mini-series that I think is worth coming back to time and again.  Martin Sheen does a fabulous job of playing JFK.  The series itself continues to surprise despite repeated viewings of trying to show everyone in the most realistic light possible, without sacrificing the narrative arc or the need for entertainment.

It is amazing to me how action packed the 1000 days of the Kennedy administration were and how wide ranging and far ranging the issues that were tackled - i) nuclear war, ii) soviet expansionism, iii) civil rights, iv) space technology advances, v) industry/labor relations etc.

Given later movies and writing on Lyndon Johnson, I wondered if he was shown in a more than unflattering light in this series, or if this was how the Kenndy's viewed LBJ.

Finally, the dialog, script, casting and acting are absolutely top notch and credible.

The extras, as other revieweres have pointed out are absorbing.  Watching President Kenney deliver the Inaugral address is a singularly inspiring experience.

KENNEDY is a believable docu-drama that stays true to the 1000 day historical record.  What's very commendable is Jim Goddard staying away in mass from the soap opera element of JFK's now much publicized adultery and the blind eye turned (to it) by his wife, staff and family.  Vincent Gardinia offers memory burn as J. Edgar Hoover, just as Sheen does with JFK.  The final ride through Dealy Plaza is horrific.",1085011200,57,630,4.598214285714286
1624683,4,B00005MEV7,"This 1983 NBC mini-series may well be the best of its kind and remains probably the definitive Kennedy docu-drama. The film is confined to the brief years of the presidential administration, and is refreshingly honest in retelling the Bay of Pigs fiasco, the presidential philandering and, of course, the drama of that fateful final day. Martin Sheen is magnificent, as usual, in the title role, and he plays his presidential role with a believeable human quality that the real man thought of his constituency as the disenfranchised. As the first lady, Blair Brown's portrait of Jacqueline Kennedy is riveting and haunting as impressed throughout with her voiced-over prophecy of her ""appointment with death."" Beyond the two leads, a stellar supporting cast is headed by the late E.G. Marshall as the Kennedy patriarch, Joe Sr., John Shea as RFK and the late Vincent Gardenia in a sinister turn as FBI head J. Edgar Hoover. But this film belongs to Sheen and Brown, and together they ignite a sense of glamour and vitality that defined the real couple. Brown, especially, however, is mesmerizing, and her accomplishment here is a must-see. There are apparently two versions on the market, the original and an edited time-condensed version. Stay away from the shorter one. The editing is so bad that continunity is sacrificed, and all we get is a jumbled mess. The original is well worth the five or so hours to watch it, and its an impassioned account of the successes and shortcomings of the Camelot administration.",1038528000,98,1516,4.996047430830039
