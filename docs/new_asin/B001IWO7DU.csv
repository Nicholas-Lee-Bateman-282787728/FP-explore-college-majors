8311466,5,B001IWO7DU,"This is a hilarious sitcom. The plot features Reba, a divorced mom with three kids, who has to put up with them, her son-in-law, ex-husband, and his new wife,  Barbara-Jean, the big blonde ditz. They get into all sorts of crazy situations, usually involving family fights, but sometimes wandering into the truly bizarre (they even managed a tasteful comedy about Hurricane Katrina). The dialogue is witty, the actors have perfect timing, and the plots are entertaining. Barbara-Jean, steals most of the shows, but all of the characters have their moments. If you want to laugh, I highly recommend renting this.",1278979200,,610,5.1

8311471,5,B001IWO7DU,"I won't go into great detail but, suffice it to say, this complete series of ""REBA"" is well worth the (reasonable) price to me. I think the show is a hoot. I love 1/2 hour sitcoms to begin with. For me, this one hits the mark. The entire cast works well together in this one. They connect. It works. And Reba, let's face it, this is one multi-talented lady for sure. (And Joanna Garcia certainly is easy on the eyes too! Whew)! All the cast members are hilarious. If you've paid any attention to this series, you know where I'm coming from here. To me, well worth the price. The multi-talented Reba racks up another winner!",1234483200,,623,4.379310344827586
8311472,4,B001IWO7DU,"I love ""Reba."" I can wholeheartedly recommend the whole show for being funny, having great actors, and supporting good values. If you've seen any of the show and liked it, you'll probably like the whole thing.

I will say that it might pay off to wait to make this purchase. I bought seasons 1-4 for about $45 before season five came out. Season six will probably come out relatively soon, and the bundle then might be more worth it. Whenever you buy it, I say go for it. Also, in case you're wondering, there should be special features on each season. I got the entire seasons plus special features when I bought 1-4 together.",1232409600,,627,4.5
