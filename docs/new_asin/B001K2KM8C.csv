3662899,3,B001K2KM8C,"The Blu-Ray release wasn't even necessary, it looks washed out and grainy and you can even see some of the static from the picture. However, I do like the movies themselves. I saw the first one in theaters and I didn't go in with any expectations. Granted the movies could have been better but I enjoyed them for the most part.

Do I recommend the Blu-Ray release? I'm 50/50 on it but if you can find it cheap I say go for it.

The second movie was much more serious fantasy. Less light hearted feel to it. Very little connection to the first movie, they even changed the name of the magical land a little.",1294531200,3,359,4.358208955223881
3662901,2,B001K2KM8C,"I feel sorry for Dungeons and Dragons fans. I really do.

These poor souls have suffered through some of the worst adaptations in movie history, namely the ""Dungeons and Dragons"" movie -- nonsensical, horribly produced, and filled with abysmal acting and writing. In fact, it's so bad that the SyFy sequel ""Dungeons and Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God"" was a huge step up.

In ""Dungeons and Dragons,"" the evil mage Profion (Jeremy Irons) wants to overthrow the pure-hearted Empress (Thora Birch), and her only chance is to get the Rod of Savrille (it's French?) which controls red dragons. But the secret location of the Rod has fallen into the hands of an apprentice mage, a pair of idiot thieves, a drunken dwarf and a snotty elf.

Honestly, that movie is so bad that it makes you want to impale yourself on a barbecue fork -- it's actually watchable only in a MST3K way. With that in mind, the sequel literally cannot get any worse... and it doesn't.

In ""Dungeons and Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God,"" the dragon god Falazure is waking in his mountain prison, because a hammy baddie from the first movie has captured a magical orb with his power. Ex-knight Berek (Mark Dymond) assembles the usual crew -- an elf wizard, a thief, a barbarian warrior, and a cleric -- and sets out to capture the orb before the world is destroyed (and his wife turns into a zombie... don't ask).

Anyone who has heard of THE WORST fantasy movies in existence will hear of the original ""Dungeons and Dragons,"" right alongside such gems as Eragon and In the Name of the King - A Dungeon Siege Tale. And honestly, it deserves all the scorn heaped upon it -- exactly ten seconds into this movie, you can see the despairing look in Jeremy Irons' eyes right before he gives up even trying.

There is NOTHING that works in this movie. Leaden direction, silly action scenes (how many times can Marina club someone with a torch?!), goofy CGI, silly costumes (shoulderpads of DOOM!) and a story that meanders along with random side-trips (Ridley has to run through a ridiculously easy maze), and dialogue that makes you want to set your own brain on fire (the Empress' ""rousing"" speech to the Council).

As for the actors, they have exactly two decent actors in this movie -- Thora Birch and Jeremy Irons -- both of whom are obviously not trying. The other actors are dismal at best, and Marlon Wayans plays a borderline racist character whom even the WRITERS got tired of.

So is ""Wrath of the Dragon God"" any better? Yes! It was obviously written and made with real affection, and it's kind of likable in its earnest attempt to, if not make an epic classic fantasy movie, then at least make a movie worth watching. Sadly it's still a mess, mainly because of the weird pacing, thin plot, and a literal deus ex machina.

But the characters are much better than in the original movie, mainly because they TRY SO HARD -- especially the wonderfully dry-witted Stern and the wholehearted woman-warrior Chidzey, who sadly gets some of the worst dialogue (""Come, villainy. Death awaits you""). The problem is that one dead guy and two critically-injured people are... just forgotten at the end of the movie. Weird.

""Dungeons & Dragons 2-Movie Collection"" is distinctive mainly for having one of the worst movies to never get roasted by MST3K, and a lackluster BUT TRYING REALLY HARD sequel.",1294099200,10,3361,4.700680272108843

3662903,5,B001K2KM8C,"Two DVDs on a single double-sided disc.  What more do you want?

(Side A) ""Dungeons and Dragons"" --- Damon Wayan's performance is simultaneously stereotypical and necessary for the movie's main character to grow.  Wayan's character is a buffoon who acts heroically when he must.  In a meta-game sense, Wayan's character reminds the audience that the movie should not be all doom-and-gloom and that heroes can be the most unlikely of people.  And Wayans brings a big name to the movie.  OK, moving beyond that element . . .

The actors are all more than adequate.  The special effects are impressive and massive in scale.  Special effects have improved since this movie was made, but they are still great in this movie.  The script makes me care what happens if the characters fail; at least one country will fall into civil war, and the world may be destroyed as well.

(Side A Extras) The DVD commentaries are informative, especially when the pre-movie difficulties are explained.  Dave Arneson's comments are randomly inserted into the commetaries, which is a bit distracting.

(Side B) Dungeons and Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God --- The movie sticks closer to a roleplaying game, which is both good and bad.  The action is continuous, the characters are familiar, but it does not dare to become something more.  It overcorrects for the faults of the first movie and stays on point.

(Side B Extras) I did not buy this DVD set for the snippets of Gary Gygax, but his brief extra is great.  The other DVD extras have a D&D twist to help explain the movie.",1284940800,3,1559,4.757462686567164

So, yes, it's a fun movie for kids, and even for adults who crave a little juvenile fantasy in their lives from time to time.

The first movie had much better backgrounds and I felt that what it was intended to show was very well done. However , the second movie was almost like seeing a completely different movie. Instead of the kingdom we come to expect based on the first movie, you find yourself in mud huts, etc. It's almost if if someone made the choice to forget what had went before.

Okay, the movies weren't as spectacular as one would expect from a major enterprise as Dungeons and Dragons.  In fact, these would be classified as ""grade-B"" movies, because of the writing and the fact that there are no major stars in it at all!  However, I found both to be enjoyable flicks to pass the time on a rainy day.  I particularly enjoyed everyone's reaction when the swordsman walked up and OPENED the eye of the sleeping dragon, making it clear that it was no rock formation!  I've been waiting for certain movies to come out on Blu-ray, and while I probably would never have purchased these movies individually, I did go for it when they offered both at once!

I really, really love the second movie: Wrath of the Dragon God. Now, I'm not particularly a Dungeons & Dragons fan. I'm a fan of fantasy RPG games. I felt right at home watching this movie. The main characters are a typical RPG battle party: a swordsman, a female warrior (amazon), a thief, a cleric, and an elf. There's plenty of magic, monsters, and dungeon crawling. All the references to fantasy RPG gaming make me feel like a kid again. This movie is not for everyone; it's appeal is definitely a niche interest.

3662935,4,B001K2KM8C,"A quick review of the two films. The first one is so god awfully bad that it's one of the most entertaining experiences ever a la ""The Producers'"" Springtime For Hitler. Everything from the over/under acting, ridiculous script, poor effects, and cheesy set pieces is of the poorest quality that a big budget can buy. Yet it falls into the wonderful category of ""So bad, It's good."" The second takes a more faithful route and lands in ""So okay, It's Average."" The attention to detail concerning the source material is evident, taking actual lore and characters from the original D&D books. But with a smaller budget and diminished scale, the film leaves a bit to be desired, even for hardcore or casual D&D fans.

Now for the BluRay release.

The first film leaves way too much to be desired. There may be only a small handful of seconds where the picture looks perfect, with the rest looking like all they did was attempt to upscale the whole thing to a higher resolution. This just makes grainy scenes look grainier, and the already terrible effects worse. I actually noticed a model/texture pop in on one of the dragons that I didn't see on DVD! Sound gains no benefits of uncompressed audio.

I can only describe the quality of the second film as near-perfection. Every scene has a clarity in picture I've not seen before. It's possible to get a close up so pristine that you are capable of counting every hair in someone's stubble. The excellent picture quality is also a bit of an issue concerning effects as the low-budget CGI effects are not well composed, jerky in animation, and not perfectly integrated into scenes, so the enhanced quality makes these imperfections all the more noticeable. The sound quality is as good as it can be. The power of uncompressed audio allows for the more extravagant effects such as magic to ring clear through high quality speakers or headphones.

All the special features from the DVD also appear, but in their standard DVD quality. The audio commentary for the second film is rather enjoyable as instead of it being the usual Director/Producer/Cast commentary of every other film (and the first one, which was a shameless self-praising of their own film), it has three of the production team acting as three iconic D&D characters to deliver a commentary Mystery Science Theater 3000-style, citing unique character traits of various classes, D&D lore, and taking plenty of comical jabs at one another, adding an entertainingly enlightening experience.",1383955200,7,2494,4.888888888888889

3662937,5,B001K2KM8C,"This review is only about the second movie, ""Wrath of the Dragon God,"" since it is the only one worth watching. The DVD version is very well done, very sharp and clear, but I bought the Blu-ray version HOPING that it would be significantly better. Fortunately, the Blu-ray version really is much better than the DVD, definitely a worthwhile upgrade (if only most Blu-rays were like this!). For those who, like myself, are not familiar with the D&D terminology, you will need to either see this movie several times, or read a ""translation"" of the story; wikipedia has a fairly good summary, although still with a few gaps. For example, the ""little lava guy"" at the beginning is a ""magmin,"" a being who is being used as a guide and/or servant by the main bad-guy, Damodar. For a long time, I thought the magmin WAS Damodar, whose appearance was a result of a curse! Also, Damodar refers to ""Lich,"" which I later realized was not a name, but a specific type of creature or maybe demon; oops...

I can watch this film every few months and thoroughly enjoy it! To put that in context, I am a male in his mid-fifties, and other films I enjoy watching every few months are Underworld, The Mummy, Serenity, the Blade movies, Push, Constantine, Van Helsing, Gothika, The Chronicles of Riddick, Resident Evil, Blade Runner, and The 13th Warrior (and Coraline and D.E.B.S., but they're in a different genre from the others). Several of these movies just aren't that great the first time -- Van Helsing in particular comes to mind -- but they really grow on you, and allow you to enjoy ""being there"" with them.

Didn't realize until recently that the film got bad reviews from critics, anything from poor directing, acting, bad special effects and what they called 'Star Wars' costumes. I will admit watching it now that those things can be seen but yet it doesn't bother me. All I can say is check it out and see for yourself. If you're a fan of D&D the role playing game or just a fan of sword and sorcery fantasy, you'll like it..
Now, I can't say much about the sequel. It doesn't directly pick up after the first, but Damodar(Bruce Payne) does return as the villian. The costumes and tone of the film are alot darker than the first, which makes the two alot different. You can't go wrong with this fantasy two pack filled with swords, action, humor, sorcerers, dwarves, elves, dragons and loads of creatures. Do these movies rival Lord of the Rings trilogy?..

3662940,5,B001K2KM8C,"Once upon a time in a land not so far away, a callow youth named Courtney Solomon had a dream. So he saved his pennies and at the tender age of 20, secured the film rights to DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, and thence pursued his Holy Grail: a big-screen version of the much-loved neo-medieval role-playing game. For 10 long years he wandered in the Holly Wood in search of the all-important Green Light, until one day he chanced upon the Lord of High Concepts (Sir Joel of the Silver). A meeting was taken and thence, ""a Courtney Solomon film"" was born.

Talented actors signed on for big paychecks, but now, so close to his dream, the novice filmmaker refused to allow his vision to pass into the hands of those more experienced, and he himself assumed the director's chair. Some $43 million later, he had his tale of the fair Empress of Izmer, whose rule is threatened by an evil mage, or magician. With the help of a dwarf, an elf, an apprentice mage and two thieves, disaster was averted . . . in Izmer. (Alas, the same can not be said of the tale itself, which stinketh like the breath of a dyspeptic dragon.) But for we collectors of BAD MOVIES WE LOVE, there is a happier ending.

Laboriously expository and defiantly incomprehensible, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS seems to involve the hunt for an enchanted ""rod,"" a threat to the prevailing ""fabric of magic,"" the fight for democracy in the kingdom of Izmer, and the ritual humiliation of actors. In ascending order of ignominy: haughty apprentice mage bland Zoe McLellan; Skywalkerish commoner Justin Whalin (the new Sean Patrick Flanery or the new Robert Sean Leonard? Discuss); his bumbling sidekick Marlon Wayans (a black character straight out of Hollywood's 1938 playbook); Glenn Close-channeling Jeremy Irons; and fair-minded empress Thora Birch, (who models a series of headpieces cribbed from '70s disco album sleeves and throughout sustains the impression of having learned her lines phonetically.)

Those schooled in the arcana of the phenomenally successful fantasy role playing game can best rule on whether Solomon's live action adaptation is a faithful depiction of its obsessive world of elves, dwarfs, and winged things, but even a babe in dungeonland can see that the leading fire breather in this malty brew of heroics and minutiae isn't a computer generated creature, but Jeremy Irons as the archvillain Profion. All goggle-eyes, exaggerated double takes and full-throated oratory, Irons howls, whispers and rages, as he struts about in Olivier's 'Hamlet' eyeliner. Luxuriously bellowing immortal lines like ''You! Are! Mine! Now!', he attacks and guzzles every shred of scenery as if he were playing King Lear at a suburban community theater. ""With a dragon army at my command I can crush the empress!"" he cries joyfully, bending at the waist and making little claws out of his hands. (It's Bad Movie Nirvana!)

As Irons henchman Damodar, Bruce Payne runs a close second. A bald and burly centurion, Payne goes through the movie wearing metallic blue lipstick, (an obvious but puzzling reference to Petula Clark), terrorizing heroes Whalin and Wayans, whose destiny is to save the world - or whatever. Aided by a lissome elf and a grumpy dwarf, our heroes embark on a quest involving glowing rubies and secret scrolls. With his long, chestnut lashes, cherubic cheeks and silky complexion, Justin Whalen is significantly prettier than his female love interest Zoe McLellan - the wholesome, magic-wielding librarian. Despite this obvious fact, McLellan decides to join them, and luckily, after she kisses Whalen her glasses disappear and her backswept math-girl hairdo is magically transformed into a hipper center-part. Our heroic group must battle Payne for possession of a powerful thingummy that can control red dragons, which may or may not be bigger and meaner than the regular green kind. The thingummy itself is called a ""rod,"" but strongly resembles my friend's old Dragon Bong. (A connection to the true Dungeons & Dragons universe at last!)

The movies aren't good, but you will enjoy watching them. At least, I did.

The acting, special effects and overall plot are just kinda above average in both films. The first movie has a bit better acting and plot. The bad guy in the first movie is the main difference I think. He's pretty cool, but in the second film he returns and is a completely different person it seems. The films are more light hearted and fun than anything else. If you're looking for a serious Sci-fi movie D&D probably isn't for you. If you want a fun fantasy that has some laughs and a little bit of action then you will probably enjoy this movie set.",1352160000,2,645,4.209677419354839

3662954,3,B001K2KM8C,"Well I didn't expected much. After all there are very few truly good fantasy movies around. Basing them out of DnD/game background doesn't necessarily makes them good.

The 1st movie was overall a disappointment. Overall what suppose to be a grand story line, was ruined by unbelievable character actions, and cliche ""mini quests"" along the way. The team of adventurers was too big for its own good, and some of characters, specially the dwarf, was just out of place.
The dragons looking rather cheesy didn't help it neither.

I give it C for the effort. (I guess I expected a lot more than it could deliver.)

I enjoyed the 2nd movie a bit more. Even thought, the story line wasn't that epic, the characters and their actions were far more reasonable, and overall actor performance was more realistic. Dragons in the 2nd movie looked far more impressive and lot more realistic. DnD fans will also appreciate references to a specific spells and magical techniques.

I give it B-. Its ok the first time, but I probably won't see more than once more again, before shelving it for a long time.",1329436800,,1090,4.721052631578948

Young Empress, Savina wishes to make great changes to the kingdom of Izmer, establishing equality for everyone, not just the Mages. But the evil Profion plots to usurp her control. Meanwhile, Ridley and Snails are two thieves, unhappy with the Mages' dominance. While stealing from the Mages, the two find themselves wrapped up in a search for a mythical rod that could mean certain destruction if it falls into Profion's hands.  The film has an impressive cast including: Jeremy Irons (Profion), Bruce Payne (Damodar), Justin Whalin (Ridley), Marlon Wayans (Snails), Thora Birch (Empress Savina) and Zoe McLellan (Marina). The comical and almost cartoonish feel make for a fun and light-hearted fantasy with plenty of magic, dragons, and heart. Those unfamiliar with the game (like me) with little-to-no expectations, this was a fun and fast-paced adventure when it released in 2000. Re-watching it in 2011, I found it much more corny, with out-dated special effects. Yet, it was still enjoyable following the thief characters and their party.

Dungeons and Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God (2005)
Damodar plans revenge against the kingdom of Izmer, capturing a powerful orb in order to summon a dragon to destroy the kingdom. The warrior Berek and mage Melora, along with a diverse group of heroes, fight to reach the orb before Damodar's plans unfold. Bruce Payne (Damodar) is the only returning main character for the sequel. Though, the acting and special effects once again fall flat. The pacing is off and I became confused several times throughout the film, wondering if familiarity with the game is necessary to understand all of the plot elements. This sequel has little else in common with its predecessor. Where the previous was fun and light-hearted, this installment is very violent and humorless. A definitive quest-like adventure, the highlight of the film is the diverse party's various encounters with monsters along their quest.",1298505600,4,1975,5.2271293375394325

These films did not deserve the budget they were given. What is strange is that the third D&D movie was by far the best of the three. Yet, after the first to miserable failures, almost nothing was said about the third movie. If you like swords and sorcery, watch the third film. Sadly, you will not find it on Amazon.",1526342400,,465,4.35632183908046

8314115,4,B001K2KM8C,"DUNGEONS & DRAGONS (2000)

DIRECTED BY Courtney Solomon, ""Dungeons & Dragons"" chronicles events in the kingdom of Izmer where the idealistic Empress (Thora Birch) advocates equality between the mages and commoners while the power-mad Profion (Jeremy Irons) plots to overthrow the Empress with the help of his formidable henchman Damodar (Bruce Payne). A ragtag team is assembled to save Izmer by apprehending the Eye of the Dragon: Two thieves (Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans), a beautiful mage apprentice (Zoe McLellan), a dwarf (Lee Arenberg) and an elf girl (Kristen Wilson).

The first shot with Irons hamming it up as the diabolical Profion made me bust out laughing. In other words, the movie telegraphs from the get-go that its not to be taken seriously. If you can roll with the campiness, this is an amusing throwaway fantasy flick. Imagine the gaudiness of Star Wars (1977) if the story were transplanted to a Medieval-like kingdom where dragons & magic are reality and youd have a good idea of what Dungeons & Dragons has to offer.

This was a theatrical release that cost a whopping $45 million, but totally bombed at the box office. The 2005 sequel Wrath of the Dragon God (with only Bruce Payne returning as Damodar) cost just $15 million and is slightly better because the creators took the material seriously, but its decidedly TV fantasy fare.

The film scores pretty well on the female front with the winsome McLellan and cutie Birch. Whalin and Wayans are entertaining as the two main protagonists, if you can get past their goofiness. People love to hate Snails (Wayans), but I found him to be a likable, amusing character.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 47 minutes and was shot in the Czech Republic (Kutn Hora and Prague). WRITERS: Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright.

GRADE: C

====================

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: WRATH OF THE DRAGON GOD (2005)

DIRECTED BY Gerry Lively, ""Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God"" amasses a good group of protagonists who seek to find some magical black orb and save their kingdom, Ismir, from the wrath of a malevolent dragon slumbering in a nearby mountain. This involves an evil wizard, Damodar, played by Bruce Payne, who is the only one to return from the first D&D film from 2000.

I liked the whole adventure-quest aspect of the story and the colorful group of characters who join together to defeat the wizard and save the kingdom: A noble ex-knight statesman (Mark Dymond), a cleric (Steven Elder), a rogue (Tim Stern), a hot warrior woman (Ellie Chidzey) and an elf girl mage (Lucy Gaskell). The stunning Clemency Burton-Hill is also on hand as the nobleman's wife who does her part to help save Ismir. The towering Chidzey (511) is nice & curvy rather than unappealingly thin, like the stereotypical model.

Although I've never played Dungeons & Dragons, I read one of the books years ago and numerous others from the sword & sorcery genre, especially Conan, Gor and ERB, not to mention numerous sword & sorcery flicks (some being sword & NO sorcery, like ""First Knight"" and ""King Arthur,"" lol). Anyway, this second Dungeons & Dragon movie works just good enough for me to give it a decent grade. Although it was relatively low-budget (Im actually surprised it cost $15 million) it's generally superior to the typical Syfy fare and thoroughly austere compared to the campy first film. I liked how the writers actually threw in some nice character bits, like the developing friendship/respect of the rogue and the barbarian. They should've included more.

""Dungeons & Dragons"" is a fitting title because you get your fill of both. There are numerous dungeon scenes with torches and secret passageways, as well as two impressive dragon sequences, one featuring an ice dragon and another with the mountain dragon who looks like Satan himself. On top of this you get some quality forest locations and Medieval sets.

THE FILM RUNS 105 minutes was shot in Lithuania. WRITERS: Robert Kimmel, Lively (the director) and Brian Rudnick.
