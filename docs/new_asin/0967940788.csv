7794096,1,0967940788,"A collegue of mine has correctly pointed out on several occassions that, despite what many may claim, film-making (script-writing, cinematography,  etc.) and comic book writing/illustrating are NOT at all similar.
Having  attempted to watch 'Demonatrix,' I think I have at least one piece of  concrete evidence (other than my collegues personal experience) to support  that claim. I eventually started shuttling through some of the more  excrutiating sequences, although I did make it all the way from the opening  credits to the end credits by doing so.) As a filmmaker, Everette Hartsoe  makes a damn fine packager/creator of comic books!
Normally, I don't  bother posting slams of Z-grade flicks like this one--when we buy them,  we're expecting schlock, so unless there's something surprising to point  out ripping on them doesn't do anyone any good. But the summary of the  film, coupled with my knowledge of 'Razor' and other comic book titles that  bear Hartsoe's name suckered me in. I purchased every issue of 'Full Metal  Fiction' and enjoyed them all, and I'm glad I got them before watching  'Demonatrix.' I might have assumed that they were as bad as this flick.
The decription posted by Amazon.com is an accurate plot summary, but  that said plot only accounts for about 15-20 minutes of running time. (And  that portion is marred by badly delivered, poorly scripted  dialogue--although, it probably would work just fine if featured in baloons  on a comic book page--costumes so cheap that they add unintentional humour  to the film, and actors and actresses that would give amateur theatre a bad  name. What's more, there are annoying dissolves created by using a standard  feature'white out' feature on home video cameras without any further  editing of said sections.) The rest of the film is taken up by unappealing  simulated sex and masturbation scenes set to second-rate metal music.",967420800,4,1904,5.150326797385621
