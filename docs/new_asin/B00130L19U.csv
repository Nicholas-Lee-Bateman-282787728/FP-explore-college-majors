8248703,4,B00130L19U,"When watching this, you need to forget poor sound and video quality - at the time it was made, the footage was already decades old. The skits they used are still hilarious, and (especially if you know some history, and what else was in theaters, etc. for the period) on-the-mark. ""They dared to make a film without Betty Grable."" Take a look at Betty Grable's list of works at Amazon's IMDB site.  Without knowing that, the line's not funny... but at the time the line was _said_, it was on-the-mark, hands-down, hilarious. Everyone knew who she was, and the joke was worth a million laughs.

Keep the period in mind... and you will laugh.

I think they could have used funnier skits from Lucy and Desi's history, and there were certainly more comedians that would have tripled the length of this without losing the laughs - that's the reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5.",1507852800,,868,4.551282051282051
8248704,1,B00130L19U,"These were not really funny episodes. They had so much better laughs in my day. I thought that's what I was getting, but NO.",1354838400,3,124,4.208333333333333
8248705,2,B00130L19U,"This DVD purports to be a compendium of early TV comedy, some of which I recall. Problems: some of the most important performers of the era are left out, a couple of minor performers selected are not classics, and the routines included are by far not their best. My advice is to skip this one and opt for the funniest moments or blooper DVDs of specific shows, such as Carol Burnett's.",1295049600,5,385,4.436619718309859
8248706,1,B00130L19U,"Look at the review for ""TELEVISION'S Greatest Comedians."" (The VHS.)  Does the cover look familiar?  Read my review
of the VHS. It looks as if they put the same crap on to a DVD. Sorry to be blunt, but it really is
a waste of money and time, if it's the same unfunny collection that was on the VHS.",1265932800,6,298,4.033898305084746
