I paid you an extra 9 dollars to get it mailed to me in two days that was three weeks ago and I have not seen the video yet. so Im not really happy with you or the service I have received. so either give me back all my money, or send me the video right away. Sorry IM so dissappointed with your service because the movie was really great on TV.

7844985,5,6303343864,"I ordered this video to see what kind of movies their making about cowboys these days.  The answer, good ones.  We get to see, and hear, up close and personal, a man whose job it is to know horses. The big, athletic ones that can end your career or earn you a pocketful of money, all within a few 8 second long rides.  Dad gets up, feeds the horses, says goodbye to wife and kids, whom he loves.  Then, goes down the road to ride the horses he loves, in front of the fans he loves, so he can earn his way to the NFR, and really show who he is.  If you want to see a real cowboy, this is the video to watch, over and over again.",1003708800,2,627,3.8294573643410854
