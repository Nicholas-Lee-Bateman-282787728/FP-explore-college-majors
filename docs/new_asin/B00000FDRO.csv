1212152,5,B00000FDRO,"So ya'll will know where I'm comming from, born in 1953, seen Roxy live twice, Brian Ferry once,(Robin Trower was on guitar on this tour),have every single Roxy Music Album there ever was,U.S versions and imports on vinyl, one  that was banned in the USA.  Now, as for this video.  If you enjoy the music, you will love the video, it's a must have.",975110400,3,348,4.40625
1212153,5,B00000FDRO,"This DVD takes me back to the days when my wife and I used to catch every T-Rex concert we could (along with The Who of course!) when we were living and working in London. Their music has held up really well -- and so have we! Despite the cheesy psychedelic filming, this performance is really great, capturing Marc Bolan and Micky Finn at their best. But the real punch comes with the Roxy Music set -- Glam Rock at its best, with the glitter underlaid by sensational musicianship -- it's a set you must have. This is one of the best rock or pop DVDs yet issued, up there with the Roy Orbison Anthology, Eurythmics Greatest Hits, Bob Dylan's Don't Look Back, and the fantastic Doors 2-DVD anthology. But we're still waiting for what will be the greatest of all when the powers-that-be finally decide to release it -- a DVD of Bryan Ferry/Roxy Music's Greatest Hits -- our video is just about worn out!",969494400,6,902,4.4397590361445785
1212154,4,B00000FDRO,"This is a review of the Roxy Music only VHS (The DVD with T-Rex & Roxy was not available when I purchased this). This video is a must-have for fans of early Roxy Music.  Eno is rarely seen in footage, but appears in  full glam glory in this Musikladen concert. The filming was probably  state-of-the-art in 1973 with fun little psychedelic special effects. My  main complaint is that it is so short. I would love to find a video with  this, plus footage of later concerts, maybe manifesto or something from  around the time of country life to compare it to.",951177600,4,557,4.465346534653466
1212155,4,B00000FDRO,"Since most single artist ""MusikLaden"" DVDs are so short, two bands which fell into the ""glam rock"" umbrella of the early '70s have been coupled on this disc. The T.Rex portion of this DVD features  mainly songs from the ""Electric Warrior"" album. The visuals are  typical for this TV show at the time - mainly psychedelic colours and shots  of the band looming over the group on a chroma-key background. The  performance is OK and, although the band are essentially playing live,  there are some audio overdubs. The Roxy Music portion of this disc is what  makes it a real find. Dating from a performance from late 1972 or early  '73, the band is filmed on a set which resembles a music club. The most  interesting part of this performance is that it was filmed while Brian Eno  was still a part of the band. Five of the six songs are from this  performance and the last tune feeatures Eno's replacement, Eddie Jobson  (ex-Curved Air) in a 1973/74 performance. All the tracks are solid and the  sound quality is very good (remixed for Dolby 5.1). A real highlight is the  overdrive guitar solo by Phil Manzanera on ""In Every Dream Home a  Heartache"". This DVD is an essential purchase for fans of early Roxy  Music and Brian Eno. <Chris Meloche, London, Ont., Canada>",942192000,15,1266,4.614349775784754
1212156,5,B00000FDRO,"Wonderful quality early Roxy Music, forget the analog blue screen T Rex (not even Telegram Sam featured here).  But Roxy, well wow.  Even the Eno plumage can't wreck this showcase.  Makes me wish I was living back in the  late 70's again!  A keeper video.",930528000,,255,4.5777777777777775

7908476,5,B00000FDRO,"I have some T REX and ROXY MUSIC, but never thought that these bands would sound good live. (no reason, just a thought.) Well, since the used copies of this DVD are so inexpensive, I thought I'd treat myself to a bit of LIVE T REX, and some live ROXY MUSIC, tho I wasn't a sure about the ROXY stuff being good. FIRST, let me say that the T REX material blew me away. I got thru those first songs, and turned the DVD off, cos I was flabbergasted. Imagine an incredible version of JEWEL from the first T REX album, just Mickey Finn on percussion, Marc on freak out electric guitar, still using his elf voice, and the T Rex bass player, who really gave this music as much rythymic complexity and power, as Mickey  Finn was doing with his congas, bongos, or even tambourine.  SO, this version of JEWEL alone, is worth the price or admission. IT just goes on and on, never getting boring, cos the inner beat keeps drifting around ever so slightly, giving the music a wild psychedelic vibe. RIDE A WHITE SWAN, from the Tyranesaurus Rex period, was every bit as trippy and heavy, tho it was just the electric folk version. JEEPSTER and LIFES A GAS, from ELECTRIC WARRIOR, were also rocking hard and glitterly, adding the drummer to the bass player, Marc and Mickey.  They locked in place the crazy rythym that Marc needed to make his guitars (he overdubbed a guitar on top of his 4 piece band sound), produce the complex yet primitive rock sound he craved. Unlike the live music on the T REX movie Ringo made, on THIS DVD you can definately hear MICKEY FINN on his congas going boomboom crazy.  The last T REX song (20th Century Boy) was from a later period, and Mickey's congas were buried in the mix. STill a good song, but Marc had already started to become a SLIDER down the charts. The last ROXY MUSIC song was also from a later period, after ENO left the band.

The REAL revelation here is ROXY MUSIC from right after the release of the second album. Just WATCHING these masters on stage, blew me away. LOOK! There's ENO dressed up like a peacock transvestive, running tape loops, with our first peak at Enossification (like he used with Genesis, Fripp, Talking Heads, Devo, U2, and Bowie). WATCH as ENO plays LIVE some of the most flipped out primitive synth solos i've EVER heard. EVER! (At least as wierd as Yoko Ono from this period, but without the pretensiouness.) It was not lost on me, that this is probibly the ONLY time we ever see ENO in his GLAM ROCK incarnation, doing his rock music live on stage, in a band. When Phil took one of his solos, while ENO pushed the sound thru a couple of linked 4 track reel to reel recorders, Eno obtained something like a infinite reflection of the guitar  raw sound, which he mixed in and out of the regular  guitar output. OH MAN!!  I  almost screamed in pleasure.  SO, yeah, ENO is outrageous, but.....BRIAN FERRY running to the side of the stage, playing organ and piano for the intros to songs like IN EVERY DREAMHOME A HEARTACHE, shocked me. Berry on organ, ENO playing backround ambient sounds from tapes, a little bit of OBOE from Mackay, and a few bass notes, then the song TAKES OFF like a rocketship to Osirius. WOW part 2. AND THEY JAM the hell out of that song, with each band member taking a monster solo. YUP, even the drummer at the song's end. (and its short enough to be enjoyable too!) MACKAY's sax and oboe work had an effect on me, I was not expecting. It was SAX as a bastard child of Coltrane and 50s SAX SOLO focused Rock and roll. Each song was better than the album version...every song. Just because of the ENERGY alone, but also because what this band did on stage.  They made the stage rumble and freak. From their individualistic, yet glam centered costumes (All Types Served Here, as Berry reminds us, indicating the musicians on stage, from Transvestite ENO, to Cuban marimba player dressed Phill Manzernara, to Brian as deranged 50s Crooner, to Mackey dressed up like a outerspace psychedelic freak clown, to the drummer and bassist dressed like  ""normal""  glam rockers.  I mean, just WATCHING them play was everybit as amazing as hearing them. This was ONE TIGHT BAND!  AND, one versitile band, with every song exploring sounds and attitudes which we didn't see again, until the British New Wave explosion bought about people like Lena Lovich or Blondie as a female counterpart to Brian Ferry. Watching this DVD, its bought home how important that first ROXY BAND edition was, to forming the NEW WAVE esthetic in England. I cant even IMAGINE new wave, without Bowie, Roxy Music, T Rex and NY DOLLS.  I watched some BOWIE LIVE from the BBC ""Old Grey Whistle Test"", from the same time as ROXY MUSIC, right before I watched the ROXY. AND, as much as I love BOWIE, and I DO LOVE HIM! Its obvious that as far as stage shows go during that period, nobody in the UK, probibly ANYWHERE ON EARTH, was at the level of ROXY MUSIC.  The concept, the costumes, the music, the innovation, the live energy, the bizarre futuristic concept. Its rare to see a performance, and know it was literally 5-7 years ahead of its time.  If you are a ROXY MUSIC fan, or a T REX fan, or a fan of Glam rock, or a fan of early NEW WAVE, and experimental art rock, even a fan of the film VELVET GOLDMINE, you will LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this DVD.  So, treat yourself before this stuff goes out of print, and you'll be forced to look around on UTube for a peak at how great ROCK can be, when the right combination of musicians, and the right concept, come together. Hey, its great to fight off a depression too. Cos like MARC BOLAN sings, ""LIFES A GAS"". Man, it is when this music is playing.  Baby, you'll be amazed.",1266796800,2,5659,4.444015444015444
7908477,5,B00000FDRO,"I'm not a huge Roxy Music fan.  And although I do prefer their early 70s output (to the late 70s/80s stuff), the versions on the tape outshine the studio versions - and seeing Eno, Ferry, etc in all their (made-up) glory is double the fun.
The band really ROCKS - visually and sonically.
A ""must see"" for any serious student of rock music.",1085529600,,339,4.380952380952381
7908478,4,B00000FDRO,"If you can do the almost impossible and just TUNE OUT the forgotten-but-not-gone Marc Bolan/T Rex (think...""Toy Story""), and fixate on the second half of this DVD, a very early performance of Roxy Music, you'll see how rock and roll might have matured without the twin nuisances of disco and punk. EARLY Roxy: the Brian Eno lineup, BEFORE all the ""cool"" people got hip to them. You can actually see Bryan Ferry actually sweat, you can see all the teenyboppers in the audience thinking, ""HEY, this AIN'T Three Dog Night!"" and you can see Roxy in its nascent, unpolished (maybe strongest?) incarnation. Every song is performed note for note perfectly, and it's kind of amusing to watch saxophonist Andy Mackey's disgust with Eno's ineptitude, playing the keyboard on ""In Every Dream Home A Heartache."" Ferry's even playing an obviously unplugged rhythm guitar on this song, too! And the very final song on the DVD has the Eddie Jobson incarnation of Roxy performing ""All I Want Is You."" And if you look really closely, you can see 80's ""supergroup"" (Asia) wanker John Wetton playing bass, too! Oh, if only the punks had burnt out earlier, and AIDS hadn't reared its ugly head into music...",1039910400,4,1187,4.852216748768473
7908479,5,B00000FDRO,"Unfortunately I never got to see either of these classic bands but this video gives me a taste of what I missed.  The Roxy Music footage is amazing, especially because of the prescence of Brian Eno.  He has a load of electronic gizmos on the side of the stage and adds cosmic layers of sound to the mix as well as treating the guitar with multilayered tape effects.  This is Roxy Music at their peak as they do their classic tunes culled from the first two LP's.
The T. Rex portion is equally as entertaining with Marc Bolan singing and playing some of the band's great tunes.  The psychedelic camera work adds to the feeling of the era.
The sound on both bands is surprisingly crisp and well mixed for being such an old show.  A must have for fans of either band!!",1029628800,5,765,4.321678321678322
7908480,5,B00000FDRO,Perfect time capsule of Roxy Music at the height of their Glitter Rock phase. Lots of songs off of the first and second records. Do the Strand opens and Bryan Ferry doesn't let down from there. A classic! Now if only The Midnight Special would release their 1975 University of Chicago performance...,1018569600,2,299,4.769230769230769
7908481,2,B00000FDRO,"After all how much TREX is available on video?
gotta love it!
Even with the strange but interestingly done (for the time)
Double tracking (both video and audio)of Marc Bolin playing and singing on jeepster.
Unfortunately the highlight and last TREX track, 20th century boy is lip synched. For those who don't know TREX will recognize the song from a recent automobile TV commercial.
I give the TREX portion 4 stars.
Now the Roxy section.........
Too old and dated. There musicianship is lacking in the early years but it is interesting (to say the least)to see Brian Eno.
also interesting is the clips are from multiple years so there are two iterations of the band. Of course Phil,Bryan, and Andy are great. But I saw Roxy live in 1977 and again in 2001 and they are so far superior than this DVD exhibits that if your not familiar with them this would not peak your interest to check them out. It will probably turn you completely off.",1016323200,3,937,4.616766467065868
7908482,5,B00000FDRO,"Any serious Roxy Music fan must not pass on this DVD.I only purchased the DVD for the Roxy Music half,however I did also enjoy the T-Rex.
This is Roxy Music at their golden period and the fact that it is live is a real bonus.
The sound Quality is supurb and sounded fantastic through the sound system.
Well what are you waiting for? Buy it now!!You will thank me I'm sure.",1005091200,5,372,4.253521126760563
7908483,5,B00000FDRO,"This DVD is a bit short (only one hour) but packs some thrilling, rare performances in its contents. The T.Rex side contains semi-live performances which trace Marc Bolan's development and rise to stardom within a two-year time period.  The first two tracks, ""Jewel"" and ""Ride A White Swan"", mix swirling psychedelic blue-screen visuals to some stunning guitar work; on ""Jewel"" Bolan's voice, guitarwork and overall presence is just overwhelming--this session was filmed only weeks before massive stardom came his way.  The performances of ""Jeepster"" and ""Life's A Gas"" which follow are tight and free of flamboyance, but when we switch to an early '73 rendition of ""20th Century Boy"" he is in full glam gear, delivering a raw, savage take which cuts the studio version to shreds.
The bulk of the Roxy Music material is of an early '73 live show supporting the ""For Your Pleasure"" album.  The group were peaking at around this time, just before Eno's departure, and one can see the competition between him and Ferry for attention--frontman Ferry with his suave 30s-ish mannerisms and ironic glam swagger, the androgenous Eno with his outrageous costumes and equally mind-bending electronic knob-twiddling.  The group's postmodern sound and style shine in definitive renditions of ""Do The Strand"", ""Editions Of You"", ""Every Dream Home A Heartache"" (with an achingly great Manzanera-Eno guitar solo), and the signature ""Remake/Remodel"".  There's even a performance of their hit ""Virginia Plain""--one of the best pop songs of its era--and then we're taken to 1974 for an Eno-less performance that is nonetheless still worthwhile.  Both T.Rex and Roxy Music were instrumental in bringing rock music out of the blues-rock jamming doldrums of the early 70s; the music here is highly energetic, kinetic, stylish and artistic and looks  as good today (if not better!) as it did nearly thirty years ago.",997660800,4,1894,5.231023102310231
7908484,5,B00000FDRO,"I bought this dvd for the roxy music part. And to be honest from the moment I have this dvd I already saw it 8 times. The setting is great, to see roxy music, as they where in the beginnen, on a small stage, bringing back memory's. Even if you hear the music now, its still as not aged in time. So for the realy roxy music fans I can just say, buy this dvd, sit on your chair en let the show begin.",997315200,,398,3.75
