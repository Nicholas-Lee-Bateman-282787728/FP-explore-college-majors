8205816,1,B000SM6FC2,"Having viewed a great number of DVDs this past year I was really disappointed in this series.  As an example the first topic is Midway.  If I hadn't already seen 10 DVDs on Midway I would have been completely lost.  It didn't say why the battle was fought, what its importance was.  It didn't mention the 3 famous US carriers by name.  It was like giving a senior in HS a first grade ""Dick and Jane"" book to read (I dated myself on that one..)  The photography was good but the content and commentary was very lacking.",1283817600,,518,4.288659793814433
8205817,2,B000SM6FC2,"I am disappointed in the product quality. Although it is a documentry, it is very amaturish. Perhaps since it is all done by the military it is designed to not show more in depth information.",1261785600,,191,4.485714285714286
