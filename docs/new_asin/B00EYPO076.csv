5957378,1,B00EYPO076,"I was very interested in the topic, and there are not many films that cover it so directly. But within 10-15 minutes, I began to feel uneasy -- the emphasis became less about devaluation of and violence against females, and more about sex-selective abortions. I also began to wonder why the focus was solely on India and China. The language used, the continual appearance of explicitly Christian commentators in countries where Christianity is a tiny minority, and the way it unduly focused on this particular aspect at the expense of the more important issue of women's roles, made me pay closer attention and then look up who made this.

It is a stealth anti-choice, anti-abortion-rights film, made by an anti-choice Christian organization, in the guise of a ""Womens' Rights"" documentary. Don't be fooled -- this is not about societies devaluing and attacking women -- it is about trying to get people to outlaw elective abortion.",1418860800,12,932,5.012903225806451

5957380,1,B00EYPO076,"While I appreciate that something needs to be done about the female infanticide and generally the status of women around the world (especially in South and East Asia), this movie does not advance the cause.  The message of female empowerment is merely a guise concealing the insidious true anti-choice message.  I had been looking forward to watching this documentary for some time, but didn't feel steeled enough emotionally for it.  A few weeks back I pulled it up on Netflix, and didn't make it far before I realized something was off.
The first clue came in the use of the term ""feticide."" This term has a long pedigree, but in recent years it has been used primarily for anti-choice legislation.  If it were only this instant I could get beyond it, since they were just talking about infanticide and maybe it was just a regional Indian term.
Then Dr. Puneet Bedi said ""Infanticide was a very horrible, very terrible thing to live with for the rest of your life, so the medical profession provided an easy, kinder way of killing. AS IF KILLING BEFORE BIRTH SOMEHOW MADE IT KINDER.""
Then without sourcing, an animated story is told of unscrupulous doctors performing sex selective abortions on the down low.  In the India portion there is a focus on prosecuting doctors who provide sex selective abortions.  Once the film moves on to China, the government is vilified for encouraging abortion.
It continues like this for the whole movie.  There will be a few minutes of film from a social work prospective, and then the anti-abortion propaganda appears again.  There is no discussion of reproductive rights as a means to empower women, even though a great number of studies have found this approach to be extremely effective.
It wasn't until after I watched the film and was feeling a little disturbed (not from a sense of empathy, but from the feeling that I was deceived) that I decided to Google the film with the word ""abortion,"" and discovered that the film was produced by Shadowline Films, which is a shell corp for Harvest Media Ministry, a producer of ""pro-life"" documentaries. There is an excellent Slate article explaining the film's anti-choice ties entitled ""Its a Trick: Pro-choice groups love this movie. Its director worked for a pro-life ministry. How did that happen?"" written by international human rights legal scholar Sital Kalantry .",1411084800,14,2358,4.907035175879397

5957382,4,B00EYPO076,"This film was recommended by Jimmy Carter in his book ""A Call to Action"".  I can't say it opened my eyes to this issue of gendercide, but it certainly illustrated the extremes to which people in China and India are going to skew their gender balance.  That is a very deep hatred, this misogyny, as it continues even as it backfires.  Or, perhaps importing brides from poorer countries is not a lose-lose; they probably make better slaves.",1404345600,4,438,4.662337662337662
5957383,5,B00EYPO076,I cried throughout this movie. I am so glad that I was born in a country where it is ok to be a girl,1400457600,5,100,3.2083333333333335
5957384,5,B00EYPO076,"This is a well-made, matter-of-fact documentary on the practice of female gendercide in India and China. Two of the world's most populous nations are also hotbeds of female infanticide and gendercide, driven primarily by a patriarchal society, cultures and norms that favor having sons over daughters, and in China's case, the rigid implementation of the one-child policy.

The documentary begins with a chilling interview: an rural Indian woman narrates in gory detail how she killed eight of her infant daughters at birth. There is no remorse, no sense of guilt or horror, but a matter-of-fact tone of voice and a face that belies little feeling. As I watched on in horror, it gradually dawned upon me, through numerous such interviews, that these rural women truly feel that they have no choice in the matter. Having girls is simply a burden, especially when one is born into poverty, as most of these women are. Girls are considered a burden, as the culture demands they be married off to their husbands accompanied by hefty dowries which need to be provided by the girls' families, often straining already thin resources. Once married off, the girls are considered their husbands' properties, and will have little to do with their birth families.

The proverbs in some Indian cultures reveal a deeply-entrenched dislike of females, and cements the notion that girls are nothing but burdens:
Rearing a daughter is like watering the neighbor's tree - Telugu saying
A daughter is a burden on her father's head - Hindi saying
A thief is born- a Rajasthani saying when a daughter is born

It is no wonder then that the mortality rate of girls is 40% higher than those of boys.

Even educated Indian women are not spared brutality. A well-educated Indian woman recounts how both her husband and mother-in-law abused her when she refused to have a sex-determination ultrasound on the twin babies she was expecting. When it was discovered the babies were girls, they forced her to undergo an abortion, which she refused. Having escaped her husband and MIL, the woman delivers twin girls, but her battle is far from over - not only does she have to cope with a demand for divorce from her husband, she also has to fight for her rights in the courts. The documentary reveals how unsympathetic the justice system in India is towards women, be it in cases like above, or even in cases of dowry deaths. The woman is frequently left to suffer as a victim.

Things are no different in China where the one-child policy has led to an increase in female infanticide and gendercide and has culminated in an unhealthy proportion of boys and girls where boys significantly outnumber girls, to the point where kidnapping of healthy young Chinese women has become a recent occurrence driven by desperate rural Chinese men who fear they will never be able to marry nor have children.

The documentary explores some solutions such as campaigns to raise people's awareness and political efforts, but sadly, these measures do not seem to be helping much. The much-entrenched policies and cultural mores have resulted in women and female children/infants being left to bear the horrific consequences. One can only hope and pray that things will change in the foreseeable future.",1391817600,14,3255,4.941499085923217
5957385,5,B00EYPO076,"Saw this at a private screening. It's a documentary describing the issues in China and India making ""It's a girl"" the three most dangerous words in the world. From cultural preference for boys due to need for financial support in old age and a desire not to pay for a daughter's dowry (as well as forced abortions of second and third pregnancies in China), we get sex-selective abortion (female feticide), female infanticide, girl and woman trafficking and sex trade, and murder of girls and of women who cannot pay a high dowry or produce girl children rather than boy children. Unfortunately, Indian women have bought into these cultural lies and further the violence against their own daughters, daughters-in-law, and granddaughters. One woman who refused an illegal sex-determination sonogram was starved and then poisoned by her husband and in-laws. When they took her to the hospital and she was unconscious, they convinced a doctor to do a sex-determination sono, which revealed twin girls. They then pressured her to have an abortion, which she refused. After they were born, the woman's mother-in-law threw one girl down the staircase in an attempt to murder the baby. A Chinese woman describes having her 2-year-old daughter kidnapped by a couple who wanted to secure a wife for their son since wives are now hard to come by in China and India. The most chilling moment in the film is when an Indian woman laughs as she describes strangling eight of her own daughters.",1381536000,19,1478,4.963709677419355
