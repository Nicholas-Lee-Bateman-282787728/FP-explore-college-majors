2613884,5,B000GI3RGU,Little Miss Christmas: My Wife loved this TV Movie and she was Very Happy to get It on DVD. She,1357516800,,95,3.8
2613885,5,B000GI3RGU,My husband and I enjoyed this movie as much as our daughter did...funny and heartwarming with good messages for kids.,1355270400,,117,4.9
2613886,5,B000GI3RGU,"Both of my daughters (7 and 2) love Eloise and her imagination.  This is a cute movie that has Eloise in in her usual trouble (which is ultimately never that bad) and a nicely written rhyming story narrated by Eloise.

I suspect we'll be watching this long after Christmas is over.",1351641600,,281,4.490196078431373
2613887,5,B000GI3RGU,"My daughter and I love Eloise, so it was nice to have Eloise in our home for the holiday season.",1329436800,,96,3.85
2613888,4,B000GI3RGU,"I have a question of length. The description on the items page says that Little Miss Christmas is 66 minutes long, but all the others are 45 minutes long. Is Little Miss Christmas a miss print or is it actually 66 minutes long?",1296864000,,227,4.3023255813953485
2613889,5,B000GI3RGU,"When my daughter was 2-1/2, we got this from the library. She requested it pretty much every day, and we had to renew it 3 times. When we finally ran out of renewals, I decided it was worth the $10 (or whatever small sum it was) to get our own copy. Not only was our child entertained by the antics of all the kids, but turns out, based on comments she made later at Christmastime, she was absorbing the fact that there are many ways people celebrate the December holiday season, which delighted me. We ended up also purchasing the original Eloise story (""Me, Eloise,"" which tells of how Eloise and Yuko meet) on DVD produced with the same cast, which my daughter loves now too.",1201824000,5,678,4.388888888888889
2613890,5,B000GI3RGU,My 3 year old daughter loves Eloise! She's a perfect mixture of polite with a little spunk added in. DVD is perfect length to hold her attention. I will buy more Eloise DVDs.,1200614400,3,174,4.303030303030303
2613891,5,B000GI3RGU,"Our whole family enjoyed Little Miss Christmas! I have 2 daughters 6 and 8, and it captured their attention and imagination amazingly well. It lifted the holiday excitement. The religious themes and icons were very balanced in the storyline... in a way that worked well in our politically correct world. --- bring us more of this kind of Kids entertainment!! -- dad,",1168560000,5,366,4.919354838709677
2613892,5,B000GI3RGU,"3-year old daughter loves this movie.  Now that Christmas has passed (and I've seen this a million times), it's on to Me, Eloise.  Very cute!",1168387200,2,141,4.6

2613894,5,B000GI3RGU,This movie was purchased for the Christmas season and was picked by all three girls who came over for a movie night.,1389312000,,116,4.318181818181818
2613895,5,B000GI3RGU,"Okay, I love this more than my granddaughter who has several other current cartoon characters on Xmas DVDs which she prefers.  I think in a couple of years though she will like it a lot better.",1389225600,,193,4.361111111111111
2613896,1,B000GI3RGU,"An unimpressive effort that manages to ruin the charm of the Eloise stories.  The animation is cheap looking, your garden variety quickie that doesn't even attempt to duplicate the grace of Hilary Knight's illustrations.  The story is an insipid retread of every ""let's put on a show"" plot ever devised.  The MESSAGE is laid on thick and unconvincing, definitely the work of cynical adults who tend to look down on children.  They've turned Mr. Salamone into a snide creep and worst of all, made Eloise a giggling ninny.  The ""children's"" voices don't sound like children at all.  There's a PC attempt to replace Christmas with the all-purpose word, Holiday.  They toss in some occasional rhyme for no apparent reason.  Then have the gall to top it off with a witless platitude: ""Christmas is what you make it.""

In the end, it's just a pointless attempt to cash in on someone else's work.

If you can't do Eloise right, don't do Eloise at all.",1386201600,,944,4.736196319018405

2613902,2,B000GI3RGU,"This is shorter than I would expect a feature film to be.  I didn't realize it was animinated, although that may be my bad.  Content wise, it's a bit shallow and too ""accommodating.""  Nothing in this about the true meaning of CHRISTmas.",1359158400,,236,4.571428571428571
2613903,2,B000GI3RGU,"Possibly if I had never seen the live version ""Eloise at Christmastime"" I would have given animated ""Eloise, Little Miss Christmas"" a better rating, but unfortunately it just doesn't hold a candle to the live version..",1358467200,,218,5.083333333333333
