8094729,5,B000BZ8MYK,"I've been a fan of Bryan Duncan since the mid 80's. I've only seen him live once (it was really great!) but this DVD is AMAZING!!! The music is exceptionally good (what a band he put together!!!) and there's quite a bit of Bryan's great sense of humor through out...The audio that plays at the main menu is HILARIOUS!!! Seriously, my husband and I are both musicians and we knew that Bryan is amazingly talented, but we were just blown away by the musicianship. Add to that the fact that the message in the music is that Jesus loves, forgives and just wants to be involved in people's lives...AWESOME DVD!!! I can't say enough good stuff about it!",1404518400,,647,4.491525423728813

I really like the rewrite of the one song. Buy it, you'll enjoy it.",1400544000,,147,4.285714285714286
8094731,5,B000BZ8MYK,"Duncan has been one of my all-time favorite artists since he started his solo career in the 80's... Great to see him jammin here with such an awesome, soulful band! His voice is as fantastic as ever...",1363910400,,201,4.45945945945946
8094732,5,B000BZ8MYK,"For many of us long time CCM fans, this video and cd are a refreshing new offering from a classic CCM artist.  I have really enjoyed both the CD and DVD.  Considering the price is about 20% of what I spent to see Bryan Duncan live in 1986 I consider this a real value.",1331683200,,268,3.9444444444444446
8094733,4,B000BZ8MYK,"Entertaining, hand-claping and in the groove. If you've never had a chance to catch'em live, here's your chance... Inlightening, toe-tappin' and a'lil bit-a-soul... Not the best camera angles but still a ton of fun...",1142726400,,217,5.411764705882353
