I was concerned when I first tried to play these DVDs because they wouldn't play on my standard TV type DVD player.
BUT, then I realized they could be played in a computer type DVD player. And they play just fine!
So don't worry that these are formatted for 'Region 2'. Most PCs have the software decoders already installed for all regions.
I put the DVD into my external DVD player attached to my laptop (running Windows 7).
When the DVD began to spin up, a window popped-up telling me to change the Region from Region 1 to Region 2. I scrolled down the list of countries provided, found 'Ireland' (which is Region 2, same as Great Britain), clicked 'start', and the DVD ran properly.
Enjoy!",1521590400,,798,4.548611111111111
8658183,5,B00KF9LPBO,"HI, I bought this and I really liked it - the best episodes (in my opinion) That survived are Tunnel Under the World, Level Seven, Stranger in the Family, Welcome Home, Man in My Head and The Machine Stops - the best that were reconstructed are The Yellow Pill and Beach Head. The worst (painful to watch - in my opinion) No place like Earth and The reconstruction of the Naked Sun",1513123200,,381,4.305555555555555
8658184,4,B00KF9LPBO,"I have not bought the dvd set been considering it because it is a bit pricey. I have however seen many of the episodes on the dvd set via betamax tapes sent to me by a friend back in tthe1990s. Rather enjoyed the ones I saw, the series adapts stories of many famous sf authors from the print world. The stories are thus a lot less action oriented than shows such as Star Trek. Like Doctor Who the BBC junked many of the episodes of the programme and some of the missing onea are among the most highly regarded. The B&W episodes from the first 2 seasons are much more of the pure SF variety where as the last 2 seasons made in colour are more of a horror / pscological variety.

Not seen the dvds but am hoping the quality is better than my 20 year old betamax tapes",1449100800,2,765,4.1
