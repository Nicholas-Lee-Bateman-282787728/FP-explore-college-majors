1046091,4,6305562849,"This film is a kind of dual enigma because, while it is a properly light-hearted musical (they all were, but with varying degrees of success), it also boasts a great many oddities- starting with the strange title (exactly what in the film is ""for keeps?""). Esther Williams plays a properly likable, properly beautiful, aquacade star whose relationship with Jimmy Durante (a legend whom I've always enjoyed) should've been that of a father and daughter, but instead is something a tad stranger. Thankfully, this isn't ignored in the film, as her actual love interest (Johnnie Johnston), whom Durante relentlessly 'protects' from Williams, challenges his interference in the film's 11th hour. (While Durante seems to have a bothered conscience about this, it is never confirmed or denied.) Another annoyance, as someone memtioned earlier, is the blowhard opera tenor (Lauritz Melchior) playing Johnston's meddlesome father. After getting past all this stickiness, the film's highlights, which are its musical portions (especially the Cugat numbers and the striptease and swim of ""Ten Percent Off""), can finally be enjoyed.",1039046400,11,1120,5.479768786127168
1046092,5,6305562849,"This is an Esther Williams film, not heard aboutt or shown as often.  It's really good, and well worth watching.  It's one of her best.  It has really nice swin scenes clothes and a pretty good storyline.",1031097600,4,204,4.45945945945946

1046094,4,6305562849,If you're a fan of Jimmy Durante or of the Grand Hotel in Mackinack Island this is a film you'll love.  Durante plays the manager/protector of Esther Williams and he's in prime form.  Esther's OK too if you like that sort of thing.,999820800,7,231,4.348837209302325
1046095,2,6305562849,"This film has the elements of an entertaining film, but fails largely due to the operatic sequences with Lauritz Melchior. He completely spoiled  Esther's THRILL OF A ROMANCE (1945) and only Jimmy Durante keeps him from  drowning this one, too. I don't mind operatic singing, but it just doesn't  belong in a lightweight film like this.",967766400,4,336,4.964285714285714
1046096,4,6305562849,"By 1947, Esther Williams was becoming one of Hollywood's top stars, appearing in a string of lavish, colorful, musical films that usually (but not always!) showcased her championship-level swimming talents.
This Time  for Keeps features Esther as the star of a swimming spectacular (what  else?) who becomes romantically involved with a young WWII veteran trying  to start a career as a popular crooner. (He's played by Johnny Johnston, a  former band vocalist, in his only MGM leading role.) Eventually the two  travel to Mackinac Island, the famous luxury resort town in the state of  Michigan.
Esther has one lavish swim number, following the amusing song  ""10 Percent Off,"" during which she parades in true showgirl  style. And the supporting cast features three talented scene-stealers:  Jimmy Durante, Dame May Whitty, and former Metropolitan Opera star Lauritz  Melchoir.
This film may seem a bit slow and sentimental (or even sticky!)  to modern audiences. But it makes for a pleasing and enjoyable two hours of  entertainment if you're in the mood. Give it a try!",960940800,27,1072,5.1686046511627906

7891317,4,6305562849,"THIS TIME FOR KEEPS pairs Esther Williams with singer Johnny Johnston and co-stars Jimmy Durante and Lauritz Melchior in a formulaic story, very much the standard Esther Williams vehicle, but carried off in high style thanks to its sincere performances and stunning Mackinac Island location filming.

Recently-returned from war service, Dick Johnson (Johnny Johnston) is being groomed by his father, eminent opera star Richard Herald (Melchior) to follow in his footsteps, but Dick is more enamoured with boogie-woogie than Wagner.  During his time in a convalescent hospital after the war, Dick ""met cute"" the celebrity swimming star Leonora Cambaretti (Esther Williams), and the pair reunite backstage after one of Nora's shows.  Pretty soon, Dick is up to his neck in romance - not to mention an exciting job prospect, singing with Xavier Cugat's orchestra - but how will he manage to tell his father... and his snooty fiance?

Despite being headlined by Ms Williams, THIS TIME FOR KEEPS is really Johnny Johnston's show.  He carries most of the singing not to mention that the story heavily revolves around his character with less emphasis on Williams.  Ms Williams nevertheless shines with a brilliant musical number (""Ten Percent Off""), in which she performs a striptease routine and dances the tango with Jimmy Durante in addition to her spectacular swimming.  Child actress Sharon McManus co-stars as Williams' kid cousin Deborah.  McManus was a Margaret O'Brien-type who also specialised in crying on cue, which she does a lot of in this film.

The film really picks up the pace when the story shifts to the Cambaretti mansion on gorgeous Mackinac Island, which we first see in the dead of winter (Johnston, Williams and McManus ride a sleigh and sing ""S'No Wonder They Fell in Love""), before returning again in the spring.  Jimmy Durante performs ""Inka Dinka Doo"" and Melchior has a couple of operatic numbers.  Everybody was well-catered for in this film.

A fun ""lazy weekend"" movie.",1373760000,,1995,5.142414860681114
