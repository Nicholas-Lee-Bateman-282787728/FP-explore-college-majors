It is about Ignaz Wolz who gets injured in World War I and meets medic Ludwig; who only has paper bandages as German industrialists are making more money using the lint to make ladies corsets than provide for the soldiers. Wolz in having a bout of righteous indignation he declares that he will avenge all the German blood left unstaunched because profits were put before people.

Move onto 1919 and he decides to do exactly what he promised and so he starts his own revolution, which is lacking in political dogma being  more Robin Hood in its ambitions than real anarchy. As people flock to his cause so does an intelligent, socialist nurse and between Wolz, Agnes and Ludwig a sort of threesome form. The film follows the ups and downs of all of their exploits.

Now this is a real mix of a film. Part comedy at one point, part political statement and a definite swipe at National Socialism, it is very ambitious and it pulls it all off. It has a great musical score too and the music adds to the moods tenfold. The acting is superb and Regimantas Adomaitis as Wolz is a power house. The print is excellent too looking as fresh as a new film today; in German with good sub titles and at a run of 110 minutes  none of which are wasted, this is truly an exceptional film that I can thoroughly recommend.",1463702400,,1412,4.374045801526718
