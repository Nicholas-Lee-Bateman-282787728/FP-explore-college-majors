7858872,5,6304028474,"Commander Riker has beamed down to Malcoria Three to visit a group of observers from the Federation.  The planet is about to develop warp drive capacity, which is the point at which the Federation makes ""first contact.""  After all, what happens when you first go out into space and discover the UFP, Klingon Empire, Cardassians, Romulans, Tholians, etc.  Unfortunately, Riker is seriously injured during a riot by citizens protesting the development of this new technology and when a routine physical exam reveals he is an alien, he is immediately confined by the Minister of Security.  To resolve the situation, Captain Picard and Counselor Troi beam down and meet with the Malcorian scientist who runs their warp drive program.  Although thrilled to meet strange visitors from another planet (okay, two other planets), the scientist warns that if this news is made public, the citizens will think this is an invasion force.  Picard meets with Chancellor Durken (always nice to see George Coe with a good part to play) and takes the Malcorian leader on a tour of the Enterprise.  Everything is progressing nicely until they learn that Riker has been captured and that the Chancellor's political opponents and the planet's isolationist citizenry are about to find out everything that is going on.
""First Contact"" is a good title because this is certainly the best STNG episode dealing with that particular facet of tooling around the universe.  Ultimately, what makes this an above-average episode is that the resolution is not the proverbial happy ending.  When it provides such twists, STNG is at its best.  ""First Contact"" is not a great episode, but it is a very, very good one indeed.  It also has one of the best cameo appearances in the history of the series as Bebe Neuwirth (Lilith on ""Cheers""/""Fraiser"") plays a Malcorian who has the hots for Riker (there is simply no other way to put it).",977616000,,1900,4.962145110410095
