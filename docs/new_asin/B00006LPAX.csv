1785252,4,B00006LPAX,"This is a bit unusual to say the least for a gundam series. Very different from the ""original gundam series"" (Turn A, MS Team) but still very good. So the whole plot of this story revolves around people moving to the colonies and each colony sends a gundam fighter every 4 years to decide the universal leader. Very strange for one of the gundam series, however, each country's fighter has an in-depth personality. Sai Sici, from NeoChina pilot of the Dragon Gundam is a cheerful, HYPER character, helpful, but a bit unfocused. Then, in a fight with Domon, he changes dramatically.
I must say that this whole anime is a bit strange, firstly, it starts a bit slowly. Domon wins with Shining Finger. . . There are however very good battle scenes such as Domon verses Sai Sici (Shining vs. Dragon) and later in the finals Domon's NEW gundam God vs. Dragon
The drawback about this anime is that it is a bit stereotypical and racist. For example the Gundam Maxter of Neo America, has shoulder pads and a football helmet. It's pilot Chibodee Crocket, is purple-pink haired and has an ""American Dream"". For Neo China, the Dragon Gundam (the basis for the Altron Custom in Gundam Wing) is a dragon basically, although it's pilot is hyper, not really who'd you'd expect from China. For others, the Rose Gundam from Neo France with it's specialty move, Rose Bits and it's pilot, a Bishounen fighter, ""civilized"" and a noble. Neo Russia steals technology from other countries, and there is the Tequila Gundam from Neo Mexica (and piloted by some drunk), the Mermaid Gundam from Neo Denmark, and many others.
No matter what these drawbacks, this is still a GREAT anime, and is MUCH better than Gundam Wing no matter what people tell you. The animation may be a bit shabby at the beginning but purchase these DVD's and just enjoy!",1035504000,2,1817,4.699059561128527
1785253,5,B00006LPAX,"I have seen this series already in the original Japanese language, and I have to admit that the Japanese version is indeed better than the one currently airing in America. The voices fit the characters better, and the voice actors put more feeling and emotion into the voices. For example, instead of adding an echo to Dommon's voice to simulate anger and excitement, the Japanese voice actors actually yelled, which was much more convincing and added more emotional impact. Rain's English voice also bugs me quite a bit. Changing the names of the Gundams was also a stupid move as well. How stupid does Mummy Gundam sound? I prefer the original Pharoah Gundam; also Minaret Gundam (Scimitar), Kowloon Gundam (Haow), Mandala Gundam (Mandor) and others. The three that upset me were the changes from God Gundam to Burning Gundam; Devil Gundam to Dark Gundam; and Gundam Heaven's Sword to Raven Gundam. I loved this series when I watched it in Japanese, but the English version is a total joke. There are too many disappointments that ruin this great series.",1035417600,2,1056,4.905027932960894
1785254,5,B00006LPAX,"When i first heard this Gundam series was coming to America, i thought it would bomb big time. All the Gundams are ethnically themed. Such as Mexico's Gundam has a giant metal sumbrero, and a little mustache. Anyways, i thought it would be stupid, but some how, it wasn't. Like most anime series, it starts off okay, and ends awesomely. The plot twists in the end are excellent! This Gundam really is good, if you can over look the sometimes silly looking Gundams.",1035244800,2,464,4.602409638554217
1785255,5,B00006LPAX,"First of, I would like to say that Gundam still remains the top Mecha Anime around, and will stay so for a LONG time. Well, I've seen every episode of G Gundam up to now, and I have to say that it is a great Gundam series. A lot like Gundam Wing, it is set in an alternate universe, where a tournament is held every year to see which Gundam is strongest. First off, the storyline is good, the action is good and frequent, and the animation, like Gundam Wing. A lot. Well, I will get this DVD when it comes out, and I know I will enjoy it. 5 out of 5.",1034121600,,550,3.8761061946902653
1785264,5,B00006LPAX,"This is actually one of the better gundam series.  It has an incredible storyline where the main charcaters all over come a barrier.  The ending was superb and everything i expected it to be.  The only flaws in this series were that the Shining/burning finger got repetitive and Domon used this move OVER AND OVER.  The other flaw i found was some of the mech designs were a joke.  Look at the Nobel Gundam from Neo Sweden.  Thats just pathetic.  Although its pilot Allenby was pretty cool, this gundam was just stupid.  The dialoge got a bit corny at times, but that really isn't the shows fault.  I felt embaressed for the voice actors when Chibodee's cheerleaders were chanting his name.  Now on to its good points.  It is full of plot turns near the end.  The music is amazing.  It isn't just some crappy rock hybrid like in New Report G Wing.  (nothing against rock or the series as i love them both).  The music truly has an asian feel to it.  Its also quite entertaining to see what Japan thinks of other countries.  Look at Chibodee.  He's a punk!  This also has the best love story in the whole series.  The main chars aren't just Newtypes who magically understand each other.  Rain and Domons relationship grows throughout the gundam saga.  All in all, it truly lives up to the gundam name.  If all the worlds problems could be solved with giant mechs......

1785265,5,B00006LPAX,"...Well this kinda isn`t like all of the rest of gundam series. Every four years or so,the colonies
have a gundam of gundams tournament. The last nation`s gundam that`s standing in the end will win. The series is based on Neo
Japan`s fighter, Domon Kasshu. Domon pilots the Shining Gundam,
Along with his crewmember,Rein Mikamora. The reason Domon has ent-
ered the tournament is to get revenge on his brother Kioji. Kioji
pilots the Dark Gundam,A powerful gundam,but I don`t want to spoil it. One other thing that I forgot to mention is that YOU are
the gundam. So basically that means if one your gundam arms get
cut off(your arm doesn`t get cut off)you feel the pain. Same with
your leg,etc. And it`s all because of this suit you have to put on
But if your head gets cut off,you don`t feel the pain(thank good-
ness),but you lose the match. The dubbing from Japanese to American isn`t all that great,but the fighting is right on.
Rated 7 and up:cartoon violence. READY?!....GGGOOO!!!",1036454400,,986,4.738372093023256
1785266,5,B00006LPAX,"The one thing that drew me to watch this series was the fact that it was directed by Yasuhiro Imagawa (Giant Robo, Getter Robo Armageddon). I absolutely love his work and G-Gundam stays true to his talent and stlye.
The story takes place in the year Future Century 60 and it's time for the next Gundam fight to decide who will rule Earth. This alone could have drove the story, but there is also a side story involving the Devil Gundam (aka Dark Gundam). Obviously, the story centers around Neo-Japan's fighter, Domon Kashu who pilots the Shining Gundam during the first season. He also followed by the fighters from Neo-America, Neo-China, Neo-France and Neo-Russia.
The one nit-pick that I know everyone will have with this series is the changed names of the Gundams. Almost half of all the Gundams in this series have their names changed. However, the subtitled version has all the names uncut. Also, there is an issue with the mobile suit designs that they are all stereotypes of other nations. It's not that big of a deal since the pilots aren't that stereotypical. I was actually pleased with the mecha designs considering they could come up with so many in this 49-episode series. There has got to be atleast 25 different Gundams in this show. It's actually quite amazing.
The packaging is pretty slick. The box is sturdy and all the cases for the discs include on the back of the cover a rule of the Gundam fight regulations. The menu for the scene selection is actually a map of the world where Domon is currently at. While this is good for now, Bandai might have to do some reworking with that menu since the next couple of episodes are centrally located around Shinjuku and the Gienna Islands. The extras on the discs includes an interview with the series director that I had a lot of fun reading.
Overall, these episodes are pretty much filler episodes for the real plot of the first season, but they are some-what entertaining and addictive. If your a fan of Giant Robo or Getter Robo, I highly recommend watching this series.",1036281600,,2039,4.666666666666667
1785267,4,B00006LPAX,"Alright for some of those who have been confused by this show or have been initially off-put by it`s nature, here's a brief history lesson. In 1994 as the Gundam approached it's 15th anniversary the franchise's popularity was seriously flagging.  The last two entries in the Universal Century Saga, the motion picture Gundam F91, and television series Victory Gundam  had failed grasp a hold of the imagination of anime fans the way the older Gundam series had done. Older fans were gradually turning away from the series, and new fans were scared off by the thick continuity of the UC saga. In short to keep the franchise running, something drastic had to be done. Thus the first of the ""Alternate Universe"" Gundam series was conceived, paving the way for Gundam Wing, Gundam X, Turn-A Gundam, and the current Gundam SEED. Had G-Gundam failed these shows might have never made it off the drawing boards.
While this show remains the most controversial of the alternate universes and I can understand why some Gundam purists might have problems with this series, I feel it's place in history must be respected. Had G-Gundam not succeeded, the Gundam Franchise may have crumbled in the early 90s and may have never been brought to America. It like some other older franchises would sadly be unknown to casual anime fans.
 Initially created as a parody of sorts, G-Gundam was conceived by Yasuhiro Imagawa, who would prove to make a career out of re-imagining old shows with such series as Giant Robo and Getta Robo Armageddon. The show also helped launch the career of Kimitoshi Yamane who went on to design mecha for shows like Cowboy Bebop and Escaflowne.
 The series is a mesh of elements from the original Gundam universe, super-robot shows such as Mazinger Z,  martial arts anime such as DBZ and Saint Seya, and video games like Street fighter. It's an exciting mixture of eye-catching designs with insane fights that never takes itself too seriously.
 G-Gundam is set in a world in which the vast majority of humanity has moved to space. War has been banned, but tensions still flair up... thus prompting the need for the Gundam Fight. A vast international tournament held every 4 years with the victor's nation winning absolute power. However as a number of flamboyant (sometimes somewhat stereotypical) combatants from each nation duke it out at the 13th Gundam fight, something strange is at hand. Pivotal in all of this is a mysterious man by the name of Domon Kashu who wanders the earth his mechanic/love interest Rain, looking for a man in an old photograph. Meanwhile a mysterious metallic monstrosity called the Devil Gundam (later renamed Dark Gundam for the US Dub) lurks.
 Sadly this first set contains some of the weakest episodes in the series as Domon comes across as a bit of a brash jerk initially until we learn where he's coming from, and it`s obvious that the crew was still experimenting with the world they were creating. Still there's a lot to like about these episodes mecha mayhem abounds and the plot unveils itself.
So in short if you're an anime fan of any type I recommend checking this series out. If you are a Gundam fan initially put off by this series (as I was) I recommend giving it a second chance. You'll be pleasantly surprised. This box set is a fine way to check out the show as it's very reasonably priced, and features the original Japanese dialog track (superior to the show's so-so dub.)
Who is Domon Kashu?  Who is the mysterious man he is searching for?  What is the Devil Gundam? And just how does a mysterious group known as the shuffle alliance play into this?  Check out this set and find out.  Gundam Fighter's set?  Reaaaaadddddddy Gooooooooooo!!",1036195200,5,3702,4.794348508634223
1785268,4,B00006LPAX,"Just when you thought you've seen it all, G Gundam throws it right back at ya. G Gundam, in a nutshell, is Street Fighter and Dragonball Z mixed with Gundam. At first, I thought it sounded lame, but as it progressed, I grew to like it. Also, unlike Mobile Suit Gundam and Gundam Wing, G Gundam actually has good characters. Domon's not whiny like Amuro or suicidal like Heero. And unlike Gundam Wing, the women on G Gundam actually look like woman and are not too muscular. THe Gundam fights are cool, but when you're watching it, you feel like you're watching Dragonball Z or Street Fighter. It plays more akin to Capcom's Dreamcast mecha-based fighting game, Tech Romancer. Overall, this is a worthy addition to the fine Gundam series. Semper Fi, carry on.",1036108800,,758,4.664179104477612
1785269,5,B00006LPAX,"G Gundam is not better then the main gundam  series,GUNDAM WING!First of all, G Gundam is nothing like the gundam series.  Gundam wing is about
""Centuries in the future, in the year After Colony 195, Earth is surrounded by orbiting space colonies. The colonists are cruelly oppressed by the Earth Alliance, which uses huge humanoid fighting machines called ""mobile suits"" to control the populace. Behind this tyranny is the secret society called ""Oz,"" which has infiltrated the Alliance military and steered it towards its repressive course.
Now, the space colonies are ready to strike back. Five young pilots, equipped with advanced mobile suits called ""Gundams,"" are sent to Earth to wage guerilla war against Oz and its Alliance puppets. ""
G Gundam is about fighter from different nations trying to win as many matches as they can without losing to be involed in the Gundam tornement in hong kong.  Whoever wins the tournement gains control of space for the next 4 years.  The main character is Domon Kasshu, Neo Japan's
fighter.  I would buy the gundam wing boz set(13 and up) rather then the G Gundam set if you were older and a true anime fan.  If you were a kid I would buy G Gundam(7 and up) because you will be able to understand it much easier.",1035849600,3,1254,4.729357798165138
1785270,5,B00006LPAX,"When one thinks of gundam, space opera often pops into mind.  War, government, backstabbing, betrayal, and lots and lots of political criss-crossing.  Well, G-Gundam has some of that, but it isn't the main focus of the show.  The fighting setup is somewhat cheesy at first, and even I had my reservations when I first viewed the series, but I gave it time.  What I ended up finding was a Gundam series that operates on a much more personal level than previous gundams.  U.S. fans familiar to the Wing series should recall the lengths taken to flesh out each of the main characters in that series, but it can't compare to how much emotion oozes out of the primary fighters in G-Gundam.  Once the series finally makes it to the final matches of the gundam fight, you WILL have a favorite character(mine was Schwarz), and you WILL be excited about every part he/she plays in the story.  Basically, don't think of this series as Gundam turning away from the space war tradition to turn into a kung-fu chopsocky show, look deeper and you'll see that this series is a very rewarding character study that just takes a while to fully grab you.  Beware, once you start watching, you'll be angry if you have to stop or miss an episode! ^_^",1035763200,,1229,4.579908675799087
1785271,4,B00006LPAX,"Many, many people will pass up this series beacause of the goofy looking mobile fighters, almost DBZ-type antics, and because of the fact that it's a Super Robot show. Well those people are missing out on yet another great Gundam series. The plot goes way beyond the ""Gundam Fight"" tournament. And so what if it's a Super Robot show? I like super robots. Like a lot of the more recent, non-Universal Century Gundam shows, the first few episodes of this series are pretty so-so, until you get to the main plot, which centers around Domom Kasshu (the fighter for Neo-Japan and the Shining Gundam's pilot)'s search for his brother, who has stolen the evil Devil (Dark) Gundam. Once the plot picks up, this series can get very, very engrossing. Also, while the initial fights aren't that exiting, the ones later on in the series are VERY exiting.
At the very least, it's better than Gundam Wing. (You can say that about every other Gundam series, too, as well as most other anime in general.)",1035590400,3,988,4.683908045977011
1785272,5,B00006LPAX,"I was first kind of steptical on how this series was going to turn out, but after watching the cartoon network version I have lost all of my regrets. The series was just plain awesome, I enjoyed every moment of it. To me the series felt like across between Dragon Ball Z, because of all the fighting and Cowboy Bebop because the main character in G Gundam Domon Kasshu remindes me of Spike Spiegel ( because all of the martial arts.)
If you are a fan of DBZ, Cowboy Bebop, or any other type of martial arts anime then this series for you. Caution though some gundam fans may dislike this series, because of its different over all style.",1035504000,,636,4.352941176470588

7971628,4,B00006LPAX,"Mobile Fighter G Gundam is probably the most misunderstood Gundam series ever it is hated by both gundam wing and UC fans because of the bizarre story and weird mecha, however it still has a faithful fan club. I have seen every Gundam Series to date and when having chatted on many Gundam forums there is no topic so hotly debated over. I personally like G Gundam its wacky story and characters make it one of my favorite alternate universe series, it has a pretty good story line and a good soundtrack(which is not available in the US). This series premiered when I was in Tokyo and I must say I was quite impressed, this series is definitely better than Gundam Wing And Gundam Seed but has and acquired taste. There is not really much I can tell you in a review of this series you have to see it for yourself, some people love it others hate it.",1132876800,,847,4.333333333333333
7971629,5,B00006LPAX,"It was almost 5 years since I first watch G Gundam when it was aired in a local channel here in our country. It's still fresh in my memory on how I rush to get home early after school just to watch it to see more of Domon and Rain. Hehe... I absolutely love the two of them. I fell in love with this series because of its excellent plot. Unlike other Gundam series, G Gundam focuses more on character development and their relationship with one another. I highly recommend this series to all anime lovers. It's worth every penny. (^_^)",1129852800,,535,4.306930693069307

It focuses more on the characters & less on stupid machines than other sereis, plus I'm a sucker for retro anime. Maybe this one's just for us ladies.",1128816000,,318,4.406779661016949
7971631,5,B00006LPAX,"Despite it being a 180 degree turn away from the U.C. era Gundams, i really loved this series. I, like many other americans, saw it for the first time when it was aired on Cartoon Networks Toonami(anyone remeber Toonami?)in the afternoons. First of all, all of the s h i t heads dissing this series can go f**k off and die. This was the last great Gundam series before the horrible Gundam Wing commercialized the franchice and the writters started to aim towards the 13 year old crowd. This is the last time you are acctauly going to see characters with depth, growth and development of a solid story line. Domon Kashu is indeed powerful, but he is still outclassed consistantly by considerably more powerful fighters(such as Master Asia,Shwartz Brutter ect) all through out the series untill the very end. Domon is very much an emotional person ruled by his anger, but he evolves out of this immaturity through the series to where he is a much improved character, both better as a fighter and a person. Now compare this to Hero (of Wing), who is basically an emotionless robot through out the series, and has no development or connection to the viewer, unless of course you are also a robot or a communist, or both. Call me crazy, but somehow i just don't feel connected to a character who is virtually unstoppable with no weakness or likeablity for that matter. G Gundam is a very good series IMHO, this sure beats all of the crap future Gundams that came out after it. After this, the Gundam franchice basically became emotionaly challenged teenagers in indestructable moblie suits, who somehow, at that young age(what, 15,16 or 17?), are experinced enough in combat to take out whole armies and come out of battles unscathed.

This sure beats the s h i t out of Wing.

7971633,3,B00006LPAX,"So, G Gundam has made it's way to US shores. For those of you who are wondering if it's worth investing in, then my answer is a loud YES! If you have an open mind you'll likely love this series as I do. Don't listen to all the reviewers who call it an insult to Gundam or Gundam Ball Z, because they're very wrong. G Gundam is more of a tribute to the super robot shows that spawned Gundam in the late 70's. There are no DBZ-esque drawn out scenes or people who can destroy a planet with their thumb. Instead we get to-the-point battles, along with a great plot and great characters. Unlike Wing, the cast are more like their UC ancestors as they change and grow. The character of Domon, who mainly shows anger in these first 12 episodes, goes through alot of emotional events. You understand and feel for him as he goes through various trials. The same can be said for the rest of the cast who are equally develloped through the course of this 49 episode series.
Fans such as myself who were upset with the renames for the dub get some consolation in the fact that Bandai retains the original names in the subtitles. However, it would of been nice to hear the dub cast refer to such Gundams as Tequilla (renamed Spike) and Lumber (renamed Grizzly) by their original names. Other then trailers, the only real extra is parts of an interview with the show's director, Imagawa, which reveal what inspired certain episodes and answer certain unanswered questions. Nice as these are, I hope Bandai manage to include textless versions of the 3 openings and 2 closings at some point.
As I said earlier, buy this if you have an open mind. It's a great little series and an interesting break from the constant ""Earth vs Spacenoids"" conflicts of all the other Gundam shows",1049932800,6,1762,4.492211838006231

The drawbacks to this series is mainly that the characters get annoying. by the end of the series the only person youll be liking is Fuunsiki cuz he doesnt talk.
On the other side it has a very good plot and the best mecha out of almost any anime out there. If it wasn't turned so child oriented by Cartoon Network more people would probably like it (same with almost any anime on cartoon network).
