7953420,5,B00005T330,"I love the FIRM but I like FIRM classic the best.  Since i didn't have the cash to buy all the individual volumes yet i bought the Four pack to get a good mix of the classic tapes.  Tough Tape 2 is exactly that TOUGH.  I was sweating and moving and truly felt like i was building muscle.
5 Day Abs is a love of my life because iuse dit in high school and it got me flat for prom so it is a staple in my workout.
Upper Body was a Killer! i love the movements and i was sore for two days b/c i used new weights and went heavy but my arms and shoulders look great for it.
Standing legs is another killer which will leave you tired and exhilerated all at the same time.  I love a lower body challenge and that's what it gave me.
You will need a few peices of equiptment but they are written on the back of each tape with this set so you can prepare.  A step, a Dowel or weighted bar, free weights in varying poundage, a mat, towel (cause you will sweat) and plenty of water.
Have fun, exercise and love your body.",1074470400,4,1009,3.902439024390244

7953422,4,B00005T330,"I recently purchased this 4-pack and have found it's a great way to ""spice up"" my workout week.  Both the Upper Body and Standing Legs tapes are quite the workout (and they cram in a lot of punch for only 35-45 min.), and I will do maybe 20 min. of plain (without weights) cardio to warm up beforehand.  I have a tendency to get bored if my routine is too unvaried, so these provide a great way to change it up and keep my attention.  Plus, you can just pay attention to your body's desires and say, ""hm, today my arms really feel like working.  Let's do Upper Body!""
Tough Tape 2 is just that--really tough!  It's a good alternative to one of the Total Body videos, if you feel like doing more weights and less cardio (although you do get your cardio simply from hefting those weights around the whole time).  The transitions between segments can be somewhat sloppy, but once you do the tape a few times you know what's coming next and can prepare for it.
5-Day Abs is a great addition to any collection....the short workouts are intense.  I used to just fast-forward my Total Body video to the abs section and do it alone, but this has done it for me, and gives me the abs sections for tapes I don't own, too.
Bear in mind that this collection requires a step or box in all the videos (although in 5-Day Abs, it's just for putting your feet on as you lay on the floor).  If you don't care to buy one from The Firm company, you can find suitable ones at the store ... in the housewares department.  They're sturdy, have little rubber feet to keep from slipping, and are about the right height.  Standing Legs also allows you to use a barbell, if you have one, but if you don't, that's fine (that particular section is hard enough even without any weight!).  You could probably also substitute just putting weights on your shoulders, as you do earlier in the video.
If you crave variety in your workout week, this package is a great choice!",1042156800,18,1940,4.346260387811634
7953423,4,B00005T330,"I love The Firm workout series and this set is worth the money.  While all tapes in the set are compilations of previous releases, it doesn't seem to matter.  The way that the segments are combined, keeps one engaged even when having seen the moves multiple times... except for the case of the abs tape.  These are great ab routines, but if you happen to own the tapes which the ab sections come from (volumes 1-6), then it's a bit boring. But, Tough Tape 2 is great as is the Standing Legs tape (both killers).  The Upper body tape isn't as good, partially due to the ""instructor"" and to the over abundance of one arm rows, but it's a tough workout, and of good length.  While there are better tapes from The Firm on the market, this set is nice, due to the concentration on specific areas, the results it produces and its price.",1024358400,30,830,4.363636363636363
