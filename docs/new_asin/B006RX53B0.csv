8503683,4,B006RX53B0,"I have and love instructor Mark Laham's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yin-Yoga-DVD/dp/B006RX5ZFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yin Yoga DVD</a>, and so I was curious about this one as well.  It is labelled Power Yoga, but as I will explain further, the routines are not at the fast-pace that most people would expect of a ""power"" yoga practice.  Rather, Laham's teaching is slow and methodical here, quick similar to his Yin DVD, yet presenting a much stronger practice.

This DVD is shot indoors in a large, somewhat industrial-looking room.  Laham instructs live, using the same three female students featured in his Yin DVD.  Although Laham does not practice himself, he is sometimes shown in an inset performing modifications; his students offer different levels of the postures as well.

The Main Menu has options for Introduction - Start Practice - Special Features - Music Setup.  Choosing ""Start Practice"" brings you to a submenu that allows you to choose one of two warm-ups, Beginner or Intense.  Once you choose your warm-up, you have the option of continuing with the warm-up alone OR adding on one of two sequences, Strengthen the Core or Open the Hips.  I have described each segment in greater detail below.

BEGINNERS WARM-UP (20 minutes)
Laham describes this segment has having more ""foundational"" instructions.
Begin in spread-leg child's pose.  Move through several rounds of cat/cow, then come into downward facing dog.  Step forward to the front of the mat.
Complete several rounds of Sun Salutation A at a slow pace.  Move into several rounds of Sun Salutation B, including a low lunge in this sequence.

INTENSE WARM-UP (18 minutes)
This is a more flowing segment with less breaks.
Start in spread-leg child's pose.
More right into Sun Salutation A.  Perform several rounds, including 3-legged dog with arm balance.  Continue into several rounds of Sun Salutation B.  End with three fast rounds of warrior lunge, moving from side-to-side.

STRENGTHEN THE CORE (38.5 minutes)
Start in crocodile pose; move through forearm plank to downward dog to plank to upward dog to side plank (both sides).
Back through down dog to standing splits, jet airplane (warrior 3), standing knee balance, and vinyasa to warrior series (warrior 1, warrior 2, side angle, exhaled warrior).  Repeat on second side.
Perform crow pose with option to move into one-legged crow.  Back to plank, then boat pose.
Move to lying on back for reclined core work, including reaching through wide legs, side crunch, leg lowers, and eagle arms isometric hold.
Come to happy baby; move to lying on stomach for back strengthening/back bending work.  Return to lying on back for bridge, then wheel two times.  Finish with lying spinal twist, pose of the west (seated forward bend) and short (1 minute) relaxation.

OPEN THE HIPS (45 minutes)
Start in lunge; move through dragonfly and gecko poses.  Repeat on second side.
Perform fire hydrant, gecko, and optional half-diamond; coming into downward facing dog.  Repeat on second side.
From 3-legged down dog, come into pigeon, with a long hold, optional twist, and backbend.  Switch sides.
Balance sequence includes warrior 3, half moon, and revolved half moon; after repeating on second side, move through vinyasa to come to seated.
Perform seated spinal twist (both sides) and then smiling cow face pose.
From butterfly, move into tripod stand (3-legged upward plank).  Conclude seated work with west stretch (seated forward bend); repeat on other side.
With crossed legs, perform lying spinal twist on both sides.  Finish practice with very short relaxation (<1 minute).

In addition to the above, the ""Special Features"" on this DVD include some tips by Laham on how to perform some of the upper body strength moves as well as a preview of his Yin DVD.

As noted, I really like Laham.  I think his slow, gently coaxing style is perfectly suited to his Yin DVD, where you are encouraged to stay in postures for up to five minutes.  Here, Laham, has the same soft-spoken personality, but somehow, it seemed less suited to these strength-based practices.  This is a well-done DVD in its own right--the choice of different chapters is especially nice--but for me, it just was not as good a fit as Laham's other DVD.  However, I would definitely recommend it to more experienced yogis (low intermediate and above) looking for a slow, strength-building practice.",1432425600,3,4435,5.2
