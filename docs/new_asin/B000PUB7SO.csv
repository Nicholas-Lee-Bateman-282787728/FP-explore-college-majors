8193502,5,B000PUB7SO,"OK people, for some reason I end up to constantly review animes that will most probably become available sometime later on. Anyway, I will try to provide you with a brief outline so as for you to grasp the overall picture of this anime.

To the story:
For this review I will avoid to go into so much terminology but I will try to maintain an overall story-outline. Well, the story is as follows: The main protagonist who comes from a powerful family that has the ability to wield fire (in other words, firebenders) gets his a** kicked big time during a test that he had to undergo when he was young. This resulted in him being kicked out of the family and send abroad. Five years pass and he returns to Japan. Now the family has decided to give something like a holy-sword to a young teenager female who will eventually become the ruler of the family. Nevertheless, other families that are able to bend other elements have started to fight each other. In this war members of all families are killed. But what causes most of them to wander is the return of the main protagonist, to question his motives and actions, and who not only has switched in controlling an element (meaning, from firebender he became a windbender, sorry for any possible wrong terminology) but he also is a contractor; a contractor is a person that surpasses any element user in power and that is due to the fact that this person has a direct contract with a king of an element, in other words, making this person super powerful.

So what makes this anime worth watching?
Well, first of it is its storyline which is solid, action packed and has many twists in it. Second, the romance that will arise between the main protagonist and the leader of the firebenders. Third, the twists that occur as the story progresses and which will become emotional. Finally, the character development of all the main figures of the story which will be perfectly illustrated with flashbacks etc.

As for the animation and the music:
The animation is pretty good living up to today's standards and expectations easily. As for the opening and closing songs they fall into the category of pop/rock and are very good as well. As for the music that accompanies the series it is very well orchestrated and matches the mood of the series.

Worth buying it or not:
Frankly, it is definitely worth watching and buying BUT with the ridiculous prices that are currently posted here safe your money. Put in other terms, a wonderful anime is `killed' by the prices here.

I hope that I could help you a little bit...",1225584000,,2559,4.590809628008753
