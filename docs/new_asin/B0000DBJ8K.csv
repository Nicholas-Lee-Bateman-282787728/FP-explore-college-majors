8000390,5,B0000DBJ8K,"My grand kids (ages 6 and 4) have fallen in love with Casper.  While ordering each of them a DVD of Casper to put in their Halloween baskets, I realized that it is hard to know which ones to order. I have found there is no product information about which episodes are on each DVD and some of the cartoons overlap onto other DVD. Some reviews are helpful as they list the episodes, so I will list which ones come on this disk.  I haven't opened this as it is a gift, but the front says By the Old Mill Scream PLUS 9 other cartoons.  When I flip it over these are the titles listed:

Boo Scout
Boo Kind to Animals
Boos and Arrows
Bull Fright
By the Old Mill Scream
Cage Fright
Casper Comes to Clown
Casper Genie
Casper Takes A Bow Wow

That only lists 9 total so I don't know if something else is on it.  The running time listed is 60 minutes.  Hope this list is helpful to you in picking out a DVD you will enjoy.",1253664000,3,912,4.005524861878453
8000391,4,B0000DBJ8K,"I like to get old cartoons from the ""Golden Age"" of TV because they represent a connection between my childhood and that of our two little daughters, 2 and 7.  Casper started back in 1954, before I even saw a TV, but the kids love it.  The DVD has been enhanced, the Friendly Ghost never looked so good.",1155600000,,303,4.206896551724138

8000393,5,B0000DBJ8K,"There's nothing fancy about this DVD, no real extras to speak of. But you just get a bunch of solid, good-looking Casper cartoons from the 1950s. The picture and sound is good, the stories delightful. My children love watching them and they make a nice compliment to some of the more hyper cartoons of today. The only note is that because they are from the 50s, there are some things that are not so P.C., such as sterotypical portrayals of Native Americans, etc.",1075766400,12,463,4.590361445783133
