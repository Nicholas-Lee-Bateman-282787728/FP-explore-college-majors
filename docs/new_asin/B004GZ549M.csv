8429107,4,B004GZ549M,"At first I thought this movie was going to be too clever for its own good--a biographical movie about someone trying to make a movie about someone who spent decades trying to make his own movie, an autobiographical movie about his own life.

Alexander Olch's finished movie about an unfinished movie by Dick Rogers is all of that, but then it stops drawing attention to that clever conceit and instead becomes much more profound. In the process of showing that Dick Rogers had trouble making a movie out of his own life primarily because he had trouble making any coherent sense out of his own life, this movie says a lot about life in general. Or at least, about life, as well as death, as experienced by very privileged people. What does life mean, what is life's purpose, and what is there to strive for, when you already have what most people still wish they had?

This movie is also about acting, both in movies and in real life. Raw footage and narrated journal entries reveal that Rogers wasn't comfortable in the life that his family provided for him, and then tacitly expected him to lead as an adult. Roger merely acted the way he was supposed to, all the while knowing that he's acting, and hating himself for obeying the social milieu that tells him how he's supposed to act. Knowing full well that all such revelations about himself and other WASP elitists are totally clichd didn't seem to help in his quest to create something more meaningfully original.

A murky undertow of guilt comes also through in this movie's patched-together portrait of Rogers. I think it's a guilty conscience--a gnawing awareness of the sort felt by some members of the American old-money elite, an awareness of the sort that's explored much more fully in Wallace Shawn's work. It's a sense that despite Utopian appearances, there's something rotten in the Hamptons. And so, how appropriate it is that Shawn appears in this movie (he and Rogers had been friends in ""real"" life), helping Olch to ponder, and even to act out at times, the search for a more meaningful life that such a stricken conscience compelled Rogers to undertake. This movie, then, like Shawn in many of his writings, is more firmly honest than Rogers seemed capable of being, about who and what he himself was--a man who never earned all that he had, and a man who may have basically refused to embrace it because he knew he hadn't earned it, and therefore felt he didn't deserve it.",1305504000,3,2447,4.686046511627907
8429108,2,B004GZ549M,"I didn't respond to this self-indulgent, unnecessary, misguided yawn of a film. I can sympathize with the effort to give exposure to the film maker by his student/biographer, but the product was, to me, a dull, almost silly, attempt to present a 'serious' philosophical piece.
I can't say anymore, mainly because I'm boring myself with the effort.",1302739200,,347,5.105263157894737
8429109,4,B004GZ549M,"Richard ""Dickie"" Rogers (1944-2001) was born to a life of privilege--most of the footage presented here is of the Hamptons & Harvard-- but he always felt guilty that he did not do more to earn that privilege. So although he shot more than 200 hours of footage of the Hamptons in the years between 1944-2001 & some very choice footage of Harvard in the 70's, his feelings about these locales were always complicated. These locales certainly had much to tell him about himself, and the kind of self that he assembled had much to say about these locales, but he never assembled all of this ripe footage & commentary into a cohesive documentary that would also have been a cohesive autobiography.

In some ways Dickie's narrative, or at least the collection of narrative strands assembled here by Alexander Ochs, is not an uncommon one: privileged son feels oppressed by his own family history, feels pressured to accomplish something & do the family name proud, but feels woefully inadequate to live up to the precedent that's been set & so rebels by retreating into the world of art, but ultimately finds he cannot escape the past (especially not the family money) & must come to terms with it.

There are two possible outcomes to this familiar story: prodigal son finally breaks free by defining himself by his own actions/accomplishments or prodigal son finally become comfortable/complacent with the life that was readymade for him. Both endings are equally cliched and Dickie knew this. One of Dickie's biggest assets/liabilities was his ivy league education that made him painfully aware that whatever direction his life took would be equally cliched. The only way to avoid cliche was to avoid living/telling any story at all.

There is an undeniable beauty in this film because Dickie had an undeniable visual sense. Since his own self & story were always too painful to fully inhabit, he seems to have found a way of using his camera as a way of transcending or erasing the self: when the camera was rolling he did not exist. So the few images of Dickie that are included here show a man at odds with himself, with his own presence in the world.

When Dickie found out that he only had a short time to live, he greeted this almost as welcome news. Finally, he had no more future to worry about, no pressure to become anything, and the fact that he knew he had so little time left made his existence, at last, seem tolerable.",1301097600,3,2429,4.721698113207547
