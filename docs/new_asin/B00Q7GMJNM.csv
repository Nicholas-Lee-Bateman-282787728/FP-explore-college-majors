8690682,5,B00Q7GMJNM,This guy knows more about kyusho than most people who train.  he works as a police officer and has used kyusho techniques to arrest close to a thousand druggies who did not want to be arrested .  So when someone writes there is too much fluff they are usually someone that does not understand kyusho jitsu but like to write negative stuff because they are ignorant.,1483056000,,365,4.515151515151516
