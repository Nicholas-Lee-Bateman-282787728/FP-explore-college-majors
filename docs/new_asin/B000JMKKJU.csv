Terrible movie... really bad.",1181520000,,147,4.444444444444445
2678112,2,B000JMKKJU,"Well, yes guys, it's bad plus it got Stan the Man's name on it, shame. Anyway: don't ignore the fact that this is just a TV-production.",1179532800,,135,4.230769230769231
2678113,1,B000JMKKJU,"all right, this movie sucked. there's no way around that. they shouldn't even try to make movies like this that require a budget that don't have it available. you would think that Stan Lee would have a quite immeasurable budget for side projects after the Spiderman series, but this movie makes it obviously clear that he isn't receiving funds for those flicks.

as for the storyline outside of the obvious budget deficits---
the villian, Python, not scary. Hulk was scarier then this and he was a good guy. no reason at this point to even concern yourself with anything else. this was it, the Python and that's it. well, him and a whole bunch of useless extra lackies. why do these movies even make an effort of using extras? they don't add at all to the overall movie. minus a few points for using extra extras.

i don't think i have to go too far on to tell you this movie is pointless. if stan lee thought it was a good idea to stamp his name on this rather then spiderman then he was doing something with Jack Daniels, Corona, and Bacardi at the same time. they shouldn't have even incorperated his name on this one, even as a side project. i hate to give such a negative review, but after seeing Spiderman 3 and knowing where the comics can go, this is a great disappointment. even after spiderman 2 this is still bad. this is a B- Movie to the extreme.

this is one of those terribly underfunded performances that make you wonder ""WHY?"" Why would you spend 100,000 dollars when you have 100's of millions at your disposal. i really feel sorry for the actors who were incoperated into this movie.",1178928000,,1602,4.460750853242321
2678114,1,B000JMKKJU,"First of all, Simon from American Idol could not delagate enough of a verbal beat down for how fricken bad this movie was.  It was ridiculous, Date with Drew had more special effects.  Tron has been super speed stuff that looked more believable.  What can I say it was so bad I was shocked that someone even glanced at it and said sure, it's done let's go with this version.

I got to believe that Stan Lee was black mailed to either have his name on this, or be seen in a Jacuzzi with Michael Jackson and one of Macaulay Culkin's little brothers, and even then, I couldn't see how he would do it

Al least these other reviews are right but only the 1 star ratings.  I swear to god may my death come tomorrow if I lie, this movie was mentally retarded and much worse than I'm saying.  Literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen make it to Blockbuster (very short list), much worse than The Crow 4 with Edward Furlong and btw Crow 4 was pretty bad.

Thank god there is no lightspeed, hey boners, don't start a tard thread about Lightspeed vs Flash, not this joke movie.

2678115,1,B000JMKKJU,"LIGHTSPEED may be the worst superhero film ever made.  What was Stan Lee thinking of?  The special effects are ludicrous and the story is abysmal.  It also has four of the worst leading performances committed to cinema:  Jason Connery shows none of the suave acting ability of his father and is horribly miscast in the lead role; Nicole Eggert proves her BAYWATCH babe status does not an actress make; villain Daniel Goddard overacts horribly; and Lee Majors---well, no one's ever accused him of being a good actor.

This is definitely a loser.",1171843200,4,544,4.869565217391305
2678116,1,B000JMKKJU,If I could give this no Stars I would. It was obviously poorly funded. everything about this movie sucked. I really wish I could have my money back.,1171584000,2,148,4.321428571428571
2678117,1,B000JMKKJU,"First off, Amazon, you need to create the use of negative stars for this DVD here because it deserves a -10!!

This movie is so bad, I would rather take a vacation in Iraq in the middle of the fighting than view this travesty again!!!

This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made in the history of this planet earth! It's a God-awful Flash wanna-be that should have been put out of its misery at conception!

To tarnish Stan Lee's name like that is unforgivable. I truly doubt that Stan ""The Man"" Lee had anything to do with this laughable oddity! The fact that there are no extras at all let alone with him somewhere in them is proof enough for me to see he had nothing to do with it. He always usually appears in some kind of featurette, especially if it's from a comic book superhero!

If you see this movie in any kind of store run as fast as you can to get away from this garbage and maybe you can attain LIGHTSPEED!!!",1169424000,5,932,4.161111111111111
2678118,1,B000JMKKJU,"Poor Stan Lee. His name is attached to another Sci-Fi stinker. The Sci-fi Channel is making itself infamous by producing the worst films in the history of the industry, and Lightspeed is right up there.

Do not see this film. It is horrendous in every way.

It opens with 15 minutes of mindless and pointless gunfire, and then the ""story"" kicks in.",1169424000,6,348,4.596774193548387
2678119,2,B000JMKKJU,"This was an absolutley awful knockoff of The Flash from DC Comics.

Stan Lee should be ashamed that his name is plastered across the DVD box cover.

The acting is poor, the villain is just annoying (not scary).

This is a very bloody and brutal movie that should NOT be shown to children.

How on earth could they have gotten it so wrong?  Well they did.

The costume even sucked.  I could have found a better costume on eBay!
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  Buy The Flash TV series instead!",1168905600,16,484,4.359550561797753

8152386,5,B000JMKKJU,"From Stan Lee the genius creator of spider-man, x-men, the hulk, fantastic four and other great marvel superheros comes lightspeed a straight to dvd movie. This movie is awesome. i love stan lee's superheros. this is a great movie. If you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do",1301961600,,287,4.647058823529412
8152387,1,B000JMKKJU,"Just, awful. The only thing about the movie that is slightly entertaining is the ""running really fast"" special effect, since the actor is so out of shape he can only jog. It's entertaining for about 10 seconds to watch sped up jogging with a blue streak behind him until you realize you paid money for this crap.

And, no, this is not a ""so bad it's good movie"", it's just bad.",1269043200,,377,4.309859154929577
8152388,5,B000JMKKJU,"a good movie simliar to the flash, a must have if you are a superhero fan, marvel version of the dc flash.",1235779200,,106,3.8636363636363638
8152389,1,B000JMKKJU,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I cannot believe that Stan Lee would allow his name to be attached to this waste. Basically special ops team gets wiped out by Psycho snake guy (which they deserve to get for their bad representation of a Spec Ops), sole survivor is healed with a special radiation which gives him super speed. He finds out his boss and snake guy are planning to wipe out the city of DC for revenge... Blah Blah Blah typical storyline. If there was cheese in this movie it would be a step up. the Vulgarity over-dubs are an insult to the watcher and the actors both, and the only funny line in the movie is, ""Blue, its a nice color, I've always wanted to die in blue"".
Just do not get it.",1204416000,5,721,4.1571428571428575
8152390,3,B000JMKKJU,"Stan Lee fans will definitely come away with mixed feelings from this 2006 extremely low budget Superhero B-movie. Believe it or not this is not the worst B-movie I've ever seen, that honor still goes to ""The Warrior of the Lost World"" with Robert Ginty. Make no mistake, this is a low budget made for Television production that suffers from very poor acting by Jason Connery and most of the cast. Jason Connery may share the same last name as his famous father, but great acting ability isn't in his DNA.

Jason Connery stars as Daniel Leight, a government agent and member of the elite ghost squad trying to capture the Python. During a covert mission Daniel is confronted by Python and is almost killed in an explosion. Daniel undergoes experimental treatment and after a radiation overload he discovers he has the ability to move extremely fast and after buying a wind suit from the local sports store he becomes the Superhero Lightspeed.

I think this movie could have worked if someone other than Jason Connery had played Lightspeed and it had more of a story, better special effects and Superhero costume. Jason Connery appears as if he's not very athletic and given the amount of hair loss he just doesn't seem to fit the role at all. The one bright spot and only thing saving this movie from complete disaster is the role of the villain played by Daniel Goddard. In my opinion his acting is really good and he plays the part of the cold brutal killer out for revenge perfectly. The costume and make-up for the Python is really well done, it's too bad the costume for lightspeed didn't receive the same deluxe treatment.

This is the only superhero movie that I've seen the hero buy his costume right off the rack. The acting from Lee Majors is nothing special and he comes off as very stiff and stale in his role as Tanner and he probably did it for a pay cheque. The part of Beth played by Nicole Eggert only confirms she definitely can't act and her role on Baywatch is about as good as she gets.

For a made for Television movie the picture and sound quality are really good while everything else about this movie is average at best. In my opinion this movie is not suitable for young children due to the amount of senseless graphic violence. I would compare this film with ""The Phantom"" with Billy Zane and ""The Shadow"" with Alec Baldwin, just not as good as either of them. Fortunately for me, I didn't pay very much for this movie.",1198886400,13,2446,4.5396825396825395
8152391,1,B000JMKKJU,"I kept watching this just to see if it could get worse - and it did. Right the way through to the miserable end. Every few minutes.

The ""Python"" actor Daniel Goddard was absolutely appalling. If I was in the cast, I'd probably have to commit suicide as the least painful option compared with living with the shame.

What was the director thinking of? Goddard was incomprehensible - is he the producer's son or something? No redeeming features at all - this film must instill horror in everyone unfortunate enough to be connected with it, and dismay in anyone who watches it.",1194307200,,575,4.627450980392157
