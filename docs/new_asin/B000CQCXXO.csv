2469039,5,B000CQCXXO,This is an awesome training DVD for the money.  Clinton Anderson has a straight forward approach to horse training that anyone can understand.  This is the cheapest of Clinton's DVDs that I have found and they have a wealth of information that is worth much more than this DVD costs.,1240704000,2,283,4.64

snow is gone to start this with my colts",1233273600,,112,3.9130434782608696
2469041,5,B000CQCXXO,I really like watching Clinton work.  This DVD is informative and if you pay attention you will be able to use some of the same techniques he uses.  I am happy with the purchase.,1214006400,6,178,4.205882352941177
2469042,5,B000CQCXXO,"My family has been involved in equestrian activities for generations. Running farms in Brazil, horses have always been a very important part of our lives, either for fun or business. In our family history, we carry some of the national's most important victories and awards. At the age of 47 and the same exact number of years involved with horses, I am not exactly a beginner. What Clinton Anderson brings to light along these 5 hours of training is absolutely amazing. He teaches how to educate humans around horses and horses around humans. I watched the DVDs over and over again and every new session there were new little things to pick up. I think he is awesome because he makes clear that a priority must be kept under all circumstances which is, your safety first and then the horse's wellbeing. Anybody who thinks of going nearby a horse, for any reason and at any stage, must buy this album. I had a bunch of older friends over the ranch to watch it, most of them have been involved with horses their entire lives. Guess what - The old guys confessed they all learnt new things. This is it about horses, you always have something to learn! Get this Clinton Anderson collection and you will learn a great deal.",1196208000,24,1219,4.570776255707763
2469043,5,B000CQCXXO,"Definitely a program that is worth it's value- Clinton give you 5.5 hours of step-by-step training with no shortcuts!  He takes you through & talks you through every detail from the very beginning of starting a filly until the end where he is able to stand on the back of that previously untrained filly, shoot a pistol and crack a whip- Talk about a success!
  I think Clinton Anderson is fantastic!  He keeps his horse training simple & down to earth, and he goes through the training process for you using horses that haven't been through it already.  Very impressive and easy to follow.
  Clinton Anderson had his training work filmed independently as he competed in the 'Road to the Horse' colt starting challenge- this is not a program that features all 3 of the trainers- this features Clinton Anderson and the work he did with his filly during the competition.
  'IN A WHISPER' is the first-ever training challenge of this type that features Craig Cameron, Josh Lyons and Pat Parelli working with 3 untrained colts.  That training challenge was a wonderful beginning to the follow-up 'Road to the Horse' challenges of which this program is derived.
  Be sure to check out the IN A WHISPER colt starting challenge DVD using the following Amazon link;

8100333,5,B000CQCXXO,"Loved this video! Very quickly he shows the fundamentals of how he flash trains a young horse. Very useable info right away in my ""new colt"" situation!",1338940800,,151,4.62962962962963
8100334,5,B000CQCXXO,"I really liked this DVD. It IS NOT set up like an infomercial and is real footage in all the stages of the Road to the Horse.  The discs also give you some insight into other trainers who competed in the same competition with less then stellar results.  I definitely gathered a lot of new ideas for my own training techniques and would recommend this set for someone interested in fast-paced colt starting or broke horse ""tune-ups"" w/out the need to spend hundreds on a full length training series.  Overall the dvds give a great overview of Clintons style and abilities to colt starting. I love his work and the outcome of the horse in their respective nature and willingness to please.  Anyone interested in Clinton who are hesitent to buy his full-length series, like myself, and would like to take a look at his methods before such a purchase, should consider this as a good starting point.",1325030400,2,894,4.639240506329114
8100335,5,B000CQCXXO,"We are starting to train a 15 month old Gypsy colt.  This video was very informative on how to make the colt respect it's owner and become ""bomb proof"".  We have watched it twice and will probably watch it several more times as we learn all the basics.",1308009600,,252,4.229166666666667
8100336,1,B000CQCXXO,"This DVD shows the showman/salesman, Clinton Anderson, demonstrating how to win a contest with a horse. This is not a DVD on how to responsibly train your horse or any horse. The whole point of this contest is irrelevant to correct training and misrepresents training as something of a speed event. The goal of the Road to the Horse is to show-off who can conquer a horse as quickly as possible. No responsible horseman is in a hurry to show-off at the expense of properly training the horse. Don't waste your time with Clinton Anderson and his ilk. Find a responsible trainer to teach you and your horse. A responsible trainer will guarantee his/her work and will be more concerned with good horsemanship than showing off or making money marketing stuff. Before you buy any training materials such as DVD's or books check out the disclaimer of responsibility that is included in the fine print. Clinton's books use this disclaimer:

""The authors and publisher have neither liability nor responsibility to any person or entity with respect to any loss or damage caused or alleged to be caused directly or indirectly by the information contained in this book. While the book is as accurate as the authors can make it, there may be errors, omissions, and inaccuracies.""

Don't be a sucker and claim stuff that the author won't claim.

Before you spend a dime on any horse training books, dvds or horse trainers read ""Equitation Science"" by Paul McGreevy. McGreevy's book beats everything that Clinton Anderson, Parelli and all the horsemanship crowd have ever published on horse behavior and horse training. I hope that Clinton Anderson reads McGreevy's book and revises his horse training in light of it. McGreevy's book is the greatest help that anyone has ever done for the welfare and safety of the horse and the humans that handle them.

Another vastly superior book to read about training horses is ""My Horses, My Teachers"" by Alois Podhajsky. Here's a quote from page 105, ""One one side there is the unconditional subjection by force and punishment with which the rider may reach his goal more quickly but only if he has a good-natured creature with no tendency to fight. This kind of education, however, will undermine the individual character of the animal and result in obedience out of fear. The brilliance of such a horse will be lost and he will be indifferent towards man or even hostile. If on the other hand, the training of the horse is based on kindness, calmness, and ample reward as well as understanding for his personality, the result will be happy obedience on the part of the horse and pleasure in his work. It make take a little longer than with the other method but there will never be that ugly fight between man and animal. The charm and brilliance of the horse will be maintained, even enhanced, and preserved until his old age.""

Clinton Anderson's books and dvds are the ""unconditional subjection by force and punishment"" side of training that Podhajsky warns about.",1297382400,4,2995,4.841796875
8100337,5,B000CQCXXO,"excellent, very informative, by view learned a lot and can now imagin in my mind what he says in his books.",1295827200,,107,4.142857142857143
8100338,5,B000CQCXXO,"Loads of good information on colt starting, but quite useful for understanding any horse and much of the training can be used as maintenance.  Loved the voice over explaining what and why Clinton was doing what he was doing (I have not yet seen other years of The Road to the Horse so maybe they are all like this). Wathched in a weekend because I couldn't stop wathing!!",1281139200,,371,4.455882352941177
8100339,5,B000CQCXXO,Lots of great information in a great format.  Love Clinton's narration of the event.,1278201600,,84,5.0
