This is a VERY old film, kind of like the movies we had to watch in assembly at high school in the late 50's.  The color is so blue it made my eyes ache.  The DVD started breaking-up into pixels about 15 minutes in, thank God.  I had been skipping scenes anyway but was finally released from any more torture by getting a bad disc.  Honestly,  the narration is so flat and old school.  It will ruin your idea of any beauty in the Galapagos.  Right now I wouldn't go there if I had a free ticket and all expenses paid after watching only fifteen minutes of this.  Videos that are released in 2010 need to be checked for when the footage was actually shot.  Guarantee, this one was 40 years ago.  Be careful when you order anything form Avian Video Center, where this one was done.  I ordered a Hummingbird video from them last week through Amazon and had it sent to my brother.  Produced at the same studio I am sadly expecting the same results.  If I can find my receipt I'm calling Amazon for a refund.  Not only because you can't play the disc but  because you would not want to watch it.",1303948800,,1237,4.213675213675214
8133071,5,B000GJ26FW,"Whether you're a bird lover, or generally a nature lover and/or about to visit the Galapagos, Hooked on Galapagos Birds by Thomas Kaminski is the movie for you.

The movie begins with a short background, including some cultural information on Quito, Ecuador and the Galapagos and then zooms in on the Galapagos and its birds.

Kaminski's movie exposes us to the endemic species that are special to the islands, yet focuses on the common species that one is likely to see during a visit.  It is divided into chapters, each depicting a different bird species and highlighting various aspects of its ecology.

The spectacular footage is accompanied by beautiful original and classical music and detailed narration.  This narration includes accurate scientific and ecological details, for example, explanation of the molting process and physiology of penguins.  The movie is very didactic and provides a good and detailed preparation for a nature trip through the Galapagos archipelago.

Similar to his previous movies (such as Hooked on Hummingbirds), Tom Kaminski is the producer, cinematographer and narrator of the movie.  He also composed and plays some of the background music.  This is done with a lot of talent and attention to details.

To summarize: footage included in the movie is simply fantastic, with beautiful shots that highlight nature in its glory.  As an ecologist, who studies hummingbirds, I watched the movie while carefully paying attention to the ecological details.  It was apparent that Kaminski spent long hours of patient observations that resulted in exceptional and rare footage of bird behavior combined with detailed scientific information.

Among the beautiful scenes, you will see Boobies dancing to the ""Blue-footed Booby Ballet"" music, written by the producer, Storm Petrels walking on water, and rare shots of Frigatebirds' feisty feeding methods.

Enjoy!",1160352000,9,1889,5.380952380952381
8133072,5,B000GJ26FW,"Wow!  What a beautiful video, and the music fits each scene.  Producer Tom Kaminski combines amazing photography of awesome creatures with excellent writing (and perfect voice), tastefully sprinkled with lots of humor.  I loved it all. It was fun and educational, and my grandchildren enjoyed it also.  His underwater video of the Galapagos Penguins is fabulous.  The slow-motion footage not only is interesting and instructive, but also beautiful in its own right.  The video has more content than some of the other Galapagos videos I've seen.  Now I'm supercharged to visit the Galapagos Islands myself!  Very highly recommended.",1157500800,6,631,5.36734693877551
