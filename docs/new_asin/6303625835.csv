726741,5,6303625835,This was one of our favorite Christmas movie. Can't Believe this beautiful story is no more and no DVD. No Christmas collection is complete without it.,1393804800,,151,4.846153846153846
726742,5,6303625835,"I am hoping this comes out on DVD soon. I check every Christmas to see if there is a release...but none yet.

Fantastic, classic story with an all-star cast. Timeless and memorable.  It is a childhood favorite and I watched the VHS version not long ago and it hasn't lost its charm.  It is one of those stories that every age group takes away something meaningful.

Please release DVD!",1391385600,6,385,4.536231884057971
726743,5,6303625835,This is one movie they should play on the TV instead of some shows they play over & over again during the Holiday. Hope they make this into a DVD soon since my VHS player is about wore out.,1390608000,,189,3.871794871794872
726744,5,6303625835,"This is a Family Movie portraying both ends of the spectrum.
A high society family finds the true meaning of Christmas  the hard way.
After their family starting to fall apart Keshia sets about to bring them back together.
Showing the true meaning of Christmas  love & sharing with others who may not be as fortunate as they are.
After she has reunited the family  & what Christmas is about she goes off into the stars.
For her young age (back then ) she does a remarkable job along with Rue McClanahan.",1387584000,,503,4.445652173913044

726746,5,6303625835,"I wish this were on DVD.  I don't understand why its not?  This was one of mine and my mom's favorites.  We recorded it on a VHS and watched it over and over again...loved this movie.  For years I've been checking regularly to see if its available on DVD and hoping it soon will be, so I can share with my daughters.",1357171200,,316,4.048387096774194
726747,5,6303625835,My parents taped this off TV when I was a kid.  I remember it was one of the few we sat up to watch so we could pause the commercials out (oh the 80's).  For years afterward it was a favorite come cookie baking time.  I'd love to share this memory with my daughter.  Are there plans to release this on DVD?,1355788800,5,306,3.8870967741935485
726748,5,6303625835,"We taped this off tv years ago.  Our copy finally bit the dust.  Trying to fiind this tv movie was difficult.  So happy to find it on Amazon, now we can see Niegel when ever we want.",1354320000,,182,3.864864864864865
726749,4,6303625835,"Keshia-Knight Pulliam plays Molly, an angel sent to earth as a little match girl: her mission, to save the fragmented Dutton family. The father and his oldest son haven't spoken since the son didn't join dad's business and then married ""beneath him"" in the person of a loving Irish servant girl. The second son is a hard-drinking wastrel and the girl in the family cares only for her social position. You have to take a big leap of disbelief, knowing history, to think a rich 1920s white family would take in a scruffy black orphan, but after that the story isn't bad. The 1920s ""look"" is perfect, the story features Irish servants who aren't your typical ""sure and begorrah"" stereotypes, William Daniels' portrayal of family patriarch Heywood Dutton is quite good and so is William Youmans as wastrel son Neville, who brings Molly home. Screenplay is by Maryedith Burrell, who plays Rita. Also of note in the cast, John Rhys Davies as the corrupt chief of police, who plays the character with such a melodramatic flair you expect him to twirl his moustache and laugh evilly.

Note to other reviewers of this movie elsewhere: this has NOTHING to do with the Hans Christian Andersen story except that the main character is a little girl who sells matches. Those who say it is ""just like the story"" have not read it!",1110153600,10,1314,4.71304347826087
