8101734,5,B000CSGIEM,"I won't post a spoiler here but let me just say this about Title. Watching this DVD = Mind Blown. I mean WOW. What an experience. There's a certain scene, you'll know what I'm talking about it you watch the film, where, though I didn't allow myself to break down and cry, I won't lie, my eyes did get a little watery. And near the end, what a shocking twist. Did not see that one coming. I'm still not sure how I feel about the ending. This is one of those movies you can't UN-WATCH, if you know what I mean.",1349740800,2,508,4.03960396039604
