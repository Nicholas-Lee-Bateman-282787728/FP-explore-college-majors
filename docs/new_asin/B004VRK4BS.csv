If you want good animation, voice acting, plot, character development, with action, adventure, and comedy mixed in, in just the right proportions, this is the one.",1313625600,8,390,4.835820895522388
8443909,5,B004VRK4BS,"I bought this for a friend in exchange for something or other, and thought it was just a typical Slice of Life anime set in the Military.  However when my friend let me borrow it, It completely destroyed what I thought it was going to be out of the water, The characters are all extremely likable and have great development throughout the series and the story keeps getting better and better with each episode, the parts that really won me over were the Soundtrack, and the Animation.  Both were by far some of the best I've ever Heard or Seen in an anime.
And the Box it comes in, I love it.  It's nice and sturdy, has a nice cover to hold the 4 DVD sleeves and the little post cards that it comes with is also a really nice touch.
9/10 would recommend Highly",1397088000,2,760,4.227586206896552
8443910,5,B004VRK4BS,"It's so interesting even if it is slow paced! I love it! It has a bunch of speculations and facts that are really interesting.
The art is lovely. The city of Seize is super homely and the character are totally unique!

A Must watch for anyone that likes: Aria the Animation, Kaleido Star, Haibane Renmei and last but not least! Croise in a Foreign Labyrinth.",1394841600,2,358,4.507692307692308
8443911,4,B004VRK4BS,"A review of Sora no Woto in haiku meant to capture the essence of the story (blah twenty word minimum blah):

Five maidens stand watch
Tilling loss and twilight in
A cracked, riven world",1376265600,4,186,4.470588235294118
8443912,4,B004VRK4BS,"It's rare that great animation, music and a fascinating world come together to create such a memorable experience. Sound of the Sky is a definitely one of my favorite slice of life anime, so much so that I wish there were more episodes to explore the world and the characters in greater detail, but sadly that isn't very likely to happen. The actual set comes with a nice art book and the few extras included are better than most releases. I highly recommend it to any one interested in the genre or just looking for a great feel good show.

Item arrived fast and in great condition. Would buy from seller again.",1375228800,,612,4.464285714285714
8443913,4,B004VRK4BS,"A dramatic anime. Great characters, story line and action. Must have for any collection.  English subtitles only, but worth the buy.",1366848000,,132,5.285714285714286
8443914,5,B004VRK4BS,"It bothers me how most DVD reviews on Amazon focus on reviewing the show / movie and never really on the actual product. If I didn't know anything about the show, why would I even be searching for it to buy online? Aspects of the product like overall quality and value for the money strike me as more important. And yes, Sora no Woto is a high quality series.

Now, this DVD set really surprised me. I'd never heard of this publisher before, but I'm very impressed with their work on Sora no Woto. The case is beautiful, covered in official artwork, and really durable. It appears they've glued their own label on the back, but it doesn't take away much from the overall appearance.

The DVDs are safely in separate plastic cases, all of which are nicely decorated. The picture quality is what you'd expect of a DVD nowadays, it's purposely lower quality than a BD in order to increase Blu-Ray sales, but it's not the worst I've seen. There is only original Japanese audio and includes English subtitles that are well written, easy to read, and fully understandable.

What surprised me most about this DVD set, and what makes it a good value in my opinion, was the addition of a 40 page art book that comes in the sleeve. It's filled with key animators' artworks, character sketches, information about the show's production and setting, and commentary from the director and several artists that brought Sora no Woto to life. I had a great time flipping through the little book and it was a nice compliment to the series.

Overall, an excellent quality box set with plenty of content! If you liked Sora no Woto, definitely consider adding this to your collection. It's definitely worth a re-watch.",1362355200,,1696,4.662207357859532
8443915,5,B004VRK4BS,"I bought this initially for the character designs (the artist being the one who also did ""K-On!""), but was almost immediately caught up in the story.
An exceptionally well-crafted tale, set in a possible post-apocolyptic future, where humanity is struggling to rebuild after a series of devistating wars.
""Sound of the Sky"" weaves the background storys of five young women who are bound together, not only by ties of Duty, but also their connection to an enduring legend of an earlier Era. And all THAT is also caught up in a hauntingly familiar song, that transcends the continuing conflict that troubles the world they live in.
Don't let the seeming easy going pace of the show fool you. ""Sound of the Sky"" has considerable depth. The attention to detail in the visuals are also a treat.",1360281600,4,789,4.8088235294117645
8443916,5,B004VRK4BS,"Starts off looking like a Strike Witches clone, but manages to pull it's own weight. The settings and main characters have a lot of similarities and share the idea that one small girl with a positive attitude can effect major change. But from there it diverges considerably, set in a world that the last high-tech war left dying with nations fighting over resources and most tech beyond the ability of the survivors to build. It centers around a unit at a fortress on the border of ""No Man's Land"" where little happens. Somewhat reminiscent of ""F-Troop"" in a way. The series is more character based and less action based until the end and manages to be thought provoking throughout. Characters are easy to relate to. No more spoilers, I think it is worth it. BUT, be aware there is no dub, and you have to chose a subtitle option for the honorifics to be shown. Both are a bit annoying to me at the price.",1359072000,,905,4.490909090909091
8443917,5,B004VRK4BS,"There are a few different schools where Sora no Woto is concerned.  Some see the Moe elements and do not really look past it.  After all, it definitely falls into the mold.  Look at the characters, most of them can be directly translated to others - Haibane Renmei, K-On!, and any other number of Moe series.  And in that respect, it is a Moe series. There are even some plots that seem right from any of the other ones I've seen.  If Moe is an immediate turn off, this might not be for you.  But I urge you to give it a chance.  Why?

There is a different layer to the show entirely.  The backstory of the setting.  The world this is set in is highly intriguing, without spoiling anything I will just say for a lot of us watching it as it came out?  The fun of the series was trying to piece together just what was up.  Each episode adds another layer to the enigmatic world.  Yet never truly reveals everything, leaving this something you can ponder and talk over with your friends for a long time.  And this is coupled with some of the lushest animation outside of a Miyazaki movie!

As for a closest feel?  I'd place it on a similar 'feel' to Haibane Renmei.  It's a slice of life with a slight overarching plot, and it is set almost entirely in the environs of a single town.  Even a lot of the characters (Especially the two mains) are easily mapped to some from the show.  to be fair, 3 are easily mapped to K-On! as well...  So if you loved that show, this is a worthy successor, perhaps not as heavy philosophically in its way, but still quite wonderful.  Plus it is absolutely stunning in terms of animation.  I can't repeat that enough.  It is a real shame it hasn't been released on Blu-Ray yet.",1319846400,7,1707,4.265625
8443918,3,B004VRK4BS,I bought this series on impulse and not that I regret buying it I wish I spent more time understanding how the anime was gonna be. If you like the slow pace-friends forever- understanding-peace- and hope. This is your show but if not stay away or watch an episode online. It a sweet anime and I gotta say I love the opening song but there is no Wow Factor.,1314748800,2,356,4.173913043478261
