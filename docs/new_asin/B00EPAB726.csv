5932428,5,B00EPAB726,"I love this legend movie since the 80's! If you love music, rock n roll........etc, you must own this vintage product! It's amazing that the United States Manufacturers DID NOT re-master this great movie. I have owned this LD (Laser Disc), OST CD, DVD, and this Blu-ray disc got the best quality in both visual and audio effect EVER! Nice German Technology made this great movie Reborn!",1424131200,2,386,4.776119402985074
5932429,5,B00EPAB726,"I'd been looking for 'Streets of Fire' on BD for a number of years and pretty much gave up on a US pressing.  So when I found this German all-region pressing, I ordered it.  Overall, I'm pleased with the pressing.  The source (80s film) has some grain, but the transfer is clean and the audio is first rate.  (If you like anthemic rock, you should like the music in this.)

BTW, if you dont' want the German 'Strassen in Flammen' cover, there's a very similar English 'Streets of Fire' cover.  Just Google - ""streets of fire"" ""blu-ray"" cover - and view Images.",1422057600,5,560,4.4411764705882355
5932430,5,B00EPAB726,It's a shame one has to purchase the German Import (Strassen Und Flamen!) to get this great film on Blu-Ray. Well worth every penny.,1415664000,,132,4.541666666666667
5932431,5,B00EPAB726,"This cult classic was released over 30 years ago, but it still doesn't feel dated; perhaps because it's set in a mythical never-never land that blends elements of the 50s and 80s, giving it a timeless feel.

The long-ago DVD release is not very good.  It is not in anamorphic widescreen (if you watch it on an HDTV, you'll see a window with black bars on the left and right) and the soundtrack is mediocre.  There was an HD-DVD release, when that short-lived format was still in existence, but so far no U.S. Blu-Ray release.

This German release fills the gap.  The cover art is in German, and there's a German soundtrack, but all you have to do is choose the English original track and you have the movie in its original form.  The soundtrack is in DTS-HD and the picture quality is as good as it gets for an 80s film.  The German disc is region-free (note that the British version is not, and will not play on U.S. BD players).

If you're a fan of this movie, this edition is the one to get.",1414627200,20,994,4.306451612903226
5932432,5,B00EPAB726,"Stiiiill waiting for a US Blu-ray release so for now this is it. Region free in english 5.1 DTS, just turn off the german subtitles and you're good to go. As another reviewer noted, extra features won't play in my PS3 but do play on my Toshiba BDK33 el cheapo, go figure.",1414022400,,271,4.230769230769231
5932433,4,B00EPAB726,"The U.S. release was only in DVD, so currently this is the only option for Blu-ray. It has English Dolby 5.1ch audio track, as well as English subtitles -- so it's just as great for U.S. audience.

The movie is a bit dated and the picture quality suffers a little bit: it's a little blurry and quite grainy. In dark scenes the colors aren't very deep. I could go on, but well, I guess most of problems may be in the source material. And this Blu-ray easily beats the poor quality of the DVD release. So yeah, like another reviewer said if you're a fan you should get it.

*A word of caution: The main feature will play for everyone as it's in 1080/24P, but the extra material appears to be in standard-def 50FPS and they may not work with your Blu-ray player. I have a Sony BDP-S185 and it won't play the extras.",1411862400,11,812,4.266233766233766

5932436,5,B00EPAB726,"Great upgrade for this underrated, classic movie.  Sound quality is vastly improved, picture quality is appreciably improved (widescreen).  Titles are in German, but the setup allows for 5.1 English.  Great cinematography and music.",1476662400,,232,5.96969696969697

5932446,4,B00EPAB726,"Best film of the 80s
The film is five stars, but it isn't a great transfer. It's all we have, so I'll take it",1446768000,,109,3.5833333333333335
5932447,4,B00EPAB726,"It was everything all other posters who've bought this have said. Great package, English 5.1 is beautiful, video quality is better than any previous incarnation.",1445212800,,161,5.48

5932449,4,B00EPAB726,"Always enjoyed this film. I was concerned buying the German blu-ray, but it played fine on my blu-ray player. The sound on the musical
sequences is especially fine. As a bonus, videos of the 3 main music sequences are included, though the sound on these is not quite
as good as in the body of the film. Diane Lane is gorgeous and lip-synchs the songs beautifully.",1441238400,,363,4.515151515151516
5932450,5,B00EPAB726,"The treatment of this movie is as good as you'll get it. Correct aspect ratio and 5.1 channel sound (the english track is actually better than the german one). What made the BD perfect for me was not the orignial ""Making of"" or the original 3 music videos but the 80 min contemporary documentary on shooting the movie notably with Par and Hill generously talking about their experiences and finally explaining, why Streets of Fire (The german titel ""Strassen in Flammen"" actually translates as ""Streets on Fire"") flopped in the U.S. while being regarded in EU and Asia as one of the top-movies of the 80ies (and rightly so). Nicely done. Get this one.",1438128000,,651,4.719298245614035

5932452,5,B00EPAB726,"I've always loved the visuals and the soundtrack of this ""rock fantasy,"" and this is absolutely the best it's ever looked and sounded.  It is an All-Region Disc and plays on US players.",1434326400,,185,4.606060606060606

5932454,5,B00EPAB726,I am SO happy *someone* pressed S.O.F. on blu ray and ESPECIALLY offering DTS sound. I HIGHLY recommend it!,1432339200,,107,4.684210526315789
8607852,5,B00EPAB726,"I was intiallly reluctant to buy this German blu-ray but my fears were wasted.  This may be the only way to see this movie on blu-ray.  Put the disc in your player and select English 5.1 DTS sound and English sub-titles. The picture is gorgeous and sound (turn up the volume!).  I have owned Streets of Fire on video cassette, laser disc, and DVD.  After the initial theater run, I never saw it displayed correctly at home (sides cut off and picture blurry and stretched which was particularly noticeable with the old cars especially the Bombers souped up Buick Roadmaster).  Well, this German blu-ray displays the video image correctly in 1:85 widescreen.  Michael Pare and Amy Madison - great heroes, Diane Lane - Michael's love interest, Willem Dafoe - the dastardly bad guy, vintage rock and roll sounds, greart cars, very entertaining movie.  I remember reading a review years ago that this movie was supposed to be the first in a trilogy.  It would have been great to see the sequels.",1488931200,,990,4.748538011695906
8607853,5,B00EPAB726,"I'll start with the basic: it's ""A,B,C"" meaning it'll play in all regions. The main menu is in German, but it's not hard to figure out ""play"", ""scenes"", etc. The main audio is in German, AND it does have original English audio with NO subtitles. You'll have to play around with your remote and player to start. Switch the audio to English, and then take off subtitles. So if you don't know how to do that, it's not rocket science, the player comes with a manual and a main menu. I'm playing it on my Xbox One with a 4k Samsung, it does have English subtitles with German audio if you're interested in learning how to swear in German. I noticed some reviews saying it doesn't have the features I listed, but that's incorrect. This film was prepared for an American audience and you can only overdub it with German commentary, you can't change the finished audio. So anything you buy overseas WILL BE IN ENGLISH as per it's original format. Hence why they call it ""original format"", and subtitles are added in by the player, not the studio, unless the original product has subtitles in the film by the studio. So feel at ease to buy this. If you're interested in optimal picture settings, I run my movie setting with LOW sharpness: 30/100. Otherwise these classic films filter will be all fuzzy. Color and brightness is up to you.",1488499200,,1328,4.5375

8607856,5,B00EPAB726,"This review is on the: Streets of Fire [ Blu-Ray, Reg. A/B/C Import - Germany ]
I'm not going to review this fine movie, just to warn buyers about this disk.
I put this disk in and the menu is in German and they're speaking German! Oh man, did I order the wrong disk? Checked the description on Amazon and it says It's also in English 5.1.  Figured out the menu and put it on English 5.1 and hit ""AUS"" to turn off the subtitles.  Cranked up the volume on the sound system and it's great!  I don't think it's really in surround.  Just front 3 speakers and sub are working.  But who cares.  I get to see it anytime I want.  Picture quality looks good for a Blue-ray converted from DVD quality.  It's the type of movie that was probably filmed in soft focus and it looks great even on a 65"" TV.  It's not Transformers in 3D.

Gotta go now.  A good part is coming up.",1482883200,,863,4.0773809523809526
8607857,5,B00EPAB726,"Cheesy as hell.  The dialogue is campy and sometimes forced.  The set designs are over the top, and the soundtrack should have won an oscar.  Incredible fun, and absolutely iconic.  Some truly great actors got early camera time in this one.",1482019200,,240,4.780487804878049

8607860,5,B00EPAB726,"I can't believe that I've finally come across an HD (and upconverted to 4k by my sytem) version of this that can be played in English without subtitles.  I (almost) totally loved this movie especially the soundtrack and the incredibly gorgeous Diane Lane.

This movie got horrible reviews when it first came out and despite giving it 5 stars I can grudgingly agree with some of the criticism.  The let down for me was almost solely with the climatic and unoriginal battle scene between the hero and the nemesis.  If the writers could have come up with a really original and exciting resolution of the conflict I think the movie would have been a huge success.  For me, I can overlook this (admittedly large) flaw and totally enjoy the rest of the movie and characters because the rest of it was so much fun.",1479254400,,807,4.576388888888889
8607861,2,B00EPAB726,LOVE the movie not happy the darn thing is in german.  There is an english version but the words aren't so that took some figuring out.,1477612800,,135,4.1923076923076925
