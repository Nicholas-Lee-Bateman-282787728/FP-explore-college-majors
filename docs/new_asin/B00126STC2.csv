3077932,5,B00126STC2,"This is without doubt the best miniseries I've ever seen and I would daresay the best ever made. Concha Velasco brilliantly portrays the great 16th century Carmelite mystic and saint. Her portrayal brings out the warmth, humor, humility, hard-headed common sense and incredible spiritual depth of this amazing woman who is also one of my favorite saints. All the actors are superb, as is the writing, the production values, sets, costumes, direction - everything. For those who think a story about a nun several hundred years ago would be boring, think again. This story has passion, intrigue, suspense - even an evil queen - the Princess of Eboli. But above all it is an amazing story of what God can do with someone who gives herself completely over to His guiding hand. I cannot recommend this film highly enough!",1202083200,76,816,4.877697841726619
3077933,5,B00126STC2,"Finally this great mini series is coming out on DVD. I first saw it on EWTN and then found a copy on VHS and watch it all the time. Even though this series came out in 1983, it is timeless in its telling of the incrediable life of this great saint. It is vivid in the portrayal of Teresa and the world she lived in. Concha Velasco is brilliant as Teresa, revealing to us a saint that was both very human and at the same time a great mystic. She shows us a woman who was struggling with inner demons as her spiritual vocation was evolving towards the union she shared with her God as well as the difficulties of the era she lived in and the re-organization of the Carmelite order she was a part of and that had turned away from its original austere charisma. She found herself with enemies on both sides of the spectrum, from the laity as well as her own religious communities. Only a few churchmen and nuns along with St. John of the Cross understood her mission. Another enemy fighting against her was her own body as she was always sickly throughout her life, getting worse as she grew older. For anyone interested in the life and spirituality of Teresa of Avila, this series is for you.",1201824000,121,1189,4.3125

3077970,4,B00126STC2,I have read much of the works of Teresa and many of the commentaries.  The Spanish language was difficult and limiting. The photography was stunning as a means to portray what the world in general; and Spain in particular may have been like.around the year 1500.  This glimpse of life in that century has strongly affected my understanding of how Teresa made sense of her religious experiences.  This movie is in a class of its own as religious drama.,1370563200,,451,4.6835443037974684

3077972,4,B00126STC2,"I enjoyed most of this Spanish television mini-series because there is depth in regards to St. Theresa's philosophy, accomplishments and contributions to the faith and the Church.  It is beautifully filmed and acted. There are many sets and locations for this film and that adds to its authenticity.  The mini-series spends a great amount of time into her personal struggles - both physical and spiritual.  One can see what she accomplished but there was a lack of in-depth spiritual examination and very little about the causes of her physical maladies.  one can guess that they were attacks from demonic forces but it would have been nice to get some clarification.  The other small issue I had was with the many nuns portrayed in the film.  There were so many who come in and out for brief moments that I sometimes lost track of who was who.  I know that may people interacted with her but it was at times overwhelming.  Overall, this is a very good film about a vital saint and teacher of the Catholic faith and devotion to Christ.",1363737600,6,1035,4.679558011049724

3077983,4,B00126STC2,"In making a movie about a saint, a mystic, a superior being, it is important of course to have ""some"" feeling for what was actually going on inside the mind of this being, Teresa of Avila. The most a film maker can do is to intimate, indicate, imply and intuit the immense mental and spiritual journey that she traveled throughout her extraordinary life.

It is obvious that this woman had already been traveling a spiritual path in many previous lifetimes. Teresa was already born with the instincts to follow the path that she struck. So, how can any movie catch all the many threads and impulses that led to Teresa's amazing achievement, both outward and inward? By telling the simple, yet complex story, using just the right dialogue, the right action and scenery, but above all, by choosing an actress whose eyes so eloquently radiate the message that cannot be put into words.

Teresa often struggled to put her experiences into words, but the actress who portrays her uses her very mobile demeanor, especially those wise and compassionate eyes to say the ineffable. Words are finally always inaccurate. So Teresa in the movie cannot give us the moon, but she can point her finger at it for us.",1318636800,5,1200,4.764423076923077
3077984,4,B00126STC2,"I found this dvd/movie interesting, although the life of St. Teresa revolved so closely around prayer and visions that it's almost a given that whoever approaches a filming of her life will have to or want to focus on the human side of her rather than on her soul.  I would recommend it to those persons who want to know what her life was like in terms of relationships here on earth, as she certainly had her detractors as well as her proponents.  I like Concha Velasco's ability to balance the two relatively well.  After all, she is not Santa Teresa.",1302739200,2,553,4.455445544554456
3077985,3,B00126STC2,"The movie is well made, and there are many redeeming aspects to it. It was undoubtedly a very good effort, and you can tell that the director was familiar with her autobiography and book of her Foundations. However, as with many movies on saints, it seems there is still much lacking, especially in subtleties. Evidently this happens in many saints movies. The directors try too much to make them seem human, portraying them as just very good people, but fail to show the life of heroic virtue, prayer, and profound interior life.

For example, Saint Theresa stated in the book of her Foundations that she purposely restrained herself, especially in her love for her nuns, so that they would not develop an attachment to her, nor she to them. Yet the movie showed the opposite of this. Also, the movie portrays her as yearning to travel once she founded the first foundation, but in the book of her Foundations, she says explicitly that she would rather spend her life in solitude within the enclosure than traveling---she only did so out of obedience, not out of her own will.

Furthermore, when she was confined to the convent and barred from founding further convents, the movie portrays her as afflicted and regretful. Yet she wrote in her Foundation that she was actually relieved to have been given the opportunity to live in peace for a while and not have to worry about the trials involved with founding new convents.

It also seems to me that the real Saint Teresa would have been more discrete than the one portrayed here. For example, would she have been drawn into bickering about a broken wagon wheel as the movie portrayed? Would she or Fr. Gracian have expressed such outward anxiety over petty threats from others as the movie portrayed? I know the saints were still human, but a fundamental requirement of a saint is a basic trust in God. From everything I have read, I would even say that her trust in God would have been of such great account, that she would always be at peace through even the most trying external affairs (only openly expressing her struggles with her spiritual fathers).

Again, these liberties that were taken, seem to bring the saint down to more of a human level.

Also, the film portrays her as asserting her will very forcefully with others, in order to get her way. I wonder if this was true. If you have seen the documentary about Mother Teresa by the Petrie's, the way Mother Teresa handles conflicts in that documentary might be a more accurate picture of how Saint Teresa would handle tough situations; persistent, yes, but also very gentle and trusting. Also, she would have been more critical of herself, and her self-will, and perhaps a bit less....dramatic. Saint Teresa would also have been more calculating and deliberate in her every action, but equally docile as a dove; always seeking the counsel of wise priests (especially from the Jesuits, whom she esteemed greatly).

I hope I do not sound too picky, but there is so much that Saint Theresa did and wrote that this movie did not show, that it left me feeling a little wanting. It would have been nice if they could have used more than two paragraphs of the saint's writings in the movie, rather than scripting a dialog from scratch.

But again, these are all minor points, considering this is a genre of movies that is difficult to produce, because it means getting inside the head of a saint. This is where they fall short, and so they settle on focusing on externals, like a string of biographical sound-bytes, rather than the internal movements of their hearts. Watching them is like reading a time line from a history textbook, rather than a work of poetry or painting. But despite difficulties, the movie does better than average.",1286150400,35,3747,4.728943338437978
3077986,5,B00126STC2,"The vast spiritual legacy of the gifted Teresa of Jesus is given brilliant telling in this near perfect Spanish film. I've watched the series several times and can find nary a false note. The choice aspect of this universally praised piece is the pride of place it affords S. Teresa's radiant spiritual doctrine; whole scenes admit an exposition of her teaching, with a beguiling screenplay, quietly artful filming, and a filmmaker's heroic patience, patience, patience. Nothing is hurried.  Concha Velasco succeeds in a diamond-like portrayal of the saint; absolutely nothing stops an intense interior concentration on the screen every minute, every frame. A thoroughly remarkable performance to be treasured. Recommended especially for students of the Carmelite saint's teaching, and, happily enough, for those deeply familiar with Teresa's own writings. In this film, Teresa comes to heart-stopping life. What more can be asked? I'm not generally a fan of the mini-series format, but this pungent film conquers me. A film in such harmony with itself, its subject, its ultimate message, you cannot be disappointed.",1271462400,5,1116,5.4508670520231215
3077987,5,B00126STC2,"Back in '83 I found this series by accident on the primary Mexican channel while living in the San Francisco area. I was absolutely riveted to this portrayal of the saint, even though I could recall only very little of my high school Spanish.

At the time I was out of work, so I was glued to my TV as the series progressed during the week. I had just recently re-read Marcelle Auclair's definitive biography, Saint Teresa of Avila, which the series follows in detail. There was no mistaking major events in Teresa's life in the series, even for a non-Spanish speaking person. There was no mistaking her spirituality, either, which, for me, transcended language. I credit the very fine Spanish actor, Concha Velasco, as well as the other actors & the director, Josefina Molina, ""the first woman to earn a degree in directing from Spain's Official Film School"" for these accomplishments.

Immediately after I viewed the mini-series in '83, I contacted the Mexican TV station to request that they make the mini-series available to the public with English dubbing or subtitles. They referred me to a production group in Spain that I could contact only by telegram. I never got a reply, but imagine my joy a mere 27 years later to discover this gem's availability on Amazon!

With the English subtitles, you don't lose the nuances of Velasco's voice, & the subtitles are large, clear, & offer just a minor distraction to the beautiful filming of the life of this saint for all eras. Now I am going to re-read Auclair's book again, followed by watching the series again. Yes, it's that good!",1268092800,9,1586,4.76

The movie was very well done, and although I would have liked to have seen more attention paid to her mystical experiences and her spiritual trials, there was still plenty in this movie to show what an amazing woman this saint was. I definitely recommend this movie. It has an aura about it that really makes you feel as if you are in the Spain of her time. It takes you into the Carmelite spirit in a way. And, the sets are so well done! In some scenes it looked so much like the real Monastery of the Incarnation in Avila that I had to get out my photos to double check! Great film.",1230595200,6,747,4.158620689655172

The story is not as clear as it might be and could be somewhat confusing to those who have no idea about St Theresa's life. But I have to rate this film of a saint highly. Beautifully filmed and acted by a stellar cast.",1228521600,4,376,3.896103896103896
3077996,5,B00126STC2,"This movie came quickly. It was as seller described.
This movie was wonderful, even with the English sub-titles. I had to pause at times, to take notes of St. Teresa's instructions to her sisters. To see the reality of the opposition of those in the same faith who do not understand deeper devotion to Jesus, was heart breaking. This sad reality is pretty much across the board in all Christ denominations. The wonderful thing to watch is Teresa' resolve to obey the invitation of Jesus to come closer and live simply. She is one of my mentors....in my own journey of spiritual marriage.

If you like Teresa' books and want to see her life on film, then this movie is for you. If you sense a drawing from Holy Spirit to come closer to Jesus' heart....do not fear the opposition...He will be worth it all....LET'S RUN TO HIM TOGETHER...",1227398400,4,835,4.604026845637584

Don't be concerned about the English subtitles; they do not detract at all from the enjoyment of this captivating movie. (I ordered this DVD set from Spain when Region 1 (U.S./Canada) was not available yet, and played it on my computer; so delighted it is finally in a format we can see on our TV's in the U.S.).

Concha Velasco brilliantly portrays the great 16th century Carmelite mystic and saint. Her portrayal brings out the warmth, humor, humility, hard-headed common sense and incredible spiritual depth of this amazing woman who is also one of my favorite saints. All the actors are superb, as is the writing, the production values, sets, costumes, direction - everything. For those who think a story about a nun several hundred years ago would be boring, think again. This story has passion, intrigue, suspense - even an evil queen - the Princess of Eboli. But above all it is an amazing story of what God can do with someone who gives herself completely over to His guiding hand.

Even though this series came out in 1983, it is timeless in its telling of the incrediable life of this great saint. It is vivid in the portrayal of Teresa and the world she lived in. Concha Velasco is brilliant as Teresa, revealing to us a saint that was both very human and at the same time a great mystic. She shows us a woman who was struggling with inner demons as her spiritual vocation was evolving towards the union she shared with her God as well as the difficulties of the era she lived in and the re-organization of the Carmelite order she was a part of and that had turned away from its original austere charisma. She found herself with enemies on both sides of the spectrum, from the laity as well as her own religious communities. Only a few churchmen and nuns along with St. John of the Cross understood her mission. Another enemy fighting against her was her own body as she was always sickly throughout her life, getting worse as she grew older.

It is beautifully filmed and acted. There are many sets and locations for this film and that adds to its authenticity.  The mini-series spends a great amount of time into her personal struggles - both physical and spiritual.  One can see what she accomplished but there was a lack of in-depth spiritual examination and very little about the causes of her physical maladies.  one can guess that they were attacks from demonic forces but it would have been nice to get some clarification.  The other small issue I had was with the many nuns portrayed in the film.  There were so many who come in and out for brief moments that I sometimes lost track of who was who.  I know that may people interacted with her but it was at times overwhelming.

3312480,4,B00126STC2,"In making a movie about a saint, a mystic, a superior being, it is important of course to have ""some"" feeling for what was actually going on inside the mind of this being, Teresa of Avila. The most a film maker can do is to intimate, indicate, imply and intuit the immense mental and spiritual journey that she traveled throughout her extraordinary life.

It is obvious that this woman had already been traveling a spiritual path in many previous lifetimes. Teresa was already born with the instincts to follow the path that she struck. So, how can any movie catch all the many threads and impulses that led to Teresa's amazing achievement, both outward and inward? By telling the simple, yet complex story, using just the right dialogue, the right action and scenery, but above all, by choosing an actress whose eyes so eloquently radiate the message that cannot be put into words.

Teresa often struggled to put her experiences into words, but the actress who portrays her uses her very mobile demeanor, especially those wise and compassionate eyes to say the ineffable. Words are finally always inaccurate. So Teresa in the movie cannot give us the moon, but she can point her finger at it for us.",1318636800,5,1200,4.764423076923077
3312481,4,B00126STC2,"I found this dvd/movie interesting, although the life of St. Teresa revolved so closely around prayer and visions that it's almost a given that whoever approaches a filming of her life will have to or want to focus on the human side of her rather than on her soul.  I would recommend it to those persons who want to know what her life was like in terms of relationships here on earth, as she certainly had her detractors as well as her proponents.  I like Concha Velasco's ability to balance the two relatively well.  After all, she is not Santa Teresa.",1302739200,2,553,4.455445544554456
3312482,3,B00126STC2,"The movie is well made, and there are many redeeming aspects to it. It was undoubtedly a very good effort, and you can tell that the director was familiar with her autobiography and book of her Foundations. However, as with many movies on saints, it seems there is still much lacking, especially in subtleties. Evidently this happens in many saints movies. The directors try too much to make them seem human, portraying them as just very good people, but fail to show the life of heroic virtue, prayer, and profound interior life.

For example, Saint Theresa stated in the book of her Foundations that she purposely restrained herself, especially in her love for her nuns, so that they would not develop an attachment to her, nor she to them. Yet the movie showed the opposite of this. Also, the movie portrays her as yearning to travel once she founded the first foundation, but in the book of her Foundations, she says explicitly that she would rather spend her life in solitude within the enclosure than traveling---she only did so out of obedience, not out of her own will.

Furthermore, when she was confined to the convent and barred from founding further convents, the movie portrays her as afflicted and regretful. Yet she wrote in her Foundation that she was actually relieved to have been given the opportunity to live in peace for a while and not have to worry about the trials involved with founding new convents.

It also seems to me that the real Saint Teresa would have been more discrete than the one portrayed here. For example, would she have been drawn into bickering about a broken wagon wheel as the movie portrayed? Would she or Fr. Gracian have expressed such outward anxiety over petty threats from others as the movie portrayed? I know the saints were still human, but a fundamental requirement of a saint is a basic trust in God. From everything I have read, I would even say that her trust in God would have been of such great account, that she would always be at peace through even the most trying external affairs (only openly expressing her struggles with her spiritual fathers).

Again, these liberties that were taken, seem to bring the saint down to more of a human level.

Also, the film portrays her as asserting her will very forcefully with others, in order to get her way. I wonder if this was true. If you have seen the documentary about Mother Teresa by the Petrie's, the way Mother Teresa handles conflicts in that documentary might be a more accurate picture of how Saint Teresa would handle tough situations; persistent, yes, but also very gentle and trusting. Also, she would have been more critical of herself, and her self-will, and perhaps a bit less....dramatic. Saint Teresa would also have been more calculating and deliberate in her every action, but equally docile as a dove; always seeking the counsel of wise priests (especially from the Jesuits, whom she esteemed greatly).

I hope I do not sound too picky, but there is so much that Saint Theresa did and wrote that this movie did not show, that it left me feeling a little wanting. It would have been nice if they could have used more than two paragraphs of the saint's writings in the movie, rather than scripting a dialog from scratch.

But again, these are all minor points, considering this is a genre of movies that is difficult to produce, because it means getting inside the head of a saint. This is where they fall short, and so they settle on focusing on externals, like a string of biographical sound-bytes, rather than the internal movements of their hearts. Watching them is like reading a time line from a history textbook, rather than a work of poetry or painting. But despite difficulties, the movie does better than average.",1286150400,35,3747,4.728943338437978
3312483,5,B00126STC2,"The vast spiritual legacy of the gifted Teresa of Jesus is given brilliant telling in this near perfect Spanish film. I've watched the series several times and can find nary a false note. The choice aspect of this universally praised piece is the pride of place it affords S. Teresa's radiant spiritual doctrine; whole scenes admit an exposition of her teaching, with a beguiling screenplay, quietly artful filming, and a filmmaker's heroic patience, patience, patience. Nothing is hurried.  Concha Velasco succeeds in a diamond-like portrayal of the saint; absolutely nothing stops an intense interior concentration on the screen every minute, every frame. A thoroughly remarkable performance to be treasured. Recommended especially for students of the Carmelite saint's teaching, and, happily enough, for those deeply familiar with Teresa's own writings. In this film, Teresa comes to heart-stopping life. What more can be asked? I'm not generally a fan of the mini-series format, but this pungent film conquers me. A film in such harmony with itself, its subject, its ultimate message, you cannot be disappointed.",1271462400,5,1116,5.4508670520231215
3312484,5,B00126STC2,"Back in '83 I found this series by accident on the primary Mexican channel while living in the San Francisco area. I was absolutely riveted to this portrayal of the saint, even though I could recall only very little of my high school Spanish.

At the time I was out of work, so I was glued to my TV as the series progressed during the week. I had just recently re-read Marcelle Auclair's definitive biography, Saint Teresa of Avila, which the series follows in detail. There was no mistaking major events in Teresa's life in the series, even for a non-Spanish speaking person. There was no mistaking her spirituality, either, which, for me, transcended language. I credit the very fine Spanish actor, Concha Velasco, as well as the other actors & the director, Josefina Molina, ""the first woman to earn a degree in directing from Spain's Official Film School"" for these accomplishments.

Immediately after I viewed the mini-series in '83, I contacted the Mexican TV station to request that they make the mini-series available to the public with English dubbing or subtitles. They referred me to a production group in Spain that I could contact only by telegram. I never got a reply, but imagine my joy a mere 27 years later to discover this gem's availability on Amazon!

With the English subtitles, you don't lose the nuances of Velasco's voice, & the subtitles are large, clear, & offer just a minor distraction to the beautiful filming of the life of this saint for all eras. Now I am going to re-read Auclair's book again, followed by watching the series again. Yes, it's that good!",1268092800,9,1586,4.76

It takes you through her life from the moment she realized that changing her order in religious life to better their relationship with Christ to her personal demons concerning her beliefs, her fight against pride and others that were jealous of her in the church.  It's great for anyone interested in the lives of the Saints. Concha Velasco gives an inspiring performance and it's subtitled unless you speak Spanish.",1234828800,6,491,5.125
3312491,5,B00126STC2,"It is amazing, but the lead actress both looked and acted exactly as how I have always thought Saint Teresa would have looked and acted. She did such a great job! The movie was very well done, and although I would have liked to have seen more attention paid to her mystical experiences and her spiritual trials, there was still plenty in this movie to show what an amazing woman this saint was. I definitely recommend this movie. It has an aura about it that really makes you feel as if you are in the Spain of her time. It takes you into the Carmelite spirit in a way. And, the sets are so well done! In some scenes it looked so much like the real Monastery of the Incarnation in Avila that I had to get out my photos to double check! Great film.",1230595200,6,747,4.158620689655172

Beautifully filmed and acted by a stellar cast.",1228521600,4,376,3.896103896103896
3312493,5,B00126STC2,"This movie came quickly. It was as seller described.
This movie was wonderful, even with the English sub-titles. I had to pause at times, to take notes of St. Teresa's instructions to her sisters. To see the reality of the opposition of those in the same faith who do not understand deeper devotion to Jesus, was heart breaking. This sad reality is pretty much across the board in all Christ denominations. The wonderful thing to watch is Teresa' resolve to obey the invitation of Jesus to come closer and live simply. She is one of my mentors....in my own journey of spiritual marriage.

If you like Teresa' books and want to see her life on film, then this movie is for you. If you sense a drawing from Holy Spirit to come closer to Jesus' heart....do not fear the opposition...He will be worth it all....LET'S RUN TO HIM TOGETHER...",1227398400,4,835,4.604026845637584

The production design is flawless - watching it is to go back in time to the 16th century and witness the life of St. Teresa unfold (no Hollywood-like sets here). A mature, thoughtful, well-researched, and respectful treatment of this great saint.
Don't be concerned about the English subtitles; they do not detract at all from the enjoyment of this captivating movie. (I ordered this DVD set from Spain when Region 1 (U.S./Canada) was not available yet, and played it on my computer; so delighted it is finally in a format we can see on our TV's in the U.S.).
