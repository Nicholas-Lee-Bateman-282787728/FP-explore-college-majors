7905298,3,6305075395,Some beautiful nature shots ruined by overuse of time lapse photography. Waterfalls and streams are ruined by speeding them up to frenetic pace. Also the narration and soundtrack is horrible but that is easily fixed by playing your own CD's as a background.,1010707200,9,257,5.0
7905299,4,6305075395,"If you love time-lapse photography, this is a beautiful journey to take. The music is wonderful too!  Very relaxing!  You might also like a more 'natural' experience. Take a 'virtual vacation' with ""Hawaiian Dreams."" Unlike,""The Art of Nature,"" it  captures it with the natural sights and sounds of the sea without music or fast editing.  Whatever your mood, musical or natural, either of these DVDs will soothe you!",1008028800,2,416,5.073529411764706
7905300,4,6305075395,"I have purchased several nature DVDs and this ranks as one of the best in quality of sound and visual production.
If you enjoy time-lapsed photography and its artistic effects on water and sky in particular, you  will enjoy this.
I could have done without the narrative although it was  minimal and only at the beginning of each section. The new-age music was  appropriate and well done.",962323200,5,387,4.746268656716418
7905301,4,6305075395,The Art of Nature is a great DVD and I would definitely recommend buying it. The only not-so-great part is the narration. I think it would be better if it was only music and pictures.,925603200,2,183,4.257142857142857
