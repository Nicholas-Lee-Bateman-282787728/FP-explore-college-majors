5007235,5,B006NBQIKQ,"We bought this DVD for homeschooling science. The best part is that the little ones (preK - 1st Grade) learn and enjoy while watching for fun.  At the same time, the older ones (2nd - 4th) learn so much in depth about the Monarch Life Cycle and Migration. So satisfying for both age groups at the same time.  We can't say enough great things about this video.",1327104000,,359,4.343283582089552
5007236,5,B006NBQIKQ,"This is the kind of film you'll want to watch over and over, and share with your friends.  We certainly have!

This high-quality documentary teaches about the Monarch butterfly in an informative and entertaining (and sometimes humorous!) way, holding the attention of young and old alike, and inspiring awe for Christ the Creator.

Intriguing in itself is the fact that this film was made by a family!  We enjoyed learning more about this in the ""Behind the Scenes"" bonus feature on the DVD.

We definitely recommend this to others!",1326672000,,532,4.932584269662922

8501317,4,B006NBQIKQ,"As someone who has home schooled this family had fun learning and sharing the information. I was looking for a video to go along with a display and this one met most of my criteria. It wasn't too scientific for elementary school-age children and it had kids rather than adults doing the presentation. My only issue was the length (which they needed to get all the information across). We ended up watching it in two parts.

Oh, and depending on your family values or the school you teach in note that this production is very Godly.",1403222400,2,531,4.53125
8501318,5,B006NBQIKQ,"What a beautiful and educational video!  My little ones love it, as do my sister's family for whom I purchased an extra copy.  I love giving my children videos that will delight, entertain and educate them on the wonders of God's creation!",1357084800,2,239,4.666666666666667
8501319,5,B006NBQIKQ,"This is an excellent DVD for both young and old.  The photography is beautiful, the children are delightful and the content is presented in a way that holds the interest of all ages.  Makes me want to run out and buy some milk weed seed today.  I'm anxious to see what their next DVD will be!",1329350400,4,292,4.178571428571429
8501320,5,B006NBQIKQ,"My 5 and 3 year old love both of the Your Backyard movies!  We had the one about Birds first.  My 5 year old now recognizies all eighteen birds (and more from wanting to continue learning about them) and has grown in his love of birds and God's creation.  So of course we ordered the Monarch movie as soon as it was available.  We have not been disappointed at all.  These movies are very well done, humorous and very informative.  We have all learned a lot about butterflies!  We are so glad to have nature vidoes that give God the Glory!",1327449600,4,539,4.2772277227722775
8501321,5,B006NBQIKQ,"Crowe's Nest Media has produced a masterpiece!  This family faithfully gives all glory & praise to the Creator Who made the Monarch & He blessed them with opportunities to capture stunning footage.  The children & I sat mesmerized watching the complete life cycle of the Monarch.  Perfect science!  The inclusion of Mr. Jules Poirier is a treat & a testament to God's faithfulness--we want to read his book about Monica the Monarch.  We were blessed by hearing Kellie tell of the Lord bringing His creation, the Monarch butterfly to them to film when time was of the essence & the field was vast.  Even the bloopers are God-honoring in that you see that this dvd did not come together in one flawless take, rather they each laugh at their mistakes & obviously enjoy their family members & those working with them.  Absolutely delightful!!",1327449600,2,838,4.818181818181818
8501322,5,B006NBQIKQ,"I have seen alot of butterflies in my years of birding but really didn't know to
much about them. This DVD gives a full description of how the eggs are laid to the
time that the butterfly is flying. Know I will be carring a butterfly book when I
go birding. This DVD is very good especially for young people. This is proof that
there is a God.",1327276800,,343,4.0588235294117645
8501323,5,B006NBQIKQ,"This DVD is such a blessing to our family. It has taught us so much about butterflies, but more importantly, it points us to the One who created all things. I love both the humor, and also the honor this DVD gives to an older gentleman who loves the Lord and His creation. My children ages 10, 7, 5, and 2 are all riveted to this DVD!",1327276800,,334,4.0
