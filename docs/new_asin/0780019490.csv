Horst is one of my heros, so it is a great joy to hear his voice telling his story, and to learn how unaffected and practical he was.  What a delight to see photos of his origin,  Paris in the 20's, and a review of his great works.  I wish I could have met him, if only for a moment.  This video gives all of us at least something of who he was, how he was, what he did, and what we have lost with his passing.",1001203200,,523,3.933333333333333
