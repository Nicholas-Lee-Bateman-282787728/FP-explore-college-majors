8178053,4,B00009WHTB,"This film has a misleading title, it is not about Monkey style Kung Fu at all. And that is the good news!!  This is actually a fine martial arts drama that takes place in a small village in beautiful/scenic Indonesia. If there was ever a film that should be remastered and restored it is this one, just for the settings alone.  Unfortunately film degradation, edits, deleted scenes, choppiness, and bad dubbing have skewed this version of the film.

The story involves Shaw Veteran Chen Kuan-Tai and a young Billy Chong stepping up to bat for an oppressed village.  The main villian, who wears a fierce fro is really fleshed out and memorable.  In a way, he is the film's real star rather than the heroes. Overall the story is typically about revenge but the locales, costumes, and realistic fighting action sets it apart from many Hong Kong and mainland films from this period.",1173916800,,878,4.712418300653595
8178054,1,B00009WHTB,"I thought this movie was going to feature top quality monkey kung fu fight scenes, however that was not the case. In this movie Chen Kuan Tai fights using a style which looks very vaguely like Tai Shing Pek Kwar, however his movie Iron Monkey (1977) is much better if you are looking for genuine Tai Shing Pek Kwar. If you are looking for Monkey Kung Fu don't waste your time with this movie, instead check out Monkey Fist Floating Snake and Iron Monkey (Chen Kuan Tai 1977)",1090195200,,474,4.3977272727272725
8178055,5,B00009WHTB,"This rare gem is a lost classic in the martial arts genre.
Superstar Chen Kuan Tai veered from his Shaw Bros. studio work for this independent film shot in Indonesia.
It also features a young Billy Chong.
The film is hosted by Shaws actor Philip Ko Fei,who also demonstrates his martial arts and talks about the film industry. Quite interesting.
The real highlight is a great documentary on the Shaw Bros. studio,hosted by David Chiang. This alone is worth the DVD purchase!
This film is presented in widescreen,with sound in mono.
A great addition to the collection!
