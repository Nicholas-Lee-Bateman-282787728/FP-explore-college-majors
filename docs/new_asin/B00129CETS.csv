8287066,5,B00129CETS,"I first watched it cuz the name made me laugh, but then I was BLOWN AWAY at what a good show it was! My grandfather's generation was the type that hung downtown in the Night Owl coffee shops, and Assy just nails this culture spot on. The absurdity of Assy himself overwhelms me and I start cracking up (love the way Assy's gun & accessories are held up invisibly somehow - that rocks!), but most of the time I'm just amazed that someone remembers this lifestyle that was lost long ago! Los Angeles, San Antonio, Chicago, if you have a connection with downtowns like these, you'll connect with Assy BIG TIME! Bravo to the creator(s)!",1232668800,20,632,4.504347826086956

>>For those that enjoy the renegade-cop genre, and have both a sense of humor and twelve minutes to whittle, watching Assy McGee is a great idea. All the ususal suspects are present: hard-driving chief, over-politicized mayor, ethnic partner(s), beloved bartender, disposable floozies. The writing is just spot-on; the animation is also at a top-level. This is funny, creative stuff.<<

Can't add a thing to this fine review except that they forgot just one thing: a cop that puts it all on the line everyday on the mean streets of his town named Assy McGee. A real badd a-- fighter for justice. Literally.",1230854400,11,638,4.844036697247707
