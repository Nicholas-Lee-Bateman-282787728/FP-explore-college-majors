1969086,3,B00013RC1Q,"Don't get me wrong here, this isn't a bad collection. However, neither was it a great one.

What we have is a 3-disc set of stock COPS footage from the early to mid 1990's loosely centred on 3 basic themes: women being bad, men being caught being bad and men shooting guns. Each DVD has some extras which equate to some of the same scenes you've already watched but now they're unpixilated.

If you want to see the inner workings of the Manhattan subway police were like or what a popular hairstyle for police women in 1995 Kansas City was then buy this. Otherwise watch it on TV. One for the purists and collectors.",1120521600,15,616,4.394736842105263

1969094,5,B00013RC1Q,"Within this riveting, 2-disc, DVD depiction of the first LIVE, ""reality"", TV Show: COPS/20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION, packs a powerful punch. The ""best-of-the-best"" - COPS, depicts what the average workman does not see or can possibly imagine, regarding Police Work. It's a very tough job which is why Police Officer's, are so special and should be treated, as such. These 2 mesmerizing DVD disc's depict actual blow-by-blow, chase, bust and arrest of a perpetrator, so that the general public can sleep peacefully at night. Like angels, COPS work on our behalf even when, we don't realize it. This ""...Officer in pursuit and bag'em"" thrilling, adrenaline-rushing, reality, TV Series- COPS, paved the way and laid the foundation for... other LIVE Reality/TV programs. Especially, the ones that deal with missing children, LIVE on the scene chases and hostage scenes in progress. And, those are just the tip of the iceberg of what my boyfriends and girlfriends in blue (Public Safety Officers) have to go through, within their ""routine"" line of duty. To ensure fairness and safety for all parties, concerned. They protect us all and if need be, take a bullet for us. And, obnoxious criminal offenders and the ungrateful and disrespectful public, have the nerve to call them ""pigs!"" My answer to them, is this: ""Go #!!*#?! yourselves!"" And yet, those very same people call upon those very same - COPS, when they themselves, are in need. Then somehow, the so-called ""pig's"" suddenly..., make the successful transition to being: Officers of the Law. Hence, COPS! I guess, that's what you'd call: ""Hypocrisy at it's best"", eh!? But, criminal minds with a seared conscience being what they are, are not exactly noted for their... shall we say, mental agility and emotional stability. Their overall comprehension is narrow and limited. They and their like-minded wanna be's, definitely follow the piped-piper of their own rhyme and reason. Which is why they are sitting in jail cells and penitentiaries. Because courageous COPS were brave and smart enough, to enforce the Law and put them there. And, this crap about Police Officer's using ""excessive force?"" Well, according to the Law, it must be remembered that even for Police Officers, ""...they are innocent until proven guilty!"" COPS - these precious, brave, men and women that confront offenders and their various crimes and further place themselves in harms' way or into life-threatening situations - if need be, and give chase to the perpetrators while surrounded by hostility and an unsafe environment, are also daily heroes. For, which we should be, truly very thankful. Never forget, that just because someone is a Police Officer, does not mean that they have surrendered their individual rights as a citizen or more importantly, as a human being. Where by, they have completely forfeited ""...any and all rights to defend themselves and their own lives!"" Because after having used reasonable restraint a Law Enforcement Officer regardless of their rank or position, has just as must right to defend him or herself, as anyone else, does. Meaning: Just because these individuals have courageously chosen to serve the public within a Law Enforcement or a related field capacity, does not negate the fact, that they too... are entitled to their own freedoms and privileges which are afforded to them, under the Laws within this Great Land of America. Yes, like it or not, they too even as COPS, fall into the category of ""...with liberty and justice for all!"" The general public all too often, forgets that poignant and very powerful, little fact. Hello! That may be a revelation for some of you! The common denominator being, they are our fellow man and should be treated, as such. The interpretation: COPS are people, too! And, at every opportunity we should applaud them by expressing our gratitude. How? You can start by saying: ""THANK YOU!"" These 2-DVD discs: COPS/20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION, not only include the very best scenes from the last 20-years but also, include: COPS ON COPS - Lights! Camera! Action! Toughest/Take downs Featurettes; The original Pilot Episode of COPS and the COPS 20th-Season Television Special. This full-frame, 2007, color, 131-minute, eye-opening, educational, entertainer is pure physical, action and adventure from a Police perspective. Parental discretion is strongly advised due to the language, nudity and violence. Because even for adults, this is an intense, dramatic, edge-of-your-seat, pulsating, engaging and adrenaline-rushing - COPS, as you have never seen them, before. In other words: It's as revelatory, as it is, captivating! Have you thanked a Police Officer, today? Nina Kish",1442188800,2,4674,5.216755319148936

1969096,1,B00013RC1Q,"Apparently, since ""Cops"" began airing in 1989, crime rates in the United States had been falling in the 1990's. However, US perceptions that crime was on the rise has been wide-spread with many people buying guns and fearful that a crime would be perpetrated against them. The television show ""Cops"" I believe has been partially responsible for this widespread but erroneous perception. The television medium is an extremely powerful tool which can distort reality to millions of viewers. If one-sided perspectives are thrown at many viewers, people have a tendency to believe them, even if it is a distortion of the truth. There is really no such thing as a ""reality television show"", only shows which are either fiction or nonfiction. ""Cops"" shows one side of some of the more ugly aspects of our society, but it also perpetuates a certain view-point. ""Cops"" is ultimately a kind of on-screen trial in which only the prosecution's side gets to present its case. The accused receives no opportunity to present its side.

In an interview with one of the producer of ""Cops"" in his documentary ""Bowling for Columbine"", Michael Moore asks some pretty interesting questions about the show. The producer states that chases, blood, guts, and handcuffs tend to sell very well. One aspect of the show which has and continues to be an integral part of the episodes is the chasing and arresting of minorities, particularly African-Americans and Latinos. Minorities are portrayed as constantly breaking the law, running from police, subdued by police, fettered by police, usually with handcuffs, and then shoved mercilessly into a police vehicle before being whisked away to jail. The message is clear: jail is where they belong.

Rarely are white offenders ever shown breaking the law. This may be because of lot of white crime is non-violent, such as white collar crime which is really far worse than someone holding up the corner drug store, assuming no one was hurt. And yet, many financial institutions and other corporations have lost people's pension funds and retirement accounts, at the hands of greedy corporate executives who tend to be white, but the producers of ""Cops"" don't believe that kind of show would sell. Michael Moore pitches such a show to the producer, but he doesn't think it would fly because it doesn't have enough ""action"". And of course, the crimes would be perpetuated by more white people. Of course, all the producer's of ""Cops"" are white, so one wonders if their only motivation is in a belief of what would sell.

In this country, part of as a result of this show, most people believe that the vast majority of crimes are committed by minorities, but it's not true. Whites commit more crimes than other minorities, but the message of the show is pretty clear that non-whites commit most crimes, which is why this show is not a reality show at all. The show is essentially the television equivalent of the case for the prosecution where there is no fair hearing for the other side. It is interesting that, in my entire life, I have never experienced controversies that are completely on-sided. Each side has their own story. But ""Cops"" wants to make it very clear who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. And if we live in a world of constant fear, we probably end up doing more damage to each other than good. Unfortunately, some of the most heinous crimes committed against humanity were engaged in out of fear. Is that the world we want to live in?",1435449600,,3481,4.837248322147651

1969136,4,B00013RC1Q,"This show has been on for 20 years but I stumbled on it one day just by channel surfing but is this reality?  The photography is a bit too slick for it's own good and even foot chases are filmed with a cameraman who must have the steadiest hands in history if he is really running behind the cop chasing a suspect. And the cops always get their ""man"" or woman"". And because this is on film they always draw their pistols for dramatic effect but the only thing they do shoot is tasers.  Each show starts with a chat by an officer to the camera, he is always low key and soft-spoken, but when he faces a suspect, the Glock is out and he is screaming commands to the ""suspect"".  After the criminal is captured and handcuffed, the officer then talks to them low-key and soft spoken. Maybe I am just a bit cynical but I highly doubt in the big, bad world out there a policeman would chat with a ""suspect"" like they were old chums. I realize because of time constraints-and fast forward editing, (each of the three segments per 30 minute show run for 6 to seven minutes) which explains what starts out as a one officer pursuit-suddenly there are a platoon of cops on the scene who appear out of nowhere.

I am not slamming the show because it is highly entertaining and highly addictive but it is one of the best photographed ""reality"" shows out there and although I enjoy watching it--I take the ""reality"" boast with a grain of salt. And may ""Cops"" continue for another 20 years chasing after the ""Bad Boys"".

Update on my suspicion that COPS may be somewhat staged, I have recently watched an episode that appeared real but because it was being filmed for television the actions of the cops were somewhat restrained considering the situation.
An officer is about to tackle a child predator but just at the point of contact the predator turns and belts the officer squarely in the nose.  The officer gets him to the ground and the perv begins to chomp down on the forearm of the officer.  There are now 5 or 6 officers trying to help their comrade who now has blood gushing from his nose and teeth locked on his forearm-  Now my thoughts on why this incident looks real--Aside from the graphic view of the nose injury, in the midst of the struggle the predator has defecated and urinated in his own shorts and is hosed down by the officers-but during the struggle with 6 officers trying to help their fellow officer, with the exception of one who tries a few jabs with a baton to the offenders ribs, not one of them thought of using a taser in all the confusion.  I have seen episodes where a taser is used against a suspect who is aggressively rude but hardly dangerous--the episode I am talking about-the taser was not even thought about in the heat of the moment due to the violence against the officer and the struggle to subdue the suspect--this episode was to me-real. (However, if this event was not being filmed for public viewing on television-I am sure the fight to subdue the child predator would not have been so restrained but I can only say-why not? the guy was an animal.)

Another thing that always surpises me is 99% of the suspects do not insist their faces be blurred considering what they are being arrested for would be embarrasing for most but then I guess there is always someone out there who wants his 15 minutes of fame no matter what the circumstance. Now that is REAL.",1261785600,,3391,4.437299035369775
1969137,5,B00013RC1Q,"""COPS"" is fairly raw, so it's not for everyone. When drug addicts fight with the police and are too stoned to feel the blows of the nightstick; when drunks butt their heads against squad-car windows, trying to injure themselves; when feuding couples flail at each other, ignoring police threats of pepper spray or deadly force; I can't help but remember some lines from Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, from the ""Grand Inquisitor"" story. The ascetic, cassock-clad GI looks at the Lord Jesus and laments, ""Thou hast seen these 'free men.' Yes,"" he says, ""We have paid dearly for 'freedom.'""
Cops invites each viewer to ride in the back seat of a squad car. Vehicle pursuits routinely reach 100 mph. The vehicle crashes and the pursuit continues on foot. Inevitably weapons are drawn, with the usual screams, ""Show me your hands!!!"" Expletives optional. It's a unique experience.",1260835200,4,882,5.089655172413793

1969147,4,B00013RC1Q,"I've been a fairly regular viewer of ""Cops"" for some time now, so I was curious to see what they'd do with this 20th anniversary double DVD edition.

It's excellent value. The selection of incidents from the show's seasons is absorbing and informative. The special features, including the pilot show, are very good.

I always marvel at how patient and good-humored the officers shown are. Of course, they might not be when the cameras aren't there...

Thoroughly recommended.",1205971200,5,475,5.064102564102564

I was very disappointed, I was hoping for a collection like Cops too hot for tv that came out a while back.  There is some decent content.

1969152,5,B00013RC1Q,"Can it truly be 20 years since the first episode of COPS ran of the newly found Fox Network? Three years into the network's existence came a reality show unlike any other and it stuck a nerve with the viewing public. So much so that we now celebrate its 20th anniversary with the release of  COPS 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION.

This collection contains several items of interest as well as a 20 year retrospective of the series. One disc contains the original pilot for the series and a special Las Vegas Heat show. A look back at the series by now famous fans including Luke Wilson, director Richard Donner and more as well as a collection of parodies of the show and other shows that have included spots revolving around the series is included as well. Remember the episode of X-FILES that was shot on video and told from the perspective of the COPS filming crew?

But for fans of the series, the highlight will be the look back at highlights from all 20 years. A selection from each on is presented, offering different types of moments seen over all those years. Everything from simple traffic stops to domestic disputes is seen. Perhaps not so amazing is the fact that during a 20 year period, people still commit crime and police are still needed to deal with each and every one of them.

Another section of this two disc collection contains fan favorites from the series. Trust me when I say that there has to be at least one you remember. If not, you've at least heard about them from someone else who watched the show.

I think the longevity of the series stems from several items. One is the glimpse at real life drama as it unfolds. Sure, the pieces are edited together to give us a heightened look behind the scenes. But you're never quite sure what will happen next or who will be involved.

The show also gave us a look at the people behind the badge. For once they are seen as real people as opposed to the radical's views of police as baton bashing, taser shooting cowboys with no concern for the people they have been hired to protect. In a time when police receive a bad name via Hollywood that wants to portray them as almost all corrupt and a media campaign to make them appear to be persecutors rather than protectors, COPS gave us the chance to see what it was they have to deal with daily. We may not understand why they pull us over and treat us as suspects, but with this series, we got the chance to see the weapons, drugs and more that people had on them when stopped for nothing more than a broken tail light.

COPS is a phenomenon that fun TV series have achieved. It has remained on the air for 20 years now and still seems to be going strong. We are all still interested in the real life adventures of police apprehending criminals or dealing with those domestic disturbances. Chances are we will never tire of it. And as long as this series presents it in the honest and understanding way that they have, this series could go on for another 20 years or more.",1203379200,9,2985,4.416363636363636

Pros: This is an outstanding and exemplary collection of movies from many genres presented with unusual clarity of sound and picture. The three individual DVD albums are well and strongly constructed; they may outlast their owner. Navigation and selection in menus are simple. Sound tracks cover a broad range to accommodate  individual volume preferences. With very few exceptions the movies offer good selections of program and subtitle languages. All movies are complete as released; there is no advertising. Cons: The DVD slots in album pages are very tight making insertion and removal of discs tedious. The index sheet covering the spine of the storage box was not well attached and mine required overall regluing, a minor inconvenience. My bottom line: Though some of the movies included in this collection are not among my favorites, I will watch every one. Ill watch many of them more than once.",1514419200,,1154,5.204301075268817
