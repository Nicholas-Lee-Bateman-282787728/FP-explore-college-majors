8251968,3,B0013LSQYC,"I am a west coat trainer, and was hoping for  a lot more out of this dvd. ED needs an editor! The sections are long on talk, short on showing. The muzzle section could be two mins, not ten or more. Ed cannot make up his mind if he  is talking to a pet audience, or a pro audience like me.
We see some fighting clips, but not enough, the puppy clip is too short. so what happens in the clip with the kennel girl? why don't we see what the correct action was for that brat dog?

I was shouting at the tv when the small dog was being crated, ED you dummy, the crate is too small for the dog, it has a valid reason for disliking the crate, it could not put it head up. Most pet folk get a puppy crate and don't up size it, small dogs need large comfortable house crates.

I turned it off shortly after this, felt like I had wasted a lot of my afternoon. I have one section to go, maybe that will redeem this dvd.
For people who think this is harsh, its very watered down advice. I give stronger advice for the bratty dogs I see. if you have never worked dogs this would be an ok addition to your learning curve.",1388188800,5,1107,3.9285714285714284
8251969,5,B0013LSQYC,"This was full of great information and training for my aggressive German Shepherd who is very protective of me (and also my service dog) and if you get near me she goes into her ""Better back off from my mom"" mode.  After a few sessions of using the training on her, she is turning around and doing a whole lot better.  This video is packed full of very important things.  Follow the instructions and keep it up and you will see a difference in your dog(s). Depending on what you want from your dog(s), this DVD will certainly help.  I love Ed Frawley!!!",1379116800,3,553,4.339805825242719
8251970,5,B0013LSQYC,"This is another excellent video by Leerburg. This will help you to understand how a dog thinks, and if you follow the advice you won't have big problems with a dominant or aggressive dog.

FYI - there are MANY dominant and aggressive dogs that are SMALL dogs! I've had to rehabilitate many of these kinds of dogs after rescuing them from the pound; some were on death row for biting. You don't let ""cute"" little dogs bite when they're puppies. They'll wind up biting someone's face as an adult, and that will do some damage. I've used the information in this video in rehabilitating them, and it's sage advice that works beautifully!",1331251200,7,633,4.651785714285714
8251971,4,B0013LSQYC,"Most dog owners don't train their dogs very well, and most of the time they are lucky enough to not have big problems.

Those that do have serious problems commonly drop off the dog at the shelter for death, as they don't want to be bothered with actually training a dog.

This video offers another chance for aggressive dogs and their owners. It provides an understanding of dominant and aggressive dogs, and how to deal with them. For those viewers who think it's inhumane to choke-out a dog, they have never seen dogs regularly murdered in a shelter as I have (which is the commonly used, HIGHLY immoral alternative), nor have they dealt with trying to pry a dominant and aggressive dog off of another dog.

Considering the alternatives, this video is well worth the investment.",1328400000,9,781,4.727941176470588
8251972,5,B0013LSQYC,"By far, this is the most straight forward, no non-sense video about handling an aggressive dog. I have an 18 month old male Doberman that is very dominant and I was about to get rid of him. he was very dog aggressive and pretty much did what he wanted to do, despite the corrections I was giving him. I have been through 2 supposedly good trainers, and he was good when they were around, but until I started applying the techniques taught in this video, I had no luck in curbing his aggression and dominance when we were out of the classroom and their presence. get this DVD and APPLY the principles taught here and you will see a difference immediately!  Especially the lesson on delivering good corrections. This one made all the difference for us. Now I have a happy and obedient dog that I can live with.",1246665600,26,808,4.422818791946309
