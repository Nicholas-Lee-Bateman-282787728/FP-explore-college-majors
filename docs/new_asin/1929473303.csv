We homeschool, and the boys (7&9) are looking to go beyond the successes they've had with Ed Emberley's drawing method (which I highly recommend for young ones).
Before you start, make sure you have the supplies they use in the video - sketch pad, charcoal or drawing pencil, eraser and pastels (they use chalk but we used oil).
The boys were able to watch the video by themselves. They paused it to complete their work and were excited to show me their completed project and the new techniques they had learned - about how to hold a pencil for drawing and a warming up exercise.  They completed 3 out of 4 lessons in one sitting and I think it took them about an hour.",1395273600,7,771,4.317241379310345
