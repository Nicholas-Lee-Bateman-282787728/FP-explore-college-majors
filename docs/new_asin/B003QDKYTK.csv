4168131,5,B003QDKYTK,These DVDs are a must for anybody who is a deer hunter and has a sense of humor. My family and I watch these DVDs together all of the time and the jokes never get old. It is definitely worth the price.,1388102400,2,201,3.8095238095238093
4168132,5,B003QDKYTK,"Hilarious.  I watched these years ago when they were on DVD.  There are a few skits I thot they over-did and were stupid, but the idea of this is they are supposed to be making fun of hunters, each other, and the stupid things we do.  Definitely worth the $23 I paid for 3 DVDs.",1387324800,2,278,4.0181818181818185
4168133,1,B003QDKYTK,This DVD was Terrible!!!  We shut it off very early into it.  Husband and sons couldn't take any more!  So disappointing!  Bought to enjoy on Christmas morning as per tradition....oh my we had to change tradition!!!  What happened Jeff?,1375401600,,236,4.948717948717949
4168134,5,B003QDKYTK,I had purchased Part 1 and 2 some years ago as VHS's.  This was a great purchase and recommend this item to any avid deer hunter.,1349568000,3,129,3.9615384615384617
4168135,4,B003QDKYTK,"If you do, I can assure you that most will shoot out your nose!!!!!!  If you have ever seen Jeff's appearences on the Versus TV show ""Bucks of Tecemonte"" then you may have seen a glimpse.  If you have EVER hunted deer with a relative, this is the show for you!

Only 4 stars due to lack of warning for shooting beer out of your nose!",1333584000,4,333,4.015151515151516
4168136,5,B003QDKYTK,"The Incomplete Deer Hunter was a gift I purchased for my husband and son.  I found myself very early into it, watching with them.  It was so funny, at one point I had tears running down my face. This is a must for all hunters, (and hunter's wives)!  I really loved the part when he's watching tv on the couch and his ""old lady"" is yelling. So funny!",1326240000,4,349,4.102941176470588
