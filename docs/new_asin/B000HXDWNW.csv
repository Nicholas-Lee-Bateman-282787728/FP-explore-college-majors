I think the BEST way to watch it is to sit back with a few friends, have a few beverages, and enjoy the fun. Everyone will have comments and can pan each preview. Overall a good time.",1294876800,4,275,4.111111111111111

8142272,5,B000HXDWNW,"this is quite simply the most awesome collection of trailers you will come across. Every one is a solid piece of entertainment. Man, could they make trailers back in the Deuce days! I was particularly impressed that there are so many obscure movies I never even heard of. The trailers are grouped thematically and the various genres segue from one to another -- its kinda cool. If you're into trailers - get this!",1171584000,14,413,4.671232876712328
