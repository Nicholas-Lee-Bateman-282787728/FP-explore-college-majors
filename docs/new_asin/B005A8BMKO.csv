4640903,5,B005A8BMKO,"This video has no faults whatsoever and has no places that
skip or mess up as so many videos do for no particular reason.
This affords one a less exasperating evening of viewing
enjoyment. The show is pleasant to watch. Because of the
high quality, one can focus more on the movie and not
be distracted by the problems movies can have.",1330300800,3,335,4.419354838709677

8463246,4,B005A8BMKO,Good detective fun. Great interplay between characters. Parodies many different famous shows and characters. Can drag in a few places but picks back up quickly and with a good laugh.,1470614400,,182,5.1
8463247,5,B005A8BMKO,"So grateful to have this series finally.  I watched it on TV and really missed most of the episodes.  I also have the single disc versions, but it wasn't enough.  No special features except the alternate ending, but you can't have everything.",1447459200,,242,4.714285714285714
8463248,5,B005A8BMKO,"I remember this show when it initially aired on CTV in Canada. I took an immediate liking to it and was extremely disappointed that it was cancelled after one season. The episodes were well-written and performed and came off very well despite the low-budget. Even better that it was filmed and set in Vancouver.

John Woo directed the two-hour movie that served as the pilot for the series. I won't rehash the plot too much but the love triangle between the three leads is both amusing and touching. By the last four episodes it becomes clear which man Li Ann Tsei (Sandrine Holt) belongs with, which unfortunately due to the series cancellation was not explored further, but if you watch it from the beginning you'll probably have it figured out. Holt has great chemistry with both her leading men, Ivan Sergei (as Mac Ramsey) and Nicholas Lea (as Victor Mansfield), who of course, also had a prominent recurring role on the hit TV series ""The X-Files"". Rounding out the main cast is Jennifer Dale, who plays ""The Director"" of the agency that the trio works for. In the latter part of the season, Vicky Pratt became a semi-regular as a former mob queen who is eager to be ""reformed"" (cough). Canadian viewers will also get a kick out the guest stars, which include Colin Mochrie, Ron Lea, Pat Mastroianni and Katherine Greenwood, just to name a few. Michael Wong is also a standout in his appearances.

While each disc starts with an advisory about condition of the source material, for the most part the picture is very good, with only minor issues here and there. The show has aged quite well, and the music and wardrobe is just another reason to love it. As another reviewer pointed out, the writers did some clever spoofs of ""The X-Files"", ""The Maltese Falcon"" and the ""James Bond"" series of films. Humor, action, romance and drama abound. The only special feature is an alternate ending, which was evidently used when the show later aired in the US. I wasn't aware that there was an alternate ending until recently, and it's a good option for those who didn't like the way the series ended.

The only thing that is jarring is that the 17th episode, ""Little Sister"" was obviously shot earlier in the season; key factors give this away, and that makes the continuity a bit confusing. Why the episode aired so late is anybody's guess.

On the whole, I was pleased to be able to watch it again, and even catch up on the few episodes that I missed. While ""Once A Thief"" had a brief life on television, the show lives on in the hearts of its fans.",1422576000,2,2547,4.591208791208791
8463249,3,B005A8BMKO,Haven't watched it all yet but the quality seems to be okay. The dvd case was damaged; once of the pieces that holds the flip-book dvd holders in the middle was broken but the discs themselves weren't damaged. They are labeled incorrectly however. There are only 22 episodes but the third disc is mislabeled as having five episodes and it's incorrect from there on out.,1413849600,,369,4.6923076923076925
8463250,5,B005A8BMKO,I loved this series when it aired on television was happy to purchase it on dvd to enjoy it all over again.,1391904000,,107,3.909090909090909
8463251,5,B005A8BMKO,"SO glad it's now out on DVD. Especially love the tracks Woo used on the show. Even better, the songs are credited. On DVD, I freeze-framed and YouTubed all the songs. 'Man If We Could Surf Forever More' is a great track. Of course, the tension between Li-Ann's 2 guys adds to the show. And the casting for the cleaners is wonderful. Was a treat the DVD provided 2 versions of the final ep. Tom Waites' 'Time' - another very appropriate choice by Wu.

If only they could do the same for WKRP, Lou Grant and BJ and The Bear.",1356912000,3,522,4.22
