The attempt to make this about confirming or debunking with science is interesting.  The only issue is that the episodes vary in quality/entertainment.  Some episodes really stretch credibility, but others are definitely thought provoking.

3162079,5,B0016OCTUS,I love the way these guys approach the subject of UFO's. They present both sides and try to do experiments to debunk what they can and leave the rest to our imaginations.,1369440000,,170,4.34375

Not to mention, they have and end segment, a wrap-up, that says ""file XX - CASE CLOSED!"" haha. As if they found real scientific evidence.

If he were no part in the show, My rating WOULD be 5 stars... Far appart from Stating the blatantly obvious, at EVERY Bloody segment he speaks in, He is constantly tripping on himself, verbally, ie, repeating what has already been shown/said/articulated by introduction of the story,and by the narrator... Uggghhhh! FRUSTRATING... He's GOT to realize, that most patrons watching the show, are NOT three years old, Nor do they suffer mind altrecations...

To make matters worse, &  to oil an already slippery floor, I can't STAND the fact that Bill's comments, & Qustions, DIRECTLY Lead people (who've supposedly had encounters,) Into saying what he wants to hear them saying...

Bill sometimes comes across so desperate to believe that if a dust particle lands on a telescope he goes ballistic in awe and thats kind of annoying, however the other cast is more skeptical in degree and balances the show out and keep Bill in check, as he advertises his magazine on his hat...whats his real motis operandi?  What I love about this who is how they debunk things and put a science edge on everything.

Its a shame this show got axed it's one of the best shows on the subject to ever come out...oddly the UFO/Space subject matter is all over the place lately so its even more strange they canceled this show.  You will be glad you bought this set, like season two they come in good packaging and season one is in a metal tin.  Not like anyone would display this but someone just might.

Excellent!",1273363200,,247,4.511111111111111
3162123,1,B0016OCTUS,"Just how many times can they say inconclusive in these episodes? The show has a bit of merit since it tries to give a better understanding to the UFO phenomeonon, but it likes to repeat the introduction so many times during an episode that it becomes boring.

3162127,1,B0016OCTUS,I feel sorry for the people who paid $35.00 for this as these stories go absolutely nowhere.  Each of these episodes ends negatively with nothing to show but a lot of wasted money.  The funniest part of this whole show is their leader Bill Burns.  He has this nervous eye twitch thing that really makes him look like a first class nut.  They finally slap a pair of colored glasses on him to try and hide this...LOL.  I only paid $6.89 for these DVDs (new) so I don't feel too bad.  I doubt I'd even pay that for future seasons.  I can't beleve the History Channel actually threw funding at this project.  Their other UFO DVDs are so much better.,1242691200,,645,4.316666666666666

3162129,2,B0016OCTUS,"I love ""UFO Hunters."" Whatever you believe about UFOs, this show offers up some great brain candy, and keeps getting better as the seasons progress. History Channel is psyched to have this show.

So was I, until I put in the first disc only to find that this $36 4-DVD set isn't even anamorphic. The show is beautifully shot in hi def with a 16x9 frame, and looks fantastic in broadcast. Even in standard def, there's no reason the 16x9 image on these discs shouldn't fill my 16x9 screen... instead, the picture is windowboxed--small with a thick black border. This is ridiculous, especially considering that so much of UFO research depends on pulling detail out of low-resolution video... der.

History Channel... that's messed up.",1235952000,,732,4.895161290322581
3162130,5,B0016OCTUS,"When I think History Channel, probably the last thing I think of is a UFO documentary. But flat out, History Channel has a gem of a show on their hands and quite possibly the best show they got going on right now.  But the fact is, this show is more than legit and yes, this is history and these guys are trying to find out if these things are real!  It's the best UFO documentary I've seen since ""out of the blue"" and they turned into a season of shows.  4 cool guys, passionate about one thing,""trying to find out if UFO's exist and what exactly they are."" I just came across this show on TV a few months ago and instantly I was hooked and was so happy to see it available on DVD. 4 DVD's, I think 3-4 documentaries on each, about 13 awesome episodes, almost an hour long each, of course no commercials. The presentation, the audio, the narration, everything these documentaries offer is everything a UFO fan desires. They go back to famous locations of the past like Roswell and the most recent locales of Texas sightings of 2007. Each documentary is wonderfully produced and all with eye witness acounts and some with some nice video animations of the alleged UFO sequences.

If you are a UFO fan by any shape or form, and want probably the best documentation and investigation on the subject, you need this DVD collection on your shelf. The only thing I would have liked was maybe some more extras, some directors commentary or some insight from the investigators and learn more about them. But other than no extras, you still got about 15hours of UFO magnificence. Season 2 will rock too when that comes out in April.

Great collection for UFO believers and the UFO Team are professional and thorough.  So happy History Channel is bringing the team back this year with new episodes.

I like the fact that they provide you with all the information that they have and then it is left up to you the make the decision if it is true or false. Some of the stars on this show were previously on a show called UFO FILES. Alot of the stories deal with the same UFO encounters that UFO Files has already dealt with. I like the fact that there is a skeptic on this show who tries to debunk everything. I think that some of the evidence this show provides us with is sometimes shocking. All in all I find the show very enjoyable and cannot wait to see a second season.  From Rosewell, beneath the sea, black boxes from pilots to Betty and Barney Hill, the UFO hunters unravel the truth and leaves us wondering, ARE WE ALONE?",1220745600,,773,4.119205298013245
3162144,1,B0016OCTUS,"If this was their pilot episode, perhaps an auto pilot would have flown it better.  The show's plot line claims to follow a group of 'experts' as they scrutinize some of the most intriguing UFO accounts in UFO history.  However, their two accounts of 'intriguing' UFO stories are as intriguing as watching regular flight traffic over a local airport.

The shows first two investigations are yawners at best which leads me to wonder... if this is the best UFO content they can start a show with, perhaps a visit to a Roswell drinking establishment can help turn the show's content around.

The cast seems to be as about as knowledgeable regarding ETs and UFO investigations as your local community college psychology professor.  Armed with a small bag of tech gear that included a camera and a flash light... It's clear that Nancy Drew has a better chance with investigating UFOs than this team.  Come to think of it... one of the shows female cast members kind'a looks like Nancy Drew!

Armed with a small bag of tech gear that included a camera and a flash light... It's clear that Nancy Drew has a better chance with investigating UFOs than this team.  Come to think of it... one of the shows female cast members kind'a looks like Nancy Drew!

Theres much evidence for Military involement in a lt a cases- Airforce pursuits, radar tracking.  A astronauts have seen and NASA covert behaviour.  Then the Dogfights with UFOs as well.

8263692,4,B0016OCTUS,"The show is obviously biased towards convincing viewers that alien life often visits our planet.  Some information is opinionated and not presented in a factual format and therefore is questionable.
But after watching every episode and doing my own in-depth research, I find the Sum of the Parts to be convincing enough that we are often visited by intelligent creatures of unknown origin.
I don't think we can simply dismiss claims made by Thousands of ordinary citizens who come from all walks of life including military, police, pilots and farmers located on every continent.  Thousands of people claim they have witnessed unknown flying objects and have come in contact with intelligent creatures of unknown origin whose physical appearance and behavior is strikingly similar.
There have been too many of these events to assume they're all hoaxes and all of them never happened.",1388275200,,882,5.204225352112676
