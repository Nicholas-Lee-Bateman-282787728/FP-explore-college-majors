8315959,5,B001KQHPGA,"As someone who was initially attracted to Celtic music by the down-home, no frills,no hubris, minimal stage production aspect paired with stellar musical performances - think of Kevin Burke's quiet demeanor with his astounding skill - I have been a bit put off by all the glitz, glamour, smoke and mirrors or the post-Riverdance Celtic stage show.  Celtic Women and Celtic Thunder make me want to throw up in my Guinness.  So I was initially apprehensive when viewing the beginning of this DVD with its giant stadium setting and rock-star stage set up.  My fears were soon allayed though by the musicality and energy of the show, and after all, Carlos is a rock star!  I am no big fan of pop-filtered trad music, but this music holds its own with sheer musical genius and energy freshly presented with obvious joy and more than ample inventiveness.  None of the guests feels added on as an afterthought, but each contributes to the overall flow and impact of the show.  An excellent set of performances paired with excellent production values, this a a DVD to watch over and over on the big TV with the sound turned up loud.",1232323200,5,1124,4.680203045685279
