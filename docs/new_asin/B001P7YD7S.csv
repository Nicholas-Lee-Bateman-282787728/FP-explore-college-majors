3740838,5,B001P7YD7S,"got this here for my gentleman friends' bert day. tis a fine piece o' entertainment. the squids are a peculiar hick bunch, don't know who got the idea to make a show based on squids but it worked. it's amazin'. i'm hooked. As Dan Halen would promote: buy, buy, buy!!!! (I only wish it came with them free ""zippy wings""!!)",1241740800,10,321,4.366666666666666
3740839,5,B001P7YD7S,"Hands down the best show featuring land dwelling cephalopods ever made. One thing the show has going for it is a total disregard for continuity. It's fun seeing characters mutilated or killed repeatedly. Also, it is a show about hillbilly squids. They live in Northern Georgia and are protected by the Endangered Species Act so they're free to raise hell. In addition to the squids other regular characters include a Sheriff and an evil capitalist named Dan Halen that looks like a....I don't know. He has no knees and looks like half a ball sac. He talks like Orson Welles and is immortal and then there is Krystal. And well, come to think of it, you got a bunch of great characters including the Reverend (another bizarre creation) and the Devil and Jesus too --both as you've never seen them before. Anyway, I've seen hillbilly shows and hillbillies in person and the same with squids and putting the two together to make one creature makes perfect sense. The animation is superb. Crude and decadent as it should be. One aspect of the show that I love is the narration featured on some episodes. Cracks me up like an Easter egg. Just the tone of it. The second volume is even better than the first one. Do it to it.

3740938,5,B001P7YD7S,"Completely great Adult Swim show.  I recently purchased all SB seasons on DVD to simply collect them, especially because Adult Swim has now AGAIN shut down their online web store.

Thanks to Amazon.com i ordered from America. Opted for longest delivery as didn't want to pay import duty to our robbing government but the items still arrived way ahead of expected date despite going to sweden enroute. Bought all 4 sets together(well why not,if your gonna do something why not go the whole hog,or in this case,squid ho ho)! This series just creases me up,dont know why it has never been released here...guess they think we won't understand it or the humour but they are wrong! I can relate to the characters and despite different accents i reckon ive met realife incarnations through my years!

So instead of a lengthy review about something you're about to watch, how bout we both save time, and you just buy it now. That way you'd be about 30 seconds closer to watching this video GOLD.",1311033600,,340,4.014705882352941
3740971,5,B001P7YD7S,"I purchased Squidbillies, Vol. 2 for my son's  41st birthday; last year was Vol. 1 in honor of his 40th. He was so enthusiastic about last year's gift, I had no hesitation about sending him Vol. 2 this year & fortunately, there are several more volumes so I'm covered for a few years.

These DVD's are one of the few gifts my son has ever taken the time to call & thank me for, so they must be really great. I'm going to rent Vol. 1 so we have more shared experiences for conversations. After not having seen him in 15+ years, it's difficult sometimes to find something he will like; these are winners! I look forward even more to our phone calls. The Squidbillies as a healing tool--what a concept!",1305504000,,699,4.32824427480916
3740972,5,B001P7YD7S,"Even though I have the same hair style as he does, Early (and probably even Granny and Rusty Cuyler) would surely hate me on sight, and probably deep-fry me at the first opportunity, to be dipped in hot sauce for a nice snack. I'm an oversized, 58 year old Chalkie male AND A YANKEE. Worse, I'm from California. I've never watched Adult Swim, but I love the Squidbillies anyway. It began with my fascination with cephalopods. I have a library of invertibrate zoology books (Sorry, Early) and documentary videos on squids, octopuses, and cuttlefish. I admit that the fact that the Squidbillies is about squids is what made me check it out in the first place. Bud strangely enough, in my view, one indication of the show's brilliance is that it would be almost as funny if they WEREN'T squids. It would hardly make a difference. The animation is better than any I've ever seen... beautiful, fresh, lively and free... not to mention FUNNY. And yet another indication of its brilliance is that Squidbillies would be ALMOST as funny even without that killer animation. I know because I often LISTEN to show without watching it... still brilliant. Listening without watching allows one to focus on WHAT's being said and HOW it's being said. For me, it's about the voice characterizations and the writing. What can one say about the richness of the Cuylers as fully developed literary characters, who are rarely predictable, yet they are always true to their complex natures and their well developed family history going back for generations... and what can one say about the natural voice characterizations of Early, Granny, Crystal, Lil and all the rest? Brilliant! I am in awe of the performers... and of the consistently killer writing... the stuccato pacing... the irresistable bad taste... It makes me a little bit sad, because I doubt that I will ever be as delighted and blown away again as I have been by Squidbillies. As soon as I discovered them, I bought all three volumes from Amazon and I have been watching them over and over since they arrived. All three volumes are spectacular. Somehow on every episode Team Squidbillies manages to remain relevant, current, original, fresh and even lovable and endearing. I've pre-ordered Volume Four, and I'm anxiously awaiting its arrival. My dream is that Fortier and Willis will publish a book of episode scripts. Things move so fast on the show that it is impossible to savor that brilliant writing. I want to study it at leisure. Experiencing the Squidbillies is like having ol' Trixie (from the Jiggle Hut),along with Lil, Krystal, and Ruby Jean surround you, flip you over, and give you a whole string of rapidfire Tuscaloosa Dumplings. Nobody knows for sure what a Tuscaloosa Dumpling really is, but according to Lil Cuyler, its inventor, ""it's a twist on the classic Cherokee Chin Strap. You top it off with a Montgomery Monkey Tail, and then you finish her with a Gravy Chaser."" Early disputes this, pointing out that he always thought ""it was when a man gives the woman a little Memphis Mouthwash and simultaneously she administers the Birmingham Blister right on the bridge of his nose."" Granny corrects both of them, asserting that the woman gives the man a Biloxi Blister, not a Birmingham Blister. When both Early and Lil reply that it's the same thing, Granny regulates on them, saying indignantly ""Well, I'm from the Old School, where it is NOT the same thing. If you don't see a little cartilage, you ain't even IN Biloxi. And I'm sorry, but Birmingham ain't no fun for nobody."" Now that's Americana!",1302048000,,3564,4.8538587848932675
3740973,5,B001P7YD7S,"I bought this and vol3 as part of my BF's Christmas gift. He LOVES this show. Personally, it's a little too much guy humor for me to enjoy unless I've knocked back a few drinks.

3740983,5,B001P7YD7S,"I love squids. And now that they have a show of their own,I am buying every episode I can. There is nothing funnier on TV than Granny trying to seduce ...well...everybody. Sometimes she wins,but mostly Early shoots her with a sedative-filled syringe. Or worse. Think gasoline.

All of the squids and humans that populate this show are unique,hysterically funny,crass,crude,and totally without morals,except for sweet,stupid Rusty,who has a conscience until it comes to anything mechanical or electronic. Then his morals go by the way side and he is as hedonistic as the other members of his squid family.

There has never been a show like this on TV.""Family Guy"" has restraints because of the network they originate from. MST3k,perhaps the most brilliant show ever,had restraints,too. I love them anyway,but when you watch Granny trying to woo the Reverend,for instance,well...nothing compares in downright crassness and un-PC-like behavior. Thank you,Jesus. Who,by the way,appears only to Granny,and he tries to be her personal behavior-barometer,but fails miserably.

If you like to laugh until you nearly barf or spit out your drink of gasoline all over the living room,by all means,watch this show. You will be incredulous at first,then soon addicted.",1251417600,,1255,5.425641025641026
3740984,5,B001P7YD7S,"This is one of the funniest shows most people have never heard of. If you loved Beverly Hillbillies and enjoy hillbilly humor, you will laugh for days. If you don't laugh at this show, then you have no sense of humor. Plain and simple.",1248652800,,235,4.363636363636363
3740985,5,B001P7YD7S,"Somehow the novelty of the fact that the Cuyler family is one of the rare, endangered ""North Georgia Mountain Squid"" never ceases to be hilarious as they do stuff, usually involving lots of mayhem and insanity and drunkenness.

Unknown Hinson's voice is a goldmine that makes any and all lines spoken by Early into hilarity waiting to happen, or not. The accents, the butchered english, the jokes, the sounds, all the sort of things, all done to a poorly animated, poorly drawn visuals that nevertheless are fun to watch because of their grit and filthiness.

Unfortunately for the show, it's one of those ""Adult Swim"" originals that typically will have a fanbase only as large as a hatebase. As many people would/will hate the show as much as people would love it.

Surprisingly, the creators, in one of the DVD bonus documentaries, take the show idea quite seriously, and detail stories of how hundreds of people put together crappy auditions for the roles, and how they did not want to ""mock"" Southern people or accents, but wanted genuine Southerners in the roles so as to make it sound more natural.

Ultimately, though, the show is about crazed dialogue, overt offensive humor, and seemingly ""random"" things (such as aliens who befriend the Cuyler, and shout ""Death to America!"" at random moments, which no one seems to notice).

This is a show that is immensely quotable.  And inspired me to want a Truck-boat-truck when I grow up.",1246406400,2,1438,4.848979591836735
