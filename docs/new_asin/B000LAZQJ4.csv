2701497,5,B000LAZQJ4,"Animal documentary cameras follow the daily activities of a mob of 12"" high Meerkats living in the African Kalihari desert. Alpha female Flower, her mate, Zaphod, socially inept Uncle Yousarian, slutty daughter Mozart, and the teenagers and pups make up a family unit known as the Whiskers. Their 3 square miles of forage territory must be defended from other mobs such as the Lazuli and Commandos. Leadership is dependent on strong and often ruthless decisions that mean only the alpha female may bear pups, and the fate of the group's breeding age adults becomes a series of illicit one night stands with rival non-related meerkats, and hard learned lessons in meerkat morality that leaves younger wanton daughters ousted for pregnancy. Each meerkat has become a star in the series but some more than other such as loyal Shakespeare who may have died battling the Lazuli raiders while babysitting the infant pups.

Keeping up with the numerous yearly litters of four or five pups means the size of the Whiskers group fluctuates as its members stray, die, or disappear after encounters and fierce battles often to the death. It is a dire existence in which family loyalty is reinforced by mutual grooming, scent marking, and hunting juicy huge scorpions and centipedes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Yummy! And, the meerkats are hunted as well by prey birds and other beasties of the desert environment.

Filmed by Cambridge University for over ten years, and narrated by actor Sean Austin, the family life of small weasel-like creatures takes on all the drama and humor of reality TV shows without having to design dresses or cook gourmet dinners. This is real survivor TV at its best and the often harsh reality of the charming and adorable wild creatures brings to the screen a complex and enormously endearing story of animal behavior, love, life, and death.  With not much imagination, its easy to see the family dynamic of every Thanksgiving dinner ever forced to attend. Enchanting and educational for all ages.",1170892800,16,2022,5.011904761904762

2701501,5,B000LAZQJ4,"Meerkat Manor is a Discovery Channel Animal Planet series shown successfully worldwide. It is a series in the style of a soap opera about a clan of meerkats named ""The Whiskers"" that is the subject of a ten-year study by Cambridge University. The show is narrated by Bill Nighy in the UK, Mike Goldman in Australia, and Sean Astin in the USA. There are a total of 13 episodes in this first season.

The following Meerkats are the major players in season one: Flower is the leader and dominant female of the Whiskers group, and reserves the right to mate for herself. Because she is the leader, she wears a radio collar that enables scientists and film crews to track the group. Zaphod is her partner, the dominant male, and group defender. Youssarian was dominant male of the Whiskers until Zaphod, his older brother, overtook his position. Mozart is one of Flower's daughters that was evicted from the Whiskers by her mother for bearing offspring. Tosca is another of Flower's daughters that was exiled from the Whiskers for bearing offspring, and permanently exiled after taking charge of the Splinters, the larger of two groups created by the temporary breakup of the Whiskers. Shakespeare is one of Zaphod's sons and is quite courageous. He survived two bites of a puff adder and successfully saved Flower's pups from an attack by Big Cy of the Lazuli group of Meerkats. His fate has been a topic of controversy.

The drama can be intense, as life and death are starkly portrayed in each episode. Meerkats within the clan are incredibly dedicated to each other's safety, to the point of risking their lives for the others' survival. Family dedication even extends to the other females lactating so that Flower's pups will be fed by multiple sources. The show reveals that Meerkats don't do well on their own because their very survival depends on lookouts being constantly vigilant while the others dig deep into the ground for their meals of worms, lizards, and the occasional fat millipede. Desert storms wreak havoc, and birds of prey are a constant threat to the pups and occasionally to the adult meerkats themselves. However, in case some violent confrontation does occur, the film crew avoids showing close-ups of the gruesome details. This makes it probably OK for family viewing, although in the case of young children you should probably make that call on a child-by-child basis. ""Meerkat Manor"" does have a lot of value in teaching you much about the daily life and habits of these interesting creatures to the point that you'll probably find yourself caring a little too much about what happens to each of them individually as well as a group. I highly recommend it.",1165881600,33,2682,4.853711790393013

2701517,5,B000LAZQJ4,"A reality shows thats actually real, Meerkat Manor puts to shame all of those pseudo-survival, celeb-sensationalized series that don't deserve to be called reality...actually, Meerkat Manor needs no such comparison, and can easily stand on its own merit. Despite the series having ended years ago, I find myself still thinking about Flower and her extended family, Im grateful to be able to watch this show now from start to finish, and to see all of our beloved meerkats live again.

By the series second half, were all familiar with the research project, and don't need the five-minute reminder which allows for more story in each episode; also the TV rating/disclaimer gets upped from G to PG allowing for a truly uncensored look at the very intimate and very real lives of these amazing creatures who have found their way into our hearts from the beginning. I always cry pretty much all through season 3 when we lost so many of them from Carlos, to Flowers selfless sacrifice, to (Wilson and) Mozarts tragic romance. Though I followed the series into its final season initially, I don't remember having seen the very last episode (season 4) when it originally aired, and finally did in re-runs; Rocket Dogs survival and strength of leadership was mind-blowing.

So intriguing is how vastly different meerkat society is from our own and how their daily life-and-death struggles make so many of our own human problems seem small. By the same token, however, despite all our advances, we are still living in tough times and it often makes me wonder if we are really any different or any better off than they are, which is why we the viewers can so easily relate to their everyday lives. Either way you look at it, you will be moved by and truly come to care about the Whiskers and all of the meerkat families.

I cant think of anything negative to say about Meerkat Manor, except that I wish it had gone on longer than just four seasons, as Im sure the Aztecs, Commandos, Lazuli, Zappa, and of course, the Whiskers are still living their lives to this day, and I would have loved have seen what happened next.

2701538,5,B000LAZQJ4,"I'll admit I didn't see every show, but the very popular ""Meerkat Manor"" series on the Animal Planet Channel, which ran for about 5 years, was one of the best and most endearing ever.  It was true to life, showing the Meerkats in their group ""families"" with all the dangers and excitement of their daily life as they try to survive as a tiny and very cute part of the bigger picture of life in Africa. The show TAUGHT a lot about Meerkats and their environment without making that seem boring at all.
 They live communially and certain Meerkats help ""babysit"" the little ones while the others hunt and forage for food. There is a leader, and an apparently pretty complex system of who does what on a daily basis, but this allows the entire group to survive the best.
The Meerkats are in fact so cute--not just in appearance but their human-like movements and actions--that it is impossible not to relate to them on some level.
The series is narrated---so no ""talking Meerkats""---which I for one agree with.  The Meerkats DO face danger but it is real and believable, and often they are able to get  away. (They are very quick!)
 For the youngest kids, or extremely sensitive people, a warning ahead of time, gently, that life in the wild for ANY animal is dangerous, but MOST of them survive and do well might be a good idea.
I would recommend this beginning DVD in the series, and if it is enjoyed, go on to buy the others.  In my opinion, ""used"" DVDs or blu-rays from Amazon-verified third sellers are worth the slight risk, and generally the third party sellers go out of their way to fix any problems ( for example, to exchange for a better quality one if there is a problem with the DVD).
Highly recommended family series!",1327968000,2,1727,4.519230769230769

Just a warning to others who may be counting on closed captions themselves.",1272931200,,390,4.16
2701540,5,B000LAZQJ4,Best episodes condensed those who don't want to watch numerous shows. It works for me!,1272844800,,86,4.8
2701541,4,B000LAZQJ4,"In real life, meerkats probably aren't very cute, but on ""Meerkat Manor"" they are simply adorable.  The show is culled from material gathered by Cambridge University's Kalahari Meerkat Project, which has been ongoing for a decade.  The researchers carefully track the meerkats, and the show focuses on the most successful family, the Whiskers.  During Season 1, the Whiskers are thriving under the leadership of dominant female, Flower.  She rules the family along with her mate, Zaphod, and she does whatever she needs to do to make sure the family succeeds.  As the dominant female, she is able to mate and decide whether or not the other females in the group can mate as well.  Typically, only the dominant female mates as too many pups make it difficult to feed the family in the harsh Kalahari.  If other females get pregnant, there can be trouble, as we see when two of Flower's daughters deliver pups in Season 1.

The show is simple - we watch the daily routines of the meerkats, which are surprisingly structured.  They awaken, clean the burrow, forage for grubs, babysit the pups, bask in the sun, and then retire to the burrow for the evening.  As such, the episodes can become a bit repetitious, even when the main focus is on unusual incidents (birth of pups, battles with neighboring clans over precious territory, encounters with puff adders).  Fortunately, the producers edit the material creatively, allowing us to get to know the meerkats and their unique personalities, largely via narration by Sean Astin.  Viewers come to care about the Whiskers.  I certainly developed some favorites, particularly Shakespeare (one of Flower's sons), and I was saddened when another favorite (Mozart) was evicted from the clan.

The episodes average only 20 minutes and really zip along quickly without commercial breaks; I can easily watch 4 of them in a sitting.  My only quibble is that the show anthropormorphizes the meerkats to a sometime ridiculous extent.  The animals are acting largely on instinct, but the narration makes them sound far more human.  Of course, that emphasis is a large part of what makes the show entertaining and the meerkats so darned loveable.  So it's a quibble I'm more than happy to live with, even if I sometimes find it a bit too much.",1236470400,,2276,4.9136125654450264
2701542,5,B000LAZQJ4,"This is reality TV.  It chronicles the life and death struggles of a family trying to survive in a dangerous inhospitable climate.  If you open yourself up a little, you'll get emotionally attached to the individual meerkats and their fates will be very important to you.  Nothing compares to the real emotional impact of a creature's real survival or real death.  Fictional and so-called reality TV have nothing on this show.  And unlike most nature shows where the animals are unknown and you have no connection with them, you will know and care about these meerkats.  I can honestly say this is the first and only show that has made me cry.  Don't get me wrong, Meerkat Manor can be quite joyful too--it's not all sad.

In short, if you are an amimal lover or a somewhat caring individual you will love this show.  Don't read anymore about it because you might run across spoilers and this show is best seen without knowing what happens.  Just buy seasons 1-3 and prepare yourself for something you will never forget.  Make sure you get the 'complete' versions though, as there is also a best of set which leaves out a lot of stuff.

2701548,3,B000LAZQJ4,"I decided to order the complete first season of 'Meerkat Manor' after seeing several episodes on tv. The show itself is quite fun and fascinating, and the images and multitude of camera angles is exhilarating. One thing I'm not a huge fan of is the narration, I found it too fluffy for my tastes and not very tight. But that's ok, it's part of the appeal to a greater audience.

One other point, slightly related to my previous comment, but I wish, how to say this, that the show would dig a little deeper into its subject and the subjects' environment? Even so, the show provides considerable enjoyment and entertainment by depicting the meerkats themselves and the developments that take place within their lives, which is loads of good fun...

Finally, I'd like to draw your attention to the Amazon.com version of this first season. The Amazon.com version has no menus within the dvds, and the packaging and presentation are abysmal. Supposedly the first season that you buy at the discovery channel store is better and has more features, so that is something to be aware of.

Anyways, 'Meerkat Manor' is a great show, fun for kids and adults, but it could have benefited from a little more depth.",1214870400,3,1200,4.732057416267943

2701551,5,B000LAZQJ4,"Watching the adorable Whiskers Meerkat family in the wild is both heartwarming and heartbreaking at times. No animal lover could resist the sight of these beautiful meerkats. Their human-like qualities are touching and endearing. These small animals form a strong family bond and fight to the death to protect their own. Flower is the matriarch of this family and she can banish a member for any reason as she did with her poor daughter Tosca. Their lives are full of fun and danger. Each day is a new adventure and it is a pure delight to watch this series. It is amazing at how the daily routine of these small animals are captured in incredible detail. I thoroughly enjoyed Season One and was left wanting more. Each episode is rather short and spends time with information on the previous and next episodes along with the constant explanation of the University of Cambridge's 10 year study on the meerkats. It's impossible to watch one episode right after the other since the DVD menu is not set up with the option to play all episodes. Hit menu and you will be taken to the menu for the episode you just watched. Moving on to the next episode takes several steps. I also think the blank pauses where the commericials would have been inserted could have been left out. With countless hours of meerkat adventures to include the episodes could have been expanded with more footage. Despite these technical issues, MEERKAT MANOR is a pure joy to watch. You won't be able to resist falling in love with them.",1201132800,2,1508,4.672932330827067

2701556,5,B000LAZQJ4,"Mob wars. Family feuds. Illicit affairs.  Yes, these are all parts of Meerkat Manor Season 1.  The nature show with a twist.  The twist being Meerkats.  Meerkats are a cooperative animal that live in family groups ""mobs"". They have a very strict social structure that can get a meerkat evicted for not following the dominates rules.  They are also smart and oh so adorable!  Season 1 is my personal favorite as it introduces us to the Whiskers. Flower, Zaphod, Youssarian, Tosca, Mozart, Daisy and Shakespeare. No finer meerkats ever lived then the original 7!

While all seasons of MM are excellent, Season 1 is much easier on the heart strings.  There are more triumphs then losses, which can't be said for the upcoming seasons.  I highly recommend Season 1 for everyone in the family.  It is educational and immensely entertaining! The episode ""An Awfully Big Adventure"" is one of the cutest things I have ever seen on TV and worth numerous viewings alone.

2701560,5,B000LAZQJ4,"I can't praise this show enough! The true life adventures of Flower Whiskers and her family are not only educational but pure entertainment!

I recommend Season 1 for both the young and old!! Everyone will enjoy watching the antics of America's favorite Meerkat family!

The first season introduces us to the Whiskers Meerkat Mob. It is narrated just perfectly by Sean Astin (Lord of the Rings) and shows what life is like on the Kalahari for these meerkats.

In my opinion, Season 1 is the best season so far (season 3 has just finished airing). This season does not deal with the deaths of meerkats like the following seasons do, therefore making it much more child friendly.

This really is a must have DVD collection for any animal lover!",1193961600,5,742,4.728682170542636
2701561,5,B000LAZQJ4,"[Spoiler Alert!]

Forget ""Survivor"" and ""The Amazing Race."" ""Meerkat Manor"" is the best reality/survivor show ever made. If you missed the beginning, here come the first 13 episodes of the Whiskers family in a two-disc set. These fierce little critters have been called the Sopranos of the Kalahari. But they're not. They're better. What's more, these episodes can be watched by the entire family.

Matriarch Flower is the boss, protecting her family from invading meerkat tribes, such as the Lazuli, making sure the home (burrow) is fit and that all are well fed. Flower, whose recent demise left fans grieving, will be the subject of a 2008 theatrical release, ""Queen of the Meerkats."" It can't come too soon.

The Animal Planet hit is the result of a 10 year study by Cambridge University. Students mix into the footage from time to time, taking notes. During these moments, you realize just how small meerkats are. Adults are about a foot long, pups only a few inches, but when confronting an enemy, these little guys are bigger than life.

Sean Astin's flawless narration moves each episode along from cliffhanger to cliffhanger. The clear Season One favorite is Flower's son, Shakespeare. Whether he's taking a double snake bite for the clan, mentoring a little brother, or squaring off against Big Cy of the Lazuli to protect meerkat pups, he is his mother's son.

Still, there are plenty of personalities to enjoy, including Shakespeare's loving sister, Mozart, and their independent sibling, Tosca, Flower's main squeeze, Zaphod, his nutcase brother, Yousarian, and Carlos, the Don Juan of the Kalahari. Those who have followed the Whiskers through Season Three, can flash back to baby Mitch, who started out as a spoiled mama's-boy bully. And for those who thought Flower was ruthless, we now have Punk, the new queen of the Zappas and her alpha guy, Houdini. Never dull and never contrived, they all have stories to tell.

2701562,2,B000LAZQJ4,"Love This Show... First let me say that. Then let me say, this is an incomplete set. Would have been fine except that the end of one just leaves you hanging as to weather Flower will kill her daughters babies or let them live along with her own babies. I plan to go back and by the one that says COMPLETE SET. If you want it all, go for that. If on the other hand you want the top ten or whatever this 2 disc. set is probably just the ticket. It is sooooo nice to watch the goings on, without the long and frequent commercial breaks that one has to endure on the Animal Planet network. I know their programming is paid for by the commercials but, Lordy there is a ton of em'.

I am a newcomer, as I only recently found out that for some reason, my otherwise Limited Basic Cable plays the Animal Planet channel.  These are interesting animals, and I love the anthropomorphism of the starring meerkats.  And the Frank Zappa and Hannibal the bully references--very clever.

2701578,5,B000LAZQJ4,"Being a South African I have a huge interest in the Meerkat as they are my favourite animal. Some of the farming community come across little one's in the veld left behind on their own and the farmers raise them by hand and keep them as pets.  They are not kept in cages and they are loved and taken care of very well.  We suspect the Meerkat are left behind homeless possibly due to their parents being killed by other animals or what we experience mostly is road kill.  However, I found the DVD's extremely interesting.  Wonderful footage and beautiful photography.  It's almost like watching a ""soapie""!  I laughed and cried at the same time especially when my favourite character, Shakespeare was bitten by a snake.  Although Shakespeare recovered, he later dissapeared from the scene and it was not mentioned what happened to him?  Overall I am very impressed.",1182816000,6,865,4.758389261744966
