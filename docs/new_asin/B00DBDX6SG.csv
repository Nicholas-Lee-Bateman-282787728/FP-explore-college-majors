8591259,5,B00DBDX6SG,"{sarc off} Think about that headline......So why in the world do we vote in politicians that think just like that? Is it self serving voters, low information voters, NO VOTERS? Anyway onto the review. I totally agree with ironhorse completely. I watched this documentary on Parables. TV Christian Streaming (It is inexpensive and it has excellent content that doesn't need a filter!). Christians need to wake up and stop whining and Christian leaders need to stop being chickens and speak up!. Those receiving the ""freebies"" have now surpassed the ones PAYING for the freebies and those receiving the freebies have been pitted against us calling us racist and greedy for not wanting to be FORCED to pay for these takers of freebies! I can't afford it anymore! We are going to lose our freedoms if we don't stop this destructive behavior. Those who don't know history are bound to repeat it and we are a heartbeat away from doing just that! Oh Lord please humble our country to get us back on track! 2 Chronicles 7:14.",1426291200,,1017,4.784090909090909
8591260,5,B00DBDX6SG,This DVD is totally impressive.  Stating the facts of what is coming  The History is well documented  the over all view of this DVD is that every one in this country should see this Documentary  Both Catholic and the members of the Roman Church would be advised to see this DVD  It is not an other crazy going out and off the range of creditable thinking  This is a genuine documentary that would benefit the Christian World and also the Christian like Protestant World The maker of the film made a film stating the facts that as Americans we all need to wake up to the dangers that are upon us.  This film is good for all citizens who want to protect and defend this Nation,1396137600,2,674,4.301587301587301
