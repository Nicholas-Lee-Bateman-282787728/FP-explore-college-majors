1833992,5,B00008BCVW,"This movie was extremely entertaining and with wonderful performances. I have been waiting for the DVD version since I saw it late last year. The whole theater stood up and applauded the experience and i think you will find it well worth the effort. I don't usually write reviews but was appalled that on the basis of one rather snide report this movie was being rated as a non event. This movie has not found the audience distribution it so richly deserves and I hate the idea that based on this other slanted review, it would also be overlooked by the DVD audience. The scenes of Carmen in the movie are worth the money alone and the performance of Fanny Ardant in the title role is a tour de force.",1115769600,11,701,4.4
1833993,5,B00008BCVW,"As one critic put it, the soprano Maria Callas was in a special class, probably one of the greatest opera singers who ever lived with a fiery dramatic quality and equally dramatic looks; she was a goddess in her prime and now a legend; a Greek, her life also had all the makings of Greek tragedy. If anyone warrants a film to be made about her, it is she.  And ""Callas Forever"" delivers.  It is a stunning film and beautiful valentine that goes beyond a love for Callas into an exploration of artistic integrity with gorgeous performances, rich music, scenery, emotion and drama.  It was created by Franco Zeffirelli who knew and loved the woman, and this respect shows.

The story takes place in 1977, several months before Callas died of a heart attack at age 53, when she was living as a recluse in her Paris apartment, her voice a shadow of its former glory and her career ended.  Friends are unable to reach her, but her old manager, Larry Kelly (the superb Jeremy Irons), a gay promoter of rock bands, succeeds in gaining a moment with her where he springs his idea of launching a comeback for her.  He wants to make a film, using her original recordings for the soundtrack, which she can lip synch to.  It wouldn't matter, he reasons, if the recordings are from years before; it is still her voice.  Kelly desperately wants to rescue Callas from the tragic depression into which she has fallen; he knows the great artist is there, longing for the expression that was her life.

Fanny Ardent is an extraordinary Maria Callas, capturing the look, the excitement, the class, the temperament and power -- and the vulnerability.  Thrillingly, Jeremy Irons is Ardent's match.  There are times when the two of them express so much without words that it gave me chills; it is a privilege to see actors and performances of this caliber captured on film.  Callas refuses Kelly's offer, having too much integrity, but he finally succeeds in getting her to play ""Tosca"" live one last time -- as another reviewer mentioned, Zeffirelli brings Callas to life again!  It is grand, moving and heartbreaking, and rich on a scale few movies are, unfortunately, nowadays.  To hear that exquisite voice again is alone sublime.

A great tribute to a legend; a wonderful piece of culture; a moving fantasy for fans, appropriately larger than life and sympathetic.  Highly recommended.",1111449600,26,2368,4.7530562347188265
1833994,5,B00008BCVW,"I've seen this movie in Europe before, and it was such a finely done film by Zeffirelli.  I'm glad to know that they're releasing it in DVD in the United States.  And the leading actress, Fanny Ardant, was such a fine interpreter of Callas' role in life as a woman.  From her fire to her passion for work, it was as if Callas was being called back from her grave to give one final testimony to the world about what her art was really about--and that was an achievement Franco Zeffirelli was truly able to capture on film.  From her vivacious, fiery Carmen, to her jealous Tosca, to her Norma and her Butterfly, all her great roles were played in this movie to give audiences a glimpse of what the great Greek opera singer was really like.  And, since Zeffirelli and Callas were friends, it was no doubt that he would somehow paint a portrait of her life in one of his artistic films.",1105920000,12,883,4.359756097560975
1833995,5,B00008BCVW,"Franco Zefferelli, the director of so many lavish films- among them 1968's Romeo and Juliet, The Taming of the Shrew with Elizabeth Taylor, as well as the designer for sets in big budget operas, and best friend of Maria Callas, has made a movie that ""saved"" Callas. This is his tribute to her. This is a movie that was released in 2002, in Paris and Rome, but that did not make its way to American audiences until recently. It's soon to be released on DVD. For some Americans, this movie is a foreign film, another Zefferelli egocentric vehicle. To others, the opera fans, this is a gorgeous re-telling of the final days of Maria Callas and a portrait of her as an artist. And finally, there is a large [...] audience that would appreciate this film. Zefferelli himself is a gay man and in the past, when such lifestyle was taboo and controversial, he could not incorporate such themes in his movies. But this, his latest film, uses a gay character (played by Jeremy Irons) who manages a rock band and who launches a project for Maria Callas to make a ""comeback"" when she had been away from the limelight for years in Paris, 1977, when this film takes place.

Fanny Ardant plays Maria Callas, not an easy role for any actress to undertake. There are moments when Ardant becomes Callas- she imitates the diva's facial expressions (intense ones, angry ones) and her movements accurately. Her artistic integrity is the theme. Eventhough this director offers her to reappear as an actress with vocal dubbing from an old recording of hers of her voice, Callas refuses because she has too much integrity. A lot of the moving scenes are when we get a range of emotions from Ardant- especially the scene in which she hears a recording of Madame Butterfly and she breaks down in tears. That's difficult to watch. But in this movie, Callas is rescued. It was Zefferelli's own personal fantasy that he would save her. He made her come alive again. At the end of the movie, after getting her strength back, and even killing off the memory of Onaissis her ex husband who married Jackie Kennedy- she kills him in her mind when she plays Tosca one last time and stabs Scarpia, Scarpia substituting for Aristotle Onaissis. These subtle things express Zefferelli's wish to have been Callas' savior. This movie will be a treat for Maria Callas fans. I really enjoyed it. It was powerful and moving and very well-written, even humorus and poignant. Callas is back. But then again she never left. Her legacy lives on in recording albums and the few films that captured her dramatic power.",1104364800,70,2568,4.68141592920354
1834005,5,B00008BCVW,"AMAZING portrayal of Callas! I do wish the story was her ""True Life Story"" and not a ""what if"" story. Still it's very interesting and the actress is perfection. They should use her to make a life story that is 100% fact.",1448668800,,220,4.261904761904762

I don't know what Maria Callas would have thought of this film and true opera performers may find the story silly, but I enjoyed the ""what if"" scenario of Maria Callas returning to opera. Maria's singing is phenomenal. The movie does make one think about what happens when you lose a gift that has defined your life.

I am not sure why the critics are always so hard on Zefferelli, and certainly the acting and settings and plot can't be faulted. I guess if one is not interested in clasical music it may seem less interesting to begin with. I am not an avid opera fan, but do enjoy it when the performers suit my ear, but there is something about Callas and her whole life story that is  fascinating and tragic in a way worthy of an opera itself. This movie shows her life as we wish it had ended.  It sure made me long to see her do Carmen.",1441497600,,653,4.09375

1834013,2,B00008BCVW,"It is fascinating to find that 94% of the reviewers of this film here at Amazon rate it 2 to 4 stars (from ""it's OK"" to ""I love it"") to a movie that is a dull travesty, a ludicrous film, 120 minutes of which only the last 30 approach anything remotely to be considered inspiring. And remember that Ms. Callas was Zeffirelli's best friend, or one that bewitched him.

The grotesque joke is that the premise of the film is based on what can be magnificent fuel to all of Callas' enemies----and they are infinite.
The basic ""contraption"" is that Callas is despondent, a recluse, it is 1977 (the same year that she dies)  and her close friend, a film director, convinces her to go into the studio and lip-synch arias from ""Carmen"" as an actual cinematic story (not a concert). She goes along with the concept, very reluctantly for a long while.
The ""joke"" as I say, is that Callas was, and continues to be considered an ACTRESS, not a great singer by any possibility, by many, many people who do not understand and cannot recognize the profundity of her art. I myself, a great Callas fan since I heard her voice in film (cannot remember) where she was singing ""Addio del Passato"" from Traviata, recognized a voice that was not, decidedly the beautiful voice of Victoria de los Angeles, by any chance, and yet moved me to tears with her delivery. A friend and I have had countless arguments about this. And people continue to. The FACT is that, yes, the voice was imperfect, and she was an actress (and what an actress, from what I read, and snippets that I have seen that do not exactly convey this reasoning) but more than an actress thanks to her physicality, her acting was the VOICE itself. The greatest of opera singers are not the ones who deliver the highest notes but those that can simply utter a phrase with so much humanity, so much wisdom that they are incomparable. That was Callas.
With this lip-synching that she is convinced to do Zeffirelli, again, is telling us that, after all, we can unite the recordings with her great acting, which she purportedly still has and presto! we have a magnificent movie. But Callas was an artist of the greatest dignity and standards and this whole thing would turn out to be a ridiculous pantomime.

It is even ""sadder"" since you have three actors of very high caliber: Joan Plowright, Fanny Ardant, and Jeremy Irons. All of them go through the paces with the most ridiculous of screenplays. Ms. Plowright has to deliver lines like: ""This is 1977----Satan is redundant"". The mediocrity is everywhere.
Perhaps it isn't surprising, as I just discovered that, along with some great moments as a director, hideous things like ""The Blue Lagoon"" with Brooke Shields are part of his ""repertoire""---not to mention a rather recent fiasco with his staging of ""Tosca"" at the Met in NY.
No, I think that Callas would have been deeply dissatisfied with this ""paean"" to her: he certainly could have thought something better. Not to mention that Fanny Ardant does not look AT ALL like a woman who is about to die of a heart attack within months! She looks magnificent, the very portrait of health, and by then Callas was a broken woman.
Of course, it is all fantasy, but you are stretching the truth with this.

As well, this man does the very unimaginative thing to act as if this is the 1950's, when every movie had to have a love affair inserted no matter the subject, and so does he, showing his lack of imagination: Irons is gay, but being 2002 Zeffirelli  decides NOT to have Irons' young male stud even share a kiss, and Callas herself has a tentative moment with her lead from the picture---this is all thrown in as nothing more than filler.
Again, it is simply unimaginable that any great artist, as dignified and with an ego the size of a supernova (which she has been since, say 1950) would have in any way accepted the ludicrous project of acting out a movie moving her lips to the recordings that made her the international star she remains, without breaking down.

Let me put it to you this way: the GREATEST moment in the film is the credits as they slowly roll by........why is that???
Callas sings ""Vissi D'Arte"" from Tosca in the background and it is a moment where you know that every Callas fan remained seated unlike all the other movies where everyone, rather rudely, runs for the door.
That hands it to you in a nutshell.............",1427846400,,4388,4.590561224489796

1834032,5,B00008BCVW,Ardant is a perfect Callas.  I enjoyed the Carmen scenes immensely. I regret that Callas did not permit the dubbing of her voice to present visual productions of her famous roles.  What a treasure they would have been.,1398556800,,218,4.7105263157894735
1834033,4,B00008BCVW,"While we have heard of Maria Callas as an opera singer and lover of Onassis, this movie offers insight into her life and personality.  Director Franco Zeffirelli was a personal friend of Callas and brings her back in a story in which he imagines a different end for her.  What if he were to enable Callas to have a successful comeback after her voice was gone?  How could that happen?

Jeremy Irons plays a manager who dreams of using technology to marry Callas' early recordings with a movie of her performing the role.  Callas agrees to play the role of Carmen, one of which she has sung but incredibly never played on stage.  Zeffirelli's fantasy of what that would be like, and look like, and what it would do for Callas is a diverting exercise.  As Callas, Fanny Ardant plays the ultimate diva in all of her tempestuousness and talent.  Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel costumed her.  For opera lovers and Callas' fans, you will wish this actually could have transpired.  Perhaps it would have saved the diva, and prevented her early death in her 50's?

Watching this film will make you feel wistful that such talent came to an early end.  Think of the students she could have taught or inspired, the opera companies she may have run or the operas she may have directed.  This film may motivate you to want to hear more of her recordings or read a biography about her.  This film educated me more than entertained me.  That Zeffirelli wanted to do this film tells us that Callas was a compelling character in his life.  I was fascinated by her in watching this film.",1388275200,2,1563,4.548387096774194

1834069,3,B00008BCVW,"The facts of the last years of Callas' life are well known. After an endless concert tour (1972-1974) which was a financial success but an artistic disaster,  her voice gone, Onassis, the great love of her life, dead, she rarely received guests, and went out less frequently. Locked away in her palatial apartment on Avenue Georges Mandel in Paris, she preferred to play cards with the butler and chauffeur, tended to by her faithful maid, Bruna. Although she had patched up the famous quarrels with her mother and sister, they remained on the periphery of her life. Her friend, the pianist Vasso Devetzi, who has been accused by many of the financial mismanagement of the Callas estate (and by Zeffirelli of murder !-only hinted at in the film) was her only regular companion-she doesn't even appear as a character in the film. Callas died in her apartment in 1977. The official verdict, a heart attack, despite persistent rumors of suicide and Zeffirelli's claim of murder.
Zeffirelli, the director of many of her stage triumphs, and an estimable film director, seems to have misfired with this film. A big part of the problem is that he disregards the facts and opts for a fantasy plot where the diva is coaxed out of retirement to do a film of Bizet's CARMEN using her 1964 recording as a soundtrack. (Way back in 1964, Zeffirelli had been the catalyst in a TOSCA film for Callas, indeed her stereo re-make of that opera was recorded to be the soundtrack. The film was never made.) A film about a very famous woman who becomes a recluse and why that might happen could be very interesting. A film that indulges in a game of 'what if' is very much less so. It IS very entertaining, but the known facts could have made for something much deeper.
Fanny Ardent is very appealing as the great diva, and even succeeds in looking like her. (Although she doesn't have those enormous and hypnotic Callas eyes.) She doesn't even attempt the Callas speaking voice, part upper-crust English, part Washington Heights. Her French accent is disconcerting. Although she is not the actress I would have chosen for this role, she does fine work.
Jeremy Irons plays a character named Larry Kelley, who seems to represent Zeffirelli himself. An entrepreneur and agent, it is he who orchestrates the diva's comeback in the film. (The real Lawrence Kelley, who was involved with Callas' appearances with The Dallas Opera and her appearances in Bellini's IL PIRATA with the American Opera Society in the late 1950s had passed out of her life many years before the events in this film.) Irons, is an estimable actor and he has some really fine moments here.
Joan Plowright as Sarah, a journalist and publicist who is Callas' friend provides a down to earth foil for the melodramatics of Ardent and Irons.
Jay Rodan, as Michael, Kelley's hearing impaired gay lover is the most appealing character in the film, and his difficult relationship with Kelley is admirably portrayed.
If you love Callas, you will be entertained, but as a dramatic recreation of Callas' last years, clearly there are other films to made !",1280102400,4,3092,4.801125703564728

1834071,4,B00008BCVW,"... generally, I very much-agree with the reviews already posted; I agree that this film springs-alive whenever Fanny Ardant is on-screen, and that Jeremy Irons' performance is disappointing... his storyline is actually fine, but the performance, by this very distinguished actor, whom I shall always remember as ""Charles Ryder"", does not do-credit to his body-of-work, over all.

I'd like to add one new thought, however...

Being of a certain age, and a lifelong opera-devotee, I remember, with great sadness, the passing of this great star and artiste. I was well-acquainted with the sadness of her personal life and the torture brought-on by the decline of her career. As her career began its decline, but while still concertizing, she is reported to have said of her dissatisfied (her belief)audience(s): "" I can hear them out-there in the dark, writhing in their seats, hissing like serpents"" ... ""the voice will no longer obey"" . If, in fact, she did say this, it is not difficult to understand her eventual shutting-away of herself, far from those who no longer believed in her talent (again, her belief).

I was always so sad to believe that her final days were lonely, unhappy and broken-hearted (Onassis), and believing herself to be bereft of her once-great voice and career. Without stating ""like"" or ""dislike"", I shall say that I am very ""glad"" for this film, as it allows me to see those final days in a very different way. This film affords us a vision of la- Callas as a woman who has reclaimed her grace and wisdom, allowing herself to accept who she is.. at that time... allowing the past to remain in the past... as a beautiful memory, and remaining faithful to the core of her great artistry: her honesty. I think the final scene ""on the park bench"" is very telling, as it discloses that sentiment we all must and should face... in the end: it's not about what our achievement has conferred upon us, what's really important is the acceptance of our being, simply, a man... a woman. As a parallel, it's easy to recall that wonderful monologue, in the stalled car, in AllAboutEve, when the great Bette Davis sums-it-up: ""in the end, every woman must accept that, whatever else she may have done... or may have achieved in her professional life, she is, simply... and remains simply... when its all-over...a woman.

There is great beauty in the grace of acceptance, acceptance without remorse or rancor... and in the end, I hope as much for myself. This movie allows us to see the Callas I prefer to keep as my memory of her final days... AND shall be able to keep as memory: such is the power of the cinematic experience. For that, I say that I am ""glad"" for this film, and...

1834072,4,B00008BCVW,"Very rarely, but it does happen, an actor or actress recreates a historical personality to the letter. This requires far, far more than just a physical resemblance; it requires an actor's genius.  Some fine examples:  Albert Finney as Winston Churchill in ""The Gathering Storm."" Or David Straithern as Edward R. Murrow in ""Good Night and Good Luck."" Or Marion Cotillard as Edith Piaf in ""La Vie en Rose. ""  Even Meryl Streep as Julia Child in ""Julie and Julia."" Now, Fanny Ardant recreates Maria Callas. Put bluntly, she is simply sensational. Any one who has ever seen Callas perform will be amazed at how perfectly Fanny Ardant captures the essence, the fire, the movements, and the ""great gaze"" of the opera star.  Even in the close ups, it seems so.

The film is not a biopic but a love letter to Callas...imagining what might have happened if (at the end of her career) Callas had allowed her talent to be displayed on screen. And Fanny Ardant, as Maria Callas, and as Carmen, shows how alluring an older woman can be...even as a gypsy seductress.

The performances of Jeremy Irons and Joan Plowright are competent enough but let there be no doubt, this film belongs to Fanny Ardant.  As Maria Callas she makes an eloquent statement about ""integrity"", about ""truth"" in artistic expression.

For those interested in cinema history, Maria Callas does appear as an actress in film - but just once - in a version of the ancient tragedy ""Medea.""  True, she does not sing in the picture, but Callas does display extraordinary presence as ""a woman of consequence,"" a woman not to be trifled with at any level.  In fact the shoots of Callas' face and the exceptionally interesting landscapes and strange buildings are the reasons to see the film.

See ""Medea"" and ""Callas Forever"" together and compare the performances.",1243468800,2,1816,4.807073954983923
1834073,5,B00008BCVW,"Purists will probably cringe...let'em! FOREVER CALLAS is a wonderfully imaginative look at the final days of opera diva Maria Callas as formed from the ""fantasy and relationship"" (which is stated in the film credits),by her dear friend, Zeffirelli as only he could do. The real triumph of this film is the acting of the ""Meryl Streep"" of France, Fanny Ardent, who looks and acts the part of the diva in all of her faded glory at the age of 53. The original recordings of Callas in her prime are used in this recreation and it is a stunning tribute to the great star who was former lover to Aristotle Onassis before he dumped her to wed Jackie Kennedy. If you know the acting of Ardant(COLONEL CHABERT,ELIZABETH), then you will appreciate the fact that she as a Frenchwoman playing a Greek who speaks English with an Italian accent (that is quite an accomplishment!) and that her co stars are none other than legends Jeremy Irons and Joan Plowright as her agent and journalist respectively. This is a quick and sprightly look at the the world of the glory that was and explores the theme of trying to regain youth again. Excellent relaxing film viewing and the music is glorious!",1196640000,4,1178,4.668269230769231
1834074,4,B00008BCVW,"I am going to begin with a disclaimer. While I am an avid opera lover, I am not a Maria Callas fanatic. I'm not a Callas hater either. Those who love and loathe Maria Callas know every intimate detail of her life, both on and off the stage, have memorized her recorded legacy, both the official releases and the pirated recordings, and live, breath and die all things Maria Callas. I admire and appreciate her voice, and will admit there are some roles that Callas could do as no one else could, but I would say I have more of a fondness for her than anything else. I say this because as I've heard and read some of the reviews of the film, both on Amazon and in print, Callas lovers seem to have strong opinions of it: they're in love with every aspect of it, or pan it entirely.

The film takes place in the 1970's and Maria Callas (played by Fanny Ardant) has become a recluse. The events of her life are well known. In her pursuit of and failure to capture the love of Aristotle Onasis, a love that seemed at times to be cruelly unrequited, Callas' voice has deteriorated and even though she still could have performed based on persona alone, she hides away in a Paris apartment. Her manager Tom Kelly (Jeremy Irons) hates his new role as an agent for a punk rock band known as ""Bad Dreams"" and hopes to convince Callas, whom he once represented, to star in a film version of CARMEN. Well aware that her voice would be inadequate, he tries to convince her to do the equivalent of lip syncing. Callas' temperament gets in the way of anything happening, but at the convincing of reporter Sarah, a friend to Callas and Kelly, (played by Joan Plowright), Kelly works to get Callas to do the film version of an opera she recorded, but never performed on stage.

The film is based on some facts as well as some creative ""what if's"" by director and friend Franco Zeffirelli. Any film or stage production under Zeffirelli's direction is lavish down to the minutest details, and CALLAS FOREVER is no exception. Fanny Ardant has Callas' mannerisms, voice, and quirky ways mastered to perfection. She captures Callas' intensity when performing the operatic roles, whether it be the staging of the film version CARMEN or when she recreates the roles in her imagination. Ardant's portrayal of Callas is that of an artist as well as a famous personality. Jeremy Irons is good as Tom Kelly, portraying him as ruthless but also concerned about his former star. Joan Plowright`s portrayal of the fictional character Sarah was stellar. It's her empathy for Callas that motivates Kelly and her determination keeps Callas from becoming a total recluse. Some have commented that the Tom Kelly character and Sarah are actually two versions of Zeffirelli. Zeffirelli was one of Maria Callas' loyalist friends and did try to get her to star in film version of her operas well after she left the stage.

When the film concentrated on opera and the person of Callas, it was at its best. Kelly's pursuit of love and his punk rock band seemed to distract. More scenes of Callas recalling her stage triumphs would have been far better, at least for me. Still, it's a great story and any opera lover, Callas aficionado or not, should enjoy it.",1185494400,2,3217,4.601045296167247
1834075,3,B00008BCVW,"When I watched the movie in the movie theater originally few years ago, the sound was so perfect. The movie itself moved me so mainly because of the powerful sound. So, I purchased the DVD few years later because I could not forget the emotional effect this movie had on me. I was shocked to learn that the DVD sound track was awful. Somebody has to have absolutely no sense of music to make a DVD for production without checking the quality of the sound. For this movie it was a killer. I am so disappointed; I want to return this DVD.",1162080000,5,536,4.264705882352941
1834076,5,B00008BCVW,"Fanny Ardant said that she wanted to do this role because the script gave her the opportunity to have every emotion, and then on top of that, she would be playinig Maria Callas (apparently she had played Callas onstage in ""Master Class"" before doing this film).  She was right.  The words ""tour de force performance"" are tossed around a lot, but this is what the phrase is about.  Fanny Ardant proves herself to be one of the best film actresses around in this film. Ardant is simply magnificent.
 Fellini's direction is at it's finest and tightest here.  His love of the theatrical gets its rightful venting in the scenes of rehearsal, and of the film within the film; but there are no extraneous flights of fancy.  To me, Jeremy Irons and Joan Plowright are usually very much the same in every film, but they are greats, and they provide a perfect platform for Ardant to dive off of.
 I recently saw the disappointing ""Being Julia"" in which Jeremy Irons also appears.  Everything that film lacks, is here in this perfect, truly loving (warts and all) tribute to an immortal great.  You do not have to like Opera to appreciate this film, and if you don't it is handled here in a way that will keep you engaged.  If you do have an appreciation for Opera, and for great acting...you will have moments- as I did- of chills, and tears.  Much more than being a tribute to Opera, this is an excellent  tribute to the arts and to artists.  Brava",1161561600,26,1439,4.5096525096525095
1834077,5,B00008BCVW,"I am not a professional movie critic who must judge a movie for its Oscar capabilities or its position in the world of cinema.  I am not an opera ""expert"" who feels that tampering with a classical masterpiece (such as Carmen) is an abomination.  Nor am I seeking revenge against any of the following: Franco Zefferelli, Jeremy Irons, Fanny Ardant, or Maria Callas.

I am one who loves movies, all kinds of movies, with my favorites being manner comedies in sumptuous settings.  CALLAS FOREVER is part bio-picture, part comedy of manner, and part masterpiece.  All I ever expect a movie to do is to entertain me.  I dabble in Opera.  I have the 1962 Callas Carmen CD with Nicolai Gedda as Don Jose and the Orchestre du Theatre National de L'Opera de Paris conducted by Georges Pretre, which is the music in the movie.  Although not an opera snob, I find this CD particularly enjoyable as it is Callas at her peak.  The way Zefferelli used this opera version illuminates the opera book, the characters, and THE music, for those who may want to purchase a copy of the recording.  There are many versions of Carmen for sale on CD, but this must be the best.

Zefferelli set out as a business associate and close personal friend of Callas to show her the way that she was in her final days.  He completely accomplished this by the film CALLAS FOREVER.  Although, the plot is part fictional, it is a suitable vehicle to accomplish its task.  It is Fanny Ardant that brings the entire production to fruition.  He says repeatedly during interviews that ""she is more Callas than was Callas.""  That is reason enough for me to accept this film from both an intellectual/artistic one and an emotional one, as Fanny Ardant made me feel that I have known Callas way more personally that by just merely listening to her sing on record or reading something.  Ardant is absolutely amazing in this role.

Moreover, the gay subplot and the drama centered around artistic integrity are what makes this film real to me and not just a bio-pic.

I will continue to read the other critics, but I will always follow my heart.",1154390400,6,2100,4.611859838274933
1834078,4,B00008BCVW,"This was a very compelling movie, and beautiful to watch.  The glaring fault in Fanny Ardant's otherwise excellent portrayal, which obviously can't be helped, was her heavy French accent - in every fictionalized drama I've seen where Maria Callas appears as a character  (The Greek Tycoon, TV movies about Jackie Kennedy or Aristotle Onassis, etc) Maria is played as either having a thick Greek or Italian accent, when, as any documentary will show, she spoke with a definite American accent, only with a couple of grammatical slips and vocal inflections from having lived in Europe so much in adulthood. I wonder if any drama will ever depict Callas speaking as she actually did.

It was also an unnecessary annoyance to have Jeremy Irons' character manage that unseen British punk band. We could have done without hearing that very bad parody of what was supposed to resemble early punk rock music (but was just bad 70's rock pop music, not even heavy metal) in the opening credits.

All this depiction does is date Zefferelli's efforts and make an inaccurate foray into supposedly being ""with it.""  There seemed to be about the entire characterization of Irons an attempt at a more contemporary portrayal of a worldly man being cool or hip, rather than a late 1970's ambience. He just seemed too flashy and involved with the trendy interests of the day to be seriously taken as an opera devotee who worshipped Callas and truly wanted to resurrect her career, although it made his character believable that he'd attract such a youthful, sexy boyfriend - who was scarcely developed as a character himself; should have had a more dramatic meeting with Callas, more interaction with her, etc - it would have been fine to develop the interesting gay love story a little more, see what happened to the characters and their relationship (salvagable, resurrected?) after Callas died, their sad reactions to her demise and so forth - but then again, it was ""right"" that the last scene was Callas strolling away in the Paris sunlight.

I give this movie 4 stars for the effort, for the sheer beauty of the film and the fact that there isn't a single dull, draggy moment - the viewer is mesmerized throughout, and the best scenes, accent aside, are of Callas as a lonely recluse in her elegant Avenue Foch apartment, taking pills and being anxiously attended to by her faithful maid Bruna.  Ardant as Callas miming to the Madame Butterfly recording is heartbreaking.  I'm glad Franco Zeffirelli at least came close to realizing his dream and making the film about Callas he always wanted to.",1144713600,10,2583,4.867881548974943
1834079,3,B00008BCVW,"Since opera itself presupposes a suspension of belief - to sacrifice reason for the glorification of the passions through music and spectacle, Zeffirelli's premise in ""Callas Forever"" is easier to swallow. Maria Callas, that diva extraordinaire of the 1950's, became a Paris recluse in the 1970's with the death of her beloved Onassis and the loss of her beloved voice. Zefferelli asks, ""What if"" she could have been persuaded (as he attempted in real life) to step into the limelight once again? And so he invents a representation of himself under the guise of Callas' former business manager/promoter, and presents the Maria Callas of 1977 with an offer: Using modern recording technology, create a filmed presentation of Bizets Carmen while simultaneously dubbing the soprano's current voice with that of her former greatness. Since Carmen was an opera she sang but never performed, this could be a fresh approach to introduce one of yesterday's stars to a modern audience. Is this a fraudulent trick? Perhaps, but nonetheless the voice is Maria Callas, and so too the presence the audience will see on the screen. But still this disingenuous ruse poisons Callas' integrity, and her desire to perform once again falters. ""Once there was a voice,"" she says with the glimmer of past glory, which fades as she solemnly closes the lid to her piano. Since Zeffirelli himself was involved in many of Callas's greatest successes, he becomes as much a part of ""Forever Callas"" as the cast of characters within, and so ""Callas Forever"" becomes a cinematic love letter and an expression of his loss . . . his longing to bring Callas back from the dead. ""What if she had accepted his offer?"" And Fanny Ardant's absorbing performance goes a long way toward putting flesh to the legend, and her success was so complete that Zeffirelli himself has stated that his recollections of the real Callas were being absorbed by Ardants performance and he was no longer certain who the real Callas was anymore. Still, the greatness of Ardant's performance and even the beauty of the soundtrack (the real Callas!) cannot make up for the films many weak subplots. It's as if Zeffirelli put all his creative energy into the realization of Maria Callas, forgetting that he was also making a movie.",1139356800,14,2273,4.952879581151833
1834080,1,B00008BCVW,"This film does not work on any level.  The acting is, at best, adequate.  However, Fanny Ardant fails entirely to capture Callas' studied refinement and, when attempting to show Callas as carried away with the music, Ardant appears more drunk or stoned than concentrated.  And, this is to say nothing of her senseless and distracting accent.

Jeremy Iron's character of the impressario is a cliche of a homosexual.  And this is to say nothing of his senseless and distracting pony-tail.  Joan Plowright's character is just unnecessary to the film.

The musical sequences are the only somewhat redeeming aspects of this otherwise tedious two hour affair.  The rest of the film is just sloppy: the clothing is not in keeping with the 1977 setting; the Mercedes which chauffers Callas through town is a 1980's model; the operatic scenes are truncated, such as the end of Act II from Tosca, from which quite a few lines of music are eliminated; even the ""Japan"" concert to which the film refers many times was actually a London concert.

Zeffirelli claims the film to be in honor of his ""friend"" Callas.  Sadly, it operates as an insult to her dignity and artistry.",1137110400,18,1161,4.847715736040609
1834081,3,B00008BCVW,"Understandably, Franco Zeffirelli loved this woman, and wanted to show this affection on the screen.  But the picture doesn't match the person.

Maria Callas was a drawn, bitter woman at the end of her life, with a severe addiction to medications that would have made the premise of the film impossible.  She is shown as a beautiful woman, and a caring woman, with a strong accent when she spoke English . . . Maria Callas was born in America and had no such accent, which took away from the fealty of the character.

I would rather remember Callas as I saw her and heard her and read about her during her lifetime  . . that is satisfaction enough for my memory of her.  This picture would have been better as a biopic than as the practically complete fiction that it is.",1130630400,7,771,4.432624113475177
1834082,3,B00008BCVW,"There are two excellent things about this movie: Fanny Ardant as Maria and the remastered recordings of the Callas arias.  The director obviously chose the ones showing the voice at its prime.

There are also two bad thngs about this movie:  The gay life of the character that Jeremy Irons plays (why was it necessary?) and the Joan Plowright roll.  What was that all about?

It's obvious that Franco Zeffirelli had a deep love and respect for Maria Callas.  It shows in every frame.  He was lucky to have gained her confidence and friendship.  I had a memorable, but brief encounter with Callas on her ill fated tour with di Stefano.  After the San Francisco recital, she gave me an autographed picture which I shall treasure all my life.  There was hardly anyone in the opera house for her appearance.

This DVD is worth watchng.  I only wish Zeffirelli had gone deeper into Callas the woman and Callas the singer.  It left me wanting more!",1129852800,5,942,4.636363636363637
1834083,3,B00008BCVW,"There is not a whole a lot to be said about this film since it's brief, low-key, overly-conversational, and not biographical enough to provide the viewers a vision of how the Diva of the century rose to the top and became depressed and lost her passion for singing in her later years. Fanny Ardant gave a convincing performance of Callas, but it's unfortunate the role is limited to doing some lipsynching and display of the Diva's temperaments. Callas still hasn't come to terms of with her last ""shameful"" performance in Japan before going into a near 20 year hibernation mode, and resisted the outside world including her loyal gay manager played Jeremy Iron. She thinks her career is over while he relentlessly tried to revive her and convince her to make her comeback by making an opera film named Carmen which would not used her current singing voice but would dubb it with her singing from her early works. Well, things didn't quite turn out the way everyone wanted, and certainly the Diva didn't want to fool the world with Carmen, and demanded to have the film destroyed...

While the performances from both Iron and Ardant are touching and funny at times, the film is still rather dull even for if it's  made for TV. The set design and costumes were quite an eye-candy. several of her Callas greatest hits were used in this film. Joan Plowright is unerused as the self-proclaimed ""vampire"" publicist. It could've been a very powerful and inspirational experience if the film had explore the overall lifetimes of Callas and not just one chapter. I am left unsatisfied by the lack of knowledge and music provided by Callas Forever.",1128470400,2,1639,4.787985865724382
1834084,2,B00008BCVW,"A big reason why Callas is so revered, more than a quarter-century after her death, is her mystique.  Sure, she lived in the public eye, and left a vast legacy on record, but she wasn't visually documented much during her brief prime, and her status of the greatest singing-actress of the 20th century rests largely upon the credibility of those old enough to have seen her onstage.

This movie has some howlingly-awful character types.  You have the boorish, egocentric rock producer; the dowdy British journalist (where the hell did they dig up that ugly hat?); and the twinky gay artist.

Some situations are so hackneyed, it's hard not to roll your eyes.  The boy-toy artist, who brings La Callas up to his studio, presents her with a painting supposedly inspired by her Casta Diva.  The painting itself looks like a sophomore-level art project, yet Callas is so taken with it that she hangs it in her dressing room during the filming of Carmen. What?

Curiously enough, this film, which would best appeal to opera fans, and fans of Callas specifically, insults its audience.  What about that tacky dig at Renata Tebaldi?  Or that tired scene that serves to teach us about how much of a workaholic Callas was in rehersal?

Then there's the occasional bit of dialogue that can give you indigestion, like when Callas claims that being outside is ""overrated"".

One feels bad for Zeffirelli, who concocted this film as a tribute to a friend and legend. He would have fared better by giving us a film epic about her life, instead of this incredulous bit of fiction about the end of it.",1127088000,10,1584,4.744525547445256

confused and irritated by homosexuality.  Although Ardant is a

like her.  I'm not sure the technology ""used"" in the film to create

""Callas Forever"" (the Carmen film) even existed in 1977: the whole concept is cartoon-ish and

She conveys Callas's strength of character, and at the same time her vulnerability. Less successful in the ""Zeffirelli"" role is Jeremy Irons. He is miscast and appears uncomforatble in the film. And what is Joan Plowright doing there? She slurs most of her dialogue, suggesting she has been on the turps (off screen).

1834097,4,B00008BCVW,"Fanny Ardant's resplendent performance and the passion of Maria Callas' voice are the jewels in this otherwise flawed film. Ardant's physical similarity to Callas is astounding, but more than that, she has captured her gestures, her intensity, and the regal presence that made her an operatic goddess with no equal. The fantasy plot is a wonderful one...an empresario (Larry Kelly, played by Jeremy Irons), has the idea to make a film that is a combination of Callas as she is, melded to the voice she had in recordings 2 decades earlier. Selling this idea to Callas is not easy, as she is in mourning for her lost voice, and her lost love, Ari Onassis. The film takes place in 1977, the year Callas left us for the big Opera House in the sky.

When Ardant is on the screen, this is a brilliant film, when she is not, it falls apart. The sub-plot of Larry's here today and gone tomorrow affair with Michael (Jay Rodan) causes the film to lose focus, and it is diminished and muddied by it. The operatic portions however are a total delight, with Ardant/Callas filming the opera she recorded but never performed, Bizet's ""Carmen."" As her Don Jos, Italian actor Gabriel Garko is excellent. Director/writer Franco Zeffirelli knew Callas well, and knows opera (he was doing opera sets as far back as the early 1960s) equally well. This film is a testament to their great friendship, and though I don't think this film will appeal to a wide audience, opera fans, and especially Callas admirers, will love it.

A marvelous bit of casting is Joan Plowright as Sarah, a journalist and friend of the fabulous diva. She is a superb character actress, and perfect for this witty role. Justino Diaz is seen briefly as Scarpia in ""Tosca"", and Chanel, the couturier who dressed Callas, made the gorgeous outfits for Ardant. Some of the music selections heard as well as ""Carmen"" and ""Tosca"" are: Bellini, ""Casta Diva"" (""Norma""), Puccini, ""Donna non vidi mai"" (""Manon Lascaut""), ""Un bel di vedremo"" (""Madama Butterfly""), ""O mio bambino caro"" (""Gianni Schicchi""), and Verdi, ""Libiamo ne lieti calici"" (""La Traviata"").

1834100,4,B00008BCVW,"It is easy to compare this movie to Istvan Szabo's ""Being Julia"" since both open in Chicago within a month. Both movies are about fading stars, only in this movie's case it is based on an actual person, and tell the story of their comeback. If that is not enough for you both star Jeremy Irons has the man that stands behind them. But the comparison must stop there. I will not make comments on which movie I liked more.

 ""Callas Forever"" is a movie about that great ""what if"". Directed by Franco Zeffirelli, a long time friend of Maria Callas, the movie, we sense, mixes fact and fiction. Yes Callas was a real person, yes Zeffirelli knew her and had directed her in a TV special ""Maria Callas at Convent Garden (1964)"", and yes has been forgotten by a great many people but the we will never know if Zeffirelli had plans to direct Callas in a movie. We suspect he might have and maybe the conversations in this movie actually happened.

 Irons plays Larry Kelly, a current rock producer, who is a friend of Callas, how much of this character is based on Zeffirelli we wonder, and decides that it is high time the fading and forgotten star make a comeback. The public, particulary the younger generation does not know who she is. They have yet to discover the magic of her voice. But Callas (Fanny Ardent) no longer has the voice she once had. What to do? Kelly plans to film Callas but dub in her old recordings. Now the world will remember her the way she should be remembered.

 There is also a subplot going on with the Kelly character involving a romance he has with a much younger man a painter Michael (Jay Rodan) who just happens to be a Callas fan.

 It should be pointed out one doesn't have to be a Maria Callas fan to appreciate this movie. I must admit I never heard Callas sing before this movie (the music in this movie is the real Callas singing not Ardent). I had of course heard of her. I saw her in Pier Paolo Passolini's ""Medea"". Though I wonder if I had more knowledge of her would that have changed my opinion of the movie?

 The movie has a beautiful look. The scenes in which we see the movie within the movie, an adaptation of ""Carmen"", has the look of a Goya painting. It is some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen.

 But I must point out one of the film's flaws. Here we have a movie called ""Callas Forever"" about the life of the singer and yet the movie gets bogged down with scenes involving Larry Kelly and his boyfriend. It slows the movie down. It has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Or perhaps I just missed the connection. Is the movie trying to show us the way he uses people? But surely if that was the intention they could have shown that in his relationship with Callas. But I don't even think that any explanation for this character was needed.

 In the end though ""Callas Forever"" is a film I recommend strickly for art house movie fans, Maria Callas fans and/or opera fans. I think only a small audience we give this movie a chance. ""Callas Forever"" is a celebration not so much of a woman, but of a voice. It is a loving tribute made by a person who clearly had the best intentions in the world.

 Bottom-line: Entertaining, visually stunning film that has a knockout performance from Fanny Ardent. It is really a loving tribute to a voice that pleased so many people.",1120521600,7,3341,4.355877616747182
1834101,3,B00008BCVW,"Gallic actress Fanny Ardant is an inspired choice to play Maria Callas, and with her uncanny physical and likely temperamental resemblance, she plays the legendary soprano with real brio and scenery-chewing style. I would not have expected anything less in such a fanciful telling of a what-if scenario that sprouted out of director Franco Zeffirelli's fertile imagination. Zeffirelli is no stranger to the extravagant and visually resplendent as he helmed the Burtons-at-play 1967 ""The Taming of the Shrew"" and the much-beloved, age-appropriate 1968 version of ""Romeo and Juliet"". His long-time professional relationship with Callas provides the basis for this fantasy where in 1977, she is drawn out of self-imposed exile and into the limelight one last time by a fictitious concert promoter, Larry Kelly, who had long ago decided to forego opera for the more lucrative world of punk rock. Sporting a silly ponytail, Jeremy Irons portrays Kelly as a predictably irascible character who mercurially worships and degrades her as the circumstance dictates, a variation on the character he would play in ""Being Julia"". This time, his character is gay, of course, probably to avoid any element of romance that would detract from Callas' obsession with preserving her legacy.

Kelly's idea is to film her while acting out famous operatic roles on a sound stage and lip-synching the words, whereupon sound engineers would graft her recordings of some 22 years earlier onto the sound track. The series is to be called ""Callas Forever"" and starts with Bizet's ""Carmen"". After a rapid series of contrived scenes that resuscitate Callas from her Paris apartment seclusion back to international press attention, the film finally catches fire with the scenes that create the opera production itself. This is where Zeffirelli really shines as he makes Ardant look and act strikingly like Callas at her most passionate and charismatic. She is, of course, adored by her colleagues (in particular, an admiring young tenor playing Don Jose, as embodied by Gabriel Garko) and seems on the brink of a renaissance. Alas, it is the completion of this production that inspires Zeffirelli, along with co-writer Martin Sherman, to take the plot to the height of soap opera banality. Basking in her newly reborn confidence, Callas wants to take on Puccini's ""Tosca"" with her real voice, an idea supported blindly by Kelly but rejected by her backers. Instead of being crushed, she seems resigned to her legacy and insists that her ""Carmen"" be destroyed as she deems it a fraud.

That she comes to this realization after the fact is one of the central conceits of the film since it implies she has been cavalier about the efforts around her who did believe in her, but I suppose that is what diva behavior is all about. After all, at the beginning, Callas is portrayed as a pill-popper who feels sorry for herself as a has-been, her voice shot during an infamous tour in Japan, and as the rejected paramour of Aristotle Onassis, who cast her aside to marry Jackie Kennedy. Throughout the movie, she is haunted by her former voice with ghostly visions of her stage triumphs. These kinds of excesses seem appropriate to this kind of tribute film, but it all feels so predictably over-the-top. Sadly, Joan Plowright stereotypically plays a music journalist as a wisecracking, truth-bearing confidante that Thelma Ritter would have played with greater aplomb in the fifties. There is a persistent clunkiness to Zeffirelli and Sherman's screenplay and an overall lack of subtlety that can only be blamed on Zeffirelli's heavily ornate, Baroque filmmaking style. The DVD is short on extras as there is no audio commentary track, but it does include a brief making-of featurette, additional interview excerpts with Zeffirelli and the principal players and several trailers including the one for the movie.",1120348800,4,3873,5.146031746031746
1834102,5,B00008BCVW,"CALLAS FOREVER is a beautifully written, tenderly directed and acted tribute to the immortal Maria Callas by a man who knew her as well as anyone - Franco Zeffirelli.  The fantasy of placing Callas on film for posterity in the last year of her life, the year she died of heart failure, when her voice was gone but her artistry remained is the means by which Zeffirelli memorializes the Diva and in every way he succeeds.

The year is 1977 and Maria Callas (Fanny Ardant) is in seclusion in her Paris apartment, grieving over 1) her beloved Aristotle Onassis who left her for Jacqueline Kennedy and then died and 2) her disastrous farewell concert in Japan which ended her magnificent career with a flop.  No longer able to sing she lives in the past, listing to her old recordings and taking pills.  Only her constant maid Bruna (Anna Lelio) is allowed to comfort her with occasional visits from her warm-hearted publicist Sarah Keller (Joan Plowright).

In Paris for the promotion of a punk group Bad Dreams is Larry Kelley (Jeremy Irons) who has just met and bedded a young artist Michael (Jay Rodan): Kelley had been Callas' agent in her heyday and Michael has been creating paintings inspired by her recordings.  Seeing Michael's obsession over Callas whom he has never seen perform forces Kelley to visit Callas, their devotion to each other is 'rekindled' and Kelley proposes a film version of Callas not only to bring her out of her depression but to capitalize on the fact that present and future generations should have a filmed account of the penultimate opera singer of the 20th century.

Callas is recalcitrant at first, not wanting to produce a fraudulent film made using her old recordings dubbed onto the sound track of a current staging, but she finally resolves her hesitancy by granting the filming of 'Carmen', a role she recorded but never played on the stage.  Thus the project is launched and Callas is revitalized and happy again, being satisfied with the miracle of technology that allows her to invest her energies in the acting of Carmen while consenting to lip-synch to her old recordings.  She even has a say in the casting of the other roles, especially Don Jose - Marco (a very hunky Gabriel Garko, a former model and Mr. Italy!).  She retains her temper tantrums and demands for perfection that hallmarked her real career, doing her own dancing, having a say about costumes, etc.

The film is eventually finished and the result is magnificent.  There is even some intrigue when Marco shows more than a little interest in her (a hint of the Strauss Marshallin/Octavian encounter).  But alas at the end of the film Callas is forced to admit that her youth cannot be regained and decides the film is a 'fraudulent work' is not compatible with her life's devotion to truth in music. She asks Kelley to destroy it.  How these two come to grips with their individual lives (Kelley's Michael has left him and he is once again as alone as Callas) is finessed by one of the most tender endings on film.

Fanny Ardant is a miracle as Callas: she inhabits her physically, understands Callas' facial features as she lip-synchs her operas, and seems to be a reincarnation of the Diva.  Jeremy Irons gives one of the finest performances of his rich career as the aging gay agent and Joan Plowright adds just the right amount of lightness and grace as Sarah Keller - wise, acerbic, yet supportive of both Callas and Kelley.  The scenes of Paris are correctly nostalgic: the sets for 'Carmen' by Carlo Centolavigna  create a gold standard for all future true productions of 'Carmen'.  The supporting cast is uniformly excellent.

Zeffirelli  has succeeded in giving us a memorial to Maria Callas and for that the opera world will be forever grateful.  The passages of the many arias used in this film are among the finest versions Callas recorded.  Everything about this work is brilliant and it deserves the widest audience possible.

1834103,5,B00008BCVW,"""Callas Forever"" is Franco Zeffirelli's cinematic tribute to his long-time friend and business associate, Maria Callas (also known as ""LaDivina"" [""The Divine One"" or ""The God""] by Italians, myself included.

This is a ""what if"" movie and Callas is portrayed by the terrific French actress Fanny Ardant who lip-synchs LaDivina's singing voice at the peak of its intense grandeur.

""Callas Forever"" takes place in 1977 (LaDivina died that September, at 53 in her Paris apartment of heart failure), and by then her voice was ""a shell of what it had once been."" The fictional Larry Kelly (Jeremy Irons) argues that by lip-synching to her old recordings for a film, she will recapture the glory days leave a priceless legacy of a complete dramatic performance.

Callas only starred in one movie in her life, the lead in a non-singing role in Pasolini's ""Medea."" She is also captured on film in the PRICELESS Act II of ""Tosca"" on the DVD ""Maria Callas at Covent Garden 1962 and 1964.""

Zeffirelli does a spectacular job creating the fictional opera ""Carmen"" for cinematic purposes. In the end, perfectionist Callas asks that he destroy it because lip-synching, ""...is not honest.""

While portraying Callas, Ardant displays an amazing command of LaDivina's body language: the way her lips would curl, her intense glare, and her expressions.

Gabriel Garko is Marco, the handsome young tenor who plays Don Jos in ""Carmen."" The music of Puccini, played throughout the film, along with Bizet's score for ""Carmen"" is incredible.

In one of the most intense scenes, the  ""Sunset Boulevard"" moment, Larry Kelly is ushered unannounced into Callas' Paris apartment by her housekeeper, Bruna. He observes the life-long insomniac Callas drinking wine with sleeping pills as she is singing along, devastated, to her old recording of ""Madame Butterfly.""

Thanks to Ardant, ""Callas Forever"" is a dramatic and compelling movie. I do not believe there is another artist out there who could ever play Maria Callas as brilliantly as she.

I am sincerely thankful to Franco Zeffirelli for introducing a new generation to the immortal Callas. I adore Callas and loved this movie. There are only two types of opera: before Callas and after Callas. Long live ""LaDivina."" ""Callas Forever"" is a perfect title as well!",1118188800,3,2287,5.107238605898123

The story is fantasy.  We don't know how much of it actually happened.  The story is not compelling and an extraneous affair between one of Callas' business acquaintances and his young male companion add nothing to the story of Callas.  Rent it if you want to hear Callas.  Better yet, buy a CD of hers, that way you won't have the music interrupted by junk.",1116028800,,566,4.375
