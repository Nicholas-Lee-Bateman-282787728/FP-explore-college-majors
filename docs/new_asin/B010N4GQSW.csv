8722761,5,B010N4GQSW,"Excellent Collection of classic singing cowboy westerns!  Love the crystal clarity of these Warner Archive releases!  Time has proven that most of these 1930's ~ 1940's action westerns (or B-Westerns) have more ""entertainment value"" than higher budgeted western dramas of the time (or A-Westerns).  Many A-Westerns today are now completely forgotten, while the B-Westerns continue to live on and play, thanks to the fun, action-adventure, music, and traditional story-telling.

Dick Foran was a husky, strong, singing cowboy . . . similar to Gene Autry, but slightly more handsome and a better actor.  As a singer, his voice was very deep and when he sang, his songs were very ""classic"" style.  Autry's music was more cowboy / hillbilly, while Foran's was more traditional baritone.  Foran was good at riding a horse and handing the fights . . . you believed he could take care of several bad guys at once!

Fans of the classic Universal Monsters movies will love seeing Glen Strange (one of the several FRANKENSTEIN monsters) in many of these films with Dick Foran.  Strange plays heavies (villains) in most, but is also Foran's friendly ""side-kick"" (good guy buddy) in others.  Glen Strange was an excellent actor . . . there was so much more to him than the role of the Universal Frankenstein Monster!

Some of the early movies in this Foran collection were obviously big budget films, because there were so many extras, wagons, stagecoaches, horses, Indians, etc. .  In some of the movies there seems to be hundreds of extras, and it's not stock footage, since Foran was running past many of them!

A great set to have!",1441411200,4,1623,4.922794117647059
8722762,5,B010N4GQSW,"What we have here is a four DVD (DVD-R) set containing all twelve of the B-series Westerns that ""the Singing Cowboy,"" Dick Foran, made between 1935 and 1937. I had seen several of these previously, broadcast maybe sixteen or seventeen years ago when TNT was airing Westerns, but I had forgotten how classic and entertaining they actually are. For Warner Brothers this was their only really venture into B-series oaters, but, nonetheless, everything about this short series redounds to the studio's favor--acting, photography, production values. Pretty constant throughout, in addition to Foran and his horse, Smoke, are Edmund Cobb, almost always playing a baddie, Glenn Strange (who would later go on to ""Gunsmoke"" fame, where he played the bar tender in Miss Kittys saloon), the omnipresent Bud Osborne, and various others that aficionados will instantly recognize.

Foran had a truly ""golden voice""; he was not a simple crooner as other contemporary cowboys were. Indeed, it times it seems as if he could have sung opera. Usually he intones two songs,  perhaps three, per film, but those never intrude on the non-stop action. And, yes, there is plenty of that galore!

Let me pick out just two of the films that have become favorites: CALIFORNIA MAIL and CHEROKEE STRIP. Both are rip-snorting, quickly-paced adventures with fabulous chase scenes and incredible gunfights, and as much derring-do as one can imagine. Particularly, in CHEROKEE STRIP there is also some delightful and insouciant humor, personified by kid-actor, Tommy Bupp.

In  B Westerns, I'm a big fan of Hopalong Cassidy, Wild Bill Elliott, Charles Starrett, and Johnny Mack Brown. Paramount lavished a lot of attention on the ""Hoppies.""  Warner did the same with Dick Foran, and given the quality of these films, I wish they the partnership had continued a little longer.

For lovers of the genre this is a recommended purchase, and a very enjoyable one! Transfers are uniformly good, in crisp black & white. Trailers for each film are also included.",1440374400,3,2021,5.1432926829268295
