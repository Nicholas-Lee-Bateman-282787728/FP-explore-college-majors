7499707,1,B017DUXFA6,"I was lead to believe that this was the 2nd movie in the series. First time I ordered it, you sent me the 2nd book, which I already have. So i figured it was easier to keep the book and order the movie again. When it got here, I found out when I put it i the DVD player, you sent me the 1st movie which I already have! I was believing I would be getting the 2nd movie which is what I want!",1483920000,,389,3.642857142857143

7499723,1,B017DUXFA6,Lame.dumb movie with bad acting. The lead actor is not hot.not sexy. Not dangerous etc. He kinda looks like a ferret. And Weasels r not sexy. The couple is just not sexy. Using Ice cubes  during sex is not edgy.not dangerous. They r ice cubes. Big deal. What a bad joke of a movie. A great movie about a relationship like this is 9and a half weeks. Now that's a hot sexy flick.not this silly one. I thot the book was bad.........!!!!,1495497600,5,433,4.280487804878049

8738794,2,B017DUXFA6,"All that grey lacks any sharp details of Grey's use of his willing adventurer; I'm not suggesting X-rated... but I did not come away with any sense of the sacrifice of body... and the constant pressure for Grey to forward his domination.

It really was the Classic Comics version of ""The Story of O,""
