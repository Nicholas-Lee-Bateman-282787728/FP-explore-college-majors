However, Encore Western Channel is presently airing season 6 as gorgeous, crisp 35mm digitally restored prints.

Universal and or Shout Factory, please consider releasing the full series in it's updated, restored form as a complete series. Though I purchased the individual seasons as they were released, I would gladly buy them again if the fresh, remastered editions were available. Incidentally, though season 6 was made after switching networks (NBC to ABC), and experiencing a drop in ratings, from #1 to #25 in the A.C Neilsen's, the stories and acting are still superb.",1476921600,,825,5.164179104477612

5451368,5,B00AML732A,"Here, again is a real winner.  We purchased the entire set and loved them all!",1407110400,,78,4.2
5451369,5,B00AML732A,"Many good and even great actors grace these western morality tales that I loved as a child and still enjoy. They are in black and white, which might seem alien to younger viewers, and there are no special effects, but the stories are usually very uplifting and the lack of visual stimulation makes these a good choice to watch when you don't feel well or just before bedtime as an antidote to all the violence in modern shows--or the news! (I'm not knocking shows with violence, just saying sometimes it's good to intersperse it with some drama that gives us hope for the world.) Also, for dog lovers, there's an episode with Eddie Albert on disk 3 (the Kurt Davos story) that features a Boston Terrier trained by one of the famous Lassie dog trainers.",1393632000,,752,4.5777777777777775
5451370,5,B00AML732A,"Wagon Train was always a favorite when I was a boy, and these DVDs help me remember and relive that past.  It is evident that much work was invested to restore these episodes so they can be enjoyed again and again.",1393632000,,214,4.219512195121951
5451371,5,B00AML732A,"We have all of Season 1 thru Season 6, and can't wait to get Season 7 and 8. Then we will have the  complete Wagon Train.
I will say, Season 6 is not as interesting or exciting as I wish, but it a clean movie for the hole family to watch.
In watching the Wagon Train crossing the USA in the 1800's, it beings me back when I was younger, sitting listening to
my Great-Grandmother telling us stories of her family traveling on a Wagon Train from North Carolina. Her parents killer by
the Indians and she was raised by another family in the Wagon Train. The stories she told us, I can see them in these stories
of The Wagon Train.",1391472000,4,627,4.139344262295082
5451372,5,B00AML732A,I really enjoy the series.  I don't care for all of the current things out there.  It is important to me to get shows that we can watch with our family and not feel embarrassed or ashamed of  the language or sexual content.  I hope to get the whole series.,1390348800,,256,4.06
5451373,4,B00AML732A,"Product arrived in excellent condition (no dents).  The TV program is one of my wife's favorites from her childhood.  So all in all, it is good for us.",1376092800,,151,4.357142857142857
5451374,5,B00AML732A,this is one of the all time great westerns of the golden age of tv. I will watch these shows till I die. They don't have shows like these any more.tv now is full of junk so keep on with the old shows .,1375401600,,201,3.590909090909091
5451375,5,B00AML732A,"i highly recommend the season six wagon train tv show,especially from amazon,disc six was defective and amazon sent  me a replacement and all i had to do was switch the bad disc out and send the replacement set back to amazon,they were great and fast,season 6 had a lot of great stories that i never saw,brings back great family memories of watching this great western with my 3 brothers and 3 sisters",1373414400,,401,4.569444444444445
5451376,5,B00AML732A,"I love wagon Train because it is more about real life,and not just about shoot them up.watching this western can stir your emotions and keep one interested in the story line plot. I rate this as one of the best western series ever. Highly recommened.",1373155200,2,250,4.5777777777777775
5451377,5,B00AML732A,I love the Wagon Train shows. When season 8 comes out I will have all of them. My husband and I watch them often. We start at season one and watch them all the way through. Thanks for having them on Amazon.,1370390400,,206,3.9285714285714284
5451378,5,B00AML732A,This is an absolute must for the classic western fan. I have purchased all the available seasons so far and have not been disappointed  with the quality of the product. It transports you back to the old west era where there was a code of conduct we don't find today. Highly entertaining.,1367884800,,287,4.519230769230769
5451379,4,B00AML732A,"Yes, It's true...Flint McCullough (Robert Horton) is gone this season. And I miss him. I also missed Ward Bond when he was gone. But, I still love the other guys. I think John McIntire has done a fabulous job as the more low-key, but in control, wagon master; and I have always loved Bill and Charlie. I was really glad to see that starting last season, Bill especially, was carrying several episodes.

And, if you are here considering season 6, I don't have to remind you that the huge guest stars, the wonderful writers, and the way the main characters interact, are all reason enough to continue(even without Flint)the view.

The DVD -They finally added the ""Play All"" feature. I gave up on that happening back by season 4. I mean, it wasn't like I actually had to get off the couch, or anything drastic like that to get to the next episode, but I do like that feature. But.. Timeless Media - why are there not any sort of captions for hearing impaired - I think most who really love this show are aging boomers, like myself. There are not even any kind of subtitles at all.

This season is still the Black and White episodes; most of them look pretty good. Sometimes, the opening scenes of the train traveling looks its age, though.

This show continues to be dramatic, at times poignant, realistic, with intelligent stories and dialogue. And not without some chuckles as well - especially from the lovable Charlie. And oh yeah - Charlie(Frank McGrath), Bill(Terry Wilson), and Duke (Scott Denny Miller), all get co-star status, with portraits in the opening title sequence - about time, huh?

What are ya waitin' fer - saddle up and Wagons Ho!
Enjoy....Laurie",1367798400,2,1664,4.665529010238908
5451380,4,B00AML732A,"I would refer this to a friend. I wish they would come out with more older shows.
The old shows are more family based. And that's what America needs.",1366156800,,149,4.172413793103448
5451381,5,B00AML732A,"One of the best westerns ever made for tv. I wished we had flat screen back then, it adds a new dimension to an already great show.",1365465600,2,131,3.888888888888889
8553835,5,B00AML732A,"Have watched all of the series and enjoyed them very much. Did not like the one year that was in color so much, but the black and white did it for us.",1530835200,,150,3.71875
8553836,5,B00AML732A,EXCELLENT  FAMILY MOVIE .......WE ALL ENJOY THESE DVD'S. PERFECT FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY !,1530576000,,88,5.285714285714286
8553837,4,B00AML732A,"Each episode runs 48 to 50 minutes in black and white. This season was broadcast 1962-63. The show needs to be cleaned up and remastered. Michael Burns, child star of the last two seasons, is introduced in the season finale. Episodes alternate with stars John McIntire, Frank McGrath, Terry Wilson, and Scott Miller as hunk Duke Shannon. Many great guest stars, some multiple times this season and others recognizable from other seasons.
