8236160,5,B000ZNQB8W,Caught a couple of the shows on TV and just had to add this to my library.  Comes with both English and French narration so if I ever want to become bilingual...,1380672000,,161,4.03125
8236161,5,B000ZNQB8W,"I applaud the narrator for admitting plate tectonics is relatively new, still in its theoretical phase as opposed to other ""scientific"" shows which indicate everything plate tectonics is fact. Our information on how the Earth works is an ongoing study, being updated every day. Wonderful photography, great interviews.",1374451200,,318,5.645833333333333
8236162,5,B000ZNQB8W,"Typical excellent Canadian production.  These days, there is more good TV coming out of Canada than anywhere else.  If you are interested in North American geology, this is the set for you as its good science and richly photographed.  It is also very useful in that one can ask for Francais or English at the beginning so I select Francais and practice my very poor French.  Such fun.",1275004800,4,384,4.602941176470588
8236163,5,B000ZNQB8W,"In this stunning Canadian Broadcasting Corporation production, narrator David Suzuki guides us through the mechanisms that built the North American continent.  A five part series that ranges from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic seaboard, you are taken through immense stretches of time.  It's not easy getting used to the numbers offered (you) here.  The action of oceanic plates pushed various major and minor continents together in forming North America - which was sitting at the Equator at the time.  The Great Lakes, known to be the product of the passage of the Laurentide Glacier twenty thousand years ago, lie on a foundation of rock over 1.2 billion years old.  More astonishing perhaps is the answer to ""Darwin's Dilemma"" - what life preceded the Cambrian ""explosion"" of 550 million years ago?  In the rocks of a minor peninsula of Newfoundland-Labrador reside the fossils of the Earth's first animals, fauna living over 600 million years in the past.

The Great Lakes offer vivid evidence of the Earth's age.  Rocks along the Niagara Escarpment show the layering that intrigued the earliest geologists.  Although those pioneers had no idea of the true age of the Earth, it was clear that the time involved was lengthy, indeed.  The passage of time comes from Georgian Bay rocks that show evidence of an immense mountain building process raising peaks over what is now Toronto.  The images of smooth, flat rocks are deceptive - nothing mountainous is indicated.  But the image is that of mountains which have worn away.  Tucked away among the Great Lakes is a waterfall higher than Niagara.  Today, instead of passing Lake Huron waters into Georgian Bay, the fall is now an underwater escarpment.  Beyond the Lakes, the Canadian Shield stretches across most of North America and has revealed rocks nearly as old as the Earth.

At the edges of that extended rock floor are the Rocky Mountains in the west and the Appalachian range bordering the Atlantic.  The scientists studying these ranges explain their origins and the processes that raised them.  In one sense, the Rockies are easier to understand, their folds and crags offering views of how mountains arise.  The geologists explain how the evidence for mountain raising is found in the rocks and where they originated.  The Rockies resulted from the Shield's movement westward where it met another plate coming east.  At the opposite side of the continent, the Appalachians' story is far more complex.  Many events accumulated evidence over time raising mountains only to have them wear away before a new building event raised new peaks.  Once it was thought the current Appalachians were raised by a single event, but one of the geologists, who has been working along that range for four decades, detected anomalies that can only be explained by the collision of two ""micro-continents that formed the Carolinas' shoreline and eastern Newfoundland.

Those Eastern Newfoundland rocks carry much information.  Rocks in Newfoundland can be matched only in Africa - at the Atlas Mountains in Morocco.  Those Newfoundland rocks hold an even more important secret, however.  For many years after the publication of Charles Darwin's ""The Origin of Species"", the form of the earliest life remained elusive.  It was clear that life must have been soft-bodied, unlikely to leave fossils like bones or teeth.  An ancient volcano, however, spewed over a shallow sea, trapping a host of bizarre creatures under a film of fine ash that hardened into rock preserving the creatures' shapes.  Canadian and Australian palaeontologists discovered those hardened forms.  They deduce from the rocky patterns that while these were once animals, they gained their sustenance from the sea's nutrients instead of each other.  ""It was an age of peace"" comments one of the scientists.

The imagery of this series is awesome, with a good mix of sweeping vistas and detail-revealing close-ups.  Some details are only shown through computer-generated graphics such as the movement of lost continents over time as if performing a lithic waltz.  The structure of tiny jewels - zircons - which contain the molecules indicating the rock's age, need the illustrator's touch, also.  Through it all, David Suzuki's measured narrative keeps you abreast of the events and their meaning.  Largely, however, he relinquishes the tale for the scientists to take up.  There are still those who still picture researchers as lab-coated individuals aloof to daily life.  These scientists dispel that image as wholly false as they climb cliffs, dig in cornfields or comment on the forces involved in making North America.  Watch this, rejoicing in what we are learning about the world beneath our feet or towering over our heads.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Ontario]",1202428800,10,4786,5.139715394566624
