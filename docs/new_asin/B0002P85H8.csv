Sorry",1173398400,3,220,3.782608695652174
8477345,3,B0002P85H8,"OK, here is my 2 cents worth as a fellow traveler and lover

of Central American culture and nature.

1)This movie is short, in fact it really is only about 24

  minutes long and not 28 as listed in the specifications.

2)The quality as far as color saturation and sharpness

  of detail is not great. Overall, the quality is reminiscent

  of the quality shot with a VHS camera.

3) Good quality video of Costa and Central America in general

 is scarce and therefore I believe that some information is

 better than no information at all. So if you plan on traveling

 there you can learn something here. It does not feel like an

 info-mercial like some others and they do try to show some

 variety.  One of the other reviewers stated that it is dated

 and I would have to agree based on what I have seen recently

 in Costa Rica and based on the same places visted as on the

 video. ** The DVD had a home-made ink-jet label on it(not that

 there is anything wrong with that).

====>>>> HIGH price for only 24 minutes...Buy Used if you can!

 Enjoy your travels and don't forget about visiting that

 beautiful neighbor of Costa Rica....Beautiful Nicaragua !!",1142985600,15,1167,4.490291262135922

8477347,3,B0002P85H8,"This DVD is short, but interesting.  Has a lot of information in its short time, though.  Not sure it is worth the money for the length.",1114387200,10,136,4.1923076923076925
