941985,5,6304969422,"This is such a funny and touching series!
Hiroshi is such an adorable nerd and his adventures with the girls he meets are amazing to view.
I hope more of this series comes onto tape I really want to see more of  it.
This anime should be in every anime otaku's collection. Extremely  funny, with charming plots and even touching moments.
NOTE: There is  brief nudity and a few adult situations but nothing too sick and  degrading.
Definately for people 15 and older",955324800,4,464,4.554216867469879
941986,5,6304969422,I enjoyed this video especially so because it represents a genre of anime poorly represented here in the UK. This comedy anime involves a nerdy scientist who builds a robotic duplicate of his classmate because of his  reluctance to ask her out personally. Great stuff!,947548800,,268,4.955555555555556

7879836,4,6304969422,"It's not by any means ""spectacular"", but worth checking out. It's very short and a lot remains unsolved.

If you're in the mood for something light-hearted and cute with little story, this is it.",1197158400,,195,4.735294117647059
7879837,5,6304969422,"This is an example from the early to mid nineties japanese animation, my favorite era.  The piece is drawn wonderfully, the japanese voice acting is right on the mark, and the story is delightfully deranged and uniquely singular.  I wish more japanese animation super-powered androids were like Marie.

My only complaint for this piece is that it never went beyond three episodes, a pity as there is certainly more material and depth that can be explored.

On this DVD my only complaint is that the trailer, viewable in the VHS edition is not present.  Although to tell you the honest truth I really just like watching the trailer for the kinetic soundtrack that it has.

This DVD edition offers marked improvement to the accuracy of the subtitles over the VHS edition, and is definitely worth your investment in both time and money, although I personally am considering ordering the VHS anyway so I can get my hands on that trailer...

On another note, the japanese in this piece is notably easy to follow for beginner students of the language, and I also reccomend it for your study benefit.",1162771200,,1093,4.781914893617022
7879838,4,6304969422,"At only three episodes, this OAV series (based on the manga ""Boku no Marii"") is sadly incomplete.  The premise is an old one with the nice nerd guy ending up with an android babe, this time one he created.  Since Hiroshi is in love with Marie-san but can't work up the courage to ask her out on a date, he builds Marie who looks exactly like Marie-san, save for her hair color.  Hiroshi explains Marie is his sister (and she helps by always addressing him as ""oniichan"" -- big brother) so the potentially sticky issue of Marie-san privacy being violated is avoided.

The first episode sets the stage, then has Marie win a bet so that Hiroshi can go on a date with Marie-san.  The second episode deals with a gangster high school girl who suddenly falls for Hiroshi.  The third and final episode deals with Marie being given dream software and experiencing dreams for the first time.  It was a really well-done episode and the dreams were actually like dreams rather than another reality.  Marie's desires and fears are explored as she dreams and it was quite enjoyable.

As I stated, the problem is that the series is incomplete.  There is no resolution to any of the threads laid out.  I would have enjoyed seeing Hiroshi deal with his love for Marie-san, while dealing with Hibiki's love AND the potential romantic love of Marie as well.  I guess I'll have to score the original Japanese manga to get the full story.

DVD-wise, again, I scold ADV for turning ""-chan"", ""-kun"", and ""-san"" into ""Mister"" or ""Miss"" in the subtitles.  *sigh*  Our honorifics aren't the same as theirs (similar, maybe) and since this IS a Japanese title which takes place in Japan, the honorifics should be left in.  Otherwise, I detected no obvious translation errors, so they do get kudos there.

Bottom line: if you enjoy the android babe hooks up with nerdy nice guy genre, you should enjoy this as well, despite it being incomplete.",1098230400,10,1916,4.654761904761905
7879839,5,6304969422,"This is simply one of the best ""shorts"" available. The art is good and the story extremely well done. Why this hasn't been put on DVD yet I have no idea. It's too bad they didn't make more then three episodes, but even incomplete, it's one of my favorite series, always in the front of my collection. You can't go wrong picking this up.",1042329600,,336,4.265625
7879840,4,6304969422,"Geeky Hiroshi Karigari has always had a crush on his schoolmate Marie for as long as he can remember. But Hiroshi and Marie couldn't be more contrary... after all, Marie is the most popular girl in school, while Hiroshi is basically a nobody. But Hiroshi is a genius, and so he decides to make his own Marie! Hiroshi succeeds, and his android Marie is just about everything the real Marie is -- sweet, pretty, talented... only the hair color is different! Hiroshi instructs android Marie to help him bag the real Marie, the problem is, android Marie's feelings and emotions are so well-developed that finds herself falling for Hiroshi...
Funny and sweet, My Dear Marie is quite the undiscovered treat. It does not enjoy the popularity and exposure of romantic comedies like ""Kimagure Orange Road"" or ""Maison Ikkoku"", but it's actually an excellent title that's also worth some recognition. A dash of sci-fi is added in the mix, making MDM more than just your regular love story. Characterization is very good despite the scanty number of episodes. The main characters flesh out very well, and their chemistry makes the whole viewing experience a lot of fun. Hiroshi is your typical nerd -- glasses, lab coat, and all. He's crazy about Marie, but he also knows that he doesn't stand a chance with her as he is. He creates android Marie, surpisingly not as a replacement for the real Marie. Android Marie is like his little sister, bodyguard, and best friend all rolled into one. Android Marie also has her own personality and feelings. She was programmed so well that she's almost human, which brings us to the main conflict -- Android Marie falling in love with Hiroshi. She wants nothing but Hiroshi's happiness, but will helping him win the real Marie give him that? Things are quite complicated for our charming female protagonist, and she is so endearing that you'll find yourself rooting for her too. The art and animation are good, but the drawing style takes some getting used to. For one thing, all the characters have very pointy chins and ears that stick out. It's not bad, just different from the usual. The ending leaves a little something to be desired though. I would have preferred to have MDM end in a more conclusive note, but as it is, we are only given clues in the form of various MDM images. Still, this doesn't change the fact that this anime is very enjoyable and entertaining. I'd recommend it any day.",1001203200,,2426,4.751184834123222
7879841,5,6304969422,"This video is a cute story (with an even cuter ending song) about an android that is created by a scientist that is tired of being alone.
You see, he is in love with a girl in a tennis club he joined.  But, he believes that this girl isn't interested in him, so he creates Marie, the android.  To make things stranger, he creates this andriod in his love's image!
My Dear Marie is a very funny story with eye-catching animation and very character-fitting voice actors.  The box says it contains just partial nudity, but, contrarily, contains more than just partial.  But don't let that get you down, it is mostly seen when our scientist is working on Marie.
It is my understanding that there is also a dubbed version called Metal Angel Marie if you don't care for subs.
As a final note, I say buy this anime.  My Dear Marie is a good laugh, albeit a short one-- I, as well, wish there were more episodes.",969667200,5,904,4.357142857142857
7879842,4,6304969422,"A cute story about relationships, friendships, and personal growth.  My Dear Marie is a light drama centering around the android-girl Marie.  Much like Data from Star Trek the Next Generation, Marie starts out as an  android, but slowly starts to develop into a real girl.
I have to agree  with the other reviews; I wish there were more of this series.
Overall,  recommended.
