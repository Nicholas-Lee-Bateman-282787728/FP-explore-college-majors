7889210,1,6305290776,"This video does not even qualify as soft porn.
Take several average women, (some with ugly tatoos), in their own out-of-date street clothes. Then parade them around gradually getting naked. Have them do this around a  stream, or a beach, or in the woods. Then have them move around awkwardly,  (definitely not dancing) to a below average soundtrack. Avoid any  close-ups! Also, do not hire professionals that maybe can dance or apply  make-up and do their own hair! Also, do not use additional lighting while  filming. Then put the words ""Naked"" and ""Nature"" in the  title. Then, you too could make a poor quality video! Actually, a couple of  the models are interesting but overall their are much better amature  efforts on the market.",950572800,17,736,4.879032258064516
