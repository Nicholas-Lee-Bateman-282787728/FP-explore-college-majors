4048025,5,B0031459E4,"I agree with other reviewers in that this movie is not very creative when it comes to plot synopsis and romance.  It's the good old ""Obstacles to Love"" plot, in which boy meets girl, boy loves girl, but has to overcome obstacles before this love can be fulfilled.  In that sense, the entire movie is extremely predictable.

But I'm okay with that.  Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani lacks some of those fancy bells and whistles, but it is good, lighthearted fun.  This movie puts me in such a good mood every time.

Ranbir Kapoor MAKES this movie and his antics are downright adorable.  His facial expressions are priceless and his buddies, the ""Happy Club"" provide excellent comedic support.  Without a doubt, I'd see this movie over and over again purely for Ranbir Kapoor.

Some of the comedy is a bit hokey/corny, but I think they're just trying to target a broad audience, mature and young.  The comedy is a bit screwball and ridiculous at times, but I thought it was hilarious and fit in with the whole lighthearted feel of the film.

I would definitely recommend this film if you've had one of those days where you just need to sit back, relax, and cheer up.",1278115200,,1158,4.572815533980583
4048026,2,B0031459E4,"Raj Kumar Santoshi( does the name sound familiar) is the same director who gave us classics like Ghayal and Damini. Moving from social themes, he attempted comedy and came up with the winning Andaz Andaz Apna. This time he returns with a madcap caper directed towards youth in the form of Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani.

Prem played by Ranbir Kapoor is a young man who is unemployed and directionless. He falls in love with Katrina Kaif and the film is a journey of this love story.
The story is the same old boy-meets-girl, girl loves another guy and ultimately the triumph of love over impossible odds in the form of parents and villains.
Many sequences in the film are unbelievable but still funny. Some are outright fantastic starting with the first sequence in the movie when you have the statue of Lord Wellington speaking, and in the ultimate scene when Ranbir and Katrina are united by a truck driving Jesus ( are you serious?)
The movie mainly appeals to the youth and Santoshi proves that he can and is willing to adapt to the changing times by serving up food which will appeal mainly to them, It is a different issue that he has to sacrifice his craft for this dish.
In my opinion, the movie belongs to Ranbir Kapoor, who reminds me of a younger Rishi Kapoor, full of effervescence and energy to burn, truly the apple does not fall far from the tree. However he can only do so much when the script is 100 years old. Katrina Kaif is bearable but looks older compared to Ranbir.
The music is the real treat and boasts of some pretty catchy tunes. I loved the music especially Tu Jaane Na. The movie not so much, just two stars for this one. 4/18/10",1271635200,2,1655,4.462046204620462
4048027,1,B0031459E4,"This movie is an exaggerated theatrical rendering of all age old Bollywood romantic formulas: boy meets girl, both meet all sorts of hurdles, then finally get together, and live happily ever after. It's a sheer waste of money and time.",1270080000,,235,4.9
4048028,4,B0031459E4,"This is a really fun movie to watch for a nice laugh, very silly but not too over the top like some movies of this Genre. I will watch it again whenever I need some cheering up.
The packaging of the DVD was a little on the cheap side, and I had a really hard time extracting the the DVD's, they were really stuck in there. Some pliers fixed that problem.",1265500800,,354,4.0

8386514,1,B0031459E4,"I hated this film! Took it on a recent trip and watched it with my sister-her first Bollywood film. I was so embarrassed at my bad taste in movies! We did laugh in spite of ourselves, but I was seriously disappointed in how stupid it was. I had selected it because of the gorgeous music video-set in Turkey I think-with Katrina Kaif and Ranbir Kapoor. That is the only redeeming quality of the film! The rest is more like unsophisticated slapstick- not my cup of tea!",1395187200,,467,4.441860465116279

It came when expected. I am very satisfied with what was sent to me even though the dvd was floating in the case when it arrived. It plays to the full so I'm not really complaining.",1371600000,,242,4.282608695652174

8386517,2,B0031459E4,"When the movie first came out, it was heralded as Santoshi's best movie since Andaz Apna Apna.  Can't be further from the truth.  The flick is amateurishly directed and has very weak gags, nearly all of which I've seen before in other movies.  The story is stale and there's nothing novel about the treatment either.

It succeeded only because of the popularity of the lead actors and it was their first pairing together.  (Yes, such trivial reasons do help a film at the Indian box office.)

The soundtrack by Pritam though, is brilliant and features numerous great tracks.  If you want to dish out a few bucks on this film, I'd suggest buying the songs instead.",1281225600,,663,4.663793103448276
