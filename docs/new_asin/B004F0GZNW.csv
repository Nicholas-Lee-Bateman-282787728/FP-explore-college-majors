8427685,3,B004F0GZNW,If you are a beginner you may like this but I found it a bit boring. Compared to Physique 57 it was not that challenging. I do like the bands I bought to use with it and will use  with my other workouts.,1478304000,,203,3.7209302325581395
8427686,5,B004F0GZNW,"I did not buy this from Amazon, I bought it from Pure bar website along with the tubing. This is a shorter workout than some bar workouts. I like that when I'm short on time. (I work a lot.) A short workout is better than no workout. The tubing makes it tough. The tubing that goes with this workout is different than other tubing, great for standing seat and thigh work.",1441584000,2,371,4.23943661971831

8427690,5,B004F0GZNW,"I purchased Pure Barre 16th Street more out of curiosity than anything else.  I have been doing Barre/Fusion workouts for the past year or so and thought that the 35 minute Pure Barre workout would be good for days on which I couldn't commit a full hour to working out.  The Pure Barre workout is surprisingly challenging.  I began doing Pure Barre just as I also was beginning a low carbohydrate diet, so when I found the Pure Barre workout to be more of a challenge than I was used to, I attributed it to the lower energy that usually accompanies the early days of low carb eating.  I no longer think that was the case.  When I went back to doing my other Barre/Fusion workouts after doing the Pure Barre series for a couple of weeks, I found those other workouts to be easier for me than they had been before.  So despite its shorter length, I think the Pure Barre workout is challenging and worth adding to your workout rotation.",1326412800,19,933,4.395348837209302
