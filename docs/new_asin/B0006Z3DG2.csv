8043880,5,B0006Z3DG2,"I was hooked to Isaak's genius many years ago, who has created such Great music over the years. The production of this performance is top notch, as is his band the Silvertones. If you miss out on this one, blame no one but yourself. Isaak's voice is haunting, as is his melodies, and lyrics.
Way way ahead of his time, this man-and his band, just creating Great music for All of us to enjoy.

BUY IT..You won't be disappointed.",1207267200,6,427,4.405063291139241
8043881,5,B0006Z3DG2,"Well, the show starts off with a cover of John Lee Hooker's ""Baby Please Don't Go"" and ends with ""You Wreck Me"" and everything in between is amazing. Benmont Tench took a solo in ""Carol"" which was  icing on the cake. Steve Ferrone held th rhythm really well like he always does. Ron Blair's bass lines always blow me away. Scott Thurston did a beautiful job singing harmony vocals. and Mike Campbell was on as always. I am so glad i got this dvd in my collection!!",1118102400,,464,4.333333333333333
