8315308,4,B001KM7CSA,"Wyatt is a really solid rhythm player.  The flatpicking editor Don explains and works with Wyatt discussing rhythm techniques.  They talk about some basics like tuning, timing and strumming.  The main part of the DVD focuses on songs and has Wyatt backing up another musician.  Ricky Simpkins and Wyatt play Dusty Miller.  It sounds just like the unit and you can see how focused Wyatt is.  Then don and Wyatt go through different topics like cross-picking, passing chords&subs and dynamics.  They play a bunch of songs mostly fiddle and banjo tunes (even Drive.). It's neat to see how Wyatt backs up different instruments.  Kenny Smith plays lead guitar on Bill Cheatum and that's really neat.  The last part focuses on songs by Tony-new acoustic music like Waltz for Indira.  They go through the chords and Wyatt backs up the man himself.
Overall, I got some chord subs and tricks that make up the rice sound.  Wyatt is not very articulate but is honest-- he says the real key is lots of practice.  It's a well-done DVD with all the players and analysis.  They probably don't need to slow down and repeat simple things but it's a helpful DVD, and one of a kind as far as backing different instruments",1381536000,,1202,4.69377990430622
