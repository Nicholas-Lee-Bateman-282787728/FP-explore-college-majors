8177434,4,B000NDZ2CU,"Playboy: 50 Years of Playmates is one hour and twelve minutes or if you count the trailers and the Playboy's Photographers segment one hour and forty-six minutes. The main reason I bought this two DVD set is that it came with the Playmates of the Year: The 80's bonus feature. I own the VHS version went looking for a DVD version of it.
The main DVD is like a cliff note version of the history of Playboy. I own the Playboy / Playmates: Early Years, which cover the first twenty-five years and that is one hour and twenty-minutes and more informative. 50 Years of Playmates does a few quick snippets of interview with some of the modern Playmates, but none before 1999. Also I notice that some of the information on the 50 Years of Playmates looks like it was copy and pasted from Playboy / Playmates: Early Years. Yes the 50 Years does show nude Playmates throughout the history of Playboy and they do talk to some but not in great length. If they were doing a documentary DVD then they fall short. Playboy: 50 Years of Playmates gets a B-.
