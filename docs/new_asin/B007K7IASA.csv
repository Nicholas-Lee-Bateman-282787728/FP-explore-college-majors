5092705,5,B007K7IASA,"this dvd set took me back at my school days when I used to watch it on tv every week,I think as  Tarzan on tv it is very dificult that any other TV Tarzan can surpass RON ELY he is superv in style and well build for the tarzan part.
Regarding the quality of the dvd it is good taken from optimal original source considering that its 46 years old
I will love to see the whole season 2 released as well, so that i could own on dvd all the episodes that were done for the series

5092707,5,B007K7IASA,"As delighted as I am that this fine tv series is being resurrected, I find myself increasingly dismayed at the manner in which it's being brought to the marketplace.  This series deserves a proper release on DVD.  Shame or Warner for not doing it right.

Still, all in all, I love this show and would be willing to purchase without hesitation.  If I have to accept it on an inferior media, the price should reflect the disc quality. From what I have read, the quality is great on these episodes.  I want to make a clear distinction in what I mean by quality.  I simply mean the quality of a great picture and sound on the DVD-R media won't last for years and years like a regular proper dvd release.  The price should reflect that. Make a backup right away is all I can suggest.  Otherwise, in a few years, long after you would have any right to complain, you will have a disc with skips and has screen freezes.  Don't say you were not warned.  I still want it, but they will have to change the price point quite a bit first.  39.00 USD for half a season on inferior media is just robbery.

In any event, put this one on your want list.  It is a great title.  Let's hope Warner will see the error of their ways and give us a proper release.  Their reputation for fine entertainment is just too good to let this continue.",1345852800,2,1320,4.244979919678715
5092708,5,B007K7IASA,"This really takes me back!  I can remember as a kid sitting on the armrest of my grandfather's chair every Saturday afternoon at 1:00 watching Tarzan!  Oh I had quite an imagination back then, and can remember playing Tarzan for a time or two in the summer afternoons...pretending all kinds of things.  The quality is awesome; it's just as if I am still sitting with my grandfather watching these episodes all over again.  I cannot wait until season two comes out, because I will definitely be buying season two as well!",1337472000,5,520,4.681318681318682

5092711,4,B007K7IASA,"I bought Season One:Part One last week and both part one and part two were $14.99 each. Since then they have both gone up to $40.00 and $44.00. Sometimes watching the price fluxuations on Amazon is like watching stocks rise and fall. Next week they might be $50.00 each or they might go down to $12.99. I would love to know what causes the constant and super fast fluxuations. I only bought Part One because I wanted to make sure I liked the show....unfortunately I do and now I might be stuck with paying $44.00 or more for the second half of Season One....Damn that's expensive for 1/2 of one season. By the way, the quality of the DVD's is good and the show itself is great! However, I don't think anyone will be willing to purchase it at the current price.",1334793600,30,760,4.359154929577465
5092712,5,B007K7IASA,I have been waiting a lifetime to finally see some decent copies of this series. WB archives has released this set in two parts for Ron Ely fans this is great news. The first season is now available. Update: They are remastered according WB and are superior to syndication prints out there and for the first time since its telecast you can really enjoy the color photography. This was a nice surprise for me I only found out two weeks ago and they have been out for some time now. Its the biggest secret out there I want to let Ron Ely fans know. Support this sale so season two may come out too! Long live WB archives for some rare treats on dvd.,1333152000,17,647,4.225806451612903

5092714,5,B007K7IASA,"I don't know why they broke the first season up into two volumes, but I love this show and recommend you pick up both seasons - including the 2 separate volumes of season 1.

When I was a kid my friends and I used to try and do that Tarzan scream as heard at the beginning of each episode.  Even back then it was hard to do.  Oddly enough, even though the scream was used at the start of each Ron Ely episode of the tv series, the actual ""aaaaaah-aaaah-aahhh"" scream was actually done by the movie Tarzan - Johnny Weissmuller and dubbed in later on.  Weissmuller is ikely the only person on earth to this day who could do that scream as his did.  Amazing lungs and vocal capacity.  Never fails to impress me.",1423612800,3,708,4.207407407407407

5092721,1,B007K7IASA,I love the show but this is the second set of discs I bought that won't play right in my DVD player.  They skip all the time and not just one disc but all of them.  I have no problem with any other DVD's I play just the Tarzan ones.  I even purchased from a different place and the same thing.

5092729,5,B007K7IASA,"Ron Ely was the best Tarzan, both for film and TV. In some episodes he looks superstrong...the classic Tarzan. But unfortunately in some he looks either malnourished, or out of shape.  But he was a good actor who carried the role very well.  The character of Jai added to the story well, but too bad they had to keep the classic chimpanzee Chettah also.",1375920000,,353,4.5

5092731,1,B007K7IASA,"I bought the entire Season, because I knew the show and I love it. But I was extremely disappointed later on when I discovered the most of the discs in part one and part two were scratched all over. There are very few episodes that I can watch from the beginning to the end without any problem. I didn't send them back, because now they are open. I'm very frustrated. Besides this, as a Frenchman, I also had to pay very expensive custom rates, and this is the only time it has happened so far with all my Amazon orders. Too bad.",1361145600,,529,4.196078431372549
5092732,5,B007K7IASA,"I'm glad that this set has seen the light of day.  I had a previous set of the complete show run which was put together from very poor source material,  but it was still worth seeing after all those years.  My only beef with these collections, and I don't think I'm alone here, is the company's choice to use DVD-Rs instead of the industry standard silver discs.  They don't always play in every machine and are prone to damage if not cared for properly.  Some of the discs on the previous collection weren't even finalized and would not play at all.  Quality control, people...  This is a good set from top notch masters.  Why not do it the right way?  Otherwise,  two thumbs up for both sets!  and an Honorary Loin Cloth medal for Ron Ely!

Ofcourse, as a scrawny little kid, it was Ron Ely's physique that influenced me. I would ask myself: ""How can i get to look like HIM ?!"".

Well, folk's, in my late teen's i bought the dumbell's (Which i still use to this very day), and i did something about it !!!

I would grow up to be 6 foot 1, and 15 stone.
