352406,5,6301777476,"At the time of filming Botswana was only 14 years into freedom from the Crown rule. The movie used the traditional definition of the Kalahari Game Reserve: to protect the inhabitants, understood as the animals and indigenous people. Post film, diamonds were discovered. Coincidentally, a group that understands 6000 years of persecution stepped in to bring human rights to Botswana. The bushmen we saw in the film needed education and access to health services, so they were moved off the Reserve onto reservations close to urban areas. Also, bushmen don't understand kill quotas like safari big game hunters, so Hollywood environmentalists made sure no ""poachers"" would re-enter the Reserve. Just as predicted in the film, the bushmen are now a dead people with rampant alcoholism, prostitution, and aids. The plan is perfect. Nobody questions Kalahari Diamonds that come from a low corruption region of Africa. And three Conservation dot org directors are oblivious to their actions, or are these two Israelis and a Walmart Walton? Film is a historical document. I loved it and glad it brought me to know many things about southern Africa, past and present.",1521936000,,1159,5.170212765957447

At first, I thought I was in the wrong film. It initially presents as a Documentary. As you watch, it becomes touching and hysterically funny. Some slapstick types of laughs. This movie is clean, old fashioned fun. The Bushman is very endearing.

352554,5,6301777476,"The first of a type of movie is usually the most impressive and this film is most impressive. It is written in a narrative style; the narrator describes three intertwined themes.

A coke bottle falls from the sky. It proves to be such a useful took from the gods that it causes coveting among a Kung San tribe and therefore the gift must be returned. On the journey we cross others pressing their journeys. We follow a keystone cop type good people chasing clumsy revolutionaries. And a tongue tied (along with everything else) scientist who is enamored of a new teacher (Sandra Prinsloo.) Keep an eye on her daisies.

Will the return be accomplished? And what trials lay in store on the journey?

In any event you will never look at a coke bottle the same way.",1503100800,,761,4.54014598540146

The narration is spot on, and the dry way in which it's narrated only adds to the movie.

It's funny, it's sarcastic, it challenges the social mores of the time, it makes you laugh unexpectedly - what more could you want? One of my all time favorite movies!",1500076800,2,490,4.433333333333334

352633,5,6301777476,"Super great movie, all time classic - the five stars are because I grew up with this movie and love it dearly. Nota Bene: I recently read the backstory of the exploitation of the bushman star and got really upset. As complex and terrible as this decade can be, I hope we've at least moved past the time when we pay the bushman star pennies on the dollar compared with earnings of other actors. I would love this movie so much more if someone's trust or some income stream were somehow diverted to hunting ground preservation or something like that. So it's a conflicted five stars.",1491177600,,581,4.490566037735849
352634,1,6301777476,"I remember enjoying this movie as child, so I rented it recently from amazon for my kids to enjoy and I am so sorry I did! A lot of violence that is made to seem slap stick (think benny hill Brittish humor) as well as lots of African racial stereotypes. What wasn't boring was distasteful or offensive. Huge disappointment. It's not the worst movie but I hope that more people realize how culturally insufficient it is now that we are more aware and appreciative of diversity. A lot of serious issues here were portrayed as silly jokes, it was horrible choice for our family movie.",1490400000,,581,4.542857142857143
352635,5,6301777476,"A wonderful film from 1984. It was a low budget film which was an instant hit all around the world. The story is about a little Bushman on the Kalahari Desert finds an empty Coca Cola bottle; as they are isolated from the rest of the world; he does not know ""what the gods have sent him"". This causes havoc in his small family tribe as everyone wants to now use this ""wonderful thing from the gods"". From using it to crush seeds, using it as a rolling pin for bread, etc.; but it causes arguments and fights which this group has never had before. He must take it back to the gods. As throwing it up into the air doesn't work; he must take it to the ""end of the world"" to throw it away. And so he gets involved in several situations which is funny! The story also tells of the very humorous adventures with a local biologist who is instantly attracted to the new school teacher who is there to teach the local children. In his work he is very good; but when with the nice young lady, he is all thumbs! This film has some violence; a caution for sensitive people.",1490227200,2,1061,4.180487804878049

352679,5,6301777476,"They really don't make them like this anymore.  Comedies seem to have gotten crasser and more reliant on stupid sex jokes and crudeness, and while some might consider slapstick the lowest form of humor, I would take an enthusiastic physical comedy any day over today's ""comedies"" that derive most of their humor from insults, innuendo, and toilet jokes.  And while the look of ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" hasn't aged too well and has a definite low-budget look, it's not only a hilarious slapstick and social-oriented comedy, but it has something very valuable to say about the world we live in, especially the head-on collision of ""modern"" Africa with its traditional tribes.

""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" follows a Bushman named Xi, who lives contentedly with his tribesmen in one of the most hostile regions of the Kalahari Desert.  The peace of his tribe is shattered when a mysterious object (a Coca-Cola bottle) falls from the sky -- an object that's incredibly useful but causes strife and pain among a community that has never known such concepts as jealousy and hate before.  Xi, knowing that there can't be peace until the bottle is gone, sets off on a quest to throw it off the edge of the world.  And so begins a surprisingly epic journey across the savanna, one that will bring a cast of colorful characters to cross paths -- a spirited but naive schoolteacher in a remote village, a klutzy biologist and his foul-mouthed assistant, and a ruthless terrorist and his band of inept followers.  And along the way, Xi learns much about the ways of the outside world... and teaches a few things to the viewer as well.

The look of this film is quite low-budget, even for an '80s comedy.  There are times when the soundtrack doesn't sync up to the characters' lip movements (especially Miss Thompson the teacher, whose voice was dubbed over due to her accent), obvious fake blood during action scenes, and some clumsy editing.  But somehow this adds to the film's charm rather than detracting from it, and gives it a sort of honesty that modern, overly CGI-ed films don't have.

As stated before, this film relies mostly on slapstick for its humor, which might not suit everyone's tastes.  But the film maintains a light tone throughout, with even action sequences having moments of hilarity (watch for the two card-playing rebel soldiers, and the secretary during the first shootout).  And the film also derives laughs from its social commentary, especially during the opening sequence where it compares modern ""civilized"" man to the Bushmen, and asks the viewer to determine whether our lives of convenience and labor-saving devices have really made us any happier, or made our lives any easier.

A classic comedy, and a welcome breath of fresh air in comparison to today's ""comedy"" films.  Feel free to skip the sequels, however -- ""The Gods Must Be Crazy II"" isn't terrible but is pretty repetitive of the first film, and the rest... the less said, the better.",1488412800,,2964,4.841584158415841

To be fair the portrayal of the San tribe is somewhat accurate, they are still to this day isolated from ""civilization"", the rest of the movie however, was tinged with European/British colonial stereotypes of African people..... backward, simple and buffoon-like. In 1984, you would have been hard pressed to find a loin cloth wearing, bike riding goat herder, or cloth wearing school kids...school uniforms were and still are mandatory.

As for putting people down???  All it showed to me was exactly what I've known all along. People who are trapped in the chaotic world of modern culture are merely enslaved rats in a rat race. Those who are wise enough to focus on what is real are the happiest. As for color, money, clothing, area... who cares? Truth is truth. The city people were the nutty ones, the villagers were the wise ones, and the main character was the hero. All the characters were great - I don't care what shade of melanin. I think it's pretty racist just to even bring melanin up in the first place. We're all people. The HUMAN race.

I'm glad horses aren't like a lot of people these days. Can you imagine them all screaming about what color each of them is? They are horses, that's all. We are people. That's all.

The image of the African ""natives"" was appalling. How did we not see this then?

The only thing I would say is that the soundtrack seems slightly off from the action.  What I loved about it is how the director/cinematographer speeded up the funny bits to give it a ""Keystone Cops"" feel, adding to the humor.  There are three plots woven together:  an African Bushman tries to return an object he thinks is was a mistaken gift that the Gods gave his tribe because of all the problems it creates; a love story between a female Afrikaaner who decides to reject the modern world and become a teacher for the remote African tribes and a wildlife researcher living in the wild;  a nearby country's army ""invading"" to catch some rebels who tried to stage a coup.

354022,4,6301777476,"This South African film was an unexpected worldwide hit in the early 1980s. It has a great opening 30 minutes, as it tells the story of the peaceful Bushmen, living happily as hunter gatherers in the Kalahari desert and oblivious to the modern world (even though the great modern cities of South Africa are located just a few hundred miles south of where they live). One day, a white pilot flying in a small airplane throws an empty Coke bottle into the desert. The Bushmen find it, and believing it to be a gift from the Gods, create many ingenious uses for it. However, since there is only one of it and is coveted by all the tribe, it creates all sort of bad feelings, like greed and jealousy. As the narrator implies, the Coke bottle has been an instrument through which the peaceful Bushmen has been contaminated by the modern world. So the elders of the tribe decide they should banish the bottle, and ask one of their hunters to go to the end of the world and throw it away. His trek begins, in which he will meet with many other, supposedly more civilized beings, including a white scientist, a female white journalist and some nasty African rebels. This part of the movie is not so great. Its heavy on slapstick, but is not really funny. Interestingly, this film was even accused of racism at the time for the way it portrayed the brutal African rebels (South Africa was then under apartheid and this was one of the rare films from that country released internationally)",1434067200,,1479,4.543071161048689

THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY: It starts like a godzillion National Geographic documentaries--and carries on its anthropological tone and terminology even as it begins deconstructing the life of the working class in the Big City. But it soon becomes the sort of documentary Mack Sennett might make for The Discovery Channel. It's filled with slapstick comedy, speeded up photography, and charming, sympathetic characters; even the terrorists are portrayed more as dumb bunglers than serious dangers.

The plot might be thin, but this is character-driven comedy about a gentle clash of cultures. It's a cute, wacky, funny, sweet little pixie-witted picture with a madcap romance worthy of any screwball movie as a subplot. And it's at its most insightful, sympathetic and humorous when dealing with the perceptions and interpretations of the indigenous people. Referring to the flick as racist in any sense misses the point: It isn't satirizing natives, blacks, whites or even terrorists--it's a slapstick slap in the face of civilization in general and human foibles in particular.

There's a family-group leader from the Kalahari Desert, who's trying to get rid of something that caused trouble in the group. How do you share something easily when there's only one?

Add to the situation mix a young woman who, frustrated with the rat race and her newspaper job, takes a teaching job near the Kalahari Desert.  Oh, yes, one can't forget the bad guys and their plan to stage a coup in their country.

This is an unlikely mix of story lines, yet they all fit together.  I've seen this movie numerous times, and just bought another copy of the video because the old one is worn out.  It's quite funny, and I use the power of comedy in life.

354957,5,6301777476,"""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" is a warm and unique film (that is, unless you count ""The Gods Must Be Crazy 2""!) in which the Bushmen of the Kalahari cross paths with the modern world. The result is a blend of subtle humor, as well as a commentary on culture and civilization. While the contrast between the ""perfect"" world of the Bushmen and that of ""evil"" modern culture is overdone in the movie, it does give one pause to think about some of the ways in which we've got things wrong.

But more important than the implied cultural commentary are the characters themselves. Xi, the Bushman who is the main character, comes across as an earnest, likeable, and honorable man. And the biologist Andrew Steyn is portrayed as a gentle, unassuming hero - the kind one rarely finds in Hollywood movies. It's great to have a bumbling, good-hearted, competent guy actually be a hero for a change.

Several stories intertwine throughout the movie, but at the heart is the story of Xi, whose tribe has discovered a discarded Coke bottle. The Coke bottle turns out to be the most amazing discovery of the Bushmen's lives, as well as the hardest thing they've ever felt. They use it in a variety of ways to improve their lives, but its uniqueness becomes a problem, creating envy and anger where there was none before. Seeing the evil consequence for his people, Xi nobly sets out to get rid of ""The Evil Thing"" by throwing it off the end of the world. As he seeks to dispose of ""The Evil Thing"" Xi's story crosses paths with the stories of Steyn and a reporter turned teacher named Kate Thompson, as well as a revolutionary and his band who are fleeing from the government.

The film has many highlights, in addition to the scenes with the Coke bottle, and the humor than ensues from Steyn's bumbling nature when around Kate Thompson provides a lot of the humor of the film. Because of some scenes involving people being shot by guns, as well as some of the language, I can't recommend the movie for the whole family. But it is a great family film in general: it's just not intended for young kids. The humor, the characters, and the clash of cultures all managed to hold my family's interest the whole time.",1312675200,,2191,4.541772151898734

Jaime Uys takes advantage from this simple plot to gather other ingredients in this surrealistic cocktail, and paying - a deserved tribute - to these gags from the twenties (Laurel and Hardy, Keaton, Chaplin, Marx brothers) from the well reminded series Comedy Cappers. But too there's a visible cynical gaze to Religion and collective Sociology, when this uncivilized native falls into the legal jungle and is made prisoner, ornamented of course by a friendly smile, a clever device of the Golden years of the British Comedy of the Fifties.

When a soft drink bottle is tossed out of an overflying light airplane, it lands near the Bushman tribe and causes no end of consternation, since the tribe has never seen anything like it. The Bushman's journey to ""the edge of the world"" to return the bottle to the gods, from whom he assumes it came, leads to all kinds of misadventures involving a socially awkward elephant researcher and a disaffected office worker-turned-schoolteacher.

Camera tricks, sight gags and well-timed slapstick make this movie a side-splitter. The researcher's efforts to win the affections of the school teacher are hilarious as he bumbles and stumbles through his overtures. The gentle innocence of the Bushman is captivating and charmingly funny throughout.

The movie also reflects somewhat the apartheid which existed in South Africa at the time, but at the same time it bridges that gap by depicting friendship and loyalty between the white researcher and the native man who is his assistant.

Overall, a very entertaining and humorous little movie, with nary a foul word uttered!",1275004800,,1255,5.08252427184466

Meanwhile, a new teacher, Miss Thompson, arrives in Botswana, and is picked up by a scientist, Dr. Steyn, who's both enamoured and nervous around her. And there's a crazy revolutionary running around.

All three threads come together as Xi is on his quest.

There's humor--Dr. Steyn's difficulties with the land rover they call the anti-christ had me in stitches; action--mostly with the revolutionaries and the authorities trying to catch them; and romance--a very sweet romantic triangle with Miss Thompson caught between the earnest but tongue-tied Dr. Steyn and the slick bus-driving tour guide. The Gods Must Be Crazy is also part nature documentary on the Kalahari, and part sociological study.

The clash of cultures provides most of the humor and the serious moments--not only between primitive and civilized cultures, but also between men and women. And the narration prompts you to look at things, whether it's a familiar-seeming man making a fool of himself around a beautiful woman, or a bushman not understanding what was wrong with killing and eating a sheep, from the outside, as a scientific study perhaps. Which makes some things even funnier, and others more poignant or even profound.

It remains, for me, one of the funniest, most charming and sweetly romantic movies of all time.  It takes place in and around Botswana in Southern Africa.  To an initial narrative slightly on the lines of The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Universe, which the movie resembles not one bit, otherwise, it launches off with an empty coca cola bottle being thrown out of a light plane flying over the Kalahari (which is located mainly in the central and south western part of Botswana).  This object is found by a native Bushman who has never seen a coca coal bottle - or any bottle for that matter - takes this back to his tribe where it becomes almost a totem, so useful does it turn out to be from holding liquid to pounding roots for their water.  They start to squabble over it and when someone gets struck by it the bushman who found it is sent to take away this evil thing which has brought strife to their peaceful existence and drop it off the edge of the world.  Meanwhile in the neighbouring country, the most inept coup d'etat is taking place (excruciatingly funny in places), fails, and the ringleaders escape across the border.  Meanwhile a new teacher, an escapee from the City, is coming to a village and is being met by a very shy botanist in a landrover without any brakes.... all three story lines combine cleverly and all ends happily and it concludes with one of the funniest and most romantic sequences in any movie that I have seen.

The Gods Must Be Crazy is a delightfully funny movie.  It is about an African bushman who discovers an empty Coca Cola bottle that has been thrown from an airplane and the Bushman believes that anything that comes from the sky must be from the Gods.  He has no idea what it is or what its purpose is.  He eventually starts calling it ""the evil thing"" when his family wants to use it for themselves and squabbles develop.  There are several side stories, as well.  This makes you wonder how much ""civilization ""has improved our lives.

All in all a funny movie.  Recommended for the entire Family.

We were studying the effects of the West on those from other parts of the world, and nothing says Western arrival like the triumphant descent of the infamous Coke bottle, that mysteriously drops from the sky and plagues tribal leader Xi (N!xau) and his family.  Why did this thing fall to Earth, and why does it continue to plague him, no matter what lengths he goes to get rid of it (even throw it off of the ends of the Earth, for good and all).  Add in the subplot (or counterplot), with a bumbling scientist (Marius Weyers) with an incredible fear of women, especially beautiful blondes (Sandra Prinsloo), and you've got a great slapstick comedy with a message!

I haven't had a chance to watch the sequel, but I plan to do it straight away.  This, the original, is wonderful and though, it definitely has a 1980s feel (it was filmed in 1980), it still remains very funny and clever, complete with fast-forward photography, enough silliness to sustain the attentions of the youngest viewers, and a compelling message for the rest of us, about the fate of ""modern"" civilization.

Soon, it creates fighting and rivalry among the people.  And so the leader of the group starts a journey to drop it off the end of the world.  I found this part funny and interesting.  I even laughed out loud a little bit.

From there, however, it was downhill all the way.  Two other stories were introduced.  One was about an African political war.  The other was a romance between a schoolteacher and a scientist.  These interweaving stories didn't connect until the end.  But by that time I was tired of watching.  I don't like silliness and it even got worse as the story turned slapstick.

Haphazard and sometimes dangerous in real life, this scenario becomes hilarous and outrageous in this movie.  Filmed in Africa and starring native bushmen, this movie tells the story of one bushman who encounters a Coke glass bottle for the first time in his life.  This is his very first encounter with modern society, and it proceeds to alter the social dynamics of his entire village.  So like the responsible village leader he is, he sets out to throw the object of the edge of the world.  Instead, he encounters modern society en masse: firearms, prisons, automobiles, cotton clothing, private property, judges and other objects, persona and institutions that is alien to him.  Simultaneously, a second plot threads thru the movie that shows the intricacies of the modern world.  The two plots intersect at key points and develop the characters of all involved.

The movie flows quite well, and is very impressive in that everyone speaks in their native tongue.  Listening to the Bushmen is quite entertaining in and of itself.  Overall, a great movie that is appropriate for the whole family.",1162080000,,1228,5.034653465346534
355156,5,6301777476,"This is a very entertaining movie presenting the primitive culture of the Bushman in the Kalahari dessert and contrasting it to modern civilization in much of Africa during the 1980s. It also has implications on the origination of evil and crime in society and relates it to increasing technology and inequality.

The performances are excellent and the movie moves along at good pace. Although the subject matter is quite serious it is always presented in a humorous fashion. I think everyone will find it interesting, especially the beginning that focuses on the bushman culture and the Kalahari environment. For example they describe the bushman culture as having no laws, no penalties, no punishment, and no concept of personal ownership.

The introduction of a Coca Cola bottle, which was thrown from a small plane, creates problems and social chaos in their society. It causes nothing but misery and the tribe determines that the Gods must have been crazy to give it to them. First they try to bury the bottle, but through a strange set of coincidences it is found again. Next they determine that the only way to solve the problem is to walk to the end of the world and throw the bottle off the Earth. Thus begins the adventure of one of the Bushmen into communities in Africa touched by modern society.

This is in contrast to the character Miss Kate Thompson who is fleeing a large city of the modern world and desires the peace of a less advanced society. When she arrives in a remote area she is greeted by a researcher monitoring wild game. He is the source of many amusing scenes but the source of his ineptitude is his inability to relate to women. This is in contrast to the harmonious relationships in the tribe of the Bushmen.

The catalyst bringing them all together is the chaos of surrounding political upheavals which provides the setting whereby the solution to their problems comes not from advanced civilization but from the bushman.

In the end the bushman returns to his world of peace and tranquility which might provide a metaphor for our civilization without sustainable technology and resource use.",1161388800,,2126,4.84573002754821

The erzatz anthropology of the first 15 minutes is, in fact, accurate... if the film-maker were talking about 75 years ago.

The use of Journey to Nyae Nyae as balance gives the viewer a rounded picture of both the myth and the reality of native peoples of the southern part of Africa at the end of the 20th Century.  This is a  film I use in my college sociology classes to introduce 'culture' and the universality of humankind's need for collective living, and its interdependence.

In contrast to other reviewers, I find no racism in the film.  In fact, the equality and dignity with which people of color are presented is astonishing, given that it was produced during the end of the Aparthied regieme in SA.  There are goofy blacks (Frank) and goofy whites (Andrew).  There are kindly whites and kindly blacks.  There are ignorant, ethnocentric blacks and equally ignorant and ethnocentric whites.

Nevertheless, do not let that stop you if you have had that preconception told to you, because there is still humor only now it is more wrapped around a quirky story of love and bottle disposals.

One point to make is that the bottle actually means very little, but without it the documentary style narratives would clearly make little sense.  Then again, the early 80's, when this movie was made, made little sense in general.

To return to the film though, my favorite story surrounds the awkward Englishman named Andrew Steyn, who is a self-proclaimed, and clearly demonstrated, disaster with women.  A woman named Kate Thompson, sick of the city, decides to go teach in Africa and that's how she meets Andrew and that, in my opinion and not the bottle dropping, is when the fun begins.

My only complaints would be first that the film is old and does not always transition well, particularly in relation to the filmmaking.  Also, too many have made this movie out to be just hilarious and, upon discovery, I was too already wrapped up in this notion to let go so, I have to say, the film was flawed by it's own clearly successful fans.

Ironically, the twenty-something child who made the documentary that accompanies this DVD did not get the message.  What he saw is that these people need more Coke bottles!  And he rushes in a couple of years ago bringing his contribution, a solution to all their problems.  You guessed it.  A laptop!  And the solar panels to run it (environmentally sound, you see).  And we see a family of Bushmen sitting around glum and anomic just as they do in the movie after the ""evil thing"" comes among them.  They resemble American Indians living on a reservation: totally alienated, no longer believing in their old ways and yet unwilling to accept the white man's ways.

To cap it off, we see the star of the movie, N!Xau, sitting on the ground, staring into space, smoking a cigarette and dying of tuberculosis!

And still this kid does not get it.  He prattles on, blissfully unaware of the irony of what he is saying (and doing).

The wry British humor and the fact that the characters take themselves too seriously make it even more funny.  And the Bushmen, what a hoot!  They live life so simply and unhindered by our modern day conveniences that their naivety makes them equally funny...and sweet.
While the movie is hilarious and touching, it is also a great way to see Africa's wilds.

355258,5,6301777476,"While the Kalahari Desert looks like a paradise, it's the most treacherous desert in the world, where there is no water for nine of the twelve months of the year.  Much of the first twenty or so minutes is spent documentary-style, contrasting the lifestyles between the ""pretty, dainty, small, and graceful"" Bushmen and ""civilized"" man.  They've adapted to their environment.  There's no sense of ownership--what's there to own?--and wood is the hardest thing there.  There's also no crime, punishment, violence, laws, police, judges, rules, or bosses.  It sounds like a utopia.  Compare that with ""civilized man"", who adapts his environment to suit him, builds power lines to run his labour-saving devices and didn't know where to stop.  More improvements mean more complications, which is why all of us are sentenced to twelve years at school to survive in this complex habitat.
So when a Coke bottle tossed from an airplane is found by Xi, a Bushmen, it disrupts their concept of the gods giving them good and useful things, as clearly, there wasn't enough of those given them.  Xi, played by real Bushmen (N!xau) sets out to get rid of the bottle.
In Botswana, there's biologist Andrew Steyn who's assigned to pick up Kate Thompson, a reporter who's tired of the rat race in Pretoria and decides to become a teacher in Botswana.  Comedic disaster results in two forms.  One is Steyn's becoming a complete bumbler around beautiful women, and the blonde Kate is quite a looker.  The other involves his driving a land rover, dubbed by his African friend Mpudi as the anti-christ, as there's nothing but trouble with this vehicle.  Mpudi's cursing at the rover is funny.  Needless to say, calamity results on her first day with him.
And a band of armed terrorists led by the bearded Sam Boja make their way from the republic of Burani (fictional, of course) down to Botswana.  The seriousness is lightened by two of his members, who when they aren't shooting their automatics, are busy playing cards.
Some comedic moments involve repeated lines.  Steyn's chosen one is ""Ai yai yai!"" at some predicament. However, a lot of comedy involves people out of their element, i.e. Steyn with women, Kate in the wild, and of course Xi far away from the Kalahari and his simple ways--or a real laugh, see him trying to drive the anti-christ.
I would say this is a one-of-a-kind film, but there was a sequel that followed four years later.  Jamie Uys, who produced and directed the film, has a small cameo in the beginning as the reverend who asks Steyn to go pick up Ms. Thompson.  The fastly-run film harkens to the old silent slapstick comedies.
So remember, Monday morning at 8:00 AM, when everyone has to look busy, think of the pit we dug ourselves in, and think how simple those bushmen have it, take a page from Steyn and say ""Ai yai yai!"" because the gods, i.e. us people, must be crazy.",1061596800,79,2884,4.770623742454728

355262,3,6301777476,"I think one reason ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" became such a hit at one time is because its setting and characters are quite different from any we've seen coming from Hollywood. It tells the story of a Bushman in the Kalahari who decides to rid his idyllic tribe of the one thing that causes them strife - a coke bottle tossed from a passing airplane. He sets off to throw it off the edge of the world, and instead finds himself in prison for shooting a goat. He is rescued by a bumbling naturalist and his mechanic sidekick, who then set out to save a schoolteacher and her class from a group of terrorists. The obvious message is that the ""primitive"" Bushmen are much more civilized in their own way than anyone the modern world. Some critics may complain of this idealized, paternalistic view of the Bushmen. Looking at the film now, this seems a rather strange comedy in its use of sped-up footage, silent-movie cornball music, and cheaply dubbed-over voices that barely match the lips of the speakers. A lot of the gags, like the naturalist rolling his car up and down a hill while a baboon looks on, fall pretty flat, but the movie picks up steam towards the end, and the African scenery is interesting as well.

355321,5,6301777476,"I found this movie to be a satire on our modern way of life in comparison to the life lived by the bushmen of the Kalahari.  I think the filmmaker really believes, at least to some extent, that there are definite advantages to living in a non-modern society.  It was quite intersesting how a simple coke bottle came and torchered the lives of these people on the Kalahari.  I would like to express that through all they did to the bottle it should have broken.  It did not, however, and it soon caused strife to come among them.  Interestingly enough, my initial reaction, was to write that certainly they had strife among themselves of this nature before.  A reassessment causes me to say that I don't know, I have never lived in a non materialistic society.  To me everything can go back to the theme of the unhappiness possessions bring.  The white man had a jeep, but we saw how much hassle the jeep was trying to pick up the lady.  If she just walked things would have been simpler.  Guns were available to civilization and because of that, a group was able to take a large number of childen hostage.  That could not happen in the Bushmen society.  It also seemed like everytime the white man tried to impress the woman, it was material things that he tipped over or tripped over.  Maybe without those possesions he could have been more impressive to the schoolteacher.  Who has the right to say which civilization is truly more advanced.

355322,1,6301777476,"I know a lot of people are not going to like this review but it just has to be said.  This movie's view of the Zhun/wasi people of the Kalahari Desert-also known as the !Kung San (the term ""Bushman"" so beloved of South Africans of a certain age and color is considered racist and patronizing) and of black people in general is typical of the kind of ""let's laugh at the Negroes"" kind of minstrel show that Spike Lee satirizes in Bamboozled.
The premise of this movie is that there are primitive people out there in ""Africa"" who have never seen modern society.  So we can use them as foils to poke fun at ""us"" while at the same time congratulating ourselves on our own cleverness and ability to laugh at ourselves. In making this kind of a movie this you have to have a straight guy, a nave childlike character who wanders through the movie unwittingly showing up the cruelties of the world.
The candidate for this job goes to the Zhun/wa hunter N!au, and we can kid ourselves that this is not a racist film because urban blacks are ridiculed as much (if not more so), than the few whites shown directly in the movie.  Excuse me?
The movie itself subtly recreates the notion that black people are child-like innocents or corrupt and incompetent shufflers and jivers.  In the absence of any three-dimensional Africans at the movies (how many of you have seen the work of Cheikh Omar Cissoko for example?), we are free to carry on believing that only white people have a clear vision of reality in ""Africa"" or anywhere else in the  world.
It may interest viewers to know that the Zhun/wasi recruited by the South African film company which made TGMBC were people who were forced into a South African-run government village after they were forced off their ancestral lands to make way for a game park for tourists.  As Richard Lee's wonderful film ""N!ai"" makes clear, the people living in these camps were forced to live in poverty and hunger, forbidden from hunting, they were wracked by disease, alcoholism, violence and discord and vaguley administered by SA government officials who thought of them as chlidren.  Young Zhun/wa men were actively recruited into the South African army as trackers to combat SWAPO the black liberation organization operating in this border region of the former South African Reich.
By contrast, this movie presents us with a picture of some rural, unspoiled Africa full of Candide-like innocents who are (ultimately) unable to deal with the modern world and so exist as ""pastoral savages"" of the kind so beloved by urban tourists.  Of course, it's only a movie, but remember, most of us get our impressions of other lands from movies and how many of you ""only a movie"" people have ever bothered to find out anything about the real Africa, or even the real Africans living in your own neighborhoods?",988848000,41,2828,4.7105263157894735
