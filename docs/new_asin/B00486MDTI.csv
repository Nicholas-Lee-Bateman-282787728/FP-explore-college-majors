8418552,5,B00486MDTI,"Beginning in 1990 this series saw Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister, the world was a lot different then, and the Gulf War was getting ready to
begin.

Monday, 6th August 1990, at 0945 hours is very important in England as it was when the very show of this series started and most of the English were worried about going to war.

As Henry says, ""This sort of crisis, this sort of crisis is the ultimate crisis for any descent newsreader. You, you thrower the eyebrows lightly, you drop your voice an extra semi-tone, and you say, 'Good evening, the world stands on the brink of war'. You scare the whole country s***less. That is the real news instead of poncing around behind the queen mother, smelling of bloody rhododendrons, babbling on how all the trees are her personal friends"".

Staring Robert Duncan (Gus-boss of Globelink News room),Haydn Gwynne (Alex-side-kick of George), Neil Pearson (Dave-editor), Jeff Rawle (George-chief editor), David Swift (Henry-newsreader, foul-mouth, sarcastic, bigot of the group), Stephen Tompkinson (Damien-the reporter) and Victoria Wicks (Sally-newsreader). Later they are joined by Susannah Doyle ('joyless' Joy-sarcastic secretary) and Ingrid Lacey (Helen-deputy editor).

This series is not for everyone, so if you are used to the sanitised and politically correct life, it is definitely not for you.

It may not be belly laugh comedy, but it is comedy none the less, on a different level that some people will not be able to grasp. So if you are willing to give it a go, you may like a show that is up there with British shows like: ""Benny Hill"", ""Till Death Do Us Part"", ""In Sickness and in Health"" and ""Love Thy Neighbour"".

Grab yourself a copy of the complete series 1-3 and 4-6, and enjoy a time when things were much different, and people lived a life that only the older generation can be thankful for.

I gave the series five stars as people are too serious these days, and need to be reminded to let go as life is too short.",1383436800,,1981,4.8088235294117645
