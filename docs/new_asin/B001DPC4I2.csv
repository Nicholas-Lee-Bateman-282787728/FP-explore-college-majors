3535848,5,B001DPC4I2,"This video focuses on the widely overlooked aspects of music. All music education is based upon notes. But does it end there? What about timing, groove, dynamics, tone, listening, and all the other aspects that define the difference between an average player and a great player?

Those aspects aren't taught anywhere. Actually, Victor doesn't really ""teach"" those aspects either. But he successfully demonstrates them and widens your point of view about being a musician. This video would widen your horizon and make you find out what to focus on for the following years of musical growth - and what you shouldn't overrate meanwhile. For example; he plays a solo in Gm with all the notes NOT included within the Gm scale, being careful about the aspects mentioned. Then, he plays a solo in Gm with all the notes included within the Gm, intentionally ignoring the aspects mentioned. And guess what? The first one sounds better.

His insight about evaluating music as a language and the necessity of having people approach to learning music like learning a language was also very good. Like; did we start learning our language by memorizing the rules first? Probably not. So why learn music by memorizing rules first?

I highly recommend this DVD to any musician at any level.",1266364800,3,1274,4.94392523364486

3535850,5,B001DPC4I2,"This is an excellent instructional DVD for musicians of all kinds. Here is an opportunity to sit in on a 5 hour master class with one of the best working and recording musicians playing today. Expertly filmed are Wooten and bandmate Anthony Wellington with a class of six topnotch bass players playing mostly jazz and blues. But this is for musicians of ALL kinds and stripes: his presentation is about playing and communicating in the realm of music. The DVD is structured around what Wooten and his class identify as the 10 most important elements of music, the last and most important one being listening. Interspersed are several exercises (and some awesome playing!) that a musician of any genre can use. My personal music ambitions are to play old time Appalachian, country and some bluegrass, and I have a bookshelf of instructional DVDs in my genre, but they are all about playing the notes. Wooten's ""Groove Workshop"" is about playing music, whatever your style. I found plenty to grab and run with. This first was to learn how not to be afraid of playing a ""wrong note.""",1260662400,,1080,4.780748663101604

Victor Wooten answers the question, ""Why do we feel compelled to pick up an instrument and play in the first place?"" It's to communicate, and Victor Wooten's class teaches you that learning notes is less than 10 percent of the language (of music). His mind-boggling discourse turns the learning of music upside down, then hands it back to you on a silver platter, freeing you to express yourself.

An amazing bass player, and perhaps one of the greatest music teachers of our time. He'll prove to you that there are no ""wrong"" notes in music, only 12 beautiful tones on a chromatic scale.

No matter what musical instrument you play, you'll play it better and be more satisfied after watching this absolutely brilliant discourse.",1432944000,2,863,4.824324324324325

With this video, the understanding of music that Victor shows can be internalized and incorporated into anyone's playing style.  For me, this video showed me that playing music can be extremely immersive, and that music can be a powerful tool for self expression through which I can channel a lot of energy and emotion.  The information here allows you to forget about your surroundings and LISTEN and FOCUS on MUSIC, which, for me, is the whole point.

Victor also has amazing insight on how to master different techniques and how to really understand how you're interacting with your instrument.  EXCELLENT video that teaches not only about music but also about life.  WATCH THIS",1398729600,2,801,5.068702290076335

the workshop is a live-filmed lesson to a group of students with a couple of solo performances by vic in between demonstrating some of the concepts. the density of the material is not very high but what is taught is very useful and, as claimed by the teachers in the video, often not found in other lessons elsewhere.
all in all I think it's useful and worth the investment, although the ""re-watchability"" value is not tremendously high.",1392336000,4,536,4.712765957446808

Victor's very ""natural"" way of explaining the language of music  puts a whole new perspective on how to speak it through your instrument of choice.  Though it specifically demonstrates the use of the bass guitar to do it, all musicians can benefit from this very unique and effective tutorial.  I highly recommend it for anyone that is musically ""tongue-tied"" as I was.  I am already feeling and hearing the benefits of it, and so are my band mates and audiences.

He teaches in such a way where every musician could learn a thing or two from this video. He has such a unique approach to sharing what he knows about music that he explains all of the important fundamentals in music besides the one thing that many struggling musicians try to look for to fix all their frustrations, music theory! That's right, Victor Wooten did not become a phenomenal bass player from music theory!

If you want to see an experts oppinion on how to become a successful composer/musician, need look no further, you have come to the right place because Victor Wooten shows you all the IMPORTANT things you need to know to make it in the music world!

3535912,5,B001DPC4I2,"As a saxophonist/conga player who is now learning electric bass I found this video to be an outstanding learning tool for musicians who concentrate too much on technique and not enough on feel and the groove. One old blues musician told me that evey musician should learn to play the blues to get the ""feeling"" of popular music and once you had that foundation, you would be able to play any form of music: jazz, reggae, pup, salsa, rock, R&B, whatever, with soul and technique that was tasteful. This video is definitely related to what that blues musician told me. As a saxophone/conga player some of the ""tricks"" Victor mentioned I have been doing for years, nevertheless the way he put it into words was impressive. His chapter about rhythm and tempo is very informative and again all musicians could use the exercises he has the other musicians do in this master class. Every chapter of the video had useful information for playing ""in the pocket"". For bass players I think this is a must have for your learning bass collection.

The most enlightening part for me- Victor plays a bass solo using only notes outside of the key chords he's soloing over, and it sounds amazing... because he plays it with an incredible groove. Maybe not earth shattering for some musicians but it created a new paradigm for me. Victor also has a very approachable style.",1364774400,,544,4.677083333333333

Victor is setting the rules for the new age way of approaching music for serious musicians as well as garage band wanabes. I recommend this for anyone who has gone beyond 3 chord workouts no matter what  instruments you play.  Doc Wallin.,1364083200,,427,4.379746835443038
3535924,5,B001DPC4I2,"The format of the DVD is a master class with several advanced bass students in a very interactive setting.  Victor lists 10 key elements in music and goes over each of them emphasizing that all 10 are equally important.  The 10 elements are: notes, grooving, articulation, technique, emotion/feel, dynamics, rhythm/tempo, tone,phrasing, space/rest and listening.

Vistor's idea that music is a language and should be learned the same way we learn to talk is revolutionary compared to the way I was taught by going right to the mechanics of music.  We learn to talk by listening to others who can talk and pick it up at a natural pace one step at a time.  The people we talk to encourage us and give us enthusisastic support for even the smallest progress.  We need to do this more in our music education. This DVD demonstartes this in the interaction between Victor, Anthony Wellington (fellow instructor and excellent bassist) and the students.

1. I play bass, and there are a lot of ideas and concepts in the video that can make a player better.
2. I love listening to and watching Victor play bass, and he does a fair amount of that here.",1337731200,,268,4.153846153846154

3535931,5,B001DPC4I2,"This DVD single handly taught me how to become an amazing bass players in just 2 years!!!

This is basically a dvd version of victor wooten book the music lesson..

THe DVD is over 5 hours long and is just packed with amazing wisdom about music..

Victor Wooten has defintly the right approach to music and learning focusing on ""notes"" as the last importart part of music that we all focus on..

I also highly reccomend you check out and go to victor wootens camp in TN he has several a year and is well WORTH IT",1328486400,3,512,4.247422680412371

3535933,4,B001DPC4I2,"Though this review is not a 5 star let me start off by expressing that I think Victor is a fantastic player and is very talented at what he does.  The video has some great concepts and I would recommend it just for that reason but personally I have always felt he is a master at techniques and flash which is what captures you but typically he overplays, over uses the triplet technique and plays too many wrong notes. Miles Davis has shown us, Dissonance can be very cool but it can be over used as well.  Victor does express in the video that he has a tendency to overplay and it is something he tries to stay focused on.  I'm not really crazy about any of his music, ie the Fleck Tones and his solo work but do find him a master at his techniques and interesting to watch him play on some of his grooves.  There are some great skills to learn from this video but be sure to get that The key to Flash playing is incorporating it tastefully at the right time and not over doing it.",1324944000,4,982,4.12565445026178
3535934,5,B001DPC4I2,"Victor Wooten's master groove workshop is fantastic and inspiring! His approach to music can be translated to other art forms - so, you don't have to be a bass player to be completely enthralled with this video!

Victor's right, some of us (the bass players) only confident with the root. I have more confident to play the wrong notes and make them sound right after I learn from this DVD. ""I'm grooving while finding the notes"" :) I keep watching this DVD over and over again. This DVD also is great for all musicians. God bless you all!",1317340800,,492,4.189473684210526
3535936,5,B001DPC4I2,"As many of us know, eventually we want to advance from a player to a musician. This DVD is one of the many tools that we need in our box.

That is the goal of all of us, I think.",1312934400,,353,4.2835820895522385
3535937,5,B001DPC4I2,"This is a great dvd for all Musicians, not just bassist!! Victor is a very insightful musician!! He speaks of music being a language, and how you should have something to convey when you are playing.  This DVD is most definitely put my mind and heart back into the true meaning of music, not crazy riffs and awesome fills, but the importance of the groove, and playing from the heart!! This is a must have DVD!!",1299628800,,411,4.407894736842105

3535939,5,B001DPC4I2,"When Victor Wooten started this video I thought it would be just like many other technique driven lessons. After he had each participant jam with him and then break down what each one did/thought I was enlightened to concepts I hadn't thought of, even though I have played bass professionally for 39 years. Way to go Victor, You taught this old dawg house bassist some new tricks!!",1288569600,2,381,4.701492537313433
3535940,3,B001DPC4I2,"This is not a bass tutorial for beginners, but more like...play the bass with soul, or with your heart.

Master of the universe Victor shows how to improve your technique and overall playing by playing like you mean it, like if it's the last day on earth.

He goes and play his $6000 bass to a student audience of bass players that probably were born holding not a bottle of milk but a $7000 7 string-bass.

Cons:
- Looking at the basses played makes you look like you are worthless. Your bass is worthless and you are nobody.
- Watching the ""students"" on this video, make you want to pick up a fight with one of those ivy league kids that have all the money in the world to buy a $7000 bass.
- This is not for beginners. Lord of everything that surrounds us Victor won't teach the proper way of holding your bass.
- Master of his domains Victor won't show at turtle-slow motion how he fingers his bass at the speed of light.

Pro:
- Builder of the Milky way and all the stars Victor shows how to love your bass.
- There are some good techniques but they are not explained in detailed.
- Guy really makes play with a vibe...Like forget everything you know and now play like you mean it.",1286150400,14,1186,4.234513274336283

3535943,5,B001DPC4I2,"It was neat to see another guy preaching the way I've been teaching for 35 years. You won't find any traditional lessons taught in this 5 Hour DVD, but you will hear a useful philosophy. He basically says what I do. It's all in the groove! Your theory and scales and modes are OK when taken in small chunks but that isn't where great a bassist comes from. It comes from inside you and what you feel in the music, not from a book on theory. He makes sense the whole way through and admits right off the bat he knows very little theory. It was nice to hear the truth spoken from one of the world's best bassist. This DVD, though enjoyable, is not instructional in the sense of technique and theory. Every bassist should own this DVD!",1282694400,7,731,4.266187050359712
3535944,4,B001DPC4I2,"I have debated quite a bit before buying this DVD. I was expecting five hours of Oprah and Dr. Phil style self-help one-liners. Well, there are plenty of one-liners on this DVD, but the vast majority of them actually make sense for real people. In between, the program is filled with useful and eyeopening exercises that any regular bass (or music) teacher is unlikely to assign.

The setting on this DVD is a class room with six bass-geeks, holding some very expensive Fodera and other assorted boutique basses, gawking at Victor and his assistant Anthony Wellington. The first sign that this DVD may offer something for bass playing mortals like myself is the first assignment: Victor has his disciples play something on their basses. For all the thousands of dollars that is sitting in their laps, most of them acually sound like crap! Good to know Victor isn't preaching for a selected audience of professional bassists with cum laude conservatory diplomas.

Victor then has his students make a Top Ten of the most important aspects of music, like ""Choice of notes"", ""Groove"", ""Articulation"", etc. Interestingly, the students come up with ""Listening"" as the last entry, and only after some prompting by Victor. Good point made right there.

Victor elaborates on all ten aspects, throwing in several great exercises, some of which I will definitely start using. For anyone who might think they will be watching a philosophy lecture, there are several ""How to"" segments during Q & A time at the end of the video. Funny that in the end, the bass geeks just want to know how Victor does that double thumb thing. Fortunately for them and us, Victor, being the cool guy that he is, doesn't show any disappointment that apparently technique (again) beats philosophy and is happy to oblige.

Just by watching this DVD I feel I have begun to lose my fear of wrong notes (the segment dealing with that issue is one of the best), will be improving my sense of time, will be more aware of the other players in the band, and probably will start playing more freely. This DVD is an excellent value.",1275177600,21,2088,4.775623268698061
3535945,5,B001DPC4I2,"In just my first viewing of this DVD, my whole approach to music has been altered. Victor and Anthony's breakdown of ten individual elements of music goes so far beyond the typical ""play an A7 arpeggio over a G7 chord to get all the sweet extensions"" advice you get from most music books. This clinic takes you far down the rabbit hole and WAY beyond what is ever written on a sheet of music. I hope you get this and get a lot out of it.",1273968000,,437,4.093023255813954
3535946,5,B001DPC4I2,"Wow...I was hesitant about purchasing this DVD because I figured I will never be able to play like Victor Wooten.  I am sure glad I did, and what a difference it has made in my bass playing.  Not only am I playing better but I think about music in an entirely different way!  I love his philosophy on music and the way he approaches playing an instrument.  I sincerely believe that even if you play other instruments you will walk away with a wealth of knowledge and increased creativity after checking this video out.  I highly recommend this DVD to every musician, beginner or advanced.
