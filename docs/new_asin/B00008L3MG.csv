But I bought the first DVD and was both moved and laughing out loud since I found it really did live up to the hype.
Now there's volume 2 and while there still is lots of humor we also get to see a bit more of the mystery that is Chi. And a mystery it is... Without giving a lot away what becomes apparent here is that Chi is a lot more than your average Persocom. She reacts strangely to some things. Some great power seems to watch over her and she seems to have a predetermined destiny.
Plus she seems to have a rather powerful effect on other Persocoms around her which becomes apparent in a great double episode where Chi decides to get a job in order to help Hideki with paying the rent. This offcourse goes all wrong and she gets tricked into working at a peepshow.
Things don't turn out how the owner hopes though...
This truly is an amazing show. It's sexy, funny and above all heartwarming... It's hard not to fall in love with sweet innocent Chi.",1053043200,5,1071,4.229268292682927

7985122,5,B00008L3MG,"Chobits was one of the first animes I bought. I fell in love with it. The characters are very lovable. Chobits may be one of the cutest anime series ever. Chi is adorable. The animation is very good and the music fits the mood of the story beautifully. It's fun and very sweet, but it also gets extremely emotional at times. Every CLAMP title is great and Chobits is no exception. If you like Chobits check out these other CLAMP titles: X, Tsubasa, xxxHolic, and Angelic Layer. You would really be missing out if you don't watch Chobits.",1354147200,,537,4.489795918367347

7985124,5,B00008L3MG,"In this second DVD of Chobits everybody learns something.  Chii learns about books and money, Hideki learns that Chobits need to be recharged, just like other pieces of equipment, and we learn to always wear goggles at live peepshows.  And Chii's dark side is starting to appear too!
Seriously, this is a great DVD.  While it has only a few extras and only four episodes, these are great episodes.  A serious story from CLAMP with a touch of humor, great artwork and great voices like those of Wendee Lee, Sandy Fox and Crispin Freeman, how could you go wrong?  You can't!
Buy it or rent it, but see it today!  Or whenever it gets delivered.",1079136000,2,641,4.530434782608696
7985125,5,B00008L3MG,"Now that the characters are established, it's time for story.  This set of episodes starts to establish the down-side of innocence.  Nobody really knows anything yet and so far they seem to be worried for the unusual couple.  This disk also starts to shine light of the issue of caring too much about technology.  Some character observations seven show a hint of mockery and taboo over the way Chi and Hideki react to each other.
More secrets are revealed and the plot begins to deepen.  The comedic aspect seems to fade in this portion but the story makes it all the much more worth watching.  Be prepared to have a headache thinking about the future of the series after this one.",1071964800,2,681,4.586776859504132

7985127,5,B00008L3MG,"This all important second volume of ""Chobits"" begins to introduce characters, ideas and ongoing clues that begin to give the series a momentum that will carry it to the 26th and final episode.
To recap, 18-year-old farm boy Hideki Motosuwa has moved into the big city to attend cram school to get into college. He one day finds Chi, a Persocon (human looking robots that are as popular as cell phones) who may actually be a Chobits, a legendary series of Persocons that, among other powerful and unique abilities, can exercise free will. He must teach her how to go about and survive in the real world, while juggling school, work and the quest to find out her identity.
""The Empty City"" is named after a book that catches Chi's eye at the local bookstore. Hideki sacrifices his English lessons by spending his precious, disappearing funds to buy Chi the book instead of a dictionary. She reads the fairy tale and find that the main character seems vaguely to be a Persocon who wanders alone in a city full of human couples, looking for love or companionship. Throughout the series, Chi will continue to find and buy the sequels to the book, which has a surprising author.
This volume definitely exemplifies why feminists and younger children might shy away from the series. With Hideki's meager paycheck from the restaurant not quite cutting it, Chi goes out to find a job. She is conned by a stranger into a peep show that is also broadcast online. He encourages her to strip down and do other things; he sticks his hand between her legs and pays the price--a tremendous burst of energy demolishes the peep show house and temporarily disables nearly all the Persocons in the city.
Chi continues to learn words, manners and other everyday skills, and gets a safer job at the local bakery, whose owner later plays a significant role in setting up the atmosphere of a world where Persocons are extremely popular, but also somewhat feared for their combined effect on social interaction among humans.
""Chobits"" has art on a par with any modern anime, and has some of the cleanest computer graphics integration; the music is superb, with one of the more catchy opening and ending themes. Plenty of booby-type jokes, and certain ideas and themes that may offend those with a strong feminist leaning. Recommended for all others, and those above 13.",1058659200,14,2343,4.773399014778325
7985128,5,B00008L3MG,"...All I can say is this Series is a little Adult, but Its is a great story of weirdness, comuters, nerds, and love, If It was up to me it would win an Oscar, I Read the manga first loved watch DVD 1 and 2 and loved now I just watched  DVD 3, I recomend Chobits to everyone, and if you under 16, you have to be a little mature, but hey, If you want some great anime chobits is for you",1058054400,3,384,3.682926829268293
7985129,5,B00008L3MG,"First of all, I want to say that I can't believe the things coming from the pen of this Solomon guy.  ""Enjoys being as submissive as a doormat""???  She's a computer!!  More than that, she doesn't really know anything about the real world -- she's a social idiot, to put it bluntly.  She can't help the things that people do to her -- she doesn't know it's bad.  She has the mentality of a very young child.  You can't say she ""enjoys"" being submissive - it's all she knows, and that's not her fault.  She is a very complex character, and cannot be defined in terms of actual humans with her physical characteristics, simply because she's so unique.
Now that I'm done complaining about the staff reviewer, I want to say that I absolutely LOVE the series.  Though I haven't seen the anime, I've read the manga and all my sources say that the anime is very true to the original.  The story is lighthearted and sweet, with just a touch of darkness to keep it really intriguing, especially for the ""shoujo"" crowd!  CLAMP is my favorite artist team of all time.. if you're a sucker for cute, like me, but also need a meaty story, like me, you'll check this out right away.",1056758400,6,1166,4.406542056074766
7985130,5,B00008L3MG,"This series is just so darn cute!  The 2nd volume isn't as funny, a little more serious tone, but it does have its share of laughs.
Chii has learned a lot of things from Hideki now, and when Hideki buys her her very first book (The Town With No People), she has a very strange reaction to it, which isn't explained yet, but probably in later volumes.  And when Chii suddenly starts acting wierd, like she's sick, Hidkei learns that persocoms need to be charged up!!  There goes the electric bill!!  Then Chii decides to get a job, but when Hideki finds out its at a peepshow he rushes to get her.  But she's gone, leaving a big explosion behind her, and causing other persocoms to freeze!  After he finds her, everything is all right, but what happened to her!?  Then she finds a new job working at a pastry store (in the cutest outfit!!).  I think that we are begining to see that Chii might have feelings for Hideki, after all she does have her own free will, with no programs telling her how to act and feel.  Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and find out!
I really enjoy watching this show and I can't wait for the next one!!  The animation is fluid and colorful, and the music really suits the show and situations well.  There's a lot more sensual stuff in this volume though, the peep show scene, and then a dream that Hideki has, so I'd say maybe 16-17 and up, but definetaly not any younger than that.  So, all in all, this is a great volume that I highly recommend!!",1056585600,4,1480,4.284172661870503
