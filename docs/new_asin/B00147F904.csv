I thought that maybe with the advent of DVD I would get a clearer, crisper, cleaner image... I was wrong. The transfer quality is really bad. It is unbeleavably grainy, gritty, and dark. My God is it dark!! You can,t see any night scenes and even the day scenes are poor. Don,t waste your money.",1111017600,11,401,4.36

8254589,4,B00147F904,"Prime version is short by maybe a minute (especially when the Syngenor pulls the guy down then the sewer after pushing the manhole cover off)

I just love this film. It is a fun 80s monster movie with a great creature design. William Malone's first movie and I wished he could direct more, good eye and really good at building tension. I wish Scream or Blue Underground or Synapse could release this on blu ray with a clean transfer. By all means, check this flick out if you enjoy good ol monster flicks!",1518048000,,505,4.43010752688172
8254590,4,B00147F904,"Classic 80s Monster Flick...  cheesy acting...  junky special effects...  classic early 80s style horror music / ambience...  bunch of cute college girls ( what 70s / 80s horror movie would be complete without those )...

Honestly, the guy in the rubber monster suit doesn't look half bad...

Good ole days...",1517270400,,309,5.08
8254591,4,B00147F904,"After an unholy tour of the sewer system, someone or something goes above ground, and SCARED TO DEATH (aka: SCARED TO DEATH: SYNGENOR- 1980) begins! It seems that a hideous monster is on the loose, causing murderous mayhem! Police are flummoxed, convinced that a mere maniac is behind the string of brutal killings. With each new mutilation, the cops are no closer to catching the murderer. When ex-detective, Ted Lonergan (John Stinson) gets involved, it's because the situation is truly desperate. Not even roller-skating young people can escape the horror! Ted teams up w/ new girlfriend, Jennifer Stanton (Diana Davidson) to run down clues. Jennifer encounters the creature, landing her in dire condition.  A woman named Sherry Carpenter (Toni Jannotta) comes forward w/ information, but her story is fantastic! Ted must believe her in order to track the beast. This leads Ted and his friend on the force, Lou Capell (Jonathon David Moses), to the scientific research facility where the monster originated.  Can Ted and company stop the thing, before it reaches whatever awful potentiality it's heading toward? The finale must have been seen by a young James Cameron, as it bears an unmistakable resemblance to his later, TERMINATOR finale! Right down to the method by which the creature is dispatched! Well worth a viewing or ten, as it is perfectly glorious, 80's cheeeze!...",1513641600,2,1381,5.160714285714286
8254592,4,B00147F904,I remember reading about this movie in Fangoria magazine back in the day. The monster was an absolute Alien ripoff and the movie your basic 80s monster on the loose. It has a certain charm though that transcends it's short comings of plot and acting.,1512777600,,250,4.5777777777777775
8254593,5,B00147F904,"Fun movie with a good looking H.R.Giger ""inspired"" design. If you like cool rubber monsters, & hot girls that are made up ""nerdy"" as scientists.....( I know I do ).than this is your film.",1353715200,,187,4.529411764705882
8254594,1,B00147F904,"I recently ordered a Retromedia title from Amazon.com called ""Scared To Death"" and was greatly disappointed.
  There are a number of movie companies that do not understand the purpose of widescreen. The purpose of widescreen is to show MORE of the movie as it was originally presented in it's correct aspect ratio - as opposed to fullscreen which cuts off the sides of the picture to make it fit a fullscreen TV set. Unfortunately, I've come across too many distributers, such as Retromedia, that get a print of the film, format it to fullscreen for reasons unknown, then put black bars across the top and bottom to make it LOOK LIKE widescreen. WHY? Not only are the sides cut off the film for fullscreen, but also the top and bottom are cut off for false widescreen. WHY? Movies like this one are ruined, and are preserved in their ruined state probably forever on a DVD. WHY? Plus, I have just wasted my money because you have fooled me. It's such a sad shame on many levels.
 I can't imagine what the faulty reasoning behind such tactics could be. It just doesn't make any logical sense.
 WHY?",1312934400,2,1097,4.581632653061225
8254595,2,B00147F904,"The title Scared To Death sounds more like a psychological thriller kind of deal, but make no mistake about it, this is a monster movie.  And given the cool monster, it could have been a rather fun monster movie, but it's extraordinarily dull.  I remember looking at the VHS box for this film as a kid.  I was intrigued by the metallic, clawed, nasty looking beastie on the cover, but for some reason I always passed it by.  Well, watching it recently, the film decided to punish my ass for all those years of neglect.
A wiseguy detective turned writer gets caught up in an investigation of mysterious deaths and disappearances.  Turns out it's a monster living in the sewer!  A Syngenor to be exact.  In a tossed in back story we find out that a scientist was hellbent on creating a new life form, thus the Syngenor was created.  It's a large, ""Alien"" looking beast that feeds on spinal fluid and emits cold air.  Why a scientist would want to create such a dangerous thing is beyond me. But I guess if you're going to create a new life form for the sake of doing it, you might as well put some flair into it.
The monster is seen in bits throughout the film, and we don't get a good look at it(and only too briefly) until the end of the film.  Normally this technique works well for me, but considering how boring the film was, I'd really have liked to see more of it considering it looks so cool.  Also, the kills in this film are very weak.  The Syngenor looks like it should be ripping people to pieces, but it slowly shuffles about and kills folks in an extremely unterrifying, bloodless manner.  I certainly don't require gore galore, but at least make it interesting for crying out loud!  Doesn't quite live up to the Scared To Death title, ya know?  A wasted opportunity for a neat monster.
The film was directed by William Malone, who has blessed us with the crapfests, Feardotcom and the House On Haunted Hill remake.  Taking that into consideration, I'm not terribly shocked that I didn't like this film.  And that's too bad coz horror films from this time period are my bread and butter usually.  I should have just left myself be content with that cool image on the VHS coverbox.",1244332800,2,2192,4.451127819548872
8254596,3,B00147F904,"...Scared to Death. Yes many people today do not know that the better known monster romp Syngenor (out now by Synapse films) is actually a sequel to this film made 9 years before in 1981.

The plot is simple. Scared to Death has a Syngenor creature on the loose in a city killing people. It's low budget yet entertaining in a B-movie way. Director William Malone (House on Haunted Hill, Feardotcom) does what he can with the story and his creature design (as he is also a gifted artist) is phenomenal for the budget. If enjoy watching obscure, B-movie romps from the 70's and 80's then you should find enjoyment in this.

Other than the awful new cover-art which makes looks like a modern direct-to-video/made-for-Sci Fi Channel drek (The world Syngenor was added to the cover to make a connection to it's sequel) , this DVD is tops. A nice 16x9 widescreen transfer and an interview with director William Malone.",1241568000,6,912,4.69375
8254597,3,B00147F904,"The debut feature for William Malone (the House on Haunted Hill, Parasomnia)is a moderately entertaining monster movie with one Hell of a creature. The syngenor is a memorable creation and it's about the only thing that stands out in a fairly slow paced horror movie.

Harkening back to the regional horror movies of the 60s and 70s, SCARED TO DEATH has a simple plot that is constantly interrupted by random fits of day players getting mauled by our resident toothy critter (Syngenor is definately in need of some upper dental work). The most ridiculous vignette here is a group of kids rollerskating in an abandoned warehouse (!!?).

It's too bad because there's a lot to like here. Malone's direction is rough and, at times, clumsy; however, he does manage some very atmospheric moments here and there. The script is weak in the knees, though the characters bring some life to the situation and there's some unintentional hilarity to be had.

The biggest error is giving our monster next to nothing to do, so much so that the movie has to grind to a hault so that it can randomly show up and do stuff. There aren't too many monster scenes that are necessary to the plot after the first fifteen minutes or so.

Retromedia's DVD is a mixed bag; the movie's transfer is sufficient and the packaging is nice, but the only extra is a pithy interview with director Malone. This is the only DVD for the movie in Region 1 (that's legal) and it makes a fun Saturday night viewing. Check it out.",1238976000,2,1488,4.625
