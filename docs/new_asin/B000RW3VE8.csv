2875691,2,B000RW3VE8,"This movie despite a cast consisting of Forest Whitaker, Ray Liotta, Kim Basinger, Kelsey (Fraiser) Grammar, Jay Mohr and Tim Roth, starts off at a crawl and never makes it to the finish line. While it gives an amateurish attempt to connect multiple intertwining stories, the sad fact is that none of the stories are interesting enough, nor defined enough, to make it worth the viewers time, to buy into any emotional involvement. The acting is weak at best, and the fictional characters are ridiculous, especially Ray Liotta's meek, spineless, ""house-husband"", who has to be the dumbest person on earth, constantly believing that his wife, Kim Basinger, was always at the coffee shop throughout the day and  till all hours of the night. Their 13 year old daughter's makeup and clothes made her look like a hooker and neither parent ever said a word. But since Kim's hair looked like road kill and she wore glasses that bring to mind a wacky science teacher from 1954, she probably had no right to say anything since she probably never even looked in the mirror. The two basketball games presented are probably the only two games in history that had only ""ONE"" missed shot. The supposed underbelly of this terrible movie was gambling addiction, and it did no justice to either the problem or the cure. I would not recommend buying or renting this. It might be worth watching for free on cable after midnight on a three day weekend.",1189900800,2,1431,4.770161290322581
2875692,1,B000RW3VE8,"I rented this movie because I do a weekly review for a local newspaper. I thought with so many different good actors in one movie, at the very least it would be a fair movie. At the least, right? I was wrong as this rehashed garbage featured a boring storyline, terrible acting, and is nothing more than a rather poor excuse at making ""an independent film"". Stay away by all means.",1189900800,7,381,4.380281690140845
2875693,4,B000RW3VE8,"EVEN MONEY has somewhat the same manner of storytelling that made CRASH so impressive: many apparently disparate characters and stories, all related by the disease of gambling addiction, work in parallel time frames to a related conclusion.  Director Mark Rydell (The Rose, On Golden Pond, Cinderella Liberty, The Reivers, The Fox, Intersections etc) has a firm hold on his material - a screenplay by newcomer Robert Tanner - and steers his large and very fine cast through a rapid sequence study of character types.  For this viewer it works well.

Carol Carver (Kim Basinger) is a blocked novelist married to Professor Tom (Ray Liotta) who happens to spend her hours away from home and her duties as a wife and mother to teenage daughter Nicole (Carson Brown) at the local casino, gambling away her family's savings on the slot machines.  She meets a down and out magician Walter (Danny DeVito) who convinces her to join him in a resurrection of his life as a famous artist.  Carol's gambling addiction fractures her life.  At the same time plumber Clyde Snow (Forest Whitaker), who worships his younger brother Godfrey Snow (Nick Cannon) for his prowess as an emerging basketball hero, and to escape his dangerous debt from gambling talks his brother into 'fixing' games to help him win back his losses and pay the collectors.  The third gambling addict is Augie (Jay Mohr) who with his companion Murph (Grant Sullivan) runs a betting numbers game, a profitable business until Murph's infatuation with his girlfriend Veronica (Carla Gugino) consumes his attention.  The tie-in factors among these people are the man behind the collections, a smarmy Victor (Tim Roth) who emerges at all the wrong times to distort their lives and hopes as looks out for his boss Ivan (Mark Rydell), and a strange crippled detective Brunner (Kelsey Grammer), and the ending of the film is tied together in a series of twists that surprise everyone.

Non-linear storytelling is not new, but in Rydell's handling of Tanner's script (and with a lot of help from some very fine actors!) it takes on a new dimension: the messages are not pretty but the souls and crushed dreams of the characters weld our attention.  It is a film well worth watching.  Grady Harp, September 07",1189728000,3,2255,4.923482849604222
2875694,4,B000RW3VE8,"Not just about gambling addiction, but the human weakness and addiction to greed.

2875695,4,B000RW3VE8,"Director Mark Rydell received his Best Director nomination for ""On Golden Pond.""  ""Even Money"" is an interesting character-based story that mixes several disparate elements unevenly.

Kim Basinger, who won an Oscar for ""L.A. Confidential"" in 1997, plays Carolyn.  Carolyn is an author who covers her gambling habit to her family by saying how she's writing her new book.  Her husband Tom is played by Ray Liotta who won an Emmy in 2005 for TV's ""E.R.""  Tom follows her, only to discover that she's drained their savings.  This is one of Liotta's best performances as a sympathetic father & husband who must draw the line.  Carolyn takes up with an aging magician, Walter, played by Danny Devito.  Walter who is also the Amazing Abraham becomes the subject of Carolyn's next book.

Oscar winner Forest Whitaker who took home gold for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-King-of-Scotland-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000NIVJF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;plays Clyde Snow whose gambling problem has made him put pressure on his younger brother Godfrey to throw a basketball game.  Godfrey is played by Nick Cannon who was in ""Drumline.""  Whitaker agonizes between his weakness & his love for his brother.  Cannon matches the performance, looking up to his older brother even as he resents his intrusion.

Meanwhile, Tim Roth who won a Best Supporting Actor nomination for ""Rob Roy"" in 1995 plays Victor, a sadistic bookie.  Roth takes great delight in inflicting maximum pain.  Jay Mohr who was in ""Street Kings"" this year & has been on TV's ""Ghost Whisperer"" plays small-time bookie Augie.  Augie's partner Murph is played by the good-looking Grant Sullivan.  Sullivan finds love with Veronica who is played by Carla Gugino from 2005's ""Sin City.""  Roth wreaks revenge on Augie.  This leaves Detective Bruner played by Kelsey Grammer to put the pieces together.

The performances throughout are strong.  Forest Whitaker well reflects the bounce between addiction and those we love & hurt.  Sullivan & Gugino play well off each other as the small-time hood & his girlfriend.  Jay Mohr also makes a strong showing as a bookie with standards.  ""Even Money"" is not an extremely good film, but it is different & gripping, well worth an evening's entertainment.  Enjoy!",1227484800,2,2359,5.4502762430939224
2875696,2,B000RW3VE8,"""I'm not perfect! Nobody's perfect!"" That's one of the catchphrases of a gambling addict, and it's an ironic one, for a lot of them chase perfection in their chosen field of wagering. They believe in hot dice, cold cards, and working a certain slot in a certain corner of the casino. Some of them double as drug addicts or alcoholics, but all of them have taken their pursuit for a competitive high into that zone of desperation and fevered, last chance bets - the ones that will square them for good, or consign them to terminal poverty. These bliss/doom wagers are the addiction in full bloom. Nothing feels as good as escaping the grasp of ruin to bet another day.

""Even Money,"" a low-rent B-flick about gamblers, doesn't delve into that much detail. Rather, it's a sleazy, high-level view of a business that has its meat hooks in people and its fingers in a bunch of proverbial community pies. No doubt that's true, but since it's so riddled with cliches and archetypes that went stale after Raymond Chandler died, the movie is more inane than indicting.

Opening with some half-baked monologue from a crippled detective (Kelsey Grammer, ridiculous) about a man's wants in the world, Robert Tannen's screenplay presents a variety of addicts: Novelist Carol (Kim Basinger) is attracted to slots; a plumber named Clyde (Forest Whitaker) asks his basketball-playing brother (Nick Cannon) to shave a few points in an upcoming game; and Walter (Danny DeVito) is a pitiful washed up magician who befriends Carol for reasons never quite established. Throw in a couple small-time bookies (Jay Mohr and Grant Sullivan), a patient, suffering girlfriend (Carla Gugino), and a Eurotrash fixer (Tim Roth), and you've got yourself an ensemble souffl!

Highlights? Not a ton. Well, Gugino's still beautiful. Ray Liotta stops by, and it's not to play a maniac or a cop, or a maniac cop. He and on-screen wife Basinger have a few good moments. There's some honor in the way Whitaker tackles his character, an antsy, loud type who's not quite as smart as he thinks he is - whose emotions are always a step ahead of his words. But the point-shaving subplot is simply botched - no coach who guesses a player is on the take is going to keep starting him.

Walter worms his way in and out of the movie without any discernible purpose, other than to kick up the pathos a few notches; DeVito can still act, but he's a pure cipher here. Roth borrows James Spader's playbook from ""Two Days In The Valley"" to no avail. Mohr's his typical, irritating self. Was it his idea to gulp his ulcer-soothing Pepto-Bismol throughout the movie? Couldn't it have at least been a generic brand?

Finally, for reasons unknown, Grammer not only tries on polio as a character trait, but a frog voice from the back of his throat, and giant prosthetic nose and chin. With a khaki trench coat and a pasted-on mustache, he looks and sounds like a Vegas Muppet cop. Where is this guy from? Who gave Grammer, a ham-and-egger if there ever was one, this kind of latitude in a supposedly serious film?",1206748800,2,3055,4.745762711864407

Despite its decidedly un-ambitious nature, ""Even Money"" is a modern film noir melodrama with more storylines and characters than Robert Altman's ""Nashville.""  Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, Ray Liotta, Kelsey Grammer, Forest Whitaker, Grant Sullivan, Jay Mohr, and Carla Gugino all play individuals whose only real connection is that they are in some way or another touched by the evils of gambling.

Robert Tannen's overstuffed screenplay wanders all over the map, forcing the actors to spend most of their time just trying to keep up with all the narrative permutations (no need to reiterate them here).  The most ludicrous subplot features DeVito as a washed-up magician who contemplates a professional comeback by teaming up with the best-selling author and compulsive gambler played by Basinger.  Individually, any of the various plot strands might have made for an interesting movie, but taken together, they just keep getting in each others' way.

Veteran filmmaker Mark Rydell has not only helmed the piece but appears in a crucial cameo role late in the film.  Sad to say, he doesn't make much of an impact in either capacity.",1205280000,2,1139,5.191256830601093
2875698,3,B000RW3VE8,"Over the weekend, I watched Even Money.  It reminded me of Crash in terms of how the movie flowed.  There were four or five characters.  The film revolved around each of their lives.  The common element among them was gambling.

I read some of the reviews before watching the movie.  Overall, the movie is worth renting.  It is not great, but it is an okay movie.",1200182400,2,363,4.409090909090909
2875699,3,B000RW3VE8,"While I don't consider this a candidate for any movie award, it does have strong performances by Basinger and Liotta. Both give this movie something that Devito could not do, act their roles. I recommend this movie only for their storyline.

I also liked Kelsey Grammer's detective role and makeup. He really appeared to become the character; while Devito was playing the same guy from Deck the Halls.

Watch this when there is nothing else to rent at the video store. However, I think buying it used from the Marketplace is cheaper.",1197849600,2,533,4.782608695652174
2875700,2,B000RW3VE8,"When I saw this great ensemble cast I thought wow, it has to be decent; then a professional poker player recommended it. Okay I'll rent it. Wow. Very painful to watch. The biggest problem I could see is the writing; specifically the story lines are very weak and the dialogue between characters is absolutely awful. So many stereotypes and cliches. I did manage to make it through the entire movie but was very disappointed overall. Kelsey Grammar is in the movie for about four minutes total and his is by far the worst performance of the bunch. Ray Liotta is passable as is Whittaker. Bassinger and DeVito are very mediocre which led me to conclude that the director is as much to blame as the writer. I would not watch it again and would not recommend it.",1197072000,8,758,4.54014598540146

8202572,4,B000RW3VE8,"Not an awesome movie, but pretty good. Solid performances, except for Tim Roth doing his usual villain bit, which can be tiring. Kelsey Grammer changed his voice. I could hardly tell it was him. I was impressed. I'm used to him talking like Frasier.

Kim Basinger was rather good. It's unusual to see a character in a film who is a gambling addict. She played the character quite well.

Danny DeVito did well as a washed up, impoverished magician. Like DeVito, Forrest Whitaker had a very pitiful part. Hard to watch. Nick Cannon was decent. Interesting to see Ray Liotta play a guy who neither kills anyone nor gets killed. He had a small supporting role as an English professor, and the devoted husband of Basinger's character. Basinger still looks good in this film, by the way.

Yeah, a good film. Somewhat original. Interesting character studies. Not exactly a happy movie, but you probably guessed that. It's not a total tragedy, at least. Watch the trailer first.. see what you think.",1497916800,,991,4.783625730994152

Basinger, Liotta, Whitaker, and Devito do a great job of portraying flawed but goodhearted people struggling with the consequences of gambling addiction.

That being said, the movie was full of clcihes--the basketball player redeems himself from accusations of point shaving by hitting a buzzer beater to win the game, bookie who beats up people  becomes a good guy after falling in love, etc. The ending could have been better.

Worth watching, but could have been better.",1422144000,,640,5.134615384615385
8202578,4,B000RW3VE8,"Even Money is getting slammed because it's got yesteryear A list stars in a low budget indie label drama (Yari Releasing wants to be like a major studio, but it's just not.. Even though FOX distributes the title, they didn't produce/make it).. But here's the thing with Even Money - it's not a big studio picture; which is good because it probably wasn't test screened 30 times before it made it to the screen/dvd.. It didn't get made based profits or via focus groups and corporate tinkering which leaves big studio movies feeling flat and one dimensional... Which is why I usually prefer indie flicks to most of the big budget maximized for the biggest profit trash...

What I like most about this movie is that unlike other gambling movies or movies with a similar them; such as ""High Roller"", ""21"", ""Lucky You"", ""Spent"", ""Deal"" & ""Yonkers Joe"", ""Even Money"" doesn't romanticize the gambling.. but ultimately it doesn't preach either..it just is.. and it's more genuine than the other films.

I felt a connection with Kim Basinger's character. People are dismissing Basinger's character & they also comment on her acting in the film; but THAT'S how a gambling addict acts... and her character is so desperate to feel alive by trying to get one huge slot hit.. it's so important to her that she's willing to risk lying to and possibly losing her husband (played by Ray Liotta) by saying she's out working on her next book, believing in a washed up magician(played by Danny DeVito)and draining her family's bank account just to have that one hit - even though she drains her account for tens of thousands of dollars, which is more than she'd ever hit on one of those machines.

If you go to sites like You Tube you see countless clips of people hitting it big on the slots.. and in some movies like the horrible ""What Happens in Vegas"" makes it seem like everyone's a winner when you play the slots or gamble..or like someone can ""actually"" win $3 Million on a quarter slot.......yeah..... sure, that happens... But I won't waste my time reviewing that mess...

The fact is, gambling can be fun and it can be addictive.. But like with any addiction, whether it's alcohol, drugs etc., it's knowing when to say when.. I liked Even Money because it just tells it like it is & shows what can happen if you don't know when to say when..

There's also storylines with Forrest Whitaker and Nick Cannon shaving points off a basketball game and Tim Roth, Jay Mohr and Kelsey Grammer as thug bookies.. but for me, it's Basinger's storyline which shined.. I just liked this movie.. Just my opinion.. Now I'm off to the casino... (j/k)",1346630400,,2624,4.670995670995671

Several loosely based gambling plots get spun together and the odds of it being interesting or enjoyable are slightly less than hitting the lottery.  Not a single actor performs poorly, but there was never the threat of Oscar glory coming from this pedestrian collaboration.  Too many egos grasping for the headliner role is clearly the source of this film's demise.  Whoever green-lighted such latitude for guys like Devito, Grammar, and Jay Mohr - who should quit acting, forever - should be chased out of Hollywood by pitbulls with herpes.  And the pitchfork carrying men who hold the dogs' leashes should be the source of infection.
