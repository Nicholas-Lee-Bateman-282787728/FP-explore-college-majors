8266284,4,B0017KXD38,"I know this isn't going to be a huge draw for most people, but this is still the only set that I'm aware of that features the full uncut widescreen version of Gus Trikonis's infamous film ""The Sidehackers!"" Depending on your tastes for b-movies, this collection would be worth full price for that alone. However, this set also includes the documentary ""Death Riders,"" which is sort of like ""Jackass 1976""-- again, I would have paid full price for this set for that film itself. However, ""Death Riders"" and most of the other films in this set are now available elsewhere, making ""The Sidehackers"" the real draw here. One last note: this set also includes ""The Wild Riders,"" which for some reason is not listed in the product description.

Update: I had a look at the version of ""The Sidehackers"" on the Mill Creek ""Savage Cinema"" collection, and it *is* fullscreen, so this set is indeed the only way to get the widescreen version of that film. The transfer in this set looks a lot better, and allows you to see Gus Trikonis's brilliant mise-en-scene as it was meant to be seen!",1305331200,,1077,4.638743455497382
8266285,2,B0017KXD38,"When I purchased this DVD i was thinking a clearer copy of the movies I owned from it, and seeing a few movies I did not own.  In the end neither was worth it.  Thecopies are about the same as you can find on any Mill Creek product and the few films I did not own sucked anyways.  i owned it exactly 3 days before I resold it on eBay.",1268697600,,334,3.742857142857143
