2769650,5,B000NJMJGQ,"The Last Detective is one of the best Detective series although the title, until properly explained, is a sad bad mistake. However, that is the only negative thing I have to say about this wonderful Series.

Peter Davison is a fine and very competent actor. He has played policemen - of one sort or another - on many occasions and is supremely believable. He is ably aided by Rob Spendlove as his Detective Inspector and, to a slightly lesser extent, Sean Hughes as his erstwhile friend Mod.  I also enjoy the regular appearance of a badly behaved mammoth mutt, but the dog's acting leaves much to be desired!

'Dangerous Davis' the Last Detective, is a man out of sync with his working colleagues who, it appears, always choose the 'easy way'. Davis is a throwback to the pre 1960's when police worked using their brains and their 'local knowledge' which was built by experience. They worked successfully, without the assistance of abundant technical equipment and scientific devices. Davis is the quintessential policeman we admired and respected. Would that we had an abundance of them today!

The Last Detective will be enjoyed by all who enjoy a rollicking yarn, decent humour and fine acting. The Series deserves the success it is getting. Enjoy!",1220745600,,1252,4.8915094339622645
2769651,4,B000NJMJGQ,"""The Last Detective, Series 3,""another in the hit British mystery television series, is now becoming available in the United States for the first time.  The police procedural/comedy/drama was made by Granada for the United Kingdom's Independent Television (ITV).  It debuted in the U.K. in February 2003, and offers a lighter-hearted, but still high-quality, blend of mystery and comedy similar  to that of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-Set-13/dp/B001V7YZD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders: Set 13</a>; and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hetty-Wainthropp-Investigates-Complete-Collection/dp/B000R349GQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hetty Wainthropp Investigates - Complete Collection</a>. It's based on the ""Dangerous Davies"" novels of the Welshman Leslie Thomas.  This release consists of a two-volume boxed set including four all-new full-length productions.  Unfortunately, it does not come with subtitles, so the viewer is in for rather a struggle with the North London accents the actors have been encouraged to use, logically enough, as it is set in North London.  Nevertheless, I consider it a lucky find.

It's set in Willesden, a totally unimportant, small, totally out of the way North London precinct, and appears to have been filmed there.  It stars Peter Davison (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Creatures-Great-Small-The-Complete-Series-1-Collection/dp/B000062XDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Creatures Great & Small: The Complete Series 1 Collection</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Campion-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00008DDXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Campion - The Complete First Season</a>) as Detective Constable - and it's quite a disgrace to be only a detective constable--""Dangerous"" Davies.  His chances of promotion are nil; he's the eponymous last detective his supervisor would ever willingly assign to a case, and he gets the least promising ones.  But he does generally get his man, or, possibly, woman.  He's an average Joe looks-wise, and a rumpled, galumphing, unassuming sort.  But he does love his job, and he's surprisingly good at it.  He also loves his sexy, beautiful blond wife, Julie (Emma Amos), but, in this particular series, they are separated.  And he's rooming with his wild and crazy friend Mod (Sean Hughes,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Commitments/dp/6305622922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Commitments</a>).  Hughes brings a lot to his part, but so do the other leads, and, in fact, the series is consistently well-acted and directed.  The mysteries are reasonably complex and satisfying, too.  They are:

1. ""Friends Reunited."" Wealthy mobile phone magnate Nick Roberts is stabbed to death at his college reunion; all evidence seems to point to Simon Dabney, Nick's best friend in school days, now a broken - and broke--bitter drug addict.  But Davies insists on believing Dabney's absurd alibi.  This episode allows its makers to visit London's underworld, indulging in what strikes me as faux nostalgia.  I wasn't there at the time or place, but I rather doubt the underworld was peopled by such gentlemen.  It certainly hasn't been since the heyday of the Kray brothers, in the late 1950's, 1960s: they were terrifyingly violent psychotics.  And they've been followed by Jamaican posses, Chinese tongs, and Russian maffias, whom you'd really rather not cross.  Still, the episode is emotionally satisfying.
2. ""Towpaths of Glory."" Decorated war veteran Frank Moore is found murdered and dumped in a local rubbish heap.  Upon investigation, Davies finds that his domestic life was less than blissful; and that his former army comrades may know more than they're saying.  Another emotionally satisfying experience.
3. ""Three Steps to Hendon."" The Overnight Sensations supposedly topped the pop charts back in the 1970's with their smash single, ""Yesterday's Boy.""  But time has rolled on, and their former lead singer Teddy O'Connor, has been feeling a lot like ""Yesterday's Boy,"" himself.  Then he turns up murdered.  In his investigation, Davies discovers there's a dark underside to glam rock - what a surprise.  The frequently seen Ian McNeice (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murder-Rooms-The-Dark-Beginnings-of-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/B000EXZFRG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murder Rooms - The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes</a>) guest stars here, and turns in a gratifyingly strong performance.
4. ""Willesden Confidential.""  Champion stockcar driver Geoff ""The Duke"" Fallon appears to have been killed in a fiery racetrack fire after an accident.  But Davies has a feeling it's murder, and arrests a young hoodlum, apparently bent on revenge, for sabotaging Fallon's car.  But Davies has a further feeling, and keeps looking.

These shows are really well-done, and deserve to be seen on broadcast TV over here.  But meanwhile, there are the DVDs.",1218931200,,5096,6.466076696165191
2769652,4,B000NJMJGQ,The third entry in the series was as good as the ones before.  This one ended on a more upbeat note that the others.,1206835200,,116,3.8333333333333335
2769653,5,B000NJMJGQ,"I am not the smoothest reviewer on the Internets but since there were only six reviews of TLD3, one of them a splenetic one-star for mention of the ""diety""[sic], I feel I must weigh in.

THE LAST DETECTIVE is the perfect mystery series for the modern Anglo-friendly viewer.  It sets the exact light, self-deprecating, mildly serious tone the subject matter deserves.  From the score and title to the acting of the leads, character roles and guest stars, we are given a gift of a visit to Dangerous Davies's world: bracing, bittersweet, rich in detail and fully alive with modern drama.

I suppose there are other actors (Britain is certainly rich with them) who could have filled out the title role, but what Peter Davison has done with it is a landmark realisation on the order of Columbo or THE SWEENEY'S Regan.  Every wrinkle of the middling Everyman with his slyly revealed backbone of steel is brought to life in Davison's performance.  You genuinely care about this man and his relationship with his sneering colleagues, his daft buddies, his admiring subordinates and his Fellini-elf of a not quite ex wife.  You'd like to have a pint at the pub with him, and you'd love him to look into your missing Bentley while he was at it.

I strongly urge US and world viewers who enjoyed, for example, the superb LIFE ON MARS (UK) and, going back, Inspector Morse and Prime Suspect, to start at series 1 and get to know Dangerous, his whisky- and magnesia-swilling Gov, and his whole crew.  You will not be sorry.",1201564800,20,1511,4.693181818181818
2769654,1,B000NJMJGQ,"While this is an entertaining series with interesting characters, a good motif running throughout, there is always something that is inappropriate.  I.E.  a nude scene, or language that uses the name of diety.  I took the entire set and donated it to the county library.",1196553600,4,270,4.955555555555556
2769655,5,B000NJMJGQ,Not much to say beyond my title. The character developement is key in all mysteries in my opinion. It is done so well in this series. I enjoy the change from some of the usual fastidious detectives to find a dogged but highly ordinary/flawed detective. A detective that does not have a spotless record or a razor sharp mind. I can just hope they make many more!,1190678400,,361,4.402985074626866
2769656,5,B000NJMJGQ,"The Last Detective....Peter Davison....should be the First Detective!

2769657,5,B000NJMJGQ,"The Last Detective is very entertaining. The storylines are good, the acting is wonderful as is the entire production.  No one does the ""cozies"" like the BBC.  I highly recommend this entire series.",1181260800,17,198,4.96969696969697
2769658,5,B000NJMJGQ,"I wrote a review for this set previously, but as I'd already gushed about season 2, I felt that was enough and I deleted my review (thanks Amazon for this feature).  However, I've decided to re-post a review.  This show started as a light detective series about a put-upon detective who was the last detective his boss would assign to an important case.  The show has progressed nicely, though, to the point where, in season 3, Dangerous Davies, the Last Detective, is now the backbone of his department.  His antagonistic co-workers and goofy buddy Mod have slid to the side, his boss is facing personal demons, and his wife is beginning, perhaps?, to see the strength in Peter Davison's character.  No longer really a laughingstock, Dangerous in this season shows himself a capable detective and a strong character upon whom others may rely.  Good shows keep getting better in their early years, and the Last Detective is such a show.  It is a gratifying tonic to the increased violence and explicit nature of cop and detective shows now appearing in both the USA and Britain.  Great stuff, and on my short list of favorites, along with Rumpole, Due South (seasons 1 & 2), Dead Like Me, Wonderfalls, Briscoe County, and Yes (Prime) Minister.  Shows about good people doing the right thing and finding strength inside their fallible selves.",1180137600,47,1341,4.8464912280701755

2769725,5,B000NJMJGQ,"""The Last Detective"" is a low key police procedural featuring a gentle, empathetic and much misunderstood main character, who never seems to get promoted despite constantly solving crimes. The stories are based on a series of novels, and all  that I have viewed so far--and I am midway through season four--have been engaging and interesting without being gory or sexually perverse. If you enjoy series such as "" At Touch of Frost"" and  ""Foyle's War"" you will enjoy this well produced series featuring interesting aspects of working class London.",1481846400,,546,5.123595505617978

2769836,5,B000NJMJGQ,Not very many leading characters on television are admirable. Peter Davison played an underappreciated detective whose only flaw seems to be being too nice.

2769893,4,B000NJMJGQ,"I really like this mystery series and I've seen the whole thing.  The Last Detective is about a middle aged detective whose colleagues call ""Dangerous"" as his nickname.  It's not used as a compliment but rather with derision. Dangerous is not flashy or exciting.  Instead he works each case and seldom takes the easy answers.  He isn't worried about solve rates.  He just wants to do it right.

At work, he is the rumpled one.  No flash and dash.  He doesn't have a partner and is sent to crime scenes that shouldn't have any detective work attach.  He has no hope for promotion.  Yet, he really works the cases and is interested in seeing justice done.  There aren't any rippling muscles shown, not state of the art equipment, no media, and no car chases.

So why do I like this series so much.  The people are just the people you see every day.  With the same problems that everyone has.  Over many of the series, Dangerous is having marital problem.  The way real people have problems.  And you get to see them resolved over time.  Dangerous does have a comedic foil, his friend Mod.  And what a lunatic.  I guess I like this show so much is that I really like the the people in it.  From the alcoholic boss and styled hair star detective to the wife and friend.  And I cheer on Dangerous each episode simply because I like him and the way he goes about life.",1370390400,,1362,4.385542168674699

2769895,5,B000NJMJGQ,"Former Doctor Who, Peter Davison, is perfect in this role of an empathetic and unassuming detective who solves crimes by paying attention to detail and by listening to people around him.  He is both misunderstand and underestimated by his co-workers and his it's-all-about-me wife.  Like other quirky detectives (Monk, etc.) he slogs on despite the ridicule and practical jokes from his peers and always ends up saving the day.  The most annoying thing about the series is that despite his track record his peers continue to be jerks.",1370217600,,534,5.045454545454546

2769905,4,B000NJMJGQ,"The Last Detective is a well-written character driven British detective show. I like the quiet stubbornness of the main character. They call him Dangerous, because he appears to a mild mannered non-violent man. However he is also a very good detective and always solves the crime. Dangerous also has a messy personal life and an odd friend that make the story interesting too.

The crimes are good mysteries that don't always have the obvious solution. Of course I've also been fond of Peter Davison since I first saw him as Doctor Who, so I enjoyed seeing him play this character.",1366329600,,581,4.81

2769921,4,B000NJMJGQ,"As with most British TV dramas, the production values and writing are high quality. There are fresh faces in the cast, but many top-notch regulars as well. As a great many British TV actors are ""classicly trained"" (Shakespeare theater) it would not have surprised me to hear them break into the middle of King Lear or something. They bring an edgy excitement to their work, and unlike with US TV crime shows, I promise you they do not sleepwalk through the script. There is just enough personal life to flesh out the main character, a compassionate slightly bumbling detective who sees what others do not, with the help of an eccentric friend who reads a lot.

A slightly jarring note for me was the other detectives on the squad, whose main purpose seemed to be to make life difficult for ""Dangerous"" Davies by practical jokes and snarky remarks.

If you like British cop shows, you should enjoy this slightly off-beat departure from a recent string of ""tough woman gets promoted, fights chauvinism as well as crime.""",1361836800,,1018,4.778409090909091

2769924,5,B000NJMJGQ,"If you enjoy seeing characters evolve in a series, this British mystery series is sure to delight.  In the first season, Dangerous the detective only got the good cases by default.  He came across as a bit of a ""loser""--department colleagues laughed at him, boss demoted him, wife divorced him, even his dog led him about on the leash.

But through sheer persistence and solid detective work, Dangerous is now respected and the star of the department.  The cases are more interesting, he is competent and confident, so even the ex-wife is coming around.  Personally, I think he could do better than her, but you can't deny her pouty appeal.  We'll see if he succumbs.

This is now a seriously solid series. Even the plots are getting better. The boozy boss ""guv"" is growing on you, Mod his best friend and roommate is slightly less irritating and sparks some of Dangerous's best comic lines, and Dangerous is getting dangerously attractive.",1355616000,,940,4.8375

This one however, is somewhat unique in that it focuses more on the characters than the actual crime itself.  Peter Davies, who plays the lead role (also played Tristan in All Creatures Great and Small)seems at first unambitious, a little lazy or complacent, becomes likeable as you watch how he turns ordinary, mundane moments into opportunity to solve a piece if the crime puzzle.  I feel as if I have been ""reeled into my own life and am left to ponder my own outcome.""I began ordering the series, loved it and think you will too.",1296345600,,644,4.68141592920354

The change in all the characters from beginning to end,has been fun,and he is a pleasure to watch. Wish there had been more.",1271203200,,332,4.459016393442623
2769929,5,B000NJMJGQ,"This is a really good detective series. The characters are all very interesting and they evolve throughout the series. Mod, the detective's friend, is very funny. Dangerous is clearly the most competent detective in his precinct, but he is too nice a guy and he always gets put down even with his many successes. The stories are also very entertaining, and they are not as complicated as some British mysteries.",1245024000,,411,4.885714285714286
