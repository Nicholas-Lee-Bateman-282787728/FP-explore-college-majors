987213,4,6305182205,"Not that much different from the other Blackman DVD sets, though the ending of the last episode contains a few too many references to ""Goldfinger"". The biggest surprise is that Steed calls up an unnamed female replacement for Cathy immediately after she departs.

987215,3,6305182205,"there was Mrs Gale and Venus Smith.

These seven episodes of pre-Mrs Peel Avengers episodes.  The series was originally meant to be a more serious spy adventure series about two agents Dr. Keel and a much less debonair John Steed.  The second series (season to Americans) focused more on Steed, eliminating the Dr. and teaming him with Venus Smith and Cathy Gale among others.  Cathy Gale, an accomplished, educated, self confident woman with considerable martial arts training is very much Steed's equal despite being an 'amateur' agent.  She has very much in common with Emma Peel although her relationship with Steed, at least in the earliest episodes, is quite antagonistic and quite lacking the playful banter that would characterize the Steed/Peel exchanges.  Venus Smith is a very young (perhaps 20) nightclub singer who has no apparent secret agent skills or qualifications other than her admiration for Steed.  In many ways, her youth, inexperience, enthusiasm and adoration of Steed, she is a forerunner of Tara King.

The stories include: ""White Dwarf"" - an sci-fi sort of tale about the possible end of the world; ""Man in the Mirror"" - suspicious suicide and the living dead; ""Conspiracy of Silence"" - undercover at the circus to stop a Mafia drug ring;""A Chorus of Frogs"" - deep sea murder and foreign agents; ""Six Hands Across A Table"" - corrupt businessmen attempt to control British shipbuilding; ""Killerwhale"" - smuggling in the boxing world;  ""Brief for Murder"" - corrupt lawyers use every means to free their clients.

""Man in the Mirror"" and ""A Chorus of Frogs"" feature Venus Smith, (and 'showcase' her singing), the rest pair Steed with Cathy Gale.  These are very low budget productions, completely lacking in the polish that appears in later years.  The stories are all in black and white, with rather sparse sets.  Camera work is jerky, sound quality uneven giving the whole thing a feeling of being shot live (which it was not) even to the point of leaving in obvious errors, like forgotten or wrong lines.

So why get these dvds?  For Avenger fans it is interesting to see the beginnings of their favorite secret agent, John Steed, to see him before he developed his lighthearted, polished sophistication.  Cathy and Venus are the forerunners of Emma Peel and Tara King and paired with Steed face not the campy eccentrics of the later series but instead more gritty serious villians.  In the later series the emphasis was on the flashy visuals, the campy comedy punctuated by adventure here the reverse is the case, the spy adventure is at times sprinkled with bits of comic relief.",1154217600,11,2608,4.958620689655173
987216,5,6305182205,"Fourth series for 1967, and sadly, the last of Emma Peel.  You could almost sense Diana Rigg's restlessness in the series.  The sparkle that had shown so brightly now had  a brittle cast to it, signaling clearly, she felt she'd outgrown the series.  And like Honor Blackman before her, was off to become a Bond girl.  Strange, this series has lived so long in the hearts of her fans, while the arguably worst Bond film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), was famous only because Bond married Rigg's character in the film and for being ""that film with Lazenby"".  Her fans might feel

2) ""Deans Man's Treasure"" - ""Steed rallies around - and Emma drives for her life.  One of the most fun episodes where Steed and Emma join a cross-country car rally.  Emma finds shocking results when she unravels the clues

3) ""You Have Just Been Murders"" - ""Steed chase a million - Emma runs off it with it"" has an ingenious blackmailer using the threat of ""fake murders"" to demonstrate just how he can kill his victims to get them to pay

4) ""The Positive-Negative Man"" - ""Steed makes the sparks fly - and Emma gets switched on""  Anyone involved in the mysterious ""Project 90"" is suddenly being turned to toast

5) ""Murdersville""  ""Emma marries Steed - and Steed becomes a father""  When Emma visits a friend in the tiny village of Little Storping, she finds strange doings.  When she fails to turn up, Steed rushes to figure out what has happened to her, and soon finds a town where for a price you can kill anyone you want

6) ""Mission Highly Improbable"" - ""Steed falls into enemy hands - and Emma is cut down to size.""  This episode really see Rigg's boredom starting to show through.  A scientist has develops a machine that can shrink anything down to miniature size.

7) ""The Forget-Me-Knot"" is the episode where the world big farewell to Emma Peel and hello to Tara King(Linda Thorson).  Emma is hit with an amnesia inducing dart and held prison in an old glass factory.  Steed is paired with the gorgeous Tara to track down Emma.  This episode is the first to introduce Mother.

As I sip my bottle of Night Train and nosh on my spaghetti with Vienna sausage bits in it, I can't help but reflect on how very much I have in common with John Steed and the incomparable Mrs. Emma Peel, those two classy British super-agents. Like those two clotheshorses, I am never less than exquisitely turned out as I harbor fondness for the very best hoodie fabrics from the Gap. And, like them, I'm more than capable of resolving a sticky situation. Ask me about The Adventure of the Lost Parking Stub some time, or The Puzzle of the Two Stuck Together Shopping Carts at Walmart. I feel eminently qualified to comment on THE AVENGERS '67 SET 4 DVD collection.

No one karate chopped her way into the television audiences' hearts quite like Mrs. Emma Peel and one can't help but be impressed with John Steed's impeccable manners and old world sophistication. THE AVENGERS specialized not only in imaginative stories which sometimes strayed into the area of wild science-fiction, it also established a standard for elegance, wit, and sexual subtext. Even more than the espionage capers, people tuned in for the undeniable chemistry between the well-starched Patrick MacNee and the fabulous Diana Rigg and their clever jousting with words and that unspoken smoldering thing between them. Slightly surreal meets mod meets tongue-in-cheek meets stylish bowler hat meets sleek Lotus Elan convertible, all these elements adding up to one irrefutable conclusion: Let all eccentric evil masterminds in the 1960s beware.

THE AVENGERS '67 SET 4 DVD collection presents several production stills by way of bonus material. More gratifyingly, it also gives us these seven episodes (with ""The Forget-Me-Knot"" - featuring Mrs. Peel's final appearance - counting as a bonus episode).

- ""The 50,000 Breakfast"" - High level jitters at the British Treasury compel Steed and Mrs. Peel to investigate a case involving a dead ventriloquist found with stolen diamonds lining his stomach. As one observing surgeon remarks regarding the corpse: ""High on carat, low on protein.""

- ""Dead Man's Treasure"" - In a fun romp, Steed and Mrs. Peel compete (on different teams) in a foul-plagued car rally combined with a treasure hunt, and with two underhanded cads having gotten themselves an invite. Love the sight gag about the Swingingdale road sign.

- ""You Have Just Been Murdered"" - Time and again millionaires are being creatively fake-murdered, with the promise of the real murder being carried out should they not meet the fiendish extortionist's asking price of 1,000,000.

- ""The Positive-Negative Man"" - Steed and Mrs. Peel are charged with a crackling good case when an assassin who can channel electricity begins executing scientists connected to the mysterious abandoned Project 90. The Avengers must stay grounded to solve this one.

- ""Murdersville"" - Mrs. Peel and a childhood friend unearth a sweeping conspiracy when they drive into Little Storping In-The-Swuff, a quaint little town what's been voted the ""Best Kept Village In the Country""... for murder. Talk about creepy villagers...

- ""Mission Highly Improbable"" - Baffling goings-on during a military field testing unveil enemy agents and a device which can reduce matter. Into the fray leap Steed and Mrs. Peel, both of whom are no shrinking violets.

- ""The Forget-Me-Knot"" - In a bittersweet episode which closes the curtain on the Emma Peel era, a rash of amnesia cloaks a traitor within Steed's spy organization. In the end Mrs. Peel cedes her place by Steed's side to new agent Tara King (Linda Thorson). Oh, and we meet ""Mother,"" that corpulent government gent what gives Steed his marching orders.",1323648000,,3809,5.0702875399361025

987357,4,6305182205,"These episodes are considered the beginning of the Avengers to most fans of the show today. These are probably the best episodes with the Cathy Gale character. As she is forced to become deeply involved in criminal organizations undercover with the direction of Steed. Each episode has a theme of a murderous criminal minds, and it is not truly apparent who is behind it all until the end.

This dvd set is a better bargain than most of the Cathy Gale era with 7 instead of 6 episodes. However, 2 of them are with the spunky Venus Smith instead of Gale.

Also, be aware that when you buy the TWO volume set, it comes with an additional cardboard (very nice) packaging case to hold together the two Plastic DVD cases in one unit. This cardboard packaging has all the details of both DVDs on the outside.",1211846400,2,837,5.423076923076923
987361,5,6305182205,"Prior to 1967, ""The Avengers"" was yielded in black-and-white. Going to color was a definite improvement!

This DVD package, (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in a box, this is ""Set No. 4,"" color-coded PURPLE), is just one of FOUR sets which take in all the 1967 episodes. The marketing of ""The Avengers"" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the ""set"") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.

1967 was Diana Rigg's last season as Steed's partner. The BONUS EPISODE in this set, introduces Steed's new partner, Tara King, (played by Linda Thorson), and she takes us into and through 1968 which was the final season for ""The Avengers"".

Rigg's career really launched in 1965 from this fine series in her role as Mrs. Emma Peel, the sexy and lively partner to the refined secret agent Englishman, John Steed, who was shrewdly played by Patrick Macnee. In fact, in the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier, '63 and '64) partners until many years later.

Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when ""The Avengers"" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of the series. Starting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. Never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from ""The Avengers'"" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish.

Each 52-minute episode is futuristic and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". You'll encounter, in these episodes, every nemesis ranging from a killer nanny to a mind-transfer device!

Here, we're talking about SEVEN very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes.

Volume 7:

""The 50,000 Breakfast"" -- A ventriloquist is comatose due to a car crash. X-rays reveal 50,000 in stolen diamonds in his stomach which were about to be smuggled out of England and into Switzerland. Steed, posing as a blackmailer, fences them back to the Litoff Corporation, the original owners of the jewels who want no publicity since the ventriloquist was their own employee. But very soon thereafter, one of the Litoff people gives the lamentable ventriloquist a fatal injection before he can recover and tell what he knows. Then, the ventriloquist's wife trys her own hand at blackmail -- she soon meets her husband's fate. As it turns out, Litoff's people are hiding another BIG (criminal) secret. Steed and Mrs. Peel get a bit too nosy for these devious folks and you know what that means!

""Dead Man's Treasure"" -- A millionaire sponsors a sports car rally and the prize is a big, red treasure chest with a nice bit of cash inside. But, through a comedy of British spy errors, the chest also contains a secret government document. To retrieve it, Steed and Mrs. Peel must compete in the car rally with partners that they don't know... they also have to compete for their lives!

""You Have Just Been Murdered"" -- Millionaires are being intimidated into paying extortion money when it's demonstrated to each one that he can, and will, be murdered if he doesn't pay up. Steed and Mrs. Peel try to help out one target millionaire by stealing the suitcase filled with cash. Mrs. Peel makes a successful grab but she doesn't know that, in addition to the cash, this shrewd millionaire has also placed a bomb in the suitcase!

Volume 8:

""The Positive-Negative Man"" -- The secret notes for ""Project 90"" have been mysteriously rendered to ashes. Then, all the scientists involved with the project are being systematically murdered... by a man who can electrocute people with simply a touch of his finger! Steed and Mrs. Peel soon discover the ""source of power"" -- in more ways than one. A great episode.

""Murdersville"" -- A murderer kills a rich man in a small village. He bribes most of the townsfolk, keeping them quiet by splitting the take of the murdered man's millions -- but a few honest hold-outs must be held in the town's little museum. Then, the crooked folks of the village let it be known that you can murder anyone there... for a price. Unfortunately, an old friend of Mrs. Peel decides to retire and Mrs. Peel drives him to his doom at his new resdience near ""Murdersville"". Steed races to Mrs. Peel's rescue.

""Mission Highly Improbable"" -- This is another ""sci-fi"" episode. An old professor on a military base is worried about an upcoming audit and inspection in regard to how he's been spending the government's money. But he need not worry becuase when it's discovered that he's used the funds to invent a great secret weapon for Great Britain, clearly all will be forgiven -- it's a ray gun that shrinks anything it's aimed at! But there's trouble right off. A high-ranking military officer goes missing as he enters the base. Then, the primary military weapon which was also invented by the professor, an armored vehicle which withstands direct artillery fire, also disappears. No doubt there is a defector on the premises and he's about to sell the secret vehicle, as well as the shrinking ray, to the Ruskies. Steed and Mrs. Peel encounter a ""little"" trouble!

""BONUS EPISODE: The Forget-Me-Knot"" -- This is the episode that broke my heart. Agents of Steed's and Mrs. Peel's organization are developing amnesia, (thanks to strategically-wielded dart guns loaded with a memory-loss drug), and then they go missing. There's a defector in the agency and the top man is advised that it's Steed, who also goes missing. Meanwhile, Steed has met agent-in-training Tara King (played by Linda Thorson), who believes in Steed's loyalty and she tries to help him. Mrs. Peel also takes a dart which further complicates Steed's investigation of the matter. I'll spare you the spoiler but the heartbreaker is that Mrs. Peel's husband, ace flyer Peter Peel, is suddenly located in the Amazonian jungle where he had apparently crashed years before! So, Mrs. Peel retires from the agency to become a full-time wife and Steed gets a new partner, Tara King, the sweet gal who takes us into the final year of ""The Avengers,"" 1968! This is really a sad episode for fans of Mrs. Peel, (Diana Rigg).

The storylines of the various ""The Avengers"" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1967 marked an even higher level of absurdity. This did not diminish my love for the ""The Avengers"" because the overall series always manifested a ""Batman"" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention it only to prepare viewers for this actuality.

The casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Rigg's provocative, '60s mod body suits much accentuate her sensual magnetism with the notable change from black-and-white to color.

I've reviewed all the '65, '66, and '67 sets so you can check the appropriate sites for details of each episode. In the meantime, this particular set garners my highest recommendation!",1211846400,4,7497,4.857478465152702
