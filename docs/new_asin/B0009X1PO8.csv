2332103,5,B0009X1PO8,"These 2 DVDs are so wonderful. To see so many of the greats all seated together and singing one by one, and sometimes together, is a country music fan's Hillbilly Heaven dream. I especially enjoyed Barbara Fairchild. I loved her ""Teddy Bear Song"" when she was young. She has matured so beautifully. Her rendition of ""You've Got Me Under Your Spell Again"" just brings goosebumps. Also loved Willie and Kris Kristoferson. But the entire bunch is fantastic. I highly recommend this!",1260403200,6,479,4.925925925925926
2332104,5,B0009X1PO8,"After searching throughout the entire world I finally found Ralph Emery's Country Legends DVD Vol 1 & 2 at Amazon. I had seen some excerpts on
You Tube and it was so promising that I decided to get them. The 2
DVDs are exceptionally good The sound and image are brilliant, the
artists all legends: Kris Kristoffesron, Willie Nelson, Glen Campbell,
B.J.Thomas, Bobby Bare, Porter Wagoner, Mickey Gilley, Gene Watson,
B.J.Shaver, Lorrie Morgan, Janie Fricke, the incredible Barbara Fair-
child, Mel Tillis. It's a fantastic jam session and the interpretations sound sometimes even better than the originals on record. The artists
tell us the whereabouts of each song and the whole show is out of this
world. A special mention of the band behind the singers. An abolute
must for the real country fans especially for all of us who loved
country music from the 60's, 70's and 80's. This incredible country
gathering is divided into 2 DVDs so you need both. Each one lasts
approximately 90 minutes so the complete gathering is a little over
3 hours.",1215734400,52,1043,4.865168539325842
2332105,5,B0009X1PO8,"I gave Volume I and II to my father for Christmas and he loves them. My parents used to watch Ralph Emery regularly - and they were some of his biggest fans. Mom is gone now, but dad (who is 84 and still runs a large farm) watches these DVD's over and over. Ralph Emery and all of his guests are classics. Good entertainment for young and old!",1205452800,24,343,4.0588235294117645

All big stars like Kris Kristoferson, Bobby Bare, Willie Nelson and many others giving their very best in such a casual surrounding. Sound quality is good. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves and feel so at home with an excellent backing band too. I am looking forward to Vol. 3 since there are a few I have seen on U_tube which have not been included in these two volumes such as Bobby Bare singing ""Four Strong winds"" with Ralph commenting just how much he likes it!",1275350400,4,554,4.388349514563107
