8018608,3,B0001Z4OVU,"Just a note, this is not the 1970 foreign language horror film directed by Pupi Avati starring Bob Tonelli, Greta Vayan, Gianni Cavina, Giulio Pizzirani, Andrea Matteuzzi.",1405209600,,171,5.37037037037037
8018609,4,B0001Z4OVU,"This exploitation flick that's about a fight over a rich family's inheritance is a suspenseful and well made horror film that kept me engrossed in its unpredictable and sometimes bizarre story. The setting is an isolated exquisite mansion and the surrounding area; nice scenery and some good atmosphere is present. We've got this greedy couple who arrive at the mansion in the beginning to apparently receive the inheritance from his father, a psychotic brain surgeon, by any means. Some surprises and odd twists then follow in a flick that kept me on edge. There's topless and also full frontal nudity in the flick. Aside from some sex scenes, there's a full frontal nude scene that's thrown in for exploitation. Lydie Denier strips completely nude in this scene for a bedridden old guy who wants her to strip before his death; if you want a full nude scene with a really attractive woman, then you'll like this part. The gore is limited and there isn't anything that I would call extreme, but it does have some decent gore. I thought it was well acted, directed, and I liked the twisted and strange story that contained some surprises. The film is talky in some scenes, it doesn't have a lot of action and is slow in some parts, and the body count is low.

This was obviously mastered from a VHS master, but I thought it looked pretty good overall. It's a little dark and some may be disappointed with the quality, but I've seen other films that look a lot worse than this when they were mastered from VHS sources. The color, contrast and sharpness are acceptable.",1380931200,2,1566,4.673913043478261
8018610,5,B0001Z4OVU,"BLOOD RELATIONS starts out like an erotically-charged thriller, turns into a mystery, and winds up a full-blown, manic horror fiesta! Nothing is as it seems. The story will appear to be heading in a certain direction, only to take a quick,  off-kilter turn. Lydie Denier is the increasingly perplexed Marie. She slowly uncovers the family secrets that will cost her so dearly. Kevin Hicks is Marie's unpredictable fiance, Thomas. Jan Rubes plays the overly-friendly, possibly unbalanced patriarch of this little psycho-drama. He definitely has hidden parts to his personality! BR is twisted, absurd, and in the end, utterly satisfying...",1247097600,6,637,5.434343434343434
8018611,4,B0001Z4OVU,"When a young man brings his fiancee home to the family mansion to meet the relatives, sinister happenings start to occur all around.  In a plot that should be too wacky to work but somehow does, it seems everybody has deep secrets and wicked motivations, with the young couple evidently scheming to knock the man's extremely wealthy father off in order to collect a large inheritance; with the father possibly guilty in the 'accidental' death of his own wife a couple of years back and possibly having sinister plans for his son's fiancee; and with the very aged, bed-ridden grandfather seemingly having some skeletons in his closet as well.  Throw into this the family doctor's apparant involvement with at least one nasty plot and his girlfriend's role in all of this, and it's hard to believe this isn't the outline for a farcical comedy.  But it's not, and somehow it manages to pull it off.  There's no question that there's a camp factor in here, but Blood Relations is another reminder that, occasionally, some campiness isn't all that bad.  Although most of the characters are pretty villainous, they're interesting, and there's some doubt as to just how guilty some of the parties really are or how far they plan to take their ideas; nonetheless there are few traditional 'innocents' in here.

  There are some definate problems with the movie that I'll address quickly; one is the sound job - during the early parts much of the movie is unintentionally hard to hear without having the volume so loud that the rest of the movie is thunderous; thankfully this is limited primarilily to two or three early scenes.  And occasionally the gaps in logic go too far, and require a sizable suspension of disbelief.

  Beyond those shortcomings, the movie is loaded to the max with classic horror/mystery elements.  With eerie and effective lighting, a great harpsichordish musical score, ominously creaking doors, a mansion in the wilderness, hidden passages and secret corridors, and the mystery of just what unholy frights are hidden away in the basement, not to mention a considerable sexy edge (bolstered by the beautiful and frequently naked Lydie Denier in the lead female role), this is the kind of movie that will make afficionados of this type of horror (like myself) overlook a couple of gaffes.  Highly recommended.",1217376000,,2327,4.948586118251928
8018612,5,B0001Z4OVU,"Don't listen to them, if you like b-movies with a bite to it, I highly recommend this movie.

Lydie Denier is amazing, beautiful and a very convincing actress. It's not really graphic until the end part. There are mild sexual scenes but not to the point of an R rating.",1161648000,5,269,4.38
8018613,3,B0001Z4OVU,"BLOOD RELATIONS plays like as twisted episode of TWILIGHT ZONE or NIGHT GALLERY, with Jan Rubes doing a pretty good Vincent Price imitation in his role as the rather demented doctor who has dire plans for his wayward son's new fiancee...just as he and she have similar plans for him..or do they?  Lydie Denier is a pretty good femme fatale and Kevin Hicks, looking a little like a young blonde Mel Gibson, is a studly partner.  The movie's writer Steven Saylor also joins in the murderous merriment as a crooked lawyer.  It's all been done before and there aren't really any surprises, but it's demented humor saves it from being a total washout.",1134864000,,646,4.699115044247788
8018614,1,B0001Z4OVU,"This was a slow movie. A young man returns home to his father's mansion with his new bride to be. The son seems to be at odds with his father concerning the cause of death of his mother 3 years before. The young man and his bride contrive to kill the father for the inheritance, but things aren't what they appear to be. The father is a neuro-surgeon, that is, a brain surgeon. I suppose you can guess the implications of this concerning a horror film of this nature.

I was not pleased with the outcome of this movie. I'd like to give my view of the outcome, but then, I wouldn't want to spoil it for those who might be interested in seeing this film.

It was a slow movie, not to my liking. I enjoy good horror movies but this wasn't one of them.",1092009600,,748,4.116438356164384
