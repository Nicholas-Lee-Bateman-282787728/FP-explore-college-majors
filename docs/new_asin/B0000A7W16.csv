1903573,5,B0000A7W16,"Based on a recent book by Caroline Alexander, and directed by George Butler, this documentary certainly is done well.  There were recent landscape shots and historical photos, a smooth voiced narrator (Liam Neeson) and interviews with the descendents of the original crew of 28 men from a wide variety of British social classes.  This crew set sail in 1914 from the U.K., under the leadership of the Irish born Shackleton.  Two years later, they all returned, having endured incredible hardships.  The fact that they all survived is attributable to Shackleton's leadership and determination and this film is certainly a tribute to him for that.
I can't resist films about the frozen north and was delighted to see this documentary playing at my local art film theater. Partially sponsored by a corporate giant, the production brought me close to the real raw day-by-day experience of the voyage itself.  It seems as if I became acquainted with the entire crew as they experienced the turns and reversals of fortune over and over again.  I felt the experience of their backbreaking labor when they were stranded on the ice.  I felt the cold as they set off in small boats between the floating ice on an open sea.  I saw them reach land and build shelter and survive on penguin meat.  And I felt Shakleton's frustration, as he had to choose just three of his men to search out help by hiking nonstop in sub-zero temperatures for several days. There were so many times they almost didn't make it that I found myself holding my breath with the tension even though I knew the eventual outcome. Yes, I did love this film.",1022889600,3,1615,4.759856630824372
1903574,5,B0000A7W16,"""The Endurance""--the saga of the struggle of Sir Ernest Shackleton and his crew to survive the Antarctic wastes--is more amazing than any plot Hollywood has ever devised, and every word of it is true. The closest real-life equivalent I can think of is the story of Apollo 13--and whereas that crisis lasted three days and involved three men, the story of the Endurance lasted two years and involved 28. The film footage and still photos by Frank Hurley, Shackleton's official photographer, add an eerie, you-are-there quality to the bleakly gorgeous, modern-day footage of Antarctica taken by director George Butler. (That so much of Hurley's film survived is in itself incredible.) While the courage and stamina of the crew were amazing, I also can't forget the tales of all-too-human pettiness among them. I'll always remember the snooty, aristocratic Col. Thomas Orde-Lee, who disdained rowing but eagerly bailed out his boat (rowing was for commoners, but bailing was heroic). I also can't forget Shackleton's total lack of forgiveness for mutinous ship's carpenter Chippy McNish, even after McNish repented of his rebellion and took actions which essentially saved the lives of all the crew. In showing both the grandeur and the pettiness of the human spirit--as well as the mercilessness of the perpetual Antarctic winter--""The Endurance"" is one of the greatest stories of exploration, as well as one of the best movies of 2001.",1008979200,16,1434,5.212121212121212
1903575,5,B0000A7W16,"In August 1914, the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, comprised of 27 men under the leadership of Sir Ernest Shackleton, set sail from England in the wooden ship ENDURANCE. The plan was to land a team on the Antarctic Continent, and the men to dogsled across the frozen landmass to the other side via the South Pole. However, one day's sail from the Antarctic shore, the vessel became entrapped in the ice pack, and was subsequently crushed and sunk. Shackleton and his group were stranded on the drifting floes out of contact with and beyond the ken of the rest of the world. The expedition's grueling, heroic journey back to civilization, culminating in an 800-mile voyage across a stormy, frigid ocean by Shackleton and five companions in a small, open boat, is the subject of this documentary based on the book by Caroline Alexander.
The spell-binding nature of this film is due to the masterful mix of material from several sources: archival 35mm footage, still photos and drawings from the expedition itself, narrated excerpts from diaries, radio interviews with survivors and filmed interviews with their descendents, and contemporary film footage shot along the route of the men's ordeal. One is amazed at the quality of the 35mm moving images shot by Frank Hurley, the team's photographer. What you see is not a re-enactment - it's real, and as crisp as if shot only last week instead of almost ninety years ago.
Besides being the visual narrative of an extraordinary survival story, ENDURANCE is also a show-and-tell presentation on the essence of leadership. Two years after departing England, Shackleton successfully brought all his 27 men back from the brink of extinction. Not a single member of the venture was lost. (Ironically, they arrived back in a Europe entangled in the throes of World War One, in which some of the Expedition's survivors were subsequently killed.)
For a fuller presentation of the subject in text, I would strongly recommend ENDURANCE: SHACKLETON'S INCREDIBLE VOYAGE by Alfred Lansing.",1006128000,85,2028,5.11144578313253
1903605,3,B0000A7W16,"Shackleton was no hero in my opinion.  This movie sort of tries to make him out as some kind of phenomenal leader and explorer, but the fact is, Shackleton was an idiot. His foolish endeavor cost many dogs their lives, as the dogs were eaten to help keep the crew alive after they became stranded for over a year! He left several men to fend for themselves for three months on ice floes as he and some others set out to find help.  How any of them survived the bitter cold without supplies is a miracle.  It was also fool-hardy to have undertaken such an endeavor in the first place.",1482019200,,583,4.281818181818182

1903610,5,B0000A7W16,"Excellent documentary telling of the amazing story of Ernest Shackletons disastrous Antarctic expedition in 1914.  The number of impossible hurdles these men have to overcome just to say alive would overload a Hollywood fiction film.  If it weren't all true, it would seem absurdly over-the-top.  But it WAS true, and these men had to face insane challenge after insane challenge over and over again.

The film makes great use of still photographs and even movie film taken by one of the crew.  The reinacted moments  which often really bother me in documentaries  felt seamless.  And interviews with the still-alive relatives of the men of the journey helps root us in the knowledge these were real people.  The only thing I would have wished for was a little more character depth, or exploration of Shakeltons psyche.  But even without that, this is a jam packed,  exciting documentary about an unbelievable journey.",1463097600,,918,5.053333333333334
1903611,5,B0000A7W16,"I write this review on April 24th, 2016, 100 years to the day that Shackleton and his five companions launched their bold venture to reach South Georgia in an open boat to find rescue for the rest of the Endurance company stranded on Elephant Island.  I recently returned from an incredible Aurora Expeditions voyage retracing the route of the Endurance party on the hundredth anniversary of the expedition's rescue.  The breathtaking part of this documentary for me was seeing the actual sites we visited, particularly Elephant Island and the whaling station of Stromness.

I can only add my superlatives to the numerous other five-star reviews.  The interview segments with descendants of the men of the Endurance are riveting:  Peter Wordie, son of the expedition's geologist James Wordie; Mary Crean O'Brien, daughter of the Second Mate Tom Crean; Tom McNeish, grandson of ship's carpenter Harry ""Chippy"" McNeish; John Blackborow, grandson of steward (and stowaway) Perce Blackborow; and Julian Ayer, grandson of stores manager and motor expert Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Orde-Lees.  Their insights alone in their short commentaries make this production compelling.  Most revealing is Ayer's explanation of what motivated the colonel--who refused to row, considering it infra dig--to put on a burst of sudden energy, bailing all night to save his companions in a sinking boat.  In Ayer's view, his grandfather--not well-liked on the expedition--simply wanted to be a hero.

On May 20th, I hope to see some of these descendants and others at the ""Centenary Service for the courage of Sir Ernest Shackleton CVO and his men"" at Westminster Abbey in London.  This thanksgiving service (not a memorial service--no one died on the Endurance!) takes place 100 years to the day that Shackleton, Crean and Worsley limped into Stromness and the world discovered that the men of the Endurance, given up for lost, were alive.

Also included are fascinating off-screen voice-overs from other members who were interviewed in later years about their memories of the expedition.  Most chilling:  Leonard Hussey, the expedition's meteorologist, admitting, in his own voice, that when the crew had been stranded for months on Elephant Island awaiting Shackleton's return, they began to look at each other ""without enmity"" as possible food.

The film offers much psychological insight into the men as they suffered under unimaginable stress and hardship, giving the film a ""you are there"" feeling.  The visuals, relying extensively on Frank Hurley's photographs and motion picture film of the expedition, are vivid and compelling, allowing us longer clips and material not seen in other videos.  Liam Neeson's narration is sturdy and sensitive, while never being intrusive.  There are one or two glaring errors of fact, as when Neeson states that 21 members of the expedition were left behind on Elephant Island (in fact, there were 22).

Director George Butler also did the IMAX movie on the Endurance, which is a superficial, eye-popping overview of the expedition.  This film, recruiting as it does the talents of author Caroline Alexander and the outdoor adventure expertise of the Outward Bound Schools, and of Zegrahm Expeditions, gives far more penetrating and memorable insight into what being part of this legendary expedition must have been like.",1461542400,,3340,5.327619047619048

The epic misadventure was not available in Britain except at a huge price and sending to America achieved significant savings.

1903726,5,B0000A7W16,"""Endurance"" is an excellent documentary that makes this reviewer want to re-read Alfred Lansing's book or purchase Caroline Alexander's book on which this film is based.  The harrowing 1914-16 survival story of the crew of The Endurance, a ship which was trapped and sunk in the ice on its way to the Antarctic where renown polar explorer Ernest Shackleton planned a transcontinental expedition, is expertly told in this documentary through vintage photographs, film, illustrations, survivors' radio interviews, relatives' interviews and re-enactments.  Those interviewed include Tom Crean's daughter Mary, Thomas Ordes-Lee's grandson Julian Ayer, ""Chippy"" McNish's grandson Tom, Shackleton's cousin Jonathan, among others.  The re-enactments were filmed in a way that was not intrusive at all.  With no dialogue, they blend in well with the other sources.  The film footage shot at the time as well as the photographs taken of the trapped Endurance are fascinating.

One aspect of the story which is often overlooked, glossed over, or, in this case, not mentioned at all, is the fate of the Ross Sea Party.  A group of men sailed to the other side of the continent to lay depots for Shackleton's party as they got to the final leg of their transcontinental journey.  The only sign in this documentary that this party existed is three blue triangles marked on a computerized map with an illustration of the supply ship Aurora (which had its own survival story) below.  Neither is mentioned by name.  At the end of the documentary, it is stated ""All hands were safe; not one life had been lost.""  Such was not the case for the Ross Sea Party.

As much as this reviewer enjoyed the documentary, the special features were even better.  ""The Tale of The Endurance"" is told by author Alexander who explains some of Shackleton's controversial decisions and really drives home Shackleton's ability to switch his focus from purely egotistical aims to caring only about the survival of his men.  ""In The Wake of Shackleton"" is a ""making of"" short film on the crew's experience shooting footage in the exact places Shackleton and his men were.  The fate of the small boats they brought is quite eye-opening.  Photographer Frank Hurley's (responsible for the many iconic images of the Endurance and her crew) twin daughters (always wearing the same outfits) are interviewed.  In ""Past and Present"", descendants of the Endurance crew gathered at a museum in New York City and shared their memories and thoughts on the artifacts on display.  The open boat James Caird was the main attraction, and the special features give a greater understanding on what that little whaler and the men on it went through traveling 800 miles across some of the most treacherous waters on earth to seek help on South Georgia with only the benefit of navigator Worsley's dead reckoning.  This documentary is highly recommended.",1336003200,,2895,5.08245243128964
1903727,5,B0000A7W16,"I read the book before I purchased the DVD and would recommend that to any DVD purchaser. I was captivated by the book, and was delighted to see the DVD to be just as captivating. This is an excellent film to show to young people and teenagers.

Ernest Shackleton was what we would call a free spirit today, and independent, determined man obsessed with reaching the South Pole shortly after the turn of the twentieth century. He managed to assemble a polar expedition with an utterly unresistable advertisement for hard, determined men with the caveat that survival was no guarantee. He secured the vessel Endurance and set out shortly after the outbreak of World War I with a crew of similarly independent minded individuals. His experiences on earlier failed expeditions taught him how he was to manage such a crew, and little did he know how much that experience was going to come into play.

After leaving the whaling station at South Georgia at the end of the known earth, his wooden ship stood due south toward Antarctica where it eventually encountered ice floes in the Weddell Sea. As the ship drew nearer to the continent, the ice thickened and the ship bacame ice bound and unable to move in any direction. Repeated attempts to free the ship were futile as the ship was about 100 miles from the coastline of Antarctica.

The story becomes one of a race for survival when the ship was slowly crushed in the ice and sank. Everything salvagable was carried off the ship before it sank, but what was left was pitifully little. Worse, the now ice-bound crew and captain were completely at the mercy of the ocean currents which drew them further from land and toward a very uncertain fate where the ice begins to break up. Shackelford's leadership and resolve kept the crew together and under discipline despite an aborted attempt at mutiny. Rations were soon reduced to almost exclusively seal meat. The plight of the expedition grew more and more grim.

As the inevitable edge of the ice pack was reached, the men had no choice but to take to the two boats left from the sunken Endurance. No sooner had the boats taken to the ocean when fierce storms enveloped the crew in the boats making their lives even more miserable if that was possible. Several alternate destinations were discussed, the most promising being a place where supplies had been cached, but the condition of the men and the boats demanded making landfall at the nearest possible place. That turned out to be Elephant Island, a rocky outcrop on the edge of the Weddell Sea with no vegetation of any kind. Now a real sense of desperation set in among the crew that was already malnourished and weakened physically. Shackelton was determined to save his crew at any cost.

One of the boats was rigged for open ocean navigation and Shackelton and three others set out for New Georgia several hundred miles away across what has to be the worst stretch of ocean anyone could imagine. Howling gales and mountainous waves made the voyage one of complete misery, yet miraculously, the boat reached South Georgia. Imagine a pitiful group of men if there ever was one, and then imagine the realization that they had landed on the wrong side of the island from the whaling station and faced a trek over a 10,000 foot mountain range to get there. Shackelton left two of the men behind and left with one other to make what has to be one of the most remarkable climbs of all time. Shackelton and his companion crossed the mountains and staggered into the whaling station to safety.

Now Shackelton had to organize a rescue effort for not only his remaining crew on Elephant Island, but his other two men on the other side of New Georgia. All this took time, but he rescued the two first, the took a tug boat to Elephant Island to rescue any survivors. In one of the epic survival tales of all time, he found all of his crew still alive and rescued them.

Liam Neeson could not have been a better choice to narrate this film which featured several movie clips and many still photos of the expedition. One can hardly fathom the hardships these men endured compared to any experieces the the viewers might remotely have experienced themselves. This is truly a survival tale for the times and the fact that is is true only makes it more remarkable. The DVD is excellent in all respects and deserves high praise.

You also see his leadership in the details of how, low on warm, water-proof sleeping bags, he rigged the selection process so that his men got all of the good sleeping bags.  This is remarkable and shows how concerned he was for their survival.

1903741,5,B0000A7W16,"...to steal a line from Herodotus or some such ancient sage.

An ad appeared in the London Times in 1913:

""Men wanted for hazardous journey.  Small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful.  Honour and recognition in case of success.  Ernest Shackleton.""

5000 men applied.  27 were selected, and thus was born the Antarctic expedition led by one of the great leadership models of any age, Irishman Sir Ernest Shackleton.  In fact, the expedition was slated to leave just as the Great War broke out.  Shackleton offered himself and his men to the war effort but was instructed to be about his voyage to the south.  And so they took off on their ship, The Endurance, skippered by Captain Worsely.  This was quite a crew; they turned around to pick up the carpenter's cat when it fell overboard.

Once they arrived in the Antarctic area, they started working their icebreaker ship through the floes, but ended up getting stuck.  As the ice locked them in and attempts to free themselves failed, Shackleton simply and calmly told his men that they'd have to winter there.  And so they did.  Shackleton was well aware of other ships in similar conditions where the crews had descended into madness.  He scheduled work projects, periods of reward and entertainment, kept an eye on morale and quickly dealt with behaviors that threatened team integrity.  He worked alongside his men, and reminded them that they were more important than the expedition.  Despite months of fighting the battering, shifting ice, the crew eventually lost The Endurance.  They abandoned ship, and found themselves homeless on the ice.  At that point, Shackleton told the men that they were simply now going home.

The rest and best parts of the story are the various scenes as Shackleton manages himself and his men in the efforts to get home.

This documentary benefits from the beautiful narrative skills of actor Liam Neeson in his native Irish accent.  The footage, re-enactments and still shots support the story without distracting from it.  Numerous experts and survivors' descendants offer their contributions to the film.

Shackleton was a great leader of men, but struggled with things like being a husband.  He recognized his inability to submit to a standard family life.  He was just wired differently.  He sought and - in the end - received public greatness.  Shackleton's greatest contribution may be in what he teaches us about managing other people.",1202256000,3,2491,5.007317073170731

They never got started. Six weeks later and only 100 miles from their starting point their ship ground to a halt in the endless pack ice. Eventually the ice crushed, splintered and sank The Endurance. Their saga over the next two years has proved to be one of the most remarkable and best documented stories of human survival, bravery, and leadership ever. After drifting clockwise for 10 months and 1300 miles on the massive, melting ice sheet towards open sea, the crew abandoned their doomed vessel, boarded their life boats, then took six months to find its way to Elephant Island. Shackleton and six of his crew then navigated a 22-foot lifeboat 800 miles in 17 days back to South Georgia Island. After several failed attempts, he finally returned to Elephant Island and rescued his stranded crew. Not one crew member was lost. Using ship logs, crew diaries, original photography (including stills and motion pictures by the ship photographer), interviews with descendants of the crew, and assorted historical archives, this film documents ""the most successful failure"" ever.

That was the ad run by explorer Sir Earnest Shackleton in order to man his ship, The Endurance, for an historic expedition across Antarctica in 1914-16.

I was attracted to this documentary by the cover on the DVD, which is an engaging and eerie photograph of the ship, Endurance, frozen in the ice with the men grouped in front of it. The documentary turned out to be even more engaging and eerie. I'm not a big fan of documentaries, but this one enthralled me. I still can't get over the fact that this story really happened, or that Shackleton was the leader that he was.

As is pointed out in the documentary, and by Caroline Alexander - the author of the book on which it is based - Shackleton had his finger on the pulse of each of his 27 men to such a degree that he could pull each one back from the brink of depression or despair before he went over the edge. No polar expedition that had ever run amuck before theirs had ever survived; and in most cases, insanity had preceded death. So when Shackleton realized he wasn't going to make it across Antarctica, he changed his goal to that of saving all his men. And, miraculously, he accomplished it - he didn't lose one.

Every expert says that every leg of their journey back was impossible; yet they did it. And even though the drama with Kenneth Branagh (Shackleton - The Greatest Survival Story Of All Time) is good, it doesn't do as much justice to the real story as this documentary by George Bulter.

Liam Neeson does an excellent job narrating. Included in the film are the extraordinary photographs of expedition photographer Frank Hurley, who performed a major miracle just saving his glass negatives. The extra features are as engrossing as the movie itself, especially comments made by author Caroline Alexander.

The ship was well-named: Endurance. The men endured for 635 days under the most horrendous conditions imaginable, and survived to tell the greatest tale ever. There is even a mystery involved in how Shackleton and two of his men made the last leg of their journey across a mountain range with the help of a ""fourth man,"" which they believed was an angel. It is clear that God was with these men throughout.

This is one documentary, one story and one man you'll never forget.

1903760,4,B0000A7W16,"The year is 1915 and you are headed toward the South Atlantic Ocean from England. Your mission is projected to last one to two years and you may never return. You will be forced to deal with mother nature in a way you have never dealt before. Frigid temperatures, biting wind, and limited food supply will be your way of life for many months to come.

This sounds like the setup to a fictional novel, but it isn't. It's the real- life experience of those who sailed aboard The Endurance with Captain Ernest Shackleton and it's the subject of this interesting documentary. This film takes the viewer aboard the ship ""Endurance"" as it sets sail from its native England toward the unexplored lands in the Antarctic continent.

Director George Butler spends most of this documentary talking about Shackleton himself and the circumstances surrounding his 1915 expedition to Antarctica. Among the many things that make this documentary entertaining is the fact that there is actual filmed footage taken of the ship and its crew of men and dogs during the course of the trip. You get to see the ship stuck in icy waters; the men trying to stay warm in makeshift tents; the dogs keeping the men company; and the dismal living conditions in the world's harshest climate.

Mixed in with the actual filmed portions of the documentary are modern- day scenes from this same part of the world, along with an occasional drawing. Frank Hurley (the crew member who filmed the excursion) ran out of film at some point and this is where the drawings have to take over. Also, to keep the viewer focused on the routes the crew followed and what happened where, the documentary includes maps from time to time, letting you see the approximate path that the ship and its crew followed for more than two years as they tried to reach the South Pole, only to come up short in the end.

This documentary is entertaining, educational, and memorable for the courage of the crew and its leader, Ernest Shackleton. Sir Shackleton was an excellent leader and he was able to keep the morale high even when the chances for survival looked very bleak. Most importantly, he led his entire crew to safety in the end, without a single casualty among them.

Overall, ""The Endurance"" is a very good, educational documentary about this failed expedition to the most southerly point on the planet. Shackleton didn't reach his goal, but he dared to dream and he kept trying until the very end. His courage and leadership skills serve as an inspirational to everyone.",1118880000,3,2523,4.751141552511416

The IMAX is a good overall general synopsis of the story but leaves out the more interesting details and hardships that the Shackleton team endured, during their 2-year expedition against the elements.  The BBC TV-series was good but takes too many ""artistic liberties"".  This version and the NOVA one are very similar but distinct enough to warrant watching them both.

The criticism by one reviewer that this particular version lacked interest because it didn't use dramatized re-creations to depict the adventurer is like saying Ken Burn's ""Civil War"" series was boring because it didn't have any motion picture footage.  Any one who has seen that series knows how even a photograph or painting, backed by dramatic readings of letters and battle accounts, along with exquisite modern and period background music, pulled you right into that era and made you hungry to know more.

The story is captivating enough and the narrative by Liam Neeson is just as riveting as the David Ogden-Stier version by Nova.  They are both excellently done and complement one another.  You can't make a comparison.  This one gets a hearty thumbs-up from me.",1112659200,13,1276,5.0669856459330145

For decades I have had most of the published and filmed material on Shackleton, Scott and others; several recordings of Ralph Vaughan-Williams' 'Sinfonia Antarctica' as well as John Mill's film portrayal of 'Scott of the Antarctic'- for which Vaughan-Williams composed the musical score and later developed it into that Symphony.

This fall I bought the Kenneth Branagh 3 disc set -( first rate 'extra' materials-) as well as the earlier 'The Last Place on Earth'- really first rate on the 'Race' to the Pole. The liam Nesson I saw several time on the trip and will surely be addng it to my collection.

Where I need help is on a version of 'Shackelton' which I recorded in the 1980s off-air from Arts and Entertainment in Betamax format  - with no end of commercial interuptionson. I think it was a BBC production originally- and it really does well on the trip from Elephant Island to South Georgia. The tape is still good, but for some reason,I have lost the end and the credits. What I need to know is whether any of you 'Antarctic ' specialists can tell me details, whether it is or was available on VHS or DVD and where I can get hold of it. Amazon's listings, although fairly comprehensive, have left me in a white-out as to all the available materials. So please give me the best of your research and knowledge.

1903766,5,B0000A7W16,"'The Endurance' is a documentary originally aired as a 'Nova' special, and is one of the most amazing documentaries on any subject that I have ever seen. In the summer of 1914 Ernest Shackleton and his crew set sail on the 'Endurance' for Antarctica, with the goal of being the first expedition to cross the Antarctic continent. After becoming ensnared in ice their ship slowly disintegrated, and forced the survivors onto land, and eventually into their small wooden lifeboats in an attempt to make a perilous voyage back to civilization.
The crew endured for 635 days and nights without real shelter or sufficient rations, frequently eating seal blubber and even their beloved dogs. As an animal lover, I came to realize the true depths of their situation when they had to shoot their cat and dogs, and ultimately eat some of their true canine friends.
The story is one of tremendous hubris and heroism all wrapped up into one larger than life explorer. Shackleton's true gift was not in being a great explorer, but in being able to largely control the morale of the crew and provide leadership when it was most critical. Only thanks to that leadership did every man on the expedition survive.
The documentary itself is a brilliant mix of the film shot by expedition photographer Frank Hurley (including a lot of motion picture film) and modern film of the sites in question, along with a bit of reenactment footage of recreated lifeboats identical to the originals. The work is seamless, deeply moving, and will give anyone a new appreciation for the powers of ice and the human spirit.
In addition to the actual documentary the disc has several choice extras including a director's commentary track, interviews with children of survivors, and, best of all, a documentary on the making of the documentary, which I found absolutely fascinating. The most amazing thing that was revealed in the 'making of' documentary was the fate of the duplicate lifeboats, which under the control of the modern seamen ultimately sank in heavy seas, but seas far less than Shackleton encountered.
This is in every way a spectacular production, and I would recommend it highly to anyone. You will never forget this film.",1079049600,55,2205,4.93010752688172
1903767,5,B0000A7W16,Outstanding movie/outrageous price for a VHS version of a movie available for $17 as a DVD.  This has rip-off written all over it!!,1076284800,2,131,4.695652173913044
1903768,5,B0000A7W16,"The fate of Ernest Shackleton's Antarctic expedition is so unbelievable that in some ways many people are likely to shunt the memory of it into more remote corners of history than it deserves.  Caroline Alexander's book of the same title rekindled interest in this adventure and gave it the spotlight that it deserved.  George Butler's visual adaptation of Alexander's book is equally worthy.
By any standard, the ordeal of Shackleton and his crew gives vivid illustration of true leadership, perservance and yes, endurance.  Their goal of crossing the Antarctic from coast to coast was shattered before they ever landed on the continent.  The awareness of that failure might have doomed most men to quick death, however the crew of the Endurance found ways to survive the more than two years that ensued from the day their ship became trapped in pack ice, until they were rescued from a frigid and harsh island.  That these men were able to survive under the conditions that beset them is a tribute to each of them and the way the worked together from Shackleton on down.
The motion picture film and still photographs taken by Frank Hurley, the expedition photographer, make this documentary even more engrossing.  These images are augmented by family interviews and dramatic recreations that lend poignancy to this epic.  From start to finish this is a film that will keep you engrossed!  So engrossing that you might find yourself adding another log to the fire or going to check the thermostat even in the warmest of weather.",1072396800,5,1529,4.9453125
1903769,5,B0000A7W16,"First of all, if you've read the book, either Lansing's or Alexander's, this is a must purchase.  It is so haunting to see The Endurance floating, trapped in ice.
I really like the mix of modern and actual footage.  I think we all have this image of the south pole being this barren, desolate place.  It's educating seeing penguins, seals, even shrubbery abound.  There is some footage of icebergs that is simply amazing.  Beautiful shades of blue you've never seen before.
I love reading non fiction books that have some sort of video companion to it (be it Hollywood movie or something you'd find on History Channel).  This is probably the best one two punch I've come across as far as a great book and a great visual aide.
What a breed of men to endure such a thing.  Excellent.  Excellent.  Excellent.",1072051200,4,805,4.612676056338028

1903771,5,B0000A7W16,"This is an exemplary documentary, based upon author Caroline Alexander's critically acclaimed, best selling book of the doomed 1914 Antarctic expedition led by Sir Edward Shackleton. Effectively narrated by Liam Neeson, the film tells the story of this star-crossed expedition which set sail upon the ironically named ship, ""The Endurance"".  Shackleton and his crew set out to attempt the first expedition across the vast, still uncharted, icy regions of the Antarctic continent.

Unfortunately, the ship became locked in an icy vise created by polar floes not long after it set sail, which eventually encased and crushed the ship it held in its grasp. This forced the crew out on the ice to survive an  adventure that was to last them over a year and a half. Only the courage and determination of Shackleton and his crew enabled them all to survive their harrowing experience, escaping the icy death that was the expected outcome of their dire situation.

Told through the incorporation and use of expedition photographer Frank Hurley's archival silent film footage and stills, which miraculously survived, as well as modern day film and photographs, a rich in situ backdrop is provided for this gripping story of survival. The film is also augmented by  interviews with elderly relatives of the survivors. The makers of this documentary also ground the story in the historical context of the day, enriching this story further.  All in all, this is an exemplary documentary and one which those who are interested in explorations will enjoy, as will those who enjoy films in which the human spirit triumphs.",1070755200,10,1607,5.114503816793893
1903772,5,B0000A7W16,"When I saw The Endurance, I had no knowledge of Shackleton's expidition. The documentary not only held my interest, but did a superb job of conveying the thoughts and experiences of the crew with their journal readings and footage.
My unfamiliarity with the story of The Endurance may have caused the documentary to have a bigger impact with me than it otherwise might have. If you are unfamiliar with this story, I would encourage you to see this before doing anything else. What you learn will surprise you.",1070064000,,509,4.795454545454546

1903774,5,B0000A7W16,"Brilliantly constructed, narrated and photographed and supplemented by truly astonishing black and white photos by Mr Hurley, this is one of the most moving tales of survival ever told occurring as it does at the time of the carnage of World War One that was, unbeknown to them,  engulfing the world.  It is also in the context of knowing that these men (and, for quite a while, a cat) had none of the technology or sophisticated equipment which is commonplace now.  The final voyage of a few of them in a row boat across the Southern Ocean is unbelievable, but is almost capped by their final race by foot across an island to their Norwegian saviours.  It is the most telling example of a leader refusing to give up on his men I have ever encountered.  Mr Shackleton gave new meaning to ""selfless"" and to ""leadership"".  If you missed this wonderful film at your local IMAX, then buy this DVD.",1067299200,,893,4.55
1903775,4,B0000A7W16,"THE ENDURANCE (Columbia Tristar) brings to vivid life Ernest Shackleton's nightmarish Antarctic expedition (1914-1916). Expedition photographer Frank Hurley's startling movie and still pictures, shot under the most extreme, unfavorable conditions, show Shackleton's ship, the ironically named Endurance, trapped in a blizzard and then jammed in an expanding ice pack.  The vice grip of the ice relentlessly squeezes the Endurance until it cracks like a walnut and the 27 crewmen move onto the ice with salvaged items. And then the real terror begins. It was truly Providential that all the men lived to tell this fantastic survival story.  This is a truly mesmerizing documentary and is highly recommended.",1064361600,11,706,5.588785046728972

1903777,5,B0000A7W16,"Oh! the age of discovery.  Where did it go to?  What happened to men of long ago who were adventurers.  The Endurance is the name of Earnest Shackleton's vessel.  As it turned out,  the name would be proven true to significant proportions.  This story will teach about the determination of the human spirit.  In order for this to be so, it starts with a collection of persons who were extremely skilled in all facets of sea travel.  Including the initial construction of seaworthy boats, navigating course direction in adverse conditions, and maintaining a hierarchy of organizational structure.  By doing so a platform was put in to place to acheive great things.  This story is about acheiving great things.
I like the way the dvd is done documetary style.  For most of us, this will be the first time we have encountered this compelling story.  It is fitting that as we do we see the actual faces of the persons behind it.
The story deserves to be told and to be heard.",1062806400,3,972,4.619883040935672
7996098,5,B0000A7W16,"Nature is very non plus about your chances, Nature is indifferent to the passing or for want of a better more descriptive word the dying of one or many persons. It is Nature that this film very eloquently defines and it is the harshest adversary. The Endurance which at the start of the voyage was a Stoudt, even formidable vessel that appeared to have been reinforced and was, in fact, a  very good ship. The narrative and subsequent events that unfold when ""Endurance"" becomes stuck in a death-like grip is one of the more agonizing time periods that we visit. This film leaves nothing as it were to chance other than the very real and desperate struggle to survive. This film is that a well-told narrative that is believable. I wish to emphasize that this was a terrible exercise in survival however to the credit of the Men of this ill-fated voyage this is indeed a true and descriptive text. The photography is an important element as it captures much of the reality by which these men lived from day to day, never more than a few feet from disaster. They appeared almost as it was emaciated with little more than the leadership from which the heroic accomplishment of getting every single man back alive was really a very real heroic challenge. This would be the film to view as both narrative and photography don't lie as there is no makeup and the suffering is visible. The faces of the persons look different, more and more so, so much so that they are hard to recognize. This is a well-told narrative that I favor, however it is still a story that makes these times a real interest. The World was at war and yet the Admiralty wished great success with the ill-fated journey of an important predecessor used as a gauge to which to measure against. It is very useful to know this story and much about what went before and even more so what came after.",1525046400,,1859,4.516320474777448
