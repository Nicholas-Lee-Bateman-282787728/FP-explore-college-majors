4653273,1,B005CHE59S,"This review is more for the seller than the disc itself since I am unable to view the disc. Seller sent me a region B disc. Region B is for Europe and US BD players will not play them. Nowhere in the description does it say that this is region B. Being as the seller is in the US, I assumed it was a US version. After contact the seller by email, I receive a response saying that the purchase price MINUS the shipping and handling can be refunded for region errors on their part. So I am still out the S/H for a disc that I cannot watch.

Buy from someone else.",1354752000,23,561,3.9646017699115044
4653274,5,B005CHE59S,This is the best film of the TT I have ever seen. I liked it so much i actually bought a copy! now what dose that say in this day and age! That's how bloody good this film is!,1349827200,,175,3.5128205128205128
4653275,4,B005CHE59S,This is a great movie would have gave it five stars if the blu ray wasn't region specific and would play in my bluray player was forced to watch it on my laptop but still a great movie,1341100800,11,184,3.8684210526315788
4653276,5,B005CHE59S,"I have an Oppo player that plays any region disc.
I wanted to see what my 3d tv could do with the Isle of Man.
Most discs here are just recaps.

This is a documentary.

I was so impressed, and need I say now I am a Guy Martin fan!
This is indepth, and does discuss the crashes that occur every year, sad but real.
If you can play a redion 2 3D disc, this is a must have!",1432080000,,370,3.670886075949367

4653278,5,B005CHE59S,"It's not very often that a movie about racing entertains like this. It is simply the best racing documentary I've ever seen. The quality of footage is insightful and breathtaking. The human stories of why these riders risk what they do, and the wives and mothers, along with race owners and the mechanics that make the speed of these machines is captured in a heart warming and touching way. I started riding a year ago and this movie evokes everything that it means a feels to ride a bike. prospective all the thoughts that go through your mind It's a type of movie you will watch over and over again. The Irish, English accents are thick, subtitles is highly recommended, at least the first time through!  I had heard about the TT races, I now realize the challenge that it is. Many of the best riders in Motor GP, marvel at what these riders do. There is a still shot in the movie of a church with its bells ringing and the still of a Sunday morning being broken with riders speeding around brick walls at top speed.
Race fan or not you will love this movie, it's a must see.",1431216000,,1078,4.36318407960199

4653281,5,B005CHE59S,excellent native 3d documentary shot in the uk.  It is about motorcycle racing and it should have come out here in the u.s. But of course we didn't get it.  It's region b I think. I have a all region 3d blu ray player so to me it doesn't matter what region it is.  This has lots of great shots of people on motorcyles racing around. And they are engaged in a very dangerous race.  The blu ray looks outstanding and has a boring flat 2d version. (as compared to the exciting 3d version visually).  This is worth owning.  Just check out the region before you buy it.  The blu rays picture is outstanding either way you watch it.  But 3d fans should want this one in their collection for sure.,1420156800,,690,4.213740458015267

4653288,5,B005CHE59S,"I actually bought a second copy of this. If your a motorcycle racing fan or rider. Watch this.

Guy Martin is a character and this adds to the story of the TT, the racing is epic and the documentary covers a lot of angles.

4653289,5,B005CHE59S,"I am something of a motorcycle fan and enthusiast, so thoroughly enjoyed this awesome movie.

But, to my surprise, my wife and my eldest daughter both really enjoyed this movie and the colorful characters that are driven to take part in one of the most exciting and dangerous motorsports races in the world.

Great behind-the scenes look at the more-authentic, less-glamorous side of motorsports and what it takes to risk it all for nothing more than one's name on a plaque.

Why this hasn't been picked-up for screenings and distribution here in the USA is anyone's guess.",1401667200,3,573,4.88659793814433

4653292,1,B005CHE59S,"Why? because the DVD was coded for part of Europe, Africa and Pakistan. I live in Virginia. These were Christmas gifts. One is still here in Virginia the other is in South Carolina. Still not Europe, Africa, or Pakistan.

4653295,5,B005CHE59S,"If you love motorcycles, going insanely fast, and all the quirky people who race these machines, this is a MUST WATCH.

Focusing on the Isle of Man TT (Tourist Trophy) of 2010, Closer to the Edge partly documents the race as a historic staple in motorcycle racing. A 100+ year history which includes being a part of MotoGP. Although it may be quite unknown to Americans, the TT is one of the greatest showcases of modern (and vintage) motorcycle racing. As a time trial, this race requires the rider to complete multiple laps of the 37.75 mile mountain course, which consists of real street roads on the Isle of Man. Hundreds have died while racing, and many others have injured themselves attempting to master the course, which is full twisting, winding turns with rises and drops in elevation. Fans stand inches from the roads which the racers ride close to 200 mph on, and rock walls, houses and telephone poles add to the risk factor of this historic venue.

Featuring riders such as John McGuinness and Guy Martin, this film documents the lives of TT riders, some who have lived in the spot light, and others who have not. A thrilling film with great audio/video to keep you on the edge of your seat. Guy Martin is a real life character, who's personality adds a human element to a sport and racing event that seems all too unreal.

Highly recommend! Put it in, turn up the volume and enjoy.

4653296,5,B005CHE59S,"Great video, read other reviews for info. If you're in the USA and don't have a European standard blu-ray player you can still watch the movie. Blu-ray package comes with a PAL standard-def DVD as well as the blu-ray disk. PAL dvd won't play in your Blu-ray or DVD player, but played great in the DVD drive on my Windows 7 computer in Windows Media Player. If you have a computer with HDMI video output, you're in business for your big flatscreen TV as well.",1381190400,7,458,4.4
4653297,5,B005CHE59S,Did the 2013 Isle Of Man. If you want to know what it is really like then watch this. A great showing of the racers the track and the Isle Of Man. Excellent.,1373587200,2,157,3.787878787878788
4653298,5,B005CHE59S,"Originally shot in 3D, ""Closer to the Edge"" chronicles the Isle of Man TT (Tourist Trophy) race in 2010, one of the world's most famous motorcycle races. I watched the film in the regular 2D version, but could feel the thrills (and dangers) of the incredible race.

With the average speed that well exceeds 120 mph, the motorbike race, annually held on closed public roads in the Isle of Man, is nothing short of exciting and dangerous. In its long history that spans more than 100 years, about 240 riders lost their lives. With stunning visuals, the documentary conveys the sense of speed and danger, the risk the racers had to take to win the race. One win is something to be proud of, and there is a good reason for that.

What is more impressive about the film is the passion of the racers risking their lives for the race. The film focuses the life of a racer and mechanic Guy Martin, who is yet to win the race. Amiable and outspoken, he is a real maverick. Will he finally win the race? The result is something unexpected and dramatic.

First-time director Richard De Aragues did an excellent job of making a fascinating documentary that even those who are not particularly interested in the motor sports will enjoy and learn a few things about life from.",1370131200,8,1262,4.5506607929515415

After a discussion with the manufacturer, I have learned that the only way I can now view it would be to purchase a DVD decoder, at an additional expense.
