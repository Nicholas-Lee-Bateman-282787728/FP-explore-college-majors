6268252,5,B00IK6ZK38,"I was not sure if I had seen the older version or not.  I had not, or this was completely different.  Once I started, I just could not stop.

Many health aids are rehashes of commonly known facts; not this - it was new information I had not seen before this viewing.

You owe yourself the experience of seeing what has been discovered.  Using the information will require dedication, but the rewards could be fantastic.",1404000000,17,419,4.533333333333333
6268253,5,B00IK6ZK38,"The Living Matrix is definitely worth watching.  I have recommended it to family and friends.  I have severe allergies, so I have come to understand, through personal experience, much of what is spoken of in this film.  However, viewing something that validates and speaks to individual journey, struggle, and discovery, is both empowering and exciting for what lies on the horizon in relation to scientific evidence, wellness and the connection between mind, body, and soul to the immediate environment~",1403654400,12,504,5.3544303797468356
6268254,5,B00IK6ZK38,I know and respect most of the speakers so this was a great compilation of information.  The only downside was that it seemed a little sales-y about NES,1480636800,,152,4.428571428571429

6268259,2,B00IK6ZK38,"Didn't get any real data on the how or why these purported healing techniques work. Then I realized... it's an infomercial for NES, the company that made the video. Quite disappointing!",1470096000,,185,5.0
6268260,5,B00IK6ZK38,Very good DVD.  I bought it to learn more about Dr. Eric Pearl and was amazed at the story surrounding the healing shown on this DVD.  It is very thought provoking and opens the door for incredible healing possibilities.  Watch with an open mind and you will learn.  I didn't feel like they were trying to sell anything - just open up other healing avenues for one to pursue.  There are a lot of amazing healers out there that are not involved in conventional health care.  And there are a lot of amazing people who have experienced very powerful healings.,1468972800,4,556,4.51

6268268,1,B00IK6ZK38,"Near as I can tell, it's a commercial.",1448668800,2,38,3.875
6268269,5,B00IK6ZK38,"I love this video.  As a practitioner of Reconnective Healing, learned from Dr. Eric Pearl, I can speak from experience on the power of Reconnective Healing.  It is amazing!  To see the little boy in this film be able to walk, climb, go up and down stairs, open his hands and give his parents hugs is very moving.

While I am not against western medicine by any means, I know there are more things that can be helped by the alternatives shown in this film.  I think as science evolves, we will understand more about epigenetics and what we can do to create wellness in our lives.

I tell everyone I know to watch this film and decide for themselves on what is possible in healing.  We are just scratching the surface of what we know and what is possible!  I really enjoyed this and will watch it again.",1448150400,2,802,4.3355704697986575

6268271,5,B00IK6ZK38,This movie is a remarkable movie demonstrating the Mind body connection and the body's extraordinary ability to heal itself.  This is vital information for every human on the planet.  Riveting.,1447027200,,193,5.4

6268276,5,B00IK6ZK38,I really loved this movie. It has so much information in it that is so interesting you will be glued to the screen as I was. Anyone who is interested in Quantum should definitely see this movie. Very highly recommended.,1437955200,,219,4.5
6268277,5,B00IK6ZK38,"A friend gave me this DVD, and when I first started the movie, I was VERY turned off. I too thought it was going to be an infomercial and the first guy speaking did not feel authentic to me--my perception. HOWEVER, once things got going, it really got my attention. Bruce Lipton and Lynn McTaggart are wonderful (as are others) and the information presented is essential to understanding the body's health--or lack thereof.

There is so much more to healing than what we have been programmed and socialized to believe and this movie is a fabulous confirmation of that. As a professional in the healing arts, I recommend this move often to my clients to help them break out of the old paradigms and shift their beliefs about what is possible for them. A couple of other favorites are The Shift wit Wayne Dyer (get the deluxe 2-disc set) and the movie based on the Louise Hay classic, You Can Heal Your Life.

I didn't really want to watch The Living Matrix at first, but I am very glad I did. It presents many research results and firsthand accounts of what would typically be called ""miracles."" And yet, once you understand what is really going on, these miracles are there waiting to happen at an any time. It simply requires we look at the situation with new eyes and be open to allowing on a much deeper and more expansive level.

Definitely worth watching--multiple times.",1434844800,13,1376,4.608163265306122
6268278,1,B00IK6ZK38,"I agree with the other reviewer who gave it a 1 out of 5. The video is mostly an advertisement for their ""product.""

Although it offers an interesting theory, it's claims are questionable.

Best to wait for when the video is offered for free.  It is not worth paying for.",1434672000,,271,4.38
6268279,1,B00IK6ZK38,"Warning: Don't waist your $ or time watching, this is a one hour and 20 minute infomercial for NES (Nutri-Energetics Systems) for profit pseudo-science hack ""institute"".  (I bet most of the other reviews here were paid plants for the scamers behind this  ""movie"".)
NES claim is that there is a ""human electrodynamics body-field"" that they've been able to map with their incredible technology. Just pay $69.95
and put your hand on something that looks like a mouse with tin-foil attached. The system will ""read your body-field and compare it to the optimum human body-field, which is encoded in the software"".
And if your ""human body-field"" isn't optimum? They sell ""NES Infoceuticals"" (small bottles of water) for $18.95.
This video was a waist of my $ I will see about getting a refund through amazon, don't make the same mistake!!",1433635200,14,832,4.9784172661870505

6268282,5,B00IK6ZK38,Love it X 3!!!! I have watched this film 4 times already and continue to get different info from it each time. Great information on how healing works scientifically,1428537600,5,164,4.689655172413793
6268283,4,B00IK6ZK38,"I'm not sure I totally understand what The Living Matrix is all about, but I am sure the medical community is not the answer to good health.  I believe they have a place for broken legs, etc., but I believe the big Pharma dictates to the medical profession and the bottom line is PROFIT.  I am doing more research on this matter, there has to be something better than our physicians being our God.",1428537600,7,397,4.351351351351352
6268284,5,B00IK6ZK38,The movie was mind expanding I loved it.  I didn't love that as a prime member I had to pay $4 to rent it and was only allowed to view once.,1426723200,4,140,3.5161290322580645
6268285,5,B00IK6ZK38,"I have always struggled with spirituality. This movie totally changed my thinking. If you are considering some form of holistic therapy this is a good way to understand how it works in a scientific way, it is not all hocus pocus.

6268289,5,B00IK6ZK38,"This is need-to-know info. There are people suffering worldwide who are convinced that they have to look outside themselves for relief. This video sheds light on the truth of our power to heal ourselves -- though for now most will still need help! It lets humanity know that there are means for true physical healing that are non-invasive, painless and powerful. But not covered by insurance which need to change, but that's a topic for another video.",1418083200,7,451,4.87012987012987

8642957,2,B00IK6ZK38,"The subject is a worthy one. I wish it were conveyed more effectively. I forced myself to watch to the end because I wanted to hear about the ideas, but the production values made this documentary hard to watch. Much of it is a series of talking heads with distracting, nonstop music in the background. It would be improved by simply removing the music behind the interviews.",1526342400,,375,4.611940298507463
8642958,5,B00IK6ZK38,"If you ever wondered what could come of the mess the medical profession, pharmaceutical and health insurance control over us might bring, THIS COULD BE OUR EVOLUTION REVOLUTION. This movie speaks about the intelligence of the energy fields around and through our bodies and how they control the cells and systems of the body. And what controls those? WE DO. What and how we THINK and FEEL controls the energies of our own fields. When we change our thoughts we change these energy fields which then effect every system of our bodies. HEALING is possible for others and ourselves and speaks to a time that is happening not in the future, but right now, to our neighbors, friends and communities. Self-care brings on a whole new depth.  Taking the power away from the doctors of pills is happening. Yes, we need them for surgeries and the like, but we need ourselves to take control of ourselves on so many levels. We have much more power than we realized, ever taught and was taught to our conventional doctors. May you find this as hopeful and invigorating as I did.",1504915200,3,1066,4.670212765957447

8642960,4,B00IK6ZK38,"I give this wonderful documentary 4 1/2 stars. It puts forth the concepts that we are not bound by our skin, that we are each surrounded by an electromagnetic field that can be used in healing, and that we are made of ""information,"" which is not a brand-new concept, yet I think they did a very good job of providing an actual epiphany to the open-minded viewer. Beautiful.",1488326400,2,373,4.5
