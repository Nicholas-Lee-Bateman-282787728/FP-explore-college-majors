3737857,4,B001P42YC2,It takes a while for the full scope of the mother - son relationship to open up and for the roles of the older brother and father to fill in. I will definitely watch this a few more times to see if I understand it. I did think some of the content was unnecessarily extreme and overdone. By that I mean the boy's vandalism was excessive and not very realistic in consequences.,1416009600,2,375,4.222222222222222
