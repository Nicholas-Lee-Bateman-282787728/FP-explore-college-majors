777225,5,6304087977,"I saw the review above and thought that I should offer another opinion to anyone thinking of buying this video.  I felt that the 1995 version was extremely shallow and the characters not faithfully suited to Austen's intended personalities at all.  This version's Anne shows extremely well the reactions and feelings of a mature woman who is remembering a distant past.  She remembers more and more as the story continues just how afflicted she has been and how lowly she has felt over the previous years.  She tries to keep her feelings in check but they slowly overwhelm her.  I found this version very touching despite the 1971 production.  The Anne of the 1995 version seems to be always pouting.  Her unmarried sister is shown more as being rude and apt to throwing tantrums even though Austen protrayed her as indifferent, selfish and conceited.  That is just the beginning of the incorrect portrayals of Austen's characters in the 1995 version.  If you loved the novel, see this movie.",1001894400,86,992,4.857142857142857
777226,2,6304087977,"Having just watched this version for the first time, compared to the 1995 adaptation it is quite tedious and plain. Although it is more faithful to the novel than the 1995 film, it lacks passion & fails to portray the pain and sufferable constantcy of the love between Anne & Wentworth that exists after being reunitied after eight and a half years of separation as deeply as that which is emphatically displayed by Hinds & Root. The acting was on the whole rather bland, however I did enjoy the character portrayal of Mary in this film slightly more than the 1995 version. Overall though the actors do not fit the parts as well as they do in the 95' version...Anne looked more aged even though she was beautiful still & seems less affected in emotion by the arrival of Wentworth then Austen portrays...Marshall is good but depicts a more sincere rather than passionate and intimate Capt. Wentworth. This version is far too plain and less romantic then Jane Austen's novel ought to be.",997401600,17,985,4.699421965317919
777227,2,6304087977,"First of all let me say that I was really looking forward to seeing this version. I adore the 1995 one with Hinds and Root, think it's marvelous and was hoping for more of the same. In comparison this was like the high school (and not terribly talented one) freshman class play. Bryan Marshall was good as Wentworth, but Ann Firbank was inexcusably wooden as Anne. Not to mention her wig was horrendous. It made her so top heavy I kept expecting her to fall over! The set was stagey, but given the year of the production I more or less expected that. Just not up to scratch.
They get two stars for having completed the production but not for much else.",995328000,7,652,4.352459016393443
777228,3,6304087977,"I found this version to be too stylized to suit my taste. Anne looked at least 10 years older than the book description, and unlike the book, she walked around like a queen the whole time with a ""clever"" grin and gleam in her eye. This became tiresome as I sat through the whole thing, because a) the actress didn't bother to ACT (hello!) and b) it made everything that happened less credible. In the book, she is unhappy and dejected (rejected by her father and sister) and grows into herself by the end.  But here, she acts like she's queen of the manor ... after she's unwelcome in her own house??!! And the man she wants completely ignores her??!! Come on!!",994809600,20,661,4.418032786885246
777229,1,6304087977,"I bought this because I couldn't get enough of the Amanda Root version- hoped it would be of the same ilk but it was pure tedium.  It's faithful to the book but there is no depth of feeling, no spark, no charisma, no chemistry- terrible.  Don't waste your money!",991526400,5,262,4.326530612244898
777230,3,6304087977,"I enjoyed the 1995 version better, though this one is faithful to the book.  ""Anne"" in this version was a bit too old for the part even though she is beautiful.  To me she looked older than Captain Wentworth.  ""Louisa"" was a bit too gushy.  ""Mary was a little too pretty.  She didn't get on your nerves like Sophie Thompson (Mary) does in the 1995 version.  She just whines alot.  I forgot ""Elizabeth"" because she doesn't make an impression at all.",985651200,,448,4.45679012345679
777231,4,6304087977,"If you can get past the truly disturbing 1970's influenced costumes and hairstyles of this production of Persuasion, you will find a faithful adaption of Jane Austen's stunning novel.
While I found the visual look  of the film to be off (it is not even to be compared to A&E's  magnificent Pride & Prejudice) the dialogue and acting are well-done  and the story moves along well. This is the kind of meticulous movie that  takes days to watch; it's far too long to manage in a sitting.
Since  Persuasion is one of my favorite Austen novels, my review is admittedly  biased. I could easily overlook the terrible scenery and costuming (oh,  those 70's gowns!) and immerse myself in the story. Try renting this one  first to see if it suits your tastes.",957312000,6,750,4.628787878787879
777232,3,6304087977,"This movie was a bit slow-going.  It was obviously low-budget (there was a sickly yellow/green tint to it)  The acting was good - but the comments about Anne's hair are so true!  Forgive me - I know she's a Redgrave - but  the way she talked was so annoying.  The scene where she reads the letter  written by the captain was Superb!  But then she ruined it with her,  ""Oh, Frederick, Frederick, Frederick!"" (it was more like  Freder-icchh, Ferder-icchh, Feder-icchh)  I just can't stand the way she  talks!  I would recommend the Root/Hinds version although neither are  really outstanding.",937785600,,590,4.838383838383838

777331,4,6304087977,"Excellent production values.  The obvious comparison is the the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds version; this one is more reserved, more Masterpiece Theater-y.  Ann is less depressed than in the Root version, and this one is a bit more faithful to the book, especially in dealing with Ann's friend Mrs. Smith.

777393,5,6304087977,"This is a well-acted version of Jane Austen's work. The two leads do an excellent job of carrying the story through and this is the first production where I see that Captain Wentworth is explicitly still very much interested in Anne Elliot sooner than in any of the other productions that I have seen. And I believe that I have seen most if not all of the other productions. Also, the addition of internal monologue for Anne at key points and the actresses expressions when reacting to any mention of Captain Wentworth are noteworthy and what make this production stand out. I realize that the camera work at that time was less than what we are used to now. Sadly wanting in that department, yet the production is well-directed and this version carefully re-creates the novel. Ms. Austen would have been quite happy with this one. I don't expect that there will be any digital re-mastering on this because of its age and that it doesn't sell. All that said, it has its merits that far outweigh its weak spots. If you love Austen and want to see a respectful rendering of this novel, this it it. Hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.",1471910400,,1135,4.48792270531401
777394,5,6304087977,"This is not the newest version, but I still love it.  I like that it includes more from the book, sticking a bit closer to the story line.  I also like that the actress portrays the main character, Anne, as refined and confident in who she is.  Regrets from the past, yes, but a true lady nonetheless.",1470960000,,301,4.245614035087719

777398,5,6304087977,"Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen novel and this version is the most accurate to the book. The other 2 out there are fast paced, Ann is so depressed it's unrealistic. Here we have an Ann who's moved on, stands tall and when she meets her Captain years later, naturally falls in love for him again. Jane Austen lived a rural quiet life and her books are soothing to read. She's not a thriller writer like the Bronte sisters. I find the one star reviewers need to read the book to see this DVD captured Austens time best. Acting was very good and scenery very beautiful.",1451952000,,572,4.40566037735849

777401,4,6304087977,"This is an adequate adaptation of Austen's <i>Persuasion</i> as far as it goes. It is by the wordiest version, but at least gets the timeline and the relationships and emotions correct. The costuming could have used someone with some sense as well as taste especially as regards the footwear. Few women would be comfortable walking the back roads of Somersetshire in ballet shoes, though they do look dainty on the foot.

I did enjoy the inclusion of much more of Austen's words in the dialogue and voice overs and the sets were appropriately lavish without Sir Walter Elliot being less of a fop than previous versions while retaining his overweening vanity. An eminently successful adaptation of Austen.",1444348800,5,704,5.017094017094017
777402,5,6304087977,Love the version of Anne Elliot in this BBC production. She is so cultured and civil. Pace may be slow for younger viewers; more like a play for television than a modern drama.,1442188800,2,176,4.363636363636363
777456,1,6304087977,The item arrived OK but the add failed to worn us that it was zoned. You can imagine how disappointed my Mother (83 years old) was when she tried to use it.,1441843200,,156,3.90625
777457,1,6304087977,"Theres the giant haircarrying that much hair should have broken Annes neckthat is always there.  Well, no, it isn't there when Anne is wearing a bonnet:  it wouldnt fit.  Anne is always bonneted or bonnetless (and once with bonnet in hand)but she never puts on or takes off a bonnet on screen because it would be impossible to fit the hair into the bonnets she has.

Theres the green plaid dressand it is a standout horror among a sea of drapery and upholstery fabric costumes.  And then there is the jacket Charles Musgrove wore in the visit to Camden Place.  It was too tightand while that could have indicated carelessness, or straightened circumstances, my guess was a shortage of options in the wardrobe department.

Theres the wooden performances (no one would have any reason to believe that Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth had any history or any interest in each other).  But even better was the extremely animated performance when Louisa Musgrove darted around the room like a pinball while telling the story of poor Dick.  And speaking of animation, Mrs. Smiths upper body was incredibly animated for a woman so sick that she couldn't move from room to room without assistance.

I had planned to spend an evening watching the entire production, but I couldn't do it.  I had to turn it off and let a few days pass before watching a bit moreand I did eventually finish it.  I had expected to find more fidelity to the novel than the BBCs 1995 version.  But, really, I recognized that the 1995 versioneven with its implausible re-write of Mr. Elliots plans and the circus endingis both better cast and much more faithful to the spirit of Persuasion than this disappointment.",1440201600,,1685,4.768965517241379
777458,5,6304087977,So glad to get this version of the classic!,1439856000,,43,3.888888888888889
777459,1,6304087977,The actress playing ann was to old.  Her hairstyle was never changed. I didn't like that the Navy men were never in uniform.  The one thing I did  like was that they kept more of the back story intact.,1439337600,,201,4.102564102564102
777460,1,6304087977,"After reading glowing, 5-star reviews by people who say ""If you love Austen, you'll love this,"" I decided to risk it. I don't care about bouffant hair and polyester double-knit faux Regency costumes after all, as long as it stays true to the book and the acting is tolerable. It stays true to the book (mostly), but the acting was utterly dire. In modern parlance, they phoned it in, and it shows. There is little subtlety and no passion at all. Characters who are supposed to be miserable over repressed feelings and thwarted dreams talk about their suffering in tones one would use to talk about the weather. Even the near-tragic accident in Lyme is boring. Louisa amuses herself by jumping off steps while Captain Wentworth holds her hands. He fails to hold her hands one time and she somehow manages to bonk her head after the 2-foot drop. Everyone stares at her apparently unconscious body as if they too are stunned that somebody could actually manage to injure themselves after such a feeble stunt. Anne's plea for Bennick to find a surgeon is as urgent as if she were ordering a pizza. Also, while it's possible that standards of beauty have changed in the last 40 years, I'm having a hard time believing that anyone would have ever been tempted by Mrs Clay. The men - all of them! - were even worse.

It's probably best not to get me started on the production values. Every interior set was painted some combination of deep olive, rose, and canary yellow. Charles Musgrove looks as if his hair is actually stuck to the outside of a motorcycle helmet instead of his skull. The women's hair is worse. The costumes are a mixed bag. The minor characters actually don't look bad, but the major characters look as if their costumes are made of bad '70s wallpaper.

The worst part was that I watched the whole thing. I kept thinking that this couldn't really be this bad all the way through, that it had to improve at some point. I was wrong. It was uniformly bad, beginning to end.",1438128000,5,1984,4.570224719101123
777461,2,6304087977,"It pains me to say I didn't like this version, as I love Austen. This version isn't just mild, it's a sedative. I wanted to roll my eyes and turn it off several times, especially since it ran so long, but my curiosity wouldn't let me. It just doesn't do justice to the intense emotion of the story. It has the feel of a bad soap opera. Lots of time for character development, but much of it is wasted in uncompelling acting, bad hair, and unimpressive music. I'm sure it has some redeeming qualities I am just not smart enough to capture, so giving it two stars instead of one, but I sure won't watch it again...",1437955200,,612,4.239316239316239
777462,2,6304087977,"I gave it 2 stars because it retains so many smaller details from the novell that usually get cut, but the main actress simply doesn't get the character of Anne Elliot.  There's no quiet longing, no pathos, no sense of past loss, she's purely a pretty face.  the rest of the actors are better, but no-one really sticks out to me as especially well cast.",1436313600,,353,4.415384615384616

777464,5,6304087977,"If you love Jane Austen's wit, and are clever enough to catch the subtle verbal jabs, you will LOVE this movie!  If you prefer modern-style movie romances with beautiful actors, scenes of intense passion, where everything is made very obvious to the viewer (i.e. this is the moment they realize they love each other, they are fighting about whose fault ___ is, this character has underhanded motives, etc. etc.) then this film may not be for you. For Austen lovers out there, these (1970's Austen's by BBC) are brilliant!  They seem to have been recorded on tape, not film, so the video and audio are not great by today's standard, but they did such a wonderful job staying true to the story and character personality that within a few minutes I'm pulled into the story so much that I completely forget that they are lacking.",1433548800,5,825,4.682758620689655

The length and pacing of this mini-series is near perfect.  Even minor characters are given their proper due.  You will come to care for Anne and admire her quiet strength.  It is true to the novel and presents the protagonists with dignity.  This adaptation will hold your attention through to the end and you will come away with a full understanding of the story, whether or not you've read the book.

I detected no distortions or muddiness -- if any exist, they are so minor as to go unnoticed or are easily forgotten.  For those who would rather know about the film, it is a more thorough telling of the story but not a complete one and the performances are a bit dry, which when coupled with the length of the film made for a dull experience but I still enjoyed it.

777597,5,6304087977,"I have noticed that the majority of people who have commented on this 1971 version of Jane Austen's , Persuasion, view this early BBC effort with a great deal of negativity. Therefore, I feel that I must at least address some of those issues. First off, many people seem to anticipate that this production would have a movie quality feel to it only to be hugely disappointed. Well, no, this has a feel of a stage play with performances by probably mostly theatre trained actors. As a result, their acting is different than in the movies. If one cannot separate theatre acting from movie acting then faults are bound to be found forcing some to unjustly say that none of the players can act. Also, I suspect that the majority who have commented are Americans like me. Nothing wrong with that except that the British people have traditionally appreciated the theatre more than their American counterparts. For that population, this version of Persuasion at the time was perhaps better appreciated.

  In addition, some say that because the whole book was filmed with some additional scenes added that wasn't there they felt the mini-series somewhat stilted, I say that it depends on your point of view. For some, like myself, I fully appreciate character development. Unlike the Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds version which I liked yet found lacking in many ways due to time constraint, this 1971 version fleshes out each character so one fully understands what he/she feels and is. However, in today's fast-paced world where people want information at the snap of the finger and run around so busy doing this or that I can see from where impatience with this Persuasion stems. Perhaps one needs to settle down, be open minded, and try to objectively watch without any expectation about whether this is going to be good or bad. Just because today's films are geared towards a fast-paced world doesn't always mean they are good. Many modern films lack character development and if a film is based on a book and one isn't familiar with it then initially it looks great but when one goes to the source material then the film pales due to lack of the richness that the pages hold. This leads to another common complaint. Yes, the production values of the mini series.

  Okay, so early BBC isn't up to par with today's BBC or production values. Due to a tight budget, this Persuasion as well as  many other early BBC classics were TAPED for the INDOOR scenes and FILMED for the OUTDOOR scenes. Yes, once again, the outdoor scenes are crappy looking but one should not judge based on what technology was available for a limited budget back over forty years ago. Just because we are used to the latest technological innovations used in Hollywood films (in particular) doesn't mean that a film is better. All the slickness with all it's glittery packaging will not make a modern mini series or film excellent if the storyline is poor, lacking, or confusing. If a person cannot view a beautiful piece of work because it is not up to par technologically speaking might just be an indication of someone's shallowness. To those of us who are capable we get caught up in the story and use our imagination instead of focusing on the low production values. The furnishings used wasn't bad either and I never really cared for them because the actors speaking were more important. Granted, the minor problem was with some of the costuming especially the green and black checkered dress Anne Elliot wore but I overcame that, too.

  Finally, to the issue of the actors cast for the roles. Everyone was appropriately cast. The fact that Ann Firbanks was older than the Anne Elliot of the book wasn't a big issue at all. The way I saw her was that due to her regret and disappointment  it shows on her face since she doesn't express her feelings as openly as other characters in the book but through her eyes and expressions

  One final word, when viewing classical works and in this case based on Jane Austen, one must remember what era it was written in--the 19th century. The way men and women behaved, talked, walked, spoke, thought, etc., is much different than in the 21st century. If one cannot attempt to understand how people behaved back then and try to infuse 21st thinking into a totally different era then disappointment will definitely be a part of the package. If one cannot accept the time this story takes place then perhaps one should never view classical works.",1394668800,14,4458,4.735483870967742

777683,3,6304087977,"I love Jane Austen's ""Persuasion."" It is not only my favorite Austen novel, it is possibly my favorite novel period.  I have seen all 3 of the available adaptations, and this is a distant second to the brilliant 1995 version with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root.

The poor production values aren't even a consideration; I can live with them if the rest of the adaptation rises above them.  But, in this case, the rest of the adaptation is bogged down by too much fidelity to the book.  For example, during the long walk, the book's Anne keeps herself occupied by reciting poetry.  In this adaptation, however, Anne stops in the middle of the lane and spouts poetry that refers to ""throbbing passions.""  Oh please.

The scene where Wentworth helps Anne into the Crofts' gig is seen from afar, as if it didn't matter very much.  But in the book, it's a rather intimate scene that leaves Anne (and the reader) somewhat flustered.  We miss all that emotion.  And that, to me, is the crux of the matter.  ""Persuasion"" is a very emotional story.  Despite the poetry we hear during the long walk, this adaptation makes the story rather dry and, frankly, rather uninteresting.  I don't feel for Anne.  My heart doesn't break for her when she and Wentworth see each other for the first time in 8 years.

I am glad that the constancy conversation is pretty much intact, but Anne and Harville are so loud that it's just not possible to believe that Wentworth had trouble hearing them (""You sink your voice, but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others."").  And then there's the letter.  Wentworth's letter is, in my not-so-humble opinion, arguably the most beautiful love letter in the English language.  But this adaptation changes the wording of this letter and, frankly, Austen's version is better.  I like the idea that the two of them talk after the letter, but the language is just too flowery and out of character that I don't really like the reality of the scene.

As for the actors, Ann Firbank is almost 10 years too old for the part and we never see her bloom; Bryan Marshall doesn't look as if he's spent the past 8 years at sea; Charles Musgrove looks like a chipmunk; Benwick looks like a vampire (except for the orange skin; what's up with that?) and the Musgrove girls giggle so much that I can hardly listen to them.

All in all, it's not bad, but it's not great either.  I don't hate it, but I don't love it, hence the ""it's OK"" 3-star rating.  Actually, I think it's more of a 2.5-star rating, but I can't give that so I'll err on the side of Austen and bump it up to 3 instead of down to 2.  Of course, it's still better than the 2007 version.  I don't even think those people read the book.  Or, if they did, they certainly didn't understand it.

Anyone who's a fan of Austen should see this, but there's no need to see it multiple times.  It doesn't capture the heart or the imagination the way the 1995 version does.",1327104000,10,2960,4.461824953445065
777684,4,6304087977,"This 1971 BBC version of Jane Austen's last novel,""Persuasion"", runs to nearly four hours on DVD, recreating virtually the entire story, along with all the subtle emotional turns, of a once-thwarted romance.  The settings and costumes are superbly authentic, while the digital remastering of the original television-quality film is generally seamless.

Ann Fairbank plays Anne Elliot, daughter of the snobbish Baronet Elliot of Kellych Hall.  Family financial difficulties have caused the Elliot family to displace to Bath in search of cheaper lodgings, while renting the Hall to a Navy Admiral.  Circumstances throw Anne back into company with Navy Captain Wentworth, whose proposal of marriage she had rejected some eight years earlier, on the advice of close friend and mentor Lady Russell.  Wentworth is now wealthy with prize money from the Napoleonic wars, and looking for a wife.  His attentions appear to fall on Anne's younger cousins Louisa and Henrietta, much to Anne's hidden torment.  An incident at the seaside resort of Lyme will cause Wentworth to take a fresh look at Anne, just as the appearence of a rival suitor complicates Anne's life.

This is a solid presentation of ""Persuasion"", although it helps to be familiar with the novel in order to follow the dialogue.  Fairbank is perhaps a little too attractive to play the supposedly faded Anne, while Bryan Marshall is not entirely convincing as a successful captain.  This reviewer wishes more effort had been put into the presentation of the dialogue between Anne and Lady Russell, in which Anne revisits the reasons for her original rejection.  However, the supporting cast is quite good, especially Anne's whiny younger sister and brother-in-law, and her knowing old friend Mrs. Smith.  ""Persuasion"" is highly recommended to the many fans of Jane Austen's novels.",1322006400,5,1837,5.274914089347079

Other than Anne's ridiculous bee hive hairdo and green plaid dress, it didn't leave much of an impression. The second time I tried to pay closer attention and I did find a couple things to like. This time, my opinion remained pretty much unchanged, except I was able to notice some of the changes made from the novel. You'd think with such a long run-time, it would be extremely faithful. Is it? Well, yes and no. It does follow the novel pretty closely for the most part. Unfortunately, sometimes this can lead to really boring and dull scenes that are good on paper but don't translate that well to the screen. For example, the adaptation starts with Sir Walter reading aloud from The Baronetage as it introduces the characters he mentions. I found this a bit awkward. Who was he supposed to be reading to? Himself? And on the other hand, this version still managed to cut some things out- such as little Charles breaking his collar bone and the whole aftermath with Anne having to miss the party. I thought that was a somewhat important scene, so I was really confused when I noticed it was cut altogether.

This adaptation did not leave much of an impression on me. I thought it was a bit of a bore, despite liking other older adaptations. Some of the actors were good, others were bla. Some of the scenes were good, others went on too long.",1304294400,2,1433,4.490421455938697

Amanda Root and Sally Hawkins both missed it by a mile, and neither of those productions had the maturity of direction or the appropriate casting needed to deliver the story Austen wrote. Bryan Marshall and all the other cast members played excellently, and I think this to be an almost faultless adaptation.

777731,3,6304087977,"In all honesty, I have to say this version was almost painful to watch.  Not because it strayed from the book.  No, just the opposite, in that it follows the book very closely.  It was the actors.  I got the feeling that the actors were all stage/theater actors.  There was little if any feeling, and emotion (when you're twenty or thirty feet away from the audience, facial expressions are not all that important I suppose).  it was as if the actors/characters were just going through the motions and saying their lines.  Anne did show some emotion and you could see it in her facial expressions, but it was slight and fleeting.  This version is completely passionless.  I understand that the newer versions (Amander Root, or Sally Hawkins) stray some from the book.  But since I am not an Austen purist, I can allow for a bit of straying, if it adds some feeling, emotion, and character.  If it gives the watcher a sense that these people are real, and believable, and this is not a ""stage-production"" but a real life experience, then I'm all for it.  Not to mention the Captain Wentworth in this version was just plain...well, plain.  Not handsome at all, totally unattractive.  I felt nothing as I watched him, and silently kept thinking ""can I actually sit through this entire movie??""  The Hawkins-Penry Jones version is my favorite.  It's not completely true to the book, but oh what passion!  What feeling!  And Penry-Jones is one hot potatoe!",1276041600,4,1451,4.736

The actors are overly (and obviously) made up in a way that screams inaccuracy for the time period; the acting is stilted all around; the actress who plays Ann is WAY too old for the part; and the sets are dismal.

777735,4,6304087977,"Despite all of its drawbacks of poor sound and sometimes really awful 1970s wigs, costumes and stage sets, this is unquestionably the best version of ""Persuasion"". It is very faithful to the book, and I find that the all of the parts have been very well cast. Anne Firbank is a bit old for the role  (Anne Elliott is 27) but otherwise excellent. I did like Amanda Root in the newer version- albeit she was presented as just too much of a Cinderella - but that was the only thing I liked! Elizabeth Elliott was simply awful, acting as if she should have appeared in a 19th-century version of ""Big Brother"" in her vulgarity. The Elizabeth of the book was cold-hearted and haughty, but had perfect public deportment. I also thought that Ciaran Hinds was woefully miscast as Wentworth, and I agree with the reviewer who didn't care for Fiona Shaw as Lady Russell. Presenting her in this way was a misreading of the novel. The casting of the 1971 version is wonderful; the Musgraves kind and unintellectual; Louisa and Henrietta young and a bit thoughtless but attractively naive and warm-hearted. Perhaps English admirals didn't have beards at that time, but I loved Admiral Croft and his harumphing! Charles Musgrove was just as I had envisioned him and Mary was also done to perfection, although she was a bit too pretty, since in the book she is described as inferior to both her older sisters, but that's an unimportant quibble.
The slow pace and faithful depiction of manners and mores of that time is something I always enjoy. I, for one, do not want an updated, modernized, falsified version of an Austen novel. I've read and reread all of her books, and when I watch the cinema versions I want them to be true to the period, as this is.

777737,5,6304087977,"I guess that folks are just not used to doing things people did in 19th century England, like going off hunting, walking, gathering hazelnuts, listening to the skylarks, walking by the sea and looking at the fishermen, listing to a harp.  Boring, Boring, Boring...  Yes, back to your TV, back to your powerful car filled with useless electronics, back to your highways, back to your detective and hostpital romance dramas....
  This production is leasurely.  Anne is played by a very beautiful and noble looking actress.  If you cannot see a tragedy if such a woman had been persuaded (prevented) from marrying, when young, a handsome and enterprizing young man headed to sea with the British Navy, then you only see love in the very young ('She looks older it does not matter in your feelings somehow?').  The character does maintain a good spirit to assist all about her and does smile.  Should she grimace or cry like a good spoiled brat?  It is her character. She has not thought of her own happiness enough and has made life better for vain (father), selfish (sister1), self pitying (sister2) for years.  There are or were such people.
  The actors are all convincing to me.  I do not understand how the somewhat comical and dramatic character of the Musgroves would be seen as unrealistic.  The walks Annes sister's manipulation, her husbands patience, and good humor, the long country walks, the visit to the sea, all drew me in like a book would do.
  I believe that Captain Wentworth is very very well played. Something about the 1995 version with Ciaran Hinds made me feel the that there was no past or passion to reawaken there.  Somehow I did not believe.  I loved being able to see Admiral Croft (Richard Vernon) and wife interact with Ann and help bring about her and the captains meeting (I guess having worked years at sea with a lady lost in time, it does hit something in me).
  It is slower, but it is better.  OK. So if a walk to pick blackberries in the english countryside, or a walk on the pier in the west english coast do not appeal to you, and the idea of people bravely and with a smile doing their best for family and/or for country, even to the point of failing their hearts seems unlikely to you this version is not for you.",1209859200,8,2254,4.571072319201995
777738,4,6304087977,"My favourite Persuasion is still this 1971 old tv series.  Initially, the 1971 filming was a bit startling, but by the end of the series, I loved this Persuasion the most.  The production value reminds me of watching a play, as the tv technology was not so advanced 37 years ago.  So be warned, the visual and audio are not like what is available today.  However, this is still my favourite Anne Elliot.  She is dignified, composed, ladylike and kind.  It's a long tv series, so almost nothing is cut out from the book.  I loved this Anne, although the actress was a bit older.  She was exactly what she was in the book, sweetly dignified, kind to everyone, practical and it was easy to imagine her being very pretty in her bloom.  Unlike the other versions (below), Anne seemed not to be timid and spineless, but rather quiet and gentle as she is in the book.  Of the 3 Annes I've seen on tv/film, this was the only one I could see capturing the heart of Captain Wentworth.

I first saw the 1995 Amanda Root Persuasion movie and was disappointed that Anne Elliot was such a timid, spineless, victimized, plain woman.  I found it very difficult to imagine that this Anne had been very pretty in her bloom, or became very pretty and sweetly confident by the end of the movie.

I recently saw the 2007 Persuasion and was again disappointed that Anne Elliot was such an easily disraught, barely talkative character (although the scenery and Captain Wentworth were quite dreamy).  When they first speak of Captain Wentworth returning, her cheeks are supposed to become flushed.  Yet in the movie, Anne is gaping like a fish and completely discomposed.  And of course, there's the spectacle of her running and gasping around during the last part of the movie.

So this 1971 version is my favourite.  Being an Austen fan, though, of course, I have all 3 versions in my DVD collection...",1208304000,10,1880,4.61144578313253

777761,4,6304087977,"Persuasion is my favourite Austen novel. I have read and loved Austen for 30 years, and while I appreciate all the humour, cleverness, tempered cynicism, irony  and fun of novels such as Pride & Prejudice and Emma, the note struck by Persuasion is the longer lasting and the sweeter feeling.

Jane Austen's writing was strongly informed by drama and the theatre of the 18th century. Her books demand the stage and film adaptations that have been made. To me, Austen's novels are like plays, although plays with a difference - something like a script with the author's and character's thoughts intermingled.

The books are readily adaptable, therefore,  to performance as a series of scenes in a play, or episodes in a series. This adaptation of Persuasion closely fits my idea of how to present Austen. What lets it down is poor production. The later 70s and early 80s efforts were all much better produced, including Emma (which was really good) just a year later than this.

Lovers of Jane Austen's work admire it for its wit, humour, subtlety and burlesque. It sets a tone highly amenable to the humorous/cynical mind, and Austen's use of free indirect speech and other clever devices create a very satisfying inside and out view of the story and its characters.

Translating these devices to film and television would seem a very tall order, but the efforts mentioned above, and this one, were really quite (sometimes very) good. The later adaptations, starting with Northanger Abbey in 1986, have been disappointing for me. Too lush and shallow - too unlike Austen.

In this adaptation, the early 19th century in rural England comes to life, in all its slow pace, class restrictions, insularity and prejudice. This feels like an accurate portrait of of the time and the story.

So why only 4 stars (3.5, really)?

1. Poor production values - atrocious editing, poor continuity, poor quality video and film, shocking sound, bad makeup, insufficiently researched dress and other style values - the list goes on. It says much for the acting of the principals that these problems may be ignored once you get used to them

2. Low budget has meant that many scenes retain mistakes such as missed words, cues, long silences.

3. Poor direction, particularly the Lyme fall scene and that part of the Uppercross walk scene where the Crofts are met and Anne taken up

4. Several awkward revisions, in particular the scene near the beginning where the uncomfortable silence between Lady Russell and Anne with regard to Wentworth is dropped in favour of a highly artificial direct discussion.

5. Several omissions, the worst of which was the scene at Uppercross cottage with young Charles climbing on Anne's back, and being removed by Wentworth, a scene pivotal to Anne's feelings in every way.

I thought Ann Firbank's performance particularly good - Ann's range of facial expressions beautifully supply the externals of the internal monologue of her feelings.

Bryan Marshall's Wentworth is very true to the book. He is rather stately and somewhat Shakespearean in places - but I like his interpretation.

I thought that Mary and Charles were both well acted, with Morag Hood doing an excellent job as Mary - possibly the best acting in the film. Just as annoying as in the book.

Henrietta was well played and the scene with Charles Hayter early in the piece was well done. I found Louisa just as she was in the book, and as truly unattractive as Wentworth finally found her. The supporting characters at Lyme were all well played, in particular Benwick.

I thought Admiral Croft very ordinarily played, although his sloppiness did introduce some burlesque, which my 11 year old thought hilarious. One of the few performances I really loathed was Mrs Croft - entirely unlike the character in the book. Her longest speeches were a burden.

Basil Dignam's Sir Walter was very good, but a little patchy. I found Elizabeth not true to her character. Shepherd was quite well played, as was, as far has her role could go, the sycophantic Mrs Clay. The danger to Sir Walter from Mrs Clay was not clear enough - the direction too passive to bring this out either at Kellynch or at Bath.

Mr Elliot was suitably oily, and Mrs Smith played well if a little stiffly. For these two, the dialogue curtailment rendered their roles less pivotal in the plot. As Elliot was a real driver in the novel, and Mrs Smith pivotal in all the changes that occurred in Bath, this was disappointing.

The Uppercross walk scene was well done - not too long as so many reviewers have thought. It contains, for the close watcher, many of the charged dialogues and clashes of spirit and personality depicted in the novel. The worst of this sequence was the very ordinary handling of the scene where the Crofts are met and Anne is taken up - an unforgivably badly directed scene.

The Lyme episode, with the exception of the fall scene, was well done. I found the scene where Mary expresses her disappointment with the Cobb very funny. The fall scene was abysmally bad.

The Bath segment of the movie was well done, although the studio sets are glaringly obvious. The letter scene was somewhat awkward, I thought - this is a direction issue, once again - I thought the acting was as good as the very ordinary direction would allow. The final scenes were modified and curtailed to finish the film cleanly - not too badly done.

What strikes me about this film is its authenticity. It really tries to marry the acting to the book, not just in dialogue, but in characterisation, movement, circumstance and most of all atmosphere. It depicts the rigidity and repressiveness of rural England and its society with telling accuracy, and does reasonable justice to the mileage Austen was able to make from her subject.

For all its obvious faults, I think that this adaptation of Persuasion is the most accurate, sympathetic and satisfying, and one to which I will return often.",1196121600,19,5935,4.829388560157791

I nearly laughed out loud, but it was far too painful for laughter.  The feel of the production is that of an early Monty Python skit without the jokes, although the actress playing Anne is unaccountably amused most of the time.  Even taking into account the low budget and primitive equipment of the time, this is a poor effort.  Haven't seen the ITV 2007 production yet, but it's got to be better than this.",1194825600,2,524,4.542553191489362
777763,3,6304087977,"This is one of my favorite books, and for me the likable part of this adaptation is its length--more Jane Austen is always better than less.  However, the character of Anne is handled poorly.  First, the actress playing her was close to 40 at the time of filming--MANY MANY years older than she is supposed to be, and she looks it.  Second, in order to convey some of the written text, this adaptation has Anne saying things to Lady Russell that the character would never have said to her--she even comes close to arguing with her!  This from the character that Austen described as ""too good.""  Sir Walter Eliot is faithfully portrayed, but Elizabeth actually shows more sense than she is given in the book, but only at certain times, so she's difficult to even understand as a character.  Mary's selfishness and peevishness are even more pronounced than in the book, leading one to wonder why anyone would have ever married her--she was bad enough in the book.

Since my copy came as part of the Jane Austen set--the rest of which is fabulous--I don't regret owning it, but I would be sorely disappointed if I had ordered this DVD by itself.

There was too much casual conversation that was not necessary to move the plot along. No passion was in the acting.

I couldn't identify with the main star and I could not sympathize with her situation because she didn't seem to show remorse for the rejection of a man who would have made her a good husband.",1183766400,2,588,4.336363636363636
777765,4,6304087977,"I think that this version of Persuasion is very underrated. Reading the reviews for the '95 version you would think that no one had seen this one or any other before it. I can understand why this might be undervalued, the setting is very ""stagey"", it does not have the overall beauty and rich settings that newer versions can offer. The sound is very weak as well, the audio pick-up makes it difficult to hear all the lines. (British movies, especially older ones, are notorious for bad sound. I can't understand why new DVD releases do not automatically include subtitling, and I don't mean merely close-captioning, because they really need it.)  Further, there is the effect of the fabrics and styles which are so obviously from the 70's and can detract somewhat from the experience. Anne is wearing a plaid dress at one point! Finally, as has been pointed out the actress playing Anne is obviously quite a bit older then her 20 something role requires. However, all that being said, this is still one of my favorite productions so far. The reason? Despite all of these drawbacks I still feel that it captures the spirit of the novel better than any other I have watched. I love this Anne. She has a dignity and maturity combined with a sweetness of spirit that almost seems too good to be true at times, but is balanced by a subtle but wry sense of humor that prevents her from becoming inhuman and cloying. No other Anne that I have seen captures this to my satisfaction. In fact I found Amanda Root a very sad Anne indeed. She played her as a timid little mouse of a person beaten down by circumstance and victimized by her family. I couldn't respect her.

To my mind one of the things that raises Persuasion above a mere Cinderella story is Ann's personality. Although her family does not value her she is someone who has such a capacity to love and such a desire to be loved in return that she rises above their pettiness and negligence and refuses to become bitter and hateful or pitiful and depressed in response to their lack of concern. Instead she tries to set an example and behave with the caring and consideration that she would like to receive. Her firmness of purpose and ability to value herself is clear in her every action and although she has her disappointments and doubts, she is certainly not a victim. Her ability to forgive and do what she feels is right despite so many obstacles is a clear contrast to Captain Wentworth's  pride driven anger which prevents him from understanding the reasons for her earlier rejection of his proposal.

I wish that more people could appreciate this Anne. I think she is closer to Jane Austen's original character in many respects and that even the actress's age only helps emphasize the maturity of her character. The cover doesn't do her justice for although she is not especially beautiful she is a very handsome woman with a nice smile and I think that too is more like the original Anne who is never described (except by an obviously biased Captain Wentworth) as being especially pretty.

Aside from Anne the other casting is all excellent. Her father and elder sister are the epitome of vanity and false pride. Her younger sister, the attention seeking Mary, is played superbly. Everyone else, from the solicitous but class-conscious Mrs. Russell, the bluff Charles Musgrove, the droll and somewhat eccentric Crofts, the obsequious Mrs. Clay and her lawyer father to the hospitable Hargraves, the dour Captain Benwick and the oily Cousin Elliot are very well cast. Louisa is very well done. Her lack of maturity contrasts Anne nicely showing both the self-centered forcefulness and the fearless sweetness of someone who has not yet experienced the disappointments of life and love. It is possible to envy her youthful vitality and pity her lack of awareness without disliking her personally which I think is a very difficult effect to achieve. In that regard I find that it rings very true to life.
Captain Wentworth also has a boyish charm combined with a hint of that forceful and passionate personality which makes him a good leader on board ship and which made him so temperamental when faced with Anne's refusal. Both his hurt and anger and his later warmth and respect for Anne are played with equal spirit and verisimilitude. Even when he is angry you can see his kindness and strength of character. I don't think that Ciaran Hinds can match that given that he plays aloof and angry characters best. I found him too severe in the beginning and not quite believable when he later relents. It's just not his role. He did a better job as the bitter and more forceful Mr. Rochester in the A&E version of Jane Eyre.

Lastly, the scenery may seem a bit washed out, but that is due to both the location and climate in Britain and the style of filming at the time. Perhaps I am biased in this but I found the length of the film, rather than being off putting, instead allowed me more time to immerse myself in the world and to savor the nuances of the interactions that occur in each scene. I also found the scenery added to this effect and enjoyed the views of Lyme and the walks in the countryside very much for their realism rather than for the larger than life beauty found in more modern films. To my view many of the very things which might be considered negative in this film in contrast with newer ones were what attracted me to it. It doesn't have the polished quality of more recent offerings, but it does have a realism (despite the sound and 70's influence) that makes the experience more immediate. This is a favorite to watch when feeling ill or on a rainy day when something comfortable and non-demanding is required. It isn't especially steamy and passionate, but it is very intimate and warm-hearted.",1182816000,32,5782,4.658178256611166

Anne's character develops physically and mentally into a woman who now believes that she can correct the terrible mistake of taking bad advice in her youth.  All of the virtues that Austen attributes to Anne Elliot are fully realized as Anne goes from an ""insignificant person"" to a woman who learns that she is competent, caring, poetic, and understanding.  She is determined to not make the same mistake again, and this production delves into the maturation of Anne from a doormat to a woman of great depth and wisdom.  The version with Amanda Root is an excellent production also, but the length of that movie does not allow for the time to show these incidences of insight and poetic imagination that Anne brings out in this older Persuasion version.

777770,5,6304087977,"The following is from my review on this production which is posted on [...]

I'm just getting the chance to dig into past Austen films, and I picked this up because Persuasion is, has been, and always will be, my favorite work by Jane Austen, and Anne Elliot my favorite Austen heroine. So it was with great anticipation that I popped the disc into my player.

I wasn't disappointed, either. I knew there were bound to be some draw-backs, so I'll state them, and try not to be too thick about them. Anne Elliot is the most introverted of Austen's characters; she is the least talkative and the least witty. There are passages in the book where Anne says nothing - only her feelings are described. This works fine in print, but how to successfully transfer this to the big screen? Short of doing thoughtful voice overs (which would grow tedious over four hours) you're left with a long succession of shots where the heroine says little or nothing, and must communicate all by her facial expression. This can leave the feeling that the film is slow, and lacking in purpose. If you need a more overt style of Austen, then certainly this film is not for you; but if subdued is more your style, and you tend to pick up on unspoken 'vibes', this will fulfill all expectations.

Anne Firbank (as Anne Elliot), is, thankfully, an actress whose face can convey much. She looked as I had always imagined Anne Elliot would look: not a knockout - Anne wasn't supposed to be the elegant one of the family - nor in her first youth - which is also highlighted occasionally by the lighting and make-up. What you see is someone who is very like Austen's character: someone whose appearance you might pass over once; but hear her speak, and look more closely, and she grows more attractive the better you know her. This is Anne Elliot, as brought to life by Anne Firbank.

Captain Wentworth's portrayal is ably handled by Bryan Marshall. The bitterness is never apparently obvious (save at the concert scene); and, yes, I found it hard to believe he wound find Louisa Musgrove interesting as she was shown. But that is another point of Austen's book: he did not find her interesting, he TRIED to find her interesting, and, ultimately, failed (sigh of relief). So this, too, fits with Austen's original story.

I especially liked the portrayal of Lady Russell, who I thought in the book was not portrayed as TRULY bad; this also comes out in this adaptation.

So this is one film which closely followed the book; I could write much more about how faithfully everything was reproduced, but I'd run out of space here. Charles Musgrove remained one of the most buoyant characters (good fun), Mary the most annoying (I was dying to have her just shut up - but I had that feeling when I read the book, too), captains and the admiral I thought charming.

The cinematography I thought a trifle stiff. There was little or practically no fade from one screen to another - perhaps this is due to it being a TV movie. One scene - CHOP! - the next scene, the actors enter from right, proceed left, and - CHOP! - another scene, where the same thing happens. This was the only part of the movie which I felt cheated me a little. A Low Budget has to show itself somewhere, I suppose.

And, as I said earlier, if you like some pace to go with Jane Austen, don't bother with this one, as you'll find it way too slow. I enjoyed it enormously, though, as it brought a wealth of detail (the sets were richly elegant!) to an excellent adaptation of my favorite Austen novel. I highly recommend it!",1165708800,22,3557,4.529595015576324
777790,3,6304087977,"Like most people, I watched this miniseries as part of a Jane Austen box set. For me this ranks together with Mansfield Park.

Although it has been a time since I have read the two novels, the adaptations both look as if they cover every trivial detail from the book. For me, an adaptation doesn't have to be faithful to every minute detail in a novel as long as it sticks to the main story line.

Persuasion starts rather slow and only after the trip to Lyme it gets interesting. Most of the film runs along without any music at all.

And as some people already said, the fall in Lyme is one of the worst accident shots I have ever seen. I guess they didn't care to plan and choreograph the scene.

Although the leading lady here is a good actress, she is way too old to play Anne Elliot. Basil Dignam, who plays her dandy father is quite a character as is her younger hypochondriac sister Mary. Mary's husband Charles is a likable no-nonsense character. Mrs. Clay is completely miscast. It is difficult to imagine she is going to be able to seduce a young man with ambitions.

I guess most of the actors are  too old for the characters they are playing and the production values of the film are lacking in quality: The costumes are too reminiscent of early 70s. The fabrics are so late 60s, early 70s. I guess since this is a low budget production they couldn't take the trouble to research into Regency patterns and fabrics.

All in all a watchable production but it is lifeless and it is not for those who are looking for  modern day production quality.",1148860800,7,1557,4.400696864111498

777792,3,6304087977,"I am also working through the Jane Austen Collection of DVD, which consists of BBC adaptations of all six of the writer's novels (one is a television movie and the rest are mini-series).  Since you can get the complete novels of Jane Austen in a single volume this seemed a nice companion set of DVDs, but as a general rule they are stately to the point of being sedate.  Not only do the covers of the six DVD cases look the same, so do the productions themselves.  This 1971 production of Jane Austen's ""Persuasion,"" with runs 225 minutes and is broken into two parts, was the second for the BBC following a mini-series in 1960.  Since then there has been a theatrical movie version, which is shorter but vastly superior to this one.

""Persuasion"" is the story of Anne Elliot (Ann Fairbank), the most mature of Austen's heroines, who turned eight years earlier had turned down the marriage proposal of a young naval officer, Frederick Wentworth (Bryan Marshall).  Anne loved him, but was ""persuaded"" by her snobbish family that he was unworthy.  But the Elliot family has fallen on what for them constitutes hard times, with her father, Sir Walter Elliot (Basil Dignam), forced to retrench and lease their ancestral home, Kellynch Hall, and move the family to a smaller place in Bath.  So when the prosperous Captain Wentworth enters her life again the tables have been turned.  Anne is well away of the error that she makes, but it seems the captain's eye is now turned to the beautiful and impetuous Louisa Musgrove (Zhivila Roche).

Running closer to four hours than three, this version of ""Persuasion"" does incorporate most of Austen's novel including her revised ending wherein for the first and only time one of the two people in love actually confesses their love to the other at the pivotal moment.  Granted, it is by letter, but compared to the standard ploy of people finding out inadvertently that someone loves them (e.g., ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""Sense and Sensibility""), this is a breath of fresh romantic air.  Unfortunately, the only person who actually seems to have any genuine affection their loved one appears to be Charles Musgrove (Rowland Davies), who has the misfortune of being married to Anne Mary (Morag Hood).  But when Mr. Elliot (David Savile) actually seems more likeable than Captain Wentworth, that is not a good sign.  As for Anne, like many viewers it is hard to look at her and not think of Amanda Root's winsome performance in the 1995 film, but then everybody in this production is playing things too prim and proper.  The range of emotional responses is so limited with these performers that you have trouble distinguishing between the good people and the bad people.

I have to admit that at this point watching these BBC versions does not inspire me to check out more of them but rather to put together my own Jane Austen Collection of DVDs that have the theatrical film versions.  Yes, they are always shorter and less faithful to the Austen novels, but there is more passion to their performances (see the current ""Pride and Prejudice"" for ample proof), and while it might not be strictly Austen by the letter, it definitely has more of a heartbeat.  Plus I think the humor works a lot better when the characters are more than mannequins.",1136419200,9,3281,4.776991150442478
777793,1,6304087977,"The comparisons between the 1995 version and this one are inevitable. Sadly, this version falls far short.

The casting is uninspired and the acting wooden. One gets the impression the director did not read the book let alone understand the characters.

Sir Walter Elliot is portrayed as pompous but his inadvertent silliness which Redgrave brilliantly captured (in the 1995 version) is nowhere to be found.

The Musgrove sisters are so unlikable, one doesn't understand why Wentworth or anybody else would give them a second glance.

The relationship between Wentworth and Anne is devoid of feeling.

In the 1995 version, Hinds and Root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions. In this version, it is hard to understand Anne spent years mired in regret unless one has read the book.

This production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters' relationship at all.

In the scene where Wentworth walks in on Anne and Mary having breakfast (the first time he sees her in 8 years), it seems to the viewer, as Mary thinks, they are only slight acquaintances.

In the 1995 version, when Wentworth walks in, the tension is thick. Resentment is coming off Wentworth in waves, while Anne is almost overcome.

In this version, while Wentworth is courting Lousia, it is as if he is truly invested, the undercurrents are missing. In the 1995 version, the viewer senses Wentworth's anger at Anne. He is flaunting his courtship in front of her, as if to say, ""see what you gave up, I don't need or want you anymore"".

Yet he still cares if she suffers, as the scene where he asks his sister and the Admiral to take Anne back to house illustrates. In the 1995 version the viewer feels Anne's shock that he would care if she was tired, we also feel Wentworth's discomfort that he still does care.  In this one, he just continues on with Louisa as if nothing happened.

The pivotal scene where Anne is conversing with Harville about who loves longest, man or woman, is totally botched. The actors are just reciting lines with no emotional investment.

When Anne reads the letter from Wentworth, it is as if she is reading a grocery list.

Contrast this to the 1995 version, where the viewer feels Anne's joy at her second chance. We are there with her as she reads the letter. The director had both actors reading the letter and you hear both their voices. Wentworth is full of frustration, passion and hope, while Anne's is at first incredulous then evolves in to joy.

This production has more scenes after the revelation between Wentworth and Anne.  While the book has a chapter or two more, it felt tacked on in this production, as if the director needed to explain what had just happened to the characters.

The 1995 version didn't need to include more dialog, we understood and rejoiced for the characters.

The only thing this production has in it's favor is it kept the Mrs. Smith sub plot intact, while the 1995 version did not.

The 1995 version however did include part of Austen's original ending (which she thankfully changed to include one of my favorite love letters in literature!). The scene where Wentworth is commissioned by the Admiral to find out if Anne and Mr. Elliot will want to move back to her house (which he & Mrs. Croft are renting) after they marry.

Unless you have hours of time to waste, this is a production to avoid.",1135209600,15,3446,4.711666666666667

777795,1,6304087977,"My family bought the entire BBC Jane Austen collection through Amazon.com for Christmas and decided to first watch the only video we had not previously seen - ""Persuasion.""  Let me first say that the ""Pride and Prejudice"" of this series is marvelous, ""Mansfield Park"" we love, and ""Northanger Abbey"" and ""Sense and Sensibility"" are good.  I will reserve comment on ""Emma"" until later.  However, this adaptation of Jane Austen's great novel ""Persuasion"" is just one step above completely hideous.  The only excuse we can give is that it was BBC's first attempt at a Jane Austen novel.

There is so much wrong it is hard to know where to begin.  The script itself is coarse and insensitive, sometimes crudely spelling out the jokes or medical conditions for a presumedly ignorant modern audience.  The book by comparison is witty, elegant and subtle.  Most of the actors were atrocious.  It looked like amateur hour tryouts.  Some sets were anachronistic as were the costumes and characters, and the production was crudely directed and badly edited.

First, the casting was generally horrid.  The exceptions were Sir Walter Elliot who was played with charm and wit, but the star, Ann Fairbank, is not much of an actress and certainly not as Anne Elliot.  She presents herself as a 40 year old ex-glamour queen with a forward personality and a grotesque hair piece.  She constantly gazes into the distance, completely spaced-out, but then the hair piece enlarged her head to the point she could have been mistaken for a space alien.  She is totally unconvincing as she ""reads her lines"" and has not the slightest spark of electricity with the sadly cast Captain Wentworth.  Charles Musgrove is much better as an actor, but although he is supposed to be Anne's age, he looks 25, more like son to mother.  Louisa Musgrove is a frivolous girl and a better actress than the star, but the famous accident at Lyme is a bomb.  Elizabeth Elliot is far too nice, and the ambitious, pretty Mrs. Clay is portrayed by an overweight, lazy and homely middle-aged woman who could hardly be thought to lure either Sir Walter or his sinister heir by her beauty and wiles.  Worst of all was Admiral Croft.  He could not act the part, and he wore a full beard unlike any Royal Navy officer of the Regency period.  He should have been on the Titanic and gone down with the ship.  He kept flubbing his lines, and the director must have been too lazy to reshoot the scenes.  We have honestly never seen acting this poor in community theater or even most high school productions.  Most sets were appropriate; however, the scene at Lyme showed pink front attached apartments with wrought iron trim that looked like they had been built in the 1920s or later.  The costumes were laughable.  (Did anyone do any research?)  Most of the costumes, you would think, were more more fitting for the 1840s through the  American Civil War, except for the fact that the fabrics, patterns and bright aniline dyes had the suspicious look of the late 1960s.  For example, Anne often wore a bright green plaid day dress with puff sleeves that gave the impression of a cheap costume rental used for ""Anne of Green Gables.""  If the director didn't shoot himself, he certainly should have considered it.

The video did provide our family with hours of entertainment as we made fun of the production.  Now that we are in the mood, we can watch ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.""",1104624000,24,3429,4.749576988155669

It's very length is satisfying; it's about four hours in all, enough time for a little more shading of character and manner.  We see the Musgroves and Anne arriving at the inn at Lyme for example, and the character of Sir Walter is a little less obvious and hilarious, though equally narcissistic.  What is remarkable is how much alike the two versions are; they really both are very accurate adaptations.  And it's good to see the Italian concert scene as executed by different actors.  There are different production values of course, this version is much more cheaply done, perhaps that is why the sailors are in civvies throughout the show.  And this version does delve into the connection between Mrs. Smith and young Mr. Elliot, a connection which was entirely ignored in the film, but at least makes more sense than his chasing after his broke cousins for their money.  And if you're an afficionado you may notice that this Mrs. Smith entirely lacks the charm of the film one.  Lady Russell is also quite different, a sweet old lady, rather than a society queen and fashion plate with philosophical  inclinations.  This version doesn't capture at all the dull depression and cruel neglect experienced by Anne Elliot that the 95 film does so well.  And I'm sorry to say that the actress playing Anne seems rather more like a model than a great lady with a warm heart.

7861102,5,6304087977,"I bought this as part of a set, and this is still my favorite so far of any movies I've seen adapted from this story. I have a little problem with the casting (everyone seemed so old), the clothing, the sets, and the hairstyles, but hey, this was 60s-70s era, and above every complaint that I have, they stuck very well to the original story, and I loved the casting of Anne. She's quiet, subtle, even hesitant to reveal what she still feels, but she never seems lacking in intelligence, depth of feeling, or capability. She is such a peaceful personality, but certainly not cold, and not awkward. In fact she's quite graceful. The story and the characters are what it's all about, after all. The rest is background.",1521936000,,716,4.558139534883721

7861104,1,6304087977,"False product description. I bought this DVD because in the description says close caption and subtitles (I already have this DVD with no subtitles), but it's exactly identical with the one I have. Only thing in the menu is episodes.",1514592000,,233,4.85

7861110,4,6304087977,"Excepting the poor video quality (one can't help these things sometimes, I suppose), this is an accurate adaptation of Persuasion.  The progression of Anne and Wentworth falling back in love with one another is so well-calculated that it feels real.  Also, while Ann Firbank is lovely, she fits Anne Eliot perfectly both in the parts where she ""has lost her bloom"" and subsequently becomes handsome again.",1495670400,,405,5.121212121212121
