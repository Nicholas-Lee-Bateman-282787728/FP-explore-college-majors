7371073,5,B013TFJ4SQ,Saw the movie in the theatre and loved it. Great story of Walts struggles and how he overcame them.,1446336000,,99,4.2631578947368425
7371074,5,B013TFJ4SQ,I Loved this movie. I saw it at Amc Downtown Disney theater.,1446076800,,60,4.083333333333333
7371075,3,B013TFJ4SQ,"""Walt Before Mickey"" (2015 release; 110 min.) is a look at Walt Disney's early years, in particular the decade between 1919 and 1929. As the movie opens, we see a 7 yr. old Walt in rural Missouri, with a stern father. As a 13 yr. old, Walt officially becomes interested in animation, and we swiftly move on to 1919, when Walt moves to Kansas City and starts his first company ""Laugh-O-Gram"". At this point we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the movie adaptation of the book of the same name by Timothy Susanin (and with a foreword by Diane Disney Miller, Walt's biological daughter). I have not read the book and so cannot comment how closely the movie sticks to the book (I'm guessing, very closely). I don't want to overstate this, but at the same time don't want to gloss over it, namely that this movie comes with the official Disney stamp of approval. That could be a good thing, although the downside of this is that there isn't the slightest critical look or negative thing about Walt Disney in this movie, NONE. I mean, to accept this movie as 100% true, Walt Disney had to have been a living saint. It even goes so far that at the end of the movie, when we are informed what would become of many of the characters featured in this, the makers of this movie somehow feel obligated to point out that ""Walt never held a grudge against Charles Mintz"". (You need to see the movie to fully understand how badly Mintz treated Disney...) As to the acting performances, I felt many of them were quite 'wooden', you can tell they are literally 'acting'. Thomas Ian Nicholas (best known from the American Pie franchise) as the young Disney tries to make the most of it, but even he cannot save the movie. Bottom line, I was disappointed with the second rate quality and overall feel of the movie, like this was a TV Movie of the Week, directed by a first time feature-length director (in this case: Khoa Le). Is there a great story to be told? Absolutely! But it won't be found in this movie, unfortunately.

The movie opened in theaters in early September and the matin&eacute;e screening where I saw this at (in Naples, FL) was attended very nicely, somewhat to my surprise, since this movie has not gotten much of an advertising push or anything. Seems that people really do want to find out more about the early life of the American icon that is Walt Disney. Surely Walt deserved a better movie than this. ""Walt Before Mickey"" is strictly for Disney fans, and even then, viewer beware!",1445212800,21,2636,4.501043841336117
7371076,5,B013TFJ4SQ,"This is a great ""docudrama"" about Walt Disney, like many it doesn't get in so deep into the truth and every issue possible to. Instead it skimmed a lot of truth and bundled many situations and issues into a one or two spots onscreen. I felt that this was great to get a general idea of the problems Walt went through and ultimately gives hope to this world.",1512691200,,357,4.264705882352941
7371077,1,B013TFJ4SQ,"This is awful. It's on a student film level.
I really wanted to like it. I really did. I love all things Disney. But... they just wouldn't let me.
I sucked it up & stayed to the end because I was curious. 1) To see if it got any better (NOTE: it doesn't); 2) I wanted to know whatever info about the man's story I could glean -- which about the reclusive Disney is more than I'd ever known.
But cheeeesh, even the casting guys were in the film, the producers & their kids were in the film, the casting guys got writing credit, the actors were the producers, everyone was doing double duty. Clearly a labor of love on this small group's part, but love only gets you so far past wretched.
Talent & folks who actually know how to make a movie, write a movie or act in a movie get you farther.
The losers here are the production companies that sunk money into this, and... poor Walt.",1506124800,,879,4.176470588235294

7371080,3,B013TFJ4SQ,"This film details an often overlooked but crucial period in the rocky rise of Walt Disney. While this is a low budget production with unknown actors it does a pretty good job, if not a glossy one. Walt earned his way to success the hard way, by never giving up in the face of repated failures. Recommended.",1486857600,,306,4.385964912280702

7371112,4,B013TFJ4SQ,"This movie moved both slow and fast for me. There was a lot of ground to cover with the years of Walt's life before Mickey so it moved fast, but it's not a really fast pasted, action kind of movie. Then again I really enjoyed it but then again I find anything Disney related interesting. I wouldn't suggest watching it if you have a lot of distractions around.",1483574400,,360,4.3088235294117645
7371113,2,B013TFJ4SQ,Terrible script that results in some surprisingly bad acting. Interesting to watch for the biographical aspect only. A missed opportunity on so many levels.,1483401600,,156,5.541666666666667

7371122,2,B013TFJ4SQ,The movie was slow with little emotion.  It basically gave the facts of how Walt Disney struggled to make his way to success.,1482883200,,125,4.434782608695652
7371123,4,B013TFJ4SQ,If you know Disney history you will be bored and upset by creative liberties in making this film.  If you just want to watch a historical story about Walt Disney this is ok.,1482883200,,173,4.242424242424242
7371124,2,B013TFJ4SQ,The audio level of the vocals needs to be raised.  In order to hear the dialogue we had to have the volume up to 60 and then lower in dieing non-vocal sound effects. The acting was sometimes stilted.  And I don't know anyone around these parts who pronounces the name of the town in which Walt was born Marce-lynn.  Around here it's known as Mars-suh-leen.,1482796800,,356,4.446153846153846

7371134,1,B013TFJ4SQ,"This movie was just ok.  I was hoping for more backstory, but it's pretty lackluster.  I didn't care for the leading man or his narrations.  There were a few exceptional shots of landscapes or scenery, but the studio shots were a bit amateur at times.  Also, most of the actors were not very good and came off as unbelievable.  There was a scene were the lead had to break down and it was pretty embarrassing, even laughable.  He didn't have much range and the direction was off.  Most of the film came across as actors reading lines, rather than an engaging story being told. Being that this is one of the most prolific animator of our times, I was very disappointed and this movie fell short of expectations.",1481760000,,710,4.5

7371180,5,B013TFJ4SQ,Awesome movie,1475107200,,13,6.0
7371181,3,B013TFJ4SQ,"Walt before Mickey is actually a pretty decent film showing you how the Disney Company got started and the trials and tribulations Walt went through before his company became massively successful.  Like Conrad Hilton, Walt Disney seemed to be willing to take large risks and dream big.  The acting isn't bad in the movie and it definitely was not an easy path to success for Walt Disney which the film accurately convenes.

Now being that this is a Disney film I thought they would show Walt as nothing but a saint the whole time, the ultimate goodie to shoes, never insulting anyone or doing anything wrong.  But the film does an accurate job showing how Walt smoked like a chimney and all the stress he must have been under to put out a quality good product that will be profitable without any financial backing.  Walt actually comes off as more a Steve Jobs type of executive demanding perfection and being pretty inflexible on anything but work.  He assembles a great team of young animators but has trouble keeping them because he cant pay them.  He bounces several checks to his employees and just about all of them walk out on him.  That is pretty much how it would go in real life.  Only one of his main artists stayed with him by the end of the movie more out of loyalty and love of the work they were doing.

Now I liked the film, I would actually like to see a lot more movies made like this, telling us the back story of the Hollywood titans actual lives how they built these amazingly successful companies.  The problem with the movie is that it ends rather abruptly, The movie could have easily been 45 minutes to an hour longer explaining how the company took off after the success of the Mickey Mouse character.  And the decline of the rival Felix the cat characters popularity.  We don't get to see Walt actually build his studio from the ground up and there is no mention of Steamboat Willie which I thought was the breakthrough Mickey Mouse animated cartoon.  For that reason alone I would rate this film 3 star instead of 4 or 5.  There could have been so much more to this movie.  The audience the film is targeting is aimed at adults not children.  My 5 year old daughter was bored stiff watching this movie with us.  So the movie shortchanges itself ending so quickly only telling us 2/3rds the story.

The ending as well could have shown you the actual actor portraying each real life person side by side with the real life image of the person along with the paragraph description of what they went on to do.  3 of the original Disney animators joined Warner Bros and became massively successful with the creation of the Looney Tunes characters.  That story could be the premise for another movie that I would really enjoy seeing.  Since I am actually more of a fan of WB cartoons in general over Disney films.  Overall I would recommend the movie I did learn a little bit and it was not overly sappy, although I thought at the end Walt probably didn't hold a grudge against Charles Mintz because Walts company was probably killing Mintzs company in sales and profits at that point in time.

Walt was a gambler and another movie should be made about how he went all in on the Disney Cinderella movie that could have bankrupted his company if it failed in the early 1950's.  This movie is just a tiny glimpse of the mans life.",1475107200,,3349,4.486798679867987

It's hard to tell anyone's life story let alone the story of how a cult icon started his legendary animation company. Disney is associated with magic, beauty, innovation. I applaud them for attempting this, but if you know you have limited resources embrace that and be more creative with what you have.

The Good
Beautiful clear images, great use of lighting.
Reasonably consistent with period costumes and props (If there were mistakes they weren't noticeable to most people).

The Bad
Narration seems like a cheap way to pull a story together. Stories are stronger without narration.
Lillian Disney's wig.
""kid""
intense scenes fizzle out.

Otherwise this would have been a great start to a documentary.",1469491200,,879,4.925675675675675

Would love to have been there and saw all of this. To be by his side and see the highs and lows. Can only imagine what he would think of his corporation now.

7371447,3,B013TFJ4SQ,"WALT BEFORE MICKEY is a somewhat positive viewing experience for those who are interested in Disney or early animation history.  The film depicts Walt's early struggles to get his company off the ground, and it's good to see several of his coworkers who went on to greater fame, like Rudy Ising and Friz Freleng, getting screen time.  It's definitely not great, and it's probably not completely accurate, but it's also mildly entertaining.  And it also has a little bit of heart, which is a trait sadly missing from most films today.  I doubt many casual fans are aware that Disney, a man who achieved so much during his life, suffered repeated failures during the early years of his career.

Some of the other reviewers have criticized the film because it wasn't more honest about the negative aspects of his personality and leadership.  I don't think anyone could reach his level of success and not make difficult and unpopular decisions, and Walt was certainly a man of his time [an era, for instance, when women didn't often have creative or leadership roles in business].  Clearly, he was no saint.  He was simply a very smart, driven, talented, and---like all of us---imperfect man.  And for the record, can we please put the antisemitism and racist rumors to rest? Throughout his decades of success, some of his most important collaborators were Jewish.  If he was such a racist, why would he continue to hire these people and let them benefit from his company?  As for the racism accusations, this says it all from someone who actually knew Walt:

[...]

Of course, those kinds of things aren't covered in WALT BEFORE MICKEY.  But, while it's generally pretty tame, this movie touches on some of his Walt's less likeable traits.  He is depicted as a driven boss who often expects his employees to work long hours for nothing in service to his vision.  He makes naive business decisions that usually end up being costly.  He is depicted as a frequent smoker, which is something the official Disney promotions didn't permit.

All-in-all, it's a slightly charming, okay movie.  Disney fans will likely enjoy it, while others might be less interested.",1468454400,,2155,4.8708791208791204

7371449,3,B013TFJ4SQ,"It was an interesting part of Walt Disney's life that most of us don't know about.  He worked hard to get his company going and suffered numerous set backs and had his share of people taking advantage of him. His passion for what he loved to do, namely animation, and his dedication to those people who stuck by him was all there.

I suppose it's the ""never give up the dream"" mentality ... or perseverance ... or just darn lucky his brother Roy was a better businessman and willing to pitch in.  Wow - kinda burst my bubble.  I almost wish I hadn't spent the time watching the progression of his career.  Would have felt better about him if I'd left the past in the past!  Usually it's good to know the full story .... this time, not so much.  Sorry, Walt.

I particularly love the ending of this movie, but wish they would have chosen ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" for the song they put in the movie when Walt Disney saw the falling star in the sky above the clouds with a very recognizable shape.",1466812800,3,514,4.457446808510638

Probably not a good show for small kids - this is not a Disney show, it's the story behind Disney before he became a household name.

Would suggest this movie to someone who wanted their date to go badly, someone who wished to get dumped, or someone interested in using cinematographic torture techniques.

With all that he went through to get to that ""sweet spot"" in his life would have buckled most into a heap but Walt had that inner strength and drive that didn't allow him to quit.

7371816,3,B013TFJ4SQ,"I have not personally seen this movie.  I put it on our Kindle to entertain my 10 yr old daughter on our way to Disney World.  She loved it. Watched it twice on the way and made a number comments referring to it during our visit.  I loved that when she saw the statue of Walt Disney she wanted to have her picture taken with him and this gave her a little bit of insight into how Walts amazing dream was and how it has grown.  This is up next on my watch list thanks to her fantastic review.

Revise my rating here. My daughter loved this movie so I gave it a 5 but I honestly have no idea why she love it.  It was interesting and quaint but I kept waiting for something to happen and it just never came. I'm guessing this was historically correct and just stopped and assumed you knew the rest of the story.  Which I do but I wanted to see on the big screen.  So I was disappointed.  My daughter watched for the 4th time with me and said didn't you love it mom.  Apparently I missed something ?!?",1466035200,,997,4.0152284263959395

7371822,1,B013TFJ4SQ,"Looked forward to viewing this film--anything Disney should be enjoyable, i thought. Unfortunately, this was not the case.  If one desires to see what not to do, making a movie, this film is an excellent example,  The acting is wooden, the lines dull and without advancing the film's development.  Scenes jump from one to another without continuity.  What I discovered is that Walt Disney had significant difficulty developing his company due to financial difficulties, again and again--the same and reoccurring theme of the film.  It wasn't until Mickey came along that Disney became the success we all appreciate today.  Don't waste your time watching this film.",1465948800,,664,5.216981132075472

There were points in the movie when the camera concentrated on the cigarettes and not much of the story. We know they smoked a lot back then but come on! It was ridiculous. Also, when you're able to see the makeup on the male actors from where it begins to where it ends (even the cakiness of it), I think it's time to review the makeup application process.

The script was probably scrubbed too hard to receive the Disney stamp of approval. If Walt was really this saintly, I don't see why his animators would ever strike his company. Although, I was surprised that it seemed to show Walt smoking from the age of 13 on.

I think they jumped through the most interesting part of Walts life way to fast and it would be neat to see this as a 3 parter that explores before Mickey, at the start of Mickey for TV, the start of Mickey for Movies and lastly the start of Mickey for Theme parks.  It's a fascinating journey that both Walt and his brother went on and a true Horatio Alger story see it for the subject matter and you will like it.

7372170,2,B013TFJ4SQ,"It was a nice try, but fell short. The film feels like a bad student film. Because of the topic I forced myself to finish. And as it was filmed in the Orlando area, including places we know well, it was of interest. But in the end it is just not a good film. I know it has a following, and that's great. Many will perhaps enjoy it. We did not.

The acting is very amateur. Even actors with known histories turn in weak performances. The story of Walt Disney is a rich, complex, and known journey. Documentaries, books, even films have covered the topic and done well. This film is an admirable attempt but people one suspects are fans, but falls short in every effort.

Elements that should be covered are often passed over. This would not be such an issue if they were replaced with lesser known elements of Walt's life with more fully developed elements, but that doesn't even happen. His father's treatment of him, his family's treatment, his relationship with Ub, how he met his wife, how he and Roy become partners... so many ways to go. The film could not cover them all, but never even covers some. In an effort to show everything it shows little, adding nothing new to what's already been said and done.

Characters who played such a large role in Disney's life are secondary characters at best here. Ub Iwerks and Roy Disney, for example, are secondary with little revealed or added to in how much they were part of Disney's life. One could argue that Disney is the film's central focus, which is true and might be the rationale, but even here the story never goes beyond some pouting amid short scenes of forced acting. Even his well known smoking seems an odd after thought, pushed into scenes well, because it was well known. Scene after seen we are given a Walt trying to follow a dream, but rather than giving the viewer a well developed effort, scenes are short, forced, pouting, trying to be meaningful, then moving on to the next try. The story never pulls out the actual story for very long or very deeply at all.

Walt Disney left behind a powerful legacy both personally and professionally. The producers and director I am sure wanted to honor that. Unfortunately they and their effort fall short. Many will enjoy a charming, simple story. Most with who enjoy film or Disney will surely come away wanting.",1464652800,2,2325,4.555023923444976

7372209,2,B013TFJ4SQ,"What seemed to be an interesting premise for a feature film was quashed by sub-par writing, poor directing, and mediocre acting. From its beginning to nearly the closing credits, film principally focused on the apparent insurmountable financial and inner struggles that Walt Disney faced in his early career against the established animation film industry. What it glaringly lacked was any attention to his ingenuity, uniqueness and creativity. Starting with the film's cover design which depicts a fluffy, white Mickey cloud proved incongruous with the film content which remained morose and despairing. The writer and director's attempts to insert comic relief by providing prat falls, overly emoted casting calls and occasional quirky interactions among the Disney animators appeared forced and awkward, seeming much more reminiscent of what one would expect to find in a high school drama or Mack Sennett production, rather than a modern day film. Scenes were choppy and quite often unidimensional. The director chose to frequently provide overdubbed narratives rather than character dialogue for much of the opening scenes and continued at various places throughout the film which truly became quite tedious. One of the few standout performances was provided by Jon Heder (AKA ""Napoleon Dynamite"") who offered a decent portrayal of Walt's older brother, Roy. In summary, I'd recommend a more prudent use your time is to skip this film and instead, sit back and enjoy Plane Crazy and/or Steamboat Willie!",1464393600,,1508,5.448717948717949

7372289,3,B013TFJ4SQ,"I was attracted to the compelling story of Walt Disney's childhood, early successes and failures, the character of Walt and the people who shaped him and his business.  I became a little disillusioned.  This film is worthwhile--it's just not great.  Roy Disney, with his natural business accumin and power of gentle persuasion, was critical to the Disney Bros. studio survival, but you wouldn't know it from Jon Heder's portrayal.  Ubbe Iwerks ( played by the film's co-producer & co-writer Armando Gutierrez) was a thick accented Dutch immigrant, whose output of 1,500 cells per day kept the studio afloat.  Missing from the film was his Dutch accent, and why his name was the Dutch Ubbe Iwerks, and his phenomenal drawing output.

This story was such a gold mine of genius, persistence in bad to worse times, Walt's sometime's bad and bridge-burning temper, and contrasts between what Walt and his competitors were doing, that I wish the film had dug a little deeper to strike the mother lode.",1464048000,,995,4.963855421686747

It certainly doesn't feel professional.  It's clearly a low-budget film (and there's nothing wrong with being low budget, but don't expect any excellent sets, etc, here to make up for poor acting).  Hallmark movies and Christmas movies have more tooth.
I think the concept of this movie is a lovely idea, but it is executed poorly.  I think it's almost an insult to the genius of Walt Disney to present this is such a poor way.
I was very disappointed.  One tends to expect anything connected to the Disney name (no matter how tenuous the connection) to be well done.  This was not.",1463961600,,750,4.559701492537314

There were opportunities to explore more of young Walt's life, however, this production chose to dwell endlessly on a chain of financial failures until his well-known final success is revealed at the end.

The film makes a point about Disney loving his work, even when he had to invent the technology, the character, the dialog and the Mickey himself. He had loyal friends, but they had human limitations like bills, rent etc. and they had to leave him after months of setbacks . In the end it was Mickey and Walt's big  brother, Roy,  who would save Walt. Optimism was Mickey's secret to Walt's success.

However, the scenes with him and the mouse were ludicrous. In one scene he apparently sees a mouse on his desk and starts hand feeding him. In another scene, he is carrying the mouse  in his shirt pocket, talking to it, and feeding it.  I assume this is the movie maker taking liberties with reality in order to plant the idea that this is how Walt came up with Mickey Mouse.

However, the movie did share quite a bit of the early struggles he had with his businesses, and it delved more into the romance between Disney and his wife-- though I don't know to what extent it was dramatized for the movie's sake-- it was still fun to watch.

7372502,5,B013TFJ4SQ,Unlike a lot of reviews I learned a lot about Walt before he became famous. It was interesting to me that I saw Walt lost one business.

The cast did a fine job.
As far as I can tell, it is historically accurate, except for one minor mistake; near the end, the first Mickey cartoon ""Plane Crazy"" was labelled a sound film, but it was, in fact, silent. ""Steamboat Willie"" was the first sound Mickey cartoon.",1463356800,,426,4.618421052631579

The acting is probably the worst I have seen in years, by every actor in the film. I can't imagine this film being authorized by Disney Studios as it falls far short of their quality. Enjoyable for someone 14 years old and under. Maybe ??? A 14 year old may even pick up on how terrible the film is and become uninterested in watching it, and since there is no real animation scenes it's not exactly a children's movie that would keep anyone younger entertained either.

7372882,5,B013TFJ4SQ,"Though the acting was meant to recreate the times in which walt lived, I loved the pain and determination that Walt endured at that time in his life.  Couple this movie with the PBS American Experience documentary, and then read Walt Disney by Neal Gabler and maybe we can all scratch the surface of the unanswerable question, ""What was he really like?""  I believe that he was a deep, dear hearted person who valued loyalty and values.  He passed when I was a few months old, but I'd like to believe that he passed on the great sense of hope that I have in life.  I miss him every day.",1462406400,,585,4.290909090909091

7372888,2,B013TFJ4SQ,Remarkably bad. I know Disney drew cartoons but that doesn't mean his movie has to be such a caricature. It's about as cliche and cheesy as it can get. Sloppily thrown together scenes of a few seconds each in order to tell a bland story we've seen a thousand times. It's so belabored and unrealistic. Just simply bad. I watched for an hour hoping it would pick up but it never did. Don't make the same mistake.,1462406400,,410,4.337662337662338

i really can't give it more than two stars for the ""middle school acting"" that another reviewer aptly wrote. But it wasn't just the acting, the directing and cinematography were just so bland oh man i couldn't get my finger on where it failed.

7373028,5,B013TFJ4SQ,"Okay, let me start by saying this is a review of the movie, as I caught it via streaming service today and now completely intend to buy the blu-ray (I would have anyway, being a big Walt Disney fan, but having seen the film, I'm more excited than ever to). I am a Disney fanatic, admittedly, but I am not one who doesn't approach a film like this with a critical eye. In fact, I think many fans are much more wary and ready to hate movies like this, a film about the life of Disney that is not made by the Disney company could easily be full of slander and tabloid baloney. On the other side, even if it's a very good film, a low budget project like this could be just plain poorly made and not worth my time or money. Having finally seen this long awaited film though, I am very happy to say that both travesties were avoided, and the end result is something I very much want to own and watch again and again.

""Walt Before Mickey"" tells the tale of Walt Disney's struggles to start an animation studio of his own against countless obstacles that usually could be boiled down to money. And, while that seems like a one note tune, the film's charm is in the relationships Walt builds, the ideas and inspirations along the way, and the love story between himself and his eventual wife, Lillian. Most of all, it's an inspirational story about determination and perseverance, about sticking to your dream and being true to yourself. It's about hard work and finding new ideas to achieve your dreams when the old ones don't pan out. I've no doubt some of this is dramatized, but I'm sure a lot is accurate as well, going by all I've read before, and I'm happy to see that it doesn't focus on painting Walt in a negative light, although he is not shown to be without flaws. He's a bad money man, has a temper, and he smokes constantly. That may be the limit to any dark side of Walt we get to see, but that's fine with me. This is a film intended to be enjoyed by the whole family, and it is perfect in that regard. The budget is obviously on the low side, and yet, the film is quite lovely to look at. It's a soothing, beautiful period piece. The performers may need some time before any are up for Oscars, but this movie is a bit too pleasant to be in that ballpark anyway. Saving Mr. Banks is more in that ballpark. Still, the acting is far better than I expected, and the actor who portrays Walt does a fine job. Jon Heder is one of the 3 or so more familiar faces in the cast. He plays Walt's brother Roy, and if you are a fan of his acting, I don't think you should have much trouble with anyone else in the film. There is no one who is less than adequate. But, again, this isn't the big budget, Tom Hanks led Disney film. Regardless, these actors were still able to get tears from me frequently throughout this film.

There are a few times when the narration is drowned out by the sound effects and music, and it would have been nice to see more of Walt's childhood. I think, had this been a big budget, bigscreen release, we would have seen that, but the film also would have been much longer, and probably darker. This film is perfect for what it is, and I am so happy that it exists. I look forward to placing an order for my own copy very soon. If you are a Walt fan, the odds are in favor of you loving this one. If you've ever seen the once aired, long forgotten (but available on at least one of the blu-ray releases, if not all) telefilm about L. Frank Baum, ""The Dreamer of Oz"", starring John Ritter, this one is a lot like that, but higher quality in most respects. So, if you enjoyed that one, you should love this one too!",1462233600,,3636,4.200286123032904

7373115,2,B013TFJ4SQ,"Only interesting if one knows about Disney successes in later years.  I am a Disney fan and remember the cartoons and movies and the 50's-60's television show with fondness.  Disney was a visionary and a hard worker but this rags to rags saga isn't terribly interesting except as an anecdotal aside to a great career later on.  The acting was so-so, the dialogue poorly written and the characters somewhat bland, predictable and sentimental.  Genius is admittedly wonderful but worthless without the hard work.  Just not terribly interesting as a feature-length film subject.",1461974400,,575,5.206521739130435

7373125,4,B013TFJ4SQ,"To be honest, I already knew Walt Disney's story quite well, but I still wanted to see how this movie was. The storyline is nothing short of inspiring. Walt had a perseverance that most people do not possess. When faced with adversity, he adapted and overcame. He never lost sight of what he wanted and he never gave up. These are the lessons that our children need to learn and I think this movie demonstrated it perfectly. My only hang up was the dialogue and the casting of Roy Disney. I could not get past Napoleon Dynamite playing Roy. The dialogue was a bit choppy and clunky at times - like a middle school play. However annoying those may be, I still felt like this was a good film. Although I secretly wish they would have ended with a picture of Walt Disney and his quote ""I only hope we never lose sight of one thing - that it was all started by a mouse."" May his ingenuity and legacy, live on forever.",1461888000,,913,4.283236994219653

7373297,4,B013TFJ4SQ,"I guess I'm not as cynical about Disney as I am about some other things and sometimes you need a feel-good movie to make things better.

Walt Before Mickey is a story of perseverance, family and friendship.  It's the story of the fall and further fall of Walt Disney before he actually made it big.  While this may not be glamorous, action or even big names, it is a sound movie.

Rarely do I sit through a drama without getting fidgety but this held my attention by a great story nicely told.  Everybody knows the success of Wally Disney, few know his challenges, fewer still his failures.

7373309,3,B013TFJ4SQ,"I'm surprised this film has 4/5 stars overall. To its credit, if you haven't read Walt's biographies it provides a basic, workmanlike backstory to how Disney became successful.

However, I will reiterate the other reviews that the screenplay is not well done. The dialogue can be clunky, full of exposition. Handling Roy's wedding seemed more like a spoof. While the guy who played Walt himself held his own, some of the acting around him was subpar. Jon Heder (Napoleon Dynamite) stood out as Roy for his particularly wooden performance. And, the overall budget felt very limited, more like a stage play version rather than a real dynamic film.

I'm not an expert on Walt's life, but I suspect a lot of his darker impulses (anti-Semitism, aggressive in work) were whitewashed out to keep the Disney myth in tact.

The big ""life lesson"" moments were ham-fisted, too. Rather than showing it, his father simply looked right at the point-of-view camera to say nothing worth doing is worth doing without hard work, Another childhood adult on the farm says point-blank ""I believe in you"" to a seven year old who wants to draw. The big revelatory moment at the end was truly absurd. I won't ruin it here, but I burst out laughing when Walt looked up.

I was reminded somewhat of Hayao Miyazaki's The Wind Rises. Another great animator still living with us, but this particular film felt flat to me as it tried to tell the real story of a man obsessed with designing airplanes and in the end just wound up fixating on a lot of office and business politics. Not the stuff great animation is made of.

But, like I said, it's not terrible and is worth watching just to be reminded of what it takes to realize a dream and build something you can call your own. Too many people are looking for someone else to make their dreams come true for them.",1461369600,14,1835,4.616564417177914

7373373,2,B013TFJ4SQ,"No bad but drags a bit. The theme concentrates on his late teen and twenties, documenting his early struggles and final rise to fame, ending with the crude original rendition of Micky Mouse.

When his fiance (maybe wife at the time, hard to say which) tells him he has a good heart, I thought I sure haven't been able to tell that from the movie. Not great acting in the movie.

I wish he was still around to make the wonderful movies today. Quite a man!",1461024000,,268,4.604166666666667
7373406,5,B013TFJ4SQ,Loved this movie and learned a lot about Walt Disney. Not much action but if you are interested in the early life of Walt you should watch it.,1461024000,,142,4.107142857142857
7373407,2,B013TFJ4SQ,It was a great story it jumped too fast and not enough detail could have been much better with more detail that's why I gave it only two stars,1461024000,,142,3.9310344827586206

7373411,3,B013TFJ4SQ,Interesting history.  I wasn't aware of Walt's struggles prior to Mickey Mouse.  Only gave it 3 stars because I thought the acting and script seemed amatuerish.,1461024000,,160,5.115384615384615
7373412,5,B013TFJ4SQ,For a low budget movie I really enjoyed it.  You will love this interpretation of the beginning years of Walt Disneys life. Fun when the animated mouse was given a name. If you are a John Heder fan you will love his presence in the movie. I highly recommend the movie. I purchased it on Amazon.,1460937600,,294,4.25
7373413,5,B013TFJ4SQ,"This was the one movie that really told a good part of the Walt story! Yes there are things left out! His time overseas and such. However a lot of other reviewers say that this was boring and too long. Well, they are entitled to their opinions. I felt this was not long enough! There are many things left out. So be it, that you can not tell the full life story of such a complex man and his dream, even before the Mouse! I thought what parts of his life that they did include, were told a story with just the right amount of information and feeling! While the acting was a bit on the slight side of acting, the cast did show the personalities of the main characters well enough to be believable. Overall I found this film to be delightful and educational. We all could learn from him and how he fought for his dreams! 4 Stars for the movie and story and 1 Star for Walt and his Dreams!",1460937600,,886,4.127167630057803

7373416,3,B013TFJ4SQ,"I would have given it two stars, but something about Walt Disney being special to my childhood made me up it to three stars.  First of all, this film was too long.  Acting was mediocre, at best, and sets were terribly fake.  Writing was okay, but overall, the film fell flat for me.",1460332800,,282,4.283018867924528
7373417,4,B013TFJ4SQ,Decent TV is Difficult to find these days!  This one a family could put on & not Cringe & pull the Plug into it....A PLUS on Never-Giving Up when working towards what your goal (heart calling) says!  No way they could Cover 100% in a hour; but hit on key things. It's (a-lot) of details....like .30 cents a foot & no-actors are NOT rolling in million dollar pay checks! Do you think Walt was at those youthful beginning age(s).....think not. Adds to the drama!,1460246400,,460,4.464285714285714
7373418,2,B013TFJ4SQ,"Really wanted to like this - shame. Did not care for the acting & directing at all. The script was probably the biggest issue. No theatrical feeling, bad flow...

7373421,4,B013TFJ4SQ,"The film starts out with Walt as a youth being discouraged, being discouraged as an adult and ends with the creation of our second title character. This is ""the Disney version"" of his life sanitized for our protection. His interesting period as a WWI ambulance and truck driver was only mentioned. There was never any mention of infamous AWOL incident which spurred a famous urban legend I believed as a kid growing up. We see Disney (Thomas Ian Nicholas) as the world's worst business manager, forgetting to factor in things like ""profit"" when making a deal. The acting was not great and having Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) play his brother Roy was a total miscast. It was like watching when he ran Pedro's campaign.

This is a family friendly film one that teaches perseverance no matter how wild your dreams are or who tells you no or who you have to borrow from, or how many bad checks you write, or how often you don't pay your rent...and the art of leaving town when you have a lot of bills.

Yes, I liked it, but it could have been far better. 3 1/2 stars",1459209600,,1063,4.474226804123711

7373442,5,B013TFJ4SQ,"I was surprised how much I liked this film.  I though it would be dull, something to watch as I cleaned the den, but it is the story of a true entrepreneur.  He tried several times and failed, but he just kept on til things worked.  Should be watched by all those folks that follow the mantra that businessmen didn't build it.  ""You didn't build it"" is utter nonsense spouted by fools too lazy to do anything but live off the government dole(or their socialist masters).  The true creators, such of Disney, did build it.

It was a big disappointment.
The only thing that saved it was that it is based on an interesting man.

7373463,2,B013TFJ4SQ,"Slow and not that good. The CNN or PBS documentary about the making of Snow White was much better. But if you like the Disney history (I watched the original mouseketeers when I was little. Still sad about Annette) and are in San Francisco, there is a Disney museum that's worth visiting. Easy parking also. 104 Montgomery Street in the Presidio in SF.",1452556800,,352,4.603174603174603

7373472,1,B013TFJ4SQ,"I watched this after touring the Disney Museum in San Francisco. This movie doesn't show the exciting interesting events as well as the accomplishments of the early years very well. It looks like it was made solely on the interviews with Walt without the knowledge of the other highlights of the period. If you want to get a better picture of this part of Disney's life, visit the museum in San Francisco. Overall, this version is uninspired, poorly written, and badly acted.",1451520000,2,475,4.804878048780488

But when you want to get to the disc menu it stops automatically  and when you try again it plays the movie.

7373477,1,B013TFJ4SQ,"I'm a Disney fan and have read a couple of the better biographies.  That being said, this movie was just sub standard.  It felt like one of those old low budget public TV things they used to make 25 years ago.  Since it was something you had to pay and had 5 stars displayed, I assume it would be better.  The script was weak and the acting was uninspired.  Might be ok if it was free, but don't bother paying for it.",1450569600,22,417,4.036585365853658

7373481,2,B013TFJ4SQ,"The acting is really sub-par. The movie itself is way to melodramatic. If this was ""vetted and approved by Disney"" why didn't it get a higher budget with better actors? Shame.",1449878400,3,175,4.67741935483871
8728726,2,B013TFJ4SQ,"One would expect that Walt Disney was a very interesting man, but you would not know it from this movie.  I found it slow and uninteresting.  I would say the plot was very slow...but I'm not completely sure that there was a plot.  It was hard to follow.  In many cases, it was hard to get what the outcomes were of various events.  Or even if there were outcomes.  There may not have been any outcomes, indeed I can't be certain that there were any events.  The actors were not to blame.  True, they were unrecognizable, but they did a decent acting job.  It was the writing and directing that was missing.  If you should take two hours out of your life to watch this film, you will probably wonder, years later, what happened to those two hours.",1530662400,,746,4.340579710144928
