7956049,5,B00005V1XZ,"One student (John) goes crazy and the high school has him sent to a Mental Institute. 2 years later on, he breaks out. In the process he frees other inmates. He then proceeds to break into other facilities and frees the inmates in them too. This catches the attention of the news crews and a rather warped student (Maddox) who is now attending the high school. Maddox decides that the school has become much like a nut-house / prison. With 2 of his friends, he sets about creating chaos and rebellion in the school. It ends with his two friends realizing he is lost and has no clue what he is really doing. That he himself is going mad. They thwart his final stand at bringing down the schools administrators.",1304294400,,709,4.461538461538462
7956050,5,B00005V1XZ,"This is one of my favorite movies, and I have had it stolen three times to prove how good it is. Very psychological, about how youth feels oppressed and will sometimes sometimes do anything to assert their independence and will. It deals with peer pressure and manipulation in a non-sugary creepy kinda way. Also awesome electronic music soundtrack, drum and bass, breaks, etc.",1218326400,,377,5.0
7956051,3,B00005V1XZ,"This film is more for people who are not into main stream box office hits. The film is bascially how a group of students how rebel against the school and rules, and get all of the students to join in. The use of graphics, photography, music and artwork kept me more gripped to the screen than the actual plot. I Wouldn't not recommend this film, but maybe just rent it instead of buying.",1087862400,3,387,4.315068493150685
7956052,4,B00005V1XZ,"Whoever it was that wrote something about it being a bad movie because the main character wasn't cute enough needs to stick to watching She's all that or other [movies] like that. The ending i do have to admitt was a cliffhanger but the plot was original and the cinemotography was amazing. How good a movie is is NOT based on wheather or not the characters contian a certain ""eye candy"" appeal.",1055808000,8,395,4.5
7956053,2,B00005V1XZ,"New Port South begins and carries on very strongly. It is the story of Maddux, a student at NPS High who has had enough of the curriculum and the administration, who decides to lead a student rebellion. Following the example of another former student who did similar things 2 years earlier, Maddux's nonviolent protests gain more and more explosive reactions from the school's faculty. As Maddux steadily becomes unstable, his friends begin to question his judgment and things finally come to a riveting climax. And then the ending comes and just leaves you hanging with unanswered questions that will probably keep you up wondering what the final outcome would have been like if the director had just added 5 or 10 more minutes. But as it is, I loved this movie until the very end. Not a bad movie, and it's a fun one to rent with some friends and guess about what could have happened if it had been just a little bit longer. But I can't say I would reccommend purchasing it.",1034121600,2,976,4.614942528735632
7956054,2,B00005V1XZ,"If the title didn't get you enough, I recommend not watching the movie.  It's about a group of kiddies at a high school creating a revolution aganist the teachers and what the school stands for.  The actual plot itself is okay, but damn, can we get a hot main character please?  Instead we have to look at the blond quazymotto guy with the huge nose.  The only reason I gave this piece which you call a movie 2 stars is because the other two guys in the movie were actually eye candy.  This is one of those movies that you walk right on by because there is only one copy of it... save yourself...WALK RIGHT ON BY!",1027814400,,613,4.205128205128205
