5124497,5,B00838N33C,Light entertainment without any political or moral message.  Lots of laughs,1413936000,,75,5.818181818181818
5124498,3,B00838N33C,Has some funny parts but overall a time waster. The movie set up seems good at first but loses you by the end. Not enough funny to sustain you.,1429401600,,143,3.9655172413793105
5124499,2,B00838N33C,"Sappy, difficult to understand, captions did not come up.",1429401600,,57,5.444444444444445
5124500,5,B00838N33C,A grand old fashioned comedy that gets a chuckle a minute. A gentle blend of crime and church that endears the cast to the audience. We need more movies like this.,1428364800,,163,4.290322580645161
5124501,3,B00838N33C,Dated but fun movie to watch,1427241600,,28,3.8333333333333335
5124502,3,B00838N33C,I am usually very good at understanding British but the accent in this movie was way beyond me.  Definitely a need for captions at least in some of the more difficult parts.  Must admit I didn't watch the entire movie.  I fell asleep half way through.  Evidently it wasn't amusing enough to catch my attention and keep me awake.  I'm not interested enough to try again.,1425945600,,369,4.53030303030303
5124503,5,B00838N33C,Anyone who likes ealing comedies or carry on films will love this.,1425945600,,66,4.583333333333333
5124504,1,B00838N33C,"The three of us lasted about twenty minutes and then had to turn the Crooks In Cloisters off.  That was about ten minutes longer than it deserved.  Bad acting, unintelligible dialogue, and an unfunny comedy.",1424217600,,207,4.885714285714286

8524363,3,B00838N33C,"It is a fun 1960's tale that is full of delightful British street slang from that era.  The plot is ludicrous, but it does succeed in showing the merits of a simple life in England's island villages.",1436745600,,199,4.378378378378378
8524364,1,B00838N33C,"As much as I love British comedy, this movie fell short. Acting left much to be desired, weak plot with an abrupt and flat ending.",1436659200,,130,4.24
