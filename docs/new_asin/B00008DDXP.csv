7981819,5,B00008DDXP,"For those of you who love presidential assassin movies mixed with secret service intrigue, this movie is for you.
Though it was made for television, it was a nice movie mixed with drama and suspense.
You may want to watch it first before you buy it if you can, but you may find you like it more than you expected to.
Good cast, good writing, good drama.",1406592000,,353,4.2835820895522385

7981821,5,B00008DDXP,"Several years ago while in Las Vegas, my husband and I were getting ready to leave for the airport. We had the television on and started watching a movie. Of course, just as we really got interested in it, we had to leave. I wrote down the name of the movie on a little piece of paper and we left. Many times over the last few years, I ran across that little piece of paper with ""First Shot"" on it, but never tried to find the movie anywhere. Recently while at a video store with my grandson, I thought about this movie I wanted to see, but could not remember the name of it. I went home and found the little piece of paper in a drawer and looked it up on line and found it! I immediately ordered it and in no time the movie was in my mailbox. I have finally watched it from beginning to end and really enjoyed it. The ease of ordering and the service was great. My husband has not had a chance to watch it yet, but he will be glad to see it in its entirety.",1247961600,6,958,3.943298969072165
