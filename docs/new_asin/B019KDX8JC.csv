7576298,4,B019KDX8JC,"Rumi just wants to study, but she sits next to oddball Seki in the back of the classroom. Every day, Seki brings something new and bewildering to class to occupy himself, and Rumi can't help getting caught up in his flights of fancy. Seki's games are hilariously strange and brilliantly detailed, and as a former daydreaming kid, I found a lot to relate to. Most of the show stays seated at the back of the classroom, but Seki's goofy constructions and Rumi's imagination keeps it interesting, and the animation is perfectly pleasant to watch. The show is just *fun*, and I had a lot of legitimate laugh-out-loud moments.

99% of the dialog is Rumi's running commentary as she switches between confusion, enchantment, irritation, smug satisfaction, and a whole range of other emotions. She seems totally straight-laced at first, but as she gets into Seki's antics, the viewer might find that Rumi is just as imaginative and silly as Seki is, even if she holds it in during class. There isn't a ton of character development or plot in the series, but Seki, Rumi, and occasionally other characters are all charming enough to get attached to. It's a great change of pace from more typical anime series.

The biggest downside is probably how short it is. If you cut out the opening and ending songs, each episode is really only about six minutes. That's the perfect length for individual episodes, but it also means the runtime for the entire Blu-ray is only 168 minutes, including songs. The only extras are textless songs, so that's not a lot of content for ~$27. I picked it up because I loved what I had streamed on Crunchyroll, but even I know it wasn't a great deal. I definitely recommend streaming a couple episodes to see if it speaks to you.

The English dub is fine. The frequent use of honorifics like ""-kun"" or ""-san"" might require a little explanation if you're unfamiliar with them, but Monica Rial's portrayal of Rumi works, even if it's a little harsher than I expected for the only speaking role in the series. Still, she gets the highs and lows in there, and effectively conveys both Rumi's girlish and wrathful sides.

Hilarious show, but a little pricey for how long it is. Definitely worth checking out if you daydreamed in school and want to round out your anime collection with something different.",1462492800,6,2318,4.744416873449132
7576299,4,B019KDX8JC,"Rumi Yokoi is a diligent student. Really! It isn't her fault that the boy sitting at the desk next to her, Seki, is the master of slacking off in class. He acts out a dramatic war scene using shoji pieces, starts postal service for notes, and builds a driving course to practice for a driving test. No matter how Yokoi tries to ignore him, his complicated schemes always draw her attention.

Sekis schemes are all pretty fun, though it is really Yokois internal commentary that makes it. There is little to no dialog and Yokoi is mostly the only one who really says anything (and none of it aloud). Seki has barely a handful of lines the entire series.

This is a very entertaining little show, though it is one of the few shows I would advise against marathoning. The episodes are under 10 minutes long, but they all rely on the same style of joke - Yokoi is in class, she notices Seki-kun setting something up, she starts mentally scolding him, then she becomes interested, and finally she gets scolded by the teacher for not paying attention in class. Plenty of fun, but more fun if you spread it out.

I watched this show as it was airing on Crunchyroll, but I liked enough that I intend to buy it.",1461196800,5,1202,4.429864253393665

8745444,4,B019KDX8JC,"Yokoi Rumi is your typical high school girl, except, she has a rather large problem, she finds herself seated next to a male classmate named Seki Toshinari. And no her problem is not that of a romantic nature. Rumi tries to be a diligent student and pay attention in class but finds herself distracted by Seki who everyday brings something to play with during class. Things like an entire dramatic war being played out with shogi pieces, a golf course using the holes in their desks, paper sumo, a robot family, and even building a driving course for an RC car! No matter how hard she tries to ignore Seki-kun so that she can study, she always finds herself drawn into his game, and frequently ends up in trouble with her teachers. Can she get him to put his toys away and pay attention in class? Can she find the willpower to ignore Seki-kun?

Tonari no Seki-kun has episodes that average around 7 minutes long in length. But don't let the length fool you into disregarding this anime as having no plot. Each episode consists of Seki bringing his newest distraction of the day while Rumi attempts to ignore what's going on next to her, failing every time as she finds herself drawn into what he's doing. The plot for each episode was wonderfully done and immensely entertaining! xD The characters basically consist of Rumi and Seki with the occasional appearance or comment from a classmate. Both of the main characters were wonderfully entertaining. It was a wonder to me how entertaining Seki was even though he never said a single word ... not in any of the 21 episodes! The animation was nice, nothing spectacular, mind you, but nicely done all the same.

All in all I very much enjoyed this anime! Every episode brought a huge smile to my face and even the occasional laugh! I very much recommend adding it to your collection!",1488758400,,1832,4.616564417177914

8745447,5,B019KDX8JC,This was on the Anime Channel and I missed a few of the last episodes. It is too short but so much fun to watch. I would hope there are more of these in the future. I loved the ending big band jazz song that I bought the accompanying CD that has the beginning and ending songs. That is Ok but it is just the two songs with different versions of the same two songs. I will buy this anime after I get a few others and this is not so fresh in my mind. It is worth the diversion to see again.,1468108800,,488,3.7475728155339807
