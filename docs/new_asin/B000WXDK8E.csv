8225992,3,B000WXDK8E,"I will admit it I'm not a big fan of Samurai Pizza Cats. It's a little too wacky for my taste and the narrator and most of the characters really get on my nerves! I like the original Japanese version Kyatto Ninden Teyandee a lot better!

However, there are a few characters I do like such as Carla (Bad Bird's childhood sweetheart), Guido Anchovy, and the Rescue Team. They are so underrated! Sometimes I wish the Rescue Team were the main characters not the three main Pizza Cats.

I mean they usually accomplished things the others could not! Not to mention they had really cool powers based on the four elements. Guido was in my opinion probably the most powerful Pizza Cat, and Carla is the only calm girl on the show just about!

Out of the Rescue Team Bat Cat the one that loved adventure and excitement, talked like a surfer dude, had the element of air, and knew tons of tongue twisters
and Spritz T. Cat who had the element of water, looked a scuba diver, had a really adorable face and cute voice were my favorites!

""You guessed right! It is I General Catton and they finally given me more than just a walk on role in this episode!""
""Right! No more playing second fiddle for us! Our time has come!""
""We're tired of sitting around warming the bench! We want our own program! Who are we guys?""
""We're The Rescue Team!""
I couldn't agree more! Go Rescue Team!

In The Pizza Cat Performance Review episode which is my favorite:
""It's the three bears and Goldilocks Bad Bird and we've come to blow your house down!""
""I think he means the Big Bad Wolf but you get the idea.""
""Get ready for the all new vastly improved four not three...""
""Samurai Pizza Cats!""",1352592000,,1662,4.4183006535947715
8225993,5,B000WXDK8E,"This show is the greatest thing to happen to anime- self parody. You see, when this show was brought to America, the Japanese script:
1. Had too many Japanese pop-culture references for American audiences to really grasp,
and
2. Didn't actually come with the Japanese script,
so they just made up their own using how they interpreted the plot and the scenery. This is illustrated through characters reading Hirigana (referred to as ""squiggles"") and with the constant breaking of the fourth wall. Anime is typically an overdone and overrated genre, so it needs to be made fun of now and then. I remember waking up at like 5 in the morning with my older brothers to watch this show, and when this box set came out in 2007 on here, I couldn't pass it up. Unfortunately, F-22 studios (the supposed producer of this set) is a practically non-existent search on google, so I'm assuming that this set was produced from someone's basement. I really hope whoever the anonymous person who made it hasn't passed away, as I would instantly pay 40ish dollars for the second half of the series. These DVDs are top-notch quality (for a show that doesn't really exist past VHS recordings and low-quality MOV files), so I really really really want to complete my collection. It's been over four years since this was made, so please, if you are F-22, or if you have knowledge and dedication on how to make a DVD set, reprinting this set and making a second box would definitely be worth your time and effort. Anyways, love this product.",1317168000,4,1518,4.689138576779026
8225994,5,B000WXDK8E,"It's the whole series.  Growing up, I could have sworn the series ran much longer than that, but things are different when you're a kid.  The quality looks like it's about VHS quality, but to be honest, that's fine.  I haven't been able to find this anywhere else.",1234656000,2,264,4.458333333333333
8225995,5,B000WXDK8E,"The shipping time for this product was excellent, arrived in no time! Good quality too!",1233964800,,87,4.866666666666666
8225996,5,B000WXDK8E,"Picked this up a while back, and it's really good. I remember the series being on in syndication when I was going to high school, and finding it on DVD was too good to pass up. I think it may not be an official release, but the quality's good so who cares? Bring on Volume 2!!",1219708800,7,276,3.9464285714285716
8225997,5,B000WXDK8E,"Wow this show brings back some memories. Anyway, the overall quality of the boxset is good and is a worthy edition if you like the series, or even remember it. Worth the buy. The dialog can get cheesy at times but you get use to it.",1217980800,5,232,4.065217391304348
8225998,5,B000WXDK8E,I was surprised to see this product.  I have been waiting for a while for it to come out and I bought it the moment I saw it.  The episodes are in pretty good quality considering it's early 90's quality.  The audio is a little odd at some points but overall it is not bad.  I think that this is an official release though I have found no fact pointing to it yet.  The quality does not look like it's recorded off a VCR.  If you are a fan of the SPC's and have been looking for good quality episodes then this is perfect for you.,1213574400,3,528,3.9339622641509435
