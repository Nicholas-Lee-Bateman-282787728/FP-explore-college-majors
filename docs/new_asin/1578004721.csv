7799079,4,1578004721,"In all three seasons of Slayers, there are those few random episodes that while have nothing to do with the plot, are hilarious. These were so random that I wondered if I had missed a episode or something. Despite this they're very funny with the usual Slayers humor (Lina's reactions to military penguins and dancing vegetable people).
It can be compared the first season's episode of when Lina and Co. join a troup of actors...or in Next when they play Brass Rackets.
Buy it, it's worth the insanity value. ^_~",1030147200,,512,4.7
7799080,5,1578004721,"Well... Not really to say much about this vid. Just that you HAVE to have  it if your a Slayers fan. As usual, this video is great... I could say that  this movie is a bit like all the others, but I won't, cause I think Slayers  is just a winning formula (like the Final Fantasy series). Each new movie  and episode has lots of clever humor and good artwork. Slayers Try is (I  think) the least known Slayers, That is probably because many people think  it's a little weird (weirder than normal) and ""diffrent"" from the  other Slayers movies. Which are of course, just as great as this one.  Enough talking now, just buy it or fall into eternal disgrace!
