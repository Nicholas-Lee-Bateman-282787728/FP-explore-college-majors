2485052,1,B000E33VY0,"The acting, dialogue and special effect are exactly like those of TV shows. They're dull and pretentious. There's no excitement, and suspense at all. For example, the opening scene showed a hostage girl killed by her kidnapper but I did not felt touched at all. I got no emotion or entertaining from watching this DVD.

I prefer Chuck Norris in Delta Force 2 and the movie in which he fought with Bruce Lee. (I forget its title). They're  full of action and look very real.",1173484800,2,473,4.552941176470588
2485053,2,B000E33VY0,"In ""The Cutter"" 65-year-old Chuck Norris plays John Shepherd, cop-turned-private eye who is embroiled in a conspiracy to kidnap an aged diamond cutter. Shepherd saves the life of the cutter's niece Elizabeth (Joanna Pakula) and with her reveals the secrets about the world's hugest diamonds. The story is not good, sometimes terribly and needlessly contrived. It is still serviceable, but obviously it is not ""Marathon Man.""

Sadly actions are not great either. Chuck Norris throwing punches and shooting a gun surely looks in better shape than Steven Seagal, but that's not saying much because the action scenes and the stunt work themselves are just boring. Shoot-pouts are generic, and the car chase is impossible and unexciting. When the name of Daniel Bernhardt who can do impressive martial arts stunts appears in the opening credits, I expected something good. Sorry, but no such luck; he is completely wasted, not given enough chance to show his skills.

Which leaves us with not-so-great acting from the supporting actors like Joanna Pakula, Tracy Scoggins and Bernie Kopell and silly one-liners from the star. Don't miss the one when a hapless thug is thrown out of the window. That made me really groan.",1172102400,6,1214,5.126262626262626

""The Cutter"" is no masterpiece but it's an entertaining movie and above average for production company Nu Image Entertainment, whose movies sometimes suffer from incoherent writing. Chuck Norris fans will be pleased to see Chuck, and the rest of the cast make a good job too.

Also, the car action scenes seemed better than usual. The editing didn't draw attention to itself, which is IMO the mark of a decent movie.

2485069,1,B000E33VY0,"When I see Chuck Norris movies as bad as The Cutter, it really makes me wonder how he got all the internet fandom that he has today. Now don't get me wrong I like Norris and I'm a huge action movie fan. I decided to check this one out since it was on Netflix streaming. One of the first things that caught my attention is that this wasn't one of Chuck's classic action movies. This one was released in 2005 back when Chuck was 65 so I figured that it wouldn't be up to par with his classic films, but would make for a fun viewing. First off, it looks as if no money went into this movie. Considering this is a straight to DVD movie, I'm guessing most of the money went to Chuck. The acting is also horrible in this film. You know you've got a problem when Norris is the best actor in your movie. However, you don't go into a Chuck Norris movie looking for anything but some good acting. That's where The Cutter once again fails. The action in this movie is some of the worst i've seen in a long time. The editing is so awful that I would have to call it some of the worst editing i've ever seen in a film. It's done so poorly it takes you out of the action and just makes you look for all the mistakes that were done in the editing. I like Norris and it's a shame to see him in such an awful piece of trash. Even if you are a fan this is one to avoid!",1395273600,,1351,3.934306569343066

This movie showed his character to be more human than most of his roles which is what really gained my attention. Most of Chuck Norris movies show him to be bigger than life and super human, Which is what made this movie a little different. If you are a true Chuck Norris fan, Then you need to buy this movie.

2485075,3,B000E33VY0,"Mighty US warlord Premier Norris has become something of a mythical character in the world of b and especially in these reviews. So it was very curious that we have yet to review his latest film. Don't excuse us thinking that it was some recent straight to video Kramer home premier, this baby was released in 2005. How the mighty have fallen if Chuck hasn't done a b in 7 years and counting. He will appear in the Expendables 2 but that's like the eskimos sending an elder out on an ice raft. Chuck showed no signs of being ready to stop ramming the world with his b hammer in The Cutter however. He still had the glowing beard of flames and a mini-mullet. That's Italian. We wanted to find out what was so soul crushing that it made a man who clearly has no shame (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Top-Dog/dp/B00005QJHN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Top Dog</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forest-Warrior/dp/B002SAMMFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forest Warrior</a>) stop making beautiful b music for 7 years.

Chuck plays former FBI this is search warrant hot shot turned private investigator John Shepard. The opening scene shows us Chuck attempting to foil a kidnapping. He ultimately failed and got the kid killed but he did manage to throw the fattest kidnapper out of a window in true Myers-hillbillies-truck fashion so all in all not a bad day. Actually the killing of the kid shook Shepard to his core so when he took his next job protecting an expert diamond cutter, he promised himself he would not fail this time. We don't know how much Chuck charged but being that he was dealing with a diamond cutter we'd like to think Chuck told him""let's talk turkey $20000 you take the whole package."" Along with the old man diamond cutter Chuck had to protect his protege who was a gypsy! The reason they needed protection is because they were the only 2 gypsies on earth who could perform this impossible cut that made a diamond priceless and there was a serial killing thief after them. There was also an evil force behind the thief. It was a former nazi officer who made the cutter perform his cut on stones in a concentration camp. He was a mean guy. We wouldn't be surprised if he told the cutter to clean his freaking loop many times a day. Obviously Chuck kicks multiple butts and looked stunning doing it. He also  manages to deliver his lines in a very halting way of speaking a la Frank Costanza. The one thing we always expect from an Aaron Norris production is explosions. Well there was only one because we're guessing that's all they had money for but it was a really cool romantic explosion. Of course the two bad guys got blown up and Chuck kept his promise to the gypsies and to himself.

It is always fun to watch Chuck doing his butt whupping bad acting. It's always fun to marvel at what a complete tough guy the total gym can turn you into. What's not fun however is watching a b in which the biggest question is will Chuck give this gypsy a light rash. The plot in this one was just shallow and pedantic. It was pretty boring to tell you the truth. If Chuck wasn't in the movie it would have been a 1star effort. The funniest moments came when Chuck in his typical nice guy way told one of his old FBI buddies to go stuff himself. Then he called him a maggot. It was quite a hot rivalry. As hot as Santa and the bagelry guy? No but still good. This one is still definitely worth a view if for no other reason than it is Chuck's latest film and he was doing legitimate tough guy Chuck stuff but realize going in that you're going to have to have some decent backup laptop entertainment going. Maybe some wormholes or something. Oh and to answer that all important question, no Chuck doesn't get with the gypsy. Smart move, Chuck. Who knows when some gypsy will shrink you and sell you at a yard sale?",1339372800,,3922,4.705967976710335

2485079,3,B000E33VY0,"As fate would have it, what's probably the last Chuck Norris film ever to be made isn't really a Chuck Norris film. Sure, Chuck's the star, but as is the case these DTV action outings, the distinctive auteurism that once defined his earlier pictures as ""Yep, that's a Chuck Norris movie"" has given way to a style that feels much more generic. Sure, it's decent for a film that went straight-to-video, but the only really remarkable thing about it is that it stars the Chuckasaurus; it could just as well have been made with Dolph Lundgren or Van Damme and still retained its mold. This isn't really a bad thing, but it means that as far as Norris' personal style and brand of attitude is concerned, fans might as well have waved good-bye to him following&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-President-s-Man-2/dp/B00025I6ZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The President's Man 2</a>.

The story: when an expert diamond-cutter and Auschwitz survivor (Bernie Kopell, ""The Love Boat"") is kidnapped by a deadly mastermind (Daniel Bernhardt) looking to customize a pair of priceless stones, private investigator John Shepherd (Norris) is called in to unravel a mystery spanning Nazi Germany to the present-day jewelry district.

Who's Daniel Bernhardt? Well, he started out as a model, but is better known as the star of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>&nbsp;sequels and of ""Mortal Kombat: Conquest"". Oh, and he had that awesome fight with Laurence Fishburne on top of the truck in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matrix-Reloaded/dp/B001EU5TJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matrix Reloaded</a>. Yup, the filmmakers actually got Norris a decent martial artist-villain this time around, and knowing he was going to be in the movie is half the reason why I bought it. Sadly, there's not a whole lot of fighting to be seen: there are two fights lasting longer than 15 seconds and three even shorter than that. Chuck fights both Daniel and long-haired baddie Deron McBee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat-Annihilation/dp/0780622057/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat: Annihilation</a>) and gets the heck beat out of him before putting each of them in their place. Daniel is hands-down the most exciting performer, but all of the fights are marred by unwanted quick-cut editing. On the plus side, at age 65, it doesn't look like Norris was using many stunt doubles, which is impressive. Also look for a couple of decent car chases.

The acting's on the good side for a $6 million production. Chuck's his own compassionate-conservative self, but in a small scene, reveals that he cannot pull off a Russian accent to save his life. Bernhardt, however, can do a good Russian imitation, and as a ""master of disguise"" gets to show off a bit more than usual as he cons people. Of course, part of the reason why he was chosen for the role was because he and cohort Curt Lowens (""General Hospital"") both speak fluent German and can pass themselves off as Nazis. Bernie Kopell as the imprisoned cutter, Golden Globe nominee Joanna Pacula (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gorky-Park/dp/B00004ZBVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gorky Park</a>) as his adopted daughter, Tracy Scoggins (""Babylon 5"") as Norris' PD informant, and pretty much everybody else involved gives a good performance, making for a well-rounded cast that manages to overshadow the star more than once.

The film defines itself as a DTV title through its weirdo editing that unsuccesfully tries to make the movie look more interesting: the film occasionally goes into ""avid fart"" mode, with multiple close-ups, the speeding up of footage, and wacky color effects trying to remind you of bigger thrillers. There are way too many flashbacks abound, sometimes just to remind you of something from earlier in the movie that you haven't even forgotten in the first place. And while the story's decidedly better than your run-of-the-mill DTV flick, it doesn't do too great a job of explaining the existence of some minor characters - most notably the fellow who breaks into Norris' house, tasers him, and then gets killed by Daniel Bernhardt.

I don't mean to scare anyone off of watching the movie, for it really is a better-than-average low-budget flick. Fans of the Chuckster ought to pick it up at least, but those of you looking for your first taste of Norris might want to start somewhere else - after all, there's not a whole lot of pro-American bravado here, even if Chuck is fighting Nazis.",1257292800,4,4721,5.671852899575672

2485082,4,B000E33VY0,"Pacino, DeNiro, Olivier, Shattner, these are the gods of today's Acting Pantheon. To that august list one may now add the name....NORRIS!!!

Chuck blows away all previous concepts of what it means to be an actor. Seriously I never felt as ""inside"" another character as I have for Chuck's character, Junior Detective Tiffany Neversmile.

Tiffany, as portrayed by Mr. Norris, is a high school teen-aged Goth girl with an interest in criminal justice and who is studying a Mail-Order course in circumcison in order to become the world's first Mail-order mohel, and a goil mohel at that .She gets involved in the typical teen-age diamond smuggling scenario, and through her partnership with Detective Inspector/Asst. Bowling Coach Shlomoe ""The Tranny Granny""  Running Bear, not only brings the smugglers to justice, but also triumphs over her own pain, depression and fashion shortcomings.

To make it easy for you, this film is a sort of synthesis of films like Mean Girls, The Hot Chick, Ghost World and Requiem for a Dream, with an added liberal dose of martial arts, transvestitism, Deth Metal and marionettes.  The soundtrack and score are a wonderful collaboration between Faith Hill and Goblin.

But it's Norris' performance as high-school Goth girl Tiffany Neversmile that elevates this far above the level of the usual teen-age melodrama. His legs, skinny, bird-like and thankfully shaven, promote the illusion that Chuck Norris is a little girl. Chuck keeps the beard for the role and I think it only helps, since Norris as a woman possesses an unearthly beauty and the whiskers help to ground it. If you've ever wanted to see Chuck Norris in a vinyl Gothic mini-dress, this film is for you.

The Academy shouldn't just give Mr. Norris a retro-Oscar for his work in this movie; they should shave him, grind off his privates and cover him in gold plating.",1225411200,2,1860,5.0

2485084,3,B000E33VY0,"THE CUTTER

I was sitting not to long ago and realized hey I have a review of a Steven Seagal movie and a couple Van Dam movies, and a Wesley Snipes movie review, were is Chuck. And by Chuck I mean Chuck Norris, any one who got to train with and be in a movie with Bruce Lee is cool with me. So I decided that the first one of his movies my brother could name would be the one I would review, I wish he could have chosen a little better. This movie has got to be one of his worst movies he has ever made, this direct to DVD feature is not a classic in any sense of the word. Well any way he named this one so I went into the collection and sure enough there it was, DVD player here we come.

The story is simple enough, Norris is a retired cop who is now a p.i. and out and about solving cases his way. Of course that does not leave him looking to good to the police and most of them hate him, so naturally he rebels against the very people he used to work for. And after a case he is on goes wrong he takes another case looking for a diamond cutter, hence the title. And that is pretty much it and that seems pretty simple right, could have even been an episode of his old TV show Walker. But unfortunately that is almost what it is, it seems like it could have been better as a TV movie, maybe the USA network could have done something with this.

Don't get it wrong it is not a horrible film, there is some to like about this movie. Norris portrays his character well enough to make it believable, and even the action is pretty good as well. Bruce Haskett seemed like he was trying to write a decent film, maybe with a better budget this could have been a pretty good action flick. Same could be said about director William Tannen who did what he could I `am sure with what he had. Of course I should have expected a low budget flick like this coming from producers Avi Lerner and Boaz Davidson. Both of these guys have no doubt produced some winners at the box office you may remember both from Rambo, but mostly direct to DVD. You may remember both from almost every direct to DVD Steven Seagal & Van Dam & Wesley Snipes movies.

The bad thing about this movie is that it is not to memorable, after it was over I really didn't remember any scenes from it or any of the performers from it except Norris. Not all of the actors were bad, but they didn't stand out either. The worst I can say about this film is that after it is over you probably won't watch it again, and at best it is not the worst movie ever. The action was decent even though Norris is a bit older now my friends, it was still decent.",1221696000,,2606,4.025096525096525
