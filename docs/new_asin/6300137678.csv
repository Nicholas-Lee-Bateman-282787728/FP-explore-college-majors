7802816,1,6300137678,"This video features the adventures of two Hispanic youngsters and, now get this, a talking, magical Rubik's Cube(You know, the puzzle thing from the 1980s?).  Rubik the Amazing Cube spoke like he had a mental handicap, with the annoying characteristic of referring to himself(or itself?) in the third person.  The only good memories I have of this cartoon are that of me and my best friend making snarky remarks about it ahla MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 back when it aired on television in the 1980s.",1080777600,,501,4.882352941176471
