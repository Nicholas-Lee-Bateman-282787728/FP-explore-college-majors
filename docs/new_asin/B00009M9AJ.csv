1883982,5,B00009M9AJ,"I remember vividly watching Gary Cooper explain the ""Real West"" in Black and White as a very young boy. I like to think his story telling style is one of the reasons I became a history teacher. When I saw this great tale was available on CD-rom, I had to have it and did it bring back memories. I am so glad I bought this program.",1349481600,,330,4.015151515151516
1883983,5,B00009M9AJ,"Great episode from the Project Twenty series.  Most importantly, there are no logos or anything else superimposed during the presentation.  There are some credits at the beginning of the program, so that may account for there being none at the end.",1342742400,,248,5.024390243902439

1883985,5,B00009M9AJ,"I use this movie in my 8th grade social studies class and it really helps my students see what the Wild West was like.  Despite it being still photos and other images, it shows the true character of the settling of the Great Plains.  Gary Cooper was a great choice for the narrator/host for the film.  Western buffs and American History teachers would really enjoy this documentary.",1224806400,6,382,4.6716417910447765
1883986,3,B00009M9AJ,"This is visually an interesting video on the West, but I feel sad that it reflects more of the prejudice of the time period it was made in. The photos are all of white people in the west. It's missing the pictures of the Chinese in California, the black and Hispanic cowboys, and the Hispanics in California in the late 1800's. Gary Cooper does a nice job narrating and there is humor in describing the Old West.",1208217600,,412,4.363636363636363
1883987,5,B00009M9AJ,"I was fortunate enough to see this on TV when it was broadcast in 1960 and after all these years I can still recall phrases from it. It was, apparently, the last thing Cooper did, and he does a wonderful job. I believe his voice actually breaks in sincere sorrow when he is reciting the famous speech by Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce, toward the end. His empathy and knowledge of the West (he was from Montana) are everywhere apparent.

Beyond that, this is one of the best-written documentaries I've ever seen. Every line, almost, is memorably quotable. Some are extremely funny, others extremely tragic, but they have a brilliant solidity and incisiveness that makes this a really extraordinary piece of work. Lines like ""sleeping on prairie feathers with no mattress but your backbone"" and ""Sam Colt made everybody the same size,"" have a whipcracking honesty that rings very true.

The photo montages are excellent, many of them quite rare images, like gigantic piles of buffalo bones beside a railroad track. The cross-cutting at the end, depicting the struggle between whites and Indians, is handled magnificently.

Defects are trifling. The sound gets fuzzy from time to time, as if the track were being spliced, but Cooper's narration is quite clear throughout. This is a very bare-bones DVD, just the show and the usual scene-selection feature, no commentary, no extras to speak of.

But it is one of the clearest, most comprehensive and truthful pictures of the West I've ever seen. Cooper really ended his career on a high note.",1107475200,25,1538,4.903846153846154

7991318,5,B00009M9AJ,"It's a very well-made product. It sums up the west very well, and it's fairly short in length compared to the other documentaries on the west. I like it.",1415232000,,153,4.310344827586207

7991320,5,B00009M9AJ,"This was the very last filmwork that Cooper did, just before the died.  During the filming, he was in tremendous pain, but was determined to finish it.  On the last day of filming, he turned around to the crew on the set, the director, shook everyone's hand.  And then, prophetically said ""Well, I'm going Home.""  In less than 2 months, he died of cancer.  The director knew he was ill but Coop didn't want the rest of the crew to treat him any different.",1402012800,,455,4.369047619047619
7991321,5,B00009M9AJ,"Most people who saw this on black and white television as part of the Project xx series did not realize the narrator, the famous actor Gary Cooper was dying of cancer and it was the last thing he ever did.  He was the perfect person to act as narrator since he was born on a ranch close to where some of the scenes were located.  He won an Academy Award in the movie ""High Noon""  portraying a sheriff facing down the bad guys.  Because there were no motion pictures available at the time it was a series of portraits of people and life as it was at the time.  The music was composed by Robert Russell Bennett and included music of the time into the narrative.  The object was to portray the 19th century West as it was not as it was later ;portrayed on television and the myriad of movies that followed.  The use of narratives from letters and books also are interwoven into the narrative such as ""There ain't many women in this town and they do not come close to handsome but that aint held against them"".  Also a quote from the diary of Mary Walker, the wife of a missionary in Oregon who describes a long day where she started the day at 5:00 AM ""Gets her house in order bakes bread and a kettle of mush, and that night ""was delivered of another son"". The treatment of the Native American is treated with sympathetic realism.  If a person is interested in a realistic look at the West.  Taught a class in the American West in High School needless to say it went over very well even using a 16mm projector and slides as well as primary source material.",1375315200,3,1554,4.273037542662116
