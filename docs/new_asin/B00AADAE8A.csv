5404115,4,B00AADAE8A,"Good movie......well done.  Not an epic treasure of a movie, but the acting was good and I especially appreciated the ending....love that!",1363478400,3,138,5.2727272727272725
5404116,1,B00AADAE8A,"To cut to the chase, I have no idea what the two positive reviewers saw in this film that I didn't see.  This has got to be one of the worst films I've seen in some time.  It's a home invasion film, with a grieving family retreating to a remote vacation home, only to meet some ""new neighbors"" who are not what they seem.  And what, exactly, are they?  Annoying, for starters, but then again, so are the main characters.  Not a likeable person in this film to be found.  Anyway, these ""new neighbors"" get invited for dinner and there are all kind of alarm bells going off as to why it may not be a good thing that they're inside the same house with the other family, but still, they stay for dinner, only to then get tossed out but then return, in full psychotic behavior.  I had a very difficult time following this, the dialog is incoherent and annoying, and overall the film is very muddled and confusing, to say the least.  I used to snap up almost any IFC Film because they tended to be off-beat & interesting, and now, well, I think I will use a lot of discretion when choosing.  This is probably one of the worst films I have seen in a while.  I usually try to at least find something worthwhile in a film, even unintentional humor will kick it up a notch in my rating, but this, well, nothing of value to be found.  Avoid.",1363219200,25,1330,4.217391304347826
5404117,1,B00AADAE8A,"Paid $9.99 to rent this primarily based on the two really glowing reviews left on here by people who called this the best movie they'd seen in a while etc.  Beware:  I think those reviewers might be marketing people working for the studio that put this out.

I really like psychological thrillers, mysteries, horror, etc.  I like Selma Blair as well.  I had no expectations of what this movie was or what it could be, but I took a chance on it and wish I could get a refund.  It was terrible.  There's no real mystery to this as you should be able to figure out what happens in the first ten minutes.  It's very obvious what's going on.

The first 30 minutes or so are somewhat interesting, as this uncomfortable feeling builds at a dinner party that only one side of the table wanted to happen...and then you start to wonder how the other people are going to get out of the bad situation.  I laughed because it reminded me a little of holiday meals with relatives I don't like and who I wish would leave...but they can't take the hint.

By the 46 minute mark I just gave up on the movie and realized this was one I'd have to sit through and endure until it was over because I spent the $9.99 on it and I just can't turn it off and not see the rest of it.

This is the kind of movie that ends up playing very late at night on a random cable channel and is only watched by people who have nothing else to do and can't get to sleep.  I would never recommend this to anyone...definitely don't waste money on it and don't believe the reviewers who are giving it 5-stars and saying it is the best thing ever.

I fell for that scam this time.  I saw two glowing reviews and one bad one and I thought the person who wrote the bad review was wrong...but now I have to side with that person because this movie stunk.",1355356800,15,1807,4.1671469740634
5404118,5,B00AADAE8A,"This film made my #1 favorite horror film of the year for my October special, and is a good candidate to make my top films of the year list as well. The dark psycho family thriller had me sitting on the edge of my seat often as it's full of uneasy and sometimes shocking moments. The acting is all around impressive and the atmosphere is well set in a wooded remote location. This is a thriller nearly perfectly executed.

5404161,4,B00AADAE8A,I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before stumbling upon this movie last night. I've been watching horror and thrillers for months now just looking for something interesting. I was getting ready for bed when I watched this movie. I was so sleepy and the idea of it all just sent shivers down my spine. There were a couple of scenes that didn't seem very plausible and there were moments I yelled at the characters. This movie held my attention until the very end.

5404179,5,B00AADAE8A,"I recorded this off of Cinemax and finally watched it.  I had no idea what kind of movie it was.  I only knew Selma Blair was in it and was curious.  I don't really care for realistic violent movies.  I have to be in a particular mood usually to watch one, especially these days because they can make them REALLY real.  But I got into this one before I realized what was going on.

I have to say that it WAS realistic.  It WAS hard to watch.  It DID make me uneasy at times.  But it WAS a good movie.  Very good acting and a thrilling story.  It makes you feel things you don't want to feel, but it thankfully offered a release in the end.  I was in the mood to watch a comedy once this one was over, but don't let anyone misinform you that this was a bad movie.  Very well done.  I just wish I knew what they tell the kids who act in these extremely intense dramas about these kinds of people who do exist in this world.  It seems like they have to grow up too soon and forgo their childhood.  Maybe it's a good thing and they will be even more emotionally stable.  I just wonder.",1389225600,,1081,4.0
5404180,1,B00AADAE8A,I bought this movie because of Selma Blair.  She was unable to make this movie interesting to me.  I didn't bother watching it to the end as it seemed to never end.,1383177600,,164,4.09375
5404181,3,B00AADAE8A,"A toothless, unoriginal thriller, IN THEIR SKIN follows a fairly wealthy family (lawyer father, alcoholic mother, prop-set son) as they retreat to their vacation home in the woods following the accidental death of their daughter. While they grieve and struggle to hold both themselves and their family together, they encounter another family (dad, mom, and son) who a persistent about making nice. Of course, if you've seen the trailer (which gives away pretty much the entire film except for the final fifteen minutes), this new family is not what they seem.

The director does a decent job with what is obviously a paint-by-numbers script. Not a single line of dialogue or twist in the plot is unique or interesting, and the entire story feels like the product of a Learn Screen-Writing By Mail correspondence course. The acting isn't too bad, although the performers aren't asked to attempt anything of a whole lot of depth. And even though you can easily see where the film is headed, there are a few tense moments nevertheless. Unfortunately, they come after a whole lot of waffling around, and they precede an ending that feels sloppy, rushed, and pretty much tacked on. All in all, I wouldn't say it's a bad movie -- it feels almost like the template for a movie, like it wants to be embellished with more interesting characters, conversations, and plot elements -- but it's also about as memorable as a glass of water.",1379894400,,1426,4.868312757201646
5404182,5,B00AADAE8A,"When I read the description, I thought that it was exactly what the Japanese did to Chinese extended family compounds BEFORE the official invasion and declaration of war against China.  But when they forced the two homeowners to perform sex for their edification.  I knew that this was DEFINITELY about and not coincidentally echoing the home invasion rapes and murders by the Japanese in China BEFORE the war when they were seeding the country with their operatives.

My great grandfather gave my mother their family ancestry archives.  The earlier ""pages"" predate paper.  Now if you belonged to a peaceful, fortunate extended family, you absolutely would choose to live together in a family compound away from neighbors and that meant you would be interesting to the operatives who were found by the Chinese government to have sent entire TRAINED families to China to relocate and spy in the generations before formal declaration of war.

They were always successful so they literally slipped into the shoes of the rightful/murdered owners, lived their lives, used their names and DEFINITELY took possession of those archives.  It's not the same thing as Saul Tighe not realizing he is a Cylon (oops, Spoilers!) because it's not about habits that you adopt for yourself as the culture of Japan continues to do, it's not about reading the I-Ching or any of our other works with graduate-level training and expertise.  It is about not being able to create the I-Ching from scratch, it's about not having the heart to start with that infuses what your bloodline makes with soul.  No soul, no heart, no original, authentic bloodline and they invaded our homes like this movie.

""Coal trucks were sent out to collect women. Age didn't matter; girls as young as 11 and women as old as 80. Virgins were prized to affirm a warrior's virility. Twenty soldiers might rape a woman. Or, out of sadism, they might order a father on a daughter.""

Why would Hollywood make this movie if it is not about China and it would explain the purges of families singled out in China in the postwar years.

5404189,2,B00AADAE8A,"This is another home invasion film. Mark (Joshua Close), Mary (Selma Blair), and their son Brendon (Quinn Lord) get away to their summer home when their daughter is killed in a car accident. While at their retreat they meet Bobby (James D'Arcy), Jane (Rachel Miner), and their son Jared (Alex Ferris). They get together for dinner where Bobby asks all kinds of questions and exhibits a high creep factor. This aspect was done very well as you can sense the creepiness in scene and characters.

There is of course the later hostage situation and from the title and write up you know that these people want to take over the lives of the occupants. They did a lot to try to set this up, but I just didn't feel it like the creepiness. The problem with this film is that it lacked character. The characters were creepy, but were not colorful. Because the family was so bland, with Selma Blair looking gaunt, like a heroin addict, I didn't really care if they lived or died. In fact I was hoping they got knocked off early because they were boring. View at your own risk.

Of course, there's a tragic family secret haunting them.  Soon they meet their over effusive neighbors played by James D'arcy and Rachel Miner and their bullying son who gradually insinuate themselves into their lives.
The film moves languidly and there are no real surprises or genuine thrills.  Blair sleepwalks through her role and D'arcy adopts a Hannibal Lechter impersonation that just doesn't work.
More intensity in the pacing and performances might have had better results.  Sadly, IN THEIR SKIN just doesn't succeed.",1365206400,,647,5.133333333333334
5404193,4,B00AADAE8A,"I first saw this movie on-demand through my cable company, and rented it because I have enjoyed previous work from star Selma Blair.  I wasn't totally sure what to expect and was rather surprised at how good this film is.  The plot revolves around a couple named Mark and Mary Hughes, played by Joshua Close and Selma Blair, who mourning the death of their daughter and their marriage still no totally healed escape to their country cottage for some rest and to reconnect. They bring along their young son, Brendan played by Quinn Lord.  One morning they awaken to a sound and look out the window to see some strangers in their yard.  Eventually these strangers say they are neighbors and worm their way into the Hughes life.  Over the course of time Mary starts to feel uncomfortable around the strangers, named Jane and Bobby Sakowski, and calls them on it. This opens up a can of worms and well let's just say that w/out spoiling the plot, the Sakowski's are not who they claim to be and it gets very intense from there.

Selma Blair gives a decent performance, but the real stars here are the actors playing the psychos, Rachel Minor as Jane and James D'Arcy as Bobby. They truly shine and bring life to these unhinged characters.  I'll warn you, this movie is not one for the faint of heart; it contains some gruesome stuff, including some violence which may not be suitable for all viewers; and some sexual language and acts.

I found this movie to be chilling, it had me literally jumping out of my seat a few times, and is pretty memorable, mostly because it is so dark and twisty.  The plot is slightly convoluted but the performances more than make up for it.",1363996800,9,1669,4.536666666666667
5404194,4,B00AADAE8A,"This is one of last year's best films and I was soooo looking forward to owning it. However, I was extremely disappointed to see that this movie was NOT released on high-definition BLU-RAY, but only on standard-definition DVD.

Why would IFC Films/MPI Home Video intentionally lose sales by alienating the customers who support home video products the most?

High-def BLU-RAY technology is vastly better and it makes a world of difference, regardless of the film budget or source material. Standard-def DVD on an HD television looks like CRAP.

Sure, MPI Home Video should ALSO make the standard-def version available to those who don't care about image quality, (although, to be honest, such people are NOT the ones who purchase physical media any longer ... they are content to stream it, steal it, or watch it on cable), but PLEASE don't ignore those of us who DO care about audio/video quality.
