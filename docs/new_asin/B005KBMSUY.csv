8476687,5,B005KBMSUY,"Love this workout! Tim Culwell has a lot of energy and the tone of the DVD is relaxed. The two girls doing the workout with him seem comfortable talking and making jokes which I prefer over the participants looking ill at ease. The choreography builds up to the hardest level so there are lots of options to work at the level you are at. That being said, I would not recommend this for a beginner. You should have some step experience and be at least a little bit in shape. I have fallen back in love with step aerobics and plan to get more of his DVD's.",1421539200,,554,4.186915887850467
