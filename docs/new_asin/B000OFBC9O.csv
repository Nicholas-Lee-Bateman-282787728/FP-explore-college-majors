2794700,5,B000OFBC9O,"Three of the episodes in the third season of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS were directed by Hitchcock himself: ""The Perfect Crime,"" ""Lamb to the Slaughter"" and ""Dip in the Pool."" The rest were overseen by a number of fine directors, including Robert Altman, Arthur Hiller and Don Taylor. MCA/Universal's large talent pool supplied the many fine actors who appeared in this and all the other seasons the show was in production.

By season #3, ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS had really hit its stride. This DVD set is a terrific package of some of the finest programming the Golden Age of Televison ever produced. The first two years of the show are also available in complete season box sets.

It's always a treat to see favourite stars in their younger years.  Look for William Shatner doing his Shat Impersonation.  I don't care what anybody says, I have always appreciated Shatner's Stratford Shakespeare Festival style of acting.  If only he had been a contemporary of John Ford in his prime...

2794756,5,B000OFBC9O,"There's no question that Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Twilight Zone represent the height of the short form dramatic anthology that was popular in the early days of TV but has largely vanished today. In more recent years, while The Twilight Zone has been readily available for viewing on various cable channels, Hitchcock's show has been somewhat more difficult to find. So, this DVD, which contains all 39 episodes from the third season will be a welcome introduction for many viewers.

Hitchcock combined top flight talent in front of and behind the camera in these episodes. Many of the stories came from his magazine and were adapted by some of the top mystery writers of the day. Hitchcock himself directed three episodes and Robert Altman directed two others. The casts were a mixture of film vets, many of whom had worked with Hitchcock like Joseph Cotton, and rising up-and-comers. A great example of this is the first episode, ""The Glass Eye,"" in which William Shatner tells a story of a lonely woman (Jessica Tandy), in love with a ventriloquist (Tom Conway, brother of George Sanders). Another favorite episode from the season is Lamb to the Slaughter, in which Barbara Bel Geddes finds a unique way to dispose of a murder weapon.

By the third season, the show had hits its creative stride, and almost all the episodes featured Hitchcock's trademark sardonic wit in the storytelling along with some very clever twist endings. In addition, the DVD includes the introductions and closings featuring Hitchcock in which he poked fun at himself, television, and the even-then annoying commercials.

This is a great DVD collection for anyone who likes Hitchcock, old time television, or good old fashioned mysteries and thrillers.",1387411200,5,1740,5.055749128919861
2794757,5,B000OFBC9O,So good to view great drama.  Amazing that a former half hour show is almost a half hour unlike todays drama's that run about 45 min with 15 minutes for commercials.

The most famous of all episodes, A Lamb To The Slaughter with Barbara Del Geddes, written by Road Dahl and directed by Hitch himself.  This is the one in which A pregnant woman hits her husband with a frozen leg of lamb when he tries to leave her and cooks the meat only to feed it to the detectives who are stumped about the murder weapon.  Other episodes include A Dip in the Pool another Road Dahl script in which a man who has lost money at gambling while on a cruise and hopes to recoup the money by suing the shipping company for falling over, after he gets rescued.  It doesn't go as planned.  There are plenty of other great episodes in this season, directed by Hitchcock, Arthur Hiller and Robert Altman, among others.

In case that there is someone out there that never watched his shows, you will get some comedy, a whole lot of unbloodied murder and SUSPENCE! SUSPENCE!

2794776,5,B000OFBC9O,"It seems like a lot of people have written very eloquent and thoughtful reviews of Hitchcock's half-hour segmented anthology series, so I'm not sure that there is anything I can add here that hasn't been covered already.

It's clear from the enjoyment that Alfred Hitchcock takes in setting up a morbid little joke or comment at the start of each episode that he truly loves being in front of the camera as much as he loves being behind it directing.

Many of the dramas are excellent, borne up to the best examples of television production ever created on the wings of great actors and great cinematographers. There is a certain gripping noir presence to a drama series that makes exquisite use of black and white film. It's a lost art today, but when done to perfection as in this series, I almost prefer to watch black and white rather than color episodes of other more modern shows. There is a great feel to it that simply can not be matched in more contemporary styles. And it especially lends itself very well to the presentation of mysteries.

I found the series well worth the price of the purchase.  It was enjoyable seeing some of the earliest television work of actors like William Shatner, Jack Klugman, Vincent Price.., and so on.

2794777,5,B000OFBC9O,"I was too young to appreciate the series at the time it originally aired. I occasionally caught bits and pieces of re-runs here and there in the 60s, but never had the situation to watch it on any sort of regular basis in any serious way until now.

I started with this - Season 3, because I read that it was better than the first two, and I was hooked with the first episode. The story of the woman who falls for a puppeteer she sees on stage has one of the all-time great, dark humor surprise endings!! And that is a trademark of the each of these episodes - either a surprise or a deviously clever ending, often with a very dark or macabre humor. Some you can see coming after a certain point and others are complete surprises.

I also love the intros and outros, where Hitch himself always appears. As the consummate director who had a wide knowledge of all aspects of film-making, he came up with some rather elaborate, clever, hard-to-do sets that you could tell took some time and real expertise (and cash) to do well. He took those segments very seriously and worked hard at them, when they could have been just cheap filler.

In those intros and outros (and in the stories themselves), his jaded, wry, cynical, sarcastic humor seems a cut above the idealized, happy themes of so much TV of that era. He also had very funny self-deprecating humor about his weight and looks. And he even puts down the commercials sometimes.

Every single episode of this season is gripping and the show is addictive. I will now start on seasons 1 and 2 and cannot wait for the release of later seasons!",1233014400,,1593,4.445205479452055

2794792,4,B000OFBC9O,"Featuring a top notch array of Hollywood actors such as Peter Lorre (who had appeared in ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" and ""Secret Agent"" two early Hitchcock classics), Jack Klugman, William Shatner, Joseph Cotton (another Hitchcock veteran)and Fay Wray, many of the show's episodes where directed by talented folks such as John Brahm (who directed the remake of Hitch's silent classic ""The Lodger""), Paul Henreid (who appeared in the classic ""Casablanca"" and was blacklisted in 1952. Hitch's show gave him steady employment), Robert Altman (""M*A*S*H"", ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"", ""Short Cuts"")and other talented film/TV veterans.

Alfred Hitchcock truly was the first director as celebrity. It began with the cameos, his droll sense of humor and a business deal (the opportunity to host his own TV program and make lots of money). The third season of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" remains one of the pinnacle years for the program. Although Hitch only directed three episodes, all three are classic Hitch.

Produced by Norman Lloyd (who appeared in Hitchcock's ""Saboteur"" and ""Spellbound"")and long time Hitchcock associate Joan Harrison, the series works like the best short stories--involving you in the suspense story at hand often with a droll, witty sense of humor.

The third season varies in quality but overall looks pretty good in its first ever complete presentation on DVD (there was a single disc of the TV shows available in the first Universal Hitchcock box set). It's a pity there aren't any extras or commentary tracks (particularly on the best episodes such as ""Lamb to the Slaughter"")but the show is presented at an affordable price.

""The Mail Order Prophet,"" which involves a series of prophetic letters, is very much elevated by the engaging performances of Jack Klugman and E.J. Marshall.

Here are my thoughts on other episodes:

THE GOOD

""A Guest for Breakfast"": This quirky and entertaining episode is about a fleeing murderer who breaks into a home and takes a bickering husband and wife hostage.  The couple is so fixated on one-upping each other with witty put-downs that it takes them awhile to appreciate the gravity of the situation.  Later, when the murderer decides to kill one of them and take the other on the road with him, the couple mount a clever, self-serving debate to convince the murderer which one of them should go along and which one should die.  This scene is both brutal and funny.

""The Diplomatic Corpse"": This episode does a good job of combining comedy and suspense.  Peter Lorre is amusing in the role of a sleazy private detective.  The ending is disappointing, but it still made me smile.

""Together"": This episode, directed by Robert Altman, is one of the better episodes in the collection.  The title is a pun.  Joseph Cotten goes to an office to meet his mistress, who demands he leave his rich wife so they can be together.  Cotten stabs the young woman as she grabs the phone to call his wife.  He soons finds himself locked in the office, which leaves him and the bloody corpse trapped together.  My only complaint has to do with a drunken friend who becomes involves in the proceedings.  The friend's inebriation is played to comic effect, which seems out of place and diminishes the suspense of the story.

""The Return of the Hero"": This episode, with its sentimentality and social commentary, offers a nice change of pace for the series.

""The Right Kind of House"": This episode stars series regular, Robert Emhardt.  Emhardt, who specialized in portraying creepy and sinister characters, fits well into the series and always enhanced the episodes in which he appeared.  The strength of this episode comes from solid performances and a well-crafted story.

""The Foghorn"": This episode is effective for those who like tragic romance stories in the tradition of Ethan Frome.

""Fatal Figures"": A middle-aged man worries that he has done nothing in his life to distinguish himself.  While reading the crime statistics in an almanac, he decides to set himself apart by going on a crime spree.  This episode is made comical by John McGiver's loopy rendition of the main character.

""Post Mortem"": This episode is well-written, well-acted, and well-directed.  Directing credit goes to Arthur Hiller, who would later direct ""The Out-of-Towners,"" ""Love Story,"" ""Silver Streak,"" ""The In-Laws"" and ""The Hospital.""  Joanna Moore (Tatum O'Neal's mom) is delightfully funny in the lead role.

""On the Nose,"" which involves a housewife addicted to horseracing, is a riveting episode even though it's not as dark or violent as the standard Hitchcock episode.  ""Silent Witness,"" which is simultaneously funny and suspenseful, is another good episode.  Other worthwhile episodes include ""Enough Rope for Two,"" ""The Young One,"" ""The Crocodile Case"" and ""Little White Frock.""

THE BAD

""Last Request"": Harry Guardino gives one of his usual hammy performances.  Guardino's way of showing that his character is cocky is to breeze into a room and prop his foot up on a chair.  It's some all-purpose gimmick he tries in multiple situations.  First, he does it when he enters the District Attorney's Office.  He then tries it again at a restaurant when he's trying to pick up a woman.  I cannot imagine that this dumb move could ever intimidate a District Attorney or charm a woman.  This sort of furniture abuse only serves to make the character look brainless.

""The Deadly"": The drama starts out creepy and ends silly.  Too bad the writer couldn't have come up with a better ending.

""Miss Paisley's Cat"": I actually found some moving moments in this story about a lonely old woman who adopts a friendly alley cat.  However, I eventually ran out of patience and sympathy as the story meandered on.  The old woman has a problem with her cat repeatedly sneaking into the apartment of an ill-tempered bookie, who threatens to kill the cat if he ever comes back.  Instead of keeping her cat inside her home, where he'll keep out of trouble, she babbles to herself incessantly about the bookie's bad manners and cruel disposition.  The old woman ends up finding her cat dead in a trash can and feels compelled to take revenge.  The story could have been easily and neatly wrapped up in fifteen minutes, but the writer has to create some unnecessarily complications to draw it out for another ten minutes.  A decent story gets lost in an awful muddle.

""The Percentage"": Eddie Slovak, a mob boss, cannot enjoy his riches as he keeps remembering a time during the war when he panicked under fire.  The only other person who knows about this is a fellow soldier who saved his life and later gave Slovak credit for the two of them getting out of the battle safely.  Slovak figures that he can relieve his guilt if he finds a way to repay his old army buddy, who is now working as a television repairman.  The problem is that the old army buddy does not feel that he's owed anything and refuses to accept any form of repayment.  Don Keefer and Nita Talbot give strong performances as the principled television repair man and his bored wife.  The problem with the episode is that Walter Woolf King, as the mob boss, gives broad and repetitious performance.  He is constantly frantic and shouting in sharp contrast to Keefer and Talbot's subdued, believable performances.

""Sylvia"": This episode has a significant casting problem.  John McIntire plays a middle-aged businessman who is determined to rid his daughter, Sylvia, of her gold digger husband.  McIntire was 50 years-old at the time and Ann Todd, who they cast as Sylvia, was 48 year-old.  How does that make sense for them to be father and daughter?  It's not that more appropriate casting could have helped - nothing suspenseful or inventive comes out of this episode.  It's best to skip it.

""The Motive"": The climatic murder scene is creepy and the ending has a good twist, but the set-up drags on too long.  Also, I was disappointed by William Redfield, who is one of the leads.  Redfield, best known as ""Harding"" in One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest, was a talented actor, but he gives a stinker of a performance in this one.

""Miss Bracegirdle Does Her Duty"": Mildred Natwick, as Miss Bracegirdle, gets herself locked in a room with a dead body much as Joseph Cotten did only three episodes earlier.  This show was never shy about recycling ideas.  Anyway, Natwick does not seem right for the role of  Miss Bracegirdle.  She is several years older than the character, who is supposed to be 45 years-old, and the scenes are clearly designed for a younger woman.  Natwick, on her way back from her bath, winds up in the wrong room and finds a man who died of a heart attack.  The door handle comes off in her hand when she tries to leave the room.  A frantic voiceover and funny music tries to hide the fact that nothing happens on screen for the next ten minutes.  Miss Bracegirdle, who didn't commit murder, has no reason to be worried about getting caught in the room.  The dead man in the bed is icky, sure, but he's certainly no threat.  This leaves no possible suspense to her escape efforts  - it's just a person trying to get out of a room.  It is not an example of high drama, or classic television, to watch Natwick fretting about as she picks a door lock with a bobbypin.

You can skip ""The Perfect Crime.""  The lead, Vincent Price, said that Hitchcock fell asleep while directing this episode.  I now know why.  Even worse episodes include ""Flight to the East,"" ""Bull in a China Shop,"" ""Disappearing Trick,"" ""Death Sentence,"" ""The Canary Sedan,"" and ""Impromptu Murder.""",1193788800,7,8122,4.801587301587301
2794796,5,B000OFBC9O,"I've been collecting all of the season packages of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS as they've become available, and this 3rd season is my favorite so far. There is an unusual level of excellence in these 39 episodes, even higher than seasons 1 and 2. With a lot of famous writers (Stirling Silliphant!) and directors (Robert Altman!), and a Who's Who of the best actors from stage and screen, this season is something to see. Only Hitchcock could have attracted a lot of these people to the new medium in the '50s--many stars and writers at that time thought TV was beneath them, and people who worked in it were considered to be ""slumming."" But they all agreed to work for the Master, and the results are impressive.

Everyone will have a fave episode (mine is the famous ""Lamb To The Slaughter"" with a terrifically subversive Roald Dahl script and a great performance by Barbara Bel Geddes, directed by Hitch himself), and they're all worth watching more than once. This series set an early standard for excellence in TV, and I just wish there were more shows of this quality around now. We can't have everything--but we have ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, preserved on DVD. I can't wait for Season 4!",1192579200,8,1193,4.735576923076923
2794797,5,B000OFBC9O,"""Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season 3"" contains several of my personal favorite episodes from Mr. Hitchcock's long-running anthology series from the 1950s and 1960s, such as ""The Perfect Crime"", ""Dip In The Pool"", and the classic tale of a housewife scorned (and armed with frozen meat), ""Lamb To The Slaughter"".

Coincidentally (well, probably not), all three of the above-mentioned episodes were directed by Mr. Hitchcock himself, which tends to make this writer think that when Hitch himself is at the helm, a certain extra ""something"" is added to that particular program. It's hard to define what it is, though. It seems to be a special ""Hitch Quality"" that raises the level of the episode a notch or two.

The list of guest stars that put in appearances in this third season of ""AHP"" is fairly impressive indeed, including one of the ""masters of horror"", Vincent Price, who (as usual) is very good in ""The Perfect Crime"".

And what better guest star could there possibly be for an episode of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" than Mr. Price? Vincent's very presence in a TV show or motion picture conjures up in the viewer's mind ample thoughts of suspense, mystery, and murder, which makes him made to order for Mr. Hitchcock's television series.

Other familiar faces that can be found in this third-season collection are:

Joseph Cotten, Jack Klugman, Mildred Natwick, William Shatner, Jeanette Nolan, E.G. Marshall, Herbert Marshall, Vince Edwards, Michael Rennie, Jessica Tandy, Barbara Bel Geddes, Fay Wray, Steve Forrest, Claude Akins, Hume Cronyn, James Gregory, Gary Merrill, Carol Lynley, Joanna Moore, Pat Hingle, Jerry Paris, Keenan Wynn, Jack Albertson, Martin Balsam, plus (like Vincent Price) another one of Hollywood's all-time top kings of fright -- Peter Lorre, who shows up in the episode ""The Diplomatic Corpse"", which co-stars George Peppard.

We'll also find Lorre popping up in a very intriguing and creepy 5th-season ""Hitchcock Presents"" episode when Universal releases that boxed box in the future (knock wood) -- which is an episode that definitely makes my ""Top 10"" list of all-time AHP faves, ""Man From The South"".

DVD INFO:

Universal Studios Home Entertainment delivers ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season Three"" in a 5-Disc DVD set, with single-sided discs, Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono audio, and the appropriate video (screen) shape of 1.33:1 (Full-Frame). The B&W picture and the sound are pretty darn good here too, in my opinion.

Like each of the first two seasons, there are 39 total shows in AHP-3. These episodes, which were originally seen on CBS-TV way back in 1957 and 1958, appear to be full and uncut on these DVDs, with running times that average about 26 minutes per show.

English subtitles are provided....and a ""Play All"" option is available from either the Main Menu on each DVD or via the ""Episode Index"" Sub-Menu on each of the five discs. Chapter breaks have been inserted into each episode too (four chapter stops per program). No bonus supplements are included in this set.

The DVD packaging consists of a three-panel ""Digipak"" inner case that holds the five discs, plus an outer box for the folding Digipak to comfortably slide into.

Each of the disc-holding panels sports a third-season publicity photo (revealed when the DVDs are removed from their respective trays), including a playful pose of a wide-eyed Vincent Price in the process of strangling Mr. Hitchcock.

And just in case anyone is keeping track of such things, I'll add this trivial packaging note: this set's inner case slides out from its outer slipcase box on the left-hand side (when looking at the front of the box, that is), which is the same design as Season #2, and it definitely feels backwards to me. I think the DVD innards should slide out on the right-hand side. But, it's not exactly worth throwing a fit over.

Anyway, just thought I'd mention it, for those keeping a ""box"" score at home. (BTW, the inner portion of the Season-One ""AHP"" DVD set slides out from the right-hand side of the case, just the opposite from Seasons 2 and 3. I guess Universal just likes to keep us guessing as to which end will be open on its DVD cases.) ~wink~

Another minor gripe I have with this third-season packaging is the fact that the text written on both of the spines of the box is too dark and totally unreadable when looking at the box from certain angles. I think Universal should have used lighter-colored lettering on the black spines, like they did for the first two Hitchcock season sets.

SOME FINAL ""AHP"" THOUGHTS:

With Universal's release of this third Hitchcock season on DVD on October 9, 2007, it now means that, up to the date of this review, 117 episodes of this spooky black-and-white television series (which ran for 7 seasons) have been digitally preserved on the DVD format. And a lot of good Hitchcock-flavored stories can be found within those first three full-season collections.

So, I'd positively recommend picking up a copy of ""ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS: SEASON THREE"". And I'd also recommend something else too -- after purchasing this DVD set, I'd strongly suggest that you immediately dispose of any and all legs of lamb that you happen to have in the freezer. (Just so your spouse won't feel tempted, you see. No sense in taking any chances.) ;)

2794802,5,B000OFBC9O,"Imagine an anthology television series where every episode is based on a literate, tried and tested short story by a writer skilled in the art of narrative suspense. Where the story was already successful in another medium (and were not talking comic books). The batting average for good episodes was amazingly high, and these DVDs hold up beautifully. Collect them all. Sadly, I picked up a boot of Boris Karloff's series ""Thriller"" on DVD and they don't (hold up). At an hour they were stretched out, and mostly done by hack tv writers. Karloff's intros are the only good part. Hitchcock's great intros are worth the ticket alone here, but stick around for some great storytelling.
