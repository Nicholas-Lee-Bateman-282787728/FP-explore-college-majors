8155861,4,B000KEG91U,This is a compilation video of street soccer in one of the greatest soccer playing countries in the world. The raw talent and the ability to play anywhere is amazing. This movie also gives insight into many popular pastimes of Brazil. All in all a pretty good movie.,1378598400,,266,4.5625
8155862,5,B000KEG91U,"More of a documentary or MTV music video than anything.  We play videos during our Legendary Street Soccer futsal and PANNA events in Northwest Florida.  This is one of the favorite and most requested videos we play, along with the FIFA Street commercials/videos.  Great action, moves, and a lot of talent in Brazil.  You won't find a better video for inspiring futsal and soccer players.",1335744000,,388,4.923076923076923
8155863,1,B000KEG91U,I thought this would be a documentary on Brazilian street soccer. Instead it is a compilation of amateur shots of street soccer without any commentary. Easy money for makers of a useless product. I feel really cheated. This is an outrage of how to get people buying a product which is totally worthless. Please do not be fooled. I was fooled and I will advice everybody who thinks on buying: your money is waisted on something you do not want.,1217548800,3,443,4.55
8155864,5,B000KEG91U,A nice long music video for football fans. Those crazy Brazillians make football look so easy. Little wonder why their players make so much on the international scene.,1196035200,5,167,5.0
8155865,5,B000KEG91U,"This dvd rocks, so many players, so many moves. Showing plenty of artwork with the feet and a soccerball. Playing in different areas between rooftops, open fields, playgrounds and a pier looking top. Great addition to any soccer fan.",1184198400,9,233,5.0
