While neither film is an unmissable classic of the sexploitation genre, both contain enough highlights to endear them to fans.

""She Mob"" (1968) has a few scenes which move incredibly slowly, but those of us who've watched a lot of these films are happy to just sit back and soak up the sleazy vibe until things pick up. What makes the film a delight is the costumes, which fall somewhere between those of a Russ Meyer movie and early John Waters, and the sweaty over-acting of Marni Castle as Big Shim. She's a little more restrained in her dual role as Brenda McClain. The girls in this film are not as pretty as in many of the other sexploitation films of the time, but there is something about the aggressiveness, the inch-thick make-up and the cigar smoking which lends them a sexiness of their own, not dissimilar to that of Tura Satana. Fans of technical incompetence will be amused by the clumsy post-dubbing. In one scene, where they are struggling to tie up our hero, the girls couldn't possibly be speaking the lines we hear on the soundtrack because they are all giggling. Monique Duval, as detective Sweety East (a parody of the heroine of the 1965-66 television series ""Honey West"" starring Anne Francis), is very flat in her acting, but she's here for her curves and the several inches of buttcrack her catsuit reveals. And you have to give her character credit for stamina given that she's still keen to make love even after being shot in the back.

""Nymphs Anonymous"" (1968) is a bit more professionally made and with prettier girls. It's sexy, silly and tasteless, in a cartoonish manner, and has enough tease, nudity and fetishistic sex play scenes to satisfy most fans.

The special features consist of a bunch of trailers for other black & white sexploitation films of the era (all pretty interesting although some may be familiar from other SW discs), the usual montage of film posters set to audio promos and two nudie cutie shorts. ""Tease for Two"" is a particularly good example with two very cute girls with fifties hairdos flirting with the camera and engaging in some fun business with each other, including a mock boxing match complete with gloves. ""Smoke Rings"" is more run-of-the-mill. Contrary to the title the smoking is brief and contains no ring blowing. Still it is an enjoyable extra for nudie cutie loop fans.",1401926400,2,2506,4.75632183908046
8094925,5,B000BZN1LY,"I've watched this fabulous exploitation classic from 1968 many times and it still fascinates because of its demented and cartoonish story and gallery of grotesques.
With stunning black and white photography by Harold Williams, we watch this Texas-based gem unwound before our amazed eyes. Brenda McCain is a heavy, voluptuous rich woman who pays a hunky young stud to be her around-the-clock lover. Unknown to her, a hideous lesbian, Big Shim, has escaped prison and is holed up in a farmhouse with her gang of sex-starved gal pals. They manage to kidnap the gigolo and then....
What fascinates about this madness that would certainly have pleased John Waters, Russ Meyer and Ed Wood is that both the characters of Brenda McCain and Big Shim, are played by that amazing Marni Castle.  Her live-in stud is a sexy, boyish Adam Clyde who appears to be enjoying his role and plays it with amused impudence.
As Big Shim, the actress turns herself into a grotesque parody of a lip-smacking, eyes rolling sex maniac and struts around in a bizarre bra that's formed into two missile-like projectiles.
Among the female freaks that fascinated me the most was Twig--a bizarre girl/woman who never stops dancing to her transitor radio and squeaking like Minnie Mouse.
There are absolutely no production notes about how this movie was made, who made it, what happened to the cast and crew.
It has all the trademarks of an amateur but very well-made production where everyone knew each other. The women look as if they were probably professional go-go girls in some Texas bar. I always wonder about the behind-the-scenes of these forgotten gems, like did they all like each other? What did they talk about? Did they all eat at some nearby restaurant or was the food catered?
What also makes this gem stand out is that you actually see some male nudity.
In that era of the ""softies,"" women could show their breasts and butts but men had to keep their britches on while fornicating. In this movie, Tony the gigolo is actually seen frolicking in a bubble bath with his mistress. We see his naked buttocks which must have thrilled the gay men in the audiences back then. Besides that, Adam Clyde was a handsome man when most men in these grind house masterpieces were out-of-shape, old and unattractive.
I first saw She Mob in an enormous old movie house on Forty-Second Street back in 1968, which was double-billed with another amazing classic, SCREAM OF THE BUTTERFLY. This one starred the amazing Nelida Lobato and the ravishing young Nick Navorro. This is another must-see classic from those days when movies like these played the grind house circuit in the big cities and Southern metropolis like Charlotte, NC and Birmingham.
Watch ""She Mob"" and let yourself go--with maybe a beer in hand or a strong gin and tonic.",1386201600,12,2803,4.839583333333334
8094926,5,B000BZN1LY,"Same average to poor quality video  as any other SWV dvd, but what do you expect. Pure sleaze, just perfect for the pervert in me:)",1385683200,5,131,4.24
8094927,2,B000BZN1LY,"If you're the type of guy who likes their women burly, broad shoulders and could pass as Divine's older sister, then you will really like SHE MOB. Personally, the women were just too burly, beefy and too manly looking for my taste. Plus, one of the women clearly got one of the first silicon implants - there are grain silos that should stand that tall and straight ... so personally, hardly anything to recommend about the first film, SHE MOB unless you like women who could take on the East German women of the 1970's in wrestling and win or sling Tony Soprano over their shoulder.

NYMPHS ANONYMOUS is much closer in line to a SW presentation though the girl (the madam) you do want to see all kinds of naked is mostly covered up and briefly appears in lingerie but in a medium shot. The rest of the girls are all natural though not exactly ingenues ... they do spend most of the 1-hour film nude if that counts for anything ... there is a plot about a mix up between the play-acting of these nymphos & some real crime but that hardly matters. Overall, it's still pretty weak since the girls are definitely not spring chickens but if you enjoy real nudity by older real women of the 1960's - it's an acceptable SW choice.

There are two 15-minutes shorts - one is the type of fare that is perfect a kooky, short  of two women who spend the entire dressing and undressing - both attractive though the quality of the print is what you might expect from a home movie shot through a hole in the wall :-) - the other is a repeat from other DVD's, two aging aunt Rose's types nude smoking on a mobile home couch ... again, maybe your cup of tea but for most, ugh ... the trailers are all great and are films you do want to see ... but overall, pretty weak by any grade.

One film is okay, one short is okay, the 8 trailers are great (some are repeats) but unless you like mostly burly in your burlesque, this is a pretty weak offering ... so really only a few minutes of great, plus 25 minutes of okay and the rest - weak so ...",1210377600,19,2025,4.224806201550388
