3849256,4,B0025VLEMK,"Just finished watching the blu-ray ""screwhead"" release of AOD. Quite a contrast to the two  terrible DVD versions of this movie I owned previously.

Impressions (disclaimer: I am not an expert at evaluating transfers to HD format):

The majority of the HD digital transfer looks excellent. Clean, sharp, crisp contrast and color. Some defects still present here and there -- most notable is something smudging the screen in a couple places shortly after Ash falls into the 13th century. On a few scenes, the video quality takes a strikingly sudden turn for the WORSE -- for example, looking down into the pit at Ash after he falls in (thankfully only lasts a few seconds). I also noticed that the rear projection scenes (used extensively in the final battle) look extremely pixilated and grainy.

Sound was very good throughout on my 7:2 surround system.

Special Features consist of a featurette on the making of the Deadite Army (worthwhile) and the Original Ending (presented in a very low definition, grainy letterboxed format). Haven't dug into the disc yet for Easter Eggs (if there are any).

Overall, I give it an 8 out of 10. Best presentation of this movie I've seen yet and maybe as good as it gets.",1253577600,9,1210,4.821256038647343

3849282,5,B0025VLEMK,"Army of Darkness is a separation from the Evil Dead 1 and 2 films, in that it majorly changes up the setting and horror aspect, in favor of a medieval battle inspired by the Ray Harryhausen films. Stop motion only occurs in sparse moments throughout the film, that include a flying Deadite. Ash however, is at the top of his game, handling these nightmarish abominations of evil without a hint of fear. With his comedy timing and humorous one liners, Ash disposes of Evil one gunshot and chainsaw slice at a time.

The gore and blood scenes are low in number, this being made for theaters, but the action is plentiful.
Army of Darkness is an adventure film at its roots, breaking away from the isolated horror cabin the series is loved for.",1486080000,,740,4.56390977443609

3849284,4,B0025VLEMK,"Technically the third installment of the Evil Dead trilogy, this movie takes a much different take on the formula. While the previous two movies where mainly horror films, this one is best described as a comedy horror, focusing more on the comedy. This film has a style to it that can only be described as stupidly fun. This movie could have easily been a disaster, but all of the elements come together to create a truly unique, and unforgettably hilarious experience.",1484697600,,469,4.802469135802469

Dammit Bruce Campbell, I won't go gay for you no matter how awesome you get. Please don't stop trying.

Tongue and cheek, 1 liner galore. The 2 liners ain't bad neither.  Not mainstream, not cooler than the backstreet boys, but funnier than all get out. If you take things serious, if you wanna be sophisticated, you might not be happy.

I'm trying think of parallels, none come to mind. There's the ""we're so sophisticated and subtle no one notices"" crowd.  There's the ""Here's a steaming turd, but we're ironic"" crowd. Then here's a ""we got an off the wall, but good story, and nobody involved is too 'poopy smells like roses' to laugh at the places we can take it"" crowd.

If you watch it and say ""that was good"", you'll like it more with continued viewings. Otherwise, it's not your cup of tea. They're not trying to be mainstream, but if it's up your alley, it's way up there.",1470960000,,922,4.458333333333333

3849316,5,B0025VLEMK,"When we last saw Ash Williams, he had been sucked through a time vortex and ended up in the 14th century... where he STILL had to contend with undead horrors. No, not going to give context.

""Army of Darkness"" pretty much picks up from there, finishing up the legendary trilogy that Sam Raimi started with ""The Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn."" This time around, Sam Raimi dials down the horror once again, while dialing up massive quantities of skeletal comedy -- while there's the odd gross-out moment (eyeball in the shoulder!), most of the story is devoted to the increasingly manic Bruce Campbell struggling to defeat an undead horde of skeletons with only his trusty boomstick and chainsaw.

Having appeared in the 14th century, Ash (Campbell) is immediately captured by the arrogant Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert), who mistakes him for one of Duke Henry's (Richard Grove) men. He tries to explain that he's not, but ends up tossed into an execution pit filled with iron spikes and demonic Deadites -- and only the timely intervention of the Wise Man (Ian Abercrombie) allows Ash to reclaim his chainsaw and ""boomstick,"" kill the Deadites, and establish that he is a prophesied savior come to free them from the Deadite scourge.

But of course, the entire universe hates Ash. So when he's sent on an incredibly simple quest to reclaim and de-power the Necronomicon, Ash immediately encounters bizarre Deadite attacks that are specifically designed to torment him -- including the formation of an evil doppelganger from his own body, Evil Ash. And when he manages to botch the whole thing, the Deadites prepare to storm the castle and take everything over. Life is hard when you're Ash.

Considering that the series started with a serious attempt at horror, it's a little odd that ""Army of Darkness"" mostly drops the horror. Of course, there's still some gloriously gross moments (the emergence of Evil Ash, and his decaying face a few scenes later), but most of the movie is played for laughs (including a long sequence where Ash is assaulted by a small army of Lilliputian doppelgangers, who jab him in the butt with a fork and tie him to the floor). Even the grosser moments are played for laughs (""Good. Bad. I'm the guy with the gun"").

And that's what makes this whole movie so gloriously entertaining -- it's gross, nasty and violent, but it's presented with the gleeful joy that comes with a cavalcade of one-liners and memetastic moments (""All right, you primitive screwheads, listen up... this... is my BOOMSTICK!""). Nothing is presented very seriously, because... well, how can you take this seriously? It's about a college student/S-Mart employee who gets blasted back in time to fight demonic zombies in a medieval setting. The cheese is thick and gloriously unserious, climaxing as Ash careens through the titular army in a massive armored steampunk-car/tank that easily hacks them apart.

And despite the much larger cast and more extensive sets and special effects required, somehow Raimi maintains that rough, low-budget feel -- the stop-motion, tiny Ashes, and especially the battle sequences that are clearly against inanimate Halloween skeletons. It still feels like a cheesy low-budget movie that does NOT care

Bruce Campbell is at the absolute height of his Campbellitude here -- he gives a delightfully hammy performance as a gun-toting, one-liner-spouting Ash. He plays the kind of guy that every guy likes to think he'd be in such a crisis, uttering don't-give-a-dang one-liners, shooting monsters and smooching a wench with extremely good teeth with great relish. And he gives an equally quotable  (""Little goody two-shoes!"") performance as the Evil Ash, who is just as snarky but... well, his face is rotting off. The supporting actors give good performances, especially Abercrombie as the wise man that nobody ever seems to actually listen to, but this is clearly the Campbell show here.

It may have effectively left horror behind, but ""Army of Darkness"" instead embraces a gloriously gross brand of comedy, with knights, skeletons, bagpipes and one S-Mart employee with a boomstick and a robot hand. It's hard to find a movie more resolutely fun than this.",1460937600,9,4200,5.031654676258992
3849317,1,B0025VLEMK,"This universal blu-ray is barebones, only has theatrical trailer & small featurette Creating the Deadites
the Scream factory collectors blu-ray is worth buying much more
you get 3 Discs in clamshell case with new & original artwork that you can switch around
Disc 1 is the usual Theatrical version in new 1:85:1 HD transfer with new 5.1 master mix  81mins
plus a new retrospective Documentary MEDIEVAL TIMES making Army of Darkness
95mins of new interviews with most of the cast & crew that worked on the film
plus the original ending, the original opening, Deleted scenes, Theatrical trailer, TV spots
Disc 2 is the original Directors cut version, sam raimi's personal vision of the film
in a new 1:78:1 ratio HD transfer with 5.1 master audio mix
for some fans that don't know this longer cut which has about 15mins of footage inserted back in the film
 is what Sam wanted to release to theaters back in the early 90's
back the stupid Universal executives did not understand the film at all and released their 81min version
so Disc 2 is the 95mins Longer cut of the film in new 178:1 ratio 1080p HD transfer NOT RATED
 which looks much sharper & clearer than the very old anchor bay dvd
plus the sound quality has been boosted up to new 5.1 master mix
the extras on Disc 2 are Creating the Deadites featurette which is from the Screwhead edition blu-ray
plus the usual Anchor bay dvd commentary with Sam raimi & Bruce campbell
plus 45mins of behind the scenes footage with KNB effects
plus vintage making of promo featurette for TV & extended interview clips
Disc 3 is the International version probably the U.K. release in a new HD transfer 1:78:1 ratio 88mins NOT RATED
which contains roughly 8mins of new scenes inserted back in the film
this Int' version has a new 4k HD transfer which looks even better than the 1080p Directors cut version
the extras on this 3rd Disc is the U.S. TV version of the film broadcasted back in the 90's
the picture quality is only Digital remaster transfer in 1:33:1 ratio which has been formatted to fit 1:85:1 ratio
so there's no black bars on either side of the screen, not on my TV anyway, the sound is 2.0 stereo mix
the TV network at the time decided to add more scenes for the TV broadcast runtime is 90mins
there's also still Galleries with behind the scenes photos & the int' Theatrical trailer
roughly 10mins of extra scenes added for the TV version
so scrap the Universal screwhead edition blu-ray
and buy this new 3 disc collectors edition worth 5 stars for sure",1460764800,9,2510,4.598214285714286

Fantasy is one of my favourite genres, .....horror too, but this just descends into idiotic slapstick routines reminiscent of ""The Three Stooges"", complete with eye-poking and nostril pulling, together with facial muggings and cartoon distortions.
I can only assume the target audience was 10 year old boys, yes it's THAT bad!

The dialogue is no better. It's SUPPOSED to be funny, but is so blatantly corny that it elicits painful groans more than any laughter.
Sample?
A skeleton pops up over the ramparts and says ""I've got a bone to pick with you!""
Now if THAT clich&eacute; causes you to split both sides in unbridled merriment then you might get more out of this junk than I did.
Sure they've spent some money on SOME of the effects, ...others are pretty basic and there are many glaring continuity errors and discrepancies between long shots and the interspersed close ups. Guns suddenly appear in holsters where there were none before, the army in the sweeping long shots are full bodied figures, but completely see-through skeletal up close......well I had to start noticing such things to at least hold my interest in making it to the end of this rubbish didn't I?

The movie tries to reference, ...or probably just plain plagiarises, (I don't think the writers Sam and Ivan Raimi were clever enough to do appropriation) sequences from elsewhere. ""Gulliver's Travels"" in one scene, and most of the Three Stooges face slapping/pulling shtick gets so overused that even I wanted to slap the screen!
This loose assemblage of idiocy makes ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" look like high art!
Sure the budget was WAY bigger, but you don't laugh.
It's not funny enough to be comedy, ...it's not ""funny"" at all!
It's no where near scary enough to be horror, .....more corn than the machine out in the foyer!
It's certainly not even ""camp"" enough to be called a cult classic. I simply do not understand the huge following this seems to have and all those five star reviews.
There are some sequences that will have you scratching your head in sheer disbelief as to what it has to do with the story, or even why it has been included in the edit. I could only assume the makers thought them funny, but believe me, they most certainly are not! Unless perhaps you have the mental capacity somewhere akin to a somewhat retarded six-year old that is.

From the selection available in the pack, I watched the Blu-Ray Theatrical release, and the picture  quality was middling, ....acceptable for a Blu-ray but nothing magnificent, ....and I have an Ultra-Hi-Def screen and excellent player.
After enduring this loosely cobbled together collection of witless, thimble-brained, self-indulgent trash, let me say I have absolutely NO compulsion whatsoever to watch any of the other versions/cuts I now unfortunately own.
The whole collection is now doomed for immediate disposal in the charity bin....although I feel guilty in the knowledge that it may thus be picked up by some other unsuspecting viewer still in possession of a modicum of intelligence.
The ultimate irony is that the cover carries the classification ""Recommended for a Mature Audience"".
Now THAT in itself is FAR funnier than the whole damned movie!",1443398400,,3508,4.938983050847457

I mean thats pretty impressive to say the least. The sound is crystal clear as well. When i watched this it was like i was seeing it for the first time again. The funny moments are even more funny.

Other than that, this transfer is amazing! I've never seen this movie look and sound so terrific!
Now for the most disappointing part: the extras. With so many editions released, all we have is a ""Creating the Deadites"" feature and the alternate ending. That's it. No commentary, no ""X Years Later"" feature or anything. With this franchise being such a cult hit, you'd think that there would be some kind of retrospect feature.

3849555,5,B0025VLEMK,"A smart-alecky, average joe named Ash, after losing his girlfriend and his right-hand fighting demons in a cabin in the woods, gets spat out of a portal through time and lands smack dab in the dark ages, where two warring kingdoms also struggle with an invading force of pure evil gradually taking possession. They are the ancient ones, and only the chosen one has the power to defeat them. That chosen one, of course, is chainsaw armed, shotgun wielding Ash, AKA Bruce Campbell, vs. the Army of Darkness.

Basically, this movie is pure awesomeness! I can still remember the first time I saw it. I luckily had become an Evil Dead fan in a few years earlier thanks to late night airings on the A&E network back when cable TV was much cooler (okay, well, you do have stuff like Walking Dead now, but also about ten million reality shows). However, I had no idea there was a third one being made, and when I went to see Army of Darkness with a friend in 1992, I really didn't realize what it was I was sitting down to see. Then, I saw the prologue. It was Evil Dead 3! And yet, this movie was sooo much more than the Evil Dead films! Okay, it wasn't scary like those ones were (well, they were to me as a kid watching them alone in the dark in the middle of the night), it was more funny. Army of Darkness is definitely more of an action/adventure/comedy than a horror film, though it still shares enough of the look, feel, and even scenarios of the previous two installments to work as a true part 3. And Bruce has really come into his own here, far beyond anything he was in the previous two films. He is the ultimate sarcastic anti-hero with the coolest gear and the best catch phrases! ""Army of Darkness"" is one of the best, funniest fantasy horror films you're ever gonna find, so make sure you check this one out! You'll see why so many people were excited to see Bruce in each of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films. Yes, if you didn't know, Sam Raimi got his start with the Evil Dead trilogy!

As for the Blu-Ray, well,... some scenes look pretty bad, and this thing is pretty weak on bonus features. I hadn't gotten this on DVD (I had it on VHS forever though), so I was thrilled to get the Blu-Ray, but this ""Screwhead Edition"" definitely leaves a lot to be desired since there aren't many bonus features either. You get the alternate ending, which is hilarious, but I'm glad it wasn't the ending they used, and you get a featurettes that is mostly about the monster effects. It's pretty cool. But, that's it. Seriously? The Evil Dead movies had better bonus features. Maybe you're supposed to focus on the U-Control and BD-Live enhancements, but while I love bonus features, I don't bother with that stuff, just like I never used to bother with CD-ROM bonus features. Maybe if I had a wifi router, but right now I don't. Anyways, still a must-own movie, so I highly recommend picking this up. It will always been one of my favorites! I even dressed up as Ash for Halloween once, and I hope to do it again in the future (and maybe for some cons)!",1349568000,,3046,4.398936170212766

I'd also like to point out that the ending on this is the S Mart ending, NOT the time travel one. The time travel one is on there as a bonus but not as part of the movie. Couldn't stand that ending being tied in when I had the Official Bootleg version of the movie.

How could it miss? It has it all--severed body parts, witches that will ""swallow your soul"", a damsel in distress (who initially hates the hero), a chain saw replacing the hero's severed hand and an evil spirit that will arise if the hero doesn't save the day while saying ""Klaatu verada nikto"".

Ash (Bruce Campbell)the ultimate idiot hero gets sucked through a vortex and ends up in the Dark Ages. Captured by Lord Arthur and believed to be an agent for the Scottish Duke Henry, Ash fights off a creature in the pit (they are being put to death). His only chance to get back is to help reclaim the book Necronomicon Ex-Mortis from a haunted forest. Oh, and there's THREE books to choose from one of which bites and the other has a vortex inside it. When Ash takes the book but forgets to properly say ""Klaatu Verada nikto"" the army of the dead are released led by Evil Ash. Yep. It's absurd, funny and gross--a very nice combination.

The ""Screwhead Edition"" improves on the DVD edition but you'll see quality as broad as the humor in the film--it varies exceptionally good looking to so-so depending on the use of visuals, etc. Keep in mind this was shot pre-CGI using a variety of visual effects techniques so sometimes its really soft, grainy and sometimes not. The Screwhead Edition is also much brighter than previous, darker DVDs. Which one is right? I dunno but if you're used to the older DVDs prepare for a bit of a shock.

Audio sounds pretty good remixed for six channels although it's not going to blow out your windows nor suck you into the vortex.

The special features are...a bit underwhelming. There's no commentary track which was one of the delights of the previous editions (which had multiple commentary tracks that were different for each edition as I recall). We get a featurette ""The Making of the Deadites"" a pretty good retrospective glimpse back into the making of the film featuring the visual effects supervisors.

We also get the original (alternate) ending which Raimi was forced to reshoot by Universal executives after a preview as well as the trailer.

If you're getting this as an ultimate edition you'll be disappointed but if you can get this inexpensively as an upgrade, I would enjoy it for what it is--a fun, campy flick with Campbell in top form and a nice looking, lighter looking transfer.

I'd love to give this edition five stars (hey, I love the film) but Universal originally was going to provide more extras (including commentary tracks). I'm not sure what exactly happened but hopefully we'll eventually see that edition released.",1345248000,4,3246,5.365422396856582

Unable to close the portal, Ash along with his '73 Oldsmobile are warped into England's dark ages.

Now Ash armed with chainsaw, BOOMstick and chemistry textbook must battle an army of ""Deadites""; if only those magic words weren't so damn hard to pronounce!

Is it any good?

Sam Raimi gives us more uncontrollable insanity in the final installment of the 'Evil Dead' trilogy. This time we are given more of an effects driven fantasy action-adventure rather than horror. The gross-out gore and horror is replaced with an ocean of slapstick comedy; alienating some fans. Nevertheless 'Army of Darkness' is still good fun, Raimi's direction is still fast paced as with the first two and Bruce Campbell is funnier than ever pulling some hilariously memorable lines. So grab that BOOMstick, grip firmly, squeeze and ""hail to the King, baby"".

3849561,5,B0025VLEMK,"Being the final installment to the Evil Dead series, this movie stands up to its precedent stories, although the treatment is different here. Indeed, Raimi, known for his genre-mixing movies, has opted for a comedic and adventurous story in Army of Darkness, as we find Ash fighting his way across hordes of demonic entities while trying to find his way back to the twentieth century.

Although I was surprised to see that the story wasn't set in the Middle-East like in the original ending of Evil Dead 2, but in England instead, the plot really kept me into my seat. Even better, it  foreshadowed what Robert Tapert and Sam Raimi would do on Xena and Hercules, mixing dramatic action scenes with comedic situations, and an excellent soundtrack from Joseph LoDuca. If there were times when I felt the comedy was more evident in this movie, there are still some scary situations to endure, like when the Dead spirits, through Sam Raimi's camera, harass Ash and force him to hide in a windmill.

If I had one criticism to the story, it is that the Sheila character was a bit too stereotypical in the damsel-in-distress way that she and Ash interacted. Not only that, I felt their romance was a bit forced upon us and I don't think it would have hurt the story if there hadn't been any romance for us to see.

Technically, the fights and special effects were well done and more impressive. They also included a great use of the stop-motion animation, most notably with the Deadmites army. But my favorite effects were the mini-versions of Ash who torture him in the windmill. Their actions towards Ash were funny and add to Bruce's talent as a comedy actor.

Again on the technical aspect, although there are some shots in the movie that are still grainy and dirty (like a view of the castle at night, or during the fight with the ""She-bitch"" (says Ash!)), this movie's High Definition is amazing. Indeed, the image is so clear that you can even see the sweat and the pores on the actors' faces. And even though you can see the dirt on the camera for one shot, this Blu-Ray's images make it worth buying this movie. Especially when the excellent Dolby sound effect makes this movie experience great to listen to.

As for the bonuses, I was glad to see the first ending that they wanted to use, and I'm happy that they reshot it and gave the official, and better, finale because it worked better in the comedic tone of this movie, unlike Evil Dead 2 which had a more dramatic tension than Army of Darkness.

In the end, this movie is a treat for those who are ready to kick back from the week's work, and enjoy a good adventure. One that, once again, foreshadows what would be done on Xena and Hercules.",1332374400,,2700,4.554639175257732

I don't notice tiny little imperfections in movies that I watch simply because I'm watching a movie to be entertained.  That being said, I very much enjoyed the Blu-Ray version of Army of Darkness (Screwhead Edition).  The picture looked great to me and the movie is hilarious.",1269648000,3,346,4.733333333333333

3849582,2,B0025VLEMK,"Let me start by saying that I love this movie - I am not rating the movie itself poorly.  Trying to watch the Blu Ray 'Screwhead Edition' gives me a headache, though.  Didn't anyone watch this oversharpened mess before they published it?  It's as if they turned the contrast all of the way up, and called it good.  Chainmail alternately disappears, and blinds as every link become a brilliant shining white - Same with BC's hair, sometimes it's dark, other times it looks white.  Occasionally the picture gets so grainy that if you didn't know better, you'd think that it was a stylized flashback scene.  I'm sorry I put out the extra money to buy this version - my regular old school dvd (and honestly, even my vhs version) look better than this.  It's a trick, get an axe!",1267228800,7,774,4.525179856115108
3849583,4,B0025VLEMK,"4 of 5 stars for the ah ah sci-fi? action? fantasy movie Army of Darkness. I first looked at the cover art and read the liner notes and thought ""here we go with a real-B movie, sigh"". I started watching and it was funny and interesting. Watching the Blu-Ray I was really impressed with the image quality--super sharp and clear, it looked almost like video rather than film. So early-on, I'm thinking this is a spoof movie, but no, it was a straight fantasy/comedy movie. Then it hit me! This is a tribute to the Ray Harryhousen movie (Sinbad). Then I noticed this movie has everything from stop-action creatures, alot of rubber suits and alot of real models of creatures. Yeah, some CG, but not much. It really has the look and feel of the old Sinbad movies.

The plot is of a ""S-mart"" sales guy getting transported to the 1300's to fight against Deadites and recover an artifact book. Bruce Campbell did an outstanding job in the lead role. This movie was a pleasure to watch. Stupid comedy in places, old-style effects, silly quest and it is all fun fun fun! This is on my watch-it-again list.",1261699200,8,1095,4.53030303030303

3849585,4,B0025VLEMK,"Bruce Campbell at his best. How cool can it be for an egotistical trailer park red neck to end up in the Middle Ages with a chain saw for an arm? This is a B movie for sure, but you can't stop watching it. The verbal come backs from Bruce are just too funny. Send the wife away and settle down with a 6-pack. You'll love it! I don't see any differences with the screwhead edition, but it doesn't matter, its HiDef!",1255910400,2,414,4.060975609756097
3849586,5,B0025VLEMK,"I own all 3 of the movies, and by far, this one is the best, has the best comedic lines and the most ridiculous stuff.  highly recommended if you own the other two.  If your new, then your are going to end up liking them.  Like it happen with me.",1255737600,3,246,3.88
3849587,4,B0025VLEMK,"It goes without saying that AOD rocks.  However, a few critics have given this current release the ol' battleaxe. Sure the picture is a little washed out by DNR. So what if there's hardley any hint of film grain. It ain't Casino, people! It still blows my old version og AOD(official bootleg) out of the water 10 times over. There is the issue with a few small missing scenes here and there, but the new edition of Army of Darkness is more than enough to tide some of us primitive screwheads over.",1255564800,2,497,4.4021739130434785
3849588,5,B0025VLEMK,"I can't comment on all the various release editions but I will buy the blu-ray edition. I just want to make it clear - THIS IS A GUY MOVIE! Don't expect more. My wife, daughter, and daughters in-law all hate it. BUT, as much as they hate it - the guys in our family love it. It is best watched with other guys and your typical layout of movie snacks on a lazy rainy afternoon. The guys in our family rate it right up there with Christmas Vacation, The Godfather, Monty Python and the search for the Holy Grail. and other classics! Expect a lot of fun - not Gone with the Wind.

If there are women out there who love this movie - accept my apology - your men are lucky guys!",1255478400,4,673,4.06015037593985
3849589,4,B0025VLEMK,"It's hard to say no to another edition of Sam Raimi's comedy/horror cult classic, Army of Darkness. The brand new Screwhead Edition is the film's first release on Blu-ray.

Army of Darkness is the sequel to the comedy/horror classic Evil Dead II and continues the adventures of Ash (Bruce Campbell). After discovering a great evil in the wood and being attacked by a wild (yet quirky) horde of undead (and even having to kill his possessed girlfriend), Ash is dropped into medieval England, where he finds that he evil he experienced in his own time is gaining strength in the Middle Ages. In order to get back home, Ash strikes a deal with the locals, where he must venture into a creepy cemetery and retrieve the Necronomicon.

Unfortunately, the recovery mission doesn't go as smoothly as planned, and Ash unleashes the forces of the dead. In order to fix his mistake, get back to his own time, and save his medieval girlfriend, Ash teams up with a group of medieval screwheads -- complete with epic one-liners, boomsticks (retails for about a hundred and nine, ninety-five... shop smart, shop S-Mart), gory she-bitches, chainsaws, and corny special effects filled with awesome.

The picture quality here is phenomenal. It is so crisp and clear -- the light colors have absolutely no blemishes, and the dark colors are deep and true. I've never seen this movie presented with such perfect picture and sound quality. This version makes all previous editions, even the DVD edition, look gritty and low quality by comparison. The picture is so clear that it emphasizes how corny the special effects are -- which I think adds to the overall experience of the film and keeps it true to Raimi's original intent.

I was particularly impressed by the sound quality. I felt like I was completely enveloped in the universe of Army of Darkness. Danny Elfman's ""March of the Dead"" theme has never had the same kind of power and pure epic sound to it than in this release. I could see the speakers shaking with intensity at nearly every note. It was the most amazing Army of Darkness viewing experience I have ever had. With a 1080p high-definition presentation in 1.85:1 widescreen and master audio in 5.1 surround sound, it's easy to see why. There are even Spanish and French subtitles available.

However, I was very disappointed in the selection of bonus material here. While viewers do have the option to turn on interactive production stills during the movie, which is kind of fun, there's not much else. Viewers have the opportunity to go online and get other film information, but it's not very complete (and frankly, this involves too much effort). The disk includes the alternate ending, the theatrical trailer, and a feature on the creation of the ""deadite"" special effects. The feature is really interesting and includes some great interviews with special effects experts and some hilarious and informative footage from the original filming. It's really interesting to see all of this, but I would have liked to have seen more of the original footage since some of it has obviously survived. There aren't even interviews with Sam Raimi or Bruce Campbell here. Some fans may think that this would be unneeded because they have talked about Army of Darkness so many times, but if I'm going to plop down extra money for this Blu-ray, I would have liked to have more.

It's difficult to say whether or not the Blu-ray edition of Army of Darkness is worth it, especially with so many other editions out there. If you are looking for flawless video and audio quality, then the Blu-ray is the perfect choice, but if you want bonus features, the items available here are practically the same as the others out there. Despite the lack of additional material, I couldn't help but stare in awe at how gorgeous this movie looks.",1254096000,19,3819,4.8318042813455655
