8112257,4,B000EOTTPO,Love the movie. But excuse me this movie has been out for a long time and charging 45.00 to buy is well not good of a movie.,1514332800,,124,3.6296296296296298

8112259,1,B000EOTTPO,"ok. i am a suker for pirate movies. this one sucks. none of it really made sense. caesar's boats looked they had been made in peru from reeds. the only other remarkable thing about the movie were the peclaces the pirate chief wore.(he was played by gordon mitchell. most of the action in the movie was his flexing his pecs.) and, the playback was horrible.

now, the good part. i received an email from amazon saying they had noticed the poor playback and were refunding my money. excellent. (and i shouldcsay that if the sound had been better synched with the action, it might have been somewhat less obtuse.)",1363737600,2,610,4.5963302752293576
