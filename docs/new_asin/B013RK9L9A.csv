7370795,1,B013RK9L9A,How could anyone in their right mind give this movie a 5 star rating? It doesn't even deserve one star! Not even an eighth of a star! The producer and the director should be incarcerated for mental cruelty!,1497225600,,206,4.447368421052632

7370812,1,B013RK9L9A,"Worst movie I have seen in sometime.  Very disappointed in Dolph Lundgren's performance.  Totally hated the movie, fast forwarded through most of it, couldn't wait for it to end.",1455321600,2,178,5.103448275862069
7370813,4,B013RK9L9A,It was a pretty good movie as shark attack films go,1454630400,3,51,3.727272727272727

7370819,2,B013RK9L9A,"In the town of Alpine Lake, locate on Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in a movie called Shark Lake, filmed in Mississippi, Clint Gray (Dolph Lundgren) deals in illegal and exotic animals. During a police chase, a bull shark gets loose in the lake, unknown to everyone for five years, the same amount time Clint was in jail. Clint's young daughter Carly (Lily Brooks O'Briant) is adopted by arresting Officer Hernandez (Sara Malakul Lane). When shark attacks in the lake start to happen, everyone wants to get into the act.

Sharks once again attack undetected in clear water one foot deep. The chracter Garreth Ross (Miles Doleac) playing a BBC star should have been extended. He had saved the film from dying and needed and expanded role. The character of Clint Gray was not well developed and his relationship with his crime boss was superficial. Much of the shark fighting was done at night and the shark fin looked extremely fake. Rubber shark close-ups with stock footage, but not as bad as an Ed Wood film.

Guild: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Felt like a made for TV film.",1450483200,4,1067,4.7005347593582885
7370820,1,B013RK9L9A,did not like it very poor quality,1450051200,,33,3.857142857142857
7370821,1,B013RK9L9A,The worst fake special effects I have ever seen! This movie must have been made with a $200 budget and the actors must have volunteered!,1449878400,3,136,4.48

7370823,5,B013RK9L9A,My hero showing a softer side. He's working on it.  I enjoyed the action combined with the message about how people and sharks protect their young.,1449187200,2,147,4.653846153846154
7370824,4,B013RK9L9A,Good movie!,1446940800,,11,5.0
7370825,5,B013RK9L9A,"Excellent film with better-than-average cast in a well-written feature which teaches a few interesting facts: Bull sharks CAN and DO live in fresh water and are one of the most aggressive sharks in the world. So, rather scarily, the events in this movie could actually happen!

Nice to see Dolph Lundgren in top form, as the bad guy who pays his ""debt"" and becomes a good guy after his release from prison. Will he get killed in the end, trying to save...well, I'm not giving away the ending, you'll have to get a DVD for your own and watch!

Watch for Sara Lane as police officer Meredith Hernandez; she's quite a good actress!",1446508800,10,628,4.548672566371682
7370826,3,B013RK9L9A,"This film would be rated PG-13. There is plenty of shark action and the acting and script are good. Most of the special FX are good.

7370827,1,B013RK9L9A,Sorry but this one bored me to death and I didn't finish it.  Nothing was happening to hold my attention.,1445731200,3,105,4.25
7370828,1,B013RK9L9A,JAWS meets Lake Placid. That's it. Its a JAWS ripoff. Don't watch it or buy it. Its terrible.,1445644800,2,93,4.222222222222222

7370832,1,B013RK9L9A,"The acting in this movie is horrendous! I have never written a review for a movie before, but I just wasted $7 and can't even finish the movie it's so bad!",1444780800,4,155,4.032258064516129
7370833,5,B013RK9L9A,I especially likes the parasailing scenes. Awesome.,1444262400,,51,6.428571428571429
8728573,3,B013RK9L9A,"A typical B-movie.  Premise sort of silly but in a way entertaining.  It didn't take long to root for the shark to get the British blowhard, and it didn't.  And after awhile, you even began to root for the shark to get Meredith, but that didn't happen.  There is a moral to be learned, in that one should not assume something just from a person's past.  People can redeem themselves.  It took Meredith a long time to learn that lesson, however.  And to do that they had to throw in a child in jeopardy, which is a cheap trick, and some would be offended by that.",1535414400,,562,4.245283018867925
8728574,2,B013RK9L9A,"People can always get better at things, but the girl cop , Sara Malakul Lane, is definitely not a natural.  Her acting was so forced and over the top that I couldn't take it seriously.  Watch the first five minutes, and you'll see what I mean.",1535241600,,243,4.260869565217392
8728575,3,B013RK9L9A,Sharks looked fake.,1534896000,,19,5.666666666666667
8728576,5,B013RK9L9A,"Interesting and well done. Great acting.  Sharks, been on the news, have been found in fresh water and that is indeed a scary thought. It was suggested in this story t g at someone put shark (spoiler alert) sharks in lake. Gory in some spots fyi",1534723200,,245,4.326086956521739

8728578,5,B013RK9L9A,I just like Dolph Lundgren. Such a tough guy. Even the shark couldn't eat him. That is pretty tough.,1533859200,,100,4.315789473684211
8728579,1,B013RK9L9A,"What a piece of garbage.  Sharks can't live in fresh water.  Second the acting is fourth rate, and the dialogue is idiotic.  The director should be arrested.",1533772800,,157,4.7407407407407405
8728580,3,B013RK9L9A,"when we think of great shark movies, it pretty much begins and ends with jaws, and rightfully so.  it hasn't been done better.  there have been plenty of quality, high entertainment shark movies, like jaws 2, deep blue see, the shallows, 47 meters down, and bait (i also have lots of love for jaws 3d).  and we have open water, which is a nerve shredding emotional look at these fish and the instinctual fear we have of them. shark lake (2015) on the other hand...i actually liked this low budget, kind of awful flick. sara lane is wonderful as the deputy sheriff of a small lake town that finds its' waters besieged by a bull shark that escaped five years earlier from an illegal exotic animal dealer. as you might expect, the special effects are TERRIBLE. shark lake works best when we see a dorsal fin and then people acting scared. it proves that you can make a shark movie without showing sharks because when they do it looks horrid and made me wish they weren't showing them. i liked the characters, dolph lungdren brings his, um, c+ game, and there is frequent intelligent dialogue.",1533772800,,1089,4.574358974358974
