2560393,5,B000FC2GFU,"I watched Dark Shadows as a kid and was intrigued with the series.  There were many things on the show I didn't understand, but I continued to watch. One day my child-care provider introduced the series to me and I was hooked ever since. Never, had I known or seen the ending, so this is my chance to see it all over again with a more understanding of the series. Because of these DVDs, I was able to attend my first Dark Shadow Festival in Brooklyn, NY, the year before Jonathan Frid past.  I got to meet Lara Parker, David Selby, Jerry Lacy, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Roger Davis, and many others because of these DVD's. Thanks Amazon.",1388793600,4,632,4.3931623931623935
2560394,3,B000FC2GFU,"One of the greatest shows ever created had gone off the rails by this point. Parallel Time has gone on forever with diminishing results. The removal of Barnabas as a vampire was a huge mistake, & having Jonathan Frid become Bramwell Collins seems a desperate & misguided idea. Instead of really returning to 1971 (as they do for about 5 minutes), the characters keep spinning off into other past realities. John Karlen's interview at end of disk 2 sums it up: ""It wasn't Dark Shadows anymore.""

On the positive side, the one-note child actors (David & what's-her-name) who dominated collection 24 are not evident at this point--thankfully. They also got rid of the annoying miscreant Gerard. But it is hard to watch these last episodes without remembering what a fantastic show it was in the first 10 collections with Barnabas.",1381536000,,827,4.9071428571428575
2560395,5,B000FC2GFU,My kids and I really got into watching these. Can't believe my kids like watching these because they were popular back when I was young.,1380499200,,136,4.48
2560396,5,B000FC2GFU,"One of the reviewers said that only Kate Jackson had later success. David Selby (Quentin) played on Falcon Crest (a primetime soap opera along the lines of Dallas and Dynasty) for 9 years and has appeared in several notable movies including the recent 'The Social Network'.  John Karlen (Willie Loomis)won an emmy for his recurring role on Cagney and Lacey (playing Harvey Lacey)and guest-starred on prominent TV shows throughout the 70's, 80's, and 90's and had recurring roles on several. Roger Davis (Peter Bradford) left the cast early and went on to star in ""Alias Smith and Jones"" replacing Pete Duel.  Louis Edmonds spent 16 years on ""All My Children"" and was nominated for several Emmy awards.  Joel Crothers starred in numerous soap operas and on stage until his death in 1985. Denise Nickerson did numerous projects including 'Violet' in 'Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" until she voluntarily retired from acting at age 21.  Katherine Leigh Scott also acted steadily guest-starring on prime-time and acting as hostess for ""Disney"" specials.",1367107200,7,1058,5.169590643274854
2560397,5,B000FC2GFU,"This series is very well presented. It is a ""soapopera"" but brings in the occult to enhance the suspense! Brings back great memory of the late '60's and early '70's",1365724800,,164,4.5
2560398,5,B000FC2GFU,These video's bring back my childhood when I watched this show with my mom. It's entertaining with it's hammy acting and fun to look for the mistakes in each episode. Cult Classic All the Way!,1360281600,,192,4.514285714285714

2560400,4,B000FC2GFU,"Good quality video.....except for the ""Re-created"" missing episode. Love the end of the 1840 storyline, but not crazy about the final storyline of the show were Barnabas is now Bramwell.",1358726400,,186,5.233333333333333
2560421,5,B000FC2GFU,"I bought all the Dark Shadows Collections and I have enjoyed them a lot, Nice to watch when there is not anything else to watch.",1353456000,,128,4.16
2560422,5,B000FC2GFU,The item came as advertised and I did not have any problems with its delivery or condition once I opened and played it.,1331424000,,119,4.217391304347826
2560423,4,B000FC2GFU,"The 1841 parallel time just isn't Dark Shadows to me.
As John Karlen states in his interview, how can you have DS,
without Barnabas Collins. He's the star of the show, the main
character, and without him, it just doesn't work. I kept waiting
for Barnabas to appear somehow, and just finally gave up. But,
Vol. 25 is still worth watching, mainly because of the excellent
acting by Lara Parker and Nancy Barrett. As Catherine, Ms. Parker
does her best acting of the entire series. She states in her interview
that Dan Curtis finally gave her wish to be the heroine, and she really
steals the entire 1841 plot. She also states that truth be known, that she
thought that she would go on to be a major motion picture star, and that DS
would be the stepping stone to great things for her in Hollywood. It's
too bad this didn't happen for her. It's ironic that out of all of the
very fine actors that played in DS, only Kate Jackson had any real later
success.
The women's costuming is also very well done, especially Catherine's wedding
dress, with the flowers placed up and down her sleeves. The women's dresses
helped to make the 1841 story line much more bearable to watch. Although
it is said that Jonathan Frid was tired of being the vampire, he is not a romantic leading man type, and is totally unbelievable as Bramwell. He's also handicapped by the ridiculous costume that he has to wear. It makes him look like the Parisian poet, Rodolfo, in the opera La Boheme, while the other men's costumes are more tastefully done.
I used to watch DS, at my fraternity house, when I was in college. All of
the guys really fell in love with Lara Parker and those amazing eyes of hers.
We even made her our fraternity sweetheart in 1969. So getting to see her as
the star of the 1841 plot, was a real treat for me.
I just purchased the entire series that is to come out in April, and I can't
wait to have DS at my finger tips every day. To me, this was the best show ever, and it's too bad that we can't all go back in time and relive that wonderful era.",1329609600,5,2043,4.322916666666667
2560424,5,B000FC2GFU,"I grew up watching the original Dark Shadows, I and loved it then as now. I am collecting the entire set of Dark Shadows, they do bring back memories of childhood-when it was shown as a soap opera and we couldn't wait to see it daily.  LOVE IT.",1329264000,,244,4.083333333333333
2560425,3,B000FC2GFU,"The 1840 Gerrard Stiles/witchcraft storyline is wrapped up in a hurry at the beginning of this set of DVDs and moves on to another parallel time story. Daphne Harridge and others discover a room in an abandoned wing of the house where they can open the door to *another world*, where people look the same, but their lives are very different. After Barnabas and Julia return to 1970 after completing their mission to save Collinwood from destruction the 1840 parallel time storyline takes over. There's a spin off of Wuthering heights with Angelique (Lara Parker) as Catherine and Barnabas (Jonathan Frid) as Bramwell Collins. Cathy and a brooding whiny Heathcliff all over again :/

The main focus of this storyline though is that of a curse on the Collins family, and a secret room. Each generation a member of the Collins family must spend a night in the room, and all who have spent the night end up either mad or dead. The person is chosen by a lottery and the bulk of these four DVDs is all about who draws the paper with the ""X"" on it. Over and over and over again, making this for a very tedious storyline so far, things really didn't pick up until the last of DVD four and by that time I didn't care very much.

Pluses to this storyline; no magic, vampires, witches, warlocks, time travel or anything supernatural. However, without all that this just wasn't as much fun, especially with Frid and all that emotional angst over his lost love, hate for the Collins family and his plans for revenge. Frid is a fine actor, but the role of Bramwell just doesn't suit him. Not even David Selby (Quentin) was able to salvage anything from this. The clothes were a hoot though, as I suspect the costume folks had more of a free hand working on an alternate time and not having to be quite so authentic. 1970s colors abounded.

One more DVD to go and then this series is over and I can get back to reading :)",1329004800,5,1906,4.471264367816092
2560426,5,B000FC2GFU,"This show is so much fun for me. I can just watch it over and over. I love that the show utelized elements of classic literature for its storylines as well.
