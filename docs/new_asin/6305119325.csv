969413,2,6305119325,"The ""Carry On"" series was a staple of British cinema for decades, with the action centering on an ensemble of comedians (like America's Bowery Boys or Japan's Crazy Cats). In this one, sharp Sid James and dull Bernard Bresslaw try to entice their reserved girlfriends to a racy campsite; unhappily married Terry Scott expects a bleak vacation with his preoccupied wife; sissy Charles Hawtrey wants to experience the great outdoors; prissy officials of a girls' school escort their nubile students on a field trip. Naturally everyone converges at the same place, with predictably absurd complications in the tents, in the shower, and on the campgrounds. ""Carry On Camping"" seems to be typical of the series, with broad performances, double-entendre dialogue, and punchlines telegraphed far in advance for maximum effect. Except for a ""newsreel"" of a nudist colony at the very beginning, the action is fairly tame in the music-hall/burlesque tradition. British viewers raised on this stuff will like it best; American viewers will find it a cross between Benny Hill and the ""Love, American Style"" TV sitcom. The players tackle the corny script with gusto, even when some of the jokes are ancient (a farm girl taking her cow to the bull is asked, ""Couldn't your father do that?"" and the girl replies, ""No, it's got to be the bull""). Benny Hill actually used this same gag, with similar results, and fans of Hill's unsubtle comedy will find the same obvious but surefire humor here. Print quality and video transfer are very good.",998611200,5,1526,5.0355731225296445
969414,4,6305119325,"Many critics argue that Carry On Camping (1968) was the peak of the series. The Carry On films had enjoyed immense success throughout the 1960's with titles such as the critically acclaimed, Up The Kyber (1968), Doctor (1967), Don't Lose Your Head (1966), Screaming (1966), Cowboy (1965) and Cleo (1964). Many critics savaged the series, but the films proved a popular success. Quite simply the films could be more accuratley described as cheap and cheerful. They might not have been Shakespeare but they did at times come up with films like Carry on Camping which were actually fine blends of comedy.
Sid (Sid James) and his reluctant mate, Bernie (Bernard Bresslaw) decide to take their irresponsve girl friends (Joan Sims and Dilys Laye) to a nudist camp site, only through a misunderstanding they end up at the wrong Paradise Holiday Camp, which was just a perfectly normal camping site. It is run by Mr. Fiddler (a fitting title and masterfully played by Peter Butterworth) who is amusing with his blatant attempts to get as much money as possible from the customers. Meanwhile Kenneth Williams and Hattie Jaques run a strictly run finishing school for young ladies with star pupil being the bubbly Barbra Windsor. She is in whats perharps the most famous Carry On scene, where her bikini top flys off during her morning exercises. There's also Terry Scot, begrudgingly tagging along with his ghastly wife, played marvelously by Betty Marsden who causes much amusement with her horse-like laugh. Amongst the fun and games is also Charles Hawtrey, who is, as ever, hilarious with his flamboyantly camp characterisation. ...
As for Carry On Camping, well this is perfect to introduce a new comer to the series. Although the nudge-nudge wink-wink humour is all laughably innocent now, it still makes amusing viewing, if only for the awfulness of the corny gags which are deliciously delivered by these talented, irreplacable actors. All the carry On greats are included - Sid James, Joan Sims, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Barbara Windsor, Hattie Jaques, Terry Scott and Bernard Bresslaw. Highly recommended - a classic!",996278400,3,2128,5.100286532951289
969415,4,6305119325,"Yes, the stars camp it up all the way in this, the 15th ""Carry On"" made in 1969. This is probably the best film to show a newcomer to the ""Carry On"" world because: a) It was made in 1969 when the  stars and films were (in my mind) at their peak. (Carry On Doctor, and  Carry On the Khyber from this time are also excellent.) b) It contains  nearly all the Carry On stars - Butterworth, Sims, Hawtrey, Jaques, Terry  Scott etc and so there is no ""there's something missing"" feeling.  c) It is funny throughout. No flat patches. The film revolves around the  expectation Sid James and Bernard Bresslaw have of  taking their  girlfriends to a nudist colony, but nothing turns out the way they expect  it to. Kenneth Williams and Hattie Jaques run a girls school aptly named  ""Chaste Place"" and take the students to the same location. The  dialogue is as ridiculously corny as ever.  Eg: When Jaques goes after  Williams she cries ""Haven't I got appeal?"" to which he replies  ""Yes, but so has a banana and I don't even want that."" The movie  however does have appeal and is a fun ride throughout.",956448000,2,1092,4.417085427135678
969416,4,6305119325,"Number 17 in the Carry On series, this has to be the funniest. I never stop laughing all the way through it! Every time I see Charles Hawtrey, in specs and all legs, looking for somewhere to camp for the night, I'm almost crying with laughter. The plot is simple, it begins with a couple of men,  Sid James and Bernard Bresslaw, who want to take their girlfriends on  holiday. Then Kenneth Williams and Hattie Jaques want to take their  all-girls school on holiday. This likely bunch, along with many others, end  up at 'Paradise Holiday Camp'. What follows is British humor at its best,  over sexed school girls, randy men and inuendos a-plenty. One of my  favourite bits is when Charles Hawtrey finds somewhere to sleep, a tent  shared by a henpecked husband and his nagging wife. When the 3 of them are  trying to get changed for bed in this tiny orange tent in the middle of a  field, I just crack up. One of the most famous scenes is the one where a  young Barbara Windsor is doing some morning exercises and in a sudden  thrust of excitement, her bikini top flies off, landing in the very camp  Kenneth Williams hands. With a cry of, 'ooh, Matron, take them away',  Barbara is led away by the matronly Hattie Jaques. It is wonderful, and  perfect for someone who has never seen a 'Carry On' film, it is an absolute  British classic!",956361600,6,1338,4.448559670781893

7883371,5,6305119325,"One of the best of the Carry On series second only to Carry On At Your Convenience. Really side cracking nudge-nudge ,wink-wink humour , you should find yourself laughing  two dozen times during this show.
Nostalgic value is aside not the least reason either for seeing this movie, which was filmed and hit the screens in a gentler, nice Britain more the dreadful political correctness , with its witch hunts and dour inquisitors, which has brought Britain to her knees.
Sid (Sid James) and Bernie (Bernard Bresslaw) decide to take their girlfriends Joan (Joan Fussey) and the nervously disposed Dilys (Anthea Meeks) camping, Sid thinking they are on the way to a nudist camp, but it ends up being a standard family camp, which is at the moment being visited by a finishing school of adorable, over sexed schoolgirls the ring leader being the bubbly , sexy and funny Babs (Barbara Windsor) and their strict and pompous schoolmaster Dr Kenneth Soper (Kenneth Williams) and the bumbling, controlling Miss Haggerd (Hatti Jaques).

Also thrown into the mix are Peter Potter (Terry Scott) who really doesnt want to be there and would rather be in Monaco, and his annoying , domineering wife Harriet (Betty Marsden) as well as the camp bespectacled Charles Hawtrey playing the unfortunate Charlie Muggins. This movie is well known for the much publicized scene where Babs' bra comes flying off during physical training. Judged risque at the time, it is all we see now very innocent.
And we conclude with the campers chasing off a band of hippies in the nearby meadow, but to the Dr Soper and Miss Haggard's horror the funloving girls stow away with the hippy band.

The stars of this show are undoubtedly Barbara Windsor and Sid James but all of the cast provide side splitting humour in the perfect intro to anyone who has not yet had the pleasure of seeing the Carry On series",1364860800,,1872,4.807453416149069
7883372,4,6305119325,"The Carry On team pokes fun at an old established british tradition or two in Carry On Camping.

Back in the days before discovering Majorca, British holidays meant one of three things: going to the seaside and staying in any one of the myriad of Bed & Breakfast establishments that adorned the seafront, participating in the holiday camps such as Butlins, or going camping.

In the case of the former, meals (and much else besides) were taken under the watchful eye of the landlord and landlady, while at Butlins there were many blazer garbed chaperones, leaving camping as the holiday of choice for those who wanted to do their own thing.

Of course, camping then was much less comfortable requiring much hardier souls as well as those looking for a sense of adventure.

Carry On Camping is a rollicking send up of many of the aspects of life in those, simpler, carefree days. Packed full of innuendo, we find much of the stereotypical views of the English contained therein, but, as the film shows, the age of innocence, can easily be scraped away to show a sleasier underside.

The film also mocks the nascent hippy movement whose Peter Pan aspects are displayed  and which are all to easily undermined by those with a more hard-nosed approach. This prescient treatment underscores the demise of the peace and lovement at the hands of worldwise drug dealers and criminals a couple of years down the road.

Good for a laugh but the nature of the beast is such that it displays many signs of age and holds much less appeal to people today, a lot of whom would not recognise those aspects of Britain's past.",1244505600,,1608,4.680851063829787
7883373,3,6305119325,"The film was funny,a typical Carry On. The quality was only fair, but it is listed as an Asian copy. It is hard to find some of the older comedies, so a fair copy is better then none.",1209081600,,183,3.8421052631578947
7883374,4,6305119325,"This is about average for a Carry On script.  The original movie was wide screen.  This DVD chops the edges off so that it fits a traditional 4:3 screen.  Your other option is the WHAM ! USA version also on amazon.  It shrinks the image so that it fits the 4:3 screen sideways and is shorter than the screen vertically.  It also has some vertical jitter.

As far as the plot goes, there are different groups of people who go camping and end up at the same campground.  Each group has adventures before and after arriving including interacting with each other.  There is a bit of ndity (both men and women) for under a minute total or so.",1202256000,3,637,4.338983050847458
7883375,5,6305119325,Carry on camping straddles that happy period between the inventive but somewhat dull early carry ons and the overly crude and suggestive later films.

7883376,5,6305119325,"Carry On Camping is the 17th film in the long running Carry On film series, which is the most successful and longest running comedy film series in Britain. 31 films were produced between 1958 (Carry On Sergeant) and 1992 (Carry On Columbus) with a new one scheduled to start filming in 2007. Carry On Camping was launched in 1961 when the Carry On series was at its peak and contains many memorable scenes like the one where Barbra Windsor loses her bra during exercise. Both Carry On Camping and Carry On up the Khyber took more money than any other film at the Box Office in Britain in 1969. Carry On Camping stars all of the Carry On Regulars (Kenneth Williams, Barbra Windsor, Hattie Jacques, Charles Hawtrey, Terry Scott, Bernard Bresslaw, Sid James, Peter Butterworth etc)

  Carry On Camping is one of the finest and funniest out of the 31 films produced which all but three are among the funniest films ever made. Carry On England, Carry On Emmanuelle and carry On Columbus (the last three to be made) lose their way, as it is evident in Carry On England and Columbus that most of the regulars aren't in it either because they are now to old or dead. In Columbus only three of the original cast star in it and in England even less star in it. Carry On Camping is in the top 3 best Carry On films and the Carry On films continue to be regally shown on British TV.

  Overall Carry On Camping is well worth a look and one of the best of the 31 Carry On films produced.",1150329600,,1474,4.361313868613139
7883377,4,6305119325,"I found the sharpness, brightness and contrast a big improvement over the VHS version it replaced.  I was disappointed in the faintness of the sound track as compared to those in the Carry On Collection.",1112227200,2,203,4.8
7883378,1,6305119325,"This is one of about 25 comedy movies made in Britain that have the same cast.  It is about half way between Monty Python and Benny Hill in the style of humor.  I consider this particular one to be in the top 5 of the 25 for entertainment value.  It involves several married and single men trying to find romance at a camping area without any success.

The problem with this DVD is the dismal technical quality.  Sharp brightness contrasts between adjacent areas produces vertical vibration of the scene. This is totally absent in the VHS version.

It is wide screen and the VHS is not.  So you have a choice in your purchases.",1110499200,7,627,4.447368421052632
