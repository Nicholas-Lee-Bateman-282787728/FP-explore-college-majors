8728840,3,B013U8EMVQ,"This is a curiosity: a one-shot vehicle for the talented Bernard Brothers (not really brothers: sharp-featured George Bernard and smiling Bert Maxwell, who looks vaguely like Bert Wheeler). Their breezy dialogue skills are reminiscent of Tommy Noonan or George O'Hanlon. Republic Pictures liked their act well enough to give them ""A"" treatment in an 84-minute feature. The idea was to cash in on Hollywood's military comedies of the 1950s, and Republic recruited Arthur T. Horman -- who wrote the storyline for Abbott & Costello's BUCK PRIVATES -- for the script. Horman's script is loaded with amusing if predictable situations, carried off with enthusiasm by the two leads and an experienced comedy cast.

Quick review of the plot (no spoilers): George and Bert play two opportunistic sailors stationed on a tropical island, constantly under the thumb of their bullying petty officer Gordon Jones. They use handsome captain Robert Hutton's photo for a moneymaking scheme, and of course it backfires royally when, back in the States, everyone who received a photo converges on Hutton! This disappoints fiancee Cathy Downs, enrages future father-in-law Emory Parnell, and arouses the interest of Russian spies Leonid Kinskey, Leon Belasco, and Florence Marly. Much of the footage takes place on a train, where George and Bert use disguises to duck their pursuers. One ridiculously funny scene has George and Bert posing as two young lovelies (ahem) to get past the blustery Parnell!

The film's best audience will be fans of two-reel comedies, who will enjoy the contributions of the supporting cast: Jean Willes as a beleaguered Navy secretary, Donald MacBride as her bossy superior officer, Minerva Urecal, Dick Elliott, Emil Sitka, and Marie Blake as discomfited train passengers, Tommy Rettig as a bratty kid, Olin Howland as a harassed train conductor, and Henry Kulky as one of the spies' confederates. Real pros like these help the action along. A director specializing in comedy might have improved the pace and the staging with his own contributions, but action director R. G. Springsteen gets the job done adequately.

Alpha Video's source print is a used 16mm original with its share of splices, but they aren't excessive and at Alpha's bargain price there's no cause for complaint. GOBS AND GALS is no classic, but this forgotten feature has some good laugh-out-loud gags and the agreeable Bernard Brothers to while away some idle time.",1469404800,,2448,5.223918575063613
