2280219,5,B0009E32UW,"This is a comprehensive overview covering the careers of the greatest Tag Team in the history of Professional Wrestling. When the Warriors burst on the scene in the early '80s there had never been anything like them. They didn't just win, they overwhelmingly destroyed their opponents to such an extent that despite their role as ""bad guys"", they were cheered by fans who believed the message on their manager Paul Ellering's shirt that said simply: ""WHO'S GONNA BEAT US?""  This DVD is the best package ever produced on this successful and feared team.",1118793600,,552,4.935483870967742

Overall, some great matches to see on DVD & an awesome look at one of the greatest tag teams in wrestling history. The Toyko Egg Dome match is quite a surprise, as Hogan actually works some & the match gets pretty brutal, with both Hogan & Hawk getting busted open. And yes, for those who like to piss & moan about uncontrollable stuff like copyrights, the old style 'WWF' logos are blurred, but that should be expected by now. Regardless, another great DVD set from the WWE.",1118707200,5,3282,5.238921001926783

2280300,4,B0009E32UW,"Not too bad of an attempt by WWE in this one.  It does a good job of covering the career of LOD, however, I do feel like there was a lot more that could have been shown/discussed in the early part of their career.  It seemed like the time in WCW, AWA, and Japan were rushed through only to get to things in WWF/E that overall were not that important.  But, for the right price, it a DVD worth adding to your collection.",1371340800,,419,4.024096385542169
2280301,4,B0009E32UW,"I enjoyed watching the documentary of the Road Warriors. It goes into detail of how they got started. I always like getting the backstory on wrestlers & how they got to the point they are.

The matches left more to be desired though. While there were some great matches on the disc, you'd think being one of the world's most dominant tag teams, that they would have included more matches. They totally missed the fueds they had in the WWF with the Beverly Brothers & The Nasty Boys. While they talked about it in the documentary, they left out any matches that involved Droz. I would have also wanted to see the fake suicide of Hawk. This isn't a bad buy, but they should have added a third disc with more matches or special features. Some promos would have been a nice addition.",1366848000,,779,4.4475524475524475
2280302,5,B0009E32UW,"If you were a fan of the LOD, this was a great CD. These wrestlers revolunized the Tag Team division no matter what organization they were in. I believe they were the greatest tag team there ever was.",1364083200,,200,4.2894736842105265
2280303,5,B0009E32UW,"This is a wonderful collection of the history of the Road Warriors.  There is so much information that the average fan doesn't know just from watching them in the WWE.  This was great first-hand accounts from Animal about his relationship with his partner, how they met, where they worked out, their rise and ultimate fall from glory.  EXCELLENT!!!

2280311,5,B0009E32UW,"The history behind this dynamic tag team is really cool, especially for those of us who are fans of this legendary tag team. They use a lot of good footage and talk to many of the wrestlers who battled these guys years ago. Most of the matches on the DVD are from their early days and it's almost comical to see the differences in physique between them and their early opponents. A definite plus for any wrestling fan's collection, especially at the price it was offered at.",1359331200,,474,4.459770114942529

2280316,5,B0009E32UW,"This documentary was great. Great showing of The Road Warriors in the AWA, NWA, WCW, and the WWF(now WWE). Also includes story of how Road Warriors broke into the business. Great extra features shown on both discs. Really wish ""Iron Man"" by Black Sabbath was included but knowing the cost of today's music license fees. I cannot blame WWE for putting in-house music for their matches that were not in WWE. Ohh, what a rush!!! For those wrestling fans that do not know the Original Legion of Doom consisted of The Road Warriors, ""Precious"" Paul Ellering, Jake 'the Snake' Roberts, The Spoiler, King Kong Bundy, Arn Anderson, The Iron Sheik, the Original Sheik(Sabu's uncle), and Matt Borne(Evil Doink).

2280320,4,B0009E32UW,"Recently got this 2 disc set. I gotta say I thought that it would have more matches than it does. It does have a fair amount of matches though (considering it's a 2 disc set). And despite the hopes of having more matches, I still am happy with this purchase! I grew up with WWF & WCW in the 80's & 90's. Schooling my son on the old school days of the ring. And he also enjoyed this too! I recommend getting this to add or start a wrestling DVD collection. And especially for a few bucks on Amazon. I only paid like 1.25 + shipping.",1331683200,,531,4.018867924528302
2280350,5,B0009E32UW,"I've been a die-hard fan of The Road Warriors since I used to watch them on Saturday mornings in the AWA. In my opinion, there has never been another tag team who can compare with these two. This collection is great because it takes you from their true beginnings ( biker gimmicks, with no face paint!), to their rise (AWA,NWA,WWF tag champs),their WTF?! moments ( ""Rocco""/!! REALLY??!!, & Hawk's battles with ""his personal demons"") to their end (the passing of HAWK). I remember, as a child, I used to get a little scared of them when they would rush into the ring & attack their opponents (or victims!) before the bell even rang. No other wrestler(s) had that instant fear factor, that ""IT"" factor... as did the Warriors. Watching those old matches on this collection really brought back great memories of how good wrestling USED to be!! I highly recommend this set. If you appreciate wrestling for what it is (athletic 'entertainment') then you can definitely get into this collection. The L.O.D. will live forever.",1327190400,2,1018,4.822857142857143

2280353,4,B0009E32UW,"I bought this 2-disc DVD set after reading the wonderful Road Warriors book by Joe 'Animal' Laurinaitis. Although not intended as a connected release, that is how they come across. Read the book, see the movie!

Disc One: The documentary on the first disc is surprisingly thoughtful and well-edited. I am subtracting one star for the absolutely terrible generic heavy metal played continuously through every interview. It sounds like a rejected score from the old Smackdown Two PS1 game. Thankfully they change the music when it comes time to relate Hawk's tragic early death.

Do not pass up the Extras on disc one, some hilarious promos from the Road Warriors. But more importantly, and this is worth the purchase of the DVDS: Brief 1-minute commentaries from Michael 'P.S.' Hayes and Paul Ellering about life, and striving for goals. These guys look into the camera and tell the viewers (and aspiring wrestlers) to get up in the morning and reach for goals. And if you're not getting up in the morning with something to get up for, then FIND SOMETHING! And get up. Surprising, but effective advice. (Also great 2005 commentary from Jim Ross and Animal on an early match against two legends in Las Vegas.)

Disc Two: One of the highlights of Animal's book (and a great recommend there) is his recall of the time the Road Warriors finally got to wrestle Hulk Hogan in Japan. Here, we see the actual 1991 Japanese match, to a sell-out Japanese crowd. Hulk Hogan and the Road Warriors are in their prime, and it shows. Hogan is almost a heel for this match, since it wouldn't be aired in America. Great stuff to watch, as hardcore as anything the later 'Attitude Era' could come up with. Hogan gets his own face paint shortly into the match, his own blood! Hawk gets busted open, too. The new alternate commentaries by Jim Ross and Animal for several of these matches is a true highlight, you've gotta hear them call these matches!

After I bought this, I put off watching it for a few weeks. I thought I knew the Road Warriors. When I finally sat down to watch it, I was blown away. One of the best DVD releases from the WWE that I can think of. Buy it!",1310947200,5,2153,4.598958333333333
2280354,4,B0009E32UW,"Over all, I did enjoy the Road Warriors DVD.  It's a two disk set with interview\commentary of Animal.  On Disk one you learn a lot about the home life, upbringing, and behind the scenes of the Road Warriors.  Mostly positive and some negative.  The clips chosen and the commentary are a little dated and seem to be more scripted then I like, which, I found boring at times.  However, disk two more than makes up for lack of interest on the first one.  The full matches played in their entirety takes me back to my youth and reminds me why I liked the LOD in the first place.  I recommend this DVD to all LOD fans.  You will not be disappointed.",1298246400,,645,4.2727272727272725

2280380,5,B0009E32UW,"I could care less about wrestling now, but in the 1980's & early 90's professional wrestling was a lot of fun with many memorable characters and matches. At the top of the tag team food chain were the seemingly unbeatable Road Warriors. With their painted faces, street fighting tactics and spiked shoulder pads, the Legion Of Doom were a sight to behold. The fact that they revolutionized pro wrestling is redundant now but delve into this extraordinary trip through time to find out how they did it. I just finished watching this excellent 2 disc set on the legendary Road Warriors, Animal & Hawk and i have to say it is essential viewing for wrestling fans of the 80's & early 90's. The disc 1 documentary gives us a real, behind the scenes look at this awesome team. It chronicles the training, formation of and subsequent explosion of the Road Warriors onto the wrestling scene in 1983, forever changing the world of professional wrestling. They would eventually storm their way to all 3 major tag team titles (NWA, AWA & WWF), and have many memorable feuds with the likes of The Fabulous Freebirds, Midnight Express, The Koloffs, Four Horseman & Demolition. The falling out of the Road Warriors while at the very top of their profession was surprising to learn and will pique the interest of anybody who deemed this duo inseparable. Their subsequent reformation and return to action 4 years later was triumphant but too soon touched by tragedy with the sudden passing of Hawk. The disc 1 documentary is a thoroughly absorbing overview of The Road Warriors/ Legion Of Doom. The remainder of disc 1 and all of disc 2 contains many of their most memorable matches including the bloody Superclash AWA tag team title match vs. The Fabulous Freebirds, the Koloff Russian Chain Match at The Great American Bash 86, The famous Skywalkers scaffold match vs. The Midnight Express at Starrcade 86 and the bulldozing of The Nasty Boys at Summerslam 91 to capture the WWF gold. Some important matches are overlooked, such as the Ultimate Warrior team up against the 3 members of Demolition (instead we get a quickie count out match with the inferior version of Demolition, Smash and Crush) and the subject of why the Road Warriors never battled the original, superior version of Demolition, Ax & Smash, in a dream match is never discussed. Also missing is the infamous blinding of Dusty Rhoads with Animal's shoulder spike but that's about it. The WWE did a fantastic job with this dvd release and i highly recommend it for fans of the golden age of wrestling, a fitting tribute to the most dominating tag team of all time.",1188777600,,2616,4.777041942604857
2280381,5,B0009E32UW,Great DVD for any true Road Warriors fan. I remember watching some of the matches on the DVD as a kid. I thought I'd never get to see those again. The nostalgia and background info on the Warriors makes this a must have.,1176940800,,220,4.1395348837209305
2280382,5,B0009E32UW,"The Legion Of Doom are one of the greatest tag teams of all time. In a time where promotions were based around single wrestlers, they became the attraction people wanted & payed to see. Roadwarrior Hawk, Roadwarrior Animal, and manager Precious Paul Ellering...the Road Warriors.

The documentry starts with stories of Hawk & Animal growing up & working out at the gym which lead to them being trained as wrestlers. The evolution of their look & characters are discussed along with their relationship with manager Paul Ellering. Their stints in both Georgia Championship Wrestling and the AWA including fueds with famous teams like The Crusher & Baron Von Raschke, Fabolous Freebirds, Midnight Express, Four Horsemen, and the Koloffs are looked at in detail along with funny stories about Dick The Brusier & The Crusher and the Fabolous Ones. Their first run in the WWE goes over the fued with Demolition and if they were Road Warrior imitatiors & their historic SummerSlam '91 match. But just like everything in life, all good things must come to an end and that's where this documentry starts to go downhill as Hawk's problems & actions outside the ring led to the breakup of the Road Warriors, a brief discussion of the Japanese version of the Road Warriors, and their return to WCW that didn't work out well. Returning to WWE as L.O.D. 2000, the entire storyline involving Droz, and the death of Roadwarrior Hawk round out this documentry.

Matches Include:
vs. Joe Young & Randy Barber - This was during their early days before the facepaint look with them looking like a couple of bikers.  As you would expect, they completely squashed the other team.
""NWA Georgia Championship Wrestling"" June '83

vs. Arn Anderson & Paul Jones - This was back in the days of a young Arn Anderson as the Warriors completely destroyed this team as well.
""NWA Georgia Championship Wrestling"" Aug. '83

Texas Tornado Match vs. Brisco Brothers - The Warriors used their usual ""power/street fight"" offense in the beginning but Gerald & Jack were able to fight back & gain an advantage with outwrestling the Warriors with moves like the figure four.  The Warriors throughout the match worked on their backs with various bearhugs & backbreakers before things just got completely out of hand with chairs getting involved.  A different match than expected from the Biscos Brothers but a very good match.
NWA, Aug. '83

vs. Mike Jackson & Stone - Just the Warriors eating up another team before spitting them out.
""NWA Georgia Championship Wrestling"" June '83

vs. AWA Tag Team Champions Baron Von Raschke & The Crusher - This match saw Baron & Crusher used a strategy that worked in their favor by using the Warrior's strength against them while also out-wrestling them.  Hawk & Animal stuck to their usual brawling/ground & pound offense but also showed smart tactics in cutting the ""ring in half"" and keeping the other guy in close to their corner before going on to win their their first World Tag Team Championship.
""AWA All Star Wrestling"" Aug. '84

AWA Tag Team Championship Match vs. Larry & Curt Hennig - This was another match that saw Hawk & Animal work a ""smart"" match in that Larry Hennig matched power with the Warriors so the focused & worked heavily over the younger, less experienced & less powerful Curt.
""AWA All Star Wrestling"" Apr. '85

AWA Tag Team Championship Match vs. Fabulous Freebirds - It should be noted that this combination of the Freebirds was Michael Hayes & Terry Gordy with Buddy Roberts in the corner while the 'Birds decided to paint their own faces, like the Warriors, with the image of the rebel flag.  This was just a very entertaining match as Hayes had just natural heat here as they didn't even lock up yet & the crowd was all over him while Gordy was a great bumper for his size.  The ending was something out of the ""Dusty Rhodes"" playbook but it didn't take away from this good match.
AWA SuperClash '85

vs. Magnum T.A. & Ronnie Garvin - This was the finals of the two day tag team tournament with a rare match with everyone being babyfaces while it should be noted that Ronnie Garvin had his hand taped due to an injury suffered by the Horsemen.  Good back & forth encounter here before Ronnie Garvin's ""hands of stone"" came back to backfired him.
NWA Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup '86

Chain Match vs. Ivan & Nikita Koloff - As you would just expect from these two teams, this was just a brawl from start to finish with the chains heavily coming into play to either whip, choke, or have leverage over your opposition here.
NWA Great American Bash '86

Scaffold Match vs. Midnight Express - The first major scaffold match in wrestling history. The match itself wasn't good by normal standards since they were very limited on what they could do but for the time, it was really a sight to see both teams being so high up, knowing how one team was going to fall all the way down, and the way they used the scaffold during the match. Watch out for the ending with Bobby Eaton & what happened to Jim Cornette afterwards.
NWA Starrcade '86
(""Starrcade: The Essential Collection"")

vs. NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard - In their hometown of Chicago, the Warriors were after the Tag Team titles. This a clash of power in the Warriors vs. the wrestling technicians of the Horsemen with great storytelling by both teams.
NWA Starrcade '87
(""Starrcade: The Essential Collection"")

vs. NWA Tag Team Champions Midnight Express - This was during the process of an attempt to turn Hawk & Animal heel after they had already beaten down & taken out the eye of Dusty Rhodes.  The Warriors divided & conquered as they had completely beaten down Bobby Eaton on the outside forcing Stan Lane to fight alone for a majority of the match before the odds just caught up to the Express leaving the Warriors to win their first (and only) NWA Tag Team Championship.
""NWA Main Event"" Oct. '88

vs. Demolition - It should be noted that Ax was long gone from the company so this is the Smash & Crush duo with Mr. Fuji returning as the team's manager.  This was pretty short & sweet here as this was the blowoff of the feud for the past few months between Demolition & the Legion Of Doom.
""Wrestling Challenge"" Feb. '91

vs. Hart Foundation - This was one of the last matches with the Hart Foundation together as a team before Bret broke off into his singles run.  L.O.D. were on the defense for most of the match as Hawn was heavily worked over by the Foundation before being able to somehow pull off a win here in a match that had both teams gain respect for each other afterwards.
WrestleFest '91

vs. Hulk Hogan & Genichiro Tenryu - This match happened during the period where WWE was having a working relationship with the SWS promotion in Japan to use each other's talent & aid in WWE's global expansion into Japan (hense why Tenryu & Koji Kitao wrestled at WrestleMania VII that month) & for those who have never seen Hulk Hogan wrestle in the Japanese setting, your in for a treat as he puts in more wrestling than you normally would see from him in the United States.  The Warriors used their power game here early even press slamming Hogan & Tenru early on.  Both teams brawled on the floor & through the crowd resulting on both Hogan & Hawk heavily bleeding while using chairs & tables on each other.  This match was very physical (maybe even stiff at times) that just got out of control between both teams but still a lost gem in the careers of not only Hawk & Animal but also Hogan during his period of his career.
Mar. '91

Street Fight Match vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Nasty Boys - Another match that was short & sweet and enjoyable. It wasn't a weapons spotfest but a big brawl that was very well planned out & giving us a historcal finish with the L.O.D./Road Warriors becoming the first & only team to hold all the championship of all the major fedeations at that time.
SummerSlam '91

vs. Money Inc. - Eventhough they weren't the champions, these were the two best tag teams WWE had at that time. This was a good solid match all around with Money Inc. being the great mat wrestlers but still cheating heels meshing well with L.O.D.'s powerhouse style...but pay attention to L.O.D.'s entrance, it was quite a sight.
SummerSlam '92
(""Allied Powers: World's Greatest Tag Teams)

vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Sting & Lex Luger - This was a very slow but physical match between these two & was very similar like the previous one in that there was tension between Luger & Sting but also the story was made clear that the Road Warriors had respect for Sting & wanted their hands on Luger. Overall, good match.
WCW SuperBrawl VI '96

vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Godwinns - The Legion of Doom had a long feud with the Godwinns beginning with Henry suffering a neck injury due to the Doomsday Device months earlier & this encounter was the L.O.D. putting their careers on the line for one last title shot so it was ""win the titles or go home"" situation.  They went back & forth in this match with Animal getting hurt at one point while the Godwinns tried to take advantage of the ""titles don't change hands on disqualification"" rule before the L.O.D. made the emotional comeback & victory for their last set of tag team championships.
""RAW"" Oct. '97

DVD extras include various promos, 3 Confidental pieces, additional comments from Michael Hayes & Paul Ellering, and the old school Road Warriors music video.  Bottom line is that if you are a fan of tag team wrestling & classic ""old school"" footage then this DVD is a necessity.",1152489600,2,9555,4.623154164205553
2280383,5,B0009E32UW,"This DVD is another example of how the WWF (not WWE!) is bring back classic wrestling to long time fans.  This DVD chronicals the history of the Road Warriors from their beginnings to end.  It is great to see the real inside information on the team straight from Animal, Paul Ellering and others close to them.  A great DVD!  The only thing I would have like to see more of is the TBS interviews and the time they jumped Dusty Rhoades and put the spike in his eye.",1145836800,,464,4.238636363636363
2280384,4,B0009E32UW,"I don't think I find any matches against the Steiner Brothers. I also hope to get some of their early matches in the AWA. Some of the early matches included on this volume are not that ""extraordinary."" There are no matches against Sgt Slaughter, Crusher Blackwell, Greg Gagne, Jim Brunzell, Steiner Brothers, Samoan Swat Team, Fantastics, Rick Rude & Manny Fernandez, Tower of Doom matches, etc. The match where they teamed with Sting and turned against him after the match would be essential. More matches from their numerous Japan tours would be great. I want to watch the match where they won the NWA International tag team championship in Japan and brought the belts back to the US. I had watched a few matches where a Power Warrior substituted for Animal and wrestled along side Hawk against the Steiners. There were also matches where Animal and Hawk wrestled against The Great Muta and Rick Steiner. I remember reading Japanese wrestling magazines showing the Road Warriors went fishing with the New Japan Pro Wrestling stars Muta, Chono, etc. with the Steiners. There was also a match where the RW teamed up with Hulk Hogan against Sting, Dr Death Steve Williams and Terry Gordy. Back in the US, there was a singles match where Ric Flair supposedly use a spike from Animal's shoulder pad on Animal's eye. I also want to see how the Powers of Pain hurt Animal's eye in a weight-lifting showdown(?) that resulted in surgery. There was a cage match where they were wrestling against the Samoan Swat Team (I think), and suddenly the Fabulous Freebirds (Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin) stormed in and put handcuff on Animal and threw Hawk into the cage bursting him open. If my memory was right, that led to an unlikely match later: RW + Midnight Express vs. SST + Freebirds. There was also a match against Dr Death Steve Williams and Mike Rotundo (or Terry Gordy) where Nikita Koloff was the guest referee. In a NWA studio taping, Ric Flair was wrestling in the ring, Hawk interfered and attacked Flair. When Animal tried to enter the ring, Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson hit him from behind. Then they piledrived him on the concrete floor outside the ring. After that, they ganged up on Hawk and both were left unconscious. I really missed those 80's matches where the Road Warriors slided into the ring and just kept pounding and throwing their opponents around. These were not in this volume. I would also like to see Sunny. Hopefully they will be included in an upcoming Road Warriors DVD.",1140048000,3,2499,4.76036866359447
2280385,5,B0009E32UW,"Wow, what a DVD!  This DVD is truly worth the price and great to add to your WWE collection.  To get the commentaries from Animal and Paul Ellering really gives the Road Warrior story a more complete picture of what they've been through. The only thing I wish that they've added to this DVD is the matches with the Ultimate Warrior against all three Demolition members from the Survivor Series (I forgot which year, I think it's '90). The biggest surprise was the fact that Hawk really abused drugs and alcohol and he did it with Jake The Snake Roberts.  It's an unfortunate tragedy.  RIP Hawk as most of us old school Road Warrior fans truly miss you but the LOD and their legacy will continue to live on.",1139788800,,706,4.449612403100775

2280387,5,B0009E32UW,"This DVD set is a combination of a tribute and a documentary of sorts.  It features some of the more memorable matches in the Legion of Doom's career as a tag team and it also puts a spotlight on the tumultuous life of the late, great Hawk.

I was afraid the latter would be a tacky show on exploitation on Vince McMahon's part, as he's had an up and down relationship with both Road Warriors.  However, the look back at Hawk's rocky life is done in a classy way with insight on his life, commentary by Animal and none of the ""shock value"" stuff that the WWE used in their more recent Ultimate Warrior DVD.

It's the matches that make the DVD set, though.  There are so many great selections from the LOD's time in Georgia Championship Wrestling, the AWA, the NWA/WCW and, of course, the WWE.  Some of these matches even include commentary by Animal himself.  A really cool feature, in my opinion.

If you're a lifelong wrestling fan, such as myself, you're bound to enjoy this selection.  One of the better ""legend"" compilation DVD sets out there right now.  Even better than The History of The Undertaker, as far as I'm concerned.",1130198400,13,1132,4.504901960784314

The only reason I writing this is the comment made by the dork who thought the dvd was long and boring, and that the LOD was dumb. And they thought they should have did the dvd on someone more recent. Well someone should kick the snot out of that jerk the way the warriors used ta destroy opponents back in the day. I've been a wrestling fan since 1981. Flair in the NWA stylin' and profilin'. Hogan from Thunderlips to WWF. Piper's Pit with Snuka, the coconut and the banana. It was great up until red neck rattlesnake Austin. Then as good as the athletes were just got to stupid and boring. Certain guys wouldn't lose to certain wrestlers cause they were cry babies. The way Bret Hart got screwed. The whole thing with Vince buying WCW,ECW and everthing else just about. And the chicks made it pornographic at times but the bimbos would pose nude for Heffner. I still wanna see Medusa naked.  Anyway I hope to see more old WWF stuff from the 80's and early 90's.

When you heard it, it was on, because LOD was ready to go to work, (EXCUSE ME, WAR) !!!  The scaffold match @ STARCADE '86, makes this worth the purchase. To see the fear in Dennis's face, when he saw Hawk and Animal at the other end of the scaffold , and everyone is 30 feet above the mat, and LOD HAD NO FEAR, would make anyone think twice about what was to transpire !!!

I was very pleased to see Michael Hayes also who can be a great talker himself when he is talking about ""the good old days."" I only wish there were some more matches from their latter days in WWE, and at the moment I can't remember if their last match with RVD/Kane was included either way this is a great buy for any wrestling fan of the late 80's early 90's and a must have for fans of the lost art of tag team wrestling.",1123027200,,671,4.25

One of the great pleasure here is seeing the old time legends like THE BRISCO brothers,BARON RASCHKEE,THE CRUSHER and THE KOLOFFS near the end of their careers. The two hour biography is on the mark,and the HAWK tribute is touching. Nobody body slams  their opponents like THE ROAD WARRIORS.Overpowering when they started,they gradually had good rivaleries with many wrestlers. Sounds like CHRIS MASTERS doesn't it?I guess everyone will agree that THE ROAD WARRIORS deserved such a tribute.

The documentary is practically worth the price alone.  Then throw in over 15 matches, interviews, etc and this is a collection that any Road Warriors fan can't pass up.

If WWE Producers read this, my wish list:

New Hulk Hogan DVD (at least another 2 disk)

New Ric Flair DVD (this one should include an in-depth documentary like Hogan, Warriors, DVD that is not found on his 3-disk ultimate edition; also has enough classic matches to make many dvd collections from)

Ultimate Warrior DVD

Four Horsemen DVD (has to be 75% 1986-89 w/ RF, TA, AA)

Randy Savage DVD

Best of NWA - Starrcade, Great American Bash

Best of Wrestlemania DVD

History of the NWA Championship

Best of Saturday's (& Friday's) Night Main Event

Maybe a best-of year by year (ie Best of WWE/NWA 1986, 1996, etc) that would highlight the major feuds, matches, etc. from that year",1122681600,,1052,4.714285714285714
2280420,5,B0009E32UW,There is some really good footage on here including lots of full matches that are very good.  The story is on disc one and is excellent.  Disc two is just full of matches. The only complaint I have is that WWE should have put more of the Road Warriors' classic matches from there early days if they had the footage.  I know of one match that is missing from a PPV which included a triple tierd cage match which was a pretty good match.  Also I know the Road warriors had fought Dusty Rhodes and there was just a brief mention of that.

I can saw that it was that moment, sitting downstairs in front of the television that I became a true wrestling fan. The DVD is a two disk set. The first disk is an entire 2 hours of listening to Animal tell the history of the team and if you actually want to see some of the early matches, skip into the extras, because that is the only place you will see them along with some of the Warriors promos. I found some of the other extras to be very weak and uninteresting. Who really wants to sit through Micheal Hayes, with a very bad goatee, I think he was trying to look french, I don't know. Anyways, did I really need to hear him telling me that if I wished to be a tag team wrestler, to watch the dvd that I just watched? That cost this disk one star. Otherwise, I liked the disk.

2280424,4,B0009E32UW,"My favorite tag team in the history of professional wrestling is The Road Warriors.  Is this an excellent DVD presentation on them? No but it's definitely good.

The background information provided by Animal, Paul Ellering, Barry Darsow and others was priceless.  Disc 1 features the making of the Road Warriors and their growing up tales.  It was good to see the place where they trained and also the spots where they served as bouncers.  It was also interesting hearing other professional wrestlers giving their account of The Road Warriors and what the team did for professional wrestling.

DVD 2 features some classic matches from The Road Warriors during their tenure in AWA, NWA, WWF/E and WCW.  Unforunately, as a big fan of Black Sabbath's Iron Man intro music, I was somewhat miffed that I did not get to hear the original theme music.  Whenever The Road Warriors matches were featured in AWA, NWA or WCW, the footage begins with The Legion of Doom in the ring.  So mark fans of the Iron man music will be somewhat disappointed.  Matches from their WWF/E days feature the Oooooooooooooooh What A Rush theme music and entrances.  It's on account of the missing Iron Man music I gave this DVD 4 stars.  As Hawk would say, ""You don't like it, we don't care.""

All in all, this DVD is a must have for fans of The Road Warriors, The Legion Of Doom.",1119398400,6,1352,4.630252100840337

IF VINCE WANTED TO DO THAT TO A TAG TEAM, DO IT TO ONE THAT DOESN'T MATTER, LIKE THE DUDLEYS. THIS DVD DOES INCLUDE SOME GREAT MATCHES AND SOME GREAT INSIGHT INTO THE TEAM BY ANIMAL.

2280426,5,B0009E32UW,"Not that there's ever been any doubt, but this collection cements the fact that the Road Warriors/Legion of Doom changed the face of tag team wrestling forever and proved themselves worthy of the accoladed heaped upon them.  The main feature has Joe ""Animal"" Laurinaitis discussing the Warriors entire existence from their first meeting in Chicago to their move to Minneapolis to their early days in Georgia right up until Hawk's tragic death in 2003.  There are plenty of other wrestlers, managers, friends and colleagues adding comments and memories about the duo throughout including my personal favorite moment where Barry Darsow aka Demolition Smash claims Demolition wasn't a ripoff of the LOD.  Good candid stuff much like the ECW dvd and much like that set, the feature ends on a down note.  It's sad that the Road Warriors went out with a whimper rather than a roar, but this set does a good job of closing their chapter of professional wrestling history properly.",1118966400,10,973,4.987654320987654
2280427,4,B0009E32UW,"Let me first say, this is done well and belongs at the top of the WWE DVDs with Ric Flair and probably Triple H's DVDs.  It has superb background of the Road Warriors and the LOD concept with Animal.

  I have video of the Road Warriors battling the Powers of Pain and a large number of interviews.

My gripe is probably the same as my gripe with other WWF/WWE DVD's: this DVD focuses on the subject (Road Warriors) while they were in the WWE/WWF.  They did have small part in Southwest Championship wrestling owned by Tully Blanchard's father in San Antonio, TX.  Personally, I think the Road Warriors made their name in the NWA in Atlanta, GA.  If anyone remembers, their entrance music before WWF/WWE was ""Iron Man"" by Black Sabbath which of course went great with the personalities they were portraying.  Edge is on the DVD saying he remembers ""What a Rush....."" entrance.  Jim Ross puts more of a WWE spin to it.

To Jim Ross: this DVD has an interview or two conducted by the greatest wrestling announcer: Gorden Solie.",1118880000,3,1025,4.576923076923077
2280428,5,B0009E32UW,"WWE can put out dvds that blow people away and then they can put one out that is good, but lacks in places. This dvd has a 100 minute, well crafted biography on the Road Warriors. The matches were surprising like the Japan match facing Hogan and Tenryu, plus the Hart Foundation was an excellent choice. The matches I would have liked to see would be there first WWE match, and matches against Meng and Barbarian, Natural Disasters, and the Steiner Brothers. They show clips of these matches or talk in promos about them, and they could have been on the dvd instead of a couple short, pointless matches. I want to thank you whoever put this dvd together, they should get a raise and be put in charge of future WWE releases.

One funny note, the WWE loves to blur out the old WWF logos just from the years 98 to when it changed to WWE. In one promo on this dvd, they go as far as bleeping Animal after he said WW, no f. The pre attitude era of WWE (80-98) lets the WWF symbols show but after 98, they are hell bent on bluring out ever logo on people's shirt (from security to the audience), the titan tron, and the ring turnbuckles. Why do they do that? Its funny but annoying.",1118880000,,1176,4.25
