3916172,5,B002EAKWEI,"I just love Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes character.  They had all the episodes on Netflix for some time then as Netflix does with painful regularity they pulled it (probably their license for the series expired but nonetheless it is a shock to see something you enjoy disappearing in 7 days - but I digress).

Only through the first season I was hooked and decided to just buy the entire series since I'm sure I'll watch it multiple times through the years. I bought this UK version since it is half the cost of the US version and is exactly the same series.

The ""secret"" to buying (and PLAYING) Region 2 dvd's is to simply have a multi-region DVD player.  You can buy one specifically OR do what I do, which is to have a second optical drive in your computer and assign it to play Region 2.  Windows lets you change the setting up to 5 times but for the cost of a second optical drive (I bought the generic/bulk Lite-On drive right here on Amazon for $20) I just added the drive and permanently assigned it Region 2.  I have an HDMI cable running from the computer to my TV and voila! - perfect picture and sound.  I buy Region 2 dvd's whenever I can and have paid for the drive many times over plus saved a lot of money in general.  As I said Region 2 is exactly the same quality and technology - why get ripped off by being forced against your will into Region 1?

These discs play perfectly and the quality is as good as it was when I was streaming it from Netflix.  This is one of the most entertaining series I have come across and I am thrilled to have made the purchase at less than $1 per episode and I can have it for the rest of my life.  I'm 100% completely satisfied.",1379116800,5,1683,4.211838006230529

3916175,5,B002EAKWEI,"Jeremy Brett (1933-95) is rightfully regarded as one of the best, if not at the top of the list, of the many actors who have played Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic detective Sherlock Holmes, in movies or on television.  Between 1984 and 1994, Brett played Holmes in 41 adaptations of Doyle's original stories produced by Granada Television.

Jeremy Brett fully immersed himself into the role of Holmes, and in the minds of many, brought the character to life, and made the role his own, becoming the quintessential Sherlock Holmes for the 1980's.  Particularly in the early adventures, Brett brings great energy, emotion, and a real sense of edginess to the character.  Brett was diagnosed as a manic depressive in 1986, and put on lithium.  The medication was a contributing factor in his noticeable weight gain in his later years.  And while Brett is still brilliant, at times he seems to lack some of the fire he had previously.

Holmes' friend and companion doctor John Watson was played by David Burke, who was later replaced by Edward Hardwicke.  Rosalie Williams ably plays Mrs. Hudson, Holmes' housekeeper at 221B Baker Street, and Colin Jeavons appears as Inspector Lestrade from Scotland Yard.  The Granada dramatizations breathe life into Conan Doyle's stories, capturing a sense of the time period, and the prevailing social conventions.  Guest stars are often featured in significant roles, and the performances by these talented actors is usually excellent, rarely failing to meet the high standards set by Granada, and by the nature of what is generally regarded as classic material.

Fans of Sherlock Holmes may have issues with some of the adaptations, which were developed for television by John Hawkesworth.  The episodes do not follow the same chronology as Conan Doyle's literary works, so there is a bit of a disconnect with the timeline.  Also John Watson's marriage, which happened quite early on, does not occur until much later.  Although the timing may not be perfect, the Holmes/Watson dynamic is familiar and well-established, and works with either Burke (13 episodes) or Hardwicke (28 episodes) in the role.  Although each actor has points in their favor, which makes the ""better"" Watson is a matter of individual taste.

The Region 2 collection released by itv Studios in 2005 has an outer cardboard box that houses two large plastic cases, which each contain 8 DVD's.  The 16 disc set, includes The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1984-85, 13 episodes), The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes (1986-88, 13 episodes), The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1991-93, 9 episodes), and The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1994, 6 episodes).  Image quality varies, and is sometimes a bit grainy, which was fairly typical for 80's television, but the colors are generally true, and nicely saturated.  The episodes are subtitled in English only.

I purchased this Region 2 set at Amazon UK for about 20 including shipping, which at the time translated to about $33, which is well below the price at Amazon USA.  The entire series is also available in a Region 1 release by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MPI/dp/B000RPCJB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MPI</a>, which includes the same content, except on just 12 discs.  Currently priced at about $158, the MPI release also has some bonus content which is not included on the Region 2 release.  As I have a region free player, I was fine with buying the Region 2 set, passing up on the extras, and saving $125.  While the price has since gone up at Amazon UK, the Region 2 set remains a relative bargain, for those able to view Region 2 DVD's, and prefer to save some cash buying a no frills release.",1356739200,8,3695,5.10981697171381
3916176,5,B002EAKWEI,"Great dvd to have, you will not be disappointed. If your a fan of Sherlock Holmes you will love this dvd box set.",1335398400,2,113,3.9565217391304346
3916177,5,B002EAKWEI,"Between 1984 and 1994, ITV screened a series of 41 adaptations of Conan-Doyle's masterwork. The series was adapted for telly by John Hawkesworth and directed by a variety of Granada worthies and is considered by many to be the best adaptation (film or TV) aired so far. Let's be clear, there are some very considerable liberties taken with ACD's original storylines but the overall Holmesian ""feel"" of the series is so strong that these liberties are barely noticeable. This is no revisionist adaptation, it isn't ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/updated/dp/B003TO5414/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">updated</a>"", ""improved"" or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/dumbed-down/dp/B003YCOIG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">dumbed-down</a>: like a stick of seaside rock, it has Conan Doyle written all the way through.

Nevertheless, it did rather slip under my radar; while I'm no Holmes maniac, I do love the stories but to watch such a long running series required more persistence, enthusiasm and, yes, VCR capacity, than I could ever muster. So, to find the lot packaged so neatly (sixteen discs!) is a true godsend. I shan't be watching much else for some months to come, I suspect.

Just as the adaptation is applauded for its faithfulness, so is Jeremy Brett considered to be the best Holmes ever presented and he plays the part with huge authority. The stories have, of course, a strong ""Boys Own"" flavour to them and Brett clearly understood that a degree of overacting was required to set the tone. His ham is finely sliced and, like the best Parma ham, he melts in the mouth. Ascetic, ascerbic, ironic and sarcastic, his mercurial performance is literally a joy to watch and I defy anyone to watch the series and then read a Holmes story without visualising Holmes as Brett. David Burke and (later) Edward Hardwicke do Watson to a tee; always a step behind (literally and mentally) his good friend Holmes (although for my money, I think Hardwicke does it best). Let's not forget Rosalie Williams' doughty Mrs. Hudson - always there to remove a sopping cloak and bowler and deliver a hearty breakfast (curried fowl and some piping hot coffee) after a night's adventuring. The cast includes a number of regulars - Colin Jeavons is seminal as the terrier-like Lestrade, and Charles Gray stately as Holmes' brother Mycroft. Some considerable fun can be extracted by spotting familiar faces in the line up of minor characters and I was delighted to see Tom Watt (Eastenders' Lofty Holloway) in the opening episode. Of course, plenty of bigger names pass by (Robert Hardy, John Thaw, Joss Ackland and the like) and I suspect that an appearance in the series was a not inconsiderable feather in the cap of even the most successful thesp. Admittedly, the acting can be variable in places (even Burke is a little stiff and scripty at times) but that only adds to the charm.

Production quality is... well, it's a typical 1980's ITV costume drama. The extras are sparser on the ground than they should be - they're well kitted out but their costumes are a little too fresh and their performances a tad too derivative to be utterly convincing, but hey! you can't have everything. The series made excellent use of locations (outside the full scale Baker Street set and no. 221b interior) and larger props - one can almost smell the oily, smoky stink of the steam-engine as Holmes and Watson rush to the countryside to solve yet another rural murder or abduction mystery.

The only down-side is that the series never succeeded in its aim of adapting all sixty of Conan-Doyle's stories - Brett died of a heart attack before Hawkesworth's vision could be realised. 41 out of 60 will just have to do.

A little while ago I spent nearly fifty notes on the new Star Wars boxset, thinking that I'd invested in a huge, epic sci-fi cycle of unsurpassed quality. I had only ever seen SW4:ANH before making the purchase, so imagine my chagrin when I discovered that George Lucas really DOES have feet of clay.

Alternatively, you can own this: half the cost, three times as big, ten tmes more intelligent and infinitely better entertainment value. I love the series and, if I don't write too many more film reviews over the next few months it's because I am wallowing in a glorious and endless Holmes-fest.

3916178,5,B002EAKWEI,"I don't think anyone considering a purchase of this set needs a review of the series material. It is the definitive Holmes.

If you have the ability to play Region 2 DVDs on a universal DVD player or with a software solution on computer, buying this is a no-brainer. It is much less expensive to get than the USA Region 1 version, and the image quality and subtitles (which were subject to  major screw-ups on the first USA release) are excellent. I had previously seen the series on murky videotapes. Then I checked out the USA DVD release from the library and found the image quality was not much better than the videotapes. There is now a ""remastered"" USA/Region 1 set, but as I said, much more expensive.

I was impressed with the image quality of this Region 2 set, actually. Good sharpness, color, and contrast. Given the source film, this is probably about the best you will see for DVD home video from a 16mm film source.",1306454400,12,929,4.517857142857143

--A note on playing Region 2 DVD's--
These are Region 2 DVD's so unless you know how to play them, then this package is not for you. On many of the DVD Players, you can do a Region Unlock Search, and find a password which enables Region 0, which means all regions enabled including Region 2. Some of the DVD Players being sold are already unlocked. You might have one in your living room and not know it. They can also be played on your computer, or converted on your computer, which is perfectly legal for personal use, but not worth the trouble in my opinion. I would rather pay a little more and
not have to deal with all those hassles. They sell Region 0 DVD Players on Amazon, that can be used for this purpose, such as this one. ---&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philips-Multi-Region-Code-Free-DVD-Player-RCA-input-Plays-CD-DVD-Region-1-2-3-4-5-6/dp/B000N23JL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philips Multi Region Code Free DVD Player - RCA input - Plays CD, DVD, Region 1 2 3 4 5 6</a>&nbsp;---- Most of the Philips models have a code you can look up on the Internet, and some of them are ready, out of the box.

--A note on Picture Quality--
On a scale of 1 to 10, these are a 9. If you buy older DVD's of the series, the picture quality might be around a 5 or a 6, so be forewarned, that older versions were sometimes no better than VHS versions.

Of course you will have to view them on a computer or non-Regional DVD player. I have loved this series so much that I purchased over time the complete VHS tape set which I gave away when I purchased the Region 1 complete set which had a very poor picture quality and some of the DVDs would not play all the way through.
