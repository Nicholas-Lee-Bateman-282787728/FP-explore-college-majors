I learned that there are three main arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart - two are on the front outside of the heart itself, while the third artery is on the back outside of the heart. If any of these arteries become blocked the blood and oxygen levels to the heart are impaired, causing pain across the chest, down the arms, and also a feeling of being light-headed. If you experience these symptoms it's time to see your doctor. An angiogram will be performed where a dye is injected into the arteries to see where any blockages may be.

A heart bypass involves splitting the sternum apart, or breast-bone. Once that is accomplished, a vein from the leg, or a vein from behind the sternum can be used to bypass the blocked section of artery so that blood and oxygen flow freely to the heart again.

Sounds like a straight forward operation, and the doctor who discusses the procedure is very thorough and knowledgeable about this procedure. The patient is up and about after two days, and back to normal exercise within 4-6 weeks after the operation.

Can you hear my heart beating? I certainly hope so, or it means I'm dead. You'll enjoy this program very much! I certainly learned a lot about coronary heart-bypass procedures, and I think you will, too!! By the way, the audio and video quality of this program were excellent!!

Very well presented panel discussion about hernias and their causes and cures. Men are more likely to get hernias than women because of heavy lifting, and also due to jobs which require a lot of bending and muscle straining. Women due get hernias, especially after a pregnancy.

Some of the main factors which cause hernias are: smoking, heavy lifting, as well as congenital conditions. Hernias can become quite serious if not operated on. Some hernias of the groin area can strangulate - cutting off blood supply to the bowels, and this can cause gangrene in the bowels. This would be an emergency situation, requiring immediate medical attention and surgery.

The doctor in this program gives graphic representations of what a hernia looks like and what damage it can produce in one's body. The main symptoms of a hernia are: a lump somewhere in the body (protruding), pain (especially when coughing). If you experience any of these signs or symptoms, it's time to see your doctor.

Well written and produced program explaining the reasons and causes for hernias. A great watch for medical students or anyone who would like to know more about hernias and how they are caused and what to do about them. I highly recommend this medical program - very insightful.

Very interesting program with a panel discussion of parents and their children who have, or are experiencing the symptoms of tonsillitis - one child has had her tonsils removed, while the other child is preparing to have the operation. The symptoms of tonsillitis are usually a sore throat, frequently quite severe, as well as feeling tired, and possibly even having hearing problems. If these symptoms are left untreated, quinsy can develop, and when this occurs the tonsillitis spreads beyond the tonsils and form abscesses.

The operation is explained in detail and seems quite uncomplicated. Normally children between the ages of 4-12 are the most likely candidates for this kind of surgery. However, it is now becoming more common for adults to have their tonsils removed, which was not always the case. The criteria for tonsil removal is if you have been experiencing tonsillitis for more than two years with frequent bouts of the illness, then it's time to have the surgery.

I've had tonsillitis most of my life, and I know firsthand how painful it can be. If only I had had my tonsils removed when I was a child, I could have spared myself a lot of grief and misery.

This is a great program! Tonsils are something which we don't give much thought to, but this program will make you think about your tonsils in a different way - as a disease fighting organ, and one which should not be simply dismissed or overlooked. This program is a great watch! Here's to your good health and good tonsils -cheers!",1379030400,,4296,4.776280323450135
