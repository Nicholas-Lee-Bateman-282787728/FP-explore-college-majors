Lorne Green makes a great defense lawyer.  Interesting facts are revealed.  No verdict is reached in the movie--the viewer gets to make that judgement on his/her own.  I hadn't seen this in years, but was glad to add it to my video collection.  Its well worth the money and the time that it takes to watch",1391212800,,459,4.341176470588235

7907366,4,B00000F6QZ,"I watched all 3+ hours of this Made For TV film in one continuous sitting and I doubt I would not ""pause"" Oliver Stone's film!

Actor John Pleshette does an Emmy-worthy job as LHO - I can't imagine any better-known actor being more effective. Maybe not *Oscar*-worthy but subtle and just mysterious enough.

For the serious 11-22-63 researcher there's alot to bemoan, i.e, the ""missing"" people such as Jack Ruby, David Ferrie, Ruth Paine (*essentially* missing as a CIA-related figure); ""missing"" history such as the General Walker attempt; also some invented characters to bring out some frowns. Plus alot of ""soap opera"" with Lee and Marina to suggest that the marriage was, basically, stable.

Time has resolved some issues, i.e., that (reportedly) the *original* site for the assassination was *not* Dealey Plaza; that the fatal shot was possibly from an ""explosive"" (non-Manlicher-Carcano) rifle from the right front.

Location shots add alot to the drama, in fact, we are taken right up to the sixth floor of the TSBD!

I do not want to give away the ending but I can assure the reader and potential viewer that this movie will leave your head spinning! Maybe not enough to change your mind - maybe enough to get you to shake your head and say...I never thought of that!",1311292800,2,1276,4.861751152073733
7907367,4,B00000F6QZ,"Lee Harvey Oswald shot and killed President John Fitzgerald Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963. The evidence that shows Oswald to be guilty of that murder is massive in quantity and scope.

The 1977 made-for-TV movie --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Trial-Of-Lee-Harvey-Oswald/dp/B00000F6QZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Trial Of Lee Harvey Oswald""</a>&nbsp;-- depicts a fictional account of what Oswald's court proceeding might have been like if LHO had lived to stand trial for the murder of JFK.

Many people seem to think that Oswald would have walked away a free man, in a court of law, if he had not been killed himself by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jack-Ruby-s-bullet-on-November-24-1963/dp/B0000W08GE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jack Ruby's bullet on November 24, 1963</a>.

And some conspiracy theorists also think that if Oswald himself had taken the witness stand at his trial, he would have somehow exonerated himself and (according to certain conspiracists) would have revealed himself to be just what those theorists think Oswald was -- an innocent ""patsy"", who was set up and framed for the murder of President Kennedy.

But, in my opinion, it's very unlikely that Lee Oswald would have taken the witness stand at his own trial (had he lived long enough to do so). He would have been a fool, in fact, to take that witness stand and say a single word to the jury who would be ultimately deciding his fate.

A prosecutor like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vincent-T-Bugliosi/dp/1403405336/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vincent T. Bugliosi</a>&nbsp;would probably have been able to convict Oswald (in the jury's mind) within the first few minutes of Vincent's cross-examination of LHO.

Let's listen to some of the questions that Mr. Bugliosi would probably have asked Oswald during LHO's first minutes on that witness stand in court (and we'll also listen in to Lee's likely answers as well)......

-------------------------------

BUGLIOSI -- ""Mr. Oswald, I now show you Commission Exhibit number 139, which is a bolt-action Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, serial number C2766. Police officers who testified at this trial have verified the fact that this exact rifle was found on the sixth floor of your workplace, the Texas School Book Depository, just 52 minutes after President Kennedy was shot and killed from right in front of that building on November the 22nd, 1963. A palmprint of yours was located on this exact weapon. .... I ask you now, Mr. Oswald, have you ever seen this rifle before?""

OSWALD -- ""No, sir. I have not.""

BUGLIOSI -- ""Did you, Mr. Oswald, ever send in a mail-order coupon to Klein's Sporting Goods in Chicago, a coupon for a 6.5-millimeter carbine rifle, during the first half of the year 1963?""

OSWALD -- ""No, sir. I didn't order any rifle through the mail.""

BUGLIOSI -- ""Have you ever owned a rifle in your lifetime, Mr. Oswald....a privately-owned rifle, that is, since you got out of the Marine Corps in late 1959?""

OSWALD -- ""No, sir. I have never owned a rifle in my life.""

BUGLIOSI -- ""Mr. Oswald, I now show you&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Commission-Exhibit-number-134/dp/6304290012/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Commission Exhibit number 134</a>, a photograph of a man who looks exactly like you--Lee Harvey Oswald. This man in the photo, who looks like you, is holding a rifle, has a handgun in a holster around his waist, and is also holding up two Russian newspapers, dated March 11th and March 24th of 1963. .... I ask you now, Mr. Oswald, are you the man depicted in this photograph?""

OSWALD -- ""No, sir. That picture must be a fake or something. I never posed for any picture like that in my life.""

BUGLIOSI -- ""Mr. Oswald, I now direct your attention to the date of President Kennedy's assassination--November the 22nd, 1963--and I ask you now, Mr. Oswald, if you know a young man by the name of Buell Wesley Frazier?""

OSWALD -- ""Yes, I worked with him at the book store....the Depository, I mean.""

BUGLIOSI -- ""And did Mr. Frazier give you a ride to work on the morning of President Kennedy's visit to Dallas--that is the morning of Friday, November the 22nd, 1963?""

OSWALD -- ""Yes....I believe I did ride to work with him that morning.""

BUGLIOSI -- ""Okay. And did you bring any type of paper package with you to work on that particular morning?""

OSWALD -- ""I brought my lunch. That's all.""

BUGLIOSI -- ""You brought ONLY a lunch sack with you to work on November 22nd, is that correct?""

OSWALD -- ""Yes, sir. I had my lunch with me.""

BUGLIOSI -- ""Did you have any OTHER paper package with you that morning at all? Anything larger than a small lunch bag?""

OSWALD -- ""No, I had nothing else with me that day.""

BUGLIOSI -- ""Wesley Frazier, just this morning, told this court and this jury that he observed you carrying a much-larger paper bag on the morning of November the 22nd. Mr. Frazier said that you told him you had some curtain rods in that larger paper package. Did you tell Wesley Frazier anything like that on the morning of November 22nd?""

OSWALD -- ""No, sir! Absolutely not! I don't know why he'd say a thing like that. I never told him anything like that.""

BUGLIOSI -- ""Mr. Oswald, another witness--Mr. Frazier's sister, Linnie Mae Randle--also testified during this trial that she also observed you carrying a bulky-type brown paper bag as you walked toward her house in Irving, Texas, around 7:10 AM on the morning of November 22nd, 1963. Was she mistaken, Mr. Oswald? Did she ONLY see your small paper lunch sack?""

OSWALD -- ""Well...er...I...uh...I really can't speak for what another witness might or might not have said. I can only tell you that she's wrong if she said I had a big bag with me that day. I just carried my lunch to work, like I usually do on work days.""

BUGLIOSI -- ""Thank you, Mr. Oswald....no further questions at this time.""

-------------------------------

The above questioning of Oswald would have been, of course, preceded by a parade of witnesses who would have confirmed (without a shred of a doubt) that Lee Oswald DID purchase Rifle #C2766 by mail-order in March 1963, and WAS photographed (by his own wife) while holding that weapon on 3/31/63, and DID take a bulky paper package into the Book Depository on 11/22/63.

Who do you think the jury is going to believe? The accused murderer? Or the succession of several different witnesses who all paint Oswald as the liar he obviously was when he told Mr. Bugliosi (via my simulated courtroom proceeding above): ""I have never owned a rifle in my life""?

The jury wouldn't even break a sweat on that decision.

In short, Lee Harvey Oswald's many, many LIES would have done almost as much to convict the bastard as would the wealth of physical and circumstantial evidence in the JFK case (which also convicts him ten times over, of course).

Here's a real quote from Vince Bugliosi this time (culled from the 1986 TV Docu-Trial, ""On Trial: Lee Harvey Oswald""), with Vince pretty much saying the same thing I just said above regarding Oswald's non-stop stream of lies that he told in order to distance himself further and further from the two murders (JFK's and J.D. Tippit's) he was charged with in 1963......

""When he was interrogated, Oswald, from his own lips, he TOLD us he was guilty....he told us he was guilty....almost the same as if he had said 'I murdered President Kennedy'....he told us. How did he tell us? Well, the lies he told, one after another, showed an UNMISTAKABLE consciousness of guilt. If Oswald were innocent, why did he find it necessary to deny purchasing that Carcano rifle from the Klein's store in Chicago? Why did he even deny owning any rifle at all? Why did he find it necessary to do that if he's innocent?"" -- VINCENT BUGLIOSI

7907368,5,B00000F6QZ,"Suppose that Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't killed and made it to trial? This TV movie explores this idea and does it with enthusiam. John Pleshette as Oswald does fine, but both the attorneys really steal the show. To see them (Ben Gazzara/
prosecutor & Lorne Greene/defense) squaring off is quite satisfying. You also get to see both sides struggling -- even doubting when other authorities aren't releasing info on Oswald for some reason and crucial witnesses are being killed. Was Lee a patsy like he said?
What I really enjoyed was when they took the trial to scene of the crime (it really was) and were performing tests of firing the rifle at the moving car. This part was done well and had a little surprise, too.
In JFK, I didn't enjoy Kevin Costner's dull speech to the jury during closing statements. To me, this is a better than JFK. JFK comes across as merely a conspiracy flick & it has way too much info to digest. I think that the real truth of the assassination isn't fully known, but JFK seemed too rushed.
Here, we have a trial that never happened. Real facts are presented in a courtroom setting and they aren't overwhelming (investigation of length of disassemble rifle; can the witness really identify the sound of shell casings dropping on the floor above him?) but we know it never took place and so it becomes more of a courtroom drama. The balance between this and conspiracy is exciting.
A great purchase.",1037923200,4,1425,4.636363636363637
7907369,5,B00000F6QZ,"This movie is awsome. It's not as good as JFK by Oliver Stone, but some of the reenactments are just as good. I just wish there had been some more reenactments of the assassination or if they had shown the shooters on the grassy knoll like in JFK. But overall, this is a very very good movie. All the reenactments, like the actual assassination are actually shot at the original School Book Depository. You get to see how the book despository looked back then. This movie presents both sides of what actually happened and in the end, they come to the basic notion that Oswald couldn't have done it. The package that he took into the TSBD was in fact current roads because they are the only things that fit they way people say they saw Oswald holding the package. if he did take the rifle and did disasemble it, it still would have been to long to cuff it the length of his arm.
in the movie, they also explain the sounds of the bullet shells hitting the floor like some of the guys had said who were standing on the 5th floor. a very good movie to watch over and over and over.",1000080000,3,1077,4.258536585365854
7907370,5,B00000F6QZ,"I know this made-for-television movie aired sometime in 1976, but I can't for the life of me remember it.  Regardless, I have discovered it now and I'm glad I did.  Any student or researcher of the Kennedy assassination, or  for that matter, anyone interested in the ""crime of the century""  should find this docudrama fascinating.  Not only is it filmed on location  (which alone makes it worth the price), it gives us both sides of the coin  - conspiracy and lone gunman theories - in glorious color.  Just the  thought that if Oswald would have lived to stand trial makes this movie  intriguing, even before you watch it.  The acting is good, the reenactment  of events (the assassination, the killing of Officer J. D. Tippit, etc.)  are better than those in Stone's JFK and the thought-provoking innuendos  are more than enough to keep one entertained throughout this three hour and  twelve minute offering.  I recommend this film to everyone who remembers  (and those who weren't born yet) the Kennedy assassination.  One note:  the  names of some of the major witnesses and players in the assassination have  been changed for whatever reason, but this does not detract from the drama  as it unfolds.  All in all, it is a wonderful movie - to be enjoyed over  and over again.  I hope they put it out on DVD soon.",964310400,9,1316,4.691629955947136
