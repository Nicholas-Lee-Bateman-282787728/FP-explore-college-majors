To me it is the epitome of film noir--the shades of moral ambiguity in the characters, the pitch perfect performances of the quartet, the breathtaking cinematography, the Citizen Kane-like camera angles on the staircase, the artsy sets, etc.) So naturally, I felt compelled to see more of their work.

Unfortunately their second collaboration Accident isn't quite up to their previous effort. Some of the shots look REALLY GOOD--especially in the gondola scene--but there really isn't much of a story to tell and most of the characters with the exception of Dirk Bogarde are about as one dimensional as you can get--the stereotypical faithful little housewife, blond bimbo, ladies man, spoiled rich boy, the 'desirable girl.'

I found the whole feel of the composition lazy and lacking in inspiration as there are several scenes of everyday life which simply drag on and on to the point of lethargy so when the climax and denouement comes it doesn't feel as powerful and resonant as the filmmakers intended.

Also it's got weird directorial choices. Delphine Seyrig's dialogue is entirely in voice overs--why not just have her talk through her one sequence like all the other characters?

It's not made clear either when Jacqueline Sassard snaps out of her trance. Are we supposed to believe she knew Dirk raped her and didn't press charges because she was too embarrassed? Or did she wake up after the rape and only thought he had brought her in from the car accident, or was it when she was in the car or when he helped her over the wall of the college? What the heck happened?

Sassard is like a talentless Audrey Hepburn. She has the looks, the demeanor, the persona but her line deliveries are robotic and monotonous. So Anna comes off as dull, vapid, soulless and perhaps stupid too. Two men falling for her is unbelievable but three defies the senses.

Dirk Bogarde tries very hard (in fact, he works wonders with every role due to his quiet, psychological style) and gives a convincing portrayal of a man struggling with midlife crisis but unfortunately he is weighed down by a script with all the tension of a soaked paper towel.

I understood the message of the film--getting away with your crimes is sometimes worse than going to prison because it means you have to live with them--but I think this would have been conveyed more powerfully if the film had been excecuted in a better fashion.

All in all, Accident is an unfortunate misfire.",1475452800,3,2537,4.842956120092379
7982661,4,B00008G5P7,"There were a lot of films around this time that took a similar approach to storytelling. Challenging time shifts, spare dialogue and an undercurrent of sexuality. Blow Up, and The Servant were two others in this vein, and they all stand the test of time. Everyone's terrific, especially Dirk Bogarde and Michael York, as the two main protagonists. I love this film. It's off beat enough to be interesting, and probably forgotten today, sadly, but if you're interested in film history, these cult classics should be on your list. Harold Pinter was a controversial writer, because he wrote the way people actually speak, which some people found trying. People repeat themselves, often don't say quite what they mean, and sometimes appear disinterested in what's going on. Just like real life. But the tension builds brilliantly. If you love this, you must try The Go Between, and even better film, with a wonderful screenplay by Pinter.",1435017600,4,934,5.032258064516129

7982663,5,B00008G5P7,"This all-star disaster movie""THE ACCIDENT"" was made by the same Canadian
filmmakers who made the all-star disaster movie spectacle ""CITY ON FIRE""
back in 1979. But unlike ""CITY ON FIRE"" which featured an all-star cast
of Hollywood's biggest name stars,""THE ACCIDENT"" features an all-star
cast of Canada's most popular stars in the early 1980's when the all-star disater movie genre was slowly,but surely,fading away. How this
particular disaster movie is SOOOOOOO DIFFERENT from all the rest;is
that it's main focus is on the disaster's AFTERMATH rather than the
ACTUAL DISASTER that occurs in the hockey arena extremely earlier on
in the film. Instead of the usual typical disaster flick,where it focuses
on what's going on with all of the main characters during the disaster
and their struggle to just make it out alive,we get a much more unique
story that focuses on all of the characters who survived the disaster
but at the same time lost loved ones that were very dear to them. The
movie focuses on how each of these interesting characters try to deal
with,struggle,and in the end conquer their most understandable grief
and mourning. Though the movie is NOT RATED,it does however have some
profanity in it,especially God's name in vain,and also some mild scenes
of sensuality. Just thought every Christian should know before they decide to purchase.",1239062400,,1356,5.112612612612613
7982664,5,B00008G5P7,"The simple decision of pursuing an very attractive student opens the gate to a complicated web of desire and deception; of immaturity and expected seduction. A magnificent exploration of the human behavior under certain border restrictions. Harold Painter, Joseph Losey and Dirk Bogarde had worked together previously in The Servant The undeniable Joseph Losey 's masterpiece, once more consolidated the best of each one of them in this casuistic and sinewy script with suggested motivations and smart dialogues that enrich still more a very meticulous film.

The style of Joseph Losey is reposed, hedonist, poisonous and very suggestive because his proposal has always been to demystify the bourgeois class through the sharp vision of their weaknesses and frivolities. And through the unavoidable process of decadence and moral disintegration, he unmasks the hidden perversions and surreptitious demons that coexist in the livings of this social stratum.

It is a slow paced film that deserves and demands all your concentration. But this effort has rewarding results at the end of the picture; sliding doors that invite us to rethink about a lot of unsaid attitudes and behavior patterns masked behind the conventionalism's ritual and the good manners.

A very sharp analysis of the social environment and a demolishing picture; Losey was another undesirable filmmakers who decided to emigrate England to maintain a certain distance respect USA. He was an eternal irreverent about the social patterns; if you examine briefly his films you will realize immediately, though you may argue there is a visible influence of the master of the silences. Michelangelo Antonioni.

Go for this and watch to that raising promise in progress: Michael York.",1133222400,20,1745,5.380952380952381
