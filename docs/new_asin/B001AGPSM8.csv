8277333,5,B001AGPSM8,"This fun pack contains three Hollie Hobbie episodes, i.e. Hollie Hobbie and Friends: Surprise Party, Best Friends Forever, and Secret Adventures. Each story runs approximately 44 minutes and there's the option of English subtitles for the hearing impaired.

The stories themselves are engaging and will appeal to young girls, ages 5-9. This Hollie Hobbie is the great-granddaughter of the original Hollie Hobbie and together with her best friends forms the Hey Girls club. The stories have wonderful themes centering on friendship, the spirit of community, and many other positive messages.

In Surprise Party, Hollie's beloved Aunt Jesse is about to have her birthday and Hollie gets overwhelmed trying to make all the preparations for the party. Her best friends Amy and Carrie would love to help but are hurt by Hollie's increasingly bossy behavior. This eventually makes Hollie realize how important teamwork is.

In Best Friends Forever, Hollie and her friends wonder about the secret of Crow House, a dilapidated old building. To Hollie's surprise, she discovers that Mrs. Annabelle Crow used to be Hollie's great grandmother's friend. Hollie is determined to help Mrs. Crow and rallies the community to help.

In Secret Adventures, Hollie and her friends learn a valuable lesson about when it is important to keep a secret and when it isn't. When Hollie and her friends accidentally spill the sap meant for the maple syrup made by Hollie's mom and aunt, the girls keep it a secret and decide to get more. This requires them to go into the deeper and more dangerous part of the woods. The girls soon realize that they should never have kept such a secret from the grown-ups.

Both my second grader and I loved these Hollie Hobbie stories and found them a breath of fresh air compared to some of the kids' programming on TV these days.",1357603200,4,1840,4.980456026058632
