8378037,4,B002QWIX0O,"Wennblom offers a sound, easy-to-follow guide to starting out in making these beautiful woven chains. Demonstrations and explanations are very clear, and she goes out of her way to minimize the number of different tools used and cost of the materials. On the whole, it's a great introduction.

But it's just an introduction. By design, she omits issues things like annealing the finished work - important for silver or copper, but impossible with coated craft wires, and demands tools that she chooses to omit. There are more ways to finish the ends, too, but again might step out of the tool comfort zone she addresses. I don't mean this as criticism: this is a great resource for her target audience, but perhaps not for viewers with more metalworking background.

8378040,3,B002QWIX0O,"This does give you the basics and stops. It is not as complete as I expected. She could have given as little more of how to fix errors, what expectations you could expect with various wires. I just was surprised. I could get this much on Utube.",1312243200,14,244,4.212765957446808
