7710808,4,B01DBXZRG4,"CMBB is a good show, but I think this is an inflated price for only thirteen episodes. It was not as good in the beginning, but as the actors got more into their characters, it got better, and I am sure season 2 will be better than this one.",1474502400,2,241,3.938775510204082
7710809,4,B01DBXZRG4,"Criminal Minds is a series that's not for everyone
It has elements of classic Cop/Detective series but, it's cranked-up the subject matter is really dark and at times way to real

Beyond Borders is the third spin-off of Criminal Minds
Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior was the second and only lasted one season
Suspect Behavior was ambitious and solid but, it never caught on with the tv viewing audience
But, somehow the likes of CSI and Mad Men did? go figure
There's a lot to like about this spin-off
It's filmed beautifully (I'm curious how they are gonna pull off doing exotic locations every week) with a budget
It can be done if you have the right casting director and talented producers/directors on board

The cast is also extremely strong with the likes of a Gary Sinise leading the cast it's a real must see

Gary Sinise (Jack Garrett) Sinise doing network tv now in 2016 might be overlooked but, having a presence like him on a tv show is refreshing
Alana De La Garza (Clara Seger) Alana is one of those ""Oh Her"" type actresses she's awesome! She is also a Dick Wolf actress
The only time she was miscast was in Scorpion
Daniel Henney (Matthew Simmons) he's one of those actors that is a true breakout star
Annie Funke ( Mae Jarvis) This is her big break on a national/global series she much like Sinise has this presence
She is immediately likeable and has very organic/real chemistry with Sinise and Henney
Tyler James Williams (Russ Montgomery) best know as the title character from Everyone Hates Chris all grown up
He isn't in much of the Pilot but, when he's in it he's decent
All five of these characters are interesting for different reasons and the cast itself is the right amount 5 is the perfect number that way nobody gets lost in the shuffle and everyone gets to develop

The Pilot was engaging and not as dark as many of the original Criminal Minds episodes tend to be
tv viewers should try and give it and chance while it's not breaking any new ground
It has a standout cast with visually stunning locations it can only get better with time and it's not Survivor, The Amazing Race and all the other fake reality stuff we've been getting the last 15 years
The first/freshman season overall is strong maybe 3 episodes were weak everything else enjoyable/interesting
Not sure why the first season didn't get a legit HD Blu-Ray set
Hopefully the dvd will be a strong transfer  9/10",1472083200,13,2403,4.605140186915888
7710810,1,B01DBXZRG4,This DVD set is way overpriced especially since there is not a full season the DVD set only includes 4 discs.  Amazon once again is ripping off its customers.,1470096000,12,158,4.448275862068965
7710811,5,B01DBXZRG4,"I was fascinated with all the different locales in all the episodes. I got attached to the team, also just as in the original Criminal Minds. Now I just have to try to obtain season 2",1518134400,,183,4.111111111111111
7710812,1,B01DBXZRG4,Original cast will always be the best,1513555200,,37,4.428571428571429
7710813,5,B01DBXZRG4,"I am a big fan of Gary Sinese. As usual he again does a marvelous job. I am also a fan of Alana de la Garza. I am just sorry that she left Scorpion for a show that was quickly cancelled. The rest of the cast is good, too. I wish CBS had not cancelled this show as I was ready for several more seasons. I heard it was because it was so expensive to produce. Maybe they could have done fewer shows per season. Why doesn't the success of Criminal Minds transfer to any of its spinoffs?",1513123200,3,482,3.9285714285714284

7710815,5,B01DBXZRG4,Great spin off series and such a shame that it was cancelled after only 2 series.

7710827,5,B01DBXZRG4,"Love Criminal Minds, all of the different series.  Even though Joe Mantegna is not in this one, it's Gary Sinise.  But this Complete Season 1 DVD set had disc 1-2-3-1... no disc 4.  Amazon is sending a replacement Season 1 Set.  If it has the correct discs in it, I'll change this to 5 stars...

Amazon rocks, got my replacement.  Can say this series is everything you hope for in a Criminal Minds spin-off with the bonus of Gary Sinise... did I say that already?  Let me say it again.  Gary Sinise!!!!!",1499558400,2,503,4.391304347826087

7710834,5,B01DBXZRG4,"I absolutely love this series. Gary S. is at the top of his game as usual and the rest of the cast does great as well. I like the international mysteries even if they aren't always geographically accurate. But hey, creative license is allowed right? I am in the middle of watching S1 and can't wait to get to S2. I hope this show will be on for a long time to come.",1492041600,,365,4.013698630136986

7710840,1,B01DBXZRG4,"Return of the ugly American! I really wanted to like this series. I like Criminal Minds and I thought such a premise on an international stage would be fascinating. Oh, was I wrong. Gary Sinise's character was condescending to all foreign police agencies. In the Thailand episode, the perp was akin to the ""Wild Man of Borneo"" with Amazonian sticks pierced through his cheeks. I work in Thailand for some years and this ""ritual"" & attitude is unknown in the Thai context and immensely contrary to the actual Thai sensibilities. And then the area of Thailand shown as the zone of the serial crime is nonsense as some lush tropical jungle - the real area looks more like Long Island, New York. The Japan episode, centered on an unrealistic plot, involved a quirk that very few Japanese engage in and presents this quirk as a larger phenomenon than it actually is. The Caribbean isle episode had Daniel Henney's character riding his motorcycle on the island without a destination or a purpose. The team has a giant plane that carries their vehicles - first these vehicles are not the Batmobile and it's better to use local vehicles since they are less conspicuous and conform to the local standards as in Thailand where the British system of driving exists. Annie Funke's character as the bitter, neurotic ""fat"" person stereotype is bad - why not have Annie Funke's character self-confident and happy while ""beautiful"" Alana de la Garza's character be bitter & neurotic? Well, I'm bitter & neurotic that such a great idea for a series was turned into a pitiful experience for all involved.",1486944000,3,1586,4.834558823529412
