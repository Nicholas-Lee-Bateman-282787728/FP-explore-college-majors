8098821,5,B000198ADY,"A superb Doctor Who masterpiece, one of the best featuring the quintessential Doctor, Mr. Tom Baker!
This story would have been an excellent theatrical film, especially with a decent budget to work with.
It's too bad we don't get to see more of the planet Mars. Greatly missed potential.
I don't really care much for the Satan reference for the villain Sutekh, but at least they don't dwell on it. It could have been truly morbid but Doctor Who was intended for young people first and foremost. I don't think anyone understood this more than Tom Baker himself and it shows in his popularity.
Sutekh's head assistant, Marcus Scarman, is masterfully portrayed by Mr. Bernard Archard with an intensity that would rival the great Boris Karloff. Tremendous talent.
This is a very worthwhile disc to have but like all my other PAL format BBC DVD releases the live video segments have been processed or filtered to look like film which gives it a slightly grainy appearance reducing definition. The filmed scenes look fine, on par with NTSC releases.
I can't understand this compromise in video quality when it is not necessary.
Maybe it is just a technical issue with my player or TV. I'll experiment and update my PAL video reviews if necessary.*
This being said some of my best DVDs are in PAL format.
I absolutely love my Avengers series 5 and series 6 OPTIMUM Studio/Canal DVD releases, outstanding quality.
I'm also very fond of my Morrissey: Who Put The M In Manchester DVD, exquisite video quality. My NTSC converted copy had horrible ghosting. Useless and a Professional release!
The best quality Doctor Who release I have purchased is The Legacy Collection, PAL Region 2. It includes the unfinished story Shada (2 disc) and the documentary More Than 30 Years In The Tardis (1 disc).
It does feature the muted film-like live video phenomenon but is exquisitely restored, beautiful video and audio. The best I have seen for classic Who.
Quality is fickle, or maybe highly subjective.

PAL format releases can be a real bargain but if you want BBC videos it may be best to stick with your native format/region unless they are HD restorations.
I think it is inevitable for complete classic Doctor Who collections to be released on Blu-Ray. Eventually...

Do I regret buying this DVD? No. I am a bit disappointed with its slightly lower quality but it is virtually identical to NTSC Region 1 releases. Same menus, features and extras.
Some Player/TV combinations may produce better results than others.

A poor man's option for hard to get (expensive) titles.

*Update: 3/19/18-

I now have a 4K TV along with a multi region 4K player and this disc is equal to the Region 1 NTSC edition in quality.",1490140800,,2696,4.814254859611231
