No longer willing to wait, Doris lets loose with the wild crowd in order to make Sandy jealous. She goes a little too far. This film barely breaks the average barrier, but has some entertainment value. I enjoy peeking into the social life and party lifestyle of the 20s, and this film allows for that experience. Watchable, amusing, and entertaining enough to keep you in your chair.",1523232000,,531,4.6
8462977,1,B0059GVBJY,"The actual movie isn't bad - certainly deserves better treatment than this. Looks like a shaky 8mm transfer, which may be the fault of the print but if you're looking for genuine flapper movies for costumes etc I'd recommend ""Dancing Daughters"" ""Pandora's Box"" ""Piccadilly"" where you can actually see everything.",1377820800,,312,5.26
