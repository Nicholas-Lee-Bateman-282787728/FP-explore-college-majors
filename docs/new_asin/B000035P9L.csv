7916676,5,B000035P9L,"Dear fellow fans,
It was a few months ago I first watched ATGB. My mother had brought it home on-rent from the library she works at. It was series 3. The cover, showing a family gathered for a group shot did NOT look at all appealing. Neither the title. From the cover alone (and I am NOT one to judge a film, TV series nor book by it's cover; though that's how I'm coming off... ) I thought I could afford to miss this. Anyway, the family popped it in the VCR and I sat down just to ""sit through it"". Not five minutes into the first episode and I could NOT believe the CHEMISTRY these two folks had! It was pure magic, REAL LOVE! I just fell in love with this couple, then and there! And then, when I learned of their history... oh my goodness, I smiled! I really smiled and I was hooked. And the writing... how .....GOOD is the writing? All I can say, folks... is that this is my favourite TV show now, of all time. And to think people swoon over the Ross and Rachel chemistry.. Gimme ol' Jean and Lionel! The sweetest, most ""meant to be"" couple in the world! - Bless you all and enjoy!",1011744000,,1088,4.112676056338028
7916677,5,B000035P9L,"For those who haven't seen the series, it is a great series with my lady Dame Judi Dench, she is awesome and looks great and does her part well and Sire Geoffery who places opposite of her, it makes you nostalgic for those days of being in love and finding lost love.  The supporting cast fills out the meat of the Dame and Sire and I think all both old and young will enjoy a great story that has been lost on television for many years
As Time Goes By...You will feel the story and love the characters and relate to them and sometimes hate them but still hold them close",998438400,4,571,4.1441441441441444
7916678,5,B000035P9L,"I am totally hooked on all of the English sitcoms but I must say this is my favorite. For obvious reasons of course. Since I became familiar with Judy Dench I've seen every things she has done and this is her best work on Television. The cast, the story line is just to good for anyone to miss. Lionel is one in a million. I would love to have their life and relationship. I can have a totally wrotten week and have only to watch this on Friday night and I'm set for the weekend. Better than US TV anyday. Since I'm planning a trip to England this Christams, I'm wondering if Ms. Dench will be doing anything at that time. If Anyone out there has any idea, please contact me if you know, PLEASE.....This is a dream I have...TO MEET HER IN PERSON AND SEE Anything she is in at that time, A STAGE SHOW IF POSSIBLE. Love this group and I hope to see many more yers of ""As Time Goes By..Couldn't live without it...",989107200,2,910,4.146892655367232
7916679,5,B000035P9L,"I ran across this series several years ago and found it delightful.  When I started watching it Jean and Lionel were already married so I purchased the first four Volumes to rather catch up.  It is the best series of it's kind to come out of England. I love the relationship between the couple as  my husband and I are of the same age and I can really relate.  Keep it up, looking forward to more of this wonderful series.",978480000,10,422,4.2375
7916680,5,B000035P9L,"This is absolutely the most wonderfully written and acted British comedy series ever aired in the US! And between Geoffrey Palmer as Lionel and Philip Bretherton as Alistair (who happens to be gorgeous), I cannot imagine a show with handsomer leading men!  Of course, Judi  Dench is no slouch either and Moira Brooker is really charming, so there's  an excellent cast. The writing is very good - subtle humor and warmth that you  don't normally get from Britcoms. I can't help but gush - buy all of the videos and get to know these people!",956707200,6,539,4.6421052631578945
7916681,5,B000035P9L,"Tender, funny and charming story of Jean and Lionel, lovers during the Korean war, who meet again 38 years later.  Volume 3 contains 4 episodes of the British TV comedy.  In episode 1, Lionel's book about his life in Kenya  is about to be published and he is is scheduled for a photo shoot for the  cover of the book.  Jean goes along for moral support, neither of them  knowing that the photographer has planned for Lionel to wear  safari gear,  with a half-dressed woman hanging on his leg.  Lionel is appalled - after  all, he was a coffee planter, not the great white hunter! Episode 2 has  Judith's adult daughter planning a weekend out of town so that Jean and  Lionel will have the house ""all to themselves"" - a situation to  which neither knows how to react. In episode 3, Lionel is having trouble  dealing with his ""old age"".  He and Jean take a trip to visit  Lionel's 85-year-young father who is planning to remarry, and advises  Lionel to do likewise. In Episode 4, Lionel's book is nearly ready to be  released.  Everyone knows the book is dull, but Alistair, Lionel's  publisher, is taking an unusual amount of interest in Lionel and his book  and Lionel wants to know why.",948412800,20,1187,4.504716981132075
