1371802,1,B00004Y7CX,"GREAT STORY/GREAT FILM/HORRIBLE edtion. GET THE PREVIOUS VERSION/THIS ONE HAS A REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD ENGLISH VOICE-OVER DUB...So bad it hurts!!! I rented this version of Balzac from the video store tonight originally thinking it was the only version. I, like the other reviewers here, was horrified to find Gerard Depardieu's voice being dubbed over by someone who sounded like ""Daddy Seaver"" on the horribly cheesy 80's sitcom Growing Pains. It had the same screachingly criminal effect as, say dubbing over Laurence Olivier in ""Wuthering Heights"" with the 'hey dude' voices/tones found in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. I immediately called the video store back to find out if there was another version of the same film (preferrably one IN FRENCH with English subtitles) WHICH THERE WAS. They exchanged it with no hassle. Now I can sit down and enjoy what looks to be a great film of one of the most exemplary literary figures in French history. Don't waste your time with this newly released in Lion's Gate 2006/2007 version. Get the older 1999/2000 Fox Lorber/Bravo version!",1177804800,51,1085,5.101123595505618
1371803,5,B00004Y7CX,"Can a three hour miniseries do justice to one of the most prolific French authors ever? No, but this one does sweep through Balzac's life and hits the high points enough to make one want to read or know more. If there is one central theme to this entire series it is this:the little boy in Balzac NEVER got over the simple fact that his Mother never loved him. Everything he did,touched,wrote was colored by his cold abandonment of his Mother. With that in mind,watch this sweeping biopic masterfully executed by the likes of Gerard Depardieu,Jeanne Moreau and Fanny Ardent and be transported into a very accurate portrayal of the times that the likes of Balzac,Hugo,Sand and Sue lived and wrote. EXCELLENT COMPANION FILMS would be COLONEL CHABERT and COUSIN BETTE (both adapted from Balzac) and LES MISERABLES (by Victor Hugo) and IMPROMPTU (about Georges Sand and Chopin) to help fill in the spaces in that period of history.

DO NOT PURCHASE THE ENGLISH DUBBED VERSION!!!! Stick to the original. It is VERY accessible and readable on VHS or DVD.",1173225600,8,1048,4.822222222222222
1371804,1,B00004Y7CX,This movie has been dubbed and contains no french track. I stopped watching after 5 minutes. I wish I could return this DVD.,1172966400,3,124,4.434782608695652
1371805,1,B00004Y7CX,"There is no French soundtrack on this DVD to go with the legendary French actors.  There is just an English subtitle with HORRIBLE english overdubbing.  The voices are woefully miscast, even worse if you are familiar with the famous French actors true voices. And the Foley work is just amateurish.  It was a total distraction throughout the whole 3 hours. Absolutely a waste, with little entertainment value.  Stay clear and try to find a version with original dialogue (and English subtitles if necessary).",1170979200,18,508,5.0843373493975905
1371806,5,B00004Y7CX,When I first saw the movie I was hooked on the spot. The cast and the acting was good along with the sets and camerawork. Jeanne Moreau and Gerard Depardieu are a perfect match as mother and son in the film. But I wanted to see more of Jeanne Moreau in the film and want to see more highs and lows in the mother-son relationship. The scene which nearly made me cry was Moreau's character at the door asking for her son's forgiveness. Give Jeanne Moreau a good script and she will give you your money's work.,1083715200,6,507,4.237113402061856
1371807,4,B00004Y7CX,"This tv serie is one of three DEPARDIEU played in .It is not easy to deal with such a towering figure like BALZAC.Although it was a valiant try to summarize some highlights of his life,the serie only partially succeeds to interest viewers. My favorite segment is the one with the RUSSIAN comptess who falls in love with HONOR.It really shows the importance that correspondance had in that century,especially when you deal with a writer,it really becomes essential. Like many great writers,BALZAC's greatness is not his personnal life but is all contained in his novels. The legendary aspects of BALZAC are there(LA CANNE AU POMMEAU D'OR,SA FAMEUSE CAFETIERE WHO KEPT HIM AWAKE DURING THE WEE HOURS etc.)If you want to buy one serie among the three,buy LES MISRABLES, in which DPARDIEU is VALJEAN and MALKOVICH JAVERT.Overall,it is the best of the three.",1030233600,5,853,5.056737588652482
1371808,3,B00004Y7CX,"Honore de Balzac (1799-1850) is the towering giant of French literature and the founder of the contemporary realistic novel in which social pressures and cultural themes are examined as the molding forces on the raw human personalities that inhabit these environments.
""BALZAC: A LIFE OF PASSION"" attempts to reveal the inner life of the indulgent and prolific man who created over 2,000 literary characters. Depardieu, looking bigger than ever, is certainly a perfect embodied of the bloated physical persona of Balzac. And is even a match for the well-known sculpture by Auguste Rodin.
What's missing are the things that triggered the great writer's stories. A top notch international cast, including Jeanne Moreau as Balzac's domineering mother, and Fanny Ardent as married Russian noblewoman Eva Hanska, the love of his love, contribute a lot to making this three hour French TV biopic an engaging diversion. Great onscreen impassioned speeches almost make-up for the off-screen, allegedly passionate, writing and lovemaking. The matted widescreen disc has filmographies and weblinks.",1009929600,3,1088,5.5602409638554215
1371809,3,B00004Y7CX,"This is a good sturdy film about Balzac, with great cast, although one gets a little tired of Gerard being in every French production.  Don't they have other actors?  But this is beside the point, and in this movie he's done quite well.  Jeanne Moreau is superb as his mother, and Ardant also gives a very satisfying performance.  Overall, it's a good traditional production, in the realism style, and for those enjoying films of this kind it will be a pleasure to watch. But don't expect any novelty in it, and that's why I gave it 3 stars - I would want to see something more unusual or witty, maybe not such a traditional approach, something in style of the statue of Balzac by August Rodin.",1006473600,6,694,4.484126984126984
1371822,1,B00004Y7CX,I did not realize that this version was English only.  It is the worst voice over I have ever heard.  I will be buying the French version of this ASAP.  BEWARE this is terrible I only made it through five minutes.,1282262400,4,213,4.146341463414634
1371823,1,B00004Y7CX,"It's dubbed - and not very skillfully either.  Yuck.  I couldn't watch it, so I can't complain otherwise.",1276473600,4,105,4.777777777777778
1371824,3,B00004Y7CX,An interesting telling of the life of a 19th century French author who is not all that well known outside literary circles.  It is well acted with beautiful costumes and scenery.  A major flaw in this Lionsgate presentation is the fact that the film is badly dubbed in English with no French soundtrack.  It would have been far better in the original French with English subtitles (which are available as an option in this print).  The original intent may have been a dual soundtrack.  They really dropped the ball on this one.,1271203200,2,527,4.684782608695652
1371825,1,B00004Y7CX,I bought this movie only because I thought it was in French. The site doesn't say it is in English.,1252800000,2,99,4.0
1371826,3,B00004Y7CX,"Perhaps had this movie not been dubbed in English and, instead, left in the original French, this movie (which looks more like a made-for-TV-movie than a theatrical release) would have seemed better.  This mostly covers the period of Balzac's life right before he meets Countess Hanska (or Hanski) and the development of their relationship.  If one judges Balzac solely based on this movie, one would think that he was never a popular writer or person.",1250985600,,452,5.013333333333334
1371827,1,B00004Y7CX,"WARNING! Allow me to join the group of other naysayers about this insult of an edition from Lionsgate.  The English dubbing sounds like a bunch of wacky and untalented college kids snuck into the film studio and, as a joke, recorded their own soundtrack to this telemovie.  And nobody at Lionsgate caught the mistake before releasing it to unsuspecting patrons like myself.  Some joke.  I couldn't make it past twenty minutes.  Imagine the great Jeanne Moreau talking like Selma Diamond and you'll have some idea to how excruciating this version is.  Depardieu is closer to Howie Mandel for all you Mandel fans (include me out, please.)  In a single word: Irresponsible.",1250121600,5,670,4.981981981981982
1371828,1,B00004Y7CX,"I unfortunately got this substitute for the real thing. I did not have the imagination to even think that you would make Jeanne Moreay, Depardieu og Fanny Ardant speak english and ruin the whole film in the process.

Whoever made that stupid decision should be kicked in the bud for a week, because not only have this person undone most of the nerve in the film, the fact that you can get this version, has made the original version almost impossible to get.

If one cannot bear listening to French, and the saw dusted tounge of Jeanne Moreau, which is so much the very essence of Balzac's mother -  One should not attemt to even see Balzac.

Let us have the choise of the real thing and burn this copy in Hell.",1244505600,5,711,4.363636363636363
1371829,5,B00004Y7CX,"Why in the world did they not only dubbed it in English but also, o Lord, did not even leave the option of having original French at all? great actors, Depardieu, Marais, Ardant, all their voices lost to stupid dubbing. Horrible loss. Now, I am sure, Americans think that this is an American movie! Disgusting. Impossible to use for French classes.",1233964800,,348,4.721311475409836
1371830,5,B00004Y7CX,Read the book many years ago.  The movie is as good as the book.  I recommend to people who like to explore the biography of famous people.,1223942400,,139,4.111111111111111
1371831,1,B00004Y7CX,"Amazon's product description reads:  Language: English, French - which is false and misleading because there is no French to be found anywhere on this DVD.

Listening to the masterful delivery of Gerard Depardieu (one of the finest voices in in current cinema) being smothered by voiceovers less expert than a low budget kung-fu film was painful to experience. Amazon would be doing future misguided purchasers of this DVD a favor if they removed this dubbed version from the site.

However, if you're having trouble with the badly dubbed english your other option, the only one, is to enable the english subtitles and turn the sound off altogehter.  What genius was up all night thinking of that one?

The distributors must have anticipated the limits of viewers' endurance but did not have the budget or energy left to give us the option of the original french audio version. Obviously it's stressful packaging foreign productions like this for american audiences and we trust the inclusion of subtitles didn't cause too much lack of sleep.

The main lesson learned is read reviews when purchasing foreign films. It is not beyond a  distributors capacity to ruin fine productions such as this one.

If there must be dubbing for brilliant foreign actors I propose a new rule: only brilliant English actors can be used. I guarantee you Balzac did not sound like a bad actor flubbing a soap-opera audition.",1178928000,20,1405,4.9743589743589745
7926737,3,B00004Y7CX,"Regarding the dubbing issue on the Lions Gate release and any surprise over it... Well, what can really be expected from a version of this otherwise excellent Balzac biopic that so prominently has displayed on its cover artwork (both front and back) the Eiffel Tower - as if the image of the Eiffel Tower is somehow needed to validate any genuine French/Parisian provenance - notwithstanding that Balzac (1799-1850) died 37 years before construction of the Eiffel Tower even began...  ;-)  ;-)",1468195200,,493,5.074074074074074

7926742,1,B00004Y7CX,"I am very sorry that I failed to understand that this film has been dubbed.  I find it impossible to watch. (Or rather, I might watch it with the sound turned off; visually it is not disappointing.) I suspect that the voice which is matched to Depardieu/Balzac belongs to a man at least  ten years (or more?) younger than D/B, and it grates--like fingernails on the blackboard.  Whoever the voice belongs to, I find it impossible to believe that he is either French, or a
European, or a writer.  The other voices are equally unimpressive.  I am told that the Czechs have a great tradition of actors who dub.  Apparently no such tradition exists in the United States. (I see now that a previous reviewer had complained about the dubbing--once again, I can only say that this purchase was made too hastily.)",1319846400,,805,4.633802816901408
7926743,4,B00004Y7CX,"Personally, I enjoyed reading Balzac's novels and as a writer he fascinated me.  But I knew next to nothing about Balzac, the man.  I found this 2 disc DVD French biography of a writer performed by Gerard Depardieu to be greatly informative about his life and personal struggles.  Obese and physically unattractive, Balzac has wonderful mind and great spririt that women find irresistible.  He finds his inspiration everywhere: people he mets and interacts with, art, friend artists (like Victor Hugo) who share his passion for writing.

Jeanne Moreau gives unforgetable performance as Balzac's emotionally cold and distant mother.  It is her demand and criticism that pushes Balzac to become one of the greatest writers in French literature.  He did everything he could throughout his life to earn her love and approval without any success.

This DVD will not educate much about the works of Balzac, but it will give a complete picture of Balzac's temperament, his excesses and passion for life and love.  I enjoyed the wit and humor and charged emotion of performers in this biographical story about an extraodinary man who personal suffering helped create some of the most beautiful works of literature to this day.",1296172800,2,1218,5.111111111111111
7926744,5,B00004Y7CX,"I wanted to write a review after all of the bad ones I saw.
Yes, the dubbing over is poor, but have an imagination!!!
This is a fantastic movie, and the lines are written well,
unfortunately, dubbing is not usually done well.  It's still
a great movie about Balzac, his life and relationships.",1295654400,,293,4.528301886792453
7926745,2,B00004Y7CX,"I did not realize the Dubbing of the voices.  I was so excited to hear Depardieu and when I heard this other voice I thought at first it was being told from a different person for a moment.  Then when I never heard Depardieu in this whole movie it ruin it for me.  The movie sets and film was great but the voice dubbing was terrible.  I was so disappointed.
I do not recommend buying this version.

Should it come out with the actual voices of the actors then I will buy it.",1288828800,,475,4.064516129032258
7926746,1,B00004Y7CX,"Woof!  The voice-overs were laughable.  I HOPE the translation was not literally from the French e.g., we were missing some of that ""idiomatic"" feeling, because it ended up being the story of a Simpleton for Love who betrays two mistresses and then chooses an adulteress.  Well, this may be true of Balzac, I don't know, but what was indeed missing was ANY sense of who the ""genius"" writer was.  You start out knowing his mother refused to kiss him when he failed as a student.  Then the rest of his life, including his death, are fixated on this Freudian misstep.

Balzac was a writer who defined the French personality.  He was known for his eccentric work habits, which probably killed him.  This film gives three famous aging actresses an opportunity to grandstand in lovely costumes.  It is a beautiful bore.  And writers are correct in stating that Depardieu's gruff voice was a loss here, but his acting was still,empty and aimless.  Don't waste your money on this dressed-up bore.  Read Balzac and feast your eyes on Rodin's sculpture of this literary giant.",1286409600,2,1066,4.7967032967032965
