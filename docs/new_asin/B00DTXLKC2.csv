5855670,3,B00DTXLKC2,"This story was entertaining with comical scenes, but for the most part was realistic.  The actors were good in their roles.",1395532800,3,123,4.857142857142857
5855671,5,B00DTXLKC2,"Worth buying to own.  I am surprised it isn't more popular.  Both leads are good actors and they both have experience although I am not familiar with their work.  Too bad Ko Soo doesn't do more romance.  I would be interesting in following him in that genre.  As Kang - Il, Ko Soo, does a great job of being very much in love with his past love and Han Hyo-joo (Mi Soo) does a very good job of understanding that and loving him anyway.  She is a smart, pretty and daring character. Reminds me a little of Jun Ji Hyun in ""My Sassy Girl.""  At first I did not like Mi Soo. She seemed conniving in her pursuit but she does really fall in love with him. It is a nice touch that there is no angst about that as she willingly accepts that she is not his first love.  There is one particularly memorable scene that illustrates this. Although it does have some sad tones this is overall a happy love story without going into silly or over the top romantic comedy that has been popular of late.  Their supporting cast also is endearing.",1385769600,5,1026,4.220512820512821
5855672,4,B00DTXLKC2,"I saw this movie on an airplane, where I was a captive audience. It's very enjoyable, but not something you should take too seriously. Although the plot isn't deep, it's a fun romp, and the lead characters are pretty good. There are plenty of light-hearted scenes, and a few bleaker scenes -- although there's comedy throughout, it's not a typical romantic comedy. Quirky, if you like quirky.

The male lead is a firefighter, and there are lots of good fire truck scenes. The female lead is a doctor who leaves the profession to follow the firefighter around, which is not fully believable. If you can get past this improbability, it's ok. I didn't have any trouble with following the subtitles.",1379203200,,695,4.791666666666667

8597740,5,B00DTXLKC2,"Who doesn't need help with love? This is a throwback romantic screwball comedy without profanity and inane characters with 3-day growth, in other words adults with responsibilities instead of insecurities when it comes to their jobs. (Hollywood believes all actors work for the CIA or police with no time for hygiene) This romantic sleeper hides some savvy writing and editing style. Love does come to several characters in this contemporary take on the modern chase when a surgeon loses her job and seeks voluntary work with a paramedic team with plenty of bachelors. That is just for starters. As a paramedic, the amorous-bent ingenue-surgeon-now paramedic takes a while to fit in to the boy's club, an adventure on its own. However, a paramedic's day is hazardous, challenging and frustrating without romantic ambitions. This charming old-style chase has plenty of hazards, obstructions and sentiment to drive this to a surprising finish. Lives get saved, containing a suspense movie's heroics alone. All the principal actors are charmingly human with a believable camaraderie. I cannot give away the twist that is most compelling. Cary Grant and Carole Lombard would both approve this sentimental charmer.",1517616000,,1209,5.335078534031414
8597741,5,B00DTXLKC2,"Extraordinary performance by Han Hyo-joo, the female star.  The girl was absolutely amazing with her ability to make you laugh, snicker or cry.  I'm looking for more of her work.  For the past five years,I've gone over to Asian movies.  Some are disappointing, but many will take your breath away they're so good. Love 911 was one worth buying and keeping and playing over again, from time to time, esp after you've seen a bad one.",1507852800,,431,4.631578947368421

8597748,5,B00DTXLKC2,"This is the story of a ""peppy""(arrogant but caring and honest) doctor who loses a patient and becomes a paramedic to save her job and a dedicated fire fighter (and single father to a cute kid) who is still recovering from the death of his wife a year ago. They meet on the job and he helps her become a better person and she helps him get over his wife, as they fall in love, with their work mates helping out.
This was a surprise to me as I thought it was the type of film where the heroine was just there to be arm candy. Instead I got a nice simple romance with a good dose of drama. The action was believable and the characters were well rounded. The director(Jeong Ki-Hun whose name is the only one on the back of the box) did a good job, producing a very nice piece.
If you get this, I hope you like it as much as I did.",1453420800,4,826,3.9520958083832336
