320450,4,6301239571,"We had a lot of fun watching this DVD.  We were familiar with a lot of the songs, and the one's that we were not that familiar with were very good too.  I would recommend this to any music lovers.  the dancing and singing is terrific!!",1388275200,,235,4.065217391304348
320451,3,6301239571,"The 1970s' versions of art deco costumes, repetitive dance moves and cheesy performances are funny for all the wrong reasons.  I saw this on Broadway with this cast and I think that I liked it ok.  The big Ellington Orchestra was amazing.  Phyllis Hyman did bring the house down at least twice I recall.  Sadly, little of it holds up and it is only good as a museum piece.  Ms. Hyman died of a drug overdose and I have no idea where the rest of this troop ended up.  The shots of the overdressed audience looking bored is priceless!",1387238400,,532,4.3232323232323235
320452,5,6301239571,"The music was incredible! The quality of the dvd was really good and clear. The performances by Phyllis Hyman, Paula Kelly, Terri Klausner, Hinton Battle and the rest of the cast was really superb!!

The only downside was that being hard of hearing sometimes the songs were not loud enough to hear clearly for me... but even that did not take away from the joy and laughter and appreciation of this classic.",1386892800,,407,4.652777777777778

320467,5,6301239571,"Everything about this video is perfection, The music, the costumes, the sets and most of all the artists that make it al come to life. It seems like it just starts and suddenly (90 minutes ) it is over, leaving a smile on your face.",1368144000,,232,4.177777777777778

320469,5,6301239571,"Colorful, good music, educational.  The singers and dancers are extremely talented and entertaining. I used it for my students in Middle School.  For that age group, you prepare them  by hearing and singing some of the music with lyrics before.  Supply a question worksheet along with the lyrics for discussion and singing as you move along.  It's amazing that some of the students had heard the music at home and of course they already knew who Duke Ellington was.",1364601600,,465,4.8354430379746836

320471,5,6301239571,I have been looking for this dvd for quite a while.  I love Phyllis hyman in this play. She was great what a natural. I'm looking for any other plays Phyllis. Hyman has starred in. The disc was in perfect condition. Great quality! Great service !!!,1357948800,,248,4.391304347826087

320473,3,6301239571,"I absolutely love Phillis Hyman and that is the only reason I purchased this ""Play"" on dvd.  Unfortunately, I must confess that I was bored stiff with the overall play so I fast forwarded to Phillis' performances only.  I was not disappointed for one moment.  I'd make the purchase again just for the experience of this extremely talented woman who left this world entirely to soon.",1252022400,2,382,4.757575757575758

320476,4,6301239571,"I've been a longtime fan of ""Sophisticated Ladies"", ever since the Broadway cast album came out.  I was never blessed to see the production.  I was very excited discovering the existence of this DVD and it is quite magnificent.  Great performances shine throughout, but the unquestionable highlights are every appearance of the legendary Phyllis Hyman.  She takes command every time she's on stage with her mesmerizing stage presence and heavenly jazz influenced vocals.

The only thing that keeps this DVD from perfection is the absence of original cast members Gregory Hines and Judith Jamison, but it's real, real close.  I recommend highly as a must buy for Duke Ellington lovers and Phyllis Hyman lovers everywhere!",1233100800,5,720,5.217391304347826
320487,3,6301239571,"The Sophisticated Ladies is such a rarity and treat, you almost forgive the the director, cameramen and producers. I 'm sure they did the best they could but the fact that it's a live play captured on video constantly has you forgiving the quality. Phyllis Hyman is simply breathtaking, she completely commands the stage, you want her in every scene. Paula Kelly shows why she was such a triple threat, dancer, singer and actress. She seemed destined to lead in a producttion of  Chicago, the other cast members were fair and the dancing was okay, The Tony nominated performance of Phyllis Hyman is a must for you dvd shelves.",1225152000,3,626,4.743119266055046
320488,1,6301239571,"This CD wouldn't play at all. When I returned it I had hoped for a replacement CD, but got credit (I hope).

320490,5,6301239571,"Why did you have to leave me? Let's just be glad we have this performance to remember her. O the promise of things that could have been. Phyllis Phyllis, why did you have to leave?",1204156800,,180,4.171428571428572
320491,5,6301239571,"I LOVE this play...It's truly Broadway and the cast perfectly picked to lead said roles.  One cast member in particular --> the American Bombshell as gorgeous as she was Ms. PHYLLIS HYMAN.  I miss her so...I wish that she stayed with us a while longer, so that I could see her in concert.  I want to share my unforgettable moments with Phyllis - Well, the first time I meet Ms. Hyman was maybe around 1993 in Washington, DC on P' Street (around the N.W. or Georgetown area).  We were coming out of the FreshFields grocery store and there she stood (beautiful as she was) with rollers in her hair, slippers, and a bathrobe.  Through multiple request's, she gave us a front row concert seat and starting to sing 'Old Friend' and 'I Don't Want To Lose You' there in the parking lot.  We rewarded her with hugs, kisses, and much thanks.  And there she went...on her way back to her Georgetown home.  Out of concern, a group of us escorted Ms. Hyman back to her home.  Another, time was at a birthday bash for Phyllis' best friend at a club in DC (1995/in front of the Navy Yard).  There she sat (looking gorgeous as ever) smiling (larger than life) with those bedroom eyes --> She offered me a seat, hug, and some of her buffalo wings/drink.  It was like we were old friends, just sitting there hand dancing at the table.  So, I just wanted to share my private moments with Ms. Hyman and what she meant to me and the WORLD!  Again, the play was excellent and worth the price.

  Peace and Blessings
  A Longtime Phyllis Fan",1186358400,2,1519,4.402877697841727
320492,5,6301239571,"This is the finest live show that I have ever seen and I promise it will 'dazzle' you.

If you enjoy big-band jazz, sensational dancing and you're a fan of Duke Ellington, then this DVD is a MUST.

The audio and visual quality is first class and the individual performances are just breathtaking.

Ignor the comments of Vlad (the impaler?). He will most probably shout ""Humbug!"" at Christmas.",1166054400,4,392,4.735294117647059
320493,3,6301239571,"Don't rush and buy this DVD based on wonderful reviews like I did. Rent it first. Better yet, buy it from me - I am not watching it again.

There was some good singing and dancing, but not very much. A couple of stars could not sing to save their lives. Not exactly Broadway quality.

If you want a good jazz musical - get HBO's ""Smokey Joe's Cafe"".",1148601600,4,349,4.117647058823529
320494,5,6301239571,"This DVD is magnificent.  Honestly, the only reason I bought it is because my favorite artist is in it (Phyllis Hyman).  In my personal opinion, she stole the show.  Wow...she was great.  Don't get me wrong, though; the other performances are good, too.  Phyllis is even better, though.  This is a must have for any Phyllis Hyman fan.  Even if you aren't one, buy this.",1144972800,6,369,4.584615384615384
320495,5,6301239571,"When I saw this DVD, I can see why Phyllis won the Theater Desk award.  It was well deserving.  Her presence on that stage was like she belonged there and had been there all the time.  To hear her sing In A Sentimental Mood, she put her whole heart into it and I could feel what she felt.  It was chilling.  Phyllis stole the show.  She made the stage her own.  Sophisticated Lady is exactly what Phyllis was on that stage.  I'm sure when Duke wrote the song, ""Music Is A Woman,"" I'm pretty sure he had a woman like Phyllis in mind.

This DVD is a definite must have for any Phyllis Hyman fan.",1115856000,23,593,4.086956521739131
