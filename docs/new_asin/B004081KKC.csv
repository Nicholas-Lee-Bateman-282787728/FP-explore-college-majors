My step children lived in Germany as children, and they watched these movies many many times. I have heard the plot of the movies so many times that I feel as though I have seen them myself. Both boys are now grown and I thought this would make a perfect Christmas gift for them. I ordered it and then a few days later looked on the seller's website and didn't find an English version. After contacting them they told me that it was only in French, with French subtitles. Well, the movies finally arrived, and I was excited to see that it did in fact have English dubbing, but it was the WRONG MOVIE!!! They sent me the animated version, not the live action that I ordered!! I will NEVER order from inetvideo ever again!!!",1293580800,,1021,5.509554140127388
