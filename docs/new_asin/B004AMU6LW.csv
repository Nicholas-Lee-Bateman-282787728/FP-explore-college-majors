8420548,4,B004AMU6LW,"Unfortunately and unfairly this lies in the shadow of the similar, better known, and arguably better made ""King of Kong"" which came out a year later, Both are funny but compassionate looks at the 'outsider' communities of adults who play a kids game in a serious, competitive way. Both poke gentle fun at those who have made these 'sports' the center of their lives (air hockey in the case of ""Way of the Puck"", old-fashioned arcade video games in the case of ""King of Kong""). But both also show admiration for the dedication and passion shown by those who form these communities of misfits.

""The Way of the Puck"" is entertaining, although it does get a bit repetitive at times. It also makes a decent case for why air-hockey really IS a sport, and just how hard it is to play it really, really well. If not quite a great film, it's an enjoyable and human one.",1420243200,,861,4.484076433121019
8420549,5,B004AMU6LW,"What a great film !  Who would have known that Air Hockey had such drama and fierce characters.  We had not expected much, but the story of Air Hockey evolution and the critical group of guys who still remain so dedicated and work to keep the sport alive was fascinating.  A great story about struggle and persistence, and a can't-miss choice for a family movie.",1289606400,2,362,4.538461538461538
8420550,5,B004AMU6LW,Great documentary on the history of air hockey and the few people trying to keep it from disappearing.,1289001600,,102,4.722222222222222
8420551,5,B004AMU6LW,"I pre-ordered Way of the Puck and my entire family loved it. My 3 daughters and wife, all of whom are not typically enthused by air hockey, really enjoyed the film. They were pleasantly surprised by the creative take on the world of professional air hockey. It actually was able to keep their attention. So, I have to give it an enthusiastic thumbs up! I highly recommend you pick up the film.",1288915200,,393,4.472222222222222
8420552,4,B004AMU6LW,"As a fan and competitor, I found parts of the first half compelling.  Way of The Puck paints a great picture of the characters and community of a fringe sport that few are aware exist.  You will either be amused, disgusted or inspired when Mark Robbins talks about his new pickup line, that he would like to get to know a woman like he knows the inner workings of an Air Hockey table.",1288828800,2,384,4.2465753424657535
8420553,4,B004AMU6LW,"I love documentaries like this.  I was able to pre-order my own copy and am not disappointed.

Very much in the same vein as King of Kong, but we get a closer look into the personalities of competitive air hockey.  Everyone in the documentary was compelling in their own way.",1288828800,,275,4.46
