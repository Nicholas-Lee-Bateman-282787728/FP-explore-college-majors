972527,5,6305161550,"The delicate paranoia, the gaping loneliness, the schizophrenic glamour. In his watershed crime classic, the scorsese-damaged ""City on Fire"", nothing interests Ringo Lam more than the knotty moral and emotional tangles of the undercover life. Chow Yun Fat plays Ko Chow, an undercover cop who  infiltrates an enclave of jewel thieves and eventually gets sucked into an undertow of malice. Pretty soon, the line between what's prefab and what's true to life obscures to a blur and the secret identity becomes the alter ego. It is this precise moment that ""City on Fire"" snipes for dramatic grist.  Navigating this hyperkinetic slalom of bullets, betrayal and broken hearts with all the cunning facility of a mastermind, there's a reason why Lam was name-checked by Hollywood, alongside John Woo and Tsui Hark. And it's not just because Quentin Tarantino tactlessly shoplifted chunks of ""City on Fire"" chapter and verse to surplus his meal ticket to Hollywood, ""Reservoir Dogs"". ( Indeed, Hollywood pundits have chosen to sweep this henious incident under the carpet or write it off as some kind of homage or the other). Lam is no castoff. And no John Woo parrot by any stretch. Woo has plied these dire straits before, in ""Hardboiled"" ,also with Chow Yun and a pre-Cannes Tony Leung. But ""City on Fire"" is a more feral, more raw, less heroic and ultimately more tragic picture. Far from just another ""Honor Among Thieves"" rehab, it upped the ante of your routine cops and robbers melee. And , more than ten years down the line, still strengthens the argument for Lam as more than a high-impact action specialist. Simply put, a director on fire.",973641600,20,1643,4.949275362318841
972528,2,6305161550,"I first saw this gangsters and gunplay epic a few years back late one night on television. From that moment I decided to purchase the film on DVD. When I eventually got a player, years later, it was with giddy  excitment that I popped this title into the tray. Unfortunately, this DVD  showcases perfectly what can happen when little care is taken in the  mastering of a film. Now, i'm DEFINITELY NOT one of these people who whines  when the picture quality isn't perfect and other such things, but when I  saw this DVD I had to write this review to instruct people NOT to buy this  version of the film. So, I will now list the problems this DVD has: 1. The  Subtitles, they are TERRIBLE, they were obviously done by a person who did  not have even a 20% grip of the english language. Literally, they don't  make any sense in places. Secondly, they disappear far too quickly. I'm not  a slow reader but you'll be struggling to keep up. 2. The soundtrack is  terrible. I could be wrong on this point as I had not seen the film in  years, but I got the feeling that the Cantonese soundtrack had been dubbed  over with a Chinese one, including new sound effects which are disasterous.  The bottom line is that an amazing film has been ruined by these two  faults. If it weren't for the fact that the film is so good, I would have  given it 1 star. This review may be hard to stomach for the fans of this  film but please heed my words, I am a fan of this film too. If there is  another version available, please e-mail me.",954460800,49,1519,4.251748251748252
972529,2,6305161550,"OK, the cover to my DVD is slightly different from the one picture on amazon, but I imagine that this is the same release. THE ENGLISH SUBTITLES ARE AWFUL! Yeah, dubbed versions of Hong Kong crime are bad, but at least  you can follow the action. The English subtitles are godawful- broken  english, badly timed, often confusing, and it gives me the feeling that I'm  missing half of the movie. My recommendation is to rent a dubbed copy of  this film before seeing the subtitled version. That way, you'll know what's  going on, and be able to enjoy the film as it was intended. I give the DVD  2 stars only for the subtitles- it is a beautiful adaptation to DVD from an  image perspective...",952819200,9,692,4.488
972530,4,6305161550,"Personally, I don't think the story is all that great.  It is inconceivable that an undercover cop would be forced to risk his life after he had time and again asked for permission to resign.  The performance by  the younger, callous cop is especially annoying.  However, Chow brings the  film to life in his relationship with one of the gang members played by  Danny Lee (the cop from ""The Killer"").  This film pays attention  to his great acting abilities without guns as well as the action scenes  he's known for.",947462400,,516,4.644444444444445
972531,4,6305161550,"Ok, tarantino has the dialogue. But no one can doubt how blatant a rip off ""Reservoir Dogs"" was from this film. Tarantino's film is broken to basics and uses stylistic violence, Lam's films is a police action fare  (he's the HK master). What I love about Lam's films are the realism,  whereas John Woo (my fave) is highly stylized. All that considered, City On  Fire is the tragic story of Ko Chow, A HK undercover cop who blurs the line  between right & wrong, and loyalty while working undercover to bring  down a jewlery robbing syndicate. A word of note for DVD fans, the picture  quality of this DVD and sound quality are a perfect transfer! It looks and  sounds fantastic!",936057600,13,678,4.553719008264463
972532,4,6305161550,"This 1987 Ringo Lam classic reverses the roles of Chow Yun Fat and Danny Lee as later seen in the Killer.  The film is dated somewhat, but still shows Hong Kong cinema at the height of its energy  and Lam intensifies the  action with strong, inventive directing. Chow Yun Fat is as always  brilliant in the film, while Lee dutifully portrays the antagonist. As a  note, Tarantino used this film as the basis for his first film  ""Resevoir Dogs"".",922060800,7,444,4.556962025316456
972533,5,6305161550,"This movie is primarily known in America as the film on which Quentin Tarrantino's RESERVOIR DOGS was based.  That alone makes it a must-see, but it also stands on its own as a classic example of Hong Kong action.  Honor,  loyalty, and savagery come together to create a real powerhouse. Fat plays  an undercover cop assigned to infiltrate a gang of jewel theives.  He  befriends Lee, a member of the gang, while at the same time trying to hold  onto a disintegrating relationship with his girlfriend/fiance.  Not only  does Fat's job as a cop interfere with his home life, but he feels  increasingly guilty about betraying Lee. Fate and bureaucratic incompetence  combine to make the gang's final heist a bloodbath, in which Fat is forced  to participate.  In a chase/shoot out scene reminiscent of the end of  DePalma's SCARFACE, bullets fly and blood flows in the streets of Hong  Kong's diamond district.  Fat finally tells Lee of his betrayal, but not in  time to save either of them. This is a must-see for fans of Tarrantino,  Hong Kong actioners, or great caper-flicks!  Sadly, the  subtitles are  pretty pathetic (""No poiny gun boss"" is among my favorites), and  I was really disappointed that they didn't re-do them for the DVD (I've  shelled out a total of about $80 to get this on VHS, and later on DVD, and  I'd like to be reading complete sentences for that kind of money).  That  having been said, this is a GREAT movie!  See it!",916704000,20,1444,4.672

972636,2,6305161550,"Ringo Lam is (in my opinion at least) one of Hong Kong's most underrated directors and City on Fire is him in top form. Chow Yun Fat is brilliant (as usual) in the lead role and you can see the inspiration that Tarantino took for Reservoir Dogs. If you're a fan of  undercover cop films then you should definitely enjoy this.

It's a shame then, that the only U.S. DVD release of this film is english dub only with no special features.",1392854400,2,435,4.2926829268292686

972640,3,6305161550,"Famed among Tarantino's admirers and detractors alike as the film that inspired/was ripped off by Reservoir Dogs, Ringo Lam's City On Fire doesn't really provide much in the way of fuel or ammunition for either camp: in truth, it's a very different animal with only the last ten minutes bearing much resemblance to the massively-chinned fading wunderkind's breakthrough movie. Nor is it quite the classic of Asian cinema it is often held to be (presumably by those who haven't seen it considering how often it is wildly inaccurately described), but rather a solidly crafted Hong Kong cops and robbers flick that does its job well for 104 minutes but doesn't exactly sear itself on your memory. Yes, it does end up in a warehouse with three crooks having a Mexican standoff over an undercover cop bleeding to death from a stomach wound on the floor, but the bulk of the film is concerned with Chow Yun Fat's undercover cop trying to quit but forced into that fatal one last job infiltrating Danny Lee's gang of cop-killing jewel robbers.

Budget restraints restrict the amount of action, though what there is is typically well-handled, while as a dramatic character study it is somewhat diluted by the clumsy comedy with Chow's fiance and the signs of the usual making-it-up-as-we-go-along Hong Kong thriller screen writing that sees Lee's character change from stylish city slicker in the robbery scenes to a rather more simple-minded working Joe as he and Chow bond while hiding out before the last big job. It's not too strong on logic either, with some of the police too happy to torture one of their own and conspire to arrest him for it not to seem like stretching dramatic contrivance to breaking point at times. Yet for all that, on its own terms it works as exactly the kind of audience picture it was intended as - an unpretentious quality thriller a couple of notches above the production-line norm for the genre with a side-order of fatalism on the rocks.

While there are a lot of problems with Tai-Seng's DVD (subtitles chief among them), unlike the Dimension DVD it's not the dubbed version and unlike the Hong Kong Legends UK DVD it hasn't had the color regraded from the cinematographer's original intentions.",1177545600,2,2225,4.852631578947369

972642,4,6305161550,"I would have preferred to have seen this film in it's original Mandarin language track but I do not feel it is necessary to knock this edition.  I also take the unfashionable opinion that ""Reservoir Dogs"", Quentin Tarantino's homage(not rip-off) to ""City on Fire"", is the better of the two films.  ""Reservoir Dogs"" beats this film in terms of style and characterization if not completely original.  That said, this is a highly engaging film.  It has a compelling central premise of a police undercover operative who not only has to fear the crooks he's infiltrating but his superiors who view him with contempt.  There is action here for sure but it doesn't subvert the story.  I recommend this film for any fan of Hong Kong action films but if a Mandarin edition becomes available check that out instead.",1131235200,2,805,4.797101449275362
972683,5,6305161550,"Movie:  I finally got around watching one of Asian cinema's finest classics, Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire.""  I must say I was really impressed.  The film starts off on a little shaky ground but soon gains its footing and takes off when Chow's character (also named Chow) reluctantly goes undercover.  I really like the scenes where he's first tailed and then actually *hunted* by rival cops who seem to want nothing short of him being dead.  The ending is just incredible, not just the fireworks, but the way loyalty plays out.  The film is worth watching just for the last 30 minutes, although the rest is also well-paced and the part with the girlfriend thing is a little boring but does add dimensions to the Chow character, thanks to Chow Yun-fat's good acting.

DVD:  I know I'm not a purist when it comes to foreign films, and I usually don't like subtitles (esp. chop suey subtitles), so forgive me for saying I actually liked the dubbing job on this one.  There's no Chinese soundtrack on this at all, just English dub.  I thought the voice actors did a pretty good job, much better than any other dubbed foreign film I've seen.  The ADR remix was also really good, and they even have an English song worked into a nightclub scene.  I'm usually turned off by the high-pitched and cacophonous audio effects of Hong Kong films, but the American remix engineers did a very nice job at pairing surround sound audio with the great visual experience Ringo Lam has given us.",1114473600,3,1472,4.619230769230769
972684,2,6305161550,"I would like to give this version 5 stars, i love the movie, but this is the Dimension release which only offers an English language dub.

972685,3,6305161550,"While this movie may not be in the same league as some of the classic Chow Yun Fat thrillers (The Killer, Hard-Boiled, Full Contact, for example), this is still a decent action film.  The interplay between the characters is, unfortunately, cliched and sometimes ludicrous (the scene in the cemetery, for example), but the assured direction, complex storyline, and gritty realism more than make up for it; the jewelry heist and the nihilistic, bullet-riddled ending are particularly well-staged.  The DVD I have is the (badly) dubbed version, which sounds like it was done by a third-rate comedian locked in a closet.  The print of the film, however, is clear and sharp (I had seen this on videotape several years ago, and remember it as being somewhat grainy), though it did seem sometimes as if there was a little jumpiness from shot to shot in some scenes.",1062547200,4,858,4.903448275862069

If you get the Tai Seng version (with the faces of three actors and Chinese writing on the cover) you get the vastly superior original version with subtitles.

Movie starts at a stree market of Honh Kong, an undercover cop is killed by some Triad when they discovred that he's a cop.
Inspector Lau,(plays Chow YunFat's Uncle) wants Ko Chow(Chow Yun Fat) to finish the job.
Chow Yun Fat was not as slick or genius in this movie copare to his other movies. there a scene where he;s buck naked.

City on Fire is not like any of Chow Yun-Fat's other movies in that it contains less gun play and less violence.  But one thing that is intact is the great story.  This is one of the best undercover cop stories there are and no American film company could do it better, they could only copy it like Tarantino.  As said before, Yun-Fat is an undercover cop who must bust thieves who are going to pull a big job.  One of the thieves is Danny Lee from the Chow Yun-Fat movie ""The Killer.""

972691,3,6305161550,"As far as Chow Yun Fat vehicles this movie was an average and forgetable fare.  In fact I was 1/4 of the way through the movie before I realized that I had already seen it a year ago.  The basic premise is Chow Yun Fat is a deep undercover agent who is trying to get out.  Not exactly the most original premise.  If you want to see true angst of an undercover cop watch Hard Boiled and Tony Leung's performance is fantastic.  Its not that Chow Yun Fat did a poor job, it's just the material he had to work with was sub par. Yes I know the movie was the REAL Reservoir Dogs so it might seem blasphemous disagreeing with most of the reviewers.
As you would expect Chow's character ends up almost more sympathetic to his criminal partner than his job.  Although the story does a good job of making you feel his ambivalnce to the police, you never get a strong feeling on why he should feel so close to Danny Lee's character.  It is only near the end that there is any true connection between the two.  And I felt somewhat betrayed that Chow Yun Fat would still be so loyal to his partner after watching him blow away two cops.
It is only toward the ending of the movie that you truly feel the pull between the two characters and the ending almost makes up for the rest of the movie.  The fight scenes are forgettable and as everyone pointed out the subtitles are ridiculous.  I'm sure if I understood Cantonese the movie would have flowed better.  If a friend has it or you can rent it go ahead but the journey until the payoff at the end leaves me still feeling it is overrated and not worth buying at full price.",995414400,,1611,4.214983713355049

Having now seen both movies, I can't believe that anyone would even think of drawing a connection between the two. It's like how George Lucas got the idea for Star Wars from Hidden Fortress. Yes, the inspiration is there, and if you squint real hard, you can see similarities, but since film has been inspiring film since the beginning of film, we can safely say that City on Fire is a fairly typical Hong Kong noir and Reservoir Dogs is quintessentially Tarantino i.e., highly influenced by Chinese film and very unique storytelling.

Movie Review: City On Fire is an excellent cops and robbers movie filled with bloody violence with a really well told story of friendship and betrayal. Gee! Where have I heard that before? SHEEESH! Though this kind of storytelling is very common in China (if not the world), this one executes very well with complexity, dramatization, great direction from Ringo Starr.... uh I mean LAM, and the bloody action was happy fun.
