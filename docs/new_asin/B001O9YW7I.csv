8330000,2,B001O9YW7I,I did receive this movie earlier than the expected date. Very disappointed in the movie itself. It was very poorly filmed and the front of the cover does not even look like any part of the movie.,1381795200,,195,4.297297297297297
8330001,2,B001O9YW7I,"This was NOT what I expected. I was looking for a somewhat tame but still erotic skinnydip adventure - not 40 year old, run-of-the-mill gay porn!

The original 8mm film (with very amateurish dialogue dubbed after filming) probably dates from the mid 1960s to the early 1970s as the draft lottery for the Vietnam War is a major plot device. The period musical ""soundtrack"" will make you either giggle or cringe. Be warned that this ""movie"" has LITTLE if anything to do with frolicking in lakes, creeks, pools, hot tubs or the ocean surf.

I suppose that there is some historical importance here but I can assure you that there are 1960s-70s gay sex movies out there that are just as historically important (if not more so) and which have much better production values (though none of them are going to be great in that regard).

It is what it is. Or, at least, it is what it was: fairly forgettable.",1250121600,,898,4.565217391304348
