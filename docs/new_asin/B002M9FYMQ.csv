8373671,4,B002M9FYMQ,"Stragglers begins showing a young man pushing an African American around in a wheelchair in the woods when another man with a shotgun appears and points his gun at the two.  He says these noises are distracting him.  The man with the shotgun walks into the woods and sees a head lying on the ground as these weird sound effects play.  The wheelchair pusher hears voices and follows them, leaving the guy in the wheelchair behind.  When he returns to the black guy in the wheelchair he asks who he is.  Someone comes by and slaps the wheelchair pusher around, skinning his body alive behind a tree.  The black guy tries to crawl away since he can't use his legs but something munches on his leg.

We now see a separate white and black guy talking about the scientists they're going to visit during a truck ride.  The black guy recommends to just do what the scientists say and don't ask any questions.  The subject comes up of the white guy raping a little girl.  He thinks the black guy in the passengers seat is accusing him of the rape so he gets defensive.  In the science lab a man overlooks a scientist reading a report over a missing man.  A woman scientist introduces herself as part of a small funded research team.

She says they've come across a problem they need to investigate immediately and the job of the other two is to protect the scientists from any elements that might cross their paths and to ask as few questions as possible.  The scientist lady and her team investigate a home.  They see lady bugs crawling across the carpet.  She says she had a dream she was sitting in this very room, and someone was sitting in the chair when she felt a presence.

Outside the one scientist sees a young female teen lying dead on the cold snowy ground.  A scientist in the house determines a tape has been erased.  In the woods the science team sees the body of a young man covered in blood.  He's alive somehow.  His name is Mark.  The scientists take the man in the house and ask him his name.  He doesn't remember his name or anything else.  The scientist lady touches his forehead and says he was in a cave.  She says she has psychic abilities.  The man says we have to do something before it gets dark, or something will come out and kill them all.  The scientist lady says she wants to try hypnosis on the guy.

During hypnosis Mark remembers something.  It's dark, he's standing outside on the porch and there's someone in the woods.  It's... her.  He remembers drinking with his friends in the kitchen and saying to his friend ""There's somebody out there"".  He says he doesn't remember his friend's name.  The friend replies ""That's fine I don't remember it either"", lol.  He sees a paper that says his name is Drake.  Drake says he was outside to keep an eye on something and to keep an eye on a high strung angry guy in the house.

Mark meets up with the angry guy.  He wants Mark to leave him alone.  He says he's trying to secure the back yard by waiting around in the living room with a gun, and all Mark's doing is distracting him.  Mark recommends watching the backyard while he sleeps.  The angry man begins to have flashbacks of his girlfriend filming him by a river before they head into a cave.  She says a lady bug bit her but the angry guy says lady bugs don't bite.  He snaps out of his flashback and tells Mark to get out.  He continues waiting for a man named Kane to walk up the yard and says he can't wait much longer.

Mark talks to his female friend Valerie and asks how long they've been here.  She says 3 days, and that another one of their friends seems to remember more than the rest of the group concerning why they're here.  They hear a weird scream outside.  Valerie says she can hardly move or breathe.  Mark says ""They'll be here soon won't they, and when they get here what do you think is going to happen?""

The scientist lady wants to continue the case.  Mark has a dream that he's talking to Valerie in the woods and asks ""What happened to you?""  She says ""The same thing that happened to you and there's nothing you can do about it"".  Mark leaves his bed and talks to another young man who can't remember his name.  He then hears sounds and voices outside.  The man says to Mark when they get here... but can't finish his thoughts.  One guy tries to leave through the front door but he falls down and grabs his head the moment he steps outside.  He drops to the ground overwhelmed by the sound of electricity.  Inside the home the group asks each other who they are.  The one guy disrespects the female scientist by saying he wants to rip her panties off.

The male scientist says this man is disrupting their investigation.  All he's doing is adding more pressure to an already unbearable situation.  I think this is the same man sent to the science lab to protect the lady and male scientist.  Valerie says they're all trapped here and that she should've entered the cave when she had the chance.  The group insists they're trapped here.  The one guy wants to know what's going on and demands the angry guy tell him what's going on right now.  He rejects and starts to punch Mark.  The angry says he wants everyone to die because he's sick of all their questions.  Valerie questions if maybe he's the one behind all this.

Valerie says Kane isn't coming back, but the angry man says he'll be back.  She insists they have to stop relying on Kane because he's dead.  The angry man tells Mark that she needs to shut up or he'll break her nose.  Valerie recommends waiting for the angry guy to go to sleep and then they'll take his gun.  She pretends to care about the angry guy as a way to make him settle down.  She says she knows she's being so selfish and difficult and wants to help the angry guy.  The angry guy apologizes and says ""There's just so much pressure!""  Mark drinks a glass of wine.

The angry guy drinks some wine and says he's tired.  Mark and Valerie want to keep watch for Kane while the angry guy takes a nap.  They get through to the angry guy so he's able to calm down enough to take a nap.  Valerie puts sleeping pills in the angry guy's tea.  Mark tries talking her out of it.  She hands the angry guy his tea but he's antsy.  He thinks she's trying to take his gun and complains the tea bag is still in the cup.  ""How is this supposed to help me get some sleep?"" says the angry guy.  She says ""Ever heard of caffeinated?""  The male scientist appears in the room and says ""They're trying to stop me from investigating!""

Valerie recommends that Mark walk into the angry guy's room and take his gun.  When he does Valerie manages to grab the gun instead.  She points the gun at the angry guy's face.  He grabs it away from her outside as she says the angry guy's holding them all prisoner.  Just then something drags Valerie away from the front porch.  Mark tries to go after her but the angry guy says ""What are you doing?  You won't even remember her come tomorrow!""  Sure enough come the next day Mark doesn't remember the girl, and neither does the other friend.  The angry guy remembers though!  Perhaps a storyline flaw there.  Well then again no.  Given what we find out later on... no flaw!

The angry guy talks in his tape recorder to someone and says ""I know you're going to come back to us.  Our food's running out and we don't have much time left"".  Just then Mark steps on the angry guy's foot.  This makes him angry and he screams ""Do you think you're better than me!"",  ""You're fighting among yourselves, do you understand that!"" and ""I'm only trying to help you!""

The scientist apologizes for saying he wants to rip off the female scientist's panties.  Mark and his friend say they're already dead, but his friend says ""Mark, we're not dead!""  Mark says he saw the angry guy talking into a miniature tape recorder.  Just then they hear odd sounds in the woods.  Mark sees Valerie in the woods and asks ""Do you remember me dying?""  The angry voice continues talking on his tape recorder.  He says yesterday he had his doubts and lost his faith.  The one friend asks who Kane is, and the angry guy says he's the only one capable of fighting the predators out there.  The angry guy insists he'll be back.  They tell the angry guy that Valerie is outside waiting for him.

When the angry guy walks outside he doesn't see Valerie.  Just then he grabs his head, falls on the floor and says ""I'm coming back Kane!"" and ""Where are you Kane!""  The scientists discuss their case.  The one says to the female scientist ""So when you touched him (using your psychic abilities) you saw a cave?""  Meanwhile the angry guy continues to cry and call out his devotion to this Kane person.

The one guy says he's going to leave out the front door but he's in a wheelchair.  The angry guy says ""Go ahead and leave, but you'll be dead just like Valerie and the others"".  He continues ""Kane will be back for us!""  But the guy says ""He probably doesn't exist"".  The friend figures out that Kane isn't real.  He was put into the angry guy's head for the purpose of keeping this group of people trapped in the house.  The angry guy says he'll shoot the guy in a wheelchair if he tries to leave.  He says ""Go ahead and do it!""  They all fight and it spills outside where they hear weird voices.  After this someone from the group is dragged away.  The one guy gets frustrated and this scene is hilarious because it looks so cheesy the way we see into his mind as he thinks (with poor acting and cheesy snow/static in the background)"" ""What am I going to do!"" ""How do I get out of here!""  Then again there's probably not a better way to show what it's like seeing inside someone's mind.

Mark hears voices and turns around to see Valerie.  He gets a flashback of Valerie and another friend crying in fear when their one friend is shot and lying on the floor.  They try to leave but find themselves rolling around on the carpet overwhelmed by a screeching sound.  The friends then ask ""Who am I?""  Outside Valerie reappears and says it's impossible to stop the monsters.  She says it's impossible to fight them and that she's only talking to Mark right now because they're letting her.  They love toying with people and they enjoy it.  They give people bits of information- people might know some but not all of it.

Just then the angry guy shoots Valerie in the back and says ""She's one of them"".  I think Mark gets shot too.  He then beats on the angry guy, overtakes his gun and punches his nose.  Mark asks the angry guy about his security badge.  It has his full name and... it says his name is Kane.  This means the whole time the angry guy's been waiting for himself!  The angry guy insists he's not one of them.  Just then the angry guy has a flashback of the lady bug biting a girl while the one male scientist (or scientist protector) accompanies her.  We saw this scene earlier.  They then hear strange voices and wonder what it is.  Just then the angry guy shoots them.

A monster comes by and slashes the male scientist in the forehead after he's shot.  Mark continues to demand ""Why is there a security badge with your name on it!""  We see all kinds of camera flickering right after this.  A couple men talk to someone who's lying on the ground and demand he get up and go inside.  The guy sits up and says his cell phone's working.  He then hears voices that encourage him to call his friend Michelle about pictures for his portfolio.  Back in present time Mark asks the angry guy if he's responsible for this.  He cries and says to Mark he doesn't want to go back there.

The female scientist says the angry guy was able to withstand the influence much longer than the others infected.  They split the angry guy in half psychologically- one half they could control the other he resisted.  We see a slow motion effect of a woman crying.  The female scientist uses her psychic abilities to determine the angry guy is a rapist and a killer.  She says ""Pretty soon nothing will matter anymore"".

We see Mark guiding the angry guy outside in the woods when suddenly Valerie appears and touches the angry guy's face gently before kicking him where it hurts the most.  Attention all guys- you know what spot that is!  The angry guy cries on the ground that Valerie ripped his guts out.  He's covered in blood and tells Mark that he has to warn people about the evil here, and to run and never stop.

Back at the hypnosis session, the female scientist touches Mark's forehead screaming ""Show me Mark!  You cannot hide this from me!""  Suddenly she says ""It's working!""  The picture's so dark it's hard to tell what it is that's working.  The female scientist continues to touch Mark's head as he now screams ""They're chasing me!""  Wow, these flashbacks move at lightning speed!  Mark says he used to call them the stragglers.  They tease people with the possibility of escape even though there is none, and they're unstoppable too.  There's no answers, but the stragglers marks the beginning of the end of the human species.

The female scientist concludes that the wound on the angry guy's head was covered in a rag so the transformation by the stragglers couldn't take place.  The angry guy insists that Mark needs to shoot him before it's complete.  He does.  The female scientist tells Mark not to ask questions after he wakes up from his hypnosis, but he says ""I'm going to ask questions and continue to ask questions until I know what's going on!""

The male scientist says once the angry guy got that wound on his head the lady bugs entered his mind but it wasn't intentional.  The male scientist says while in their lab they created a plant whose pollen, when in contact with the air, will cleanse it.  But they could only create this plant artificially.  The male scientist began to experiment on different insects to see if they could create one that could generate the same pollen.  But they were unsuccessful.  The combination of chemicals and other ingredients resulted in a new species.  They never intended to create a new race of monsters.  At first the lady bugs were harmless.  They were planted in a cave and a research was set up to monitor their activities.  Mark asks why the two scientists came out here by themselves.  Mark says the stragglers used mind control to bring them out here.  He says it's too late but to die.

The one black guy we saw earlier in the truck finally makes another appearance.  He says we're trapped here in the house and we're as good as dead.  ""This is not fair.  I'm not supposed to be here!""  He then envisions getting angry and strangling his girlfriend.  The female scientist uses her psychic abilities to realize he raped and murdered that girl.  He begins to smack the male scientist around after he calls him a rapist and murderer.  The black guy threatens to rip off the female scientist's panties.  Wow, how many times is THIS line going to come up, haha.  Leave those panties alone!  He then throws the female scientist onto a bed and says he's going to rape her.  He says ""You said I deserve to be stuck here and die but you deserve to die.  You screwed with nature and this is nature's way of striking back!""  Nice line!  Another scientist shoots the black guy and kills him.

When the female scientist walks into a dark room the ghosts of those who died because of her lady bug experiments appear.  Even the male scientist who just died a moment ago comes back as a ghost.  He tells the female scientist she's been infected for 2 weeks now hence the bandage around her stomach.  He says ""You can't stop us and in a few minutes you won't remember anything"".  During a flashback the other scientist talks on his miniature tape recorder and says he has to make a run for it.  The female scientist says he's not going anywhere because she refuses to let him ruin her experiments.  He says ""Your experiments will kill everything!"" and she says ""Good.  It really couldn't have worked out any better if I had planned it"".  She says she'll just sit back and enjoy his demise.  She says ""We were meant to die, and they (the straggler creations) were meant to be here"".  We hear screaming in the tape recorder and then we see a new set of characters hiking in the woods.  They hear voices and... they too will become victims of the stragglers!

You know I like this movie, but it has a couple big problems.  One is that clearly defining what the stragglers are is quite the challenge.  Are they monsters in the woods?  A supersized ladybug?  A demon?  An invisible monster?  It's hinted that it lurks in the woods, messes up people's thoughts so they can't remember anything the next day, makes people turn on each other to create utter chaos but... what *is* a straggler exactly?

Also, from a storyline point of view, this movie moves WAY too fast.  It's quite hard to keep up with the pace.  Just expect these characters to turn on each other the entire time.  Well expect tension and finger pointing at first, then the turning.  Otherwise the characters are memorable, the horror elements are pretty strong with the mystery that something is lurking in the woods, the voices we hear adds a small but *extremely* good touch to the chilling horror, and the movie's pretty great overall.  Just make sure you're wide awake for this one or you'll get lost!  At least the writing is decent enough that whenever it seems we're about to be completely lost, an explanation is right around the corner.  Granted not an easy explanation, but enough to lessen the confusion and strengthen the story.  It all makes sense by the end at least, which is great.",1501718400,,17569,4.4296899467585344
