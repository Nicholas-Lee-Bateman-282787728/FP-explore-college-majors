1846437,4,B00008G8WI,"This is the only film in which Key Luke, who is best known as Charlie Chan's number one son, plays a lead role.
It is a fun example of the genre and combines humor with mystery.",1367193600,2,177,3.9444444444444446
1846438,5,B00008G8WI,"Entertaining oldie mystery. Quality of picture/audio good. Always enjoy Keye Luke as a character actor. He was great in the Charlie Chan series as well if you like this type of detective ""who dun-its"".",1362528000,3,201,4.9411764705882355
1846439,3,B00008G8WI,"Six films featuring the character James Lee Wong were produced between 1938 and 1940.  In the first five films, Wong, a detective, was played by Boris Karloff (1887-1969), who was not Chinese.  However in the final entry in the series, Phantom of Chinatown (1940), Keye Luke (1904-1991) assumed the role.  Luke was well known for playing Lee Chan, the son of the famous detective Charlie Chan in a number of films, and he brings to the role of Wong, an authentic ethnicity, and youthful enthusiasm that was absent with Karloff.

Doctor Benton, a famous archeologist has just returned from an expedition to Mongolia.  While there, Benton had discovered an ancient scroll, is just about to report his findings at a conference at a university, when he passes out.  Benton later dies, the victim of poison.  Police Captain Street (Grant Withers) takes charge of investigating the murder, and discovers that the scroll is missing.  Wong, a friend of Benton's daughter Louise (Virginia Carpenter), works with Street, and Benton's secretary Win Len (Lotus Long), to try and solve the murder, and recover the scroll.

Keeping you guessing until the end, Phantom of Chinatown is a fairly enjoyable watch for fans of mysteries from this era.  At a time when Caucasian actors typically played Asian characters like Mr. Moto, and Charlie Chan, this movie is notable because Keye Luke who is actually Asian, is featured in the lead role.  Luke's portrayal of Wong is more stylish, and refreshingly mostly free of ethnic stereotypes.  Also interesting is that Wong meets Captain Street, a reoccurring character in the previous films, for the first time, and this was the fourth appearance in a Detective Wong movie for actress Win Lin.",1344729600,2,1721,5.02112676056338
1846440,4,B00008G8WI,"Not only has Keye Luke played the number one son Lee in the Chinese detective films of Charlie Chan, but he also starred as a detective himself - James Lee Wong!  The Wong series was taken over by Boris Karloff as the Chinese detective in later years (for some weird reason!), yet Keye was the first.

In this story, an archeological expedition discovers an ancient Chinese tomb that holds a secret that could be vital to the defense of China today.  The leader of the expedition suddenly dies while drinking water at a lecture.  All we know is that someone in the expedition did it.  But who?

This Wong film is not nearly as entertaining as the Chan films, despite the appearance of Keye Luke, who plays the lead role.  There is much in the ways of Chinese proverbs as a confused San Francisco detective (Grant Withers) tries to make sense of it all.

The murderer was not too hard to figure out, though the ""missing pilot"" who later turns up is still a bit of a plot hole.

The use of Chinese culture and language was tastefully done, except for a few ""me no do that"" kind of talk every once in awhile.  Also I did not know there was a separate Chinatown Phone Exchange in San Francisco in those days!

Also starring Lotus Long, an Asian actress who had a few roles in those days.

Recommended.

Movies of this type make me feel wonderful and this one in particular did a great job in doing that.  I didn't think anyone could be Mr. Wong besides Boris Karloff, but, being a Keye Luke fan, I certainly thought I should give him a try.  He did not disappoint.  The only disappointment is that popularity of the films declined with the departure of Karloff and Luke only starred in one film.  Luke was a wonderful, and grossly underrated, actor.

Keye Luke, as usual did a good job. But I think this was the first and last time, for him to prortray this role.
Think of those Charlie Chan movies, as this is in the same genre, but not so racist as some black Characters were portrayed in the Chan movies.
This was probably a B Movie back in the 1940's, It's in B&W but the copy here is fine. It's a fun watch if you enjoy old movies. It only runs over an hour or so.",1462406400,2,584,4.0
