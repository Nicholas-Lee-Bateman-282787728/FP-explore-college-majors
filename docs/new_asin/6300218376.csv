7806750,5,6300218376,"What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said many times behind its back? It is one of the funniest films in existence. Thirty years later, you will watch in amazement. You might even experience an existential crisis. If this is your first time, it is advised you bring an experienced viewer along as your trip guide. It is an awesome strange thirty minutes for most, certainly for the novice viewer. After my first glimpse, I didn't return to normal for two entire days. To be honest, I've never been quite the same.

For eons, it has been my habit of periodically singing ""Antarctica"" (with gusto) and when people look at me askance, continuing to sing this most intricate and personal of tunes. Until one sees Sir William for themselves, there is simply no explanation. I've found no way of preparing any human being for this film, other than to say ""you may never see anything quite like this again in your life."" Thus far it is true.

William Dear can apparently be anyone at any moment, including Sir William Martin. But who is Sir William Martin, really? This is explained quite eloquently, through a series of what might be referred to as vignettes, or fugues. This film tells you a great deal about Michael Nesmith as well. This is collaborative brilliance, a one man show with Nesmith in cameo. Who knew he could buttle? Ah, but he is not the butler of your average wealthy recluse. Of course, one assumes wealth because Sir William has a very classy demeanor, especially when he spontaneously bursts into narrative coverage of the Dog Ball game and performs all segments of the commercial break. Like any true gentleman, he calls BS when he reads a telegram from Daddy regarding leaving the galaxy with his dog, Buster.

For the more sensitive among us, Sir William recites poetry. He does so with eloquence and a depth of feeling that few poets ever acquire. Trust me, just this once. You won't be disappointed.

It is impossible to imagine anyone who doesn't find this film hilarious. Well, OK. If you're someone so important that you cannot 'waste' 30 minutes watching 'silliness', you're already dead. Dead folks may grin, but they don't laugh. Every aspect of this film is well-warped genius. If you're fortunate, you'll find it in print and for sale and it is strongly advised that you do not miss the opportunity to purchase this film. At the very least, it will influence you to reconsider how you spend your time alone at home. Very highly recommended. Really. Highly.",1304467200,,2496,4.731034482758621
