8159561,2,B000KWZ7FQ,"Delta Force Commando is really bad. Plenty of shooting, with the Bad Guys killing  the Hero's wife in the first 5 minutes and, thereafter, not able to hit anything even though firing six million (it seems) rounds of ammunition every few minutes at the Good Guys. The good guys, it seems, kill five of the Bad Guys with each shot they shoot. However, when neither side is firing, the dialogue, acting and plot really make one immediately wish for more firing. The actors really are BAD, the dialogue is worse, and the plot, out of the trashcan of a minor  film company.
While better, the second film is hardly worth paying for the double feature.  If you really want to buy Stigma, there is a better collection than this which you can get.",1375228800,,738,4.533834586466165
