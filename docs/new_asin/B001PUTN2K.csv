8334732,5,B001PUTN2K,"I loved this episode of Nova, which shows how the state of California is trying to become less dependent on fossil fuels.  They've been building and using wind farms for many years, trying to get houses better insulated to lower heating and cooling costs, and encouraging electric cars.

This program dates from 2009, so it's not as up to date as I'd like.  And you can be sure that not everything will work, nor everything go smoothly.  But it is a step, many steps actually, in the right direction.  It's still early in the game, and this one looks like it's succeeded to some extent.  And we can always learn from failures, successes, and shades of gray in between.

I've watched it a couple of times and look forward to finding more such programs in the quest for renewable energy and conservation.",1458000000,,802,4.605633802816901
8334733,5,B001PUTN2K,"This NOVA show covers the wide range of energy and efficiency innovations being planned in California.  Similar to another show, NOVA's ""Power Surge"" there is a plan to bring down CO2 emissions 20% early, then 80% by mid-century.  The solutions include efficiency, building insulation, electric cars (the most important for this particular plan), renewables, and nuclear energy.

Whether one agrees or disagrees with this NOVA show, it delivers the high level of quality and scientific accuracy this PBS show has been known for.  Governor Schwarzenegger has retired from office, but his energy goals are still worth pursuing.  They are close to those of two Princeton University professors who came up with percentage CO2 reductions known as ""stabilization wedges"", described in the ""Power Surge"" episode.",1427155200,,805,5.459677419354839
8334734,4,B001PUTN2K,"There's a documentary narrated by Alec Baldwin that talks about Gov. Ahnuld like a dog.  It implied that he could do nothing right as an elected official.  This work, however, says Ahnuld is trying hard to get his state not to produce so much CO2.  It makes him look like a very visionary and solid leader.
I have trouble watching many environmental documentaries because they are too depressing.  When they imply that nothing can be done, then it begs the question of why anyone should watch the program.  This work, fortunately, did not go for doom-and-gloom alone.  It said CA must tackle green issues because all its forest fires are caused by doing nothing.  However, it also showed how CA as a state has plateaued on energy consumption, with the implication that other states are really the problem.
On the one hand, CA is always important as the nation's most populous state.  On the other hand, I do wonder if those of us in the other 49 should care about the discussion here.  The documentary notes that cars are a huge problem for this green crisis.  However, it makes clear not to say anything that would upset Detroit and the rest of Michigan, for example.  I saw a different documentary that said, ""Yeah, all this wind energy is great, but it can only be done in the barren West.  The East Coast could never impliment all these green tactics.""  This work fails to address that problem.
This was a strong documentary.  I'm surprised that I hadn't heard about it before.  I loved that the interviewees were a diverse group, probably a reflection of CA's demographics.  I also loved that one didn't have to be a science nerd to understand the conversation here.",1253404800,3,1671,4.671232876712328
