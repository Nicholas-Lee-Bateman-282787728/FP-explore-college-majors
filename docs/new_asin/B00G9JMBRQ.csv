8621495,5,B00G9JMBRQ,Another Good show great cast but people where probably watching something else and let this show get cancelled,1438732800,,110,5.166666666666667
8621496,1,B00G9JMBRQ,"This is an extremely feeble and desperate attempt even for Amazon. Really Amazon?! These discs don't cost that much! You used to sell the entire package at a way lower price and now you just decided to split the cancelled series in TWO just to make a profit? That's not only sad, it's an awful marketing strategy! Definitely going to be cancelling my Amazon account especially for this cheap marketing ploy. Melrose Place defined nighttime drama and gave a whole new meaning to ""Love thy neighbor"" in a scandalous way. If you want to watch the entire season and 2.0, you're looking to pay over $300.00 or MORE.",1437091200,11,610,4.657407407407407
