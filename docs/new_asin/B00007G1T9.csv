7975760,4,B00007G1T9,"I had ordered The Phantom Empire, Volume 1, and didn't notice it had changed to Volume 2 when I clicked on it. So ordered the wrong one. It wasn't at the vendor's end, but at Amazon's end.  I ordered Volume 1 again, to have a complete set. I've watched the series in the past and wanted a complete set, as I'd loaned it out. The young actress, Betsy Ross is my aunt, so I wanted to have a DVD, to update the VHS of this family treasure. We have enjoyed it.  It's a lot of fun. An old fashioned Saturday afternoon cliff hanger in 12 chapters.",1520035200,,541,4.09433962264151

7975764,4,B00007G1T9,"While this DVD collection is dated, so what? It is pure fun and that is the whole point. Gene Autry was beloved for a reason and that is shown in this Saturday serial. Even the occasional gliches on the print are charming as they show this is vintage fun. If you do purchase this dvd, It would best to also purchase Volume one otherwise the viewer will be lost as to what is going on with the story. IT does seem silly that there would be a vast and advanced civilization under the Radio Ranch and in Southern California of all places and that Autry made a fortune on real estate there. You would think he might have known something odd was occurring along with the U.S. Government since there was already fear that the Japs were becoming stronger and stronger as far back as when this serial was new.",1418860800,,801,4.346666666666667
7975765,5,B00007G1T9,this film is from a serial which i believe was shown in the movie theaters many years ago.  there is a total of 12 to 16 parts to it.  gene autry plays himself in this story about a civilization under autry's ranch.  autry has a contract to do a daily show or he will lose his ranch.  there are the usual bad guys who want to get control of the ranch to get to the underground civilization.  the story line is geared to a younger audience.,1374624000,,439,4.058139534883721

7975767,3,B00007G1T9,"I mistakenly purchased this DVD (PHANTOM EMPIRE: Part 2) thinking I'd get the entire serial, but all in all, this is a pretty fun viewing. Gene Autry falls into a subterranian city named Murania, and must fight to stay alive against the wicked queen that rules there. Very silly robots about in this story, with short-brimmed cowboy hats on top of their box-like features. A rebellion is being planned, as on the surface of the earth evil scientists plot to steal radium from the Radio Ranch. On top of all this, Radio Ranch is endangered by Gene Autry's inability to make it to perform on his radio show!
Complete with horse chases, sword fights, and deadly technology, this is a fun serial to watch. The print isn't great, but it is watchable and costs little for the entire collection. A very rare entry into the science fiction/western genre and a lot of fun!",1053561600,12,863,4.647058823529412
