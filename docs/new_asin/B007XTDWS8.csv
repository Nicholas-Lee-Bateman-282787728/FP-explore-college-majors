5114305,5,B007XTDWS8,"Films by Todd Browning have this unnatural feeling to them. He creates worlds filled with characters and situations that are on the verge of belief. Yet, with the outstanding skills of actors like Chaney, Lugosi, Barrymore and others, they become believable and overly enjoyable to watch. Browning's worlds are filled with vampires, freak show denizens, a ventriloquist jewel thief who disguises as an old woman operating a pet a shop, a midget thief who disguises as a baby, a gorilla kept as a pet in a cage. West of Zanzibar is no exception to Browning's collection of other worlds. In West, Chaney plays a cripple who travels to Africa and takes up with an imaginary tribe of cannibals with an unusual custom of burning alive the wife and daughters of deceased men, all to play out a 20 year plan of revenge. His scheme of revenge eventually turns on him in a highly predictable ending. I loved it, had a grin on my face throughout the entire film. This film is not to be missed by fans of Chaney, Browning or films of the bizarre. Browning was the Tim Burton of his time.

The film is not restored but it is likely the best that is out for this title.",1351468800,9,1156,4.504761904761905
5114306,4,B007XTDWS8,"""West of Zanzibar"" (1928) teamed two of the biggest stars of the silent era - director Tod Browning and actor Lon Chaney. It was based on a 1926 play called ""Kongo"".

Tod Browning (1880-1962) was one of the most unusual of all Hollywood directors, and that's saying a lot when you consider the list of characters includes ""Wild Bill"" Wellman, John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Alfred Hitchcock, etc.

Browning's peak was in the silent era, when he produced such classics as ""the Unholy Three"" (1925), ""London After Midnight"" (1927), and ""The Unknown"" (1927), but he is best known for the classic ""Dracula"" (1931) and for ""Freaks"" (1932). Browning was the first and truest of the American directors to adopt the German expressionist techniques and themes, and he embraced them to such an extent that he outdid the originals.

His films, especially the ones with Chaney, can be hard to watch, since they involve mutilated and deformed people, with themes involving revenge, sexual exploitation, murder, and mayhem. He often set his films in carnival shows (where he had once worked) and often employed carnival acts as part of the plot. Warning - this film is true to Chaney's heritage.

Lon Chaney (1883-1930) was one of the biggest stars of the silent era. Known as ""The man of 1000 faces"", he was capable of disguising himself completely in service of his roles, which could be as diverse as a hunchback (""Hunchback of Notre Dame""), a legless man (""The Penalty""), an armless man who throws knives with his feet (""The Unknown"") or a monster (""Phantom of the Opera""). He enjoyed crime stories and stories that involved circus performers, and he was famous for the 10 films he made with Tod Browning. His life was the subject of the 1957 film ""Man of 100 Faces"" starring James Cagney.

By 1928 when he made this film he had already made more than 100 films, and was at his peak. Fortunately he wears no makeup nor prosthetic devices in this one, so that we're able to see him act, and his acting is great.

In addition to Chaney, the film includes Lionel Barrymore as his rival, Warner Baxter as a drunken physician, and Mary Nolan as the daughter of the woman Chaney once loved.

The great Lionel Barrymore (1878-1954) plays a villain who steals Chaney's wife and leaves him crippled. Barrymore appeared in more than 200 films between 1908 and 1956, and was twice nominated for an Oscar, winning once (""A Free Soul"" ) in 1931 Though he's probably best known as the evil banker in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946) and from his recurring roles in the Dr. Kildare and the Dr. Gillespie films, he gave us many memorable performances -  as the innkeeper in ""Key Largo"" (1948), Thaddeus Stevens in ""Tennessee Johnson"" (1942), Grandpa in ""You Can't Take it With You"" (1938), and Billy Bones in ""Treasure Island"" (1934).

Handsome Warner Baxter (1889-1951) was a major star in the silent era and won an Oscar as the Cisco Kid in ""In Old Arizona"" (1929), although he is probably better known for ""The Great Gatsby"" (1926) that came out prior to the invention of the Oscars. He made a few good films - ""Prisoner of Shark Island"" (1936), ""Kidnapped"" (1938) - but by the end of the 30s his star had been eclipsed by actors such as Ronald Coleman, Errol Flynn, and Tyrone Power.

Cute Mary Nolan (1905-48) was a former Ziegfeld showgirl who made several silent films in the late 20s. This film was the highlight of her brief career.

The NY Times Mordaunt Hall called it ""grim, ingenious, but somewhat artificial"" and praised the acting. Fans of Chaney and Browning will thoroughly enjoy this film, but it isn't for the timid. The print and the sound track are remarkably well preserved, although there are some scenes that are missing (e.g., the move to Africa) which makes for some abrupt jumps. The film was a big success, earning more than 3 times its costs.
Coming as it does in 1928 the African scenes are completely politically incorrect.

Bottom line - a great silent film from 2 of the masters of the era. I've given this one a 4, but it's really better than that, and on a 10 point scale I'd give it a 9.",1344643200,5,4090,4.665277777777778
5114307,3,B007XTDWS8,"So I actually love this movie. Tod Browning is one of my favorite filmmakers. Everyone remembers ""Dracula"" and ""Freaks"" but his work with Lon Chaney, Sr. was just as special. ""The Unknown,"" ""The Unholy Three,"" and ""West of Zanzibar"" are some of my favorites. The picture is old and it's not cleaned up to look pristine, but it's still a pretty decent picture. The product is also DVD-R so it's exactly DVD, but it'll do. There are no special features or chapter selection options. Not even a booklet. I would rate the movie 5 stars, but the DVD itself just doesn't have what you want on it. I understand why though: this is still a rather forgotten movie and not many people care, but it's really a lot of fun. Chaney gives a great performance as a crazed paraplegic witchdoctor in Africa (he moved there to get revenge on Lionel Barrymore after he was injured following a magic act he was performing). It's interesting to see Chaney bound to a wheelchair while Barrymore walks around. I got so used to seeing him in a wheelchair from ""Key Largo"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life."" Great movie, sub-par DVD release, but fans of Chaney and Browning really ought to check it out if they haven't. It's great jungle melodrama fun from the silent era.",1338249600,11,1240,4.59009009009009
5114308,1,B007XTDWS8,"This has shown several times on TCM. It is a classic of outre cinema, and I highly recommend it. It is a real pity Warner is not releasing a real DVD of this film. A DVD-R has half the quality, and you can burn your own copy for virtually nothing and it will be just as good. Sad, really, how many great movies are suddenly being released (at high cost) in this degraded format. WB isn't the only offender, but it is the most aggressive at doing this.

As a cast bonus..this 1928 American silent movie also features actor Lionel Barrymore.  Nobody did creepy moody atmosphere and unsettling characters better than Browning and as always the chameleon Chaney transforms himself into another person for the role as a paralyzed magician seeking revenge and ultimately forgiveness.

8522997,4,B007XTDWS8,"If you are wondering which version to purchase, I have both and definitely recommend the Warner version.  I bought the Nose-Silo edition (blue cover) first, as it was newer, claimed to be digitally enhanced, and was a little cheaper.  Big mistake.  The video is poor quality (blown up from 16mm?), and it is missing some parts of scenes present in the WB version.  The ""digital enhancement"" is just tinting and colored titles, and a few annoying minor effects that don't belong in a silent film.  Its soundtrack devolves into strange, reedy monotones and, more oddly, barnyard sounds that have nothing to do with the scenes.

The WB version is not as restored as some of their other Chaney titles, but is clear and good quality, and features the original soundtrack added to the movie.  It is not tinted, but is far superior to the other.  Both are DVD-R.",1454457600,9,855,4.72972972972973

I waited for years for its video release. I would wish that this masterpiece be restored as it deserves. Viva Chaney!  For me his best interpretation!

8523003,4,B007XTDWS8,"West of Zanzibar (1928) is missing some footage, but, unlike  the earlier The Road to Mandalay, it is in much more viewable state.  Enough of Zanzibar remains intact so as not to appear too fragmentary.  Originally tilted Kongo, West of Zanzibar is the most flagrant, delightfully vile of the Browning/Chaney Oedipal absurdities.

Chaney plays Phroso.  Phroso is married to Anna  (Jacqueline Gadsden) and together they work in a Limehouse music hall as a magic act (in the early scenes as the magician, the protean Chaney gives a remarkable, Chaplin-like performance).  Behind Phroso's back, Anna is carrying on an affair with Crane (Lionel Barrymore).  When Phroso and Crane inevitably fight over Anna, Phroso falls from a great height, forever crippling himself.  After a short time has passed, Phroso is told that his wife has returned to town, with a baby, and is in the local church.  The dead-legged Phroso zips down to the church via scooter and crawls into the tabernacle, only to find his wife, with crying babe in arms, collapsed in death, at the feet of a Madonna and child statue.  Phroso looks at the baby girl, then at the Madonna, and vows revenge on Crane and the infant.

Twenty years later, Phroso re-emerges as ""Dead Legs"": a witch doctor and trader, lording over a swamp in Africa, utilizing his cheap parlor tricks to keep the local cannibals in submission.  Dead Legs is under the care of the derelict, alcoholic Doc (Warner Baxter) and an assortment of unsavory characters.  Using the natives, Dead Legs steals ivory from his nemesis, Crane.  It's all part of a twenty year grand scheme for ultimate revenge.

Dead Legs summons Maisie (the beautiful, tragic, and short-lived Mary Nolan).  Maisie is the now grown infant, whom Phroso believes to be the child of Anna and Crane. During the past twenty years, Maisie was placed, by Phroso,  in the surroundings of a seedy bar in Zanzibar. Naturally, Maisie has become a tragic and loose alcoholic. In the original script, Maisie was placed in a brothel and  raised as a  debauched prostitute who contracts syphilis.  However, producer Irving Thalberg predictably insisted this be softened somewhat in the film, which only lowers the film's sleaze level from ten to about a nine and a half.

Dead Legs instructs the tribesmen to inform Crane that it is he, their master, who has been stealing the ivory.  Of course, this kind of grimy silent era melodrama insists on throwing a monkey wrench or two into the scheme, complications Browning delivers in spades.  Doc falls in love with Maisie and finds himself at odds with Dead Legs torturous treatment of the girl, who has recently sworn to kick the bottle.  Nolan excels in the scene in which her paralyzed father descends from his wheel chair, slithering towards her.  She is simultaneously petrified and optimistic, but Dead Legs drives her back to the brink of brandied insanity.  Enter Crane, who sadistically reveals to Dead Legs the terrible secret that Maisie is Phroso's daughter, not Crane's.

It's cornball, grotesque spectacle that Chaney and Browning treat as austere entertainment.  Crane is shot and killed by the natives.  It is tribal custom to burn alive a female relative of a dead male.  The natives had previously been told that Maisie was the daughter of Crane and they demand that the sacrificial custom be carried out.  Dead Legs must now make amends for his terrible mistake and hopes he has one last parlor trick up his sleeve to save his daughter and Doc.

As Dead Legs, Chaney delivers an amazing, masochistic, emotionally high-octane, and downright creepy performance.  He writhes his way through most of the film, contorting his body with gleeful abandon.  Chaney was a master of pantomime expression, learned from years of communicating with his deaf-mute parents.  Chaney communicated best with those who shared his penchant for what others consider macabre.  His wife had previously been married to a legless man and his preeminent director, Tod Browning, ran way from home to join the carnival, supposedly having had at least one affair with a freak.  In many of his films, Browning depicted men paralyzed from the waist down, and later, in Freaks (1932), utilized actual legless freaks.

The Road to Mandalay (1926) & West of Zanzibar (1928) represent the Tod Browning/Lon Chaney collaboration at the height of its nefarious, Oedipal zenith, brought to you, for your entertainment,  by Irving Thalberg.

Unfortunately,  The Road to Mandalay exists only in fragmented and disintegrated state, a mere 36 minutes of its original seven reels.  In this passionately pretentious film, which is not related to the Kipling poem, Chaney plays ""dead-eyed"" Singapore Joe (Chaney achieved the eye effect with egg white) who runs a Singapore brothel.  Joe's business associates are the black spiders of the Seven Seas:  the Admiral Herrington (Owen Moore) and English Charlie Wing (Kamiyama Sojin), the best knife-thrower in the Orient.  Joe's relationship with his partners is tense and, often, threatening.

Apparently, Joe's wife is long dead.  The two had a daughter, Rosemary (Lois Moran), who Joe left at a convent in Mandalay, under the care of his brother, Fr. James (Henry Walthall).  Joe, a repulsive sight, occasionally emerges from his sordid, underworld activities to visit Rosemary, who works in a bazaar.  Joe plans to clean up his act within two years, once he has enough money  to undergo plastic surgery and retire.  Joe wants to be a reborn man, so he can reunite with his daughter and rescue her from the confines of poverty. Rosemary, however, unaware that Joe is her father (a frequent Browning theme), is repulsed by dead eyed Joe, understandably mistaking his friendliness for sexual predation.  Fr. James  warns  Joe that waiting two years is too long.  Joe's insistence for patience only makes Fr. James skeptical that Joe can actually achieve or sustain the redemption necessary to give Rosemary a good life.

One day the Admiral walks into Rosemary's Bazaar and discovers love at first sight when meeting Rosemary.  Falling in love with his partner's daughter inspires the Admiral to instantaneously see the light and put his past behind him.  It is the Admiral, rather than Joe, who undergoes conversion.  After spying Rosemary preparing for her impending wedding, Joe discovers the truth.  He succumbs to an unsettling rivalry for his daughter and is furiously determined to put a stop to the union.  Joe  goes to Fr. James, insisting that the Admiral, like himself, is too defiled, too corrupt.  The priest tires to assure Joe that the Admiral's about face is genuine; he's been converted by love.  In a rage, Joe attempts to strangle his brother.  A reel or so is missing here and next we find out that, somehow, Joe has shanghaied the wedding, kidnapped the Admiral, and is bound for the seven seas.

Searching for her missing lover, Rosemary arrives at Joe's brothel, but she is lured upstairs by Charlie Wing.  Joe arrives in time to stop Charlie from having his way with Rosemary, but the Admiral also arrives and a knife fight ensues, during which Rosemary stabs her father.  Mortally wounded, Joe blocks Wing's way and urges the Admiral to take Rosemary away to the seraphic life.  Fr. James arrives in time to give Joe the last rites.

The Road to Mandalay is depraved, pop-Freudian,  silent melodrama at its ripest.  Fortunately, both Browning and Chaney approach this hodgepodge of silliness in dead earnest.  Chaney is simultaneously cocky, parental, disturbingly coarse, and leering, projecting pathos and machismo.  His Oedipal wailing, when his daughter tells Joe that she hates the mysterious father who has abandoned her, is classic.  Browning, as was typical, idiosyncratically mixes melodramatic hi-jinks with exotic locales and strong actors.  Unfortunately, The Road to Mandalay is in such dissipated state that it makes for burdensome, strained viewing.  The only known print is a 16 mm abridged version, which was discovered in France in the 1980s.  Even in its abridged state, The Road to Mandalay is intoxicating, outrageous  silent cinema melodrama, badly in need of restoration.

Together, Browning and Chaney  acted out of the darkest recesses of their psyche in the silent era's most manic productions, and they did it with authentic devotion.
