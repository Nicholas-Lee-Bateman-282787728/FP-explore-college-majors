8356109,5,B0028ERCWK,So happy to finally have access to this in the U.S. Minchin is brilliant and seeing him work through his process is truly inspirational.  It's no wonder that he is so successful today.  Rock'n Roll Nerd has heart & humor.,1413244800,,221,4.5
8356110,5,B0028ERCWK,Excellent engaging film. Minchin is a genius. Great little peak into the industry as well. I highly recommend this movie.,1390435200,2,121,5.1
8356111,5,B0028ERCWK,"I loved this documentary.  It is a beautifully made documentary about Tim Minchin's early days.  If you don't know who Tim Minchin is already, I wouldn't recommend this DVD for you.  It is mainly for die-hard fans of Tim Minchin (of which I am one!).

I love all of his works and this DVD puts that into a very real perspective of his life and the very human struggles that we have to go through in life and the belief in self required to pursue the dreams despite the odds.

This movie is Tim Minchin's invitation into his life and I am grateful to have been invited via this DVD.",1387756800,2,581,4.245454545454545
8356112,5,B0028ERCWK,"Tim Minchin is underrated in America and his acts can make many people uncomfortable, but his is ultimately FUNNY! Tim's way with words is sublime and his musical ability is unquestionable. He is smart and shines a light into dark corners with humor and bluntness.
We are lucky that Rhian Skirving saw the future and brought us Rock'n Roll Nerd.

YES...YES...YES THIS CAN BE VIEWED BY AMERICANS!!!!  View this on a computer using a program like VLC.",1380672000,5,449,4.818181818181818
8356113,5,B0028ERCWK,This is a fun look at Tim Minchin in his less famous days. I did have to play it on a region 2 DVD player.,1374796800,,106,3.28
8356114,4,B0028ERCWK,"If you already love Tim Minchin, you'll love this DVD.  If you're somewhat intrigued but on the fence about him, you may also end up loving him as a result of it.  If you don't like the guy, don't bother.  It doesn't show you much that's not obvious about show business, but it does give you insight into this entertainer.

Now that Tim's a star in the UK and Australia and becoming one in the U.S, (at least among Broadway fans and YouTube viewers), it's interesting to see the beginnings of his rise to fame.  He comes off as both a really nice guy and someone with quiet but fierce ambition -- two great qualities for show biz, I think.  The family moments with wife Sarah are really touching as well.  I think this DVD may become a valuable weapon in my arsenal as I try to convert friends and family members to my Tim Minchin fan religion.",1370390400,6,844,4.30379746835443
8356115,5,B0028ERCWK,"I love this dvd. It's hilarious and you really get to see a different side of Tim. The documentary has excellent footage of early concerts as well as more private moments at home. I also appreciated seeing the ""inside world"" of agents, promoters, and show reviews. All in all a great documentary for music fans and especially wonderful for Tim Minchin fans.",1335916800,4,357,4.774193548387097
8356116,5,B0028ERCWK,"How can I be the first person to review this particular Tim Minchin piece?  Really?  How have you not obtained a copy of every Tim Minchin disc every produced?  This man is a god...wait, never mind, Tim isn't imaginary, although he may have 10 foot slippery rod of justice.  You'd have to ask his wife about that though.  Seriously though, buy this DVD!",1287187200,17,353,4.5396825396825395
