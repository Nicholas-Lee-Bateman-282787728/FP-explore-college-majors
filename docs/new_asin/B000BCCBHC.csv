8366055,4,B000BCCBHC,"Yes, Sylvie is a great artist. A good singer, yes for sure, but her arrangements with large archestras and the spectacular shows make Sylvie very special. This DVD includes old masterpieces like Qu'est-ce qui fait pleurer les blondes a.o and in total this is a very good DVD.",1135555200,2,275,4.75
