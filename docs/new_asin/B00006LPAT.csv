7971899,4,B00006LPAT,but that isn't saying its not good. It is good and i like this DVD. Just that Episodes 6 and 7 i don't like that much. Episode 6 confuses me very much and I have seen every Gundam episode and I don't get it. Episode 7 i just don't like for some reason. To me it doesnt make much sense at all. Though Episodes 5 and 8 pick up the slack. 2 Argo episodes and Argo is my 2nd favorite character next to Domon so it more than makes this DVD worth buying.,1049155200,3,448,3.827956989247312
