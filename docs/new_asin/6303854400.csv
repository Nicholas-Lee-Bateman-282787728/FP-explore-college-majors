732473,4,6303854400,"Update, 31 July 2017: My review is of the 1939 Universal serial ""The Oregon Trail.""  As of this writing Amazon has not only the reviews mixed up, but also the serial listed as an ""Additional DVD Edition"" for a much later documentary under ASIN: B00478IT8Q.  The correct ""Additional DVD"" for that documentary is found under ASIN: 1883691079, where the reviews are not mixed with those for the serial.

""The Oregon Trail"" is a 15-chapter Universal serial directed by Ford Beebe and Saul A. Goodkind, released in 1939.

Famous scout Jeff Scott (Johnny Mack Brown) and his sidekick Deadwood (Fuzzy Knight) are undercover agents for the Government, trying to determine who is behind attacks on settlers bound for Oregon.  They join up with a wagon train headed by John Mason (Edward LeSaint) whose wagon boss, Bull Bragg (Jack C. Smith) is an underling of the main culprit, Sam Morgan (James Blaine).  Morgan wants to keep settlers out of his territory so they don't disrupt his stranglehold on fur trade with the Indians.  Bragg is quickly exposed, but isn't captured, and with Morgan's other main henchman, Breed (Charles Stevens) continues to disrupt Mason's efforts to get his wagons through to Paradise Valley.

This is a typical Universal western serial, which means lots of repetition, silent-era stock-footage Indians, cattle stampedes, and brush fires.  There is a female, Mason's daughter Margaret (Louise Stanley) and a kid, Jimmie Clark (Bill Cody Jr.) that occasionally need rescue.  The repetitive plot seems to have been desirable when these serials were first released; the kids in the audience were there for their weekly ""fix"" of Cowboys & Indians, and the associated features tended to do the same thing.  Watched today for the ""full story"" it seems awfully slow-moving, but two things help redeem the serial: Fuzzy Knight's role as a useful comic-relief character, and that the hero can't just shoot Bull Bragg, who must be kept alive to expose the Big Boss.  It's also interesting to have Roy Barcroft as Colonel Custer, occasionally coming to the rescue of the good guys.  Barcroft's splendid delivery of lines is clearly evident here.  Of the main bad guys, Charles Stevens as Breed is fine in a role familiar from other Universal serials.  James Blaine as the chief villain doesn't seem quite nasty enough, and Jack C. Smith as Bragg comes across as just another thug, though he isn't supposed to be anything else, and not too bright, either.  And there are characters with bad-guy names Dirk, Slade and Dagget, played by Colin Kenny, Charles King, and Forrest Taylor, respectively.

VCI's edition, # 8439 on two DVD's, is from a print headed ""Commonwealth Pictures Presents"" and while likely a 16mm reduction most chapters are fairly sharp, with good gray scale.  The scrolling chapter ""Foreword"" usually becomes hard to read due to lack of resolution in the middle of the text as it shrinks toward the top of the screen.  Small details like the MPPDA certificate numbers are not easy to read, but it is possible to tell the same number is used for the first three chapters, though many of the later ones are correct.  The image is a little oversize, not a major problem but noticed especially in the ""next week"" titles, and there are a number of isolated long scratches, not too severe and mostly at the beginnings of the chapters.  By 1939 Universal was doing a good job of simulating ""night"" and these scenes show plenty of detail, if some graininess not noticed in the brighter parts, probably from the reduction print.  The sound has quite a bit of distortion in the title music of some chapters, though it cleans up during the main action and never causes problems with the dialogue.  So while there are some flaws, it is quite watchable, much of it looking very good, and clear enough to show where the grainy stock footage is used.

Extra's include a ""serial poster gallery"" with eight posters, in color, for serials made from 1933 to 1950.  There are ""Bio's"" of Johnny Mack Brown, Louise Stanley, Fuzzy Knight and Ford I. Beebe, and four serial movie trailers, for ""The Oregon Trail,"" ""Winners of the West,"" ""Tim Tyler's Luck"" and ""Adventures of Red Ryder.""

VCI's old VHS edition, #1756, is also from a print distributed by Commonwealth Pictures.  The image isn't as sharp as the DVD, though the sound is at least as good.  One interesting difference is the Chapter Five title, in the ""next week"" notice at the end of Chapter Four.  The DVD has ""Stampede!"" while the VHS has ""The Threatening Herd"" matching the title shown in the trailer.  The VHS image is shorter in the vertical dimension than seen in the DVD, allowing more of the top and bottom of those ""next week"" titles to be seen, and the actors don't have such long faces.  It isn't clear which is closer to the aspect ratio of the original film, but the difference isn't great. The main problem with the VHS edition is the lack of quality control in the dubbing process.  The example I got was missing the last four chapters.

Recommended especially to fans of Johnny Mack Brown, VCI's DVD edition provides a good looking, clear if not razor-sharp image and fairly good sound.  Note that VCI's website, as of this 31 July 2017 update, shows this as being on DVD-R discs.  As with all serials it is best watched with at least a day between chapters, to give the stock-footage Indians a rest.",1323907200,,5380,4.817192600652883
732474,4,6303854400,"Johnny Mack Brown plays an unusually dapper fur trapper hired to investigate a series of attacks preventing wagon trains from reaching the Oregon territories.  He joins up with the most beleaguered wagon train in history, which spends several sequential episodes trying to get out of the same dusty town.  Whenever the train starts moving, it falls under attack by Indians or stampeding cattle or some other stock footage, which digital technology makes even easier to spot.

Don't try to watch more than one or two chapters at a time, because this serial bears the marks of the form.  Serials were a unique format completely beholden to the circumstances under which they were viewed.  There was no guarantee that viewers attended the theater the previous week, so every installment contains a certain amount of redundant footage.  Each chapter has opening credits, scrolling text describing the story thus far and usually about a minute of footage from the previous chapter, including the cliffhanger.  There are no obvious cheats, though there is often an added shot or two (such as Johnny jumping clear of a crashing wagon) that shows how the cliffhanger was resolved.  I have to knock off one star because of the disappointing ending and the fact that 15 chapters is simply to much for the story.

Johnny Mack Brown has a very physical method of fisticuffs that is a nice contrast to his easy-going acting style.  He's not the most charismatic cinema cowboy, but he's charming enough to anchor the creaky cast.  The strongest supporting character is Fuzzy Knight, who made dozens of films and serials with Brown.  His performance, while amusing, never degenerates to the point of simple comic relief.  You'll probably get a laugh out of how coyly the romantic elements are handled, chaste even by 1939 standards.  This serial is very similar to Flaming Frontiers, which is also available on DVD and is just as much fun.",1145232000,6,1924,4.971875

Under director's Ford Beebe and Cliff Smith, associate producer Henry MacRae, screenplay by George Plympton, Basil Dickey, Edmund Kelso and W.W. Watson , dialogue director Dorothy Cormack, musical director Charles Previn ...the cast includes Johnny Mack Brown (Jeff Scott), Louise Stanley (Margaret Mason), Fuzzy Knight (Deadwood Hawkins), Bill Cody Jr (Jimmie Clark), Edward LaSaint (John Mason), James Blaine (Sam Morgan), Charles Stevens ('Breed'), Roy Barcroft (Col.

George Custer, Barcroft's unmistakable smooth voice and his swager made him the perfect heavy in many a Rex Allen, Gene Autry, Johnny Mack Brown, Sunset Carson, Hopalong Cassidy, Eddie Dean, Wild Bill Elliott (Red Ryder), Rocky Lane and Dale Evans & Roy Rogers...the other actor is Charles King, who they called ""Blackie"" in just about every film, King worked in silent films when sound came in his career took off with many a B-Western hero Buster Crabbe, Buck Jones, Ken Maynard, Tim McCoy and little Bob Steele where his knockdown dragout fist fights with King became legend, you couldn't wait for that scene in the film to arrive and you were never disappointed.........meanwhile back to our Universal Serial which is always good till the last drop and this serial is no exception...there is a great deal of entertainment here for the cliffhanger fans out there...all courtesy of VCI Entertainment, who in my humble opinion is the best there is in restoring early serials and features.

Bobby J. Copeland's book on ""Johnny Mack Brown: Up Close & Personal"" is chuck full of answers to all the questions his fans had from early on...when you went to see him on the big screen, you got exactly what the marquee said...plenty of thrills, adventure and loaded with action...Johnny Mack was a natural for the western, his riding abilities and fight scenes were of the the same caliber as Buck Jones and Bob Steele...Johnny Mack sets the saddle better than Duke Wayne...seems Johnny got better with the more films he made and the scripts were always top notch...he was one of the best-liked people in films, what you saw on the screen is what he really was...a great human being.

It was recommended to me by my sister-in-law who said ""you will learn more about mules than you ever thought possible."" I skeptically thought, ""mules?"" She was right, but this book is so much more. Two brothers set out to recreate the Oregon Trail trip from beginning to end with equipment as authentic as possible. Ultimately I thought of this story in four parts: 1) the preparation and actual trip: 2) the history of people and places during all those Trail years; 3) the description of the three mule team and what was required to handle them; 4) and the relationship between the two brothers.

732830,3,6303854400,"This DVD, The Oregon Trail, is a documentary attempting to chronicle the movement of pioneers west, through the Rocky Mountains, to the Oregon country.

The DVD lays out the first white exploration of the Oregon country. In this, it illuminates the parts played by both the early fur traders and the Lewis & Clark expedition. From there, the richness of the land in the Oregon country - what we call the Pacific Northwest - lured thousands of easterners west through the prairie and through the passes of the Rockies.

I think the DVD brings out a lot of good information involving the migration of Americans to the Oregon country. We learn that these people were not poor immigrants, but middle-class farmers because only someone with significant resources could afford the equipment and supplies needed to get to Oregon. The DVD covered the various routes, the kinds of supplies and gear needed, and the comparison of oxen vs. mules or horses for pulling their wagons. The oxen were the best choice because they could subsist on the prairie grasses along the way.

There was much good in this DVD. Unfortunately, it seemed poorly made with the same video clip of the male re-enactor driving the wagon while the wife and child re-enactors walking behind the wagon literally over and over and over. I don't think there even was a musical score. The narration was simply adequate.

It's not a bad documentary...it just isn't good. It's just okay and I can only give this DVD three stars.",1396569600,18,1486,4.815686274509804
