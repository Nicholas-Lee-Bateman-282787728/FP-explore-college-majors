7554448,5,B018TAQSEE,"BUYER BEWARE: there is not a single bang in this box, much less the two promised in the title. When I buy a two bang box you better believe there better be two bangs in said box. After spending 18 straight hours combing through the contents of this DVD for a single trace of a bang, I decided to put the disc thingy in the put disc thingy in tv thingy and lo and behold, music, sound, and light came out. Don't know much about comedy (I'm a bangarangian, you fool, read the beginning of the review) but the people in the glow box seemed nice enough. Still no bangs. Refund awaited.",1452556800,12,581,4.196428571428571
