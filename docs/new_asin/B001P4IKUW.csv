8332094,5,B001P4IKUW,I used to use this at the end of a class I taught just to remind everyone that we're all human and we're all in this together.  Great little song and lots of wonderful facial photos of people all over the world.  I don't use it any longer because I had to switch to DVD.  I would have bought the DVD right now but it does not seem to exist.  To bad.  I guess the high price for this VHS is because it's rare.,1398211200,,408,3.8095238095238093
