8238858,5,B0010X5JCK,"First of all, I adore John McCormack!  I've been listening to his singing for years.  He's the first and best of all the Irish tenors, in my humble opinion.  This dvd is a wonderful glimpse of his life and career.  It's a shame it couldn't have been longer in scope, but what is presented to the viewer is worth having.  If you enjoy John McCormack's  singing like I do, then this dvd is for you.  Buy it while it is still available.",1428796800,,433,4.2073170731707314
8238859,5,B0010X5JCK,"I was so fascinated with this CD that I watched it twice in a row after receiving it.  Very well put together, flowed well, with lots of interesting interviews from family interspersed with equally interesting photos and narrative and, of course, that magnificent singing.  I came upon this rather by serendipity, having grabbed a Three Tenors recording by accident one day (instead of the intended Gregorian chant); this re-awakened an interest in fine tenor voices.  I knew only vaguely of John McC.  and thought he only did Irish songs, but went on-line to discover, to my delight, his fabulous operatic voice!  Though musically and aesthetically perfect, with total note control even through vibrato (something that many famed tenors cannot achieve today), his voice has an indescribable, intangible quality, something which I can only term ""character.""  This comes through so strongly even though recorded with technology far inferior to today's standards. When you can intuit an artist's life experiences, struggles and uniqueness through their work, well, that is truly art, and McCormack is a master of this medium.  I'm sure he's been teaching the angels to sing all these years!",1320364800,4,1188,5.253968253968254
8238860,3,B0010X5JCK,"When I was growing up and the Beatles just coming to prominence, my late father repeatedly tried to get me interested in my cultural heritage and specifically, the Irish tenor, John McCormack.  This hour-long tribute to McCormack's life and accomplishments provides information about his quick rise to fame and about the body of his work.  I was also impressed to hear of his many charitable works.  Very enjoyable.",1253232000,10,415,5.073529411764706
8238861,5,B0010X5JCK,"Anything where I can hear the voice of the great Irish tenor John McCormack gets five stars from me. Even with that bias, this was a highly informative biography that I've watched a couple of times. So for the price of a CD, you get an entire video documentary with lots and lots of beautiful singing.",1212278400,11,301,4.392857142857143
