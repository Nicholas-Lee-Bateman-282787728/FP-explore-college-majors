8633827,4,B000H2NHMO,"Christopher Roy's ""African Art in Performance: The Winiama Mask of the Village of Ouri, Burkina Faso"" entertains, informs and educates, and would therefore be a valuable addition to the media library of scholars and casual observers of African art. It highlights performance styles, masking materials and process and the significance of such performances among the Winiama. It draws upon Roy's over thirty-five years experience in the art and life of the Burkinabes, particularly in the discussion on changes in context and quality of carving as well as masked performances since the turn of the century. Occasional humorous gestures by some of the masquerades, on and off drumbeat, add to the entertainment value of this educational movie.",1243555200,,740,5.387931034482759
