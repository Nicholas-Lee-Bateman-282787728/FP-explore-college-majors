1920273,4,B0000D0YTY,"This movie is filled with honesty and magic.  Every character is authentic and immediately the viewer is drawn into their story.  The story is sensitively and artfully told by the director Mick Diener.
This is one those rare movies that shows the trials of the human existence, but then renews are faith in the human spirit.",1073692800,2,324,4.767857142857143
1920274,5,B0000D0YTY,"It's a funny, heart-warming, sexy, offbeat gem.  Some of the performances come off so natural you think perhaps they shot those scenes with a hidden camera. But then, forget hidden cameras - the director, Mick Diener, fills the frame with such sweeping vistas that it literally sweeps you off your feet - a director not unlike a Terence Mallick (Badlands) or a Jim Jarmush (Stranger Than Paradise) or a Marcel Camus (Black Orpheus). And the way these separate tales weave together, in and out, out and in - then, all of a sudden, seem to go every which way - and then, magically, they all come together so perfectly in the end; it's the stuff that movie magic is made of.  What's more, thanks to this little seaside Mexican village with all it's charm (and, yes, scorpions), it's like watching a travelogue that has some sting. In fact, it's such a real Mexico experience, as you watch the DVD you must remind yourself  that it's okay to drink the water.",1073520000,3,954,4.6
1920275,4,B0000D0YTY,"Just watching this DVD gives you feeling of getting down to a beautiful tropical place - the kind of trip we always want to take and do not always have the time (or $) to go on.
Better still the naturalistic style of both the direction and the acting help to disolve the boundary between viewer and film and instead you have the warm feeling of visiting with friends - people you know.
The film has laughs and soul - each character is working toward a better understanding of ""where"" they are in their lives and as opposed to many of the films of the day where there are no chraracters to care about - I found myself rooting for all of them.
A must watch on a cold winter's night!",1073433600,2,680,4.198473282442748
1920276,5,B0000D0YTY,"I saw this movie at a film festival in New York at the same time that My Big Fat Greek Wedding was out. I saw it right after Greek Wedding, and I found Which Way Por Favor to be much better. Which Way Por Favor features a strong script, superb acting, and the wonderful backdrop of a small Mexican beach town--great inspiration for anyone thinking about a Mexican getaway. It's about four American journeyers who find themselves drawn into the lives of the villagers in ways they never could have imagined. In the process, they find themselves and each other. It's funny, at times deeply moving, and sexy as hell. This film proves beyond a doubt that you don't need a big budget to make a great film. If you want to see a good movie and at the same time support independent filmmaking at its finest, pick this one up.",1069632000,3,817,4.417218543046357
1920277,5,B0000D0YTY,I'm so glad I found this movie on DVD.  I saw it at the San Franciso Film Festival and thought it was amazing.  I got to hear all the actors and filmmakers speak and was so impressed.  This movie is what independant filmmaking is all about.  They shot it on this impossibly small budget and it just turned out so cool.  It actually inspired me to go down to the little Mexican village it was filmed in on vacation.  Down there this film has a huge cult following.  It's great.  Buy it.,1068249600,4,485,4.195652173913044

7999600,5,B0000D0YTY,"Which Way Por Favor was shot in the tiny Mexican village where I lived, so this film holds a special place in my heart. The story is charming and the location is just stunning. They used many locals in the film, so it's really fun for me to watch my friends light up the screen. Whenever I'm missing my little village, I just pop in this DVD and I'm transported back to the jungle.",1437782400,,381,4.162162162162162
7999601,3,B0000D0YTY,"I must say that it is neither a 5-star nor a 1-star, for the other reviewers seem to have chosen a side.  It is, however, a solid 3-stars, if you go into it w/o expectations; you can add another half star if you have your significant other sitting next to you. It's a 'B' movie, no doubt; but, it isn't garbage.  The scenery is nice, the actors are generally likable, and their acting is at-best, or, at-worst, okay, depending if you are a glass have full or half empty kind of person.  Watch it on a slow night with your significant other while eating popcorn.  You won't feel like you wasted the night.

Rating:  I'm not really sure why it is rated R.",1328227200,,653,4.2682926829268295
7999602,3,B0000D0YTY,"was okay... I was in Yelapa
and wanted to see a little more
of the actual scenery...beautiful jungle!",1304121600,,101,4.666666666666667
7999603,1,B0000D0YTY,"This is one of the worst movies ever produced.
The actors (especially Alisa Conaboy) are pathetic,
to say the least. They've taken a magnificent
location and bastardized it in a worthless story
that ends in mutual defecation. That about sums
up the entire story - people defecating together,
like any roadside toilet.",1285459200,,317,5.115384615384615
7999604,5,B0000D0YTY,"This was a cute little movie. I really enjoyed the eclectic mix of characters and personalities. I have never laughed so hard as I did at the very last scene...and the maid's comment was priceless! If you like offbeat movies with great scenery and cool music then this is the flick for you. Crack open a Corona, sit back and just enjoy the Mexican vibe.",1175904000,,353,4.446153846153846
7999605,5,B0000D0YTY,"This is a sweet little movie.  Proof that a small budget film can be very big on heart and soul.  Great scenic footage of coastal Mexico and an appealing cast of eccentric young travelers who discover a few snakes in their tropical garden (so to speak).  What I liked most is the storyline: It's both accessible and and fun -- yet also daring enough to be intimate, funny and touching in unexpected ways.",1125964800,,404,4.506849315068493
7999606,4,B0000D0YTY,"As a longtime visitor to Yelapa, Mexico I'm probably a little biased, but I've watched with plenty of people who've never been there and everyone agrees this film is a real treat.  From the hilarious plot of a kid on a spritual journey to the stories of romance and family -- the movie charms in unexpected ways.  Then there's the beautiful way it captures the richness of the place -- everything from the pueblo to the beach to the dogs that live on the beach.  The guest spots by locals, including our friends Freddy Glumaz, Isabel Jordan and Philippo Lo Grande are an added bonus.",1115337600,,583,4.533333333333333
7999607,1,B0000D0YTY,"This was a terrible movie and makes me wonder about the review policy for amazon.com.  I find it hard to believe it could be rated at 4.5 stars.  I spent some time in Yelapa and loved it.  It is a beautiful village full of lovely people and amazing scenery.  I had no idea there was a Yelapa movie and was excited since the reviews noted, ""Characters played by many of the locals""  Phillipo lo Grande had a bit part as a swindler and a guy trying get it on with the main character's girlfriend.  It was sad because he is an extremely talented artist whose paintings are all over the world, yet that wasn't even mentioned.  The movie could have been good, but it was like any other trashy B movie, the plot revolved around an engaged girl who couldn't control having sex with anyone she met when drunk and another girl who was begging her dad for money the entire time.  In the end the couple pooped in front of each other, which I guess is supposed to be either romantic or funny, I thought it was sick.  How about some sunsets, or shedding some light on the local expat scene, or maybe the jungle, but none of those things are in this movie.  Waste of time!  Worst movie I have seen in years.",1113782400,4,1193,4.257777777777778
