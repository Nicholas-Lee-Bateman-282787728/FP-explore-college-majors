We don't like the amount of traffic that happens around that time, and you can easily get lost, since they close off some of the streets to let the processions go by.  So, it was very nice to just relax and watch the video and not have to worry about all that.  Mr. Rosendo is always a joy to watch.",1454544000,,387,4.202702702702703

8473517,5,B005HRTFZC,"I am a huge fan of Joseph Rosendo, having watched him on our local PBS station, and was moved in particular by this episode. I have a friend at the nursing home where my mother is, and wanted to share this travel location and Eastertide with her-it is both beautiful, with the flower carpets and floats, the many bands-it's just extra specially marvelous. I highly recommend all of his programs and DVDs, but this is an especially good one to start with.",1400544000,,454,4.548780487804878
