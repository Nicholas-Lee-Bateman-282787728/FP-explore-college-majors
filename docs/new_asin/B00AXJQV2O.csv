5526324,5,B00AXJQV2O,"A faith based Pastor / Evangelist who inspires us all to follow his example and Jesus Christ's teachings. A lesson to us all and to those who preach from comfortable pulpits and TV programs. Angus preaches where it is most needed to the people themselves. No racist demarcation. Just plain Bible truths and it is so refreshing to hear the Gospel in easy to understand language as God wanted it to be.

Angus, God's Blessings on you and your ministry.

5526344,5,B00AXJQV2O,"I was recently in Nashville at a Mighty Men's conference to see Angus speak. His claim of being a simple farmer from South Africa is extremely humble. He is truly a mighty man of God and the story of 3 ordinary men that are touched by his public display of faith is powerful, renewing, inspirational and moving.

5526350,5,B00AXJQV2O,"The quality of this movie is outstanding, the actors are quality, the script is quality, and the editing of the film is quality.  Especially if you compare it to typical Christian movies produced.  Most Christian movies to me are cheesy and leave me disappointed, not this movie.  You will not be disappointed.",1371168000,3,310,4.923076923076923
5526351,5,B00AXJQV2O,"Having already seen (and own) ""Faith Like Potatoes"" our family was really looking forward to seeing the follow-up movie, ""Ordinary People."" It was probably over a year since its initial release that it became available here in the U.S. When it finally became available we ordered it straight away. We were not disappointed!

It is such a wonderful blessing to see the power of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, fervently at work amongst brothers and sisters in a faraway country such as South Africa. Knowing the history and the present political and social atmosphere of South Africa simply brings this story to life even more vividly.

Sadly, I missed the Mighty Men's Conference in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, as I did not even know it was coming and only found out about it a couple of days after it had taken place. If and when Angus Buchan ever does come back to the U.S. I will be certain to go.

Back to the movie... this is a very good movie which wraps several very good stories into one movie, all which are very heartwarming and are very real as these are things which do happen to us every single day.

God bless you and your ministry, brother Angus Buchan!",1370217600,9,1168,4.600961538461538
