2432680,5,B000BOFRM6,"Baroque that rocks! is the title of a documentary film by Reiner E. Moritz that accompanies this Opus Arte DVD production of Jean-Philippe Rameau's (1683-1764) penultimate masterwork Les Paladins, inspired by a fable by La Fontaine. Described as a Comedie lyrique in three acts and composed in 1760 when Rameau was 77, it blended reality and the surreal even before director Jose Montalvo and choreographers Montalvo and Dominique Hervieu began their efforts to bring this Baroque masterpiece before a 21st Century audience. Watching this ingenious blend of 18th Century French Opera and ultramodern technology, dancing, multi-screen films and imaginative staging is like wandering through a wormhole in spacetime. All times between are bypassed and only those slivers of spacetime that correspond to 1760 and the present - the entrance and exit points through this artistic portal - are allowed to coexist. And coexist they do; modern dance, film and a plethora of strange activity reflect or comment upon what occurs on stage. One inhabits two worlds simultaneously and it takes some getting used to. Dancers utilize old school breakdancing, hip-hop, West Indian, African and urban street moves, all superbly choreographed by Ms. Hervieu. Multiple screens doubling as multiple stage doors present a profusion of films frequently incorporating stage performers so that they interact with their virtual selves and others; they are constantly morphing into animals, birds, butterflies and statuary of various shapes and sizes. Balloons float across the stage as props, a trampoline is utilized as an apt metaphor for love's flight. Castles and gardens appear and disappear as needed via film and image projections. And all this time, like a heart that refuses to falter, a magnificent Opera persists onstage and in the pit, sublimely played and gorgeously sung.

Words alone cannot describe the visual dimension of this wondrously realized production. However, the predominantly youthful singing and dancing stars of this Opera, filmed live in May 2004 at the Theatre du Chatelet Paris, are ultimately the real reason for its success. They are wonderful, providing talent and energy in abundance. The plot of Les Paladins revolves around love. The old Anselme loves (and imprisons) the young Argie who loves the young Atis. The various struggles to requite love (including a maid Nerine and a gaoler named Orcan) make up the bulk of the story. Thankfully, an illustrated synopsis on the first disc is quite helpful in explaining what's what. Handsome Topi Lehtipuu as Atis is marvelous with a beautiful lyric tenor voice, perfectly trained for Baroque Opera. His tone and diction are crystalline. He can act and he can dance, too. All of the cast are required to dance as well as act their roles. Beautiful Stephanie d'Oustrac plays Argie. Hers is a lyric soprano voice that matches her statuesque Gallic beauty. She spends most of the Opera wandering around in shorts and knee-stockings looking sexy and sad. Orcan is Laurent Naouri and Nerine is Sandrine Piau. All the singers and dancers (and there must be more than 60) are excellent.

William Christie is a master of the French Baroque. Conducting  his period instruments group Les Arts Florissants, he brings Rameau's deliberately shocking score to life. It is suggested that Rameau, at 77 years of age and with several successful Operas on his resume, wanted to create a splash following the notorious ""War of the Buffons"" that had roiled Parisian musical life the previous two years. He unleashes a fireworks display of musical ideas: every instrumental trick he knew (and he knew plenty), strange, abrupt meter changes, odd sounds and even extensive parodies of himself. His score is pristine and coarse by turns. Rhythmical in the extreme, Les Paladins is definitely unthinkable without extensive dancing. Debates about the nature of this production may be answered by the evidence provided by it's artistic success. It works.

This opera contains some nudity, most of it very discrete. Be forewarned if nudity is a problem. I am opposed to the gratuitous use of nudity but here it is integral to the plot and the larger design of the work. The film is in color and shot in 16/9 anamorphic widescreen. It is crystal clear. Sound is both LPCM stereo and 5.0 DTS Digital Surround (there is no separate subwoofer track). On higher-end A/V systems there is a significant difference between the two, with DTS providing greater presence, a larger illusion of space in the soundfield and a sense of ""liveness"" I have found in none of the other formats (including Dolby 5.1). Lower-end systems may not reveal much difference. The sound on this DVD enhances the ""live"" nature of the program. There are 2 discs and their playing time is 204 minutes. The region code is NTSC all regions. Menus are in English, French and German and there are the usual 5 subtitle languages. Extras include the Illustrated Synopsis, a Cast Gallery and the documentary ""Baroque that rocks!"". There is an excellent 36 page booklet in English, French and German that contains superb notes including the original story by La Fontaine.

This is a superb DVD and I strongly recommend it to open-minded lovers of Baroque Opera.

2432681,5,B000BOFRM6,"My two favorite amazon music reviewers, Mike Birman and Steven Guy, have already given this amazing performance their stamps of approval, so I'll be brief.
Imagine combining the Beatles' film Yellow Submarine, a big top show by Cirque de Soleil, and the most ravishing Baroque singing you've ever heard! Throw in some accomplished slapstick acting from the singers, if you can believe that! Give the role of Atis to a tenor who could displace Brad Pitt from the hearts of maidens everywhere. Smoothly blend ballet, modern, hip-hop, and African dance choreographies. That's what you'll get with this production of Rameau's Les Paladins. Unless you absolutely despise beautiful singing, witty acting, and imaginative multi-media staging, you must get this DVD as soon as your tax rebate comes.",1205452800,6,791,5.285714285714286

2432683,4,B000BOFRM6,"with a mix of video,ethnic catchy modern dance and a cast having visible fun, this is a true revelation of what can be done with 18th century music.it is full of spirit and wit;and not at all the french equivalent of the four seasons you know music you've heard way too often....Piau and Lehtipuu are wonderfull sprightly singers; forget the twists of the plot and savor the delicious music!",1178582400,6,391,4.681159420289855
2432684,5,B000BOFRM6,"Usually I dislike old works of art being put into modern settings,

but ""Les Paladins"" is an exception. Everything that goes on

on the scene is magnificient and fits together very well,

at least to my mind. Even if modern dance and clever use of high tech

fail to entertain you, you can still enjoy the perfect performance

of baroque music.

I would very eagerly buy more masterpieces in the same genre

produced with equally good taste.",1173830400,6,441,4.64935064935065
2432685,3,B000BOFRM6,"Saw some of this on television and had to have a copy!

Break dancing - some of the best - to madrigal like opera - all stops out staging - crazy!",1171843200,3,146,3.7096774193548385
2432686,1,B000BOFRM6,"Luckily for this production, Rameau is long dead and therefore unable to sue them for visually destroying such fine music. Buy the CD and save your retinas the damage!",1170979200,11,167,4.793103448275862
2432687,2,B000BOFRM6,"I Like ""Rameau - Les Indes Galantes "" better. 18th century opera performed in 20th century custom.....that is not my cup of tea. Music is Good otherwise there will be no star.",1165968000,4,175,4.5
2432688,5,B000BOFRM6,"I first got to know this production when it was shown over cable and satellite TV all over Latin America on the Film & Arts network. Upon learning it had been released by BBC Opus Arte, I immediately ordered it from Amazon US. Unfortunately, the two copies of this two-disc set I have received from Amazon so far have proven to be defective, as in the second disc the image freezes soon after the third act begins, and remains so thereonwards; the supplementary material, a 40-minute ""making of"" film by Rainer Moritz with interviews of the participants, cannot be accessed. From reviews from others in this website I gather these problems may  appear to affect only a particular production batch from which came my two copies; a strange indeed event given the source, but any way I thought it should be reported.

The production is great fun but requires to be approached with an open mind. Perhaps construeable as a statement against the turning of baroque opera into a museum item (its ""museum-isation"" if such a term may be coined), it makes ample and clever usage of video images and sequences projected onto the stage's background (no sets, just a screen with several slits, openings from which dancers or singers may pop in or opt out), for the many dance interludes the score calls for 18th century approaches are altogether eschewed and replaced for capoeira-like steps or brake-dance by a troupe of dancers from suburban Paris comprised by youngsters from most cultural and racial backgrounds such a metropolis  may offer, allowing for a handsome and atractive constellation of people. All in all, great fun, supported by some of the best baroque singers, young or more mature alike, France has to offer, and by that master guru of french baroque opera, the American William Christie and his wonderful band of players in the pit. Admirers of Stephanie d'Oustrac will have ample oportunity of admiring not only her outstanding singing but also her endless and shapely legs.

Again, if you won't frown before an attempt at pulling 18th century works into a contemporary setting, the set is unmissable, if you prefer your french 18th century operas peopled with singers and dancers in long coats, powdered wigs and feathered hats in Versaillesque settings, with actual gavotte steps, don't bother looking into this release.

The score has some of Rameau's most appealing music and the audience present at the Paris Chtelet theatre during the 2004 performances when the set was recorded, do sound as if they were indeed enjoying it throughout.",1158969600,16,2549,4.960187353629976
2432689,5,B000BOFRM6,"I read a number of reviews of this recording before buying it. I had a few trepidations about this one. I was warned that it was a ""Hip-Hop"" interpretation of Rameau. This didn't bother me, I know that William Christie and his Les Arts Florissants rarely put a foot wrong in this sort of thing. The visual aspect of the opera may be unusual, but the singing and the music will always be perfect or nearly perfect under the baton of monsieur Christie. I previously bought the Les Arts Florissants DVD recordings of Les Indes Galantes and Les Borades - both are excellent, albeit, very different from each other. I wasn't quite sure what to expect of Les Paladins.

I am pleased to report that this is a splendid, joyful and imaginative interpretation of this somewhat anarchic opera. Who could believe that a man in his 70s could compose such a youthful and alive opera?

The staging is unique and very effective - I wish I'd seen it at the opera house. The cast is superb - Laurent Naouri (Orcan) is always wonderful and his sense of comic timing is perfect, he brings many fine things to any production in which he is involved. Topi Lehtipuu is new to me. He is very handsome and effecting as Atis. I imagine many women will enjoy hearing and seeing this young man! Stphanie d'Oustrac (Argie) is another singer unfamiliar to me and I was very impressed with her singing, acting and dancing (although she doesn't do much of that). She is very pretty and rather exotic - she looks great in hot pants! ;-)) Sandrine Piau is Nrine and she is just about my favourite French female singer, after Patricia Petibon. Like Mademoiselle Petibon, Sandrine Piau has a great vocal instrument for Baroque music AND a great sense of comedy and a ""wide screen"" personality, to boot! Even in small parts (the role of Nrine isn't minor in any way), Sandrine Piau brings so much to the role that one cannot take one's eyes off her. Her singing, as always, is simply divine.

The music of this opera is always colourful and just a little strange - just as Rameau seemed to like it the older he got. The opera is something of a ""send up"" of a Rameau opera - by the composer himself. The opera was a flop when it was performed in Rameau's time. I dare say that the audience didn't enjoy or ""grok"" the absurd ""Monty-Pythonesque"" nature of this opera. Fortunately for us, we can buy DVDs like this one and take our time learning about, getting to know and enjoying this opera.

I only hope William Christie has a few more DVDs in him before he retires. I'd love to be able to buy DVD recordings of Les Arts Florissants' productions of Rameau's ""Hippolyte et Aricie"", ""Dardanus"", ""Plate"" and ""Castor et Pollux"". Please, pretty please with sugar on it!?",1155600000,2,2727,4.536585365853658
2432690,4,B000BOFRM6,"I share much of Mike Birman's enthusiasm for this performance. While ""daring"" performances of baroque operas far removed from their centuries old context is nowadays more banal than shocking, this production as a whole succeeds admirably. The orchestra and singing are up to William Christie's usual high standards and will satisfy even the most critical Ramiste. It can be said that the staging ""pushes the envelope"" and at times tears it, but, as Christie points out in the truly excellent ""Baroque that Rocks"" feature that accompanies the production, the work itself displays an almost absolute anarchy, and this is more than appropriately mirrored in its modern incarnation.

While I probably think fewer of the effects here work than does Mr. Birman (or, they work at first, but drive you nuts after seeing them fifty times, like the excessive random animal transformations and the line of nude actors stretching across the stage pulling up the curtain, an effect that quickly becomes deadly), there is no denying that the net result is more than satisfactory. The dancers doubling the singers is a clever idea too, which works most, if not all of the time, Many of the dances and dancers are extraordinary, in concept, execution, and in  bringing out new dimensions in Rameau's score. As for Rameau's music, while the general level is not up to that of his better-known works, this is to hold it to a very high standard indeed. One of the great advantages of the ""Baroque that Rocks"" feature is that it reprises most of the musical and dramatic highlights of the production (with comments by the singers), reminding one of the many marvelous gems in this production that tend to be forgotten in the overall musical and visual anarchy.

I rather think that if Rameau were alive today, he would be enchanted with what the moderns have made of his bagatelle. Ignore, or get used to, the things that don't work, and revel in those that do, and you too can experience the magic of Les Paladins! Highly recommended.",1154476800,9,2015,4.885964912280702
8090187,1,B000BOFRM6,"As others reviewers here have noted, endlessly irritating, chaotic, and distracting. Imagine someone possessed by demons, AND on a bad acid trip being asked to direct, stage,and choreograph a modern, salacious version of Rameau. Music itself aside (which is good), you have this production to a tee. Believe me, I really tried to watch this and was all prepared to like it, but after about forty minutes I gave up after being unable to withstand further torture.",1482624000,,462,5.012987012987013

8090189,1,B000BOFRM6,"I was hoping to enjoy music that I was not familiar with and would not have a chance, otherwise to experience.  The singing and music were terrific and the singers were engaged and performed very well.  However, the staging and choreography was horrid.  Although the dancing and staging were quite clever and good in isolation, rather than enhancing the performance it distracted and took over the entire thing.

Objectively, the plot and lyrics are just plain boring.  There are long dance scenes that in the opera's place and time would have been traditional for the period and likely quite mundane to modern audiences.  Some of the modern dance captured the music quite well and some was very clever and comic.  It was all skillful.

However, much of this dancing and side action was completely unrelated to anything happening in the opera and was basically bread and circuses.  Having fully nude dancers run around in the background during an aria or a demanding dance scene is crazy.  What is the purpose?  To shock?  To attract people who would not appreciate the art form on its own terms?

And it all became so very tiresome and droll.  My sense was that the producers were unable to rise to the occasion to create a truly valid and artistically honest production and therefore resorted to non sequitur hip/hop diversion that in the end made vaudeville appear as the pinnacle of high culture.

I am disturbed by this trend in modern productions of baroque opera.",1422748800,,1470,4.824
8090190,5,B000BOFRM6,"This is, in my view, one of Rameau's finest scores, and the production is one of the best stagings of Rameau I have ever had the good fortune to see (live), alongside the Paris Opera's Plate. Incidentally, my mother, in her 80s, took to this production immediately.",1416614400,,265,4.659574468085107
8090191,1,B000BOFRM6,"One of the ugliest performances I have ever seen. The projection technology used for the backdrop has enormous potential, not realized here. Instead, the staging seems intended to distract from the music and the libretto. And there might be a good reason for that; Christie takes this entire opera at break-neck speed and the tempi are just too fast. It seems as if he needed to get the entire opera in before the stage hands left for the night.",1413504000,6,445,4.6455696202531644
8090192,2,B000BOFRM6,"I wouldn't recommend this production. While the orchestra and some of the signers are great  (Christie's direction is usually spot on), the choreography is irritating and stupid, and most of the other visual gimmicks (for example, the video projections of animals and speeding trains) are pointless and distracting. In fact, I became so irritated by the constant visual clutter on stage and the silly acrobatic dancing that I ended up turning off the TV and just listening to the sound track.",1292284800,11,492,5.074074074074074
8090193,5,B000BOFRM6,This is like the Cirque du Soleil of the opera world. Extremely entertaining and one of the most beautiful artistic experiences. A must !,1247356800,5,137,4.75
8090194,5,B000BOFRM6,"Rameau's glorious comdie lyrique is given a spectacular and high energy multi-media staging here, with brilliant use of rich visual images projected onto the stage, showing actors morphing into all sorts of creatures, ranging from rabbits and elephants, to snakes and tigers. You can barely see where the real cast end and their projected doubles begin, as dancers and singers disappear and reappear in the most incredible forms.

The music is joyful, wild and witty and, under the baton of supreme Rameau interpreter William Christie, Les Arts Florissants and the virtuoso cast dazzle us with their superb singing and extraordinarily exciting dancing and movement. Standouts in the cast are the gorgeous Topi Lehtipuu as Atis; the hilariously quirky performance of Orcan by Laurent Naouri; Sandrine Piau's Nrine; and the delightful Argie of Stphanie d'Oustrac.

The icing on the cake of Jos Montalvo's captivating production of this opera-ballet are the dancers of the Compagnie Montalvo-Hervieu who fill the stage with vibrant energy in the form of ballet, hip-hop and cloud-dancing! I should mention there is quite a bit of very tasteful, and sometimes amusing, nudity on this DVD...",1237420800,5,1186,5.336898395721925
8090195,2,B000BOFRM6,"The best thing about this DVD: a chance to be introduced to some of most wonderful music beyond the standard repertory.  As someone forever seeking something I haven't heard before, this score was something of a revelation.  And this is greatly to the credit of William Christie, and his superb group of singers (Piau, Naouri, d'Oustrac, Piolino, Lehtipuu) who were fully engaged and demonstrated that there is much fine singing beyond the Three Tenors world.

However: the staging is just soooo tiresome!  It starts off amusingly with white projections that end up built up like a three tier cake with dancers and singers coming and going through them.  Unfortunately then you realize that's all it's going to happen, with singers mainly in the forefront while all the dancing and projections are going on in the background non stop.  I'm sure in the theater this might have been very distracting.  On video at least the camera can focus mainly on the singers and ignore most of the extraneous business during their arias.

If you curious of the music you should seriously explore the music on CDs; however if this is your only option, view a borrowed copy to make sure you know what you're getting.  It ain't cheap.  Were it not for the wonderful music, I would have tossed it out long ago.",1226102400,10,1292,4.7792792792792795
8090196,1,B000BOFRM6,"""Baroque opera that Rocks!"" No! I say: A Travesty! By the looks of the other reviews of Las Paladins it appears that I am in a decided minority. Only one other reviewer of the eleven faulted this production saying that if Rameau were not dead he would certainly ""sue the producers"" here for this desecration of his score. I quite agree. To me the thing I love most in opera is the magic of entering into another world. To leave the tangled, tortured world I live in and be transported to a fictional world of adventure or beauty or tragedy far removed from where I am now. I do not want to be besieged by the mediocraty that emanates from MTV, American Idol or the dozens and dozens of other programs thet clutter radio, T.V. and movies. If that's your thing then watch it and leave Baroque opera alone. I don't want to watch break dancing, hip hop or other senseless acrobatics. In Rameau I want to enter into the world of Baroque music and appreciate it's artificialities and it's charms. The DVDs of Les Boreades and Les Indes Galantes do this beautifully. Sometimes touches of modernity work very well in the fragile world od Baroque opera. Rameau's Zoroastre in the treatment of Rousset is an example as is Vivaldi's Ercole Su'l Termodente staged by John Pascoe. But in Les Paladins the treatment is so extreme that I shut off the video and just listen to the beauty of the music masterfully rendered by William Christie and Les Arts Florissants. This is the same criticism I had for the Platee production of Laurent Pelly. The music and music making are great and beautifully done but the production (here by Jose Montalvo)has lost all contact with the composer and the period in which the composition was written. Oh well, just another ""eurotrash"" melange. Listen but don't watch.",1220832000,19,1787,4.658227848101266
