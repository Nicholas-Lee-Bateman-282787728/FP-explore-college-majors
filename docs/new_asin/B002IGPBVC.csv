8370923,5,B002IGPBVC,"For 36 years, my daughter has always been curious and fascinated with animals and survival techniques. We have collected books & animal cards for several years, and the more we learned about animals, the more interested we became. This Edition is filled with information on what certain animals do to survive, as we learn about Predators, and Prey. The showing grabs your attention and keeps it until the end. The film is fascinating, colorful, interesting, and educational for both nature lovers and the classroom setting. This one is my daughter's favorite, and one that we watched a few times. Enjoyable, educational, and entertaining. Highly recommended!",1429488000,2,658,5.276190476190476
