5183433,4,B008UIANNI,"This DVD is well done. This is a wonderful group of Benedictine nuns who live in a cloistered Abbey in Connecticut. Their Mother Prioress is former movie actress, Dolores Hart.",1362355200,7,176,4.9
5183434,5,B008UIANNI,I've often wondered what happened to Dolores Hart.  I had known she became a nun but then there was nothing about her until now.  She is an amazing person and made the absolute right choice for her.  I felt badly for her boyfriend who never got over her.  A wonderful look inside the cloistered life.,1358640000,5,300,4.4
5183435,4,B008UIANNI,"GOD IS THE BIGGER ELVIS leaves us wanting more about the story of actress Dolores Hart and her 50 years as a nun. I have heard a lot about Dolores Hart through the years--the beautiful Hollywood starlet who left it all behind to join a convent in Connecticut. She gave up Hollywood to serve God and appears to have no regrets. GOD IS THE BIGGER ELVIS is a lovely documentary that brings Dolores Hart back to the screen. Aging and frail but full of life, Dolores Hart and her bright blue eyes light up the screen. She never talks about regrest but it seems like her life as a nun was her destiny and she never seems to look back with regret.

Here is the real story of her choice. Other nuns are interviewed about the lives they left and there new life in the convent. It is a remarkable decision to give up so much but to hopefully gain a spiritual peace few of us experience. Mother Dolores mentions the need for hope and says, If you can find hope, you might find faith."" Her gentle soul is an inspiration.

There is a bittersweet aspect to this story. Dolores Hart was engaged to be married when she told her fiance that she was entering the convent. Don Robinson never left the woman he loved for the rest of his life and regularly visited Dolores in the the convent. He dated but never married and clearly says he never got over Dolores nor did his love lesson. There is a touching scene where he visits her and as he turns to leave, they share a brief kiss on the lips and a hug. He turns to walk away and we see Dolores with tears in her eyes and she makes the sign of the cross. Sadly, Robinson died a few months later, so I wonder if in her heart, she knew his life was fading.

Here we have a sweet and inspiring story of an actress who was the toast of Hollywood and left it all behind. GOD IS THE BIGGER ELVIS has one major flaw...it's too short. I would have liked to have had more time with this very inspiring lady.",1358208000,27,1930,4.182795698924731
5183436,5,B008UIANNI,"Twas not merely by reference to Swinburne that Dolores Hart became an obsession among postwar moviegoers in the last gasp of the studio system circa 1960, but the combined efforts of men like Jerry Wald, Hal Wallis, Colonel Tom Parker--the producers who discovered her and cast her in a series of Technicolor entertainments during the height of the Cold War.  She was young, but poised beyond her years.  Was there anything she couldn't do?  She never played a mother; she was always the ingnue, though sometimes the older of two sisters--the maturity leaking through.  She had a fresh all-American look to her, though more knowing and intellectual perhaps than peers like Sandra Dee or Tuesday Weld.  And she had that Catholic thing going on, which moviegoers linked to a previous movie soubrette lost to actual real life royalty, Grace Kelly.  Dolores Hart could play in drama, in comedy, even in beach party movies, and she held her own against some of the greatest talents they threw at her.  Looking at Wild is the Wind today, it's pretty clear that she is a better actress than the infinitely more authentic Anna Magnani, but is some of this perception only hindsight in action?  Does leaving show business for a cloister confer smarts on a starlet?  I think so, if you can make it stick, and if you have a sense of humor, and apparently Mother Dolores of the convent of Regina Laudis has humor for days.

I saw her at the Oscars last year, when this movie failed unaccountably to win the category it had been nominated for.  There she was, hardly a bit of makeup on her face, still that co-ed swagger, moving down the red carpet with ease.  I don't know much about cloisters, so I wonder how does the Mother Superior get time off to go to the Oscars, unless the documentary in question is viewed as a fundraising effort to make more people give more money to the cloister, but still!  The movie has three aims, just like Black Narcissus, or In This House of Brede.  One is for you to gasp at how brutalist the architecture is where these nuns must spend their lives, and two, to show how glamorous they were before marrying Christ (not only did the order nab Dolores Hart but the film also shows us a sort of Debbie Harry wild child shrugging off a life of drug and club addiction to go straight for Jesus), and three, to present the convent as the worst experience a human being could ever get herself into--I have no idea why this angle is played up so much, but several of the subjects seem completely on edge--it's like Warhol's Chelsea Girls, but much shorter (under 4 minutes) and projected onto only one screen.

In the second half, a tender love story is developed.  Seems that when Dolores Hart entered the convent in 1963, she left behind a man, an architect, who never forgot her.  They were engaged and when she took the vows it broke his heart and he never married.  The filmmakers arrange a reunion scene between them that will have you grabbing for your Kleenex, or the cowl of your robe, if ever you had a ""Hart.""",1356998400,3,3036,4.559852670349908

5183438,5,B008UIANNI,"About thirty years ago I saw ""Where The Boys Are"" late night on UHF.  I was impressed by the terrific young cast none more than Dolores Hart.  She projected poise, intelligence, and beauty.  Naturally my young heart was smitten only to find out in a where-are-they-now segment that she later eschewed the glamour of Hollywood to become a Benedictine nun.  A few years ago ""Entertainment Weekly"" did a profile on Mother Dolores in which she made it very clear that she made the right decision.  The story was insightful and portrayed a woman who was not only worldly but at peace with herself.  The beginning of ""God Is The Bigger Elvis"" pretty much follows the trajectory of the EW story.  About midway through the film Mother Dolores cedes the spotlight to her fellow sisters and their stories are just as compelling including a nun who is a recovering alcoholic and a young novice struggling with her vocation.  The only thing you can fault this film for is brevity.  It runs about thirty-five minutes.  The most positive thing I think would come out of this film is that it would inspire others to serve God.",1355011200,49,1111,4.680412371134021

The film offers rare insight into the lives of cloistered nuns, all of whom come across as interesting women who could have chosen very different lives.

5183460,5,B008UIANNI,"Mother Dolores has weighed her vocation over against a big big career in film and she has struggled to make her vocation her new career, not without pain and sacrifice.

Her films really begin the journey to the convent; there's a aura about her in her work as an actress that tells you she will be the American Vanessa Redgrave. And in her life as Mother Dolores she is just that, but I won dr if she does not often pause and think, that maybe a few more years...??

It's hard to write this and not say I miss those other films she might have made..a gift of acting that she had and still has is such a monumental phenomenon...Katharine Hepburn said once that she would rather die than not act. Many great stars have said as much.. Mother Dolores throws a wrench into these statements and yet I wish....If you have seen LISA you can tell it's all THERE> She simply had to take up the next role and she would have had the Academy Award so many knew she would have had if she had remained in her art. And as a teacher of actresses and actors! What couldn't she have accomplished! She had Anna Magnani, Anthony Quinn, Monty Clift, Myrna Loy as her Masters..and what would we have NOW with someone like Dolores Hart as a tutor, and still acting of course! But what would Regina Laudis be without her presence? It is so difficult to choose, I would imagine. She, the niece of Mario Lanza! I think finally these contrasts give her such a big Identity now. See LISA and that Elvis Presley kiss..she was his first kiss on screen.",1401321600,2,1522,4.355633802816901

5183466,5,B008UIANNI,"Dolores Hart, a classic Hollywood beauty who starred alongside Elvis Presley and other big stars, shocked the Hollywood establishment when she chose to become a cloistered Benedictine nun in the 1950s. Since then, she has been largely forgotten by the public, only popping up now and then through her written correspondence and the ""Where Are They Now"" section of tabloid news. This beautiful, delightful, and surprising half-hour HBO special tells her life story and shows us the consequences of her choice 60 years later. Now Mother Prioress of the abbey, Hart reveals the tremendous peace and joy she has discovered in the abbey, with just a hint of sadness over the fiancee she left (and who still remains friends with her today) to join religious life. The film also gives us a history of her Hollywood career, with clips and photos, and interviews with industry veterans about her decision. It also features interviews with some of the other nuns and a look at their daily life. For an American viewing audience, this little documentary is the best you will find on contemplative religious life as a cloistered nun, as it is a truly outstanding and moving little film. Production values and everything else is extremely high, as one would expect from an HBO special produced for cable television. Forget about all of the ""Into Great Silence"" documentaries on cloistered nuns and all of the church-produced documentaries out there: This film beats them all. Unlike those other films, it is never dull or boring, breezing along at a fast pace with great level of detail in a very short running time. It also features a truly remarkable, heroic, and charismatic star in Dolores Hart.

5183483,4,B008UIANNI,"I have always been interested in Dolores Hart's decision to leave a glamorous career in Hollywood to become a nun.  I was actually in grade school when I read about this in our local TV guide column.  I had seen ""Francis of Assisi"" in our local theatre with passes that were given to our school (of the same name), and read about this a year or so later.  It also interested me as I was starting to consider a vocation to a sisterhood myself.

About two years ago, Mother Dolores was in town for a special play production that was inspired by her, and it was performed at our church auditorium.  She remained afterward generously answering all our questions, and even remained a bit more to talk to everyone as we left.  This video really captures her personality, her warmth, her sense of humor, and if anyone is discerning a vocation to the religious life, may provide insight.  For those not all that familiar with Catholic or religious vocations, will also help answer the ""why"" and what exactly a religious order does.

While in the end I discerned that I wasn't called to religious life, this video (along with Audrey Hepburn's ""Nun's  Story"") showed what could have been if I had pursued it.  And it helps to answer the ""why"" of her own choice and journey.",1372291200,5,1263,4.548672566371682

8530552,5,B008UIANNI,This is one of my favorite documentaries.  I heard about Mother Delores Hart as 4rth grader in Catholic school.  To me she is more beautiful now than when she was a starlet.  Mother Delores did what Mary did.  She chose to listen to our Lord.  She chose the better portion.  I admire Mother Delores's steadfast Faith and dedication to our Saviour.,1513814400,,347,4.60655737704918

8530556,5,B008UIANNI,"This HBO short documentary entitled ""God Is The Bigger Elvis"" is about the life of Dolores Hart,who happens to be a prominent young actress back in the late 1950's and early 1960's. But in 1963,she gave up the career in Hollywood and broke up the engagement to her boyfriend architect Don Robinson and decided to become a Benedictine nun. Her faith and love of God as a Roman Catholic was stronger rather than pursue an acting career and to marry the man that she was engaged with. This short documentary examines everything from he current life as the Mother Prioress;the status of the career that she has left;the examination of the decision that she made; and the current relationship with the man that she was suppose to marry.

It was a joy to watch as Mother Dolores exhibits detachment from this world as she offered everything up to God by giving up the temporal rewards of fame,money and success an acting career could have given her. It also presents the life of the semi-cloistered nun inside the monastery which shows the very different life that they live which is defined by prayer,silence,service and contemplation that is very much different to the modern world. It also presents the struggles that Mother Dolores experienced during her early years as well as the current novices who are trying to be a nun. It will definitely allow viewers to see a glimpse of monastic life and possibly realize of how much people will do everything to allow God to become a major part of their life. Finally,it also allow viewers to examine the amount of love and faith that they currently have with Lord.",1499558400,,1606,4.735714285714286
