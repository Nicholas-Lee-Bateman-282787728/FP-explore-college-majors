8133794,5,B000GPPONC,"These DVDs are only being released in Canada, but I have sought them all out and had them sent to the US.  My little one loves them and I like to watch them, too.  This one in particular had me laughing out loud.  Television, by its nature, has a slightly different tone that you will find  in Rosemary Wells' original books, but the writers have done an excellent job filling in the necessary details.  And I much prefer this to the ""Max and Ruby"" shows, which are a little too much like the Three Stooges for children (my child may disagree).  This being a Canadian release, if you don't like the English voices, you can always switch over to the French ones.",1222819200,,661,4.377049180327869
8133795,1,B000GPPONC,"We are big fans of the Yoko and Timothy series of books.  A friend sent us this DVD since she knows how much my kids enjoy the books.  I don't know what the cost was but if you paid me $1,000 I wouldn't sit through it again.  One of the episodes is based on the book ""Yoko"".  The other three were ""written"" for this ""production"" and I use that term loosely.  First, Yoko's mother channels Eva Gabor.  Although occasionally she uses a fake French accent but Yoko's mother is Japanese, not French or Hungarian.  The rest of the characters, who are supposed to be kindergartners, were adults trying to sound like children.  Michael Jackson or Melanie Griffith may have been able to  pull this off but not  the untalented unemployable people they hired for this lousy production .  Even my children found the characters annoying and after sitting through one painful sitting said this could go in the Goodwill box, but I don't send trash to the Goodwill so I put this where it belonged.

I assume it was a cheap DVD given the lousy production but Rosemary Wells should be ashamed  of herself for allowing her name and characters to be attached to such a shabby piece of work.  I would never buy another Rosemary Wells DVD.",1204848000,2,1218,4.527522935779817
