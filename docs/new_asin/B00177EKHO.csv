8265136,5,B00177EKHO,"I was excited to go see this film when it was first released - I mean, what a fabulous title!
The true story portrayed captivated me, and I wept at the conclusion.
I searched hard to find the film to watch again at home, and did indeed succeed in finding a VHS tape the next year.  Too bad it is no longer available on DVD, as I am loaning it to a friend, and not sure they have kept their video player as we have - I hope so!",1515196800,,426,3.7865168539325844
8265137,5,B00177EKHO,"One of a few pieces of real film documentary in my private collection. Jew in the Lotus succeeds as an adaptation of the same titled book, and as a freestanding film. What is there to say? This is a superb visual essay of the author's journey to India to document's the Dalai Lama's first official encounter with Judaism. It is also a profound commentary and analysis of personal and communal loss. Rather than comment further, I can only recommend this film for those interested in the crossroads of Buddhist and Jewish tradition, as well as in comparative religion, history, mysticism, and of course, poetry. My only regret is that the film is not feature length.",1261267200,4,665,4.791304347826087
8265138,5,B00177EKHO,"A beautiful and enchanting film-- I fall in love with the the vibrant images of India every time I watch ""The Jew in the Lotus.""  The film's deeply personal, powerful message connects with people of all faiths by treating spirituality as a human journey.

Highly recommended!",1209427200,6,275,4.956521739130435
8265139,5,B00177EKHO,"I remember seeing Jew in the Lotus during its Los Angeles theatrical run, then later on DVD.  Each time I've seen it I get more out of it.  As a film about the spiritual quest it has resonance beyond Judaism and Buddhism, asking the most important questions we can ask as humans:  who are we, what defines us and what is our personal path to a connection with god/spirit.  All this is told through a very personal and dramatic narrative, culminating with an audience with the Dalai Lama.

An excellent film that can be seen over and over.",1208995200,6,538,4.448979591836735
8265140,5,B00177EKHO,"Laurel Chiten has produced a beautiful documentary (no actors involved) of a meeting in Dharamsala between His Holiness, the 14th Dalai Lama, and a group of Jewish emissaries (most of them rabbis) on the subjects of survival of persecution and exile from their homeland -- a subject with which Jews (as others) are very familiar and with which the Tibetan culture has been becoming increasingly familiar since the late 1940s, under the Chinese cultural onslaught.

The story's narrative centers largely around the author, a Jewish writer facing an impasse both of creativity and of faith in himself, and how his participation in this group opens a new path for his life's unfolding in an unexpected direction.

Particularly touching are scenes of interaction between the (actual) Dalai Lama and (the actual) members of this group -- including one of the Dalai Lama wearing a yamulka (Jewish skullcap) at a Passover seder.",1208995200,5,921,5.133333333333334
