7928541,5,B00004ZETM,"This is one of the very best ""biographies"" mounted and produced for the Biography Channel.  In a crisply paced, near two hour length, the remarkable 60-year career of one of Hollywood's great maverick movie stars, Shirley MacLaine, begins with her early childhood in Arlington, Virginia where she was a tomboy and crackerjack baseball player, to her ballet training to strengthen her legs, followed by her first trip to New York City and Broadway to work as a chorus girl when she was only sixteen!  After high school, her ambition drove her back to New York where she worked in a series of shows as a chorus girl before being cast in the smash hit Broadway musical, ""Pajama Game"", where she was understudy to the lead, Carol Haney, who promptly broke her ankle, and Shirley was thrust onstage and overnight, as they say in the movies, she became a star.  She was signed by top agent, Hal Wallis, then interviewed by titan film director, Alfred Hitchcock, who promptly cast her in her first movie with star billing, and all this before she was 20 years old! Since then, she's appeared in over 50 films, 12 television programs including her own series, plus record-breaking theatre and successful night club appearances. MacLaine's been nominated 5 times for Best Actress, and won the Oscar for her performance in 1984's ""Terms of Endearment"".  She's also won an Emmy and 8 Golden Globe awards, plus the American Film Institute Award for Lifetime Achievement.

The influence of her parents is explored, her one unusual ""open"" marriage, her relationships with her brother, megastar Warren Beatty, and her daughter, Sachi. There are many informative cutaways to her book biographer, friends, admirers and co-workers, who all endeavor to explain the mystery and magnetism of MacLaine's complex character.  She is an Academy Award-winning actress, writer/director, best-selling author, outspoken political activist, philanthropist, New Age spiritualist and fearless truth seeker. Shirley MacLaine has sustained a triumphant, durable career that's lasted longer than most, and she's always pioneered the path to do it her way.  Excellent narration, great film clips from her movies and terrific still photos plus intimate moments with those who knew and know her all make for a winning, most entertaining and accurate biography well worth seeing!",1365292800,,2340,5.207446808510638
