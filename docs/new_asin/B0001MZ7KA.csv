2016513,5,B0001MZ7KA,"Volume 2:Aqua Teen Hunger Force
 13 episodes (2 discs):156 Minutes Long

 ATHF is one of the most hilarious, coolest shows out there today on TV. Every episode is hilarious. Anyone that enjoys Adult Swim will enjoy this dvd set.

 Volume 2 is better then the first Volume though but they are both awesome.

 It is a story of Meatwad(ball of meat), Frylock(fries), and Master Shake(milkshake). Carl there next door neighbor dosen't like them a lot because they annoy him all the time and swim in his pool. If you ever noticed his house is for sale in every episode. They encounter mostly robots and aliens, and solve mysteries. Do not buy this unless you have Volume 1. It does seem like they matured a lot on these episodes because you don't always find them destroying Carl's stuff and they curse a lot more(especially Meatwad).

 BELOW is a list of the episodes in Volume 2 and a little description of each one. I also have a length written down for everything so you know how long each episode is.

 1. Mail Order Bride -(12:00)- Shake and Carl order a bride, only to have her lock herself in Carl's house and steal his car.

 2. Super Birthday Snake -(11:31)- Meatwad asks for a bunny for his birthday but Frylock buys him a snake, which then proceeds to eat Meatwad. Frylock ends up killing Meatwad and Master Shake and Carl.

 3. Universal Re-monster -(11:28)- Emory and Oglethorpe's ""universal re-monster"" is sent to Aqua Team and makes the Aqua Team mad. They are using the Aqua Teens cable to get programs on there spaceship.

 4. Super Bowl -(11:32)- Frylock and Master Shake find 2 Super Bowl tickets in a bag of chips that Meatwad is eating, and Frylock tells Meatwad he can bring a friend with him to the big football game. Meatwad trys to find out who his best friend is.

 5. Super Hero -(11:31)- Master Shake gives Meatwad and Frylock two cell phones so they can contact ""The Drizzle"", a superhero, when there is trouble.

 6. Super Squatter -(11:31)- Frylock tries to make Shake pay for the house bills, but Shake just watches T.V and keeps saying he'll do it later.

 7. Super Spore -(11:31)- While The Aqua Teens are sitting in Carl's Pool, an Alien Tentactle reaches out and grabs Shake. Meatwad and Frylock follow it to see a squid like Alien Travis that uses Master Shake as a way to communicate with people.

 8. Supermodel -(11:32)- Master Shake comes back from the trip from Guatemala with a new nose that he had been put on by a cheap surgeon. He goes back several times so he can have more done which ends up destroying his body.

 9. Super Trivia -(11:32)- Frylock takes Meatwad, Shake, and Carl into quest to defeat his enemy Wayne the Brain, at a game of team trivia.

 10. Super Sir loin -(11:27)- Meatwad won't turn off his new album by Sir Loin. He goes on a hunger strike and meets MC Pee Pants which is now a cow.

 11. Super Computer -(11:31)- Frylock manages to create a kind of computer that can transmit emails through people's minds.

 12. The Meat Zone -(11:31)- Meatwad acquires an amazing ability to see and tell the future.

 13. Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future -(11:47)- After Carl is visited by the ghost of Christmas past and they find out the house is built on an ancient Elfian burial ground, Carl's finally fed up and moves out of the house. New neighbor Glen Danzig moves in and annoys the Aqua Teens.

I already own athf volume 1 and i already know that i will own athf volume 2. I Praid to Santa everynight to release the 2nd volume and now they have, or better yet going to.

Seriously, We are from the moon and want to moon the ATHF.  We do like to watch the cartoons...for information on how to defeat the ATHF.",1085529600,12,353,4.484375
2016516,5,B0001MZ7KA,"I've always loved this show right from the beginning of its run on Cartoon Network.  Assuming they stick with 16 episodes like they did with the first DVD set, they'll be:
Mail Order Bride
Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future (alot of people don't like this one, but it's one of my favorites, especially with Danzig guest starring)
Super Computer
Super Birthday Snake (another fave, ""You so freakin' did!"")
Super Bowl
Super Hero
Super Model
Super Spore
Super Sirloin
Super Squatter
Super Trivia
Broodwich
Meatzone
Universal Remonster
Total Recarl
Revenge of the Trees
With just 10 more episodes after these 16, I wonder if they'll include them with this set or wait to make 6 more--I don't see any more episodes on the horizon, and their last episode entitled ""The Last One"" kind of makes me skeptical, unless I'm just missing the point, whatever.
Anyways, get this as soon as possible!  It's even more hilarious than the first set.  And here's hoping they get around to Space Ghost Volume 2 soon.  Sealab 2021 Volume 1 is coming out the same time as ATHF2, so it's possible SG is in the works.",1078876800,59,1108,4.725388601036269

2016577,5,B0001MZ7KA,Awesome Show and this is a very good season/volume.  Carl and Shake are at their best in many of these episodes.  The extras are really great too.  Getting to see a minute or so of the shorts they make to play on the tv that they watch on the show is funny.  And the episode of Space Ghost Coast To Coast with versions of the aqua teen hunger force was really funny as well as the short about how aqua teen was made that was absolutley hilarious.  Very good volume!,1327190400,,465,4.122222222222222
2016578,3,B0001MZ7KA,"I got this video expecting it to keep me laughing as much as the first season did and was ultimately disappointed.  To me many of the jokes herein seemed flat and not as much fun as the sheer inspired silliness of Season One.  The focus of the Aqua Teens goes from crime fighting to dealing with various bizarre creatures who show up in their lives, and the problems they have getting along in society.  There are plenty of funny moments here, no doubt about it, but not as many as on Disc One.  I'd almost recommend you go from Season One to Season Four, when Aqua Teens gets really funny again, and buy Season Two and Season Three later, as an afterthought.  I got them in order, in case some of the adventures followed one another.  Some do, but they follow very loosely, and it's not necessary to view them in order to ""get"" the series.  It's not like Lost or something of that nature, where episodes build on earlier episodes.

All in all, this is modest addition to the Aqua Teens silliness.  It's good for spending a few bucks on, used, but I sure wouldn't shell out for it, new.",1326326400,,1086,4.36318407960199
2016579,5,B0001MZ7KA,"there's no doubt about it, i'm the number one superfan. how do i know this? because i've got diabetes and cancer as a result of watching it. any number one fans of feetball will love this but not in a way that knocks me off my superfan status. yes, i will die soon but my memory will live on because you did it. yes you did. yes you did. YES YOU DID!",1308096000,,350,3.875
2016580,4,B0001MZ7KA,"I seem to be in the minority, but while I think season 2 may be one of the consistently strong years overall, I still think the greatest of all individual episodes are in Season 1, 3, and 4.

That doesn't mean this season isn't very worth seeing.  If there are no flat out genius episodes this year for me, I really liked `Mail Order Bride', `Universal Remonster',  `Super Bowl', `Super Squatter', `Super Spore', and `Super Computer.

Overall, the series has worn off a just bit for me from when I was first enthralled by it's sheer dada-esque insanity, but the best episodes still transcend to inspired, sublime levels of bizarre, gross, tweaked humor, leaving you both laughing out loud and shaking your head at the audacity and bravery of the storytelling. When your starting premise is a giant talking shake, fries, and wad of meat living in suburban New Jersey, USA how wrong can you go?  If you like strange, gonzo humor (Monty Python would be my generation's touchstone) and/or out-there adult animation, you owe it to yourself to give this a try -- and give it a couple of episodes to let your head get into what the creators are doing.",1299715200,,1144,4.643564356435643
2016581,5,B0001MZ7KA,The discs were near mint condition.  The box/case was a little beat up but after seeing the condition of the discs i don't care.  Very impressed with the quality of the product and the shipping was about 4-5 days from ordering online.,1294185600,,234,4.5476190476190474
2016582,5,B0001MZ7KA,"Just a great show. No rhyme or reason, or even steady plots. If you're not an Aqua Teen fan, this won't win you over or convert you, but for those who follow the show or the writers, this is def a must. Plus at $16??? It's that much easier to justify.",1251936000,,251,3.9411764705882355

I have to devote my precious time to the study and evaluation of Adult Swim's fine products.  And never has a product been finer then Aqua Teen hunger Force Volume Two (I figured you were still caught up on the V2).  The Value meal of justice is back and this time, it's gonna get weird.

2016585,5,B0001MZ7KA,"This box set was bought for my husband as a Christmas present, and needless to say- he was extremely happy with it! He said that it rates right up there with all of the rest of ATHF. (He also has volumes 1, bought at the same time as volume 2, and 4). We will be buying the other volumes out there for sale soon- Easter is right around the corner-- any holiday can be an excuse!!",1172102400,,379,4.0
2016586,5,B0001MZ7KA,"The hilarious insanity gets kicked up a notch in these episodes of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, which are better than those found in the first volume.  Throughout these episodes, crime solving (occasionally) fast food items Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad get into all sorts of hilarious hijinks, beginning with neighbor Carl getting a foreign mail order bride who is frightened out of her mind.  Later on in these episodes, Meatwad gets a pet snake (can't see anything bad coming out of that...), Shake fashions himself a superhero and later becomes the host for a tenticled alien, Frylock attempts to defeat a brainy trivia buff, and MC Pee Pants (voiced by MC Chris, better known as Hesh from Sealab 2021) returns and is now known as ""Sir Loin"".  There's more, but you'll have to see it to believe it, as the series surprisingly gets better, more outlandish, and funnier with each passing episode.  One of the biggest highlights of this volume is the appearance by Glenn Danzig in ""Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past From the Future"", who becomes the Aqua Teen's new neighbor and occupant of the haunted house.  It's no wonder that Aqua Teen is the most popular of the Cartoon Network owned Adult Swim's original shows, and if you've never experienced this frequently funny series, you've been missing out.",1165190400,2,1307,4.922727272727273
2016587,5,B0001MZ7KA,"The Aqua Teen Hunger Force is back!  Follow the antics of fast food in this hilarious, offbeat, adult cartoon.  There's a Shake (Master Shake), French Fries (Frylock), and a wad of hamburger (Meatwad), and they are out to save the world when they aren't floating in their neighbor's aboveground pool.  Their neighbor, Carl, is a disgusting, uneducated, sloppy fat, hairy, Jersey-speaking guy who wears a sleeveless tank top, sweats, and flip-flops.

This second season introduces some new monsters while bringing back some old favorites from Season One, like the Mooninites and the Plutonians.  Each episode has an introductory scene from Dr. Weird and his assistant Steve, that are hilarious but have nothing to do with the show.

DISC ONE:

1) Mail Order Bride - Carl and Shake order a Chechnyan prostitute to marry, but she locks them out of the house.

2) Super Birthday Snake - Frylock kills Shake, Meatwad, and Carl, and they come back as zombies, but it turns out to be just virtual reality.

3) Universal Remonster - The Plutonians try to steal cable from the ATHF, but instead accidentally send a universal Remonster (a teddy bear made out of TV remotes) through the ""Fargate"".

4) Super Bowl - Meatwad wins superbowl tickets, and Shake and Carl fight over who is taking with him.

5) Super Hero - Shake steals toxic waste from the storage facility in the river to try and turn himself into Drizzle, a superhero.  ""$ex with animals?  There's no time, man!""

6) Super Squatter - Shake doesn't pay the bills and moves next door with Carl when the utilities are shut off.

7) Super Spore - (My favorite from Season Two!)  An alien blob named Travis takes over Shake by punching a tentacle into his brain.  He also pees like a sprinkler.  He wants a 401K, but doesn't do well in his interview because he's ""sprinkling"" and talking trash.

8) Super Model - Shake gets plastic surgery in Guatemala, but needs more so he turns to one of Carl's shady friends.

DISC TWO:

1) Super Trivia - Dr. Weird talks into a microphone with his bare hinder.  The ATHF plays bar trivia with Wayne The Brain McLaine.

2) Super Sir Loin - Dr. Weird grafts a deer antler to his groin.  The diapered spider who appeared in Season One as MC Pee Pants is back as Sir Loin, but now he is a diapered cow with a new scheme.

3) Super Computer - Frylock designs a super computer called the OoGhIJMIQxxXA!  (He says it's a Klingon word) But the ball-shaped computer travels to the past and brings back Oog the Caveman.

4) Meat Zone - Meatwad can prophesy by touching people, but its just from eating caulk thinking it was cheese.

5) Cybernetic Ghost Of Christmas Past From The Future - The ghost of Christmas past, a bird-like robot, shows up at Carl's house.  Carl's pool becomes filled with elfin blood, so he sells to Danzig the devil worshiper.

-- Extras include deleted scenes, commentaries, and a music video.

Though I think I liked Season One better, Season Two has one of my all-time favorite episodes, Super Spore.  Perhaps not quite as inventive as the first season, the humor is still sharp and the fast food is still crazy.  If you like Family Guy, Futurama, South Park, or Invader Zim, them you should get a big kick out of ATHF (though they still should lose the annoying theme music).

2016590,4,B0001MZ7KA,"ATHF is probably one of the most surreal random shows that must be seen-to-be-believed.  A show with bad animation but great writing. The sensible Fryloc, the ignorant and lazy master shake, and the childlike, idiotic meatwad and their adventures. A truely original spin off from the Space Ghost Coast to Coast show(the episode which this set contains).  The First and Third volumes are better than the Second. If the second is the worst one its still pretty good with plenty of laughs on the second disk.  ""And while your there pick up a master shake now with artificial flavor somewhat similar to strawberry. Reward yourself by eating a wad of decayed meat with a side of greasy honey mustard filling...""",1119225600,5,706,4.866666666666666
2016591,4,B0001MZ7KA,"In this second collection of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, our intrepid heroes solve crimes, avert the apocalypse, and... just kidding.  The three members of the Force, Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad couldn't save themselves from being eaten by a drunken snake, so they really don't have a chance at saving the world.  But that's why we love them.

This year, the Aqua Teens get even lazier, seeing as how they no longer even call themselves detectives (although it's not as if they were doing a lot of detective work last year).  Instead, they just bug Carl more.  Some of the ""adventures"" this year involve the Universal Remonster, which is a little monster guy who is made of remote controls that can control nearly everything.  He was built by the Plutonians Emory and Ogelthorpe, but escaped to Earth when the Plutonians used a stargate, excuse me, a fargate (it goes far, and is in no way based on that movie or the syndicated series based on the movie) to steal cable from the Aqua Teens.  Shake and Carl become co-owners of a male-order bride from Chechnya, who is so repulsed by BOTH of their appearances that she locks herself in Carl's house.  Seth MacFarlane lends his voice to Wayne ""The Brain"" MacClayne, a genius who has the power to create matter and uses it to win triva nights at bars.  Finally, we meet the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future (that's a mouthful)!  He is a story-telling robot who shows up in February, although most of his stories don't make any sense at all.

There aren't as many good episodes on this collection as there were in Volume 1, but the good episodes are awesome!  If you liked Volume 1, definitely check this out.",1113523200,5,1676,4.6440677966101696
2016592,5,B0001MZ7KA,"Before I get started on the actual review I must say that this Dvd begins with the most nauseating display of fast food consumption that I have ever seen.  The first image I saw when I slapped this baby in was a guy snarfing a hot dog with ketchup pouring down his chin in a vile wave.  In the words of Dirty Harry; ""Nobody, but nobody puts Ketchup on a hot dog""  Disgusting!

  But I digress, this is a good Dvd.  The ATHF series is one of my favorite cartoons of all time.  My favorite characters are Carl and Meatwad.  Meatwad has the funniest voice I've ever heard like a cross between a kid rapper and a hillbilly.  I love when Carl gets ticked off and threatens the other characters with death and dismemberment.  The other funny thing about Carl is that as the only human character in the show he looks like he was taken from another cartoon and stuck in as his animation seems much different from the other characters.  In fact, the whole show has this whole sort of Hanna Barbara meets the Simpsons sort of vibe in my opinion but that just adds to the wackiness.

  The episodes on this Dvd are good but some are not as good as others but that goes without saying.  My favorite shows are Super Sir loin which is the second part of the ongoing saga of MC Pee Pants (A rapper in a disposable diaper who keeps getting reincarnated as animals until he can...I don't know, do something) and The Universal Remonster which features the exploits of aliens from pluto (I can't remember their names) who build a remote control with eerie powers.  The Dvd also has many extra features, at least compared to the other two volumes.  The bonus episode of vegetable man (which can be found with some careful searching in the episode slection menu) is hilarious.

  In short this is a good Dvd to buy, although you should obviously buy volume one first as that sets the stage for many of the episodes on this disc. And watch out for that guy eatin' the hot dog.",1111017600,5,1954,4.372222222222222

However the show is not well appreciated by those who attempt to understand it. Out of all the episodes I have seen over the years, I recall only one where the plot actually achieved resolution. Additionally, the program might not be enjoyed by some because a certain level of understanding and amusement for the eccentricities of Bridge and Tunnel Trash (residents of New Jersey) is required.

2016610,5,B0001MZ7KA,"there must be something wrong with me.  i've never done drugs in my life but i find this show absolutely hilarious despite all of its randomness and abundant non-sequiturs.  i found the rambling incoherent stories of the cybernetic ghost of christmas past from the future to be beyond hilarious in particular for some reason.  the concept of combining two stupid horror/action mainstays (ghosts and robots) and splicing it with a plot which sort of remotely resembles ""a christmas carol"" is the kind of stuff that goes on in my head all the time, so this show is a natural fit for me.  in some episodes there is definately a lot going on in terms of lack of plot.  although that seemingly doesn't make sense, holding together a piece of work with no plot and intending to tie it together with other means is a harder line to tow than it seems.  repeating jokes, subtle nods and references, and tying together previous episodes and characters with the conclusion does much of the work here.  the dialogue that goes on in this show seems very organic and very natural to me; shake's weak attempts at insults that kind of peter out and don't really mean anything consequential seem pulled straight out of real life.  of course the guys who did this show were and still are very baked when they do most of the writing.  but what comes out isn't meandering, pretentious or embarrasingly indulgent but rather compact and completely insane.

admittedly, this set does have its slightly less interesting episodes just as volume 1 did.  ""super bowl"" and ""super squatter"" are among the ones i watch less frequently.  ""universal remonster,"" ""mail order bride,"" ""super birthday snake,"" ""super spore,"" ""meat zone,"" and ""super trivia"" are all instant classics.

2016612,5,B0001MZ7KA,"Hello reader, I am Ignignokt and this is Err. We are Mooninites from the inner core of the moon. Our race is hundreds of years beyond yours. Since we are so advanced, we are being gracious enough to assist your primitive mind in selecting humorous DVDs. Listen well or prepare to receive a moon spanking.

Though our sense of humor is beyond all that you can possibly comprehend with one hundred percent of your brain, these DVDs are primitive enough for you to find humorous. They are about the Aqua Teens, primitive earth fast food products. Most of the humor in these episodes in something you earth people call 'irreverent.' If you are amused by this 'irreverent' humor, you will likely find yourself in fits of primitive laughter as you watch. Though all of these episodes are very inferior by moon standards, such episodes as ""Super Birthday Snake"" and ""Universal Remonster"" are riotous by your primitive earth standards. Unfortunately for you, some of these episodes are infinitely boring, even by inferior Earth standards.

These DVDs, being primitive Earth DVDs, contain 13 episodes over two DVDs. On the moon we have 15...thousand episodes on two DVDs, so you are getting ripped off. Still these are only Earth DVDs, and you are mere Earthlings, so you probably won't even be able to notice how short these DVDs are.

There are also special features. They include things such as featurettes about the making of this show and a gallery of concept art. Also present is the Space Ghost episode, ""Baffler Meal,"" which introduced the Aqua Teens to your primitive culture. The first disc also includes Easter eggs, containing various shorts, mostly using puppets. On the moon, we would have hundreds of DVDs devoted to special features alone, and there would be thousands of Easter eggs per disc, but by Earth standards the special features are good enough to make you ""Hot Blooded"" with excitement.

Sadly, Err and I make only a brief cameo in this set. However, for you primitive minds, this might be just as well since our humor is so funny that it would be beyond all that you could possibly comprehend with 100% of your brain.

So, if you silly Earth people are looking for something to stimulate your primitive sense of humor, you will find these DVDs to be as infinitely excellent as Carl's pornography. You should buy them immediately (or sink them deep within your body). So go ahead, sodomize your limited imagination. And smoke while you are doing so.",1093910400,37,2466,4.834123222748815

You really get your money's worth when you buy this DVD! If you have never seen it, I highly recommend that you buy this set and also pick up Volume 1 while you are at it!! You won't be disappointed, It's really really funny. The episodes are great and the characters are too! Shake, Frylock, Meatwad, and Carl are the funniest cartoon characters since the South Park boys!

Volume 2 (Not SEASON) is a must have for the fans of the show, if only for the extras, which was a main buying point for me.  The shows however, have been played to death in the recent months so you'll likely not be that impressed with the episodes.  Unlike the Sealab DVD, which episodes haven't been played to death (making it a must buy as well).  The commentaries are funny and give a good bit of insight, and it includes the Baffler Meal episode of SC, several Easter Eggs two shorts that run about 15 minutes...that's plenty of bang for your buck.  Considering some 2 hour movies cost this much and have little on them, price shouldn't be an issue, either you want it or you don't.

The first volume, while funny, was only the beginning.  Volume 2 shows the series come of its own and begin to find it's comic legs.",1092700800,3,975,4.266304347826087
2016625,5,B0001MZ7KA,"I think ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" is one of the most original and creative shows to come along in many years. The beauty of ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" lies not only in its originality, but also in the fact that it is one of the funniest shows in history.

 I can't even guess how many times I have watched the first DVD set. The shows on the second set are still great, but can't really measure up to the level of the first set, although truthfully, not much could. This set contains some great episodes like ""Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future"", and ""Super Spore"" (I love Frylock's attempt at speaking Japanese, and the language training tapes furnished by Carl.) It also features a couple of episodes I consider to be duds, particularly ""Super Squatter"".

 Fortunately this time around there are more extras, including the ""Baffler Meal"" episode of ""Space Ghost"" featuring the Aqua Teens, and two ""Never Cry Wolf"" videos which show the origins of the series in an entertaining way. Also included is the ""Baffler Meal Music Video"" (which I can't even begin to describe), some deleted and alternate scenes, and commentary on four of the episodes.

 This DVD probably deserves a 4.5 star rating because not all season two shows are included, and a couple of the episodes are a bit weak. I rounded up and gave it five simply because it is classically funny and original, and the special features were great. Hopefully there will be more episodes on the next set.",1091664000,7,1473,4.689922480620155
2016626,5,B0001MZ7KA,"Master Shake, Frylock and Meatwad are at it again with ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Volume 2,"" delivering 13 hilarious episodes. While it's not as good as the first volume, there were more than a couple of episodes that had me in tears from laughing so hard. Just when you think these guys couldn't get into any more types of shenanigans, these episodes will show you that there's no limit to the trouble that can arise when these three are together. There are giant snakes, Universal Remonsters, Super Bowl tickets, a super hero wannabe who looks a lot like Master Shake for some odd reason, and let's not forget the strange Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past... from the Future. Oh yeah, and we can't leave out the always annoyed neighbor, Carl, who is always caught in the middle of all of this craziness.

 This second volume isn't as good as the first, but it's still drop-dead hilarious and always unpredictable. The same witty and ridiculous humor is still very much there. It's hard to believe that a shake, a box of fries and a shape-shifting wad of meat can be so entertaining. Once you start one episode, you're hooked. All of the episodes are very short, so it's very easy to watch this all in one day. In fact, if you added up all of the episodes together you'd get a little less than two and a half hours in running time. Trust me, once you start, it's very hard to stop watching. Even though I love every episode, I have to say that my favorite one is ""Universal Remonster."" I can never get enough of those two crazy aliens--especially the one with the German accent. They definitely need to be included in more episodes.

 This volume includes some nice extras to experiment with. There's not a whole mess of them, but there are some neat goodies to be found. Extras included are deleted scenes, commentary on selected episodes, a music video and more. There are some added bonuses that are hidden within the menus, so be sure to keep an eye out for them. While this show is nowhere near as offensive or as adult as ""South Park,"" this show does contain adult situations and language, and isn't recommended viewing for younger children. Remember, this is part of the ""Adult Swim"" lineup.

 ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Volume 2,"" while not as excellent as the first volume, did not disappoint me for a single second. The episodes are hilarious and they definitely have a very high replay value to each of them. If you are a fan of the show, then this is something you really need to pick up. And if you haven't seen it yet, be sure to catch it on Cartoon Network sometime and see if it's something you'd like.

  The material is soo pleasant. Karl is a neighbour to a gang of foods, each of the three who compromise the gang are food items, like a milkshake. The gand often summon friends from space cause mischief, and Karl canno't stop them. They rest in his pool, even though he never gives permission to them to them.

 For those who don't know, Aqua Teen Hunger Force is the show about 3 food products, Master Shake, Frylock and Meatwad who live in New Jersey. They are supposed to be detectives but they never really solve any crime, or try to for that matter. Their neighbor Carl is a porn-loving, unemployed and mostly drunk man who just wants the Aqua Teens to stay out of his ""friggin' pool."" This may sound like a wierd show so far and it is. It is my favorite on Adult Swim and I find the comedy hilarious. Unfortunately not many people I know like this show or have ever heard of it. ATHF is a kind of comedy that not everyone will appreciate, but for those who do this dvd will not dissapoint.

 1. Mail Order Bride

 2. Super Birthday Snake

 3. Universal Re-Monster

 4. Super Bowl

 5. Super Hero

 6. Super Squatter

 7. Super Spore

 8. Supermodel

 9. Super Trivia

 10. Super Sir Loin

 11. Super Computer

 12. Meat Zone

 13. Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future

 The episodes included are all great, and if nothing else you will get many good quotes from watching this. As far as extras, some pretty funny stuff is included. There are a few commentaries, the complete Space Ghost Coast to Coast episode ""Baffler Meal"" (which introduces the Aqua Teens), Future Wolf II:Origin of the Series which is a hilarious bit about how the show came to be, Future Wolf III, a cocept art/storyboard gallery, and lastly a few deleted scenes from a few of the episodes.

2016644,5,B0001MZ7KA,"Although the series as a whole is worth buying, I would say that the Volume Two DVD of Aqua Teen Hunger Force is a little better than the first. It has the immediate benefit of showcasing the show at its stride, whereas in the first few episodes of Volume One you could see the creators struggling to define the scope of the show and the characters' relationships to each other. While there are one or two lackluster episodes (I don't find the new incarnation of MC Pee Pants particularly amusing), some of them are among the best the show has to offer. From the Chechnyan mail-order bride who barricades herself in Carl's house to Travis of the Cosmos (Don't be such a bi-otch! I lawyer!), the sheer level of absurdist humor on Aqua Teen Hunger Force that actually works exceeds even that of most other Adult Swim shows. The DVD also features some extras that elaborate on ATHF's origins, including the Space Ghost episode where they first appeared, concept designs, and a tongue-in-cheek making of special. I would also have to say that the commentary is much more informative and interesting than it was on the first volume.

However...
There are 13 episodes on a two disc set. The episodes are 11 minutes long.
13 x 11 = 143 min
Your average DVD can contain about 4 hours of information (240 m). There is no reason, other than Time Warner trying to fatten the corporate wallet, to spread this out over two DVDs. Unless Cartoon Network promises to give the extra profits to the shorties, there's no excuse.
Five stars for the product. Taking one back for the greed.
PS: For the reviewer who said I was lying about DVD lengths: Funny how movie studios can fit a 2 1/2 hour movie with multiple commentary tracks, deleted scenes, and other bonuses ALL ON ONE DVD! Wow! Imagine that.
And, by the way, I think most two disc packages are pretty superfluous. Unless you've got some major extras, you can usually fit the 30-40 minutes of extras on the first disc.

However, someone is really trying to screw us fans with this dvd. (...) That is just crazy. Why would they not put all 24 season 3 episodes in this set? The answer is they want to get as much money off these dvds as they can. The funny part is the need for a 2 disc set. Are they using single layered dvds? You could probably fit 13 episodes on one single layered disc and unless they are including 4 hours of commentary and special features they are really just deliberately ripping us off.

8014869,5,B0001MZ7KA,"The greatest cartoon ever made in the history of all the earth upon THE Most DVD of formats. That's right, Digital Video Discs, not a stupid Digital Download, a.k.a. ""I can't pay attention to anything at all and I have my whole world in this little cellphone right here"".

What made this cartoon about a wad of meat, a red box of French Fries, and a meany-headed milkshake the greatest ever ???
 The fact that it's completely insane, the fact that a lot of the dialogue and plots make no sense whatsoever and have nothing to do with anything.
 This show is just pure non-sensical fun.

  Can you imagine a pistachio-flavored milkshake being so jealous of his roommate's winning 2 free super bowl tickets that he eats 1000 bags of zesty ranch flavored snack chips trying to win more free tickets and ends up dying of Cancer and Diabetes at the same time.

 Can you imagine a demon from hell being transported back to Earth in the form of a Cow and releasing a gangster rap album so that he can fund the payments for a set of patio furniture ??

 You no longer need to pretend. Climb the white walls in this straight-jacket of a show and writhe in the glory of it all.",1481328000,2,1166,4.381395348837209
