4517149,5,B0050ODYZE,"I have never seen The Cat in the Hat before and ""Tricks and Treats"" did not disappoint!  I loved watching a movie with characters that I grew up with.  You just can't go wrong with a classic!  And the fact that it was a Halloween DVD was even better! Holidays are a big deal in my house and I love making everything festive and Halloween/fall themed.  This DVD was perfect to get us in the spirit!  I had only read the books before and the DVD was exactly as I'd imagined in my mind.  That's rare!

I love all of the creative rhyming that Dr. Seuss characters are known for.  I feel like it adds a certain level of intelligence to his stories.  These stories are also informative.  For example in ""Batty for Bats"" we learn about echoes and how bats can see in the dark. ""Aye Aye"" teaches how Aye Aye can find bugs with his super eyes. I actually had to look this one up because I didn't think it was a real animal but it is a lemur so even I learned something here! It also teaches a valuable lesson about how things that sometimes seem scary really aren't.  A perfect lesson right before Halloween! ""Trick or Treat"" was my personal favorite because it was the actual Halloween episode.  It had a catchy song that I've been singing for days!

As a parent, one thing I noticed and appreciate is that the kids always ask their moms permission before going off with The Cat in the Hat on an adventure.  It seems small but it's a valuable lesson for small children and can be a lifesaving one! These habits rub off on impressionable kids!

Clean humor, great information and intelligent characters!  One minor thing I didn't like was how short the DVD was but that is also a testament to how entertaining it was!  No one wanted it to end.",1350086400,7,1734,4.318885448916409
4517150,5,B0050ODYZE,"NCircle Entertainment videos are age-appropriate for my 3 year old yet still entertaining for my 8 year old. I trust the company because there is nothing in the shows that I would not allow my children to see. We are very careful with the language that my kids hear and even the character interaction that they watch. We try to avoid fighting scenes and violence. With NCircle videos I know that my kids will only get wholesome fun. This video was really fun to watch and my kids ask for it over and over.

I received this DVD to review. The opinions stated are 100% mine.",1349654400,7,572,4.39622641509434
