1668625,3,B00005UW77,"Many producers could really learn a lesson or two from the end result of ""Space:1999"". Initially a deep, intellegent, metaphysical, and moody series, the second season of ""Space:1999"" was radically altered until the show became an action/kid's program that was almost a parody of itself. Fans have seen the same kind of heresy with ""seaQuest DSV"", and ""Galactica: 1980"", and it begs the question, ""Why go so far with re-tooling, when it just doesn't work?""
In the case of ""Space:1999"", Gerry and Sylvia Anderson were in the middle of a very nasty divorce towards the end of Season 1, and Sylvia's hand would be sorely missing from the tiller of ""Space:1999"". No second season would ever have existed except that Gerry Anderson was able to get an American producer to speed up production, and make the episodes more marketable in the States. The new season would lean more heavily on Gerry's style of storytelling; less intellectual/metaphysical, more fast-paced action.
I remember being a particularly disappointed youngster with Season 2 when it premiered. The music was all disco-funk. The uniforms were wrong. There was no Main Mission control center. Worst of all, no Victor, Paul, or Kano! Mathias inexplicably vanished, replaced by a series of Mathias lookalikes. Even Sandra got a new name and was pushed so far off into the background, whenever she appeared I wondered who she was! At least, I thought, the Eagle looks the same, and so did the exterior models of Alpha. Just about the only saving grace for the show, as far as I was concerned.
As for Maya and Tony, they didn't do much for me. While at least Maya had some cool powers (though why she could turn into Earth animals without ever having seen them before was a mystery), Tony was just kind of aggravating. I thought, ""Hey, who is this guy? Where did HE come from? And where's Paul?!""
Everything took on a cheap, slapdash feel. Characters acted very strange, and the new cast (other than Maya and Tony), ranged from dull to just plain annoying (remember that Irish/cowboy/geologist from ""All That Glisters""?). Science, which was always kind of sketchy on the show, went completely out the window in the new season.
And don't even get me started on Koenig's pink/orange jacket!
Still, I kept watching, mostly in the vain hope that the show would go back to the moody style of Year One, or that some of my favorite characters would appear again. No such luck. The new mood for the show was strangely... cheerful.
Regardless of my venom, I have to admit that there is a soft spot in my heart for Season 2, just like there is for other shows I grew up with in the '70s. And there was that cool evil mirror-Koenig episode, and even the episode with the bad plants on the planet Luton, and still other installments, that were a mixture of action, effects, and sci-fi that was just right for kids. But Season 1 was always my preference, even back then.
The hand of ""The Show Killer"" (a generally unfair title for Fred Freiberger), is evident in the ""Star Trek-ization"" of the second season. The ""Star Trek"" touches in Season 2 are the chief reason why ""Trek"" fans despise the series, whereas Season 1 was just too ""boring"" for them.
Freiberger (who created the early '70s live action kid's show ""Korg"", and helmed the last season of the original ""Trek"", and ""Six Million Dollar Man""), brought his own ""action/humor"" style to the series, which clashed with the already established ""Space:1999"" universe.
To Freiberger's enduring credit, he was a special guest speaker at the Breakaway convention in Los Angeles back in 1999. Although he may have feared being stoned with commlocks, he told it like it was, and said that if the fans did not like the changes in Season 2 (or on ""Trek"", etc.), he did the best he could, but ultimately he was the one to blame. Fans, he said, should not have to settle for something they did not like. So, although Freiberger has gotten a bad rap in sci-fi circles (and especially from ""Trek"" fans), I have to say that he was a real straight-shooter who did his best with what he had.
I got a chance to ask him what was the one thing about the show he really liked when he first took over, and he said that without a doubt it was the eagle spacecraft. You can see this reflected in Season 2, with extensive eagle use throughout, a huge model of the eagle hanger (spectacularly blown up in a later episode), and new attachments and equipment for the workhorse of Alpha Moonbase.
In any event, I could not resist buying at least the first two sets in the Season 2 release. I recommend other Season 1 snobs like myself to do the same. The sets are nicely packaged, and I couldn't see any problem with the transfers.
And the episodes? To be honest, they aren't quite as bad as I remember. Although full of cheap and cheesy elements, tiny sets, happy endings, forced jokes, and the overall style I hated as a kid, as an adult I find that I can more appreciate the concepts presented in Season 2. Some of the story ideas had merit, even if the execution of those ideas did not. And Maya's mecheivous sense of humor, along with the Koenig/Helena banter, and even Tony's beermaking skills (or lack thereof), were interesting additions.
While I do consider Season 1 to be the definitive ""Space:1999"", Season 2 is still fun for nostalgia's sake.",1014508800,8,5326,4.667021276595745
1668626,5,B00005UW77,"Season two of Space 1999 has finaly arrived and it looks better than ever! I have never seen a year two episode that wasn't worn out and scratchy, the pristine quality makes you  think your seeing these episodes for the first time. There are more bonuses than the previouse disks but still no ""making of"" documentary. A and E has again done a great job, making the wait worth it ...
Lets hope A and E puts out more bonuses and the special ""MESSAGE"" episode!
Season two begins with the addition of Maya, in the episode The Metamorph. After escaping her evil father she goes to live on Moonbase Alpha. Maya has the power of molecular transformation-she can change into any lifeform in the blink of an eye. Space 1999 was one of the first-maybe THE FIRST-television series to have a morphing character, and this was way before computer animation! Her changes were feats of camera work, who can forget her eye! The Exiles is about an alien Bonny and Clyde who hold Alpha hostage. Maya does a really cool midair transformation into a panther. One moment of humanity is about robots who want to learn to kill so they can eliminate their human masters. This episode sizzles with sex!  Tony and Helena are pitted against each other and end up almost killing each other. Journey to Where is about time travel going amok. This episode has much in common with many first season episodes and even ends on a grim philosophical note. The minatures of Earths' future cities are very well done and realistic. The Taybor  is about a trader who will stop at nothing to get Maya- and who can blame him!
If you want the best of weird and cool sci-fi Space 1999 season two is it.",1014336000,4,1658,4.52
1668627,4,B00005UW77,"...Anyway, the Space:1999 series makes a drastic change of course for the second season. In an attempt to ""Americanize"" the series (which was already popular as a UK product), cast members are dropped, sets and costumes changed, music altered and stories pumped up. Where we gain action and emotion we lose the awe and terror of the unknown. Missing most of all is Barry Morse, who looked upon the moon's journey with a sense of utter fascination.
However, Catherine Schell comes aboard as the shape-shifter Maya. The Metamorph character was an unnecessary addition, but Ms. Schell is welcome and a wonderful personality.
After the first two episodes, there is a serious downslide in episode quality. The stories are dumbed down quite a bit, with macho posturing taking the place of desperation. I enjoy both seasons, but find season 1 to be much more sophisticated.
There is much to recommend here, but be warned...it's an almost a different series. The episodes improve toward the end of the series, but some of the worst are in these two sets (Mark Of Archanon, One Moment Of Humanity & Catacombs of the Moon are all stinkers).
Great effects, above par acting and a good musical score salvage some really pedestrian plots. When it's good, it's great. When it's bad...it's Lost In Space.",1013990400,12,1289,4.91743119266055
1668643,4,B00005UW77,"I've always thought that the start of both seasons of Space 1999 weren't as much fun as the episodes that came after them. Set 5 has some good episodes and some good moments, but sets 6,7, and 8 are much more fun. As the start of season two, this set has both it's share of draw-backs and it's fun moments.
I won't waste space reviewing every episode, but I will say that The Metamorph is one of my faves! Catherine Schell is introduced as Maya in this one. New theme music, cast members, costumes, and sets are introduced as well. Dr Bergman is gone, and the main control center has now been moved underground. Maya helps to fill the void left by Bergman, and after episodes like War Games the new location of the control center makes good sense. Smart move Koenig.
Space 1999 sets 2,3,4,6,7,8 are my favorites, but 1 and 5 are important to the show and to finish your collection. There are some good epsodes in both so check them out. While you are at it, try the Space 1999 novel The Forsaken by John Muir. It sheds more light on just what happened between the program's two seasons and is an excellent read.",1078790400,10,1111,4.371980676328502
1668644,3,B00005UW77,"Some of the episodes in this set have inferior sound. It's not unlistenable, but it is sub par. Fortunatley, I don't find it too distracting, but it's too bad they didn't make the sound as wonderful as the picture quality. Apart from the sound problems, I enjoyed this set.
This set contains shows from the second season of Space 1999 which was a more ridiculous season, but there are many guilty pleasure episodes here. My favorites include:
""The Metamorph"" which is the first episode of the second season and introduces the new theme music and show opening. I like it. We also get a new command center, some new costumes, and the introduction of Tony and Maya. Tony brings some great humor to the show and he keeps trying to make beer. You have to admire a guy who tries to make beer and maintains a sense of humor while the moon is hurling through space. Catherine Schell is lovely as Maya the Psychlon and Maya can turn into all kinds of living creatures which is fun. She's also the sexiest woman with side-burns ever! Brian Blessed plays Mayas dad Mentor.
""The Exiles"" has some very suspenseful moments as 50 missiles suddenly begin to orbit the moon and the intercepting of one of them for further study is pretty tense. There's a great sense of mystery for the first half of this episode, but then it turns silly, but I like silly. ""Journey to Where"" is a bit of Time Tunnel like adventure with a good performance by Freddie Jones, and ""The Taybor"" is extremely goofy and features some scantly clad female Alphans, and Maya turning into Mr Hyde. I won't comment on the disco dancing horny android epsiode, or the episode with the living rocks. These aren't the most realistic or brainy TV episodes ever, and Set 5 is the low point of the Space 1999 DVD sets, but there are plenty of fun moments in this one and let us never forget that Catherine Schell is the sexiest woman with side-burns ever.",1075680000,3,1903,4.534883720930233
1668645,1,B00005UW77,"Does anyone remember the 70's Saturday morning action series, Land of the Lost? Space:1999 Season 2 becomes a Saturday morning action series, changing from a serious science fiction drama. It completely abandons the original premise of the series.
The first episode, The Metamorph, symbolically describes the deterioation of the show from the beauty it was in season one to the garbage it became in season 2. Not all Americans appreciated the mindless campiness the show became with its teeny bopper romance, its tacky plastic monsters and the characters becoming teenagers from any hometown high school. The acquisition of Maya had tremendous potential in the series which, alas was hopelessly wasted during the entire season.
The second episode, The Exiles, appears to be a weak attempt at recreating the premise of End of Eternity. However, it is very weak and Cantor and Zova are not as nearly menacing and threatening as Balor. The Sleestaks from Land of the Lost were more frightening.
The third episode trumpets the direction the series would go for the rest of the season. No longer epic stories of survival of a community, starting with One Moment of Stupidity, the stories are created and revolved around the couples of Koenig and Russell and Tony and Maya. If you enjoy Harlequin romances, then this should appeal to you. If you are looking for serious science fiction that is thought provoking and intellectual, you won't find it in season 2.
The fourth episode, All That Glisters, is just terrible. Alive and smart rocks. <snicker> Need I say more? Even most die-hard enthusiatic season 2 fans consider this episode bad...bad...bad.
So, on this DVD set of 4, only one episode appears to be OK..and just OK. If you are determined to see it, I advise you to go to your local library or rent it; buying it is a waste of money.",1043884800,4,1836,4.887820512820513
1668646,3,B00005UW77,"As everyone has noted, Year 2 is drastically different from Year 1. Not only is the design and costumes slightly altered, many fan favorite characters have suddenly disappeared without any explanation. Also, a corny sense of humor is injected to try disipate the tedium many Year 1 stories had. It didn't work. Though, if you grew up watching the program when it first came out, one can still find a lot of escapist fun, with Irwin Allen-type Sci-Fi explanations. The production, design and special effects are still top notch. The stories have a more action style tone to them, but the dialogue and acting is certainly questionable. the set is really a mixed bag. Obviously The Metamorph is the best of the lot, introducing Maya, the molecular tranforming sexy alien. The Exiles has it's moments. The Humanity(the one with the androids)story actually feels like a holdover from Year 1. All That Glisters, critised by the entire cast, is really a lot of fun. Martin Landau, fom what I've read, thought this was the nadir or the entire series. Journey to Where is tolerable. And The Taybor, well, you were warned.
Still, enjoyment and tolerance of this Set and the program really depends on how non-discriminating you are with cheesy Sci-Fi with a big budget.",1030752000,2,1258,4.883177570093458
1668647,3,B00005UW77,"As I had stated in my review of sets 1 through 4 - I loved the first season of Space:1999. When they went to the second season, Fred Frieberger took over - former of the original Star Trek production team.
He wanted to make it ""hip"" for the 70's. But what he did is make it more unreal for me. He dropped my favorite set ""Main Mission"" and created ""Command Center"" a much smaller and more compact room to run the base of now 289 members. The Eagles got ""mufflers"" and ""spoilers"" and they dropped two of my favorite characters - Proffesor Victor Bergman (Barry Morse) and Paul Morrow (Prentis Hancock).
Almost every epsiode someone dies. They would have never made it to a forth season because by the time third season was over, there would only be a 100 people left.
The changes I did like were the Catherine Schell character of Miya. She orginally appeared as the Keeper in Gaurdian Of Piri in the first season and did so well the producers wanted her back as a regular. Tony Chelini (Tony Anolt) was an interesting character to add too.
Visually this series relized on Laser Blasts every episode and a new set of monsters every week. Yikes! The production value of the monster made some of Dr. Who's villians look like real creatures.
Overall the stories are not as good as well. But there are some interesting action moments and comedy. (The comedy was added with no real purpose - all of a sudden, every plays jokes!)
The DVD has an interesting feature as well. Some of the original station specific promos with Barbara Bain and Martin Landau promoting the show. Very unique. You decide.",1023926400,4,1591,4.547038327526132
1668648,5,B00005UW77,"They have finaly released season 2 of this great show. Maya is so hot! The music is so great. Martin Laundau is the best actor to ever star in a sci-fi show, no wonder he won that award for Ed Wood. I am in a hurry to watch The Bringers of Wonder episode which has a story very simular to The Matrix. Space 1999 was so ahead of its time, after watching these episodes I now know were Star Trek The Next Generation gets most of its ideas, not from the original Star Trek! Hop on board Moonbase Alpha everyone for the trip of a lifetime!!!!!!!!",1020124800,7,542,4.122641509433962
1668649,2,B00005UW77,"I just got both season 2 DVDs and it just isn't right.  Dr Bergman is gone...so is Paul...the new uniforms are not a step forward nor is the command center.  The new intro and music are a step down as well.  The new guy, Tony, just doesn't bring any MEANINGFUL intensity to the role.  He is just a pretty boy to be Maya's love interest.
Metamorph had my attention but Maya's father looked so weird that it drew attention from a story that had potential...a mad man using slaves for his own purposes while completely deceiving his own daughter.  Weird looking aliens is all fine and dandy but more focus should be made on making them alien in their character and not their hair style...much like the episode of The Taybor.
The episode about the attempt to transport back to Earth was good but the Exiles, Taybor, All that Glisters and the one about the androids trying to learn how to kill were completely forgettable.
The DVD brings little in extras...just some still shots and tv promos that are all the same except for the tv station.
I wonder if someone will make a motion picture out of this show.",1016496000,,1101,4.485
1668650,5,B00005UW77,"This is a MUST HAVE for all Space 1999 fans and collectors. Despite all the critism you hear about the series, especially Season 2.  Take a look for yourself and enjoy the episodes of this famous and classic series once again. If you happen to be watching for the first time get ready to be swept away with all the excitement and enthusiasm like a scifi series is intended for. A chance to be transported imaginatively into the episode itself and experience the intensity of the plot as it unfolds to the climax. I recommend this Set, as well as all the others to complete the incredible journey for which you will begin with the very first time you pick it up.

1668651,3,B00005UW77,"The picture quality on the Season 1 DVDs was ok, but the picture quality of Sets 5 and 6 is worse!
The beginning credits jitter back and forth, and there is almost always flicker & dirt smudges. Lots of scratches & debris too. It doesnt look like they tried to clean it up at all.
To make matters worse, the publicity videos that are part of the 'extras' section, include various clips from season 2 episodes which in a few cases, offer far better picture quality than the actual episodes included on the DVD! These prints are definatly sub-par if they are supposed to be 'remasted' or 'restored'.
Unfortunatly, these DVD sets are all there is for Space: 1999 Season 2 fans in North America (Region 1 DVD), so I guess its better than nothing.

The acting was nothing to write home about but the imagination, the idea that the moon could be blown out of its orbit, fly through space, the inhabitants would survive and meet other life forms with hopes of finding that perfect planet to settle down on is far fetched.

It premiered in 1976, 30 years ago on a local station here in Arkansas, as the most expensive sci-fi series ever produced.  As a 19 year old, I missed very few episodes from the first season (working night shifts, I missed some).  Now, as a 49 year old, I have cried with joy as I watched the DVD episodes, some that I had never seen before!  This is mind-candy for me!!  Times were simpler then for me and for everyone.  Viet Nam was a bitter memory, gas shortages were a thing of the past, space shuttles were the wave of the future.

It was fun like Doctor Who, as abstract as the Prisoner, as explorational as Star Trek, as light as Lost In Space, as philosophical as 2001, as dark and claustophobic as the most entertaining horror movies and disaster films, as funny as Plan 9, and it even featured pre-Star Wars space battles that were truly a blast. On it's own merit it was also quite a unique series. It was never locked down into just one pattern so it never got sterile. There are episodes for every mood and mindset. One can enjoy the serious episodes or the just plain fun escapism. The setting of 1999 only adds to the fun and the out of control moon idea was certainly original. Many episodes allow the viewer to come to one's own conclusions and there's little clear continuity after the first episode which also allows creativity on the part of the veiwer. It's a very expansive and wonderous universe that's explored in different ways. The diversity of styles and ideas are it's greatest strength. It's always a wild ride.",1138924800,,1066,4.5863874345549736
