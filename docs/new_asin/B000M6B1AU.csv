2725878,5,B000M6B1AU,"I went looking for this on DVD but it's not available, so I transferred my VHS copies of the series to DVD so that my children will be able to enjoy this in the future. James Burke and his crew did a fantastic job in creating this series. The information wasn't spoon-fed, it took into consideration that people come into a learning situation already knowing something and he leaves enough for you to think about it after it's over.

Borrow this from a library if you don't own it and get the companion book, they're still available here on amazon.com, you deserve to see this work.",1231804800,,582,4.490566037735849
2725879,5,B000M6B1AU,"PBS has just released the series on DVD! Hands-down the best history of western science ever filmed, and one of the few science documentaries pitched above elementary school level. The vocabulary and slow pace will put off youngsters, but thoughtful adults interested in history and science will love James Burke's witty, erudite presentation.",1231113600,,343,5.490566037735849
2725880,5,B000M6B1AU,"An excellent seller, the DVDs and the book arrived in very good condition very quickly, price was reasonable, very good to deal with.  I am very satisfied with the DVDs, book and seller",1220400000,,185,4.606060606060606
2725881,5,B000M6B1AU,The After Words in the TV series are at the end of the James Burke presentation with interviews by Benjamin Dunlap with James Burke and others. The After Words with James are new and not the same as they were on TV,1213056000,,214,4.119047619047619
2725882,5,B000M6B1AU,"I have some of this series on tape from 15 years ago but it hasn't aired since then.  Burke combines science and history with a narrative that provides one surprise after another.  A previous reviewer stated that he was blown away.  Exactly my feeling.  If you can't find the series on VCR then buy the book but please purchase the book on tape just to hear Burke in his own words.  His voice is an important part of the presentation.  If this were offered on DVD, they would sell like crazy.  Someone is an idiot!  ""The Day the Universe Changed"" is an eleven on a scale of 1 to 10.",1201219200,6,582,4.2272727272727275
2725883,5,B000M6B1AU,"This documentary series blew my mind. I learned so many things about scientific discoveries -- plus it was very well directed with seamless cuts between historical recreation and Burke in the modern time explaining it all. I did tape it on VHS but the tapes are lost. I always wondered why I didn't see this title all over the place in video stores. Everyone owes it to themselves to witness this fascinating glimpse into human discovery and the way that our universe changes with each significant breakthrough in medicine, science and technology over the ages. I still have such vivid memories of this show from 21 years ago. The discovery of ether as an anesthetic was particularly surprising -- US doctors partying with it and discovering they were ""painless."" Burke on board a modern Navy vessel talking about war technology and sonar, and in another episode, Isaac Newton drops balls from a balcony and Burke catches them in the modern time. I'm searching for this on DVD. Must have.",1198627200,5,988,4.85207100591716
2725884,5,B000M6B1AU,"I watched this entire ten part BBC series by James Burke and learned more about history in its accurate form than I would have learned had I taken ten college courses. The amount of information contained in this series is simply overwhelming, and I particulary enjoyed the third segment titled ""In the Light of the Above"". It is one of the very few portrayals of the vast contributions by Muslims and Arabs to civilization, and it was that source of knowledge that transformed Europe out of its Dark Ages and into the so-called Renaissance; ""so-called"" since the French word means ""to be reborn"", yet how could Europe have been reborn into the enormous knowledge that came to them from Arabs and Muslims if they never had it before? Those contributions included science, mathematics that included algebra (the numbers we use are know as Arabic Numerals)and the introduction of the zero and decimal system. They made incredible studies and advances in optics, irrigation, navigation, astronomy, philosphy, botany, anatomy, pharmacology, medicine, architecture, dentisry, and on and on. Different courses at meals, rhyming poetry and rhythmic music, dressing for the seasons, many spices and farmed products, daily baths, public lighting, and even table manners came from the Arabs and Muslims. Europe's grand cathedrals would not have been possible without Muslim contributions to mathematics, architecture, and science. The West is deeply indebted to Muslims for those contributions. Where would we all be without them!
This series is a MUST see, MUST learn, and MUST know undertaking. I urge everyone to buy this series when it is available. You will not regret it.

2725885,5,B000M6B1AU,"My wife and I have watched this series many times, and it's always worthwhile to do it again. This man has the gift of a teacher and storyteller, and his ability to explain complex, interrelated things with crystal clarity is nothing short of marvelous. I also recommend, without reservations, his ""Connections1"". Alas, the second and third editions of ""Connections"" lacked the human pacing of the first edition. In shortening the duration of each episode by half, Burke compressed the presentation to the point of choppiness and overly-swift transitions.

But I've no such criticisms of ""The Day the Universe Changed"". It's SO good that it could almost bring back the leisure suit.",1484524800,,682,5.1441441441441444

2725891,5,B000M6B1AU,"This is an iconic series about ideas and how they have shaped the world, and while the computers shown in some of the programs are now clearly outdated, Burke's predictions about the future of networks and information sharing were incredibly accurate.

2725894,5,B000M6B1AU,"When I told John Burke my son loved his programs, he joked my son was the only person who actually watched his shows.
Well, I have to say, this mother watched too.

John Burke starts with something in history, then goes from one historical fact to the next, until, at the end, he pulls it all together for a gigantic aha moment. The segments would be wonderful to entertain - and educate - children (and adults) on rainy days. The shows are well done.",1437264000,,451,4.369047619047619

2725899,4,B000M6B1AU,This is the old show I remember from the 80s... quite dated and the image quality is as well... rather over priced for what it is but I like James Burke so it was worth it for me.,1426118400,,179,3.736842105263158
2725900,5,B000M6B1AU,"James Burke is an incredible historian, who can bring to life what you might have thought of as dull when you learned this stuff in school. Even thought the series is dated now, the shows are packed with knowledge that is still relevant today. And the presentation is fabulous. Burke makes history fun and engaging with witty script, a multitude of on location shots, and clever use the camera. Everyone should watch these shows so they can better appreciate the incredible progress we have humans have made in the last few centuries.",1425772800,,534,4.815217391304348
2725901,5,B000M6B1AU,"I'm a great fan on James Burke.  I used to have a show at Renaissance fairs that was based on this series.
You will be taken to a world just after the fall of the Roman empire and the dark age mess that left behind, and then comes an innovation, an invention, an event that radically changes everything forever; bringing us to the world we live in now.",1425600000,,352,4.176470588235294
2725902,5,B000M6B1AU,"This my favorite James Burke series, though I love all of them.  These days it is a bit old and outdated, but it is still a wonderful journey through the history of science and technology.  James Burke kindled my interest and love of the history of science starting with Connections 1.  The companion book is equally wonderful.",1425254400,,327,4.701754385964913
2725903,5,B000M6B1AU,"No one could say enough to James Burke for his innovating scope on history. So many of us owe him for explaining the ""how things progressed"" through histories innovations. All I can exclaim is ""amazing"". The first episode spooked me out almost when he is on top of the world trade center and talks about flight 911 trying to make it to the runway without lights.

2725907,5,B000M6B1AU,"James Burke leads us by the hand and gently introduces us to the synchronicity of science and history.  He ties engineering, culture, science, math and business in a way that explains how the telegraph(for instance) came about, who 'invented it', why it was no single person but instead a series of developments, and the effect that one device had on Man (it was the most transformative since the wheel, as it converted Mankind from a horse paced world to one almost the speed of light, and this in the 1850's and not the 1950's.)
I know of no series of shows that were more intelligent than this show or the related series: Connections.
Shop around for the best price and get this, especially if you are in the science/engineering community and/or you wish to introduce the next generation to intelligent thought and interesting careers.",1420588800,,838,4.819444444444445

I wish it were shown in public schools throughout the nation.  With darting humor and razor sharp insight, Burke reveals many of the key ideas behind the development of the modern world, especially in the West, from modern medicine, to science, to space, relativity, religion, and how all of these and other big ideas influenced our politics, our faith, our social structures, and our daily living.",1417392000,,569,5.10752688172043

2725916,5,B000M6B1AU,"I first saw this series when it came out, and I was a young teen. Always interested in history, I tuned into pbs and-- my universe was changed. I thought more, and differently, more thoughtfully and intelligently-- very good lessons for a teenager. Besides being fact-filled, Burke is a fine presenter, and always has an intriguing back-story to events you thought you knew. He takes you all over the world and answers all those whys. Of course, it is dated now, in production as well as hair styles and flapping suits, but really only because it ends at the tip beginnings of the computer-in-every-house cell phone era. Maybe he could make an update episode.
This, and his connections series, are just the best tv can be. I know people who don't like these series, and they aren't for everyone. I know I'm a geek for history and ideas and where we came from, where are we going ( which is what Burke presents )( should have said that first ). But I love it!",1396137600,3,958,4.511494252873563

The outsides of the DVD cases all have cracked and chipped plastic around the edges, a few chunks an inch long. Each of the five discs inside were no longer mounted in the middle, the plastic holders all had at least one clip broken (out of four). The product was wrapped in cellophane, so all the chunks of broken plastic came rattling out when I opened the cellophane. The shipping box from Amazon itself was fine and had no indication of excessive wear or handling. My set of DVDs must have fallen from the top shelf of the warehouse!

2725920,5,B000M6B1AU,I was thoroughly entertained by these videos.  This is one man's coherent view of the rise of western civilization and is very well done.  Each episode builds on the information presented in those preceding and presents a view of human progress that is nearly breathtaking.,1378598400,,273,5.044444444444444
2725921,5,B000M6B1AU,This is my second James Burke collection and I've enjoyed it immensely.  His method of walking you through history on the margins illustrates historical minor and major highlights and its modern outcome in a very memorable way.  A little expensive but I'd buy it again!,1373241600,,269,4.955555555555556
2725922,5,B000M6B1AU,"I watched this series as well as the original Connections as a young man. How apt and ironically accurate of todays internet, celebrity and decaying banking world. This series brings some truth and explaination to todays world which is stunning when one considers it and Connections were broadcast thirty or so years ago. James Burke is a much neglected visionary and watching this again was a reminder why he has been one of my favourite documentary makers since the seventies.

 If I am ever asked, ""why is technology the way it is today?,"", or ""how is science and technology likely to affect society?"" Then I will simply say ""Don't ask the experts of today, ask James Burke!""",1362182400,,678,4.786324786324786
2725923,5,B000M6B1AU,"So great to have this back in print again. Surprising how well it has held up, a clever blend of idiosyncratic historical interpretation of what could loosely be called ""progress"" over the last 400 years, with some genuinely profound observations that might startle you with their trenchant observations about the hidden assumptions that underly, and sometimes distort, our current views of science and the way the world actually works.

I got this series because I'm addicted to his other series ""Connections"" (also one of the greatest documentaries ever produced). The way Burke strings together historical events from A-Z, spanning centuries, all with a causal link perspective and fun little historical tidbits and witticisms thrown in, will have you enthralled (all in the course of a 40-60 minute episode). I can't recommend this series (or Connections), enough.",1358812800,,522,5.152941176470589

2725927,5,B000M6B1AU,Although the whole theme comes out of an atheistic mind set - James Burke did a wonderful presentation about many techical and scientific facts that the general public really don't give any thought to.

2725932,5,B000M6B1AU,"'The Day the Universe Changed' along with the other James Burke Series 'Connections' are the best documentary series ever made in my opinion. Back in the 1990s both series were aired on The Learning Channel (TLC), and it was at this point I originally saw them. Both of these series should be required viewing in high schools and universities. The message they present never ages, which in itself is amazing for a documentary.

James Burke is an excellent presenter (with a great sense of humour as well) who keeps you interested all along the way. To better understand the world we live in today, and how we all got here, I strongly recommend both of these series. You will never tire of watching them. You will not look at the history of science and technology the same ever again.

I have ordered the sequel series 'Connections 2' and 'Connections 3' as well. I will be reviewing them once I have gone through both series. If you are a big James Burke fan, be sure to also check out 'Apollo 11 - A night to Remember"". This documentary recaps the original broadcasts of the Apollo 11 moon landings aired on the BBC. James Burke provides helpful-and sometimes hilarious-demonstrations of spaceflight technology, experiencing zero gravity, and by wearing a the spacesuit the same as the ones used by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin for walking on the Moon.

James Burke is also the author of several books, from both these series and other topics as well. Be sure to check them out.",1337472000,,1481,4.688461538461539

2725935,5,B000M6B1AU,"There have been moments in human history when we have had epiphanies so significant that it seemed that the universe had changed, even though it was just that our view of the universe had changed based on the new facts.

In ""The Day the Universe Changed,"" science historian James Burke traveled all over the world for this 1985 BBC series that shows how progress was made by questioning previous assumptions and that making new discoveries leads us to be different people, which leads us to ask more questions, which in turn leads us to more new discoveries.

This wide-ranging series looks at developments in areas such as the university, mapmaking, movable type and printing, astronomy, credit, industry, medicine, anesthesia, electricity, and the telegraph.  Burke also talks about Darwin and evolution, discusses inventors such as Faraday and Edison, and examines how new scientific knowledge changes our values.  The narrator, in a prescient view of the Internet, mused then that the entire world might one day be connected electronically by computer.

I saw an episode in this series as part of a course in college and was glad to see the series available on DVD.  Even if you disagree with Burke about relativism in the last episode, you will likely find that ""The Day the Universe Changed"" is a worthwhile journey through scientific history.",1303689600,4,1349,5.054054054054054

2725937,5,B000M6B1AU,"James Burke is a fellow you would love to have at your dinner party. Affable, articulate, avuncular, with his friendly nimbus of windblown hair crowning a broad forehead with dark thick eyebrows behind heavy framed glasses, his impeccable Oxford diction coddling every phrase with dry wit and charming colloquialisms, he is the perfect paragon of the beloved college professor. You and your guests would never be bored because he can talk agreeably about, well... everything.
  Art, architecture, astronomy, biology, chemistry, physics, math, medicine, languages, philosophy, social movements, political history - you name it. Other than in your living room or in a classroom, there is no better place for James Burke than on television.
  From its earliest days, psychologists have been skeptical of television's suitability for education because the medium plays to a passive audience and is not designed for the mind's active participation. This view is valid as far as it goes but may slight the power of drama to edify, of well-executed productions to transport and the appeal of charismatic individuals to engage the imagination.
  Burke enjoyed a long association with the British Broadcasting Corporation, commencing in 1966, both behind and in front of the camera. In July 1969 he covered the Apollo 11 moon landing for the BBC. From 1996 to 2001 he wrote a regular final page column for ""Scientific American"" magazine. His discourses maintained a chatty air, constructed with a satisfying circularity, beginning  with a fascinating scientific observation, retreating to a salient historical moment, retracing steps and knitting up stitches until returning to his original point. He followed this general outline in four popular science and technology programs for the BBC and PBS networks.
  In 1978, ""Connections"", Burke's series about discovery and inventions, aired in 10 half hour episodes. The 20 segments of ""Connections 2"" appeared in 1994, with 10 more parts arriving as ""Connections 3"" in 1997.
  In 1985, ""The Day The Universe Changed"" followed a more leisurely pace, highlighting the social and philosophical ideas that influenced science history in 10 one-hour episodes. Its central premise is that we are ""what we know"" and that our definition of ""knowledge"" and our means of ascertaining it arise from cultural frameworks that change over time. The series features:
  1. ""The Way We Are"" The birth of rationalism. Thales of Miletus and the Ionian Greeks begin to see nature as impersonal and explainable in its own terms rather than as a product of supernatural agencies.
  2. ""In the Light of the Above"" The fall of Toledo to 11th century Spanish crusaders yields vast accumulations of ancient learning previously lost to European culture that had been preserved by the Islamic civilization. After a century and a half of translation efforts, medieval scholars gain enough knowledge to found universities and launch the Renaissance.
  3. ""Point of View"" The recovery of the principles of perspective drawing initiates new approaches in art and architecture. Grid lines applied to cartography enable maritime exploration of the African coastline and the discovery of the New World.
  4. ""A Matter of Fact"" Gutenberg's invention of the moveable type printing press banishes human memory as the repository of wisdom, engenders the spread of literacy, empowers free communication of ideas, transforms the meaning of factual information, and undermines the authority of the Church.
  5. ""Infinitely Reasonable"" Copernicus overturns Aristotle's celestial notions that had dominated scholastic thought for nearly 1900 years by locating the sun at the center of the universe. Kepler and Galileo confirm the Copernican worldview through observation and experiment. Newton's ""Principia Mathematica"" demonstrates in precise mathematical language the laws of motion and gravitation that explain the mechanics of the observable universe.
  6. ""Credit Where It's Due"" Great Britain adopts the Dutch banking and credit system that provides the capital to build canals, harness steam power, spur technological invention, expand factory production, distribute goods to broader markets, transfer labor from farms to cities, and create the Industrial Revolution.
  7. ""What the Doctor Ordered"" The work of surgeons and the survival rate of their patients is improved by the invention of anesthesia and the discovery that deadly sepsis is caused by microorganisms that can be destroyed during medical procedures and controlled during recuperation. Chronic outbreaks of cholera, typhoid and plague are traced to their sources in contaminated water and city planners learn to separate sewage from water intended for consumption.
  8. ""Fit To Rule"" Advances in zoology and comparative anatomy applied to collections of fossils lead to recognition that past species have become extinct. The new science of geology proves that the Earth is far more ancient than anyone knew. Wallace and Darwin propose theories of evolution to explain the diversity and inter-relationships of species. Darwin's ideas are appropriated by social theorists to rationalize utopian ideals.
  9. ""Making Waves"" Electromagnetic phenomena, the wave theory of light, and the discovery of sub-atomic particles force a reevaluation of Newtonian classical physics. Einstein's ideas on gravity and relativity, along with the application of probability theory to quantum mechanics, lead present day physicists to increasingly complex models of the fabric of nature.
  10. ""Worlds Without End"" What is reality? Different societies coexisting in the modern world apprehend different structures of reality. Is there anything objective and ultimate that human beings can universally accept?
  With impressive geographic scope, ""The Day The Universe Changed"" was filmed in the locations where the events occurred that precipitated conceptual departures, often depicted in realistic mini-dramas with period costumes and authentic props. It is James Burke himself, however, who stands front and center, narrator, guide, exhibitor, storyteller, and wit. We are ""what we know"".

Each time, I either learn or realize something new. These episodes make you think, and in the process, change your own universe. I can only imagine how much research had to go into these episodes along with the incredible insights to be able to tie together what are otherwise seemingly unrelated events. Then again, that is the main point of what Burke is trying to make -- that everything was built on what came before.

James Burke has such an interesting way of presenting and his British slant adds to that. Being on location (vs. a studio or a lecture hall) adds much to the understanding. That goodness for DVD fast-forward because once in a while Burke drags on something (usually the reenactments) seemingly to fill time. At some point, I also saw Burke's ""Connections I"" but have yet to see ""Connections II"" and ""Connections III"". I am looking forward to that.

2725947,5,B000M6B1AU,"Irrespective of your point of view, few people could find James Burke dull or boring. He has a most pleasing manner about him that encourages you to listen and think. Think about what he says yes but, more importantly, think about what HE thinks.
His theme is abundantly sensible. 'Knowledge' is only what we think TODAY. Most often this 'knowledge' is totally different - even diametrically opposed to -the  'knowledge' of yesterday and, it must be said, very likely totally different from the 'knowledge' of tomorrow!
In spite of 'knowledge' being thought of very often as the genius of  one person, 'Knowledge' is shown by Burke to be a compilation of many people's important input.
If you are not almost spellbound by the many revelations in Burke's commentary, I suspect you are a dull and unthinking person. Burke's views, of course, are purely personal. After viewing this most excellent series I doubt many of us are not wiser and more aware of how the 'western world' has evolved - and WHY!
I would venture to state that every intelligent child should be presented with this series  of DDV's as soon as they are able to appreciate the language. Burke's wise words and illustrations inspire the right attitude to learning - anything.",1260230400,,1241,4.872037914691943

2725960,5,B000M6B1AU,"This series is all about ideas. Big ideas. It's about how the Western World got to be the way it is. And if you think it was all due to wars and politics, this series will open your eyes. I taped it years ago off the air and have since watched it over and over and still am not tired of it. I was starting to despair that it would never make it to DVD. You will see some things that now appear dated, like what Burke has for a personal computer. Other things, though, are timeless, like how we all live up to our necks in debt. That said, $135 is still a bit steep for me, but I think I'll get it anyway. I'm curious about how good a transfer the video is. The series was all shot on location in gorgeous places around the world, so I would like it to be good. But it has to be better than my grainy old VHS tapes.

EDIT 2010: Well, I did buy the DVD set and I still watch it frequently. James Burke is such a sane voice to hear in today's turbulent world. (It was turbulent then, too.) And yes, the video quality is good, but not fantastic. I already look forward to the day when computers can extrapolate the details and bring this to full high-res wide-screen. But for now, I like to watch it in 14:9 mode and it looks good. Quite good.

Another note... It's absolutely true that there are no movie subtitles, but it does have Close Captioning. If you turn on CC on your TV, you will see the text in black boxes.

I will also try to update the review with a description of the product's video and sound quality once I've watched a few episodes, but I know the content well enough to review it now, having watched it on old video tapes twice within the last few years.

If you haven't watched TDTUC yet, I envy you.  To see this series for the first time is a treat.  Television production values have changed since this was filmed in the early 1980's, but in case you are not used to watching 26 year old British documentaries, please do not quickly judge this material based on the music, costumes or James' classic green outfit, as some reviews for Connections have done.  This isn't going to be high-def, back-and-forth action, nor does it need to be.  In fact, if you're like most who watch this, it will draw you in slowly.  You will initially think you are learning about science and inventions, but by the closing credits of final episode World's Without End, you will probably have become a somewhat-changed person, learning about history, culture, as well as why things were invented, or often just stumbled upon.  The series defies any existing class or style of documentary -- it is unique.

To be sure, both Connections and TDTUC are ""a personal view by James Burke"", but if you want to debate his research and the fascinating, sometimes humorous nature of the stories and demonstrations, you will have to come well prepared.  James' most controversial idea might be technological development has run amok, and that we depend upon it too much, but I see this balanced by the rest of the series' emphasis on what amazing and useful things that inventions have done.  In the end, I don't think he offers a clear answer, as there can be none.

I also found it interesting all of the places they were allowed to film -- I doubt a similar documentary crew today would be given the same access to various military or research premises, for example.

Though one might think the list price of $150 USD (current Amazon list is $135) is expensive, I don't think you can value this set as you might with most movies.  You will almost certainly want -- perhaps need -- to watch it a couple of times as it is one of those series where you won't catch it all on the first pass.  And as indicated in many reviews, it is highly educational, but also highly entertaining.  I am not purchasing a lot of DVD's today, anticipating the upcoming dominance of BluRay format movies and documentaries, but I am not waiting to own this on DVD.

UPDATE:  Video quality and sound are very good, and seemed to have been mastered from broadcast tape.  Episode 1's opening has the slight bit of video noise, and the rising sun seems slightly blurry, but seconds later as the program gets going, the video is sharp.  I've always been able to see a slight difference between DVD's 450 lines of resolution, and super-VHS 420 lines in other recorded media, and I'd estimate the quality of TDTUC to be the latter.  If that worries some, believe me it's far better than any VHS copy you would have.  Sound is also very clear.  In some of the vignettes, I can now understand for the first time some of the mumbling or quiet talking as the characters interact behind James' voice.  Absolutely worth the money, which as of this update, just went down to $119 per copy.

There are no extras, and perhaps not surprisingly, no subtitles or really any other kind of DVD features you'd expect to see with movies.  The publisher Ambrose DVD seems to have obtained the rights from BBC to make these DVD's, and I am guessing they did not have the budget for extras??  Still, a nice intro from James would have been appreciated.  But I cannot lower the product's score because of any of this.  5/5 stars.",1238198400,118,4194,4.770083102493075

James Burke's creations (this and his earlier work 'Connections' have made me love both subjects equally because of his marvelous documentaries.

The genius of this program is that it draws you into the story and makes you start to think about how a people's (a society's) perspective come about.  Among all the deep thinking is a roller coaster ride (literally) of all kinds of objects and people and events that have you laughing and, occasionally, saddened, by the curious behaviors that humans are capable of.
