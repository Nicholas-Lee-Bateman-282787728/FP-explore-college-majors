8238863,3,B0010X5JAC,"The dvd was okay as far as the exposure it gave to the artist,but compared to other art documentaries of various artists this one had a very low production value. I glad I got it as an impetus to start buying some books on Schwitters.",1375660800,,234,4.222222222222222
8238864,4,B0010X5JAC,"For those new to the work of German artist Kurt Schwitters, creator & master of Merz, this short film is an excellent primer. In brief but clear segments, it follows the development of his work in all fields: collage, painting, sculpture, assemblage, and the house-as-art with the Merzbau. Major influences are noted, and his distinctive use of them to develop his own singular vision is made clear. What's especially striking is how often he uses what others would consider garbage & debris to create stunning art; in effect, the entire world & everything in it is raw material for creation. If I give it 4 instead of 5 stars, it's only because we get just a small taste of his extraordinary body of work. What's shown is so tantalizing that we're left wanting more! That said, it'll surely inspire your own creativity -- recommended!",1302739200,,835,4.805555555555555
8238865,3,B0010X5JAC,"When I bought this I knew that Schwitters was a trailblazing collagist and I wanted to learn more about the man and his art (I had earlier Googled his name, hit images and was impressed enough by what came up that I wanted to see more).  The video is ok and it does teach some basics about the man, but I was struck at how few of his best pieces (to my eye) are included here.  I kept waiting for some of the stunners that surfaced from my Google search, but instead, other pieces were brought front and center for viewing and analysis.  I suppose I should just go with the flow and accept that, but I was disappointed.",1296604800,,619,4.184873949579832
