3714426,5,B000BM6BEQ,"Great diverse story telling. Great learning tool to keep in the minivan dvd system. Singing is a little annoying after a while. Some scenes are ""scary"" for my preschooler, but not inappropriate. I'd recommend.",1444780800,,209,5.176470588235294
3714427,1,B000BM6BEQ,"I'm disappointed with how much creative liberty was taken in the stories.  Bible stories do not require fabrication.  Children get confused as to what's really in the Bible and what was just added to ""spice things up.""",1425772800,3,218,4.864864864864865
3714428,5,B000BM6BEQ,"I enjoyed these very much.  I like the more realistic animation of the characters (not cutesy). They were however too scary and detailed (showing people being whipped, etc - true to the Bible, but hard on a little kid to watch) for my sensitive 5 year old.  We will try them again in a few years.  I would personally highly recommend them for ages 8+.",1387065600,3,351,4.369230769230769
3714429,5,B000BM6BEQ,"Although the movie is not like what the cover is showing, it is Bible based and I am happy that they used the Bible verses from the Bible. I was looking for something like this. I had Bible story books for kids but they were too easy for my child who does Bible studies everyday. If you are a devout Christian and you want more accuracy, then this DVD is for you. The picture is not Hollywood quality but the story is awesome. Your children will learn the REAL Bible stories.",1282867200,,475,4.230769230769231
3714430,1,B000BM6BEQ,"This DVD is horrible - packaging shows cute little cartoons and markets itself to be cartoons about bible stories young kids would enjoy/understand -- NOT THE CASE. No where in the video do you see the characters shown on the case, instead it's mostly STILL frames of Michael Angelo looking artwork shown while this booming narrator tells the stories in words young children will not understand. Some of the stories actually use silouette type characters that have no detail other than a black shadow moving mechanically. Horrible rip off !!!!! I am so sorry I bought this !",1149552000,43,574,4.86734693877551

8324065,5,B000BM6BEQ,"My 4 year old daughter loves these... they have a brief summary in the beginning of each story, told by Charleton Heston. Very colorful and very much by the Bible. I even enjoyed watching them with her.",1492128000,,202,4.486486486486487
8324066,2,B000BM6BEQ,"Old fashioned kids shows: too much talk of killing, killing and violence just a natural part of the story, etc.  ...need to continuously tell 7 yr old that was a long time ago -- people don't do that anymore. We've simply removed this from our library of videos for him to watch.",1489536000,,279,4.365384615384615
8324067,1,B000BM6BEQ,"I did not buy this as it starts off with incorrect information. An apple? For God's sake read your Bible. No mention of an apple in the garden. Shame on Echo Bredge,",1485820800,,165,4.1875
