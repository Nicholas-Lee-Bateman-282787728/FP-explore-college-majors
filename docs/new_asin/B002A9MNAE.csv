3883540,5,B002A9MNAE,"I normally do not purchase music DVD's, however, after seeing Kenny in Waterbury CT last year, I purchased this as a gift for my wife. Reminded us of a great evening on that cold snowy evening!",1261958400,,193,4.388888888888889
3883541,4,B002A9MNAE,"I guess one of the problems of popularity in the music world is the perception that ""you've heard it all before"". The music of a popular artist gets played so many times it's hard to imagine something fresh. And, in a way, Kenny G added to the problem by putting out a number of albums that skated dangerously close to muzac - pleasant interpretations of old favourites. I hear of many people who disparage his music as ""popular"", meaning bland. Well, this is the performance to put those misconceptions to rest. Instead of lush instrumentals and schmulty tunes, Kenny hits the stage with a 5-piece jazz ensemble of immense individual talent and blasts out some of the most amazing and creative interpretations of the best in his repertoire. The variety and musicianship impresses on every track. And the cameraderie and natural banter between musicians is a charm. This is not a pop concert. This is a jazz concert for people who love music. But don't get me wrong, Kenny's sweet sax tone and melodic improvisations won't clash with those who usually don't like jazz. Rather, his skill and feeling for the music will introduce many to the beauty of jazz. And for those who thought he was the ""Zamfir of the sax"" - well, they will be pleasantly surprised.

Note - there are some technical problems with this production. On a few tracks, on the dts HD soundtrack, you can't hear the bass and a lot of the percussion very clearly. This is particularly bad during the debut of his latin numbers where a mic problem picks up extraneous bumps that add very deep, but loud bass intrusions. You won't hear these on an average home theatre system, but if like me, you've gone for state of the art and have a subwoofer that plays into the subsonics, it's an unpleasant distraction. It's a shame the high standard of the show isn't matched by the same attention to the technical side.",1259280000,29,1874,4.661631419939577
3883542,3,B002A9MNAE,Kenny G did a good show in a beautiful place. A high quality  b-ray show.,1258675200,,73,3.8666666666666667
3883543,5,B002A9MNAE,"This is what I've been waiting for since I bought my BluRay player! I've seen Kenny in concert and this disc captures the best of everything. Great crisp picture and the sound is perfectly mixed and what you'd expect from a BluRay concert with options for LPCM Sterio, Dolby Digital 5.1 and my favorite DTS HD Master Audio! If you've never seen him in concert or need something to hold you over until the next one, this is what you need.

In my opinion Kenny G is one of the best live performers and his live music is better than what you'll get on the albums. He incorporates each of his extremely talented band members and gives each of them a chance to showcase their tremendous skills. The percussion solo is the best I've ever heard and Vail Johnson has a tremendous bass solo like nothing else (He also has solo albums available on Amazon). There's so much more than the wonderful soprano saxophone that we all know and love, in many parts it's a group of talented musicians having an all out jam session.

On this disc you get the following:

Home
Silhouette
Havana
Percussion Solo
G-Bop
You're Beautiful
Forever In Love
Rhythym & Romance
Sac-O-Loco
Besame Mucho
What a Wonderful World
Pick Up the Pieces
Bass Solo
Cadenza
Songbird

As well as a bonus interview and the following Christmas Songs:
Deck the Halls
12 Days of Christmas
Dreaming of a White Christmas
Santa Claus is Coming to Town

3883545,5,B002A9MNAE,"I have never had the chance to see Kenny G performing live, insite of being following his career for the last 19 years.
This is the perfect gift, because this DVD includes a concert with all of Kenny's hits, and some songs of his latest album too: ""Rhythm & Romance"". The quality of the image and the sound are amazing and besides it includes extras like an intimate interview to Kenny G and some Christmas hits.",1257724800,,412,4.434210526315789
3883546,5,B002A9MNAE,"This is what the blu-ray contains, just fyi everybody!

""With global album sales in excess of 50 million copies, Grammy-Award winning saxophonist Kenny G is all set to break new ground. `An Evening Of Rhythm & Romance', his first ever performance to be released in the Blu-ray format, is due out early next month when, simultaneously, it will also be available on DVD.

`An Evening of Rhythm & Romance' was filmed late in 2008 at the wonderfully atmospheric Humphreys By The Bay in San Diego when Kenny was in town as part of an extensive tour to promote his most recent studio album, `Rhythm & Romance'. Among the sixteen choice cuts are the Kenny G classics `Havana' and `G-Bop' while unsurprisingly there is also a place for his signature number `Songbird'. Cover versions of James Blunt's `You're Beautiful', Louis Armstrong's `What A Wonderful World' and the Average White Band's `Pick Up The Pieces' are included as part of a collection that for G's plethora of fans will instantly attain `must have' status.

Bonus features for this release include a revealing interview with Kenny and a trio of seasonal tracks. Exclusive to the Blu-ray product are rehearsal takes of two of these Christmas tunes.

`An Evening Of Rhythm & Romance' is due for release on October 6 from Eagle Rock Entertainment.""

3883563,5,B002A9MNAE,I am a huge fan of this type of music. I have always wanted to see Kenny G is concert. This instrument is so beautiful when he plays it. A must buy. That music is so pretty,1388361600,,172,3.675675675675676
3883564,5,B002A9MNAE,Excellent collection for your blue ray library. Kenny-G is very skillful with his sax. He's a genius. Great sound great video.,1384387200,,126,5.0476190476190474
3883565,1,B002A9MNAE,"It's not very often that one gets to see Kenny G's concert in Blu-ray or for that matter even on DVD. A great artist, good selection of songs and decent video quality that is let down by poor quality of audio. Even in DTS-HD MA the sound is shockingly poor! What were they thinking?

Nowhere on the Blu-ray does it mention where this Blu-ray disc is mastered and made. The sound quality is comparable to the shabby & shoddy media that is mastered & manufactured in South American countries. I avoid them like a plague!

This is the kind of Blu-ray that one watches only once because the sound quality so uninspiring that you may never play it again especially if you have a decent 5.1 A/V playback system. I do have a few discs that are worse than this concert. What a waste of efforts, time and money. Do yourself a favour, watch this concert on YouTube and you would not miss a thing!",1377648000,,886,4.363636363636363
3883566,5,B002A9MNAE,Visuals are dynamic. The recording quality is out of this world. the selections on this DVD are ecstatic and are presented in the order which make it so captivating that one just keeps yearning for more. Kenny does justice with this production.,1374883200,,244,4.833333333333333

3883570,3,B002A9MNAE,"I really like Kenny G.  I was looking for a romantic DVD.  What this was is a concert where Kenny wanted to connect to his audience by ""chatting them up"" and impressing them with how long he can blow his horn.  That's fine when your at the actual show.  However, in my opinion, all of that should have been edited out for home viewing.

Oh well, said my piece!",1353110400,,360,4.159420289855072

3883574,5,B002A9MNAE,"There simply is NOT another human being who can make music with a sax like Kenny G can. I'm not a professional, but DO play sax and 3 other instruments, and come from a music background family, so I know good music from bad. Kenny is simply the best when it comes to the sax...PERIOD. This concert makes this obvious. If you like sax, or just get into great instrumental music, you won't be sorry if you buy this one! Get off the fence...go for it!!",1299456000,,449,4.232558139534884

3883578,3,B002A9MNAE,"Some how I expected more and I can't quite put my finger on my dissatisfaction.  The production values and recording were fine.  The song selections were varied and didn't include simply familiar material.  I'm an enthusiastic Kenny G fan however the performance didn't really pull me in.  I wanted to like the performance but maybe I just wasn't up for this type of entertainment when I chose to watch it.  Whatever the reason, I have to say this disk didn't really meet my expectations.",1275264000,,488,4.761904761904762

The DVD stoped playing on this song, then it jumped, skipped, music stopped, Kenny G's face turned into different colors like a chameleon. Returned it for a replacement & the same exact thing happened. Is the maker of this DVD sleeping? Haven't they viewed & tested their own product before selling? Such a pity.........excellent DVD ruined by carelessness.",1262995200,,517,5.094117647058823
