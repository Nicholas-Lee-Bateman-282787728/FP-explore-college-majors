191212,1,1573309966,"After using (and loving)the Gin Miller step videos, I found this video to be difficult to follow and it was a waste of my money. Kathy Smith seems to assume that the user already knows the steps and her cueing is too late.  She needs to demonstrate the more complex steps and do more repetitions  with fewer step changes.  I found the camera work to be poor also.  At  times I was trying to watch what the legs were doing only to have the  camera focused on the upper body only.  At other times the camera gave long  side views when front views were necessary to follow the steps.  I've tried  the video a few times and each time gave up in frustration and got out my  Gin Miller tapes.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.",948585600,10,731,4.179856115107913
191213,2,1573309966,"While I find Kathy's cuing and instruction to be pretty good, I find this tape monotonous.  The music hardly varies on the three aerobic workouts. The setting in a warehouse with everyone in black, is just dark! !You will  sweat;the first two numbers are fairly easy to follow, the third gets more  difficult with turns which are not easy to accomplish when trying to watch  a video. Not a tape I look forward to doing very often!",945907200,6,430,4.545454545454546
191214,5,1573309966,"After my membership at a health facility expired last summer I looked for tapes which I could do at home to 'mimic' the intensity of the aerobic classes I went to.  I really enjoyed step aerobics and also liked Kathy  Smith; so I was happy to find this tape.  Over a year later this is still  my favorite step workout!!  I sweat like crazy when I do this workout and  it's super fun. Her 90 minute step workout is also very good. :)
There  are 3 segments that are about 12 minutes in length (beginner, intermediate,  advanced).  I usually do the whole tape which is about 50 minutes long.  It  is comparable to a workout you would get at the gym.  There's a lot of  variety in the moves which keeps it interesting.  Kathy's cueing is  unsurpassed! Great workout, and usually can be found at a great price too.",933120000,8,809,4.3355704697986575

191224,4,1573309966,"I bought this DVD because I had the Power Step workout on VHS and my VCR quit working.  But I remembered it being a good, long workout, which was what I wanted.  They just don't make exercise programs like they used to!

Anyway, I'm not a big fan of the bonus workout so I won't spend a lot of time on it -- I just don't use it!  I tried it once and found it to be not as good as the Power Step workout.  First of all, there was just not adequate instruction/cueing for the moods as I am used to for Kathy Smith's workouts.  I felt that I was flailing along, that I couldn't follow the moves very well.  This is not normal for me and Kathy Smith workouts.  I also don't like cardio sections to be interrupted with weights -- the weight lifting in DVDs like this is not quite what I need and I would prefer to do strength training on my own.  At least it is much easier to skip these segments on a DVD than with a VHS tape!

But on to the main workout.  This is probably my second favorite Kathy Smith workout (after the one currently being sold as a ""Timeless Step Workout"").  I feel that there is adequate instruction (including previews of some of the more advanced moves) and that the cueing is good.

The music is about what you'd expect for a program like this; not too loud or obnoxious and it provides a good beat to step to.  Kathy's voice is easy to hear over the music.  The set is not distracting and the other participants all know what is going on -- you don't catch anyone in the background doing the wrong moves.

There is an odd step used, sort of a springboard thing.  I don't have one of these and have no idea where to find one.  I just use a regular step and it is fine.  There are a few ways to modify the workout to make it easier or more difficult.  Easier: lower step, drop the arms, don't do the jumping (just step instead).  Harder: higher step, do all the jumping.  So this will serve you through a variety of fitness levels.  (Also, the main workout is divided into three segments so you could choose more or fewer of these depending on the amount of time you have and/or your fitness level, or do different ones on different days to keep from getting bored.)

With my step on its highest height, this is quite challenging.  I can make it through but I am beat afterwards.  This is what I want!

Anyway, I've been doing this workout about once a week for six weeks as part of my overall fitness program and I'm seeing great results.  The power stepping, especially with a high step, burns a ton of calories.  It seems to be strengthening my knees, too, because I am not having as much trouble with them as I used to.  (Though if you have knee trouble, take it super slowly at first.  Stepping on a high step can be hard on the knees.)

If you like 90s aerobics videos and have a step, this is a great one to add to your collection.  Though somewhat dated, the workout is still excellent.",1455494400,7,2915,4.1852517985611515

191233,5,1573309966,"I love this DVD.  I used to do a lot of step aerobics in the gym back in the early 90's when it first became popular and always loved it.  I work out at home now and I do this DVD at least once a week as part of my DVD rotation.  It's challenging, not really for a beginner, and a good solid workout.  I really like that the routines are not overly complicated.  I have bought some step DVDs where the combinations are so complicated with steps that keep getting added on and on that I get frustrated, but this one is difficult without being frustrating.  I am in very good shape and this is still challenging whenever I do it.

191235,3,1573309966,"I'm a little torn on how to rate this workout. I've been doing step for about 10 years and thought that although the workout itself is solid, Kathy's sub-par cuing is even worse than usual, and she doesn't show as many modifications as I think she should. The moves aren't that hard to pick up, it's just a little hard to follow for the first few times because of her teaching style. This workout is one that's better if you stick with it and get to know the routine so you can rely on your own memory to follow the routines.",1439078400,,525,4.207920792079208

Kathy Smith is great at what she does - engaging but not overly perky, I cannot stand the cheerleaders of the exercise video world.  The workout includes modifiers, so if you are new to exercise in general or step aerobics in particular, you will have no problems.  And if you finish the workout without modifying, you will be sweating.  I've been doing this one off and on for somewhere around 15 years, and still am not tired of it.

191282,5,1573309966,"This DVD includes two 50 minute step workouts from Kathy's earlier step VHS releases.  The original titles are ""Power Step,1994"" and ""Fat Burning Breakthrough,2000"".  Power Step incorporates power step (plyometrics type moves) into basic step moves.  I love this program, because it is a great throwback to original step moves, but it really gets your heart rate up.

Fat Burning Breakthrough is my favorite Kathy Smith program and I've been searching for a DVD version for years.  This program includes 2 twenty minute step programs, plus 2 seven minute weight workouts and an eight minute abs routine.  Both programs progress from easier moves to more difficult, heart pumping moves.

I am really happy to finally find both routines on DVD...finally!
Because these are re-releases, the music and outfits are a little dated, but I think one gets as good of a workout as a Jillian Michaels' workout.  Plus, step is a lot of fun and easier on the joints.  I'll enjoy mixing both workouts into my weekly routine.",1395100800,19,1010,4.964285714285714

I bought Kathy Smith's Power Step workout and was able to stick with it (3x a week for several years) and acheived my goal!  What's great about this workout is how easy you can modify it for your fitness level. I'm very tall and I like Kathy's pace. There is time for me to finish each move. She also cues very well.

I lose weight and keep it off when I use this workout among my others that I do with weights as well. It is easy to do and your heart rate stays up that full time you use the workout. Much better for you than jogging or running. I highly recommend this for great buns and great legs. I get compliments on my legs and buns all the time!! Thanks to this workout. She uses all the muscles in your body and it is so fun to do! If you love to jump. Get the board that goes with it. Makes your workout even better. You forget you are exercising. It takes a few times to get the steps so you can follow but don't give up. It's all easy after that. You will enjoy yourself and the time flies!

191286,4,1573309966,"I have tried all three Kathy Smith's step videos, I have to say I like this one the best.  I wasn't sure how it would work for me, being that it's billed a ""Power Stepping"" workout, but Kathy includes a low impact modifier which I really appreciate.  My heartrate was plenty high even without all the jumps, of course if I had the special bouncy step that is used in the video, I probably would have included the jumps.  But, I tend to prefer low impact work, plus my achilles tendon is beat up a bit so I need to keep impact to a minimum anyway.

There are 3 combinations, plus warm up and cooldown.  The entire workout is about 50 minutes, each stepping section is around 12 minutes.  The moves are simple and straightforward, nothing too complex which I also prefer.  It seems so many of today's step workouts are tricky and confusing, and I find myself staring at the TV puzzled rather than doing my workout.  Many of my step workouts like this one, were from that early to mid 90's era, which was the best for step workouts in my opinion.

The only problem I have with this workout is that I would have prefer the lower body toning work be at the end of the workout or not in the workout at all.  I do weight work on non step days and get plenty of squats and lunges there.  But as another reviewer said, it's only for a few minutes so it's not a dealbreaker.  I felt that it interrupted the flow of the workout, I would have preferred some other step moves in place of it.

Overall, I give this workout 4 stars.  For those who don't like power moves, don't let that steer you away, there are actually 2 gals who do this workout without any power, and they are easy to follow.  It's a great cardio workout either way.",1259280000,,1722,4.2392638036809815

The first 13 minute routine is as much fun as the 3rd. Usually, the first is a little boring, but not here. I highly recommend that anybody looking for a fun step workout should get this video right away.",1156723200,6,376,4.385714285714286
191302,4,1573309966,"This DVID is about 50 minutes long. It's a good workout. Parts of it are more intense than others. It doesn't seem to really build in intensity - or - ebb and flow in intensity in a nice way. In other words the variance in intensity seems kind of haphazard. Karen Voight seems to plan waves of intensity to keep your heart rate up throughout most of the workout. This one doesn't seem to indicate that Kathy Smith was paying a lot of attention to that.

There are a lot of propulsion moves in this DVD. They use a special step that bows in when they jump on it. This workout takes advantage of that kind of step. I have a regular step which means some of the propulsion moves are a little more challenging for me. This DVD gives me some knee pain where others don't as much (it's the type of propulsion move, not the quanity, and it's time proximity to other propulsion moves).

The camera guys try to get very artsy; and so they do a LOT of cuts during transitions and at the beginning of new moves. This makes the steps much harder to learn and get under your belt.

To me, some of the step routines in the last set are a little boring. The last 12 minute set really seems to slow down. The first two 12 minute sets (after the warm-up) are more interesting and fun, more energizing.

She uses a lot of sudden, purposeful jumps onto the step. So for instance, you'll do this ""power hold"" where you forcefully jump up on the step on one foot. Kind of like hop-scotch. If you played hop-scotch slowly with a lot of purpose and made one big jump on one foot per hop-scotch square, paused, made another big jump on the other foot, paused, made another big jump on the opposite foot, and so on. So instead of normal propulsion moves where you are more light on your feet and switch feet more quickly, these power holds and other purposeful jumps are heavier, more targeted, and giving your leg/foot more shock.",1152230400,7,1906,4.330532212885154

191306,5,1573309966,"I love this step workout, it has become my favorite, and would highly recommend it. Its fun, easy to learn after a few times, and challenging.

Kathy Smith has a cheerful, but not false personality that enables you to watch the DVD over and over. I cant tell you how many times I want to toss a workout after watching it a few times because the instructor or the other people on the video's fake cheerfulness.

 In this particular DVD Kathy is almost flawless (there are problems with some of her other DVD's)which in a step work could be dangerous.

I won't go into a breakdown seeing as other reviewers have done this already but I will say that I really like this DVD it has kept me motivated, I have had it for about 6 months and use it 2 to 3 times a week alternating between other DVD's. I have lost almost 60 pounds in the last 9 months with the help of Kathy Smith's DVD's. I started with Leslie Sanson's walking series DVD's and have worked my way to step. I continue to try many different workouts but this is one of my favorite The nice thing about this particular workout is that you can modify depending on your fitness level increasing the intensity as your fitness level increases. The instructions are clear and the camera angles are shot so that you can see foot placement which is very important in step, but its not disorienting so that you don't know what going on with the hands either. Another thing that is nice is you can use any step, some of the other step workouts require a special step that must be purchased for that particular workout, although Kathy does endorse a step, it is not required for this workout.",1133222400,17,1639,4.399339933993399

191308,5,1573309966,"As you can tell from my other reviews, I own a lot of Kathy Smith DVD's. The reason is she has solid workouts that are fun and she has great cue-ing and instruction. She always cues from YOUR point of view, when she says left it's YOUR left, which makes it easy to mirror her on the screen.

This step workout has 3 segments, designed for beginner, intermediate and advanced. The beginner should stop after segment 1 and go to the cooldown. The intermediate stepper should finish segments 1 and 2 and then proceed to the cooldown. The advanced stepper can do all 3 segments before cooling down.

Each segment gives you two options: high impact (power moves) or low impact. Higher impact consists of modifying low impact moves to contain more jumps. One person in each segment does the low impact moves so you can follow her.

Segment 1: 12 minutes long. Easy to follow basic stepping. Kathy and company use a springboard step but any step (or even no step for beginners) will work just fine.

Segment 2: 13 minutes long. Slightly more intense than segment 1 and more add on sequences. After you've been stepping 6 minutes Kathy moves to squats and lunges which gives you a rest and lets your heartrate lower. This is my only complaint about this video, I wish she would have added this at the end of the entire video and continued cardio through the entire 2nd segement. However, this segment only lasts ~4 minutes so it's not that big of a deal. There is a heart rate check after this segment.

Segment 3: 12 minutes. The step is switched to the other position for a bit more variety. A few squats and leg lifts in sequence finish out this segment.

There is a 5 minute cooldown and a little bit of a stretch (probably won't be adequate for most people after this workout).

She has a safety demonstration after the cooldown where she promotes the step she shows in the video, but should be viewed by first time steppers to make sure they do it properly.",1118966400,33,1955,4.490140845070423
191319,2,1573309966,"This tape definitely provides a good workout, but it lacks any kind of excitement. There's no complexity to the moves, and I don't find Kathy Smith to be an inspiring or engaging leader.

They do a GREAT job of toning the lower body while making the heart pound! I lost about 30 lbs doing this video along with her other videos.. she really delivers. If you're serious about weight loss, Kathy Smith will definitely help you. Anyone serious about losing weight and getting healthy won't be bothered by her voice, the music, the outfits, etc. The exercise is what is important.",1104278400,13,513,4.586956521739131
191321,3,1573309966,"I have bought four Jane Fonda and then decided to try something new. This VHS is nice but I like Jane Fonda's more. The moves in this VHS are not difficult. However, the ""orders"" of these moves are complicated so you need to put certain efforts in order to memorize them. For instance, usually a move includes two part. One starts with the left leg and the other with the right leg. Kathy sometimes teaches you both parts first but then takes only one part when combining it with other moves. So when your instinct tells you to do the second part, she already moves to the next move. She often creates a complicate set with a lot of moves and she does not allow the beginners to have enough practices of each move before actually combines them altogether. (In contrast, Jane Fonda usually does.) I feel the design of this kind of order is mainly for ""fancy,"" not for ""work-out"" so it is kind of missing the point.",1103846400,5,913,4.408284023668639
191322,4,1573309966,"I like Kathy Smith and this is a good workout. Maybe its just me but I found it really confusing when she was doing the segment where the step was vertical and she was facing in the opposite direction from me.  I know that is probably necessary, but in that case she needs to explain what she is doing and actually cue the moves.  Its hard to just catch on.  There was one particular series that I still do not understand what she's doing
Other than that, the moves were easy to follow.
I particularly like that you could modify it by adding more or less power moves.",1084924800,2,567,4.231481481481482
191323,5,1573309966,"I'm a total klutz when it comes to exercise videos, but Kathy Smith is my favorite instructor. She doesn't do fancy steps that take multiple viewings to ""catch on"" to, she doesn't do anything unsafe, and always gives low and higher impact exercise options.
This step workout still makes me sweat and my heart beat fast enough for a good aerobic workout, even after working out six times a week for months. The music is innocuous enough that it's not annoying, even though I do the workout about twice a week (I rotate four workout videos). Kathy has a few annoying whoops, but not enough to irritate me. I like that she has you take your pulse twice during the workout, to make sure you're working at your target heartrate. The workout is about 45 minutes long without the cooldown (I confess that I skip it and just walk around for a few minutes instead)",1084320000,3,855,4.52258064516129

THE NICE THING ABOUT THIS VIDEO IS THAT YOU CAN MODIFY AND STILL GET AN AWESOME WORKOUT.  THE CHOREOGRAPHY IS JUST RIGHT FOR MY TASTE.  FOR EXAMPLE, IT'S NOT TOO COMPLICATED AND NOT TOO EASY.  I FOUND MYSELF A LITTLE LOST THE FIRST TIME I DID THE WORKOUT BUT FORTUNATELY, I CAUGHT ON VERY QUICK.  TO SUM IT UP, IT IS A WORKOUT YOU CAN DO WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE REALLY REALLY SWEATING OR JUST MAINTAINING A MODERATE PACE.  IF YOU THINK THE CHOREOGRAPHY IS TOO HARD AT FIRST, EACH TIME YOU DO IT GETS EASIER AND EASIER AND ONCE YOU GET IT, ITS FUN!  IN MY OPINION, THE BEAUTY OF A WORKOUT IS TO BE A LITTLE CHALLENGED BY CHOREOGRAPHY BUT NOT TOO MUCH!  OVERALL, ITS ONE OF MY FAVORITES.",1071792000,,772,4.3125
191325,4,1573309966,"This is a great power step workout video.  I usually get bored with step exercise videos as they quickly become dull and uninspiring once you've mastered the routine.  This video is fun and challenging.  I don't think it is a video for beginners though as Kathy does not take a lot of time to explain or show some of the basic step moves.  However, for someone who is familiar with Step, it offers a good workout along with some fun moves.  There are times that the steppers in the video are a slip second off of the beat of the music.  As long as you can keep a beat though you'll be fine.  Kathy does a good job of showing alternative low-impact moves in the event that you aren't up for the power moves.  My only complaint is the somewhat lame music.",1054684800,2,753,4.253521126760563
191326,4,1573309966,"This is one of those aerobic tapes that just seem to fly by - it's fun to do and you work up a good sweat.  While Kathy Smith has a lot of high powered moves in this tape, even a beginner level person can keep up since one person is always shown doing the steps at a lower intensity as a guide.  The biggest drawback in this video is the lack of clear instruction, particularly in the last segment of the workout.
In the last segment she adds more complex moves, without really explaining them.  In fact, she says, while doing one move, ""Now watch the person behind me, that's the move we're doing next"" and that's the extent of the explanation!  If you're the type of person who needs to be told, ""put your right foot here"" like I am, and especially if you are new to step, I'd recommend starting with her ""Step Workout"" first; she does a much better job of clearly cueing the steps in that tape.
But if you aren't new to step - this is a great workout and one you're sure to enjoy again and again as I have.",1047600000,8,1009,4.13265306122449
191327,5,1573309966,"This video is good for both beginners and the more advanced stepper.  The power moves are great, but you don't have to do them until you are ready.  Her cues are easy to follow, and she does not get on my nerves like some video instructors do.
I wish I had that spring-board step though, now that looks like fun!  I only have the original stepper, which though is fine with me as it allows me to take the level of step down until I am ready for a harder workout.
You can't beat step workouts really for adapting with you.  You can easily start really easy and build up, e.g.
you can have a low step and do no power jumps, and even minimise your arm movements until you are fitter and feel ready to start adding another step, then power moves etc.",1046044800,,746,4.159722222222222

Unlike previous reviewers, I think she cues quite well, especially compared to Denise Austin, who rarely cues on time. This video is a great step workout. It is not for beginners. This workout really gets the heart pumping. Kathy shows you power moves you can do to increase your calorie burn, or you can choose not to do the power moves. You can choose to do all three intervals, or just do one or two. Great warm-up and cool down. I recommend this for intermediate steppers.",1044230400,3,585,4.528301886792453

This video, in particular, is my favorite.  When I am up for a great workout I pop ""Power Step Workout"" in my VCR.  All three sections keep my heart rate up, and the combinations are challenging, but very easy to learn if you are a beginner.  I especially like that there is the option for really increasing your workout's effectiveness with the high intensity moves.

191340,5,1573309966,One of the best cardio workout videos ever made.  I have nearly 50 exercise videos I've purchased over the past 20 years and The Power Step Workout is one of the top 5 I reach for over and over again when I want to feel as though I've had a good workout.  If you don't want a 45 minute workout you can do the warmup and the first or second workouts.  Or mix and match different segments on different days. It's segmented to fit your fitness needs but each segment gradually increases the pace. You don't even need the step although using one provides greater cardiovascular benefit.  The cueing is excellent and the routines easy to learn.  The music is great without being distracting.  I think you'll really feel energized with the small group while you work out.  I think you also will return to this video again and again. Your heart and body will thank you.  Kathy Smith knows how to make a great video.  This video proves why she's one the best in the exercise video business.,1027641600,26,982,4.441340782122905

I have 13 videos in my current rotation and, when I want a kick-butt step workout, I pop Kathy Smith Power Step in my VCR.  The video includes an 8:30 warmup, 3 12-minute segments of step aerobics from beginner to advanced (one can fast-forward to the cool down after any segment if they are a beginner or hard-pressed for time), and a 5-minute cool down.  The video combines air-borne moves (getting both feet off the step in little jumps) with traditional step aerobics to give you a more intense workout and burn more calories.  I do not have the spring-board step that Smith uses.  I use the Original Step and have no problems at all.  Each segment is high-energy and a lot of fun.  The final step segment uses the step turned vertically which gives variety to the workout.  Kathy Smith is also one of the best aerobics instructors.  Her directions are so good that, after using this tape a few times, one can actually complete the moves without having to watch the screen (which makes it easier to maintain proper body alignment). She also mirrors her instructions (when she says ""left"" she means YOUR ""left"") which is always a plus.

The routines (that are anything BUT routine) build upon each other and become more fun, more difficult, more unique and more effective as you exercise.
I did this tape without the special springboard step, but it was still a lot of fun and a lot of work.  The best part about the tape is that you can really notice your progress each time you exercise.  Each day you're able to push yourself a little further; it's very motivating.  Different moves and plyometrics keep you on your toes.
The industrial-type set is unlike any in her other videos; however, the music is pretty much the same as in her others.  The cool down well deserved.  Great for getting lean and heart healthy.",1002499200,15,857,4.635761589403973
