I was laughing the whole movie.
The movie is basically about some crooks who are in debt to some gang leader and they hire their own ""representation"" to deal with the gang leaderer. They end up hiring a struggling stunt actor who thinks he is getting hired for a new movie. His big break!! And the crooks have him deal the the gang leader thinking the whole thing is fake. The ending has a really great twist. Definately recommend it. I'm looking for it in English now.... Help me!!",1248998400,,645,4.338842975206612
