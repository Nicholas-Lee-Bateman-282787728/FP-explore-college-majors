7071746,4,B00UW448UM,"Very well done moody thriller.  I agree the protagonist was not likeable.  Rather the movie seemed to me a tense story of a man losing it because he couldn't nderstand what was happening. Great acting, beautifully shot, an intelligent film.",1446249600,2,240,4.975
7071747,2,B00UW448UM,"I was looking forward to a good movie from BBC. Instead, I felt like I was watching a Lifetime movie. There was no real flow to the sequences of events and the main male character I did not care for from the get-go. Other people really liked the film and the ending was somewhat unique.

However, to me it was not worth the money I spent. It just should have been a free of charge movie that way the only thing I would have wasted was my time.",1446076800,2,443,4.034090909090909
7071748,5,B00UW448UM,"Blackwood is an excellent, intriguing movie that kept me guessing and trying to solve the twisty mystery right along with the story's protagonist. It is too good to give away any spoilers! IT is worth buying and collecting. True to the BBC excellence in film, it is not a cheap, brainless, hacker/slasher movie. This movie makes you a detective trying to solve a very puzzling mystery that takes you on an adventure.  The acting is solid ,very well done ,very  professional. the story is solid too. The music and the atmosphere are haunting and other worldly . It engages you right from the start. The only thing I would have changed is I think that if they had set the story in the 19th century or early 20th century that the story would have more impact because the story would have been that much stranger. The period costuming and sets that the BBC does so very well would have added to this movie. H.G. Wells could have written this story. As soon as it end ,you will want to watch it all from the beginning again to follow the clues.
I,m glad I bought this gem of a movie.",1445817600,12,1078,4.4120603015075375
7071749,3,B00UW448UM,"Without the unexpected twist, I'd of given this movie a lower rating. The trouble is in the script. The acting is decent, but the main character's character is so horrid it ruins the film. You don't really care what happens to him.  Also, there were a lot of ways this movie could have presented; interesting sub-plots went nowhere, but the twist... that was good. Definitely worth a watch.",1444867200,5,390,4.735294117647059
7071750,3,B00UW448UM,"Professor Ben Marshall (Ed Stoppard) has had some pyschological issues that appear to be in the past. He starts lecturing at a new university and has acquired the old estate Blackwood where he lives with his wife Rachel (Sophia Myles) and son Harry (Isaac Andrews). Ben starts to see and hear things and wonders if he is having a relapse or is he seeing ghosts. Ben become obsessed with the ghosts and believes he has the answer in an unsolved murder.

I admit the film did give an unexpected twist. The problem was the characters were not overly likeable, especially Ben the main character. The story had no real protagonist, a mystery, and a ghost story that wasn't horrifying.

Guide: No nudity. 3 F-bombs. Attempted rape. Not a bad story, but I would rather watch ""The Shining"" for the umpteenth time.",1426982400,5,805,4.702127659574468

7071754,2,B00UW448UM,"The premise was intriguing -- as a lover of the supernatural genre, I'm always looking for something different than ""three bored teens spend the night in a haunted house and find evil"".  Unfortunately, the star was wrong for the part.  He came off stilted and ineffective.  Too bad!  The kid, however, was terrific!",1453161600,4,315,4.886792452830188

7071756,2,B00UW448UM,"There are just too many of the haunted house type of horror, but this movie showed some promise. However, that was in the first hour or so.
A professor moves his family into a depressing looking house called ""Blackwood"". Disturbing things start happening, which prompts him to begin researching which becomes an obsession, effecting his marriage and his relationship with his young son. I was getting suspicious of the village priest, then the mentally disturbed young man, and got interested. But unfortunately, the movie sinks in the mire of long, drawn out scenes and the ending was terrible. Can't recommend, even though it was well acted.",1449273600,,643,5.0754716981132075

8708575,5,B00UW448UM,"This movie was. So. Good. I love Ed Stoppard, so I was super excited to give this movie a go. It was suspenseful without too much build up at once. The acting was amazing. It's visually pleasing and the soundtrack was perfect. The ending blew me away! I thought I had it all figured out half way through the movie. I was so ready for the big reveal and all my predictions to come true, but it threw me for a loop! It was absolutely perfect!",1512691200,,440,4.127906976744186
