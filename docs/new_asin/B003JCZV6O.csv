I once met Jock [Jock-O] Mahoney very casually and I wish that his warm personality would have shone through a little more strongly in this 1962 film. Still, he was a superb actor and as Tarzan, I think he made his mark pretty effectively. Sadly, Jock alone was not enough to overcome the pedestrian writing (by Robert Hardy Andrews and Director John Guillermin) for this particular entry.

THE STORY: Tarzan travels to India and is prevailed upon by a beautiful Indian Princess to save a large herd of wild elephants (Yes! They are in fact Indian Elephants!) which are trapped in a valley where a dam is being constructed. The chief engineer over the dam project is a bunghole supreme who doesn't care what animals or people get creamed, drowned, or otherwise snuffed so long as the project is completed on time. Thus, Tarzan takes on nuisance critters (a rogue elephant which teaches the herd very bad manners, a nasty cobra which ultimately gets taken on by a mongoose, and so on) along with battling the wheels of White Man's progress. *Jai* the Elephant Boy (playing himself) serves as Tarzan's *Boy* for this film. Leo Gordon and Mark Dana co-star.

The film offers its superior points. The producers were smart enough to take on a large contingent of Indian actors and crew (the movie was shot on location in India) which lends to the overall credibility of the work. As I mentioned, Mahoney certainly generated a poster Tarzan. The terrific ambiance of Ken Jones' excellent sixty-ish filmscore rivals that of the marvellous composition package of Henry Mancini in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hatari/dp/B00005JSGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hatari!</a>. Finally, the film was shot in Metrocolor and Cinemascope (a letterbox presentation) althought it is clear that the source print for this DVD has suffered a color shift, giving in somewhat to browns and reds -- but given the fabulous scenery and camera work, it's good enough.

Don't look for anything notable in regard to the DVD packaging -- it meets the bare minumum standards for the industry with no liner notes, just a short descriptive blurb on the back of the DVD case.

If you're a big Tarzan fan you'll definitely want to catch this one. Hopefully, we'll also soon see the official release of the three Tarzan films (starring Mike Henry) where the jungle man pretty much saves South America (you can obtain grey market DVDs of these public domain films of varying quality on E-bay.)",1280707200,9,2605,5.0488372093023255
4129488,4,B003JCZV6O,"1962's ""Tarzan Goes to India"" is a significant film in the 'Tarzan' series for several reasons; it marked the first film as Tarzan for 43-year-old American actor/stuntman Jock Mahoney, the oldest actor to debut in the role; it was writer/director John Guillermin's second 'Tarzan' film, after 1959's ""Tarzan's Greatest Adventure"", universally praised as the film that turned the franchise around; and it was filmed entirely on location in India, without the usual stock footage 'fillers' or interior scenes shot in England or Hollywood. Despite a rather tight budget, producer Sy Weintraub created a rich adventure tale with hundreds of extras, magnificent settings, and extraordinary footage of Indian elephants both at rest and in a climactic stampede. The film does have flaws; the juvenile 'discovery', Jai the Elephant Boy, quickly becomes annoying, the plot meanders, and often seems more a travelogue than a jungle adventure, the characters are pure stereotypes, and Mahoney, despite a more 'realistic' look and far greater acting skills than his predecessor, Gordon Scott, never achieves the kind of charm that made the younger actor so popular in the role.

The entire concept of Tarzan was being reinvented with this film...no longer territorial to his African domain, he was now a globetrotting adventurer, diving from planes into exotic locales, a sophisticated troubleshooter who happened to wear a loincloth as his uniform. Gone were Cheeta, Jane, and the jungle split-level; Tarzan was more of a loner than ever, yet was far more accessible to people than he'd been during the ""Me, Tarzan"" days. Weintraub, who was a fan of Burroughs' original conception of Tarzan, felt that Gordon Scott's heavily-muscled physique was too obviously the product of weight training, and hoped to replace him with the lean, if somewhat hirsute young Sean Connery, who'd played a villain in ""Greatest Adventure"". Unfortunately, Connery, who was actually interested in the role, was tapped to play James Bond; Jock Mahoney, who was the villain in the following production, 1960's ""Tarzan the Magnificent"", despite being a decade older than what Weintraub wanted, had the right 'look', and a great history (he'd actually tested to replace Johnny Weissmuller in 1948, but had been beaten out by Lex Barker, at that time). For two films, Mahoney would help rewrite the Tarzan saga.

8398016,4,B003JCZV6O,This Tarzan movie is great! The idea that Tarzan can be called for help all around the world is fine. The best is Tarzan himself. Played by at that time 42 years old Jock Mhoney he is the closest to Burrough's Tarzan. No more grumbling and umba-umba talk but a sophisticated Tarzan with body not build in a fitness-room but build by many years as Hollywoods top stunt man. The print is fine.,1472860800,,391,4.36986301369863
8398017,3,B003JCZV6O,"Fortunately, this Tarzan is more like the Tarzan Burroughs created in his books. It is a well-written story, but fraught with inaccuracies. Elephants are NOT lead by a dominant male, but by the dominant matriarch and her daughters, grand-daughters and great-grand-daughters. Oh, and Jock Mahoney does NOT look like Tarzan. He may have been an athlete, but not a bodybuilder. How could a man who could climb/swing through trees not look like a bodybuilder?",1468713600,,455,5.162162162162162
