8197310,5,B000QTD5Y8,"This film, long unavailable in any form until this Mexican DVD release, is considered one of Emilio Fernandez's ten most classic works.  Amongst the Mexican cineaste elites, this is generally considered his most important work.  Thus it leaves expectations quite high.

About the time this film was produced, in 1949, the war was well over and government film subsidies (especially from the USA) were drying up.  After working with a huge budget for La Perla (1946-47), Fernandez was now faced with serious budgetary austerity.  Many believe that caused him to focus even more intensely on the little things, making this one of his most special films.

For starters, El Indio cast his girlfriend and frequent supporting actress Columba Dominguez in the lead.  There are a number of famous stills of her from this film, which are just stunning (available in artsy coffee table books at finer Mexican bookshops).  The setting appears to be in a rural area of eastern Mexico state, where Fernandez and Figueroa do a fine job of incorporating the famous Mexican volcanoes into a number of background shots.  Several awkward situations followed by long silences also give the film a haute culture touch, which is somewhat early in expression as well as uncommon for a Fernandez/Figueroa film.

I once read in an online review that you can't really judge a film until you have seen it three times; something about the variability of your mood, attention level, and expectations.  Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I did not find the film too impressive on first viewing.  I noticed a number of situations that seemed poorly acted or in need of a second cut, especially with the village extras.  And I just didn't feel satisfied at the end.  Oddly, on a second viewing I didn't seem bothered by those things at all, and I found even more to appreciate in the film's ending, both for it's meaning and visual power.  I still need to watch it a third time.

Regarding this import DVD, I own it and it DOES play just fine on American Region 1 DVD players.  The image and sound quality are average to good for a film of this vintage, but unfortunately none of these newer release Alter's Collection DVDs from Televisa have subtitles.  They seem to have cheapened them down just a bit since the first wave of them were released, not only by cutting all the subtitles but on the packaging and artwork as well.  That said, if you can speak Spanish and enjoy classic cinema this is a must-buy as to date it is unavailable in any other form.",1193961600,3,2533,4.742009132420091
