338245,3,6301454308,"Bit by bit by bit, he carved a nightmare! In a quiet Los Angeles apartment complex, a deranged handyman savagely murders ""immoral"" women with the tools of his trade: claw-hammers, screwdrivers, power drills and even a deadly nail gun! But these gruesome murders are just the beginning of this landmark epic of violence and depravity that was vilified by critics, banned by censors, and treasured by splatter fans worldwide! Four breasts. Nine corpses. Claw hammer to the brainpan. Nailgun attack. Implied rape. Self-gratification. Pepsi spilling. One human torch. Improper use of scissors. Gratuitous radio evangelist. Our friendly neighborhood serial killer reasons, ""The best are always taken when they're young. I think maybe God wants it that way. Because the world would ruin them."" And later he howls, ""YOU DIRTY, FILTHY FORNICATOR!!!""  All in all, it's a little to intense for some, but it's funnier than it is scary. 3 stars definately.",1055635200,2,944,5.251655629139073
338246,4,6301454308,"This infamous little slasher flick with the infamous little title is a full... of blood, violence, and nudity. It is everything you expect from something of this ilk.
Supposedly based on a true story, four women in an apartment building are brutally murdered by items normally found in a toolbox. The killer (and the film makers do not hide this fact) is Cameron Mitchell, the building owner. Mitchell is a religious [person]who recently lost his daughter in a car accident. He then begins punishing ""sinful"" women.
...The last third of the film sees the deaths of two major characters, and wraps things up nicely with the end credits crawl describing what happened to the ""survivors"" of this ""real life"" crime spree.
Although rated (R), this is some very violent stuff. The first half hour, when the majority of the crimes take place, is unpleasant. Two of the first four victims die,... including the now infamous murder of the model taking a bath.
The video copy I have of this is awful. The sound is scratchy, the colors bleached out...and it is fantastic. I felt like I was watching something on a screen at a drive-in,...The blood flows freely, and the murders are punctuated by some truly bizarre country and love tunes.
... The film makers... build up a subplot between Ferdin and Beauvy's mom and the standard driven police detective that never pans out, or is resolved.
Ferdin and Eure were mainstays on television in the 1970's... They do well,considering the material.
... Donnelly's direction is pretty basic, a camera shadow can be seen here and there. Gary Graver, the cinematographer, is known as Orson Welles' cameraman later in the great director's career. Graver seems to have made a career of this kind of film, his involvement usually sets you up for what to expect.
I cannot explain why I am recommending this film. Genre fans might appreciate the gore effects, and the reputation this film now celebrates. This is a serial killer film before the term ""serial killer"" was coined. The events are so watchable, however. This is not ""Scream"" or ""Urban Legends,"" this is the type of film that no more motive than to scare and disgust its viewer. If that is all they wanted to do, they succeeded. I recommend this.
This is rated (R) for very strong physical violence, some sexual violence, very strong gore, mild profanity, very strong female nudity, sexual content, and adult situations.",1023062400,15,2405,4.868292682926829

338331,3,6301454308,"Interesting.  Almost, but not quite, a slasher flick due to the fact that the killings abruptly end and suddenly the movie turns into a kidnapping case.  The action sequences are on the clunky side of absurd as most of the victims make little attempt to evade the killer.  Instead, they flail about, as though reluctant to run, movement that looks overly choreographed.  Only the woman facing the nail-gun bothers to put up a fight.  The set pieces are the tool usage; they didn't let the plot get in the way of that.  And then they turned overly timid, killing two male characters off screen.  Its later, when they attempted to rationalize the murders, that things got more than a little silly.  Its definitely an oddity.  It could have used 100 more rewrites (the dialog is atrocious) and a reputable acting coach.  And someone with a semblance of style.  A decent camera operator would have been appreciated.

338336,3,6301454308,"For some reason this film rates high amongst gore aficionados but I couldn't fathom what they see in this snooze fest. It starts out promising enough. The killer dispatches a few girls and they don't skimp on the blood or nudity. In fact the film's only real highlight is porn star Kelly Nichols, whose bathtime near the beginning of the film is ruined when she is unceremoniously dispatched with a nail gun. But that song. Ugh. If I neverhear that song again it will be too soon. After 30 minutes or so of unrelenting bloodshed, the film turns into a bad TV movie mystery. I've been more on the edge of my seat watching Barnaby Jones. Instead of killing her. the killer kidnaps a young innocent girl, for reasons revealed later, and it's up to her brother to rescue her. He brings along about zero charisma, no acting skills and that guy from the Land of the Lost, Wesley Eure, who not only ends up being the killer's nephew but also ends up setting him on fire in a 'What the heck?!?!' moment that had me scratching my head. Well that came out of nowhere. A bunch of non-sensical twists and turns try to build tension but even more dull moments ensue and then at the end they inform you that it was based on true events. Uh huh. Cameron Mitchell is wasted in this dud. I always liked the poster but the movie bored me. I have nothing bad to say about Kelly Nichols. She's one of my top ten actresses in the adult genre so it was cool to see her in a somewhat mainstream flick. I'm not saying, ""Don't watch it"" but there are plenty of films in this genre or from this era that are not a chore to suffer through.",1473292800,,1612,4.288524590163934

338436,3,6301454308,"""THE TOOLBOX MURDERS"" is certainly one of the strangest and disturbing little ""cult"" favorites,that has still managed to gain a large following! how or why,still remains to be fully understood here,but this 1977 Cal-Am Production,is still a Big Question mark! under the direction of Dennis Donnelly,who had moved-on to bigger pastures,directing episodes of ""THE A-TEAM"" among his credentials,this 1978 release really wasn't a big box office hit,although it was shown in a number of Theatres,it quickly faded into obscurity,until it was officially released on videocassette by VCI in the early 1980s. but the main course of this movie,was about a deranged killer,who murdered ""sinful women"" with a variety of tools-hardly the stuff that would inspire the likes of ""Jason Vorhees"",or the ""HALLOWEEN"" franchise,which also originated in 1978. but despite its violent ""gore"",the only really big notice of this movie,was its key players,,two of which,were known stars of Saturday morning TV,and the main actor,Cameron Mitchell,best remembered for his 1967-1971 NBC-TV Western,""THE HIGH CHAPARRAL"",who played the religiously fanatical murderer-kidnapper,who abducts Pamelyn Ferdin,who plays ""Laurie Ballard"",is tied to a bed,listening to the rants of Mitchell's disturbing and murderous behavior,while even accosting his victim with the ""Sometimes,I Feel Like a Motherless Child"" singing,which in itself,was as brutal,as all the killings that he did! then,we have the killer's nephew,played by ""LAND OF THE LOST"" co-star,Wesley Eure,who would go on to star in another strange disaster called ""C.H.O.M.P.S."" in 1979,which is a whole other story! then Eure's charecter,goes mildly psycho,after killing his murderer uncle,and resorts to raping poor Pamelyn Ferdin,who,after a highly suggested scene in the aftermath,becomes a murderer herself,being justified by her being raped,after hearing how her brother (Nicholas Beauvy) was also killed! so in general,
""THE TOOLBOX MURDERS"" was something of a luke warm slasher flick,that used actors,who were WAY better,then the intentions of this strange and tragic movie! it almost plays out,like a made for TV movie-but the graphic murder scenes,,especially watching Kelly Nichols being killed by a Nail Gun,
after the killer watches her masturbate,was likely about THE only R-Rated content that the movie used,which still didn't quite make the grade,here-but
still,a noble try! Pamelyn Ferdin,who was one of Hollywood's finest child and teen actresses of her time,sure must've needed the money,to work in this
kind of movie,,but she and Cameron Mitchell are no strangers to each other,as the child actress guest starred on ""THE HIGH CHAPARRAL"",and even
worked as guest stars,of an ABC Movie of The Week called ""THE DELPHI BUREAU"" in 1972,which was a series' pilot,shown as part of the ""rotating format"" called ""THE MEN"" in Fall 1972. so on my scale of one to ten,i give ""THE TOOLBOX MURDERS a Three star rating,only because of the talented actors,who worked on this film-the people like Aneta Corseaut,Evelyn Guerrero,Tim Donnelly,likely related to the director,but uncertain! but this movie was also a first for Pamelyn Ferdin,who is best known as the voice of ""Lucy"" in CBS's ""CHARLIE BROWN"" TV specials in the late 60s,as well as starring in two Saturday morning TV shows,""CURIOSITY SHOP"" for ABC-TV in Fall 1971,and ""SPACE ACADEMY"" for Filmation Studios and CBS in Fall 1977,among her lengthy and impressive credentials! this movie isn't for everybody,but you need great patience to sit through it,if one feels the need to do so!",1430524800,,3567,5.583025830258302
338437,5,6301454308,"DVD Review: The Blue Underground version has an audio commentary with Pamelyn Ferdin and others, an interview with the chick who got naked and ran around in her apartment like a moron and other crap.

Movie Review: The film begins as some masked psycho is killing people with tools. Then he kidnaps some stupid broad and pretends she is his niece or daughter or some s***. The end. The film does start off as a slasher flick but then converts into a psychological thriller and I loved it. The story was really good and the blood was happy fun. However, I hated that douche bag with the big nose. He almost ruined this movie with his whining and his mentally deficient sensibilities and his ugly f*****g face. The rest of the cast was good, however. I enjoyed this one A LOT!!!

338508,4,6301454308,"Opening with a series of nasty kills, The Toolbox Murders (1978) features a masked killer prowling through an apartment complex, employing various hand tools as the instruments of murder.  Things change at about the halfway point, when the killer abducts a young girl, and makes her the object of his dark fantasy.  Much more will be revealed, so stop here if you do not want the movie spoiled.

This cult classic directed by Dennis Donnelly grabs you by the throat from the start, as a young woman is attacked in her apartment, and killed with a cordless drill.  Another woman is surprised at her front door, slapped unconscious, and has her skull caved in by a claw hammer.  When a friend of the girl unexpectedly walks into the apartment, she gets a screwdriver to the belly.  The highlight of the killing spree is the murder of a red headed woman (Marianne Walter) who is in the bathtub.  The killer chases the naked woman around the apartment before killing her with a nail gun.  Not yet done, the masked man enters another apartment, and grabs teenager Laurie Ballard (Pamelyn Ferdin).

In response to the carnage, police Detective Jamison (Tim Donnelly, Emergency TV series) is assigned to the case.  Jamison a passive and not very competent policeman, questions Vance Kingsley (Cameron Mitchell), the owner of the building, and the girl's mother Joanne Ballard (Aneta Corsaut), and Laurie's brother Joey (Nicolas Beauvy), but makes absolutely no progress towards locating the missing girl, or finding the perpetrator of the massacre.

The response by the police is woefully inadequate, and at a certain point they are completely out the picture, as somewhat surprisingly, the identity of the murderer is revealed about midway through the film.  The killer has young Laurie tied up to the bed in his dead daughter's bedroom, engaged in a fantasy that his ""little girl"" has returned.  Matters become more twisted when Laurie's brother Joey, and Kent Kingsley (Wesley Eure), the building owner's nephew get involved, leading to some shocking revelations, and more bloody violence.

The Toolbox Murders opens with the style and atmosphere of a giallo, with some ruthless and brutally realistic kills.  The film shifts into a completely different gear, and becomes more of a psychological thriller, after the killer is revealed, and Joey and Kent begin poking their noses into the case.  The film finishes with some outrageous acts, unfortunately they are not as smoothly executed as the kills at the start of the film.  These clumsy scenes, coupled with other acts of violence that are not shown explicitly on screen, kind of blunts the movie's overall impact, although The Toolbox Murders remains a classic in exploitation cinema.

Colorful Cameron Mitchell (1918-1994), a versatile actor who usually played heavies, particularly in his later years, comes through with another campy and overdramatic performance.  Wesley Eure, kind of a Gregg Brady lookalike, gives a similar campy performance as his character undergoes an unexpected change.  Pamelyn Ferdin, a very well-known child actress in the 60's and 70's, is quite good as Laurie, an intelligent girl who tries to play to the killer's delusions, and then does what is necessary to survive.  This is a very atypical role for Ferdin, who mostly worked on TV, and was the voice of Lucy on some of the Peanuts specials.  She apparently agreed to do the film, partly because of her good experiences working with Cameron Mitchell, when she guest starred on his TV series ""The High Chaparral"".

The DVD includes a commentary track with producer Tony Didio, DP Gary Graver, and Pamelyn Ferdin.  It's a feel good type affair, with complements for Ms. Ferdin, and lots of stories about Cameron Mitchell.  There are some interesting anecdotes, unfortunately some of them have absolutely nothing to do with the film, as the focus seems to stray a bit too often.  More on topic is a short interview with Marianne Walter, who's brief but very erotic and memorable death scene, is one of the film's highlights.

The Toolbox Murders is warped in a variety of ways, although its impact does fade as the story moves to the conclusion, it is still quite disturbing and powerful.  The film would be remade in 2004, with Tony Didio again as producer, and Tobe Hooper directing, what would be a much different story.",1333929600,3,4357,5.005547850208044
338509,3,6301454308,"The original Toolbox Murders was a bona-fide guilty pleasure back in the 70s, and it remains so to this very day.  What happens when a handyman goes on a murderous rampage through an LA apartment complex, taking out ""immoral"" women?  Plenty of blood, gore, and nudity that's what!  For what it is, The Toolbox Murders is an exercise in inventive slasher movie perceptions.  It offers some decent examples of bloody brutality, yet also manages to be as cheesy as it is sleezy.  In those regards, it's worth seeing if you've never seen it before, or have only seen the Tobe Hooper remake that came out a few years back.  Blue Underground managed to produce another standout Blu-Ray disc, which features the film in a silky smooth transfer and intriguing extras including an insightful commentary track, a documentary/retrospective, and the usual assortment of trailers and TV spots to round things out here.",1327190400,6,905,4.960264900662252

If the murders depicted in this movie were to take place in REAL LIFE it would be HORRIBLE.Thankfully they just happen in the movie Not in Real life. This movie is condemned because of the nail gun murder scene,but if you watch the interview with Kelly Nichols(The nail gun vctim),she and Cameron Mitchell had a good time filming the sequence. While this picture is no OSCAR contender,the acting of Pamelyn Ferdin as a teenager(She was 19 in real life)bound and gagged by Cameron Mitchell's character is very realistic for the situation her character was in. I have to say courtesy of this movie I admire Pamelyn Ferdin as an actress and as an animal rights activist. I looked up her website. For a laugh watch the scene where Cameron Mitchell brings dinner and a lollipop to Pamelyn Ferdin. LO,double L I POP spells lollipop. I gave this movie 5 stars but A MAKING OF""THE TOOLBOX MURDERS""and A Behind the scenes look at THE TOOLBOX MURDERS""would have been nice.

I still like this film, but if you want a film that meets contemporary slasher film standards, it may not be for you.  I give it 3 stars but I understand whu some reviewers assign a lower rating.

The tranfer is visually stunning.  They claim to have started with the original negative.  I believe them.  Some film grain is visible, but it never overwhelms the picture.  The soundtrack is 7.1, but there is almost no use of the surrounds.  The original soundtrack was mono.  They have managed to present a decent stereo image and we can't really expect much more from a mono soundtrack.  Some good effort was put into the menus. There are some decent extras.

338566,4,6301454308,"A handyman goes berserk and murders women he judges as immoral or bad.  He uses the tools of his trade: screwdrivers, claw-hammers, a nail gun, and a power drill.  A simple plot for a grisly film that offers no real redeeming values.  But although this notorious 1978 grind-house title was roundly banned, censored, vilified and damned - there are those who see it as a cinematic exercise not only of the First Amendment, but also an opportunity for the release of pent-up anger and frustration.  But is it art?  Or does it fuel the rage of psychopaths until they act out?  What can one say about vicariously experiencing the torture and murder of women as entertainment?  Can you say the same thing about Hitchcock's ""Psycho""?

Camereron Mitchell stars in this cult sickie (for some, that's high praise).  Look for former child star Pamela Ferdin and adult film star Kelly Nichols aka Marianne Walter.

This classic exploitation film still shocks and can be ""enjoyed"" now in a true hi-def, uncensored transfer that has been newly remastered from the original negative.

Extras include a amazing audio commentary with producer Tony DiDio, cinematographer Gary Graver and actor Pamela Ferdin.  The story of the making of the film is more interesting than the film itself.  A featurette aptly titled ""I Got Nailed in the Toolbox Murders"" is a memorable interview with adult star Marianne Walter.

Few film posters have so clearly advertised the intent and content of the movie it heralds - and delivers.

This film is not for everyone.  Maybe not for anyone but exploitation film scholars, misogynists and psychiatrists.",1267660800,5,1618,5.00374531835206

 Made in 77' Its the story of a man that goes crazy and starts killing people in a apartment complex. All of his victums seem to be women. He just helps himself into there house and takes his toolbox with him and cuts them up using the tools in his toolbox. Thats pretty much the whole movie
 Like I said good movie but I would recommend ""Slumber Party Massacre."" I think that is a better slasher movie. It is alot like Toolbox Murders. This movie is a Blue Underground film.

338568,5,6301454308,"The Toolbox murders is by far one of my favorite's of the NASTY genre. It hit theatres the same time as the Texas Chainsaw Masacre and it was reported to be meaner in violence. Today it is relitivly tame, but there are some things that make this a classic. One is the Nail Gun scene, and two the fact that he's a religous fanatic killing people because of their sins. Not to mention he kidnaps his neisce and mistakes her as his dead daughter. The problem I have with Blue UnderGround is that it wouldn't play properly on my DVD machine. I heard that there might have been a pressing error on it or it could just have been that my player was a crappy Apex. Either way it would be nice to have this be fixed or Anchor Bay release a better copy of it. I'm not saying it was Blue UnderGround's fault. Don't get me wrong I have some other films released by them, but I hated getting rid of this film because it wouldn't play during a scene.

It makes you think that you're watching a good exploitation/slasher film. However, after that first half hour the movie takes a completely different direction. It becomes a dull psychological drama. There are no more toolbox murders. No more nudity. Just a bunch of boring dialogue that's often lame as well. Also, I have to point out that this movie was remade a few years back by Tobe Hooper. Hooper's movie is far better and really isn't anything like this one. You should watch that one instead since I would give that 4/5. I can only give this one 2/5, and that's just for the first thirty minutes. After that, you should just turn it off if you value your time.",1250294400,3,774,4.575539568345324

And a bunch of other crazy gumbo.

The film has an interesting feel to it and gruesome murders, the movie was criticized as a woman-hating piece of filth by femminest and critics alike but it was a popular hit at drive-in theaters and grindhouse theaters. It's a very sleazy and gory as hell slasher flick that plays also as a character study and does have funny elements such as a funny song that plays during the murder of a woman in the tub with a nail-gun.

338571,2,6301454308,"The first half hour of this film has pretty much most of the violence. And surprise surprise most ( actually all ) of the victims are young women at this stage. Another 14 year old girl is taken hostage in the killers house where it's revealed that it's a 50+ year old man who is on a revenge mission for the death of his daughter. The 14 year old girl has the unenviable position of a) looking like his dead daughter b) being tied to a bed. When he explains why he is killing these women ( most of whom are stunningly attractive ) he says because the women of today "" do things which they shouldn't - they're filled with filth."" Which doesn't really make sense at all for the seemingly random killings that he carried out. OK the last one may have some suggestion as to why he did it but you'd still be hard pressed to think of that as a motif because it just doesn't add up. The rest of the film laboriously plods on as we try out the detective whodunnit done by 19 year old guys who're suspicious. If you felt uncomfortable in your seat thinking "" Come on damn it end for Chrissakes,"" you would not be alone. It's tedious and well the movie just begs to be finished off quicker. In the ending it certainly springs a surprise or two. Very effective I might add to. One guy dousing his friend and the entire garage with petrol and setting the garage on fire after his friend finds out the truth about the who is the killer. After that it kinda gets really creepy which I'll let you watch without spoiling it. Needless to say it is a pretty good ending. By the way I wouldn't believe that true story nonsense or at least if it is true the director made a complete hash of the whole thing.

However in spite of all that, I still rate it two stars because it is deeply misogynistic, the middle part of the film is horrendously slow to the point of crashing to a halt and the whole film does not strike me as believable. The film is riddled with nonsense which doesn't add up. A shame really, it had all the ingredients for a good movie but you can never trust descriptions fully.",1120089600,4,2077,4.21859296482412

338574,4,6301454308,"Back in the day Phil Donahue devoted an entire show to violent films and their alleged harmful effects, focusing mainly on The Toolbox Murders.  This type of horror film was still quite new at the time, Halloween still being a year away and Friday The 13th three years away.  I can understand how Phil and Co. thought this was appalling at the time, but any hardcore horror fan will say, ""what's all the fuss about?""  Actually I'm surprised they singled this out and didn't devote the hour to Last House On The Left.  I guess Phil didn't watch that one.  Imagine his reaction if he saw Cannibal Holocaust!  Anyhow, as you'll read in other reviews, people really think this is a stinker.  Most of these folks are young horror fans exposed to this film for the first time since it recently got a dvd release expecting an all out bloodbath coz of the film's reputation.  Yeah, if you have those expectations I can almost guarantee you'll walk away disappointed.  the actual ""toolbox murders"" occur from the getgo and go on for about a half hour or so, then we're done with the slasher flick portion of the film.  The film totally switches gears at this point, right after the killer abducts a fifteen year old girl.  Ya see, this guy feels he's doing God's work by killing women he finds immoral and dirty.  All victims are from the same apartment complex, and do cool stuff like dance in lingerie right in front of the window.  How come this never happens in my apartment complex?  Although I did hear a couple going at it last summer.  Anyhow, that's not important, back to the story.  He kidnaps this girl to save her from these evils, but also becomes convinced that she is his daughter who had died some years before.  I've seen this film a time or two before, so I know about the psycho-drama part of the film.  Quite frankly, I enjoy it.  Cameron Mitchell does an adequate job, looking like a psycho Tom Jones.  Lots of acting bashing here, but the scenes showing him and the girl in a father/daughter type mind game aren't too bad and even a bit disturbing at that.  Gore?  Confined to the first half hour mainly.  The murders aren't barf bag sick or anything, but unpleasant enough.  Don't hold your breath for the infamous nail gun scene, coz it's nothing to write home about.  The tub scene preceeding it is an attention getter, but if you see enough slasher films, the nail gun's not so shocking.  It's only famous coz it's a nail gun, which is something that had never been used in a horror film before.  I would recommend The Toolbox movies if you're a connoisseur of old horror and exploitation films.  It's a minor classic in it's own right, so what could it hurt to say you've seen it?  Once again Blue Underground's devotion to the restoration of crappy films comes through nicely here.  This film probably didn't look or sound this good upon it's original release!

338575,1,6301454308,"I'm a huge horror fan, and over the last few months I've been mowing through a backlog of exploitation and slasher flicks from the 70s and 80s, sometimes finding a few gems and other times a stinker. If a movie offers some decent gore and suspense (gratuitous nudity doesn't hurt), I'll usually forgive narrative lapses, bad acting, eye-rolling dialogue, etc. So when I rented ""Slumber Party Massacre"" and the gorehound at the video store recommended ""The Toolbox Murders,"" I was pretty excited, especially after watching the trailer and seeing it was loaded with hot naked chicks. This one could be a classic, I thought!

Boy, was I ever wrong.

""The Toolbox Murders"" fails on almost every level. The first 30 minutes or so feature about 4-5 murders in rapid succession with drill bits, a hammer, etc. These scenes are pretty poorly shot and most of the carnage happens off screen and is shown with blood splattering the masked killer. Tom Savini clearly didn't have anything to do with this one. There is some decent nudity, especially a bubble bath [...] death by nailgun scene. At this point, I figure that ""The Toolbox Murders"" is going to be a fun little sleazefest.

And then the movie just stops dead in its tracks when the killer is revealed and about an hour of the movie focuses on a girl he's kidnapped. This is when things go completely south. The toolbox murders at this point are over, and ""The Toolbox Murders"" turns into the cheesiest, most boring psycho-drama you've ever seen. The acting is abysmal; seriously some of the worst performances I've ever witnessed. There are two more murders, but neither are anything worth writing home about and one occurs entirely offscreen. There is no more nudity. We just have bad actors sitting in cheeseball 70s locales and delivering exposition that nobody cares about.

I've got a high tolerance for this kind of movie, but ""The Toolbox Murders"" was so inept and unforgivably boring that I considered turning it off about halfway through, and seriously regret renting it.",1099872000,9,2030,4.87536231884058

This film is very grisly and is still unavailable uncut in most places, apart from the states of course. After the opening sequences the film becomes a bit mundane and plods along extremely slowly developing into a kidnap drama with a psycho twist but Mitchell is superb and strangely - for an ex-cowboy - extremely believable as the tormentor, the rest of the acting is pretty appalling as you would come to expect from these types of movies but the gore scenes at the begginning are quite shocking, especially the nail-gun scenario.

338620,3,6301454308,"Most of the controversy surrounding ""The Toolbox Murders"" revolved around charges of misogyny rather than extreme gore. To that end, the infamous ""nail gun scene""--which was featured on ""60 Minutes"" and ""Donahue"" as an example of violence against women in film--is unsettling for its blend of eroticism and cold brutality, making the movie flirt with a snuff mentality. It's also one of the more groundbreaking scenes in splatter movies and the most effective scene in ""The Toolbox Murders."" Otherwise, the movie isn't any different from a whole host of other gore movies. It's better than most, with OK performances and a fair amount of technical proficiency for what it is, but there are few moments that are going to make much impact on today's jaded horror fans. Most of the murders occur in the first half of the movie, and while they're bloody, there have been more graphic scenes on ""ER."" In the movie's second half it pretends to be a mystery, even though you know who the murderer is within the first five minutes.
The DVD includes an 8-minute interview with Marianne Walter, who played the victim in the nail gun scene and who later, under the name Kelly Nichols, became ""an adult film actress."" (First the nail gun scene and then a porn star--Ms. Walter was just giving the feminists fits!) The commentary, by producer Tony Didio, director of photography Gary Graver and a VERY PERKY Pamelyn Ferdin, has some enlightening moments, but it gets redundant after about 30 minutes.
Ultimately, though, about the scariest thing in ""The Toolbox Murders"" is star Cameron Mitchell's facelift.",1081382400,12,1594,4.97378277153558
338621,3,6301454308,"""The ToolBox Murders"" is one of those films that has gained most of its notoriety because of it's title. The question for anyone new to watching it is, does it live up to the promise? Well the answer is yes, but only for the first 20 minutes. Pretty much as soon as the film starts, the viewer is treated to several murders featuring hammers, drills and screwdrivers, all in quick succession, and all of women. After a brief pause for breath, the film plays its trump card, the scene in which a woman is interrupted while taking a bath to be chased naked around her apartment by the killer, who this time is wielding a nail gun. This scene is by far the nastiest in the movie, even though the special effects are achieved very cheaply. Actually, goremongers may be upset to learn that most of the gore in the movie is delivered in a very cheap and poorly filmed way. The editing of the first batch of murders is terrible...it seems that only the nail gun murder had any kind of story boarding or professional editing done on it!
Sadly, there is worse to come, for after this eye-popping first half hour, the film grinds to a virtual standstill, as it is at this point that the murderer is revealed and the killings all but stop as the action turns to the detectives trying to solve the case, along with depicting the prolonged plight of a young girl who the murderer has kidnapped and is keeping bound and gagged at his home. This remainding section of the film just drags on and on, despite some laughs on offer from Cameron Mitchel as he pours his heart out to the terrified girl.
On that note, the rest of the acting talent on offer throughout the movie is also rock bottom bad, especially in some of the minor roles where performances reach almost H.G. Lewis standards! About the only exception to this is Pamelyn Ferdin as the unlucky final victim, who does manage to wring some believeability out of her plight, despite having to share screen time with Cameron Mitchell singing ""Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child.""...oh dear.
The DVD edition of the movie presents a great picture considering the quality of the film is pretty ropey at best. And there are some nice extras, including an interview with Kelly Nicholls, who suffered the nail gun murder. Its surprising that a film this poor has enough of an audience to deserve such a good DVD makeover, as it's strong points are few and far between. Strangely, all the murders are set to twee country music that seems to be playing out of every record player in the apartment block, something I have not often seen before. In fact, during the nail gun murder, this lends an almost surreal touch to the unfolding horror, leaving me to wonder if the effect was intentional or just decided on at random. That, and the seriously downbeat ending (quite effective in my opinion, at least for anyone who hasn't switched off before that time), are probably the only original touches to the movie which sadly fails in all other respects to come close to the style and quality of the countless better films it so obviously is trying to copy.",1081382400,5,3092,4.56294964028777
338622,3,6301454308,"What? Only one review for the ultra sleazy 1978 film ""The Toolbox Murders""? There must be some mistake because a lack of fulsome praise for this piece of junk is most surprising. Blue Underground, a DVD company formed by the director of such morally uplifting pieces of cinema like ""Uncle Sam"" and ""Maniac,"" William Lustig, knew a hit when they saw it and gave ""The Toolbox Murders"" star treatment. Of course, Blue Underground gives every schlock movie they release the works because they recognize there are enough viewers out there who appreciate this crud as much as they do. But ""The Toolbox Murders"" is junk, plain and simple. Scary? Nope. Gory? Not really. Engaging? No. The only value such films as this one have occurs when it inspires film censorship boards to have conniption fits, resulting in a whole lot of bad press that actually serves to make people remember it as a classic. I think this one eventually ended up on some sort of British ""video nasties"" restricted list until recently. That sounds impressive until you learn the same board banned Sam Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs."" Anyway, ""The Toolbox Murders"" probably never looked better than it does on DVD.
This film has a premise that sounds like a winner: a loony and his toolbox wreak an amazing amount of damage on the residents of a small apartment building somewhere in California. Even more amazing are the number of beautiful, vulnerable young women who live alone in these apartments. Using a nail gun, drill, screwdrivers, and almost anything else you can think of that might dwell in the confines of a toolbox, the killer moves from one abode to another with seeming abandon. That the killer eludes the prying eyes of the police and the local populace isn't that surprising. After all, a guy lugging around a box full of tools doesn't set off alarm bells. Whoever is inflicting fatalities in the area is causing no end of worry to those residents who have yet to receive a visit. The landlord, played by one time Hollywood up and comer Cameron Mitchell, also pops in from time to time in order to wring his hands over the carnage and promise to ratchet up security in the area. Still, the atrocities continue and fear hangs over the area like dark clouds of doom, a doom made even worse when the killer kidnaps a young girl in one of the apartments and carries her off to what could only be a fate worse than death.
Fortunately for every one involved, her brother is one of those pesky types who won't sit idly by when family members face danger. He teams up with a painter friend, who just happens to be the son of the landlord, and the two begin making tentative inquiries in an effort to solve the crimes and locate the missing sister. Who says kids are lazy and unmotivated? It is sad to say, but ""The Toolbox Murders"" doesn't provide any long-term motivation for America's youth to follow through on a murder investigation. As the kid finally discovers the killer's identity, one of those twists of fate only found in horror movies rears its ugly head and permanently discourages our young investigator with a splash of turpentine and a flaming match. It turns out that the killer's precious daughter died due to a lapse in morality with the result that father kind of lost it upstairs. The crimes are actually divinely inspired missions dedicated to rubbing out immorality wherever it pops up. The kidnapped girl isn't one of the murderer's targets, but rather a young lady who reminds him of his own dear, departed daughter. He doesn't want to hurt her but wants to keep her close by for intimate confessions about what he is doing to honor his daughter's memory.
""The Toolbox Murders"" is quite ridiculous. The producers even throw in a statement at the end about how this story really happened and how the kidnapped girl spent some time recovering in a mental asylum, etc. I cannot vouch for the veracity of these claims, but something tells me what we just saw in the preceding ninety or so minutes was something quite different from any real incident. It isn't that I have difficulty in believing some maniac somewhere attacked a young woman with a nail gun, or someone kidnapped a young girl because they made a weird association between a deceased daughter and a living person. I just refuse to believe this specific story. Announcing that ""real events inspired this horrific tale"" is a cheap marketing ploy used by Hollywood in an attempt to draw in a record number of ticket buying dupes. If you want real tragedy, turn on the evening news or sign up for a ride along with your local police department. If I thought this was a truthful reenactment for a second, I wouldn't watch it. Reality births enough horrors without seeing someone try and profit from actual human sorrow.
The acting, sets, special effects, and script definitely fall into the category of sub par, but a few things work to keep the plot moving along. Seeing Cameron Mitchell sell his soul for a paycheck is amusing and convinces me that even the worst role in a bad movie is light years better than actually working for a living. That scene where the redhead encounters the murderer during a moment of bliss is worth watching. Otherwise, I thought this movie was strictly average fare. If you do like the movie, Blue Underground includes a commentary track (!), an interview with the aforementioned redhead, trailers, and poster galleries. They even put the film in a widescreen format! Give it a shot if you like horror movies. Everyone else should pass.",1072569600,8,5516,4.728971962616822

For the price, the quality of the transfer is worth it for fans of the film.  As for the film itself, the title basically says it all.  In this viewer's opinion it's an above average slasher flick.  It COULD be taken seriously except for the fact that some of the victims just aren't trying hard enough to escape.

The man who thinks he's helping to rid the world of evil by killing all the sinful women in the apartment complex he owns.

I mean I have an almost sadistic pleasure in torturing myself with bad movie watching. Yet no matter how much I might like a movie that's clearly awful, I won't give it 5 stars for being a suck fest. Movies like Halloween might deserve 5 stars, but movies like this do not. It's deceiving towards people interested in checking this flick out, thinking it might be as good as people are hyping it up to be. Well it isn't. However, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen either. I'm glad I bought this flick, but remember I'm a bad horror movie fan.
The acting by the cops is awful at best. You can easily tell these guys knew little about police work or acting. The killer isn't too bad, though far from scary. By the end of the movie he's not even remotely menacing, but actually comes off as rather pathetic, due to some unusually good acting. It's kind of weird how the movie starts off with all the killing and rampant nudity, then turns itself into a semi normal low budget 70's horror flick. Usually I'm all for excess skin in horror, which is often the only redeeming quality. However this movie would have been better without the sexploitation, and might have even received a bigger cult following if it played on late night t.v. But the director kind of doomed himself with having the murderer killing only naked to mostly naked girls.

It then goes through a lengthy slow period involving a teen girl's kidnapping by the killer, who's identity will surprise no one. But I found that part interesting enough as it led to a violent climax.

The whole look of this film speaks of that low-budget atmosphere which pervaded in B movies before the video age burst upon us in the 80s. There is a feeling of dread and madness achieved here, even in Cameron Mitchell's overacting, that is unique to low-budget horror. But that does not detract from the moments of unintentional fun, as when a clueless cop, instead of being out looking for the kidnap victim, unsuccessfully asks her mother for a date!

Do not expect Academy Award acting or technical prowess here. But do expect a milieu that could only pervade in the low budget horror world, one which works well for those who appreciate such things. The acting ""styles"" fit right into this, as do the movie's slower pace and uncertain direction.

With even bloodier NO-budget horror films now being made in countless numbers and sold on the Internet, it is good to hark back to some of their roots, and this film certainly qualifies as one of those.

This one stands alone and is not to be confused with the unrelated Tobe Hooper ""remake"" or with any other similar title!",1481932800,,1451,4.811244979919679
