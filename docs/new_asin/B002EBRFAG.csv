8367522,5,B002EBRFAG,"This engrossing family documentary tells the story of a family from Laos who became separated during the war.  For collaborating with the enemy,  the father was sent to a re-education camp while the mother and her children were promised safety in America.  Although the family came to America, two daughters were left behind in Laos.

The film documents over 20 years in the American life of Thavisouk (Thavi) Phrasavath, who co-directed the film, his mother and their journey and struggle raising the children.

Anytime you can watch a film and feel and connect with it, the movie filmmakers have done a great job.  There is a nice, passive pace to the film with traditional and cultural images and it is described as poetic.  When Thavi or his mother speak, and the camera lingers on them, you can see the frustration, and feel their pain.

What is sad, is that as the kids were growing up, wanting to fit in with peers, Thavi and his mother were having a difficult time.  At one point, mother speaks about the lack of parental control over the teens, and she wants them to remember and feel the pain they endured during their early struggle,  She wants them to know what it was like when she begged for money,  and what they endured during the early years.

Unfortunately, that is not a part of their life anymore, they were too young.  But Thavi struggled with raising the kids too, and he shares his frustration too.

The documentary was nominated for an Academy Award in 2009, but it lost to Man on a Wire, from France.  Included is an insightful interview with the director.  There are extra scenes and more footage of that era in Laos.  There were some instances where I would have like to know more but don't want to reveal too much.  Excellent film, great storyline, well done..Rizzo",1420588800,,1793,4.6380952380952385

8367524,4,B002EBRFAG,"For over 20 years cinematographer Ellen Kuras collaborated with Thavisouk (Thavi) Phrasavath, a Laotian-born writer and film editor, to produce this film about betrayals.  One is the U.S. government's betrayal of Laotian soldiers who faithfully helped the U.S. carry out clandestine operations during the Viet Nam War and were then abandoned by the U.S.  The Laotian soldiers, including Thavi's father, became enemies in their own country.  When most of Thavi's family escaped to the U.S., Thavi's mother and eight of the ten children were separated from his father for years.  His father's marriage to another woman was another betrayal.  The family in the U.S. senses betrayal by the United States.  They had expected a ""heaven on earth"" in escaping their dangerous situation in Laos.  Instead they found themselves in a filthy, overcrowded neighborhood in Brooklyn, terrorized by crack addicts and gang members.  Thavi's mother, who had protected her large brood in a war-torn country, felt betrayed by them when they became like many American teens who disrespect their parents.  The film reveals a hidden aspect of American history through the personal experience of a displaced family, a courageous group that finally triumphs through their adversity.",1348617600,,1257,5.4051282051282055
8367525,5,B002EBRFAG,I think this is the only film of its type: about the immigration Of Laotians to the US after the SE Asian war.  The fact it follows their difficult adjustment process for 20 years is amazing.  I showed it to a group of Laotian elders who could identify with much of it.,1337817600,,269,4.153846153846154
8367526,4,B002EBRFAG,"Nerakhoon is the Laotian word for ""betrayed"". The movie is filmed in semi-documentary style but with a trained narrative that evokes the spirit of the Viet Nam nightmare as seen from the side of a humble Laotian family. As background we are told the tale of a Laotian prophecy warning the asian people of Laos that some day an Eagle will come and visit the country with great tumult. Thavi's father was in the Laotian military and was soon helping the CIA target communist forces in the jungle and villages for bombing. Thavi recounts horror stories of war and seeing villagers vaporized as they were riding their bikes and ""burned to white powder"". As a child, with a father in the army, he simply resigned himself to the fact this was life. The next phase comes and soon the US pulls out abruptly leaving those who assisted the US alone and on their own overnight. Soon the Pathet Lao descend and sort out who collaborated and send them to work camps to fill in huge B-52 bomb craters with small woven baskets. In the meantime Thavi and his family are left to fend for themselves.

  After escaping to Thailand Thavi, his mother, and family are lucky enough to be granted asylum in the US. Soon they are swooping in over the completely exotic landscape of New York City as the jet lands at night with a huge and stunning sea of lights beneath. Once there however, they find the emerald city of dreams they imagined soon turns out to be a classic modern Dickensian ordeal with the family entering a 1970's urban decay landscape with all its accompanying problems like crime, drugs, and poverty. The depravities and insensitivities the family faces in Brooklyn are shocking to the contemplative asians and the mother is immediately taken aback at what they encounter. Fellow Laotian refugees aid them but soon the mother regrets leaving Laos as her children become enculturated and the mother laments their flight from Laotian values. In short, she wonders if they hadn't traded away more than it was worth and begins to regret leaving Laos.

  The movie's dual symbolism is the ""betrayal"" of loyal Laotian fighters by the US after they pulled-out of Laos, but also in the betrayal of Thavi's family by the father who managed to escape the death camps and get to Florida where he soon created a new life and family. The sadness that pervades the movie is emphasized by betrayal at all passes as far as Thavi is concerned. He finally manages to locate his father but his father ignores them and returns to his new family. The main message is were it not for the prophecy of the great eagle Thavi and his family would have led more peaceful and productive lives back in the asian culture of jungley Laos with its Buddhist-type serenity.

  On a personal note I happened by accident to visit someone who by total coincidence had Thavi as a neighbor in suburban New York. We happened upon some fresh striped bass from the spring Hudson River run and Thavi volunteered for his wife to prepare it. She made a tasty, typically SE asian mildly-spiced green vegetables with fish chunks. It was delicious. Thavi told me this is how we would prepare it in Laos. I was also lucky enough to then attend the premier at the Brooklyn Academy with the director Ellen Kuras and Thavi speaking about the movie. As tragic as Thavi's tale is he's an intelligent gentleman who has lived in much more interesting times than his suburban neighbors. Times that were not under his control.",1299456000,5,3463,4.6732348111658455
