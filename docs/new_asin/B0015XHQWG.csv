8260198,4,B0015XHQWG,"Not the best overall card but it had one of the most shocking upsets in UFC history (only the recent Bisping title win may be close) as well as one of the oddest fights in UFC history.

Two of the fights (GSP/Serra; Franklin/Lutter) came off of TUF Season 4 (still my fav TUF season btw).  This PPV is notorious for Kalib Starnes running the entire match.  Nate Quarry's antics at the end of the fight are hilarious.  Starnes was cut from the UFC after this PPV.

Great PPV.  The only gripe I have with it is the fact that, as usual, UFC replaces the walkout songs with standard rock music and blocks out the actual song (and walkout reactions of the fighters).  C'mon UFC stop being cheap and pay the royalties necessary to get the actual audio/songs on your PPV releases.

8260200,4,B0015XHQWG,"I love this DVD because it alows me to relive alot of the memories from an awesome UFC weekend in Montreal. I agree with most of the reviews I've read here. My only beef with the DVD is that the UFC altered the entrance music for St. Pierre and Serra, which also drowned-out the respective cheering and booing. May not seem like a big deal, but if you were there in person and want to relive the event as it was...it's just not the same. The more I watch it the more I dislike the UFC's decision on this. What is a GSP entrance without rap music 'en francais' afterall? Or Serra's Rocky themed entrance, since that was his whole build-up to the fight. That being said I assume there is a reason involving money (royalties) that the music is not there. Dosen't compare to the live experiance, but no DVD would. I'll still give it 4/5.",1221868800,,833,4.312101910828026
8260201,4,B0015XHQWG,"The fights are great on this DVD. A must-buy for any UFC fan. I  was disappointed to see the UFC edit preview/storyline for Serra/GSP2.  The preview before the main event included more Serra/GSP interviews including the "" HE crossed the Line "" by GSP. That was the whole point for their fight, Serra talking trash and him crossing the line and the UFC edited that out? WHY?

Franklin/Lutter fight is predictable and the ref basically saves Lutter from getting mauled.  Rich has one one of the slickest Arm Bar escapes in MMA history.",1219363200,,533,4.698924731182796

SERRA VS ST-PIERRE 2

I remember when this event was first announced, I could not wait to see it. On fight night I was glued to the TV, two of my all time favorite fighters of all time squaring off one more time in the rematch. I have always followed Matt Serra's career because he was the first American to receive a black belt from the great Renzo Gracie. Serra is one of my all time favorite fighters ever, his skill mixed with his charisma and excellent sense of humor are great. Also he is not afraid to say what is on his mind, watch The Ultimate Fighter seasons 4 & 6 to see what I mean. This is also by far the best DVD release from the UFC , and great card and a brilliant bonus disc with great features. I guess I should mention that below are some spoilers.

1. JONATHAN GOULET VS KUNIYOSHI HIRONAKA-now this was apparently not on the maid card shown on pay-per view, but for some reason I remember this fight. Any way this fight starts out great, what an explosive first round. Goulet was throwing all kinds of stuff on Hironaka, but Hironaka almost ends this fight at the end of the round. The second round is just as good and just as explosive, but with Goulet letting loose and taking the fight. 5/5

2. CAIN VELASQUEZ VS BRAD MORRIS-this fight is just as exciting as the last, only this one is stopped in the first. Cain Velasquez completely dominates Morris and ends this one in the first round. 5/5

3. SAM STOUT VS RICH CLEMENTI-the first round was an impressive round for Rich, but Sam did not let him end it. He escaped submission after submission, defended against a full mount. The second round seemed to go the other way, with Stout edging out Rich for the round. The third round is a close call and depending on whom you ask this fight could have gone either way. Rich ends up taking it by split descicion. 5/5

4. ED HERMAAN VS DEMIAN MAIA-the first round was a back and forth battle with a lot of submission attempts from Maia. The second round ends with Ed getting put into a deep triangle, a great win for Maia. 5/5

5. ALAN BELCHER VS JASON DAY-this is a very quick and exciting fight, Jason Day straight puts it on Alan. He is on his back and is still hurting Alan with punches, then ends it when they are standing. 5/5

6. JASON MACDONALD VS JOE DOERKSEN-the first round is an amazing display of ju-jitsu between two warriors going at it. The first round alone made this fight a classic. The second round ends in less then a minute as Jason knocks out Joe on the ground. 5/5

7. MAC DANZIG VS MARK BOCEK-the first televised fight of the night, and it was a very good opening bout for pay-per-view viewers. The first round was a great back and forth battle, especially on the ground. The second round starts with Mac delivering a beautiful knee that almost takes out Mark. From there out Danzig controls the rest of the round. In the final round Mac cuts Mark open with some good strikes, but Mark does not back down. In the end Danzig still takes it though with a nice rear naked choke. 5/5

8. MICHAEL BISPING VS CHARLES MCCARTHY-the first and only round is a good exciting round, Bisping comes with some nice strikes that end up ending the fight. Mccarthy could not continue after the first ended, although he had Bisping in an arm bar at one point. 5/5

9. KALIB STARNES VS NATE QUARRY-this is the infamous fight that showed what Kalib was all about. The first round was a taste of what was to come in later rounds, Nate bringing it and Kalib running. Round two just mimics the first with Kalib running from Nate, Kalib only swings when he has to. Round three was the same except Nate was doing the running man and making fun of Kalib. I have to give this fight five out of five solely for Nate. 5/5

10. RICH FRANKLIN VS TRAVIS LUTTER-I really did not know what to expect out of this fight. Franklin had been destroyed by Anderson Silva while Travis did much better against the champ, but Rich is one of the all time greats so it could go either way. Both came out good in round one with Franklin landing some good strikes and Lutter taking him down, mounting, and getting him in a nice arm bar. Franklin escapes the arm bar and the round ends nicely. Round two ends up being were the fight ends with Franklin out lasting Lutter and killing him with strikes. 5/5

11.[WELTERWIEGHT CHAMPIONSHIP] MATT SERRA VS GEORGES ST-PIERRE-next up was the main event that saw two of my all time favorite fighters ever. And in my opinion this was and still is the biggest fight that the UFC has put forth for the audience as far as atmosphere and hype. I remember watching this live and thinking ""wow this is a real life movie"". And what I meant was the crowd was so loud and so for the home town hero who was going against the big bad evil American who had crushed their boy before. When Matt Serra came out and just walked right threw a very hostile crowd and in classic villain role threw up the two, as in ""I will shock the world twice"". The only thing I did not like about this DVD is that they changed Serra's entrance music, when it was live he came out to a cool sounding Rocky inspired track. Also I really didn't like how they turned up the music tracks on the DVD so you really can not hear the crowd reaction when they come out, it really was a very emotional reaction. Just listen to the soundtrack change in volume after the ref finishes talking to both of them in the center of the octagon. It was in my opinion the loudest night in the history of MMA. Both had a lot to prove in this fight, Pierre had to avenge the quickest and most dominate loss of his career and Serra wanted to prove that it wasn't a fluke. The first round was amazing, with Pierre taking Serra down two times and working some nice ground and pound. But Serra does not really get dominated in the first, it would be the second rounds were he really gets hurt. Round two sees both fighter do very well for the first half of the fight, but Serra really starts to get hurt towards the end. And with 20 seconds left Pierre gets the win after some vicious knees. I wish they would have left the original soundtrack on because that place exploded when GSP won that fight. My favorite thing about this fight is how both of the fighters act after the fight. Giving each other props and proving there was never really any bad blood. Also it goes to show you how classy the fans were that night because in the end they cheered just as loud for Serra after the fight as they did for GSP.

I have to say that this was the most emotional MMA cards I ever had the privilege of seeing. If there was ever a night to watch MMA it was that night in Montreal. Also the bonus disc is brilliant, it is by far the best the UFC has released. It has the UFC.COM featurettes, all the weigh-ins, a great and informative behind the scenes feature, and my favorite features the entire pre & post fight press conferences. This with out a doubt a must have DVD for any and all people out there, BUY THIS NOW.",1219276800,,6994,4.2853898561695685
8260203,5,B0015XHQWG,"Trash talk is essential! And in the UFC, MMA, sometimes to promote a fight, it is highly imperative. We all know how Matt Serra shocked the world in UFC 69, and in the first round with a TKO against GSP. But has Matt Serra prepared himself with the same skills, or is he putting on a trash-talking clinic? Has Matt Serra crossed the line? With cutting remarks such as, ""Hey Frenchy, go back to your red wine and Hockey game!"", did Matt Serra set himself up? Georges St-Pierre is ready to answer back in the octagon. Oh yes! This is part 2, and this is the main event in UFC 83, and it takes place in Montreal, Canada. Matt Serra believes this to be his Rocky 4 moment. He wants to shock the world twice. Well...

Ok, the co-main event is interesting as well. It features Rich Franklin taking on Travis Lutter. Both have fought Anderson Silva. But as crazy as it sounds, Lutter did a lot better against Silva than Franklin did. But both have lost to the Middleweight champion. This fight just might be about bragging rights, and it very well could be a huge statement for either fighter.

Kenny Florian fills in for Joe Rogan, along side Mike Goldberg. Mike calls him Kenny, and Kenny calls him Goldie. I'll welcome back the announcing of Kenny Florian back anytime!

I'm going to say one thing. When you get an event that features 10 or more fights, there's bound to be one of 'em that sucks, one that simply doesn't belong on the card. You can't say that with this card. There are 11 fights, and there ain't nothing wrong with ANY of 'em!! Yeah, I said 11 fights! I'll list them below. They are ALL enjoyable.

Jonathan Goulet vs. Kuniyoshi Hironaka: THIS was actually given fight of the night! Hometown hero Goulet is ready for his guest, Hironaka. This fight ends in the middle of the 2nd round. And fight of the night just might be right on!!

Cain Velasquez vs. Brad Morris: Two Heavyweights making UFC debuts! And they are ready to rock, and it ends in the 1st round.

Sam Stout vs. Rich Clementi: Stout is the hometown hero against the seasoned Clementi, who has no love for anybody, especially Stout on this night. A well fought fight, with a split decision being the result.

Ed Herman vs. Demian Maia: Pissed off Ed Herman is looking for respect. Maia is looking for a gentle submission. It ends in the 2nd round.

Alan Belcher vs. Jason Day: Is ""The Talent"" of the UFC going to meet ""Doom"" in this match? It takes less than a round to find out.

Jason MacDonald vs. Joe Doerksen: Two Canadians with some trash talk ready to take each other out! And one of them does go out in the 2nd round.

Mac Danzig vs. Mark Bocek: I'm telling you! Both of these fighters deserve the highest level of respect for the fight that was given! What a scrap. Neither of these guys fought a bad fight, but one of them got finished near the end of the 3rd round. This could've made an argument for fight of the night as well!

Michael Bisping vs. Charles McCarthy: The Count takes on Captain Miserable! Submission or knock out? I'll just put it this way. One of them can't continue after the 1st round.

Kalib Starnes vs. Nate Quarry: It stays interesting, while ending in hilarious fashion. What's sad is that due to the performance of one of these fellows, there is an immediate dismissal from the UFC as a result of this fight. Good fight, unanimous decision, but what a shame.

Rich Franklin vs. Travis Lutter: Well, this is an intersting match, but it ends in the 2nd round.

Matt Serra vs. Georges St-Pierre: This is where last, but not least can easily apply! In the end, respect is given where it is deserved.

I'm telling you, if you are a UFC fan, get this DVD! This is a double disc, and it has a lot of cool stuff. Even includes most of the pre-fight interviews, as well as most of the post fight interviews with Ken-Flow! Now go out and get it and have a great time.",1218499200,6,3869,4.391608391608392
8260204,5,B0015XHQWG,"This is a 2 disc set, featuring tons of extra features including UFC.com featurettes(about 40 minutes worth), pre/post press conferences(30 minutes each), weigh ins, and all post-fight interviews(something they didn't include on any previous releases).

UFC 83 featured match after match of highly anticipated returns, rematches, and redemption. George St Pierre takes on Matt Serra for the Welterweight belt in his home town of Montreal, Canada. St Pierre lost their first fight in a brutal KO fashion and Serra is looking to do the same this time around! Coming off a domination of both Koscheck and Matt Hughes, GSP seemed better then ever. Let's just say he definately shows it here!

Rich Franklin also takes on Travis Lutter in which was a make it or break it fight for Lutter. Rich Franklin lost twice to Anderson Silva, and Lutter lost to him once but to me did the best against him. Looking for a definate rematch with Silva, Lutter did what he had to do to make weight this time and brought as much as he could into the octagon. Unfortunately, Rich Franklin is the man and if it wasn't for Anderson Silva, he would still be champion. A great fight for fans of Franklin.

Michael Bisping also makes his 180 debut against Charles McCarthy. These guys exchanged bad blood and both wanted to kick the other guys butt. See who pulls it off in dominating fashion!

Kalib Starnes vs Nate Quarry was a huge letdown, due to Starnes running away the entire match(which later led to his release from the UFC). This was probably one of the worst matches in recent UFC history. Ill try to not let this affect the entire event. It was awesome to see the Canadian fans boo their hometown man and cheer on the American in the end though.

Mac Danzig also makes his first PPV debut against Canadian Mark Bocek. I don't know why people counted Bocek out in this one. He definately puts on one heck of a fight and makes Danzig work to win. A great great fight.

As for the undercard fights, 3 of them earned the bonuses for the night, including Fight of the Night, Knockout, and Submission of the night. Surpising considering the way the main card went but the undercard was extremely great!
