3650403,5,B001J0FVYU,"My 12 year old son and I starting surfing 2 years ago and now own about 7 surfing movies. We have now watched this movie about 5 times in one month! I don't just consider ""Bustin' Down the Door"" my favorite surf movie, it's just one of my favorite movies period.
Being 47 years old I used to read about ""the bronzed aussies"" in the surf mags, therefore I had a ""one-up"" on my son as to who these guys were, but my son is in agreement that this movie takes the cake.
Everything about this movie is solid, the opening song sequence is beautiful, the surfing is perfectly inter-spliced with the interviews,the story itself is absolutely key and brings together the legends of Hawaii with the ""invading"" south africans and austalians. There is much, much more to this story-you just gotta see it!
The ending scenes showing Shaun Tompson, Rabbit and (who was the 3rd guy?) surfing together currently, then blending into the young versions, was just fantastic!
Beautiful job, well done!",1259539200,6,980,4.670520231213873
3650404,5,B001J0FVYU,"This movie was introduced the summer of 2008. It's an excellent journal of how the US surf culture evolved and has changed for the better through the decades with the gradual inclusion of surfers from So. Africa and Australia. There's three different versions included, the movie itself, the commentary version, the movie w/only a soundtrack, as well as outakes.
Great soundtrack remenicent of the 60's & 70's garage-band sound.
Our friends both in and out of the surf community have been riveted when we've played this movie at home.",1245801600,9,534,5.01123595505618

3650406,5,B001J0FVYU,"I saw this in the theatre and I recently bought the DVD.

Bustin' has some great vintage surfing sequences as well as an extremely compelling story motivated by a lot of emotion, both by the filmmakers and the subjects themselves.

Must see!!!",1234137600,,243,4.761904761904762
3650407,5,B001J0FVYU,"The surfing documentary ""Bustin' Down the Door"" focuses on the Australian and South African surfers that pioneered pro surfing back in the 1970s. Filled with beautiful original footage as well as open, honest, and sometimes emotional interviews, the movie successfully conveys the challenges that Shaun Tomson, Mark Richards, Peter Townend, Ian Cairns, Wayne ""Rabbit"" Bartholomew, and Michael Tomson faced in their quest to bring surfing to a worldwide, professional level. Overall the movie is well worth watching and is not your typical surf movie as it deals with much more than just the sport.

As the film progresses, we learn about the lives of each surfer and what drove them to go to the North Shore of Oahu at the advent of pro surfing. One surprising yet refreshing aspect the filmmakers included was the conflict the surfers faced with native Hawaiians. By presenting each viewpoint in a balanced yet frank fashion, we become witness to how the situation escalated to a point where neither side was right and where each had lessons to learn about respect, humility, and the true meaning of Aloha.

This film can easily be watched and enjoyed by anyone even if they aren't involved with the sport. The surfing is awesome - of course - but the depth at which the filmmakers explore the athlete's personal lives as well as the inclusion of the historical background of the Hawaiian people relative to surfing make this movie satisfying to watch on many levels. Five stars.",1231977600,18,1480,4.963709677419355

3650434,5,B001J0FVYU,Awesome perspective on the origin of modern professional surfing. These guys definitely paved the way for the modern era of surfing. We would all be riding wooden planks if not for the vision of this early group to push the sport to a new level. I live the benefits of it everyday I go out surfing. This film is a must watch for any true surfer. The film Deeper Shade of Blue is another great history lesson of surfing and the push by some of the newer guys to redefine professional surfing to its' free spirited roots.,1410825600,2,519,4.360824742268041

3650440,5,B001J0FVYU,"This surf video is pretty spectacular. The extra footage is very good. The deleted scenes are a great addition & extensive enough to make a difference in the finished product. The explanations & interviews are very authentic & honest & tell the story of what the Hawaiians & the Aloha spirit is all about. It also explains (very accurately) about the realistic tentions between the locals vs. the visitors (haoles = howlies). This is the first surf video that tells the open truth about the racial tensions between the different cultures. Believe me, it does exist, as I used to live there as a haole/white, previously from the mainland. The actual surf action is very good too.",1399334400,,678,4.803418803418803

The real storyline, the historical significance...this is a must see vid for young aerialists as well as my Old Long-Board Fart friends.  Although I well remember the players and the times I had no idea of the dramatic story behind the cover.  All was not paradise in paradise.  The surfing is awesome and legendary and the characters are larger than life...and it all happened.

3650450,3,B001J0FVYU,"Well, I hate to rain on everyone's parade here, but I've never seen such a crude example of cultural imperialism, and they had the cojones to put it on film!  Next time you paddle out on your Hawaiian vacation, same break every day, maybe Publics or someplace neutral, ask yourself why the locals aren't so very friendly, even after you've nodded your Hellos, waited your turn in the lineup etc. etc.

This film will give you the answer.  Some Aussies and South Africans, not the most culturally or racially sensitive people in the 70's, I'm guessing, decide to take the North Shore by storm so they can ""create the modern sport of professional surfing,"" because ""Hawaii was where it was happening,""and, because they're pretty good, end up winning the few big surf contests that exist.  Not content to rest on their laurels, and after being befriended by the locals, they manage to get on the covers of all the mags and then, believe it or not, return their Hawaiian host's welcomes by trumpeting, in print, how the Hawaiians can't really surf very well.  Then, they are shocked!  Shocked!  When the Hawaiians form Da Hui and start to serve up a little serious wall-to-wall (surf-to beach?) counseling.  Their feelings are hurt....And all they wanted was to be rich, famous...

I noticed that many of the people here who supported these guys have since profited enormously from the creation of pro-surfing and the multi-million business that has grown up around it...probably responsible more than anything else for all the monster groms who drop in on you, then flip you off and choke every decent break everywhere now....future little pro surfers, all.

I have to say, it's a well-made film, and an interesting piece of surf history/culture, just shockingly biased and clueless as to what was going on from the Hawaiian's point of view.  Notice, it was Eddie Aikau who made the peace.

And, think about it, what would the North Shore be like now without its enforcers....the Japanese and Brazilians would be thick as fleas and the locals pushed to the side, just like these guys tried to do, in their own country.

Maybe I missed it, but I heard a lot of justifications from most of the principles, even years later, but no real apologies.  If the tables had been turned and the Hawaiians charging the Aussies breaks....hummmmmm.",1364774400,6,2331,4.838790931989925

3650452,5,B001J0FVYU,"If you are at all interested in how surfing became a respected and professional sport and a multi-billion dollar industry, then  Bustin' Down the Door is for you. Four men, Mark Richards, Shaun Tomson, Rabbit Bartholomew and Peter Townend arrived in Hawaii in the early 1970s determined to prove they were the best, not to put the Hawaiians down.  Their plan, however, was not how the Hawaiians interpreted it.  It wasn't exactly bloody warfare but a local North Shore group of surfers i.e.the 'Black Shorts,' certainly gave them a run for their money in the name of preserving their culture.  This is a fascinating documentary very much worth the time it takes to watch it.",1357516800,,674,4.834782608695652
3650453,5,B001J0FVYU,You don't have to be a surfer or a surfing fan to enjoy this film - it's excellent in every way - it has great depth.  I highly recommend it.,1338940800,,141,3.7
3650454,5,B001J0FVYU,"Not only is the feature film a fantastic documentary with both great surfing footage as well as unreal stories from the '70s when surfing went pro but the extras are virtually a whole other movie in themselves.

The deleted scenes just have even more interesting tales to tell and a 31-minute surfing feature that has basically a soundtrack, no voiceover and just scenes of amazing surfing is something you can get lost in and dream of riding those waves.

As someone who admires surfing but doesn't have a deep knowledge of the figures who built the sport it's so fascinating to learn it took three Australians and a South African to really take surfing pro. Also, it's a great look into Hawaiian surf culture and the sometimes difficult relationship it has with outsiders horning in on their North Shore waves and the respect they think surfing there deserves. The first signs of the territoriality that is so infamous in Southern California seems to have its roots in Hawaii and probably for good reason as you'll learn as this story unfolds.

Shot beautifully, well researched, wild and thoughtful characters and it'll stop all this nonsense about surfers being some sort of laid back Jeff Spicoli stoner hippy dudes. That image was never there and this shows that surfers are the most determined, strong-willed, courageous and professional athletes on the planet yet also some of the most creative artists out there on the waves.",1328832000,2,1434,4.917355371900826
3650455,5,B001J0FVYU,"Wow!  GREAT on so many levels.  I surfed in the 60s and enjoy watching true story documentaries so I was prepared for a good hour and a half.  This is a great story line for a movie and I wouldn't be surprised to see that similar to Dogtown and Z Boys which also started as a documentary.

The basic story is these non-Hawaiian surfers come from South Africa and Australia and struggle for entry in contests but later dominate the sport with their new style.  But after this build-up to their greatness and advancement of the sport it takes a highly unusual twist that had me spellbound.  The Hawaiians felt their culture was disrespected as the Aussie's self-marketed themselves with some derogatory comments.  Then it is game on and not concerning surfing which eventually culminates in a bizarre meeting arranged by the famous Eddie Aikau.  I'll let you rent to find the results but lives are at risk.

Also, I would add that there is a closing montage where the surfers thirty years later venture into the water and surf before overlaying to surfing in their youth.  Very well done.  Also, there are some good songs in the documentary.  I can't recommend this documentary higher!",1307232000,2,1183,4.717073170731707

3650457,5,B001J0FVYU,"I saw this on an overseas flight coming from Europe, and I was so happy as I would have never heard of it otherwise!

As someone who surfed in the late 70s/early 80s, guys like Mark Richards, Shaun Tomson and Wayne ""Rabbit"" Bartholomew and crew were our heroes.  I was especially a huge fan of Richards, and even had his iconic ""MR"" superman logo on the bottom of my board.  They are and remain legends today, and this movie provided not only a greater insight into the development of pro surf; but also showed where these wave-riding gods are today.

I could hardly wait to get home to buy a copy of this movie, as it is definitely one that every surfer of that generation will want.  I have a copy of ""Step Into the Liquid"" which is a great surf flick; but ""Bustin' Down the Door"" is old school surfing and a documentary I can better relate to.  These guys still look good nearly 30 years down the road, and their story needed to be told.  Thank you Jeremy Gosch for doing so!

By the way, not a spoiler but at the end of the movie where they transform the guys surfing today into them surfing back in ""the day"" was a pure cinematic masterpiece!",1287532800,4,1147,4.277777777777778

3650459,5,B001J0FVYU,"I managed to catch this on a plane out of Los Angeles, sadly, returning to London NOT my home, Australia. It is a wonderful insight into the brotherhood that grew up between the surfers at a time when surfing was just about waves and mates. Inevitably, it had to become commercial and there were many benefits to that. The interviews with the now older and wiser surfers are incredibly moving and that brotherhood still shines through. To step back in time with original and rare footage is an incredible gift. Cameras weren't all that common in the hands of amateurs back then, especially young, broke, salt-encrusted surfers, but there's a great collection here. Sure, the waves are great to see but they have been there for millions of years and will, hopefully keep rolling in, but the human story shines through. Young, sometimes arrogant young men ( weren't we all at some time ? ) getting into scrapes and paying the consequences. All lessons in life leave a few scars if they're worth learning. Amazing to see how life was back then, it is so hemmed in these days. You couldn't do what these guys did now without a job, tax number, roadworthy car, and lots of cash. They seemed to survive on borrowed burgers and a foam mattress. We could weep for that loss of freedom now. Every tube looks like The Time Tunnel, taking us back to a lovely period of history. A brilliant production.",1263686400,8,1390,4.631578947368421

It focuses only on those Australians who were successful in the competition world.  It makes them out as nice guys who just wanted to prove themselves. In reality, there were hundreds of them and they were all willing to do anything necessary to get noticed . This included a total disrespect for the local surfers and the Hawaiian culture.  They showed up and acted like they owned the place. It was only through sponsorship that they managed to get their way into the big contest. As usual money screams obscenities! Had to stop watching halfway through because I knew it was all  baloney.
