8053803,5,B0007Y5V7G,Pretty good old but still good and informative pleasant film on the Appalachian mountains,1412467200,,89,5.428571428571429
8053804,5,B0007Y5V7G,"The Appalachian Mountain range stretches some 2,000 miles, from Alabama northward to Newfoundland, encompassing the Great Smoky and Blue Ridge Mountain ranges as well.  At its heart are the three areas preserving the beauty of the southern highlands: Great Smoky Mountains and Shenandoah national parks, and the Blue Ridge Parkway connecting them.  Not a journey to a vacation, but a vacation in itself, this 469-mile scenic highway that runs the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains also cradles a wealth of human and cultural history.  At either end lie Shenandoah, miraculously reclaimed from the wasteland it had become by the 1930s, and the Great Smokies, one of the most diverse natural areas in North America.",1368748800,,713,5.182608695652174
