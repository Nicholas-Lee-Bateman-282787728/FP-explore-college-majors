7906699,5,B00000F52Y,"I originally stopped watching Dragon Tales long before Enrique made his debut on the show, but these episodes enables children to learn a little bit of the Spanish language even more with Enrique's dabut. While many old-time fans have found Enrique ""annoying"", however, by introducing a character who can speak more fluent Spanish, children are able to discover more interesting info surrounding the Spanish language.",1341100800,,417,5.430769230769231
7906700,5,B00000F52Y,"We purchased this DVD after PBS stopped showing Dragon Tales. My son specifically asked for a DVD with episodes that starred Enrique. The following episodes are on this DVD (noticed that Amazon did not list these):

To Fly With A New Friend, Part 1&2
Feliz Cumpleanos, Enrique
Super Snow Day
All Together Now

Needless to say, my son is happy with this purchase!! He was really missing seeing Dragon Tales.",1287705600,3,406,4.785714285714286
7906701,5,B00000F52Y,"I rented this movie for my 20 month old daughter and had to return it to Netflix. Two weeks later, she still remembers and is still singing songs from the DVD! It is entertaining for both adults and young children, some of the tunes are even stuck in MY head (in a good way).",1273708800,,275,4.111111111111111
7906702,5,B00000F52Y,"Our 2-year-old loves this video!  The focus is on friendship, new situations, and facing fears.  The stories are easy for his attention span, and he is learning to say ""Hola!"" with the song.  Whenever Spanish is spoken, the words are repeated in English; they handle this very well, so it doesn't feel redundant for adults watching with their kids.  Although he doesn't get the nuances, like Hispanic cultural awareness (even between 1st generation and 2nd/3rd generations in the U.S.), we are glad to see them represented.  Based on the different levels of thinking presented in the stories, we anticipate him enjoying it for a few years, as he will discover new things going on.  We highly recommend it!",1220745600,2,705,4.932203389830509
