8109638,5,B000EH2URU,"This is a very interesting DVD featuring the narrow gauge railroads of Western Colorado.  The films were shot in the late 1940s-early 1950s and show the Denver-Rio Grande's various narrow gauge trains at work.  The scenery in that area is rugged beauty with steep mountains, narrow passes, and an occasional rushing river.  These railroad lines have long since passed into history, so presentations like this are the only opportunity to see them hard at work.",1422489600,,459,5.093333333333334
