8370624,5,B002I2PHZQ,"I am a music teacher and LOVE SoSmart videos.  They are slow and simple and the music is sweet and simple too.  Its perfect for little ones.  I agree that building blocks, reading books, talking walks outside, etc are better ways to interact with your child, but these videos are great to watch together, or if you need a 5-10 min break to make dinner.  :)  My 17 month old daughter has practiced simple words and really enjoys this series.  She has watched them since she was about 9 months old.",1411171200,,496,4.395604395604396
8370625,5,B002I2PHZQ,"This DVD is good for babies 6 months to a year. It seems pretty simple, however that is what your child needs in his or her early development. You will be surprised at the response after you use it a couple times.",1346112000,,213,4.095238095238095
8370626,1,B002I2PHZQ,"I'm amazed that people haven't wised up to the deceptive marketing practices used in the titles of videos like Baby Einstein and So Smart! There are no data to support these videos making kids 'smarter' or more like Einstein. Unfortunately, many parents read the title and subconsciously (or not so subconsciously) decide that if the video is called this, it must make kids smarter. Think about it - would you be equally inclined to buy this video if it was called ""Ketchup sandwich?"" I would venture a guess that most consumers wouldn't.

Our local PBS station carries a lot of them. These videos are slow-moving and simple - which is fine for small children. They're probably no better than most other cartoons for pure (and questionable) entertainment purposes IF your child likes them (which our kids don't). However, don't buy them thinking you're doing something good for your kids. Reading, drawing, building with blocks - those are mind-building activities for little minds. Watching TV is not and should not be considered good for children no matter how the stuff put on the screen is marketed. Instead, I hope that consumers exercise a little consumer activism and stop buying things that may trick well-meaning parents into thinking they're doing something good for their children.",1305417600,2,1292,5.065727699530516
