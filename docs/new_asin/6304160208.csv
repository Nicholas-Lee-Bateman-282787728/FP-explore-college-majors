796709,2,6304160208,"Before I purchased this DVD, I researched Questar and the company seemed legitimate. They partnered with PBS which produced A Little Princess. I was really hoping the picture quality of this DVD would be equivalent to the VHS version but it is not. The colors are off and the picture is blurry at times. I am not sure if the DVD is a knockoff by the vendor. I plan to contact Questar about the picture quality and see if I can buy the DVD direct from the company.",1514851200,,463,4.2727272727272725
796710,1,6304160208,"This is a wonderful story, and we have it as a 2-tape VHS edition, and I transferred it to DVD many years ago; the problem is that modern TVs don't give a sharp image to VHS, I assume because the VHS is not digital. So I've been looking for a DVD version and I just found it this past week, and discovered the DVD was released 2017.  We tried to watch it, but the quality is HORRID, and a total waste of money.  It looks like the movie was projected onto a screen and then shot with a digital camera.  Colors are washed out, lots of overall bad images which aren't even as sharp as my original VHS, let alone my DVD transfer.  I would never recommend this, and I hope the original producers will produce a quality version in the near future.",1514764800,,741,4.160839160839161

796713,5,6304160208,"This version is very much like the book.  The role of Sarah was seemingly made for Amelia Shankley, who I doubt will never be surpassed in this role.  Nigel Havers gave a splendid performance as Mr. Carisford, The Indian Gentleman.  The musical score is beautiful, composed by Rachel Portman.

The color at the beginning was a greenish tint and didn't get any better until about an hour and a half into it. I was deeply disappointed. I was so excited to find that this version was the full length but after hearing that the quality of the color was bad, I regret buying it. I guess I got what I paid for. It was $19 and all the other ones were about $79. So disapointed!! I hope I can find a better color quality.

796773,3,6304160208,"I really really really love this production. It's well acted. Well scripted. And very well done. Especially for a TV Miniseries. My only gripe is that that I feel the Questar DVD video quality is a little below excellent. I can't compare it to other DVD releases of this production because I haven't seen them, but for Questar... I was a little disappointment in the video quality. A lot of pixels in certain scenes.

I would give it a B on Video Quality

I did enjoy my purchase though and it came much faster than I expected. Despite my gripes about video quality, I can't stop watching this disc. I definitely recommend it.",1504569600,,626,4.530973451327434

796775,5,6304160208,"I have a hazy recollection of the 1995 film with Liesel Matthews and Elinor Bron.  One thing that I can say about it was that Liesel seemed closer in intended age based on an equally hazy recollection of the book.  Amelia Shankley was 15 at the time of the 1983 and looked taller than that besides.  But the girl in the 1995 book seemed almost immune to suffering and unless she suffered there wasn't anything wonderful about her reversal of fortune.

Sara Crewe suffers from her poverty and the meanness she is subjected to so that the radical improvement of her fate has a much greater impact.  For me this production was excellent and much truer to the dramatic arc of the story than the 1995 production.  It is a shame that this series is not readily available while the 1995 production - not a bad one but not equal to this one - can be had for very little.",1490140800,,862,4.35625
796776,5,6304160208,"I first saw this film play on Public Television in LA County Calif. some years ago now, I forget the year.  This was the version done in six episodes which is the version  I much prefer but it seems it's no longer easily available.  Still I think this is the best version of the story as written by Frances Hodgson Burnett. It is and will always be another of my personal favorites.  Without the episode breaks the film plays as if it had been intended to be watched as it is presented on this DVD.  I hope there were no scenes left out.  GAC",1484956800,,542,4.163461538461538
796777,5,6304160208,"I purchased this DVD ion A Little Princess in 2009 after finding the videotaped version in a used book store.  Somehow I missed it when it originally aired on PBS back in 1986.  This version is wonderful--mostly holds true to the original book, plus it's around 5 hours long, so it is able to delve into much of the detail from the book.  The casting is great, even if Amelia Shankley (who played Sara) seems a bit older than the book version).  I absolutely hated the version made in the late 90s.

I sure wish someone would re-produce this version on DVD so a new generation can enjoy it.",1484006400,,590,4.376146788990826

796892,5,6304160208,This version is far superior to the other versions.  I have loved this version since I first saw it decades ago - some say 1986 PBS.  It is a rich story with wonderful character development.  Amelia Shankley's performance was beautiful and memorable.  I do think this film is one of the best ever made due to the rich theme of virtue under trial and a fierce determination to remain true to ones goodness of heart and self worth.  The film does have the heroine who is not hindu refer to Kali as a god in control of her destiny once but that's the extent of its religiosity.  I admit I am astonished that this film is not more widely known and available.,1450224000,,654,4.319672131147541

796956,5,6304160208,"I wanted this dvd for a long time starring Amelia Shankley and Maureen Lipman.  I won't give a plot synopsis because other reviewers have done that very well ! This is a wonderful family movie although a bit sad in the middle, but then a happy ending ! I finally found this movie on DVD  at a REASONABLE price at amazon.de , that is amazon Germany. It is the original TV series six episodes in a 2-disk set,with the English soundtrack, or you can choose other languages from the disk menu.
It is priced reasonably at 19 euros. The dvd is titled "" Sara de kleine Prinzessin"" on the German amazon site
You can also buy this dvd from amazon.co.uk which is the british amazon site for 19 pounds.
In both cases, the shipping was about 7 Canadian dollars extra, and delivery is usually about 10 days.

ANOTHER VERY EXCELLENT DVD from England perfectly fine for all viewers is the double set THE RAILWAY CHILDREN / SWALLOWS and AMAZONS.
This is a double bill of two classic childrens' stories on DVD very reasonably priced around $12 American dollars plus another 6 or so for shipping from the United Kingdom. This Railway Children film from 1976, with Jenny Agutter playing the older daughter, is much better than the 25th anniversary remake with Jenny Agutter now playing the mother. The RAILWAY CHILDREN  story is set in England's countryside around 1910, and SWALLOWS AND AMAZONS is set in the Lake District of England around 1930.

WARNING: THE DVDS THAT I AM RECOMMENDING ARE FOR REGION 2, and won't play on standard North American dvd players.

It is good to learn from the past, the respect that was back then, the style of life.  I saw this on PBS back when it came out and remembered it from then.  I thought about it as there was a 1995 version on the TV and this was nowhere near the quality of the 1986 version.  This version is the one more true to how the book was written.

797041,5,6304160208,"This classic 1986 film version of ""A Little Princess"" remains one of my favorites to this day.
Based on the 1905 novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, this adaptation brings to life a riches to rags tale set in Victorian England.
Sara Crewe (played by Amelia Shankley) is a young girl born in India and raised by her widowed father, whom she adores.  He dotes on her and lavishes her with the finer things in life...but Sara never becomes spoiled or takes her privilege for granted.

As the title suggests, she embodies what being a ""princess"" is truly about...kindness, compassion, and grace.
Her father, a British army captain, enrolls her in a girls boarding school in England so he can pursue his duties.  Sara must leave India behind to start a new life at Miss Minchin's Seminary.
From the time she arrives at her new school, everyone is abuzz with excitement over the new girl with her fancy clothes and flair for storytelling.  Sara speaks fluent French while the rest of them struggle with the language; she captivates them with her vivid imagination; she is kind and gracious to everyone, especially the bullied and downtrodden.

Sara lives a charmed life until the unexpected death of her beloved Papa...she also learns that he died penniless.
Now thrust into a world of uncertainty and misfortune, she experiences poverty for the first time.  I won't give too much away after this, but this is a quintessential story that contains many valuable lessons.
Sara never loses sight of what it means to be a princess.  It truly isn't about royalty or status or material wealth...it is about inner beauty that shines through adversity.  Miss Minchin, the cruel head mistress (Maureen Lipman) tries to shatter the young girl's self-esteem at every turn but Sara will not be broken.  She fights back with a quiet dignity in the most painful, degrading situations.

I love the 1939 version starring Shirley Temple and also the 1995 version.  But this one from 1986, in my opinion, truly captures the essence of Burnett's story.  ""A Little Princess"" is a beautiful story but this version shows the depth of human cruelty and kindness in ways that the other films don't.
Shankley plays Sara so brilliantly that I forget she is just acting.  This is a Cinderella story in reverse and unlike the other ""Little Princess"" movies, this one truly made me cry...although I love a quote in the 1995 version that is missing from this one, about how all girls are princesses.  Not in the sense of money or superficial things, but more about how as people, we should value ourselves and one another.

With its emphasis on generosity and kindness, ""A Little Princess"" is sure to win hearts.  It shows how love can triumph over evil and that we can find sunshine even in the dark.  I was also struck by certain things that escaped me when I watched this years ago, but now I see more clearly.
Miss Minchin abuses the children in her care and she is driven by greed.  Her sister, while a far gentler soul, is a passive bystander...evil can only triumph when good people do nothing about it.
And I found the cook to be a repulsive character also...her resentment of Sara comes out in truly monstrous ways. It shows how sometimes people will treat you differently based on how they perceive you and your circumstances in life.

Sara is treated well by most until her station in life is suddenly demoted to that of a servant. Then it becomes obvious that she is devalued due to her loss of wealth, and spiteful people delight in her misfortune.
As I grew up and learned more about life, I understood that Frances Burnett had a keen insight into the human psyche.  I was never privileged or wealthy but I often encountered people in my life who were (for one reason or another) determined to destroy me and crush my spirit.  Unlike Sara, I became bitter and cynical to protect myself from further pain.  I think what ""A Little Princess"" teaches us is that life is unpredictable...we can't control much of what happens in life but we can try to maintain a positive outlook and seek happiness in small things.

Sara retains her childlike sense of wonder and optimism despite her trials. ""Princess"" is a magical, uplifting story about seeing beauty in life and keeping hope alive when it seems impossible to do so. It can also be an excellent tool for teaching children, boys as well as girls, that kindness is essential.
So many people have lost sight of the fact that although money is wonderful to have, true wealth comes from a person's humanity to others. This core value is emphasized through Sara's selfless actions, like sharing food with a homeless child even when she herself becomes destitute...a story that is dazzling in its simplicity and so powerful in its message.

5 stars all the way for this classic tear-jerker!",1413849600,,4806,4.735011990407674

I have it on VHS and praying that the VCRs will last a little longer because the DVD is so expensive. This is a good movie for children at the age of understanding what it means to be a penniless orphan.

797324,5,6304160208,"This review is a comparison between the PBS Wonderworks/VHS version (which runs around 160 minutes, excluding the PBS promos for my 2 and 3 tape sets) with the London Weekend Television/DVD version that runs under 150 minutes.  Each version has its share of continuity issues, plot holes, and abrupt scene shifts.  I read portions of the book and, of course, many aspects of the book are not shown on either version.  Based on my subjective viewing of both video versions (without comparing either to the novel or with each other), I would have to go with the LWT/DVD version as being the better cut of the two.  The Wonderworks/VHS version (note that the first two scene omissions apply to the 3 VHS set only) cut out three scenes (two at the beginning and one near the end), that I felt took away from the continuity of the story development and created a major plot hole in the story.  The first one is the background behind the Emily doll.  There is no mention in the VHS version as to how it was obtained or when it was obtained.  Sara is just seen holding it in her arms as she travels in the carriage to her school.  The DVD version has a discussion between Sara and her father about the doll.  The second one is the scene just before Sara enters the classroom for the very first time.  The other students talk amongst themselves about the new pupil in the class and the viewer gets a chance to see which one of them would end up being a friend or rival to Sara.  The VHS version cuts straight from Sara's father's departure to everyone sitting in the classroom as Miss Minchin enters.  The third missing scene (which applies to both the 2 and 3 VHS cassette sets) near the ending is where Becky brings Sara's letter to Ermengarde that tells them all that she is rich again and is not returning back to the school.  The VHS version cuts straight from the party scene at the Carmichael residence to a scene with Becky crying going to her room.  The letter scene omission left a plot hole for the crying scene.  The final confrontation scene between Miss Minchin and Sara is abbreviated on the VHS version.  You are able to see the effect of a final comeuppance to Miss Minchin and Lavinia on the DVD version that is absent on the VHS version.  The ending scene with Anne (waif) and the baker's wife ends on a different note on the DVD version which I felt was a better one.  Also, I thought the beginning scenes in India ran a bit longer on the DVD version, so you got a better introduction to Sara and her father.  And lastly, the DVD six episodes are presented as it was shown on UK TV and ended each one at a logical point in the story.  The VHS version was based on a 3 episode group which combined two of the UK TV episodes into one continuous PBS/USA TV airing which felt too rushed and not allow the viewer to pause and consider the ending of what should have been one single episode.  So, from an overall aspect of the presentation (without having read the novel), I would recommend the LWT/DVD version. The Wonderworks/VHS tape (1, 2, or 3) versions are usually cheaper than the DVD version, so if cost is an issue, that version is still worth viewing (avoid the one tape version that is recorded in very slow speed and will display a blurred image).  The cost of the 3 VHS tape set (used) that I got from someone on Amazon was actually more than the DVD (new) cost from a merchant store for me.

Other than my personal preference noted above, the story of Sara Crewe that relates to personal family tragedy and coping with it, is a worthwhile video program for any family library.

*Update*  I have obtained a two VHS cassette version (apparently released after the three cassette version) and it has some of the scenes in the DVD version not seen on the three cassette version and also has scenes from the three cassette version not seen on the DVD.

Sarah is likeable. Beautiful dresses. Takes you there by more time and details in Sarah's daily life. You feel Sarah's hardships.

The great Shirley Temple version was a different approach with colorful character-actors in the supporting-roles; Shirley's British song and dance numbers with Arthur Treacher; a fast pace, and all eyes on Shirley.

Every scene was how I'd pictured it in my mind while reading the book. And I felt all the same feelings while watching this as I'd had while reading the book. I think sometimes special books really need a miniseries treatment to give them the length they deserve, and this was 2 1/2 hours of sheer enjoyment!

My ONLY complaint is that I wish there had been at least one scene of Sara surrounded by all the school girls while telling one of her stories. The thing that drew the other girls to her the most was her imaginative, original storytelling, and she did this many times in the book but it was never shown in the film. In the book she was popular with all the girls; in this film she was more of a loner with only two friends at the school. Her storytelling was alluded to, but never shown.

Stranger still, is that while Amelia Shankley was the best British child actress of her era, the most famous child actress presently in Japan, Shida Mirai (up for a possible 2010 Oscar Best Foreign Film, Nobody to Watch Over Me!) is performing the title role of Sarah (Seira) in a Japanese TV mini-series adaptation of ""A Little Princess"" (Shokojo Seira) currently as of this writing, still on the air in Japan.

Many people will say that it doesn't matter whether an adaptation is completely faithful to the book upon which it is based, but I myself do feel that if it is going to have the same title, and be billed as an adaptation of a specific author's work, then it is only fair for it to have nearly everything in common with the original story!
This one does. The characters are accurately portrayed, the acting is excellent, the settings are realistic, and we really get a sense both of the true misery of Sara's situation, and of her ability to transcend adversity with her will, her imagination, and her determination to remain a ""princess"" whatever transpires.
I think both the book and the film offer a message that is very, very inspiring for young girls: that every girl can be a true princess, and that behaving in a ""princess-like"" manner means having dignity, being compassionate, and putting the needs of others ahead of one's own.

The sets, costumes, and atmosphere seen throughout the film perfectly match both the descriptions in the book and the time the story is set in. While the plot and scenes contain some added moments and scenarios, they never deviate from the original story and actually seem to fit without changing any important details. Furthermore, the background music and camerawork - while both subtle and perfect - flawlessly sets the mood of each scene and properly draws the attention of the watcher(s) to the right characters and emotions.

This DVD release is superior to the old VHS version in all respects except one: the original VHS version was 180 minutes (3, one hour episodes), while the DVD is 120 minutes (5, 24 minutes episodes). As a result of the cuts, the DVD version feels rushed. At times, critical character establishing dialogue has been skipped. I hope that in the future, this series is released uncut.

Even so, given the cuts, I would still recommend buying this version: if you saw the VHS version, the clarity of the DVD is worth it; and, if you never saw the VHS version, the cuts are not so excessive that they degrade the watching experience.",1246579200,,916,4.613496932515337

I was curious if it was really as good as I remembered, and if it would hold up 20 years later.  Well, the answers are a resounding yes, and yes.

This version gives you the feel that I believe the author intended for it to have. You feel the humility and generosity of Sara when she has money. You feel the intense love she and her father have for each other. When her father dies and she becomes poor, you see her character as she is worked to the bone and yet keeps a positive attitude even until she can hardly stand her dire situation. She always acts like a princess.

When they discover she is rich again, she becomes the true princess that she always was.

When the newer movie version of this came out in 1995, I was so disappointed because it was watered down and fluffy. This version of the movie is a bit sad in parts, but that is what makes it so rewarding in the end. This is a must see movie and one that everyone should own.",1242432000,,997,4.155440414507772

797622,5,6304160208,"Note, this review references a previous DVD release by Granada International and E1 Entertainment in 2009.  Please see below for an update regarding the 2017 Questar release.

This is the definitive adaptation of ""A Little Princess"" to watch!  While the film may suffer somewhat from budgetary limitations (the ""Banquet Hall"" scene never fails to make me cringe,) the value and depth of the story absolutely make up for any shortcomings.  This film is great!

I previously owned the VHS version and was surprised to find that the DVD release is not quite the same as the old VHS release.  The DVD is apparently the original UK version, split into six separate parts (25 minutes each.)  This version has been a long time coming!  When this was rebroadcast on PBS, it was re-edited for US audiences into a three part series, using alternative dialogue and extended scenes.  The US edit was sold as a three VHS set and a slightly edited-for-religious-content version was available as a one or two VHS set.

In comparing the US and UK cuts, I have to say that the US version is longer but now feels more like a dumbed-down edit to me.  Everything in the US cut is explained much more thoroughly.  The UK cut contains whole new scenes not found in the US version and I feel that this makes for a broader, more enjoyable plot.  It's as if the storyline was trimmed for US audiences and then, the remaining scenes extended to ensure that the condensed storyline was even further explained with precision.  Perhaps I'm too harsh -- both cuts certainly have their merits, but I must say that the conclusion is far more poignant and detailed in the UK edit, shown on the DVD.

The picture quality on the DVD release is much better than I was expecting.  Audio quality is average, but clear.  Subtitles are included under the menu options.  Each episode is available under the menu and there is a play-all option, but no special features or extras are included.

While this might not have been exactly what I was expecting, the DVD turned out to be a pleasant surprise.

Added November 24, 2017:

I've just watched through a copy of the Questar release and felt it necessary to update my review after all these years.

Unfortunately,  I cannot recommend the 2017 Questar DVD release.

This edition appears to be the same cut as the ""Feature Films for Families"" releases, but with significantly reduced video quality.  The DVD menu provides only an option to Play Movie and there are no chapter menus (although DVD chapters are present.)  The audio seems similar to other releases.

Where this release fails is the video quality.  It looks like a poor quality upload to a video sharing service being streamed with poor download speed, and this is no exaggeration.  The video is simultaneously soft and blocky at the same time.  There is no fine detail.  Dark scenes get very muddy and often look like pixelated blobs of gray and black.

I own all USA-released dvd's and vhs's and can compare them all and I strongly encourage you to avoid the Questar release at all costs.",1241568000,,3060,4.704331450094162
797623,5,6304160208,To date I'm seen all of the Little Princess films and I've never read the book - so my review is based on the filmed versions not trying to capture a story from a book - which I think tends spoil enjoying a good film. This version is wonderful. It's long enough to be done right without losing it's focus. It has a strong story and is kind to the homeless. I was touched to see it. It was also true to it's self. What I mean by that is the story was not sugarcoated - a window in the life of a child that had been used poorly by fate with a kind heart nearby just a few doors away.,1241049600,,581,3.809917355371901
797624,5,6304160208,"First of all, a word about British TV shows.
A season as we in the US call it is known as a series in the UK. Most series of a show (esp. a new show) are of either six or seven episodes.
This is a Londen Weekend Television production from 1986, and is in the original six episode format.
There are not 30 minutes in each episode, because of where commercials apparently were.
This allows for the original opening titles to be restored as originally seen. Some drawings of the characters are now seen for the first time since the 1986 UK run.
But, this is very close to the original plot of the Frances Hodgson Burnett book.

The story is very heartbreaking throughout, save for the end.  I am not sure if the film is appropriate for younger children due to the theme of death and how real it seems and how heartbreaking the scenes are -- Amelia Shankley gives such a convincing performance as Sara you just want to hug her. The themes of compassion and kindness do provide good teachable moments though.

My only complaint is that some nice scenes were cut out of the original version (including Lottie and Sarah watchng the cute little bird out the attic window). They added a scene of Mr. Carmichael and his wife saying goodbye as he leaves for Russia --- this scene could easily have been left out.

What I am very happy they added was an extended scene of Miss Minchin getting her butt chewed out a bit more! Also, Ermengarde and Becky enter the schoolroom and in front of all the others tell snooty and evil Lavinia how Miss Sarah has become filthy rich.",1237507200,,1113,4.285714285714286

The film version is the same. I have been hoping for years that the Wonderworks series would all go to DVD, so that this version would instantly find a much wider audience.

As many people as possible should see this version! Sara Crewe has both good and bad times once her father leaves her in England and returns to India. The problems that Sara Crewe encountered in Miss Minchin's Select Seminary for Young Ladies must be retained in the film version, as they are in this production, because it is the revelation of Sara's character when she suffers loss and hardship that is so very important for readers of the book and viewers of the movie.

For example, Miss Minchin's cruelty is starkly revealed when she tells Sara that her father has died of 'jungle fever' during her birthday party. The woman is so greedy and venal that she couldn't even wait until the party was over in order to allow the girl to enjoy her last hours in a carefree state of mind.

In general, all WONDERWORKS adaptations are not only more faithful to the original written works, but they somehow manage to capture the spirit of the words visually.

For example, Fraulein Rottenmeyer, Clara's governess, is actually an intelligent and well meaning woman who, until Heidi starts sleepwalking, sincerely believes she is better off in Frankfurt, not the heartless bitch she is made out to be in the significantly inferior Shirley Temple version.)

It portrays Victorian London and the variety of social levels perfectly, which was a major theme of this chidlren's classic-to always behave nicely and like a princess to everyone, in every station of life.  We have the traditional riches to rags/orphan story so highly popular in any fairytale-like story, but this classics goes a step further and introduces us to the hard life of scullery maids, mixed in Victorian London's high society private schools for privileged girls.

He does die, he doesn't come back from the dead, and that is the harsh reality of succombing to fever in India, in those days.

A must see!,970790400,,314,4.254237288135593

7863394,3,6304160208,This was my favorite as a kid! Sadly the copy I received was missing sence which made it hard for my children to understand.,1521331200,,124,4.208333333333333
7863395,5,6304160208,"A classic -- a bit old-fashioned but still well loved.  The book is a nice illustration of ""pretty is as pretty does,"" and Sarah is an intelligent, principled young woman with the inner strength to meet everything that comes her way.  This seems to be the preferred film version.",1521072000,,279,4.673469387755102
7863396,5,6304160208,"I have searched for this production throughout the years. I feel this is the most faithful portrayal of the book. We had this recorded off of PBS when I was a child... and it might still exist somewhere in my parents' house. I was so very happy when my random search returned success! There's a couple of scenes that I noticed were inserted; however, it doesn't detract from enjoyable viewing. There aren't any extra features - but they really didn't to that in the 80's... still, extra features would be interesting.",1519344000,,517,4.6923076923076925
7863397,1,6304160208,The quality of this DVD is horrible. Very fuzzy and not clear at all. My parents VHS recording from way back when it was televised is way better. Dont waste your money.,1519171200,,168,4.28125
7863398,5,6304160208,"THE MOST FAITHFUL adaption of ""A Little Princess"" The Last Doll unfortunately was cut, along with three of Sara's most famous speeches regarding her philosophy about what BEHAVIOR makes you a Princess. The version makes an effort to have Sara in silk, furs velvet, hats decorated with feathers and flowers, while her father is alive, while most versions have her in a school uniform the entire time. The Christmas scenes represent well what it's like to have lost someone over The Holidays. The school looks institutional, matching Miss Minchin's personality, I mean she's too greedy to spend the money to make the school look nice. Sara's original room is nice, bot NOT eye popping. This version keeps the Original ending. This is the GREAT adaption!

As for the Questar realse, we had a lot of VHS tapes that looked grainy, not a big deal, and I'm more concerned about the scences that were snipped. The one that introduces Sara was snipped awkwardly, The scene where the General and Sadie are discussing the statue of Kali was snipped as well. The solution is a BLU-RAY RELEASE, for Blu-Rays can hold lots of data and are known for their image quality. Until than the Questar release, will be fine, the one that cost $39.99 didn't even work!",1519084800,,1244,4.786046511627907
7863399,1,6304160208,"DVD copy that I had was a very poor quality reproduction.  Had I known how bad the quality was going to be I never would have ordered it.  It was as if they had mastered the DVD from a very low-grade VHS copy.  Colors were muted and totally wash out, resolution was terrible.  It seemed slightly better towards the end, but was just awful for the first half.  I have a feeling that this was one of those mastered-on-demand DVDs where they don't make it for you until you order it.  It took me around 7 weeks to get around to viewing it, so by the time I saw how bad it was, I was apparently outside of the return policy period.  I'm irritated with Amazon.",1518998400,,655,4.150793650793651
7863400,5,6304160208,"Great film, had the uses of ""God"" as a swear word edited out, as well the scene was missing where Sarah arranges with the baker to buy bread for all the hungry children.",1518825600,,169,4.151515151515151
7863401,5,6304160208,"I remember watching this on tv when I was younger, but I remember a full length version...I just recently purchased this movie on DVD--I was just wondering if this is the full length version I saw so many years ago or if this is the cut version. I'd prefer a full length version!",1518134400,,279,4.283018867924528
7863402,1,6304160208,"This is a poor copy of this beautifully filmed movie. The first half was very dark and grainy. I am very disappointed in it, and the only reason I kept it is it is very hard to find. One of my favorite movies.",1518134400,,209,3.883720930232558
