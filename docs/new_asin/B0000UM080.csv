1946633,2,B0000UM080,"Like another reviewer here, I was looking forward to seeing the ""Johnny and Mary"" video on this DVD as it rarely receives airtime. Imagine my disgust when the first part of the video has Robert Palmer giving voice over commentary, ruining the opening of the music video! Most of the other music videos have this same voice over commentary for the first 30 seconds.

Another omission is a DVD menu to select each video clip, instead you have to navigate sequentially through the music videos + commentary.",1133308800,23,504,4.793103448275862
1946634,4,B0000UM080,"Other reviewers have covered the main concepts and contents of this Robert Palmer collection competently enough, so I'm just going to mention some good and bad extra details that you may find useful.  At the time of writing this review, Amazon doesn't have any copies for sale. I bought mine for under $18 in Australia, so if you have a multizone player check out the Australian retailers.

When firing up the DVD I was stunned to find there was no option for choosing an individual song. While the songs do actually have chapter stops, you can't pick a song from the front-end menu. You have to select ""play all"" and then keep hitting the "">>I"" button on your remote. A real nuisance if you want to hear the 13th song!

My other major gripe involves Robert giving a brief introduction to the camera for each clip. While I found this to be interesting and a nice touch, the problem is that the producers made an artistic decision to have Robert talking over the ""intro"" of the song (or the ""outro"" of the previous song). So the punchy and seriously groovy intro  of ""Johnny and Mary"" is completely lost. I was not impressed.

A couple of positive points - the sound quality is great on all the songs, video and audio appears to have been remastered .

At the price I paid this was still a good value Robert Palmer collection, but a big opportunity still exists for someone to release a comprehensive Robert Palmer clip DVD collection with more songs, a decent menu system and no voiceovers interfering with the music.",1127952000,42,1517,4.5793357933579335
1946635,3,B0000UM080,"Video Addictions is a 1992 Island Records release now being reintroduced on DVD nearly two years after singer Robert Palmer's passing.  This collection of MTV music videos (which was hosted by Palmer himself), does feature some truly rare work from the singer's early days as a solo artist in the mid 70's, as well as some of the earliest known footage of Palmer in concert (opening for Little Feat circa 1976).  Other than introducing the songs and occassionally describing briefly about the concept of the video, Palmer himself added nothing to this collection.  This isn't actually a career retrospective as there is no interview or discussion corresponding with the videos, just the singer introducing clips with little history or context for them or for the songs.  If you enjoyed Robert Palmer's music, you do get videos for most of his noteable hits including ""You Are In My System"", ""Looking For Clues"", ""I Didn't Mean To Turn You On"", ""Simply Irresistible"" and of course ""Addicted To Love"", as well the his videos with The Power Station.  Several late 80's/early 90's videos are excluded however, likley due to licensing conflicts (Palmer left Island Records in 1987, and ""Simply Irresistible"" is the only non-Island clip in this collection).  Top 20 Hits like ""Mercy Mercy Me/I Want You"", ""Early In The Morning"", and ""You're Amazing"" are not represented at all, although there is a video (made new in 1992) for his late 70's hit ""Every Kinda People"", remade specifically for this project.  All in all, it's what's missing that overshadows what's here.  These clips alongside an interview, especially with the aforementioned missing songs included, would have made a great DVD retrospective for the late singer.  As is, Robert Palmer fans will have to make do.  This is the only widely available DVD release of any of Palmer's solo work currently available in the US.",1115769600,65,1876,5.02258064516129

1946637,5,B0000UM080,"I was a big fan of Robert Palmer growing up in the 80's. When I heard there was a DVD with his videos, I decided to buy it. It has the videos to-Addicted to Love, Simply Irresistible and I Didn't mean to turn you on which I love.",1311984000,,229,3.7916666666666665
1946638,1,B0000UM080,Can't really say much about this DVD since it will not play on either my new Sony Blu-ray player or my older DVD player because it's NOT a region 1 (NTSC) disc as listed. Unfortunately for me Amazon is not clear on this fact and I did not read the back cover until after opening it. Guess I'm now in the market for a PAL format DVD player if I want to watch this disc,1276992000,4,367,3.9066666666666667
1946639,3,B0000UM080,"This DVD collection of Robert Palmers videos is available again thru several suppliers of Amazon.com.  I was able to purchase it new for $8.38.  It is a great DVD and I am glad that I purchased it, but there are several problems with it.

1.  The Amazon description of the DVD says it is a Region 1 format.  It is actually  a PAL/All Regions format.  It would not play on my newer Sony DVD player, but will play on my 5+ year old Emerson DVD player.

2.  Robert Palmer's voice is out of sync with the video.  It looks like an old foreign movie where the dialog doesn't match the movements of the mouth.

3.  No chapter stops.  You can't go directly to a particular video/song.

It would be nice if the manufacturer would remaster this DVD and place Robert Palmer's commentaries between the videos rather than over the videos.  Also, chapter stops for easier access to favorite videos would be helpful.",1259971200,3,901,4.4753086419753085
1946640,1,B0000UM080,"Would have given the Robert Palmer, Addictions, DVD a higher rating - but - it would not play in my DVD player!  Took it to Best Buy and Circuit City and it would not play on any of their machines as well.  It is marked as a (all regions) DVD.  Reading the Amazon information it says that the DVD can not be returned after opening, so it looks like I'm stuck with a DVD that won't play...",1216857600,4,388,4.012987012987013
1946641,2,B0000UM080,I bought this video for one cut.  The Addicted to Love song.  Gotta love those French models in the background.,1215216000,,111,4.5
1946642,3,B0000UM080,"I owned this video on VHS, and replaced it with this DVD version, since VHS player technology is nearly gone.  If you like Robert Palmer, the music is a good selection of his hits.  Palmer himself gives a fairly lukewarm introduction to the videos.  The DVD navigation features are nil.  There are no chapter headings, so one needs to fast-forward through the DVD as if it were a VHS tape.  The video quality is pretty rough, taken from a variety of sources, with a variety of quality from ""not so good"" to ""acceptable.""  Nevertheless, it's great to see Robert Palmer, and to hear his music.",1206835200,,591,4.580952380952381
1946643,4,B0000UM080,"Not sure what benefit my review will have, since Amazon has removed the title from the catalog.  At least the title doesn't show up when a search on Robert Palmer is done in the DVD category. Some complained that Palmer's commentary was over the beginning of some clips.  This wasn't too annoying.",1204156800,,297,4.6923076923076925
1946644,4,B0000UM080,"Very good collection of Palmer's videos, enjoyed the commentary. Surprised it was not listed as PAL. My Panasonic wouldn't but my Philips would play it.
Before things got so PC the use of the palmer girls was a reflection of the age. The Power Station videos and audio are exceptional as are ""Addicted To Love"" and ""Simply Irresistible"". I discovered his vocal power in Dada and Vinegar Joe. His love affair with Jamaica and reggae seems quaint compared to the polished silk tie of his later years. He's sorely missed but the videos carry his ghost well. Highly recommended.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/As-I-Am/dp/B000VEYJP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">As I Am</a>",1197244800,4,710,5.836538461538462
1946645,3,B0000UM080,"The Robert Palmer DVD Collection contains about 15 clips covering the early days through to most of the later hits. Missing are videos for 'I'll be Your Baby Tonight"" and ""She Makes my Day"" but this may be because they were not filmed.

As other reviewers have pointed out, this collection is nothing more than the old video collection which was released at the time of ""Addictions"" in 1992. I also agree with others about the use of Palmer's voice over for alot of the song's introductions. This is particularly poorly done for the ""Johnny and Mary"" video where he talks through the entire song intro and stops just as the first verse is beginning. BAsed on what Palmer says before ""Looking for Clues"" video, it seems he did not like ""Johnny and Mary"" anymore. Another observation is that the video for ""Bad Case of Loving You"" has been replaced with the 1992 remixed version dubbed over the film.  Hard to understand why he chose to remix this song.

So there are a few shortfalls with this DVD. However, considering it contains the majority of his hits and that Robert is no longer with us, the voice overs are forgiveable. In a sense, it is a tribute to Palmer and a good record of what he thought of his songs.

Can be picked up for a good price so worth getting.",1193702400,2,1268,4.476190476190476
