I think the acting is bad, and the story-line is horrible, but my son loves ALL the different sanitation vehicles shown. The video will never make it to Sundance, but my son would give it an award if he was a Gilded Actor member.
I would give video 1 star, but any video that keeps my child's attention deserves a 5.",1218758400,,384,4.133333333333334
8034084,4,B0002X7GQQ,"My son got three of these DVDs as a gift -- the Mighty Construction/Sanitation/Farming Machines and this one is probably his favorite. Sure they are cheesy and the acting is.. well bad. One of the reviewers compared the construction video to a porn movie in terms of production and music track which I found funny (skip the plot, just get to the machines). Nevertheless, my son is facinated by the machines used to clean the beach and streets and can watch it over and over again.",1140912000,,480,4.593023255813954
