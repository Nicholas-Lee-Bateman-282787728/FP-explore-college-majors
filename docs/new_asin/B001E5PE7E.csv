8296572,5,B001E5PE7E,"I taped this movie years ago from the television. I wish I still had the VHS tape. I loved this version. It is exciting, fast moving, and never dull. John Mills plays a fabulous role which sets the plot. I have seen several versions of this movie, but this one is my favorite. I am waiting for it to come out in region 1 format. I do hope it will soon.",1341446400,,352,3.971830985915493
8296573,5,B001E5PE7E,"The Thirty-Nine Steps, 1979 film

This movie begins in a dark foggy city with a horse-drawn carriage. There is a four-door automobile. A man watches a house. ""War is inevitable."" Scudder gives his report, his superiors doubt him. The peace of the world is in danger! Scudder is surprised as he leaves. A Lord addresses a meeting. Outside a man is killed by a rifle shot. Two men enter an apartment building and walk up the stairs. Colonel Scudder enters Richard Hannay's apartment to ask for help and explain his fears. The assassination of a Greek premier will cause another war. [Note the right to keep and bear arms then.] The foreign agents discover Scudder's note and enter Hannay's apartment. But Scudder slips away, only to be follwed! He meets Hannay but won't give him any more information.

The police arrest Hannay on suspicion and question him. An automobile arrives, two men kidnap Hannay from the police and take him to a safe house for questioning. Foreign agents? The police are searching for Hannay as a triple murderer! Hannay finds that notebook and escapes on a train. Then he stops the train to escape from a police search. Hannay travels through the fields to escape. A change of clothes provides a disguise. The foreign agents are on his trail and shoot at him. Hannay meets a hunting party and is rescued under the name `Royce'. Later a gamekeeper is found murdered in the woods. The British will continue to search for Hannay, even knowing him to be innocent. Police walk through fields searching with rifles. Hannay escapes by going to a political meeting. ""Vote Liberal"". Are those latecomers really what they seem to be? What does the speech mean? Hannay rides a bicycle to get away.

A monoplane buzzes him, he leaves the bicycle. Then he is caught by those two foreign agents and take to a sanatarium for more questioning. [A health resort provides good cover for meeting people.] They want Scudder's notebook. Hannay presses a button for room service. There is an unusual event where Hannay escapes from his room while the foreign agents watch! Where is the real notebook? They figure it out. Will those foreign agents strike again? ""Sleepers will proceed as planned."" The Greek Premier will address Parliament as scheduled? Can he be saved? Hannay leads the police to the house where he was held earlier. They learn of an impersonation to gain official papers on the dispostion of the British fleet, critical information when war begins. The clues are followed to learn of the plot and the location. Can they stop the passage of time? Hannay will try. The crowd below stares at the Big Ben clock. There is exciting action to grab your attention! The good guys win in the end, of course.

The original story is worth reading. It tells about a man who falls into a dangerous intrigue and survives. This inspired Eric Ambler's novels of the 1930s. This version was modified from the original novel and is also very good. A scene-for -scene copy of the 1935 version wouldn't be as interesting. Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" and ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" were variations on this story. John Buchan was more than a novelist, compare him to Ian Fleming. Buchan's novels reflect the WW I era, parts are dated now. The character of Franklin P. Scudder was changed, but it makes more sense this way. [Would the efficient British Secret Service have allowed Prussian agents to operate freely in 1914?]",1335052800,,3427,4.793570219966159
8296574,5,B001E5PE7E,"The original Hitchcock classic has our hero running from his pursuers with a women. When he is in a theater a man known as Mister Memory begins to spill what he has memorized when the phrase ""what are the 39 steps"" is asked of him. Mister Memory is shot by the German spies.

I've seen that version and several other versions of this movie. This version is most true to the book. For those that love Hitchcock, they only care about his version and all others since are considered inferior to it.

This movie stands out for its acting, the musical score and settings. The 1939 version is black and white.

The villian in this 1979 version is David Warner. Who comes off very well as a German spy embedded in pre world war one England as an important businessman with ties to prominent politicans and British royalty. He in turn sends two secret sleeper agents to kill a retired English spy mister Scutter, portrayed by John Mills who has uncovered their spy ring. He also sends his agents to kill a politican that Scutter has told about the German spy ring and their plot to assasinate a foreign digitary who will be speaking in England to the British Parliment. Warner kills another politican himself that has spoken to Scutter.

Scutter enlists his neighbor mister Hannay when he has no escape from his apartment building. Scutter must flee the building when Hannay's apartment is entered by the spies searching for him but Scutter is chased and killed at the train station where Hannay is buying a ticket to Scotland. Scutter dies in Hannay's arms and attempts to tell him where the notebook is that has all of his research. Mister Hannay is blamed for Scutter's murder and arrested and questioned and charged as a spy. He is freed by the real German spies who want to know what he knows about their plans. He escapes his captors and attempts to find Mister Scutter's notebook which will prove his innocense. He can't find the notebook but a clue. He heads to Scotland to find the notebook that Scutter mailed to himself at a small Scottish Post Office. Hannay is being pursued by the spies. He outwits them for part of his journey and then is caught. He is given a drug that creates paralysis. Gradually he regains control of his body and with the help of a noble Scottish arisocrat and his fiancee he is once again safe for the time being.

The cat and mouse game continues and the spies continue to pursue him until they think he is dead. The final scenes of the movie are great. With Hannay, the reluctant hero, once again attempting to stop their plan by preventing the hands of Big Ben from reaching 11:45.

This is one of my all time favorite films. I highly recommend it to any serious movie goer who appreciates a well done spy action film.",1330214400,,2751,4.536290322580645
8296575,5,B001E5PE7E,"In my opinion this is the best version of 'The 39 Steps' ever made, not that there is anything wrong with the Robert Donat version or the Kenneth More version either.  This one just happens to outstrip the other two with its sheer charisma, fine direction from Don Sharp, wonderful locations, superb acting and a truly tense climax which will hold your interest until the very end.  A great cast is led by Robert Powell as Hannay with a solid supporting cast including Sir John Mills, David Warner, Eric Porter and George Baker.  Definitely not to be missed.  And it is a great pity that it has not had a Region 1 release as it would undoubtedly be popular to the US market.",1323734400,3,674,4.455284552845528
