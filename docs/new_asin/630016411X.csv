224232,5,630016411X,"I'm hoping someone can tell me if this 6th season completes the animated series of the 80ies. ? Since I can only pre-order this set for now, I'm giving it the benefit of doubt and granting it 5 stars. To be honest, I never expected the whole series to make it to DVD and in order to begin with. So I guess I'm gratefull it made it at all, regardless of the video quality it's in.

My only regret is that they didn't start releasing the series to DVD in this fashion sooner (as box-sets, I mean). If they had, then they would have finished releasing it almost 2 years ago by now. My guess is that they wanted to test the market first to see if it would sell. The advantage to that is also that it considerably reduced the price for individual discs sold and made it more attractive to potential buyers.

But I would have purchased it all anyway regardless of the price since... IT'S THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES !!!  :)  great nostalgia of a time long gone when I didn't have to work every saturday morning and I could watch the cool cartoons on TV with my kid sister. Those memories are priceless to me. In my opinion the only people that would buy this anyway are people looking for a ride down memory lane like me.

From the previous releases I can tell you this much. The quality of the video is NOT Disney quality. (I don't think they were even remastered). BUT.. The quality is equal if not a little superior to what it looked like on my family's 20 inch cable TV back when it aired. And that, to me, is all I need. I don't think I would ever buy this in HD anyway, even if they ever release it that way in the future.",1204416000,2,1627,4.1687898089171975
224233,5,630016411X,"All the DVD converted ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" are of excellent quality, both sound and picture. Its a great opportunity to introduce  this excellent cartoon series to a new generation of kids who are starved for watching Fun animation, & now at the convenience of 'anytime' not just Sat. mornings.  Much worth the investment.",1192233600,,332,5.12962962962963
224234,5,630016411X,"If ever you were a fan of the Ninja Turtles, you MUST own the complete set of the original tv series. Once you watch these dvds, you'll regress back to childhood and want everything ""Ninja Turtle"". Great for new Ninja fans too!",1178928000,,227,4.428571428571429
224235,5,630016411X,"I loved it! if your a fan of the old cartoons or the movies, you will love this. its fun and entertaining",1168819200,,105,3.8181818181818183
224236,4,630016411X,The last volume of Lionsgate as they plan to release the rest of eps of TMNT in season sets instead of individual volumes. This one ends the Season 3 and the last ep Plan 6 from Outer Space have diff ending credits and it's marked copyright 1990. The eps mainly focuses on the rising of the Technodrome from the center of Earth to the surface and the conquering of the world by Krang which fails due the incompetence of Bebop and Rocksteady. In the last ep the Turtles won a trip to Europe grom a Pizza brand ad thing that we won't see until season 7. I'm waiting to see the 4th season sets.,1167609600,4,591,4.192982456140351
224237,5,630016411X,"Finally, the last episodes of season 3. These episodes are just as good as the ones on volume 5, if not better. The last 3 episodes of season 3, ""The Big"" three-part story arch, has to be the best story of the entire run, giving an excellent conclusion to the best season of TMNT. Volume 6 also has the first episode of season 4 and that episode takes place right after The Big Blow out and sets the stage for the european vacation story arch. As great as the three-part-finale is, there are also other great episodes, the most notable episode is Shredderville, which is a rather darker than usual, alternetive reality-based episode. Very enjoyable and a fan favourite. Other great episodes are The Great Boldini, The Missing Map and The Turtle Terminator, which is a very silly but hilarious episode, sort of a guilty pleasure. Many recurring characters return, like The Rat King, Baxter Stockman and General Tragg. The Shredder and Krang are also as brilliant as ever. I recommend Vol. 6 for fans of TMNT or just any fan of good entertainment.",1165795200,18,1045,4.684782608695652
224238,5,630016411X,"It may not be the longest running cartoon or children's program, but you have to admit, the original Ninja Turtles show definitely is a rarity in the animation world: not only did it total an impressive 10 seasons, but a respectable 193 episodes as well.  Vol. 6 finally wraps up the show's 3rd season (at this point, the series was still in syndication and not on Saturdays), with some fun episodes like Shredderville which features the Turtles stuck in a nightmarish alternate-reality where Shredder rules Manhattan, all mutants are outlawed, and an unstable Technodrome is stuck in the middle of town and threatening to explode at any second; Bye Bye Fly, which brings back Baxter Fly for yet another confrontation with the mutants; and the Turtle Terminator, in which the Turtles fight a killer robot duplicate of Irma(this episode also features Hal Rayle and Greg Berg performing the respective roles of Raphael and Donatello instead of the usual Rob Paulsen and Barry Gordon).  Best of all, some of these episodes are actually new to me.  There were a few episodes that I sadly missed when I watched it back in 1989, so I'm thankful for the DVD release so I can finally see these for the first time.

Season 3's finale marked another multi-part arc, this time a 3-parter that notably has the words ""The Big"" at the beginning of each title.  As we remembered at the end of season 2 (aka vol. 2), Shredder and Krang's giant mechanical moving fortress, the Technodrome, escaped Dimension X, only to wind up being buried in the Earth's core and left low on power, thus keeping it from escaping its prison.  The past season focused on the bad guys trying to find an energy source to restore it to its full strength.  Now, the Technodrome has at last been restored to normal (thanks to Bebop and Rocksteady of all characters!), and the Turtles must now stop it with the fate of the entire planet hanging in the balance.  Part 2: The Big Break-In is another episode I've never seen before, so I'm really happy to finally see all three parts in order. (I actually saw part 3 first, so I was shocked to see the Technodrome suddenly pop up out of nowhere).

The final episode, as well as the first episode of the show's 4th season, Plan 6 from Outer Space, notable for its title sendup of the infamous Ed Wood film Plan 9 from Outer Space, serves as not only an epilogue to the 3-parter but a lead in to the next arc as well.  At the end of the episode Michelangelo winds up winning a vacation in Europe, which sends the Turtles vacationing throughout the country for the next 10 or so episodes.  However, although these episodes were made, they didn't air until the show's 7th season.  Whether these will wind up on vol 7 in production order or on a much future volume in airdate order we'll have to wait and see.

I'm happy that Lion's Gate is at least getting better at bringing the releases out (as opposed to where we had to wait a year for the second volume!), and unlike Disney's multiple Disney Afternoon-era DVD sets, the quality and menus are at least decent, although I still wish we had some sort of bonus material.  Still, the low price range and the fact that it has 2-4 times the amount of episodes most single DVD sets have still make it a good pickup, especially if you've been a huge fan of this show like myself.",1165708800,12,3327,4.54180602006689
224239,4,630016411X,"Season six was another fairly good season. I remember the episode ""Shredderville"", good timing for the release because this is the It's a Wonderful Life call back. The show got weird starting with the seventh season.",1165536000,,216,5.027777777777778

224403,5,630016411X,"In the fall of 1992, the next 16 episodes of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were seen every Saturday morning.  The animation and soundtrack got even better over time.  This DVD set consists of Episodes #128 through #143.

Episode #128:  Leonardo hears a distress signal and goes to investigate it.  When the other Turtles return, they think that Leonardo was kidnapped!  (Turns out that Leonardo heard the distress from a trio of dinosaurs, whom later befriend him.)

Meanwhile, Krang has his most devious scheme yet to take the Technodrome out of the icy Arctic.  He plans to turn the Earth on its axis, causing the polar ice caps to melt and causing a huge climate change!  When Shredder gets word that Leonardo is missing, he uses Bebop as a decoy to lure the other Turtles into a battle while he and Krang build their new Hyper Thruster to execute their evil plan.  But as always, the T.M.N.T. is one step ahead of the nefarious villains and manage to stop them once again.

Episode #129:  Tired of the Technodrome being trapped under the ice, Shredder and Krang launch their ultimate plan to free themselves -- by launching a new satellite Super Laser from NASA.  Krang distracts the Turtles by enlisting General Traag's help.  He uses his Rockalyzer to turn rocks into his fellow minions.  While the T.M.N.T. deal with that chaos, Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady break into NASA to attach the remote control to the satellite so that Krang can control it from his Technodrome.

Once the T.M.N.T. make work of General Traag's rock minions, Krang quickly sends him back home before the Turtles have a chance to capture him!  But it's not over yet -- Krang uses the satellite's Super Laser to free the Technodrome, which he finally manages to accomplish.  So what can the Turtles do now?!  By employing Master Splinter's meditation called Wu-Wee, they use their mental minds to cause Bebop and Rocksteady to fight with each other.  Bebop accidentally breaks the Super Laser's controls, causing it to create a big hole in the ice -- and the Technodrome is headed right for it!!  Shredder and Krang are helpless to stop it, and it falls right under the ice, landing at the bottom of the ocean!!  NOW what will those evil villains do?!  :)

Episode #130:  Krang, inside his Bubble Walker, helps the Foot Soldiers tune up his robot android body.  But when Bebop and Rocksteady accidentally insert a video game chip inside it, Krang's body goes absolutely bonkers!  Not only that, but Shredder falls down a big hole and suffers amnesia in the process!  :(  The T.M.N.T. find out what happened and fail to stop Krang's body from attacking NYC -- at first.  But thanks to Michaelangelo's video game know how, they are able to stop Krang's body once and for all, destroying it in the process.  And yes, Shredder does get his memory back too.

Episode #131:  The Turtles fellow friend, Kerma, returns to NYC from the planet of Shangri-La.  He informs the T.M.N.T. that a robot by the name of Destructor X was sent to destroy him!  There is lots of great music is in this episode, and the action is quite intense!  Big Louie and his henchmen also make an appearance, causing even more trouble for the Turtles.

Episode #132:  Irma accidentally gets some mutagen spilled on her, and it causes her to gain some super powers!  She uses her newfound powers to stop Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady from stealing the Anti Magnet.  She succeeds at first, but as Shredder always says -- he tries and tries again.  The T.M.N.T. start to become concerned about Irma and follow her around NYC.  When she notices Shredder stealing the Anti Magnet a second time, she accidentally falls inside his transport module and gets driven back to the Technodrome!  When Krang gets wind of what happened, he has the Foot Soldiers capture her (because her newfound powers have already worn off).

So the T.M.N.T. devise a plan to drive their Turtle Van underwater and break into the Technodrome.  Not only do they rescue Irma, but Donatello rewires the Anti Magnet into a REGULAR magnet, causing a fleet of ships to destroy the Technodrome.

Episode #133:  Professor Sopho makes another return (he was previously seen in Episode #96:  Donatello's Degree) and intends to pull the Earth towards the sun, causing it to become extremely hot!  The T.M.N.T. come across Vernon's nephew, Foster, much to their chagrin.  However, Foster eventually sees the good side of the Turtles and decides to help them locate Professor Sopho's new hideout.  Foster uses his own magnet invention against Sopho and restores the Earth to its natural gravity -- AWAY from the sun, of course.

Episode #134:  Krang encounters an old female foe, Shreeka.  She demands that Krang give her the powerful energy ring that he allegedly stole from her.  He tricks her by stating that April O'Neil has it.  She quickly follows suit and kidnaps Bebop and Rocksteady in the process.  When Shreeka and April finally meet, it's a very ugly battle.  This isn't one of my favorite episodes, but the good part is, Shreeka DOES get her comeuppance, so stay tuned in to the episode to find out what happens!

Episode #135:  Slash, the evil Turtle from Dimension X, returns to NYC -- but he's a complete and utter genius now!  When Donatello finds out what happened, he tries to warn the other T.M.N.T. of Slash's comeback.  When they all meet up with Slash at Channel 6, he traps them in a coat of ice, using one of his diabolical inventions.  He also turns Vernon and Burne Thompson into Turtles -- oh no!!  :(  April eventually frees the Turtles from their icy prison and helps them capture Slash once and for all.  The Turtles manage to trick Slash into turning Vernon and Burne back to normal, then they have the ultimate battle with him.  When Slash falls to his imminent doom, he turns back to his normal, dumb self and loses his genius brain powers in the process.

Episode #136:  Shredder notices a Japanese sword and intends to steal it.  Meanwhile, Krang intends to build an army of mud mutants by destroying the Tri-State Bridge -- with the trucks on it that contain very explosive chemicals.  It's up to the T.M.N.T. to stop both him and Shredder and get the sword back!  Master Splinter plays a pivotal role in this episode.

Episode #137:  Michaelangelo accidentally turns on Donatello's Dream-O-Vision Helmet, causing his dreams to become reality!  But that's not all -- a ghostly figure by the name of Creepy Eddie manages to get himself out of the Dream World and into the Turtles' Lair!  It's up to the rest of the T.M.N.T. -- AND Master Splinter, to stop Eddie and send him back from whence he came.

Episode #138:  The final Shredder and Krang episode on this DVD (don't worry -- they'll return for a bunch of episodes on Season 7!).  Krang launches his grandest scheme yet -- he intends to build a fake Treasure Island to lure Big Louie, Pinky McFingers, and Mad Dog McMutt so that he can cause them to float away.  This will cause Krang to be the ONLY ruler of the entire underworld!
Meanwhile, the T.M.N.T. have their own problems when Michaelangelo accidentally touches Donatello's Revivifier Ray, causing the 3 Turtles to shrink to Mini Turtle size!  Stay tuned to the episode to find out how the T.M.N.T. get out of this little predicament (pun intended) and stop the fake Treasure Island from floating away.

Episodes #139 through #143 feature other brand new villains, and there will also be a second appearance by April O'Neil's aunt, Agatha the detective (previously seen on Episode #51).",1396915200,2,7540,4.755401234567901

The first disc has them dealing with mostly the same villains Shredder and Krang. Though one show from 2nd disc should actually be on the first disc too. Leonardo is Missing is SO out of sorts on the second disc. It has the Technodrome back in the arctic, and by that time, it should be in the ocean. So Leonardo is Missing should be watched before the first show even on the first disc.

224519,3,630016411X,"With the release of the Sixth Season of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Original Series, once again another season that wasn't that long of a season.  At this time it was like that of the franchise was starting to die down a bit and not have that many episodes to make up a season or running out of ideas by the time that this season had come along.  I'm not sure which cause I was still a kid at the time that this season had come about and some episodes I don't remember that much cause of not airing that many episodes in my area at the time.  This set contains what says the `16' episodes that make up this season, although I'm not sure how many episodes may have been left out in this season but as far as I know all of them are in this set.  The writing at this point seemed to be not as good as the previous seasons, though they're trying to make this show still fresh to the fans that were still watching the show at the time.  Overall this set gets 3 stars out of 5.",1279756800,,973,4.020725388601036
224520,2,630016411X,"Although on the cover it says `13' episodes on the cover but really this is like the final `12' episodes of Season 3.  The reason for that is that they somehow managed to put the first episode of Season 4 amongst this set and that really don't make any sense on why they would want to do that.  Just like the first `5' volumes this is the same way, all episodes on one disc, not leaving to put anything else with them.  While I like having the set for the episodes but how the series has been handled, makes some wonder if this was the way that they had planned for the series which in a way not good for the company.  Overall I give this set like the others 2.5 stars out of 5.",1279756800,,678,4.0

224524,5,630016411X,"I have collected The first 6 volumes of the 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, including Seasons Four, Five, and Six, and they were totally awesome! Many fans are worrying about the missing episodes, ""Once Upon a Time Machine"", and ""Planet of the Turtleoids"" Part 1 and Part 2, and I wish they will included as bonuses in future releases. Season 7 should be the sideseason which took place between episodes 66 and 67, while the Technodome is in Dimension X, and the season that chronologically began at where Episode 143 left off. The Technodrome is still located at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean until the last episode, when it is sent back to Dimension X. Seasons Eight, Nine and Ten each had 8 Episodes, so they have released together in one DVD Set, and include the three missing episodes. Please Lionsgate, release the last 4 Seasons, including the missing episodes!",1214438400,,872,4.781456953642384

224526,4,630016411X,"Well, first of all from reading previous reviews lot of people are upset by not seeing ""Invasion of the Turtleoids part 1 and 2""  from '91 year episodes #126, 127 and ""Once Upon a Time machine"" '91 episode #107. Well guess what?  I'm upset by it too but fortunately I'm one of the few people out there that at least have those 3 episodes on vhs tape still.  Better than not having them at all I guess.?  I HOPE they put them in some future dvd collection to wrap up all seasons. Who knows i guess.  Fred Wolf Films and Lionsgate do weird things I tell ya.  Maybe they thought those particular 3 episodes aren't important.??  Well guess what they are!  Especially, the turtleoid episodes are. Like in this season 6 that just came out. When you see the ""Return of the turtleoid"" episode in this new released season your be like... huh? Where did that character come from?  I hope they tie up all the loose ends there.  Season 6 is great but not 100% grade A quality which is weird knowing its a good 1-3 yrs before they release different seasons. You would think in that time frame they would make it more professional quality.??  COME on Lionsgate/fred wolf films please! get it together!!  Anyway, ""Krangstein LIVes"", ""Leonardo is Missing"" are my faves in this season! The cartoons DONT go in the right order according to the dvds in the set.  ""leonardo is missing"", then ""Rock around the Block"" are the first 2 episodes of the season 6. If you don't watch them 2 first your be lost again.  Next season 7 is even worse. Season 7 will be way out of whack.  According to the net here the first 13 episodes of season 7 shouldnt even go in that season they should be in season 4, the '90,'91 yrs.  I wish they would just put season 7, 8 on dvd box set together to finish off this series.  ONly time will tell I guess.?  Weird but cool, watch krang's pigment coloring change in the episode,""Adventures in Turtle-sitting"". No bonus features in this season??  Wish it had subtitle feature. Sometimes its hard to tell what certain characters say sometimes.",1212192000,4,2048,4.471698113207547

224528,5,630016411X,"I am so thrilled that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Season 6 DVD is coming out Tuesday, April 8. I am collecting the previous season DVDs and therefore refusing to sell them. The original cartoon series will never be equal with the current TMNT series today. Nowadays, it seems like all the old classic songs, TV series, and whatever that occurred in the past is revisiting. It is good because the new age of music or TV series is unprofessional and not really that good to listen or view. It is no lie that everything (music, TV series, food, anything) was so much better in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and the 90s.",1207353600,4,606,4.468468468468468

My only complaint is that these DVD's were put together before all the TV's were HD so they're not as clear as they would be if they were on BluRay.  Overall, it's a great deal and something every fan of the original series should have.",1464566400,,420,4.358974358974359
