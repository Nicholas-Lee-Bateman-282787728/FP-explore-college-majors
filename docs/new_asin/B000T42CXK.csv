8207724,2,B000T42CXK,"When I was a teenager, I absolutely loved ""Hercules, the Legendary Journeys,"" an action-packed series about a Greek hero who fought evil.  For purely nostalgic purposes, I purchased a DVD of the first two episodes of Season 1.

""The Wrong Path"".  After Hercules' wife and children are murdered by his vengeful stepmother, the goddess Hera, Hercules decides to destroy her seven temples.  His friend, Aeolus, goes on a journey to free a land from the evil She-Demon, a seeductive monster who is turning men into stone.
""Eye of the Beholder"".  Hercules must fight an evil Cyclops.

I do not know if it was my high expectations, or if my interests have changed dramatically.  However, I found these episodes to be flat and unimaginative.  Kevin Sorbo, (Hercules), does fairly well, but I felt the other actors/actresses were average at best.  If you're looking for an afternoon escape, these episodes may be what you're after.  However, I do not recommend these shows to someone looking for lots of character development.  God bless you.",1273449600,,1034,4.988304093567251
