7595102,5,B01A7ZI6CQ,"Great music. Nice to see the guys having such a good time while putting on the show,you get to see there personality's really coming out. We all knew they could sing . But this shows that they are still the group we all fell in love with as if this was the first time they were on stage together. Now they know each other better which makes the show better. You can see the fun they are having and that comes across in there performance.",1456531200,3,437,4.152941176470589
7595103,4,B01A7ZI6CQ,"I just finished watching the DVD.  As usual it did not disappoint!  All the songs were wonderful and had me singing along! Yes, majority of the songs were on other DVDs.  But I knew that going in so that is what I expected.  I was very torn between a 5 star or 4 star review. The reason for the 4 stars is two part (much like the DVD): 1) Last week one part of the concert was released on DVD.  There were some songs on the PBS showing that were not on the DVD so it was not 100% the same.  I feel like the release date should have coincided with the PBS show.  But I am sure that is to get PBS money which I understand.  The second part for the 4 star is that I find it silly that it is being released in two parts (or pay a fortune on PBS to get part 2 now).  I don't like having to wait till Fall to see the rest of the concert.  But I will wait till Fall and purchase part 2 at that time.  I also wish it had some behind the scenes or special features like Mythology did.  But I guess I can't have it all!
Bottom line...if you are a Celtic Thunder fan go ahead and purchase!  Even though most songs are repeats there are usually slight changes due to different band members.",1456444800,,1178,3.899159663865546
7595104,5,B01A7ZI6CQ,"This show was filmed during Celtic Thunder's 2015 American tour, The Very Best of Celtic Thunder.  The show was renamed Legacy for the DVD & CD products, presumably because they had already released a CD of studio-recorded group songs (not the same songs sung during the show) titled The Very Best of Celtic Thunder.  This is their first show they've produced in BluRay and it's BEAUTIFUL, sound and picture both are absolutely amazing.  There's also very few cuts to the audience in the middle of songs, which is something that drives me crazy about some of their other DVDs.

Tracks on this DVD (runtime is 1 hour):
Heartland (Group)
Danny Boy (Emmett)
Galway Girl (Group)
Mountains of Mourne (Keith)
Ride On (Ryan)
Buchaille On Eirne/Come By The Hills (Damian)
Raggle Taggle Gypsy (Group)
Black Velvet Band (Colm)
The Dutchman (Keith)
Falling Slowly (Damian)
A Place in the Choir (Group)
Noreen (Neil)
Caledonia (Group)
Ireland's Call (Group)

Songs they sang during the 2015 tour shows NOT on this DVD (Edit: thanks to PhilV for the complete list):
Now We Are Free (Keith)
Home (Damian)
Song for Mira (Group)
Isle of Inisfree (Emmett)
Heartbreaker (Ryan)
Lauren and I (Keith)
Take Me Home (Group)
Katie (Colm)
Hallelujah (Neil, Keith & Ryan)
Breaking Up Is Hard To Do (Damian)
That's A Woman (Ryan & Emmett)
Remember Me (Emmett)
Life With You (Tribute to George) (Group)
Seven Drunken Nights (Group)
Streets of New York (Ryan)
Mo Ghile Mear (Group)

These songs are on Legacy Volume 2, which according to their website is being released this fall, unless you purchase through the March public television donation drive.  Why they split 1 show into 2 DVDs and separated their releases by 6 months is beyond me (other than to make an extra buck), their marketing team gets 0 stars.",1456444800,48,1783,4.8841059602649

7595175,5,B01A7ZI6CQ,"My first encounter with Celtic Thunder was the Legacy PBS concert for that was aired in February 2016, and Legacy Volume 1 was the first DVD that I purchased, shortly thereafter.

It was a bit disappointing to discover that the concert had been split into two volumes and that some of the songs I had enjoyed on the PBS event would be held for the second, but this was, nevertheless, a very enjoyable DVD.  Volume 2 was recently made available for preorder, and provided yet another letdown.  Unlike Volume 1, which was beautifully manufactured in Blu-Ray, Volume 2 will be DVD only, according to the groups website.  A frustrating decision by whoever makes those decisions, since Blu-Ray offers such superior visual quality.  I understand that the split was because Volume 2 was a PBS pledge gift, but its always disheartening to see a concert split up into two volumes and then presented in inconsistent formats.

As the word Legacy suggests, this concert is a celebration of some of the classic favorites which long-time fans have enjoyed over the years, some of which I am assuming will be retired once this promotional tour is over.  In collecting their older DVDs, Ive become very fond of some of the original members, but in reflection of the comings and goings of past members, the group as it appears in Legacy has held up to the changes very well, and in fact, the versions of some songs, including Heartland and Irelands Call, are among the best theyve ever done. I also enjoyed seeing new versions of old standards such as Ride On, Come by the Hills, Noreen, Caledonia, and Place in the Choir.

I can find no fault with any of the singers in this concert.  They are wonderful to watch both solo and with the ensemble, and the blending of their voices is, as usual, beautiful to listen to.  The drummer, Declan O'Donoghue, is mesmerizing to watch, and the dueling drums segment with him, Neil Byrne, and John OBrien was pure entertainment. An added bonus was having Damian back as a guest performer, and although it does not relate to this DVD, I applaud his decision to remain with the group for the remainder of the promotional tour here in the United States.

There are, as always in a CT DVD, cutaway shots to the audience, but there seemed to be fewer of them here, but during the cut-aways, I cant help but smile at the vast age-range that attend a CT concert.  It was nice to hear a few comments from the performers between songs, which made it seem more like a real concert.

It is my hope that in the coming year, when Colm is supposed to return and with the addition of new member, Michael ODwyer, we may perhaps finally hear some new things from them.  Im keeping my fingers crossed, for no group can survive forever on its past laurels.  Its time for new material.",1467763200,,2787,4.590725806451613
7595176,4,B01A7ZI6CQ,"I love this DVD. I love this group. I love these guys because they always make me smile. I find their songs not only enjoyable but relaxing. My only complaint about this DVD is that Keith shortened The Dutchman, which is a shame. That is a song that needs to be sung it its entirety, It is also hard to understand some of their words, but I can live with that.

7595271,4,B01A7ZI6CQ,"I got to see Celtic Thunder when they did their American tour years ago with the original band in SC: Ryan Kelly, a young Damian McGintry (14 at the time), Paul Byrom, Keith Harkin and George Donaldson.  I was disappointed when Damian left so I was so glad to hear he was returning for this production.  However, I was expecting a little more...perhaps I read the pre-order review wrong but I was led to believe that Legacy was going to be somewhat of a tribute to George who passed away unexpectedly in March 2014.  I thought the songs were going to be repeats of originals performed during prior concerts so I ""thought"" George would be in some of them.  Once I started watching I realized it was a whole new group, Ryan and Keith are still originals and a grown-up Damian was now singing many of the bass parts that George would have done.  I still enjoyed the show...wish they would have had some more popular American songs.  I loved the country version of ""Place In The Choir.""  What really disappointed me is that at the very end of the show they didn't even insert an ""In Memory Of George Donaldson"" somewhere.  Come on guys...he was Celtic Thunder's balladeer and sorry, no one will replace him.  I am currently watching this show on ETV/PBS and am totally in awe of the price they are asking for.  I know inpurchasing it you will be supporting public television but if you are a fan of Celtic Thunder I would encourage you to purchase it here!!  They are also advertising Legacy Volume 2 but I haven't seen it.  I can't wait for it to be available on Amazon...gotta add it to my collection!!  1 day late but Happy St. Patrick's Day from a Native American/Irish kid!!",1458259200,,1675,4.488448844884489

7595273,1,B01A7ZI6CQ,"I will be very honest here - I broke down and purchased this album when I said I wasn't.  I already have all their previous albums except duplicates.  I've either gotten them direct from CT or from Amazon or other vendors.  To say that I am disappointed is putting it mildly.  I knew ahead of time that they were going to split this CD into two, which is so unfair to their  fans.  What else is unfair is that they have re-recorded their old music onto their new label, Sony, so if you want to get the originals, you have to go through a used CD site or be lucky enough to have duplicated them onto your computer.  There is NO new music on this CD.  It's the worst I've ever heard, nothing near what their originals were of this music.  I have to wonder whether they have no new music in them that they have to continue re-releasing their music with different titles.  This one was so similar to Heritage - Legacy (but you have to buy two versions of Legacy since they split it up.  There were a few pathetic runs or trills, but this is not worth the price I paid.

These men are all immensely talented, which makes it such a shame that they aren't doing new music.  If you want to see new music, then buy the solo albums put out by Keith and by Ryan and Neal.  I watched the show on PBS and could not believe it - this was heads and tails the worst show I've seen them do.  What has Damien's voice turned into - it's nowhere near what it used to be.  Perhaps he needs to get busy and work on it.  I also wondered why he had so many solos - and ""Breaking Up is Hard to do"" was painful.  Damien, you aren't a kid anymore.  Grow up.  I'm so sorry to see that yet again, CT is choosing to rest on its laurels - makes me wonder if they don't need Phil Coulter back to whip them into shape yet again.  Don't waste your money.  Emmet - the ""new"" Emmet is no replacement for either Paul Byrom OR Emmet Cahill - he shows no feeling when he sings.  The notes are there, but there's no meaning in them.  Then again, it's hard to keep on singing the same songs time after time.  It is just plain sad.",1458086400,6,2089,4.048899755501222
7595274,1,B01A7ZI6CQ,"I had just purchased the latest DVD called Legacy. I found it to be very disappointing aside other issues and am very disappointed with Celtic Thunder. First off one would think signing up with Sony would account for top notch recordings aside other things. This was all but and the voices sounded like they were in an echo chamber. Whoever was behind the controls of that should be fired and never allowed to work that field again. Next, how about some new songs, same stuff over and over. Its okay maybe to repeat a song once in awhile but you have done repeating way too many times. Aside from looking horrible the singers looked like they rushed the entire thing and just couldn't wait to get off the stage. This certainly isn't the Celtic Thunder I am use to seeing and really believe this DVD is going to hurt you more then do you good. I have to wonder if this is just a last minute put together and Celtic Thunder is dismantling. If it isn't that, is sure is how it comes off. I couldn't wait for St Paddy's Day to see the tour and get my tickets. I just may pass this time as see where and how things go. A fan from the start and so disappointed as well as a waste of my money on Legacy.",1458000000,2,1196,4.2043478260869565

7595277,5,B01A7ZI6CQ,"A decade really is a long span of time, isn't it?  I only recently became interested in Celtic Thunder and so the passage of the years flew by in a matter of hours on my screen.  Damian went from a grinning kid with braces to a handsome young man with perfect hair.  Fame and the passage of time has changed their faces over the fleeing years.

There are the expected criticisms of the show: same songs, no new material, show packaged in two separate dvds.

What I saw with Legacy was a show beautifully produced.  It did look and feel like a live show because they introduced songs and talked to the audience which gave the feel of a live performance.  What I found most stunning is what confident and strong singers they have become.  There is a strength, a volume, a confidence, a maturity here that comes from years of hard work and determination.

I hope they go on many more decades.  I hope Damian devoted more time to the group.  I hope how soon I can see the second part of the show.",1457827200,4,992,4.308108108108108

7595280,5,B01A7ZI6CQ,"This is one of the best DVD's they have.  Colm has finally come into his own and is more relaxed than he was on Mythology.  Emmett O'Hanlon is an excellent replacement for Paul Byrom.  He handles the upper tenor range very well.  Barry Kerr is gone and I'm so glad.  The new flute player has much more personality and interacts with the band members much better than Barry did.  They have a new guitar player so that Neil doesn't have to go back into the band as much.  The flute player doesn't have to double on guitar anymore.  George is missed of course, but Damian handles the bass parts and has really matured since he was previously in the Celtic Thunder group.  I didn't think songs like ""Galway Girl"" and ""Place in the Choir"" would work without George, bur surprisingly they do.  I'm anxious for Volume 2 to see how they handle ""Seven Drunken Nights"" which I've heard is on that one.  They did away with the orchestra at least for this DVD and I'm glad.  The band is strong enough they they don't really need an orchestra.  My only complaint is that with Phil Coulter gone no one is writing new material for Celtic Thunder and that's a shame.  They can't recycle the old songs forever.",1457481600,10,1193,4.43778801843318

I miss George, but these guys did fantastic and I thought the production and filming were also above perfect.  Get this and sit back with a cuppa and let the music flow over you!",1457049600,,323,4.17741935483871
7595287,2,B01A7ZI6CQ,"Production appears to have been done with little thought or care to having the singers actually paying attention to the camera crew filming or it was just sloppy out of focus editing too.  The wide stage and camera angles with minimal time spent on individual performer shots remind me of folks that quickly tab though a webpage as proof it isn't enjoyable.  Let your audience enjoy an entire segment before changing the angle of the shot. Watched it and filed it on the shelf, disappointed in the producers lack of caring to improve performances.  Save your money folks and enjoy the original tunes rather than yet again another remake of a remake.  Wake up Sharon, put some of the profits back into the productions!. Yes that left a memorable legacy.  This was proof it's time to move on past CT.",1456963200,2,798,4.671428571428572
7595288,3,B01A7ZI6CQ,"Compared to their other DVDs, This one was a disappointment. I didn't like the new versions of some their old songs as well and I thought set was less attractive than many of their past sets. Their instrumental backup was not as good either. Guess they are cost cutting.",1456876800,5,270,4.530612244897959
7595289,4,B01A7ZI6CQ,"I'm giving this four stars and the reason is because much of the material is from previous concerts some over and over again. But that being said there is value and much to be liked with this DVD concert. For starters this is the first recorded concert that actually feels like a real concert. The performers actually talk between many of the songs. In the music that is a rehash of the past, the musical arrangements have been changed and updated as-well-as the vocals. So you are not listening to an exact duplicate of the past. There is some new material but more would be better. It will be interesting to see what will be in the upcoming Volume 2 of this concert. In my opinion these are the most entertaining Irish performers I have ever listened to. Each performer has a distinctive style so the music and songs have variety. The Celtic Thunder band/orchestra is phenomenal. They are as entertaining to watch as the performers. If you have followed this group you will be happy to know Damien returned for this concert. This concert is a little bittersweet because of George's passing and the first concert without him. This group has gone through many changes but their quality remains the same. The new Emmet is carrying on for Paul and the first Emmett very well. String instrumentalists Nicole, Laura and Seana are at the top of their field and an absolute joy to watch. What talent and beauty. The drummer Declan is one of the finest and most entertaining drummers I have seen. He should have a featured spot in each show. His style fascinates me to watch him. Each band member is extremely talented. There is a new guy in the band for this concert, also excellent, as is the guitar player. And of course David, the musical director and keyboard player. Also tops in his field. I can't say enough good things about the beautiful music this group makes. Of course music is a matter of taste and all may not agree. But if you have followed this group and like the music they produce you will not be disappointed. As I stated before a little more new material would be nice but make no mistake, the vocals and arrangements of their previously released music has been updated with a fresh sound. If you are not familiar with this group give Neil, Keith, Ryan, Colm, Damien and Emmet a chance along with that fabulous band. I think you will like them. The performers and the music they perform are definitely a 5 star rating.",1456790400,20,2432,4.567505720823799
7595290,5,B01A7ZI6CQ,"I love this dvd.  Many of the songs are from other recordings, but with a freshness that is just delightful.  Damian, now all grown up, is a joy to listen to, and the newest Celtic Thunder addition, Emmett O'Hanlon, is  a great fit with a beautiful, powerful voice.",1456790400,2,265,4.479166666666667

7595294,4,B01A7ZI6CQ,"Overall, this is another quality CT concert, well one-half of one, and the first on Blu Ray, where everything stands out in crystal clear quality. First, let me state that this is CT's best home release DVD/Blu Ray to date. (Although, George's unfortunate and sad passing does still leave open a hole in my heart and a major void in CT. It's not quite CT without him - even though Keith, Ryan, Neil, Colm, Emmett, Damian and the entire band are exceptional!) Almost everything about this particular concert - the singing, the movement, the arrangements, the interaction that CT has with the crowd, etc. - have far improved since the very first taping. In fact, each concert is better than the one before it. And, that's what you should aim for...always doing better. With all those aforementioned areas, CT has excelled again. However, only one aspect of the show has brought the grade down: post-production, or in layman's terms, the editing.

While it was obvious that the order of the songs on the Blu Ray were not the real order in the concert, the editing process should conceal that from the home audience. Unfortunately, I noticed some bizarre editing mistakes and miscues that I could not overlook in my overall review. The editing is one of the many aspects of bringing live entertainment home. While to most people, the criticisms I have may not be a huge deal or a deal breaker to them (that's fine), but to me, I would not be an honest reviewer without looking at the entire enchilada and let you, the customer, be all the more informed. Before I list the three most critical editing mistakes, I do want to say that these in no way mean you should not buy this concert on disc. It's an exceptional concert; it just needs a little bump in the editing department going forward. That would make this go from exceptional to, well, insert your best adjective there. :)

Both during and in-between songs, especially in situations were the song order live was different than on disc, there were some odd cutaways which disrupted the flow in the most minor of ways. My biggest criticism with the cutaways are the constant and overdone shots of the audience. At times I felt that they were included to hide the fact that the song order was different live vs. at home. I have no issues with any concert cutting away to the crowd, but CT seems to over-rely on this. Another odd editing issue occurred during Damian's song 'Buachaille on Eirne'. For most of the song, Damian had no watch on his left wrist, but a couple of shots showed him with it on. If you need to do a re-take or a re-touch of a live song, as an editor, you have to look out for those smallest of details. Harder to catch but present nonetheless was an odd editing mistake during ""Galway Girl"". Near the end, the CT guys are heard singing, but when the video cuts away to an extremely wide shot - showing the whole stage - the CT guys mouths are not moving. It only happens for a second or two, but I still managed to catch it.

While it appears I am nit-picking, as a reviewer, even an amateur one at that, I have to report on what I observed while watching the concert, especially since CT is charging basically full price for half a concert today. Again, to me, none of the editing oddities are severe enough to discourage a purchase, but you do need to know that they are there. Hopefully, though, you will do as most of the CT fans out there do. Just sit back, relax, and take in what is some exceptional Celtic Irish music sung by arguably the best six Celtic singers out there accompanied by a band that is more and more amazing with each concert that passes.",1456531200,10,3636,4.497730711043873
7595295,4,B01A7ZI6CQ,"I already purchased the CD of this tour but I wanted to actually SEE the performers.  I was not disappointed except for one thing---the audience noise!  I can appreciate the audience's pleasure and enthusiasm BUT I might have gotten this performance from YOUTUBE considering how often the audience drowned out the guys. One number, a drum duel was totally ruined by audience's cheers, clapping and noise.  I really felt like I was watching a football game!  I know audience sounds can be controlled and I am very sorry the DVD producers decided to include it.  I'm also sorry there were so many cut-aways to the audience.  I know they were there---I heard!!! them!  Bottom line, though, I enjoyed seeing how the guys had changed and yet their voices were still lovely. I recommend this DVD to all Celtic Thunder fans!",1456531200,25,817,4.792857142857143
