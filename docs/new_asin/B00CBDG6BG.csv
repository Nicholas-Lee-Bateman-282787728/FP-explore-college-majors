5711221,4,B00CBDG6BG,"Imagine my surprise when out of the blue and without any advance marketing of any kind, this movie showed up on just two screens here in Cincinnati recently. I figured there was no way this would play very long here (and I was right, the movie was gone after one week), so I went to see it right away.

""The Power of Few"" (2013 release; 95 min.) brings the same 20 min. in an early afternoon in New Orleans, but brought from multiple (five, actually) perspectives, and how these intersecting stories play out/touch on each other/collide (literally). Given that you watch the ""same"" 20 minutes five times over the course of the movie, there is no point in even trying to bring an introduction of the movie's plot. Let's just say that blood WILL be spilled at this particular New Orleans intersection.

Several comments: it's amazing what an all-star cast is attached to this movie, starting of course with Christopher Walken as a homeless man with a secret. I don't recall ever having seen Walken so scrungy looking. Then there is Christian Slater as the undercover agent (along with his partner, played by up-and-coming Australian actress Nicky Whelan), trying to recover a mysterious package. We also have rapper Juvenile as one of the gangsters, and Q'orianka Kilcher as the messenger (and also co-producer AND contributing several songs to the very pleasant movie soundtrack). But the key figure is the title character Few (played by newcomer Tione Johnson), a candy-obsessed young lady who isn't feeling so good from eating all that candy while walking home, and who decides to hitch a ride home, unintentionally finding herself at the center of this movie. This is the long-feature debut of writer-director Leone Marucci. As the credits were rolling at the end of the movie, it seemed that a BUNCH of people named Marucci had some involvement on the set or in the production or the financing of this movie, so this was probably a Marucci labor of love long in the making. Bottom line: this movie is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, and definitely worth checking out, whether in the theatre or on DVD.",1365984000,17,2118,4.8319559228650135
5711222,5,B00CBDG6BG,"Our family of daughters and sons-in-law watched this film together. We are all admittedly Walken fans as well as quirky movie fans. We got both with this one. It's a story told from many points of view, going back and forth in time. It doesn't confuse, however. Don't want to go into too much detail because the story is pretty straightforward and its so much fun to discover the surprises.",1400198400,2,390,4.585714285714285
5711223,5,B00CBDG6BG,"This movie is a very deep test of the mind. The ending is both surprising and ""Deep""! I love it..",1383004800,,97,3.9
5711224,3,B00CBDG6BG,"It was interesting to see how our decisions, words and  lives impact others.  I wish q' oranka had a bigger part.",1379203200,,113,4.333333333333333
5711225,2,B00CBDG6BG,"Any movie featuring Christopher Walken is worth checking out. That's what I thought before watching ""The Power of Few,"" a crime drama told with multiple perspectives. I still do not change my mind about Walken's films (and here Walken does what he does best anyway), but ""The Power of Few"" is disappointing enough to almost make me do so.

In fact, top-billed Christopher Walken is only in about one fifth of the movie. ""The Power of Few"" mainly consists of five separate narratives about characters played by, besides Walken, Jordan Prentice, Devon Gearhart, Moon Bloodgood, Christian Slater, Nicky Whelan, Anthony Anderson, Q'orianka Kilcher and Jesse Bradford. Five different narrative threads about people experiencing (or who experienced) violent things - secret operatives looking for something, a delivery girl helping out a young man running away from local gangsters, and so on.

While on TV Larry King (played by himself) discusses a stolen religious artifact, these threads eventually converge towards the end in a not so intriguing fashion. Actually, there is another thread about a little girl who plays an important role in wrapping up the entire storyline. The idea has potential, but with each narrative that is too weak and uninteresting, she arrives a bit too late.

Writer/director Leone Marucci is good at handling the film's crime-related section involving shootings and tortures, but the rest of the film is pretty dull with uninspired dialogue. This is strictly for the avid fans of the stars.",1378512000,,1516,5.230452674897119
5711226,1,B00CBDG6BG,this is one of the dumbest shows i have ever bot waste of money. the movie is a waste of time extremely a bad movie i do not recommend,1377734400,,134,3.6551724137931036
5711227,5,B00CBDG6BG,"The choices we make,will touch more people than we realize. As the title suggests a few can have power,good or bad. This film lets you take a glance at both. It will make you think about your actions,we do have the power of choice.",1376611200,,231,4.2727272727272725
5711228,5,B00CBDG6BG,"I love movies with Christopher Walken in them!  this was a good movie, good acting, 5 more words required, done!",1375142400,,112,4.6
5711229,3,B00CBDG6BG,"""The Power of Few""is an offbeat story in which a crime scene draws five strangers together. Set in gritty New Orleans locations, the film features five parallel sets of characters. Doke (Christopher Walken) is a verbose homeless man obsessed with conspiracy theories who, accompanied by his homeless dwarf companion, spends most of the movie searching for food.

Junkshow (Anthony Anderson) plays a tough thug hunting for a young man who's about to testify against one of his homeboys. Clyde (Christian Slater)  is an undercover agent seeking a mysterious package that could be extremely dangerous. Alexa (Q'orianka Kilcher) is the woman hired to deliver the package in question.

Despite its impressive cast and first-rate performances, the film's director, Leone Marucci, doesn't keep the disparate elements of plot together, resulting in a sometimes rambling narrative frequently burdened with self-conscious, showy touches.

Special features on the DVD release include a making-of featurette, deleted scene, and interviews with actors Christian Slater, Christopher Walken, and Anthony Anderson.",1374364800,2,1098,5.7592592592592595
5711230,1,B00CBDG6BG,"Had a lot of potential, but very graphic (violent) and not much dialogue. Watched half and wish I could get the other half of my money back!",1373760000,,140,4.222222222222222
5711231,5,B00CBDG6BG,"Sure, I'll watch practically anything with Christopher Walken starring, but Christian Slater and the rest of the cast are fascinating, too! It's more than interesting to see how the day progresses from a variety of people's points of view. I would recommend this flick for anyone 18 and over!",1372204800,2,292,4.979591836734694
5711232,3,B00CBDG6BG,"""Have you ever bit the inside of your cheek?"" A stolen religious artifact, a baby who needs medicine, a delivery driver who meets a man on the run from a gang, two agents looking for someone and two homeless men all become connected in one tragic event. This is the kind of movie where a series of events connect groups of people that otherwise have nothing in common. This one event is shown from everyone's point of view and how one person can change everything. I love movies like this. Movies that show the same event from many different perspectives. No movie has done it better then Rashomon but there have been many attempts since then. Most recently movies like Crash, 11:14 and Vantage Point have all used this style of filmmaking. I have enjoyed all those movies and I enjoyed this one as well. The only problem I had with this one is that some of the stories went on a little long and started to slow the movie down, but overall the movie was enjoyable and really keeps you watching and sucked in. Overall, a fun movie done in a type of style that I really love, which may skew my opinion but I think it's very much worth watching. I give it a B.",1372118400,3,1157,4.336405529953917
5711233,1,B00CBDG6BG,"Would not recommend to anyone! No plot, just a jumble of something that couldn't be figured out.
I only had to watch the first 30 minutes before I knew it was a bomb.",1370390400,,166,4.0606060606060606
5711234,4,B00CBDG6BG,"I enjoyed watching this movie.  It was great fun, and not your normal, predictable garbage film that is so pervasive.  I really like Christopher Walken he is a riot.  He does a great job with his character, and delivers a funny performance that is full of dry humor.",1369958400,4,266,4.5
5711235,2,B00CBDG6BG,"this was a shock.  again... I'll always watch Walken.

The rest of the acting and overall productions simply wasn't done well IMO.

I actually tried to see it at a theater.  There was a note on the movie theater door.  ""Sorry for your inconvenience but ""The Power of a Few"" will not be showing at this theater.  I thought, ""Wow this has to be rad"".  It sadly wasn't.

Oh well....",1369440000,,379,4.314285714285714
5711236,4,B00CBDG6BG,"All round decent film, not very good acting all round but averagely enjoyable all the same. I real only watched it for Christopher Walken who ends up playing a minor role, disappointing.",1369180800,2,186,4.84375
5711237,1,B00CBDG6BG,"This was not a movie, the same scene just played over and over from different camera perspective over and over and delivered a very weak message like unto the Butterfly Effect. Save 95 minutes of your life and your money and skip this.",1368748800,3,235,4.488372093023256
5711238,5,B00CBDG6BG,Inventive storytelling with originality all over it.  As soon as it ended I started it again. Surprisingly emotional for me.,1368748800,,124,5.2
5711239,2,B00CBDG6BG,The movie was very slow to develop and the whole plot could have been revealed and finished in less than 2 minutes.  Instead it dragged on for an hour and a half with no real direction.  I really expected a much better movie.,1368662400,2,225,4.209302325581396
5711240,1,B00CBDG6BG,"What a junk movie! Slow and without any point. I like CW, but this was just a terrible movie. What a wasted time.",1368316800,2,113,3.9565217391304346
5711241,5,B00CBDG6BG,"You should buy this movie. This is a great perspective of the lives of people in New Orleans swirling around a twenty minute period.

It has action, great dialogue and of course, Christopher Walken.

How can you go wrong?",1367193600,5,221,4.641025641025641
8579716,4,B00CBDG6BG,really good once you get into it.  great performances by q'orianka kilcher and jesse Bradford whos performances kept me interested...that is after the startling intro to the film.  Christopher walken was Christopher walken.  I guess it's the voice. you can make him up in outrageous costumes and you just know it is him the first time he mutters a word.  this is five different stories colliding then changing outcomes of lives.  it was a good  and unexpectedly enjoyable film.  applause.,1526774400,,488,5.025

8579724,1,B00CBDG6BG,"I really wanted to like this movie. After all, it had the inestimable Christopher Walken in it, on top of a variety of other good and interesting actors. In general, I like most so-called ""Independent"" movies, movies a bit off kilter from the mainstream. Unfortunately, within that grouping lie movies that are often off kilter just for the sake of being off kilter. The movie consists of the exact same 20 minutes of time viewed from 5 different perspectives and I assume to show how one small change can exert large differences in outcomes, a take on the old philosophical adage that a butterfly flapping its wings can begin a Hurricane. I can see the same sort of ""Oh, wow"" factor here if the same 60's college students smoking the same products were flexing their pseudo intellectual muscles, so to speak. The violence didn't bother me, though is was graphic. It just seemed to be a bit of a mess that got away from whatever it was supposed to be. If you see it on a cable station for free, and you have a bit of time to kill, go ahead, watch it. I wouldn't pay to see it though, even at the cheaper prices offered for streaming. Walken was watchable though, as always. That much I'll give him and the movie.",1405209600,,1212,4.463963963963964
8579725,1,B00CBDG6BG,way too much cursing and violence. I got the movie because I love love love Christopher Walkin. but it just did not hold my attention.,1403568000,,134,4.4
