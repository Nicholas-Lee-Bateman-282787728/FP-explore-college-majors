1993704,5,B0001EFV7M,"This is one of the coolest sequels
I have ever seen. It's darker and scarier
then the original and it has some great
laughs. Plus there are some cameos of Katharine Isabelle. The sequel is really different from the
first one. There is a surprise at the
ending and with and ending like that I hope
they make another sequel after (Ginger Snaps Back).
I don't know about the american dvd but the Special Features on the canadian dvd will include a commentary  with director
Brett Sullivan, deleted scenes, storyboards, behind-the-scenes footage, and a make-up FX featurette (KNB FX).I wanted to
say that horror fans should see this cool flick and if
you visit Canada this month you should see it in the cinema.",1075507200,,707,4.701612903225806

1993736,4,B0001EFV7M,"This is not nearly as good as the first film.  Katharine Isabelle is sorely missed, used here infrequently as a needling apparition bringing up things Brigitte (Emily Perkins) would just as soon not deal with.  At this point Brigitte is hooked on monkshood extract.  She finds that it is not a cure, as hoped, just a means of keeping the eventual change at bay.  Through no fault of her own, Brigitte abruptly finds herself incarcerated in a strange rehab clinic.  Throughout her stay, Brigitte is haunted by a weird-weird-super-weird girl named Ghost (Tatiana Maslany).  This pest follows her incessantly, yammering bizarre observations best kept to herself.  Why is she there?  How was her grandmother Barbara set afire?  Who is Tyler (Eric Johnson) and how did he ever get hired at a rehab clinic where he trades drugs for sex!!!  Bodies everywhere but no sign of the police.  This is an unhinged fairy tale.

The greatest obstacle that cant be overcome is that every single character is unlikable and obvious.  Emily Perkins attempt to carry the film alone doesnt entirely succeed.  Dont know why they bothered calling it Ginger Snaps II when Ginger is dead and snapping at no one at this point.

Still, there are remnants enough of the first film to make this one watchable.  I liked enough of it to keep it in my collection along with the much better original film.",1477526400,,1371,4.794871794871795

1993744,3,B0001EFV7M,"Ginger Snaps was a good movie, but its sequel doesn't deliver. As so often happens, the sequel is just an attempt to cash in on the success of the original film and does not make a good continuation. Ginger Snaps 2 is pretty much just an average horror film, merging the werewolf genre into the psychiatric hospital genre like they couldn't figure out how to make it stand on its own as a werewolf film with what the first film leaves us with. This was probably because Ginger Snaps was a complete film that didn't need a sequel.

The first film has very specific themes about sisterhood, Goths admiring death, the struggles of growing up, and feminist commentary. The second film remembers them fondly but doesn't really do anything substantial with them or even with themes of its own, instead meandering between Brigitte remembering her relationship with Ginger, Brigitte trying to make friends, and Brigitte dealing with intimidating love interests with no clear point or message. The only thing coming close to a theme is the conflation of sex and violence, which has been with werewolf and vampire stories for ages, and it doesn't do anything interesting with it. Finally, the end twist is unsatisfactory because it doesn't respect the protagonist and has little to no build up.

This film leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. The first film is one of my favorite horror films, and this film degrades the characters and setting into an average horror film. Ginger is reduced to an evil mocking voice stereotype. Brigitte doesn't really go anywhere and is ultimately disrespected by the ending. Love interests we're supposed to like are written as creepy in regressive portrayals of gender dynamics that stand in stark contrast to the feminist themes of the original. Surprise villains aren't thought out, and the twists show up more or less because someone thought the movie should have twists regardless of their suitability in the plot. It's a disrespect to the legacy of the first film.",1437350400,4,1998,4.890855457227139

The ending had a wicked twist that truly made the whole film that much darker. A great movie, especially as a one-time watch, just not something I would tell every werewolf enthusiast to watch.

1993807,5,B0001EFV7M,"It's The Living Dead Girl here, 1st off let me say I like the Werewolf drug withdrawal concept. I've never really had a problem with that anyway; I think it's interesting I mean it can bring Puppet Master Pupppets back, It can be The Vampire version of Orpheus on Buffy or Angel (loved how Faith used it So Angelus wouldn't turn her) or when Willow was addicted to magic (I unlike a lot of Buffy fans I heard about find that interesting. Also Bridgette is a wolf from the 1st movie; because of that Promise she did with Ginger....where they both cut the palms of their hands and exchanged it, This I do with my husband and my friends(only without cutting our palms, it's also like the Rock on! Handshake from Lost Boys....and it would be way cool if we could be werewolves 2. NOW; the Mental institution where Bridgette gets sent to and meets Ghost, this is like Buffy in Normal Again, along with Ginger coming back like The 1st Evil does...and tells her to quit shooting the drug that keeps everything under control, till it starts to turn into a poison kinda like Spikes chip (I really don't care for Riley although I like the season 5 Buffy episode that's like this. And Ghost is one of my favorite characters, 2 me she'd be like a younger version of Dakota Fanning in Twilight and not just because they look alike their personalities are real similar. I mean she's crazy and even though they said she was making great progress she wasn't and ended keeping Bridgette so she could take down all of Ghosts enemies. Now me and my husband and my friends liked that and are actually surprised that people found it so dark.",1379289600,,1620,4.476351351351352
1993808,5,B0001EFV7M,I saw this movie on the SYFY channel.  I thought it was a great movie about werwolves and it always had a story about sister that loved eachother.  I have always love movies about werwolves.,1367798400,,190,4.4
1993809,4,B0001EFV7M,"Remember in Ginger Snaps when Brigitte cuts her hand to ""share"" Ginger's fate?

Since the death of her sister Ginger (Katharine Isabelle), Brigitte (Emily Perkins) has been suppressing her lycanthropy with wolf's bane injections like a drug addict while resisting Ginger's taunts haunting her psyche.  However, she's developing a resistance to her herbal remedy and she's dosing increasingly more often.  Then, at about the most inconvenient time, Brigitte is placed in a mental hospital suspected of drug addiction by the tracks on her arm.

During group therapy we find some humor as we hear Brigitte's melodramatic self-prognosis and meet her new catty roommates.  But we'll find far less humor overall in this sequel than the original. Overhearing some hospital staff discussing Brigitte's strange addiction to wolf's bane, a young girl nicknamed Ghost with a werewolf comic book and a while imagination begins to suspect Brigitte's secret.

Without her wolf's bane, Brigitte begins to heal more rapidly and slowly transform.  But more of a problem than keeping up with her wolf's bane dosage is another, fully transformed werewolf seeking out Brigitte.  Supporting Brigitte through all of this--werewolves and wolf's bane and mental hospital escapes--Ghost becomes much like a little sister.

This is a reasonable sequel that continues Brigitte's story with a very different angle from part one--and none of the puberty/womanhood metaphor.  It's not nearly as good as the original, but it's a worthy, entertaining sequel.  The effects haven't really graduated from the low budget of part one, maybe even a step back, but the gore is still effective.

The werewolf looks more different than ""better"" compared to part one. However, Brigitte's transformation is far less interesting and punctuated than Ginger's was.  At one point Brigitte looks more like a D-movie ghoul or zombie than someone on her way to wolfdom. That make up was done poorly and represents the most major fault of the movie.  There is also no actual transformation scene--which, itself, is another fault of the movie.  But it does play well with the ending.

Perhaps the most interesting part of the movie was Ghost's character development.  She has her own dark secret and it becomes rather important in the third act and ending of the story.

If you enjoyed Ginger Snaps then I'd say watch this.  It's not nearly as good but it's certainly not at all bad.",1365897600,,2431,5.171355498721228

1993818,5,B0001EFV7M,"It's hard to review this sequel without spoiling the plot of the first of the series. What we have is a werewolf trying to avoid the transformation, thrown into a skeezie mental hospital, and adored by a really creepy young girl. Everything is better by comparison: widescreen presentation with a 5.1 audiotrack, production commentary, storyboards and comic art (this later one will make more sense upon viewing the film). The acting is a dramatic increase as well: it's like the difference between Terminator and Terminator 2... only Canadian, with werewolves.

If you've seen the original, you need to see this - it is easily twice as good a production. If you are a genre fan and haven't seen either films, do so with expedience.

I also think she's more beautiful than Katherine Isabelle even though their both hot. This movie steps away from you're typical werewolf horror flick in that it's dark, witty, and at times sexual.

1993823,3,B0001EFV7M,"Disregard what you've heard about the first movie - whether or not someone presents it as a masterpiece or the superior original of the franchise, it isn't necessary to watch it first before this movie. I should know, I came in at Ginger Snaps 2 - Unleashed. So I'm not going to rant and rave about how this is such a different movie apart from the original in an attempt to justify certain discrepancies - it has its own cult following to do that for me.

What I will tell you is that the movie stars Emily Perkins as Brigitte and only features the title character as a part of Brigitte's mind. This is not a complaint, as many fans will be quick to point out that Emily Perkins has rightfully earned her spotlight, as demonstrated here. Although initially, she comes across as stoic or paranoid, the actress brings up nearly every expression from the emotional spectrum in this movie. I'm pretty positive, in fact, that she is the only convincing actress in this despairing continuation of ""Ginger Snaps"" - and as she is a fairly obscure actress, those who enjoy her role here will become instant fans. Those who do not, will probably turn the movie off not far into it.

I'm of the variety who really got into Emily Perkins with this one. So enough talk about the star, here's what you need to know about the story. Brigitte is cursed (or rather, infected) with lycanthropy, and has gone into lonely seclusion while obsessing over beating it with increasingly higher doses of monkshood. Although it has slowed her transformation, her body has developed a resistance to it. Add to the equation that she is set upon by another werewolf (who she believes, wants to mate with her), and you have a pretty desperate if not despairing Brigitte. After escaping an encounter with said werewolf while overdosing on monkshood, Brigitte is taken (against her will) to a rehab center - removed from her monkshood.

If ""Unleashed"" didn't ride so heavily on Emily Perkins' shoulders, it might have been much more successful. Instead, we are left with supporting actors being stupid. Ghost, a manipulative girl also trapped in rehab, is only an annoying pest that Brigitte (and the audience) is stuck with. Tyler, the opportunistic perverted nurse in the rehab center, is drawn to Brigitte only because she resists his ""charms"". And then there's Alice, the head of the rehab facility, whose role is to not believe anything Brigitte says.

If you do plan on buying it (honestly, if you're on the fence about it, I would just rent it), you're going to have to go into it with very little expectations. Emily Perkins has earned the Ginger Snaps movies quite the cult-following, but their overzealous rave reviews threaten to doom this sequel.",1286409600,,2726,4.7568710359408035

Emily Perkins can do no wrong and I wish that she were in more movies.  She is way underrated as an actress. GS2 is far more serious than the first one in a good way. I considered it a werewolf movie for adults.  It was well written, clever and kept my attention the whole way through up to the unexpected end.

1993829,3,B0001EFV7M,"First off monkshood is no longer cure for lycanthropy it just slows down the transformation process, so Brigitte who was left infected at the end of the first movie needs to inject it daily while she searches for a real cure. Pretty early on the movie sets up that there's a male werewolf after Brigitte and that its presence somehow speeds up her transformation, but after the initial encounter it's basically forgotten until much later on in the film. Ginger appears randomly throughout the movie to Brigitte as a hallucination, but for the most part her appearances are so rare and meaningless that they never add anything to the movie. During most of the film Tatiana Maslany is crammed down the viewers' throats in an attempt to build a relationship between Ghost and Brigitte and establish Ghost as a strange but innocent girl, but bad editing (like panning over the same ""subtle hint"" twice because the director thought it went by too quickly the first pass, but not editing it out) and over acting make it way too obvious that she's anything but innocent. The movie tries to cram a lot of action into the final third, and although Unleashed is enjoyable, it's just too late to save it. Ginger Snaps 2 is decent, even with all of its flaws and if you're a fan of Ginger Snaps it's definitely worth viewing at least once.",1241827200,4,1327,4.651063829787234

My wife loves the schlock and was glued to the tv for the prequel, then this morsel of goodness.  Perhaps if we had seen Ginger Snaps, we'd have felt differently, but we really couldn't believe what we were seeing!  The production values and acting were, well, hideous.  Isn't there ever any daylight in Canada, eh?  The plot, and especially the ending, were bizarre.  Lots of laughing involved with watching this.  Sadly, I was carbed out on the afore-mentioned baked goods, so I was unable to properly self medicate with beer, 6 or so of which would have been required to totally enjoy (sit through) this movie.

1993831,3,B0001EFV7M,"There are moments when you forget that this is a werewolf movie...and that's not necessarily a bad thing.

The characters have more substance to them than you usually find in horror movies.  The writing keeps the story interesting, right up to the offbeat ending.

Drawbacks?  A little more atmosphere when the wolves show up would've made the special effects more effective.  And the pretty girl from the first movie is reduced to dream-like cameos.

1993841,4,B0001EFV7M,"This is the sequel to the cult favorite Ginger Snaps, and picks up the story with Brigitte (Emily Perkins), living in a seedy motel, after killing her werewolf sister and the destruction her family.  Now Wolf's Bane injections are all that are keeping her from her own transformation and another werewolf that is biding its time until it can mate haunts her.  A sudden confrontation throws Brigitte out on the street right after an injection and she is taken for an addict and placed in an eerie clinic that has more than an accidental resemblance to One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.

Trapped without the Wolf's Bane, the change draws ever nearer.  Her only source is a guard (Eric Johnson) who trades the inmates drugs for sex.  And her only friend is Ghost a young girl (Tatiana Maslany) of dubious sanity.  When Ghost manages to help Brigitte escape the level of horror rapidly escalates as Brigitte must deal with humans who are every bit as depraved as the creature that is hunting her.

Ginger Snaps: Released lacks the twisted humor of the original film.  Instead, it presents a bleak and edgy vision that never relents.  Brigitte struggles to remain human in a world where being human doesn't amount to much.  In many ways, the werewolf is saner than its victims, living true to its nature instead of making any pretensions at normalcy.  This is a scary film because the viewer never really knows who is the monster and who is the victim.

Brett Sullivan replicates the film style of the original, only even darker.  Odd angles and scene setting that is deliberately amateurish.  There's no attempt at glitz here.  The wolves are ugly, malformed creatures, and even the characters have a gritty surface.  The film lacks the power of Ginger Snaps, with its sudden about face from sarcastic comedy to tragic horror, but it is still a striking effort at reinventing the horror genre as something genuinely horrible.

1993846,4,B0001EFV7M,"I really enjoyed Ginger Snaps, so I was relieved to discover that I had enough foresight to put Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed on my Netflix list.  It arrived a week later.

Unleashed picks up some time after the original movie.  Poor Brigitte (Emily Perkins) continues to struggle with her impending lycanthropy by injecting monkshood intravenously. But a mate-seeking male werewolf is stalking her.  Yick.

Alone and desperate, it doesn't take long for an incident to land Brigitte in a halfway house for drug addicts that also happens to be a medical facility for chronic care.  The movie shifts into Terminator 2 territory, as Brigitte struggles with her internal demons in a really awful-looking medical facility.  Making matters worse, Brigitte is sporadically haunted by the ghost of her older sister Ginger (Katharine Isabelle), shades of American Werewolf in London.

Brigitte befriends a young girl named Ghost (Tatiana Maslany), and the two hatch a plan to escape the facility before the werewolf catches up with them.  Ghost stays at the facility to take care of her grandmother, who was burned head to toe.  All throughout the film, poor grandma-wrapped up like a mummy-keeps trying to reach for the alarm (or is that the pain medication?).

It should come as no surprise that the male staff takes advantage of the junkies, and the Happy Care facility (or whatever it's called) is no different.  Tyler (Eric Johnson) trades drugs for sex with the girls.  He also has a peculiar big brother-ish relationship with Ghost.

The acting is excellent, with Perkins smoldering rage and brooding angst to the role.  The concept of Ginger's spirit haunting Brigitte is interesting but completely wasted.  When Ginger isn't taunting her sister, she simply isn't around at all. At one point, Ginger mentions that she's feeling neglected by Brigitte who seems to have new friends.  Tell it to the director!

Unleashed is the rare horror movie that is content to show reactions to horror instead of the actual horror itself. It goes a long way in making the werewolf seem much more horrible than it is.  And of course, the terrified faces of the mauled victims speak volumes.

The movie continues long after the girls escape the facility, which was probably the first mistake.  The climax feels a bit forced and the ending, while interesting, really doesn't provide any sense of closure.

Unleashed is a serviceable sequel, but it feels like the middle entry in a longer story arc.  With this entry, the Ginger Snaps series begins to have an episodic feel to it, more appropriate for a television show than a movie series, and that's not a good thing.",1125187200,2,2645,4.961363636363636
1993847,3,B0001EFV7M,"I really liked the first Ginger Snaps movie. It came as a bit of a surprise: a good teen oriented werewolf movie. The last good werewolf movies I had seen were ""An American Werewolf in London"" and ""Wolfen"". ""Ginger Snaps"" did a good job of introducing the characters of Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) and her sister, Brigitte (Emily Perkins), two Goth teens with a death fascination kick. Even though it had a Buffy The Vampire Slayer vibe to it, it worked without trying to imitate that series.

""Ginger Snaps 2"" picks up around where the first left off. Ginger is dead, while Brigitte is being pursued by a werewolf looking to mate. After a trying to escape from the creature, Brigitte is knocked unconscious and taken to a drug rehab center for girls. Here she is held against her will and deprived of the monkshood (wolfs bane) she had been injecting to delay her transformation.

The majority of the film takes place in the clinic. Brigitte deals with the other patients, the staff, and eventually with the lusty werewolf that's been pursuing her. She reluctantly befriends a little girl nicknamed Ghost who helps her escape from the clinic to a house in the woods.

I don't want to include any spoilers, but I found the ending to this movie to be a huge letdown. Up to that point, the movie moved along at a slow pace, but was still fairly enjoyable. But the way it ended...not good.

Emily Perkins, who's quite a good actress, reprises her role as Brigitte. I haven't seen her in anything else but the ""It"" TV mini-series, but she's the one who holds this whole production together. Katherine Isabelle reprises her role as the deceased Ginger, making a few brief cameo appearances in Brigitte's visions.

I'd actually rank this one with two and a half stars. I actually preferred the third in the series: the prequel - ""Ginger Snaps Back"". Higher production values and a little bit more of a storyline place it a little bit ahead of part two.",1120608000,,1946,4.661807580174927

This movie went in a direction that I wasn't expecting. Rather than just doing a retread of the first story, the filmmakers chose to follow Ginger's sister Brigitte into a mental institution after the events of the first movie. It becomes more of a psychological thriller, and focuses on whether or not Brigitte is really going to turn into a werewolf or if she might just be going crazy.

Granted, that may be what a lot of people don't like about it, but I ended up really enjoying the movie. It was done with a decent amount of style and the concept was eerie enough to keep me watching. As far as sequels go, not a bad one.",1119571200,,842,4.25625

  After seeing all three films, my biggest question is when will there be Ginger Snaps: The Series. Surely Lions Gate and the CBC could get together to make a great series from this material. It is not a Buffy rewrite. This is the way a werewolf should play. If not Ginger Snaps: The Series, when is Ginger Snaps 4 coming out??",1119484800,,710,4.3816793893129775

I liked Ginger Snaps 2. But not quite as much as the first. This one lacked the dark humorous bits of Ginger Snaps and of course it lacked GINGER. Part of what made the first film special was the relationship between the two sisters. This was distinctly lacking in this film. I also didn't care for Ginger's excessive self mutilation.

1993853,3,B0001EFV7M,"Since the other reviews have summed up the plot and various other sundry items about GINGER SNAPS 2, my comments are based on how this sequel made me feel about the whole Brigitte/Ginger story.  First of all, Emily Perkins is excellent in the role of Brigitte, eschewing any real physical attractiveness in favor of angst and desperation.  However, if you look at Brigitte, what is there to like about her?  She is the one who decided to inject her sister's blood in order to help Ginger, which horrendously backfired.  And now she's addicted to wolfsbane, and is one of the most depressing characters in horror history.  As the sexually deviant Tyler notes, she never smiles..she doesn't know how to smile.  Granted, what is there to smile about?  But that's the problem with Brigitte....she's made her bed and she doesn't realize the hopelessness of her situation, but instead of acquiring heroic tactics to improve her fate, she continues to whine, and alienate anyone who might be able to help her.  Perkins performance is a case of excellent acting skills but a character who is just not likeable.  Tatiana Maslany as Ghost is amazingly good, but her character is even more depraved in a non-lycanthropic way, than Brigitte.  Her wide-eyed naievete hides a deep psychological malfunction, and once we find out what she really is, well put Ghost in the nuthouse for sure.  Janet Kidder, the niece of Superman's Margot Kidder, is effective in some ways as Alice, but she comes across so all-knowing and ""butch"" that her presence does little to move the film.  Eric Johnson as Tyler is one of the most complex characters in the film.  Behind those charming nice boy looks lies a deviant who uses his own sexual gratification to seduce and supply the girls with their own addiction.  And yet by the time he comes to the rescue in the final scenes, his heroic demeanor is surprising and his fate, though probably justified, seems sadistic and cruel, particularly considering Ghost's involvement in his demise.  The werewolf effects are lame, but since it doesn't appear too often, one can understand the low budget film's necessity to swathe the creature in subdued lighting.

I was impressed with the original GINGER SNAPS because of its fresh approach to a timeworn genre.  But in this sequel, and even in the ""prequel"", the originality is negated by the darkness of its main characters, and the loss of hope is only heightened by Brigitte's bleak demeanor.  As horror films go, this sequel is okay, but hopefully we won't have Ginger or Brigitte snapping at us again.",1113955200,,2570,4.882488479262673
1993854,1,B0001EFV7M,"I'm reading with curiousity the glowing reviews of this so called film and I can't help but wonder if the people in here and I watched the same movie.  There must be a mistake, there HAS to be with people giving this  crap glowing reviews and 4 or 5 stars.

Ofcourse the more spiteful among you are going to click on the ""I did not find this review helpful"" out of spite cause my review is in stark contrast to the things you said about this movie.  Can't anyone have a differing point of view?  It's not so much that those who liked this react neagatively cause I or whoever else did not like it, it's all about looking at the opinions and views objectively and fairly without any spiteful backlast.

To those of you who have not seen this movie, look at what I'm writing down to clue you in. And I don't really care what I give away and spoil for anybody.  TRUST ME, I'm trying to SAVE you from this pathetic atempt at a sequel. Ginger Snaps 2 Unleashed is the title of this movie and I bet i'm not the only one that thought they should have put  it back on a leash and chained it up somewhere.

First off the beginning of Ginger Snaps Unleashed picks up with Bridget (B) in a cheap motel room shooting herself up with monkshood to try in vain to control her shall we shall lycanthropic tendencies.

First thing you'll notice right off the bat is that Bridget, miracle of miracles has actually adopted grooming practices, even makeup (gasp!) this time around compared to how you remember her in Ginger Snaps. Indeed Emily Perkins who portrays Bridget looked more like wild than Ginger ever did in the first movie. She looks like halfway babe material and much more decent in this film.  NICE!! What's the reason for the radical change? A date perhaps?

Anyway when last we saw Bridgett,she was embracing her dead werewolf sister Ginger. It's not explained in this movie what happened to her mom, or what happened to Ginger for that matter. Did the cops find the Ginger's werewolf body?  Since Ginger killed more than a few people with Bridget present, you would think law enforcement would be looking for her. What did the mom do and what happened to the father?

What happened between then and Bridget being in a seedy motel room.  Did she run away? Is she on the lam?  Where did the kid get the money to rent rooms, buy syringes, food, supplies, travel and move about?

On to other things, she od's by injecting too much of the monkshood, where some poor guy finds her, tries to help and winds up getting ripped apart by another werewolf, who realizes that Bridget looks way better in this movie, oh and that she's a latent werewolf in the making and follows her around in a effort to catch up to her and mate. It's that call of the wild thing that's so popular with the kids nowadays.

Then she finally faints and winds up in a rehab center run by someone called Alice, which I thought was hysterial cause she had a ""Def Leppard"" tatoo on her arm.  That must be the Candian version of a rebel.  Well things are not looking up for poor Bridget.

She's trapped in a rehab center cause they think she's some sort of druggie, and there's this depraved child called Ghost, who if you watch this movie and are honest about it, you would sincerely believe is more dangerous than any werewolf. She's there with her grandmother who's all burned up. But you'll learn more about that as the movie goes on,unfortunately.

Seriously that kid Ghost is one super messed up child, remember the scene with her dog's head wrapped in a blanket and the wise ass remark she told Bridget regarding it?  Normal kids don't do stuff like that. It's funny no one who reviewed this movie here bothers to mention any of this.  They make her out to be Bridgets only friend and ally and soon you'll discover, like the old saying goes, ""with friends like these""

And ofcourse for good measure you have the obligatory sexually perverted guard. Hey gotta have it!  There was one in Terminator 2 Judgement Day, I guess the producers wanted one of thier own. No horror movie based in a rehab center is complete without it you know.

It should be mentioned in passing that Katherine Isabelle (Ginger) does appear in this movie as a REAL Ghost from time to time.  She appears only to Bridget, but i'm kinda wondering why even include Ginger or waste Ms. Isabelles talents in the God awful flick.

She appears only to taunt and annoy the hell out of Bridget who seems actually suprislingly good natured about it. With Bridget releasing her sister from her torment in the last film and then actually grieving for her sister and  lovingly embraced putting her arms over her dead sisters ugly werewolf body you'd think the sister's ghost would actually have some sympathy and compassion for her troubled sister this time around. You'd think she come back as a loving nuturing spirit, concerned for her sisters welfare.  Un Uh! Not so. All she does here is remind B. and make light of her eventual descent into damnation. With ghosts like these sister or not?  Was there a need?

Well finally Bridget and the kid manage to escape the rehab center where they are continoulsy hounded by the werewolf looking to get it together with Bridget.

By the way I never went into detail about the werewolf did I?  Well hey! this one actually has hair! compared to the hairless one's in Ginger Snaps. Remember Lions Gate Films produced this movie, compared to City Heat Productions in the first one.  Bigger movie company, bigger budget!! What does that translate to? HAIR! for the werewolf. Lionsgate was going first class all the way.

They make their way to Ghost's grandma's house where Bridget eventually starts to lose control of her transformation, monkshood or not, then they call the perverted guard to come and help and he in turn calls on the Alice chick to come and get them. Mistakenly believing that the guard tried to molest Ghost, thanks to some good acting on her part, Bridget sets him up to get killed by the werewolf who followed them by locking him outside.

Turns out Ghost is a drama queen, cause she lied, she also lied about the way her so called grandma died. Lets just say granny's accident in where she was burned all over was no accident. Ever hear of the bad seed?  Bridget finds this out and is really pissed for being taken for a fool.

The rehab lady shows up and the werewolf bursts in the house at last, where Bridget has her final confrontation with it, and wins more or less, not without getting messed up a little ofcourse in the process.

Bridget and the werewolf wind up in the basement (how apt) where that little pshyco Ghost, kills Alice (The lady rehab center director) and poor Bridget implores the kid to kill her cause she's on the verge of fully transforming, but Ghost has other plans and locks Bridget up in the cellar for a rainy day so she can use her to deal with her many enemies real and imagined. Talk about compassion I tell ya.  That's how the movie ends, and it couldn't have been more depressing if they tried.

THIS MOVIE WAS NO FUN AT ALL! Bad acting! Bad script! Bad lines! BAD EVERYTHING!.  I'm not putting Ms. Perkins down or anything, after all she did a tremedous job in Ginger Snaps, but if you haven't seen this movie yet, it has none of the charm and wit, sytle, feel, spirit and just plain fun that the first one had.

Trust me this is NOTHING like Ginger Snaps. At least Ginger Snaps even though it wasn't the greatest thing to ever come out was creative and innovative for a movie of it's kind dealing with a theme that's been used to death.  And that's saying something nice about it that it managed that where so many other's fail.  Ginger Snaps is a academy award winner compared to this one, thats for damn sure.  The only reason I was excited to watch Ginger Snaps Unleashed was based on how much I liked the first one.  BIG MISTAKE!!

Something tells me Ginger Snaps is the kind of movie that should have only been a one shot deal and that's it. Leave it for prosperity. I know they made a 3rd one but based on the strength of the second one, I sure aint looking forward to that. I don't know if the 3rd time is really the charm aND I should take a chance or spare myself. If you're a hearty soul and like to abuse yourself then you might care for this movie.  Ginger Snaps UNLEASHED (HA! who are they kidding?) indeed.  Whatever it's your money.  Can't say nobody warned ya.  Peace",1111708800,10,8412,4.463398692810458
1993855,4,B0001EFV7M,"I loved the original Ginger Snaps--it was a neat spin on the classic werewolf genre.  The sequel, Unleashed, freed as it is from the conventional werewolf story, almost becomes a better film than the original.

Rather than rehash the werewolf story of the first, this movie spins the werewolf curse with a new metaphor: drug addiction.  Addicts sometimes say that addiction is like a monster inside of them.  With Bridget (Emily Perkins), the monster inside of her is real, and she's ""shooting up"" with wolfsbane everyday to keep human.  So what happens when she's found in the street and put into rehab?  Well, for starters, they take her drugs away ...

The film has a great character in Ghost, a little girl with severe issues, and a great ending.  The ending was NOT what I expected it to be, but it was definitely fitting.",1111190400,2,827,4.694444444444445
1993856,3,B0001EFV7M,"""Ginger Snaps"" was that rare thing, a very low-budget sleeper hit that garnered acclaim from all who saw it. Except me, I thought it was full of crappy angst, lousy acting and truly staid dialogue, but that's just me.

""Ginger Snaps 2 - Unleashed"" completely reworks the original movie and, thanks to some truly tense set-pieces and a fantastic bit of character acting by a talented young actress named Tatiana Maslany, wipes the floor with its oftentimes amateurish predecessor in terms of professionalism, competency, and more importantly, scares.

Brigitte is now committed to an asylum, her erstwhile doctors believing her to be addicted to the poisonous Monkshood serum. She is befriended by a younger girl called Ghost (Maslany), ostensibly there to care for her ill grandmother, who accepts Brigitte's story, helping her to escape the asylum. Cue werewolf, much gore and lots and lots of shock moments....

The first and most noticable thing about ""Ginger Snaps 2 - Unleashed"" is the overall sense of Improvement, and this runs across the board. Performances are more professional and polished - as I've mentioned, Maslany is excellent as the oddball child, but Emily Perkins (Brigitte) has matured into a far better actress in this movie, delivering her dialogue with more conviction and playing the part of Dark Secret Harbourer with a greater degree of control. She's no longer whiney and angsty, but genuinely fearful of what she may have become. Direction is similarly improved, camerawork is now more structured and there's less of a sense of ""Hold the damn camera still, I can't see what's happening!!"" than in the first movie. The storyline is less predictable (the ending is particularly fantastic!) and the whole thing moves with a polish and a style wholly superior to the first.

All's not well, however - the cheapo special 'effects' are still there in abundance, with mawkish pseudo-werewolf shots and desperately unbelievable makeup effects spoiling an otherwise faultless atmosphere. But that's no big deal when you consider the Director (Sullivan) has kept the creature quotient in this movie right down, instead relying on some beautifully-executed chase and evasion sequences to create the horror.

All in all, a huge success, and a far better movie, ""Ginger Snaps 2 - Unleashed"" is a worthwhile recommendation to all horror fans. A shame that you'd really have to watch the first to appreciate this one fully, but there it is.

1993857,4,B0001EFV7M,"Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed (Brett Sullivan, 2004)

Brett Sullivan returns with his tale of two sisters, one a werewolf, the other struggling not to become one. (Folks who've seen the first one will likely wonder how this can be. Folks who haven't... why haven't you seen it yet? Rent it now. And stop reading this review, as it contains THE big spoiler for the first film.)

Brigitte (Emily Perkins [It, Insomnia]) has fled her hometown following the death of her sister Ginger, and is living in a motel with only her monkshood and the local library for company. She, however, is both being tracked by another werewolf and haunted by Ginger's ghost (Katharine Isabelle [Freddy vs. Jason, Insomnia]). When both pop up in rapid succession, the ensuing events lead to Brigitte ending up in rehab. Girl Interrupted, folks, this is not.

Where the movie could have worked better is in the inhabitants of the rehab center. With the exception of Ghost (Tatiana Maslany, who actually did not appear in Insomnia) and a couple of staff members, everyone else in the rehab center gets relegated to the role of extra. This area of the film could easily have been bulked out (and with the movie running ninety-four minutes, there was certainly enough time for it). Still, for what it is, it's otherwise quite nicely done. It throws things at you you're not expecting on a fairly regular basis, the incidental music (performed by Canadian auteur Kurt Swinghammer) is fantastic, and like its predecessor, it's a lot of fun. A worthy sequel. *** ",1109894400,,1529,4.846743295019157
1993858,4,B0001EFV7M,"In this second movie, Brigitte is on her own and seeking a cure for her own lycanthropy.  The monkshood she has been using only delays things.  An encounter with a second werewolf lands Brigitte in a center for teen addicts.

As Brigitte tries to escape the facility she must also try and get her serum back so that she can delay her transformation.  She also meets a strange young girl known as Ghost whose grandmother is recovering from serious burns in another part of the facility.  Eventually they manage to escape the facility and the other werewolf until the film comes to its surprising conclusion.

A pretty good movie but it was lacking a few things.  I was curious as to what happened to Brigitte's mother.  There was interesting developments with her in the first movie.  Who is the other werewolf?  Is he the guy we thought cured in the first movie?  What about the tails?  In the first movie one of the first signs of infection was the growth of a tail.  This is missing in this movie.

Other than a few inconsistencies with the first movie, this is quite an interesting film.  Some of the revelations are not as surprising as they might have been intended but they still work well.  All in all a pretty good movie about dealing with impending werewolfdom.",1105574400,,1270,4.5777777777777775

On her own and mistaken for a drug addict and then tossed in to rehab is quite an original concept.  I actually liked this movie even more than the first.  Without her daily doses you know it won't be long until the tranformation happens and it's drawn out perfectly.  I have a suspicion that the werewolf stalking Brigitte was the guy Ginger infected in the first movie, but that was never mentioned.

With some time having passed since Part 1, ""Unleashed"" finds Brigitte (Emily Perkins) alone in the big city, still relying on monkshood (aka wolfsbane) extract to hold off the eventual werewolf transformation, and stalked out by a male monster wolf that regards her as a potential mate.  After being found passed out in the snow and mistaken for a drug addict, she's locked up in a rehabilitation center, cut off from her wolfsbane, and still being sought by the beast.  Under threat from the monster on the outside and under attack from the monster within herself, and surrounded by manipulative and often sometimes aggressive individuals in the institution, Brigitte finds an ally in an imaginative young girl nicknamed Ghost (Tatiana Maslany) while being increasingly consumed by the dawning bloodlust inside.  With greatly improved technical aspects and universally irreproachable performances (Perkins's performance alone is the stuff of which legends are made) and a series of unpredictable twists that step well outside of expectations, ""Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed"" is a serious contender for the title of best movie of 2004.",1099440000,5,1282,5.300492610837439

Later on she's discovered in the snow, and she's taken to a drug rehab center, in which they still keep her even after they discover what she's taking would kill a normal human being. This doesn't make sense becuase if someone is talking a poison that would kill you or me, but for some reason they are alive, usually you'd call someone. They killed the movie as soon as Alice, the woman in charge of the hospital, gets ahead of herself. This movie shows how stupid people can be. And what was with ""Ghost""? Ghost a girl who lives at the hospital,.......well I won't give away the ending even though I would like to. If you want to see it, see it. It's not much of a horror movie, but it's has an interesting story. Not that interesting, but disturbing and interesting enough.

1993862,4,B0001EFV7M,"I watched this one before I saw Ginger Snaps, if you like werewolf movies this is the way to make them. The movie points more to becomming a fresh tearing, heart eating animal, and less on the typical slasher film style of the 80's.

If you don't know what this is about, she's turning into a werewolf. After passing out on what seems to be the cure she wakes up in a rehab clinic. Worse she's been fallowed by a werewolf that is hunting her.

If you don't like it the first time watch the character of Ghost more closely. They add some things that catch you by supprise if you fallow her actions more.

The prequil Ginger Snaps Back is the best one, they could make it into a series on cable and I'd watch it. The film style, music and lack of showing the whole werewolf is what I like best. I figure if you can't make it look real don't show it. Plus CGI sucks.",1097971200,2,863,4.125

The plot to ""Ginger Snaps 2"" is quite literally one of the most original that I have ever seen. The acting is superb and more than credible for a low budget b-rated horror flick and the only thing I was disappointed in was the special effects. I thought the werewolves looked like giant stuffed animals. Granted, I'm sure the movie's creators would much rather had better effects, but did their best with a low budget. Still, ""Ginger Snaps 2"" made up for its horrible special effects with plenty of gore, blood, and scenes that make you absolutely squirm. I also thought the main actress did a fantastic job and it was nice to see a talented unattractive female (she resembles a much skinner Marilyn Manson) pull off a role without having to resort to scanty clothes and nude scenes.

 A must for all true horror fans.",1091664000,4,1069,4.533678756476684
1993865,4,B0001EFV7M,"I loved the original Ginger Snaps and from reading what the sequel was about, I just couldn't help myself from renting it from the local video store.  This is not the normal sequel.  It is more of a continuation or aftermath of the first.  At the end of Ginger Snaps 1 we are left with the newly infected Bridgette and her sister Ginger dead on the floor.  Now we find Bridgette as in the streets of a Canadian city (I forgot which one) who is constantly injecting herself with Monkshood.  It turns out that it isn't the cure but that it just delays the effect.  One day she accidentally overdoses and collapses. (right after being attacked by a male a werewolf that is stalking her)  She is then wakes up at a drug clinic for teenage girls with drug problems, and since she no longer has her Monkshood, her changes pick up the pace.

One thing about the appearance/change of Bridgette is that unlike her sister Ginger (who became sexy as she slowly transformed) Bridgette becomes rather ugly near the end.  The way she changes is also different; this could be from her age how she was infected etc. One of Ginger's first changes was that she sprouted a tail.  Bridgette on the other hand, grows ears and she must cut off the tips to look normal.  The werewolf itself has also changed.  It has a lot more hair and is grey in appearance.  It also has annoying Jaw thing.  By that I mean that it's permanently barring its teeth.  I felt that the puppetry in the original was better, but that doesn't drag down the film.

The acting by Emily Perkins as Bridgette is every bit as good as the original.  But now that Ginger has been reduced down to appearing as a ghost that only surfaces every now and then, Ginger is replaced by the younger character nicknamed Ghost.  A fellow patient who narrates what goes around her.  While this is a worthy sequel, what mainly doesn't make it 5 stars worthy is that it still isn't the same/as good.  And as for the ending, I can guarantee you that the ending may seem to come out of nowhere and be a slap in the face.  If you felt the original was depressing, prepare to be burned at the stake.  At first is was considering giving it 3 or even 2 stars.  I was that depressed.

But the next day I watched it with Production Commentary; something the DVD of the original didn't have.  I understood it a lot better and laughed occasionally.  Now this is PRODUCTION COMMENTARY.  We do not have Emily Perkins or any other actors.  It's just the director, producers, executive producers, etc.  It's surprisingly good.  After I finished with the commentary, I realized that while what happened to Bridgette may have been a surprise it was essential and necessary and is what comes with the curse of the werewolf.

The other DVD features are ok, not great.  But it's certainly better then those found on the original.  The only thing that it appears the DVD sold in Canada has more features and I believe even a blooper reel and a preview of Ginger snaps 3.  Speaking of Ginger Snaps 3, it will actually be a prequel set in the times of when Canada was a colony.  I have NO clue as to how this will work when it has the same characters.  My guess is it's a past life thing or something...  Hope this helped.  Buy it today if you love the series.",1091491200,11,3272,4.400667779632721
1993866,4,B0001EFV7M,"I am a big fan of Ginger Snaps and have known for some time now that they were planning back to back sequels this idea both intriguied me and worried me a little too.
However having seen Unleashed now for the 4th time and the 1st one damn I don't know maybe 12/15 times I can say without a doubt that part 2 is a worthy sequel with flaws.
My anticipation level for part 3 is HIGH very HIGH!!!
Heres a breakdown.
In the original Ginger Snaps two sisters are attacked by a werewolf one is bitten the other is not.
Instead of full moons and silver bullets the movie reinvents the whole idea of werewolves by making the transition slow and the monster virtually killable by any means.
To top it off Ginger the sister who is bitten is at the ripe age for puberty so her transformation looks just like any other young girl going thru the motions.
This film is clever in so many ways and is an absolute cult classic that has been steady in gaining a fan base here in the states.
Part 2 is basically an extended ending to part 1.
It is meaner and darker and in the end very tragic.
The premise for the third one is kind of a""what if""scenario I presume because it takes place like a hundred years b4 the 1st one with the original incarnation of the two sisters battling the same problem.
I don't get it yet fully either but the previews have me hooked.
Again the ideas behind these sequals are not hack and slash cash cows they are extensions on very clever idea hopefully part 3 is the last cause I hate to see a good idea beat to a bloody pulp.
For instance how many Crow movies are there now?!?!?
If you love Snaps hunt down the Seville Canadian versions the films are the same realeased here in the US but the Canadian versions are packed with different features.",1091145600,,1758,4.250746268656717

The screenplay throws in a couple of twists to catch viewers off guard.  The dialogue is dark with humourous undertones.  I liked the movie.

1993868,4,B0001EFV7M,"Having just watched ""Ginger Snaps"" last week I was surprised to learn that the original 2000 Canadian horror film has become part of a trilogy, with this first sequel, ""Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed"" and a final prequel, ""Ginger Snaps Back,"" both coming out this year.  I was surprised mainly because at the end of the first film Ginger is dead, so I was not really expecting to see Katharine Isabelle back in this one, but the screenplay by Megan Martin finds a way of bringing the title character back.  However, the werewolf who needs to be worried about being unleashed in this film is Ginger's younger sister, Brigitte (Emily Perkins, who you may remember as the young Beverly Marsh in the television version of Stephen King's ""It""), who had made her sister's curse her own in a tragic effort at sibling solidarity.
Now Brigitte is trying to control the transformations, desperately shooting up injections of wolfsbane.  She has also been cutting herself each daily, keeping track of how long it takes to heal because that tells her how close she is to the change (she heals faster the closer it gets).  Knowing that the full moon brings on the change would just make things too easy for her.  But Brigitte has bigger problems because she is being stalked by a growling four-legged figure who wants a little lycanthropic loving.  She survives an attack but ends up in a drug treatment ward for young female addicts.  Assumed to be a suicide risk because of all the cuts, the staff is not sure what to make about the monkshood; after all, it is not a stimulate, but basically plant food.
The point of ""Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed"" is to find out what happened to poor Brigitte.  The opening reminds us about what is going on, but if you have not seen the original there is no reason to watch this one because it is the first film that makes us care about what Brigitte can do to avoid Ginger's fate.  At one point the memory of Ginger tells her sister that it is not use to fight what is in her.  Brigitte insists that she is strong and Ginger's ghost can only laugh and note, ""That's not how I remember you the first fifteen years of your life.""  But Brigitte snaps back, ""It's how I remember the last fifteen minutes of yours.""  Unfortunately, there are some things even worse than what she can imagine will happen (the obvious options represented by Ginger and the prowling wolf beast).  As was the case with the first film, Perkins' performance anchors the film from going off into the realms of camp.  She is the only one who knows what is going on and does not make the standard mistake of such people in horror films of assuming anybody is going to believe her.
But the big twist in this film is that there is somebody who is more than willing to believe there is a werewolf on the ward.  A young girl named ""Ghost"" (Tatiana Maslany) reads enough comic books about monsters and such to know more than a little bit about werewolves.  Ghost is there because the building houses not only the detox center but a ward for long term care patients.  Ghost's grandmother was severely burned in a fire and until Brigitte showed up the heavily bandaged old lady was all she really had in the world.  Of course, Ghost is strange enough that the other girls pick on her and without conscious thought Brigitte finds herself in a sort of sibling relationship, except this time she is the older and wiser one.
The key members of the staff are Alice (Janet Kidder), the counselor who thinks she has been through what Brigitte is experiencing and can therefore help, Tyler (Eric Johnson), the guard who is only interesting in trading the drugs the addicts crave for sex, and Dr. Brookner (Patricia Idlette), who thinks Brigitte's fears about turning into a werewolf probably means she is a lesbian.  The rest of the girls are minor figures, with only Beth-ann (Pascale Hutton) singled out simply because somebody from the cast needs to be reduced to food halfway through the movie.
There are less special effects that the first film, which means the gore level is reduced somewhat.  The best sequences involve more imagination than graphic violence anyhow.  The film is directed by Brett Sullivan, who was the editor on the original.  What carries this film are the relationship between Brigitte and Ghost, especially since the younger girl insists on providing a spooky narration to even the most mundane events, and the fact that you get a surprise ending.  Sometimes fate has a wicked sense of humor and there are worst things than being annoying.
""Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed"" was shot back-to-back with ""Ginger Snaps Back,"" which is set back in 19th-century Canada as Ginger and Brigitte take refuge in a Traders Fort that is attacked by savage werewolves.  Although they are helped by an enigmatic Indian hunter, once again one of the girls will be bitten by a werewolf and the sisters will again find they have no one to count on but each other.  The final film in the ""Ginger Snaps"" trilogy will be directed by Grant Harvey (""Friday's Tired"") from a script by Stephen Massicotte and Christina Ray.

On its own, however, Snaps2 is surprisingly successful at creating feelings of discontent and (pardon the pun) horror from camera angles, situations, and quirky characters. Horror today is not what it was in your grandfather's time when the creature ""was"" the scariest thing in the movie.

So when I heard about the sequel to Ginger Snaps I was a little weary about it. None the less I decided to rent it anyways because who knows, maybe I would be surprised with a fantastic movie again, and if not it would at least be some fun, entertainment. How wrong was I.

The movie starts off well enough, sending out an uncanny vibe that makes your stomach churn. Then the movie takes a 180 and starts heading downhill. Trying so hard to take the brutal gore, odd sisterly chemistry, and  grotesque humour, that made Ginger Snaps 1 such a hit, the film failes terribly.
 Scenes with the werewolf were few, and uneventful. Maybe they didn't have much money to spend on it but neither did the first film and I was still able to be scared skinless a couple times. No surprises, no suspense, and not enough Ginger (Katharine Isabelle). Emily Perkins (Bridget) didn't do a bad job acting, but her character was just plain scripted bad. Well the whole script was bad even with an okay plot. The character Bridget was played around with too much, she went off in all different directions. Instead of having Ginger appear more often, they tried to make Bridget have both her and Ginger's personal qualities and characteristics in a non psychotic way. A big no-no if you want to make a character believable. Really they could have had Bridget have more mental battles with Ginger to make the film better, but they didn't. No, they tried to replace her with that annoying tart Ghost, whom I wish to god could have got it in the end.
Skip this one it's a waste of time, go rent the first. I hear they're making a third instalment, a prequel. Hopefully Grant Harvey will do a better job and try to capture more of what John Fawcitt created.

1993875,5,B0001EFV7M,"Note: This review unavoidably contains spoilers for GINGER SNAPS.  If you haven't seen it yet, do so.  It's a smart, funny werewolf film with tons of character.  After you've done that, come back here.
This film picks up some months after the end of the first one.  Brigitte has left home and is living on the road, still infected by her sister's werewolf blood and virtually addicted to the monkshood solution that keeps her own transformation at bay.  After an unfortunate incident involving a nosy but well-meaning librarian, she finds herself in a rehab center, where she is naturally thought to have a basic chemical addiction.  She is befriended by a younger girl called Ghost, to whom life is like the comic books she smuggles in and reads when everyone has gone to sleep; she easily accepts Brigitte's story, and they soon form an uneasy alliance.  But Brigitte isn't just running away from her old life; there's a werewolf lurking just outside the doors of the facility that wants her badly.
Emily Perkins was fantastic as Brigitte in the first film, and she deservedly gets the full spotlight this time.  Her expressions, her delivery, everything is all so perfect it is impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.
UNLEASHED is a very different film than GINGER SNAPS, but it possesses the same smart writing and feel for its characters.  There is some humor, but the film seems darker in tone overall.  We no longer have the sisters interacting with each other, though Ginger does make some brief appearances as the voice in Brigitte's head - a device that could have come off very badly, but is sparsely and tastefully utilized.  Like its predecessor, this film does not pull any punches, and it treats its audience with respect.
The ending of the first film wasn't exactly all smiles, and neither is this one.  But I think it's an honest and realistic resolution to the character's situation.  In fact, part of what makes this film great is that it's a logical continuation of the story.  It is not a rehash by any means.  This is one of the good sequels, and you can pick it up with confidence.
The film on DVD is presented in widescreen and includes some deleted scenes, a closer look at some of the materials used in the film, storyboard comparisons and an interesting commentary track featuring the director and producers.",1085443200,58,2342,4.762376237623762
1993876,4,B0001EFV7M,"There is a problem with sequels of horror movies, they tend to go overboard on the gore, drop any semblence of plot, as well as original actors.  This was an exception to the rule, as well as the rule that most sequels are inferior.  This was on par with the original and in some ways better.
Bridgette is still in the predicament that she was in at the end of the first movie.  She mixed blood with her sister and started changing.  In this movie she is on the run and battling the disease.  She found that wolfsbane isn't the cure that they thought it was, it just delays the tranformation.  She is cutting herself to see how long it takes for the wounds to heal, gauging how far the illness has gone.  Ginger's ghost talks to her from time to time, telling her that it is futile, she just has to accept what is happening.
The main problem arises when a guy that is interested in Bridgett is attacked by a wolf creature and she is knocked out in the process.  When she awakes she is in a mixed institution where they think she is a drug addict, and won't let her have her monks hood.  The movie takes an air of desperation because she can't tell them exactly what is happening, and they take her desperation as a sign of addiction and put her through the program like everybody else.
This movie is edgier and creepier than the first one.  In the first movie, they are in a bright and seemingly supportive world where they face a desperate situation.  Here she is in a dark and restricted world where she has to face the same thing.  Her only friend is a strange and hyperactive girl named ghost.  Who aside from her cheerful manner, has the same morbid fascination that Bridgett and Ginger had in the first movie.  There is the sleezy orderly, who offers her the wolfsbane, but only for a price.  She later finds that he makes offers to all the girls at the institution, their poison for sex.  There is also a mix of other inmates, ranging from hostile, to delusional and pathetic who add to the crazy atmosphere.
Unleashed has more plot twists and turns, characters aren't all what they seem.  With the ending they coud easily crank out another sequel.  I know they have another one in the works, but that is a prequel.  They could do another movie based off some of the characters they introduced in this movie, one in particular but I don't want to give anything away.  They add more and more of the dark humor, so I eagerly await the prequel, and anything else that the creative crew behind it is planning on doing.",1085356800,,2521,4.380645161290323

I wrote the first review for this on amazon.co.uk, so i thought id write one here too. After a loooong wait and many updates to my Ginger Snaps fansite ([...]) i saw this movie and it really blew me away,i was expecting(and hoping) for the same feel as the first movie,we do not get this though,Ginger Snaps has evolved into something way bigger and better, the feel of the movie is much darker. The new characters,however small some parts may be all add to the tension and humour of the film,i just have to mention GHOST! even if you hated the first movie and the characters Ghost alone is worth watching this movie,orrrrr she so cute! she gives so many laughs,shes smart and stupid at the same time,and her serious yet sarcasticly sounding comments like ""when you close your eyes is it hell you see?"" are dvd pausing, cant stop laughing moments. The ending is in the same form as the first,the final struggle for your fate,i was not expecting an ending similar to the first,and it wasnt, but it was not what i was expecting either,anyone who tells you they predicted the ending before the last 15 minutes are TOTAL LIARS!despite the ending being hinted at through the entire film (you notice the second time you watch it) it is impossible to predict, its a real tear festering kick in the face, but thats what i loved about the first. DVD includes lots of behind the scenes footage,and stuff on special effects,visual effects, it includes pages from brigittes diary,some of ghosts artwork,the trailer for Ginger Snaps Back,a commentary,ginger snaps 2 tv spots and trailer,cast audition tapes,storyboards and deleted scenes!(nearly all of 'Alice's' scenes were cut), and on the audition tapes you see many scenes that didn't even get filmed,one where brigitte wakes up in rehab and Ghost tells her shes at a body farm and they are going to harvest her limbs,great stuff.

1993879,5,B0001EFV7M,"Im surprised to see that someone gave this movie a 2. Even though it cant and shouldnt appeal to everyone, the production and acting alone make it worthy of a 3. This is amazingly good for a direct DVD release, expecially considering that the budget had to have been next to nothing.
I really liked this movie, as well as the first. This is the type of mood movie that you either ""get"" or dont. Even rated as simplisticly as just a ""horror movie"", this is much better than the typical hollywood shlock that gets global release - but its way more than that. There are dark, smart characters that I think you probably need to be able to relate to, to really like this movie. If you enjoyed movies like Donnie Darko, Heathers, May and other classics, you'll probably like the Ginger Snaps movies.
So thats my 30 second review. Have fun and pass the wolfsbane.",1083628800,5,856,4.45859872611465
1993880,5,B0001EFV7M,"Ginger Snaps 2 is a creepy gem. The original was a bit dark, but this movie takes the cake in the mood department. This film goes from one cool setup to another,it has great sets and an even better performance by emily perkins than in the original.you watch it thinking you have a pretty clear idea how it will end,but ill bet good money you will be wrong.",1083369600,2,356,4.25
1993881,5,B0001EFV7M,"The sequel to Ginger Snaps is like the original movie in one way - -  it's on a different plane than American teen horror pics.  The acting is better than the WB-level you see in American slasher films, the images are more interesting, and (best of all) the Ginger Snaps movies use suspense rather phony shocks every ten minutes.  American horror hasn't been this good since John Carpenter directed Halloween and The Fog.
There's one difference between Ginger Snaps 2 and the original, though.  In Ginger Snaps the only literal monster was the werewolf that found Ginger and her sister Brigitte.  In Ginger Snaps 2 there isn't a single character that isn't a monster.  And they're almost all human.
While Ginger Snaps was really about two young sisters (""Together forever"") who fight becoming women and the ""curse"" that entails, Ginger Snaps 2 is a look into the hell of child abuse and drug addiction.  The werewolf that Brigitte is running from (who always, always finds her) is just the monster that takes her there.
Brigitte has been staving off her transformation into a wolf by cutting herself and shooting up the poison monkshood (wolfsbane).  After an attack by the wolf who's hunting her, she wakes up in rehab with other young female junkies and abuse victims.
Ghost is is girl of about twelve, in the center waiting for a foster home.  Barbara, who was taking care of Ghost, was burned in a fire.  Ghost, who may have attention deficit disorder, hides comic books (which teach her werewolf lore) and fixates on Brigitte the way Brigitte attached herself to Ginger before Ginger started to grow up without her.
Alice, a former junkie, runs the center.  (""I've been where you are."")  Beth-ann torments Ghost by throwing pennies at Ghost's head.  (""It's an old tradition, throwing coins at the freaks.""  Ghost gets a chance to return the coins.)  Tyler, an orderly at the center, trades the young women drugs for sex.  As bad as Tyler is, there's someone worse who manipulates Brigitte into punishing him.
In a way, though, innocence triumphs in the end.
While running from the wolf that's after Brigitte, and from the human monsters at the center who are supposed to be helping them, Ghost asks Brigitte about the wolf that bit her and Ginger.  Did it come from the infinite darkness?
""No.  More like the suburbs.""",1083024000,,2323,4.8085642317380355
1993882,5,B0001EFV7M,"The original Ginger Snaps had an unusual mix of horror and humor that gave it a strong identity. And by using werewolves as a metaphor for a girl's coming of age ordeal it set a new standard for horror. Ginger Snaps 2 nearly lives up to that standard giving Emily Perkins genuine leading lady status. She provides the emotional weight that holds GS2 together despite the absense of the first one's black humor. Except for an ending that is really twisted and very surprising.
  We catch up with Brigitte roughly a few years after the first movie ended. We discover that she is still infected because the monkshood does not actually stop the transformation into a werewolf, it only delays it. With her sister dead she is all alone now trying to fight off the inevitable. Adding to her misery: she is being pursued by a male werewolf (presumably, Ginger's boyfriend from the first GS whom she infected by ""doing it"" with him) who is intent on mating with Brigitte. The genius here is again using the lycanthrope backdrop as a metaphor for the depiction of the lonely life of a junkie. The flick's opening scenes of Brigitte shooting up in the bathroom are priceless. Brigitte eventually winds up in a clinic that has a crooked orderly dealing drugs to patients in return for sexual favors. She meets Ghost, a young girl who's grandmother is recovering after being burned from head to toe. Because grandma was raising Ghost, there is no one else to care for her so the staff allows Ghost to live there. It just so happens that Ghost has a facination for werewolf comics. The two girls bond in a way after the young girl realizes Brigitte's secret. Together, they escape the clinic and take refuge in grandma's house with the big bad wolf still stalking them. (A obvious homage to Little Red Riding Hood.) Once there, a standoff takes place and a dark secret is revealed.
  All throughout this movie Brigitte sees visions of Ginger (Katherine Isabelle returning in an effective cameo)suggesting that B still feels close to her sister even though Ginger isn't there anymore. But the visions almost seem to be haunting B and always appear foreboding.
  Then there is the ending which is very surprising ,twisted and abrupt. It stays with you because of Brigitte's rather undignified fate and considering how much we rooted for her through two movies. Obviously, that was the intention and it works when you stop and think about it. It's sad and almost comical at the same time.
  I hope Ginger Snaps 3 can live up to its predecessors.",1082851200,3,2528,4.716553287981859
1993883,3,B0001EFV7M,"The first GINGER SNAPS movie became somewhat of a cult classic with it's unique blend of horror and dark humor.
It was one of the best small budget independent films released in years and I gave it 5 Stars !!!
Ginger Snaps 2 on the otherhand falls flat in 2 regards.....
First... the pacing of the story just drags along with no real heightening of tension or drama.
It starts at one pace... moves at one pace and then ends at that same pace with no real building of tension or drama or sense of impending doom.
It just plods along.
Second.... the ending !!
Yuk.. simply stated... the ending is not a fitting ending for the character of Bridgette who after 2 films eclipses her sister Ginger from the first film.
The ending pretty much makes a trite summary of her whole ordeal and is very, very anti-climatic and dissapointing.
Ginger Snaps 1 is a DVD we will probably watch time and time again here at the house.
Ginger Snaps 2 will probably never see the inside of my DVD player again. Simply not entertaining or compelling enough to sit thru and watch again.
I will say though the acting and direct to video filmography is all top-shelf professional and commendable.

1993885,5,B0001EFV7M,"I am a *huge* fan of the original 'Ginger Snaps'.  By that, I mean that I have been responsible for some 40 or so people seeing that film who never would have seen it otherwise.  I have bought 5 copies of it for friends.  I have sent copies of the initial Canadian pressing to the US, with all of its glorious extras and widescreen presentation that weren't available on the initial disc.  I have, in other words, done my very best to ensure that everyone I know who might be even slightly interested has seen 'Ginger Snaps'.
Therefore, it was with a touch of trepidation that I picked up the sequel.  I lived too far from anywhere running it in a theatre to see it properly, and had to wait for the DVD release.  So, release day came, I put the DVD in, and...
Wow!  What a great movie, and certainly what a great follow-up to the first film!  'Unleashed' starts off with a bang and really doesn't let up until the end.  Throughout the film, we're treated to fantastic performances from Emily Perkins and the rest of the cast, once again mostly female, with the notable exception of the uber-creepy Eric Johnson.  All the ingredients of this film are just as potent in terms of metaphor and things, just in new and different ways.  If you loved 'Ginger Snaps', you'll love 'Unleashed'.  Really!  Also, be aware that the new prequel, 'Ginger Snaps: The Beginning' should be out soon too, and also looks super amazing.",1082160000,,1416,4.5058823529411764

The make-up effects on Brigitte and the werewolf were excellent. This movie has a lot more style than its original. But only one thing that the original has that this one doesn't have is a great ending. The ending to this movie was unsatisfying and it has left questions unanswered that need to be answered. The directing by Brett Sullivan (who film edited ""Ginger Snaps"" (2000) is excellent. The story & screenplay by Megan Martin is excellent. The music by Kurt Swinghammer is excellent.

1993889,5,B0001EFV7M,"Well I must say that if the rating system on this review went up to 50 stars I would probably give it just that! Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed was an excellent film and sequel. The movie starts off with a very action packed scene where Bridgette runs home and reilizes that the ""beast"" has found her, leaving her no option but to pack her bags right away. After the action Bridgette ends up in a medical centre. The plot was very well written and I was surprised about the acting. Bridgette has defenitly matured as a woman in this movie as apposed to Ginger Snaps. As Ginger Snaps being a canadian movie I think the actors, directors, producers and make-up artists and every one else involved with the film did an amazing job! Lots of action with new characters and gore! I was extremely confused with the lycanthrope (warewolf) that was chasing bridgette. Throughout the whole movie I was trying hard to figure out who this beast was and what he/she wanted. Other than that one little confusion the movie was great with action, gore, and humor. I would strongly reccomend this fim to everybody but especially to those who have seen the first, horror fans, action fans, ""Goths"" and just anybody that is looking to see a great horror film. I really hope this movie sells well earning the credit that it deserves. Cant wait to see the 3rd installment, Ginger Snaps 3.

1993890,5,B0001EFV7M,"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This is a sequel worthy of the original in many ways.  Although the black humor is toned down a bit from the original, and the lycanthropy-as-menstruation angle has been dropped, this movie still works very well.
Emily Perkins is an absolute joy to watch, and her portrayal of Brigitte really drags you in, sympathizing with her all the way, even as she transforms.  Tatiana Maslany's Ghost is a different character, however.  Where Brigitte was totally devoted to her sister, Ghost's devotions and affections are tinged with a very-real insanity and inability to hold back from urges we all have.
Katharine Isabelle's Ginger makes a reappearance as a twisted version of Jiminy Cricket, not so much playing Brigitte's conscience as hammering away at it, with comments like ""you've got two choices, give up, or give in.""
The creature effects are superior this time around, although to me, that wasn't too important.  Still, the story holds up very well, which IS important.
I know there's a prequel in the works, but I really hope the ""franchise"" continues with a sequel to ""Unleashed,"" because without giving anything away, this ending even more that the original is very hopeless and depressing.
I've only seen a screener at current, so no ideas what the deleted scenes or extras will be like.

1993891,4,B0001EFV7M,"""Ginger Snaps: Unleashed"" was, ...well ""unleashed"" on Canadian Audiences January 30th and is due to hit the US on video in April, 2004. When we left poor Brigitte (Emily Perkins) she had just taken her sister's life-recall the incredible basement/bedroom battle scene. As she had been emotionally dependent on Ginger (wolf or no wolf) the loss of her big sis leaves her exceptionally lonely and more maladjusted then ever. Oh yeah, but now she too is a ""carrier"" and is dependent on her concoction of poisonous monkshood (sp?) to prevent further transformation into wolf form. Her questionable ""drug use"" buys her a one-way ticket to sucksville-- a drug treatment facility. As with the movie's predecessor, Brigitte's unique personality with its special blend of non-conformity and social dependence, leads to interesting dynamics with the other characters: namely Ghost (Tatiana Maslany), a fellow quirky inpatient and Tyler (Eric Johnson-Teen Tristan from Legends of the Fall) the hormonal and underhanded orderly. And what kind of sequel would this be without our favorite lupa, Ginger...., not much of one! Katharine Isabelle (Ginger Snaps and Freddy vs. Jason) makes a return appearance via hallucinations encouraging Brigitte to succumb to her animal instincts. Jake Mackinnon plays the werewolf who would be more than happy to aid in Brigitte's animal growth...
Although this movie is not as good as the first, it can/does/will stand on it's own. The character development, as was the case in original Ginger, was magnificent. The Canadian backdrop beautiful-as usual--and the FX are improved from the prior film. The only downside...no MIMI (I divorced Tom Cruise before Kidman)ROGERS. She was a hoot in the original movie.

Not to mention the ending didn't really provide a sense of closure or make you feel like there was any hope left for Brigitte to be put out of her misery. So there was really no logical ending to this film compared with the first Ginger Snaps. Definitely left feeling disappointed by the end of it. If you've already seen the first Ginger Snaps, I would disagree with anyone who claims you need to watch this one. It just made me feel like Ginger Snaps should have been a standalone film.

Emily Perkins continues her riveting performance as Brigitte, trying to delay the on-set of her werewolf infection while fleeing the attentions of a male of the species.  Ghost, a 13-year old werewolf groupie, enters the story with delightfully unexpected consequences.  On a second level this film is fascinating because of its connections to Orphan Black.  In her first major film role, seventeen-year old Tatiana Maslany plays Ghost and, no surprise, steals the picture.  John Fawcett was an Executive Producer and later co-created Orphan Black.  You can see similarities between the two productions in lighting, sound and how tension is built in empty, dark scenarios.  Fawcett has also stated his experience with Maslany on this film was a major factor in having her audition for Orphan Black.",1483833600,,957,5.25
