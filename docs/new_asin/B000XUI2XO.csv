8229841,4,B000XUI2XO,"I adore Takeshi Kaneshiro so I buy all his movies when they come out on region one. This was a fun little movie and he was actually quite adorable in in. There was one scene I played back a few times because he seemed so innocent and playful. It's a decent movie, odd casting for his mother though, but honestly if I didn't adore Takeshi (not only looks but his acting as well) I wouldn't have spent so much for the DVD. I wasn't disappointed though. It's a feel good movie with a lesson learned in the end and the cast is good.",1220572800,,528,4.135922330097087
