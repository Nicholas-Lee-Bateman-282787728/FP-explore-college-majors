2838229,5,B000QGE85Q,"My sister got me hooked on McLeod's Daughters when she was stationed overseas and sent me Season 1 after she watched it.  Growing up in farm & ranch country, it was easy to become attached to the characters and what they went through.  There are some differences in equipment and problems that they face since the show is from Australia and since it's television, but overall it's fairly authentic and the characters are believable.  Season 3 was excellent.  It was a bit more complex than the previous 2 seasons, building and expanding, giving the characters and relationships more depth.  As in all television shows, some of the relationships end (sometimes tragically) and new ones begin.",1187654400,4,691,4.973913043478261
2838230,5,B000QGE85Q,"Mcleod's Daughters is a show I first saw on WE- After it ended,I was heartbroken not to see how things continued-well, it has been sometime since then and thank you to YOU TUBE, I have been able to keep up with my girls in Australia-Season 3 is a MUST HAVE-from Claire's pregnancy,thru Seeing Lights with the birth of Charlotte and Tess's exciting adventure in the grain silo to the SO SAD My Noon,My Midnight episode-I cried for days and then found relief with ""Goodbye""-This series is one that encompasses all in human nature with excellent acting,beautiful scenery,and the hope for another day. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!Check it out from the start-you won't be sorry!",1187395200,2,664,4.9375
2838231,5,B000QGE85Q,"First.. I hope that the ""29 episodes"" listed above is wrong because I seem to recall that there were 30 episodes to this series (this being the first series that they had 30+ - series 4,5 and 6 all had 32 - right?).  This to me is the best series of the 6 that I have seen.. One of so much joy (esp.. Claire and Alex) and so much sadness [I have yet to get through ""My Noon, My Midnight"" and ""The Long Goodbye"" without crying - it was a good thing Lisa and Aaron won the Logies that year (unfortunately Bridie was nominated against Lisa - they should both have won..)].  I am anxiously awaiting series 3 to dvd and the rest of them.. I can't watch my Aussie copies here in the states (which has been released to series 6) and I am really missing the show! Such a spectacular show!",1187136000,,780,4.091503267973856
2838232,5,B000QGE85Q,"I caught this series in the middle of series 2. I watched it to the end of series 3, when WE stopped carrying it.
I purchase series 1 from amazon, and it is very good, because it is about the girls and the ranch and daily travails.
Later in the series, boyfriends and whatnot intrude and it becomes more complicated. I am hoping to buy series 4 someday, but it is being released very slowly. They are finished with series 7 in Australia, so we are behind.
Highly recommended for moms, daughters, and anybody who loves Australia.",1183420800,10,528,4.453608247422681

She first got hooked when it was on one of our U.S. cable channels, but it was dropped after the 3rd season. Then there seemed to be issues getting the acceptable DVD format for US players. Finally, all the seasons are available and she can get her ""fix!"" For my wife, this series is #1 and she does not watch other soaps. For U.S. viewers: if you remember ""Dallas"", then McLeod's Daughters is an Australian production of similar proportions, but more believable. This series is well acted & well done! Some will find this priced expensively, but the price per episode would be similar to Itunes' prices and there is no puzzle for me in shopping for a present for my wife!

2838283,5,B000QGE85Q,"Season 3 of Mcloud's Daughter's has been an emotional roller coaster from the beginning.  I have been so captivated by the characters and storyline of this show from the first episode in the first season. I've gotten so involved that I can't wait to get home and see the next episode.  What a fun storyline, I love how two sisters reunite after so many years apart.  I love watching the struggles of living on a farm and dealing with day to day life, the financial difficulties, the demanding tasks, relationships that start, end and form through different trials and demands of life.
Season 3 has been the most emotional season yet, I didn't think my heart could make it through to the end of the season.  I'm not sure how the story is going to go next...
There were so many things that happened in Season 3, I laughed so many times and cried just as many. There were so many hopes and dreams of the future but now everything seems to be in the air and unsettled.  I couldn't believe the outcome of the last few episodes and I was very sad to see how everything was played out.  But am hopeful to see what life brings for Drover's Run in the coming seasons.
I LOVED the first two seasons, it was so refreshing to see a show that was different than everything else out there on TV...it was only by chance I came across this show and now I'm addicted!  I've recommended it to all my friends and family and many of them are now addicted as well!  I'll definitely see the coming seasons but am a little worried that they are going to turn into a soap and loose the effect they have now.
It's been great to escape to Drover's Run when life get's too crazy or I need a break...I love just catching an episode here and there or sitting down for a whole day and watching for hours upon hours!! I definitely would recommend this to anyone and am sure they would become an avid Mcloud's viewer!",1204243200,2,1885,4.3201133144475925

2838297,4,B000QGE85Q,"I loved the first two seasons, but in this season the show is starting to slide into soap opera.  Several of the plot twists are pretty obvious devices to maintain romantic tension.  People get over one another pretty quickly and move on to their next relationships, in ways that no longer seem credible and real.  Although there are still some humorous episodes to keep the series interesting, it's a real shame that the writers focused so heavily on the romance at the expense of the bigger stories of these interesting women coping with ranch life in the Australian outback.",1191974400,11,577,4.808080808080808
