8499540,5,B006JN87KM,"These are excellent episodes on the home front during the ""good war.""  I was only three and half years old at the time of Pearl Harbor, but by the time war was ended, I had a number of memories of the home front at least in my home town.  The series brought back many nostalgic memories.  Most young people in the later generations have no idea of the sacrifices made by all concerned at the time as well as the general collective efforts of the people at home made to support our troops serving in the various armed forces.",1512864000,,524,4.2727272727272725
8499541,3,B006JN87KM,"Really only about America and how the nation changed to meet the challenges of a World War. It is not about the battles or the fighting, but about Americans doing what was needed at the time to defeat the Axis powers.",1448150400,2,217,4.317073170731708
8499542,4,B006JN87KM,"I wanted a DVD that would present WWII on the home front and I believe this one does it reasonably well.  I agree with the 4 star reviewers:  Suzanne Lay and G. Stevenson.  I recommend buying and watching this dvd.  Well worth your time , money and effort.

8499543,5,B006JN87KM,"These two DVDs, have filled in and answered all the questions I had, about what took place in our hometown, during the war years. I constantly asked my parents about certain businesses, which made the largest contribution to these years and the war effort. Although TV was not quite in place yet. the radio waves did one hell of a job, informing people of, just about everything. There even was entertainment to get the horror stories of the war, off of their minds. The film is in very good shape and it sure as hell brought back many, many, memories to my Mother and other relatives. It is, in some ways, a nostalgic look back at these years, when the Greatest Generation, gave up so much of themselves to fight either Hitler and the Nazi's or the Japs, in the Pacific. Both fights, brought out the absolute worst of humanity, as American blood ran rivers, that flooded the streets of Europe or the Oceans of the Pacific Rim. There are some very sad stories, real stories, that involved people of Waterbury, Connecticut, and many other small towns, in which far too many men sacrificed their lives' to beat the Nazi's and Japs. ""America Goes To War,"" is a valuable collection of stories & incidents, that took place in America, during WWII. It shouldbe mandatory for all historians and those who  were just as curious as I....!!!",1419379200,2,1331,4.639830508474576

8499546,5,B006JN87KM,"As one who lived through the WWII years, this DVD has brought back a lot of memories.  Sometime then ""Good Old Days"" are remembered only for the ""good"" and the ""old"" but not always the struggles and difficulties that we also had to experience.  This DVD helps fill in these gaps.  Everyone today should see this.",1346976000,3,312,4.535714285714286

I first reviewed this series in 1990 and now it not only is a wonderful time capsule of the World War II years but also a look at how we viewed our history in a pre-internet digital world.  Journalist Eric Sevareid is the narrator imparting wisdom and gravity to stories.  There are no side bars and scrolling bands, no one tweets and you can't click a link to additional information.  This series tells the story of what World War II was like on the home front using newsreels, propaganda documentaries, movies, music and humor.  All of this chronicles the changes in American ideals, lifestyles and morals during the 1940s and 1950s.  The series in broken into the following parts: While the Storm Clouds Gather, Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition, Thanks for the Memories, Accentuating the Positive, Sacrifices and Shortages, A String of Pearls, On The Shady Side of the Street, Right in the Fuehrer's Face, Mood Indigo: Blacks & Whites and It's Been a Long, Long Time.  I found the Mood Indigo: Blacks & Whites dealing with African Americans on the brink of the Civil Rights movement particularly poignant. I think that it is an excellent work and offers the social studies teacher a wealth of primary sources.  The DVD format now makes it much more usable for the class room teacher.  I did not find printed sources or lesson plans for this series but it easy to use.
Recommended grades 6-12
