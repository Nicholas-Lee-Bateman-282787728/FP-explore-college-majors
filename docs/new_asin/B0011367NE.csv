After watching this film, go back, watch the beginning and listen to Sonja's poem. The poem is about lonliness, it sets the tone and speaks on the whole movie. While I understand the intent (it's almost a teaser to the peace), I think the poem would have been better at the end while Sonja was walking away as it says what needs to be said about the story as gives it a sort of peace and understanding and even beauty that the exsisting ending doesn't.

While this movie is about self-discovery, it is also about the lonliness of such a journey. And it is lonely and frustrating to feel a million things that can't be spoken. To have your mother misunderstand you, to not feel the way you're suppose to feel about boys -- the way all the other girls are feeling about boys, and to have this friend... this friend who touches you on so many unique ways down inside your soul, but who doesn't understand the depth of it. And on the one hand you want them to know and understand, but on the other hand you question... if they did, would I still have them? And it can tear you apart to hold this question inside you.

While there are flaws in the peice (the ending, the pacing, disjointed transitions), there's also a lot of heart in it. In the final scene between Sonja and Julia in the film I could feel Sonja's heart falling into her hands as she finally openned up to Julia. In fact, all through the movie I felt Sonja. The actress that played her was incredible and the story's core is beautiful. Like I said, you'll feel cheated by the ending at first. But then go back to the beginning and listen again to Sonja's poem for Julia and you understand the story so much better.",1223078400,2,1799,4.335311572700297
