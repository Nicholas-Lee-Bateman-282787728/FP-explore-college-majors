8200733,3,B000RHMQJ4,So many Japanese movies show the peasants struggles under the arrogant & lying landowners and this movie is another example of their struggles. Not a real typical ghost movie but a grievances.,1470355200,2,192,5.03125
8200734,3,B000RHMQJ4,"When the father dies from fretting over a debt, his wife and daughter go work for the master who hates peasants. His son is worse and has eyes for all the women. Mom and daughter eventually die also and cause snake hallucinations around the young master, perhaps one of filmdom's most inept rapist.

The acting was pretty bad, especially the death scene of the father,

No nudity or swearing. Off screen rapes.",1423612800,,410,4.680555555555555
8200735,5,B000RHMQJ4,"Easy-to-follow dialogue and elegant visuals. The desolate Japan Sea Coast scenery alone was worth the price!!! Unlike most Jdrama ... this kept me on the edge of my seat. Even though the ending was rushed I still enjoyed the story. It didn't bother me that ""Hebi No Onna"" is considered second-rate. Definitely earned a place in my permanent collection.",1373500800,2,352,4.983050847457627
8200736,5,B000RHMQJ4,Great film! Thank you for offering this selection. I was looking for this to add to my DVD movie collection.,1367798400,,108,4.45
8200737,4,B000RHMQJ4,"As a collector of foreign films old and new like Japanese classics: ""Kwaidan"", ""Onibaba"", ""Lady Vampire"", ""Madame O"", ""Slave Widow"", ""Ghost Story Of Yotsuya"", ""Blind Woman's Curse"" starring Meiko Kaji and erotic ones like ""Flower & Snake"" starring Naomi Tani, ""Manji"", ""Gate Of Flesh"" and ""In The Realm Of The Senses"" (the blu-ray by Criterion is fantastic) to the wild Pinky Violence films like ""Sex & Fury"", Meiko Kaji's Sasori series, ""Sukeban"", ""Zero Woman: Red Handcuffs"" and so many more, I am presently pleased with ""Snake Woman's Curse"". The film did have some dread and impending doom elements to it. Definitely a worthy purchase. Synapse is pumping out some good stuff. I made sure I bought Junko Miyazono's ""The Legend Of The Poisonous Seductress Trilogy"", ""Madame 0"", Christina Lindberg's ""Exposed"" and ""Wandering Ginza Butterfly"" 1 and 2 also starring Meiko Kaji.",1277078400,4,876,5.219858156028369
8200738,2,B000RHMQJ4,"I don`t enjoy disagreeing with the other reviewer of this film- he obviously knows what he`s talking about and is genre-knowledgable, but after seeing the supurb ""JIGOKU"" and ""Yotsuya Ghost Story"",I purchased this flick as soon as it was released and couldn`t have been more disappointed -it`s slow moving, none of its characters are fleshed out in any way, the horror element is non-existent and,truth be told, there is no real snake woman in sight- in stark contrast to what the dvd cover would have you believe.  Your money and your time would be better spent on his earlier works, or on other Asian Cult Cinema releases like ""Madame O"", ""Blind Woman`s Curse"" or Teruo Ishii`s ""Horror Of Malformed Men"" - all of which are a lot more fun and enjoyable to watch, IMHO.",1247875200,4,769,4.7388059701492535
8200739,4,B000RHMQJ4,"Nobuo Nakagawa is generally considered the father of the modern Japanese horror movie (J-horror).  As such, his status in Japan is analogous to Mario Bava's in Italy and Terence Fisher's in Britain.  All three directors burst onto the scene in the late-1950s/early-1960s after having labored in relative obscurity for decades, and their individual visual styles were so powerful that they basically reinvented the horror-genre traditions in their respective countries.  (Personally, I think they also stand head-and-shoulders above their imitators, thanks to an intelligence, tastefulness, and humanism that they all shared.)

""Snake Woman's Curse"" provides a decent introduction to Nakagawa's work and to what makes it special.  The supernatural elements are treated ambiguously.  (Are the ghosts real or the products of psychological guilt?)  Nakagawa makes striking use of color, lighting, and especially darkness.  There are hints of transcendence through death and entry into the afterlife.  And there is ample evidence of Nakagawa's ambition to transcend the perceived limitations of a genre picture, with provocative commentary on capitalism and the exploitation of women:  The plot concerns a family of peasants who return from beyond the grave to exact revenge on the family of silk merchants who wronged them.

Unfortunately, ""Snake Woman's Curse"" was one of Nakagawa's last feature films, and it was made several years after his peak.  (Most fans and critics regard his 1959 ""Yotsuya Ghost Story"" and his mind-bending 1960 ""Jigoku"" as his masterpieces.  Criterion already released ""Jigoku"" and apparently owns the rights to ""Yotsuya Ghost Story,"" which desperately needs a release.)  The supernatural aspects of ""Snake Woman's Curse"" are fairly conventional, which is not what one watches Nakagawa for.  And the movie's moral point of view lacks subtlety, which makes it seem sentimental and didactic.

Nevertheless, Synapse Films are to be commended for making this film available and giving us a more complete picture of Nakagawa's career.  And of course, they deserve a lot of praise for treating the film with so much respect.  The transfer is a beauty, with incredibly vivid and vibrant colors -- which are essential to any Nakagawa film.  It really is one of the best DVDs of a color Japanese film of this vintage that I've encountered.  (It's probably the most pleasant surprise I've had since I bought Animeigo's equally wonderful DVD of Shiro Toyoda's ""Portrait of Hell,"" which itself would make for a fantastic double-feature with ""Snake Woman's Curse."")  As far as extras go, there's some nice info about the film and Nakagawa's career via liner notes, poster galleries, and text-only screens.  The only disappointment for me was the commentary, which was recorded by a film scholar, who tries to make the case that ""Snake Woman's Curse"" is actually a more important film in Nakagawa's career than most critics/fans believe.  But apart from making a few fairly obvious points about the film's social message, he doesn't really say much.  In fact, the commentary doesn't take up more than half of the film, and you have to fast-forward past the gaps several times.  I think a video essay, like Criterion sometimes does, would have been far more effective.

All in all, if you're new to Nakagawa, ""Snake Woman's Curse"" is a good place to start, though you need to seek out ""Jigoku"" as well.  This DVD, however, is an essential purchase for those who love and admire the work of the great masters of horror, like Nakagawa, Bava, Fisher, and Roger Corman.",1209772800,15,3573,5.244718309859155
