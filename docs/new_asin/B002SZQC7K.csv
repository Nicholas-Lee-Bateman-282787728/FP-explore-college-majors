3983125,4,B002SZQC7K,The run time on the UK PAL version of this set of Doctor Who Specials is 240 minutes on 5 discs.  The US version set to be released in February 2010 has a run time of 131 minutes.  Something is definitely missing from the US version.  Don't know why they do that.  I'm sure the legions of Doctor Who fans in the US would be willing to pay more to get the complete set that is available to UK fans.  Please don't sell us short!,1261958400,2,426,3.9647058823529413
3983126,5,B002SZQC7K,"If you are a Die Hard Fan of the New Updated Doctor Who Series
Or been through The Classic Dr. Line-up This seems to be a Must have BR Box Set
This Story Arc Once again is Gonna Change everything in the Universe and Mythology of the World's Favorite & Only Time Lord
David Tennant is in the Same League as Previous Doctor's Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Sylvester McCoy & Christopher Eccleston
This being Tennant's  Final 5  Episodes/Specials Leading to his Death/Re-Birth
The Story and Set-up is Much, like Torchwood Children of Men  where it's a Emotional roller coaster

3983127,5,B002SZQC7K,"Ordinarily, I'd have to agree that this might seem a little steep.  Five episodes, five disks, $40+.  But if this is comparable to the British release, in addition to the specials you're also getting the full Doctor Who Confidential episodes for each special (as opposed to the 'Cut Downs' normally included in the Doctor Who boxed sets), David Tennant's video diaries (which are always good for a laugh, in my opinion) and the Doctor Who at the Proms special from last year which hasn't been released in this country at all.

Of course, I'd really prefer to see some confirmation from Amazon that this release matches the Region 2 release in the UK (which is out in January, incidentally).  If it does, I'd say it's worth what they're asking.",1260662400,70,743,4.736434108527132

And these 5 specials should fit on 2 discs (not 5).  You know? I've been paying $42 odd dollars for 13/14 episode seasons.  So, simple math here, I should be paying about a 1/3 of that for 5 episodes.  That equals about $14.  And as a die-hard Doctor Who fan, I'm willing to pay upwards of $20+, even $22 hard-earned American cash for these 5 episodes.  But $35 just seems like price gouging to me, and I'm not sure I support that in these lean economic times.  5 Stars because I love Doctor Who; 3 Stars for ripping me off!

David Tennant's performance as the 10th Doctor was so amazing and so moving that watching him leave the show definitely pulled many heart's strings or more accurately broke mine. He showed different aspects of the Doctor, especially in these specials, that it would definitely want you to watch them again and again.

3983145,5,B002SZQC7K,"David Tennant's final regular appearances as The Doctor (not counting the 50th Anniversary Special) occur in these five specials. ""The Next Doctor"" sees the Doctor return to 19th century London where he meets a possible future incarnation of himself and they battle together against the Cybermen. ""Planet of the Dead"" sees the Doctor and a busload of 21st century Londoners travel through a wormhole to a different planet where they must work together to return home. ""Waters of Mars"" features the Doctor traveling to Mars of the 22nd century where he attempts to save a colonization crew and must learn his own limits. Finally, in ""The End of Time"" parts I & II, the Doctor faces off against the Master and the Time Lords of Old as he readies himself for the end of his song. Though this contains less stories than a standard season, showrunner Russel T. Davies knew what he was doing and made each stand out on its own while adding up to something truly remarkable. Viewers are not only saying goodbye to a Doctor, but to a type of storytelling they would not see again until the eighth or ninth season under new showrunner Steven Moffat.",1488412800,4,1140,4.705

3983147,5,B002SZQC7K,"Bridging the gap between Series 4 and Series 5 is a collection of 5 episodes leading up to the regeneration from David Tennant to Matt Smith.  All in all these episodes were amazing in my opinion.  Seeing David Morrisey as ""The Next Doctor"" was a great choice as he did a superb job at playing the Doctor.  I still laugh when I see the Walking Dead and look at the governor and shake my head and say ""How could the doctor go so bad?""  The ending of the 2 part ""The End of Time"" still is one of David Tennant's finest hours at acting.  You feel his pain and his line of ""I don't want to go"" is even heartbreaking where it can even send shivers and tears down the face of even the most strongest of men.

The Waters of Mars was heart-breaking -- be sure to have a tissue handy.

3983184,4,B002SZQC7K,"Dr. Who The Complete Specials

This five disc set includes ""The Next Doctor"", ""Planet of the Dead"", ""The Waters of Mars"", and ""The End of Time"" parts 1 and 2.  Each disc has one of these episodes, usually running an hour, and about an hour worth of bonus material which is typically  a description of how they filmed it and any interesting goings-on with the episode.  I skipped over most of that except where I wanted to glean more background info about what I was seeing.  I watched this out of order, without having seen the last 3 seasons of Tennant as Dr. Who.  Dont do that if you can avoid it.  There are actors/characters and situations that either you won't properly understand, or this will spoil some of the surprise if you go back to where they first came in, or both.

The Next Doctor: This episode Im sad to say failed to move me.  In fact, in parts I found it irritating.  It could I think be skipped without missing anything too important for the overall storyline.

Planet of the Dead: this was reasonably fun.  Just for this episode Tennant as the Doctor is paired with Michelle Ryan, as a high class cat burgler.  Because Tennant was tracking an anomaly they both end up stranded on a dead planet far away, along with a whole busload of random passengers.  And of course not only their lives, but all of earth is at stake.  Nothing new there.  Michelle started out looking something like an Anne Hathaway knockoff [not that there's anything WRONG with that] but she definitely grew on me in the course of the hour, and her character plus Tennant did generate the high-electricity the audience likes to see between a male hero and a female bad-girl.  Shall I mention Batman and Cat-Woman?  Bond and...quite a few leading ladies?  You get the idea.

The Waters of Mars: This was perhaps my favorite episode, mostly because it tracked Last Days on Mars so closely.  This was released in 2009 and Last Days came out in 2013, so if anything the movie borrowed from the TV special's concepts.  Last Days on Mars however is a straight-up sci-fi/horror film, while Dr. Who always maintains some degree of-well, if not comedy, then at least optimism.  Notice the parallels and differences to the 2013 film when you watch this episode.  Tennants Who undergoes a significant change in his personality here, and it is a buildup to ""regeneration"": replacing him with the next actor as The Doctor.

This process concludes with the epic 2 hour The End of Time parts 1 and 2.  The kitchen sink is thrown in here.  Theres a 4 way power struggle going on between [evil] The Master, [good] Dr. Who, [bad] the British Prime Minister who thinks to use The Masters power for his own purposes but is actually way out of his league, and yes the whole hierarchy of Time Lords, from just before they were annihilated in their conflict with the Daleks.  Other figures have accessory roles: the Ood as warners and cheerleaders for the Doctor, a pair of cactus-humanoids who were just in the area scavenging, one of Dr. Whos former traveling companions, Donna Noble, and her elderly father who is played by Bernard Cribbens.  Cribbens acting is superb, and in a coffeehouse dialog between him and Tennet is found a dramatic peak for the two hours.  Cribbens completely disappears into his part and it really feels as if you're listening in on a conversation between an aging war vet and a time lord.

The 2 hours culminates with Tennant regenerating into the next Time Lord, played by Matt Smith who is the 11th Time Lord.  First glimpse of Smith: I think that I will like him equally as well as Tennant, who did quite a good job with this part.

Occasionally the technology in this show [I mean in the 2.5 years that Ive seen to date, not this particular show, nor this DVD set] changes without a rationale being presented.  And occasionally the show veers too heavily into chase sequences and computer graphics at the expense of character development.  Its best moments are actually in the better character dialogues like this coffee shop scene mentioned above, which has not a bit of props or computer graphics.  But after that, I admit I enjoy the quasi-silly quasi-serious monsters, the computer graphics etc.  And third, I appreciate the complex mix of moods the show presents, within the same episode.  With the aim of being family fare they intend to be somewhat scary at times, but not TOO scary, so that pre-adolescent kids can still watch it without having nightmares afterward.  Overall, this package gets a B-.  Of course fans aren't going to miss this, but for the more casual viewer, these five specials sort of keep getting better, one after the other, and #2 through 5 all have something worth seeing.",1458691200,,4708,4.659393939393939

3983187,5,B002SZQC7K,"This is David Tennant's last ""series"" on Doctor Who.  Even though I loved Christopher Eccleston's Doctor more, I was still very very sad to see David Tennant depart.

This is also the last ""series"" with Russell Davis (head writer) and Julie Gardner as the Executive Producers of Doctor Who.  They both did a fantastic job.

I got hooked the first time I saw Doctor Who on TV (the one where Christopher Eccleston plays as The Doctor). So much so, that I have bought almost every single Doctor Who seasons/series on dvd (i.e. the ones where Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant and Matt Smith play as The Doctor). I still cannot accept or watch Peter Capaldi as The Doctor, because (1) his heavy Scottish accent is hard to understand, and (2) he played Caecilius in the ""Fires of Pompeii"" episode of Doctor Who (I just keep seeing Caecilius whenever I see Capaldi play as The Doctor).

The writing/scripts are excellent. Everything starts with the writing/story, and Russell Davis as the Head Writer did an excellent/fantastic job.  Then everything else builds from there. The acting is great, the music is great, the visual effects are great, etc.

I have watched the Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant and Matt Smith Doctor Who series FIVE times, and will probably rewatch them again! That is how good everything is in these series.

Funny thing is, after watching them five times, I am finally seeing scientific improbabilities/mistakes and some plot holes. This series must be great, since I did not notice these mistakes during my first three viewings.  Russell Davis is definitely very strong when it comes to writing drama and comedy.  However, science and math are probably not his strong points, since there were a number a mistakes from a science perspective.",1457913600,4,1769,4.966101694915254

What I will do is list all of the episodes in this set because when I was looking to purchase ALL of the episodes including the specials, I had trouble finding out exactly what was in each set. Not knowing that, I had to order them and compare the episodes against the actual master list from the BBC.. These episodes originally aired after season 4, and before season 5.

Included in The Complete Specials:
""The Next Doctor""
""Planet of the Dead""
""The Waters of Mars""
""The End of Time"" Part One
""The End of Time"" Part Two

3983239,5,B002SZQC7K,"This set of specials is the official send-off for David Tennant from Doctor Who. The following is a list of the episodes and my personal feelings on them.

The Next Doctor:
A mediocre episode, not one of the best in my opinion. It features the Doctor in Victorian England, it's Christmas, and the Cybermen are loose. Not a good representation of them, but the ""other Doctor"" does a pretty good job as a Doctor.

Planet of the Dead:
Also slightly mediocre, but better than the previous one. It features the Doctor and some bus passengers on an alien Planet, but they get away from the terrifying monsters (not really terrifying).

Waters of Mars:
Excellent story, one of the best in this set. It features some astronauts on Mars with alien water that's alive. Great storyline, set design, makeup, fx, lighting, etc...

End of Time:
David Tennant at his best. This episode features the return of the Master, with the best writing I've ever seen in Doctor Who. It also features the departure of Tennant as the Doctor, with some of the most heart-rending scenes in the show's
history.

So with the departure of one of the best Doctors on Doctor Who, of course there's one other thing that needs to happen-regeneration. So with the most heart-breaking sentence ever heard on the show, his amazing 5 year tenure as the Doctor comes to an end with these words: ""I don't want to go"".

So enters Matt Smith as the eleventh Doctor.",1420675200,,1421,4.664

Aside from that my copy has an issue in the form of a permanent half-inch ""spot"" on the second disc (""Planet of the Dead"") that renders it unplayable. However, other than the one bum disc, which I'm sure is a fluke, this a great set.",1419811200,,379,4.205479452054795

3983243,5,B002SZQC7K,"To close out the David Tennant years, here is the perfect set for the DVD or the Blu fan.  All the specials from that last series, loads of special features, and the must-have piece of magnificence, DOCTOR WHO AT THE PROMS.  The glorious Murray Gold music for the first four series is here in a 60-minute concert at the Royal Albert Hall, with a full-blooded orchestra, the BBC Philharmonic, the London Philharmonic Choir, solo vocalist Melanie Pappenheim and conductor Ben Foster.  All your favorite cues are here, performed as they should be, with Oods and Sontarans and Cybermen and Daleks and many of the show's memorable creatures.  Of course, there is a Tardis onstage and a flat next to it with the words ""Bad Wolf"" spray painted.  There are movie screens mounted and constantly referred to in the editing to get you to those great emotional moments that the new series is famous for, and guest presenters Freema Agyeman and Catherine Tate.  You will hear, arranged as suites, the great stomping ticking clock music which became de rigeur for Doctor Who trailers, the unbearably beautiful theme for Rose Tyler, the lilting Freema theme, a special film and suite called ""The Music of the Spheres"", the inevitable Dalek march featuring Davros (Davros played by Julian Bleach, and the Dalek voice, of course, by Nick Briggs, with Barnaby Edwards inside the Dalek), the giddily playful Donna theme, the ""Girl in the Fireplace"" waltz, and so much more.  Brilliant, indispensable.  Buy it!

Did I mention that the classic Doctor Who theme is played by the full orchestra as a finale?  Conduct along with your own Sonic Screwdriver if you care to.",1419465600,,1647,4.892086330935252

The specials show us the doctor isn't always the hero we thought he was and is David Tenants farewell to the character.

By the time of the ultimate sacrifice, you are left with such a feeling of ""Oh no, not now"" and it is reflected int eh face fo the actors.  Enjoy these.",1418256000,,452,4.580246913580247

The End of Time - well, my problem is I can't stand the new regenerated Master.  He's too campy, and seems to be trying too hard to be an unhinged Joker.  The Master is the dark version of the Doctor, cunning, cold, manipulative, foreboding and charming.  This Master is none of those things.  Plus the lightning bolt throwing?  Thankfully ""The Next Doctor"" is great fun, ""Planet of the Dead"" is interesting and enjoyable, ""The Waters of Mars"" is awesome, and the End of Time is mixed.",1399075200,,813,4.366666666666666

Even though ""The Next Doctor"" wasn't filmed in HD the upscaling is still a great job and is only noticeable in a few parts overall. If you want to have these episodes in your physical collection there shouldn't be a reason to hold back.

I'm 38 & have been watching the Series since I was 6, so Peter Davison is my Doctor, w/ Tom Baker as my 2nd fave. The 5 Films on this 5-Disc DVD Set are all amazingly well produced, written, scored, & acted! Although the '05-Present Series has it's own flare, it does (wonderfully) rely heavily upon the story continuities of the Classic Series-& it elaborates (wonderfully) on the backstories that were established on the Classic Series. My personal favorite Film on the Set is ""The End Of Time-Pts. 1 & 2"", the last of Tennant's tenure as The Doctor. & having former James Bond 007 Timothy Dalton playing Rassilon (the character was shown in ""The Five Doctors""), Lord Persident of Gallifrey, is an excellent addition!

I think the specials here are very good science fiction stories in general and while I liked ""Planet of the Dead"" the least they all have a lot of positives that can be said about them.

3983300,5,B002SZQC7K,"This DVD set includes the final episodes of David Tennant's Tenth Doctor, and although it's maybe a little pricey for ""only"" five episodes, they're technically specials at the quality of short-films (and won awards as such, I believe) and the set comes with a satisfying amount of special features (full length Doctor Who Confidential behind-the-scenes videos, audio commentary on the final two-part episode, David Tennant's video diaries, Doctor Who at the Proms (which is a concert) and at Comic Con, and deleted scenes), so all and all I'd say this set is more than worth the money.

(spoiler-light brief thoughts on the specials themselves)

The Next Doctor is my favorite out of the Ten era Christmas specials. A proper Dickensian gothic nightmare complete with workhouses and the Doctor Who twist of Cybermen. It's great fun and gorgeous to look at.

Planet of the Dead is probably the weakest link of this set of specials, in my opinion. There's little to no actual plot advancement or character development that wasn't already covered in previous episodes; really the only important bit is in the last five minutes or so.

The Waters of Mars is probably my favorite Doctor Who episode that I've seen. It has a lovely old-school sci-fi feel, complete with a Mars base and an alien infection. The supporting cast are one of the best and Tennant gives one of his best performances in an episode that pushes the Doctor's character to new and scary extremes.

The End of Time (Parts 1 and 2) is worth the price of this DVD set alone if for nothing else than for Tennant's performance. Some of the writing trends dangerously near melodrama, but Tennant's performance grounds it in a believable sincerity. It's a more than satisfying conclusion to the story of the Tenth Doctor and one should probably have tissues handy when watching.

So yes, all and all a great collection and ultimately worth the price.",1386115200,4,1908,4.891640866873065
3983301,3,B002SZQC7K,"The specials themselves: Terrible

But when ""your"" Doctor regenerates, you shouldn't be feeling the urge to yell ""DIE ALREADY!""

3983307,5,B002SZQC7K,"I'm sure by now everyone knows these episodes mark the end of David Tennant's time as the Doctor and Russell T. Davies time as show runner.  This is a wonderful set, a must own for any fan of Doctor Who. That being said I have two warnings for people who want to buy this set.
 1) These are some of the most depressing episodes of  Doctor Who or any series I've ever watched. Tennant's Doctor stole my heart and then broke it quite a few times, especially in these final episodes. During ""The Next Doctor"" and ""Planet Of The Dead"" it's not so bad. ""The Waters Of Mars"" shows a darker side of The Doctor but then he just gets sad again and it bums me out. ""The End Of Time"" episodes are brilliant but the end of part 2 is heart wrenching so if you're emotionally unstable like I am, beware.
*Also I would have preferred having the last two episodes on the same disc. I think that would have made more sense and disc 5 could have been nothing but extras but what do I know.
2) The price. If you're thinking of buying this newer slim box version you're financially challenged like I am, be patient. The price drops down to $20 something fairly often. I ended up paying $39 only to see the price drop a couple days later. I was aware of this but let impatience get the best of me. Just a warning.
Yes, it's sad to see Tennant go but it was inevitable. I'm more bothered that this was it for Russell Davies. I certainly hope this review helps someone.
Edit 2017: I'm not sure how accurate my tip about the pricing is anymore. I just wanted to add that the series was never quite the same after RTD left and for me this was not a good thing at all. The new showrunner really botched things up during the Smith years and things only slightly imprived during Capaldi's tenure. If you're not a fan of Moffat's fairy tale, catchphrase, taglines instead of plots, writing I recommend stopping here altogether or skipping ahead to Capaldi's stuff. Nothing against Matt Smith but his last two seasons don't even feel like Doctor Who. Four yeats later and these specials are still a great yet depressing end to the wonderful work of RTD.",1379980800,15,2123,4.342569269521411
3983308,5,B002SZQC7K,"After series 4 they decided to do a whole season just consisting of 5 specials.  I'm not sure why, but that allowed the producers to take their time making these, & it shows.  I loved every single one of these stories.  Here's a review of each episode with synopsizes from the booklet.  Just be on the lookout for spoilers.

The Next Doctor:  Christmas 1851, and Cybermen stalk Victorian London.  The Doctor discovers a spate of mysterious deaths, and he's surprised to meet another Doctor!  Are two Doctors enough to stop the rise of the Cyberking?  When your biggest complaint is that the Cybermen are sexist (in choosing a woman to become their Cyberking) you know it's an excellent episode.  Even though we all know by now that David Morrissey wasn't the next Doctor, I think he would have made a good Doctor.  And I like any story with the Cybermen in it.  Remember, they were assimilating people even before Captain Kirk was around.  A+

Planet of the Dead:  When a London bus takes a detour to an alien world, the Doctor must join forces with the extraordinary Lady Christina.  But the mysterious planet holds terrifying secrets and time is running out as the deadly Swarm gets closer... This was another excellent episode.  I didn't like the ending where he helped the thief escape (though I loved the Doctor's line ""I'm going to step into this police box and arrest myself.""), but just stop after he's told about his death & you have a perfect episode.  A+

Waters of Mars:  Mars, 2059.  Bowie Base One.  Last recorded message:  ""Don't drink the water.  Don't even touch it.  Not one drop.""  This was a surprisingly powerful episode.  A+

The End of Time:  On Christmas Eve the Doctor is reunited with Wilf (Donna's grandfather), to face the return of an old enemy.  But the Master pales in comparison to the greatest threat of all - the return of the Time Lords!  This is the best regeneration story I've seen, apart from possibly the Caves of Androzani.  A couple nitpicks though.  The Doctor's tantrum at having to die when he struggles to decide whether to save Wilf or not was out of character for me, & as usual I hated the bit with Captain Jack, but apart from those 2 scenes this was perfect.  The story was interesting & epic.  We learn why the Master has been crazy all this time & we get a good end to his story.  The scenes of the Doctor visiting his companions were all wonderful, except for the aforementioned scene with Captain Jack.  The Ood singing the Doctor to sleep was one of the saddest, most beautiful things I've ever seen on television.  And of course to top it all off the Eleventh Doctor gets a great entrance.  All in all this is really good.  A+

Farewell David Tennant.  You were truly the greatest Doctor.  Matt Smith is doing his part in following in your footsteps; it's just that he needs better stories to go along with his great acting.  Here's hoping Series 7 gets back to the quality of the first 5 series after Amy & Rory leave.",1379808000,,2976,4.533962264150944
3983309,5,B002SZQC7K,"This is really a short ""Season Five"" for the David Tennant incarnation of the Doctor, and the end of both Tennant's and Russell Davies run with the show. The writing for these specials, especially ""The Waters of Mars,"" is a high point for the series, with mature development of character and themes such as the Doctor's interference in the time line. Tennant is more serious in some of these episodes than he has been in seasons 3 and 4, and we see the acting quality that he brings to his non-Doctor Who roles (such as his brilliant turn in the RSC Hamlet production).

If you skip this set of specials and move straight from season 4 to season 5, you'll miss a very important story arc that leads to the end of the 10th doctor and the regeneration into the 11th doctor.

3983310,4,B002SZQC7K,"What more can I say about the 10th Doctor's Specials that hasn't already been said.  They're great.  The problem I have and this has been a major problem with all of my Doctor Who Blu-ray sets (and I own every Blu-ray for modern Doctor Who available) is that the audio tracks are really screwed up when played through my Onkyo receiver.

It's obviously a codec issue but what happens is that the DTS HD HR (not tobe confused with the lossless MA) audio randomly drops in and out on and either completely disappears or you can only hear certain channels.  Although I had the random dropout issues on my other DW sets, the solution to that was to simply to change the audio output on the PS3 from bitsream to linear PCM. This results in no change in audio quality with the only difference really being that the display on the receiver shows ""Multichannel"" instead of ""DTS HD HR.""

With this set, however, that doesn't work and the discs become impossible to enjoy.  I have done all of my updates and I have tried connecting different Blu-ray players to the receiver with no change and I must not that out of the 400 Blu-ray titles I own, the DW titles are the only ones I've ever had a problem with.",1378512000,3,1197,4.418181818181818

3983321,5,B002SZQC7K,"To help with the transition as the show would shift majorly in production teams, Russell T. Davies took Doctor Who off for a year. Instead of releasing a regular, thirteen episode season, four specials were aired instead over the course of a year. These followed various journeys of the Doctor after he left Donna, unable to have another companion due to the emotional pain of removing her memory. Meanwhile, just as in the regular seasons, a bit of a myth arc occurs when a mysterious prophecy is given to the Doctor: ""it is returning"" and ""he will knock four times"" are threads that weave through the specials, leading to David Tennant's swan song, ""The End of Time.""

As a complete package, the Specials are all worthy additions to Doctor Who. Each one stands on its own as a worthy episode of television, and as a whole, they provide David Tennant some valuable chances to stretch his skills and flesh out the Tenth Doctor before his inevitable regeneration into the Eleventh Doctor. For the purposes of this review, however, each special will be looked at individually, rather than as a collection, because they all stand on their own, despite the small thread tying them together.

The first of these, the Christmas special of 2008, is ""The Next Doctor."" The Doctor travels to Christmas Eve, 1851, in London, where he runs into a man who calls himself the Doctor (David Morrissey) as well, while traveling with what appears to be a companion named Rosita (Valile Tshabalala), who is in pursuit of the Cybermen. Believing he has found his next reincarnation, the Doctor tags along to find clues as to if this really is his next incarnation, or someone with a serious identity issue.

""The Next Doctor"" is an excellent special. Morrissey shines as this ""Doctor"", and although he would inevitably turn out to not be the next incarnation, he still could easily have turned out that way. He exudes all the right personality for the Doctor, and Rosita's character works well as a possible companion (although her similarities to all of the Doctor's three female companions is not missed, either). Seeing the Doctor work with him is a delight to watch, as well. Although this ""Doctor's"" story is a bittersweet one, it still provides for an overall fun and enjoyable special.

The second to come is ""Planet of the Dead"". In this Easter special, the Doctor boards a bus only to find it drive right through a wormhole and end up on another planet, one that appears to be covered in sand. One of the fellow passengers is Christina (Michelle Ryan), a charismatic and skilled thief who wound up on the bus running away from the cops. She joins forces with the Doctor as a temporary companion in hopes to find a way back through the wormhole and safe from this planet, where something slowly approaches the stranded passengers.

Ryan is an absolute delight as Christina. Her character is spunky, skilled, adventurous, and even sexy. She has all the right traits to make her an interesting companion for the Doctor, albeit a temporary one. It would have been great to see her character become an actual companion, her chemistry with Tennant is that high. Her character alone makes ""Planet of the Dead"", although that isn't all the special has going for it. The plot is interesting, and the plot twist of what the planet and the swarm are come as quite a shock and make the story that much more interesting. Just as with the regular episodes, the human element also makes this special engaging. The passengers of the 200 bus all work together and form a very likeable cast, whose ultimate triumph is that much more powerful because of their likeability. Overall, this is an enjoyable special, and one that shouldn't be missed (note: this special does not actually exist on Netflix, which is where a lot of people watch the show; you will have to rent or purchase the DVD to see it if viewing the show by Netflix).

The third special, and the best, is ""The Waters of Mars"". The Doctor finds himself on Mars in the year 2059, on November 21st. He investigates a nearby base to find a crew working there, studying the planet for a possibility of habitation by humans. The crew is led by Adelaide Brooke (Lindsay Duncan), a strong leader and inspired woman. However, the Doctor has heard of the crew before, who are all set to die on the very day he arrives. The Doctor stays to investigate what the cause of their death is, which appears to be a strange virus found in the water.

""The Waters of Mars"" stands as best of the specials for several reasons. The plot is strongly thematic, providing a great moral quandary for the Doctor: he knows these people are going to die, and he has to make the hard decision to let them die, even as he gets closer to these people and begins to see their deaths occur. The viewers' knowledge of the events to come provides a sense of foreboding over the entire special, one that tunes us in with the heartbreak the Doctor goes through as he waits for the inevitable. This also creates some of the most memorable moments for the Doctor as he makes the decisions he feels he needs to, and a moment near the end truly affects his character (if only this occurred sooner, and we could see the impact it had). This is complimented by one of Tennant's best performances as the Doctor, and Duncan rounds out the superb acting as Adelaide Brooke. Every crew member is also likeable and relatable, making their demises all the more heartbreaking when they occur. On top of that, the antagonist of this special, the virus in the water, is a scary threat that haunts throughout the episode. ""The Waters of Mars"" truly stands at the top of the list for Doctor Who episodes.

Lastly comes ""The End of Time"", a two-part special that aired during the Christmas and New Years season. This special provides a good-bye to the Tenth Doctor as well as Russell T. Davies, who would retire from the show and hand it over to Steven Moffat. The Master (John Simm) is back from the dead, but something has gone wrong. He is not the same he once was, now a mad man (or at least, more so than he was) who has lost much of his sanity and still clings to the sound of drums that has infected him since childhood. The Doctor discovers that he is back, and that something else is returning. After realizing that his fate is still bound to Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins), the grandfather of Donna, he works with Wilfred to put a stop to any possible plans of the Master, and soon discovers what is returning.

""The End of Time"" is not a bad special by any means. In fact, it provides more great characterization to the Master as well as his relationship to the Doctor. Not to mention, the Tenth Doctor's death and regeneration into his eleventh incarnation is still a powerful experience and an emotional one. The major problem with ""The End of Time"" lies with its somewhat underwhelming and disappointing nature. It doesn't feel quite like the fitting conclusion to four seasons of Russell T. Davies' revived series or to the three seasons of David Tennant's portrayal of the Tenth Doctor. ""Journey's End"", with it's great character developments, huge cast of characters brought back (every companion from the first four revived seasons as well as Torchwood and Sarah Jane Adventures cast), and epic storyline felt like a definite conclusion to an era in ways ""The End of Time"" just doesn't. The Master and the ""returning"" antagonists feel somewhat under-utilized and just lack the impact that was expected for the finale. That's not to say they aren't a big reveal (because they are), but they just don't feel as engaging or powerful as hoped. They wind up just feeling underwhelming in nature and don't really impact the story that much (they pop up, some exposition goes down, and they just disappear). The problem really lies in the format. ""Journey's End"" focused on the companions, and ""The End of Time"" focuses on the Doctor and his past, which is intended to stay mysterious and unknown.

However, ""The End of Time"" still has its strengths. What it does provide for antagonists are still well-developed and interesting. Simm's portrayal of the Master gone mad is chilling in many ways, and his character has some great scenes during the special. The ultimate antagonists are fairly threatening as well and provide some great fleshing out of the Doctor's past actions and his ultimate pacifism, partially through their own militancy. The only villains that are really bad are Joshua Naismith and Abigail Naismith. This father and daughter duo don't amount to much, especially when hyped to be important, and their motivations are really not that interesting, or even fleshed out. They mostly act as human McGuffins: they get the action moving then just sit there for the rest of the special. Wilfred Mott, however, is just as great as he was during the regular season. His character is fun, likeable, and gets fleshed out more in the special, providing some nice and new knowledge for his character. His inclusion as a companion is a nice one. However, the inevitable return of Donna due to his inclusion is also somewhat underwhelming and disappointing. Her character doesn't really fulfill on anything promised, and gets some really awkward inclusion into the special.

However, of special note, is ""The End of Time""'s stellar production. Many effects go into play in this special, all benefiting it. The skeleton that we keep seeing of the Master is as scary as it's meant to be, and his new found powers are well implemented. Several of the set pieces, especially those in Part 2, are beautiful to see and a wonder to marvel at. ""The End of Time's"" soundtrack is phenomenal as well, mixing in the sound of drums to great effect in many places and bring some much needed energy to a slightly disappointing special.

Overall, the 2009 Specials are a nice package. There are several great moments scattered throughout, and not one episode is bad, even if the most important special is somewhat disappointing. For a Doctor Who fan, though, these are an important part of the collection, as these specials are an integral part of the series, providing a few last adventures for the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, and a few last moments for the brilliance of Russell T. Davies and his helming of Doctor Who to shine.",1376179200,,10312,4.729143492769744

I have all of the sets for the new series with all 3 of the new Doctors. All of David's work as Dr. Who is excellent. And of the majority of his series I must say I really like these. His personality shines in these specials. For the most part he is alone and you can feel that in his portrayal of the Doctor during these episodes.

As I stated earlier, I have been a fan of the show for a long time. I have more than enjoyed all the new shows. However Mr. Tennant stands out as the Doctor and really brings the complexities of the man out. The character shines.

3983337,2,B002SZQC7K,"Oh man. First off, don't blame David Tennant for the atrocity that is the specials. His performances have never been less than astounding, and even though before these specials he's had a few less then stellar scripts, he does a great job given what he had to work with. With Whovians, you either love Russell T. Davies or Steven Moffat, you're not allowed to like both. Thing is, I do like both (at least only for the seasons of Doctor Who, not that Torchwood garbage), and Davies even turned in the best episode of Tennant's tenure: ""Midnight"", the psychodrama that takes place on a train. So what exactly happened with these specials? Especially as series 4 was so good and maybe even best yet?

I guess you can't place the blame entirely on Davies either. He wanted to leave at series 4's end, but they wanted more out of him, so these ""specials"" (and I use that word loosely) were done as a compromise. But man, by the time ""The End of Time"" Part 2 was over, I was glad he was gone, and even though I'm only a new Whovian (I started with Eccleston at the beginning of January and am now entirely caught up), I can already say that Moffat runs circles around him in terms of scripts. Sure, Moffat can be a tad pretentious at times (if just slightly, it rarely ever shows), I'd take pretentious over the lowest common denominator scripts that Davies provided for thes specials.

There are four specials here, and only one of them I enjoyed: ""The Waters of Mars"". That episode at times recalls ""Midnight""; Davies' good eye for suspense is front in center and at times the episode is ever so pretty looking. Yep, I'm shallow like that. But the Doctor ends up on Mars and because he read it on TARDIS-Wikipedia or something that effect, he's in danger of water-spewing zombies created by a virus. It's actually worth watching in its entirety; even though the main conflict ends too quickly. ""Planet of the Dead"" is ever- so DULL. I literally can't remember what happened in the episode, except a desert planet with a bunch of people trapped on a bus with The Doctor. Alright, skip to the last ten minutes. I remember them quite well. ""The Next Doctor"" is half good; it takes place in Victorian London, with some guy considered to be ""the next doctor"". But don't get your hopes up. It's a cop-out; it's just some guy who thinks he's The Doctor. Watch the first half, then make up your own second half.

And then the two-part ""End of Time"", SKIP BOTH OF THEM. Alright, I'm being a little dramatic there; they're mostly crap, and there's nothing you need to know until the last ten minutes of the episode, where The Doctor regenerates. Some tear-jerking acting by Tennant in that scene, and a hilarious and heartwarming introduction to the ever so charming and suave Eleventh Doctor played by Matt Smith. But other than that, well, NOTHING HAPPENS. Some ridiculous plot involving a cult revivng The Master, The Master turning everyone into clones of him, some cactus race, banging drums or whatever. Oh, and The Doctor turns into some emo kid who spends the whole second episode bitching and whining and angsting. There is literally a scene where he tries to kill himself, but fails, and breaks down in an over-the-top crying fit. Again, not Tennant's fault. But The Doctor constantly says whiny and emo things like ""Time Lords' lifespans are too long!!!!"". Please, Doctor. Spare us the theatrics, go start your own emo band.

Overall, there's one of four specials that is worth watching. The other four range from meh to garbage, and either way, Tennant (and the tenth doctor) deserved a better bow-out. Thanks to these specials, while the Tenth is still my favourite Doctor, I'm glad he's gone, in fact I'm really enjoying Smith as Doctor Eleven, who is the most charming, suave and upbeat Doctor yet (though he was rather mean and condescending in the first few episodes). Moffat seems to be really nailing it and the series has taken an upward flight in terms of quality. Otherwise, skp these specials. There is nothing you need to know in The End of Time except for The Doctor regenerates.

Though, to be fair, at least it's better than Torchwood.",1362009600,2,4149,4.654843110504775

The picture is superb, and if you have a decent surround sound setup of powerful enough speakers your walls will probably shake with some of the effects and the musical score.  Only way they could have made the set better would have been to include his Christmas specials as well, though I don't think they were ever shot in high-def so they may have lost something in the conversion process like many other things seem to if they had tried.",1360972800,,624,4.464912280701754
3983340,5,B002SZQC7K,"Finally out on Blu-ray, the Doctor Who Complete Specials are the final special episodes of David Tennant's run as The Doctor.  The first three specials - The Next Doctor, Planet of the Dead, and the Waters of Mars - prepare the stage for the Tenth's finale in The End of Time.  Each special has somewhat of it's own theme; the inevitability of death and regeneration (The Next Doctor); the Doctor's relationship with companions and the effect that it has on them when they leave (Planet of the Dead); what the Doctor is capable of when left on his own, without a companion to temper the fury of a Time Lord.  They are themes that have played throughout the series, especially the need of the Doctor to have a companion and what he might do without one.

The finale - The End of Time - brings the Doctor face to face with an old adversary, with an even greater threat coming.  It pushes him to his absolute limits, and forces the Doctor to face his own death as a man with nothing to lose.  The climax of the film is gripping, and the ending poignant as the Doctor says his final goodbye.

Each of the specials has its own disc, and the set is loaded with extras, including audio commentary, deleted scenes, the Doctor Who Confidentials, etc.

If you don't own any of the David Tennant specials, then this is the perfect set.",1360627200,,1324,4.4421487603305785

My least favorite was ""Planet Of The Dead"". I just couldn't warm to Lady Christina as a companion nor as a character... a smarmy smart@rse I can do without, much the same as Catherine Tate who totally ruined series 4 with her obnoxious Donna Noble character. Tate appears in the final 2-parter here and, although I was put off by her and her annoying grandfather, the delicious eccentricity of John Simm as The Master, the menace of Timothy Dalton as #1 Time Lord and the wonderful David Tennant as The Doctor more than made up for the belligerent squawking of Donna Noble. ""Waters Of Mars"" by far the superior story here... but all episodes have their points of interest and there is seldom a dull moment.

The Master returns, we get a surprising glimpse of Gallifrey that those unfamiliar with the original ""Who"" have never seen before, and the Doctor bids a final farewell to his friends. (And ""Waters of Mars"" is, in my opinion, one of the most perfect stories ever told, albeit heartbreaking now due to the how unlikely it is that we will achieve the future depicted in the time allotted. But that's beside the point, which is: watch and revel.)

3983366,5,B002SZQC7K,"* DISC ONE: The Next Doctor...
Very good story.  Kinda hokey, at times.  The backstory was a little rough around the edges.  The Cyber King's 'transport device' looked like it came off of the movie set of either The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen (Sean Connery) or Wild Wild West (Will Smith).  NOTE: I loved both of those movies.  Having both Doctors not recognize each other was a situation that begged for an explanation and we weren't forced to wait too long.  That explanation was delivered with an unexpected twist, of course.

* DISC TWO: Planet of the Dead...
Another very good story.  The baddies were cool, even if we never learned whether they were sentient (thus evil) or hive-like (simply 'misunderstood').  Funny note...in real life, the bus got severely damaged while in transit to the filming location.  Rather than ship a second bus, the writers/crew/cast used the broken one but added a line or two of dialogue to explain its scruffiness.

* DISC THREE: The Waters of Mars...
Pretty Good story.  Loved the concept.  Seemed to be directed well.  Buuut, kinda lost its pizzazz somewhere in editing.  And on a technical note: Mars has much lower gravity than Earth (one-sixth), but there was no explanation about why the Mars-bound characters had Earth-type gravity on a planet the size of Earth's moon.  Even if they had a gravity-field generator, which all Sci-Fi shows do, that doesn't explain why the Doctor enjoyed full-on 1G when he made the long walk from the TARDIS to the humans' base.

* DISC FOUR & FIVE: The End of Time, part 1 & 2...
Wow!  Just...wow!...in a good way, of course!!  Lots of action, time-play, life-n-death moments, Time Lord meddling (Timothy Dalton), old faces revisited, and of course regular folks (a/k/a victims).  Because I had a damaged DVD (explained below), I missed a few important facts from the end of part 1.  Even so, the show was awesome!

I'm a little miffed at Amazon.com because disc four has 2 really bad scratches.  They happened because the disc rubbed/pressed up against another DVD in the same case.  Because of that, I missed 'Part One' from the 45-minute point onward.  Roughly the last 15-20 minutes had to be endured in an infuriating self-stopping/starting/pausing mode that was also chock full of horrendous pixelations and countless soundtrack/picture mismatches.  PLUS...large gaps of unseen/unseeable footage.  I tried it in 3 different DVD players, including my laptop's, so it's definitely the DVD that's bad.  Thankfully, Amazon.com has an awesome replacement policy!!!!

And the End of Time(Pt 1 and 2)... with the return of the Master, the Doctor must choose. In perfect symmetry of the 10th Doctor's character, he must give up everything for the sake of goodness.

I decided to give it a try and of course, I LOVED it.  I liked Christopher Eccleston (sp?) as the 9th Doctor and was actually disappointed at the end of the first season when he regenerated into David Tennant ... that disappointment lasted all of two minutes, lol.  David is simply BRILLIANT as the Doctor!  Because of him, I purchased seasons 2-4 (I already had season 1).  Then I read that he had left the series. :(  But I heard about these specials...

Now I'm not going to give out any spoilers here since I'm not good at that anyway. ;)  So I will just say that this set of specials are wonderful.  I loved each of them.

Planet of the Dead was awesome.  I'll just leave it at that.  And if DT had stayed, I think Michelle Ryan should have been considered to be the next companion.  She's wonderful and can definitely hold her own.

Water of Mars is just full of intense moments and emotional moments.  You really see the Doctor in rare form here, but it's interesting to see him like this.

End of Time 1 & 2 ... What can I say except I needed a box of kleenex by the end.  These two episodes were amazing and the Timothy Dalton cameo was nice to see.  I will say that I was truly surprised with the ending (not the regeneration).  It was also nice to see characters from past seasons, even if it was only for a moment.

The video diaries are wonderful.  I love all of David's video diaries.

Loved the concert!  The music was beautiful.  Murray Gold is a true genius.  I think 'This is Gallifrey' is my favorite piece, followed closely by 'Rose's Theme' (even though it makes me cry every time I hear it).

As far as the extras on the DVDs go, I have read from several other reviewers that they did not like the fact that there was only audio commentary for End of Time 1 & 2.  I would have loved to have commentary on all of the specials, but the fact that there are FULL DW Confidentals (not the cut-down ones we get on the box sets) is a HUGE plus for me.

I would recommend this set of DVDs to anyone who is a fan of Doctor Who and/or David Tennant.  I definitely miss seeing him on the show.  Matt Smith is great, don't get me wrong.  I have just always thought of David as MY Doctor; hence the title of my review. :)",1313884800,2,2360,4.1662971175166295

But the Waters of Mars and then the End of Time brings the David Tennant story lines to a stunning conclusion.  The End of Time resolves the clash between the Doctor and the Master from Series Three and really is the climax of David's work with this show.  Even if you didn't follow the previous seasons this collection is a good start to dive into Dr. Who.

I don't know if it's a problem where these won't play on just Samsung players, or if this is widespread, but I really wanted these to work. Instead I've had to send back the Blu Ray set and I guess I'll have to settle for DVDs of the Specials instead.

He adds an emotional side that hasn't been seen in previous seasons to pull you to him more than ever.  Answers to other questions that we've always wondered. Doctor Who Confidential holds just as much pull too, due to it's more candid takes from everyone who has been involved in this Collection knowing that this was a final season for David Tennant as the Doctor. Wonderful guest actors who push the dramatic side even further as an extra gift for this collection. There is a funny side for added comic releaf that we love to see with the Doctor in selected pieces and to lighten things some for the kids who also admire the Doctor as their Hero. It give charm and sentimental wanting, to not see the Doctor go, but a wonderful farewell for David Tennant and his version of the Doctor, to seal the fates that have always been in Doctor Who fans minds.  We will miss this Doctor, who has been one of the best versions of the Doctor in many years!  David Tennant was exceptional in his perfomance for all of us to love and keep in our hearts for generations to come. Great actor and a great completion to a Fantastically Wonderful 4 year run!

So I went looking for a hardcopy of it, and was torn between getting this ""Complete Specials"" on bluray, or just the standalone discs for End Of Time (on dvd).

Decided to get this instead. I must say, getting to rewatch the other specials in 1080 bluray was worth the difference in cost (compared to netflix), even ontop of getting to see what I consider one of David Tennant's finest (and sadly last :() performances in spectacular detail.

The extras for the specials, plus some ""last days"" vidoc diaries by Tennant are a real treat for any Doctor Who fan (something that is lost on streaming services)",1296000000,2,785,4.560283687943262
3983381,5,B002SZQC7K,"I love this set.  As one of the few Americans without cable, I was unable to watch them as they were released.  I still can't watch Dr. Who as it shows in America.  That said, when the first discs were released, I almost bought them.  The reviews kept me from making those purchases and I'm glad I waited.  This set, while much shorter that the previous ""series"" sets, is so much more complete.  It offers special features on each disc as well as the Dr. Who confidential.  I am partial to David Tennant as the Doctor, so this set is a little sad if only because it marks the end of his era as the Doctor.  However, the acting is just as good through these programs as it was before.  He does a wonderful job as the Doctor, making these programs rewatchable. In other words, I would watch these again just as much as I watch the other episodes again.  For me, it's when ever I need a Who fix.  If there is a downside, it's more with the writing than the acting.  The lack of a constant companion was rather out of character in my opinion, although, they did handle that issue.  I still felt like he should have had someone with him at the end.  I don't recall the Doctor ever regenerating alone before.  Over all, I definitely give this 5 stars.  I really enjoyed it.

3983389,5,B002SZQC7K,"While there are legitimate concerns about packaging and the extras, it's difficult for me to really complain, simply because I found the stories in the collection to be worth the money.  David Tennant has become one of the most beloved incarnations of the Doctor, and his send-off is suitably dramatic.  The specials take the Doctor through a roller coaster of emotions, and for the first time we truly get to see the Doctor at his darkest.  It's both exhilarating and frightening (as the Doctor should be) and it helps to balance the disappointment of knowing that this is the last of Tennant we'll see in the role.  This is partly because it's a satisfying conclusion and partly because the events that transpire force the Doctor to become something that viewers understand is a bit of something twisted--a character arc that comes full circle in the two-part finale.  These are dark episodes, bittersweet and powerful, and Tennant's acting ability is impressive.  For the first time, we see him manipulate the world to his own liking, and it provides a sense of the necessity of the regeneration.  At the end, Tennant's doctor, for all of his fear of being left behind, manages to convey the impossibility of following this path.  He's tired, he's a little broken, and he's losing his way, and a fresh incarnation manages to be almost a relief, as I was left with a sense that I would rather see him regenerate than self-destruct.

That doesn't mean that the last three episodes don't leave you with a bit of a broken heart to see Tennant go, but it's the kind of ending that dazzles.  As much as I loved the Parting of the Ways, I really appreciated being able to see the emotions and tribulations of a regeneration in more depth, and to witness his attempt to say his farewells was lovely.  And frankly, I needed the opportunity to wallow.",1289520000,35,1844,4.713395638629284
3983390,2,B002SZQC7K,"I, like most Whovians, was more than just a little disappointed that there would only be five special episodes of Doctor Who produced in 2009, instead of a full season of thirteen episodes. But by the end of the year, with 2010 and a new Doctor right around the corner, it finally registered just how disappointing the year had been.

The first special, ""The Next Doctor,"" teases the audience with a glimpse of the next Doctor, however, (spoilers ahead!) it's just a cop-out, as the so-called ""next Doctor"" is simply a man who thinks he's the Doctor. It's still a fun little romp through Victorian London with the Doctor and his addled would-be doppelganger facing off against the Cybermen, at least for the first half or so, before leading into a climax involving a giant Cyberman that was so ridiculous that Steven Moffat had to explicitly retcon it away in Series 5. Watch the first half-hour, turn it off, and make up your own ending.

The second special, ""Planet of the Dead,"" is dull and boring, featuring a bunch of flat characters trapped on a bus with the Doctor in the middle of a desert planet. The Doctor must get the bus and its passengers back to Earth before a swarm of space-locusts devour them. Although it has a few nice little bits with UNIT near the end, don't even waste your time with this one. Skip the whole thing and just imagine a better Easter special instead.

""The Waters of Mars"" is a sharp turn from the previous specials, in that it's actually worth watching in its entirety. The Doctor finds himself on Mars and encounters a doomed interplanetary expedition. How does he know it's doomed? Because he read it on future-Wikipedia or something. While the base is terrorized by a virulent microscopic organism that turns its hosts into water-spewing zombies, the Doctor has to grapple with the tough decision of whether he has the right to change the outcome of a supposedly-fixed event in history. The climax, in which the Doctor goes mad with power after saving the crew of the expedition, is absolutely gripping, though resolved far too quickly. Overall, this special made me feel excited for the upcoming ""End of Time"" special...

...which was garbage. The Master is resurrected by a nefarious cult, but things go horribly wrong and he's left as a deranged shadow of his former self who can shoot lightning out of his hands like Emperor Palpatine, leap tall quarries in a single bound, and chew both scenery and people. (Yeah, he eats people now. Roger Delgado is spinning in his grave.) The Doctor teams up with Wilfred Noble and comes face to face with the Master, the Time Lords (led by a rejuvenated, scenery-chomping Rassilon), and with his own mortality in a jumbled mess of a two-parter. The writing feels first-draft quality at best, and we go from setpiece to setpiece with no logical progression. Even with saliva-spewing Rassilon and Super Saiyan Master (among other disasters), this turd would have been so much better if it had been more polished. Watch every scene with the Doctor and Wilfred for some touching character moments, then fast-forward straight to the Tenth Doctor's moving (if a bit on the long side) regeneration scene and the subsequent first appearance of Matt Smith as the new Doctor. Just use your imagination for everything in between, as anything you imagine would undoubtedly end up better than what actually happened.

David Tennant does his best with what he's given to work with and is fantastic as always (he will be sorely missed, and I eagerly await the next multi-Doctor reunion special), but this collection clearly shows that head writer Russel T. Davies had worn out his welcome by the end. Avoid wasting money on this set, unless you just have to have a complete collection of NuWho.",1289174400,10,3762,4.799382716049383

3983392,5,B002SZQC7K,"Writing this is a sad day, because of course, we have all lost David Tennant as Dr. Who.  Now I haven't yet seen the new Matt Smith Dr. Who, but I have to say, Tennant was THE DR. as far as I am concerned.  A definitive as it was for Tom Baker back in the day.

These specials are bitter-sweet as far as being an audience member.  The Dr. is alone for pretty much the first time.  There is alot of loss, and alot of gain.  Without giving the stories away, suffice it to say that it's a bang-on finish for the best Dr. Who ever.  We have watched these specials repeatedly, and they never cease to amaze.  The writing, the filming, every detail is exceptional.  However: one thing: KLEENEX Warning if you are the least bit fond of Dr. Who, and especially Mr. Tennant's portrayal.  It's never easy to say goodbye.  Also, be sure to watch the extra features, not the least of which is Tennant's video diary of the 'last days'.

Tennant is a true artist, and I sure hope we see more of him.  If you love Dr. Who, and have watched even partials of Tennant's tenure as the Dr., then you really need to see these specials.",1287100800,5,1114,4.222748815165877

I just watched The Water of Mars with my 7 year old daughter, what a fantastic episode, the monster budget they must have to create a T.V. episode must rival a full length Hollywood movie. From the stunning visual quality to the orchestra music.

3983395,5,B002SZQC7K,"It was inevitable that David Tennant had to leave Doctor Who.  After all, part of the character's history has been the regenerations which allow the character to become another person (As well as allow for the actor playing The Doctor to be replaced).  So the time came for Tennant--wildly popular in the role, and greatly responsible for reenergizing the character--to go, but BBC and Russell T. Davies couldn't evolve Tennant into Matt Smith without a fond and warm farewell.  Which seems the purpose of the five specials.  I don't see the post-series specials--I know some complained that ""The Christmas Invasion"" from Series 2, ""The Runaway Bride"" from Series 3, and ""The Voyage Of The Damned"" from Series 4 weren't in this collection, but those were all more separate one-offs--as standing on their own as much as I saw them as being comparable to the ""Torchwood: Children Of Earth"" mini-series.  To me, the five episodes of this set had the obvious undertone of preparing for the regeneration--""The ending of The Doctor's Song"" as the Ood put it in ""The End Of Time, Part I""--but also (Obviously) wanting to send Tennant out on a heroic and sad note.  This is why--for the most part--David doesn't have a constant Companion throughout these episodes.  These episodes also show that our favorite TimeLord isn't as infallible as we usually believe him to be--otherwise, he would have realized immediately in ""The Two Doctors"" that David Morrisey's ""Doctor"" isn't who/what he assumed him to be (Specifically, a future version of himself).  Or the final sadness of ""The Waters Of Mars"", in which The Doctor chooses to interfere with the time stream...and things do not quite work out the way he believed that they would.
  But overall, this is a fun and good set of episodes in which Tennant gets to say goodbye to a character which made him internationally known (Or at least very well known stateside).  ""The Two Doctors""--which brings back the Cybermen--is a raucous romp, what with Morrissey's ""Doctor"" being there...and not quite being there.
""The Planet Of The Dead"" introduces Michelle Ryan's Lady Christina de Souza--note to Steven Moffatt, here.  Steve, here's a recurring character.  You didn't bring her back in Series 5--fine.  Find a place for her in Series 6, please.  ""The Waters Of Mars"" is notable because of Lindsay Duncan's tortured performance as Adelaide Brooke is heartwrenching...and sets the table for ""The End Of Time"".
  The two-parter that concludes the David Tennant era is as it should be--an epic tale that brings back The Master; and this time, John Simm is brilliantly unhinged...but ends up getting trumped by Timothy Dalton's raging, expectorating Lord President when the TimeLords return to bring Gallifrey--the homeworld of The Doctor and The Master--back into existence.  Bernard Cribbins is wonderful as Wilfred Mott--Donna Noble's grandfather, and the keeper of Donna's experiences with The Doctor.  He is loyal and sees The Doctor as a true hero--even when he becomes responsible for what The Doctor MUST do in the aftermath of (Once again) saving the planet...it is a shame that Catherine Tate feels somewhat wasted in this story, however.  Privately, there have to be a lot of Whophiles out there who somehow and someway want the Donna we had throughout Series 4 back...but it is a nice touch that the way that he met Donna is the way that he leaves Donna--in a wedding dress.
  The last 10 to 15 minutes of ""The End Of Time, Part 2"" are heart-wrenching; what with The Doctor saying good-bye to those he spent the last four-plus years with--Mickey and Martha (Anyone want to bet that we'll see Mr. and Mrs. Smith on ""Torchwood""?).  Luke and Sarah Jane.  Captain Jack and Alonzo Frame (Before anyone mentions Alonzo joining Torchwood, remember that Russell Tovey has ""Being Human"" issues).  Donna, Wilf and Sylvia Noble.
  And finally, Rose.
  In the end, we can't ask Matt Smith to replace or replicate what David Tennant did with his Tenth Doctor.  What we end up asking for is for Matt to add to the legacy of the character...because David CERTAINLY did.",1283299200,4,4100,4.977973568281938
3983396,5,B002SZQC7K,"I became a fan of Doctor Who just recently (I know, I know) and needed to catch up on some of the backstory. This collection was the perfect purchase. First it gives me a chance to see David Tennant's take on the doctor and gives you most of what you need to know leading up to the big finale and the change to Matt Smith's 11th doctor. The stories are very good. As I've explored more in the past of the doctor, it is clear the show is at its best when it focuses on character and that is the strength of two of these episodes in particular: ""The Next Doctor"" and ""Waters of Mars"" are very well done. Plus there is the continuing theme through these episodes of the 10th doctor's pain at the loss of his various companions. I have one pet peeve with the way the BBC ends episodes of Doctor Who and this is particularly apparent on the ""Waters of Mars"" episode. The BBC doesn't give you even a second to linger over the touching ending of this episode before the jarring previews of coming attactions pop up on the screen. That happened in the current season as well. Knock it off BBC. I'm watching a DVD, it is not like I'll change channels if you gave me two seconds of silence at the end of a dramatic story before some announcer shouts ""On the next Doctor Who.....""

The extras that come with the specials are good. The Doctor Who Confidential series is helpful if you are a newcomer to the doctor and probably still has value for life long fans. I particularly enjoyed the Doctor Who Proms. I've always enjoyed the Proms whenever we've gotten to see them here in the US, and a Doctor Who Prom was a special treat.",1280880000,,1618,4.287581699346405

3983406,5,B002SZQC7K,"I must say that I never thought I would be so into another actor playing the Doctor other than Peter Davison (Doctor #5) - but - as fate would have it - David Tennant (Doctor #10) took over the role in 2006 after an amazing performance by Christopher Ecclston in 2005 (Doctor #9) - and David became my modern favorite Doctor!

(Granted I have only seen 6 episodes of the NEW Matt Smith (Doctor #11) so I am still getting used to this new regeneration as of yet.)

This Blu-Ray combo pack is amazing. Tons of extras including the Doctor WHo Confidential which is a detailed and inventive inside look into the production of each episode - and my favorite - David Tennants very own Video Diaries. What great perspective from the actual star of the show - shot in the hand-held style by the star of the show - with invasive and often humorous points-of-view from the star of the show himself!

Also included is the magical Doctor Who concert ""At The Proms"" that was held in England where a 100 + piece orchestra is conducted by Doctor Who's very own composer Murray Gold - playing his own compositions for the series. Complete with a story film and shot by David Tennant as he teases you into music he wrote and found in some odd galaxy. Characters from the actual show come running through the audience. Great fun too!

This set contains all four (five really - one two-parter)'Specials' as the British BBC production team called them - of what I would consider calling 'Series 5' of the relaunching of the new Doctor Who and his TARDIS. The stories are; #1 The Next Doctor, #2 Planet of the Dead, #3 The Waters of Mars and #4 The End of Time (Parts 1 and 2).

All these beautifully mastered HD episodes tell the unravelling of what will be the end of the Tenth Doctor's run. For five years Mr. Tenant has helmed the TARDIS with some of the most memorable, fun and interesting 'one-adventure' companions ever. They include Michelle Ryan (the US remake of the Bionic Woman), David Morrissey (State of Play, Sense and Sensibility) and Lindsay Duncan (the new Alice in Wonderland, Rome, Under the Tuscan Sun)

Each of the stories has athread that leads up to the ultimate series finale - the exit of David Tennant. Russell T. Davies amazing story telling and Julie Gardners amazing producing skills have created four of the wittiest and sharpest episodes of all time!

A must for ever Doctor Who Fan and a great introductory gift for someone who likes action, adventure, comedy in the Science Fiction genre. Add this to your collection too!  6-9-10",1276041600,4,2542,4.596026490066225

3983408,5,B002SZQC7K,"I love me some Doctor Who, and the specials are awesome. Each special has a slightly different feel, running the gamut from deeply personal to fun and action-packed to scary to all of the above plus epic. That said, if you're not already a Whovian, I wouldn't start with these. I'd suggest starting either with Series 1, featuring Christopher Eccleston, or series 5, the current one, wherein Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, and Steven Moffat have taken over, and are doing a brilliant job. Then go back and watch S1, because the Ninth Doc is wonderful.

The box art is rather nice, with lots of Daves on it. Each episode and its special features are on one disc, making five discs in all. Each story has its own custom DVD menu; the End of Time's is the Immortality Gate, for instance, while Planet of the Dead uses the double-decker bus. Each episode's corresponding episode of Doctor Who Confidential is on the disc with it. David Tennant's video diaries are also included, which is lovely, except that the end made me cry, since it details everything that happened as he was leaving, and it's pretty obvious he has a huge emotional attachment to the show. *sniffle* There's also commentary on each episode. My favorite is the commentary on Part 2 of the End of Time, because John Simm is really amusing. They've also included footage from when Doctor Who went to Comic-Con 09, including the (in)famous John Barrowman/David Tennant kiss. There are more special features, I just can't think what they are right now and I don't have time to go and check.

Basically, if you're a Who fan, you need these. They're good fun, so what more could you ask for? And also, they're Ten's final stories. You have to have them. You do.",1274572800,,1717,4.663366336633663

""Waters of Mars"" was one of the scariest and best ""Doctor Who"" stories written by Russel T. Davies, in the same league as ""Midnight"".  The first part of ""The End of Time"" was a bit slow, while part 2 was quite engaging.

One really enjoyable thing about the Blu Ray format is being able to see ""Doctor Who"" in HD for the first time.  Quite a change from the cheap cheesiness of the '70's Tom Baker episodes that first got me to love the show.  My one complaint about the Blu Ray set is that it is a bit light on extra features compared with the DVD sets for Series 1-4.",1272931200,,715,4.338345864661654

3983416,5,B002SZQC7K,"I wasn't at all sure I would like David Tennant as the Doctor after Christopher Eccleston, but in the last 3 years he has made his way into my ""hearts"".  From ""Christmas Invasion"" to ""The End of Time"", he has evoked emotion and laughter.  He showed incredible talent as a comedic actor when possessed by ""Cassandra"" in Series 2's ""New Earth"", then the complete emotional breakdown in series 3's ""Human Nature"".  Each story grabbed my heart, but the final joy came when in ""Journey's End"", I could accutally see how the TARDIS was supposed to be flown and that it was being flown by the Doctor's ""family"".

I thought ""The Next Doctor"" was wonderful with David Morrissey's pain and David Tennant's sincere compassion as the two sorted out Morrissey's pain while overcoming the Cyberman invasion.  This is an incredible episode, very satisfying.

""The Planet of the Dead"" is a pretty good episode.  It shows what the Doctor does best.  He thinks on his feet and solves the problem in a somewhat logical matter.  As Michelle Ryan's ""Lady Christina"" says ""...you are the brain box, so start boxing.""  What made the episode complete was the comedic banter between Tennant and comedic actor Lee Evans.  In the process of solving the problem Evans' ""Malcolm"" and the ""Doctor"" become ""best friends"".  The ending when the Doctor refuses to allow Christina to travel with him shows how emotionally tired he really is.  As he tells Christina, he loses all of his companions.

""The Waters of Mars"" takes us back to the ""behind the couch"" era, humans infected by alien parasites turning into monsters.  The most important part comes at the end wirh rhe Doctors crisis of ""faith"".

""The End of Time"" pts 1 and 2 broke my heart.  I knew they were to be David Tennant's last episodes, but nothing prepared me for the depth of writing talent and acting that was involved.  Russell T Davis' writing was superb as always.  I don't think there could ever be another such emotionally charged episode such as this one.  David Tennant's young/old Doctor with Bernerd Cribbins' old Wilfrid Mott was sentimental with a simple father/son affection developing.  The Doctor allowing himself to be taken care of by this old Earth man showed his incredible neediness.  In the end when the Doctor saves Wilf's life at the cost of one of his own it seemed only right.  As the regeneration progresses, the Doctor gets in his TARDIS and for the last time visits several of his companions.  He saves Micky and Martha from a Sontarran attack; Sarah Jane's son, Luke, from an oncoming car and he gives a lonely and dejected Jack Harkness, sitting in an inter-galatic bar, the name of a young man who may or may not fill that emptiness.  He visits Donna's wedding, knowing that only her mother and grandfather, Wilfrid, will know who he is.
Then in the final moment before his transformation he goes to the one place on Earth he felt he belonged, Rose Tyler's ""Powell Estates"".  He watches her celebrate 2005's New Year, knowing that they will meet for the first time later that year in the personna of Chrisopher Eccleston.  Then he heads for his TARDIS accompanied by Ood Sigma who relays the Ood song which spans the Universe. I cried.

Music adds a wonderful feeling to any show, but I have never seen the likes of Murray Gold.  I'm sorry, but even John Williams pales in comparison.

I will give Matt Smith a chance, because the Doctor is one man, a Time Lord, with many different faces, but I will never forget David Tennant's important contributions to the new series.  I will look forward to his other works to come.

I recommend this product, if you hadn't guessed already.",1272067200,12,3643,4.7242472266244055
3983417,5,B002SZQC7K,"I normally watch anything I buy on DVD first on TV or by some other medium to be sure I really want to own it.  With the Doctor, I had been watching it all on SyFy (SciFi channel), but these specials haven't been aired to the best of my knowledge.  So I took a chance and got the set on sale (Yeah Amazon!).  Wow, what a great way to end Tennant's fantastic run.  When they brought the Doctor back with Eccleston, I was impressed.  Wasn't too happy to see him go, but quickly started enjoying the 10th Doctor as much as the 9th.

SPOILERS!!!

The first story threw me for a loop, The Next Doctor.  I admit I was suckered in with the title and expected that to be the next doctor.  It was an early look at the major personality shift in the doctor, that his view point can be persuaded.  Nicely done.

Planet of the Dead was by far my favorite of all the specials.  Michelle Ryan should have been given the status of a companion way earlier.  It was so much fun to watch her and the Doctor playing off of each other with such bravado and quick wit.  IMO, much better than the short lived Bionic Woman show.  It was great seeing UNIT again, even without Martha or the Brigadier, and hopefully we'll see more of Malcolm in the future as well.

Waters of Mars was one of the most eerie shows I've seen in a long time, watching the Doctor walk away as the people were dying, and the major attitude adjustment(s) that came about because of it.  I can honestly say that I've never seen such a sad and joyful turn of events all at once.  Bravo to Tennant for such a remarkable portrayal of the Doctor and giving us a view at the kind of inner torment an Immortal would be possesed of.  If someone is wishing to buy these specials separately, this would the one that I would insist owning just because of the remarkable character development.

And last, but certainly not least, The End of Time.  It took me a bit of thinking to keep up with everything that was going on with the Time Lords, because I was busy looking for all of the references and guest shots, etc.  I was expecting just a bit more of a revelation with Wilfred, his tie with the Time Lords, etc, but another one was knocked out of the park with casting Tim Dalton as Rasalon!  Wow!  He was perfect for it!  And of course the return of the Master.  I really enjoy watching the Doctor and the Master go at it, (don't judge me) even more than the Daleks or Cybermen.  Although his blow up of powers was a bit over the top... it was still quite a treat to see him return.  ""The Master Race!""  Oh my!  My only real dissapointment in the story was not seeing Christopher Eccleston make a cameo at the end to help his successor into the Tardis or some such.  Would have been perfect in my book.

I'm not going to comment on the extras, or lack thereof, as many others have done so.  I will just say that this was a great set of episoded to bid farewell to the memorable 10th Doctor, and hopefully in the future we'll get to see him do a crossover with Matt Smith or in another way.  I really believed that he didn't want to leave the show, with as much emotion as he seemed to pour into it, and it makes me wonder if the story that we were given is correct or not.

3983421,5,B002SZQC7K,"All good things must end. For fans of Doctor Who this was true of the five specials which lead to the end of actor David Tennant's era as theTime Lord known only as the Doctor. Tennant's last five specials represents, in their various ways, what Doctor Who has been since it was revived in 2005: some of the best sci-fi TV in the world.

Kicking things off is The Next Doctor. The Doctor arrives in Christmas 1851 London at where he finds his old enemies the Cybermen but also a man claiming to be a future Doctor himself played wonderfully by David Morrisey (of the BBC's version of State Of Play). The fun of this special is watching the two Doctors at work together throughout and the result: a fun filled hour of action and adventure.

Next up is Planet of the Dead, costarring Michel Ryan (best known here in the States from the Bionic Woman remake). Here the Doctor and a group of people aboard one of London's double-deck buses are transported to a deserted planet. Soon they discover carnivorous stingray looking aliens bent on turning Earth into their new feeding ground. Planet of the Dead becomes rather predictable quickly though it is saved by the performances of Tennant and Ryan. Thankfully this is the only real dud of the five specials.

Waters of Mars, the third special, is one of the finest stories of the New Series. It features what is perhaps Tennant's best performance in the role as the Doctor deals with a crisis on humanity's first Mars colony in 2059. There's fine producton values as well ranging from the truly scary monsters, the realistic colony sets and the ever excellent direction of Graham Harper. Even better is the script by Russel T. Davies and Phil Ford which hits all the right notes of action, horror, suspense and yet asks the question at the heart of any time travel series: if you knew what was to happen and could change it, should you? In short it's a fine example of Doctor Who at its best.

Things end in the two part End Of Time. Following on a warning from the Ood, The Doctor races to the present in an attempt to stop the plans of the evil Time Lord The Master. With the help of Donna's venerable grandad Wilf, he finds events unfolding that even he might be unable to stop. Yet there's more going on as former 007 Timothy Dalton appears as the leader of the long thought dead Time Lords, whose return could spell the end of time itself and even the Doctor's own death. End Of Time is an action filled story that is nonetheless peppered with some strong emotional moments for Tennant and company. With all this, End Of Time sends out Tennant's Doctor before the new Doctor  played by Matt Smith steps in next season.

With stories that  range across time and space, these five specials represent a good cross section of stories from Doctor Who. There also a nice away to for fans new and old to say good-bye to one Doctor and hello to a new one. So farewell Mr. Tennant, you'll be sorely missed, and welcome aboard Mr. Smith!",1271116800,2,2978,4.503703703703704
3983422,4,B002SZQC7K,"I'm a long time fan of Dr. Who, and a huge fan of the new series. I grew up watching the tom Baker and Peter Davison years on PBS back hoe in New Orleans and was trilled with it's return in 2005. These specials, which mark the end of Tenth Doctor David Tennant's reign, are great stuff. Waters of Mars in particular is a tour de force which takes the character to places he has never been while remaining faithful to the entire history of the old and new series that have come before.

Since I have a lot of the classic series as well as the new ones I've gotten spoiled by the exemplary extras 2|Entertain have produced across the board. I'm a fan of commentaries and they have produced some fantastic ones. Unfortunately out of the five specials here on the last two, a two part story featuring the return of The Master, has any commentary at all.

In addition we have yet to see a release of the Confidential in which Matt Smith is introduced as the Eleventh Doctor. That came out well over a year ago.

On the good side we are not getting gypped out of content on the Confidentials as we usually do. Unlike the cropped versions that have come out in the region one season sets these are all the full length episodes broadcast on the BBC.

Then comes the other thing that robs this one of it's fifth star: Five specials on five discs? Honestly, what next? Double-sided discs? It just makes no sense and it is a bit annoying to have to change the DVD after each episode, especially with the two part End of Time.

Good stuff overall, but not quite up to the standards I've come to expect from 2|Entertain. Let us hope they redeem themselves when they release Matt Smith's first season.",1270857600,,1687,4.359872611464968
3983423,5,B002SZQC7K,"In late-2008, David Tennant announced that he would depart from the long-running science-fiction series ""Doctor Who"" after four-plus years as the Tenth Doctor. His three regular seasons on ""Doctor Who"" saw the show reach its highest peak of quality and success. For his final year, he would star in five special episodes that would conclude the Tenth Doctor's journey through time and space. These final specials are packaged here in ""Doctor Who: The Complete Specials."" And they deliver a fun, exciting, and emotionally-charged finale for Tennant.

The set begins with ""The Next Doctor,"" the 2008 Christmas special. It's another fun adventure designed to bring fun family viewing. It's slightly predictable, and kind of wacky, but that's the spirit of the classic series, but does so with great visuals, fine storytelling and terrific performances.

The next episode, ""Planet of the Dead,"" is the 2009 Easter special, where the Doctor and a bus-full of people are swept through a wormhole to a barren planet. While definitely the weaker episode in the bunch, it still delivers fun excitement, though being the first episode shot in High-def, the visual effects workers failed to match it with fine CG effects. But still, it's a fun adventure story, and the end warns the Doctor that his song will end; that something is returning through the dark, and that ""he will knock four times.""

The middle episode, ""The Waters of Mars,"" aired in November 2009. The Doctor lands on Mars in 2059, where creatures who inhabit the Martian water inhabit the human colonists there. But unlike most cases, where the Doctor must save the day, all the crew of Bowie Base One are in a fixed point in time, meaning they all must die. This is by far the scariest adventure of ""Doctor Who,"" but not for the creatures. Here, we see the Doctor gain a scary arrogance, as he saves the crew, breaking the laws of time. The suicide of one of the characters at the end breaks him of it, and he realizes he's gone too far, and knows his end is nigh. While an eerie, thrilling adventure with terrific storytelling and acting, this is one episode not suitable for family viewing because of it's darker tone and ominous conclusion.

Rounding out the set are the definite-best episodes found in this collection: ""The End of Time, Parts One and Two,"" aired on Christmas Day 2009 and New Years' Day 2010. While this two-part adventure has drawn some criticism from fans, I feel it is the best adventure that has come out of the Russell T. Davies' era of Who. In this adventure, the Doctor once again faces his best enemy, the Master, while reuniting with Wilfred Mott, Donna Noble's Granddad, to face the greatest threat of all. It's a hilarious, wacky, and fun adventure in the spirit of the classic series, and pulls out all the stops to give David Tennant a fond farewell. While most of the story is definitely fun, the final twenty minutes, where the Doctor must sacrifice himself to save Wilf, and see all of his friends one last time before he regenerates, will definitely pull at the heart strings of all fans of the show. And though Tennant's departure is very sad, the arrival of Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor is hilarious, and gears us up for the beginning of the next era of the long-running series.

This five-disc set marks the debut of ""Doctor Who"" on Blu-ray, and although the set is a little pricey, it's definitely worth it! The picture quality is fantastic, and the extras are terrific! The one complaint is the audio, with the dialogue slightly drowned out by the music and sound effects. But this is a small problem, and doesn't take away from this amazing set.

Overall, the good Doctor's debut on Blu-ray is terrific, and the five fantastic episodes on this set deliver an excellent farewell for David Tennant as the Doctor. I highly recommend it. Allon-sy!

3983424,5,B002SZQC7K,"David Tennant and Russle T. Davies do not fail to deliver in 2009 with these final 4/5 ""specials"" in High Definition. These episodes are the final journeys of the David Tennant's character, the tenth Doctor as he reconciles the loss of his ""Best Friend"" Donna Noble, who's memories he was forced to erase in order to save her life after she took on the mind of a Time Lord with his need for human companionship. The final episodes depict the internal conflicts that the doctor faces as he travels through space and time without a companion. As with nearly all of the Dr. Who episodes, each special is in itself a fantastic journey which add a critical piece to the overarching storyline, the end of the doctors life or the end of this iteration of the doctor. The 2009 season is concluded in grand fashion as the doctor is again faced with the great burden of being the only remaining Time Lord after ""The Last Great Time War"" as the Time Lords of Gallifrey attempt to break out of the time lock and end all of time. The final episode and the end of his life begins to conclude when he realizes that he must give his life to save the life of his friend Wilfred Mott, Donna's grandfather. The final moments of Tennant's tenure as the doctor are nothing short phenomenal as the tenth doctor concludes his life by breaking a few rules one last time saving the lives of his dearest friends and tying up one last loose end.

3983431,4,B002SZQC7K,"Just before the Tenth Doctor regenerates, he heartbreakingly moans, ""I don't want to go."" I don't want him to go either. David Tennant is THE Doctor of our times. Yes, there have been nine other incarnations, but in the past few years, he embodies THE Doctor so much that it's hard to see anybody else in the role. I even forgot that Christopher Eccleston was his immediate predecessor and when he left, I thought I couldn't picture anyone else. Still, it was his time to bow out. All the same, I wished Tennant ended his Doctor's tenure with a full series. The Complete Specials is a frustrating set because I want more from it. Come on, it only had three one hour specials and a two hour finale. That's not enough to savour the awesomeness that is the Tenth Doctor. Besides, with the exception of the frighteningly intense ""The Waters of Mars"", the rest of the Specials are not exactly the Doctor's finest hours. Although they are all enjoyable in their own kooky ways, they're wildly uneven. ""The Next Doctor"" should have been a two-parter because there are great ideas in there that didn't fulfill their potential. I also wanted more of the steampunk Cybermen. ""Planet of the Dead"" is a very fun romp and guest companion Michelle Ryan is a hoot but it's like a filler episode. It does however work as a lighthearted interlude before the horrors of ""The Waters of Mars"" where we are treated to a scary side of the Doctor. This episode is the set's saving grace. Finally, while the Doctor's send-off is poignant, dignified and appropriate, the rest of ""The End of Time"" is WTF with an OTT appearance by the Master and an on crack plot that has me scratching my head.

3983436,4,B002SZQC7K,"The title tells it all.  The 11th Doctor, his script writers and producers, have some big shoes to fill.  The Waters of Mars is one of the best Doctor Who stories ever and also one of the most disturbing as the Doctor displays enormous hubris in thinking he can change history and is ""Lord of Time"".  His come-upance at the end is tragic.  The Next Doctor and Planet of the Dead are entertaining one off tales.  The End of Time is a typical Russell T. Davies series ending.  If you liked his earlier season endings you'll like this.  If not, well probably you shouldn't buy these DVDs.  Full of action, pulling out all the stops, dragging in all the past companions, etc.  The Doctor actually has about 4 death scenes before the real one; Davies really stretches that out as far as humanly (or Time Lordy) possible.  The final 10 minutes are given over to a sort of farewell tour as the Doctor finds the time, while slowly dying, to play one last visit to all his significant companions of the series.  Personally I lost patience with the tragic, Hamlet like despair Davies and Tennant gave to the Doctor for the past two years.  Every other Doctor took death and regeneration pretty much in stride.  They didn't necessarily like it but accepted it as part of who they were.  The 9th doctor willingly took it on to save Rose for example.  I feel it is a false note for the 10th Doctor to fight death with such despair and tragic overtones as what we've seen in the last regular season and in these specials.  Nonetheless if you are a fan of the 10th Doctor these are must have discs.",1268438400,,1583,4.42560553633218

3983439,5,B002SZQC7K,"This is it - final DVD collection for David Tennant in his role as the Doctor.  This 5 disc set is an excellent addition to the DVD library of Doctor Who fans that want some great extras - for example, David Tennant's Video Diary and Doctor Who Confidential.  Here in the USA, DW Confidential is not shown - so it was a great full version.  DVDs from prior seasons had smaller versions of DW Confidential - so it was great to see it all especially for a fan that did not have access to those.

The quality of the DVDs was excellent and since I waited and did not plan on getting the individual DVDs figuring that a box set would be made - this is definitely a treat that I've been waiting for since the beginning of 2009.  All in all, David Tennant is a strong presence and a Doctor that sets the bar very high.

Interestingly when I first saw these when they originally aired, some of the writing seemed strange - but the extras on this DVD really helped to see the logical reason within Doctor Who history to have these exist.  Not that I agreed with everything - but it was a fun ride and absolutely brilliant.

This DVD set also marks a goodbye to many companions- including Donna Noble - my absolute favorite companion of all time!

Even my kids have gotten into the Doctor Who series to the point of going back to watch the earlier Doctor Who series. David Tennant as The Doctor has given myself and my kids many hours of entertainment and a kindred intrest that we watch and discuss and share our veiwpoints. It's normaly hard to find a show that we enjoy and agree on but this is the one we sit and watch together for hours. The shows are well written and extremely well acted and David Tennant is amazing how he can jump from smiling and joking to a serious and dangerous force to be reckoned with. Of course this is all possible with being surrounded by all the actors that have been on the series thru the years. David Tennant will be sorely missed as The Doctor and I wish him well in his future endeavors.,1267228800,,1096,4.150234741784038
3983452,2,B002SZQC7K,"Much of the Tenth Doctor's era was classic. His first season was largely brilliant, his second had some terrific moments, and his third ... had its moments. Unfortunately, as the Tenth Doctor's tenure continued he got mired in angst and past continuity -- his third season was plagued with episodes that were more like bad fanfiction. The specials this year have been very disappointing, and this collection just isn't worth it.

The episodes included here are ""The Next Doctor,"" ""Planet of the Dead,"" ""The Waters of Mars"" and the two parts of ""The End of Time.""

""The Next Doctor"" is the best of the lot, featuring a great character in the ""other Doctor"" who would have been an excellent companion. Any drama the ending would have had is spoiled by the usual reliance on spectacle. Still, it's an okay episode and a lot of fun to watch.

""Planet of the Dead"" is ... eh ... it could have been an interesting psychological episode with different people stranded on an alien planet with a Doctor cut off from all his usual resources. Instead it was just a string of set-pieces with nothing really to offer. A very boring 50-odd minutes.

""The Waters of Mars"" is basically a retread of ""The Impossible Planet"" and countless other episodes. Closed military base, alien enemy that makes people paranoid, et cetera. Completely forgettable.

And then comes ""The End of Time,"" another outlet for Russell T. Davies' fanfiction impulses and his obsession with romantically pairing off the Doctor. Bernard Cribbins as Wilf steals the show -- he's about the only one who ever gets to be interesting or entertaining, as the Doctor is snappish and MEAN, the villains are so over-the-top as to be comic, and the episode's big twist at the end is underwhelming.

For a year that's supposed to be a spectacular send-off for David Tennant, it watches more like a list of the worst excesses of his era: style over substance, ham-fisted writing, and anticlimactic endings. Much was promised about the final scene, but even that comes off badly ... an out-of-character angry tantrum by Tennant the actor is followed by Davies indulging himself to the greatest degree yet in his obsession with retreading old ground in season finales.

This set is really a massive disappointment for fans who might have been hoping something might redeem this era and bring it back to the heights of Tennant's first couple of years. I can hope that under Stephen Moffat's control we can get away from the Angsty Doctor, forced romantic subplots, and unfunny Catherine Tate Show humor (though at least that last is absent from these specials!) and back to the creative science fiction that was the series' hallmark before 2009.",1266537600,17,2688,4.868708971553611
3983453,5,B002SZQC7K,"Dr. Who: The Complete Specials is a collection of television specials, starring David Tennant as the immortal ""Doctor.""  The set includes ""The Next Doctor,"" ""Planet of the Dead,"" ""The Waters of Mars,"" and ""The End of Time, Part One & Two.""  These specials lead up to The Doctor's regeneration as the 11th Doctor, played by Matt Smith. It's a fun and exciting addition for Doctor Who fans, as well as newcomers to the show.

""The Next Doctor""
When the Doctor (David Tennant) arrives in London on Christmas Eve 1851, he discovers that Cybermen are planning to resurrect the CyberKing.  But another Doctor (David Morrissey) is already there, with little memory of his past. Fast-paced, with a few surprises, this installment is fun and light-hearted.

 ""Planet of the Dead""
David Tennant is back as the Doctor, tracking a strange wormhole. But the Doctor and a bus full of people soon find themselves stranded on a strange planet, in the middle of what looks like an arid desert.  Teaming up with a beautiful thief, prepared for any situation (played by Michelle Ryan), the Doctor searches for a way back to Earth before a storm of murderous creatures reaches them. Slightly creepy, but a lot of humor, this installment was definitely my favorite of them all.

 ""The Waters of Mars""
When the Doctor (David Tennant) stumbles upon a base on Mars, he excitedly realizes that this is the first ever human base on Mars.  But soon discovers that they are all supposed to die this same day. The Doctor's curiosity gets the better of him, when he decides to help the group try to defend themselves from a strange water-based infection. But when the creatures find out that Earth is mostly water, they decide to hitch a ride back to Earth and take over.  This installment was the darkest and felt most like a horror flick, with hear-pounding suspense and even an ethical dilemma for the Doctor.

 ""The End of Time, Part One & Two""
This is David Tennant's last adventure as the Doctor. When his adversary the Master (John Simm) is reawakened, the Doctor is too late to stop the insane Master's plot to take over Earth. And the Doctor also faces his fate that ""He will knock four times,"" leading to his death. Former James Bond, Timothy Dalton, narrates these ominous, climactic installments.

3983454,3,B002SZQC7K,"At this point, I would think that most people reading a review of these specials are already aware of the stories, so I won't dwell on that something that has been already stated in other reviews ad nauseum by giving you a synopsis of each story.  But these are the final stories of the 10th Doctor, David Tennant, whose performance has never been less than excellent, decided to take permanent leave of a role that he revered since he was a child.  And due to a variety of circumstances, he took all of 2009 to do this transition, culminate to his regeneration into the 11th Doctor, Matt Smith.

As far as these stories go, they only get better and better. Starting with the 2008 Christmas Special, The Next Doctor then we then go to the 2009 Easter Special, Planet of the Dead from there we see The Waters of Mars, and ultimately, we are treated with a sad but wonderful two part Christmas/New Years Special, The End of Time.  When I was watching, The Waters of Mars and The End of Time, I'll admit that I did so while standing up, watching it two feet from the telly!

So what's my beef as to why I give this box set three stars?

EXTRAS!

Since Doctor Who returned, each season has been jam-packed with extras, and commentaries became a standard. But this box set, which has all four stories for 2009, only has commentaries for the last story, The End of Time.

So now I'm thinking, ""Did they not have time to do the other three? Realistically, they've had many months to do commentaries on these, and wrap up the whole package nicely. And don't you tell me they didn't do them because the individual shows were not finished. I have heard commentaries from previous seasons when the commentators stated that the show itself was not complete, but they were still doing the extra audio track for the fans. In fact, it was stated in The End of Time commentary that it was recorded before the show was broadcast.

Additionally, I have heard a pod cast on line, which was basically a commentary, for The Waters or Mars, and yet this was not included as an extra. So they are additional extras out there, but not included. SHAME SHAME 2|entertain.

And what about the Doctor Who Confidential which introduces Matt Smith? It was broadcast over a year before he took on the role. Are they going to wait until his first season is available before they release that as well?  So Im really not seeing this as COMPLETE as the box claims.

This box set does at least include:
Doctor Who at the Proms
Deleted scenes with introduction from Russell T. Davies
David Tennant Video Diaries: The Final Days
Doctor Who BBC Christmas idents
Doctor Who at Comic-Con
Un-cut Confidentials

So, faithful viewers, I summarize by saying that my rating of three stars does not reflect these fantastic shows, but the lack of what we should get from PURCHASING them.

In closing, if you simply want to watch the first three stories, bare bones, and the last one with some inside knowledge in the form of a commentary, and you want to see all their respective uncut Confidentials, this is perfect for you.  And the other few extras are a nice bonus, Ill admit.  But for those fans who have been watching this exceptional programme for either a few years, or nearly five decades, and wish to continue experiencing more than the average viewer, then these so called COMPLETE SPECIALS are, in all honesty, less than COMPLETE.  While I would recommend this for all fans, I have to say that you are NIOT getting the most bang for your buck.",1266278400,,3507,4.5500794912559615
3983455,3,B002SZQC7K,"The Doctor (David Tennat) has more lives than a cat. In his current 10th incarnation The Doctor battles Cybermen with another Doctor during the Industrial Age in England, takes a double decker from London to a arid planet with a thief (guest star Michelle Ryan of ""The Bionic Woman""), tries to avoid infection by a deadly virus with the first explorers on Mars (with ""Rome"" star Lindsay Duncan)and faces his greatest nemesis The Master (""Life on Mars"" star John Simms returning to the role he played in episodes of the ""New"" ""Doctor Who"")in these TV specials that aired prior to the forthcoming 5th season.

The specials are a bit uneven. ""Waters of Mars"" creates quite a bit of suspense and the ending is quite moving giving Tennant more emotional range to play with as The Doctor than he has before. Likewise the two part ""The End of Time"" gives Tennant more to play as The Doctor as he realizes his end is near; there's a weariness here that was only hinted at before in his performance but there's also a strong sense that The Doctor isn't ready to go into his 11th incarnation just yet. ""The Next Doctor"" (the first of the specials to air during Christmas 2008)is geared a bit more towards the kids but is still enjoyable. ""The Next Doctor"" and ""Planet of the Dead"" are probably the two weaker specials presented here although both are enjoyable and Michelle Ryan performance makes you wish that she was a regular on the series. Nevertheless, all of them are nothing short of entertaining and writer/producer Russell T. Davies (who co-wrote the first two specials with other writers)brings his characteristic quirky personality to each of the scripts.

The two part ""The End of Time"" also benefits from a cameo by Timothy Dalton. The long, extended conclusion might have been a tad too sentimental for some Who fans but it shouldn't have come as a surprise to those who have seen Davies' work before.

Three of the four specials here (which run a little over an hour except the two part ""The End of Time"") are all shot in high def (a first for ""Doctor Who"" which was shot in standard definition video for its first four seasons) EXCEPT ""The Next Doctor"" which was also shot in standard def and has been upscaled for high definition here (the box does disclose this info on the back). As a result, ""The Next Doctor"" looks a bit softer than the other specials here. The rest of the specials look terrific.

The extras include ""Doctor Who Confidential"", promos, David Tennant's ""Video Diary"" and a couple of other worthwhile odds and ends. ""Doctor Who: The Complete Specials"" may not be considered the ""real"" 5th season of the series (and they aren't exactly movies either as each one runs too short that)but for all intents and purposes these specials play like a mini 5th season allowing Tennant and Davies to gracefully say goodbye to a popular character that they had loads of fun with and close off Tennant's rein as The Doctor for audiences.

This is a nice set although a bit overpriced IMHO (compare this to a season of ""Lost"" on Blu-ray for example where you get 20 plus episodes for the same price in many instances)but still recommended as the high def presentation looks quite nice and the extras are very good.",1265673600,3,3225,4.680776014109347

3983457,4,B002SZQC7K,"IF you're a fan, then yes, the stories deserve 5 stars.  In fact seeing the complete specials in short sequence (as buyers of the set obviously will) and without commercial interruption deepens the dramatic effect of the final story arch of the 10th Doctor, seeing them as if for the first time.  The set offers drool-worthy extras for the serious fan, with each single-episode disk paired with an episode specific ""Doctor Who Confidential"".  And yes, seeing them in Hi-Def is certainly wonderful.  Incidentally, it's well packaged.

No, the review loses a star for failing to distinguish itself in any meaningful way from the standard def DVD version (which EARNED it's five star review, thank you!).  No BD Live, no pop-up menus, zippo.  Just the added Def.

Look, you don't need the fawning overly detailed reviews.  If you're buying this you've seen them already, I mean --  how could you NOT, right?  You just want to know if its worth it.  If you think seeing it for years in HD is worth the extra bucks, then yes it's worth it.  If you can live in standard def and save some bucks, then no.  Either way, the stories kick, thanks to Russell T. Davies, and David Tennant (who will be missed, and dearly too I fear).

And between us, ""The Waters of Mars"" is my personal favorite ;-)",1265241600,4,1286,4.628318584070796
3983458,2,B002SZQC7K,"Five ""specials"" (bit longer than regular episodes) across (inexplicably) five discs with commentary, Confidentials, deleted scenes (all placed on the last disc without regard to the episode they pertained to), and the like. Over-priced, yes, but as mentioned elsewhere, in the context of the longer-length series and its over-pricing, apropos in keeping with the pattern. As for the worth of the episodes themselves...fairly rubbish. Though nothing as awful as the Christmas special ""Voyage of the Damned"", nothing remotely as good as even the middling, say, ""New Earth"". So the end of Davies and Tennant's Doctor comes and goes without much recommendation. The first two specials (""The Next Doctor"" and ""Planet of the Dead"") were the best of the lot - the first for its idea, if not execution, and the second for its potential companion (Lady Christina), though not its actual story. Next, ""The Waters of Mars"" arrives as filler with a ""villain-of-the-week"" threat. And finally, the two-part finale ""The End of Time"" brings the return of the Master and another original-era character played by Timothy Dalton. Again, the Master is played with no style, subtely nor sinister demeanor but all camp (even Yellowstone National isn't large enough to contain this much camp!), clown and fight or flight. Literally. For diehards and fools only; pray that you're just a diehard, at worst.",1265155200,6,1381,5.225225225225225
3983459,3,B002SZQC7K,"I love DOCTOR WHO. It never mattered to me about the horrendous special effects from the old days, as one's imagination made the monsters far scarier and, dare I say, faster than seen on screen. The New Who is quite a feast for the eyes, though. And, as always, there are the occasional script/story-line problems. But, as others have coined, DOCTOR WHO is [now] 11 times better than anything else on telly.

Next, please be warned that neither the DVD or Blu-ray versions of episodes 1-4 contain cast commentaries. Why not? you might ask, especially since they exist (some are downloadable through iTunes or BBC on-line). To me, this is a terrible blunder that should be corrected with trading in these sets for 'fully-packed' sets in the near-future. The final two-part finale does contain audio commentaries.

Also, for the Blu-ray version, it is a total mis-use of the medium. Heck, all 5 stories could fit on one Blu-ray disk, still with high quality. Very silly.

And speaking of 'silly', the first two specials are just that. Loads of fun, please don't get me wrong (again, I am a huge DW fan), I really enjoyed them, but moments and scenes were forced and poorly scripted. They needed polishing. Still, I agree with others who opine that these two were average but delightful adventures.

WATERS OF MARS appears to've benefited from being later in the schedule, as the script is both simple and powerfully devastating. This story stands alone as the best of all of these 5 specials.

Now, the two-part finale. Begins well, but one should definitely wait a few hours if not a day or two after watching WOM before tackling this one. Mostly because of how we first see The Doctor in his first scene. It would abruptly halt the resonance of the preceding episode. But soon after we get on our way, again it feels as if Mr Davies is dropping some of the balls he's trying to juggle, and we're waiting patiently s he goes about the room picking them up so that the story can push forward. It's a basic pacing problem, very difficult here, trying to lay out ground-work while refreshing our memories and making the story move forward. There are a few things here which simply do not satisfy, though the smile on one's face is quite contradictory. Cohesion and flow missed the tram, got left behind.

While fans will debate many issues of these episodes, the fanboy wankiness of the final 15 minutes is lovely and fairly easy to forgive. Still, it might have meant more had there not been SO MANY BLASTED REMINDERS that the 10th Doctor's 'song would soon end'.

However, for me to be satisfied, I do NOT have to know every single detail that happens on or off screen. As long as I enjoy the  Final Rendition of whatever story is being told, I do not have to know everything. I've always found some questions are always better left unanswered. Better to be able to exercise my own imagination, yeah? And the 10th Doctor's final adventures fit the bill.",1264982400,,479,4.443181818181818
3983462,5,B002SZQC7K,"I just love David Tennant as Dr. Who. His sense of humor keeps things on the light side so the series doesn't get as dark as Torchwood. He comes across as intelligent and funny at the same time, which is hard when a person is really intelligent (mostly they just come across as puffed-up or boring, depending). I'll be sad to see him go, but I'm glad that he did this last set of episodes for the delight of Dr. Who watchers.",1264809600,3,425,4.195121951219512
3983463,5,B002SZQC7K,"If you're a fan of Doctor Who, or just good science fiction, who's been putting off the upgrade to Blu-ray...here's a most compelling reason to make the switch now.  These 4 special episodes shine brightly in the hi-def format.  BBC gave us a taste of this with last year's release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Planet-of-the-Dead-Blu-ray/dp/B0016821YI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Planet of the Dead [Blu-ray</a>] (which was the first episode to be filmed in HD) as well as the 3 series of Torchwood.  I'm not sure what the British are doing different from the U.S. or other countries, but their hi-definition programs are simply the best I have seen in the format.

On the chance that you're not familiar with these special episodes themselves, here's a quick run-down.  Please note, this review does contain minor SPOILERS:

THE NEXT DOCTOR: The 2008 Christmas special.  The Doctor visits Victorian England, where he encounters another man claiming to be the Doctor.  I won't spoil the surprise, but there are some nice twists and a standout performance from David Morrisey in the title role.  This was the first of the modern Doctor's episodes without a regular companion.  It was also the last episode before the switch to hi-definition, but the upconvert used here looks fantastic, so it's really a non-issue as far as I'm concerned.

PLANET OF THE DEAD: Aired on Easter, 2009.  The Doctor and a woman on the run (The Bionic Woman's Michelle Ryan) are among a busload of passengers who find themselves stranded on a desert planet overrun with terrifying flying creatures.  Most folks agree this one's just an average adventure.  But, it looks stunning.

THE WATERS OF MARS: A great, creepy tale set on mid-21st century Mars.  The Doctor has some hard choices to make when he realizes a group of Martian colonists are destined to die on the day he arrives.  It's also one of David Tennant's finest hours, as he begins to confront the prophecy regarding his own death that he was told at the end of Planet of the Dead.

THE END OF TIME: This two-parter was the end of David Tennant's tenure as the famous Time Lord.  While confronting his own mortality, the Doctor also must face the enemy who knows him best. . .and the power of a forgotten race that is using the power of time itself to reshape its own destiny.  It's a bit of a mixed bag (particularly part 1), but it's still highly engaging and a fitting resolution to the 10th Doctor's journey.

As with the individual season episodes, each special includes an hour-long documentary, Doctor Who Confidential.  These are typically well-made and informative shows that die-hard fans will appreciate.  Most everyone else will probably watch them once (if at all) and not again.

More interesting (to me, anyway) is ""Doctor Who at the Proms,"" an hour-long special.  It features the music of the show performed live at the Royal Albert Hall.  But this is no mere concert; it features actors in costume as Cybermen, Judoon, etc. that interact with the audience.  And it's hosted by Freema Aygemen, with an appearance by Catherine Tate.

As I said at the outset, these shows look fantastic on Blu-ray.  If you're a fan, this is really a no-brainer.  As Doctor Who moves into a new era with a new actor in the role, it's very gratifying to know that BBC is providing fans with the best possible versions of these final adventures with the 10th Doctor.",1264291200,73,3471,4.965337954939342
3983464,5,B002SZQC7K,"Normally $40+ for five episodes of any show would be steep, but when you put things into perspective, the price isn't bad.

These are the final five episodes of David Tennant as The Doctor, who many viewers, (especially newer viewers,) consider to be one of the best doctors throughout the show's history and all of them are amazing episodes.

Russel T. Davies, (who wrote all the episodes,) is now stepping down as executive producer of Doctor Who and many people admire him for helping to bring Doctor Who back to life and for his many other works, which are incredible.

All of the extras are completely worth it.  The Doctor Who Confidential and the David Tennant video diaries are not only good for a laugh, but they're very interesting to say the least.

Overall the show is brilliant and with all the bonus material, it's worth the price.  That and the run time must be a typo.  The final two episodes alone are roughly an hour each, and the other three are forty-five minutes.  There's no way the run time could be that short, just to help clarify if anyone was confused.",1262563200,35,1079,4.583333333333333
3983465,5,B002SZQC7K,"Having just watched ""End of Time"" broadcast in both lo-def and hi-def, can say that blu-ray will make the most of some of the beautiful matte painting backdrops and sets. Not sure it matters as much for the extensive chase and action sequences - it's the slower parts that shine. You can really see the emotion on the faces of Dr and Master in some of the close conversations. e.g. ""Can you hear it?"" in End of Time part 1.

No spoilers other than those almost everywhere on the net, but Tennant goes out on a poignant note that's different and appropriate. Roaring action, wrenching choices, and a lot of interactions at the end that should please the fans, even if a little downbeat. The first Doctor in a long time (since Pertwee?) to really appreciate the 'mortality' of a regeneration.

Set seems a worthy addition to the collection. In order, would rate the episodes best first as

End Of Time,
Waters of Mars,
Next Doctor,
Planet of the Dead,

for any that want them individually.",1262476800,8,987,4.590909090909091
