6486761,1,B00LH98Q8Q,"Quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever sat through. This one doesn't even deserve to be in the $5 bin at Walmart. As soon as I finished it - amazed I'd made it through the entire movie - I put it back in its case and tossed it into the trash.

I won't go into too much detail, as the movie has been pretty well summed up by other reviewers and the review by ERSInk says it best.",1413763200,,388,3.85
6486762,2,B00LH98Q8Q,"For a low budget film it was ok.  Enough holes in the plot that didn't make sense.  I hate first person ""found footage"" type of movies.  This isn't one, but it has a good amount of that in it, just enough to start to be annoying.  The acting is good, the special effects were nice, but the story just wasn't very strong.  Looks like it was probably made by a group of friends in their early days of film school.  Would I recommend it?  Probably not.",1413244800,5,449,4.151162790697675
6486763,2,B00LH98Q8Q,"I shouldve known as soon as the POV footage appeared on my TV what I was in store for after putting The Devil Incarnate into my DVD player. As if the cover of a baby with horns adorned with a logo featuring an upside-down cross in place of the t wasn't enough of a warning. I love a good possession or religious thriller so I wanted to give it a chance. Ill need to remember to listen to my instincts next time.

Holly (Graci Carli) and Trevor Davidson (Rod Luzzi) are newlyweds on a road trip for their honeymoon. After stopping to have their palms read, Holly begins acting strangely. The announcement that she's pregnant further sets off a chain reaction of bizarre behavior and strange occurrences. Is she suffering from mood swings because of the pregnancy or is there something more sinister at work?

The only thing good I have to say about The Devil Incarnate is that its actors all come across as genuine in their roles. They give the audience no indication that they didn't take the movie seriously during production. Its a testament to each of them and their individual skills. I felt this needed to be recognized.

No sort of Biblical theology is explored in The Devil Incarnate. There are two possible messages the movie might be trying to convey to viewers. One is that we shouldnt get involved in the occult. The other is that the sins of our ancestors will affect us. Unfortunately, it doesnt award us any hope that we can break such a generational curse.

The Devil Incarnate is not rated, but would hold an R if it were. While theres no nudity, it contains enough adult situations and content to push it beyond PG-13. It also includes frightening images and profanity.

Many times an anemic independent project like The Devil Incarnate can gain some sympathy with me if I can see the sort of hard work and passion filmmakers poured into its creation. A Making of featurette or Behind the Scenes documentary gives a reviewer like myself a chance to experience the blood, sweat, and tears everyone involved in the production put into it. Unfortunately, the DVD contains no special features to help redeem it in my eyes.

The Devil Incarnate is the sort of horror film we really don't need any more of. Playing like an unholy mash-up of Drag Me to Hell, Rosemarys Baby, and The Devil Inside, its an unnecessary addition to the demon possession and ""found footage genres thatve been overdone lately. Theres not a shred of originality to be found in its 76-minute running time.",1413244800,2,2490,4.6477272727272725
6486764,3,B00LH98Q8Q,"Hollywood and indie filmmakers seem to be following a recent trend of possessed pregnancy films.  This might have come about when the remake of ROSEMARYS BABY was announced.  Regardless of where it came from, Im onboard for the most part.  I like many of these films, those that are well done and provide some nice scares.  But unfortunately, for every good one, there are several bad ones as well.  THE DEVIL INCARNATE, however, puts me in a weird position.  The film is not great, but its not really terrible, either.  Its a middle-ground demon-flick that some viewers will like, but many will hate.  As a result, I am on the fence myself about it.

Despite the movies shortcomings, I definitely think this film should win the award for Best DVD Cover of 2014.  Theres something about the image that disturbs me greatly, and Im not sure why.  This unease is an excellent way to promote a film in my opinion, as it almost forces you to watch it.

THE DEVIL INCARNATE is shot well, switching between first-person POV and standard, third-person film shots.  I like the difference in perspectives for this film because the first-person angles allow for a deeper, more intense immersion into whats playing out onscreen.  I haven't seen many films do this before, primarily because it is a difficult concept to pull off, but it works here.

The acting is pretty good overall.  I like Graci Carlis performance as Holly, and Emily Rogers shines as Marissahowever, there are no exceptional displays of acting.  The cast as a whole simply seemed to mesh well.

I was disappointed to discover there were no big special effects shots in THE DEVIL INCARNATE, other than a few spots of blood.  Given the nature of the film, I was hoping for some decent demonic scenes or even a few spatterings of gore.  Unfortunately, we get zilch.

The story is where I found the biggest problems, though.  Most of the film is good, specifically the first and second acts.  Theres an interesting story about the curse at the front of the film, and then a lot of buildup as eerie things begin to happen with Holly.  But when things reach a head towards the end, the plot fizzles before it falls apart completely.  The viewer is left with a head-scratching ending that arrives abruptly and makes no sense.  Up until that point, I was actually going to recommend this film.  However, after seeing the way the film ends, Im not sure Im going to do that.

I suppose I will just conclude this review by saying THE DEVIL INCARNATE has a lot of potential, but it might leave you angry with the way it falls short.  This is one of those watch-it-because-YOU-might-like-it sorta titles.  It is available now in a variety of formats if you want to give it a chance.",1412726400,3,2727,4.644351464435147
6486765,3,B00LH98Q8Q,"The title and DVD cover are misleading. The UK title is ""Cursed"" which is keeping to the film. The movie opens with narration during the credits. A curse is placed on a family line. They would be infertile unless they sacrificed or ""cut out a child."" We then see a bunch of hand held camera shots along with normal filming. Trevor (Rod Luzzi) and Holly (Graci Carli) are newlyweds traveling in Florida filming their honeymoon. Through a series of circumstances Holly meets a woman fortune teller (Barbara Van Fleet) that sends her screaming and then discovers she is pregnant. They move into his parent's house, which they gave them as a gift.

Soon weird things happen and Holly's behavior becomes erratic. Marissa, (Emily Rogers) is Trevor's highs school lesbian semi-goth sister who has a thing for Holly as well as a snoop who investigates her past.

The film offers nothing new and exciting to the evil baby films. The acting was on par for a ""B"" horror film. It had potential, but didn't capitalize on it. No special effect scenes. Nothing that seems supernatural. Let's keep it in budget.

A so-so rental for the Cassadaga crowd.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. One sex scene. Near shower nudity.",1408752000,2,1196,4.819512195121951
8665856,4,B00LH98Q8Q,"This is Paul Naschy's best work. It is great to see it in HD but this film is so important to Naschy's filmography that one can't help wish Arrow, Shout Factory, or Vinegar Syndrome had restored it, as they have greater resources than Mondo Macbre. As it stands, it is slightly better than a high quality DVD transfer. Scenes with water look the best. Despite the picture quality, it is well worth a purchase as the extras are excellent. Especially compelling is the commentary track by Troy Hogarth, a noted film historian. Five stars for the film and extras, One star removed for the mixed bag transfer.",1530748800,,605,4.663551401869159
8665857,2,B00LH98Q8Q,"I am usually quite fond of horror movies starring Paul Naschy. What also got me was the limited edition red case. Paul Naschy, cool red case and decent cover art ..got me! But unfortunately this movie was some Bullsh#t!! Save your money and rent anything else available.",1523577600,,270,4.76595744680851
8665858,5,B00LH98Q8Q,Don't pay any attention to a majority of other reviews here. They are reviewing an entirely different film altogether. They have nothing to do with this Paul Naschy (Jacinto Molina) classic! This general release version isn't even out yet.  I have one of the 666 limited edition blu-rays released a few weeks back.,1522281600,6,314,4.9245283018867925

8665862,1,B00LH98Q8Q,"looks really cool and better in the trailer which sadly is better than the actual movie they showed the good spooky scary parts in the trailer which fools you ropes and reels ya in like it did me, in reality it is very slow and tame. The husband of the pregnant woman is such a dingus you want to reach into the screen smack him in the head and say WAKE THE ???? UP. He's totally ignorant with his sister who's trying to give him relevant information she found about his wife, and how she saw his wife grabbing their fathers crotch at the party which is highly uncharacteristic of her, WTF? The ending is rather gory and lame, this is so dumb it sucks rancid lemons",1420934400,3,665,4.244094488188976
8665863,3,B00LH98Q8Q,"Fun and wacky!  Very supernatural and the actresses were great!  The lead male actor however was not very believeable and the ""home movie"" idea in the script was annoying visually.  The idea was fun and entertaining. Btw--Cassadaga doesnt have any scary evil witches but its a real place with very evolved mediums that help people with spiritual guidance.  The movie was mostly filmed in Jax and I hope more movies get filmed here in the First Coaast area.",1420070400,2,456,4.8076923076923075
8665864,1,B00LH98Q8Q,"As a fan of Rosemary's Baby, the Omen, and that ""spawn of Satan"" subgenre of horror, I was hoping for a good rental, with the knowledge that this was a microbudget, c-horror movie. There have been a couple of decent ones of late, including Delivery: The Beast Within (a fun ""found footage"" entry in this subgenre). This one, however, aspired to be something it never became - that's the best way I can put it. I do understand that the filmmakers were attempting - unless I am overanalyzing and giving them too much credit - a bit more of a darker psychological edge, However, this simply muddied the storytelling and led to a disjointed patchwork film that I definitely would not recommend to anyone. I will say that the lead actors were well above average for this type of film, and I do hope to see them in something else in the future. But, even if you're a big fan of ""spawn of evil"" movies, you will walk away from this one disappointed. I'd say even 666 The Devil's Child was better than this one - and that starred Octomom. But, again, proper credit to the actors - they made the best of a bad script and poor directing.",1418342400,5,1127,4.3971291866028706
8665865,1,B00LH98Q8Q,I wanted this to be a good movie. Don't look at the cover. There isn't anything like that in the film. I tried my best to figure out exactly what this movie was really about. Never did.  Do not waste your money.,1414627200,2,211,4.023809523809524
