8026994,4,B0002DVAEU,"I am a little surprised about the backlash against this video. From the quality perspective, it is almost on par with the baby Einstein like videos. They too are very simple as this video is. People need to remember that very young children should not be exposed to the type of lightning flash changes of scenery that some experts say can help cause ADD and children do not need high tech for their brains to be stimulated. Plus, children love puppets and music. My two kids have always liked this video and would sit still through at least 10 minutes of it when they were 12 months or younger, which is pretty good. Now that they are older they can sit through the whole thing. They always liked this video much better than the Baby Estein set - probably because the music and colors are much closer to what they are used to in our bi-cultural home. Finally, if you are looking for a video to teach your child Spanish, this is not it. Probably no video will do that for you. Children should be emmersed in the culture and those who want to teach another language need to speak to their children regularly in that language. However, any video in Spanish can reinforce the language. This one or others.",1170547200,,1201,4.463636363636364
8026995,1,B0002DVAEU,"I bought this DVD for my grandaughter, hoping she would learn some Spanish through it (my native language).  What a dissappointment! There is almost no language involved, and I truly dislike the sad Latin- American stereotypes. Also, it is obviously a very low-quality production.

I would recommend the DVDs by A LA VIBORA DE LA MAR, as a much MUCH better option (see my reviews).",1166572800,,381,4.846153846153846
8026996,1,B0002DVAEU,"Honestly, this is one of the worst videos I have EVER seen. I was shocked to see home video production quality -- like somebody created this video in their living room. Cheap puppets on a back sheet or white sheet back ground.

And neither the music or the content was Latin or educational. Once in a blue moon a voice would say a color in spanish -- but the word was only said once and had nothing visual to back it up.

The description says it teaches Latin culture and values... HOW? By showing a store bought baby mobile and toy cars on a race track and a pineapple puppet? Right.

This is basically some folks out to sell cheap toys with a cheap video.

I WANT MY MONEY BACK!",1135987200,7,680,4.207692307692308
8026997,5,B0002DVAEU,"My Baby, Daniel, is seven months and we have use the baby einstein videos since he was two months. He enjoys those. However, my husban and I didn't feel that this videos where able to help us to show him our world- Latin America.  At this stage, I'm looking for valuable tools to stimulate my child and ""Mi Beb Discovers Latin America"" is fantastic to acomplish that in a great way for my baby. The music has different rithms from my beloved land like merengue, cumbia and tango.  This is not a video to learn Spanish, but to learn about our heritage throughout music, didactic images and playful puppets that by the way are so original- like the pam tree.  We are truly satisfy! If you are from latin america and like the Baby Einstein videos like Mozart, then this video is right for you.",1106179200,7,790,4.43448275862069
8026998,1,B0002DVAEU,"This DVD consists of hand puppets, music and an occasional Spanish word.  It covers only colors and shapes.  It might be good with a Spanish-speaking adult to guide the child, but It really doesn't do much to teach Spanish.  I noticed that one other reviewer had my same opinion.  I believe that this DVD is not much better than a home video.  I purchased several other products that were much better.  Check out other reviews and make your choices. I am returning this product.",1106179200,6,478,4.630952380952381
8026999,5,B0002DVAEU,"Es fantastico este DVD. Los titeres, la musica, el colorido son maravillosos. Yo vi el video con mis hijos como nos lo recomiendan en la guia para los padres y ha sido un exito, tanto en casa como en el day care.

Ahora mi hija de 5 anos sabe todos los animales que aparecen en el video, los colores , las figuras geometricas, numeros(y lo mas lindo es verla ensenandole a su hermanito las cosas de donde nacieron los papas!!!!). Bailan y aplauden con la musica. Y a medida que mas lo ven mas lo disfrutan. Los valores familiares y culturales que nos muestran son increibles.

Gracias por producir una producto de calidad el cual nos permite que nuestros ninos conozcan y disfruten Latinoamerica.",1093046400,9,696,4.604838709677419
8027000,5,B0002DVAEU,"This is a great DVD. I and my husband who is third generation of Mexican Family bought this DVD in order to bring my husband's culture to our two little girls who we want them to grow knowing the Latino Culture, specially the language: Spanish. They have enjoyed each second of music and images of this DVD, it is incredible how they listen and pay attention to Discover Latin America. I strongly believe that this DVD will help my kids to familiarize and learn about this amazing culture.

I recommend this DVD to either Latin Americans or Americans. Excellent product.",1093046400,5,570,4.7
8027001,5,B0002DVAEU,"My grandson is 15 months Old. Today was the first time he watched the video.  His attention was 100% to the video from the beginning to the end. He danced with the music and when the video finished he began to say "" mas , mas. I'm so happy - This is a great DVD.

If you have relatives with little kids, it is a fantastic gift.",1092960000,3,327,3.8656716417910446
8027002,5,B0002DVAEU,"Congratulations!  We need more videos like this one. My baby loves its image, music and friendly puppets. All of them show her something about my beutiful land- Latin America.  As a mother of two, it has been very important to me to raise my children not only bilingual, but also bicultural (most of my family lives in Latin America)and this video has been the only one that has match our expectations. My baby loves it as much as she loves her baby einstein videos. My husban and I are waiting for more videos and materials like this to help us with our goal.

It is a great buy!",1092614400,,580,4.351851851851852
8027003,1,B0002DVAEU,"I'm raising a bilingual baby, and I was hoping this DVD would be something like ""Baby Einstein"" with a Latin twist. However, what I got was a mediocre puppet show featuring a JalapeNo puppet with a guitar (!!) and boring closeups of a mobile that I could've done on my own camcorder. What a disappointment! My baby loves other DVDs, like Juana la Iguana and Baby Neptune, but this one doesn't hold her attention for more than a minute. Don't waste your money on this DVD!

There is a huge market for good Spanish-language DVDs for kids...can anyone come up with a decent product???",1092528000,9,581,4.586538461538462
