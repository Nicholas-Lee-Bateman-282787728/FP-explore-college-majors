794270,1,6304154135,"If Tom Baker's E-space Trilogy was the best of the best, this Silvester McCoy episode was the worst of the worst.  It's like a cheap B-rate horror  flick from the 80's on 'USA's up all night' TV show with Ronda Shear.  So  are all of the episodes of this season.  The acting is terrible the story  weak the lighting cheap, so on and so on.  All and all it is a Joke and a  travesty, no wonder Dr. Who cancelled after this epsiode.",966556800,,430,4.096385542168675
794271,5,6304154135,"This adventure, featuring council estates, city squallor and grim reality, demonstrates how the series had moved on in its 26 years.
The gritty portrayal of Ace's home of Perrivale provides a good contrast to the  science-fantasy atmosphere of the Planet of the Cheetah People.  The  Ace/Doctor double-act is at its best here, there is are some superb pieces  of dialogue and dark undertones, and Anthony Ainley is at last playing an  alternative incarnation of the Master rather than a parody of Roger  Delgado's version.  The Master's sense of emotion and desperation in this  story provides a new angle on the character and makes it a shame this was  to be Ainley's last appearance in the series.
The Cheetah people do,  admittedly, appear to be on the cheesy side, but they are saved by their  portrayal and some stunning camerawork.  The soundtrack, original and  atmospheric, is also a high point.  If this story really does prove to be  the final TV serial adventure of the Doctor then at least we can be  thankful the series has finished on such a high note as this.",960163200,,1074,4.786885245901639

7863056,2,6304154135,"I wanted this video because it was the last adventure from the original Doctor Who series for a long time -- ended in 1989.  I thought the cat costumes were cute, laughed at the stiff fake cat and The Master's glowing eyes, knew that the last words spoken by the Doctor and Ace were probably dubbed at the last moment when they realized that the series had been cancelled and probably would never air again.  However, when I finished watching the show, I really felt it stunk. It didn't help when the cats howled like wolves or coyotes instead of cats.  I mean I have watched a lot of the episodes with all of the doctors from William Hartnell to Sylvester McCoy and seen the so-called ""cheesy"" special effects, etc. but I really liked most of the adventures--and really didn't feel the effects were so cheesy.  There is so much imagination in the creatures they have created -- they must have spent forever designing and creating them over the years.  I have purchased ALL of the VHS tapes (and a couple of DVD's) available and watched around 30 or so.  The last scene of Survival was a letdown. Buy it, if you must (like I did), but remember:  I warned you.",1135728000,,1159,4.464454976303317
7863057,5,6304154135,"Seriously, this is probably my favourite original Doctor Who episode of all time.  Why ?  Because it was the last one !  Ha ha !

If you think Sylvester McCoy was the best Doctor simply because you were too young to watch the earlier episodes the first time around, or if watching rejects from the cast of 'Cats' ride around on horses chasing Ace is your thing, then by all means watch this episode.  I personally make a point of watching it at least once a year.  And I laugh and I laugh...

7863058,5,6304154135,"This was the last story of Doctor Who to be broadcast and is a very potent story, containing themes involving survival and the dynamics that compare and contrast man and animal.
A return trip to Perivale, Ace's hometown, reveals that four kids have gone missing in the past month, some of them being Ace's friends. The Doctor and Ace find out the cause of this.  Cheetah People, equestrian man-sized cats with fur and faces like cheetahs, kidnap their prey to their planet.  Controlling them is the Doctor's oldest enemy, the Master, who himself has taken aspects of the Cheetah People.
The planet, a forbidding wasteland (actually a quarry in Dorset), is daunting even for the tough Sergeant Patterson, who teaches a self-defense course for the youth and prides himself on keeping his head in a crisis.  Only the pacifist Doctor's help prevents him from being like so many panic-stricken victims who become catfood.  Patterson's quite aggressive and social-Darwinian:  ""Life's not a game, son.  I'm teaching you the art of survival.  I'm teaching you to fight back.  What happens when life starts pushing you?  What are you gonna do then?""  He even says this in a taunting and challenging voice to one of his charges, getting in his face and even prodding his chest with his hand.  Later, Midge, one of Ace's friends, tells Patterson's class a cold harsh version of the same:  ""It's survival of the fittest.  Get rid of the dead wood, let the wasters go to the wall, and the strong inherit the Earth.""
Ace wounds Karra, a Cheetah Person attacking her, but instead of killing her, helps her recover.  Ace soon connects with Karra, who calls her sister and urges her to follow her.  However, the danger to Ace is that Karra might either kill her or worse, Ace will transform if drawn too deeply to the planet.
The theme of survival is carried through in a joke told between two grocers, the punchline being that for two men trying to outrun a lion, one only need to outrun his friend, because his friend will be eaten by the lion.  However, many people have no easy answer for the Doctor's next question to the grocers: what do you about the second lion?
An interesting exchange takes place between Ace and Karra, as the latter invites her to partake in a feast over a corpse.
Ace:  You kill people.  You eat people.
Karra:  When I'm hungry, I hunt.  When I hunt, I eat.
Thus, Karra, like other animals, kill when they're hungry, unlike humans, who in the post-industrial free-market world, kill for more brutal and horrific reasons.  It's interesting how Victorian ways had man closer to God than to animal, and how thanks to Darwin, modern thought had man closer to animal.  It makes me wonder that if this post-modern world has led man to this degree of savagery, we need a realignment to modernism, acknowledging the human part.
But the Doctor's refusal to fight and his cry is one of the best lines in the whole series:  ""If we fight like animals, we'll die like animals!""
The black Kitlings, the feline vultures who lead the Cheetahs to food, were an example of animatronics.  However, there are some scenes where actual black cats are used.  I mean, how can you train cats to hiss on cue?  The Cheetah costumes are a design triumph despite the criticism that it ended up like something out of Puss In Boots.  The eyes and fangs are realistic, and speaking of eyes, the eerie yellow contact lenses used for the Master and others affected by the powers of the Cheetah Planet work as well.
Ace's intense words at the end, ""I felt like I could run forever, like I could smell the wind and feel the grass under my feet and just run forever"" mirrors what many fans thought of Who, that it could just run forever.
And as the Doctor and Ace ""ride into the sunset"" he has these words, set to some touching music:  ""There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, and the sea's asleep, and the rivers dream.  Somewhere there's danger, somewhere there's injustice, somewhere else the tea's getting cold.  Come on Ace, we've got work to do.""
The series thus makes an unintended but triumphant farewell, and its current legacy as a legendary show ensures that it's no one's bowl of cat food.",1076630400,,4189,4.644504748982361
7863059,1,6304154135,"Congratulations! Just when you thought an episode could not get any worse, ""Survival"" comes along. It is sad to say, but it really is no wonder that this episode was the straw that broke the camels back. You can tell from the cheap lack of sets and bad minor part actors that this was a story completely thrown together in hopes of making it on to TV. The cat people were somewhat interesting, but the endless chasing around of a bunch of teenagers reminded me of a bad ""Friday the 13th episode."" I found myself really hoping that these awful acting kids that get transported to the Cat Planet, DO get eaten, along with the ever bad acting ""Ace.""
What is so apparent about these last Dr. Who episodes is the obvious struggle to keep a series going that was really over after Colin Baker. I never liked the Slyvester McCoy doctor or his annoying companions. I would only buy this episode just for the nostalgia of it being the very last Dr. Who episode we will ever come to know, and leave it at that.

""let the wasters go to the wall"". two shop keepers talk about two men who see an aproching lion. one man gets ready to run not from the lion but to outrun his friend to be leaft and eaten. ""if u don't mind losing ur friend"", comments the docter,""but what happens when the next lion comes along?"" the docter is taken to a world of animals were surval is esental. but the cheeta people fight eachother they hasten the destrution of their own world. the good docter see that if his friends fight and run they are doomed. he and the master become traped on the diying cheeta planet with no escape. then at the last moment the docter shouts the answer, ""IF WE FIGHT LIKE ANIMALS WE DIE LIKE ANIMALS!"" thus he is spared and returned to earth near his tardis. here then is the solution to the problem which the doctors sees at the nick of time and because of this he is spared from the death of the cheeta planet. the doctor and ace walk off planing of new adventures. a good end to a good sereis. mcoy repises his role as the 7th docter in the tv movie and he regenterats into his 8th incarnation (pual mcgann). the good doctor is still with us alive and strong.",1011312000,,1435,4.184115523465704
7863062,4,6304154135,"This is by far one of the most original and imaginative Dr. Who stories of all time and most of the credit should go to writer Rona Munroe. Sylvester McCoy had really started to settle into the role of the Doctor (which is a shame since this was his last full adventure)and it was nice to see Ace not blowing up things every 5 minutes for once. Of course Anthony Ainley was his usual best as the Master. (In fact if I remember correctly Sylvester McCoy,Sophie Aldred and Anthony Ainley all share an August 20th birthdate.)  This one may not go down as a classic and it may not have the Daleks or Cybermen, but it's a really good adventure for a lazy weekend afternoon.",993254400,,668,4.344
7863063,5,6304154135,"This story I taped from TV.  It has elements similar to the movie ""Congo"", and a little from ""Jurassic Park"" with the Cheetah People.  In Jurassic Park, Grant told people to stay still whenever a T-Rex shows up.  It's similar to the Cheetah People in that respect when the Doctor tried to warn everybody to stay still.  Ace and the Master were cursed by the Cheetah influence.  Ace probably still has the Cheetah influence in her at the end.  The Master was probably glad to have it as he boasts that he now has the power to destroy the doctor.  It is a good jungle story, if any.",987465600,,580,4.314814814814815
7863064,4,6304154135,"Here it is, the final Doctor Who story in the 26 year-old TV series. Rona  Munro's three part tale was never intended to end the run, but the BBC's  continual indecision and eventual scrapping of the show meant that that was  exactly what 'Survival' turned out to be.  The Master, arch-enemy of the  Doctor, here played by Sylvester McCoy, is a prisoner of the Cheetah  People. He uses them to ensnare the Doctor, in the hope of being released  from the Cheetah People's planet. Of course, this doesn't go to plan, and  it seems that they both are destined to be trapped on a dying world...  Doctor Who has never had a great deal of money spent on it during the first  26 years of life, but it was always the acting and quality of scripts that  always made the show enjoyable. And that is exactly the case here. McCoy's  whimsical, diminutive Doctor contrasts well with the ferociousness of the  Cheetah People and continual instability of Anthony Ainley's creepy Master.  While not perhaps the way people had envisaged ending the show, 'Survival'  still provides thrills aplenty.",968976000,,1080,4.731182795698925
