4123493,5,B003GXE9NW,I have always loved watching our wonderful hummingbirds and Alicia Brauns has captured the magic of these tiny gifts from God. My children and grandchildren have enjoyed watching this exquisite film and each of us has learned some hidden facts that we were unaware of.  A must see for all ages.,1271721600,3,294,4.764705882352941
4123494,5,B003GXE9NW,"I love watching Hummingbird Magic! I went to the Film Debut Dec. 2009 and I've been giving this DVD as gifts to family and friends ever since. I really like the feeding footage when the mother bird feeds her baby. And when the newborn tests its wings is amazing too! I'm an avid bird watcher, so I watch this video at least once a month to get inspired and relax. Alicia Brauns has captured the inner life of Hummingbirds with grace and beauty. Whether you're a bird watcher or not, you will be inspired!",1271721600,3,504,4.372340425531915
4123495,5,B003GXE9NW,"Alicia Brauns' Hummingbird Magic DVD is educational, but more than that it is truly exquisite and charming.  It is amazing how a creative person can, with the simplist of tools and in her own back yard, create such a minor masterpiece.",1271635200,2,235,4.7317073170731705
4123496,5,B003GXE9NW,"This is a dvd of the quality of a film done by The National Geographic Society.
We were so impressed that we brought copies for our grandchildren.  It is amazing that we can view one of God's creature so close up.",1271635200,2,213,4.195121951219512
4123497,5,B003GXE9NW,"Stunning, informative, a cleansing tonic for the soul, this aesthically beautiful documentary exposes the mysteries and secrets of the Hummingbird witnessed through outstanding photography,accompanied by music and narration. This documentary is an educational tool for students learning about birds, for bird lovers, and for all those people who have hummingbird feeders in their backyards and wonder about the amazing journey of the Hummingbird from egg to flight..
Sometimes I just enjoy watching the film and listening to the music...very soothing.",1271548800,4,551,5.9

8396613,3,B003GXE9NW,"I bought this as a gift for my mother who adores hummingbirds. My mom really likes it- And I liked it too, but I felt it was too short. Only 1/2 hour. Too expensive for such a brief show. The hummingbirds were cute, but I felt it was barely started before it ended.

This would've been better value if it were longer.",1417392000,,317,4.112903225806452
8396614,5,B003GXE9NW,This was a gift for my mother and she thoroughly enjoyed the video.  She has watched this many times and learned more about these beautiful birds.,1375142400,,146,4.615384615384615
8396615,5,B003GXE9NW,"I'm amazed how they were able to capture in such detail  the beauty and wondrous nature of these beautiful birds
I watch it while I'm spinning and must confess I'm transported to their private world
I've been to the hummingbird sanctuary in Costa Rica, but found it extremely  difficult to capture them in a photo
If you're a fan.. You'll thoroughly enjoy this DVD",1371340800,2,364,4.671875
8396616,2,B003GXE9NW,"i am shocked this won any awards. it is poorly filmed and there is some incorrect information in this film by an ""expert"", it stands out as obviously incorrect. on top of that it's only about 22 minutes long. no clue how this won any awards, my friends can do better work with an iphone and PC video software. disappointing.",1363996800,,324,4.416666666666667
8396617,4,B003GXE9NW,"This video is very good, but did not go into as much detail as some I've watched. Once you start watching these little wonders, you get hooked.",1354060800,,143,4.333333333333333
8396618,4,B003GXE9NW,"Great addition to the growing library of hummingbird video library.  Not my favorite, but worth the money for more video documentary of this amazing bird.",1325548800,,154,5.16
8396619,5,B003GXE9NW,"I bought Hummingbird Magic, along with a hummingbird feeder and hummingbird food. I packaged them together in a gift bag and gave it to my son's classmate at her birthday party. IT WAS THE BIGGEST HIT! Not only did the parents love it because it wasn't another useless toy that would collect dust in a month, but their child loved it. Who wouldn't love a movie about hummingbirds?  I bought 10 copies in the last year, 10 feeders with food, and every time my 5 year old is invited to yet another birthday party, I have the BEST present in my closet, ready to go.

Both my Children LOVE this documentary, too. The greatest feature is that you can chose to play it with or without narration. With narration, it is an educational tool about this precious creature. Without narration it becomes a gorgeous montage of nature edited to soulful, spiritual music. This documentary is nutritious eye candy for kids. Don't hesitate to buy it...",1274918400,14,934,4.654545454545454
8396620,5,B003GXE9NW,This video is a delight to the eyes.  Beautifully photographed and educational.  An amazing tale of the bird which I recommend highly not only for bird lovers but anyone wishing to see a tale well told.,1273017600,5,202,4.583333333333333
8396621,5,B003GXE9NW,"My family and I recently viewed this delightful and utterly charming visual gem. All of us and our friends, the young as well as the not so young, enjoyed it immensely and could not help but  insatiably watching it again and again  with increasing enthusiasm. Each viewing made us discover additional qualities. It takes much love for nature, much talent, patience, perseverance and commitment to produce a DVD of such genuine richness in contents and  incontestable  educational value, pictorially expressed with admirable sobriety . Our compliments to the author who brings a breath of fresh ear and love for the animal word into our homes. We will be looking forward to, and looking out for future works from this obviously talented filmmaker.
