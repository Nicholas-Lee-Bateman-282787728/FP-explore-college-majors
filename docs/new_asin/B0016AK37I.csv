3154713,5,B0016AK37I,"Ok, this season is dedicated almost entirely to the respawned ""band of seven"", with some other chapter not much related. As always, top-notch quality, image and sound crisp and clear, clear voices, proper subtitle size and color, and a nice ""digi-pack"" art decorated box. Also the front picture is the first one to actually give an hint to the season's main plot with Bankotsu's image, then again the other seasons didn't have one except short stories, searching for the shikon shards and fighting Naraku (nothig wrong with that). Viz is taking forever to reach the final chapters with these season boxes, many people may not whant to wait and just buy the individual volumes that are already for sale, wich is more expensive. We would have to wait some more to get the rest of the series, there are still 41 episodes to go, so next season box is going to be a bit large or very small if they are going to split it in seasons 6 and 7.",1221609600,2,934,4.5

3154719,5,B0016AK37I,I started watching the earlier episodes of the series when I found out Season 5 was being released. I love this whole series but the early relationship between InuYasha and Kigome is frustrating. I hate the episodes where he chooses Kikyo over Kigome. (Can you tell I'm not a Kikyo fan?) I pretty much fast forward through them. This season is so good. There are many cute moments between Kigome and InuYasha. The episode where he cry's and the episode with the river of fire are among my favorites. The action in this season is also excellent. There are no filler episodes for this season. The gang of seven are the best villains this series has had so far (including Naraku)! If you have made it too 99 keep going because you will be very happy with this one.,1217548800,5,761,4.482014388489208

3154801,5,B0016AK37I,"I for one don't like a lot of anime; but only have a select few favorites... one being Inuyasha. That is because I like Inuyasha for it's unique story and great cast of characters; not to mention the style and genre the anime fits into my personallity!

I mean they don't call this show a fuedal fairy tale for nothing you know! That's why I love it so much! It has lots of sword swinging action in fuedal Japan, romance between the 3 key characters Inuyasha, Kikyo, & Kagome; and a bunch of LOL comedy with the other characters! Plus this Season 5 has the ever so awesome Band of 7 characters; & my favorite out of them is their infamous leader Bankotsu! Jakotsu is just a bisexual freak; LOL! :D

Season 5 of Inuyasha is without a doubt my favorite seasons of all time! There are too many episodes to call my favorites; but when it all boils down to picking the best ones it's just tough! To name a all of the best episodes/moments are: when we first meet Bankotsu & he takes his sword back from the lords castle, when Renkotsu hands over the jewl shards to Bankotsu, Miroku uses his wind tunnel in Mount Hakurai to save Sango from Kagura's demons, Inuyasha strikes Jakotsu down, & when a frightened Renkotsu gets his shards taken from Bankotsu! But without a doubt, the episodes with the whole battle of Inuyasha & Bankotsu will forever be known as the best; & then Naraku finally appears with his new body! Naraku then finally takes Kikyo's life; hey she saw it coming... (to all of the Kikyo haters, LOL)! :D

Plus I think it's just great to have the entire Inuyasha Seasons on DVD; since you don't have to worry about having them recorded on your old VHS tapes! That is because I'm a collector; & I love having DVD's of all of my favorite shows & movies!",1255996800,,1760,4.376146788990826
3154802,5,B0016AK37I,"Ms. Rumiko's series rocks, I'm a fan of her work. Oh, and Sangos a total babe.

I just wish the entire story line, had been made, where Naraku finally gets whacked.
Maybe they'll get to finish it with original English and Japanese voice over groups.
Waiting for a sale to get last season made in series.  It costs a lot. Bought this one (fortunately for me) on sale.
If you got the money to spluge tho, hey go for.  It's excellent Anime/Manga",1252800000,,442,4.365853658536586

3154804,5,B0016AK37I,"There was no way I was waiting to get this season on sale!  Anyway, I meant that in my title line, this is the ""Empire Strikes Back"" season of Inuyasha, not only because you have the rebirth of Naraku, but also because in terms of comparison to seasons of Inuyasha, it is just that much better than the others!  No one gets killed off too quickly, the Band of Seven characters are fantastic, and the story arc is nice and long.
Since I didn't get this for special features, I don't feel I am qualified to rate anything about them.  Get this set for the episodes, not for the special features.  Watch the episodes in both the subtitles and the dub, because they are both worth watching.",1231891200,,685,4.3700787401574805
3154805,4,B0016AK37I,"The Inuyasha Fifth Season Box Set includes five DVDs, which contain the twenty-seven episodes that make up the fifth season of the anime.  The first three discs contain five episodes, the fourth disc contains six episodes, and the fifth disc includes six episodes and the special features.

Disc five contains two special features.  The first feature is labeled as, ""Inuyasha Special Footage.""  This piece runs for eleven minutes, and it basically explains who the characters are, as well as some of the concepts that appear in the anime series.  Most of the footage seems to concentrate on the second season, although there is one shot from the third season.  The piece ends with a lead-in to the fifth season.  I would assume this piece was produced to promote the fifth season of Inuyasha, even though it hardly used anything from season three, and completely ignored season four.  The only other special feature on the disc is ""Textless Ending.""  This includes the textless versions of both of the ending credits that appear on this box set.  The two endings have been put back-to-back as one piece.

This season of Inuyasha advances the story much more than season four did.  However, when you watch season five, you discover that one of the episodes of season four is actually very crucial to what happens in season five.  This season also sees some major character development for Inuyasha, especially the final two episodes in this DVD box set.  The fifth season also introduced the story arc with the Band of Seven.  This was a decent story arc, which ultimately leads up to the return of Naraku.  However, the final few episodes in the arc felt like they were being stretched out to make the story arc last longer.

If you're a fan of Inuyasha and want to have all the episodes on DVD, then you need to acquire this set.",1231804800,5,1830,4.7405063291139244
3154806,5,B0016AK37I,This DVD showed up in time for Christmas and was exactly what it said on amazon.  I bought this for a christmas present for my daughter and it made her christmas.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.,1231632000,,201,4.2631578947368425
3154807,5,B0016AK37I,"I had watched episodes of Inuyasha before but it was the episodes on this box set that made me a fan(well, technically it was the manga volumes with the band of seven but that's just splitting hairs) The band of seven episodes are the first real epic storyline in the series (other than the large over arching goal to find the jewel shards of course) previously storylines were somewhat episodic, a two parter here and a three or sometimes four episode mini epic like when Inuyasha fought Sesshomaru for the first time.  But this is a big epic saga of 20+ episodes all neatly tied together with the best villains Inuyasha has crossed blades with (not counting Sesshomaru, he really isn't much of a villain anymore anyway more of a dark counterpart to inuyasha)

Anywho, as I noted the band of seven is pretty cool.  I could make the point that they symbolize the seven deadly sins but then I would have to actually name the sins.  At any rate each of the band has a unique and distinct personality from the gluttonous Kyokotsu, the malignant Mukotsu and his poison, the split personality of Suikotsu and the mechanical nature of Ginkotsu.

 Of course my favorites are the ones that take the longest to kill.  Jakotsu, a character so effeminate he makes Sesshomaru look like Chuck Norris, steals almost every scene he is in what with his overly sexual ways of threatening Inuyasha.  Probably the funniest stuff i've seen in this season is when Jakotsu asks Kohaku if Inuyasha is handsome.  Kohaku, somewhat confused prefers not to opine.  Still, though, my favorite has to be Renkotsu.  Every time he is on screen he is working some angle to seize power and usurp Bankotsu.  His tricks and traps are many throughout the season.  I like him because he uses his brains(as well as some fancy by medievel standards technology) to kill his opponents.  Smart villains are always so much funner than dumb ones.

 Bankotsu the leader is a cool dude but over he seems too similar to one of the thunder brothers in season one.  Of course, you cant look down on a guy with a sword even bigger than Inuyasha's and especially not after the two duke it out in one of the best fight's in the series.

Anyway, I enjoyed this season very much.  How much?  I actually plunked down the ridiculous amount of money Amazon is asking for this thing instead of waiting for it to go on sale.  I picked up season 4 and 6 at Wal wart for 35 and 30 bucks respectvally.  But I just couldn't wait.  I'm an Inuyasha lovin' fool.",1231027200,8,2496,4.547085201793722
3154808,5,B0016AK37I,"Season Five was the first Season of InuYasha that I watched (Caught it on Adult Swim at 5:30 in the morning). Bankotsu (pictured on the bottom of the DVD box set) is such an interesting villian. He isn't just a hack-em slash-em mean talker.. he is almost a smart alec, and smugly confident in himself and his Banryu (big sword.. thing). Jakotsu was also a very interesting baddy.. and in love with InuYasha.. or at least in love with killing him.

Anyways... I enjoy the Naraku story line as much as the other InuYasha fans, but I really like it when Inuyasha's group fight villians that aren't directly related to Naraku, or born of Naraku's flesh. These guys were revived by Naraku, but are fighting for themselves... which makes for a more dynamic story line!

This season is well worth the price. I paid 115 for this season at Best Buy, so getting it for under 100.00 on Amazon is well worth it.. and you can get it shipped next day for fast viewing! Don't waste time on the individual DVDs with only 3 episodes on them! =)",1230249600,,1027,4.457446808510638

The only thing that I did not like about it was the seven brothers.

They were annoying and idiotic to no end. That's all that I have to say. :)",1282262400,,246,3.9
3389277,5,B0016AK37I,"Inuyasha is my all time favorite anime EVER! This season has to do with the band of seven and it was incredibly awesome! I also loves what happens with kikyo, but if you haven't seen it, my lips are sealed. A must buy!",1280880000,,218,4.093023255813954
3389298,5,B0016AK37I,"I for one don't like a lot of anime; but only have a select few favorites... one being Inuyasha. That is because I like Inuyasha for it's unique story and great cast of characters; not to mention the style and genre the anime fits into my personallity!

I mean they don't call this show a fuedal fairy tale for nothing you know! That's why I love it so much! It has lots of sword swinging action in fuedal Japan, romance between the 3 key characters Inuyasha, Kikyo, & Kagome; and a bunch of LOL comedy with the other characters! Plus this Season 5 has the ever so awesome Band of 7 characters; & my favorite out of them is their infamous leader Bankotsu! Jakotsu is just a bisexual freak; LOL! :D

Season 5 of Inuyasha is without a doubt my favorite seasons of all time! There are too many episodes to call my favorites; but when it all boils down to picking the best ones it's just tough! To name a all of the best episodes/moments are: when we first meet Bankotsu & he takes his sword back from the lords castle, when Renkotsu hands over the jewl shards to Bankotsu, Miroku uses his wind tunnel in Mount Hakurai to save Sango from Kagura's demons, Inuyasha strikes Jakotsu down, & when a frightened Renkotsu gets his shards taken from Bankotsu! But without a doubt, the episodes with the whole battle of Inuyasha & Bankotsu will forever be known as the best; & then Naraku finally appears with his new body! Naraku then finally takes Kikyo's life; hey she saw it coming... (to all of the Kikyo haters, LOL)! :D

Plus I think it's just great to have the entire Inuyasha Seasons on DVD; since you don't have to worry about having them recorded on your old VHS tapes! That is because I'm a collector; & I love having DVD's of all of my favorite shows & movies!",1255996800,,1760,4.376146788990826
3389299,5,B0016AK37I,"Ms. Rumiko's series rocks, I'm a fan of her work. Oh, and Sangos a total babe.

I just wish the entire story line, had been made, where Naraku finally gets whacked.
Maybe they'll get to finish it with original English and Japanese voice over groups.
Waiting for a sale to get last season made in series.  It costs a lot. Bought this one (fortunately for me) on sale.
If you got the money to spluge tho, hey go for.  It's excellent Anime/Manga",1252800000,,442,4.365853658536586

3389301,5,B0016AK37I,"There was no way I was waiting to get this season on sale!  Anyway, I meant that in my title line, this is the ""Empire Strikes Back"" season of Inuyasha, not only because you have the rebirth of Naraku, but also because in terms of comparison to seasons of Inuyasha, it is just that much better than the others!  No one gets killed off too quickly, the Band of Seven characters are fantastic, and the story arc is nice and long.
Since I didn't get this for special features, I don't feel I am qualified to rate anything about them.  Get this set for the episodes, not for the special features.  Watch the episodes in both the subtitles and the dub, because they are both worth watching.",1231891200,,685,4.3700787401574805
3389302,4,B0016AK37I,"The Inuyasha Fifth Season Box Set includes five DVDs, which contain the twenty-seven episodes that make up the fifth season of the anime.  The first three discs contain five episodes, the fourth disc contains six episodes, and the fifth disc includes six episodes and the special features.

Disc five contains two special features.  The first feature is labeled as, ""Inuyasha Special Footage.""  This piece runs for eleven minutes, and it basically explains who the characters are, as well as some of the concepts that appear in the anime series.  Most of the footage seems to concentrate on the second season, although there is one shot from the third season.  The piece ends with a lead-in to the fifth season.  I would assume this piece was produced to promote the fifth season of Inuyasha, even though it hardly used anything from season three, and completely ignored season four.  The only other special feature on the disc is ""Textless Ending.""  This includes the textless versions of both of the ending credits that appear on this box set.  The two endings have been put back-to-back as one piece.

This season of Inuyasha advances the story much more than season four did.  However, when you watch season five, you discover that one of the episodes of season four is actually very crucial to what happens in season five.  This season also sees some major character development for Inuyasha, especially the final two episodes in this DVD box set.  The fifth season also introduced the story arc with the Band of Seven.  This was a decent story arc, which ultimately leads up to the return of Naraku.  However, the final few episodes in the arc felt like they were being stretched out to make the story arc last longer.

If you're a fan of Inuyasha and want to have all the episodes on DVD, then you need to acquire this set.",1231804800,5,1830,4.7405063291139244
3389303,5,B0016AK37I,This DVD showed up in time for Christmas and was exactly what it said on amazon.  I bought this for a christmas present for my daughter and it made her christmas.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.,1231632000,,201,4.2631578947368425
3389304,5,B0016AK37I,"I had watched episodes of Inuyasha before but it was the episodes on this box set that made me a fan(well, technically it was the manga volumes with the band of seven but that's just splitting hairs) The band of seven episodes are the first real epic storyline in the series (other than the large over arching goal to find the jewel shards of course) previously storylines were somewhat episodic, a two parter here and a three or sometimes four episode mini epic like when Inuyasha fought Sesshomaru for the first time.  But this is a big epic saga of 20+ episodes all neatly tied together with the best villains Inuyasha has crossed blades with (not counting Sesshomaru, he really isn't much of a villain anymore anyway more of a dark counterpart to inuyasha)

Anywho, as I noted the band of seven is pretty cool.  I could make the point that they symbolize the seven deadly sins but then I would have to actually name the sins.  At any rate each of the band has a unique and distinct personality from the gluttonous Kyokotsu, the malignant Mukotsu and his poison, the split personality of Suikotsu and the mechanical nature of Ginkotsu.

 Of course my favorites are the ones that take the longest to kill.  Jakotsu, a character so effeminate he makes Sesshomaru look like Chuck Norris, steals almost every scene he is in what with his overly sexual ways of threatening Inuyasha.  Probably the funniest stuff i've seen in this season is when Jakotsu asks Kohaku if Inuyasha is handsome.  Kohaku, somewhat confused prefers not to opine.  Still, though, my favorite has to be Renkotsu.  Every time he is on screen he is working some angle to seize power and usurp Bankotsu.  His tricks and traps are many throughout the season.  I like him because he uses his brains(as well as some fancy by medievel standards technology) to kill his opponents.  Smart villains are always so much funner than dumb ones.

 Bankotsu the leader is a cool dude but over he seems too similar to one of the thunder brothers in season one.  Of course, you cant look down on a guy with a sword even bigger than Inuyasha's and especially not after the two duke it out in one of the best fight's in the series.

Anyway, I enjoyed this season very much.  How much?  I actually plunked down the ridiculous amount of money Amazon is asking for this thing instead of waiting for it to go on sale.  I picked up season 4 and 6 at Wal wart for 35 and 30 bucks respectvally.  But I just couldn't wait.  I'm an Inuyasha lovin' fool.",1231027200,8,2496,4.547085201793722
3389305,5,B0016AK37I,"Season Five was the first Season of InuYasha that I watched (Caught it on Adult Swim at 5:30 in the morning). Bankotsu (pictured on the bottom of the DVD box set) is such an interesting villian. He isn't just a hack-em slash-em mean talker.. he is almost a smart alec, and smugly confident in himself and his Banryu (big sword.. thing). Jakotsu was also a very interesting baddy.. and in love with InuYasha.. or at least in love with killing him.

Anyways... I enjoy the Naraku story line as much as the other InuYasha fans, but I really like it when Inuyasha's group fight villians that aren't directly related to Naraku, or born of Naraku's flesh. These guys were revived by Naraku, but are fighting for themselves... which makes for a more dynamic story line!

This season is well worth the price. I paid 115 for this season at Best Buy, so getting it for under 100.00 on Amazon is well worth it.. and you can get it shipped next day for fast viewing! Don't waste time on the individual DVDs with only 3 episodes on them! =)",1230249600,,1027,4.457446808510638

This boxed set contains one of the most exciting of the Inuyasha adventures: The Band of Seven.  Many years ealier the deadly Band of Seven - a murderous bunch of mercenaries were beheaded for their crimes. Demon Naraku resurrected them with the aid of the Jewel shards and Inuyasha and the gang have a difficult fight against them.  The adventure is extremely treachurous, and of course, Inuyasha must fight the leader of the Band of Seven - Bankotsu, who is the most dangerous of the seven.  Lots of dangerous is ahead, and even Sesshomaru, Inuyasha's half brother helps.  Great fun! Enjoy!",1222732800,,701,4.760330578512397
