8021752,5,B000244FDC,The Apollo 13 Movie was great brings back the real flight to me in April 1970 then i was in 10th grad watching it on tv & praying that the crew returned  home safe.,1418688000,3,164,3.823529411764706
8021753,4,B000244FDC,"The hour-and-twenty-four-minute APOLLO 13 - HOUSTON WE'VE HAD A PROBLEM was directed by Robert Garofalo, previously a creator of rock documentaries. Expansive, ethereal electronic music with simulated choral voices underscores the early part of this film. It gives way to a faint, ominous windy rumbling just minutes prior to the equipment crisis that nearly claimed the lives of Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert.

A title sequence montage includes JFK's ""We choose to go to the moon in this dicade"" (sic) speech and highlights of the July '69 Apollo 11 mission. Extensive post-splashdown press conference footage of the Apollo 13 astronauts and pictureless audio from it is used to explain events. All three men are seen in profile, with Lovell closest to the camera. From this angle, he looks very much like Kevin Costner. Jack Swigert, sitting between Jim and Fred Haise, comments on replacing Ken Mattingly just days before the mission's 4/11/70 launching.

Footage of stage separations and LM docking are spectacular. Fifty-five hours into the mission, an in-ship broadcast reveals the crew in good spirits. Lovell demonstrates that longer hair won't stay in place in a weightless environment.

An oxygen tank explosion occurred shortly after this video transmission ended. During the early minutes of the ensuing crisis, we see the crew, some 200,000 miles from home, and staff at Houston trying to sort out what happened, the extent of the problem and options for continuing or changing parameters of the moon mission. Practically improvised solutions arrived at under pressure ultimately proved to be exactly right. The dramatic balance of events is told through Houston Space Center clips, some TV news reports and that NASA meeting which starts the documentary.

The story of this ""successful failure"" plays out more incredibly than the most far-fetched fiction. Director Garofalo's re-telling of it, without a standard overdubbed narrator, is first rate.",1341187200,,2460,6.02

8021756,2,B000244FDC,"""Apollo 13 - Houston: We've Had A Problem"" has more flaws than the oxygen tank in the command module.  First the music score is not only boring and hokey, it's annoying.  I had to turn my bass down because of all the low tones in the music.

Second, it relies too much on slow-motion during just about the entire presentation and they have to tack-on corny music to go with it as if it were the second coming and not a NASA mission.

Third, there is no narration to speak of.  It would have been much better had Jim Lovell had narrated the whole thing instead of the director only relying on mostly black & white footage.

The features section has a speech by Jim Lovell.

I would recommend this only for the sake of having plenty of original footage.  Otherwise save your money and get the two-disc 10-year anniversary edition of the ""Apollo 13"" movie which is loaded with features.",1155427200,5,883,4.440993788819876
