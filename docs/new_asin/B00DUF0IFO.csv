5856174,5,B00DUF0IFO,"great movie, would recommend to anyone.

as with most movies, it is not for everyone, but it is for you if you have any taste!  : )",1392854400,,131,3.814814814814815
5856175,5,B00DUF0IFO,"It really makes a nice adding to your movie collection, this will be my favorite trilogy for a long time.",1389571200,,105,4.3
5856176,4,B00DUF0IFO,"In my opinion these movies are best watched in an impaired state. My 4-star rating was based on watching them while enjoying a couple of rum and cokes (at home/no driving involved/no kids present). Some hilarious stuff under those conditions. Under the cold, sober light of day they are not as funny. But we all know this. I'm not sure I helped the reader one way or another, but that's about all I've got to say without getting into spoiler territory.",1388880000,2,452,4.592592592592593
5856177,2,B00DUF0IFO,The Hangover trilogy is one of the most epic comedic cinematic experiences ever and this is how they deliver the set? It's a single case Blu-ray container... that's it. Very disappointed.,1386892800,,187,5.064516129032258
5856178,5,B00DUF0IFO,"If I could say I loved the movies. Good thing I watched before ordering. I was suppose to get it today, Dec 3, 2013. But nothing .. Come on Amazon if you say you will deliver on the day it was going to be release then deliver. Still sitting in Laurel Md since 2am. I live maybe 3 hours away in Virginia.

I got the movies a five star due the movies not to Amazon",1386028800,,362,3.8266666666666667
5856179,3,B00DUF0IFO,"This comedy franchise is now available in a box set. The picture and audio quality are superb for the sequels (although the original film could use a good remastering). While all previously released supplements are included with a new documentary (over 3 hours of total bonus content) it would have been nice to get audio commentaries and new featurettes for the top-grossing R-Rated franchise in history. The unrated cut of the original film that adds 8 minutes of dialogue is included. The first film is by far the best while the second seems like a remake. The third film veers off course and doesn't have that many laughs.

5856206,4,B00DUF0IFO,"Great purchase. This blu-ray trilogy of the Hangover films is comprised of 4 discs, housed in an amaray blu-ray case and a slipcase. The first 3 discs are The Hangover, The Hangover Part 2, and The Hangover Part 3. Disc 4 is an exclusive bonus disc: ""Wolfpack Only"" which is a collection of behind the scenes and other goodies.

Disc 1 is printed with cover art from the original film, while discs 2,3, and 4 are plain black discs with text on them, (which is standard Warner fare).

Picture quality and sound quality are really good, and for the price of around $10 for 3 movies (the first one is destined to be a comedy classic), you can't beat it.",1483833600,4,650,4.408333333333333
