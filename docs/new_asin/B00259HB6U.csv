I ""think"" the film depicts the dying moments within the mind of a young man who has suffered mentally with the guilt of having been responsible for the accidental death of his younger brother when they were innocent children. Much of the film has such a nightmarish dreamlike quality that is unnerving and uncomfortable to watch...but complelling...I found it difficult to look away from the portrayal of this character's (Chase) inner anguish which may have lead him to seek peace through suicide. Most of the scenes have an unreal quality to them more suggestive of a mental landscape. I might add that the film captures quite well the confusion and anxiety of  subconscious inner torment. The other  main characters can seem to work as dopplegangers to explain and portray Chase's psychic torture which he cannot let go of. It seems possible to view this film as a linear dream with Chase's symbolic dreams and memories interwoven to tell the story. I find the subject matter somewhat extreme and not personally meaningful which I why I limited my rating to 4 stars. They did a great job setting the tone and feeling of person lost and unable to cope any longer with his burden. Some may have a different take. I think I will have to give it another viewing...

It got to be a distraction rather than a clever gimic. Kristanna did a fine job, one of her best. The rest of the cast was mediocre.",1274227200,11,287,4.76

The acting was horribe, the movie jumped around confusing you & I wanted it to just end lol.. I almost turned it off a  few times, but I figured let me let it finish that just maybe there would be 1 good thing in this movie! It was not for me at all!! But everyone has to try movies for themselves- as we each like different things. Do not go by the trailer because that is what I did, as I sometimes notice trailers look amazing and they real us in then the movie stinks. I did give it a 2star because it did have a good point to it, like the darkness that life can take us through & what it can do to the mind & body & how far it can take people, I do not want to say to much and spoil alert everyone so won't say any more, but again it was awful but had a good point to it, if that makes any sense and if they did it better job with the movie and the acting it could of been Ok.",1512172800,,1023,3.671232876712329

8350951,4,B00259HB6U,"If you're a fan of the strange-film genre (David Lynch films for example) this film you'll like this, if you let all of the parts of it in.  Some say that the sanitarium scenes are distracting, to me they help the viewer keep one of the bigger parts of the story in focus. The grief and loneliness are played out in each scene much as in real life through the poor decisions and the desperation. What a great scene at 23 minutes left, I wished I'd been warned to pay better attention, there's really a lot of message here. This movie comes close to greatness because of the courage of the actors and some very good writing by Kristanna Loken and her co-writer/actors. Glad I watched it. You'll like it too.",1453680000,2,706,4.3893129770992365
