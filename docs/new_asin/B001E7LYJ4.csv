3546941,5,B001E7LYJ4,"Having been a Turtles fan in 1967 I can say this movie is so accurate it is uncanny.
I remember the Crossfires and the name change to The Turtles ... I remember the best band in the South Bay at the time! I remember The Turtles, Buffalo Springfield and Everpresent Fullness at the Third Eye in Redondo Beach, California. This movie is so cool and accurate!",1284163200,,356,4.409090909090909
3546942,4,B001E7LYJ4,"I was so pleased to ""discover"" this film. As a member of a high school ""cover"" band in the late 1960s playing Beatles, Turtles, Rascals, Trogs, etc., I've been fascinated to see how badly modern films are at capturing the real Sixties as I remember them. Dark, moody, intellectualized, star-struck recreations miss the key point - that we were young, dumb, talented and clueless. There was an enormous innocence that gets lost in translation. But not here. This time a real participant in the pop rock scene tells us what it was really like - and it rings true to me. Sure it's a low-budget film that lingers too long on scenes that may only be meaningful to nostalgic Baby Boomer garage band members. But this was a bold little film since, rather than layering on the rock legends, it throws aside the rose-colored glasses and the bull analysis of rock ""historians."" The point is that we were all in awe of the Beatles and, as this film points out, they and Jimi Hendrix, and Zappa, and the rest were all just young talented people who were lucky enough to hit a pop culture wave. The Turtles were among the most tuneful bands, not deep, but upbeat and well orchestrated and great on stage. They were not, however, as pretty as the fabricated Monkees or Herman's Hermitts or other B-level Beatle-imitators. They were not as hard edged as the Stones, Doors, Animals, etc. or as goofy as the Bubblegum bands to which they are often wrongly linked. They had bad management and broke up by 1970. But they were part of the powerful West Coast wave that washed back over England after the British bands influenced us (and they in turn were influenced by American 50s rock). The Turtles were a light-hearted balance to the angst of the Doors and fell apart before they turned dark. I admit I was fearful when I discovered that this was not a documentary, but a reconstruction of the young band in 1967. Those kinds of biopics are inevitably hard to watch. But somehow this film gets the casting right. The Turtles and other pop figures are truly realistic and (except for all the wigs) believable. This may be a problem for some who have canonized these pop stars into saints and have fallen for the performances they crafted onstage and in their records. But we have come to idolize their music and their public images which were, after all, performances. Underneath these were just normal kids and young adults. Howard Kaylan was there. He briefly had a seat at the table when the Summer of Love was a phenomenon and not a pop culture clich. If he says this was the way it was - I believe him. His Jimi Hendrix, a former American paratrooper and down-right nice guy, makes more sense to me than the sainted psychedelic version handed to us in black light posters since his death. Critics (like the one here who gave the film a low rating) who think THIS is the fake version, can't tell Hollywood from reality. Films like ""That Thing You Do"" and ""Almost Famous"" tap into the essential innocence of the era. It is an innocence that will never return - except for each generation of teens in the very fragile moment in their lives. We all get one shot at being naive -and that was true for the Baby Boomer generation. But before the bitterness and cynicism took over, we really did have a moment of hope. This film is about that moment,and the end of that moment. This is about how one pop band discovered that another pop band was human. Despite its small budget and big wigs and dragged out scenes - it is a more accurate work than most of the bigger films that care more about selling tickets than capturing the times and telling the truth.",1279929600,9,3636,4.5442073170731705
3546943,1,B001E7LYJ4,"I love the Turtles. I love Zappa, the Mothers, the Doors, Hendrix, and the whole 60's music scene that this film tries to portray. I read about this film a while back and when I couldn't get it at my local video store decided to buy the DVD. What a disappointment. Having watched Frank Zappa's movie 200 Motels and listened to the real life interactions between band members from the Turtles captured on the album Playground Psychotics, I know the people portrayed in this movie were interesting and funny. There is material here for a great movie about the LA and London music scenes. Unfortunately this isn't it.  The sets, clothes, acting, and writing seem like an extended skit from a bad TV show. The dialog consists of constant lines like ""wow I can't believe I'm smokin dope with Donovan!"" All the acting is awful but the worst are the guys who try to be Zappa and Morrison, unbelievably awful. I've seen more professionalism in high school plays. Its not even in the ""so bad its good"" category. There is nothing here worth watching.",1257465600,11,1040,4.6521739130434785
3546944,5,B001E7LYJ4,"At long last, the sixties as seen through the drug-addled orbs of a cat who was really there, living the high life with the Beatles and the Stones.
I first thought this was going to be a documentary...the Turtles released one in 1990 called Happy Together, so I assumed that this would be actual footage from back in the day.
BUT NO, my cats and kittens...
it is much, MUCH more than that.
First of all, it's a comedy, mostly, starring a bunch of fresh-faced kids in their twenties BEING the Turtles, the band from the sixties who were the first rock band to play at the White House. And while that particular story is not told in this volume, the author, Turtles' lead singer Howard Kaylan, has filled the screen for an hour and a half with enough stories to tell around rock and roll water coolers for decades to come.
It seems that fame was thrust suddenly upon Kaylan and his bandmates and we witness his early photo sessions,(with a moustached John Corbett playing Henry Diltz), we go backstage at the Whisky A-GoGo with their manager,(a suitable slimy George Wendt, and learn draft evasion from Frank Zappa's manager, Herb Cohen, (Curtis Armstrong).
The ordeal of prepping for the draft board exams, when both Howard (played by Acadamy Award nominee Justin Henry--Kramer Vs. Kramer), and Turtle partner Mark Volman (a wonderfully comic Jason Boggs) proceed to intoxicate themselves with abandon is only a set-up for the draft board sequence that follows...Taylor Negron is a standout here.
Where, I hear you ask, is Jimi?
Well, the title IS a bit deceiving.
But he's coming.
Not, however, before we meet Graham Nash, Donovan, The Moody Blues, Brian Jones, and, in an amazing scene, the Beatles themselves.
Folks, right here, you got your price of admission.
I promise, you will never forget that scene.
Brian Groh, the actor who portrays John Lennon, would face little competiton in an indie movie award show UNLESS...
he was in the same catagory as the gentleman who lets us into the very soul of Mr. Hendrix himself. The actor's name is Royale Watkins.
Write it down.
He is amazing.
The ending is a little fuzzy, as well it should be, going by Kaylan's recollections, but the movie is a total surprise and a five star gem.
It's all done on the cheap--you can tell that these folks found a great project and did it for a song...
and there are plenty of great songs in this movie too--the soundtrack should come out as a CD.
All in all, if you're at all curious...if you EVER wanted to live or RE-live the sixties, this is your movie.
(Note...there is quite a bit of casual drug use portrayed in the film without moral or social consequence, so if you have little ones, be advised.)",1247097600,11,2688,4.649159663865547
3546945,5,B001E7LYJ4,"I just watched this tonight; it's wonderful. Screenplay by Howard Kaylan based on the Turtles 1966 rise to the top & 1967 visit to London. It was touching & hilarious, get this one!",1246492800,2,181,4.515151515151516
3546946,5,B001E7LYJ4,"""Now this is a cheap little concert, and I am a cheap little guy..."" began Flo and Eddie. But before they'd end up post-Turtles, they'd have to live the tale. It's tacky and terrific; so's this micro-budgetted thing: really, really low budget, but damn if I didn't love the heck out of it.

The Turtles tell the tale(s) of being that ugly group that girls didn't chase, and deliver what amounts to a home-brewed story about tackiness, lip-syncing on tv and Zappa/Beatles/Hendrix and more.

Putting it together for $100 million dollars would't have made JIMI any more or less better than this cool indie feature. God bless Rhino for making it available! A far more satsfying thing to watch and talk about than many big budget things. AND a visit from Flo and Eddie is great!",1433980800,,773,4.676470588235294

3546950,5,B001E7LYJ4,"The sixties were cool, and this film actually puts you in that era, better than most other films. Good cast of some know actors also help along the story of The Turtles.

3546952,5,B001E7LYJ4,"Amazon wisely suggested this for me after I bought Howard Kaylan's new autobiography, Shell Shocked (great book, by the way).  It looked interesting and I certainly knew of all the principals, so I ordered it.

What a delight! All of the events in the film are expanded upon in Shell Shocked and to see them ""in the flesh"" as it were made them even funnier.  One of my favorite pieces depicted Howard's and Mark Volman's efforts to avoid the draft. Simply as storytelling it is hilarious, but for those of us who lived during the Vietman War era, it is hilarious and so very real.  I personally knew so many guys who used so many of the same devices to obtain the blessed 4-F.  Watching Howard and Mark do it made me smile (and laugh VERY hard).

The Turtles in London chapter of the film I just loved because I was/am so familiar with the players portrayed.  Who WASN'T a huge fan of The Turtles, Donovan, Graham Nash, The Moody Blues, Brian Jones and of course, The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix?  I really think one has to have a complete familiarity with these other musicians and their impact to really appreciate this film and the events depicted.  The Beatles are portrayed exactly as I imagined they were at the time.  Jimi Hendrix is portrayed as such a kind, modest and gentle soul - as he stood at the precipice of his own stardom.  I had always read such about him; it was nice to see it portrayed on film.

I was younger than my heroes depicted in this movie and therefore, these guys always seemed so very cool and floating above the rest of us.  This little film gave a different perspective and closer to what they really were:  young guys who were indeed very cool, but they were young guys just like the ones I knew - with all of the same insecurities, goofiness and hormones.

I guess the nicest thing I can say about this film is that it left me with such a smile and good remembrances of those wonderful times. There are movies that leave us with such and then there are those that illuminate and ""color in"" some pieces we didn't know about.  This one does both.

I am so glad I ordered it!",1369699200,2,2106,4.372750642673521
3546953,5,B001E7LYJ4,"This is an enjoyable movie as you get a panoply of cameos from several rock stars of the 60s.  Great flashback scenes of the Whisky in 1966 as well as the scene where Howard and Mark get out of being drafted at their induction.  This movie mostly takes place in 1967 when the Turtles hit the top of the charts with Happy Together.  They interact with Frank Zappa, Cass Elliott, Jim Morrison, Graham Nash (who looks more like John Phillips), Donovan, Brian Jones, The two (then) recent additions to The Moody Blues, The Beatles (great John Lennon scene), and Jimi Hendrix himself.  Any fan of the flower power era should see this film.  It is very gratifying.",1368576000,,658,4.589743589743589
3546954,5,B001E7LYJ4,"""My Dinner With Jimi"" (2003) is a great ""snap shot"" of counterculture times much better than other ""portraits of the 60's.""

The 60's (which actually took place roughly from 1964 through 1974) were interesting, hopeful times. You had to be there (and the screenplay writer, Howard Kaylan, was there) to understand it, why it was good, important, worth remembering.

And how it worked.

A lot of good things were done, and done because young people wanted to have fun with their adult lives after formal education, and not be chained, tethered to wage slavery or equivalent slavery always part of the ""entrepreneur"" life.

Most people face wage slavery or the entrepreneur's life, and that was true both before and after the 60's....

Almost nobody is a pure inheritor guaranteed big money, undisputed property ownership, and an important, interesting occupation until he dies, except maybe Prince Charles of England and a small number of people in his same situation.

The 60's suggested that other possibilities might happen in the lives of people who came of age back then, and that included entertainer people like Howard Kaylan of the TURTLES pop music group, and later part of the Frank Zappa band called THE MOTHERS OF INVENTION (for part of the 1970's).

The Howard Kaylan ""voice over"" actor states at the start of this movie...""When high school graduation came and went, I decided to put college on hold....and do something different!"" (I paraphrase).

Many decided to ""do something different"" or at least try it, and many had good results and times as a result.....

MY DINNER WITH JIMI (2003) is all about that, and for all it's shortcomings, is precious because of that, and worth getting and screening often.

The 60's were different, hopeful, and are worth remembering the way Kaylan has remembered it.....for all the technical and artistic shortcomings of this movie, the overall message and mentality shines through in a way other ""memoirs"" of various types of the 60's counterculture times and people mostly have failed to do.

BTW, this movie portrays the lives of two members of the 1960's pop music group called the TURTLES....Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman.

Actual movie/video footage of these two gifted comedians and vocal musicians performing astonishingly can be seen in two other videos about and part of the 1960's era.

One is titled THE TRUE STORY OF 200 MOTELS (1984) documentary by Frank Zappa about the making of his 1971 feature avant Gard movie which stars both Kaylan and Volman (they are more prominently shown than Zappa himself is...Zappa was behind the scenes most of the time).

The other movie starring Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman shown in their middle 20's is the actual 200 MOTELS (1971) movie itself.

Get both in addition to MY DINNER WITH JIMI (2003) to have the best portrait of the two TURTLES stars, one of whom wrote the screenplay for MY DINNER WITH JIMI (2003).

Well..........

I got a MY DINNER WITH JIMI (2005) 60's pop music nostalgia movie yesterday, and watched part of it before bedtime.

It's a docudrama memoir acted by modern (recent younger) actors about famous pop singers meeting each other during the 60's done by Howard Kaylan who was part of the TURTLES and later joined Frank Zappa's MOTHERS OF INVENTION.

Howard Kaylan (1947 - ) wrote an autobiographical screenplay produced in 2003....done on no money, promoted at minor film festivals, never a mainstream movie......

I liked it.

Obviously a very cheaply done movie (younger actors especially weren't ideal, and the direction wasn't wonderful, either), but the movie made it's points, and it made me remember the good old days I enjoyed so much, now long gone.

One had to think of the movie as sort of a Greek masked stage drama where the actors were sort of gross symbols of the people they were portraying.

The older actors (not many, since it was a movie about the ""youth culture"" of the 60's) were very good, few of them as there were.....shows how many old actors are out there willing to be in cheap, ""indy"" movies.

The TURTLES wrote the song titled ""You, Baby, Nobody But You"" which I heard the Mamas and the Papas sing, and the song is featured in the movie.

I got the lyrics for the song, and played it on my always handy and available ukulele before going to bed. GREAT SONG!

""A little bit of sunshine! A little bit of soul! And just a touch of magic! ""It's the greatest thing since Rock and Roll!""

Same mentality as THE LOVIN SPOONFUL and it's ""Good Time Music"" (""Do You Believe In Magic?"" etc.) Terrific, light, fun....brought back the good times, loud colors, etc.

One big problem presenting a movie about famous music and musicians of the 1960's is that copyright laws and claims make it almost impossible to include any of the music famous in the 1960's and mentioned in MY DINNER WITH JIMI (2003). Only the TURTLES music and hit songs are played, and other music is not presented, though clever ways are found to suggest such music.....

Movie titles were in the gaudy, noisy Peter Maxx style, which was great. Authentic for the times and re-visiting it.

The movie shows the protagonists meeting up with other famous pop singer types at nighttime food and after-hours joints in L.A. and London! A lot of banter light, air-headed, and fun, fun, fun, which was the main point of the times!

You had to be there to understand how great the 60's were, and it's important not to be bitter about how it all ended, promise unfulfilled......

Howard Kaylan's movie isn't bitter...it's fun...and so were the 60's at their best.

3546955,5,B001E7LYJ4,"Sometimes it doesn't pay to meet your heroes, (for them or for us). At other times it can be the most memorable moment of your life. For Howard Kaylan of the Turtles, (also known as Eddie from Flo & Eddie and from Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention), visiting the Speakeasy Club in London in 1967 proved to be both. `My Dinner With Jimi' is a nostalgic look back at the rise and fall of the Turtles, who hit the big time with the tune `Happy Together'. (That song made a strong impact. It received a lot of AM radio airplay, and it hit the number one slot.)

But fresh on the heels of that hit was the world tour, (or at least a visit to England), which saw our heroes prostrating themselves on the altar of rock and roll stardom in mod and swinging London. Upon arrival, the first people they met were Donovan Leitch and Graham Nash, who proceeded to share their ""stash"" with them, which included a pre-release copy of the Beatles Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. They began to think that maybe they had jumped in over their heads.

They then proceeded to the Speakeasy Club where they had their first encounter with celebrity letdown. The Beatles were in residence and John Lennon was his old nasty self, (which makes quite a counterpoint to the peacenik image he maintained in later years). But there the Turtles were, as sycophantic as they could be, and the more they kissed up, the worse Lennon got. The other Beatles were somewhat apologetic, but they had learned long ago that ""John was John"", and not to be tampered with. Maybe Mr. Lennon was pissed off because this was supposed to be the coming out party for the heavily McCartneyesque Sgt. Pepper's, which John only made a few contributions to. The story went that upon the death of their manager Brian Epstein, Paul began to take over the band, and that one day he called them all together to announce that he had written most of an album. The other two songwriters, (Lennon and Harrison), were forced to scramble, in order to come up with suitable material of their own.

But the Beatles were not the only rock stars in that nightclub. They met members of the Moody Blues and Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones, (who asked them for an autograph). But the biggest surprise was a sit down with Jimi Hendrix, (who was then not widely known in the United States, even though he came from here). The actor who plays this part, Royale Watkins, has Jimi down to a tee, (if portraying him as more focused, and a little less spacey, than the real Jimi was. But hey, they had a movie to run here, and only so much time to make a point). Mr. Watkins also looks a lot like Jimi, (which gave me the goose bumps.)

Jimi proceeded to party Mr. Kaylan under the table. But the dialogue itself was the fascinating part. Jimi complained about being relegated to the Chitlin' Circuit in the states while backing artists such as the Isley Brothers, Curtis Knight and Little Richard, (who he called a cheap ""puff""). (Mr. Kaylan only knew about Little Richard, prompting Mr. Hendrix to say that Mr. Kaylan had a great soul, but it was the whitest he had ever encountered.) But he had high praise for Mr. Kaylan, because the Turtles were great harmonizers. Jimi wished he could have sung like that, so  he tried to make his guitar do that for him. (I think he more than succeeded.)

Mr. Hendrix also went on to express his fears about the impending Monterey Pop Festival, which was to be the official American debut of the Jimi Hendrix Experience. (That group, for those of you who don't know, was made up of Jimi and two Englishmen, Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell.) Jimi asked Mr. Kaylan what is what like to be famous. Well, the rest is history, and we know that Jimi indeed got the answer to that question.

Jimi's three years at the top of the music business, (which ended in his death), and his musical legacy, (which consisted of only five albums released in his lifetime), have both combined into the guitar god myth that persists to this day. And I mean myth in the best way, as an embellishment of greatness, well deserved. The thing about this movie is that Howard Kaylan, at the time of their meeting, had no knowledge of Jimi's music. Their interaction was purely on a human level. He could see with his own eyes the adoration that the Brits felt for him, especially the ladies, so he knew there was something to it. (I am glad that Mr. Kaylan decided to share this story with the rest of us. It will certainly become a valuable part of rock and roll folklore.)

Before they left the states two members of the Turtles had other business to attend to. This involved reporting for military duty at their local draft induction center. They were coached beforehand on how to get out of it, (by acting gay, a little crazy, and showing up high and unwashed). The scene was actually quite hilarious. They received a 4-F designation, which allowed them to continue with their music. Other segments show the band's California days, which  included Jim Morrison of the Doors, (who opened for the Turtles), and Mama Cass and Frank Zappa, (eating at a local Deli). All-in-all this is a very entertaining, (and low budget), film. (It is mostly filled with Turtles music, so don't expect any Hendrix or Beatles.) But if you are interested in watching a time capsule, this is it. And the Turtles are really the point here. There was so much music in that era that many of the ""also-rans"" have been bumped to the sidelines, especially when they are compared to the top acts of the day. I think in this age of unlimited media access we can all make a little room for talent of this caliber.",1347148800,2,5636,4.517647058823529

Personally I was not a huge Turtles fan. Everyone loves ""Happy Together"" once in a while but generally speaking I never thought they were a particularly good band, to me they were just a bubble gummy pop band.
But this TRUE story - which is what makes it good! - about meeting Jimi and the Beatles and getting stoned with Graham Nash and Donovan and meeting Brian Jones etc, is very interesting.
And the Commentary track you can watch after you see the movie, featuring the director and Howard Kaylan of the Turtles is also very good.
So all in all, the movie and commentary are a lot of fun if you're a fan of the sixties and want to get a flavor of what it was like, particularly what it was like in the swinging sixties London.",1487030400,,935,4.258426966292135
