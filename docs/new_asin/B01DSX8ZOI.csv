7723618,5,B01DSX8ZOI,"My husband loves the Wallace and Gromit series, so when our son got old enough we started watching the Shaun the Sheep series to see how he liked it.  He LOVES the entire series - Wallace and Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, Timmy Time - all of them!  While we haven't had to buy the DVD for him (we have Amazon Prime and it's on there), we do own the others on DVD already.  This will be purchased for use in our portable DVD player and our son will watch 'the LLAMAS!' on repeat if we let him.  The clay-mation detail has certainly improved from the beginning days of Wallace and Gromit.  The story line is fun for all ages, but there is little in the way of dialogue, which is common through the Shaun and Timmy series.",1480032000,,714,4.182481751824818

8756787,5,B01DSX8ZOI,"My husband and I liked this one too, but the llamas are not as funny as the sheep are.",1517270400,,86,3.5789473684210527
8756788,5,B01DSX8ZOI,Loved the familiar faces/new characters. Always a hoot.,1515369600,,55,6.0
8756789,5,B01DSX8ZOI,"Shaun unwittingly goes to the dark side with three new characters, the Llamas, who manage to be disturbingly endearing while being completely maddening at the same time. This is another classic romp with the funniest script without a single intelligible word you can ever find. The brilliant animation and the phenomenally detailed sets combine with an endlessly clever storyline to make this a sweet, funny, crazy and deep - yes, deep!
As fun and crazy as Shaun can be, there is always simple, very human wisdom that can be found in all of the goofiness. This film is no exception. be sure to watch the extras on the DVD. They give a lot of insight into what it takes to make any Shaun the Sheep movie. Go, Aardman!!!",1501804800,2,718,4.6171875
