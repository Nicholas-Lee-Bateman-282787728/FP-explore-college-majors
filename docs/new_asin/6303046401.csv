When adversity and danger occurs, mankind will always seek refuge in close proximity with other humans.  The greater the danger, the closer humans will congeal with other humans.  You saw it during the Great Depression as disparate homeless people came together in ""hobo villages"" or ""Hoovervilles"" as they came to be known, so they could survive the unseen enemy of poverty.  You saw it during the 60's when joining a ""commune"" was all the rage among the young.  The poverty in this case was self imposed by a rebellion against a stifling middle class establishment.  You see it even today with the advent of the ""Great Recession"" of 2007 as young people move back in with their parents and disparate adults seek to survive through co-habitation with other adults.  This human nature can also be seen very dramatically in the formation of street gangs.  Call it communal living or call it communism, it doesn't matter so long as you don't confuse communism with totalitarianism.
This is a story of how one group of people, driven by abject poverty, came together to survive and prove once again that the whole or ""tribe"" in this case, is greater than the sum of its parts.

The ""ditch digging scene"", one you won't ever forget, starts out in chaos with picks and shovels flying around, surely somebody is going to get hurt. Slowly as the people learn their role, a rhythm establishes itself and the diggers are transformed into an unstopable living machine.",1367020800,,1539,4.82509505703422
