8417669,1,B00474B0P4,"If all I wanted to see was clips of drummers playing (I mean ANY drummer for that matter), I would watch them on youtube for free. Although all the drummers in this video are obviously great, it would be nice if some tips/tricks/instruction OF ANY KIND (as advertised, see above) was included. This is only a collection of clips with an intro from an overly zealous cheerleader who now owns the money you just spent. Save the money and buy a good hamburger instead.",1430265600,,465,4.5476190476190474
8417670,3,B00474B0P4,all in all this was worth the money - gives you a good variety of drummers to check out. NO VIDEO is going to teach you double bass drumming - you will need to learn this stuff by practicing at home. videos can help don't get me wrong....just don't rely on them to make you a better drummer just by watching them - you need to PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE!!!,1408233600,,356,4.173913043478261
8417671,2,B00474B0P4,"this dvd is something that i wasn't trill about , this is a dvd perfect for  people that are advance in drums and that are also play with double bass.",1359072000,,150,4.0
8417672,4,B00474B0P4,A good dvd for one who wants to take up double bass drumming and wants to see a pro in action.,1356048000,,94,3.5238095238095237
8417673,4,B00474B0P4,"Performances were incredible but as a single bass player learning to integrate the double bass into my playing I learned a lot from the following performances and clinicians.
Simon Phillips - Fusion drummer; great dynamics and Left Hand Drumming
Russ Miller - Session drummer; sixteenth note triplets
Jason Bittner - technique to build speed (beats per minute bpm), power and precision along with exercises to strenghen left and right foot equally.
Thomas Lang - stick control hand exercises and drills transfered to the feet with accents.  Amazing single and double stroke rolls (32nd notes)on a single bass drum.",1308182400,,614,5.26530612244898
8417674,2,B00474B0P4,"If you are looking for double bass lessons, definitely this is not the dvd you need. It's more like a preview of several hudson music dvd's, but you can only see a couple minutes of performances. Nothing awesome in this item.",1306886400,2,225,4.512195121951219
8417675,5,B00474B0P4,Brings you through the past years of drumming until this present day. It provides a great demonstration of how double bass drumming is done. this is a good product for people who want to learn how this concept is mastered. You'll enjoy every bit of it,1299196800,,251,4.478260869565218
8417676,2,B00474B0P4,"This NOT an instructional video--simply abbreviated clips of A-list drummers playing double bass drums from PREVIOUSLY RELEASED videos by Hudson Music. The cover of the artist's COMPLETE video is seen thereby slyly PROMOTED for about 10 seconds at the beginning of each drummer's clip.
With all due respect, Bittner and Portnoy share some valuable tips re: technique and explanation on HOW to at least get started playing double bass drums. (All props to Portnoy; his explanations are the best.) Lang, shares some history and  philosophy and Steve Smith...some close-ups of his foot technique (but no explanation on instruction or technique.) The others primarily just play...Simon Phillips--a superb double bass drummer--doesn't have the opportunity to say anything to the viewer--plus there are no shots of his feet playing--it's a song at a drum fest and that's it!

Shame on you, Hudosn Music, for promoting (on the cover)this as DOUBLE BASS DRUMMING, Ultimate Drum Lessons,FEATURES OVER 90 MINUTES OF DOUBLE BASS VIDEO LESSONS. Your products are usually quite good and your adverising honest.",1296432000,10,1097,5.409356725146199
