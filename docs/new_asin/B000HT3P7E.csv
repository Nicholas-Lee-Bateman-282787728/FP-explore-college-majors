2640523,5,B000HT3P7E,"I think this show has a lot of potential to be a really good show. The cast is funny and endearing and the premise is fun.

I missed the pilot and first few episodes. Finally I caught episode 5 (I think) and thought it was pretty funny. I think it has the potential to be great! Every character in the CBS show (5 in total) are likable but I must give extra kudos to the characters played by Alyson Hannigan (Lily), and Neil Patrick Harris (Barney). I may be biased towards my liking of Alyson Hannigan's Lily (due to her previous roles: American Pie Series, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) but she brings a charm and charismatic flair to the show. Also Neil Patrick Harris' Barney is GREAT!!! He basically plays a creep which I'm sure everyone is familiar with (because I know I sure am!). I find Barney hilarious!!! He IS that creepy guy at the club but that's what makes him lovable.

All in all this show has potential! As long as the stories, acting and writing keep up then I am definitely going to tune in! I think once people start getting to know the characters better, they'll start tuning in as well. Everyone always compares this show to ""Friends"" which didn't really get popular until after the first season. Hopefully, this show will continue to be funny and exceed our expectations.

If anyone needs an episode list -- here it is --

1. Pilot: When Ted's best friend Marshall proposes to his girlfriend, Lily, Ted realizes he'd better get a move on if he hopes to find true love.

2. Purple Giraffe: a desperate attempt for a second date, Ted invites Robin to a party he is throwing. However, she doesn't show up and he keeps throwing parties in the hopes she will finally arrive.

3. Sweet Taste of Liberty:Ted agrees to let Barney spice up his love life, and ends up on a crazy adventure of flying to Philadelphia, encountering the law and visiting the Liberty Bell.

4. Return of the Shirt:Ted's outlook on his continuing search for love is altered when he rediscovers a shirt that has not seen daylight in years.

5. Okay Awesome:Ted and Barney start checking out the club scene with their friend Robin, whereas Lily and Marshall try to participate in some more ""grown-up"" activities, as they draw slowly nearer to their wedding.

6. Slutty Pumpkin:Ted makes his yearly pilgrimage to the rooftop Halloween party in search of a girl dressed as a pumpkin who he met years ago

7. Matchmaker:When a matchmaker with a 100% success rate turns Ted away because he is not compatible with any of the available women in her database, he is still determined that he is going to find his match

8. The Duel: As Lily becomes more of a permanent fixture in the apartment, Ted feels like he is being edged out of the mix by his engaged roomies.

9. Belly Full of Turkey: Ted and Robin are surprised to run into Barney when they volunteer at a homeless shelter on Thanksgiving.

10. The Pineapple Incident: After being forced into knocking back 5 shots, so he will stop thinking, Ted goes on a partying rampage.

11. The Limo:Ted rents a limo to take the gang out to sample five New Year's Eve parties in a quest to find the perfect celebration.

12. The Wedding: Robin accepts Ted's invite to a friend's wedding, but thanks to Ted, the couple may never make it down the aisle.

13. Drumroll, Please: Ted finds a new woman at the wedding. They want to remember the evening so they don't exchange last names or numbers; but Ted takes a big fall when he tries to find out her name.

14. Zip, Zip, Zip: After agreeing to take things slowly and not have sex for a month, Ted and Victoria decide that they have waited long enough.

15. Game Night: A mysterious tape arrives for Barney from one of his numerous ex-girlfriends, and the entire gang watches it.

16. Cupcake: Things are going great with Ted and Victoria's relationship, but when Victoria is offered a dream job, they have to make some decisions.

17. Life Among the Gorillas: Marshall interns at the corporation where Barney works and finds that he is becoming a shallow jerk as he tries to fit in.

18. Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.: Robin asks Ted to come over to her apartment after 2 A.M., but he isn't sure if he wants to go ...

 19. Mary the Paralegal: Robin is nominated to receive an award for a news report and everyone needs a date to take to the show.

20. Best Prom Ever: Lily, Barney and Robin attend a high school prom

21. Milk: When a matchmaking company calls Ted claiming they have found his soul mate, he is forced to postpone his date when Lily asks for his help.

22. Come On: Ted tries to keep Robin from going on a camping trip so that she can spend time with him.",1158796800,9,4652,4.449941107184923

2640743,5,B000HT3P7E,"I'm not usually one to latch onto a TV show, for better word, even a sitcom. So, it amazes me, that when HIMYM came out in 2005, that I was initially drawn into it. As an adolescent, I watched the show, and as it came to an end, I never watched the last part of the series (an explanation to the children how Ted actually met the mother in true detail). We know she was a roommate of the once-girlfriend-of-Ted, Cindy. We know that Ted seemed to have more in common with the ""one"" than he did with Cindy, but more information was not released. Barney and Robin get married (and stay married for 3 years, in which many fights are had as the result of Robin's business travels, resulting in an amicable divorce, in which Robin decided she wasn't part of the ""group"" as she felt out of place with her ex-husband hitting on slutty woman and her feeling like she still has some attachment to him). We then see that Tracy (Ted's ''one'') is the bassist at the wedding of Barney and Robin. As the ceremony of the wedding ends, Ted announces that he is still going to Chicago, because he clearly cannot get the thought of Robin and he in a relationship out of his head. He abandons the thought of him restoring the house that he purchased, and goes to the train station to await the train that would eventually take him to Chicago. While he waits, he sits next to an older woman who keeps talking to him. While he describes the bassist to the older woman, she points out to a frustrated Ted, that the bassist (Tracy) is actually just across the train station hallway, awaiting a train of her own. Ted ends up staying in New York, and having 2 children with Tracy, marrying her, and staying together with her for 15 years, until Tracy's death. Ted is understandably sad at the loss of his wife, and isn't sure what to do. He spends the next 6-7 years focusing his life on his work and his children, before they encourage him to go back to the one he continuously talks about, Robin.

This show was not something that I initially thought I would watch, let alone what became one of my favorite TV-Series' of all time. I think it's mostly because, in a way, I can relate to Ted. As somebody who has had a fair share of relationships, and let's face it, some psychotic relationships thrown in there, I can relate to the story. I can see how Ted feels, I think a lot of people could. When it was written, it was made to be as if it was a comedy, with some seriousness thrown in for good measure, and honestly, I think it got a lot more reaction and run time than most shows that are like this (not naming names).",1450656000,,2599,4.293279022403259

I am not comparing quality of the two, just saying their concept is similar.  They both have a group of tight knit friends that you get to see grow up and fall in and out of love and so on.  The adventures in this show are very funny and the best part, in my opinion is Barney.  He is probably a sociopath, but he has hilarious one-liners.

Oh, that's the other thing, the inside jokes just keep coming back again and again.  Most of them really don't ever get old, probably because the build up to it is written quite well.

I did not see the original runs of the first few seasons and did not really catch on to the show until it was in syndication. So I decided to  catch up  on  what I had missed  by starting at the beginning. The main premise of the series, of course, is that Ted is telling his kids at some point in the future how he met their mother. After watching the pilot it becomes obvious that it is not going to be a short story. The best way to watch is to start right at episode 1, season 1, and work your way directly through episode by episode. This is one of those shows that has running gags and premises that continue throughout the series, so you will have a better understanding of some of the inside jokes as the series progresses. One example is the blue French horn that is seen in the very first episode and shows up again periodically, most notably in the series finale. The cast of the show work well together, and the writing is clever if not brilliant.",1443657600,2,1041,4.164179104477612

It was Legen (wait for it) Dary. I cannot believe we waited so long to watch it.  It is recommended for older kids and adults.  There are a lot of sexual references. You will fall in love with every single character on this show. I am sad to finish the last season and we have already gone back to see some of the older episodes.,1439683200,,489,4.083333333333333

To those who have been long time fans- go back and watch from the beginning.

2642162,5,B000HT3P7E,"I was initially pretty turned off -- mostly the laugh track and the predictable characters but after a while it kind of grows on you.. you start to sort of care about them and understand their motivations.

The (very) best part is the long story arc -- episodes will reference things that happened much earlier (or foreshadow things that happen much later) which they tie in pretty nicely.

I've been binge-watching which I think makes it better -- I don't know how it would be if I had to watch it every week (but luckily for you, you can binge-watch it without commercials!)",1417305600,,576,4.58252427184466

2642170,5,B000HT3P7E,"Awesome show all around. Always smartly scripted, with an excellent cast and direction. If you enjoy shows like The Big Bang Theory, That 70's Show, etc, you'll love this.

For newcomers, it's presented in a series of flashbacks, as 'Ted Mosby' explains to his 2 teen children, how he met their mother, 'Robin' (played by the stunning Canadian actress Cobie Smulders). Its one of those shows that ties each episode together, and quite seamlessly. So, to truly get it, you pretty much need to watch from episode 1 on, as they really can bounce around sometimes. Its great to see each episode in it's entirety, in HD, and commercial free... so much easier to follow than watching it on""tv"". I've given up on having any dish/cable system thanks to the variety of shows being offered now on amazon prime.... and this one in particular was a major influence on mailing my dish equipment back. Enjoy the series....its here, and well worth the time to watch, especially without all the annoying commercials (and missing content to make room for even more commercials!)",1416873600,,1061,4.861878453038674

The show is HILARIOUS. I love each of the characters and all the actors that play them are fantastic!!  They all complement each other so nicely, and are all witty and quick.  They feel like my 5 new best friends and it was great getting to 'spend' each day with them ;)  Neil Patrick Harris is BRILLIANT.  It's truly amazing how talented he is. For a comedy, lots of unexpected-s to keep things interesting.

I will say this is a VERY LONG series.  9 seasons at approx. 24 episodes each.  Well worth the investment of time!",1413676800,,790,4.3493150684931505

Its kinda spoil but after watching few episodes, I looked up the finale of the show and Im kinda disappointed. Why does it take 9 seasons to bring together two people who truly belong to each other.

2642367,4,B000HT3P7E,"HIMYM is a cleverly-written and well-casted parody of the 24-32 year old demographic. The premise (flashing back) is a viable vehicle for exploring a multitude of scenarios. This isn't a show I binge-watch; I use it as a light bit of dessert after an hour or so of intense shows like Damages or The Killing. HIMYM is not so light that it's moronic, but you will find yourself chuckling out loud at least once per episode---not guffawing, but chuckling. I'm glad I finally broke down and watched it, but the laugh track feels forced. My theory about laugh tracks:  If the writing is good and the lines well-written then no one needs to tell me when to laugh.",1402358400,,657,4.567796610169491

2642381,3,B000HT3P7E,This is an amusing TV show that passes time and is distracting enough to relax a person with too much to do.  It's not really believable in today's world but characters are well developed and performances are well done.  The story line goes on and on but is funny at times and there are occasional surprises.  I saw bits and pieces over the years but never really knew the beginning premise so am catching up while doing mundane chores.,1401926400,,436,4.493670886075949

Revisiting the first season makes crystal clear the role of Aunt Robyn in Ted Mosby's life in search for the mother of his children and the love of his life.

2642486,5,B000HT3P7E,"I missed the first season before I got hooked on this show. I'm really glad I went back and watched this. It makes certain other things make more sense, and ads significance to the rest. Perfect for sitting and watching many episodes at once.",1397779200,,242,4.5227272727272725

2642503,5,B000HT3P7E,"I only watched this show sporadically, but after seeing the series finale I decided I needed to go back and watch the entire series from the very beginning.  It's a good way to spend my noon hour.",1397433600,,196,4.297297297297297

2642505,3,B000HT3P7E,"I started watching this because I love Neil Patrick Harris.  Unfortunately, he is the best part of this show.  It seems like they are trying to hard and the script leaves a lot to be desired.  There's no good flow.  It's not horrible, I just find myself multitasking while it's on.  I do not pause it when I leave the room.",1397433600,,323,4.229508196721311

2642509,1,B000HT3P7E,"Just garbage.  Written for morons and acted in the style of a Disney channel show.  I have two spoiler alerts: 1) The mother is dead (so lucky for her, she didn't have to sit through b**l***t all the way through for a bj) and 2) If you think this a smart comedy then you are not one of the smart people.

2642521,2,B000HT3P7E,I could only get through the first two episodes of season 1. The acting was too scripted for me to be drawn in to the plot. It also wasn't very funny. I barely chuckled.,1397088000,,169,4.0

2642527,5,B000HT3P7E,"I was not a regular viewer of this show during the course of this series so I missed a lot of the storyline. But I watched the series finale and decided to watch the series from the beginning.  I was blown away with the smart writing and the precise development of each character, but mostly I was impressed by the vision of where these characters would end up at the end. To film the episodes of the dad telling the story to the kids early on so that they did not age....how did the writers even know that the series was going to last 9 years, let alone know the ending from the very beginning?! Wow!",1396828800,,601,4.181034482758621

Already removed it from my Watchlist.",1396396800,3,429,4.532467532467533

2642583,5,B000HT3P7E,"What a surprise this was when I found it on Amazon Prime. I don't know what I was thinking I was going to find, but it dragged me in like I was hanging with my close friends. At first I wanted the answer...How did he meet her? How dumb that they didn't tell me. Then it just reminded me of growing up and how fun it was, and how difficult it was. Take your time....but make sure to watch it.",1395964800,,391,3.9

2642588,4,B000HT3P7E,"As a whole, I enjoy this show and the cast of characters very much. The characters all have their own strengths and flaws as people, and it would be easy for nearly every person to find someone they relate to in some way.
However, there is a reoccurring issue in the show in the form of transphobic (specifically transmisogynistic) comments. I have become so enraptured in the show and thought it was amazing and then a joke about a woman with a penis was made, and it completely distracted me from the rest of the episode.",1395446400,,523,4.458333333333333

A lot of the humor is what I think of as ""guy humor"" about the shallowness of the dating scene and the search for a quick score.  Barney is the guy who will do anything for sex.  He's a cultural icon for the guy on the prowl.  But Barney is balanced by Ted, the cultural icon of the incurable romantic, the guy who is seeking his perfect soul mate,  And the title of the series, and the interludes of his future self talking with his two kids assures you that eventually he succeeds.",1395446400,,655,4.0859375

2642629,5,B000HT3P7E,"Hilarious and well-written, this show is also an honest take on the typical life of twenty-somethings.  Even though it's a sitcom-styled show, the characters are lovable and genuine.  Pulling no punches, it has something for every gender and most ages.",1394755200,,252,5.275

We had watched a couple of episodes over the years, and I wondered how someone could spend several seasons talking with his kids about how he didn't meet their mother.  The season quickly grew on us.

Like many TV series, the characters either grow on you or they don't .  Most episodes in the season were fun to watch.  A few were lame.  We've found it helpful to watch episodes in order, which doesn't always occur when we depend on our own weekly schedules and DVRs.  Thus, purchasing the full season has been helpful.",1388448000,,607,4.414414414414415

2642644,2,B000HT3P7E,"I never watched this show while it was on TV.  I barely heard about it, and the few things I heard, such as its premise, didn't interest me, so I gave it a pass.  But then, so many people recommended it to me, I decided to give it a go on Netflix.

So, I have to say, it was really, REALLY hard to get into it.  I mean, yes, the first season had some funny moments and interesting characters, but I found main character Ted Mosby to be so irritatingly unlikable that it turned me off all the time.  Whenever I started getting into the show the guy did something incredibly stupid, and not the kind of stupid thing that's funny, like what Friends' Joey Tribianni might do.  I'm talking about the kind of stupid thing  that makes you rage and despise the guy for being such an obnoxious jerk.

The only time I found Ted likable was in the penultimate episode of the season, and it was only because they forced all the other characters into being even more unlikable jerks, so Ted turned out to be the only straight man in the episode.  It all changed in the last episode, in which the plot involves Ted wanting to get back with the girl he likes (Robin) by trying to make a rain dance in order to summon rain and prevent her from taking a flight.  I was already increasingly raging at the guy's egotistical ignoring of everyone else's feelings and his constant attempts to turn the tides of fate to his side without any care for what others wanted, so when he ACTUALLY made it rain and the episode treated that as a good thing, I said ""That's it!  I'm through with this stupid show!""

But then...

The episode ended into sort of a cliffhanger.  Ted got to be with Robin despite the fact that he did not deserve it, but his best friend Marshall got abandoned by his fiance Lily, and I felt really sad for him, since he was the only character I felt sympathy for.  So I decided to give the second season a go, at least to see if there was some justice, the tables turned and the guy who really deserved to be happy (Marshall) got his happiness back.

And something completely unexpected happened.  From season two on, the show was AMAZING.  Everything I hated from the first season was gone and everything I liked returned in droves.  Ted was no longer a jackass, Robin was no longer useless, and everone showed new interesting sides to them.  Heck, even that stupid rain dance scene was actually retconned to be just a coincidence in later seasons.  Plus, the show was now really FUNNY.  Season one had some laughs here and there, but rarely anything laugh-out-loud funny.  Since the first episode of season two, though, the show has been hilarious.

I don't know what happened.  I don't know if the first season was written by someone else, or whomever wrote it realized it was crap and decided to make it all better later, but I can tell that every season I've watched non-stop since the first once (I'm at sixth right now) has been absolutely amazing and truly deserving of a 5-star rating.  So, I say, while it's impossible to ignore the first season if you intend to get the story, everything becomes much, much better later and it's worth to go through this rough start in order to get to the next, impeccable seasons.",1382400000,,3221,4.416949152542373

I can't imagine anyone talking to their young kids about hopping from one affair to another, strip clubs and other immature shenanigans.

The series is about a group of immature friends in their 30's, whose main pursuits in life are hanging out in a bar drinking, playing dumb pranks on each other and looking for someone to ""bang"". This word ""banging"" is the most used word in their dialogue, especially the self-indulgent, narcissist, womanizing Barney. Other words and phrases used in almost every episode are; slut, ""no fatties"", threesome, hot chicks, B**bs, and many more I am not allowed to post on Amazon. Sex seems to be the only subject these friends are interested in doing or talking about.

OK, it is occasionally entertaining and not the worst comedy on TV, but overall fairly dumb with quite unlikable airhead jerky characters.",1355270400,4,1089,4.844086021505376

2642792,5,B000HT3P7E,"How I Met Your Mother is one of those shows that remains funny no matter how many times you see it. Trust me when I say this because I've seen this season 10+ times, and continue to rewatch it to this day.

I'm often asked what it is about HIMYM that makes me love it so much and the answer invariably comes back as ""the cast."" Everything about this group of characters is perfect. I see Marshall and Ted together and they genuinely act like friends that have been together for years. I look at Marshall and Lily and find myself wanting a relationship like their's. I see Barney and believe he really is this womanizing suit lover. I see Robin and I actually do see a person obssessed with her job. The creators did a phenominal job casting this show and episode after episode proves it.

There are many ways of describing the type of show HIMYM is. It is a comedy. It does have some very tender moments. It is wacky at times. Those things are true. But there's an intangible that this show has that others lack...heart. I haven't cared about a group of characters this much since Scrubs. I constantly find myself comparing my group of friends to HIMYM's. I watch this show because it portrays events in life we all go through in a relateable way. In a way that isn't forced to be funny.

Season one introduces us to the characters. We see Marshall propose to Lily in the very first episode. We see Ted profess his love for Robin on their first date. We see Barney...well...be Barney. As the series goes on it only picks up steam and gets better. It's as if the creators knew they had to make us care about the cast, and once they did that, they ran with it. We really want to see Ted find his soulmate because he is such a good guy. Yet, when everything ultimately fails, we still care. And when he does the rain dance on the roof to try and get Robin, we root for him. When Lily leaves Marshall and Ted finds him sitting on the front steps holding the ring, your heart breaks for him.

Season one is a great season with tons of memorable episodes, a season that lays groundwork for the show to only get better. With one of the best casts on TV, HIMYM is must watch TV.",1326844800,,2170,4.2725060827250605
2642793,1,B000HT3P7E,"When I was younger and it first aired it was good for a couple of laughs, now that I've grown up a bit and watched more television and discovered what my humor is and what type of shows I enjoy, I can safely say that I cannot stand this show.
Some of my friends are huge fans, and I will admit that one thing that puts me off the show even further is the hypocricy of them going off at me for not enjoying it while it's suddenly a taboo to ask them why they do not even try the shows I like, rather than just outright saying it's a poor series.

I really wanted to enjoy this series. It has an actress I really enjoyed in Buffy, a show I was really into before I found the show again after a few years and decided I didn't like. I wanted to find the jokes funny, and I wanted to enjoy the story.
But I couldn't, I found the jokes cheesy, I felt that the creators were just trying to make another ""Friends"" and the continuity of the show was one thing I could not let past, I cannot enjoy a show with as many continuity errors as this. I have been reffered to as one with a case of OCD and I will not disagree, which might be why the lack of continuity is just so painful. I can accept that others enjoy this show but I cannot get myself to enjoy it.

I admit that I have not sat down and watched a DVD of it, but I have seen enough of the show to have seen repeats on television multiple times. I just think this is a poor quality of television.
You can get angry in the comments and call me stupid for- god forbid I don't like a television show- or you can tease me for what I enjoy.
Go Ahead, Buffy, Weeds, Monk, Anime and much more, I don't care as I realise that posting this will upset the people unintelligent enough to be hurt that I don't share their opinion.

I suppose I can see why people might enjoy this for a laugh at some silly jokes, I admit I've giggled once or twice while watching it, mainly often due to my brother not allowing me to watch anything else and me waiting to pounce on the remote to put a DVD in. But the story I cannot see being enjoyed. I feel that the premise has been made redundant to the rest of the show, there is no reasonable storyline due to the disgusting continuity issues and I have only enjoyed 1 show with canned laughter ever- that of course being Friends. I feel the jokes are stale, and the bad jokes are blown over the top while the decent ones are shoved down and hidden around and I find it way too easy to dislike the characters. And the acting- no, don't get me started, I only enjoyed Alyson Hannigan's performance but that might just be a bias from Buffy

In conclusion I think that this show is wildly overrated, and I feel that from the original premise it probably could have been a truly great show, but it has far too many faults to get to that point, and I believe it's gone past the point of being saved.
And I apologise for any people who I may have offended in this, and I apologise for anything that may have not made sence or the high chance of one of my points in here being half completed, I'm running on no food and very little sleep.",1325808000,10,3106,4.045528455284553

It's one of the best shows on television, and the first season is the best of the series.  However, the DVD seems to be put together in a very amateur way.  To start, while the show was originally aired in 16:9 aspect ratio, the DVD crops off the sides to create a 4:3 aspect ratio known as ""fullscreen"" (or ""foolscreen"") before everyone had 16:9 widescreen TVs.  In addition, much of the music from the original show has been replaced with different songs on the DVDs.  The original broadcast music fit perfectly with the show, but when watching the DVD, it feels like something is missing.

Despite the drawbacks of the DVD, I'd still recommend Season 1 of How I Met Your Mother because the show itself more than makes up for the DVD's shortcomings.",1304467200,2,895,4.487654320987654

""How I Met Your Mother"" begins with a premise that this is a man (Bob Saget) telling a VERY long story to his children about how he met their mother. The children are in several intros at the beginning of the series and then gradually vanish. Once you've established the premise that this is a story from one person's perspective and is occasionally made up of stories they've been told from another person's point of view...it's all fair game for silliness. Like if one of them tells a story about sneaking out of the apartment by jumping from a three story window and landing on the ground with cat-like reflexes. This is a friends situational comedy with elements familiar from ""Friends"" and ""Seinfeld"" like this is a group of five friends who always gather at the same social place where they can have beverages and talk about their problems and mingle with others.

Ted played by Josh Radnor is a hopeless romantic architect and hopeless in general. He's a total girl. He blows it on a first date with Robin the news anchor (Cobie Smulders, what an awesome name which she totally earns in the pilot) right away by confessing his love for her which weirds her out royally. What comes out of this is she joins their friend group for the rest of the series while Ted pines away for her which is an annoying waste of time since Bob Saget always refers to her as ""Aunt Robin"" aka NOT the mother. Ted's best friend and roommate is Marshall the lawyer played by Jason Segel who proposes to his girlfriend of nine years in the pilot, Lily played by Alyson Hannigan from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" Marshall and Lily are an adorable married couple and give the rest of us a normal place to view the others from most of the time. They are great friends of Ted's but are also like his parents giving him advice, commands, and criticism. Since you can't have a show without a wacky fifth wheel guy, in waltzes suited up Barney brilliantly played by Neil Patrick Harris. He is the entire reason to start watching this show as his comedy is the best element in it, especially here in season 1 where others are still finding themselves.

Ted is obsessed with Robin all season except for a brief hiatus with a pretty cupcake maker that he tries to have a long distance relationship with in Germany (By the way, as someone who has LOTS of experience shipping internationally -- cupcakes would NOT arrive perfectly in a care package like they do in this show!!). That poor girl never had a chance. Ted is totally in love with someone till they aren't directly in front of him and then those creeping doubts show up and swarm him.

In Season 1, you can learn more about how Lily and Marshall met, find out how, when, and why Barney first suited up, and see Robin's most humiliating moment, but there are two things you won't find out: what Barney does for a living and who the mother is. Since I saw season 5 first and decided to start back at the beginning, I already know that no one knows who the mother is in season 5 either. It'll take a while so might as well enjoy the silly ride.

Bonus Features:

There is audio commentary on select episodes, early ones have cast members all together goofing off reminiscing the good times and later ones have show creators and members of the band who wrote the little diddy that is the theme music and won't stop mentioning their band. Might as well pimp their MySpace page while they're at it. ""First Round"" is a series of quick funny moments and many high fives put to music (PROBABLY by the same band that does the intro), ""Happy Hour"" is a blooper reel that includes the green testicle Ultimate Frisbee story that everyone keeps laughing at and Jason Segel's cell phone goes off among other stuff, and ""Last Call"" is just the same as ""First Round"" but different silly moments.

""Happy Hour"" is the video yearbook for the freshman year of the series where the creators talk about how one of them based the couple off himself and his wife and the other based Ted off himself. They discuss casting for Ted (""Josh was...handsome enough"") and how Josh apparently nailed the ultra mushy monologue at the end of the pilot and the casting director asked if he'd marry her. I think I just threw up in my mouth a little. As much as I enjoy love stories, when it gets super mushy and unproductive as with Ted, I get annoyed. They actually had to wait for Jason Segel since he was attached to another sitcom at the time and the creator's wife would only be ok with a character being based on her if she was played by someone sweet and funny like Alyson Hannigan. They loved Cobie for her confidence and ability to sparkle wonderfully in close-ups. They wrote Barney as a heavy-set ""Animal House"" type and didn't have NPH in mind, but he auditioned with extraordinary energy in the laser tag scene knocking things over and they gave him the part.

They apparently get lots of angry comments about the Ted and Robin romance since she isn't the mother but defend themselves saying that isn't the story they wanted to tell. Ted's need for perfection and obsession with love apparently needs to take a journey through pursuing a relationship with Robin (spoiler: He does not chill out by Season 5, he is still nuts).

The over arching story is how Ted met his wife, or how Ted met the mother of his children. I get the vibe from the show, is that it is like ""Friends"" but the characters are cooler and funnier.",1280534400,,453,3.9347826086956523
2642856,5,B000HT3P7E,"How I Met Your Mother is a hilariously funny show and after watching the first season, I was hooked.  The premise of the show is of main character, Ted, who is recollecting and sharing stories to his kids on how he will eventually meet their mother.  So the year is actually 2030 but he is narrating the story on the adventures of when he was in his mid-twenties.

Obviously, the meeting their mother part will never come until the series ends but so far, so good.  Each episode is another adventure on the mischievous times he had when he was in their mid-20's. Sharing his adventures are his two roommates, Marshall and Lily, best pal Barney and on and off again love interest, Robin.

The setting is similar to NBC classic sitcom FRIENDS where there is a group that hang out too much at a local joint, in this case, a dive bar.  They are also living in NYC.  Each character is hilarious in their own right but how can you not just love Barney played by Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser M.D.)!

2642862,4,B000HT3P7E,"Every winter during the holiday hiatus when there are no new episodes being broadcast of any of my shows, I always try to knock off two or three shows that I've not seen but have had some curiosity about.  Now, I detest sitcoms.  Hate, hate, hate!  I loathe laugh tracks.  I consider them toxic and vile and completely destructive.  And in most cases I hate how stilted the sets are and how unimaginative the camera work is (no sitcom in the history of TV has had interesting camerawork, and I say that even though Karl Freund, one of the great geniuses in the history of cinematography, directed many episodes of I LOVE LUCY).  I watch a lot of TV, but I avoid sitcoms like I avoid infectious diseases.  I love comedy, mind you.  I love 30 ROCK, PARTY DOWN, THE OFFICE, and MODERN FAMILY, all of them comedies and none of them sitcoms, and all among my favorite shows.

So why did I try HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER?  Mainly it was because I'd seen a number of TV critics who stated that it was a good show despite being a sitcom.  Part of it was Alyson Hannigan.  BUFFY is my all time favorite show and if you love BUFFY you love Willow.  Interestingly, I don't know a single person who watches the show (at least to my knowledge) and I pretty much decided to give it a shot despite the whole sitcom thing.  Surprisingly, I liked it.  A lot.  Not as much as 30 ROCK and PARTY DOWN and THE OFFICE and definitely not MODERN FAMILY (which might be the best new comedy since ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT), but it was still quite good, with an enormously likable small group of characters.  The laugh track is indeed irritating and, of course, completely unnecessary.  And what is more, it isn't a pure sitcom.  It does a surprising amount out-of-the-studio shooting (though on what anyone who is a serious fan of TV will recognize as the Warner Brothers urban lot, which has been used in hundreds of movies and TV series).  The street shots are on the precise same sets that were used for Metropolis in THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK and New Haven in THE GILMORE GIRLS and the area around the Pie Hole in PUSHING DAISIES.  Plus there are a surprising number of green screen shots.  So the show avoids the static feel that most three camera sitcoms have.  It isn't visually interesting, though it is less bland than, say, TWO AND A HALF MEN.  There are all kinds of ways that the show breaks established rules in minor ways.

Despite the somewhat static visual dimension of the show and the nauseating laugh track, this is a pretty decent show and now that I'm caught up all the way through the first half of Season Five, I fully plan on continuing to watch in the future.  The two things that make the show work for me are the cast and the writing, which despite the well traveled genre.  I like that the cast consists of two unknowns (Josh Radnor and Cobie Smulders)at least at the start) to go with three well known actors (Hannigan, Neil Patrick Harris, and Jason Segal).  I love all five characters and they are all sensational individually but also tremendous as an ensemble.  And the writers manage to keep their stories interesting and ever new by a string of fascinating developments.  I am especially impressed by Neil Patrick Harris, who probably had his career set back by a decade by his Doogie Howser days.  (Which reminds me that another reason I took up the show was because of how much I enjoyed Harris in the title role of DR. HORRIBLE.)

I'm still not a big fan of sitcoms and I doubt if I'll be adding many to my viewing roster in the future, but this is the big exception.  I think the show would have been greatly improved if they had tweaked it only slightly.  I know they have tied the show to stage sets to keep the budget down.  And the format means that the lack of visual experimentation means short set ups and keeps costs down.  The point is, I detest the genre, but I still like HIMYM.  Which I think speaks volumes for the quality of the show.",1261785600,,3959,4.4110344827586205

2642875,5,B000HT3P7E,I agree with most of what has been said by the other reviewers.  This show is one of the best on TV right now and Neil Patrick Harris deserves to win an Emmy for his role as Barney.  I think this show is the best for people that are around 30 years old because so much of the show is relevant to us.  I definitely recommend this show to anyone in that age group that likes to laugh!  Season one is great at introducing all the characters and getting you to like them and get into the story right away.,1258848000,,501,3.98
2642876,5,B000HT3P7E,"It's been awhile since I have found a ""new"" show on TV I like. So admittedly, I am a late-comer to How I Met Your Mother. I just recently started watching in 2009. After watching a few episodes and being really intrigued, I decided I had to watch from the beginning with Season 1.

As I got more familiar with the characters, I came to appreciate just how perfectly the show was cast. The characters are all unique in their own way and their quirky friendships with each other feel genuine. Their interaction feels so familiar, like it's the way I interact with my own friends. Of course I don't meet with friends in the bar below my apartment every night, so it's not exactly the same..

Ok, moving on, another reason I really like the show is the main character, Ted (Josh Radnor), is an actor I have never seen in anything else before. So I have no preconceived notions about him, which makes his character more believable. It's kind of annoying how a lot of shows recycle the same actors from previous shows. It's hard to let go of those character's personalities and quirks from other shows. Anyway, Ted is a neurotic buffoon obsessed with finding the right girl and getting married. He's so honest and geniune but has a knack for scaring girls off for those very reasons. It's fun to watch as he struggles to find love, as his diverse group of friends take turns encouraging and discouraging him.

Now that I have said all that, I have to contradict myself. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris, from Doogie Howser and some other movies) is amazing on this show. It's incredible how he is morphed into this ultra cool guy the last several years after being a geeky boy genius in the late 80s, early 90s. But although his character is ridiculously over-the-top sometimes, he really resonates with me. There's always a guy just like him in every group of friends. The womanizing, cocky, condescending ass who always has a plan. Without him, no one ever goes to the club or on crazy adventures. So let me say now that its ok for supporting characters to be recycled as long as they re-invent themselves. And I will conclude by saying that I love Season 1 of How I Met Your Mother and strongly urge to watch it as soon as humanly possible if you have not yet.",1256601600,,2252,4.50122249388753
2642877,5,B000HT3P7E,"This is a very original series! Very fun and funny! This will make you laugh and cry at times. Alyson Hannigan and Jason Segel play the dream relationship, funny and in love. Neil Patrick Harris is an incredibly shallow, womanizer.",1250467200,,231,4.8
2642878,5,B000HT3P7E,"How I Met Your Mother is a blend of some other shows, such as Friends or Seinfeld, but to me takes the good points of each of those shows and makes it's own type of show.

It centers on Ted (the semi neurotic architect), Barney (the ladies man business man), Robin (a local newscaster) and the married couple Marshall (lawyer) and Lily (teacher).

Through flashbacks and hints on ""How I Met Your Mother"" that starts and ends the shows to introduce and summarize the shows, with some twists, the group find themselves in sometimes awkward and usually very funny situations.  Though it could quickly turn into strained comedy, it somehow avoids all of that and makes each episdode humorous as the back story to why each charactor is acting or reacting in a certain way gets filled in.

I want every character on this show to be my best friend (except Robin).  They're funny, caring, and awesome.  The actors truly have tons of chemistry, providing a quality show in a half-hour block.

This is no generic sitcom.  Sure, it's got a laugh track and some of the banter is clich&eacute;, however, most of it is incredibly witty and heartfelt.  Ted is engaged in a genuine search for love, and I'm completely wrapped up in it.  I fell in love with the Cake Girl (Victoria, played by Ashley Williams) and was sad to see her go (it's probably why I'm not a huge fan of Robin).  This show has continuity and a compelling storyline; it simply amazes me.

It's very quotable.  I find myself quoting with friends I've talked into watching it (who get equally hooked).  The cast is brilliant, as well as the director and writers.  Bloc Party's song: `This Modern Love' at the close of Season One clenched it for me though, dramatically building up a powerful finale I won't soon forget.  It joins the hall of fame for greatest season finale songs with the likes of The O.C's: Imogen Heap `Hide and Seek' and Grey's Anatomy's: Snow Patrol `Chasing Cars'.

Hands down, this is the best sitcom I've ever seen.  Buy it, watch it, love it.

2642943,5,B000HT3P7E,"How many TV comedies can be called ""Feel-Good"" shows? More and more comedy on network TV is about misery. Failure. The bitter, cynical realities that allegedly lurk behind the bright, shining happy endings we've all grown up with. The generation that created and continues to embrace Reality TV prefers to look at the lives of others and say ""Thank God that's not me"" than to look at the world through someone else's eyes and say ""Gee, I wish that could be me.""

""How I Met Your Mother"" looks like a conventional sitcom with its multi-camera shooting style and it sounds like a conventional sitcom with its omnipresent laugh track. But there is nothing conventional about this show. Ted, Marshall and Lilly have been best friends since the first week of college. Now an architect, a law student and a kindergarten teacher respectively, their relationships haven't changed that much, with one notable exception. Marshall and Lilly are engaged and in the light of their wedding preparations, Ted starts to wonder if he's ready to settle down. Then he meets Robin, a beautiful, independent TV newscaster...who is completely wrong for Ted in every significant way. Add to the mix Barney, Ted's confirmed bachelor-for-life friend who insists that he is an expert on meeting, seducing and abandoning women. But throughout all the missteps and bad hookups one thing remains: Heart. It's a show about people who love each other and that makes all the difference.

The cast includes popular favorites like Jason Segal (""Freaks and Geeks"", and the writer/star of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and Alyson Hannigan (Willow on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""). Barney is played by Neil Patrick Harris, and after seeing him in one scene, you won't even be thinking the word ""Doogie."" Also on board is Bob Saget (""Full House"") who narrates the show as Ted in the year 2030 telling his children the story of how he became the man he had to be before he could meet their mother. Now, it might seem like this gives away the ending of the story, but any true sports fan will tell you that there's more to a baseball game than who won and who lost. Life is a journey, not always an easy one, and this is a show that celebrates getting there as opposed to being there.",1216425600,4,2241,4.7881136950904395

The actors did what they could, but the stories were run-of-the-mill, the writing uninspired, and it simply was not very funny.

Also the basic setup, where a guy is talking to his future kids about ""how he met their mom"", but it quickly becomes clear that we'll probably never find out who their mom is... not a good idea.

2642949,4,B000HT3P7E,"""How I Met Your Mother"" is a wonderfully heartwarming and humorous show rehashing the courtships and surroundings of a late 20s early 30s man named Ted Mosby as part of an overarching story arc of a future Ted Mosby recounting to his future children regarding how he met their mother.

The stories are wonderfully shot, and brilliantly rounded by a diverse set of characters played by Alyson Hannigan, Cobie Smulders, Jason Segel, Neil Patrick Harris, and Josh Radnor.  The individual episodes are cleverly linked and tied together, with foreshadowing and callbacks ranging through complete seasons.  The writing is punchy, and the humor is tailored to easily fit with each character, never feeling force.  It's enjoyable, heartfelt, and intelligent.

However, the transfer to DVD has one small problem and one really big problem in it, from my point of view.

Small problem is the menu system does not allow for consecutive playing of the episodes without returning to the menu.  I consider this feature a must for TV shows transferred to DVD.

The biggest problem I have is that they changed much of the scoring and music selections within the shows.  Instead of containing the songs and music from the broadcasts, they have been replaced by unknown and less evocative music.  For example, in the episode ""Drumroll Please"" they replaced ""You Don't Knom Me"" by Michael Buble for this heartwrenching romantic scene with some neutral generic waltz music...detracting from the scene considerably.  In the same episode, the final scene was originally done to Pavement's ""Spit on a Stranger"" which brought lovely color and climax to the finale of the episode, but on the DVD, it was another generic piece of music.  I imagine these were cost saving measures to prevent paying royalties, but it lessens the greatness of the show...and the show really is great.

For this transgression, I have penalized the DVD one star for taking a great show and not keeping it intact during the transfer to DVD.",1204934400,4,1992,5.018237082066869

2642974,5,B000HT3P7E,"So, I know the official review kind of touched on this, but I wanted to put in my two cents. HIMYM is like the perfect combination of 'Friends' and 'Arrested Development.' If you loved either of those shows you will LOVE HIMYM. It has the sitcom/ comraderie feeling of 'Friends' with the sophisticated humor and season after season long jokes of 'Arrested Development.' The writing is so smart and well thought out. With many sitcoms you can find plot holes where the comedy comes first, but Carter Bays and Craig Thomas (creators/writers/exec. producers) have orchestrated such a clean, tight show that I have yet to discover any huge plot holes. (Not that I would stop watching if I did find any, but you know what I mean.) The way they play with time and the story-telling is truly genius. Please reference 'The Pineapple Incident' as an example (an awesome, awesome episode!). They have perfected the art of making a sitcom interesting and alive again.

2642975,4,B000HT3P7E,"Ever since FRIENDS called it a day I haven't really been tuning in to much TV sitcom stuff. HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-and-a-Half-Men-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JOHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two and a Half Men - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;are just about the only sitcoms I've kept an eye on. Of the two, I like HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER just a bit better. I think it's got more heart, and it's certainly introduced ""Awesome!"" back into prime-time vocabulary. Anyway, its season one hooked me in.

That same old premise: a bunch of friends wending their way thru life and love in N.Y.C. Ted Mosby (the pleasant looking Josh Radnor) is at the heart of the show, the idealistic, wide-eyed romantic and our point-of-view character. Lily (BUFFY's Alyson Hannigan) and Marshall (FREAK & GEEK's Jason Segel) are the cute couple and Ted's roommates. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) is the subversive buddy, and, c'mon, it's always nice to have one in the pack, right? Robin (beautiful Cobie Smulders) is the newcomer to the gang, and the dangling romantic interest for Ted. Most of the characters dwell in an apartment right above a bar, so you can imagine where they most hang out.

This series uses a gimmick in which, in the year 2030, an off-camera older Ted (voiced by Bob Saget) tells his future kids how he met their mother. It's taking a really long time for Older Ted to tell this story. Sweetness and snarkiness consistently hobnob in these episodes. From Ted's old-fashioned romantic leanings and Lily and Marshall's steady relationship to Barney's casual immorality and narcissism. The show even makes effective use of quick comedy cuts ala FAMILY GUY. But the big question is, of course, will Ted and Robin ever get together?

Just check out the cast episode commentaries, and you can tell these folks like each other. Even though the main story arc centers on Ted, this is pretty much an ensemble cast. Everyone gets a slice of the spotlight. Radnor, Smulders, and Hannigan are fine, but, to me, the two people who stand out and provide most of the humor are scene-stealers Segel and Harris. Jason Segel's character is a sweet, good-natured, shambling kind of dude, a looming kid at heart who also does a mean robot. Well, okay, his robot sucks. But dude's funny.

An indispensable ingredient to the show's success is the energetic and smarmy Neil Patrick Harris (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doogie-Howser-M-D-Season-One/dp/B00076YOZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doogie Howser, M.D. - Season One</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harold-Kumar-Go-to-White-Castle-Unrated-Extended-Edition/dp/B00068WOH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (Unrated Extended Edition)</a>). The show's creators had originally imagined Barney as more of a manic Jack Black type, but Harris' gung-ho audition apparently made them do a swift one-eighty, and the rest is ""legendary."" Now I can't get all these Barney-isms out of my noggin, from ""Suit up!"" to ""Have you met Ted?"" to, yes, ""legendary."" Old Doogie, more than anyone else on this show, keeps the season-long romantic arc from being too saccharine.

ANGEL fans might be stoked to see Amy Acker guest star in one episode (""Come On"") and Alexis Denisof, who's Hannigan's hubby in real, appear in several episodes as Robin's co-anchor Sandy Rivers. Also memorable is Ashley Williams as Ted's cool culinary girlfriend Victoria.

Even though the show loses steam in the later episodes - and I felt the final episode underwhelmed (Rain dance? Really?) - the dropoff isn't that significant. And, throughout, HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER retains its heart. Several standout episodes are the ""Pilot"" ('cause it's the friggin' pilot), ""Okay Awesome"" (the sub-title show), ""The Pineapple Incident"" (Ted gets drunk, but remains ""vomit free since '93""), ""The Limo"" (trapped in a limo with crazy Moby), and Game Night"" (the origin of Barney).

HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - SEASON ONE includes ""Video Yearbook"" (the 20-minute-long behind the scenes featurette) and ""Happy Hour"" (9 minutes worth of outtakes, and pretty funny). There are cast & crew audio commentaries on six episodes, and here's the thing: If you're looking for insights and background into the series, then select the writers' episode commentaries, although these cats were kind of boring and annoying. If you want comfy camaraderie with random babbletalk, then select the cast commentaries. You don't learn much from the cast, but they were fun to listen to.

Wait a mo. There is one thing I learned from the cast commentaries: That ""Saba Homayoon!"" is not only the name of an extra in the pilot but apparently is also what one reflexively howls out when seeing a beautiful girl.

2642997,5,B000HT3P7E,"As reality shows continue to flood the airwaves, seemingly crowding out traditional shows, every so often a fresh and inventive show comes along proving that when done right, the sitcom can still provide good comfort television. ""How I Met Your Mother"" is such a show. Created by Carter Bays & Craig Thomas, who (along with their band, The Solids) also performed the show's infectious theme song ""Hey Beautiful,"" HIMYM stars Josh Radnor as hopeless romantic architect Ted Mosby, who regales his kids (in 2030) with the ""legendary"" tales (told in flashbacks dating back to 2005) leading up to how he fell in love.

Radnor, who I equate with Zach Braff's John Dorian character of NBC's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scrubs/dp/B00005JNEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scrubs</a>, really puts himself out there in the role of lovelorn Ted. Jason Segal and Alyson Hannigan are especially great as Ted's soon-to-be-married pals lawyer Marshall and teacher Lily, who as far as I'm concerned, rank as TV's most adorable couple. Cobie Smulders is just fine also as lovely TV news reporter Robin, who the gang playfully tease for being canadian and vice versa, plus the hilarious Neil Patrick Harris as ""suited up"" womanizer Barney. Only Harris could pull off this guy and make him somewhat likeable. One of my favorite exchanges between Barney and Lily is in ""Mary the Paralegal"" where Lily voices her disgust with Barney [for seemingly setting Ted up with a hooker] with ""Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low but sadly for you, it's just a new middle."" Instead of being offended, Barney proudly raises his chin and grins. Too funny.

While the show hews pretty closely to the formulas of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friends/dp/B000H6SXMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friends</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seinfeld/dp/B00005JLEX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seinfeld</a>&nbsp;and even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonder-Years/dp/6305053987/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonder Years</a>, How I Met Your Mother quickly formed its own rhythm, and in its own right is an original which I always look forward to watching.

Kudos to CBS for airing a show about intellingent people trying to make it, not middle aged miserable people who hate their spouses and their kids (again Everybody Loves Raymond and its clones that CBS was and airing for so long...).

Ted and his best friend Marshall are old college buddies and share an apartment above their favorite bar, MacLaren's. Lily also went to college with Ted and at the start of the series has been dating  Marshall for eight years. Barney is a single guy always on the prowl. He met Ted at MacLaren's. One fateful night, Barney uses his wingman line, ""Have you met Ted?"" to introduce Ted to Robin, and the story begins.

I would never have thought that a plot which is based on the totally unrealistic assumption that teenage children can patiently sit around to hear from their father telling them with every detail (for hours) how he met their mother, can be so good and hilarious.

2643047,5,B000HT3P7E,How I Met Your Mother is the best new sitcom in quite a few years. The only other sitcom I currently watch regularly is (since Arrested Development was cancled) Scrubs. Though I find many things funny I almost never laugh out loud when watching tv. I truly consider a comedy episode a success when I laugh out loud once during an episode. This show does not disappoint me at all. Though at some points it looks like it is about to go into another sitcom plot that you can easily tell the conclusion of it always goes onto another path at the last minute. In this truly lies the brilliance on How I Met Your Mother...that and Neil Patric Harris of course.,1172188800,,654,4.368852459016393
2643048,1,B000HT3P7E,"Okay, so my brother got me season one of ""How I Met Your Mother"" for Christmas, and swore it was the best comedy on TV.  I was willing to give it a shot; I'm somewhat of a Jason Segal fan from his Freaks and Geeks turn and we all know how funny Neil Patrick Harris can be (witness his scene stealing performance in Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle).  So I had reason to expect an enjoyable program.

So what's the verdict?

When I was 17, I had an infected wisdom tooth pulled out and my mouth swelled and oozed pus for a week. I could only eat Gerber's baby food and fluids.  All in all, it was the most crappy experience ever.

Until I watched ""How I Met Your Mother.""

If we lived in Ancient Rome, I was Emperor Commodos and I was watching this in the Colisseum...I would have given thumbs down to the whole proceeding with the hope that gladiators would come in wielding maces and destroy the bar and the apartment sets, where 99% of the show seems to take place.  However, had this show really existed way back then, the Roman Empire would have collapsed a lot sooner than it did.

Evidently, Some mad scientist pinpricked Jimmy Fallon's pinky, fertilized an egg with his DNA and out popped a fully-formed Josh Radnor, the lead actor of this show. Cloning Dolly the sheep was bad enough, but this is an affront to all ethics and morals, let alone good taste.  One small step for man, one giant leap BACKWARDS as far as comedy is concerned.

The uninspired, trite, and obvious comedy writing doesn't help, but it might have been surviveable had the characterizations been at all passable. But it is impossible for me to relate to these people. Self-absorbed narcissism was funny on Seinfeld because that was an irreverant and funny show, nobody was meant to like those characters.  But here, I would never want to be associated with these people in real life, let alone watch caricatures of them on TV.  It's Seinfeld without the humor.  And in case you were wondering, the humor was about 99.99999% of Seinfeld.  So what that means is that HIMYM is .00001% as funny.

Apparently, I am the lone dissenting opinion on this show, since every other Amazon reviewer raves about it.  I'm okay with that.  After all, Aristotle was ostracized for being the only person who thought the world was round. Not to say that I'm much like Aristotle--I don't wear togas.",1171843200,23,2362,4.517647058823529

2643062,5,B000HT3P7E,"How I Met Your Mother is a Friends-like comedy about five twentysomethings (Lily, Marshall, Ted, Robin, and Barney) in New York. Lily, a kindergarten teacher, and Marshall, an aspiring attorney, have been together for the last nine years and in the first episode they become engaged. Ted, an architect and Marshall's roommate and best friend, has been looking at their perfect relationship for the last nine years and decides that it's time for him to find his own someone special. Barney, who wears suits just about everywhere, is Ted's other best friend and the most hilarious character on the show. And finally Robin, a tv news reporter, just joins the group when Ted decides that she might be the one.

The story is told from Ted's point of view and the show is basically a love story in reverse. In the year 2030, Ted is telling two teenagers the story of how he met their mother beginning with the escapades he and his friends had in the year 2005. The five of them hang out at MacLaren's (their Central Perk) and try to navigate planning a wedding, finding a soul mate, and having legendary moments on a day to day basis. Each episode brings us closer to finding out who the ""mother"" is, but it's left to the viewer to wonder if the woman in question is Ted's wife or if these are even his kids.

How I Met Your Mother is easily one of the funniest shows on television right now. Each episode is full of hilarious one-liners, and Barney's lines alone are enough to make you laugh out loud. I don't know how I missed this show the first time around, but I'm grateful it's on DVD. If you're in the mood for easy laughs with witty humor, I'd definitely recommend How I Met Your Mother.",1171152000,22,1689,4.48051948051948

2643097,1,B000HT3P7E,"I am a huge fan of this show.  I think it's extremely well written and I love all of the actors.  These DVDs really do not do the program justice.  They contain almost none of the original music from the aired episodes.  It is all replaced with crappy filler that sounds like something you'd hear in an elevator.  CBS only played for 2 real songs because they were necessary to the story.  The music that they used to replace the original sounds like tracks that would come with iMovie because they are free to license.  The lack of music makes some scenes just plain awkward at times.  It seriously hurts the moments.  The episodes completely lack the same emotional punches as the ones that aired.  For example in ""The Slutty Pumpkin"" the perfectly placed Nada Surf song ""Inside of Love"" is gone and the episode's ending feels abrupt.  In the episode ""Okay Awesome"" most of it takes place in a dance club.  The cheap music that is now used feels completely out of place.  The original episode sounded like they were in a club, the replaced music is just strange an unfitting.  I was really disappointed by this because I really enjoy this show and wanted to introduce friends to it using this DVD set.  It's just not the same.  I'd rather watch the episodes on the internet now.  The picture may be blurry but at least it's the real show.",1167436800,148,1340,4.4937759336099585
2643108,4,B000HT3P7E,"How I Met Your Mother is the best sitcom to hit CBS since the King of Queens. Plus it's the best show about friends....since Friends. Every episode Ted (Josh Radnor)tells his children a story that is supposed to lead-up to how he met their mom. But he never actually gets to how he met their mom which is kinda funny in it's own right. Even if it's obvious that we probably won't learn who he married until the series finale which hopefully is a few years from now.

  Anyway this season mostly has Ted trying to find the one after his best friend Marshall asks his g/f Lilly (Alyson Hannigan of Buffy fame) to Marry him. His friend Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) ""who he wonders why he's friends with in the first place"" has weird scheme after weird scheme to pick-up women. One joke that I never get tired of, is when Barney taps a random girl on the shouler and says ""have you met Ted ?"". Which actually helps him talk to the woman of his dreams one night. She's a news reporter named Robin (Cobie Smulders) on a channel nobody watches. After awhile they decide to just hang-out since he wants something serious and she doesn't.

  The show is refreshing and fun with a good cast and if you miss Friends I strongly recommend that you watch this. Neil Patrick Harris does a good job getting his career rolling again with this show. He's a real scene stealer. Which is another good reason to watch the show. Hannigan and Smulders are both really good reasons to watch it too. Since they both are really cute. Plus as an actor I never saw before Josh Radnor does a good job as the lead of the series. His date scenes can be pretty funny and maybe a little insightful too. Since if you're guy you should probably never say or do what he does.

First of all, full screen instead of wide screen?  Major flaw.  I saw the episodes in widescreen format originally, so I'm not used to this full screen presentation.  There's no reason I can see why this set is not in widescreen.

Secondly, and I'm sure it has to do with money and copyrights, but a TON of music in the season is changed.  Nada Surf's ""Inside of Love"" from ""The Slutty Pumpkin""?  Yeah, gone.  And that song fit the ending for the episode so perfectly.  The song in its place doesn't do the moment justice.  Additionally, Chumbawamba's ""Tubthumper"" is eliminated from the scene where the group eats in Lily's apartment/Chinese restaurant.  Sure, the Belle and Sebastian song and others that were written into the script are there, but it seems like everything else is changed.  CBS: If you're going to put a song in an episode for when it airs and don't plan on getting the rights to it for the DVD, don't put it in at all!

2643115,5,B000HT3P7E,"I have to tell you, I'm something of a t.v. snob.  I haven't really enjoyed a half-hour comedy since Titus was cancelled.  All the dramas on t.v. seem to be doctor, lawyer, or cop shows (boring).  And I'll set myself on fire before I'll waste time on a ""reality"" show on one of those prime-time game shows.

So I was delighted to discover this little gem of a show on CBS's Monday night lineup.  I initially tuned it because 2 of the 5 regular cast members were on two of the greatest t.v. shows ever: Alyson Hannigan from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Jason Segel from Freaks and Geeks.  And I was just as surprised as anyone else when I soon realized the real scene-stealer was Neil Patrick Harris.  Barney Stinson is a classic character, and it's a crime if Harris doesn't nab an Emmy nomination.

It must be hard to come up with fresh material for a sitcom. . .but somehow, the writers manage to pull it off.  Plus, the cast easily has the best chemistry since ""Friends"" (rivaled this season only by the cast of ""The Class,"" another criminally-underrated show).  Marshall and Lily (Segel and Hannigan) are TV's Best Couple.

But let's talk Emmy's again for a second.  ""Drumroll, Please"" is not only the season one highlight, I would rank in in the top 10 sitcom episodes EVER.  In case you missed it (SPOILERS), Ted meets a woman at a wedding, and the two spend a perfect evening together while vowing NOT to see each ever again.  You have to see it to get the full impact, but it's funny and touching and very original.

Several people have complained about the DVD's being released full-frame.  I don't personally own a widescreen t.v., and I don't know anyone who does.  If it's that important to you, record the shows off the air. . .if you can afford a widescreen t.v., you can surely get a DVD recorder or DVR or whatever.

This show is compared to Cheers and the Wonder Years.  Difference between the Wonder Years and How I Met Your Mother, The Adult Kevin Arnold voiced by Daniel Stern tells the stories his early teen years from 12-16 from 1968-1973.  How I Met Your Mother tells the story about about fifty-something Ted Mosby voiced by Bob Saget tells the story about how he met his mother to his teenage kids and his adult years in 2006. Mostly the show revolves arounds five friends Ted Mosby, Marshall Eriksen, Lily Aldrin, Robin Scherbatsky and Barney Stinson.  It will ruin the show, it the Adult Ted Mosby doesn't reveal the mother.  When I look at Ted Mosby and Robin Scherbatsky they're like the couple from the movie The Last Kiss Michael and Jenna.  Jenna who was having a baby girl with Michael and Michael is an architect trying to find his place.  Alyson Hannigan came from a long way from playing Willow Rosenberg and Michelle Flaherty in American Pie.  Some of her Buffy Alumni guest starred in how I met Your Mother, Alexis Denisof who played Sandy Rivers who always hitting on Robin, Amy Acker who plays Penelope the one who helps Ted make the rain dance and use to go out with Barney and Tom Lenk the nerdy coffee House guy who was hitting on Lily. I never have to worry about her being typecast. Alyson Hannigan has the greatest resemblance of Alias Star Jennifer Garner and Michelle Trachtenberg.  Tell you the truth, she ever played Agent Sydney Bristow from Alias, Elektra Natchios from Daredevil and Jenna Rink 13 Going on 30 she would have done it better.  Even Ben Affleck could mistake her for Jennifer Garner.  Josh Radnor looks like T.V.'s Ed Justin Long and Scrubs Zach Braff. Jason Segel has the greatest resemblance of Smallville's Tom Welling who played Clark Kent. Cobie Smulders has the greatest resemblance of Mission Impossible III's Michelle Monaghan who played Tom Cruise's fiance Julia Meade and Smallville's Kristin Kreuk who played Lana Lang.

2643134,2,B000HT3P7E,"I love this show.  It's one of the best written and best acted sitcoms in years.  I've been anticipating this box set since CBS mailed the pilot on DVD to select magazine subscribers.

Imagine my disgust after finally purchasing the box, and discovering that Fox decided to only release it in pan and scan format, literally costing us a third of the action.  There is no excuse nowadays for releasing a DVD of a show shot in 16:9 HDTV in 4:3 format.  If you want to get a copy of this series, either track down the widescreen versions, or wait for Fox to come to their senses and release this set done correctly.",1164326400,12,612,4.380530973451328
2643135,1,B000HT3P7E,"The 1 star is for the dvd release, NOT the show!

Why, oh why, Fox has released this only in FULL-screen?!

Seriously, the widescreen & HD version looked so good, why would anyone want a cr*ppy full-screen version?

That's just plain stupid...",1164240000,15,243,4.738095238095238
2643136,1,B000HT3P7E,"In a similar way they ruined the first season of HOUSE on DVD,the idiots in charge of How I Met Your Mother have released a beautiful WIDESCREEN show in crappy fullscreen.

2643137,1,B000HT3P7E,"To start off, I love this show, but am VERY disappointed that the discs are listed as being in 1.33:1 (Full-screen) format.  This show is shot and brodcasted in high-def widescreen - why are the DVDs not released in this aspect ratio as well?  Hopefully this is an error and not the final specs for the dics.

Suit-up!

This is by far the second most funniest and most entertaining sit-com on air today behind Scrubs.  The cast chemistry is amazing.  The writing is witty and humorous.  The plot line is interesting.

Barney - or Swarley as he might now be known? (Season 2 reference.) - is by far the spark that really fires the show.  Neil Patrick Harris is absolutely hilarious in this role.  The catch phrases (two of which are listed at the beginning of this review) are highly quotable and his energy for the role is inspiring.  The whole cast fill their roles wonderfully, but Barney really steals the scene whenever he shows up.",1162857600,6,763,4.669172932330827
2643139,5,B000HT3P7E,"This is a great TV show currently out right now. The show is about a middle-aged man, Ted Mosby, who tells the story to his teenage children of how he met their mother.  This is easily one of the best shows of the decade.  The humor and sexual innuendo are outrageously funny.  The narration of the story to his children shows a sentimental spark.  It is definitely a great DVD set for those who enjoy modern 21st century humor or have a special place in the heart for a special someone.",1162080000,20,487,4.318681318681318
2643140,5,B000HT3P7E,"Neil Patrick Harris is solid gold in this great sitcom...  If it ever ends, he can spin off his own show like Frasier and be more popular than the original!  Barney rules!!!!",1161820800,2,174,4.40625
2643141,5,B000HT3P7E,"I'll be buying this the second it comes out.  It is the most underrated sitcom on TV today.  I'd argue it is just behind The Office in quality.  I grew in the golden age (the '80s, not the '50s) of the sitcom.  As the years passed, good ones fell away, Seinfeld saved it for a while and it too moved off into the sunset.  I tend to love sitcoms with a bit whimsy, a bit of heart, and romance.  My all time standard is the Wonder Years.  While this is more ""sitcomy,"" it is more like a beautifully executed film.  Twenty-two (and this season is even better) episodes or 11 hours of a great romantic comedy.  Hollywood should take note.  The cast is pitch perfect.  All of them.  Neil patrick harris gets most of the press, but Josh Radnor is fantastic.  Colby Smulders is a great addition to the american comedy scene.  The rest?  Smashing.  They really don't come any better than this.  Take the time to fall in love.  Even with Bob Saget's voice.  This show is the best.  You won't regreat it.",1161734400,10,994,4.298913043478261

2643143,5,B000HT3P7E,"... dodgy info on the DVD.  For starters, why is this a November release?  Should'a been out before the start of season two.  Second, ""3 discs, 284 minutes""?  Something doesn't add up here; by my math, 22 22-minute episodes equals 484 minutes, and is really gonna put a strain on 3 discs.  I hope these aren't flippers, and I'm gonna need a lot more info before I buy...
