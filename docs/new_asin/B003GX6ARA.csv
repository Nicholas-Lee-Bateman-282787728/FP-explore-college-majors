8396610,5,B003GX6ARA,Best foam rolling video ever. The instructor is the best and awesome personality.,1528156800,,81,5.3076923076923075
8396611,3,B003GX6ARA,"I've had this video for about a month now, and I'm still trying to decide if I like it.  It's definitely not what I expected--I expected a lot more stretching exercises, and this video does more of massage-type exercises.  While the word ""massage"" conjures images of a relaxing, stress-reducing experience, the Foam Roller workout experience is painful!  The instructor does say that some of the exercises will be or may be uncomfortable (or something similar adjective), and the discomfort is caused by tightness or ""knots"" in the muscle; however, I was experiencing so much discomfort that I expected to wake up bruised the next day!  My husband tried the exercises (both he and I work out daily) and he, too, felt like he was going to be bruised afterward.

On the plus side, the video does provide a good balance-type workout as you work to keep yourself on top of the roller during the exercises.",1295222400,4,901,4.787096774193548
