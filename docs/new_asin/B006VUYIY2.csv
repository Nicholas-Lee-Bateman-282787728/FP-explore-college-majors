5021438,5,B006VUYIY2,The kids really love to watch it. Over and over and over... Wow! I'm glad I got it for them.,1356652800,,92,3.65
5021439,1,B006VUYIY2,"Wow! Warner Bros went all out on this Looney Tunes DVD. Only 3 shorts running about 20 minutes!

The shorts are:

The Million-Hare
Napoleon Bunny-Part
Knighty Knight Bugs

Sure, I like the three shorts, but a person can buy either the Golden Collections or Spotlight Collections and get more for your money than this worthless release.",1347753600,4,335,4.946428571428571
5021440,2,B006VUYIY2,"If you're going to release a DVD with only three cartoons, at least make them three GREAT cartoons.  The Million Hare is average at best, Napoleon Bunny-Part is a little better.  The only really good cartoon on this Knighty Knight Bugs.  At least toss in a few extras.  Knighty Knight Bugs if nothing else could've made a fine commentary - considering it won the Oscar.  Overall this DVD is insult to the Wascally Wabbit.",1341446400,4,421,4.635135135135135
5021441,1,B006VUYIY2,"What is the reason for the existence of this DVD?  It costs $9 and only has 3 shorts, one of which (Million Hare) is definitely sub-par Bugs.  When is Warner Bros going to let go of the classics that they are still sitting on even after the extensive releases of the 6 Golden Collections?

Not only are they still holding back some of the more obscure greats from the early-to-mid 40s like Racketeer Rabbit and Along Came Daffy (among MANY others) but also well-known late-40s to mid-50s classics like A-Lad-In His Lamp (Bugs keeps bothering the genie in the lamp), Fair Haired Hare (Yosemite Sam builds his house over Bugs' rabbit hole), Greedy for Tweety (Sylvester, Tweety and the bulldog in the hospital with broken legs) and, one of the funniest Looney Tunes ever, Feline Frame-Up.  All of these would be VERY familiar to everyone who has watched the various Looney Tunes TV shows over the last 50 years.  Where are these cartoons?

Since the Golden Collections were discontinued all we have been getting are continual repackagings of the same toons or collections that give us a couple of classics and then throw in a ton of mediocre-to-junky shorts from the late-50s to mid-60s as filler.

C'mon Warners, just buckle down and give us some consistently good collections of still-unreleased-to-DVD classics. The DVD format has been around for 15 years now so it's a little unbelievable that they still have so many essential Looney Tunes under wraps.  We don't need every Looney Tunes ever produced, just the good ones!",1333411200,22,1524,4.857142857142857
5021442,2,B006VUYIY2,"There is no question that when it has came down to the Looney Tunes gang, they have been arguably the most influential cartoon characters of all time. For Bugs Bunny, it has been a decade since T.V. Guide named him #1 of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time. Warner Brothers honestly has made really great DVD's of Bugs for the past several years. But honestly, this happens to be the very first time Warner Brothers has decided to short-change the hare. The Looney Tunes: Best Of Bugs Bunny is not worth buying, not because of the price, but because there are only 3 (that's right only 3 cartoons featuring that wascally wabbit). The Million Hare where Bugs is caught in a TV competition with Daffy Duck in a race to the finish for the million box, the Oscar-Winning Knighty Knight Bugs where he has to retrieve the singing sword from Yosemite Sam, and Napoleon Bunny-Part where he finds his way to France by a wrong turn, and into the palace of the French figure, accidentally thwarting his battle plans by a sneeze, and causing complete mayhem.

Overall there are definitely better DVD's to buy that dedicate Bugs Bunny better for what they are worth like The Essential Bugs Bunny from 2010, and Hare Extraordinare from 2010 as well. But overall, Looney Tunes: Best Of Bugs Bunny is definitely not anything worth raving about. It is one thing if you've never seen a Bugs Bunny cartoon, but this is still one place not to go to for your money. Hopefully, That's All Folks in the way Warner Brothers treats their classic Looney Tunes on DVD in the worst bang for your buck.

5021443,1,B006VUYIY2,"Warners has hit rock bottom here!  Wasting a whole DVD with just 20 minutes of cartoons!

It is not like they are paying any real residuals to release these, none of the creators are making any big money off of this, Just Warner Brothers.

Here are the meager offerings:

""The Million-Hare,"" - Bugs Bunny & Daffy Duck - 7 minutes
""Napoleon Bunny-Part"" - Bugs Bunny  - 7 minutes
""Knighty Knight Bugs"" - Bugs Bunny & Yosemite Sam - 7 minutes

NOBODY SHOULD BUY THIS!
Instead they should buy either of these affordable Bugs Bunny DVDs:

5021461,5,B006VUYIY2,"The only reason I bought this DVD was for the Napoleon Bunny-Part episode.  I show it to my history classes after we study the French Revolution and Napoleon. This episode has a lot of references to historical events and people so it is fun for students to try to catch those references.  For me, I figured five bucks was worth having this DVD on hand to use each year instead of scrambling to try to find it online, but it does only contain three episodes so it is up to you whether or not you think it is worth it.",1393200000,,516,4.15
