3418237,5,B0018PH3OC,This is a must have DVD for anyone interested in Pete Seeger or his history. It is also important historically to show today's children what went on in the 50 and 60s to get where we are today. Good music and good story.,1224892800,2,220,4.1395348837209305
3418238,5,B0018PH3OC,"As a fan of Pete Seeger for many years I was so happy to see his life shown with all the family information.  Shows a person might not agree with you but still has a right to their own beliefs.  A good person with the idea of helping all and living life to the fullest.  Also shows that Toshi was the guiding light for the family and Pete.  Without her, he would not be able to be the man he is today.  His beliefs and songs have given us so much.

3418239,4,B0018PH3OC,"As a professional musician (with a fair amount of emphasis on folk music), I confess to having not been a ""fan"" per se of Pete Seeger's music--now I realize that I was in error.  That said, I was aware of the allegations about his political views.  The DVD is well produced and captures the illogic of the red-baiting that was present in the past. The filmed excerpts are edited nicely, and rebirthing the bygone spirit of those in the folk music era of the 1950s and 1960s.  The sight of a batch of college-age young folks sitting around singing folk songs is refreshing. The DVD reveals that Pete Seeger has musiciological substance than I had recognized.  This DVD should be included in numerous high school and college classes, and certainly merits watchng by any individual who is interested in (1) how pop culture has evolved with society and (2) high-quality folk music performances.",1221436800,5,890,4.7973856209150325
3418240,5,B0018PH3OC,Marvelous documentary about a remarkable person. Pete has lived his life in accordance with his principles. This is beautifully and forcefully presented with comments from family and musical admirers. It is a very moving and compelling DVD,1221004800,5,239,5.486486486486487
3418241,5,B0018PH3OC,"So glad I bought this! I first saw the video at a theater in Santa Fe, NM. The video not only gives us a closer look at the causes for which Seeger gave his energy but reminded us of all that was happening in the US that we might have overlooked. It took me back to my days spent in the towns along the Hudson River and the reverberations of Woodstock.",1220918400,,352,3.971830985915493
3418242,5,B0018PH3OC,"For those of us who grew up in the 60's, this is a wonderful portrait of a very influential folk singer and activist. I bought this as a gift for my 30 year old daughter who is an activist today. I knew that she would enjoy seeing where her mothers' attitudes were  formed and how everything Pete stood for is still so valuable today.
  Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could still change the world with song and togetherness, instead of anger, divisiveness and incivility  that we seem to bee living with today.",1220745600,2,510,4.451612903225806
3418243,5,B0018PH3OC,"I've seen Pete Seeger on a number of different stages, in Australia at the aptly named Union Theatre at Sydney University, in St Kilda in Melbourne and in London at the Albert Hall. His ability to get an audience to form itself into a veritable choir was evident each time. For over 45 years I've listened to his records, and some I still play like his American Industrial Songs, or an LP he made in London during the Miners Strike in Britain. I learned from his book and record to play the banjo. Seeger is part folklorist, part entertainer, as well as an extraordinary song writer. Where Have all the Flowers Gone? Turn Turn Turn! Big Muddy. He was influential in the US folk revival of course, but his influence spread across the seas to other folk revivals in Britain, in Australia and elsewhere. He always warned young singers not to regard him as a tradition singer, but as someone who learnt from traditional singers, telling them to learn from the people he learnt from.

Finally to get to the film, I saw it a couple of months ago at the Sydney Film Festival. I found myself joining in his choruses again (quietly enough I hope!) a thing I've rarely been roused to do in a cinema. I wanted to write something about the film but found it hard to know where to start. It's a fascinating story of folk revivals, of people using songs and making songs in their desire for a better, more peaceful world. Folk music is not always regarded as political, but what is more powerful than the vernacular voices of those excluded from fundamental decision making in their world? The voices of we the people? Especially in a world where culture itself tends to be marketed as if it were a product of some global factory system.

Now the film is out on DVD I'm sure it will have another life, but if possible go and see it with a crowd in a cinema, demand that your local cinemas show it! It's what the film needs.",1218844800,,1909,4.435897435897436
3418244,5,B0018PH3OC,"Last Spring the new documentary Pete Seeger: The Power of Song opened a limited run around the country. It was great and I recommended it to friends. Now it's coming out on video and even more folks will get the chance to see it. Plus there's some neat bonus features.

The 90-minute film features not only interviews with Pete but his son and daughters and one of his brothers as well as his well-known sister Peggy. There's great archival footage from the 1950s that I've never seen elsewhere and quite a few full performances as well. Director Jim Brown did his research well and Pete's lifelong wife Toshi is Executive Producer, which helped access some family archival materials.

Ronnie Gilbert makes some brief comments but Fred Hellerman (still living in CT) is surprisingly missing.

You'll learn new things about Pete (he subscribes to The Wall St. Journal!) as well.

There are one or two ""celebrity"" folks interviewed like Bonnie Raitt. But the strangest is Bruce Springsteen. There are three sections where Bruce expounds on Pete (never mentioning the ""Seeger Sessions"" at all). And every time he refers to Pete in the past tense! Speingsteen says: ""He had....."", ""He was...."".  It's like Pete is gone!

Sadly Pete was not a choice for the Nobel Peace prize this year. (I agree with Al Gore as a choice but this should have been Pete's year!) If there ever was a way to communicate to the Nobel Committee that Pete deserves the award, this film would certain make the strongest case. I wonder if they've seen it? Anyway, you should.

When I saw the film upon it's release I hoped that the DVD would include as bonus features full performances of the brief excerpts included in the film. Sadly, none of these made it to the DVD but in it's place are five ""Seeger Family Home Movies"" - about 5 minutes each - which Pete and Toshi made for the Moe Asch's Folkways label in the early 1950s

This DVD is a wonderful tribute to Seeger and is highly recommended!

3418245,5,B0018PH3OC,"If you ask anyone to make a list of five American Ideals, most likely Freedom, Justice, and Independence will be there.
It seems the fight to preserve those Ideals and make sure American Ideals can apply to all Americans has always been a struggle.
Watching Pete Seeger/The Power of Song, I learned what a difference we can make when we band together, walk together, and sing together.
We all want our freedom, we all want our independence, and we desire justice.
The ironic thing is, sometimes we have to band together with our neighbors (whom we may not even know) to collectively voice our concerns and causes to preserve our liberties, freedoms, and independence.
Pete Seeger has helped people sing together all of his life.  When he helped people sing for Unions, he helped the struggle for personal economic independence through better wages and benefits for workers.
When Pete Seeger helped people sing together during the Civil Rights Movement, he helped in the struggle against racial discrimination, and the struggle to gain personal freedom, justice, and independence for all Americans.
When Pete Seeger helped people sing together and band together for the common good, the Hudson River was made clean again.
Pete Seeger was blacklisted from commercial television for 17 years.  In those 17 years, our own freedoms and justice were comprimised.  Thank you, Tom and Dick Smothers, for helping to set things right.
There are some great clips of Seeger being honored at the Kennedy Center for his Lifetime Achiement Award, in 1994.

This is an excellent program.  We may appreciate, not underestimate, the power of song.",1212278400,46,1629,5.063432835820896

One part I liked best is when Pete says what he didn't like much about the film is that it didn't show ""all the stupid things I've done,"" or words to that effect.

3418260,5,B0018PH3OC,"I previously knew very little about Pete Seeger's life, as much of his career was ""before my time"". Still, I was amazed at how many of his songs I knew, they are so engrained into our history. Pete was a very good singer, had a nice vocal range and sang great harmonies in his groups. His music was very grounded, he was the ""real deal"".

This film is very lovingly made. It's edited well enough that even those who do not like folk music will still find it interesting. The video and audio quality are good and consistent. A lot of music is presented and you get to hear a fair amount of each song.

This film helped me understand the entire folk movement much better; it put into perspective the musical heritage from Woody Guthrie and Seeger (as a solo performer and with the Almanac Singers and the Weavers, etc.), to Dylan, Peter, Paul & Mary, The Kingston Trio, Joan Baez, etc. These all came afterwards and were directly influenced by Seeger, who did more to popularize folk music than anyone. It shows the birth of ""message songs"", of artist's developing an awareness and conscience and using their music and celebrity to promote these causes.

I am very glad to own this DVD, I will be re-watching it every now and then.",1456617600,,1229,4.502242152466367

3418278,5,B0018PH3OC,"I have to say that after seeing this film, I now understand Pete Seeger in a way that I never understood him before.  His goal was simple:  he simply had to be a folk singer.  The subjects of his songs were inevitable, because he saw things the way they were, and when he thought something was wrong, he had no choice but to sing about it.  You didn't have to agree with him, he seemed to be angry with no one, simply driven to point out what he saw as injustice.  He was financially secure when he was with The Weavers, but when the other members of the group insisted on doing a cigarette commercial (he didn't smoke, and didn't want to encourage others to smoke) he simply quit the group.  When he appeared before the House Unamerican Activities Committee, he recognized how ""unamerican"" the committee was before anyone else did.  When Seeger was asked (words to the effect of) whether he had participated in a communist conspiracy, he answered that he had never participated in any kind of conspiracy.  Then he was asked if he thought the Communist Party was a conspiracy, and he answered (words to the effect of) that his thoughts were his own, and other people's thoughts were their own, and he had no intention of sharing his thoughts if he chose not to.  The person on the committee repeated his question, and Seeger said, ""Sir, I believe I have answered your question.""  Seeger continued his life and career despite the disapproval of the committee, despite the fact that he was effectively barred from television for about 17 years, and lived the life he chose, which was not illegal, and was supported by the principles expressed in the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, and he and his family were happy.

3418284,5,B0018PH3OC,"In my younger years I loved Pete Seeger for his songs, his music, his voice.  But this documentary reveals his passion for human rights which probably isn't well known to younger generations.  Those of us who came of age in the 60s had a glimpse, but so much more is revealed in this brilliant film.  With commentary by Joan Baez, his contemporary and Bruce Springsteen, who was strongly influenced by him, viewers see the diversity and breadth of his social and political activism.
Seeger easily takes his place among American folk heroes, but even more exciting is his popularity around the world.  I was even privileged to hear young musicians performing his music in the Republic of Armenia in the 1990s, at time when he had been pretty much put on a shelf in the US.  I recommend this finely researched and filmed documentary for American history classes as it represents real events from the highly charged political and social climate of its time, but also for revealing the effectiveness of music and perhaps all arts in bringing about social and political change, for the better.",1403222400,,1088,4.827956989247312

Fighting for civil rights, education, freedom of speech, the environment, standing his ground against unprincipled forces; all achieved in his own unique way.  No grandstanding, just going about it with dignity and purpose.  Of course, there's lots of great music and comments from Pete and his family and his music pals like Arlo Guthrie, Tom Paxton, Joan Baez, Ronnie Gilbert, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Peter, Paul and Mary.

3418311,5,B0018PH3OC,"The glorious documentary ""Pete Seeger:  The Power of Song"" provides us with a beautiful and inspiring portrait of a man whose life and music helped to define an era.  Seeger has always been an artist who viewed music not merely as a form of entertainment but as a vehicle for social change and as a means of bringing people together.  And it is this legacy that is captured so movingly in ""Pete Seeger: The Power of Song.""

The movie chronicles Seeger's beginnings as the son of musicians who would travel around the countryside bringing classical music to the rural masses.  The movie then goes on to depict Seeger's introduction to folk music by the very people his parents would play for; his becoming an activist for worker and civil rights during the Great Depression; his riding the rails with Woody Guthrie, inspiring people with pro-labor ballads.  It then moves on to his time as a soldier during World War II (no reflexive anti-military guy he); his marriage in 1943 to Toshi, a fellow folk singer and the true love of his life; his building his own house in the woods for him and his family to live in; his acceptance, then eventual rejection of Communism as a workable ideology (ironic, considering what was to happen to him soon afterwards).  Then we move onto the late 1940s when Seeger hit it big as a member of The Weavers, the first group to truly bring folk music to a mass audience.  And we get to see just how quickly one can tumble from the pinnacle of fame, for the band soon fell victim to McCarthy Era hysteria, being suddenly blacklisted - its concerts cancelled and its records destroyed - for what were perceived to be its communist leanings.  Seeger himself appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee in the mid-1950s, where he refused to sign a loyalty oath, resulting in his being blacklisted from TV for the next 17 years (it was the Smothers Brothers who eventually had the courage to buck the establishment and bring him back on).

Yet, all during this time, through his programs for kids, he remained instrumental in creating a folk-music revival that swept the nation and that would provide the soundtrack for much of the social activism that was to flower in the 1960s - activism that came in the form of minority rights, antiwar protests and increased environmental awareness (Seeger spearheaded the drive to clean up the Hudson River).  The ultimate irony - and the ultimate tribute to the effectiveness of Seeger's position - comes near the end of the movie, as we see him receiving the coveted Kennedy Center Honor before an audience of tear-stained fans and fellow musicians.  Not bad for a man who, just a few decades earlier, had been accused by the American government of being everything from a Commie to a subversive to a traitor, merely for staying true to his conviction that all men and women should be treated with dignity and respect and that they should strive to live in harmony together - and for expressing that sentiment in his music.  As Seeger's son says, it only goes to show just how right the man and his causes were all along - and how persistence in the cause of Good, no matter how long the struggle, will always pay off in the end.

In addition to priceless archival footage of Seeger performing at various stages in his career, director Jim Brown provides a generous helping of interviews to help round out Seeger's story.  The interviewees run the gamut from friends and family members to recognizable artists such as Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Natalie Maines, Arlo Guthrie, Peter Yarrow, Mary Travers and Bonnie Raitt - musicians and songwriters who owe so much to Seeger for their own artistry and success.  And, best of all, Seeger himself, now a frail man in his 80s but still endowed with a tremendous passion and hope for the world, is given the chance to relate the story of his life in his own words.

And, of course, always there is the music, providing a stirring backdrop to the man's life - songs he either wrote or sang (or both) like ""If I Had a Hammer,"" ""Goodnight Irene,"" ""Turn, Turn, Turn,"" ""Guantanamera,"" ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone?,""  ""We Shall Overcome,"" each and every one of them a classic and a standard.

While watching this film, I couldn't help but be struck by the eerie parallels between that earlier period and our own.  In an era in which people are once again being demonized as ""Marxists,"" ""Socialists,"" and ""Communists"" by loudmouthed, know-nothing  demagogues, Seeger's story and the stances he took couldn't be more timely or relevant. It's more than a bit depressing to realize that issues and struggles that many of us believed to have been long resolved and long settled have once again reared their ugly heads.  It's a reminder, sorely needed apparently, that the fight for social justice never truly ends, and that it takes all of us working together to bring about that world of equality and human advancement that we should all be striving towards every single day of our lives.  And, more than anything, that's been the message of Seeger's life and music for nigh unto three-quarters of a century now.

I honestly cannot imagine a more uplifting and inspiring movie than ""Pete Seeger: The Power of Song.""",1280016000,15,5251,4.738748627881449

Such struggles are never over, but America has moved far in Seeger's direction on all of them, and we won't go back.  It's so hard to imagine a time (in my lifetime) when denial of all these rights was standard, that we forget how long these struggles lasted, and how much courage and integrity they required, in the face of isolation, uncertainty, and angry, unprincipled attacks - physical and economic, as well as in the media.  Throughout, save perhaps for a brief and passive membership in the Communist party, Seeger kept his integrity and hope, never complained or hated, and turned setbacks into opportunities.  Blacklisted from virtually all media for most of the 50s and 60s, he was mostly ""reduced"" to teaching folk songs to children - and thereby sparked the folk revival which helped bring real depth into most other popular music.

If you don't know who Pete Seeger is, then learning his story, purposes, and methods will likely be worthwhile for you.  This film presents a concise and fast-paced history of his artistry and advocacy.

Seeger used his talents and gifts to promote causes he believed in.  He used songs to attempt to effect social changes.  It would be easy to call much of his music didactic, but I think Seeger consciously conceded the loss of some of the beauties of indirectness and metaphor in order to speak more clearly to more people about issues he believed deserved more public attention and change.

Generations come and go quickly.  Fashions and artistic trends of the world move forward quickly, leaving most things from a couple generations ago behind and mostly forgotten.  Seeger sang to keep good ideas in circulation and to keep public dialogues going on less visible and often unpopular-to-view issues.

Seeger did not seek to keep others in the ideas of the past.  He often used older musical styles to express newer ideas for the future.  That is maybe what separated him from many folk and bluegrass musicians.

He spurred on and helped to create the 60s and 70s folk music movements, movements that were not interested in preserving the old and conservative, but rather were interested in stimulating new and critical thinking.

Most of us will not be remembered primarily for what we did to strengthen and improve ourselves.  If we are remembered, it will more likely be for what we did to strengthen and improve others in our generation and future generations.  If that is true, Seeger will likely be well remembered.",1245888000,2,1794,4.953177257525083

3418324,5,B0018PH3OC,"Pete Seeger is a great folklorist and singer. As a kid I loved him. It wasn't until I was in my teens that I learned Seeger was not only an avowed Communist, but a supporter of the murderous tyrant Josef Stalin. Not until 1993, at the earliest, did Seeger admit to ""his major blind spot opposing social injustice in America while supporting the most tyrannical of regimes abroad"". (NYTimes, 9/1/07.)

  This film. calling itself a documentary, spends a lot of time claiming that Seeger was oppressed for being a Communist without acknowledging that the Soviet regime controlled the US Communist Party and did seek to manipulate, if not replace, the US system of government. It also fails to mention that until the apology noted above, Seeger supported the Stalinist regime that was responsible for allegedly 70 million murders and the imprisonment and virtual enslavement of hundreds of millions more.

  Seeger, in short, is no hero and this film goes to extraordinary lengths to hide the truth.

  He is, however, a great singer and in many ways a laudable social activist. The film traces Seeger's roots from early experience in a musical family through his days as a folklorist through the present. There's lots of good Seeger music from the past seven decades and interviews with the usual bunch of gushing celebrities. Of particular interest, is Seeger's relationship with his wife and children. It is difficult to understand that a man who supported tyrannies all over the world that wrecked so many families could be so loving of his own family.

  I still enjoy Pete Seeger's music, but I doubt that I will ever develop a liking for the man himself. I certainly did not enjoy the dishonest hagiographic approach of this film.

3418325,5,B0018PH3OC,"Pete Seeger: The Power of Song gives us a  well-crafted documentary of the life and times of the legendary Pete Seeger. Pete Seegar used music to make people bridge the gaps between them to defeat hatred, war and a less than perfect world. The documentary goes along at a very good pace with excellent cinematography and I was never once bored. The archival footage is fascinating to watch--especially the footage of Seeger on foreign television and his appearance in 1967 on The Smother Brothers television show. We also get great commentaries by talented peers of Pete Seegar; Bruce Springsteen, Joan Baez, Arlo Guthrie, Mary Travers and Peter Yarrow all provide us with good insights, just to name a few.

The documentary essentially traces Pete's life in chronological order. We get a glimpse of how Pete's parents broke up after his mother, a frustrated musician, left her husband and children to go have a life of her own. Pete's father got a job in Washington, D.C. but with the help of a scholarship and some meager family funds he was able to go to Harvard although he eventually dropped out. Pete also began to get involved with the Communist political party because they were opposed to prejudice against African-Americans and they believed in the power of the unions to strike. Pete worked very hard to support civil rights; and this is well documented with great archival footage in this film. Of course, when he was blacklisted by the government's Un-American Activities Committee, Pete was forced away from television and radio appearances and it took quite some while for him to make his way back to the larger mainstream audience.

But this never truly stopped Pete. He sang in schools to make younger people see the power of his peaceful message which he delivered through folk music; and the documentary shows how he wrote a book or two about the power of folk music to enhance the life of the common, everyday man in America. We also learn how Pete eventually worked as a member of The Weavers who reunited at Carnegie Hall after being blacklisted as a group for several years. That Carnegie Hall concert was a smashing success, to say the least!

The documentary even shows how Pete was able to spearhead plans to clean up the Hudson River which flows near where he and his wife of over 60 years, Toshi, live in upstate New York. Overall, this is very sweet and impressive at once.

The DVD comes with some deleted scenes and a few other extras. Great!

I highly recommend this DVD for fans of Pete Seegar; and of course fans of folk music will not be disappointed. Pete Seegar may not be working much these days because of his advanced age; but he continues to make a strong impact on people everywhere whenever his great music is performed.",1239753600,,2763,4.733887733887734

3418327,5,B0018PH3OC,"Does anyone from the ""Generation of '68"" who was interested in folk music, and there were legions of us, really remember the first time we heard that thrilling voice of Pete Seeger (generally then accompanied by a banjo). Probably for me it was in some variation of The Weavers' version of Lead Belly's ""Goodnight, Irene"" but I am really not sure. That deep but nevertheless gentle voice first came at us over the radio or on a record player (A what? I hear the younger set saying-well, old fogies, fill them in later). Not television, however, as this is one folksinger that was banned in Boston, as the old expression went.

Why ? Was it because Pete sang randy, racy songs and thus offended the moral scruples of the community? Hell no. Just for the simple act of political expression of not telling the various `distinguished' Congressional committees down in old Washington in the 1950's whether he was or was not a communist. Kid's stuff now but then it meant your life and livelihood if you gave the wrong answer, or worst, no answer. This little documentary about the big life of America's most well known folksinger is one of the better efforts produced in this American Masters series. For one thing it is nice to have homage paid to a man while he still breathes. For another this piece is filled with Pete Seeger music of his own composition and that of others that he worked with.

The above paragraph is just my little valentine to the work of the man. Make no mistake Pete stands, and has most always stood, for a different political perspective than mine but one must cut cultural workers a certain amount of political slack when it comes to their craft. This documentary, complete with the obligatory `talking heads', including Pete's wife, brother and children, traces the very radical early career of a man who also ranks as an important scholarly source of folk music history. It traces his trials and tribulations through the infamous `red scare', his reemergence during the folk revival of the 1960's, the attempts to clean up New York's Hudson River and his later work with children and whoever else needed some help.

I take issue with his concept of thinking globally and acting locally. The reverse is necessary- think locally and act globally. But what can one say negatively about a man who has given us such musical good news. A short list of my favorites- ""Oh, Had I A Golden Thread"",""Turn, Turn, Turn (his adaption), ""Last Train to Nuremberg"" and ""Little Boxes"" hardly does justice to the man. Oh well, enough of the valentines, except one thing. Something is definitely out of joint with the times when, as shown here, Pete is being feted by then President Clinton at the White House for good citizenship.
