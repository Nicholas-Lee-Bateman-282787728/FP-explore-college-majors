2615567,5,B000GNOFBG,"I have to disagree with both the other reviews. ""Oscar"" is the movie where Louis de Funes reaches his own top in terms of inventiveness and funniness. But of course, without the proper subtitles, english speaking people won't be able to fully appreciate his so very idiosyncrasic kind of genius.
I wouldn't say Oscar is up there with ""Don""t look back... we're being shot at"" but, nonetheless, I would advise any foreign Louis de Funes fan with knowledge enough in french language to purchase this little gem because they'll find every thing this great comedy actor had become famous for.",1288310400,2,587,4.88
2615568,3,B000GNOFBG,"You must understand French to appreciate this movie otherwise you will be very disapointed as this movie probably coming from French Canada and DOES NOT have subtitle.

The comedy is an earlier one, refreshing, funny, though not as hilarious as Rabbi Jacob. I don't regret buying it, though.",1179532800,5,291,5.0625
2615569,1,B000GNOFBG,I love Oscar with Louis De Funes but this DVD is in French without English subtitles and it is not an English version as this product page claims. Since I don't know French I can't enjoy it fully. I even bought it twice hoping to receive what is advertised on the page but twice I  received the same French version. I am disappointed. I hope Amazon changes the description of this product soon since it is something different from what is being advertised.,1170115200,16,456,4.493975903614458
8133635,1,B000GNOFBG,Why in English?  Found out after I bought.  Very disappointed.,1489190400,,62,5.1
8133636,1,B000GNOFBG,"Very disappointed, I was expecting to see this comedy in the original language and it only had the option of English dubbed",1483315200,2,123,4.636363636363637
8133637,2,B000GNOFBG,"It was English!! I expected the movie to be in French with English subtitles.
Otherwise the movie itself is awesome and hilariuous. A classic.",1476316800,,142,4.958333333333333
8133638,5,B000GNOFBG,"Good quality although the DVD arrived scratched because the plastic pins holding it in the case broke during shipping so it was moving around in the box.  I watched it right away to ensure I did not have to return it.  As a kid, I watched dozens of Louis De Funes movies and ""Oscar"" has always been in my top 5 along with ""La grande Vadrouille"", ""Rabbi Jacob"", ""Le corniaud"" and more.  I did not see an option for non-French speakers eventhough the box claims it has English subtitles.",1450915200,,485,4.426966292134831
8133639,3,B000GNOFBG,"Gave it 3 stars because it is announced as Dubbed or Subtitled.  It is only dubbed.  Sorry, Louis de Funes is not funny dubbed!",1432944000,3,127,4.25
8133640,4,B000GNOFBG,I was surprised that the english dubbed version sounded that good. There are only a few of the movies of Louis De Funes available with anything english (subtitles or) but since this is one of his greatest comedies it's worth watching it dubbed in english I think.,1432598400,,263,4.617021276595745
8133641,1,B000GNOFBG,"Its in English, I wanted the French version",1425513600,2,43,4.5
8133642,5,B000GNOFBG,"De Funes is a comedic genius, and he proves it in this classic comedy of errors.  The film unfolds at breakneck pace, and it's filled to the brim with superb physical comedy, puns, and double entendres.  There is a scene where DeFunes's character goes ""zenzen"" that should be studied by every aspiring comic out there.  Hilarious and brilliant!  The movie is in French and has no subtitles, but if your French is not goood enough to follow (and the dialogue goes VERY fast, like everything else in this movie), you can always read a synopsis of the plot on the internet and then watch just to enjoy the manic energy of De Funes's performance, and the conviction and humanity he brings to his acting.  He is one of the funniest men who ever lived.",1350172800,2,746,4.537313432835821
8133643,5,B000GNOFBG,"Warning!  If you do not understand French, do not get this film as it is in French and has no subtitles.

That being said, if you DO understand French, this film is hilarious.  A con man plies his trade on rich Louis de Funes, whose daughter loves his chauffeur, Oscar, and whose maid is marrying a baron.  There's three identical valises with different contents that keep getting mixed up.  There's Jacqueline whom the con man wants to marry and who claims to be Funes' daughter.

My French isn't all that good, but I understood enough to really enjoy this film.  It made me laugh.",1349308800,,582,4.538461538461538
8133644,5,B000GNOFBG,I remember this movie fondly from my childhood; De Funes was so hectic and the movie's pace could barely keep up with him. The misunderstandings and double-entendre just cracked me up. He was France's best comedic genius!,1339891200,4,221,5.0
