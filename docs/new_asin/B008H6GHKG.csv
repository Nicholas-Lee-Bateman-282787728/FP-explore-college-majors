Based upon the narrative viewpoint of conservative superstar Andrew Breitbart the film is relentless in it's drive for the truth. With stunning photography , incredible editing and quick cut interviews Occupy Unmasked is an in your face indictment of the institutional left .David Horowitz and Greg Gutfeld called Occupy Unmasked ""the most powerful film ever made about the American Left .""

5163794,5,B008H6GHKG,"It is true the bankers are guilty of numerous crimes and caused serious financial repercussions, that being said however, the Occupy Movement made a total jackass of themselves and justified far right claims in that they are a bunch of lazy ne'er-do-wells looking for handouts and/or demanding people of healthy economical income pay for their debts.

Occupy Unmasked, I believe, clearly pointed out the harm these people have caused and even gone so far as to point out a series of masterminds, who used the occupy movement to cause chaos.

The film however, was exceptionally bias in showing nothing but the negative highlights of the left, that being said however, it is justifiable being the left has shown NOTHING but the negative of the right.

As Brietbart once said, ""Those who live in glass houses should not be throwing stones!""  What comes around goes around.  The left has gone out of its way to demonize the Tea Party, which is pointed out in a few segments of this film and at the same time, praise the occupy movement and never once question the harm they caused people, businesses and themselves.  Last time I checked, the Tea Party didn't go around provoking the police, cause destruction to privet property, rape fellow participants, violate the law or scream derogatory words at law enforcement or those of different opinions.

Occupy is guilty of these atrocities, granted not in the majority, but still guilty and yet they are the voice of the people of America and the Tea Party is the second coming of Jim Crow?  I say bull-dung on that!

I'm very pleased with Occupy Unmasked and glade to see some of the radical far left being caught doing what tet do best, making jackasses of themselves and showing what is wrong with Americas youth and how atrocious they will continue to grow if left unchecked.",1452643200,2,1823,4.798722044728435

5163805,5,B008H6GHKG,"Like many Americans, I was totally sucked in my the media. I thought this was an average American protest movement. Oops!

It was nothing of the sort. It was created and orchestrated by professionals. Professional what? Yeah, professional union bosses and professional communists. I attended high school from 1965 through 1970. I was used to thinking that protests were for a cause and an issue. I was not used to thinking that protests were used to destroy things.

I grew up thinking that protests were about young people who were afraid of dying in Vietnam. That's something that you can protest about. I was drafted in June of 1972. By the time I was out of Basic Combat Training at Fort Ord, CA, Nixon had ended the war. Whew! But that didn't mean that I was blind to those who did not want to stand up for FREEDOM. Freedom isn't something that is easy for people to understand. Especially if you grew up in a nurturing and loving family who took care of your every need. I grew up in a violent household with parents who routinely beat me. ""Freedom"" was not just a nice sounding word to me. I wanted it, badly.

When I found out that the ""occupy"" movement was being run by union bosses and rich kids with fully paid annuities and trust funds, I immediately realized this was not a ""1960s"" protest.",1439942400,3,1303,4.512711864406779

This kind of perspective on the occupy movement is represented throughout the film.

If you think owning a macbook or iphone relegates your constitutional rights to gather and protest then this film is for you.

Clearly shows the backwards thinking of the millennials (which sadly I'm a associated with). It provides a fair balance to how the media should portray this and similar events.

Only complaint is: whose idea was it to use a guy missing literally half his teeth as a subject matter expert?

A resource based economy is not an attempt to socialism, communism, fascism or whatever else one wants to call it but an attempt to save our ENTIRE SPECIES from a system that is inherently corrupt and will inevitably end in our destruction.

This is a very good in-depth look behind the scenes of how Occupy Wall Street was so much more than just a few hundred people bonding in the streets over the crimes of the big business.  This is a look of the many years of how it was created, formed, organized and built into what it was... how it was successful... and why it was a failure... and more importantly, what they learned for next time.

How did the government respond?  How did American in the Heartland respond?  Can they be more effective next time?  Will there be a next time?  Who were the major players and how did they find a way to come together and organize ""chaos"" in multiple cities in the US at the same time?

5163816,1,B008H6GHKG,"I like to think I am open-minded by listening to different opinions and views that I don't necessarily share; a by-product of a liberal education? Obviously I knew what I was getting into before I hit play- just looking at the mask and anarchist A on the cover already paints a visual in the mind of the viewer that foreshadows that the Occupy Movement must be anti-establishment (anti-'merica!). It only takes about 5 minutes of viewing to see some of the inherent hypocrisy on behalf of the film makers. First off, one of the claims (or major themes) the movie makes is that the Occupy Movement is funded or backed by the left, and that the movement is disingenuous in any true beliefs because they are being controlled by Unions and mysterious ""others"". I found this very confusing and hypocritical, in that, almost anyone with access to basic cable or the internet knows that Citizens United and indeed the Tea Party is funded by the Koch Brothers; each of which is worth 50 billion each- if you've paid attention to the news lately, they have openly stated that they will pledge 900 million dollars in the next election to the republican candidate. That to me, seems more scary than any stoner in a tent on Wall Street. Another thing that sort of annoyed me were these non-fallacy arguments. For instance, Mr. Breitbart asks some demonstrators why society should subsidize college tuition and not instead help him by a new car? Free or affordable college tuition does not equate to a material object. The difference Mr. Breitbart is that the community benefits from an educated society. I was one of the rare students of my region to attend state university through the help of federal Pell Grants and other scholarships because I came from a low-income family (Dad's an Ironworker/ Mom's a secretary, and yes both are employed!) and now I am finishing up graduate school in cell and molecular biology. I want to give back to my taxpayers by using my knowledge to make bacteria that break down environmental toxins from petrol distillation. I already do research that makes artificial petroleum from algae. We need to get past this notion that people who need help are blood-suckers to our economy! I have to admit I had that same mentality when I worked as a pharmacy technician during my undergrad when I saw just how many people were on state Medicaid; to give you an idea roughly 50%. Come to find out, it wasn't that these people were the ""lazy, unemployed slackers"", but actually gainfully employed people at your local Wal-Mart, Target, Pet-Co (major retailers of America- you get the drift) that couldn't afford their companies own health insurance programs, and so have get their insurance from the government! We need to stop this Left-Right, ""Us"" vs ""Them"" mentality. This is America people! Whatever happened to ""Together we stand, Divided we fall""?

First lets talk about the trailer. I knew I was in for it when text describing Andrew Breitbart as ""visionary"" appeared on the screen. Let's face it Breitbart was a muckraking sensationalist who's BIG contribution to humanity was showing us the outline of Anthony Weiner's erection.
This movie fails to entertain on pretty much every level. There are several interviews with people who attended the protests but who were either stupid, just there for the yelling, or clearly stoned.
He highlights the hypocrisy of movement, which on many levels is fair. But never does he really talk about the validity of their points- unless he is building a straw man.
Its pretty one sided, and the ""liberals"" included are either people who have no credibility, or whose remarks are clearly being taken out of one context and being put in another.
It will change no one's opinion, and serves as intellectual self-pleasure for those who already agree with it.
Also the Occupy Movement does not use the Guy Fawkes mask, Anonymous does. Though Anons show up everywhere these days so I can see where one would get confused, and how an intellectually lazy person wouldn't bother to discern the difference.",1410998400,15,1291,4.872727272727273
5163832,1,B008H6GHKG,"Leni Riefenstahl would be proud!  I watched this hatchet piece and then had to go throw up a little bit.

Let's be honest here, a GOOD documentary makes a concerted effort to shed light on a subject from all sides and all angles.  Then, the viewer is left to make their own assumptions.  This ""documentary""(quotes necessary), goes right for the jugular as soon as it hits the ground.

The intro is this weird ""we're all gonna die because of Obama"" montage which, to be honest, has nothing at all to do with the occupy movement.  I think I even saw a second or two of some poor guy on a gurney getting hit with defib paddles.  WTF?

The best part is when Breitbart himself comes on a makes the case that these scary occupy kids aren't a bunch of folksy, down home grassroots folks, they are actually being funded and controlled by the scary BIG LEFT, the movers and shakers of the left wing.  This made me laugh out loud.

Citizens United, who produced this video, is funded in large part by the Koch Brothers.  The Koch Brothers are right-wing movers and shakers in their own right, just as large or larger, than anyone on the left.  Hypocrite much?

In the end, if this was a serious attempt at journalism and documentary filmmaking, then I would give it a fair shake.

5163845,1,B008H6GHKG,"I just watched the documentary ""Occupy Unmasked"" and the resulting anger led to the inspiration to write this post. Let it be known, ""Occupy Unmasked"" is nothing more than a dishonest hit piece. Let it also be known, that I was very critical of the Occupy movement so I thought I would find common ground with this documentary.

My expectations were first lowered when I saw the box cover, a Guy Fawkes mask with red anarchy sign. Anyone who knows anything about the occupy movement knows that it was not an anarchist movement. There were radicals for sure, but there were a variety of flavors and for every ""radical"" there were big L liberals, unions (public and private sector), and students asking for help with education cost/debt. Were anarchists in attendence? Probably a few, but it was not an anarchist movement.

Still resolved to watch the film, expectations dropped significantly. It was as if the narration came straight from Fox News. ""They hate liberty and freedom"" and ""they want to destroy everything"" and ""they don't care to stop the rapes taking place"" and ""the liberal news only focused on XYZ."" Strawman on top of straw man.

With the adjusted expectations that this was going to be more propaganda than an informative piece, I still resolved to continue watching to see if there were any kernals in the film to be enjoyed. And then I got to minute 40...

At 40 min, they play a brief interview from Brandon Darby, referenced as a ""Writer, Political Activist, Co-Founder of Common Ground Relief."" They use the clip to show how even like-minded activist is admitting how awful these occupy folks are regarding XYZ.

Keep in mind, this film was made in 2012 when it was well known that Brandon Darby was an FBI informant who worked for years to reveal and arrest radical, even if non-violent, activists. ""Occupy Unmasked"" referenced an FBI informant not as an informant, but as an activist when it was well known he was there because he was an informant.

system is corrupt, and certainly not constitutional. The Central Bank running this circus in 08
did bail out all their friends while sticking your children with the bill by the way, our political system is corrupt from top to bottom.
To deny we have real problems is to be a major part of the problem. You would think as intelligent species we could
all sit down together to figure out a better way.  The real problem in this country is a lack of morality and ethics.
The Constitution is also an interesting document that is currently being ignored in the battle of left versus right.
Look at the entire picture, then track your way back.
We have to Love each other instead of fighting all the time. Both sides use violence to settle arguments.

Now that being said, there are a good few points they brushed up on (but only brushed up on sadly enough). The rapes that happened in the occupy movement are real and there were cover ups that were done. In fact there has been a bit of backlash among femenist groups towards the occupy movement because of these incidents. Yes there is hypocrisy among rich people like Michael Moore, whose living is made off of gullible liberals, or people who funnel money into the movement due to some benefit. Also, the less serious problem that the movement has a very ambiguous and general goal if any.

This film is filled with many, many things that the typical conservative American probably despises. Like Mr. Moore's ""documentaries"" (filled with many, many things the typical liberal American probably despises), Mr. Breitbart's work is full of sensationalism, often depicting an unbalanced perspective which is very obviously not based on how things likely really are.  And I say ""likely"" because, of course, real life is ""likely"" a bit more complex than these two can handle. Fortunately, we have good citizens like Mr. Moore and Mr. Breitbart to present a biased lens through which we might look at complex things like gun ownership, capitalism, or the occupy movement.  I'd argue they are both equally transparent, and that ""big fans"" of either producer probably represent the edges of American society.  Easy targets, loads of dogma, strident side-taking; all things that our society needs more of.

5163900,3,B008H6GHKG,"I have no idea how much of this ""documentary"" is actually factual. The main goal of the film is to paint an already unpopular movement in as negative a light as possible, and then use the canvas as a spring board to link it to as many groups and icons that Conservatives love to hate: unions, Barrack Hussein Obama, Bill Maher, Rachael Maddow, Anonymous, Anarchists, and last (but certainly not least) Michael Moore.

A theme throughout is an attempt to present the Occupy movement as though it is accepted as a totally spontaneous movement, and then claim the entire movement a fraud by ""proving"" that the movement and its activities are/were organized by liberal media members, unions, and Anonymous.

Breitbart himself uses W's (GW Bush) own mantra concerning terrorists (""they hate freedom"") to describe the Occupy movement as a whole.

At one point, the film shows footage of an interview with Tim Robbins, then dissolves to a scene of snake charmers making cobra's dance, and then adds ""Van Jones/Co-Founder of Far Left Color of Change"" to the screen in the same manner in which interviewees and guest commentators are introduced. I understand the imagery of snake charmers, inferring that the protesters are merely puppets of those directing the music, but I am completely lost as to why Van Jones and his organization are referenced in this sequence.

Honestly, I didn't learn anything new about the Occupy movement from this film. I am familiar with where it came from and how it was organized. For example, I understand the reason why part of the movement is to occupy abandoned buildings. But, the film merely shows these images and inserts it's own narrative of what is going on. For all the flack the Right sends Michael Moore's way, they sure seem to like using his methods of combining real events with his own take and presenting it as fact.

It is worth a cursory viewing. But, if you watched Fox News' coverage of the Occupy Movement (as I did), then there are no revelations presented in this film. The film consists of those like-minded to Breitbart presenting the most abhorrent incidents and aspects of the occupy movement, and paint them when their own, even more, negative spin.

The US occupies over 100 countries across the world which does a lot more damage than the people of the Occupy Movement. Also a lot of good, don't get me wrong. But these extreme one sided documentaries are poisonous.

This documentary shows some of the tactics used to avoid scrutiny and how ill informed the front line of the group actually are about the fascist ideology they are supporting. From a list of ""I want and you must pay for"" to the ""Why should I work for anything"" mentality that is seen on the front line to the ""Don't answer him!"" and the roaming thugs who keep the informed from asking difficult questions this is a good expos.

Not only does it reinforce the bias of the mainstream media, it also exposes the violence, bigotry & downright hatred of America for so many involved.  They seem to hold little esteem for the nation that allows such activity & are COMPLETELY CLUELESS of what would happen to them should they behave accordingly in any other nation.

During their heyday, one could not help but find laughable their collective ire against the ""CORPORATE MAN""; all the while fiddlling w/their I-PHONES, etc.
The most glaring example of their cluelessness was their insistance of 100% blame for the ills of our nation on WallStreet ( which btw, WS is NOT completely blameless by any means) vs 1600 Pennsylvania Ave & the US Politicians themselves.

5163927,5,B008H6GHKG,"It was distressing to see just how palpably and viciously UGLY many of the participants in this movement were.

And I say that WITHOUT feeling that it is unfair just because EVERYONE wasn't as bad as the worst, EVERYONE wasn't included or that the film was made by a former card-carrying liberal who said he himself was forced from their ranks by the personal ugliness of some he'd thought were kindred spirits, but now MUST be hated and destroyed because, as with leaving Islam, such apostasy is the ultimate sin, punishable by death.
(""Learn who was behind making this film"" indeed, as a number of the ""1"" Reviewers chided as sufficient to discredit it's value and preferably censor other Dupes from even watching).

What I saw and heard first person at the time OWS was happening,- long before this film was even thought of- was enough to make it clear to me that ""something evil lurks here""...and I pity anyone who lacks the discernment...and human decency...to be fooled into believing otherwise.

I say that as someone who was on the front-lines in the 60's.
This is NOT ""a new generation's Vietnam protestors"", as some want to pretend.
This is NOT 1960's United States.  We've been deliberately and systematically lied to and manipulated into being Dupes of the Left.
The Progressive Matrix they, at great expense and effort, have created is so extensive that MANY have no reference points whatsoever to possibly be able to see how thoroughly duped they are.  They've been swallowed whole by parents, teachers and friends who not only were nurtured on the Kool-Aid, but now think it DELICIOUS!

I know EVERY sizable movement needs those who get swept up because they BELIEVE the cliches, rhetoric and posters that always sound so noble. I didn't know in the 60's for instance that poster slogans such as ""Make Love Not War"" and ""If It Feels Good Do It"" were being fed to us by Progressive organizers through their tools in the SDS and such organizations for the express purpose of undermining and destroying the foundation of the U.S. and bringing this nation under.

Back when I was as blindly enthusiastic as some in the OWS orgy I thought WE were making up the slogans and causes and organizing the rallies and protests!  In fact we were being manipulated and deceived then by the earlier generations of the SAME manipulators pulling the strings on the Occupiers like a bunch of wooden marionettes.

Obviously MOST participants in any movement are not psychopathic sheep herders such as Lisa Fifthian or Leslie Kagan...as we were not all Bill Ayers or Andy Stern in the 60's by any means.

Manipulation of the masses...the same mass psychology that President Obama has worked hard to master...is the lifeblood of Humanism...from Stalin to Castro to Chavez to Obama.

What I'm talking about is the evil that is the very heartbeat of ALL aspects of Humanism...whether it is called Communism, Socialism, Liberalism,  Progressivism,  Obamunism... or any other ism-tweak fits to moment......every ""denomination"" of the man-is-the-measure belief system that can rightly be referred to as the Humanist Religion, following the doctrines and dogma of Progressive Theology.

In 2013 United States it can justifiably, under the current White House and media cartel, Progressivism can rightly be thought of as the first official state religion of the United States...conformity to which is demanded under penalty of virtual martyrdom through whatever means necessary to silence and/or destroy  heretics.

Humanism is all about using the  ""little guy"", ""workers"", ""underdogs"", ""proletariat"", masses and sell them a bill of goods about how much the central planners ""care"" and want ""equality"" and ""justice"" for them, and of course how the evil ""rich"" just want to exploit them.

Funny thing about the road to utopia, though...It's always littered with the bodies of those same ""little guys"",...
BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER REALLY ABOUT THEM...It's ALWAYS...from Marx to Che to Obama...been about THEM...and keeping the elite few in charge...the ""Proletariat"" to use the French term adopted by the Soviets.
Currently in the U.S. it is the Democrat Party Ivy League elites who know whats good for you FAR better than you ever could...because they're SO SMART and SO CARING, and therefore SHOULD have free reign to design your life and your society.

They keep one carrot after another dangling in front of the ""99%"" with the assurance that the Promised Land is just over the next hill...and of course keeping them focused on whoever is the evil-du-jour that must be hated, obsessed upon and destroyed-- because THEY are the obstacles to the gates of that Utopian Promised Land because they HATE the poor, ordinary decent folk.
(Currently, of course, evil is personified in the form of Republicans generally, and any individuals who do not sufficiently conform to the official beliefs of the noble Progressive Movement and therefore deserve whatever bullying and personal and professional destruction that comes their way.)

Virtually every one of the ""1"" Reviews of this film are done by those wishing to demonstrate their willingness to serve in even this small way as faithful Progressive Fundamentalists, honored to help enforce the Progressive Theological Essential Doctrine that ALL heretical beliefs must be censored and silenced, preferably along with the heretics spreading such ""lies"".

Anyone who can watch this film...even GIVEN who made it and the fact that it does not show every moment and every participant, and still defend OWS, is, indeed, a Progressive Fundamentalist Dupe in good standing with the Ayatollah Obama and all other clerics of the faith...
And probably highly susceptible to being further manipulated into performing even the worst acts shown in the film...from deliberately and viciously attempting to incite violent police responses to destroying property to setting police officers on fire.

Once one has sold his or her soul to any cause that has no higher authority than the claims and ambitions of other humans, there should be no shock at ANYTHING they're capable of.",1375401600,6,6092,5.107645875251509

In the 60's I participated in the ""Sit-Ins"" and various protest marches until I woke-up one day to realize who the people were pulling the strings behind these ""spontaneous popular protests"". These puppet-masters were Marxist-Communists who knew how to manipulate people to their own ends which were not at all in sync with America's best interest, much less my own.
There's really nothing new under the sun, and today's Communist agitators are no different. First they infiltrate every key institution of a Country; Educational, Governmental, Legal, etc., and then they set about to undermine and sabotage it from within. Then, when their crooked policies, laws, and spending practices bring chaos and suffering upon the masses, they turn around and blame it on traditional values, constitutional conservatives, and CAPITALIST!
Without exception, every communist/socialist dictator has come to power via these same methods; and now we are witnessing the same thing here in America. These are NOT the 99% of Americans who love their country, are proud of it's history and achievments; No, these are that radical 2% being agitated by a few Puppet-Masters into mindlessly doing their bidding; ""Useful Idiots"" as Stalin used to call them. They are NOT true ""Americans"" in any sense, and deserve no better than the way we would treat a Nazi, Soviet-Socialist, and any other seditionist.

They also paint ""rich white people"" as the only ones involved, and assert that the presence of drugs in one tent, stand in for every member of Occupy. The truth is, however, that Occupy succeeded in part because of its diversity across geographic region. Some places were mostly white, while others were mostly people of color. Some places did have Occupiers who were monied, others, like my location, were mostly young, rural poor people. Generalizing the way the film does is a logical fallacy.

The documentary shows organized paid protesters, and poses for the cameras. It is one-sided, to be sure, however, CAUTION: occupy your own mind before you join anything/body. You've seen the other side on the news already before watching this film. Again, IMHO, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.

My Face-book posts have hopefully always cautioned non-violence and self-awareness first (occupy your own mind first and always). I've never been able to tolerate noise, crowds, so my occupation is of my mind, my keyboard, the space between my hands and my ears.

From what I have seen in my nearly 55 years and from what I've read of political theory, the extreme forms of socialism, that is on a large scale, don't work. It works as a moshav or a kibbutz, a small scale within a parliamentary form of government, which is what I observed works in Israel while I was living there growing up. In that form of government, socialism exists as a component within a democracy, not always a minority component, but never dominating everyone. Even in Israel, socialism does not dominate or extinguish organized religion. It does not dominate the military. It does not stop trade, it participates in trade in an organized fashion, by working as a group. The collectives are more like worker owned corporations or factories might be here in USA, so where are the advocates of worker owned businesses? Smashing never solves anything, it only temporarily justifies the most reactionary and extreme safety measures. And it helps the alphabet soup of federal agencies beef up their data files.

Anarchy does not work. Anarchy is a lack of all rules, or mob rules, or law of the jungle. Anarchy when mixed with violence lead to totalitarian/fascist backlash which we have seen time and again throughout history, not just European history but our own.

Resistance must be non-violent. It must work within the existing system.

So, please watch all the way through if you can then make up your mind. There are no closed captions but the names of the people can be googled.

In 2011 Occupy Wall Street and other protests broke out throughout the world, but mostly in the United States where every pitiful band of hippies and malcontents decided it was necessary to go live in tents on public property and ruin it. Before these leftist love-ins President Obama's administration was suffering its lowest approval rating ever and saw very real discussions about controlling the insane rate of debt that the government was incurring. Viola! These protests, covered (and in some cases instigated) by the mainstream media gave the American people something else to talk about.

Union thugs to finance it. Anonymous to stifle dissent. Leftists and Anarchists to organize it. And the mass media sitting on the sidelines trying to portray this as a ""Mom-and-Pop"" grass-roots movement. And none of this was hidden, it was just that the media had their themes and messages and were not going to stray from them. Breitbart shows you who these people were. None of them were shy about sharing their hate for capitalism or whining that somone ELSE should pay their student loans.

Ironically, it was President Obama who got credit for sweeping the scum out of the parks as they had made themselves incredibly unpopular to 99% of the regular citizens who came into contact with them, what with the rapes, public bodily functions and drug use, not to mention the trash.

When I look at this movie the beginning was perfect because just like the dumb dying ultra-racist baby boomer Tea Party movement who want more money and yeah that fear of mixed race President that die out, now where cames along the stupid greedy young yuppie Occupy Wall Street movement, that at first thought was good idea because let face it the rich a-holes are gonna get judge for all their lavish spoiled entitlement cheating the poor, rubbing elbows with the government, cause hell me and my husband are damn enough struggling with bills and looking for enough job. But, this protest movement was no different than the Tea Party, just destructive Star Buck drinking, having Apple tablets white trust funds babies and confuse minorities wanna join in with the extreme leftists. Let alone this is just what went down back in the 1999 capitalist Woodstock!

Now for myself, over the years I been in and out of politics and I gotta say all this ""Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Libertarians, etc."" is nothing more than this schizophrenic, White Supremacy garbage to keep minorities like me in the dark to not think outside the box cause this country call America once belong to only the Indigenous people of the Americas, not Whites PERIOD they stole this country! This film suck horribly to all time low! The middle to end was a reversal of the same old crap ""Extreme Right vs. Extreme Leftists, Extreme Leftists vs. Extreme Right""! I mean, I understand there were brutal dictators throughout the centuries, but why the hell this director lied and left out about America's brutal past? Cause America, just like any country has dirt! We know that all presidents from Washington to Obama to next upcoming presidents in the future are all doing dirt! Next, this jacka#$ had a nerve to say that the New Black Panther Party were involve, BS! The New Black Panther Party splinter away from the Old Black Panther Party because they are completely only, BLACK SEPARATISTS, they had dealt with government informants, and they alone don't agree with that feminist, LGBT, anarchists, multiracial hardcore ideology!
And like an idiot, no different than all political parties it a load of junk for him to do these schizophrenic labeling of communists this, socialist that labeling is all together! For this fool, to agree with the whole segregation/ Racism White Supremacy trash of saying the Civil Right movement was violent by protesters trying to destroy America and harassing the cops is garbage, because the cops have such a history of harassing people when they are not doing a damn thing! And farther more if people didn't raise up to oppression that means minorities would still be getting raped and killed for needing that same rights as a human being, like going out voting, going to school, finding jobs to pay bills, feed their families, not being able to go wherever they want travel. So, that means my parents would have not met each other to have me and my siblings. Sounds like genocide! Now the whole Anti-War movement was the whole, ""Why were in that country in the first place thing."" Which was the same old repeats from Cold War, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan yeah, yeah, deal that they claim this a ""free country"" but that is wasn't the case at all cause this country like I said before isn't what it seems.

Now the only good parts was that these celebrities join in the protest to keep up their idol worshiping to the masses, stupid money grubbing Michael Moore who use to admire back in high school but ever again since over the years he been your typical Al Gore to begin with using serious social topics like, the unheard rapes the media didn't say (1999 Woodstock effect), Anonymous, who I was this close of joining but their tactics have gone way too far of hacking in to everyone's account over the smallest thing to make it into a big portions to ruin people is dangerous, Adbusters was a fluke, I use to follow all that extreme hippie nonsense to just not waste too much money at the big chain stores like funky Wal-Mart, Target and others that I never shop back because I truly support local businesses and the politics are crap but they want you to be a puppet for the puppet masters to confuse the person into something harmful just like the Republicans and those stupid parties are doing to say, ""work with us, we'll help each other"".

Like all propaganda films it will arouse the tribal loyalty of other right-wingers and those that carry around the Fox News view of the world.

One thing that really annoys me about propaganda from the left or the right is this urge to both demonize and make ridiculous the point of view you oppose. You cherry pick statements from stupid people and then make fun of it and show that person to be illogical and ignorant. Well, welcome to the real world--most Americans have virtually no understanding of logic and are unable to carry on a sensible conversation with anyone that does not share their general view of life--yes, showe the stupid ones but also take on the issues with people who match you in intelligence.

The top Democrats in the Senate and House--and even the President--romanticized the Occupiers as grass-root Americans. Set the politics aside for a second and just look at the facts.  The Occupiers caused millions of dollars of property damage with hundreds of arrests, vicious violence, public defecation, illegal drug use, murders, sexual assaults and venomous anti-Semitism--all admitted by participants and/or documented on video.

This documentary does a decent job of showing the roots of the Occupy Wall Street movement, though it wasn't hard to see the hypocrisy and contrived nature that these demonstrations were displaying. After all, it's pretty silly to protest in front of big corporations when you're wearing designer clothes, texting on an iPhone, and storing your money in the very banks you claim are corrupt. The film certainly exposes the ignorance and chaos that ensued from these disorganized campouts.

The problem is that it feels too repetitive and low on information to fill the time limit. If this had been a 30 minute special then it would have been captivating, yet after an hour you can only watch so much footage of the same thing happening before you begin to tune out. I had to struggle to pay attention and keep myself invested in what was happening. The first half hour is great and looks at some of the people and incidents that the media didn't cover; after that there's not much that really happens and ultimately it makes the film less effective. The pacing and flow were simply too jumpy to make the experience appear seamless, even though the information presented is quite good in and of itself.

1. Occupy was ridiculous
2. The Tea Party is even more ridiculous
3. Andrew Breitbart (TEA PARTY) pointing out the dangers of a group of uninformed disgruntled citizens holding rallies and looking stupid is most ridiculous.

So basically you have a guy belonging to one group of mostly ignorant or uninformed rabble rousers voicing his concerns about another equally largely uninformed group of rabble rousers.  This documentary is nothing more than the usual fear mongering right-wing propaganda bulls*** making a big deal over what basically amounted to nothing more than time-out taken by alot of angry and fed-up people who wanted to let out some steam joined by other people thought it would be cool to join the party and turn it into one.  Now before I get attacked, let me just say that if I had to choose sides I'd much rather hang with the Occupy crowd because they know how to have a good time and they're a much better class of open-minded tolerant people which is why I'm about as concerned over the threat Occupy poses as I am about Obama's birth certificate and the possibility that he's a muslim manchurian candidate.  If you want to worry about a sinister cabal that threatens the American way of life, well that would be called the government of course.

This shockumentary is more in the vein of an Alex Jones production than a real news piece meant to inform. It takes minor connections based on fact and expands them--using pure speculation and innuendo to fill in the gaps--until they look like something that the target audience can get really riled up about.

I was disappointed in the extremely heavy-handed use of melodrama (music, clip choice, word choice), very obvious cherrypicking of quotes and interviewees, and the almost twisted emphasis on the rapes that occurred during the Occupy Movement campouts. Those were disgusting crimes and the perpetrators deserve to be outed and brought to justice, but this documentary's gross, ham-fisted attempt to link them to the Occupy Movement as a whole instead of framing them as the actions of individuals really turned me off. Political differences aside, neither side of the debate supports rape and this documentary really goes out of its way to link OWS and rape.

Now if you are one of those few people on this earth that can manage a open-mindedness context and wishes to see both sides of an event before denial I'd recommend you to watch this movie.

""Undermines Preconceived Notions once had""

This is exactly what this documentary will attempt to show you if you lived in the United States during the time of the popular ""Occupy X Movement."" With a flurry of video directly recorded from the movement, coupled with audio quotes and other miscellaneous first-hand resources, you will get to see the biased-views U.S. Media decided to cover. You will get to see exactly who orchestrated the Occupy movement from the beginning, with the who & why to what truly leads things like this Occupy Movement from start to end.

Albeit at moments, the ""intensity"" of this documentary was a little much, but after watching this movie I can see how difficult it would be (as a movie-maker) to constantly show calmness when the entire Occupy movement was concocted from sinister beginnings.

I was never for or against the Occupy movement. However, the producer will make a good argument on why organized chaos and lawless rebelling IS NOT the method that should be attempted for change in political agendas for a society that is supposed to pride itself in being fair and sane. At multiple times you get to see grown misled adults in a child-like tantrum mixed with beastly disregard for public safety; echoing selfish calls for change when they themselves are just as brimmed with scum as the corporate evils they are crying against.

I still do believe in the essence of the idea that, Yes wealth distribution in the United States is not even, and yes if you are not already wealthy, you are disadvantaged to becoming wealthy. (How many people are really born or brought into fortune though?)
But the question that should be asked is ""What better is there?"" since our system isn't perfect, what's the better alternative? And I think that's a side that the producer failed to address.

Perhaps because the bathrooms were locked to drive out Occupiers? And, why would you ever lock a bathroom? Even if it was dirty, why would you lock it? What would you expect people to do in the event it was locked?

Occupiers sleeping in property they don't own? The movie will talk about this ""fact"". But, why?

Sure, all Occupation started out with people taking public spaces, spaces that people pay for the upkeep on! When people are effectively evicted with ""dusk-til-dawn"" ordinances and backpack-free zones where do they go? Perhaps an abandon building? And, why don't they own that? Perhaps, the Occupy critics have a fundamentally different idea of property. You don't ""own"" a building because a bailed out bank evicted the previous residents for falling on the same type of tough times the bank itself couldn't survive!

Occupiers define ""non-violent"" differently? Ok! But, why?

What would it mean to be ""non-violent"" as compared to ""peaceful""? There is an important difference here. Saying you won't leave a public park is inherently non-peaceful? But, who would claim you're being violent? Violence requires an animate target -- you can disagree with this, but that requires discussion not a fiat-claim that you're right.

All of this ranting about Obama -- how does it relate to Occupy? Did Occupy not protest the NDAA? Did they not protest Obama's war against the whistle blowers? Obama's extension of the Bush-tax cuts? This movie makes Occupiers out to be both Anarchists and Obamabots, it needs to pick a slander and stick to it.

Obama can not be a statist socialist that has a fan-base of revolutionary anarchists that vote for him. It does not compute.

5164092,3,B008H6GHKG,"I was an 'occupier' and I lived in Zucotti park up until the eviction (and continued to organize within Occupy Wall Street until March).

I really enjoyed this movie (I hesitate to call it a documentary), not because I thought it was 'true' in any sense, but because it offered a glimpse into a wildly different perspective from the one that I have.

This is propaganda, however, and ought to be understood as such. It paints a one-sided, bleak, black and white picture of the Occupy movement.

What was amazing about being in Zucotti was the sense that we were creating a container in which all sorts of different perspectives could be held and heard. Yes, there were folks who argued on behalf of violence and anarchy, but there were also folks who were non-violent in the tradition of Ghandi, and everything in between. The Occupy movement was beautiful because it contained all these perspectives and didn't lend itself to easy and simple narratives like this film wants to paint.

That being said, I enjoyed this film because it gave me the opportunity to step into a very different reality tunnel than the one I usually inhabit. Rare is that opportunity, and I found it very valuable.

Apparently community organizers are bad. And if you think CEOs get paid too much you want to overthrow the government and are against all that we stand for.

5164124,1,B008H6GHKG,"I have rewritten this review several times due to an inability to describe this documentary.  It has already been established in earlier reviews who the creators of this film are.  It should not be in dispute which side of the political, social, and cultural divide that Citizens United are on.  My difficulty is in framing this piece in a way that will get through to the broadest possible audience what this film is about and what it's gross deficiencies are.
  First, this film is not trying to give a factual and full-bodied view of the causes and effects of the Occupy movement.  It is very clearly a gun pointed at the ""left-wing.""  I say this because there is nothing positive said about the right wing or the financial sector.  There is no attempt to communicate anything besides ""these people are against the status quo.""
  There are claims made that the Occupy movement was planned behind closed doors by Union leaders and ""60's left wing radicals that hate America.""  There are claims that all this planning is on tape and documented, yet these documents and films are oddly missing.  What is displayed, in spades, is individuals making claims that are not backed up by anything other than their own words.  If there was a long standing plot to overthrow-the government by the far left, it is not proven, nor even clearly elucidated, by the film makers.
  There are many, many factual issues with this documentary.  The most glaring, however, is the lack of sources, documents, and footage to back up their claims.  Regretfully, I can find little in this film that would lead me to recommend it to anyone as anything other then a novelty.  My issues are not the clearly right-wing commentators or the rehashed footage.  My problems are with non-existent causal links that are propped up as fact throughout the film but are completely unsubstantiated by proof.  If there was a left-wing conspiracy, this film does nothing to prove it.
  ""We're supposed to respect these institutions.  Do you respect these institutions today?""  That is a question posed by one occupier towards the end of the film, and it is a perfect summary of the problems inherent in American society as a whole and this film in particular.  Do you respect these institutions?  Are you a member of the tea party?  If you are, then you clearly don't respect the office of the President, unless he is the president you chose.  Do you respect the courts?  You only respect the courts if they rule in your favor, otherwise they are just ""activist judges.""
  While it is a matter of perspective, this film gives none.  Zero.  It seems that the creators have gone out of their way to mask their perspective, but have done so in such a flagrantly blatant way that it is all too obvious.
  If you want to learn more about what causes social upheavals in democratic nations, there are many, many books written on the subject.  If you want to know why so many of the poor and young in this country are disaffected, why not try asking them yourselves.  This, however, is nothing but one-sided drivel that does nothing to further a discourse between fellow Americans.  It's intent is to divide, marginalize, and promote fear.  Resist this kind of meaningless tripe and think for yourself.  I am sure you are far more intelligent then these clowns give you credit for.",1353715200,40,3335,4.7421602787456445

5164126,3,B008H6GHKG,"A very watchable and enjoyable infotainment film. But hardly objective, or unbiased in its presentation of facts. I know personally a few free  market anarchist and others whom were there at the kick off to OWS working with Adbusters. And this film presents a very polarized, and narrow focus on those events involving media, leftist radicals, and union involvement. Do not get me wrong, those influences were there, but this film went into 'tin foil hat' territory with applying it to everything OWS related and being a Neo-Marxist plot from wanna be Carlos the Jackals and Weather Underground romanticist. There are a few out there, and involved with OWS. But most Americans, including the over whelming majority of OWS participants and supporters would say there is no place for those tactics, and practice of polemics in a civilized society trying to make progress. Like this film, the majority of main stream media covering OWS, regardless its bias, still are making the OWS story whatever they want it to be. The 'real' OWS story, like the Seattle WTO demonstrations, is still a bit 'hijacked' by partisan media and either demonized or romanticized so far beyond the reality that it isn't possible to yet see it for what they were through media. The OWS, WTO protest, Tea Party, etc, were common people of this country, not right or left, coming together to raise a dissenting voice against what they saw as injustice.

5164128,2,B008H6GHKG,"I stumbled upon this documentary on netflix. I have come to the conclusion that almost every documentary made tends to have a political slant either to the ""left"" or the the ""right"". This makes documentaries difficult to watch if one simply wants un-objective historical information on the WHO,WHAT,WHERE,WHEN aspects along with an unbiased WHY.  This particular documentary swerves towards the right jumping into the fast lane of oncoming traffic from the get go! The oncoming traffic in this case is the moderate minded zeitgeist.  The term community organizer is almost spat out by the narrator/host who with his flowing mane of long grey hair and cool sunglasses could easily be mistaken for an ex hippie or rather the poster child of the media's caricature of what a ""liberal"" should look like. I assume this was a technique in order to get the audience to trust what he is about to say as a non ""square"". Then the man opens his mouth.... What takes place for the next 70 or so minutes is incessantly repeated voilent footage replayed again and again (probably because there was not that much violence to begin with during OWS) along with a soaringly science fictionesque ""the shit is about to hit the fan and you better run for your life!!"" soundtrack. Then come the usual airing of the heros (most of them from the republican party) and of course the villains (most of THEM from the Democratic party) only a moron could not tell where this narrative is going to wind up. So What was Occupy Wall Street? To take this film seriously it was an attempt to overthrow and destroy the country by nefarious agitators also known as Nancy Pelosi and President Obama (that damn community organizer!!) LOL This put this particular documentary into a new term that I have just coined DOCUCOMEDY. Why comedy? Because it's claims are so outlandish that one can only laugh at what it is ulitimately trying to do. What was Occupy Wall Street  in actuality or rather what did it wind up being in the end? Simple;  Old baby boomers with nothing better to do with their time and longing for the 1960's and their youth along with 20 somethings with even less to do wasting theirs.

  As a political statement the net effect of OWS and the Tea Party was proven the other day (election day) ie. the folks in the middle think both ""movements"" are full of crap. The OWS movement was much ado about nothing and it's opposite the TEA Party movement is much ado about not much more only with fatter and whiter people. Though OWS was pretty white too.  I think the guy that narrated this film dropped dead of a heart attack. Gee I wonder why?  Which begs the question what are some white people so damn angry about on both sides of the political spectrum? In the end one asks this Question? What is it that citizens united who producted this film so worried or rather whom are the REALLY trying to protect that they needed to produce this film in the first place? The answer I can only assume would come from a documentary that is unbiased about who ultimately pays for CU to exist and to produce these films in the first place?

5164149,3,B008H6GHKG,"The media rarely covers the Occupy Movement with the sort of thorough investigation needed to peel back the many layers of this Frankenstein monster of an activist group. We only get anecdotal evidence based on uninformed speculations, and very little information that isn't spun into anti-left rhetoric that simply downplays or shames the protestors into a non-issue. Most mainstream reporters either write the occupiers off as ineffective cry-babies or vagrants with nothing better to do. We don't get nearly enough information to make an informed assessment of what's really going on. This documentary is one informed assessment. Though, I should warn you ahead of time, it leans far to the right. That's not to say that it isn't very accurate about some points (it is), but I'd suggest doing your homework before taking everything that's asserted in this film as 100% truth.

Occupy is, indeed, not just a typical group of angry Americans protesting. This is clearly the start of a potential revolution. Not a revolution for reform, but an orchestrated attempt to incite anarchy. Without a coherent declaration of wants/needs, or a distinct person or body to speak for the whole, these people are simply angry rebels without a cause, and they are growing in numbers exponentially.

This film clearly points the viewer toward a few key people, whose presence should be enough indication to question what role they may have in the conception and orchestration of this movement.

This stuff is important, and could potentially effect us all. So go ahead and watch this if you aren't familiar the occupy movement at all, but know that this is only the far right side of the story. Go do your research, get informed, and pay attention to what's going on with this movement, because it's not going away any time soon.",1352764800,10,1815,5.003311258278146

I am a conservative, but I have written several articles on income inequality long before the occupy movements took hold. There is weight to their arguments and most of the protesters' frustrations are justified.
Violence only occurred in an extremely small minority of the protests, usually for brief periods of time and by a select few individuals. The footage shown in the documentary is sourced from numerous protests, of which Occupy is only one. Also, the film uses clips from different interviews and videos to literally build new sentences and put words in the mouths of protesters.

For the record, the majority of protesters:
are NOT violent,
are NOT anarchists,
are NOT rapists,
do NOT hate America,
DO see massive inequality and injustice in our society,
are there on their own accord (independent of community organizing attempts),
are young and idealistic, mostly liberal.

5164197,1,B008H6GHKG,"Poorly argued conspiracy theory that uses the outrage at the fringes of the OWS to paint the whole movement as radical and thereby avoid the real issue - our financial system is a house of cards. It was on the verge of collapse when the people bailed it out. And since then, nothing has changed.  We haven't fixed it because no one has any idea how. A run on credit could happen again tomorrow but no one wants to talk about it. The plan is to ignore the issue and  paint anyone who objects as radical.

That is the real intent of this movie - OWS comes from the mob-riddled unions of the 30s? And from Black Panthers? And Stalin?  And they want to destroy Israel? The movie piles farfetched, unbalanced, conjecture on top of out right conspiracy theory.  It isn't even creative. It would have been more fun to use AIM to tie OWS to the Lakota people and then back to the Comanche who really knew how to cause a disturbance.

Were there some radical folks involved, yes.  Does that explain the entire movement or why it happen? Not at all. But this movie doesn't want to explain anything. It is a polemic trying to smother dissent. The filmmakers have no use for reason or objectivity because they know what bridge they want to sell.  For instance, the starts by saying OWS was a ploy by the left to avoid the debt ceiling discussion yet many of the radicals the film goes on to pillory didn't want the debt ceiling raised, precisely because it would have damaged the US economy so badly.

The movie says over and over that OWS wanted to overthrow the government and promises to show us the evidence.  Then they play one phone conversation that about protesting Chase but planners say the real issue is to challenge the power of Wall Street, which is OWS stated goal.  So the movies' promised evidence shows that OWS should be taken at is word, not a some secret society meant to destroy the country.

By no means was OWS perfect but I was there quite a few times and saw good and bad behavior by both OWS and the police. I saw great kindness and great stupidity. I twice say a buss drop off large, intoxicated agitators to cause trouble in the crowd. People slept outside in the middle of cities across the country. You try that and see what happens to you.  The small number of problems is the real story, not that there were some issue.

We should have a serious discussion about the movement and who was in it and why but this movie is not it. OWS wanted to country to pay attention to gross inequities that have grown up since 1980. American workers have continued to get more productive but we no longer make more money for doing so. It is a real issue that cuts across all red and blue states and that is what has apologists like David Horowitz so scared.

It shows riots, public defecations, drug use, racism, allegations of rapes and other nasty behavior some of the left wings are capable off.

But its clear that this documentary is biased it selves. The use of thunderous music in the background with aggressive riots images, it feels sort of propaganda like. I like this documentary as it told the other side of the OWS movement. That is not the same as speaking the truth. There are two sides to any story, this will be one. Find the other, and then you get the truth.

No documentary is neutral. Occupy Unmasked is no more biased than any Michael Moore documentary, or Stefan Jarl, perhaps even less.

Sadly, all major ""news"" organizations in the states have loss sight of journalism. They are publicly traded companies which are under pressure to meet Wall Street's target quarter earnings. Therefore the ""news"" these days are all about numbers, ratings and ad revenues. To achieve higher rating, they're catering a specific view to a specific audience. After all people likes to hear what they want to hear.

There's nothing wrong with creating shows for a specific audience, except when it comes to journalism. Once the journalism became tinted, the facts often get distorted for the sake of ratings. And some people will take its face value as facts. This documentary is doing the exact same thing as the modern news groups have being doing; targeting a specific audience by presenting a view of their liking. And generating revenue for itself in the process.

There are many factors why OWS gone viral the way it did, major political think-tanks were not one of them. The scale of OWS is so massive, I think that's where older generation doesn't quite understand the power of social media and independent blogs have over the younger generation. Therefore it has to be organized by major political think tanks.

Personally, I'd like to see a documentary about how mainstream media muted OWS with its coverage and the decision behind it.

5164236,5,B008H6GHKG,"In Memory of the Late, Great Andrew Breitbart. RIP.

I bought Occupy Unmasked along with Monumental by Kirk Cameron about 2 weeks ago.  I did not see the screening in theaters because I'm currently on deployment.  When I popped it into my laptop I had to calm myself down because I knew that I might potentially throw my laptop across the room.  Not because of the movie but because of the uneducated left-wing bigots I was going to see, uncensored.

And boy howdy!  Was I right!  Andrew and his team did a wonderful job of not only filming the left in their natural state but had the bravery to enter the hellish nightmare know as Occupy Wall Street.  Andrew and his team did a phenomenal job of capturing everything on film.  A lot of the pictures were crisp and clear as well as the sound. It's hard to believe that the movie is only 75 minutes.  I wished there was more because I know there's more.  But in any case Team Breitbart got the job done and gave us more to the ""man behind the curtain"" or Guy Fawkes mask.

If anyone can't tell I know why the left has used the Guy Fawkes mask as their symbol. It's from V for Vendetta, tripe of a movie.  One of the biggest anti-Christian, anti-American, pro-socialist, pro-terrorist fictional films out there.  I remember reading the reviews on what I mentioned and I did decide to watch it myself.  I couldn't watch the whole thing because I was saying to myself when did left-wing propaganda become ""art?""  To answer that, along time ago, unfortunately.

As for Occupy itself it is the left's Tea Party and what socialism produces it exactly what I saw, violence, drug-use, disease, rape, garbage-dump living conditions, uncontrolled sewage, incompetence, the uneducated, selfishness and totalitarianism.  I wish that Andrew would have mentioned that OWS was and still is supported by the American Nazi Party and I also wish that Andrew would have interviewed the numerous Libertarians that proudly...slummed with OWS.  As far as I hear Libertarians are to be the ""ultimate liberty"" party. So why would they be backing the ultimate government-controlling-your-life movements. Go fig!

To close with my review like I said I would suggest ANYONE to prepare your heart for what Team Breitbart caught on film. You will get angry.  Yet know that OWS is caught on film, there is no way the liberal media or the left-wing blogoshpere can cover it up.  OWS is fascism/socialism/communism in it's purest form.

P.S. I'm a native Portland, Oregonian.  Born in Portland, lived there until my family got us away when I was 12 and lived in a town, that is considered the Greater Portland Area, until I was 28 and joined the Navy. I have seen the gulag of the left in it's natural form so I do know what I am talking about.

You can check yourself that most occupiers arrested are set free. Most of the video you see of protest outside is occupy itself filming it for protection against police and undercovers.

No gov't likes revolution and they are going to lie and make up situations so you won't like it either. At the same time they get to hide their corruption and greed. If you know about the N.D.A.A how citizens can be arrested without reason,trial and be held as they want. Why was that not in the debate?

In 1930's in Germany and in 1917 in Russia, similar bandits got a power under the same slogans, and using the same revolutionary tactic. As a result, German became a fascist country; Russia - socialist country; the World got WWII and over 56 mln. deaths.

This movement goes back many. many years and is intent on overthrowing the government of the United States.  They claim to be non-violent.

Be prepared to be shocked.  You have never really SEEN the true Occupy movement, and the MSM have certainly given you no clue about who organized it and why.  After you see all the violence, arson -- after you hear about the huge rape problem -- after you see their rat-infested camping grounds -- you will be shocked again to know that bigwigs in the Democratic Party (Pelosi, Reid, and Obama) were cheering these rioters on, apparently careless of the damage to civil society that was being done.

5164257,5,B008H6GHKG,"""Occupy Unmasked"" was a startling education for me into the real Occupy movement. I had some understanding that it seemed to be a leftist group with some complaints toward the financial community.

Virtually the entire film is videos of Occupy events, and interviews of people who personally observed them. What I learned from the film is that Occupy was NOT spontaneous, but a union organized, far left wing event seeking to overthrow the financial system and economy of the United States of America. Unions ran training classes for protesters on how to take over public streets and private & public property; agitate police, film only police response and not their own actions, to make the police look like lawless thugs; and also to protest with tactics much closer to rioting than peaceful sit-ins. Democrat leaders including President Obama who certainly understood Occupy's motivations and may have been in on the planning, all publicly supported the movement. And Occupy's ""99%/1%"" ideology is now a major part of the liberal Democrat narrative. The Occupy protest events devolved into violence and sexual abuse by protesters against each other, and incredible amounts of vandalism to public and private property. Some of the violence was insane, like the man throwing bricks off a building onto people's heads below. The arson was particularly disturbing, and looked quite similar to the terrorist fires in the Middle East. The anarchy of the movement - I didn't know that before. Yes, the Occupy events of 2011 ended, but I feel certain more events will happen in the future - quite possibly if Romney wins the presidential election. Obama supporters have already said in hundreds of Tweets that they would riot, and even assassinate Romney. And the protesters now have experience, and know how to do it.

5164279,4,B008H6GHKG,"Let me start off with what this documentary get's wrong. Breitbart and Citizen's United are of course Right Wing ideologues so everything you see is slanted on a bias, the purpose of course is to paint the Occupy movement in the most negative light so this video is without balance. They also use the opportunity to link radical elements that were indeed part of the occupy movement with the Obama administration and mainstream news which is absolutely false; at one point they claim MSNBC as one of the originators of the movement which is bunk. Members of the Occupy movement fiercely opposed Obama and Democrats as much as they did the Republicans.  They saw both Dem's and Rep's as corrupt and they loathed the traditional ""liberal"". Breitbart also failed neglected to interview and challenge people who had contact with the movement and could place it in context, someone like Chris Hedges who supported the movement, believed it to be a mainstream movement but spoke out against Black Bloc anarchist tactics.  They also don't talk to David Graeber one of the originators of the movement, one of the intellectual daddies who is an anarchist, academic and who encouraged many of the more radical elements, they also could have tried to reach out to Adbusters.  Brietbart claims that the unions were also in on the building of the movement but fails to mention that many of the unions fell out of grace with Occupy for one reason or another. Breitbart also failed to show the positive social engagement that came out occupy like anti-foreclosure actions for example.

So why did I give it four stars?  I initially gave it three, wanted to give it 3 1/2.

I gave it that extra star because a lot of what they show of the movement is true. There was an image of it being a real grassroots ""leaderless"" movement, which it wasn't. There were leaders, there were those from Adbuster's giving tactical directives but you would never know from whom they were coming from. There was a bait and switch element about the 'all is welcome', ""we are the 99%"" when in reality if you spoke of ""reforming"" the system, if you didn't accept the finger movements or questioned the anarchist model which they employed you were treated with suspicion, as an outsider or worse labeled as a ""cop"". The movement was not seriously focused on Wall Street in terms of the bailouts and reforming the Corporate-State alliance, the movement became more concerned with focusing on the police and the physical occupations and building the base for radical revolution, they were not interested in a roll back of policy but of breaking down of all institutions and building the world they wanted to live in, of course you cannot build consensus on something as evasive as an anarchist vision. Breitbart claims Occupy takes its lessons from Alinsky's Rules for Radicals but if that were true they would have taken rule #7 to heart

7. ""A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag."" Don't become old news.""

Occupy couldn't let go of the incessant need to ""take"" space, to occupy ie Trinity Church, which did have a threatening arrogance to it. Many of the anarchists felt entitled to space and indeed had no problem destroying property (""diversity tactics"") never understanding that it alienated middle class and indeed many working class people. What I believe is Occupy at the end didn't care if it alienated those people because it wasn't their interest to attract that crowd whom they believed to be immersed in the Democrat party or (just as bad) ""reformists"".  Yes Occupy did lean towards socialism, communism but its main ideological force was anarchism. And those who called for liberal pacifist tactics were not the heart of the movement, by that I mean the hard-core Occupiers who wanted to see real revolutionary change and were not simply satisfied with airing their grievances through conventional protest marches (just look at Occupy Oakland). So in this sense Breitbart did uncover the ideological motive behind the movement and many of the tactics they used. Its also true they attracted a lot of people who were not aware of the aims of occupy or even the purpose of the occupation. The lack of a concrete message was indeed a tactic employed to bring in and convert as many people as possible to the anarchist principles and structure, nor were they forthcoming on the fact that a small elite controlled the money and therefore called the shots. I mostly found it to be a failure and if Brietbart was able to paint such a dark picture of the movement its because the movement left themselves open to such criticism. It was the vocal minority who made it difficult for the less volatile majority of protestors to remain grounded in the movement and so this is why there has been a dwindling of support. There were indeed many who welcomed the idea of an American economic collapse or system collapse, in that they hoped to build the anarchist communities, to re-structure the state and its institutions or as David Graeber describes ""hollow it out until there's nothing left and eventually it'll collapse."" And how is that done? By none participation in the State, occupying space and there build the world you want to see and pretend it already exists. If it sounds like intellectual clap trap it is. Its also why members would suggest to members not to vote.

As quoted in The Nation;

""The greater Occupy movement has rightly understood nonviolence not as a negation, the absence of destructiveness, but as a creative endeavor--a repertory for invention. But Occupy has been reluctant to be more explicit about it. An ""Open Letter to the Occupy Movement: Why We Need Agreements"" makes the case that Occupy should define itself, explicitly, as a movement of ""strategic nonviolent direct action."" By renouncing violence against persons or property, Occupy would enhance its appeal to the disabled and people of color, who have good reason to stay away from volatile confrontations. By isolating those who seize the spotlight by smashing things, it can prevent them from trampling the ethos of a brilliantly leaderless movement. Think about right-wing billionaires like David Koch and Sheldon Adelson. Would they rather see Occupy preoccupied with the cops, or fighting the banks? Smashing windows, or bringing down politicians who oppose reinstating Glass-Steagall?"" [...] [...]

There have been many pleas like this from gullible people who supported the movement and wanted to see it succeed BUT, as Breitbart points out, that may not be the goal after all.  Thinking mainstream they don't really see the intention behind the subversive acts.",1350086400,10,6633,4.916890080428955

5164286,5,B008H6GHKG,"Andrew Breitbart's brilliant expose of the birth and violent, depraved life of the hideous collection of anarchists, socialists, communists, felons, drug addicts, anti-semites and sex offenders known as Occupy Wall Street is a lasting testament of Mr Breitbart's service to his country. Occupy Unmasked makes two points crystal clear.

First, beyond the considerable financial cost & distress Americans underwent as a result of the repulsive marxist crime wave known as OWS, the real victims were the OWS participants themselves. Mr Breitbart's brilliant film reveals how small numbers of violent communists, anarchists and their financiers (Soros & unions) preyed on college students, the homeless, drug addicts and the mentally impaired. Sweeping the young, the naive, and the mentally challenged up into a party like atmosphere with free food, pay, rampant drug use and sex (including rape) swelled OWS incampments. Daily indoctrinations of hate, communism, anarchism, rebellion, class warfare and anti-semitism molded this rabble into violent, destructive, hate filled communist mobs.

Second, the OWS movement was an abject failure in providing any sort of left wing alternative to the Tea Party movement.  The Tea Party is a grassroots organization consisting of well mannered, decent, patriotic and freedom loving Americans. Their focus is on maintaining liberty & freedom, traditional American values and a limiting of government size & power, just as our founding fathers intended.  The vile insults & obscene charges leveled against the spotlessly clean, well mannered patriots of the Tea Party by president Obama, the democratic party, the left stream media and Hollywoods unhinged leftists couldn't stick. It was like trying to vilify the boy scouts.

The OWS movement was in essence the complete opposite of the Tea Party patriots. Shadily funded by George Soros  & unions, OWS's control & command structure consists of violent extremists. Communists, socialists and anarchists deftly inspired clueless college students, the homeless, drug addicts, deviants and the mentally impaired & limited with class warfare, hatred, violence, anti-semitism and communist ideology. OWS actions were so reprehensible, violent, criminal and repulsive that most Americans were immediately turned off. The longer the violent, repulsive OWS crime wave dragged on, the majority of Americans became increasing disgusted.

No amount of support and favorable coverage by president Obama, the democratic party and the leftstream media could convince Americans that OWS was anything other than a violent, dangerous mob of communists, socialists and anarchists.  There was no amount of lipstick in the world which could softed OWS's true face - that of a ginned up, hate filled mob of destructive, anti-American extremists and their clueless pawns.

The OWS movement was suspended by the democratic party, the unions and its global financiers like George Soros when it became glaring apparent that OWS had become a complete laughingstock and a detriment to president Obama's re-election bid. Just as quickly as it was created by the left, it's plug was pulled - another failure.

While socialist Europe has become accustomed to violent, rampaging mobs of socialists, anarchists and union thugs, OWS garnered little popularity or credibility in the US aside from its entertainment value. That being the unbelievable levels of stupidity, lawlessness, depravity and destruction by OWS. OWS encampment behaviors including drug abuse, theft, robbery, rape, homicide, destruction of private property, arson and riots repulsed Americans. For details & numbers on the OWS crime wave, just google OWS cime statistics.

Americans had pretty much had enough of OWS by the time a horrifying clip appeared on the news clearly showing OWS pouring a barrel of human urine & feces down a flight of stairs in New York.

As a civil libertarian I have no objection to anyone having their say, but this group was more than just a protest -- it's the stalking horse for a serious street-level revolutionary movement that will bring a host of abuses in its path.  The film is well done.  You get the feeling of being there and of actually encountering the people of the Occupy movement.

I was present at a number of radical protests in the 1960s, including one where a university building was burned and a person was killed.  This reminds me of that period -- the same intensity of emotion, radical rhetoric and mutually reinforcing actors in play.  When you contrast this to a Tea Party meeting, with its music, flags and Uncle Sam suits, you can see the kind of America each of them wants.  I marked it down one star because it does have a strong detectable bias, although that's in the nature of films like this.

5164383,5,B008H6GHKG,"This is a side of the occupy movement that you will not find in the TV and print media.  It is extraordinarily well produced, gripping in its intensity, and demonstrates how relatively wealthy young adults are being used by similarly wealthy ex-dropouts that have festered in their loathing for America since the 60's.  In between are some genuinely impoverished people who are relatively clueless about the movement, being paid for their attendance, and are being taught to hate ""the rich"" by self confessed anarchists.

The movie demonstrates how the seeds of mob rule can be sown and reap at least some limited degree of squalid insanity.  Unfortunately, the lessons learned and the tools used have a very violent history and one that has destroyed not a few overly decadent cultures with countless millions of their unsuspecting citizens.  In that sense, this movie has a disturbing side that could well have serious implications for your life, your children, your future and your freedom.

Also the fact that many of the commentators in the movie are former leftist activists - including one who started out supporting OWS - really lends credibility to the movie.

5164405,5,B008H6GHKG,"I, along with millions, was heartbroken with the news this March 1st that Andrew Breitbart had suddenly died of a heart attack.  A conservative warrior, gone far too soon.  Before his death, Andrew was working to expose the insidious elements of the Occupy Wall Street movement that the mainstream media refused to cover.  The result, the documentary Occupy Unmasked, is Andrew's final opus.

The first time you see Andrew in this film is chilling.  It makes you think of all that we have lost with his passing.  But as the film goes on, you become engrossed in the horrific details of the rapes, drugs, and other crimes committed and encouraged by OWS.  Your eyes are opened to the twisted media manipulation, the dizzying webs of radical connections, and the embrace of this disgusting movement by high level Democrats including President Obama.

This film is a powerful call to action.  Andrew is telling you, ""Wake up!  Take up my sword and fight back against the evils of the left!""

Flash forward to 2017, and now I know better. Breitbart was right on the money when he made this film. I consider him to be a visionary who was ahead of his time. The left really does want to create chaos and confusion for completely frivolous reasons, and they are willing to do it by any means necessary. Just look what they're doing on our college campuses (UC Berkeley, UC Davis, New York State College, The Evergreen State College, Middlebury College, etc.). It's terrorism, plain and simple.

8528051,2,B008H6GHKG,"Occupy Unmasked is a documentary featuring Andrew Breitbart and David Horowitz. It's directed by Stephen Bannon, the same Bannon who took over Breitbart News after Andrew Breitbart's death and is now a presidential advisor.

The documentary is run-of-the-mill pro-capitalist, pro-banker, pro-war, at least implicitly pro-globalization, while also being anti-union, anti-Obama and, surprise, anti-socialist. Breitbart had connections with the Tea Party movement, but Occupy Unmasked sounds more Neo-Con or Con in general than specifically conservative-libertarian-isolationist. Perhaps it's a deliberate move to get a wider audience? The main theses of the film is that Occupy Wall Street and the wider Occupy movement weren't spontaneous and that they were dominated by anarchist and Communist groups which really want a violent revolution in the United States. However, there is also another more conspiratorial theme running through the documentary. While Occupy are a bunch of unreliable reds, they are apparently also a front for the Obama administration, which uses the movement to deflect attention from the Tea Party, the real opposition, and from the administration's own problems (deficits, etc).

Personally, I wasn't particularly shocked by Occupy Unmasked. Of course it wasn't spontaneous. Neither was the Tea Party, so what's your point? Of course most activists were leftists of various stripes. Like most such movements, there were moderate and militant factions, with Team Breitbart-Horowitz concentrating on the latter. Except sometimes, when they smear union leaders such as Jimmy Hoffa Jr (sic) as some kind of unpatriotic pinkos! A more interesting fact emerging from the documentary is that the media establishment and sections of the political ditto *did* express strong sympathies for the Occupy movement. Occupy Unmasked claims that this proves the liberal establishment were behind the protests. A more sober interpretation is that they tried to co-opt it, the usual Democratic strategy towards protests of this sort.

It's interesting to reflect on the trajectory of the radical anti-capitalist left. During the 1990's, large segments of the left were anti-globalist. Most of the right was associated with globalization. One of the few exceptions, Pat Buchanan, actually expressed some sympathy for the battle of Seattle in 1999. Today, by contrast, the left has been obviously co-opted by the DNC and the globalists. The revolutionary left is simply the unruly tail of the neo-liberal/left-liberal globalist coalition. Meanwhile, the alliances have changed. Steve Bannon now works for Donald Trump, who won the presidential elections thanks to the deplorable White working class vote. And guess who says he wants to work with Trump? None other than Jimmy Hoffa Jr, the supposed bte noire of the unionista underworld! Clearly, somebody somewhere decided to change tactics. It's also interesting that none other than basic Cold Warrior Horowitz have jumped unto the Trump Train, presumably hoping that the new POTUS will finally decide to nuke 'Nam or whoever is the godless enemy this week.

On the one hand, this means that Occupy Unmasked feels very anachronistic. On the other hand, however, it also (ironically) means that the documentary was prescient on one point: yes, the left really does work with the Democrats. However, it's not an alliance against capitalism. Rather, it's an alliance with its globalist sector against the nationalists and populists!

Perhaps Darth Bannon should make a new documentary",1486771200,,3540,5.597014925373134
