5746626,4,B00CX0KJYC,"""Codebreaker: The Alan Turing Story"" (2013 release from the UK; 81 min.) is a documentary about Alan Turing, a British math genius who can be called the father of the computer. As the documentary opens, we are reminded that ""the drama in this film is based on Alan Turing's writings, historical records, and accounts of those who knew him"". After a short introduction where we see Turing talk to his shrink in Manchester, 1952, the documentary cuts back to the beginnings with archival pictures from his days at Sherborne School in 1926 where he develops a strong friendship (if not more) with a class mate. The class mate's death in 1930, just as they were about to start university at Cambridge was devastating to Turing, Turing eventually releases a paper in 1936 ""On Computable Numbers"", which signals the true dawn of the digital age, confirmed by such interviewees as Steve Wozniak (who co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs) and others. Turing eventually broke the code of the German Enigma machine in WWII, a pivotal moment and making him a true hero in every respect. Yet, because of the secrecy of that program, Turing never got the recognition for it, and his homosexual orientation resulted in many troubles. At one point, Turing writes a letter to a friend when things are rough, and he signs off with ""Yours in distress, Alan"". To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out,

Couple of comments: first, watching this gripping documentary gives you a great perspective on the historical importance Turing had on many levels. Second, apart from the many interviews giving insight to Turing's life, there are quite a few historical re-enactments, primarily of Turing talking to his shrink, which I felt were the least effective part of the documentary. Instead, it was fascinating to watch how exactly Turing broke the code of the German Enigma machine, and later how he expanded into other fields such as mathematical biology in the early 50s (showing a mathematical basis as to why, say, stripes formed on the tiger or the zebra). In essence, Turing broke the code of nature similar to his breaking the code of the Enigma Machine. Third, it is truly shameful how this man, a true war hero, was treated by British authorities in the post-WWII era for being gay (which the British government later, after his death, apologized for).

Bottom line, I found this documentary to be very informative, and compelling on so many levels. It proves again that facts always trump fiction if you have a good story to tell. ""Codebreaker: The Alan Turing Story"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1392854400,18,2643,4.8841870824053455
5746647,5,B00CX0KJYC,"An ""OH MY GOD"" story of Alan Turing. What was done to this man is beyond imagination. I saw it with friends and we were reeling afterwards. I  though about this poor man for days. Just think what difference in the world he could have made had he lived.
A great production  Ed Stoppard was very good playing against the Dr. played by Henry Goodman.",1424822400,3,347,4.323076923076923
5746648,4,B00CX0KJYC,"This is a great documentary of Alan Turing.  It seems to project a unbiased account of his life during WWII without the sensationalizing that we often see in popular movies.

5746651,5,B00CX0KJYC,"How ignorant people were in the early 1900's and late 1900's and all through history and now probably! The story of Alan Turing as told through an actor talking to a psychiatrist, interviews of people who know him and historical footage. This is a documentary with actors now and then. I loved how it was presented. The story is a sad one though. A very nave genius who came up with the way to break the German's Enigma code during WW2, almost single handedly and probably ended the war much earlier than it would have otherwise. he came up with the binary codes used in computers today. Was he a hero? No! he was persecuted and chemically castrated by the British for being a homosexual. Such a sad story but one to see because it is so well done. At the closing credits the British Government apologized to him in 2008....they deemed him a hero. Too late! he killed himself in 1952 at the age of 41 because they were turning him into a woman and the chemicals were ruining his amazing brain.",1419984000,2,993,4.4316939890710385

8587053,5,B00CX0KJYC,"I loved this story. A sad and tearful tail but not the first and not likely the last.  I identify so well with this story as I do with ""Good Will Hunting"" It is my story in many ways. The only part I didn't like was how lacking it was in the use of ""estrogen"" side-effects. It told much of what it does but a little research would have given a much better picture of the number of suicides then and now from using these hormones as a court order or by self choice. While we have come along way as a society in whole there is still too much ignorance and hate in the world.  Alan is right up there with  Nikola Tesla.  Both forgotten heroes during their lifetime.  Yet, they have so much to offer our evolving society even today and in the future.",1497484800,,746,4.082191780821918

8587055,5,B00CX0KJYC,"Quite frankly, this is one of the best films I have seen.  It smoothly manages to be both a film and a documentary and is fascinating.  You don't have to love math, coding or war for this to be captivating.  It is simply a great life story with an illumination into one of Great Britain's darker social trends, which closely reflects how the U.S. handled the same issues.",1480464000,2,371,4.426470588235294
8587056,5,B00CX0KJYC,"Not to be missed. Dialogue taken from Turing's own words and interviews with people who knew him.

How much longer are the right wingers who demonize gays going to turn a blind eye to world changing positive contributions made by so called ""degenerates""?",1434067200,2,393,4.954545454545454
8587057,5,B00CX0KJYC,"My first introduction to Alan Turing was through seeing a play called ""Breaking The Code"".  I saw this in a small production in Los Angeles in the late 90s.  I later saw the same play presented on Masterpiece Theater on PBS with Derek Jacoby playing the part of Turing.  This is a wonderful production and I highly recommend it.  (It's available on U Tube streaming).  I also recently saw the film ""The Imitation Game"", and I enjoyed this film although it had some flaws.
The docudrama presented here (Code Breaker)  gives a much more personal look at Alan Turing, and for me shows great empathy for him
The interviews with his colleagues from University and from Bletchley Park are wonderful, and give you a very personal perspective on the man.
Alan Turing is finally at this point being given the recognition he deserves.  His work during WWII saved thousands of lives, and his early work on digital computers was ground breaking.",1431993600,2,933,4.75776397515528

8587061,5,B00CX0KJYC,"Ever since Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the UK made a public apology posthumously in 2009 to Alan Turing for the way Britain treated this great Mathematician and war-time hero, there has been a set of documentary and feature films as well as books to rehabilitate his name. Britain certainly owes him this because it is really appalling how they treated him after the war as a law-breaker and made him opt for chemical castration in order to 'rid' him of his homosexual tendencies. Even more so when we read that the Queen 'pardoned' Turing in 2013 on his birth centenary as if the great man was the one at fault. Given all this, this documentary goes some way in Turing's rehabilitation through a docu-drama approach. There are interviews with people who knew Alan Turing personally in their lives - like his nephew Dermot Turing, his fiance Joan Clarke, his  colleague at Bletchley Park, Rolf Noskwith,  and many others. Then there is the dramatized version of Alan Turing's therapy sessions with Franz Greenbaum, his Jungian Psychoanalyst, during the final eighteen months of his life. The inter-play of drama and documentary is done well to narrate the story of Turing.

The portrayal of Turing by Ed Stoppard is quite soft and gentle and not as a somewhat abrasive personality as brought out in a recent film on Turing. In Greenbaum's clinic, Turing is shown as a peripatetic client rather than one on the couch, as in popular imagination. These therapy sessions with Greenbaum zero in on important events and moments in Turing's young life that eventually may have something to do with him committing suicide at the young age of 41. Though the sessions are interesting,  they do not throw too much new light on Turing's own views on being gay. There are also no great revelations in these sessions about his relationship with Christopher Morcom, his boyhood friend and confidant. Turing, while talking about Christopher with Greenbaum, recounts the contents of the letter that he wrote Christopher's mother after her son's death. It shows the tender side of his personality.

The film does a good job of rehabilitating Turing's name because it brings out poignantly the atrocious way he was treated by British officialdom. It suggests that his suicide as a result might have been one of the greatest disservices ever done to the advance of the field of Mathematics. Through interviews with PC pioneers like Steve Wozniak and other academics from Cambridge, the film shows how Turing's vision of Mathematics was so expansive as to include processes in Nature. In Biology, he shows the application of mathematics to the biological process that causes an organism to develop its shape, like a tiger developing stripes or flowers having a certain number of petals etc. In cell biology, Turing proposed a mathematical model that speculated how cells differentiate themselves into bone cells or blood cells as the embryo grows. We see him musing over consciousness and artificial intelligence in the 1930s, at a time when even the first digital computer had not yet been built. We see him outlining the famous 'Turing test' to detect AI. The film does not focus much on the Enigma machine or his war-time work at Bletchley Park, probably because that is what every other film on the subject is focused on.

The documentary is just 75 minutes long and I found it very engrossing all the way. It should be seen more as a tribute to this great Mathematician rather than as one that provides insight into the various issues that puzzle pundits about Alan Turing even today.",1429315200,,3571,4.913764510779436
