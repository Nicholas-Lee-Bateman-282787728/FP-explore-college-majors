She loved it though, best birthday she's ever had, apparently.

You know what you are getting when you buy this product. If you liked the show, the boot legged copies selling the entire show are OK but have the Disney logo in the corner, and some episodes are a little screwy.  For quality, I would recommend this product over the boot legged ones if you have the money.

I did hear a rumor that the rest of the seasons will be available in 2010 or 2011... Maybe a legitimate entire show dvd pack will be released.",1242518400,6,656,4.344262295081967
