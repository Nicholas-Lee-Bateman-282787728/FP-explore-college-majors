I think for an American audience who may not understand some aspects of UK history, some of the jokes may not be so funny.  Many of the jokes refer to the angst many Scottish feel towards the English, and vice versa.  I think that someone who does not know how the different countries within the U.K.  try to distinguish themselves from one another in terms of culture may not get some of the humor in this film.  But it is funny, nonetheless!  You have to like for lack of a better term, 'stupid' comedies to enjoy this one.  It has a similar feel to Jean DuJardin's, ""OSS 117"" films.  Very enjoyable for me, but you have to have a taste for this sort of thing!",1337212800,,836,4.37012987012987
