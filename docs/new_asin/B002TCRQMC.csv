The 1st episode was half lost, due to so many stops & skips and episode 2 only got about 5 maybe 6 cut scenes in it and I saw some Indians and then it went on to the girl, Della Forsyth and the rodeo guy she loved! Really bad I tell you. I have ordered Volume 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and they were all decent, but this one, Volume 8, I am thoroughly disgusted with! I don't think I will chance  Vol. 9 and the others! :(",1525046400,,474,3.6019417475728157
