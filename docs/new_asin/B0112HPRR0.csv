Most of us are well acquainted with the vampire movies made in the past. Every so often a new film comes along that tries to alter the understanding we have of these bloodsucking creatures. Take for instance the glittery heart throbs found in the TWILIGHT series that had young girls longing to be loved by the good looking vampire and dedicated horror hounds groaning at the change to their beloved icon. THE STRANGER doesnt really take on either role as dictated by these films, giving us something else instead.

A stranger named Martin (Cristobal Tapia Montt) arrives in a small northwestern town and stops at the home of Peter (Nicolas Duran) to ask if his girlfriend is there. Peter informs him that she died several years ago and a distraught Martin leaves. That evening Martin is sitting in a park when a group of young troublemakers come upon him. Led by Caleb (Ariel Levy) they beat him while Martin puts up no resistance, leaving him for dead. All the while Peter, a talented spray paint artists/tagger, has watched from nearby.

Peter calls in the incident to the police and Officer De Luca (Luis Gnecco) arrives on the scene. The only problem is that De Luca is Calebs father and he recruits his son to help get rid of the body. Summoned on another call, he leaves and tells Caleb to finish burying the body. A total slacker, Caleb leaves it under a tarp. Having watched it all, Peter pulls Martin from the hole in the ground and takes him home to help him.

When evidence at the gravesite leads De Luca to the realization Peter has watched it all, he sends his son and the gang to take out the boy and Martin. This sets in motion events they had no clue would happen as Martin is actually a vampire tired of life. Peter is beaten within an inch of his life and his home set on fire. Martin rises to help defend Peter, setting Caleb on fire and nearly killing him.

With De Luca seeing that Peter has miraculously recovered from the beating he had taken earlier, he forces him to do the same to save Caleb. Now with both turned into vampires the story moves forward and an eventual showdown between all involved is inevitable.

While adding something new to the genre the movie doesnt really do enough to maintain your interest from start to finish. Its not that its terrible it just feels like it spins in circles and ends up going nowhere. The self-deprecating vampire wants to die and end the line of vampires he is a part of and yet feels compelled to save Peter for a reason I won't reveal here. But in so doing he completely reverses his goal from what he intended, the cycle has a chance to continue.

The effects work here is minimal when it comes to gore but make ups wise very well done, especially the burn make up on Caleb after he tries to incinerate Peter. The film is dark most of the time including day shots which didn't work for me. While this end results might be a step up from a few terribly made low budget flicks in the end this one for me was okay but not enough to recommend it with the exception of vampire flick fans.",1445904000,3,3113,4.4223385689354275

7320615,1,B0112HPRR0,Bad acting.  Bad plot. Needless foul language galore.  Eli Roth tries to make hip exploitation films but he fails.  He should have called it quits after Cabin Fever.  Total waste of time and money.  Avoid at all costs!,1445644800,,218,4.631578947368421

7320619,4,B0112HPRR0,"While I don't think they ever mention the word vampire here, and instead refer to themselves as sick, it is made obvious that were dealing with vampires. Kind of taking on a Near Dark quality. Now a lot of people will say that vampires have lost their appeal, but I would disagree. While movies like Twilight did stain the classic movie monster, some of the most impressive vampire movies of all time have come out post-Twilight. And this is one that I rather enjoyed. Great acting, a really good story and some solid direction. Not to mention the fact that they don't shy away from bloodshed. This ended up being a great movie in league with other recent(ish) vampire movies like Stake Land and Kiss of the Damned. It does fall short of brilliance, but a damn fine movie nonetheless.",1438300800,18,784,4.607142857142857
8723393,2,B0112HPRR0,"What a shame, this Chilean movie gave an interesting and different take on ""vampires"" but lost it in very bad acting and if it is dubbed it was dubbed very badly. A mysterious stranger, Martin (Cristobal Tapia-Montt), arrives seeking to kill his wife Ana (Lorenza Izzo, The Green Inferno, Aftershock) who suffers from a very dangerous disease that makes her as addicted to human blood as he is. But when he discovers that Ana has been dead for a couple of years, Martin decides to commit suicide to definitively eradicate this peculiar disease which imbues his blood with healing powers. Before he can do it, however, Martin is brutally attacked by three local thugs, lead by Caleb, the son of a corrupt police lieutenant. The incident suddenly initiates a chain-reaction that plunges the community into a bloodbath. this was the description given and as I said, it could have been an interesting movie but it was never realized.....will not recommend even to die hard vamp fans.",1492732800,,979,4.903614457831325
8723394,5,B0112HPRR0,"I bought this movie after I saw it. It's different kind of horror movie, a vampire with a conscience. It's the type of movie where your glad when the bad guy gets killed, and feel sympathy for the supposed to be bad vampire. The story was very good and the direction was great. Enjoy.",1473638400,,284,4.277777777777778

8723400,2,B0112HPRR0,"Part of Eli Roths Chilewood where he is making cheap horror and suspense movies in the country of Chile. Basic plot of a stranger who has some type of disease, looking for his long lost son in a small town, If you seen knock-knock, green inferno, or aftershock that will give you an idea of what type of film atmosphere this has.",1454198400,,329,4.32258064516129
