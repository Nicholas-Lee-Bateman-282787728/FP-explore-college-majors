8393928,5,B003BV8I0O,"""The Curse of Father Cardona"" (Dominican Republic, 2005) is a Caribbean version of ""The Crime of Father Amaro.""

The Dominican Anthony Alvarez plays the Mexican priest Jeronimo, who is sent by his superiors to the town of Constanza to investigate a strange case that is making nervous all the islanders.

The young priest has to deal with superstitions, gossip and jealousies that keep everybody divided, while fighting against himself and his own fears awakened by Flor (Zoe Saldana), an uninhibited girl who, as the name implies, is at the Flower of her age.

The Dominican director, Felix German, chose comedy to deal with that fine line between faith and fanaticism, with bold and parodic scenes, as the priest Carmona throwing flatulence and cursing people during the Eucharist.

The humorous entertainment is a well-made blend of folk sayings and quirky characters that create a pump that causes laughter as the quintessential Dominican dessert, the habichuelas con dulce (sweet beans), which constitute the trigger for this fun and candid mess.

Among the bizarre group you will see Father X, a priest exorcist; Doa Hortensia, a catechist ""crusader"" and, of course, Father Carmona; they create laughter with the slightest provocation and gesture.

The film has already been a box office hit in Cineteca Nacional, the Cycle of Cinema of the Dominican Republic. Without a filming industry, they show what can be done with a lot of enthusiasm and talent.",1389398400,,1458,5.156779661016949
