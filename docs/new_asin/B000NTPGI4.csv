8325496,5,B000NTPGI4,"I am a repeat buyer of CookingonDVD's ethnic cooking dvds. I started with an Indian sampler on Amazon which includes on the dvd the recipes to be printed in Word format. Each dvd includes native chefs demonstrating their recipes which all of us can make. Most of the ingredients which are always shown before the actual demonstration can be gotten in you big supermarkets. This Polish cooking dvd includes 15 recipes which cover main dishes, desserts and vegtable dishes. Their perogi recipe includes 7 different fillings so the dvd actually demos 21 recipes. The demos are not rushed and they are available individually or by a Play All button. They turn into delicious and inexpensive dishes that you will be able to pronounce in the native language whether Turkish, Polish, or various Indian dialects. The price con't be beat and they have out many Eastern European and Indian plus African cooking dvds. And more to come. I own 6 so far and am looking forward to many more. If all their videos are not available on Amazon check their own site for the complete descriptions.",1191974400,4,1076,4.821621621621621
