8165683,3,B000M2DMSS,"When I took a semester of Latin in high school, I learned that the Latin word for ""city"" only referred to Rome.  While history book emphasize that the Roman empire was huge, too often they only focus on the City itself.  (Crowe's ""The Gladiator"" may differ from this.)  I appreciated learning about other areas of the Empire.

This work has 3-D graphics that many may love, but they left me non-plussed.  I appreciated this work because it did not just discuss old buildings.  I especially loved learning about existing mosaics.  They also cover living quarters, baths, and even latrines!  (The 21st-Century inhabitant in me doesn't care to imagine the smell of that place!)

I love that they contrasted Roman imperialism from later British and French versions.  This work emphasized that North Africans could become senators and other people of power.  This was an integrative type of domination, if such a thing is possible.

This work has about 4 interviewees, all British, both male and female.  One man has bad teeth and American viewers may have their stereotypes of U.K. dental care confirmed here.  (Think ""The Simpsons"" and ""The Big Book of British Smiles."")",1170547200,,1167,4.979274611398964
