8344637,1,B001UQ099K,This was not what I expected. I thought this was the finale to the television series. I was somehow disappointed.,1387065600,,113,4.7
8344638,4,B001UQ099K,"First off I'd like to say a wonderful conclusion to the show even if it doesn't follow the manga!
Second BEWARE OF PIRATED COPIES! Do your research because the subs for them aren't worth it.

And lastly I'd like to say that everyone who says ""this isn't the original cast"" must not have watched the Japanese version, but the Korean version. I guarantee all of the original actors in the Japanese version of Hana Yori Dango are here.",1381190400,,432,4.538461538461538
8344639,5,B001UQ099K,"It was a nice little storyline.  I didn't like that it wasn't the original cast, but they did try their best to make the new actors resemble the originals as best they could in looks and personalities.  Still undecided if that was a good or bad thing.  If you never watched the series, then it would be a good stand alone movie which is why I gave it 5 stars.  I think the series actors left the movie actors a lot to live up to.  Some hits and some misses there.

As for the English subtitles, mine worked just fine.",1379894400,,517,4.12

8344641,3,B001UQ099K,I did not realize that it was a movie that did not include the original cast...it was okay but nothing like what I was hoping for..,1371427200,,131,4.076923076923077
8344642,4,B001UQ099K,"I watched all the episodes of Boys Over Flowers -2009 South Korean television series starring Ku Hye-sun, Lee Min-ho, Kim Hyun-joong of SS501. Loved that series.
I was expecting to see the some of the same actors but they are not in this movie;so that is why I did not give this a 5 star rating.

I still enjoyed the movie so I was still happy that I purchased it. Subtitles are very clear and easy to read. Movie quality was excellent. Price was worth it.",1365120000,,456,4.3023255813953485
8344643,5,B001UQ099K,"My wife has always been a fan of anything doing with Hana Yori Dango since watching Meteor Garden.  I bought this along with the television series of Hana Yori Dango.  She was wary at first, since she really enjoyed Meteor Garden and Korean's Boys Over Flowers, but after watching this movie, she loved it and watched it three more times afterwards.  She actually enjoyed the movie more than the Hana Yori Dango tv series, and said it was a great ending to the storyline.",1354406400,,471,4.583333333333333
