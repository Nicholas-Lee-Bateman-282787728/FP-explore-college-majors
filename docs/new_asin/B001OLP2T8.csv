3730427,5,B001OLP2T8,"I bought this video for my husband who is a big fan of Patton and could recite every one of his quotes.  I ordered this on 22 November and received it today.  Within 30 minutes my husband had the DVD in his player to watch it.

The combination of both archival news footage and computer graphics had me pulled into the battle as soon as I heard the tank rounds explode in the TV room.

This DVD set of three discs runs over seven hours long.  The story, narration and scenery pull you into the battle.  Tank rounds never stop exploding in the background as you go from scratchy video to CGI to talking heads and back to scratchy video as the battle goes on, as if in real time. And, like zooming in and out with Google Earth, you get to see aerial views of the battlefield as well as lateral shots and ground shots.  Old-looking maps of the warfront show the US and Nazi armies moving toward each other in the Benelux area.

The transformation between film footage and CGI is continuous, as the CGI helps continue the battle scenes.  You may see one scene of a tank getting hit.  That very same tank then turns into a computer-enhanced graphic that turns around and fires a shot back.  This is thrilling, exciting and scary all rolled into one!

Between battle scenes old veterans of this battle retell their version of the fight.  This is classic History Channel quality.  Even the narrator sounds so History Channelish.

My husband gives this production five stars, I give it four.  My complaint is the background superimposition of what looks like an old compass dial coming at you while you are listening to a veteran retell his story, or a historian comment on the action.  It's not noticable at first, but in most every archival footage there is that compass dial coming at you like shooting stars or snow aiming for the camera.  What is that all about?  My husband was so engrossed in the story he says it didn't bother him, but to me it was annoying.  This did not take away from the subject matter, though:  Patton was an amazing strategist.

Thus, from two history fans, 4+ stars.  A great gift for any Patton fan.",1259107200,25,2124,4.473958333333333
3730428,4,B001OLP2T8,"I was waiting for Patton 360 to come out on DVD for a long time, but I must say that I was mildly disappointed. Frankly, there was way too much going on. Instead of focusing on one aspect at a time, like the ground campaign or naval help, the show tried to tell the story of everything and everybody all at once. I understand that the producers were trying to be complete, but I think they sacrificed the personal aspects of the war. I loved Dogfights and Battle 360 because I was literally on the edge of my seat during some of the battles, but Patton 360 failed to deliver suspense. Perhaps Dogfights and Battle 360 was more condusive to showing a mano-a-mano fight than Patton 360 because Patton 360 focused more on strategy and the overall campaign than individual fights.
However, I found Patton 360 to be very enlightening. Obviously, I just described how it wasn't very good as a movie experience, but in terms of historical documentation, Patton 360 is excellent. I agree that it showed Pattons prowess both as a tactician and as a leader, going in depth about how his troops would be arranged and how he would lead from the front. Other documentaries I have seen focused entirely on his personal life or on his impact on the war, but this series showed his tactical strategies, something which I haven't seen much of.
tl,dr: Not that great as a movie and dramatic experience, but awesome as a documentary, 3.5 stars.",1258156800,7,1425,4.592156862745098
3730429,5,B001OLP2T8,"First off, anyone who has a problem with how General George S. Patton Jr. got things done doesn't understand war. Sure, in his private life he was flawed (who isn't) but when it came down to being a monster in the throes of war there was no one better than ""Old Blood and Guts"". Does anyone who thinks that General Patton was this crazed war monger understand what horrors existed in WWII? You can read about it and imagine it all you like but you needed to be there to truly understand the period from 1940 thru 1945. Patton was the quintessential fighting leader! With the strategic mind of Napoleon di Buonaparte, the charisma of Alexander the Great, the majesty of Julius Caesar, the willpower of William the Conqueror and the dedication and loyalty of George Washington, Patton was the perfect soldier to inspire all his men to do what was necessary in order to win against the bloody reality that was breathing down on the American dream. He was the RIGHT man at the RIGHT time and the RIGHT place!! Even FDR, Marshall, Churchill and Eisenhower knew this fact and despite Patton's controversial actions, put up with his aberrations because they had to. America and the world needed Patton and everyone knew it. Hitler and the entire Axis were fearful of Patton, even at the height of their own powers!! This just shows you how incredible Patton's mystique really was. The series; ""Patton 360"", does a beautiful job demonstrating the triumphs and tragedies that Patton had to endure during the war years. Any student of history would do well to look into this documentary, and see just how much of a genius the man was at a time when we really needed a leader like him. Anyone can sit behind their computer, television, book, etc., today and question many of Patton's methods. His accomplishments in war are just astounding, simply the greatest achievements in military history! He captured 81,000 sq. miles of territory (the size of France), he captured over 1,250,000 prisoners (nearly 5 armies) while his army was only about 250,000, he killed or wounded a 1/2 million Germans and he did all this at a faster pace than anyone in the history of war!!! All doubters must ask themselves; If you went to war and you had to put your life on the line and believe in someone who would lead you to victory, no matter what the cost, who would you choose? This was the genius of Patton,and in my humble opinion, Patton is GOD!!!",1257206400,4,2426,4.6573426573426575
3730430,3,B001OLP2T8,"Im between the two extremes of the previous reviewers.  I disagree with the negative reviewer that the series did nothing to document Patton's tactical skill. On the contrary it did that quite well. Further, it documented the skills of his subordinate commanders which any student of WW2 WOULD be interested in. Also, it paid due respect to the skills of the German commanders. THIS the series did very well. Rommel and Kesselring are of course well celebrated in the espisodes. But outside of students of the subject, who knows that much about Manteuffel? Yet here he is given justified attention. So are the early battles against the Vichy French.  Where I agree with the negative reviewer was the repetition of the simulated graphics and stock footage, although some of the footage IS rare. In short, the series could have been reduced in length and been more impactful.
3.5 stars.",1255996800,35,884,4.926174496644295
3730431,1,B001OLP2T8,"I really had to force myself to watch this.  The mindless repetition of the same graphics over and over was a real turn off.  It is truly terrible.  Used as filler, a very few clips of Patton prancing comically is shown every few minutes of the film.  The computer generated graphics look like a computer game and do nothing to add to the production. The same grapics are shown over and over and over.
  The narrative ignores numerous important facets of his career and primarily is celebratory to the hero.  The film does little to make him unique in just what about his strategies and tactics made him noteworthy.  Any student of WW2 will be disappointed by the complete lack of historical scholarship in this production.",1254787200,20,723,4.682539682539683
3730432,5,B001OLP2T8,"I knew General Patton was a great battlefield commander.  Despite his flaws, he was still the right man to do the job of smashing the Hitler-Nazi machine.  This what the series, Patton 360, brings out.  It clearly portrays the genius of a man driven to wreak havoc on the enemy.  I never realized, until now, just how much of a struggle it was to win back France, and the obstacles that had to be overcome.  I have no doubt that if Patton was given full sway, the war might well have shortened by almost a year.  But judge for yourself.  Watch or buy the series.  Enjoy the clever and artful way computer graphics have been combined with historical footage to give a complete and exciting story of World War II's most controversial but successful general - and appreciate how America always seems to come with a man at the hour of her need or peril.",1245628800,55,849,4.432258064516129

3730439,4,B001OLP2T8,"I would like to express my appreciation for the newsreel footage of General Patton and others displayed in this production. Watching and listening to the audio and video of General Patton delivering a speech to the troops was my first experience of seeing and hearing the man. Much has been said of the man's voice being high pitched and his language being vulgar, but I was favorably impressed. The General's temperament and foibles were adequately conveyed in the encounters in field hospitals. but some tragic events occurred during the campaign in Sicily that were labeled as massacres.

The American temperament was considered too passive and timid for an effective combat soldier, and General Patton attempted to motivate his troops and harden them for the carnage that was to come, but his rhetoric was considered responsible for inciting unnecessary violence. I also believe that the final reason for Patton's removal from command was misstated as his combative attitude toward Soviet forces, which isn't understated, when it appears that it was more a political decision stemming from his employment of former Nazi Party members in his post-war administration of Bavaria.

I applaud your inclusion of very graphic images and film footage of engagements and the aftermath of battle. Civil war Union General Sherman stated that ""War is all Hell"" and on numerous occasions expressed the opinion that it must be horrible in its execution to discourage its being prolonged. Confederate General Lee commented that ""It is a good thing that war is so terrible lest we should become too fond of it"". A philosopher named George Santayana said ""those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it"". By revealing the horror of war this production actually discourages war.

Boy, was that same introduction before each segment annoying. Thanks be for the remote control and fast forward. The monologue was generally quite good, but the computer generated images (CGI) rather than more actual footage was a bit much. Some elements had to rely on CGI to demonstrate events and concepts, and they did so convincingly. After all, one does not want to film a tank firing while facing the gun or a napalm bomb impacting on enemy vehicles while in the target area. Likewise, the release of bombs can be recorded from inside the aircraft routinely, but the images created by CGI displaying the underside of the aircraft during the bomb release safely conveys the concept of observing from below.

My greatest complaint would probably be the repetitious use of stock footage from actual events and CGI. As the narrative unwinds one sees the same image of a vehicle being hit while the description of events is supposedly happening in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, France, Belgium and then Germany. General Patton certainly got around, but a burnt out hulk making a cameo appearance in several locations reprising its destruction becomes boring. The scenes recounting almost incessant fire and maneuver from ships, tanks, artillery, mortar and small arms could be a bit irritating or unnerving, even though most of it is in CGI.

As a former ""tanker"", I was most disturbed not by actual footage of events and their aftermath as I was by CGI images of flames superimposed on images of people and vehicles. The actual footage of exploding ordinance, burning vehicles and even the extermination and concentration camps did not offend me even remotely as much as CGI flames.  Anyone who has neither experienced nor observed the tragedy of a tank on fire is unlikely to experience my visceral reaction and  utter revulsion at depicting flames on a tank. Tank fires are probably the most universally shared nightmare of tankers of all nations, and adding CGI flames struck me as gratuitous violence.",1448236800,2,3788,5.080385852090032

3730484,2,B001OLP2T8,"The rapid change in views are frequent in this series, and no wonder: at least some of the footage being shown is NOT from the period being discussed, sometimes not even relative to the area being discussed. For instance, real-life footage of Tiger tanks showing them moving through some sort of small trees... highly unlikely in North Africa. I think the producers might have hoped that by using historic footage a second or so at a time no one would notice. The animation is not as good as some of the previous series of this sort I have seen.

The best part of this program was the use of interviews with veterans from Patton's campaigns. Their insight and stories made it interesting but was undermined by the ""flash"" method of providing the background material.",1375142400,5,766,4.7164179104477615

It's a decent and rather bloodless way to show this story. They do have some real pictures of dead people though and burning tanks. The show is well written and is worth watching to get a overview of the conflict. THey didn't have a huge budget here so the cgi is average though. I think anyone interested in military history should enjoy this series. When I was young , I wouldn't have even dreamed of a show like this.

3730509,1,B001OLP2T8,"This series has several serious problems.

First, the background music is so loud and pounding, it actually drowns out the narration. This was especially true at the beginning of the ""American Blitzkrieg"" episode. Couldn't an editor have actually watched this episode before burning it on the DVD? For the other episodes, I missed probably 50% of the narration due to the excessive volume of the background music. And note: there are NO SUBTITLES.

Not that the breathless narration was informative. It mostly takes the form of U.S. government propaganda films of the era, you know, the dirty Nazi krauts have backed the fearless true-blue Americans in a corner, but due to the American bravery and plain ole goodness, they overcome the odds and are victorious!

About the only relief to be found is during the expert interviews. Even here, things are uneven. Several no-name military guys in uniform give their opinions, what do they know? On the other hand, the editors had the wisdom to feature Rick Atkinson, author of the excellent books, ""An Army at Dawn"" and ""The Day of Battle.""

As other reviewers have noted, the repetitive use of computer graphics is amateurish and not even that realistic. It's as though they had to do something to fill up the time and three DVDs.

Which brings me to my biggest complaint: the series is an inefficient use of time. They use ten episodes to explain what could have been done in maybe two. I'm reminded of Christian preachers who need to fill up sermon time and so they use ten words to explain what could have been explained in two. I'm busy; I don't want to waste time watching repetitive computer graphics.

Save your money!",1318809600,6,1672,4.808362369337979

I found this a little while late.  The series is extremely well made and is well above History's Normal standards. The series followed General George S. Patton and the units he commanded, from the Operation Torch landings in Morocco in 1942, through the campaigns in North Africa and Sicily, and in the battles across Northwest Europe.  The only thing that is misleading about the package and online description is that is the only season of the show.",1311552000,3,919,5.58273381294964
3730511,5,B001OLP2T8,Recommended. This is a well done documentary that provides excellent insight into Patton's WW II campaigns and his relentless leadership style.,1304812800,2,143,5.857142857142857

3730523,4,B001OLP2T8,"Not to repeat what others have written about 'Patton 360' it follows somewhat in the same vein as Battle 360's Season 1 which catalogue's the Carrier Enterprise's involvement in the Pacifc conflict.

""Patton 360"" equally draws you into the battle, but is a must for history fanatics and Patton historians or serious students of the era. ""Old Blood'n Guts"" General Patton in spite of his obvious character flaws, notable disdain for authority along the infamous 'slapping incident' was probably the only man that could have achieved what he did. Patton's ""Lust for Glory"" was undoubtably what drove him to the victories he acheived and was perhaps the right, and only General that could have done this.

A few of the CG effects were a bit bland of the land conflicts and tank battles, but most other re-enacted scenes based on eye witness accounts and records remain unparalleled similary to the aforementioned in this series by the History Channel.

highly recommended.",1297728000,,969,5.04375
3730524,4,B001OLP2T8,"I stumbled upon this set while browsing through Amazon and bought this set right away.  I don't have cable and miss getting to see some of the tremendous programs that the History channel has to offer.  This set is fantastic!

My only complaint is how it is produced.  For me, the constant flow of ""special effects"" take away from the overall program.  After watching for a bit, you DO get used to it, but I don't like the style of the production.  It would have been extra special had they had interviews from German combat survivors.

It breaks your heart to see combat vets who are 80+ still weep about lost friends.  War is hell, that's for sure.",1293062400,6,650,4.4491525423728815
3730525,5,B001OLP2T8,"Again was so impressed by a recent visit to Normandy, France that I also ordered a 5 disc series by the History Channel.  Lots of commentaries by the veterans (both Germany and the Allies) and actual footage from both sides.  Very moving and informative not a movie like the ""Longest Day"". PS I liked the Longest Day.  Our youngters have not seen the history of D-Day.  One of my friends said ""If there were modern coverage of this war and day the mothers would never have sent their sons to this war."" I'm in my sixties and knew alot from my dad and school. It's not like Viet Nam or Iraq since there was no CNN, FOX, MSNBC, etc.  A great and informative documentry on D-Day WWII our kids should see it.",1288742400,,704,4.303030303030303
3730526,4,B001OLP2T8,"Patton may be the selling point of this dvd set, it's actually just as much about the units he commanded as about the general himself.  To cover the campaigns it uses stock footage, computer animation,(there probably isn't any footage of some of the French and Itallian afvs), reenactments, strategic maps with colored arrows, interviews of surviving veterans, and talking head historians. Of the later, they are of mixed value, the steadfast Patton enthusiasts are weak, but the author of An Army at Dawn, and The Day of Battle, Rick Atkinson, has excellent observations. Some of the veterans have some good stories, such as the guy in Sicily who tries to take out a Tiger tank by himself with a bazooka but quickly changes his mind. I enjoyed the earlier segments on North Africa and Sicily more than those on France to the end of the war.  However they are all enjoyable to those interested in the history of the men commanded by this controversial, unique, and ultimately successful general.",1280361600,,995,4.881656804733728
3730527,2,B001OLP2T8,"I just finished watching most of the first season. As a long time student of WWII, and admirer of Patton, from his days of chasing Pancho Villa through his beyond-bold leadership against the Nazis, I was excited to get this series.

I learned a few new things about the fights and the politics, without a doubt. But halfway through the first disc, I thought I was going insane. The images move so quickly, and repeat themselves over and over, the same photos, the same clips, the same utterly ridiculous computer-generated bombs and tanks and gunfire. The show is like some kind of test you'd get in a psychiatrist's office to test your threshold of mental abuse.

I wish somebody had grabbed the director or the editor and screamed, right in their face, ""Nobody has an attention span this short!!!!! Nobody!!! The person who needs this much visual and auditory stimulation would be in a COMA!!!!""

And if the stimulation was in the least bit necessary, if it were truly creative, maybe, just maybe, I could take it. But I repeat, just like the film: it is the SAME images over and over and over.

I'm not a geezer. I like modern film, modern documentaries. But there were so many places in this film where I wanted to stop it so I could see what was happening- the combat footage, the footage of the towns, the tanks, the fighters, the POWs, the people of the towns and camps. The whole project is poisoned by how good it could be if it just slowed down enough for the viewer to occupy an image, to record the image in their mind, absorb it. Patton 360 is much like those old films of the 70's that tried to mimic the effects of LSD and wound up just making the viewer nauseous.

3730529,4,B001OLP2T8,An interesting depiction of the WWII career of one of the most colorful generals in war.  The way the information is presented is very clear and the CGI battles provides a clear explanation of what happened.  The description and graphic presentations of the equipment used also fills voids that are often missing in written and pictorial reports of battles.  Great!,1278028800,,365,5.05

I don't know why it's called the complete season one...it's the Complete SERIES. It's ends with the death of Patton.
Extremely well made. They used archival footage and tossed in some very good computer graphics to fill in gaps and brought back many of the actual men who served under Patton for new interviews as the events unfolded. Very well done and presented. I must say too, enjoy this and this type of series while we still can. Those brave men who served in WW2 are now in their late 80's to 90's, 10 years from now, this series will be impossible to make as there sadly won't be any survivors left.
If you are a war buff, a patriot, a historian or just want to watch some GOOD....get this DVD set. This is a Strong 5 star rating.",1277510400,,810,4.3355263157894735
