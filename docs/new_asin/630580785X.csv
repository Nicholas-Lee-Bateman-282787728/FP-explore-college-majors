1080016,4,630580785X,"This is the first and best of the four ""Ilsa"" films featuring the sensational Dyanne Thorne, who plays the sadistic head doctor in a Nazi death-camp that specializes in cruel experiments on nude women. Sounds too  tasteless to be bearable? Well, actually no. If you can retain your sense  of humour, you can find this film thoroughly enjoyable. It's mainly down to  the hilarious camp acting of Thorn in the title role, whether she is  strutting around the camp, spitting insults in a thick hammy accent at all  the inmates, or seducing male prisoners in her boudoir using her famous  chest to maximum effect. Still, the various scenes of torture are  surprisingly convincing, and very realistic, especially those carried out  by Ilsa in her secret torture chamber on a prize female subject, so this is  definitely not a film for the squeamish. Theres even room for suspense  during the climax when Ilsa's cruel reign is finally overturned. Overall,  an enjoyable romp for people who have seen everything the mainstream has to  offer. But due to such scenes as fingernail pulling, torture by electrified  dildo and castration, prepare your friends before you show it to any of  them!",957312000,27,1183,4.939086294416244

1080177,4,630580785X,"This classic Nazi exploitation film takes place entirely at a concentration camp where Dyanne Thorne and her fellow Nazi's conduct assorted torturous experiments, and Thorne occasionally seduces the male inmates to find that special somebody that can satisfy her. The film has plenty of full nudity, although Thorne doesn't have any full frontal scenes. The gruesome torture sequences aren't for the squeamish, and the film doesn't deliver much effective atmosphere. Although it does get decently suspenseful in some parts, and the directing is good. The main reason to see it is for the gore, as well as the assorted sex and nude scenes. It moves at a good pace and is easy to follow.

I made a mistake and bought the Netherland DVD version of this years ago instead of the Anchor Bay DVD. This DVD has a sharp and clear picture, and the brightness is fine. However, it has some problems with contrast and color; the colors are somewhat faded, and the contrast needs improvement. Overall, I still thought the quality was good. You get a decent photo gallery for an extra, but it doesn't have any interviews or commentaries.",1387756800,2,1124,4.884816753926701

The main enjoyment is critiquing the film as you watch it.  The commentary can be more fun than the film.

This movie and Ilsa the Wicked Warden are the best two of the four Ilsa movies.  The others really suffer from a lack of direction in the story telling and sex.

The torture is very mundane by today's standards, there is much harder and actually real sexual violence on the net that is easy to find.  But again, if the 70's sexploitation is your thing this is a great movie.

But I was not expecting the depths to which this movie sank. I was horrifed, revolted, sickened, and fascinated all at the same time. This is extreme gore. There is a level of torture I have only seen on one other vile film. This is a prison film/gore fest combination film. I like bad movies. I like bad sexpoitation movies. This one set out to take torture and violence to a new low, and it does. Be warned. This is not for those with squeamish stomachs. I think it would appeal to certain fetishists. I gave it four stars for it's no holds barred sadism, the likes of which is rare in a film. This crosses the line to a new level of indecency.",1350864000,,981,4.114583333333333

If you've never seen this classic, then you owe it to yourself to do so right now! I never imagined that WW2 could be so mindlessly entertaining. From the ultra-cheeezy production values to the hilariously leaden ""acting"" and dialogue, this schlocker is in the upper strata of super-bilge, soft-core cinema!

1080248,4,630580785X,"I've seen all of the Ilsa films and the 'unofficial' sequel, ""Wanda, The Wicked Warden"" directed by the notorious Jess Franco. Believe me when I say that Franco's film is far more offensive in it's own way than the three 'genuine' Ilsa films. Instead of harassing Ms. Thorne, who I think, given her real personality, was quite amazing in this role even if the visuals were gross.
What many seem to forget is that this film came out at a time when film makers were pushing the edge of the envelope in terms of nudity, violence, etc. Just because this was a low budget affair done strictly for the drive-in/grindhouse crowds, to me no matter what the film, violence is violence and nudity/sex are nudity/sex. There was films like ""Midnight Cowboy"" that got an 'X' rating, just as ""A Clockwork Orange"" did as well.
I'm *not* saying these films are in the same category of quality, what I am saying is that all of these films were found by many to be offensive in their own way. Let's not forget the outrage that happened when ""The Exorcist"" was released and a few years later there was the hideous Penthouse production of ""Caligula"".
As for the most disgusting or violent film made, to me it would have to be the Japanese film ""Guinea Pig"" where it is simply 90 minutes of 2 men torturing a young women in the some of the most hideous ways possible. If you can watch that film without freaking out about the level of violence, well your stomach is stronger than mine. ""Guinea Pig"" was the film Charlie Sheen saw at a party and thought it was a real 'snuff' film and took it to the FBI, only to have them laugh in his face, because they knew about it already.
A little side note, David Friedman changed his name on the credits because he knew that his Jewish family and friends would want to do a lot more to him than just a circumcision!!",1278028800,,1835,4.415929203539823
1080249,3,630580785X,"""Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS.""  The film itself I would give 5 stars; for what it is, it is the best of it's kind!  The combination of Nazism and extreme torture, turned into a sex film, makes for an explosive mix.  Dyanne Thorne gives an INSANELY evil and sexy performance, as the power & sex hungry SS commandant, Ilsa, aka Fraulein Doktor.  My complaint is with this specific dvd edition.  Do not be fooled; while the package claims to be a widescreen, restored version, it is actually a full-screen picture, with quality not much better than the old VHS!  This film has a very special look to it, and needs to be presented in it's original aspect ratio to realise that ""Ilsa: She Wolf"" is actually a well-made film.  This dvd edition has poor sound quality as well. Not to mention, there are no extras, aside from an old trailer, that has a picture quality of a 5th generation bootleg.  My advice to fans of this special film; spend the extra money and get the Anchor Bay edition.  The picture and sound is magnificent.",1271376000,2,1020,4.47027027027027
1080250,4,630580785X,"Saw this movie thirty years ago and couldn't remember the title, but remembered the plotline.  It was just as campy as I remembered!!  Brought back memories of those college years and the old drive-in movie theatres.",1260921600,2,216,4.972222222222222
1080251,1,630580785X,"I did not like this movie at all. Ms. Thornne is wonderfully endowed, and for me thats always a plus, but what I detested about this movie was the mixture of T&A, gore and torture. The gore and torture is probably the reason most seek this one out, unfortunately. For me, it was a waste of some beautiful eye candy as the bloody scenes detracted from the fun of the campy acting and gorgeous female subjects. That's just me though, I'm sure some of you sickos out there will love it.

This is a cult classic which usually comes highly touted as required viewing for fans of such. Well, now I've seen it, once, and have traded it in.

1080308,3,630580785X,"This one is a bit of a classic.  It's about SS medical experimentation and mixes in a bit of soft-core porn.  But the mix along with the gruesome nature of many of the scenes (torture, mutilation), make for an unsettling experience.  Should you find it necessary to investigate this angle of Nazism, it's better to read a book.  The point of the movie is, sex and the SS don't go well together.  It's an artistic statement to be sure, but not for the faint of heart.

Two aspects of this move that are historically inaccurate:  first, many of the medical procedures depicted did not take place in reality.  Be relieved.  Second, the SS was into traditional German culture, that which is known as ""volkisch"".  They had a repressed attitude about sex.  The character Ilsa, with her mix of extreme sadism (really) and sexiness, could not have existed in the SS.  This is a work of fiction, and it should be viewed as such.",1216339200,3,919,4.570552147239264
1080309,3,630580785X,"""Ilsa - She Wolf of the SS"" is a hard film to classify.
Is it 70's soft core porn?
Well, it does have the requisite nudity and simulated sex.
Is it an S&M/horror grindhouse flick?
Again, it has appalling scenes of torture and sado-masochistic action.
Is it a Nazi exploitation film?
Hey - it's ""She Wolf of the SS"" remember? So naturally there are plenty of Nazis running around, mostly busty Arayan females.
The production values are low (they used the abandoned ""Hogan's Heroes"" set), the script is mediocre and the acting is generally atrocious.
Nevertheless, viewing ""Ilsa"" is a disturbing experience, to say the least.",1215388800,2,623,4.886792452830188

On top of all that Ilsa is on a search for a man that can satisfy her....sexually!! Ilsa is HOT!!! It doesnt get any better than this!!!

1080311,4,630580785X,"The first sight of Ilsa, as the German Nazi camp commandant,

strutting in jack-boots and brandishing her swagger stick as she eyeballs her male and female prisoners is quite stunning.

If you are a fan of campy, 70's style movies with aggresive and dominant

female leads, then this is a movie for you!

Loosely based on history, (I don't believe there was ever a NAZI woman commander of a coed prisoner of war camp during WW2--at least not as alluring as she),

this is an evidently ridiculous, but unique, interesting, exciting and aroussing film.

Definately over the top for moral values of 1974, today it comes across as comical and satirical in its overt splendour of sexplotation.

Yes, there are scenes of torture, however the blood and gore is so unreal that is allows

the viewer to watch in curiousity, not revulsion.  For a man, the scene of castration and Ilsa cutting off a man's

genitals, who failed to please her sexually, generates a queasy feeling though!

Overall, a film to have for 'supers-schlok cinema' value and one to watch when you

need a fix for a very attractive, dominant female as an antagonist against your senses of complacency!

The fact that it is filmed on the then vintage set of the 1960's series Hogan's Heroes,

gives it that mystifying allure, harkening back to the old war themes of good against

evil:

And, Dyanne Thorne as the character Ilsa, is pure evil--but she's purely 'one hell of a good' sight for

sore eyes!",1163030400,4,1463,4.719367588932807
1080312,3,630580785X,"Granted, I wasn't expecting much when I saw this but it does have a certain charm. It's not historically accurate, a few of the actors and the producer had their names changed, most of the female cast spends a majority of the time undressed and it looks like it was shot between takes of Hogan's Heroes.

Dyanne Thorne as Ilsa gives the only enthusiastic performance and manages to stay in character thoughout, reminding me of Jeffrey Combs' performance in Re-Animator. She was about 42 when she did this and looked great. The rest of the cast just stands there and tries not to look stupid, although Uschi Digard does make a spectacular uncredited cameo appearance dying in a pressure chamber.

Supposedly Ilsa sparked some controversy when it was released in 1974, but it seems doubtful since it only played in grindhouses and drive-ins. It did lucrative business spawning a few inferior sequals that were much tamer. An exploitation ""classic"" that really does get better after consuming several beers.",1156377600,3,1004,4.970238095238095
1080313,5,630580785X,"I think too many people gave this movie a serious review, I mean come on, its ILSA, SHE WOLF OF THE SS. The title just smacks of tastelessness. A softcore porn/exploitation film set in a Nazi camp, lets meet our heroes: There is of course the She Wolf, Ilsa who when not torturing various women and castrating male prisoners that fail to satisfy her, struts around in her stylin nazi boots barking with a fake German accent. She predictably falls for this American (Wolfe) because he can hold off orgasm indefinitely and has blond hair. Then there is Anna, a rebellious brunette who refuses to have her spirit broken by Ilsa. Ilsa spends a  lot of time torturing Anna and screwing the American. When not having sex with Ilsa Wolfe is plotting the escape of the prisoners with Mario who is this Italian guy that seems like he was teleported in from a grade B romance film. Mario wears the same stoic expression throughout the movie, even as he dies at the end.

There are other characters than this, I just don't care about them.

I appreciate some of the loving details in this movie, like the fake blood that looks like red paint, random shots that have a picture of Hitler in the background and of course the music. When it doesn't sound like a high school band did the soundtrack they pasted in bits of real German music including little kids singing at the end. Oh and lets not forget the death/torture scenes, some are quite inventive thought not as inventive as say...Cube Zero! Though she is over forty the busty Ilsa manages to exude a kind of sadistic sexiness which makes the character even funnier. Somehow this movie wasn't that bad to me, I mean bad taste yes, low budget yes, but it is a good film for what it is. (whatever that may be) On one Listmania this movie was under ""TRASH: You will learn to eat garbage like a dog and poop shiny lumps of gold"" If you are stupid enough to drop acid while watching this you might do just that.

I spent most of my time watching it laughing like a hyena and eating hamburger helper.  Shame on you some would say, for laughing at nazi war crimes! my answer to that would be why cant we treat a subject as serious as this with humor (albeit tasteless) without it I think we would give the nazis more dignity than they deserve.",1142812800,10,2279,4.429594272076372

The sex has been better in other movies. And the torture, it fell sort too. I think the film relied on too much shock value instead of realism for the torture.

You got to give the director credit. They were making a explotation film and that is what he gave the viewers. Why else would you have half naked women whipping prisoners.

I gave this 3 stars instead of 2 because of the time they made this film, it was up to expectations of the 70's. Then again, there was a lot of funny tabbacco being smoked back then too.",1132272000,3,740,4.197183098591549
1080315,4,630580785X,"Ilsa's a movie that you kinda feel guilty enjoying(a guilty pleasure if I ever saw one).  I mean, it's in such extremely bad taste to take the atrocities of the third reich and make it into a sleazy sex and violence flick.  So, yeah I feel kinda bad that I like this film.  It's kinda like laughing at a racist joke when you're not racist.  Ilsa's plotless plot is pretty much Ilsa running a smaller scale Auschwitz that caters to torturing women and sleeping with/castrating men.  A new male arrival at the camp turns out to be just the superman Ilsa's been looking for and she gets taken with him as everyone else plans their Great Escape.  That's the plot. The running time is padded with numerous torture and softcore sex scenes, sometimes a mix of the two.  I didn't know that female SS officers whipped people while topless.  I might have to get thrown into a camp like Ilsa's.  Dyanne Thorne is not the most beautiful woman in the world, but she pushes the sexy needle right into the red.  She can be my She Wolf any day.  A real high point to this dvd is the commentary.  It's very funny.  The makers of this film(including Thorne) realize the kind of film they've made and have no problems heckling it, very funny.  They do get a little sidetracked from the action onscreen(I would have liked to hear Thorne's take on some of the scenes if you know what I mean), but do manage to cover almost everything you want to know about the making of the film.  It won't hurt to check this out if you're curious.  I wouldn't pay too much attention to one star reviews, coz anyone who knows the film's title, looks at the cover and reads the back of the box knows what to expect-And it's not Schindler's List!!  As a matter of fact I'm puzzled as to what the one star reviewers were expecting from a film called Ilsa: She Wolf Of The SS, and why they even watched it if they were already offended by the subject matter.  Oh, well, I don't claim to know it all.  I do know, however, that you should check out Ilsa just to say you saw it.",1098576000,12,2034,4.3052631578947365

1080317,4,630580785X,"""Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS"" is perhaps one of the better known exploitation films made in the last thirty years. The picture, directed by Don Edmonds and starring Dyanne Thorne in the titular role, is also one of the most disturbing. Oddly enough, I found this movie even more sickening the second time around. The first time I watched Ilsa do her stuff was on an old VHS tape about five years ago, and I didn't think the film was as horrific as many viewers made it out to be. Usually, the disgust factor works the other way around: the first viewing is the worst with the shock value wearing away on subsequent viewings. I should probably question the value of even watching ""Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS"" more than once, but I wanted to see what the picture looked like with a snappy new transfer to DVD. Moreover, I wanted to listen to the commentary track with Edmonds, Thorne, and producer David Friedman of ""Blood Feast"" fame (billed here as Herman Traeger). I wasn't disappointed; the picture quality of ""Ilsa"" is stunning for such a low budget piece of trash. The commentary track too makes this disc a must have for lovers of schlock cinema. Just don't pop this one in the DVD player when the relatives show up or as a substitute for taking your gal out on the town.
Set in the waning days of the Second World War, ""Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS"" takes place in a special medical camp where the brutal camp commander Ilsa (Dyanne Thorne) and her busty minions wreak havoc on a bevy of female prisoners. There are a few guys around too, mostly to act as boy toys for Ilsa's ravenous appetites. Ilsa's supposed to be conducting experiments on helpless prisoners that will benefit the German military effort, but she's got quite the disturbing side project going on as well. According to the She-Wolf, women possess certain biological characteristics that make them more resistant to pain then men. You can almost guess what happens next. Ilsa sets aside a hidden little laboratory in the basement of her office to test out her personal theories while the approved experiments take place in another building. Both sets of trials are excruciating to watch. The Germans test the effects of high pressure, boiling temperatures, and diseases on the female inmates of the prison. Down in the basement, Ilsa and her two blonde goons strip down to the waist in order to administer severe beatings to selected troublemakers. There's a lot more I could detail, but believe it or not these are the least offensive scenes in the movie. ""Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS"" is sick, sick stuff.
A sort of hope fills the prisoners' hearts when Wolfe (George Knoph) enters the camp. The new inmate has a ""special ability"" that allows him to find a way into the frosty heart of the buxom camp commander. Behind the scenes, the prisoners plot to escape from the prison any way they can. It won't be easy, not when one faces Ilsa, her she-wolfettes, her male assistant, a pack of sadistic guards, and machine gun towers. In the meantime, the degradations continue unabated. Ilsa whips up a few special treats for a visiting general (Wolfgang Roehm) that truly turn the stomach as Wolfe, Mario (Tony Mumolo), and Kala (Nicolle Riddell) carefully map out there plan. Will the prisoners escape? Will Ilsa and her handmaidens receive their just desserts? Will the Allies arrive at the camp before everyone perishes at the hands of the Germans? Will tough chick Anna (Maria Marx) withstand Ilsa's experiments and thus prove the commander's theory? Will you be able to keep your lunch down during the hour and a half it takes to watch the movie? These questions, and many others, will find resolution by the time the final credits roll.
What won't find resolution is your utter disgust with the film. A gallon of mouthwash won't remove the bad taste this movie leaves behind in your mouth. I found myself inadvertently comparing Edmond's picture with ""Schindler's List,"" another film dealing with German atrocities during the Second World War. Truth be told, ""List"" is much more harrowing in its depictions of the concentration camps and the horrible living conditions of those people enslaved by the Germans. What sets ""Ilsa"" apart, what makes it even worse than ""Schindler's List,"" is that it's all done for cheap, value neutral kicks. Why else play up endless scenes of nudity in a movie about war crimes? Despite Thorne's amazingly campy performance, ""Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS"" is a ghastly film that should repulse more than it exhilarates. Even more disturbing is the admission on the commentary track that the movie sets come from the television show ""Hogan's Heroes."" You won't see LeBeau, Carter, Sergeant Schultz, or Colonel Klink in this movie! If you find anything remotely exhilarating about this picture, you've been falling behind on your electroshock therapy treatments again.
Dyanne Thorne does pull off her role with ease, coming across as a heartless, cold monster without an ounce of remorse in her bones. It's quite the contrast to listen to the commentary track and realize the actress seems like an intelligent, sunny personality with a good sense of humor. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your view), the commentary track, a trailer, and a few biographies are the only extras on the disc. If you feel up to it, after you watch Ilsa ham it up as a German camp commander, you can watch her in three other films reprising the character-with slight modifications-in the Middle East and in Siberia.

The camp has it's share of inmates both male and female. The men have two functions, manual labor and sexually gratifying Ilsa. Of course if you fail to satisfy Ilsa, you will never again be with another woman as she and her two hot blond nurses turn you into a `half-man' with a snip of the steel. Women serve another purpose, medical experiments. Ilsa is a doctor of sorts trying to prove to the Third Reich Command that women are superior to men. They can withstand more pain which makes them more saveage killers.
Among the prisoners are two freaks, one male, one female. The male is an American (of all things) who was studying in Germany's University when the war began. He can control his body until Ilsa (and all her nurses) are satisfied. Because of this his manhood is spared and he becomes a nightly visitor to Ilsa's private quarters.
The woman can withstand any pain the Nazi's can dream up. And they can come up with some very perverted, painful, and unusual techniques, most of them involving private and sensitive areas.
Yes you can plainly see that this was filmed on the location of Hogan's Heros. Also look for the lesbian guard who likes to hang out with the soldiers and guards. She is popular among the guards by providing female prisoners. Then there is the fat male doctor who seems to have TB or something.
Well as always, the prisoners revolt and a decent gunfight ensues. It escalates until the regular German army comes in and blows the place to hell. All the Nazi's are killed, and poor Ilsa ends up tied naked to a bed and has her head blown off by a Nazi officer. That is so that the coming Americans will never know what happened.
Good points:
Ilsa is HOT, this chick has a killer bod and huge boobs. She even turns on her commanding officer who orders her to pee on him.
Ilsa's nurses are both blond and beautiful. Watch them whip two prisoners while they are topless. They beat their prisoners until they can't lift their arms.
The female prisoners are a hit or miss. Some are hot, some are cute, some are butt ugly.

1080371,4,630580785X,"The exploitation film using Nazi Germany as a framework had its roots in The Night Porter, Love Camp 7, and then Salon Kitty, but Ilsa, She Wolf Of The SS, topped them all in sheer blood and brutality.  So when producer Herman Traeger's onscreen message that the events of the movie were based on fact, the medical experiments in camps--(q.v. William L. Shirer's The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich) is concluded with ""We dedicate this film with the hope that these horrors will never happen again"", I have to raise an eyebrow of skepticism.  With the new film rating system six years old at the time this film was released, what's the purpose of this movie if not to show scenes of naked women being tortured in the most horrific way?
When Ilsa, the powerful, well-built, towering blonde commandant of Medical Camp 9, tells the women prisoners, that this isn't Dachau or the notorious women's prison Ravensbruck, well, that's true enough, but the following belies the pseudo-science the Nazis conducted on millions of prisoners.  ""Your stay will be short but you will be a help to the Reich.  That is your destiny.""  Ilsa is hard-pressed to prove her theory that women can withstand pain by torture more than men.  One of the prisoners, a woman named Anna, becomes her selection.  Her gradual deterioration is directly proportionate to Ilsa's obsessiveness.
Of the prisoners, the men are workers, the women are patients, of which a few are sent to the brothel to service the soldiers.  As for the rest, they are subjected to medical experiments, such as Kala, whose face is horrible to watch.
One of the newly arriving workers, Wolfe, a blond American, may be the commandant's Achilles heel, as he is able to satisfy the insatiable Ilsa, who has castrated previous others who haven't, including Mario, a prisoner Wolfe befriends who kind of resembles Dustin Hoffman.  Together, they team up with the girls to break out of the camp at the right moment, as Wolfe is expecting the Allies to close in anytime soon.
As stated in the intro, many of the people were composites of actual people.  Ilsa, for instance, was partially based on Frau Ilse Koch, the wife of the commandant of Buchenwald, in terms of name (Ilse/Ilsa) and her having absolute power of life and death over everyone.  There's also a lot of Dr. Sigmund Rascher at Dachau, where he conducted decompression chamber experiments as seen at one point in the movie.  BTW, the victim in there is unbilled but is played by Uschi Digard, who made many underground exploitation flicks in the 1960's.
And this rivals Dead Alive and Terror Firmer in sheer bloodiness, the difference being the brutality and torture.  Many of the experiments are shown and are pretty gruesome to watch, so please don't eat anything before you watch this.  The plenitude of full nudity is tame compared to what goes on.  Ilsa is pretty callous too.  When asked why she doesn't use anesthesia on a victim, she says, ""Does one give caviar to guinea pigs?""
This was the first of four Ilsa films, the other ones being The Wicked Warden, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks, and Tigress of Siberia, of which Dyanne Thorne played all four Ilsas.  This pretty much fits the definition of what the British call a video nasty.",1059436800,12,3247,4.759358288770054

(Canada - 1974)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Ilsa, the sadistic female commandant of a Nazi concentration camp, conducts hideous medical experiments on her female inmates and is 'serviced' nightly by a studly male prisoner who is secretly plotting rebellion against her monstrous regime.

Produced in the wake of successful women-in-prison thrillers such as THE BIG DOLL HOUSE (1971) and the notorious LOVE CAMP 7 (1968), Don Edmonds' ILSA: SHE WOLF OF THE SS preceded a wave of Nazi exploitation titles that flooded the grindhouse circuit during the 1970's, particularly in Europe. Aiming to outdo his competitors in terms of sex and horror, 'Ilsa' was conceived by legendary producer David Friedman (SEVEN INTO SNOWY, THE RAMRODDERS, etc.) as a combination of softcore sleaze and hardcore violence, photographed on standing sets from the recently-cancelled TV series ""Hogan's Heroes"". Ilsa herself is played with unrestrained gusto by the wonderful (and wonderfully endowed!) Dyanne Thorne, a statuesque beauty who uses her voluptuous charms to seduce and destroy her helpless victims, in a manner both Sadean and erotic.

But the movie's sexual candor is offset by a series of tortures and medical experiments - courtesy of Joe Blasco's revolting makeup effects - which are rooted in appalling historical fact: For instance, the wound in a young girls' leg is deliberately infected with gangrene, and another unfortunate victim is forced to stand naked on a quick-melting block of ice with a noose tightening around her throat while SS officers dine in front of her. Episodes like these are exploitative and cruel, but no less cruel than the horrors perpetrated by real-life Nazi criminals, which makes ILSA: SHE WOLF OF THE SS one of the few films to reject the sanitized portrayal of wartime horror (cf. SCHINDLER'S LIST, et al) and actually depict the unthinkable. Reckless bravado or depraved opportunism? You be the judge...

Edmonds was clearly unable to get all the coverage he needed to tighten long-winded dialogue sequences (some scenes drag as a consequence), but while the production values are sparse, the film is designed and photographed with consummate skill, and the climactic showdown between Ilsa and her former inmates closes proceedings on a note of genuine horror. You have been warned!

Followed by ILSA: HAREM-KEEPER OF THE OIL SHEIKS (1975).

NB. Friedman fell out with the film's Canadian backers during post-production and is therefore billed on-screen as 'Herman Traeger'.",1048032000,9,2551,5.312655086848635
1080373,2,630580785X,"ILSA SHE-WOLF OF THE SS is a terrible movie. Now having said that, one who notes this is faced with the dilemma of where to go next. Low quality, low budget films that are judged deficient in worth must then have their deficiencies seen as either done on purpose to achieve a desired effect however wretched that effect may be or accomplished as a byproduct whose only discernible point is to cause the viewer to feel the pain of wasted time rather than the pain of any of the characters. In the case of ILSA, I reluctantly see the dramatic impact as having a valid point, even if in so doing, I feel a weird sense of perversion mixed with fascination.
Ilsa is the commandant of a Nazi concentration camp whose female inmates seem to be made up of assorted busty models and starlets. The guards and Ilsa herself are decked out in fashionably black uniforms that cling to their well-shaped forms. The ostensible plot revolves around Ilsa'a theory that women, when properly trained, can endure pain far more effectively than men. To accomplish this, of course, director Don Edmunds, finds it necessary to show full frontal female nudity in every other scene. To those male viewers who equate nudity with desire, ILSA is a shocking revelation. Despite the abundance of exposed female flesh, the more prevalent emotion aroused is one of a disagreeable mixture of disgust, consternation, and grotesquerie. Dyanne Thorne, who plays Ilsa, is a woman driven by nearly every negative emotion--both sexual and non-sexual--that one can imagine. She is a psychiatrist's worst nightmare: sado-masochism, misogyny, lesbianism, megalomania, nymphomania, just to name the most obvious. To Ilsa, sex is never a goal; it is only a means to a painful end. Women and men are routinely tortured in graphic closeup. Her superior officer is an SS general who comes across as a mindless laughing hyeana, who demands of Ilsa to straddle him in a way that the viewer, even if not Ilsa, finds a bit too much. What then to make of a film that comes across as the pornographic flip side of HOGAN'S HEROS? Ilsa's Stalag is unfortunately seen as more nearly representative of the moral vacuum of a Nazi death camp that HOGAN'S HEROS tried comically to portray. If one could laugh at Colonel Klink or Sergeant Schultz without getting at the true horror that lay behind the laughter, then one could also try with an equal lack of success to get aroused at the nudity that lay on the operating table of Ilsa's mad doctors. The closing scenes of murder and mayhem, surprisingly enough leave the realm of sex to wind up in a more traditional war ending of soldiers and desperate inmates blasting away at one another. The continuous barrage of raunch that is nearly all of ILSA is ultimately seen as simply one subset of the insanity that we now call the Holocaust.

I actually had a nightmare after watching it.  I'm no prude, and I don't condemn anyone who does like this film.

This film practically ruined everyone associated with it and it's not hard to see why. It's all a bit too hokey to be frightening or realistic and beyond the lack of plot its really very boring.

1080378,5,630580785X,"This film takes place in a Nazi concentration camp dedicated to pseudo medical experimentation on its prisoners. Ilsa, the commandant is portrayed in ruthless fashion by the stunning Dyanne Thorne. The protuberant image of Thorne is strikingly juxtaposed between her stunning blonde hair and the black Nazi uniform and regalia that adorn her person. Thorne designs and carries out the most excruciatingly painful and torturous experiments on her helpless victims for the sheer whimsy of impressing Nazi ideology and the gratification of her own views on the endurance of the female of the species. The buxom beauty and haughtiness of the barbarous Thorne perversely fixates the viewer as she doles out tortures in nonchalant and indifferent fashion. Thorne is the essence of cruelty for cruelty's sake. Thorne is the screen's incarnation of pure evil. I can think of no other film that is as disturbing as this one. The explicit sadism portrayed in this film may or may not have actually occurred as depicted. But unthinkable sadism, torture, cruelty and debauchery did actually occur in Nazi camps. The power of this film is that it shocks the viewer. It puts the viewer in the place of the helpless victim. And the viewer does feel helpless. The viewer gets the idea of what it may have been like to be subjugated twenty-four a day to unspeakable fears and horrors. What form of corporal suffering and humiliation for the mere amusement and pleasure of these Nazi captors is next? This is an unbelievably difficult film to watch because the brutality depicted is extremely graphic.

There are so many movies that claim to shock, upset, or disturb the viewers, when actually all they do is bore, frustrate, and annoy.  There are many films I can recall seeing that had a lot of hype to them, just to let me down when I watched them.  The camera would always pan away from the good scenes or the film would just jump to another part, mostly implying what they should be showing!  I love my country, but the censorship here is rediculous.  Sorry, just venting.  Anyway, I recieved my copy of Ilsa-She Wolf Of The SS and was prepaired to once again be let down.

There is graphic violence, Torture, humiliation, rape, whippings, burnings, shockings, sex, and tons of nudity.  Not to mention Mrs. Thorne(as Ilsa) is one hot lady, as well as a great villaness.  Oh, what is the movie about?  Well, mostly it's about a nazi medical camp where woman are brought in for gruesome experiments.  Ilsa runs the camp and want's to prove to the general that woman can handle pain better than men.  So thats where the torture and such comes into play.  Also Ilsa has a lustful appetite for both men and women.  The only downfall of being with this busty beauty is that if you don't satisfy her evey sexual desire to her liking, than you get it cut off.(get my drift?)  Yes Ilsa is one of the most brutally awsome movies I had ever seen and I recommend it to any experianced fan of the genre. Novice's might want to start out with something a little less graphic as Ilsa will indeed disturb, upset, and shock some.  I wouldn't throw this movie in on date night either or you'll probably have her running for the door.  In fact, make sure there are no ladies around and especially children when you watch this movie.  This is good for a friday night with some buddies and a case of beer.  Just one more thing.

There is some funny overacting, it has an interesting history (e.g. being filmed on the Hogan's Heroes set), the villians are absolutely nuts, etc., and it manages to treat the victims sympathetically enough to avoid completely offending, but I found watching it quite tedious. The story is about a camp run by a sadistic medical experimenter who tortures women (in an attempt to prove they can withstand more pain than males), and keeps a few males around to service her and do heavier labour.  Much of the film is taken up by a rather minimal and relatively boring plot about the inmates planning an escape (i.e., standing around and not really doing anything other than reminding the audience that they don't like living in a medical experimentation camp) occassionally interrupted by somewhat gory but tedious torture scenes and a couple of silly love scenes. This is all topped off at the end by (FINALLY) a silly escape scene in which, e.g., soldiers fall down dead after supposedly being shot, despite the fact they don't have any bullet wounds.  It does have a nicely ironic ending, but it is not worth sitting through the movie for.
Basically, its explicitness is all that separates this film from schlocky TV movies (many of which, like the Winds of War II with its full frontal nudity gas shower scene, have also cashed in on the tragedies of WWII, but to greater critical acclaim). The few, usually brief, gore scenes are in more detail than is necessary to advance the plot (well, I guess that's why it's an ""exploitation"" film), but then again the gore isn't as bad as the movie's rep suggests, so if that's what you're looking for you'll be dissappointed. And I don't want to meet anyone looking to be titillated by the torture scenes, but I'll bet they'll be dissappointed as well.

It leaves one to wonder if the bad breast implants that Thorne and several of the other actresses were sporting were the experiments that they were trying to perfect, but I digress. Just the thought of using the holocaust as a vehicle for a sexploitation story is enough to turn most people off, but in truth the events in ""Ilsa"" are far removed from the realities of WWII era Germany. The filmakers went a long way in making that distinction.
If you're completely jaded, such as myself, and think that nothing is too sacred to make fun of then you'll probably find a lot of entertainment in ""Ilsa"". There's enough camp in it (intentional and not so) to offset the horrors onscreen. Ultimately, this is a perfect film for guys night, but if you're the slightest bit squeamish rent a ""women in prison"" movie instead.",997056000,,1307,4.762114537444934

1080524,5,630580785X,"This 1974 sexploitation film has everything, and i mean everything. From a sadistic Nazi camp commandant (Ilsa, played by Dyann Thorne) to buxom SS guards to the brutal ( and I mean brutal) torture of female prisoners, there is little left to the imagination.
The plot is fairly simple: Ilsa is the evil, sadistic Nazi doctor (sort of a female Mengele) in charge of a medical camp in which she performs amazingly brutal and bloody experiments. This is not for the squeamish. Blood flows and prisoners scream and die.
In addition to the gore, there is a large amount of nudity and sex as ilsa enjoys having her way with male prisoners before castrating them for unsatisfactory performance. Talk about a tough grader! Nevertheless, Dyanne Thorne is gorgeous, and gives an over the top goose stepping, Heil Hitlering performance. She steals every scene she is in, whether she is [being with] a male prisoner, watching her 2 guards do the same, or torturing the female prisoners.
The film is sexy, gory, disgusting and preachy all at the same time. A damn fine combination in my book.",989625600,2,1080,4.811827956989247
1080525,5,630580785X,"Yes, you have found the infamous Ilsa movie, complete with castration for male prisoners who just can't cut the mustard and bring the camp commandant (Ilsa) to the Screaming O and ""selection"" of the most ""fit"" female prisoners. All manner of torture, degredation, humiliation and nudity are included in this film. My wife raised some hell after she saw that I had bought this 1970's exploitation classic, she was expecting another Schindlers List when I told her the movie was about a WW2 prison camp! Dyanne Thorne (Ilsa) struts around the camp in nice tight garments, riding crop in hand ready to dish out punishment for the slightest infraction, and she is good at it. Filmed on the former set of Hogan's Heros the TV show, there are no Col. Klinck or Sgt. Schultz in this movie, only nasty predators and frightened victims. Sweet innocent young girls forced to strip for inspection and punishment...and there is plenty of punishment.  The carnage and torture just keeps escalating until of course the tables are turned and Ilsa receives her richly deserved fate. Despite all the gore if you can sit and watch this without cracking up I'd be suprised, it's so disgusting that it is funny. Dyanne Thorne is real easy on the eyes and does a great job. I love all the cheesy fake German accents. Your wife might get pissed too but this film is just to good to pass by, and there is no way you'll find it at Blockbuster.

First off, I'm sure anybody who is purposely searching for the Ilsa movies has at least heard of it (and it's infamous reputation!), so you pretty much know what you're getting into. If you're looking for something incredibly sleazy, offensive, and violent you have just hit a goldmine! This is the epitome of everything one would want in a (s)exploitation film-a true defining masterpiece! I remember watching it at an after school party once, and most of the viewers are scarred for live-even the ones that liked it!

1080527,5,630580785X,"Ilsa-She Wolf of The SS is by far one of the greatest sleaze flicks I have ever seen. It is damn near perfect. This movie has everything you would want in a sleaze/horror movie: Graphic Violence (and i do mean graphic), plenty of nudity, un-intentional comedy, and some extras on the dvd to boot. If you are looking for some of the most wicked depictions of torture ever seen on film, well here ya go. This is an extremely entertaining film in many different ways.
First of all, this is a well made film. (for the budget it had) And the acting isn't too bad. The violent scenes are outrageous and extremely entertaining. The transfer was even pretty good for such an old and low budget film.
The reviewers who gave this movie bad reviews clearly are not fans of this genre of movies. Don't get me wrong...if you are not looking for plenty of violence don't buy this one, but if you are a fan of this genre, then this is a buy or die situation. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.
Inlcuding some decent commentary by Dyanne Thorne, trailers and a cast bio, this one is a keeper. Best of the series. (although the other ilsas are pretty good too, but this one's the gem)",987292800,26,1172,4.3807339449541285

In my neverending quest for extreme entertainment, however, I decided to pick up this DVD recently and what a surprise.  Play the film without commentary, and you have a well-made exploitation film that still packs as much shock value as just about any B movie I have ever seen.  The fact that all the torture and experimentation shown were actually performed by Nazi sadists like Dr. Mengele and Irma Greise makes the images in this film that much harder to forget.  Then play the film again with the commentary on, and you have one of the wittiest and most hilarious discussions on making B movies I have ever heard, thanks to director Don Edmonds, producer David Friedman, and especially star Dyanne Thorne.  The recollections of these three had me in stitches.  In sum, this DVD is a must-have for any student of cinema or admirer of B movies.",984873600,,1079,4.59375

I still like a range of films that are usually classified as  pornography, but this THING should never have even been filmed much less  brought to DVD.  Even imagining that anyone could possibly do some of the  things acted out in this film to another human being is painful; knowing it  is essentially historical fact sickens. Possibly the creators of this film  hoped it would have that effect, but I doubt it because the sequels were  equally horrid and presumably they do not even pretend to historical  accuracy.  In the 'Sheik' version, for example, they torture a woman by  having her leg eaten off by ants below the knee while she watches.  And it  looked absolutely REAL.  I see here reviewers calling these works 'erotic'  and I shudder. How they even made scenes like that I don't care, I'm caught  on why would they WANT to?  Such a concept is EROTIC?  Get HELP! As I said,  this is one set of movies I truly wish I had never seen.  I guess at the  time I was finding out there are NO limits in film- making, but with scenes  like what comes back to me as I see these names again, I wish now SOMETHING  had been in place to spare me that.

1080531,2,630580785X,"Don Edmonds' ILSA - SHE WOLF OF THE SS is quite the curiosity.  Imagine SALO directed by one of Roger Corman's less talented, like Steve Carver who did BIG BAD MAMA.  SALO could always be summed up by Burroughs' koan  ""Wouldn't you?"" and frankly SHE WOLF works in much the same way -  beyond BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, there's an eroticized charge from  the sex scenes that overrides and even permeates the really offensive gore.  Of course, Pasolini uses this in an instructional manner, while SHE WOLF  hasn't an intelligent thought in its head.  Shot on old sets of  ""Hogan's Heroes"", it's the idiot dark side of that show.
At  least part of this is due to the Herschel Gordon Lewis goofiness of the  blood baths, which are more like skits from ""Saturday Night Live""  than a Tobe Hooper picture.  In short, you can't get very upset about it.
And let us now praise Dyanne Thorne.  A kind of Sybil Danning crossed  with Carol Doda, with echoes of Elke Sommer and May Britt...  She actually studied with Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler.",965174400,,1040,4.570652173913044

The film has never looked better, clean, sharp, colorful, letterboxed and completely uncut (the full 96 minute version - previously only available on VHS from  long-gone Videatrics).  The film looks 100 times better than any of the  previous VHS versions as well.  Yes, it is a truly sick and sleazy movie  and definitely not for all tastes, but you can't deny it's well-made and  effective.  Dyanne Thorne is one incredible villainess and the many  torture scenes will satiate any jaded sleaze-horror viewer.  The DVD also  features the original theatrical trailer and has a full-length commentary  track featuring director Edmonds, producer Friedman, Dyanne Thorne and some  annoying humorist guy who moderates.

Anti-semites will find a thrill here. But there is  nothing in the least bit erotic or even less than horrifying in this film.  I saw this fifteen years ago, and the images can still unsettle me.

It's something that can show creators how far you can really go, something so few movies and entertainment in general does nowadays. This is something I wish I was able to experience in a theater, although if I did there would be a chance that some pervert is behind me masturbating so perhaps it was best I watched this in the privacy of my own home.
