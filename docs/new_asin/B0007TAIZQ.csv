8051194,5,B0007TAIZQ,"I was very impressed and very happy with the quality and content of this instructional DVD.

I am not a student of the Wild Goose lineage of Chi Kung. But I've been practicing various active and quiescent QiGong/""Chi Kung"" forms for 12 years, and I've studied with some very famous and accomplished teachers. And I've had some good success with it - no one will ever mistake me for a Taoist mystic, but I've managed to resolve some chronic health problems and wean myself off anti-depressants and Xanax with some disciplined daily practice. So I like to think that I know a little about chi kung, and can tell the real stuff from the poseurs.

This DVD definitely offers the real stuff. Master Hu's approach to Wild Goose QiGong is somewhat gentler and softer than some other teachers' practice of the Wild goose forms, and word has it from a friend who attended one of his seminars that Hu relies on standing meditation practice (Yi Chuan) to supply much of the internal power which is channeled and refined in forms like this. But there is no mistaking the man's skill and focus.

The form itself takes only a minute or so to complete. But the instructional content of the DVD is over 30 minutes. That should give an idea of the exhaustive and thorough nature of the instruction on this product. The form is broken down into sections, and each section is shown multiple times from various angles, sometimes at various speeds and with sometimes with varying emphasis on hand movements, footwork, body actions, etc. The voiceover instruction is clear and easily understandable. The camerawork is professional and clearly shows everytning. The form is shown in a variety of settings, indoor and outdoor, which adds much to the pleasure of watching the form.

As to the actual worth of the ""Soft Palms"" set, I have practiced sets with similar actions and footwork, and I can testify that a relatively simply form such as this, practiced with focus, and relaxed vitality (what the Chinese call 'sung') for 15-30 minutes, can have profound beneficial effects on energy circulation, stress reduction, mental clarity and overall wellness. So I have no doubt that this would be a worthwhile addition to any QiGong practioners reportoire.

One caveat: ""Soft Palms"" is a fairly advanced form in the Wild Goose system. While anyone can benefit from it with dedicated practice, it may be more appropriate (and less frustrating) for experienced QiGong students, and for students who are familar with more foundational work in Wild Goose.

In summary, this is a beautifully made DVD, and I am very glad to have it, especially for the relatively low price.",1124582400,21,2642,4.86
