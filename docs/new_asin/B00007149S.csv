1797456,4,B00007149S,"""An Evening with Kevin Smith"" chronicles the college Q&A tour that the director of five ""Jay and Silent Bob"" films took in 2001.  The DVD consists of 2 discs and contains almost 4 hours of vintage Smith discussing his life, his films and his comic book side career.
I enjoyed several of the stories that Kevin tells. In particular, I found his discussion about his experience in the development of the ill-fated ""Superman Reborn"" project to be very intersting.  He spends almost 30 minutes discussing how he got involved with the project (his theory on why he was asked to work on it involves the dialogue that takes place in ""Mallrats"" about Superman's ""prowess"").  He explains his meetings with movie execs, particularly Jon Peters (producer of ""Rainman), who he convincing portrays as a total goofball.  He also explains how his role in the development of the film fell apart when it was decided that Tim Burton would be the director.  Kevin leaves no doubt that there is no love lost between himself and Burton.
I also enjoyed his long (again about 30 minutes) discussion about another ill-fated experience as the director of a documentary about the artist now known as Prince.  It's a fascinating discussion of what it is like to work with a man who lives in (as described by one of Prince's assistants), ""Prince World"".  Kevin shows how he went from a giddy fan of Prince who was tickled to be asked to do the project to a non-fan who now could care less about Prince.
I do have some quibbles.  Although he told the story with good humor, I really didn't care about the minute details of his first ""romantic"" experience with is wife Jen.  I'd say about 20 minutes are dedicated to this that could have been used to descibe his thoughts on one of his movies.  I'm not a prude (I've seen and enjoyed his movies, after all), but some things are better left unsaid (or at least left off the DVD).
Obviously since these college stints were Q&A sessions, he can only answer what was asked by the crowd.  However, I would have liked to have heard discussion on what it was like to work with Linda Fiorentino on ""Dogma"", who he has said was so difficult to work with that he will never do it again.  If he could rip Prince and Jon Peters in an entertaining fashion, imagine the hatchet job he could have done on her.
I also didn't understand why it was decided to leave in questions asked by students who were obviously not coherent and just babbled without saying anything pertinent.  Again, this time could have been spent showing Kevin answer decent questions.  I did get a kick out of Kevin's attempt to try to sweet talk an employer of a student to let him get his job back (the student was fired for going to the Smith show instead of working).
Overall, pretty entertaining and a good addition for the Kevin Smith completest.",1040601600,6,2829,4.576237623762376
1797457,5,B00007149S,"This peek into the View Askewniverse and mind of Kevin Smith is one wild ride.  If you find Smith's movies funny, you'll find yourself with side pains during this.  Sure, there are few bonus features on the 2-disc set, but that's because all the bonus features were already included in the program itself.  Whatever happened to the Superman script Kevin was working on?  What's up with Magnolia Fan?  Does Kevin think he's going to go to Hell for writing Dogma?  Is Jason Mewes gay?  All these questions and more (much more) are answered in this candid look at Q&A sessions from several different colleges with the master himself.  Any Kevin Smith fan will thrill to the hilarious back stories shared about the creation of the five movies that have reshaped modern cinema.  Also, be sure to watch the fun Kevin has with people who leave the Main Menu on for a prolonged period of time.  It's nearly four hours of the best look into an artist's mind since Stephen King wrote ""On Writing.""  Kevin, if you see this, thanks for the fun and for five of the best movies I've ever seen.

1797461,4,B00007149S,"Each disc contains 2 hours (4 hours total) of straight Q&A between the students and Kevin.  Kevin ""whity satirical dialog"" often leads into hilarious stories of his personal and professional experiences.  His stories about Prince, Superman reborn, meeting his wife, meeting Jay for the first time, PTA, protesting Dogma, and Jay's porn career are classics.  The editing did a good job of cutting out many of the questions that have been answered in Kevin's many interviews.  Parts of these stories have been heard before but here they are presented with much more depth and detail.
The lack of dvd extras was a let down.  And only 1 Easter egg found so far.  Unlike Kevin's movies this disc may not lead repeat viewing for most viewers.
This DVD is a must for Kevin Smith fans.",1039046400,12,777,4.7611940298507465
1797462,5,B00007149S,"Kevin Smith has done it again.  He has released another ""can't miss"" release.  In ""An Evening with Kevin Smith"", Kevin, aka Silent Bob of Jay and Silent Bob fame, delivers a performance of the best moments from five question and answer sessions on a college tour he did.  The DVD is cut very cleanly, and at times you can't even tell it is in different venues.  During the 3 hour, yes, 3 hour DVD, Kevin addresses subjects such as where the character of Jay came from, how he succeeded when so many people said he would fail, his collaboration with Prince on a never seen documentary, and even on his first sexual experience with his then girlfriend, now wife, Jennifer.  This DVD set is definitely worth the purchase to any follower of Kevin Smith, or to anyone who wants to get into the psyche of one of the most original, and often controversial, Writer/Director/Producer of the new millennium.  This DVD definitely earned the FIVE STARS I gave it..... somewhere in the initial 10 minutes of viewing and carried it throughout.  All I can say is ""Thank you Kevin.  Thank you for giving us all what others are too coward to approach.""",1038873600,8,1135,4.611940298507463

1797514,4,B00007149S,"Kevin Smith is a unique individual. First of all, he's a very clever and skilled comedic writer. Second, he's a very competent filmmaker/director. But perhaps most surprising is he's a remarkably funny guy.

Can you imagine a three hour long Q&A that holds you attention the whole way? Can you picture other legendary filmmakers holding your attention that long just talking? Spielberg? Doubt it. Lucas? Not a chance. Coppola? Only if he whipped up some pasta first.

IN a way it's perhaps some new form of performance. It isn't stand up comedy. There are no routines, no fixed ""bits"". It isn't a dramatization. There's no real structure. It's not even improvization, such as Garrison Keillor manages to spin so skillfully week after week on Prairie Home Companion. It's basically just a very funny, witty, goofy guy talking and answering questions. That's about it. Yes, he tells stories and the writer in him makes them charming and amusing. But there's also a lot of ""what the heck is going on here"", when he gets into exchanges with the audience of questioners.

Some of the stories that Kevin tells tend to be a little long winded, but worth every minute of it.

1797568,4,B00007149S,"Ever wanted to get the insight into a film maker's mind?

This DVD collection (224 minutes total) takes the watcher on his 2001 college tour. He answers all the questions I always wanted to know (pre Jersey Girl) about the artist,actor, comic book and screen writer that is Kevin Smith. He talks about his movies (Clerks, Mallrats, Dogma, Chasing Amy), His  directing his ideas to screen. He talks about  his thoughts and insights of his film casts.  He is very open about his involvement in the Superman film he didn't do, about director Tim Burton, his relationship with film partner Jason Mewes (Jay) and how he met his wife-in graphic detail.

What can i say? --Lets go to the wheel of adjectives....Candid, over the top, wickedly funny...Smith truly entertains. He shows he has an opinion and he is a voice to listen to.

Note, if you don't like Jay and Silent Bob, Clerks, Dogma, drug humor or crude humor-THIS documentary isn't for you

I think it is an amazing concert film

1797569,5,B00007149S,"An Evening With Kevin Smith is Clerks director Smith's up-close-and personal meeting with the fans on five different university campuses across America.

Smith's love of dialogue and flamboyant sense of humor makes watching his gig very enjoyable, even if you're not a fan of his films. Smith answers various questions from the crowd, talking about everything from Jay and Silent Bob, Ben f**king Affleck, producer Jon Peters, Superman Lives, Tim Burton, his wife, and the origins of the word ""shnoogans"". Kevin even demonstrates his gratitude to his fans by calling a former boss of one of the guys to get his job back, disciplining another guy who wouldn't shut his mouth by calling his dad, and inviting Jason Mewes, Jay to Smith's Silent Bob, with him on stage at the University of Wyoming.

What surprised me the most is Kevin Smith's ability to take a stage for long hours- almost 4 hours- and an uncanny talent for comedy- for a while you forget you're watching a film director and think he's a stand-up comedian.

1797571,4,B00007149S,"There is something strangely addictive about An Evening With Kevin Smith. The DVD showcase of Smith's visits to U.S. college campuses, answering questions from students who are often simply trying to grab attention, is something that at first may seem like a waste of three hours. After all, who would want to watch a fat guy talk for that long?

Overtime, however, Smith's quick wit and candidly open commentary about basically any facet of his life grows on you in a warm and friendly manner.  This can be attributed to Smith being so down to earth. Here is a guy after all who has directed a number of feature movies, is friends with Ben Affleck and has created one of the screen's most recognizable character's in Silent Bob, however, his laid back self awareness, whether it be about his weight or his penis size, allows Smith to tear down any pretense of stardom and create a dialogue with his audiences that says ""hey they let a normal person become a celebrity!""

The comfort level Smith creates allows an intimate connection with personality and audience that sucks you in as a viewer, as students feel close enough to Smith to ask questions which prompts answers such as ""you know Woody Allen doesn't go through this.""  The end result is a free flowing dialogue that whizzes by seemingly so quickly that the sheer length of the program is constantly a mind boggler.

As a result, you will end up enjoying listening to a fat guy talk for that long.",1134086400,6,1457,4.653696498054475

Then, a friend of my Mom's brought this DVD over for me to watch. ""An Evening with Kevin Smith"" was pretty much my introduction to the world of the guy who made ""Mallrats.""

My opinion is: This has to be one of the funniest guys on the planet! He tells stories about his life that are hilarious. I didn't even mind the fact that he had one of the dirdiest mouths I've ever heard, he was just so funny!

The best stories he tells are:

1) The story behind the ill-fated ""Superman Reborn"" (for which Smith was commissioned as writer);

2) Filming a religious documentary for Prince, and;

3) When he and his wife joined a protest of his own film (""Dogma"").

While this is definitely not for younger children, any fan of Smith's work will definitely enjoy this.

1797597,4,B00007149S,"I had no idea what this was going to be when I first watched this documentary on the Starz network.  Then I sat, and the very first thing you hear the Jersey filmmaker say is, ""Wow!  This makes up for all the times girls told me I had a small d**k.""  Stand-up comedy, though, this is not.  It's a wonderful compilation of Kevin Smith's visit to several colleges, each having its own Q&A gig.

I've always admired Smith's storytelling (references to pop culture and his own movies, and his blunt way of getting his ideas across), but here he's infinitely better without a script.  There are some deep and insightful questions he gives serious responses to (religious influence---sexual experiences), and there are some downright wacky ones (does he want to hang out afterwards---can somebody suck his d**k).

The real strength of this program are the pop culture questions.  Smith talks about his hellacious experience (for 30 minutes!) filming a documentary for Prince.  He also goes into detail about his attempts to writing a ""Superman"" script, plus some tension with Tim Burton.

The only drawback to ""An Evening With Kevin SMith"" is not the nearly 4-hour length (I'd actually like more...but I'm forgiving).  No, it's actually the biographical questions.  When he details details like how he met producer Scott Mosier, or his friendship with Jason Mewes, he always throws in some funny one-liners and tidbits of funny info.  But the overall answers don't work for me.  I understand that 4 hours leaves a lot of room for a little error, so those few sore questions aren't enough to write this one off.

The DVD features are scarce, but this DVD is for Kevin Smith fans anyway.  I'd even recommend a borrow or rental of this DVD for people interested in one of the current generation's filmmakers ideas.  We always hear about the beauty and drama of classical directors (Scorsese, Spielberg, Lean, Altman...etc), but hearing a Gen-X writer-director speak bluntly about what today's culture and his own life means to him is a wonderful experience.

Highly recommended!",1122681600,2,2069,4.947826086956522
1797598,5,B00007149S,"I know this review is late coming, but I caught this show last night on Starz and then promptly went on-line to buy the DVD.  If you are looking for a serious documentary on Kevin Smith this isn't it...  If you are easily offended you don't want to buy this.  If you are a Kevin Smith fan and love his movies then this is probably right up your alley.  Kevin discusses serious topics as far as why he includes the (...) humor he does, other projects he's worked on and why they fell through or will never be seen (Superman Lives, Prince documentary, etc), and then there are plenty of (...) and fart jokes to take a twisted turn down memory lane.  I work an early shift at my job and I'm awake by 500 AM.  I stayed up until midnight, much to my wife's displeasure, to watch the entire show.  Anyway...  If you are a Kevin Smith fan with a sense of humor this is a must have.  If you are expecting a serious documentary on the man, the myth, the legend... You might want to spend your money on something else, though this does touch on Kevin's personality.  Most of us already knew that though I think.",1122336000,,1101,4.22488038277512
1797599,4,B00007149S,"I read a lot of reviews on Amazon.com, as I am always curious about what other people think. Invariably, the reviewer ""John Q. Public"" comes up with his two cents. Does this man like anything? His comments are routinely negative and rarely on point. For this item, he is discussing Kevin Smith's script for Superman. I'm not trying to buy that here. On the review for Sin City, the movie, he dismisses it because Frank Miller is a ""drunk"". What does that matter?

I'm glad we live in America with the freedom of speech, even though it does mean we have to wade through pointless dreck from someone who clearly did not get enough attention...ever.",1114473600,3,646,4.6173913043478265
1797600,4,B00007149S,"This DVD is what it says it is -- an evening with Kevin Smith answering questions from college audiences.  Within these answers are some hilarious stories about everyone from Kevin Smith regulars (Jason  Mewes, Ben Affleck, etc.) to other celebrities (Prince, Jon Peters, Tim Burton, etc.).  There's also obviously a good amount of background on all of Smith's movies up until ""Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back.""  It's a good look inside Smith as not only a film-maker, but also a person.  There aren't any extras on the DVD, except for a few trailers.  If you're a hardcore fan, worth the $25.  If you're a casual fan, good to rent from Netflix or plop down $10-15 on a used copy.",1114387200,7,677,4.591666666666667
1797601,5,B00007149S,"Kevin talks about a range of topics in this set, including doing a doc for Prince, meeting Jay, the likelyhood of ""Jay and Silent Bob"" ever being in a movie again, how he met his wife, and yes, the aforementioned Superman script.  I doubt that ""John Q. Public"" (if that is his REAL name) watched this set, as he would've known the story behind the script.  ""John"" would know that anything ""unSuperman"" about the script came not from Kevin, but from another source (the story behind it is great... in fact, all of them are, probably from his dilivery).  As for not listening to other people's viewpoints, or insulting those who have different viewpoints than him, perhaps if ""John"" had watched the set, he would've seen a discussion Kevin had with one female questioner (who happened to be a lesbian), conserning ""Chasing Amy"".  Maybe he would've seen what Kevin was trying to say about what closeminded people actually say about themselves.

Over-all, this set is very funny.  I was laughing through pretty much the whole thing (though the few parts where people would come up and ask if he and Jay wanted to go smoke got a bit tiresome (but I'm sure it's much more tiresome for him, cuz I bet he gets it all the time)).  The stories he told were great ones; I was totally eager for him to tell another long story every time he got done with one.  I epecially loved the one about Prince (which is pretty much the last thing in the set).  He said he did this whole doc for Prince about what people thought about one of his CDs.  He worked on it for like a week, and the thing will never see the light of day.  To put that much work into something and have it shot down like that has got to be disappointing.

This is worth getting (yes, it will be more enjoyable to fans).  You'll laugh all the way through, and end up watching it several times.",1108080000,3,1844,4.404129793510324
1797602,4,B00007149S,"`An Evening With Kevin Smith' is the latest of director Kevin Smith's works. Smith is a renowned Indie filmmaker and New Jersey native made famous by his independent film, `Clerks.' Smith speaks out at several college campuses in a Question and Answer format on many topics of interest to college students from his five films and religion, to sex and sexual preference.

Covering two discs and almost four hours, `Evening' will have even non-fans of Smith rolling on the floor with laughter. It is a nonstop express train to comedy-ville that actually delivers what it promises. Smith's frankness and humor allows him to touch on the touchy subjects of religion, sex, and sexual preference without being overly offensive.

Being a fan of Smith and his work I immediately purchased this DVD as soon as possible. However, that sounds easier than the actual process since I had to find a store that heard of it and also had it in stock. In the end I found it in the Special Interest section at Best Buy for $22.99, a bargain as most double discs run at a higher price than that.

True fans who have seen all of his films will enjoy `Evening' more than the average viewer and will not be offended by the plethora of `dick and fart jokes' that Smith's comedy is normally based on. Fan will be depressed near the end of the second disc when they reach scene #39 where Smith discusses the future of Jay and Silent Bob.

The tomfoolery of such films as `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' continues and even goes up a notch with the inclusion of actor Jason Mewes and producer Scott Mosier (via telephone) and of the student audience. Smith takes the time to make several phone calls on student's behalf and even attempts to get a student their job back after losing it in order to attend the performance.

Despite all the positives going for `Evening' it is not for everyone. People who are easily offended, don't enjoy `dick and fart jokes' or disliked Smith's films will want to avoid this DVD at all costs.

For the rest of us, the DVD is a great addition to our personal film collections and is a must have for any Smith fan. The DVD has some superb editing; features bonus trailers, is subtitled in English, French, and Spanish, and is in wide screen format. I highly recommend this and can't wait for the release of Smith's next film, `Jersey Girl'.",1104105600,4,2345,4.58472553699284

1797604,4,B00007149S,"I was not a Kevin Smith Devotee, as most of his fans are.  I think he's a good director, and he has cranked out some great movies.  He does know how to write a good script as well.

So, I was pleasantly surprised when I viewed this to find out really insightful and wise Kevin Smith is.  This documentary is a collection of snippets from a variety of college lectures he's done, but it doesn't feel choppy.  Smith clearly understands the film business and it's culture better than most people whove been in the industry for decades.  He fully admits exploiting it for what it's worth, but also manages to sidestep the pitfalls associated with ascent in Hollywood.  It's a truly eye-opening look into the world of modern day filmmaking and celebrity.

I would also like to recommend this based on the fact that Smith is one of the best story tellers our society has.  He really has a gift for just starting a story, leaving no stone unturned, and just engaging you into what he's relating.  His story about writing the script for Superman will have you in tears.  Another good one is his encounter with Prince.  Smith has an easy-going, self-depricating style that's combined with a smart guy who LOVES the heck outta movies.

This is definitely a good documentary that non-Kevin Smith fans will enjoy and get something from.  If you are a Kevin Smith fan...who are you kidding:  You already own this!",1094515200,10,1400,4.634146341463414

Flipping through the movie network one afternoon, I found this show and watched to kill some time whilst working at the desk.
In four hours, a really down to earth, friendly, intelegent writer/director/actor named Kevin amuses all watching with hillarious tales of film making and every other encounter he has had related to life and movie business. He takes time to answer every diverse question asked by the audience, in which he answers them with time and great laughs. The best part is he has this great habbit of digressing all the time when answering audience members - which is so interesting, you'll discover things you never knew or thought you needed to know. Like what it was like working for Prince (The Artist Formally Known as Prince) - he describes every freakish habbit that arrose by Prince when working on a documentory with him.
To the detractors whom were grossed out by the penis jokes; you may want to remove that rod for just a short time and actually enjoy this show.
I'm hooked on his films now - totally changed my opinion of him and his films. And I recommend ""Dogma"" if you get the chance to rent or buy.",1066348800,3,1326,4.59915611814346

Smith's stories range from his tales of his first meetings with a teenage Jason Mewes (who, as if most of you don't know, plays Jay in Smith's first five films) to his first meeting with View Askew partner Scott Mosier, and to his painfully funny encounter with a then USA Today interviewer who would eventually become his wife.  Smith also tells some tales about his misadventures inside the insanity of Hollywood; including the story behind his ill-fated screenplay for the canned Superman Reborn film and the money grubbing producers behind it.  Audience participation during the Q&A is almost as equally hilarious; including one fan who lost his job just to be there and Kevin calling the kid's boss on his cell phone to try to smooth it over.  My only gripes about this package are that there are really no extras on the DVD besides some bonus trailers for Columbia films, and some other extras would have been more than welcome.  Also, I remember on the Dogma commentary Smith commented on never wanting to work with actress Linda Fiorentino again.  I for one would have loved to hear Smith give more insight on why, but oh well.

1797624,1,B00007149S,Kevin Smith is one of the best writers in show business today - from comics to films he has achieved great things. That's why this DVD is such a disapointment. If you take out all of the unfunny and crude penis jokes your basically left with no value for money. I was hoping for an insight to the mans' great writing skills. Nothing. Jason Mewes makes an appearance and only adds vulgarity.,1057363200,2,390,4.430555555555555
1797625,5,B00007149S,"As soon as I popped An Evening With Kevin Smith into my DVD player, I felt right at home.  Kevin appears on the menu screen immediately and starts acting (silently) about how long you're taking to choose something.  So, before even starting the movie, I saw a character just like Silent Bob on the screen, and felt like this was familiar ground.
  But then Kevin starts speaking.  And speaking.  And speaking.  The movie, is essentially pieced together footage from a college tour Smith did, where he basically hosts a Q and A session.  And, while it can't truly be considered stand up comedy, it's funnier than most comdeians will ever be.
  So, the movie is about three hours of Smith answering fans questions, and topics switch from Jason Mewes' (Jay in the five Jersey flicks) sex life, to Kevin's involvement with a new Superman script, to his first sexual encounter with his wife, to Prince, (yes, the musician.)  And I can gurantee that if you are in the least bit interested in Kevin's films, you'll be laughing so hard the three hours will blow by faster than you could possibly imagine.
  Luckily, there's more to do once you've finished the movie.  While the two-disc set isn't loaded with extra features, it does feature a number of hidden easter eggs, mostly of footage cut from the final film, and they're equally as entertaining as the rest of the movie.
  So, once you've gotten over the initial shock of hearing ""Silent Bob"" speak at length, you should have a great deal of fun with this movie, and I believe it warrants at the nvery least a rental, if not a purchase.",1056585600,,1585,4.627240143369176

Just see his comments on the director of Magnolia.)
With a guest appearance by Jason ""Jay"" Mewes, phone calls to Scott Mosier and a fan's father (""We think your son may be on the pot.""), and hilarious tales at the expense of friend and actor Ben Affleck, this one may not be for the whole family, but you will be in stitches before it's over.",1054771200,2,732,4.125874125874126

The film is comprised of clips from seminars at universities across the country. In addition to a surprise appearance by his on-screen ""hetero life-mate"" Jason Mewes, Smith takes questions from the audience consisting of not only university students, but also fans of his movies. The huge size of the audience (some are in the thousands) is a testament to how large the cult following of Kevin Smith actually is.
Throughout ""Evening"" Smith gives the audience a laugh a minute, displaying his natural sense of humor that can be seen in all of his movies. Among the subjects covered are: how he chose Mewes for the part of Jay, and why  Smith's character ""Silent Bob"" is  silent? He also discusses how ""hurtful"" it was when he met his wife, and his appearance on the cover of the pot-legalization magazine ""High Times.""
On a more serious note, Smith talks about his controversial religious film ""Dogma"", and reveals, among other things, how many death threats he received because of it.
Probably the most fascinating parts of ""Evening"" are when Smith talks about some of the unusual movie projects he has been asked to contribute to. He reveals at great lengths the inside stories on: writing the script for a new ""Superman"" movie; and the documentary he filmed on pop star Prince that will probably never be seen. He says he did them because he is, in his own words, a ""press whore.""
Finally, he answers the question he gets from his fans probably more than any other: will there be another ""Jay and Silent Bob"" movie?
In conclusion, if you're like me and you are a fan of Kevin Smith's five films, this video is well worth the price. Smith is just as entertaining answering questions as he is in his movies.",1046649600,3,1965,4.793510324483776
1797654,5,B00007149S,"The Hometown Boy Who Made Good expands his magical sense of community over two jam packed discs( I'm still finding Easter Eggs).  It's cool stuff, Smith shoots from the hip with college kids, bantering back and forth about his work and personal philosophies.  If you like any of the Askew movies, this is just another one to see, own, love.  In its own loose way it manages to be cinematic, or at least as visually ambitious as Clerks.  Kevin moves the show along by bringing out long time co-hort Jason Mewes, and fills the gaps by calling friends and audience members employers.
I've seen reviews that call this self-absorbed, but what were you expecting?  The man keeps an open on-line journal.  I don't know that in 20 years his daughter will be happy that there's a detailed account of her parents first sexual encounter, but I found the story pretty funny.  Like everything else he does, Kevin pulls you in by never playing it too cool, giving everybody a toe hold to find a common ground with him through his work and words.  This is just the most personal his media has ever become.
It also lends itself to multiple viewings.  I've watched Smith tell the story about trying to write Superman:Reborn a couple of times and I still laugh when he gets to the part about Jon Peters and the giant spider.
Pulling from a series of lectures cut into almost four hours (maybe more, seriously, if you buy it check all over the place for hidden footage) of video, the only criticism I have of this video is the audio in several of the halls was poor, Smith's mic is on the verge of feedback during the cuts from those shows.  However, I remind myself the techs were probably kids on work study and that somehow makes the sound quality more legit in the Askiewneverse, where the kid pumping your gas today could be up for a Golden Globe next year.

smith is like that articulate slaker we all knew between the ages of 18 and 24. the one that held evryone in his glib sway down at the 24 hour coffee shop. with witty observations unbelievable stories and well placed fart jokes.

You need NOT be a Kevin Smith fan to enjoy this DVD. It helps to be familiar with Smith's films in order to fully appreciate 100 percent of the his Q&A and anecdotes. But the best and most entertaining portions of this show are the stories that have nothing to do with his films. Non-Smith fans will find a great portion of this DVD hilarious and highly entertaining. Anecdotes such as: the disastrous pairing of Smith with Jon Peters to do the Superman Lives movie; his snickering rip on Tim Burton; the so-weird-it-must-be-true story about filming the Prince documentary; his first sexual encounter with his wife; his use of the cell phone during the shows to call family and friends of audience members; the story about his participation in a religious group's protest of his own film.
It is quite a compliment to Smith's abilities as a raconteur that his stories are so entertaining, and yet if you or I tried to tell the same story (or describe the one that he told), we would be met with blank stares. Try it. Try retelling one of the stories from this DVD to your friends. It's just not the same.

1797669,5,B00007149S,"Fans of Kevin Smith have long known he does some of the most entertaining, informative commentaries you can get on a DVD. Well, look at this new two-disc set as being all commentary, and you won't be disappointed.
Last year, film crews followed Smith as he made a tour of several college campuses, conducting his now-famous Q&A lectures. Over the course of the two discs, Smith talks for two hours about his adventures in the film industry, his friendships, his marriage, his family -- you name it, he dishes the dirt. Have you ever wondered what happened to the script he wrote for a Superman movie some years ago? The story is here. Heard about the documentary he was going to make for Prince? It's here. Wonder how he met and fell in love with his wife? It's here too. And every minute of it is as entertaining as anything you've ever seen on DVD.
Smith doesn't try to hog the spotlight -- Jason ""Jay"" Mewes joins him at one point, and he frequently engages audience members in conversations that elevate them almost to the level of co-stars. Smith isn't worried about burning bridges, either -- he dishes the dirt on a few people, but it's a few people he clearly never wants to deal with again. (Now if we could just get everybody else in Hollywood to make DVDs where they badmouth Producer Jon Peters, the world of film would be a better place.)
As far as extras go... there's not much. (What did you expect, a commentary?) There are a few Easter Eggs spotlighting bonus moments from the tour. They're nice, but one wonders why they couldn't have just been included in the film itself. You get a few ""bonus trailers"" as well. My favorite ""extra"" though, such as it is, is the menus. Before you start the film on each disc, just watch the menus for a few minutes. They're hysterical.
All in all, a really good DVD for fans of Kevin Smith. The rest of you probably won't get it anyway -- but you should. Check out his movies, then come back and watch this.",1042416000,14,1960,4.462395543175488
1797670,5,B00007149S,"My admiration of Kevin Smith borders on worship. His unspeakably witty, scathing dialogue that rocket-propels his movies along is among the best ever written. But the one thing that everyone will point out is that 99.99999 (off into infinity)% of this dialogue is never for him, although he's been in all of his own films. Well, that's cuz Kevin Smith is Silent Bob (as if you didn't already know that). But when Silent Bob does speak, you see every eye in the theater open a bit wider, every ear perk up a bit. From his heartfelt monologue in ""Chasing Amy"" to the nugget of hilarity he let loose on the train in ""Dogma,"" Silent Bob, whether living up to his title or not, commands attention. That's why I was so excited for this DVD.
Silent Bob speaks. For three and a half hours.
I couldn't be happier. From beginning to end, the ""Evening With Kevin Smith"" DVD is a comic treasure. Visiting universities all over the country (Cornell, Clark, Indiana, Wyoming, Kent, etc.), Smith fields questions from all kinds of audience members about all aspects of his films. From the origin of the term ""snoogans"" and his friendship with Jason Mewes, all the way up to his first time with his wife and an unheard of Prince documentary, Silent Bob stands up and tells all. But sorry, folks, he doesn't dance.
As far as the best stuff on this DVD is concerned, look for Smith's story about his stint on Superman, the story of how he met his wife, and the entire Q&A at U of Wyoming, when he is joined by a special guest. This is just pure entertainment. Silent Bob does know how to talk, and he's as witty as he is intelligent. If you're a Kevin Smith fan, you have some buddies that are Smith fans, and a few hours to party and hang out, pick this up at your local video store, buy some beer and chips, then kick back and enjoy the musings of one of our most interesting filmmakers.",1041984000,2,1871,4.426086956521739
1797671,5,B00007149S,"Every true Kevin Smith fan should have this in their DVD collection.  Not only is it a wonderful insight on the movies, his scripts, his experiences making them, but it's also hillariously funny, full of great anecdotes about filming and personal experiences.  The perfect combination of seriousness with smart-... comments and jokes, just like his movies.  Smith relates on a one-on-one level with his audience, making it personal and interesting the whole time.  If you've ever wanted to get to know more about Kevin Smith and his work, this is the perfect dvd.",1041897600,,563,5.021505376344086
1797672,5,B00007149S,"Here's your chance to hear Kevin speak.  The only problem I have with this is that its 4 hours long, and funnier than hell.  By the time you get throught it, you hafta watch it again to remember what was in the begining.  Get this DVD, you won't regret it.",1041292800,2,256,4.08
1797673,5,B00007149S,"""An Evening with Kevin Smith"" reveals just about everything you ever wanted to know about the genius behind the films ""Clerks,"" ""Mallrats,"" ""Chasing Amy,"" ""Dogma,"" and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.""  That's right, the really quiet guy actually has a lot to say, and it is all entertaining, insightful, interesting, and funny as hell.  Coming from a guy who watches and listens to a lot of stand-up comedy, I was laughing pretty much non-stop.
Smith isn't trying to be funny... it just happens to turn out that way.  His subtle and quiet tone makes it all the more entertaining and funny.  Through the humor and sarcastic responses, there's nothing but honesty and sincerity about the filmmaking business that he is in.
With two disks, you get over 3 hours of Kevin Smith talking to various universities.  As soon as the disks are over, you want to watch them again.  I love all of Smith's movies, although I have to admit ""Chasing Amy"" is probably my least favorite (but I still think it's good), and watching this was not only funny and entertaining, but it was very informative.  Smith isn't shy about answering the tough questions.  (Some of them, he should be though.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.)
He talks about everything.  Some of the stuff he covers are what went on behind the shooting of his movies, his relationships with his actors and friends, critics who have bad-mouthed him, a really messed up director who's obsessed with friggen spiders, how he met his wife, his run in with Tim Burton (or not so much of a ""run-in,"" more like a ""press-in), Scott Mosier Stories, and much, much more.
The DVD set is really cool.  To my surprise, the whole thing is WIDESCREEN.  Always a major welcome, no matter what the content is.  Since this is only  Kevin Smith talking to universities, there's no need for special features galore, however there are some bonus trailers.  The DVDs are also digitally mastered in audio and anamorphic video.
If you are a fan of Kevin Smith, then this is a must-have.  Go and buy this right now!  Trust me, you will not regret it for a second.  Hey, I even recommend this for all of Smith's negative critics.  Maybe they can take something positive from it all.  I was really impressed.  You'll laugh and learn at the same time.  Now who often does that happen?",1041033600,38,2313,4.631449631449631
1797674,4,B00007149S,"This is an odd little DVD. It is not a movie, nor is it a documentary. As the title would suggest, it is simple An Evening With Kevin Smith / Or, several evenings as the case may be.
Kevin Smith is one of my favorite directors. This is not because he has the most skill or is a master of the craft, but rather because his movies are simply enjoyable to watch. With some directors, you can tell it is their work because of the camera work, or the lighting...but with Smith, you can close your eyes and tell that Smith wrote it. The language is distinctly his own and it always makes me laugh and even think a little. They are also highly quotable.
As a fan of DVD, I enjoy the special features that are often put on the releases. One of my favorite features is the option to have a commentary track run over the movie so i can listen to the director (or someone) speak about the movie. You learn little tid bits about the film and making it. Some directors are not that interesting on commentary tracks (Rob Reiner on When Harry Met Sally was quite dull), but the man who gives consistently good and funny commentary is Kevin Smith. Smith is the director of Clerks , Mallrats , Chasing Amy , Dogma , and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back . He had a short lived animated series Clerks Uncensored . He is currently filming Jersey Girl .
Over the past several years, Kevin Smith has had speaking engagements at colleges and universities. The DVD covers several of those appearances. That might not sound too interesting to own or to watch, but Smith is consistently funny and always interesting, no matter what he is talking about. The feature is set up as a Q&A format, so we see the audience participation and get the really dumb questions (which Smith makes obvious) as well as the good thoughtful one(s). This is very watchable, and very funny and highly recommended if you are a fan of Kevin Smith's work. If you're not, you may want to pass on this.",1040947200,3,1948,4.369146005509642
1797675,5,B00007149S,"Kevin Smith is the director behind five of my favorite movies.  Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma and Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back were all created as a part of Kevin's ""New Jersey Chronicles,"" in which each of the afformentioned movies had recurring characters from the previous films.  Each film is laced with witty dialogue and even some serious messages mixed in.
On this DVD, Kevin talks about anything and everything ranging from the failed documentary with Prince to a soft-core porn involving Jason Mewes, who is known to all as Jay in the ""New Jersey"" movies.  Kevin's most interesting topic was the controversey surrounding ""Dogma.""  Kevin talks about the death threats he recieved, his Catholic up-bringing and about the time he picketted at his own movie.  However, nothing is as amusing as the story behind his failed attempt to revive the Superman movie franchise.  Kevin talks about his meetings with Warner Bros. executives and the producer at the time who had some unusual requests as to what he wanted included in the script.
All and all, if you are a fan of the Kevin Smith movies, you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of this DVD.  If you have not seen any of Kevin's movies, you owe it to yourself to buy every single one of them and then to buy this.",1040688000,20,1279,4.632743362831858

7973457,5,B00007149S,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday and it was hilarious.  Kevin Smith shows, at least in his early thirties per this DVD, that he's just a down-to-earth funny guy.  It is a Q&A but be forewarned that not many questions get answered because Smith has a tendency to start with the answer, move to 3 or 4 different tangents, then end with the ultimate answer.  I'm not complaining about that, but just preparing that you shouldn't be expecting a 20-30 person line of questioning.  I had no real feelings towards Smith prior to watching this DVD (liked some of his movies, didn't like others, no feelings about him personally) but this DVD was so enjoyable I couldn't wait to get to the next one.  He seems like a really fun guy to chat with.",1424908800,,749,4.437956204379562
