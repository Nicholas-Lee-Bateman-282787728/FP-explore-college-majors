8300972,5,B001F4YKCE,"The package arrived before the expected delivery date. The patterns were also included. I just watched the whole DVD and loved seeing the details and steps in making these awesome looking purses. I have been decorating cakes for a little over a year so I understand how I can use these directions on a much larger cake. Only wish that it came with a list of recommended supplies and the recipe that they use for fondant or gumpaste. And they didn't show how to do the black clutch purse, but that one looks pretty basic to adapt to. Overall, I really enjoyed this DVD and can't wait for someone to order a purse cake from me!",1267142400,7,625,4.396551724137931
