8251647,5,B0013KYB24,"I was so excited when I saw these series were available on Amazon. One day I was searching through You Tube and found them, but I wanted to be able to watch them on my dvd player while traveling. If your a Weather Fanatic the way I am, then these series will be just for You! Super Tornado Dalls is my favorite episode on Perfect Disaster. The Ice Storm episode is really great too.",1481760000,,382,4.175675675675675
8251648,5,B0013KYB24,"This was extremely hard to find either online or in a store. I ended up stumbling upon it here on Amazon and quickly snagged it up. I love this series of ""Perfect Disasters"" it is a very intriguing idea of the possibilities of what nature can reek havoc on and how. This is a Discovery channel series so don't expect the greatest  of acting but a good series nonetheless.",1382140800,,371,4.3768115942028984
8251649,5,B0013KYB24,"Perfect Disaster is incredible with good acting in every episode, and awsome special effects. The best ones were Super Tornado,Fire Storm,and Solar flare. I never saw Super typhoon or Snow storm but they sound good. Mega Flood was not really good. It dosent mean you cant see it,if you whant to go ahead. This is worth buying. The discovery channel website has it for a cheaper price. Disaster movie fans you need to see this,it might be a docudrama but its more like a movie. You won't be disapointed trust me!",1246406400,3,511,4.626373626373627
