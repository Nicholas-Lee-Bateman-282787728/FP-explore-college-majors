8104191,4,B000E1P28A,"Demonstone is paranormal, police procedural in the guise of a detective movie.  Although it is a low-budget, midnight classic cult (or ought to be cult), is a lot of fun.  Jan-Michael Vincent narrates the film like Phillip Marlowe might do.  Indeed, like Marlowe, Andy Buck has recently quit the military because of a very military dispute.  Like Marlowe, Buck is very insubordinate.  Therefore, we have a sturdy genre character.  Add to the formula a demonically possessed amulet, and a vindictive father and sons out to kill the hero and youve got a neat little thriller.  The villain is a slimy mobster/politician whose evil dates back to ancient times.  Nancy Everhard is a television reporter.  She is a primarily character, not strictly a love interest.  She also turns out to be the most surprising character in Demonstone.  Of course, grumpy R. Lee Emery is always joy to watch, and his dialogue is memorable.  Impressively decked out in Navy dress whites, Peter Brown makes a believable Admiral.  It should come as no surprise that his character and Buck don't get along.  The hero and the villain are definitely at odds.

Demonstone opens with our heros first person narration.  The legend of the Heart stone goes a long way back in Chinese history.  The key to awesome power, it also inspired greed, envy, and violence in those who pursued it.  A warrior priest named Han Chin was the last man to wear the stone.  He left China with his followers in 1489.  He settled in a remote part of the world known as the Philippines.  There he remained untouched until a travel known as Belfardo decided that he must possess it.
Professor Olmeda and his workers find a 400-year old tomb in a cave.  Despite her claustrophobia, a harmless-looking lady, Sharon Gale (Nancy Everhard) joins Olmeda in the cave.  She spots the medallion and finds herself experiencing a flashback.  She sees a native bandit steal the medallion from Han Chin.  Chin vows to kill all his descendents.  Meantime, elsewhere on the island, Andy Buck (Jan-Michael Vincent of Defiance) is staking out a corner dive called the Silver Eagle where a buddy of his died.  Buck has resigned his commission in the Marine Corps.  In his narration, Buck explains that he has a personal score to settle with a man named Senator Belfardo.  He has spent a week night and day watching the place.  He watches as Tony McKee (Pat Skipper) is confronted by three thugs at the entrance.  They take him into the bar and kick him about.  Buck tries to intervene, but they gang up on him.  Eventually, he beats them up, while the thugs try to get him to pay up his gambling debts.  Just as Belfardo is about to stab McKee to death, a blinding white light pierces the room.  When Buck enters the room where Belfardo was going to kill McKee, he is shocked by what he sees.  Whatever it is, director Anthony Prowse prefers to keep it hidden.

Marine Corps Colonel Joe Haines (R. Lee Emery of Full Metal Jacket) is getting a back massage when Buck calls him late at night warning him that the Corps is in some deep trouble.  When Haines shows up at the scene of the crime, he looks at the three thugs and their horrible wounds.  He takes a bloody knife away from McKee.  The local authorities want to arrest McKee.  Haines says about the crime scene, Looks like some kind of voodoo crap.  Senator Belfardo is appropriately angry, and an army of protests surrounded Haines and Buck with McKee.  Later, the Marine doctor says McKee is suffering from the worst case of shock hes ever seen.  The Admiral (Peter Brown) shows up at the hospital with a nervous expression because the military agreement with the Philippines is at stake.  Not surprisingly, the Admiral isn't happy to see Andy Buck.  McKee escapes from custody while the Admiral attends Belfardos sons wedding.  Afterward, our heroes pursue, capture, and struggle to protect a suspected murderer from a pugnacious family.  The action is swiftly-paced, with some humor, and the horror.  Youll be surprised as who is responsible for killing the Belfardos.  It won't take you long to figure out the identity of the monster.  The monster is a sort of shape shifter and doesnt remember anything during the transition moments of her transformation.  We have an obligatory kissing and sleep rendezvous between the leading man and the leading lady that doesnt rely of naked body parts.  The dialogue is a lot better than youd expect from a movie like this.  My favorite R. Lee Emery lines out of several are: I support half of the whores in Manilla.  I knowem all.  Emery and Vincent make a chummy pair of detectives with a friendly rivalry.  Prowse doesnt emphasize blood and gore as much as he could.  The glowing death scenes and the lighting won't give you goose bumps but it is atmospheric.  Demonstone ranks as an above-average, often exciting, paranormal thriller.",1405728000,,4868,4.7604790419161676
8104192,4,B000E1P28A,I only purchased due to the actor in the movie. It's okay but I'd rate it as a 'B' movie.,1377475200,,89,3.5
