with some period instruments circa 1792. A single stage setting
with six singers. Palino and Carolina have secretly married.
Carolina is the youngest daughter of Signor Geronimo a wealthy
merchant. Elisetta is his oldest and their aunt Fidalma, widowed
lives in the same house and has a heavy investment in the family
business. A marriage contract is drawn up to tie Elisetta to Count Robinson, a local Lord. Apprised of the situation a sibling
debate is entered into as to Elisetta's new title. The widowed
aunt who keeps the peace, secretly has a passion for (""Itis much better with a husband"")Palino, who is sponsered by the count.
Count Robinson arrives for the first time to meet his intended but takes a fancy to Carolina. The fun and the confusion now begins with many scenario's to follow. The Count offers a dowary
reduction to Geronimo and follows up to tell the intended, what
a rouge he is. Robinson piles up the character flaws. She tells
him these are mere trifles, not convinced burst into uncontolable
laughter. Eventually the secret surfaces The count gives and will
marry Elisetta. Fidamal is embarressed. Geronimo who has been spun into confusion wants to disown Carolina. He is reminded that
she is with child. All is forgiven.
The non singing parts of the house staff add to the comedy.

7956356,5,B00005Y6ZD,I enjoyed it.  This is worth owning and viewing!  It has ENGLISH SUBTITLES which helps non-Italians like me stay interessted.  Buy it!,1377820800,,134,5.0
7956357,5,B00005Y6ZD,What an opera and production. I watched this opera  so many times that I know it by heart. Cimarosa is at his best and the performers were superb. I recommend this opera to everyone.,1373068800,,182,4.352941176470588
7956358,2,B00005Y6ZD,"Il Matrimonio Segreto is, unfortunately, the only opera by Cimarosa that has been recorded on DVD.  That is a pity because he wrote so many.  Because of that, I am writing this (after seeing it) to warn prospective buyers that this is much inferior to the recording from the Schwetzinge Rokokotheater, directed by Michael Hampe and with David Kuebler, Georgina Resick, Barbara Daiels and Carlos Feller.  The acting, singing and orchestra are so very much better, as is the technical quality of the recording.

If you will only buy one version, get the one I have described.  Since this will be the only Cimarosa opera available, you should get the best.",1362960000,,653,4.846846846846847

7956360,5,B00005Y6ZD,"I enjoyed this very funny production of Il Matrimonio Segreto thoroughly!  The set and costumes were very bright and colorful and the wig dynamics were an extra funny touch.  The acting was especially animated and the singing was good, too.  The brightest star of the show for me was Mario Cassi as Il Conte Robinson. Alberto Rinaldi has been a favorite of mine (often appearing with David Kuebler and Allesandro Corbelli) who played a very funny Geronimo.  At times of ""stress"" the top piece of his wig would ""boing!"" straight up.  After Fidalma proposes marriage to Paolino, he falls over with surprise behind the store counter and emerges with his red wig standing on end--very funny! The rest of the cast includes Cinzia Forte as Carolina; Priscille Laplace as Elisetta; Damiana Pinti as Fidalma; and Aldo Caputo as Paolino.  Giovanni Antonini conducted a lively score supporting the singers without drowning them out.  Overall, this was an excellent ensemble, accentuating the buffa without being slapstick.

I've seen two other productions of this opera and reviewed the David Kuebler, Carlos Feller, Barbara Daniels, etc., for Amazon.  That one was excellent.  This one is a welcome complement.  This opera deserves repetition!",1282348800,2,1234,5.181818181818182
7956361,1,B00005Y6ZD,"The singing is awful. Usually on a DVD singers vary in the quality of their performances, not here.  Here they ALL suffer from being frequently off pitch,  The sopranos are thin and shrill like chalk on a blackboard. The male voices are worn and gravelly, sounding spoken even when sung. The orchestra has a peculiar slow tempo that sucks the air out of the music. There is a fine Euroarts 2005 release of a 1986 performance by the Drottningholm Court Theater staring Feller, Daniels, Resick and David Kuebler (in his element here) that is a telling comparison.  When played side by side. the two overtures sound like different  pieces music.  Despite its earlier release date, the Drottningholm recording is full of life and fun, making it possible to understand why Emperor Leopold II is said to have asked for an encore of the complete opera.",1269043200,4,845,4.8
7956362,4,B00005Y6ZD,"The singing is superb, the acting is good and the storyline, such as it is, is a lot of fun and pleasantries. I have been acquainted with this production since it appeared in the VHS format way back when. A pity that, unlike the majority of re-issues in DVD, this one presents very litle improvement over the original video cassete, both aural and visual. This shortcoming, in my view, robbed it of a full five-star rating.",1141603200,2,423,4.578947368421052
7956363,4,B00005Y6ZD,"Cimarosa#s opera is a rare gem,seldom performed, but full of vivid enjoyable music. It needs an ensemble of six singers with coloratura and capable of  acting. In this production everyone gives his best. The set is simple ,the costumes  very nice. If you like comic opera then enjoy this one settled between Mozart and Rossini.",1125705600,2,327,4.927272727272728
7956364,5,B00005Y6ZD,"What a delightful opera!  I first became aware of Il Matrimonio Segreto from the recording, No Tenors Allowed, that features a duet from this opera, ""Se fiato in corpo avete."" I have since discovered that has far more to offer that that one glorious piece.  Segreto is a fun, funny and light-hearted rollick in the true buffo tradition.  The story is silly and convoluted, but then again that is half the fun.  The music is light, and while not quite on par with Mozart (a contemporary of Cimarosa), who is?  Cimarosa is certainly no slouch and offers a wonderful example of late eighteenth century musical style.
This DVD recording is also a delight to watch.  With only the six principles in the cast, (with the occasional ""super"" non-singing extra making brief appearances), you need not only great singers but capable actors to pull this off.  These six did a fantastic job not only musically, but in their acting (not always a forte of opera singers). I was ""sold"" on the fact that they were these characters and impressed by how well they melded their music to assist the action and character development. Buffo is much harder to do correctly than drama, and this cast is outstanding.  It is actually funny.
I don't always notice the director's ""hand"" in operas, but I was very impressed by the direction of Claus Viller in this production.  The staging is sparse and uncluttered, which enhances the sparseness of the cast and adds to the dramatic flow.
I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD to any opera buffs, either in casual or fanatical stripe.",1076371200,5,1553,4.786516853932584
