8187073,1,B000OX62PA,"I searched high and low for this movie for years and finally found it on Amazon.com marketplace. After the classic The Outlaw Josey Wales, I had hoped that this would at least be a good tribute but was sadly disappointed. Michael Parks does not even attempt to portray Josey Wales in any type of way like Clint Eastwood did. This movie absolutely destroys the iconic character that Clint Eastwood created. Besides the character, the story was pretty dull. This could have been done so much better. I am sure that if Parks did not play Josey Wales, it would be a so-so western. But with the name, there was way too much to live up to. This movie was a Michael Parks project all the way as he also directed it. It never should have been made. I am glad I got to finally see the movie but I was so disappointed.",1278547200,9,808,4.322368421052632
