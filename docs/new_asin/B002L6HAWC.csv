8456422,5,B002L6HAWC,"They say history repeats itself.  After watching the flappers video I tend to agree. We went from the era of over indulgence to depression in the twenties.  And we have pretty much done the same thing today.  Instead with the monetary controls in place we were able to stop the slide into a depression. Women are now leading the numbers in the work force and the media has taken control.
Thats why I like looking back in time because you see what is ahead of you.",1252800000,2,463,4.3604651162790695
