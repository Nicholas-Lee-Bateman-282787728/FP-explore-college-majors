What man could envision a wall stretching across the entire border of this new empire? What man could terrorize his subjects, yet remain a beloved and legendary figure?

Credited with both unifying China and tormenting its citizenry, Qin Shi Huangdi, the ""first emperor of China,"" is one of the most controversial leaders in the nation's history --- This documentary delves into the ruler's complex legacy, from the brilliant military strategies that created an empire to his plans for the original Great Wall.

The monarch known now as Qin Shi Huang personal name Yng Zhng, was king of the Chinese State of Qin from 247 BCE to 221 BCE (officially still under the Zhou Dynasty), and then the first emperor of a unified China from 221 BCE to 210 BCE, ruling under the name the First Emperor --- As the ruler of the Great Qin, he was known for the introduction of Legalism and also for unifying China.

Qin Shi Huang remains a controversial figure in Chinese history --- Having unified China, he and his chief adviser Li Si passed a series of major reforms aimed at cementing unification, and they undertook some gigantic projects, most notably the precursor version of the current Great Wall of China, a city-sized mausoleum guarded by a life-sized Terracotta Army, and a massive national road system, at the expense of numerous human lives --- To ensure stability, he outlawed Confucianism and buried many of its scholars alive, banning and burning all books other than those officially decreed.

Despite the tyranny of his autocratic rule, Qin Shi Huang is still regarded by many today as a pivotal figure in Chinese history whose unification of China has endured for more than two millennia --- His accomplishments were unprecedented, his charisma was irresistible --- Learn the SECRETS OF CHINA'S FIRST EMPEROR with this revelatory and instructive DVD.

3144899,3,B0015I2SIS,"This work speaks about the first emperor, a slave who would have been forced to make his mausoleum, the mausoleum, the walls built around China, the terracotta soldiers, etc.  Basically, this may feel like ""too many cooks"" for some.  This work won't help you pass a test in Chinses history.  But if you wanted some quick knowledge about a longstanding civilization, then this was a good starting point.

This work showed an assassin failing to kill the emperor who was a few feet away.  It showed how many writing styles were unified into one legal style.  In short, this brings up a lot that was mentioned in Jet Li's ""Hero,"" so viewers might want to see this documentary if they loved that film.

This work says the emperor feared death.  He built a huge afterworld.  It took thousands of people to create it.  It included many of the creature comforts of the contemporary living world.  In short, it sure sounded like the pharaohs in Ancient Egypt, but that group is not mentioned here.",1214784000,3,989,4.658959537572255

8258519,5,B0015I2SIS,"A great DVD for learning about China's first Emperor. He had to do things to keep the warring states united. In the beginning of every country, the leaders had to keep their country the way that they wanted it to be. The USA did the same to Native Americans. Washington, DC gave orders that if the Indians did not want to live on a reservation, to eliminate them and I read that in books and viewed on DVD that I bought from Amazon.",1502582400,,432,4.216867469879518

8258525,3,B0015I2SIS,"This is short documentary of the Qin emperor and his exploits. Although the DVD  claims  to give us an in-depth look of  this controversial ruler, it is not comparable to the History channel's China's First Emperor.
Also there are  a lot of discrepancies between the facts presented by this movie and  the History Channel's DVD. In my opinion the second  shows more research and closer to the truth.",1375488000,,399,4.794117647058823
8258526,4,B0015I2SIS,"I used this video with my Contemporary World cultures class in order to tie into what we were currently studying, but also to give them a glimpse of the history and background of the emperor, the terra cotta warriors and to show them the time and pain staking effort that is going into restoring and recovering an historical marvel at the tomb of the emperor.

8258528,5,B0015I2SIS,"""Secrets of China's First Emperor"" is both informative and entertaining. It has the usual experts explaining the archeological finds, as well as actors reenacting scenes from the Qin emperor's life. The dramatic scenes are obviously low-budget, but they're pretty comprehensive and provide a look at several aspects of Qin's life and times. TThe documentary doesn't just repeat several scenes over and over, as happens too frequently with these types of movies. This documentary is now playing alongside the Terra Cotta Warriors exhibit, and is definitely worth watching before you see the warriors themselves.",1267228800,4,610,5.56989247311828
