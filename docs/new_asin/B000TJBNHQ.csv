2904066,5,B000TJBNHQ,"... it never had a broadcaster who deserved it.

The storyline is epic and captivating, expanding on the original movie and introducing hundreds of new aspects. The acting is what it should be - quick, sharp witty one-liners said with ease and conviction - and the pace of each episode is perfect.

However, it's the action and special effects that make the series exciting. Sure, it's repetitive at times, but that sense of jeopardy, danger and adventure never lets go, making it fantastic entertainment.",1186012800,24,505,5.0
2904067,5,B000TJBNHQ,"Most TV shows spun off from movies are uninvolving and uninteresting (""Blade,"" anyone?), but such wasn't the case with ""Stargate SG-1."" Starting as a simple exploration series, the series expanded into a brilliant tangle of politics, aliens, and Earth's spirit and guts -- excellent writing, acting, and a sense of humor about itself and its characters.

The Stargate has been inactive for a year. Then a bunch of Egyptian-styled warriors come through and kidnap an officer. General Hammond (Don S. Davis) pulls Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) out of retirement, and sends him to Abydos to find out what happened. O'Neill is reunited with Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) -- only to have Daniel's wife and brother-in-law abducted by the evil Apophis. A rescue attempt sparks off a war with the Goa'uld -- aliens who have been impersonating human gods for many centuries.

So the team SG-1 -- made up of O'Neill, Jackson, scientist/pilot Sam Carter (Amanda Tapping) and Apophis' ex-slave Teal'c (Christopher Judge) -- explore through the Stargate, finding plenty of hostile aliens, strange allies (the Unas, the Asgard), and humans scattered all over. Not to mention the gate-builders, who have ascended to another plane.

Frst they battle the arrogant Apophis, then the devil-imitating So'kar, and the malignant half-energy Anubis and his army of undead warriors. The Goa'uld power structure starts to splinter, and new secret organizations make power plays on Earth, as SG-1 uncovers the hidden legacies of humanity's ancestors.

Even after the Goa'uld storyline ends, things haven't ended for SG-1. Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder) is given command of SG-1, and manages to gather the disbanded team back together, with the help of a quirky alien mercenary, Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black). Together, they find that the Milky Way faces its most deadly threat ever -- the Ori, evil ascended beings who demand that everyone worship them... or else.

Previously all ""exploration"" sci-fi focused on people on ships. ""Stargate"" avoids the usual space opera approach -- even when ships are introduced, the main focus is on walking through a big stone ring. It's also full of real military, political battles (both on and off Earth), and a very plausible reason why everybody in the galaxy (more or less) looks just like us.

It's graced with elaborate, opulant sets, solid special effects, shoot-'em-up action from Marines and Air Force, and some truly kinetic space battles (including one that resembles the climax of ""Star Wars IV""). The storyline stumbles somewhat in the last two seasons, with the sudden switch in villains and cast. But all ten seasons are sprinkled with very warm human moments -- Daniel's farewell to his wife, Sam bonding with a doomed little girl, and Teal'c's struggle for freedom.

Best of all is the snappy script. Some of it comes from Teal'c (""Undomesticated equines could not remove me""), but mostly from the tart-tongued O'Neill (""Well, I guess we all start shooting. There's blood, death, hard feelings... it'd suck""). Other characters get great lines too ("" I think the circle means 'the place of our legacy'...or it could be 'a piece of our leg', but the first seems to make more sense"").

The cast is nothing short of brilliant -- Anderson does a quirky, disrespectful, pop culture-lovin' guy with a hidden tragic past, while Tapping and Shanks are great as an enthusiastic geek and a smart, capable military woman. And Judge is absolutely astounding as Teal'c, who slowly turns from a stoic, tragic warrior to a warm legendary hero.

Corin Nemec had a one-season stint as Daniel's ""replacement,"" and he makes a nice, eager young newbie, and Ben Browder channels much of O'Neill's quirkiness when Anderson left. Black is kind of annoying at times, but she's admittedly quite funny and quirky, with a tragic past of her own.

""Stargate SG-1"" is undeniably the best TV spinoff, and one of the best ""exploration"" shows to make it onto the air... and stay there for a whole decade. Definitely worth seeing, from beginning to end.",1184630400,264,4058,5.09789156626506

Okay, it looks cool, but the packaging is awful. Thin cardboard sleeves with no plastic or any protection at all equals scratched and bruised disks. I could not get past Disk 1; the rest were completely unreadable.

There is writing on the brown part around the Stargate and the middle is an awesome blue that seems to shimmer in the light. I have watched this all 10 seasons AND the special features MANY times over the years not just with my sister and dad but my son who has come to love it as much as I do! The disks didn't skip I have watched them quite a lot and they still haven't scratched. Any die hard fan of the show must own this!
The only bad thing about it is the way the disks are in the holders. it's one long accordion shape that you have to get just right in order for it to fit right and the disks are hard as you know what to first get out.

2904222,1,B000TJBNHQ,"I want to first say that this is NOT a review of the series. The series is amazing, and if you like sci-fi, you should watch it.

Thus particular set, though, is terrible. Almost every disc was scuffed or scratched. The packaging seems to be designed specifically to ensure maximum scratching of the discs. Each disc is simply slid into glossy cardboard half sleeves.

I'm very disappointed. I've been a fan of SG1 since I was 12 years old and have been seriously looking forward to owning this collection, especially for the special features. My husband just bought it for me and realizing that each disc was scratched from the get go was a truly frustrating experience. I'll be returning this for a refund and, I suppose, purchasing the seasons individually. This means not getting the exclusive special features I was do looking forward to, but it is what it is. I can't spend this amount of money for discs that may or may not work.",1423180800,,936,4.632530120481928

2904225,5,B000TJBNHQ,"First I want to say that I didn't spend the $190 for the whole box set. I built mine gradually buying the DVDs over time so my review isn't about physical quality of this set. I basically want to tell people how I feel about StarGate SG1 and why I believe its worth owning. The storylines are complex not dull the camaraderie of the actors both onset and off makes the whole show what it is because you really feel it come through. SG1 does portray the USAF in a favorable light so much that it made R.D. Anderson was made an honorary Brig. General in real life. It took elements from the original movie and built on them making the Goa'ul more sinister and more complex. The struggle to defeat them throughout the movie and the strained relations along with endless challenges victories and defeats among the allies are so close to real life situations. I am amazed sometimes at the humor often dry as with Teal'c or the sarcastic wit of O'Neal and the two of them together are the perfect 'straight man funny man' act that has been used in many comic acts. StarGate SG1 has many good values to teach such as how people of different religions races and cultures can unite for a common good and make lasting friendships. As the viewer watches the episodes they will at times be keenly aware of the budget issues in making the episodes. Some shows are better than others. Some are silly some are more exciting than others. The special effects does get much better as the series goes. The battle in Antarctica was great all 15 seconds of it, again its all about budget. Ultimately, a lot is left up to the viewer's imagination so if that is where you the viewer is lacking you may not really get into StarGate or most Sci Fi for that matter.",1422489600,,1739,4.420560747663552

The actors were great. The show is funny. Its worth watching the first two seasons and some of the final ones. There is just way too many episodes to watch for a scifi. This is the best Stargate TV series. I just don't think any living person needs to own every episode. They rerun this show forever and I'd hope you've seen it already if you lived in the 00s. If you saw a couple seasons of this and you were already a Trek or BSG fan, this is more of the same thing. They are either kicking alien butt or trying to find an artifact to save somebody every time. Like Trek, the military and science parts can be sorta serious. This has a mythology which some scifi series do not have. Its an epic show, but not every episode was essential. There is just a ton of stuff here. It is better than the original Stargate movie when taken as a hole. I just can't see a human person watching every one of these episodes.",1421712000,,1081,4.201923076923077

As a result, a third of my DVDs in this box set are so scratched they're unusable. I love SG-1 and will probably replace this purchase at some point.

2904304,3,B000TJBNHQ,"This is a great series! But I am sure many other reviews can tell you that. The sound and picture quality is, well, variable, but is what can be expected considering when this series was produced. With that in mind, I've no problems with any of it. The on-disc content is great!

So let us talk about this Complete Series Collection set specifically.

The outer box is fantastic! If you have the shelf room for it, it has a wonderful presence to it. It is a rich golden color with embossed celestial patterns all over it, and then we have the Stargate! The gate itself is plastic and fully three dimensional, and the ""water"" effect inside is a clear plastic bubble under which is a lenticular plate to give it a nice multi-dimensional effect. Outstanding and very durable!

Alas, once you open the outer box, you find ugliness inside. Contained within are two giant cardboard inner boxes. Each box holds half of the discs in very tight cardboard sleeves which are quite likely to scratch your discs with repeated use. (Indeed, some other reviews here for this product have reported discs scratched upon receipt... So check your discs carefully when you get them!)

These boxes themselves have no information printed upon them about what is contained on the discs they hold. The set does have a nice booklet to do this job, however.

Still, who wants a giant boxed set that is likely to destroy the discs contained within? Well, the set IS salvageable! The outer box happens to be just big enough to hold 27 slim plastic DVD cases and the aforementioned booklet. The set contains 54 discs. 54  2 = 27, so if you can get your hands on 27 2-disc slim cases, you can transfer the discs to those and still hold them in the outer box. For my own use, I even designed cover art to put in to the cases. (Nothing too fancy, but looks nice enough and gets the job done.)

With this done, I love my set and find it to be excellent! If this was how the set came, I'd have no trouble giving it five stars. But with all of the extra work I had to put into it to make the set (with regards to how it stores the discs) practically functional, I have to knock a star off. And even though my discs are fine, knowing (from other reviews I have read) that it is possible that the packaging can damage the discs prior to when you receive it, and thus before you even have a chance to take steps to fix this yourself.... Well, that knocks off another star.

Frankly, if you don't care about the packaging so much, go for the individual seasons. Based on the prices I see at the time of this writing, the cost for the ten individual seasons is about the same if not much cheaper then the Complete Series Collection. But if you do want this awesome looking box on your shelf... go for it! Just be ready with those 27 replacement cases. And don't dawdle on checking the discs for faults. And make sure you either buy from Amazon itself, or from a reputable third party seller with a liberal exchange policy.",1412380800,,2982,4.399274047186933
2904305,4,B000TJBNHQ,"After buying this set in 2009, I've really enjoyed watching my favorite episodes over and over again. This year (2014), I've finally found time to watch all the commentaries too. I've discovered that my season 10 disk 4 is missing the audio commentary for the episode ""Bad Guys"". Very saddened by this - the dvd guidebook states that it is supposed to have the commentary. This is the only flaw that I've come across in my many years of watching episodes from this DVD box set. No skips, audio dropouts, missing closed captioning, etc - none of that. Yes, I've now developed light scratches on the disks because I chose not to put the disks into other sleeves (just left them in the original cardboard), but it hasn't affected the playback.",1411689600,,740,4.656488549618321

I wish it comes to Blu-ray like Atlantis which I have only dvd;s  not blue but I don't need blu because the copy's are clear. the sg-1 season thru season 5 years of sg1 could use upgrade to blu. every year the dvds get clear because of better filming.
I have 4 to 5 2 pack disk box in each season.
Mine are the snap in. at these price there is no reason to buy all 10 seasons in 1 box or the cheap 10 signal boxes on paper. look at what the store sells. they do not look like these on the cover.
I would have bought Atlantis blu if I new they where making it but the dvd's are not bad.

Sg-1 is the best  syfi show ever made.
when I do watch I start with the Blu-ray movie with kurt Russell in Blu-ray then the 10 seasons then the 2 after shows movies which contain is on blu. then I watch the 5 seasons of Atlantis.

2904341,4,B000TJBNHQ,"I love this series, and having all ten seasons in one package is great.  One of the longest running science fiction series (if not the longest), it lasted as long as it did because of the excellent ensemble cast (Richard Dean Anderson, Amanda Tapping, Michael Shanks, Christopher Judge, Don Davis, and later Corin Nemic, Ben Browder, Claudia Black and Beau Bridges augmenting or replacing those from the original ensemble), the strong, engaging writing, and (for television) surprisingly good special effects.  There's an extremely entertaining mixture of humor, drama and action, and the characters (both as written and as acted) play well off each other, in examples too numerous to mention in a brief review.  Suffice it to say I found the series entertaining and addictive.

The only fault I find in this product is the packaging of the discs.  As others have said, the discs are in cardboard sleeves, and will slide around in transit, no matter how well the collection is cushioned during shipment.  If you're going to buy the series in this single collection format, invest in a disc scratch remover (Skip Dr. has worked for me on the worst scratched disc I've found in the set so far).  A better option (and cheaper) is to buy each season individually.  Those discs should be in plastic cases with hubs to hold the discs firmly and keep them from sliding and getting scratched.",1408492800,,1384,4.884615384615385

Generally, to me, one of the apparent intentions of this series appears to have been an attempt to turn the viewer off from Christianity (and any of the untrue religions). The worship-demanding Goa'uld system lords, who successfully convert most who encounter them and must be killed, are a mimic of the Biblical God and Lord Jesus Christ. The viewer is to disbelieve the deity of Jesus and almightiness of God as just superior technological ability, and therefore unworthy of our full devotion. The unseen realm of ascension is a state (a mimic of Heaven) made up of a collective of the spirits of good and mature humanoids and races. (Anubis is an unworthy trespasser there, a mimic of Satan). Although God and the Lord Jesus can also be viewed as benefactors of ours through superior ability, the series (deliberately?) falls short in 3 vital points about God and Jesus: 1. When here, Jesus decidedly gave all just to simplify our understanding of how to be reunited with God. 2. Through submission to Jesus one receives a transformed spirit, far more valuable than Goa'uld assorted positive physical helps. 3. The realm we desire to ascend to, like all the universe, is (fortunately) controlled by an immeasurably more wise and powerful being (the Biblical God) rather than any collective of created little humanoids. Otherwise, the series was OK. Action: lots. Romance: fails. Believable situations: occasional but enough. Cool moments: OK and throughout. Watching every episode in order, it was difficult for me to keep up with all the now-and-then appearances of characters and activities, but I liked the series.

What I did was carefully remove them and put them into two 28-case holders things that also fit inside the box just fine! Still get to use the box and watch them with causing or risking any of the damage to the discs that people are talking about with this set! I watch them all the way through the set is perfect and has all everything, even special features like comic con panels! The box is beautiful and it is a great set for anyone who loves stargate.

The 8th season is so bad we can't watch any of the episodes and now it is too late to return. Why is Amazon using a vendor with such poor quality products and by the many reviews it is not just a one time glitch but a  pattern.

2904356,1,B000TJBNHQ,"As a fan of the Stargate Universe, I hated this product. I purchased this item Brand New from Amazon, and some of the disks that came in the set were marred by concentric rings of dirt and others were scratched outright. Some of the disks even glitched when I tried to watch them for the first time because they were damaged. To be clear, I received this Brand New product in this damaged condition and it has been like that since I got it. If it was only a problem of having some dirty disks, I might not give it such a horrendous review. However, the internal packaging for the disks is simply abysmal. Instead of having specific disk holders with the plastic button to release it from it's tray, the product utilizes cardboard half-sleeves that hold the disk halfway into the packaging. I have found this to be quite inferior to the plastic trays that you find in DVD cases and the actual layout of the interior packaging is quite egregious and confusing. It is meant to be laid out in a pseudo-book format where each ""page"" of the book has different disks, but the overall effect is to reduce the function and form of the final product.",1404172800,,1140,4.45933014354067

Amazon states, you can't return  movies that are opened, what if you discover the item is defective or damaged after you've opened it? This product should be removed completely.

If you are super careful with your DVDs and don't put it back in the cardboard packaging you might be ok.  The cardboard scratches the DVDs and you are lucky if you get it and it isn't already scratched.  Because of the way it is packaged and shipped most of the DVDs are scratched before you even open the package.  Mine was scratched so bad half of them didn't even play.  I've turned to buying each season separately and it is more expensive but worth not having half the series scratched and unplayable.  DO NOT BUY this collection.,1399593600,,622,4.4035087719298245

2904390,1,B000TJBNHQ,"Unfortunately, there is likely to be bad discs in this set. I ordered this item TWICE and returned it twice because in each set I found at least 4 bad discs. I stopped checking the discs after about season 3 or 4, so there were likely many more bad discs in the sets. In one set the ""cardboard disc holders"" were unglued and detached from the main ""book covers,"" which may indicate that the set was subjected to long term high heat. The design of the disc holders may have been at fault as well. There are 3 pockets to each sleeve holding 3 discs. Each pocket is made out of hard cardboard, which is not very forgiving to DVD discs. Oddly, it was usually the bottom disc on the sleeve that was bad, probably because more pressure was put in that spot due to the design. The set was made in 2009, so I guess it could be that the set is just too old. According to the National Archives ""CD/DVD experiential life expectancy is 2 to 5 years even though published life expectancies are often cited as 10 years, 25 years, or longer."" If you order this, check it for bad discs ASAP before your 30 day warranty/return policy expires.

The set itself looks like it was a nice compilation, though. There are special featurettes in about every other disc AND 4 additional discs of special features, and if I remember correctly audio commentary was included for every episode in seasons 4-10,  which is a really nice thing for die hard SG-1 fans (would be nice to have commentary for seasons 1-3 too, but oh well). The packaging is novel and interesting, although as stated above it may be a major contributing factor to the discs' degradation. Overall, this would have been a very nice set if the discs weren't bad. I'll probably end up purchasing the boring white and black cover, newer, individual season sets that have recently been published, but I'm also thinking about waiting until the 20's anniversary of the SG-1 series in 2017 to see if they come out with a special 20th Anniversary complete box set...",1396656000,,2001,4.509641873278237

2904425,4,B000TJBNHQ,"If so, here is how you do it!

But First, Why 4 Stars?
If you are a Stargate fan, you'll want this set. But you'll have to work for it. Because of this extra effort, I've dropped a star off this rating because Stargate fans shouldn't have to go through extra work to get the quality they deserve for the money this boxed set originally commanded. Shame on MGM and Sly-Fi for allowing this.

THE ULTIMATE STARGATE SG-1 BOXED SET!
The first thing to do, is wait until Christmas to get the best deal on this boxed set. Approximately 50% off! Then follow these steps:

1.)The way the manufacturer boxed these DVDs causes scratches and scuffs which will render at least a few of these DVD's unplayable. The only way to fix this is to call Amazon. They will ship you a new set and you'll need to return one of them. This way you can piece together a set with the least amount of damage. Pick the best DVD of the two sets. Watch the entire series to make sure every disc is ""indeed"" playable. Then send the set with all the worst DVD's back to Amazon. They are very good about this.
2.) You won't want to use the existing paper holders. So, once you have carefully and gently removed the DVD's from the paper holders, DON'T put them back after watching the DVD! You'll only scratch the DVDs further! I also suggest wiping them down from the center to outer edge in pie-wedge-swaths to remove the bits of cardboard dust stuck to the discs. Wipe gently with a microfiber cloth.
3.) Buy the by Mediaxpo for $16. It's here at Amazon. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Clear-8-Disc-DVD-Cases/dp/B002ROCII4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Clear 8 Disc DVD Cases</a>) Use seven of these DVD holders instead of the existing paper holders.  After doing the math, you will see that the series has 54 discs and my solution yields space for 56 discs. There is a reason for this: The two extra spots are reserved for ""The Ark of Truth,"" and ""Continuum"" at the very end of season ten! When you line seven of these 8-Disc cases next to each other they measure out to be exactly 18.9 cm wide. This leaves just enough room in the box for the booklet that came with the set. You get to keep the box and everything will be snug! Throw the original paper DVD holders away. They are garbage! If you are good at scanning, and have a good color printer you can make seven covers that will fit each of these 8-Disc cases. There are plenty of stunning SG-1 graphics online. I suggest labeling the spines of each case (on the paper insert you've just created, not the case silly) with the discs each case contains. Voil! You now have eliminated the scratches, protected the series, and personalized it exactly the way you like it. This is what SHOULD have been done when this boxed set was created. You will have three 8-Disc DVD holders left over to use or sell. For the price, it's very little waste, VERY complete, and VERY compact.
4.)Lastly. If you already own the complete series pieced together through buying each season separately, then you may not wish to go through the above work. However, for sake of reclaiming several feet of movie shelf storage space, I highly recommend it! The only thing you will forgo by following step three will be: giving up the snazzy box, the four feature DVD set, and booklet that came with this boxed set. The four feature DVDs are nice but not mind blowing. Once you've watched them, you'll never watch them again nor, will you likely use the book.

So, there you have it! The opinion and experience of someone who owns the original Stargate DVD, all of the individual Stargate SG-1 series, the SG-1 Complete Boxed Set, ""The Ark of Truth,"" and ""Continuum."" I also own the ""Stargate Atlantis"" Blu-Ray set which has none of these issues. ""Stargate Universe"" was too disappointing to own, so I have no comments there.

2904441,5,B000TJBNHQ,"Watched the movie with my son recently and he was excited to hear there was a TV series made after the movie. I had watched the TV series off and on during the 2000's on SciFi (sorry, SyFy) channel and knew it would be great to connect with the show again, and would be interesting to see it with my 16 year old son. So I figure I'd sign up for Netflix and watch the series on my new smart HDTV. But Netflix dropped SG-1 last August. The only way to see it is video on demand on either VuDu or Amazon. At $1.99 an episode, that could get expensive. We did pay to watch some episodes while waiting for the boxed set to arrive. I made sure we saw Children of the Gods The Final Cut (which DOES NOT contain the nude scene) rather than watch the version in the boxed set.

I bought the entire 10 season set here on Amazon for less than $100. 214 episodes plus bonus material, for a total of 54 DVD discs. That is an outstanding value. I was leery of buying with all the reports of scratched discs, but I went ahead and bought it anyway. I figured after I got the set I could inspect for disc scratching and decide if I needed to return the set or keep it. I also bought a set of 100 paper CD/DVD sleeves for $1.99 and had my microcloth ready.

Turns out I got 9 discs with scuff marks on them. They are not scratches in the classic sense of looking like a sharply defined scratch line, rather they are circular scuff or rub marks (see photo.) They appeared to happen most frequently on the discs stored in the bottom-most cardboard slots in the packaging. The microcloth didn't have any effect on the scratches but I figured with ""only"" 9 scuffed discs, if they wouldn't play properly I could always have the scuff marks polished out. I've played two of the discs with scuff marks on them through my son's PS3 and they play perfectly! So I think I got lucky on the defective disc issue. All my discs are now stored in paper sleeves.

Because I have played discs from S1, S4, and S6 I have noted some differences. The picture quality in the later seasons is much better. I'm watching this on a 55"" HDTV so the upconverted picture is a little bit grainy. Also, I noticed that S4 and S6 episodes have 5.1 channel sound whereas S1 did not. Note: I have to turn the volume up on my stereo higher to properly hear the audio on these DVD's than I do with other video material.

This is a great TV series and I plan on enjoying my boxed set for months and months to come.",1390780800,4,2459,4.170526315789473

I was meant to see your ad and I did not hesitate to take advantage of the offer - it wasn't posted for too long, but I got in and am overjoyed with the best Sci-Fi series ever made!!! I hope it will be rebroadcast, in the not too distant future, on cable. Commercials (plot - killers) ruin everyone's enjoyment of a program. Put in a good word.

2904444,1,B000TJBNHQ,Every single disk has scratches and smudges on it. And this is the second set. The first one had one disk that was totally scratched up. Very disappointed!,1390521600,3,155,4.571428571428571
2904445,5,B000TJBNHQ,"Sometimes an item is so good that you just have to give it five stars, regardless of whether it has a couple of little quirks. ""Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection"" is one of those.

As one of the longest-running, most-highly-regarded science fiction television shows ever, ""Stargate SG-1"" surely warrants a high rating based on quality alone. I don't now (and never did) have cable television, so I missed the show when it originally aired on Showtime and the Sci-Fi channel. My local CBS over-the-air broadcast affiliate Channel 4.2 (ThisTV) now shows two episodes back-to-back every Sunday evening. They've just started through the whole 10-season series for the second time, and I rarely miss an episode. But how long it will be before its yanked from the airwaves is anybody's guess. So picking up this DVD set was a no-brainer for me.

With that said, let me address two issues that show up pretty often in other reviews and in the forums for this set, namely: 1) scratched disks, and 2) nudity in the pilot episode.

Based on other reviews, I inspected all 54 disks in the set as soon as I got it. As many reviewers note, the packaging technique of shoving each disk down into an individual little slot in the thin accordion-fold cardboard gizmo is not the best. Some of the disks I looked at have--well, I wouldn't call them ""scratches,"" exactly; they're more like ""scuffs"" or ""abrasions"" where they've rubbed up against the edge of the slot. About a third of the disks have some kind of marks on them. It looks like relatively minor damage--it's nothing like the gouged, scratched, smudged and smeared disks that I sometimes get from the public library. Some of those disks DO skip or hang up in my player. But the damage on them is much more severe than the marks on the Stargate disks. It'll take me months or years to work my way through all the seasons of Stargate, so I can't report at this time whether any of the scuffed disks don't play properly. But it doesn't look like the marks are bad enough to matter, at least based on a visual inspection.

Okay, on to the nudity in the pilot episode ""Children of the Gods."" There are, it's true, a few lingering shots of (GASP!) bare female BREASTS, and even a momentary glimpse of pubic hair (Oh, the HUMANITY!), in this episode. So what? There are also MANY scenes of people being shot, wounded and killed, with blood flowing from their wounds, and mayhem and carnage on a large scale. I'm not (quite) anal enough to count how many dead bodies pile up in this episode, but it's not a small number. So, if you're going to object to this episode's content, why not do so based on the violence, not on a little tasteful nudity? In my opinion, there's something fundamentally, disturbingly wrong with a value system that regards cinematic depictions of the most depraved acts of violence as ""suitable for all ages,"" while images of the human body are considered disgusting and evil. Every person on earth has nipples. What's the big deal?

Okay, now that that's off my chest (which has two nipples, one on the right side and one on the left), let me heartily and enthusiastically recommend ""Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection."" With all 200+ episodes, a nice episode guide booklet and four disks full of special features, this set is a must-have for every fan of the series.",1390521600,,3352,4.684210526315789

2904460,1,B000TJBNHQ,"I know some people get good sets while others get boxes with some or most disks damaged.  I bought a factory set on ebay and one after another I played disks that could not be read, either partially or completely.  Close inspection of the disks shows that there are many scratches and gouges in the media so severe that they could not have all been caused by friction against the cardboard slip cases.  In some cases, almost whole seasons are unplayable.  A further annoyance is that I require Closed Captioning to understand much of the dialog, and while CC is there, the disks generally have to be played through the analog output of DVD players unless you buy one that outputs the analog CC on the HDMI output, and not a lot of players do that.  So, I also have to put up with really inferior video to get CC.  This set is a disaster and I believe it is not only a result of bad packaging, but many disks are damaged beyond what can be explained by the packaging, so I believe the manufacturer's quality control is very lacking.  There are very few options for getting SG-1.  VUDU sells the first 4 seasons, but it's expensive at low definition ($19.99 per season) and the other seasons are no longer available.  I never watched the series when it first aired, and I subscribe to Netflix where I started watching it, but I got about halfway through the series when their dispute with STARZ ended their relationship ... in mid episode, so I was stuck.

2904513,5,B000TJBNHQ,"I waited four years before buying this set due to the reviews of the bad packaging and disc damage. I decided to buy it when the price was $60, a deal I felt was worth the risk. True to the reviews, when I received it there were discs not properly stored in the packaging sleeves and were loose and free in the folded inlay (one of two). They were scratched, but so were some of the discs that were not loose.

I am happy to report I am about a third of the way through the series and the scratched discs did not affect the play - that is they played fine, except for one disc. This disc did not have any noticeable scratches but did not properly play in my bluray player (Sony BDP S3100). One episode seemed to cause issues where the player would get stuck. The episode (Crossroads, season 4, episode 4) did not play even after cleaning the disc and reinserting multiple times. It did manage to play on my computer though.

Now that the disc issue is cleared up, I can briefly discuss the show. I did not watch the series when it was on Showtime. I did watch and really enjoyed the movie though (I remember seeing the movie in theaters and was blown away by the ""Stargate effect"" when they first travel through the Stargate). It took some time to get used to Richard Dean Anderson as O'Neill, who plays the character with much more sarcasm and humor than Russell's version, and Michael Shanks as Dr. Jackson. I like the additions of Samantha Carter and Teal'C, although he seems a lot like a vulcan wanna-be most of time. I am half way through season 4 and am thoroughly enjoying the series. I own and have watched the whole Star Trek Universe (Original, Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise) and would rate it below Next Gen and Deep Space and ahead or on par with the others.

I am hoping to watch the whole series within the 30 day return timeframe, so if any issues arise with the discs, I can return them and get new ones. 30 days is not a enough time to watch 10 seasons! In short, I'd give it 1 star for the packaging and 5 stars for the actual show. If you can get the series on a deal (I usually see it for $100, and occasionally for $60), it is probably worth the risk.",1388102400,,2201,4.260765550239235

2904527,4,B000TJBNHQ,"POST-PURCHASE of the SG-1 COLLECTION:
Regarding all the complaints and negative reviews, which are ALL related to the disk packaging; I do admit the packaging of the box set itself could be a little better, maybe with some sort of DVD spindle with the Gate at the TOP of it would look quite nice. In fact, I may even attempt to whip me up a cool DIY spindle case for this set myself! I love the awesome Stargate sticking out of the front of the box, with a 3-D 'horizon' in the center, very detailed. The box itself is very thick and sturdy, with raised star-chart-like symbols that blend into a metallic bronze/gold background. The accordion-style inner packaging is what leaves much to be desired, and is the source of the problems with the disks. I think they should have stuck to slim plastic cases, or at the very least, individual sleeves. Still, I am a devoted enough fan of this show, and am not willing to just give up and send it back.

If you are much of a collector of DVD sets, you might know that you are able to purchase SINGLE DISKS on eBay. Individual, original disks that were split up from a season set, and sold as replacements, usually in a sleeve or slim plastic CD case, with no artwork, and can cost from $.99 to $4 or so each. I figured that because the entire boxed set here was on sale recently, and my purchase total was only $65, paying a few extra bucks for the replacement disk(s) is not that big of a deal.
I was very lucky in that so far I believe only ONE of the disks in my set is unplayable. I did not find the severity of damage that many reviews speak of. I noticed most bad reviews are several years old, so maybe the production quality of the disks has gone up some. I did see some very light scuff marks on a few of the disks, but they seemed to function and play fine. I did browse each disk briefly after opening the set, to make sure I did not get a 'lemon' of a set with many damaged disks. ONE disk of the set (Season 5, Disk 4) didn't appear to have damage, but did not play properly. I am currently on an extended ""Binge-Watch"" of the entire series, and am in the middle of season 2. So far, all disks have played through without major issues. The only thing I did notice was that on 2 or 3 episodes so far, selecting the episode from the list on the menu causes it to play the previous episode. I had to select the desired episode's 'Scene Selection' button, and then start from the first scene to get it to play the correct episode. A little frustrating, but not a deal-breaker.

MY RESOLUTION: I plan to purchase the one disk that has malfunctioned, so I can have the complete set. I also am working on putting each disk into a sleeve of its own, with a label on the sleeve to indicate the disk number, so that when they are inserted and removed from the triple-stacked cardboard fold-out packaging, they will not be scuffed or scratched any further. Another possible idea, for those who do not want to use sleeves, is to get a thin piece of felt, flannel, or other soft material that will not scratch the disk, and cut a piece to fit into the back of each triple-stacked pocket in the box, and glue or tape them into place, so placing and removing the disk from the pocket will not cause the back to rub against the rough cardboard.

BOTTOM LINE: If you are a fan of SG-1 already, and have not had the pleasure of seeing ALL episodes, or of owning the set yourself, this is still a not-to-be-missed deal. (Currently running at only $80.) If the set you receive has more than 3 or 4 un-playable disks, then I do recommend exchanging the set and taking another 'chance' with the next one. If you have only a few disks damaged, then I would highly suggest trying to find replacement disks for those on eBay. With 4 Disks packed with 'Special Features', most (if not all) of which are previously released, it seems you not only have a full collection of SG-1 episodes, but a treasure trove of interviews, explanatory featurettes that reveal more in-depth info for the episodes that seemed to be ""missing something"" (as in 'Solitudes' from Season 1), and connect the SG-1 series to it's spin-off 'Stargate: Atlantis' series. Also included are outtakes/bloopers, Directors episodes, 'Video Diaries' by the cast members, detailed featurettes explaining the science, science-fiction, and physics of how the Stargate works (among other things.) Behind the Scenes videos for many episodes and revealing documentary shorts with the main cast showing how they traverse the popular conventions full of fans who are eager to meet them, and LOTS more. This is much more than an episode collection, it has most, if not all, of the TV spots, video interviews, and featurettes that were released previously for the series, all in one nice little DVD set.
I give the set a 9/10 for the amazing Budget Price, and an 8/10 for Disk Content, but only a 5/10 for Packaging. Fortunately, Amazon is very good about allowing returns and exchanges.",1388016000,,4972,4.4675467546754675

2904532,4,B000TJBNHQ,"I just received this today after getting it for the deal of the week. I decided to post my first review of the packaging because of all the comments towards it. When I received the package in the mail all that was in the box was this set, the Stargate: Atlantis complete series and two air bubble wraps to try and keep it in place. There was quite a bit of space in the box, so naturally I was worried because of all the comments about the packaging.

When you first set eyes on the package the first thing you notice is how large it is! If you wanted this as a centerpiece for a collection I guess it would fit the bill because it does take up quite a bit of space.

Upon opening the box you see that the way the packaging is set up is just a cardboard piece that folds back and forth with dvd's on both sites of the folds. There will be two of these with an episode guide inbetween. The actual dvd's themselves sit inside little pockets with nothing other than the pocket just being tight to hold it in. What you're probably thinking is I will say the dvd's were all destroyed, but they actually weren't.

IMPORTANT: The dvd's do have scratches on them, however they are all the thin and do not go deep into the disc. Some go along the image lines so-to-speak, and some go vertical as in from the center towards the edge of the disc. I would say probably 70% of the discs had at least some form of scratches. There were only about five that concerned me from looking at them. When I put them into my dvd player they all worked perfectly fine. So what it really comes down to in my opinion is how much you care about scratches. If you don't mind scratches as long as everything works correctly, then this set is well worth the money, especially on this deal of the week. I know some people can not stand the scratching even if the disc works fine, and for those people I would definitely say to get individual seasons instead.",1386720000,,1927,4.2168021680216805
2904533,1,B000TJBNHQ,"well, after reading all the reviews regarding poor packaging of this box set I decided to go ahead and give it a try. I literally received my package not even 15 minutes ago, and first thing I did was check the disks and wow. This is definitely a problem with the packaging itself, every single disc I pull out is badly scratched, some have deep scratches going all the around the disk. How do they think they can get away with this?  Luckily I also ordered Stargate Atlantis so I have that to tide me over until I get this resolved. What a disappointment, I am really not looking forward to having to send this back and get a replacement, of course I might just get a refund, why risk it? This is a big let down, and completely unacceptable. I am going to start the return process now! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT

I started watching this about 3 months ago, I go through 1 or 2 disks a week. I had a couple skip, not bad and ignored it, last week I had not much to do and went through 5 disks, 4 were bad, I had to skip 1 episode on two disks and 2 disks started skipping around really bad, paused then locked up my player. I have 3 Blu Ray players, a top of the line Sony and 2 Panasonics. Almost the same results on all three. I believe some of minor skipping has to do with the case the disks are in. The case looks nice but taking them out seems to put small scratched of some, maybe dirt in the pouches. The disks where the episodes would not play at all looked good, no scratches, no dust, nothing, they had to be made that way. My point is when you buy a series this long a 30 day return policy sucks.

As when i got a new set and tried to compare discs to get ones that were less scratched and the third set I still had scratched discs and gave up.

2904554,4,B000TJBNHQ,"This is a review of the DVD Boxset since the Blu-ray isn't available yet.

I agree with the majority with the packaging but I put all my DVDs and Blu-rays in CD albums so this is basically a none issue for me. I did check all the discs for scratches and gouges and found none. The only problem was some of the dics were duplicates and I immediately notified Amazon and they I immediately provided me with the shipping labels to return this purchase. The replacement had all the discs, there was no damage, and they all play perfectly. That was about four years ago.

Recently I've upgraded to an HD TV and Blu-ray and the DVDs play just fine on those machines. The earlier seasons do show a bit of grain but is still better than being played through my DVD player. The later seasons were apparently filmed in HD or at least some kind of digital format because they are much clearer/sharper than the earlier seasons but not quite blu-ray quality but I'm not complaning just stating opinion based on empirical evidence.

The 4-star rating is as close to perfect that I can honestly give since the play all feature wasn't added until Season 9. If the Blu-ray version has play all with all the discs and updated special features menus along with additional features then it will be 5-stars without a problem.

The review for the entire series would be 4-star at most due to various personal preferences I would have taken if I were the producer. For the most part the suspension of disbelief hit the mark but from a military standpoint I take serious issue with the various childish behavior potrayed every now and then by these elite special forces units which is due from the various writers with no military experience getting a stronghold on various scripts; fortunately they were few and far between.

Also it was very fortunate that the series wasn't bogged down in endless technobabble (I do admit there was some but not a lot) of trying to explain everything like another very popular TV show did for almost 25 seasons. I did enjoy how most if not all mythologies were woven together to tell this very appealing story.",1384732800,,2122,4.603174603174603

Second, this was a compromise purchase since the cost was prohibitive to buy the seasons separately to get those in HD on BD.

They may have changed it by the time I got mine because the disks were were not flopping and scraping together as previous reviewers wrote but were firmly held in individual pockets in two accordion fold-outs - so firmly that I scratched the first and most important disk trying to extract it. I eventually discovered too late that squeezing the pocket at the tab-like edges would cause it to release its vice grip. Some instructions would have been very helpful beyond a warning of a undefined problem. Adding insult to injury, the first disk is out of balance causing my players to hum and/or shake mechanically. Two of my five players were not able to mount it including my primary BD player. The old clunker DVD-only players worked best, probably because they are speed limited and shook less.

But so far, only one disc (number 30 something) wouldn't play at first and I had to wipe it each time I put it in my player. Oddly enough, the disc was one that didn't get scratched at all when taking out of packaging, so go figure.

Both sets I tried had 4 bad discs each where they would start to play and then crash mid-episode, and of those 4 bad discs there was a 3 disc overlap (where the disc was bad in both sets). I'm not sure if these are just low quality DVDs or if it's because of the fact that they come in very scratch prone cardstock sleeves, or a combination of both, but the discs were consistently damaged.

If you do buy this, make sure to thoroughly check every DVD, as well as immediately move all the DVDs into a proper holder that won't damage the discs that do end up working. Simply putting the DVD in the player and hitting play is NOT a good enough test, as all 4 of the bad DVDs worked for that but then crashed while we were in the middle of watching the episodes. The quickest test is if you have a DVD ripper is to attempt to copy the DVDs to your hard drive, as it should spit out an error as soon as it hits a sector it can't read.",1378857600,,1215,3.919028340080972

Let's start with the case.  It doesn't fit with the rest of my DVDs and has a cumbersome plastic ""stargate"" on the front.  The top pops off to reveal 2 folded holders that carry all the DVDs.  However these holders are simply half envelopes, nothing else.  The DVDs can slide around on the inside or turn, causing scratches and wear.  A simple plastic holder for the center of the discs (similar to the SG Atlantis package) would have solved A LOT of problems.

2904684,3,B000TJBNHQ,"Love Stargate SG-1. Perfect blend of Science, Action and humor. Great cast that work well together. The acting is top shelf and the stories usually engaging.

My reason for 3 stars. The packaging for this series frankly sucks. The external case is ok. The sleeves that the disks are kept in are a totally garbage design. They're made from cardboard which means the disks can get scratched easily taking them out and putting them back. Fox who distributes and manufactures these disks for MGM should be ashamed of the quality of the product.

Their manufacturing quality control is non existent I'd say. Quite a few of the disks look like they're heavily scratched and upon closer inspection you see that those are actually on the internal part of the disk on the recording media not the outer external surface. That's just sloppy , poor workmanship. I had amazon send me a replacement set so that between two sets I could get one good one and I actually came close. I swapped out a total of six disks that would not play on either my PC or my Sony BD player. I actually have a 7th disk that only partly plays before locking up from the ""good"" set and the same disk from the other set won't play at all.  I sent the original set back for a refund.

If I didn't love SG-1 so much I'd just send the second set back for a refund because the workmanship is so lousy. Fox should or MGM should make Fox remaster all the DVD sets of this wonderful series.

So to sum up.....  Fantastic Sci Fi series with great sories, acting and effects.

 Crappy workmanship on the DVD media by Fox on behalf of MGM. Caveat Emptor.....",1377561600,,1612,4.440677966101695

The first set I received had scratches on roughly 75% of the disks. I did not even try to play them because there are 54 disks in this collection. I cannot watch 54 disks in the 30 day return window. I contacted Amazon and was told to contact Warner Brothers. I contacted Warner Brothers and they said to contact Amazon. WB said that they would send me a new set, BUT I had to send them my set on my dime. I was not going to pay for something that was not my fault. So I ordered another set from Amazon, swapped out all the bad disks with good ones from the second set, and returned the bad set. That sounds like a lot of hassle, but if you really want the collection, and the cool Stargate box, it is worth it. I would suggest purchasing a CD/DVD case to put your disks in.

We are now planning to purchase the ""Atlantis"" series to feed our addiction when we finally do finish this set.  We found a couple DVD's had flaws so bad the episode where the flaw was could not be viewed.  After contacting Amazon two months after purchasing, Amazon only allows 30 days to return (patently rediculous with a huge boxed set like this), we contacted the seller and were pleasently surprised to find they were very generous and replaced the set without any hassle at all.

The series collection is very nice and as others have said there is some minor scratching evident on a few of the discs.  This is most likely due to the way they are packaged.  The sleeves in which the disc appears to be the cause of the scratches, as some of the discs must rub a bit during transit, causing the scratches.  I haven't checked these discs yet to find out if this is a problem, but I am sure Amazon will exchange them is a disc is not working.  I have a buffer device that can buff out the scratches as they are minor, so I am not too worried about them.

I do like this series and how it took a very well done movie and explored how deep a series can come from this. the story lines are well done and has very few weak episodes....

Watching Richard Dean Anderson and his witty remarks never seem to get old. The characters blend and the character-specific episodes are not bad either.

Again, the design for the box set comes in two separate box sets encased within one box. I for one, cannot find anything wrong with this at all....very good pick up for the price.",1374883200,,946,4.158469945355192

Re-edit (changed from one star to three.  This IS an awesome show):  Amazon was great about sending a replacement.  (Honestly they even sent it before I sent back the old set.  This allowed me to not only double check that the new set was good and unscratched - which it was perfectly fine - but I could have swapped out good discs from either set to make a whole undamaged set.  If you buy this be sure to check ALL discs.)",1374883200,,668,4.288
2904756,4,B000TJBNHQ,"I am so happy with this set EXCEPT for the folder that it came in. I knew to be prepared to switch it out of that as soon as it arrived. Several of the discs had scratches, but pulling them carefully out of the OEM case and placing them in a zipper case has hopefully stopped any further damage.

I would NOT recommend storing these discs in the case they came in!!
I was able to put the remastered pilot (watch that version instead of the version on this set!), and all the DVDs from the movies into one secure case and now I can enjoy my favorite sci-fi show of all time any time I want.

About the series as a whole, definitely buy the director's cut of Children of the Gods (the pilot) instead of watching the studio induced dreck that is on this set, and make sure to check out the special features especially the audio commentaries.
The best commentaries by far are Peter Deluise.  He is beyond great.  But make sure to check out the commentaries because this is a rare show that has commentary on EVERY episode starting on (I think) season 4, including silliness like the 'lyrics' to the stargate theme song and various inside jokes.

I ordered the Stargate SG-1 Complete Series (a new set.... not a used one) after reading the reviews that warned people to avoid this box set due to severe scratching of the discs. I thought to myself, ""Oh, how bad could it be?"" Well... I found out.

Upon opening the box, I discovered LOOSE DVDs FALLING OUT OF THE FOLDER SLEEVES and after looking at all of the DVDs (those that fell out of the sleeves and those that were still held in place) I found that EVERY SINGLE DISC WAS SCRATCHED to varying degrees.

Don't make the same mistake I made. The packaging on this box set is TERRIBLE! If you're wanting this series (and it is a good one), do yourself a favor and get the individual seasons. The packaging is much stronger and the DVDs will be less likely to be scratched.

To sum it up..... AVOID THIS BOX SET! The packaging is terrible, and the discs will almost certainly be scratched up.",1373068800,,1011,4.367021276595745

After inspection, I found the disk was scratched. I then noticed that a small piece of plastic was at the bottom of the cardboard sleeve. This had to have happened at the manufacturer as the only place the plastic bit could have come from was a disk and all of mine were fine (other than scratches). There were a few more disks that had scratches and wouldn't play. I've since been able to replace a couple of the disks but each time I watch the series, a different disk turn up scratched. This has to be due to the cardboard packaging in this set. The disks are packed tight into the sleeves so inserting and removing the disks tend to lead to scratches. The cardboard doesn't protect the disks in any way. I have other box sets that use plastic cases to secure the disks better and are still working fine even after several viewings. This box with this set looks really cool but it's no good if you can't watch the episodes. I love this series but I highly recommend getting the individual seasons because the packaging tons better and in the event a couple of disks get scratched, it would be much easier to replace.",1372809600,,1282,4.413502109704641

I have been a huge stargate fan since the movie came out in 1994.  I watched the first of this series with a bit of skepticism and quickly was hooked by Richard Dean Anderson's portrayal of Jack O'Neill.
after the 10 season run it has become my comfort sci fi",1372550400,,272,4.211538461538462

But, like others before me, I was not terribly impressed by the heavy paper sleeves that held the discs. They have a very tight hold on the discs, making it difficult to extract them. But I can see why the manufacturer opted for this design. With so many discs it must have been difficult to come up with a compact, lightweight and economical method for packaging the entire collection. So, I went to our local Target and purchased enough plastic disc holders to accommodate the entire collection. Then I found a shoe box and set them all inside of it. Works great.",1372291200,4,691,4.617886178861789

But a while back I saw an excellent episode and looked into the series again. After that I decided to get the whole she-bang and I've been watching it like a zombie ever since. I finished the last disk after about 5 weeks of non-stop watching.

It was an unusual experience to watch the 10 years go by in 5 weeks!

I'm glad I gave the series a second chance and I really enjoyed the spirit of the writers and actors.

I did not experience any bad disks and I did remove them carefully, so I don't think you have much to fear about the packaging.

2904813,4,B000TJBNHQ,"Before saying anything else, there is one inescapable issue with this set, and it is well-documented through other reviews: This is, without a doubt, the worst packaging of any series I've ever encountered. The outer box is attractive, and it looks great on my shelf, but that's the only positive thing I can say. You can't just open it like a normal box; you have to lift the entire thing off the base, so it's inconvenient to do that every time you want to access a disc. Once open, that's when the real horror is revealed. The discs are held in the worst possible way, as though the designers were trying to ruin discs and make it as horrible for the user as possible. It's so bad that Amazon added a warning about it in bold print near the price listings. It's simply an embarrassment. I was lucky, though: Taking the advice of another reviewer, I purchased some disc-sleeves and carefully placed each disc in one, inspecting them for scratches as I went. Fortunately - miraculously - nothing got scratched, and I was able to watch the series without technical difficulties. So, if you do get this set, keep in mind that you'll have this issue to contend with. For me, I took the risk, payed a little bit extra for sleeves, and it paid off. I got a great deal on a tremendous series. For others, the packaging led to damaged goods, and it was not worth their troubles.

Some more background on my perspective: Before purchasing this set, I'd never seen an episode of the show. In fact, I'd avoided it. Catching glimpses of it here and there, it never looked very good to me. I had seen the original film, though, and after years of watching Star Trek, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, and other shows, I wanted to try something different, and I figured a show that ran for ten seasons must be better than I'd given it credit for in the past. Also, I am a huge Farscape fan. When I heard that Ben Browder and Claudia Black were on the last two seasons, I was sure that I needed to see this show.

All that said, I reach the first point I'd like to make: Stargate SG-1, in my view, is two different shows. The first one ran for eight seasons. The second, after an unexpected renewal by the network, ran for two. Both are excellent, but they are clearly distinct from each other. The most obvious aspect is that Richard Dean Anderson left the show after the eighth season, and he was the first among equals when it came to the starring cast, even if his role was limited during particularly the seventh season. The other is that they wrapped up the main storylines at the end of the eighth season, not anticipating a ninth or tenth. New story arcs came about to go along with the updated cast, so it has the feel of a spin-off at least as much as a continuation.

I watched SG-1 just about every night for eight months. I would watch one episode a night, in general, occasionally watching two or skipping a night for various reasons. Going through ten seasons, it never got old. Not every episode was a masterpiece, but few were really bad. Most ranged from good to outstanding.

I love that they don't recreate the original movie. Instead, they go a year into the future, recast the two lead roles, and take things from there. It's a great way to get a running start in the series premiere. (Notably, there's a scene with full-frontal nudity in the first episode, but you can get the revised ""Children of the Gods"" on a separate DVD. There's even a set with that and the two post-finale movies that were made.)

Every science-fiction show has some hurdles to contend with. The main one, by far, is the Star Trek comparison. You simply cannot make a sci-fi show and not have it compared to the various incarnations of Star Trek. It set the template, so now shows have to either accept certain conventions or make choices to differentiate their own creation. Farscape, for example, had the concepts of a living ship and bacteria that acted as the ""universal translator."" Stargate SG-1 has the original movie giving it its foundation, but to become a series it had to do adopt some television conventions. In many ways, I do think Stargate is derivative, pulling influences from other sci-fi programs, but they always have a nice twist to make it fit well to this individual series. The stargate itself is a network of wormholes, which we'd seen in Deep Space 9 and Babylon 5; the rings are a new take on the transporter; the zat guns are a particular type of phaser. Add into the mix the occasional actor known for roles on Star Trek, and I think SG-1 reveals that it's aware of its influences and embraces the plethora of science fiction that came before.

It helps immensely that the show has so much humor and a great set of lead actors. I didn't particularly care for Teryl Rothery as Dr. Fraser, and Don S. Davis' General Hammond too often did little more than say, ""you have a go,"" but they were typically peripheral to the adventures of the SG-1 team, and each certainly had their moments over the years. Richard Dean Anderson brought a ton of charisma and humor to the show. It took me a little while to stop seeing him as MacGyver, but eventually I was able to embrace him wholly as Jack O'Neal. Michael Shanks also managed to make the role of Daniel Jackson his own. Characters that hadn't been in the original movie, Amanda Tapping as Samantha Carter and Christopher Judge as Teal'c, also become deep and interesting as the series progresses. Corin Nemec did well in his one season as Quinn. It's too bad they didn't find a way to keep him involved. I also found the additions of Ben Browder and Claudia Black to be a great way to inject some interesting new energy and ideas into the final two seasons.

Also key to the show's success was its rotation of guest stars, particularly Tony Amendola and Carmen Agenziano. Many of the one-off guest stars were only so-so, but SG-1 had a great set of recurring characters that would show up once in a while to help out or make trouble, like Ronny Cox's Senator Kinsey and Tom McBeath's Harry Maybourne.

As with Babylon 5, Stargate SG-1 dealt with trouble both ""off-world"" and at home. I never found the Earthbound political issues as compelling as the adventures on the other side of the stargate, but it was great that the show was willing to call into question the motives and occasional hypocrisy of our own government. Also like B5, there seemed to be a focus on the Americans and Russians without much, if any, mention of other Earth cultures. It fits with the notion of which countries were involved with the space race, but sometimes I wondered why the show never touched on those modern cultures, especially since it dealt so heavily with ancient cultures and religions.

And that's another aspect Stargate did so well: using ancient religious beliefs and mythologies to drive storylines. It's very secular viewpoint clashed against the ""false gods"" that abound in our history and (in the universe of the show) were really just powerful aliens playing gods. Occasionally, it veered into the realm of straw man arguments against believing in false gods, but generally this was avoided, as fighting these aliens was so central to the overall plot of the series.

So, this set gets four stars from me. I have to deduct one star due to the egregious packaging flaw (though, if the discs arrive without scratches, you can get past it by investing a few extra bucks in disc sleeves, which you can then store in the box). Other than the packaging issue, the series itself deserves five stars for sure. It's got action, wonder, intriguing ideas, and, most of all, characters that are worth spending ten long seasons with. I'm happy to add it to my list of must-see sci-fi series along with Star Trek, TNG, DS9, B5, Battlestar Galactica, and Farscape.",1370995200,19,7806,4.585243553008596

I immediately took all the discs out and stored them in a CD wallet instead.

I've been reviewing the discs and have so far found no defects or any problems with playing the episodes. Fingers crossed that I won't find any problems in the future. I have only currently watched through to Season 7. I will update this review later if I find any problems or issues.

Ignoring the buyer warnings, I bought this and upon receipt I immedaitely inspected each disk for scratches and warping. Amoung the 50+ disks, I found two that showed signs of some scratches, and when watching those disks, there were breif moments of freezing on a single episode from each, but nothing detrimental to the entire disk.

I suggest that you do as I did above. Don't wait to review the each episode when you watch it, take 10 minutes and go through all the disks and decide if they are accptable upon receipt of the package. This way you don't go beyond the return deadline (even watching a full disk each day it would take you almost two months to compelte the box set).

As for the series, what can I say... its SG1! It is simply one of the best SciFi programs ever. I typically go through the series once every other year, and it takes me upwards of four months to do so. Love it!",1365724800,2,1097,4.367647058823529

Seems a design flaw in packaging/product.  In addition, many of the DVDs were scuffed apparently while loading them into packaging during manufacture.  The DVDs container makes it difficult to take DVDs in & out without scuffing them.  The first purchase had over 10 DVDs which hung, skipped, &/or picture broke apart.  After discovering 5 bad DVDs in the second purchase, I gave up & returned the product.  I did not review all of the DVDs so there could easily be more problems.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.

If I try purchasing this complete series collection again, I'll buy at a local retail store for ease of return.  A better option may be to purchase each season of this series separately depending on packaging.

My only complaint is not against the product, but against the shipping from Amazon! Miserable experience with lasership. Am hoping they will stop using them. With their delivery ""claims"" and ""accidental address mixups"", I am hesitant to order directly from them again.

The replacement set looks even worse than the 1st set and now I don't have time to view them the same way to see if they are worth keeping. The way they are packaged promotes damamge during shipping.

2904952,3,B000TJBNHQ,"first let me just say this, which is why I only gave it a 3 rating.

I just found out that this was being sold as a blu ray item as well and for a cheaper price. Ugh..and I spent 73 on this version. This makes my soul cry. But anyways, onto the review.

This includes two dvd boolets that hold all the dvds of the series in the two books. I think its more like 5 seasons in one and 5 seasons in the other. Separated by a little booklet you can read about the series. What gets me about the book that you can read that comes with it, is that it has the cast on the first cover of the book, and richard dean anderson is NOT in the picture. I mean I know he left the show for personal reason at the end of what season 9 or 10?! But seriously?! You couldn't let him appear with the cast on the booklet? Wow low move sirs.

Now I have a friend with this same box set, which is one reason I spent some time trying to find a good deal on this one myself. She told me herself that the lil dvd holders that hold the disc are made of cardboard and have in fact scracted her disc from being put in and taken out as much as she watches the series. Looking at the actual set up of the dvd disc holders, I can totally see this happening. So I've taken time to make sure I'm extra careful with my disc when taking them out of their holder and putting them back in.

So in summary, good series, be careful not to scratch you disc when returning them to their cardboard sleeves, AND if you're smart and have a blu ray player...don't be like me and buy the dvd version...*sigh*",1355184000,,1559,3.93968253968254

2904954,3,B000TJBNHQ,"I like the Stargate SG-1 series but the cardboard sleeves damaged the discs.  I found about 10 discs that were scuffed and scratched.  The packaging should have been slim double DVD cases.  If they wanted to go cheap, they could at least put flexible paper or plastic sleeves with a soft lining on the data side.

So far, I have been able to play the scuffed or scratched discs because I applied Turtle Wax Clear Coat Polishing Compound with circular polishing and then washed them off.  I had a problem with Merlin season 3 because one disc was pitted and it would skip or freeze.  I applied the polishing compound and it now plays.  One must be very careful in applying the polishing compound so it doesn't make new scratches.  I have put all of the discs in slim double DVD cases.

Fortunately, I got the SG-1 series for $73.99 so it was worth the risk.  I also bought the Stargate Atlantis complete series (5 seasons) for only $71.99.",1354838400,,938,4.497041420118343

2904975,4,B000TJBNHQ,"This review is solely regarding the packaging.  The merits of the show have been discussed by thousands and there is no lack of opinions on that subject.  A series that ran for ten years and over 200 episodes must have been pretty decent.  Anyway, the huge box that all ten seasons of DVDs are packaged in was designed very poorly, with paper sleeves that allow the disks to fall out and rattle around inside the box, scraping against one another and getting scratched.  Sometimes they are scratched to the point of being unplayable.  This is a universal problem with every example of this product.  If you are lucky, maybe your box didn't get any rough handling and the disks are fine.  If you are unlucky, you can easily end up with a box full of scratched, unplayable disks.  My copy was somewhere in between those two extremes.  I bought an electric DVD scratch remover and I was able to get all the disks cleaned up enough that they would play.  Or if you get a bad one, just keep sending it back until you get a copy that doesn't have scratched disks.  Good luck, because you'll need it.",1353801600,,1093,4.46969696969697

2904977,3,B000TJBNHQ,"As with probably everyone here who has bought this item, I think the series is great and worth 5 stars. I might like this more than Star Trek, but there hasn't been a Star Trek series for a while, so it's tough to compare. The first two seasons has some awful writing with stupid character development/reactions (e.g., the supposedly brilliant archaeologist, Daniel Jackson, never bothers to learn how foreign cultures do things and only uses his assumptions and knowledge of similar cultures, which keeps getting his team into trouble), but it gets much better over time. Unfortunately, it set me up to think that Daniel Jackson as stupid throughout the first six(?) seasons and made it difficult for me to get completely pulled into the story whenever Michael Shanks show up on the screen. It gets worse for me because they were inconsistent with whether or not he needs glasses and I had to convince myself that the sarcophagus healed his eyes enough for him to not need glasses all time in the latter part of the show. I couldn't leave it him wearing contact lenses because he would put on glasses in mid-scene and it wasn't to read. Too late to say this now, but be consistent, directors! Anyway, the tying in of human history and myths/legends is just great, sci-fi fun.

About the item itself, I bought this at a great price of $60 this summer and it felt like a steal at the time because it was marked as ""New"" and from Amazon. Unfortunately, mine came with some of the minor problems others had. I checked every single disc when I first received it and was going to use a DVD binder to store them, but the cardboard holders weren't so bad that I couldn't use them for infrequent use. Let's face it, this is not going to get watched more than once a year even if i loan it out. Anyway, there was a few scratches on about 10 of the discs and even several fingerprints that can be used to identify who the culprit(s) is. The good news is that all the discs played fine on my PS3. At the end, I didn't feel that I got a new item, but I wasn't compelled to take the chance with an exchange for another set when I was able to watch all the episodes and it was priced as if it was used.

2905005,1,B000TJBNHQ,"Stargate SG1 complete set review

This set should be awesome and it was for me the first time I used it. I watched Stargate the whole thing through for hours and hours on end with my friends which was a great deal of fun. However, that's when I started noticing problems almost immediately. After watching many of the disks just once the disks had completely degraded despite the fact the DVD's looked fine. I was at a total loss for awhile as I could no longer play my favorite episodes and my DVD players would get to a certain spot on the disks and simply hang never being able to move beyond it. This set would be awesome if it didn't suffer from the worst quality disks I've ever seen in my life. Hands down these are the worst DVD's I've ever owned. I love the show and the set would be great if it actually worked but it no longer does after just one use on many of the DVD's. I wish I knew how to get replacement disks from the manufacturer but I haven't had any luck contacting them.
Overall I was ecstatic at first and now I'm frustrated and angry to no end as a great set like this shouldn't suffer from shoddy quality disks at all. Based upon my experience I must recommend against buying this set until the quality is substantially improved. The situation with this set is completely inexcusable given how much it costs and what awesome content it has.

Researching my order revealed that the product was supplied to me by a third-party, not directly from Amazon.  I was not asked to review this product or its seller, nor was I informed it wasn't coming directly from Amazon.

Based upon examination of a variety of discs in the set I received, my best guess is what I got is NOT new and unused.  However, it took me more than 30-days to figure all this out.

2905012,1,B000TJBNHQ,"I decided to break-down and buy the complete series but I did not heed the previous warnings posted by others. I received the set today and from the outside all appeared fine. Once I opened the packaging the errors made by the package designers became apparent. About two-thirds of the disks are badly damaged with scratches and burnish marks from the hard cardboard materials used because there are no protective sleeves on the individual disks. Inside the box are two accordion-like sleeves each holding half of the series. Each fold-out page is made of hard grey painted cardboard with three glued-on hard cardboard pockets, one above the other. It is apparent that in the ordinary jostling that occurs in shipping the bottom two disks are free to move within, or even slip from, these pockets, causing the extreme scratching and even transfer of the grey paint to the play-side of the disks. Only the top-most disk is held in place by the covering box lid and is generally less damaged than the bottom two disks on each page of the fold-out sleeves. Just unbelievably poor design and lack of foresight by the package designer. Too bad, I really wanted the full set.

I do not consider this to be Amazon's error and true to form they immediately offered a refund and noted that there have been other similar complaints. I'm going to try one replacement set to see if the results differ, though I doubt it given the source of the issue.

2905014,5,B000TJBNHQ,"Okay, I just completed checking all of the disks in my SG-1, 10 season anthology. Here is what I found.

Firstly, let's talk about the infamous ""packaging issue"". Having read the previous reviews I was ready and waiting with 54 proper DVD cases and all of those oddly small pieces of soft fabric (from the optometrist and when you buy a monitor) that I could find around the house. Now, my first reaction to the impressive packaging was ""OMG"", because I had really not envisioned how many DVDs 54 really is. A lot!! The DVDs are not in cases, they are wedged into half  envelopes of high gloss cardboard which are pasted on to 2, 5 leaf fold-outs w/ the envelopes both front and back. Hard to visualize, I know.

It is an impressive product display, while at the same time completely inappropriate for the storage of DVD media, in my entirely inexpert opinion. So what is the issue? Well as Shakespeare said ""..ah, there's the rub"" only in this case I mean rub literally, the DVDs rub against the cardboard envelope edge. 2 of every 3 DVDs will have the telltale hairline scratches in a straight line across the DVD. Another issue is that some of the DVDs have sticky edges. Not sure, but I think that has something to do with the laminating process. My goal was to remove them from this packaging and get them into cases. The mere process of extracting them can also cause scratching - notice I said ""wedged in"". My process was to take those oddly small snippets of fabric and push them in between the cardboard and the DVD (with a table knife, carefully) and then gently pull the DVD out of the cardboard. That seemed to work.

Now the careful readers amongst you will be wondering why I have rated this a 5 with so many issues and my answer to them is to keep reading....and to the rest of you.

The quality is good. High resolution and better than ever sound, meaning better than ever comes from the cable company (nice people though). And starting with season 6, you will notice even better res and sound, along with more dire warnings about trying anything illegal. So people really do that? Could you even buy 54 blank DVDs for this price to copy on to? (Sorry, OT)

Ok, here's the big ending, everybody reading closely now? All the DVDs played without flaw, no blocking, no drop-outs, no ""invalid disk"" from the DVD player. Yes, my 10 season, 54 disk collection at this amazing price worked perfectly! And what a feeling of liberation when you are suddenly overcome by the realization that you now have been freed from the random, infrequent and lower quality reruns of the cable company (nice people though) much like the Jaffa are freed from their false god oppressors. Well that is perhaps a bit of an overstatement,...perhaps.

""Hallowed are the Ori"", ""Wait for it"" and all the other quotes from this wonderful series of erstwhile and lovable explorers who daily (or twice daily if you like) fight against the powerful who victimize the weak. Buy it!",1343260800,11,2962,4.5879017013232515

That leaves about ten percent of the EPISODES (not the discs) as unplayable - even after careful cleaning and attempts to read the bad discs in two computer disk drives with several computer programs (MakeMKV, Hanbrake, DVDShrink as well as attempting to play with VLC, iTunes, Windows Media player, etc).  The scratches on the discs are horizontal, lining up with the edge of the card board pockets they live in and the scratches clearly have come about while the package has been transported.  Too bad, this appears to be a great value, but be warned.",1341619200,2,934,4.664634146341464

2905036,1,B000TJBNHQ,"Don't buy this box set. The show is great, but the packaging of this set means that the dvds will almost certainly be damaged before you get them.

2905037,5,B000TJBNHQ,"There seem to be two types of reviews out there: reviews of the show and reviews of the packaging.  I'll start with my review of the show.
It is a wild ride of a show, and it is all produced incredibly beautifully.  The quality of every episode never fails to astound me.  Where the story may lack in realism (how many times has Daniel died?), it more than makes up for in pure entertainment level.  The characters are deep and their continuity astounding.  What this show has that others lack is the multiple layers of significance: the plot, the amazing characters, sweeping ideals that the writers are trying to get across, a few between-the-lines relationships (I'm looking at you, Sam and Jack), and some really hard-hitting questions about humanity itself.  The Stargate is not only a portal to other worlds, it is a portal to entire peoples, wars, stories, loves, vengeance, revelations...and it all loops back around to SG-1, the team that opened the Tau'ri to the galaxy.  In addition, the cast make great role models: the Air Force keeps everyone in line, and the members of SG-1 conduct themselves with honor (""No man gets left behind!""), respect, and a complete optimism and faith in the people they meet.  In fact, Richard Dean Anderson was awarded the title of honorary Brigadier General for his great portrayal of an Air Force officer, O'Neill!  I wholeheartedly recommend this series to everyone.
As for the packaging, I admit it is a tight, awkward fit.  The disks have potential to be scratched, and removing them from their cardboard sleeves is a nerve-wracking endeavor.  However, I have inspected every disk that I insert into my computer, and none are scratched or pitted.  Only twice have the disks skipped or gotten a little funky, and that can be solved by simply fast-forwarding a few seconds.
I completely support the Stargate SG-1 show, and this collection is cheaply priced and well made.  There is absolutely no reason that you shouldn't own this! :)",1341100800,2,1980,4.857142857142857
2905038,5,B000TJBNHQ,"Update #2 (2/12/13): I have now viewed every disk and episode. No disk was scratched or skipped at all! All played perfectly!

Update #1: The review below was left on 6/29. Almost exactly a month later (8/1) the new set of DVDs was delivered to me from Fox. I wanted to immediately post here that the new DVDs are 100% OK at least on visual inspection. There are none of the scuffs in the digital layer that seemed to plague iteration 1 of this release. So, as promised in the review below I am raising the stars and reporting that, yes, Fox is supporting this product. I am leaving the review below intact just for the fact that it is one of many detailing the problem and in it I also have the phone number Amazon gave to me that all could use to remedy this. Oh, and the Stargate Logo is straight! Good news!

-------(Prior Review)-----
Thanks to the comments here I knew to examine my discs when they arrived. Out of the 52 there were more than twenty showing evidence of this defect. Now, I did play one of the discs and it worked. But it really looks visually as if it should not play or will fail at sometime soon. Obviously I can't play all 20+ discs. And, anyway, suppose they fail in  year? I do not think that these defects (at least the ones my discs  have) were caused by either the cardboard packaging (which I find acceptable) nor by the shipping. Rather, these look like manufacturing flaws in that they are under the clear coat in the digital layer itself. Someone in the comments mentioned buffing the discs but this would not do any good as the clear coat is completely OK above the damage. I called Amazon. They said they would not send out another set because they bought them from a wholesaler. I'm not sure why that explanation makes sense but that is what they told me. They said if I wanted to I could have a complete refund or they gave me a phone number to call Fox (the manufacturer) who they said was aware of the problem and would replace the product. So I called Fox (888-223-2369) and they did know of the problem and said they will replace it. They immediately emailed to me a return label for the set and have said it would take maybe three weeks to turnaround. I am mailing this to them today. If i get the new set in a timely manner and/if the new set does not have these defects I will come back here and raise the number of stars to the 4 or 5 I expect the set deserves. Wish me luck. Oh, one other thing showing that whoever they had on the assembly line when these went through was less than competent -- the beautiful 3D Stargate logo on the box was cemented to the box 120 degrees from vertical!! The box would have to balanced on a corner for ""Stargate SG-1"" to be straight! Oh, well.",1340928000,2,2727,4.268858800773694
2905039,1,B000TJBNHQ,"As has been said by MANY reviews here, this should be a 5 star set... but whoever designed the case knew nothing about DVDs and how to package them.  I was NOT going to buy this set due to all the very consistent warnings about damaged discs and the cardboard sleeves (whoever thought that was a good idea - FIRE THEM).

But, the chance came to buy this set new for only $55 and I thought I would take the chance.  And a chance it was.  First thing I did when I got the set was go through and pull random discs and play through them (I really should pull all of them, but there are over 50!!).  While they all 'looked' clean, there were about a half dozen occasions, while watching the shows, where there was obvious digital break up, or in other words, damage to the discs.  I got LUCKY in that the break-ups were minimal and none of them stopped the disc from continuing to play (as opposed to a LOT of other reviews I've read here).

That being said.  The first thing I am doing as soon as I finish this review, is going to the store and buying a REAL DVD case that is designed to store DVDs without ruining them.  Without a doubt, If I left the set in the box they came in, as pretty as it may be, just moving the box around, and DEFINITELY every time I took a disc out to play it, I would be running a HUGE risk of scratching and ruining a disc.

Other then the incredibly poor packaging, I would give the set 5 stars.

Also, for hard core fans this is good news, for those who are more prudish (don't really know how else to say it) I have bad news.  The 'pilot' episode IS the original pilot episode, that aired on cable TV... meaning there is a few, VERY brief, scenes with full frontal nudity.  If this is a problem for you and you want the 'Network' version, it's available as a separate disc, should you still decide to get this set.

BUT... take everyone's advice and CHECK YOUR DISCS (by actually playing them), then immediately move them into a proper storage sleeves or case!",1340409600,14,1990,4.188976377952756
2905040,4,B000TJBNHQ,"By now you've probably read all the horror stories about scratched and damaged discs in the complete boxed set of Stargate SG-1, but a recent super-low promotional price for this item pushed me over the edge and i believed it was worth the jump. Fortunately, due to all the complaints about the boxed set on here, this led me to immediately do a spot check on the contents and I was amazed to find that the discs were in pristine condition with no marks, scuffs or dings.

My only conclusion is that MGM may have replaced the original vendors who supplied and assembled their sets. But this is just a guess. In any event, I did not see any problems with the boxed set that was sent to me.

I never watched Stargate SG-1 when it was on television, so the whole experience is new to me. And with all ten-years of Stargate SG-1 at my fingertips, it makes viewing the series even more enjoyable. The production values of this show are great, and I really enjoy the stories.

If you have concerns about purchasing the Stargate SG-1 boxed set, as I was, just make sure you purchase yours from Amazon and not a third-party vendor. I was counting on Amazon's excellent return policy to bail me out in the event of damaged discs, but this proved to be unnecessary.

The only reason why this set gets four-stars instead of five-stars is because all the discs are somewhat hard to remove from their individual slots, and are pretty tightly packed. But this may be due to a redesign of the package to make sure that the discs will not slip out during shipping to prevent damage. So I guess its a good tradeoff.

Even at its present price, it's still a pretty good deal and you get free shipping too.",1340323200,,1687,4.429032258064516
2905041,5,B000TJBNHQ,"Ok, I have never seen the show.  But the first movie is one of my favorites.  It is such an interesting idea.  The story draws you in and kind of keeps you wondering and excited.  The cast is full of great actors.  The show ran for such a long time.  You will have so many episodes to watch.  There were also 2 other shows that went with the Stargate idea.  There was also an animated series.  I know show got less than great reviews, but I am a collector.  So, if I get one series, I will get them all.  With Stargate you have loads of stuff to watch.  Besides the episodes and movies, you have the special features.  There is a lot of entertainment here.

That being said, there was one problem I had with this set.  Most of the DVDs had marks.  Some were small while others covered the entire disc.  Besides that, there seemed to be a film substance on a lot of them.  They may work fine, but I will not take the chance.  So, I just got them today, I went on Amazon to the help - chat thing.  First they said they would give me a partial refund.  There was no reason for that.  It is not their fault.  So, they told me to contact the manufacturer.  They gave me the phone number.  I asked my mom to call and she did so.  The company said there were some sets with errors or problems.  They said they check each disc in the set before sending it out.  They will email her a label, I return the defective set and am sent another one.  That is fine with me.  I think the set is really cool.  I chose not to get my money back.  Even if something happened and the next set was defective, the company has to get me a good copy.  So, I am fine with it.  Some people sad the DVDs were moving around or would do so, thus scratching them.  I can not see that happening.  While there were two discs that were out of there slots, I think it was how they were put in.  The rest of the DVDs would not move.  It took some real force for me to remove them.  I am 100% confident that when a non defective set arrives, the DVDs will be fine.  If you don't feel the same, you could always go buy some felt stuff or whatever you felt best with and put them under the DVDs.  That is what I did with the Friends series.

When you read through this you may wonder why I gave the set 5 out of 5 even though there was something wrong with it.  The reason is this, sometimes things happen.  No company wants to sell someone bad or defective stuff.  They are the ones that end up losing money.  Some people don't like the fact that they have to go through the work of sending the set back, and then wait for the new to arrive.  But just relax.  Everything will work out in the end.  If you got like 5 series sets and they all were defective, then you could tell them you wanted your money back.  Now I have an adventure of my own.  I get to wait and see if the next set is 100%.  If you want to buy the set, maybe it would be better contacting the company who makes the set.  As I said, they check each disc.  So, this is a cool story done over 10 seasons, if something is wrong it will be fixed.  Check it out!!!!

Update 7 - 25 - 2012

Ok, I got my new set in the mail yesterday.  I was excited to finally get to watch the show.  I checked the DVDs and out of the 10 or so I checked, they were useless,  I only saw one with a scratch or scratches actually, but most of the ones I looked at had this stuff on them.  Big clusters of stuff.  I tried wiping them off, but they could not be removed.  I can not figure out what was on them.  It is almost like before they put the stuff on the DVD to protect it, something got on the Disc.  Maybe they would have played, but it seems to me that is there is something that is covering a DVD and it is unable to be removed, you will have problems.  So, I contacted Amazon, and am getting a full refund when they get the set in the mail.  I told them they should refuse to sell until the company can figure out what is wrong and package it better.

When the company who actually makes the set was contacted, they said they check each DVD before they ship it out now.  Well, either they forgot their glasses, or that was just something that was said that is not true.  Either way, now I am out a series and the company and Amazon are out money.

I think I heard people were having problems with the single seasons as well.  I will go to FYE and get one used.  Then if something is wrong I can return it to them.",1340323200,,4428,3.95

I highly recommend this set.  I paid twice as much as it is today.  It was a wonderful experience for me to watch this with the kids. It increased their interest in science. They learned much about characters, plots and life.  RDA made sure that they had fun doing it. This series set opened their minds to the world of scifi and, hence, the 'world-possible'.

If ever there was a failure in packaging, this is it!  About 3/4 of the dvd's were out of their cardboard pockets (bad idea to begin with!).  Upon closer inspection, I found 11 dvd's that my player rejected as ""disc not readable"" & 18 discs that were scuffed up very badly!  So, I had to contact Amazon & request a refund.  Excellent customer service.  They sent me a return shipping label & my refund will post back into my bank account as soon as they receive the dvd's back.  I though about repurchasing another set from another source, but after reading how so many other people have experienced the same problems with the way the dvd's are packaged, I'll pass & purchase each season separately.

2905059,3,B000TJBNHQ,"Bought this over a year ago.  Upon opening the package, we had several disks loose and scratched/dammaged.  So, When we first started watching this we found a few episodes/disks would not play.  Amazon did their best and replaced the entire item.  Our dismay was that the replacement item was in even WORSE shape than the original and so it was the replacement we returned.  (And we kept the first item and decided that any other replacement would have the same issues.)  Now we are rewatching the series and although we have used a means to ""clean"" the damaged disks there are still epiodes we have been unable to watch.
I am now in the process of replacing the damaged disks by repurchasing individual seasons.

The series is amazing and a great addition to any video library.

MGM (or whoever designed this packaging) should be shot for faulty product devopement. Spend the extra and get the seasons individualy.

I bought this set and experienced no problems or damage that has been reported by others. For all scifi buffs this is a series that tops the charts. Think for a moment if this could be real. Think of how far and fast mankind could evolve its' technology. The show deals with many different aspects of life as if it were dealing with this blackops as it were which makes it even more believable.

2905091,4,B000TJBNHQ,I was so excited to see a complete series collection for such a low price. But The packaging is horrible. The cardboard sleeves scratch and scuff the disks even before they arrive.. It's a hard question whether paying an extra hundred dollars for real DVD packaging is worth it.

I immediately looked through all the disks to see how badly they're marked.  There are several that are marked, but I chose to start watching at the beginning.  By the time I get to any that I can't watch, I'm sure it'll be too late to send the set back.  But I'd just a soon try to fix them with one of the disk fixer thingys.  At this price, well what can I say?  I absolutely love SG-1.  My only problem is that looking through the disks, I saw nothing for Season 10.  Admittedly, I didn't take every one of the disks out to put them in order or anything, but all the slots are filled and it ends up with Season 9 for what I have.  If that's the case when I finish watching them, I guess I'll just come back and buy Season 10.",1315612800,,861,3.9593023255813953

Upon arrival the product was exactly as described if not in better condition than I expected.  The only concern I had was that the DVDs in the box were loose in the packaging and all mixed up.

Not only are they in cardboard pockets that scratch them, but these pockets themselves are so loose, they don't keep the discs within secure. I absolutely love ""Stargate: SG1."" But this packaging is dreadful, and the low price isn't worth it for such damaged items. I saw a lot of negative reviews on this site, and I chose to ignore them. Now, I'm sending this set back and, when there are good enough sales, will be purchasing each of the seasons separately. This isn't Amazon's fault, because the problem is with the inside of the box and how the discs sit in the set, not the outside..

However like others on this site I must comment on the packaging, yes I too have scratched discs, so far the ones I have tried do play OK. I have sent Amazon a photo of a typically damaged disc just in case I have problems further down the set. I suggest that if you buy this set also buy 6 piece DVD cases to store the discs.
Something else to note, the packaging states that season 1 is 4x3 letterbox, when I played the first disc it was 16x9, so that is a bonus. the quality of the video image was also excellent.",1313452800,,583,4.0344827586206895

I did run them through again - and the portion that is defective seems to ""cure"" itself into a slo-mo version instead of just stopping....which is fine with me.

Amazon tried hard, big outer box lots of package cushioning made delivery just fine.  Also the DVDs were firmly in the provided slots so didn't slide around and get scraped or otherwise damaged. DVDs were so firmly in slots I had to remove very carefully to prevent damage.  I agree the original pkg style is not appropriate for long term storage.  I did see a few minor pits that did NOT effect playing, in fact wouldn't have noticed them if not warned to look for them.  All labels matched in color and looked clean and bright.  Point of interest is that while watching a disc I commented that other folks said these DVD's were grainy and poor quality, but they looked fine to me.  DH who is picky about these things said they WERE grainy, but watchable.  We concluded the quality matched pre HQ TV, which is when these shows were taped and therefore made sense to both of us.

Except for a handful of discs, this collection is in TERRIBLE shape.

I had not only found an abundance, of scratches, INSIDE of the discs, but some of my discs do not play due to some sort of ""milky white"" substance, which was ""splashed"" on the disc, prior to its being sealed.

Amazon.com was very good about giving me a refund, on this item, but I suggest that, if a person wants to own stargate, they should buy one season at a time, and check for defects, such as mentioned here, before buying another set.

This ""complete set"" is NOT worth the cost savings, over buying individual seasons.",1312329600,,786,4.673913043478261

Yes, I'm one of the people who got a set where a vast majority of the dvd's are scratched or pitted and also dirty.
Yes, I'm now one of the people who have had to send it back for a refund.

It is such a shame that a great show such as this received, and continues to receive, such shoddy treatment in regards to its DVD release.

Each of the discs in the bottom slots were scratched.  Some of the scratches were pretty significant.  It was difficult to tell if the damage was done during shipping because of the weight or if they were already damaged prior to shipping.  The damaged discs that I checked do play, but the player had to correct some errors and there was some loss of the picture quality.  If you purchase this set of discs you would be well advised to buy a product called Disc Doctor that will resurface the disc removing scratches and other imperfections that cause the disc to skip or drop pixels.  If it didn't cost so much to ship these discs back then I would have done it.  As it is it would cost more to ship them back than they are worth.

However, I went ahead and purchased it hoping I would get a good copy. When it I arrived I checked all the disks and put them in a seperate dvd case as several reviewers proscribed. I would highly recommend doing this as the cardboard inserts the disks come in are a very poor storage method and will cause the disks to get scratched over time.

Some of the scratches were deep and not only caused skipping during playback, but one of the disks also froze completely during playback which prompted my return of the item for a replacement. I have a feeling that Amazon may be getting repackaged disk sets from the manufacture that had already been returned at some point. I also noticed that Amazon has tried to blame the consumers for this catastrophy. I think most of us know how to remove, use and handle a CD or DVD. I have never scratched a CD so bad that it didn't work. I dropped an audio CD on the asphalt and it slid across the asphalt. I slid it a bit when I tried to pick it up. That was in 1994 when I was delivering pizza. I still have that disk ""Countdown to Extinction"". It still works without skipping then and now. I have never used a disk repair on it.

2905148,4,B000TJBNHQ,"The original cast, specifically Sam, Daniel, Teal'C, and O'Niell (plus Hammond and Dr. Frasier) are easily the best gelling of the casts. Not that I disliked Mitch (O'Niell's replacement), Quinn (Daniel's temporary replacement), Dr. Lamm (Dr. Frasier's replacement), or Landry (Hammond's replacement), but they never quite worked for me the way our original and longest running quartet plus worked for me. And at times I quite liked Valla, though I question her being placed on SG-1. Especially because it is odd to see five instead of four.

What I loved most about the series is they way they took myths about Gods from different cultures and explained how they came about. Sure, there were the Goa'uld pretending to be Gods in order to enslave people and use them as hosts, but there were also the Norse Gods, portrayed by some friendly grey aliens (so Roswell is real!) as well as some gods on other planets who weren't what they seemed.

There was also the surprises, such as with the Nox, who are anything but what they seem, technologically and otherwise. With the Goa'uld ability to take over a person with little or no sign (plus mind control and the many other entities that could take over a person's mind and/or body), you never quite knew who to trust.

Whether or not I agree with the idea that people couldn't handle knowing that aliens are out there...is mostly besides the point. They deal with the issue a few times, but it is rarely actually addressed as a true debate and is more an issue of the Stargate people making sure the secret is kept.

The most surprising aspect of the show is how much it concerns itself with politics and corruption. This is a theme that runs through all three series of the show. There are always people/governments/organizations who want to subvert the Stargate program and the technology procured for their own purposes. Sometimes, they truly believe they are doing the right thing. And sometimes you can't help but wonder if the seemingly more fanatic groups might be right, even if just a teeny-tiny bit...

Sometimes the show got goofy. Sometimes it even made fun of its own goofiness (Sam's on screen love interests always die, Daniel always dies, TV shows made about the show itself within the show, etc), which is always appreciated. Perfect quote:
I'm thinking I can back-sell it and say you were beamed out at the last second. [Martin]
Is that not too convenient? [Teal'c]
Not if you hang a lantern on it. It's a writer's term. Another character points out how convenient it is. That way the audience knows I intended for it to be convenient, and we move on. [Martin]
But for all it's goofiness, there are some serious moments. The way they dealt with Dr. Frasier's death, for one, was extremely well handled.

The only thing I wish they had done, was kill someone off on the main cast for good. It was a little too (dare I say it) convenient, that the cast, especially Daniel, was always brought back to life after he died. There was never a concern for serious consequences because no one we really cared about ever actually died. Which seems surprising considering how powerful some of the people we were dealing with were.

I greatly appreciate the way they bring in characters from previous episodes, either by mention or by actually bringing them in. For example, we see Sam bond with Cassandra, the little girl whose home was destroyed by the Goa'uld and though Sam isn't the one to adopt her, she comes up a few more times and is mentioned even more often than that. (There was a little disappointment that we never got confirmation of a Sam-O'Niell relationship, but not exactly a surprise either.)

The biggest question I had from this series stemmed from a set design choice. Specifically, doesn't it seem like an odd, even poor decision to have open flames all over a spaceship? Forget the whole issue of what if you're attacked and one of the flames gets knocked over...isn't it an unnecessary stress on life support? Wouldn't you want the power on your ship running efficiently and not having to make up for the fact that fire is eating up oxygen all over the ship?",1308614400,,4138,4.721606648199446
2905149,3,B000TJBNHQ,"Have to add my experience to the other review that mentioned the discs themselves were in bad shape.  I actually wondered if I'd bought a returned set that someone else had damaged and somehow switched out for a good set.  You could actually see the poor condition of the discs just by looking on the back side.  All sorts of marks on the surface (or deeper?) that couldn't have been a good sign.  The discs played, but for how long?  Was this series set made in a part of the world known for cheap imitation DVDs?  Oddly enough, a household disaster led to me losing the set a few weeks after I'd received it, and while I want to own the series again, the fact someone else found what I'd found makes me hesitate to buy it in this format.  Might consider just getting the individual season sets...provided those don't also prove to be in bad shape.  Hmmm....gotta check out my STARGATE ATLANTIS series set now.

As far as I could tell the additional content is no different than what was on the original season releases. The set includes an episode guide with short summaries that is particularly useful for locating specific episodes to watch which is great for someone like myself that doesn't have them all committed to memory. The ""new"" price is an excellent bargain for anyone who doesn't want to wait for the Blu-ray conversion. The discs I received were in perfect condition and the unscaled 1080p picture is crisp. The only downside in my opinion is the packaging/organization of the disks which I found it a bit confusing at first.

Luckily, the disc still played in my cheap portable DVD player. But the discs that are even lightly scratched do not work in my Xbox, which I use in the living room.

They get scratched easily by the sliding into and out of the case.  Some of my favorite (and even not favorite) discs will no longer play easily in my computer.  They will play in a projector, however.  I have never used a DVD player attached to a TV for these discs.  I have now put every one of the over 50 discs in plastic sandwich bags to put them back into their ""sleeves"" to prevent further damage.  I would highly recommend that anyone purchasing this set protect the discs in a similar manner the FIRST time you use them.
  If you like Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis, I suggest watching them concurrently once you get to season 8 of SG1 because there are some things that happen in both series which are funnier or more pointed if you have seen the other series.

I am really disappointed I didn't buy it long ago (especially the time I saw it on sale for 78$ with Amazon!).  Yes, the packaging is probably the worst I've ever seen.  In fact, I'm shocked they couldn't figure out a way to do a better job of it.  I would have gladly paid extra for better packaging.  Granted, the box is really neat looking and the concept (the way the DVD's are kind of in a ""book"") is great... but not sufficient for such a large investment.  I will still give the whole package a 5 star rating because for the price you are going to get literally hundreds and hundreds of hours of content.  SG1 (in my opinion) brought something totally different to the Sci-fi genre.  The characters (especially around the 6th season), played by actors who truly have grown to love each other as family, play off of each other brilliantly.  What I did right away was buy a huge DVD holder and carefully removed all of the DVD's from the original packaging and placed them in the DVD case.  It was a 13$ investment that was WELL worth it. The DVD's that were scratched had only minor scratches that my Sony Blu-Ray DVD player ignored.  I have not had one problem playing any of the DVD's at all.  Not one. I would not let a few scratched DVD's keep me from buying this set.  You will be hard pressed to find this much entertainment at such a great price.  In fact, I don't even think a family of four could go to a theater with all of the extras for the price of this set.",1305072000,,1611,4.242622950819672
2905168,2,B000TJBNHQ,"I was very excited to finally be purchasing this collection set. I love the series. I was very, very disappointed with the packaging. It had nothing to do with the retailer that shipped it to me. The discs are stored in cardboard sleeves that are just barely big enough to hold them. As a result, many discs have spots along the back that make portions unreadable. I thought at first I would just grin and bear it since I'd already seen the entire series and missing a disc wasn't going to matter, but more and more started to have the same problem. I ended up returning it because so many discs were affected. I've heard that sometimes the discs are in perfect working order, if yours are, I'd recommend going out immediately and buying a new case to store the discs in and just leave the pretty packaging empty.",1304899200,,813,4.4630872483221475

However, Amazon.com are absolutely brilliant and sorted out a new boxed set for me. This second one is in much better condition, and the disks actually work this time around.

I don't need to tell anyone else that Stargate SG1 contained some of the most phenonomal SciFi television of our time, but it did, and getting this boxed set of the series has been a dream of mine for quite some time.

If I could change any one thing with it though, it would be to have what a lot of us fans desperately want, and that's a disk dedicated to bloopers from season one through to ten.

2905185,5,B000TJBNHQ,"I ordered this set with the knowledge that others were disappointed with the packaging of the discs and knowing I could send it back if it didn't meet my expectations.

The first thing I did was look at all the discs in the set - there are a few with some scratches on them. They are not bad enough to affect the playing of the discs, in my opinion. My kids have DVDs that are scratched much worse and still play just fine. I'm still going to get a DVD holder just for this set and put them all in that for safe keeping. The box display is gorgeous and I love it. I'll set it on a shelf so I can admire it.

I think I've seen every episode of SG-1. I may have missed one or two when it was on ShowTime because we didn't get that channel then. Once it was on SCI FI I rarely missed an episode. This is one of the greatest exploration science fiction shows ever made; right up there with the original Star Trek. Classic characters, believable relationships, and sometimes eye-popping special effects. Just enough so you didn't come to expect them or grow too used to them. This set even has the specials made along the way showing the mythology behind the series and the making of the 100th and 200th episodes. I can't believe it's been off the air as long as it has. Seems like just last week we were watching Unending.

2905188,1,B000TJBNHQ,"Amazon should drop this product and its Stargate Atlantis twin; they are more likely to be a far greater liability than a source of income for them.

Do not get me wrong, I am a very big Stargate Atlantis and Stargate SG-1 fan, but this is review of the product and not of the series.

I made the mistake of purchasing this product along with the similarly made and packaged Complet Stargate Atlantis Collection.  Both were severely disappointing.  Before purchasing either I had read many reviews on them both and decided the price was worth the risk.  I was wrong.  Many of the reviews I read complained about the packaging but said nothing about the manufacturing of the disks themselves.  When I purchased them I also purchased cases to transfer them into in order to avoid the packaging problem.  Unfortunately the real problem is with the poor manufacturing of the disks themselves.  On inspection no less than 1 out of 5 disks was pitted or whorled, both of which are manufacturing defects that can render a disk unreadable, and both of which disk cleaning or resurfacing will not address.  Fortunately Amazon was willing to take both back and give me a refund.  But it was still a cause of stress and frustration, and I now I have 100 cases that have no purpose.

I would very strongly advise against purchasing this product.  If you want the series then be willing to pay more for a better manufactured and packaged collection.",1302566400,3,1436,4.696
2905189,5,B000TJBNHQ,"I get the strong feeling that most of the bad reviews are of the standard  DVD set not the bluray set that has yet to be released.

That being said, Stargate SG1 was incredible for a number of different reasons.

First the cast played their characters incredibly well, the main characters all had or developed a sense of humor so their characters where not just their jobs and nothing else. The length of the series allowed for a lot of character development even with supporting characters, the length also allowed for a lot of ""experimental"" changes to be made to see if they would work, most did. The fact that eventually their where 3 main adversaries to overcome (The Gould,The Replicators, and the Ori) prevented the show from getting old.

In short Stargate Sg1 on bluray would be fantastic.

If it ever is released please improve the disc holders (vs the complete set on DVD, I've heard a lot bad things regarding scratched disc)",1302307200,8,937,4.689024390243903

Well the package arrived today and after checking all the discs, I can't find any major damages, only a few slight scratches that didn't affect playback at all.  Bottom line: If you are a Stargate fan, this is the best thing you can buy, and it's worth every penny.",1302048000,,450,4.487804878048781
2905191,4,B000TJBNHQ,"I purchased mine through a different vendor and the set I recieved had very little damage. I'm halfway through the series and have found only one disk with scratches and it worked fine in my bluray player.

I won't comment on the series itself since most people probably already have an opinion in that regard. Nor will I rate the packaging as that has been discussed ad nauseum. Instead I'm going to evaluate the way it was compiled and published.

Pros: It's all here. Plenty of supplimental material(featurettes, commentary). Episode guide book w/ brief synopses that aren't spoilers for the newcomers yet provide enough info for established fans to identify the desired episode.

Cons: The early seasons, originally broadcast in 4:3 aspect ratio, were cropped to 16:9. I would have prefered to see them in their OAR. Less is more and there would be many fewer foreheads being chopped off. It appears, though, that the producers gradually began framing it for 16:9 even while they were still being broadcast in 4:3.

The pilot and most of the first seasons had fairly poor video quality. Some looked like it had a lot of compression artifacts. It may also be the cameras they used early on. Later seasons(3 or so and beyond)show significant improvement in PQ.

In addition to the scratch issues already sited by so many, the early season(s) disks also seem to be slightly out of balance and cause my players to vibrate. It's not enough to keep them from playing but very noticeable audibly. It makes me a little concerned about wear & tear on my players.

Finally, the chapter points are seemingly random or each episode was divided into equal length chapters rather than at commercial breaks as is traditional w/ tv series box sets. If, after you've seen the title sequence 20 or more times and you want to skip past it now, it will not jump to the end of the title but several minutes into the next act.

Conclusion: I'm very satisfied with this set but I'm not totally w/out reservations. Because of the packaging issues I've decided to store the set in a different storage solution. The box itself will merely be an ""objet d'art"" on the shelf.",1301875200,5,2150,4.732620320855615

2905193,2,B000TJBNHQ,"I can confirm what others reported: Many discs are badly scratched or have dirt on them.
With some white toothpaste and micro fiber tissue I was able to polishing out some scratches and made it almost to the end of disc 2, but then PowerDVD and VLC froze again.
So I tried to rip the DVD using DVDDecrypter, which retries reading bad sectors, but it didn't find any on the disc. And while the original disc still crashes in all 3 DVD drives I tried, the ripped copy works just fine. Most likely some sort of copy protection, which protects me from playing it, but not from copying it.

Broken discs, unplayable media due to copy protection, region code which prevents me from watching the discs on my standalone player in Europe (after I relocated from the USA), ...

2905194,1,B000TJBNHQ,"I read a lot of reviews about the discs being defective and how you MUST remove them from the sleeves very CAREFULLY. So when I received mine I did just that. I inspected each DVD and about 10 or so are horribly scratched and grooved plus they do indeed skip and freeze a LOT. It doesn't look like scratches you get from rubbing them against the sleeve. It looks like a manufacturing problem. Some have very fine fuzzy 1/2 inch wide scratches/grooves that span the entire radius of the disc, so it looks like it came off the line like that, maybe a machine error during fabrication. I talked to customer service and told him about this and he said the only way to not get a defective item from Amazon again is to talk to the manufacturer and get a return from them. I find this to be a HUGE hassle as Amazon should be able to guarantee quality merchandise they sell. He also said they must have gotten a bad batch. While I can see getting a ""bad batch"" once in a while, I have seen reviews with this problem since 2007. So they've been getting a ""bad batch"" for over 4 years????? Why hasn't Amazon corrected this problem? Due to its cheap price, I'm wondering if Amazon is just selling ""slightly damaged"" items that they get a good price from the manufacturer in order to sell it cheaply to us. He said that all of Amazon items are brand new which I don't doubt. But brand new what? I say discount ""slightly imperfect"" junk. BEWARE when you buy this set. INSPECT them all the day you get them because you only have 30 days to return them. I have decided to have them replace the set and see if I have the same problem again. I'm not expecting much, but we will see. If it is defective as well, I will need to make a decision to just live with an imperfect set (some DVD's won't even play) for about $84 or find another source and pay twice that amount..

This is why some have good luck and some don't.

The box set is very simular to the Alias complete set, which I have, and I had no problem with that set. If you have good luck with the shipping you will like this set. In the end I returned the set to Amazon for a refund, and bought the set season by season. Yes it cost me more but it was about the same as it cost me for the Alais complete set. All the seasons came in the same size case and looks good on my shelf. The DVDs are very secure in these cases and much better protected.

2905198,5,B000TJBNHQ,"This review will focus mainly on the quality of the disks, since most people who would purchase this set are probably familiar with the general content and premise of the series from t.v.  I've watched a number of the re-runs on the Syfy channel and enjoyed them, but they appear sporadically and not always in sequence.  So, when I came across this boxed set for a very reasonable price, I thought it would be nice to watch the segments in chronological order, without commercials. I was a little hesitant to purchase this set after reading a number of negative comments about defective disks, but decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did. The set arrived nicely packaged, with all the disks in place.  Yes, they are a little hard to slide out of the cardboard slots, and just checking a few initially, there did appear to be abrasions on some of them. I decided to see how they played, and after watching 3 full seasons so far, all of the disks, even the ones that appear scratched, played on my 3 year old dvd player without a hitch.  I haven't bothered to obsessively check every single disk, or rebox them, since whatever may appear as defects are apparently not affecting the playback ability, at least not on my player.  The picture quality is quite nice too, without any distortion or color aberration.

Even with the cast shakeup in Seasons 8 to 10, the stories still proved to be entertaining and the production values stepped up as well.  The show seemed to follow a pretty established pattern over the 20 to 25 episodes per season where there would be a two part episode, a season ending cliffhanger, a clip show with a small amount of new content, a few ""story arc"" episodes that move the main story line along, and a few shows that could stand on their own right and explore the character development and such.

2905238,5,B000TJBNHQ,"So, I bought SG1 seasons 1 and 2 on Black Friday and I couldn't get them fast enough. Little did I know that there was a complete series package out there just for me! Woo! I'm not going to waste time by singing praises over Stargate because if you're reading this you already know. Downside - the packaging sucks as indicated by many other users on here. However, the two tips I found most useful among all these were to order new, then carefully remove and inspect every disk before placing them in a disk sleeve folder. So far, I have had few problems because I do like those before me and have been watching the show from an HD player. Do these things and you will have first prime quality sci-fi entertainment at your fingertips. If not, the Stargate pantheon will treat your feeble attempts as any other Joe Shol'va with scratched disks, annoying phone calls to Amazon return service, and an additional waiting period as they send you another set. From what I've heard however, they are good about doing this but sometimes even the next set(s) they ship have the same problems. Fortunately I was able to receive legit disks the first time.",1294444800,,1145,4.563106796116505
2905239,4,B000TJBNHQ,"This is one of the best SciFi series I have seen.  It is the characters that make most shows work if they are to last. Stargate SG1 has some of the best. The writing is superb, and the humor O'neill inserts into serious situations adds another dimension. The special features are informative providing background on the show and the stars.  Another unexpected was that one episode contained scenes not shown when aired on TV.

My main negative is the disc quality. This is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The first set I got had multiple discs with smudges and scratches. I returned it and Amazon promptly sent a replacement. The second set also had many scratched discs.  My first thought was to return that one also and get a refund. But I really wanted this series. So I decided to see how they played.  So far 11% of the episodes have had minor problems. By minor problems, I mean it would freeze for one or two seconds. It is definitely not the quality I expect from new discs.  But the alternative would be paying much more somewhere else. And while the freeze is an annoyance, it doesn't prevent the enjoyment of the show. I should also point out that the freezing and scratches do not seem related. Some discs that were not scratched froze, and some that were scratched badly played fine. So if you get this set, you won't be able to tell how they play by inspecting them.

The other thing I don't like is the case the discs are in. I recommend buying a case of DVD cases with the series.",1294358400,,1507,4.379928315412187

2905244,5,B000TJBNHQ,"Well, it would seem somebody got the idea that word was getting around about faulty discs in this set, and sales were going to take a nose-dive until something was done. My set was perfect, the discs were a little dirty and scratched but all played well the first time through and I have two that didn't play the second time through. Cleaning them should make them work.

About the series I just want to say it was a great ten years during a time when sitting in front of the TV was such a waste of time generally. They got us watching, they got us talking and occasionally got us fighting, it's all good and I miss it a lot.

About the set, it is beautifully arranged and the little booklet is just the right size with not too much info in it. There are tons of behind-the-scenes stuff on the discs, lots with Peter Deluis (sp)which, his occasional bathroom humor aside, are my favorites. The discs are well organized and it's easy to find a particular one you want, just ignore the 'volume xx' written on each label.

In a perfect world, buyers/fans should not HAVE to keep the discs in jewel cases, but if the price is right I guess we all seem to be able to live with that. All in all, especially for the price it's a great deal.",1293667200,,1233,4.260683760683761
2905245,4,B000TJBNHQ,"I received the package today.  It was packaged very well to protect it from shock and movement of the disc's within their infamous cardboard storage sleeves.  I think that the design of the cardboard sleeves walks a fine line, between slipping out in shipping and scratching or being too tight and being scratched upon removal.  None of mine had fallen out during shipment.

I removed each disc starting from the bottom to the top of the sleeves, flexing the sleeves slightly to avoid any disc scratching during removal. I noticed that some of the lower discs actually dropped further down in the sleeves when I flexed it. The top disc was the tightest, though after removing one side I could flex the back of the top sleeve to remove the top disc on the other side pretty easily.  There were no scratches visable under normal lighting, though under a strong light, I could see some light scratches or abrasions on some discs.  I used an eyeglass cloth to clean them and placed the discs in individual sleeves as others have mentioned to protect the discs.  Any discs with light scratches or abrasions were played in my average quality DVD player so I could view the episode in the approximate position on the disc where there might be a problem.  None of them skipped or failed to play.

The bottom line is that if I had paid a couple of hundred dollars for this item, I would have probably been disappointed in the effort it took to avoid scratching difficulties, and some of the small abrasions and scratches.  But all in all, it was a great deal for a great collection.",1292457600,2,1573,4.585714285714285

Since doing this I have every episode copied to an external hard drive and the original cd's are now put away for safe keeping. I have managed to watch the entire collection and not one skip or problem of any kind. Needless to say I do not have a single regret about the purchase.

2905268,3,B000TJBNHQ,"My review of this is kind of mixed. The review here is not really on the content but rather on the condition of the disks themselves.  I purchased this item & when it came it had multiple disks that were scratched. This seems to be a common problem with this release. In fact almost every disk I looked at had this problem. (there are 54 disks in the package) I promptly returned the package to Amazon.  (Amazon is very good in this respect that if one receives an item that is damaged, Amazon accepts returns) Sounds bad so far, right?  Well, read on....

Here is where the ""caveat"" comes into play.  I re-ordered the item & this time the disks (except for one) came in pristine condition.  I checked out every single disk & not a single scratch could be found.  Even the disk that shows a sign of a problem is not actually scratched, but rather it has a number of smudges at it's edge. (not sure how it got there since all the other disks seem to have been handled well in packing)  I tested this disk to see if the smudges would affect playback & I am glad to say that thanks G-D, the disk plays perfectly.  I might try to buff the disk to see if I can get the smudges out even though it does not affect playback. I do try to take very good care of my electronics & this is no exception.

In conclusion, my advice is to handle the disks very carefully when removing them from the pockets they are packed in.  The main thing to be careful about, is when removing a disk from it's pocket, that one slides it out in such a way that it never touches the other disks in the same row.  This will effectively prevent scratching.

Personally I have read some who say that the packing itself is the problem & that the disks should be immediately removed from it's container.  I would disagree.  Here is why... This point may indeed be valid in regard to it's original packing, where the people packing the disks were not careful enough in handling the disks.  However if one when opening this item finds there are no scratches, there is really no need in my opinion to change the way the disks are stored.  As I stated above, as long as one is careful not to let the disks touch each other when taking them out or putting them back in, one should be fine.",1286841600,9,2249,4.241784037558685

2905285,3,B000TJBNHQ,"if you are reading this review, then you are already interested in and familiar with the show, but want to know more about the packaging for this dvd set after hearing some nightmare stories. this set is seriously flawed in its packaging design. however, you should buy it anyway!

as many have experienced, the cardboard packaging causes discs to become scratched up and unplayable on some dvd players. it's just a terrible inexcusable design. the outcry from slighted buyers was very loud as you can see from all the negative reviews on amazon. and as a result, this dvd set is often on sale for very, very low prices. that is why you should take advantage of this situation.

the difference in price between buying this dvd collection versus buying all ten seasons as separate individual sets is significant. sometimes the difference can even be over $100 depending on when you're looking. i bought my set for $80, i.e. only $8 per season! buy this all-in-one set and put the good chunk of money saved toward buying a decent blu-ray player instead. a reasonably recent standalone blu-ray player's lens can read these scratched dvds without a problem. for example, the scratched dvds in my sg-1 set all work flawlessly on the sony bdp-s570.

let's face it, you were going to upgrade to a blu-ray player at some point anyway. if you do so with the stargate money you saved by buying this admittedly blemished dvd collection instead of ten expensive separate seasons, then after you finish watching the last disc of season 10, you'll still have a blu-ray player lying around. not bad. not bad at all.

just remember to store the dvds in a separate dvd holder with soft sleeves. the cardboard packaging for this dvd set is truly god-awful, after all.",1283558400,7,1749,4.762376237623762

2905287,2,B000TJBNHQ,"I thought, ""OK, some of the disks come scratched, but how bad can it really be?""

The answer is, ""Shockingly bad.""

This packaging should go down in DVD history as one of the dumbest ideas ever.  DVDs are sandwiched into cardboard sleeves that only cover half the disc.  This is not enough to hold the discs in place during shipping, so they fall in and out of the sleeves, getting scuffed in the process.  Some managed to get serious radial scratches, which is about the worst thing that can happen to a DVD.

Whoever designed this packaging should be fired.

I am going to try playing all the discs before sending this back because I have no confidence that I won't get exactly the same result with another set.  The packaging just about guarantees damage.

You'd be better off downloading episodes from torrent sites than buying this and that would serve MGM right.  The price is good, but I would gladly have paid $20 more for decent packaging and undamaged discs.",1283126400,7,968,4.608187134502924

2905302,5,B000TJBNHQ,"I'm a big fan of Stargate, especially SG-1. I was hesitant to purchase this DVD set, given the many warnings about the poor packaging and scratched disks. But I decided to take the risk, given the low price. And having just received the set, I think it was well worth the risk. Amazon shipped it by same-day courier even though I didn't pay for rush delivery -- perhaps this was a strategy to reduce the amount of bumping around that the disks would have been subjected to with normal ground shipping?  Unfortunately, the shippers packed the box set in the shipping box sideways instead of standing it upright -- which practically guaranteed that some disks would slide out of their cardboard slots. When I opened the set, there were definitely a number of disks that had slid out of place.  Perhaps a dozen had noticeable scratching, and a few had some gummy residue on them which I suspect was from the inside of the cardboard slots. So I made sure to clean and inspect each disk right away, then stored them in separate jewel cases, as recommended by other people. Overall, the scratches were a lot less than you'd see on a typical DVD rental disk. And when I played the disks with the worst scratches on my computer, it didn't seem to affect playback. So my take on it is: Go for it. As long as you're willing to put in the time to carefully take out, clean, and inspect the disks when they first arrive, as well as get your own sleeves or jewel cases to store the disks in long-term, it's a great deal.",1280361600,,1507,4.436823104693141
2905303,4,B000TJBNHQ,"This is a great series and I was very happy to see it at the significantly reduced price. Like many, MANY other reviews have pointed out, piss poor packaging. Some of the discs had minor scratches mainly the discs at the bottom of the stack. Also bought Stargate Atlantis at the same time, it appears that the manufacture tried to rectify the issues by placing a dab of glue in the middle of each disc. My one and only complaint thus far is the poor packaging, I highly suggest a a CD/DVD case to keep the discs in.

EDIT:
I'm about half way through Season 8 and thus far 7 discs have episodes that skip. I am over all disappointed, is proper DVD packaging that difficult?",1280102400,,672,4.333333333333333

I picked out the worst looking disk and watched it with no problems. It looks like I got lucky and received a pretty good set.  Because of the way the disks are packaged by the manufacturer I think that it would be almost impossible to get a complete scratch free set of disks.  Like many others have done I removed all disks from the standard package and put them in jewel cases.  I would have given this set a higher rating had the packaging been better.  But all ten seasons for only $80 is a great deal.",1279929600,,670,4.304
2905316,4,B000TJBNHQ,"As the title states, I got one of the Holy Grail boxes after I decided to risk things since the price had come down to an incredibly low dollar amount  (the condition of the discs was partly due to Amazon's packaging - they did what they could to keep that box - and thus the contents - from moving!).  After immediately checking each disc I found that not a single one had a scratch, buff, or mark.  As previous reviewers suggested I immediately removed all the discs from the original packaging and placed them in paper sleeves (keep in mind you will need a lot of those - 54 to be precise) for protection especially since as soon as I opened the manufacturer's packaging all of the discs in the first rows started sliding out every which way.  I don't know what the manufacturer was thinking when they decided on this form of packaging but it is definitely the *worst* packaging idea I have ever run across.  Still, kudos to Amazon for listening to customers and doing what they could to give the customer an undamaged product despite bad packaging on the manufacturer's part!  Ignoring the packaging problems issue this is a great product, especially for the price I got it at.  It's only the packaging that brings this review from a five star to a four.",1279756800,,1258,4.515418502202643
2905317,1,B000TJBNHQ,"I was never more than a very casual Stargate viewer, but am a fan of the SGU series so I have been tempted for a while to buy this series. I held back because of the reviews in here with regards to the damaged disks.

Then Amazon took them off the market for a while before re-releasing them. Great I thought, they have sorted the problem of the scratched and pitted disks, now is the time to purchase this set - and at a great price.

Alas the set arrived yesterday and I too am now the proud owner of the complete series of SG1 and the infamous scratched disks. They have to be seen by your own eyes to understand just how bad the disks are when they arrive. I have absolutely no clue as to why the disks are so scratched up and why they are still being distributed this way. I certainly cannot see how the packaging (as bad as it is) could have been able to do as much damage.

It begs the question why are they being sent out this way? It is clearly a long term, problem; it beggars belief that there has been no solution offered. It must cost the distribution company a fortune in returned sets.

However I have ordered another set, we can only hope these are better. I really do want this series so I intend to return each bad one until I get a good one. One of the other reasons I bought this set despite the bad press is the fact that I have always found Amazon to be second to none as far as returns go. I ordered in the confidence that if I got a bad set (which I did) then they would replace it without a problem.

I will certainly add to this saga and let you know if and when I get a good set of 54 disks.

EDIT: I have dropped my review from 3 stars to 1. I received multiple scratched sets and Amazon were a bit poor on their customer service with this one.",1279584000,6,1772,4.005665722379604

In my opinion this is a decent box set depending on what you are looking for.  If you care only about the episodes then this baby is perfect for you, because that is all you get.  The DVD's are basically held in place by what can only be described as a card board accordion with slots.  It's very weird but also very space efficient and holds all 10 seasons in less than a one foot cube.  That said, there is no glitz or glamor to this set at all outside of the Stargate ""toy"" glued to the outside of the box.  The box also includes an episode list but does not include any of the movies (Stargate/SG Continuum/SG Ark of Truth)  You will have to get all of those separate.

I must be one of the lucky one's because I have had zero problem with playback on my discs.  One thing I will say is that DVDs are very susceptible to the machine that they are being played in.  If you are still rocking a 10 year old DVD player, might want to upgrade.  Even the best of machines will run down after so long.  Think about what your car/computer/cell phone was like 10 years ago.  For my purposes, I watched all of these on my Insignia bluray player(6 months old).  It might be possible to scratch the discs while taking them out of the cardboard slots, but I did not have any issues.

As for the show - I think if you are looking at buying a boxed set, then you already realize how great Stargate is.  With 10 seasons and 2 spin off shows, Stargate is a classic for any sci-fi fan.

I would recommend this set to anyone thinking of buying the Stargate sets.  Really it's your only option and well worth the money you would save by purchasing each season individually.  The money in your pocket is well worth any shortcoming of the set.  Now you can use that money to buy the SG Atlantis set :)

When I got it, some of the DVDs almost fell out from the cardboard sleeves and there were DVDs that had scratches. I was able to get a replacement box set but again the DVDs had scratches. I decided to return both sets and get a refund. I do not blame Amazon for the cause. They did their best to wrap the box set with bubble wrap to prevent harm to the DVD.

Amazon should consider halting this box set if it causes this much headache. It is unacceptable that DVDs are package poorly that it causes damage to itself. I hope MGM can update the box set and wrap DVD in plastic sleeves or put DVDs in a thin pack case.",1279238400,2,763,3.891025641025641
2905320,5,B000TJBNHQ,"I was very cautious of buying this box set after reading many reviews complaining about the poor quality of the packaging, there were many complaints on scratched discs.  The price was marked down to under 80 dollars which was the lowest I have seen it sold new out of every other online shopping site I searched (the lowest price on bing.com shopping was just over 80 dollars after their cashback program) so i broke down and purchased it.  I was nervous upon opening the box fearing I would find a jumbled mess of discs that had come out of their packaging during shipping but contrary to the experience of other reviewers, the discs were safely tucked into their slots.  The packaging itself is not the best ever made as the discs are tucked into little pockets in a cardboard ""booklet"" but i inspected each disc thoroughly and saw no scratches or defects, I have yet to actually play the discs but they look like they are in perfect condition.  I do not plan to use the cardboard booklet in the packaging as permanent storage for the discs, I plan to store them in Gem disc cases (thin versions of what most CD's come in) for safer storage, but as for all the bad reviews on the packaging and receiving damaged discs, either I was lucky and got a good set or Amazon fixed the problem with shipping.  So my advice if you are going to purchase this set, don't be turned off by all the bad reviews about receiving damaged discs, I almost was and almost missed out on a great deal on a box set which would have costed me much much more if I purchased the seasons individually.

As for the series itself, I don't want to beat a dead horse, there are already very many reviews posted.  My advice here is to go watch Stargate the movie and if you enjoy that movie, imagine it with Micheal Shanks (with a better haircut and stronger acting), Richard Dean Anderson (who doesn't love him from MacGuiver), Amanda Tapping, and Christopher Judge, and a much longer storyline that visits many other worlds complete with other friends and many other enemies.  The episodes run from action packed shoot-em-up story lines to very well written dramatic ones, as well as a few tear jerkers here and there.  In my opinion this is one of the best sci-fi series out there.  I ended up watching it with a roomate in college out of boredom not expecting to really get into it but as soon as I watched the fisrt few episodes i found myself staying up until 2 or 3 in the morning watching 4 or 5 episodes a night, yes, it was that good.

So to sum it all up, I would rate this product as 5 stars (only because there isn't a six star rating) in both content of the discs and in packaging, as I love the series itself and I had no issues with damaged products.  Again I only reccomend that unless you plan on never removing and replacing the discs from their original packaging, store the discs in a safer container designed to safely store DVD's.",1278979200,5,2923,4.412639405204461

I haven't contacted Amazon yet, but considering the other reviews I've read I'm confident that Amazon will attempt to replace the damaged disks without issue.

The box was not shrink-wrapped and the disks were out of order.
It was possibly built from 'returned' sets.
The set does not appear to be intact, I only received 51 disks; 54 are supposedly included.  Several of the disks were very badly scratched.  I played the worst ones all the way through and there was only one place on one disk where there was about a 1 second skip.
Unfortunately it has been 31 days since my purchase.  Although I have only had the set for 3 weeks, it's too late to do anything about it except warn others.
My dvd player is a newer one, older ones may not have as good of skip control.
I purchased some cd/dvd sleeves at the same time I purchased this set, as most of the reviews are critical of the protection offered by the cardboard display.
Amazon now warns you about the possibility of scratching the disks due to the poor packaging (from the manufacturer, not Amazon).
The good news: at least partially due to the poor ratings because of the poor packaging and scratched and missing disks, a 'new' set now sells for just under $80.00.

Yes, mine came scratched.  Basicly they are tiered 3 high and when mine came in the DVDs on the bottom tier were out on top of the other two DVDs.  The vibration durring transit created circular scratches on the DVDs surface.  Thus one in every three DVD's are scratched plus a couple of the DVDs in the middle tier.  I just gave up watching the most scratched DVD as it was skipping too often and decided it's time to do something.

To sum it up; Over 1/3 of the DVDs were scratched.  Of the scratched DVDs, approximately 1/3 of these played with no problems, 1/3 had scratches that made minor skips, and the rest had irriatating skips which interfered with viewing.  My scratches were minor and I beleive that a little elbow grease can remove the scratches.  Or you can play the return lottery and see if you can get a set that doesn't have dislogged DVDs.  Either way you'll save money and shelf space buying this set (Complete series + scratch remover @ $120 VS. Individual seasons @ $250+)

Another nice thing is that the DVD pouches can be taken out and tossed as there is nothing special about them besides their tendancy to destroy DVDs.  You can fit about half of the DVDs back in the box in slim packs.",1278115200,4,1405,4.42023346303502

Amazon has another set on the way in the hope between the two sets I can make one good one. Fingers crossed that the new set has all the disc's I need without damage. As always, Amazon's customer service is fantastic. Expedited cross shipping of a new set and a return label to send back the defective set without any kind of struggle (ie the way it should be).

To be clear, this problem has nothing to do with Amazon's shipping and handling, and everything to do with the sub-standard internal cardboard sleeves that house the DVD's. The cardboard sleeves do a poor job of preventing the DVD's for shifting inside the retail packaging, subsequently causing the discs to rub against one another creating scratches and worse, pitting. This product has been suspended for sale many times as Amazon has attempted to fix the problem with MGM studios. Sadly it seems all of our feedback underscoring this problem along with Amazon's numerous direct inquiries on a fix for this 3yr outstanding problem continues to fall on deaf ears with MGM studios.

Many of the discs had been dislodged during transit but thankfully they did not incur any major damage that could not be gently cleaned off.  I recommend the set, however like in previous reviews, check every single aspect of the box and its contents as soon as possible for damage.

Also, there are web sites that sell multi-dvd cases in bulk, cheap!

I recently purchased the Stargate SG-1 Complete Series collection.  Over all I am quite pleased.  The packaging is good and sturdy.  Two ""books"" that contain the discs are at first a little puzzling but it only took a couple of minutes to figure it out.  My  biggest complaint is some of the discs stick and skip.  Maddening.  A couple of the discs which to my mind contain pivotal episodes for the entire series were almost unwatchable.  SG-1 is one of my all time favorite sci fi series.  Is is somewhat disappointing to put out the money for the complete set and not being able to fully enjoy each and every episode again.  All that said I would not discourage other fans from going for it.

episode 13 labeled the nox, there are a couple of places where apophus, the bad guy in gold suit, speaks but there is no sound, the rest seems to be ok, but i am still going through them to see what else may be wrong, also, there are light scratches on the back of most of the disks, i don't know if this will interfere with play back or not.

i might suggest try going with the individual seasons, they MIGHT be better.

as of july 7 2010 i have finished the first half of the box, and found one other disk with a problem.

as of november 7 2010 i have completed all of the disks here is my final report.

1. the quality of the packaging, the packing that the disks come in is intresting , i like the box with the little gate on it and its egypt type decoration, however, the sleeves that hold the disks can leave light scratches on the disks that can cause them not to play on OLDER dvd players, newer ones MIGHT be able to play them with the LIGHT scratches, i hvae a dvd player that is about 3 years, old and found 2 disks that gave me any problem,one was in the first season,
 the episode labeled THE NOX, the voice of apophus is left out of the episode, the second disk with a problem i found was in in the fourth season disk, i can't remember the name at the moment, but it froze up and it took a while for it to resume, about 3-4 miniutes in to the episode, other than that, that was all i could find wrong with the programming of the disks.

2. the shows are just as you would expect just as good and just as entertaining.

3. the commentaries, i found to be quite boring, drill a hole through my head boring,not all of them, but most of them, unless you really care about lighting, camera angels,shooting scheduels...ect things like that, the really technical side of making a tv show.

all in all i would still suggest going with the individual season  sets, but if you must have the entire show all in one go this is acceptable.",1273017600,2,2067,4.119402985074627
2905356,2,B000TJBNHQ,"I bought this item at the end of February.  I was looking forward to having all of the startgate Sg1 episodes at my disposal.  No more having to wait for it to run on ScyFy, no more having to watch it on HULU.  So when I got it I was very happy and started watching it.  Since this is a very long series it took a while for me to start noticing the problems.  Some disks skipped and froze, I thought maybe it was my machine.  Then I got to season 8, and found out I didn't have one of the disks, I had two of disk 4 but none of disk 2.  Disk 2 having some of my favorite episodes.  As I was looking at this I noticed the previous disk, and looked at the back, this one had skipped and frozen as well.  This was season 8 Disk 1, I looked at the back and saw a long mark of some sort, kind of a cross between a scratch and a gouge.  Then I looked at the other disks and found scratches and gouges on many of them.  This was last sunday almost 2 months after I had received the item.  I took the risk, since $107.00 is not a small amount of money for me, I called Amazon customer service at around 1am.  I explained my problem calmly and even with a little humor, the gentleman was very helpful, he put me on hold and talked to I am assuming his supervisor.  When he came back he said they were sending me a new item and sending me a return label for the one that I had.  I was very happy with this.  So I wait until the new Stargate arrives, hoping that this one will be perfect.  I get the second one and it is worse than the first one.  While the issue with the duplicate disk has been fixed the disks look like someone walked on them, and the box looks like it has been manhandled very badly.  I called Amazon within 20 minutes of opening the box and making a thorough check.  They sent me another return label and I will recieve a full refund when the item returns to them.
So long story short, bad product, this thing needs some serious inspections done to it, especially for what is supposed to be a new item.

Amazon has reviews warning of this problem since 2007- Three years ago! They SHOULD have corrected the problem long ago.  Amazon must have had many returns, so they very well knew about it.

For most of us - time is valuable.  Amazon wants us to pack up, send it back, wait until they process the refund and then we have to reorder.  That's if we are lucky enough to find out in time for the return period.

If Amazon has known about this problem since 2007 - the least they could do is stop sending bad sets and just send new one's on people's word! This should be an exception to returns policy, as Amazon could have remedied this problem in 3 years!  They know they have been sending junk to customers.

AMAZON:  If you value your customers, you shouldn't make them go out of their way re-packaging 5 pounds of junk disks when you know that they are most likely defective!

JUST SEND US NEW ONES!  Sorry, but I have been a loyal customer for over 11 years, and shouldn't have to be stuck with all of this junk, nor be required to pack it and send it back  - just for you to put it into the trash.",1271808000,5,1199,4.183406113537118

2905361,5,B000TJBNHQ,"If one understands that STARGATE SG-1 is strictly entertainment, then one can get past the obvious problems. Like any series, it has its horrible episodes; and early in the series there were many episodes that seemed more like the old STAR TREK series than the original STARGATE movie. Still, that's not entirely a slam, but a reflection of the fact that early on, there wasn't enough money to do anything else.

The series grew and embraced numerous aspects of humor, social and ethical commentary and always entertainment. Some episodes are tear jerkers, while others are hilarious. Very few of them were awful, though when they were bad, they were hideous.

One recurring issue was language. How is it that most cultures spoke English? Well, they didn't. The stargate had to recondition the minds of people to communicate, just as it had the power to transport, but it was never explained. In one episode, a visiting Tollan commented on the word ""triad"" being very similar to the word ""trial."" Well, that he was speaking English was far more remarkable than the similarity of two words! It's like the story of the fellow who, after being beheaded, picked up his head and walked a thousand paces. It wasn't the thousand paces that was so remarkable as the notion that he was able to walk one! If one can accept that he picked up his head and walked one pace, accepting the other 999 isn't so difficult!

Having said that, the series is well worth owning. I noticed that using the ""zoom"" control of my DVD player, that the image doesn't have a great resolution. At 2x you can really see the image degradation. I'm going through the entire 10 seasons now and am having a ball. I don't like Season 6 (?) where Daniel was replaced by an ""alien"" that spoke better English than I do and was so culturally dissimilar as to be ridiculous. In my view, it came too close to the line of suspension of disbelief. (Actually it's the suspension of belief, not vice versa!) I didn't really even like the guy, anyway. And killing Daniel never got old, as the writers never lost a night's sleep over how to bring him back. (He died and came back even more than Spock!)

The pilot CHILDREN OF THE GODS was reworked and is far superior to the one in this collection, but you have to buy that separately. The time travel stories also were quite good. As always, there are paradoxes, but the writers came as close as anyone can.

Buy the series. You'll not regret it.",1270425600,,2448,4.592677345537758
2905362,3,B000TJBNHQ,"I am super happy to have the entire series however, the packaging has been so simplify that I don't even have the info about what is on each dvd, the episodes, the extras.. so if I am not sure if I watched an episode or not I have to start watching it to find out.

Also, it's a dvd, they could have put some subtitles, my hearing is not really good so I have to put the volume higher and it often wakes up the baby.",1269907200,,416,3.8372093023255816

I'm not wild about the design (which, frankly, irks me endlessly), but my friends already had it and I knew what I was getting ahead of time. It's not the most efficient system of storing the discs, but it works and I'm willing to tolerate the annoying cases instead of losing three times the space in buying the individual seasons. All in all, I'm satisfied.",1269388800,2,442,4.469135802469136
2905375,1,B000TJBNHQ,"This review presumes you have some familiarity with the series; instead it covers severe problems associated with disc manufacture and packaging, and not (with noted exceptions) the content of these programs.  Had the problems described below not existed, I would have rated the series (not including the special features) a 5.

Amazon sent me this product three times in succession in an effort to get one complete, undamaged set of discs; after thirty+ hours of effort reviewing every episode at either 2x or 10x normal speed, I (hopefully) have managed to obtain one set--which still contains one defective episode and multiple defective special features.  The defects consist of:  1) discs so damaged, they will not play at all; 2) pixilated episodes; and, 3) skips forward on the discs.  There were approximately 36 defective discs among those  I reviewed (including reviewing the same disc from different sets to find an undamaged one).  The disc packaging (three discs in vertical slots both front and back in a long accordion) is ludicrous, and the episode guide is full of ""will SG-1 save earth again?"" and/or ""SG-1 tries to save the universe again!"" type of phrases, but at least there is an episode list by season.  The guide book does allow you to pick out many episodes by story arc (e.g., all of the Asgard or Replicator stories), if you haven't gotten a list by googling, e.g.,  ""Asgard story arc"" on your computer.

HERE IS THE WAY TO ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN ONE COMPLETE SET:  BUY:  1)  CLEAR plastic DVD jewel cases to replace the disc packaging provided, such as the 40 case pack by Memorex (also comes in 10 clear case packs--you do not need the thicker 10-pack jewel cases, which I reserve for movies, and which are more expensive per disc) and, 2) a Sharpie fine point black permanent marker.  I buy a two pack and leave one at each of my TV sets to mark jewel cases and DVD RWs that I record off the TV.  If you make an error on either the jewel case (or, FYI, any personal recordings you may make using DVD RW discs you wish to re-use), rubbing alcohol easily removes the marker.  Simply wet part of a folded paper towel with rubbing alcohol and use it to remove the markings; this does not damage either jewel cases or reusable discs (don't pour rubbing alcohol directly onto a disc).  Save the SG-1 box:  its deep lid can be used either as a container for 1/2 of your jewel cases--with the bottom of the box, of course, for the other half plus the guide book--or use the boxes in which your jewel cases come for their storage and use the SG-1 box for trinkets or give it to your children who are old enough not to hurt themselves on the corners; the box is approximately 8"" high.

START with the first entire set SG-1 set that you receive from Amazon:  Begin with disc one, season one; examine the disc for obvious defects:  as you proceed (reviewing every episode one disc at a time) you will learn that many discs are very abraded across one half of the disc; these probably will be rejected as unplayable by your DVD player.  Small abrasions or scratches MAY OR MAY NOT play without a problem.  While your DVD player loads,  use the marker on the VERY TOP EDGE of a jewel box (for example, picking Season #1, disc #2) PRINTING ON THE BOX AS FOLLOWS:  Season 1  Episodes 4 through 8  Disc #2.  Across the TOP FRONT EDGE, which has a wider space, print: 4) Broca Divide 5) 1st Commandment 6) Brief Candle 7) Cold Lazarus 8) Thor's Hammer, in 2 lines of print.  Note that THE SG-1 DISCS  DO NOT INDICATE WHAT EPISODES ARE ON EACH DISC.  For example, this particular disc only indicates ""Season 1 Volume 1 Disc 2.""  I never quite got the rationale for the volume numbers--they were irrelevant to me.  Labeling your discs in this way will help you locate (and later return to storage) your desired program more quickly by looking down at the top of the case using the program guide to narrow your search.  If you simply retain the original packaging, you will struggle mightily with it; toss the packaging when you have compiled a completely finished set--54 discs.  Don't accidentally discard packaging for sets you must return.

TRY TO PLAY EACH DISC.  MGM and FOX will force you to sit through their opening display of stars, movie trailers and copy protection legal notices; you cannot fast forward, nor can you stop the play.  Watch each episode at 2x speed if it's one you particularly like; choose 10x speed for your lesser favorites).  Remember there is a 30-day return time limit and you have 10 years of episodes to watch (not including special features).  Also:  you are not watching the episode for the story.  You are watching the media process on the screen.  Use soft eyes.  If you stare intently, you will probably have headaches and find it difficult to pay continuous attention (requiring aspirin and eye drops).  At 2x  or 10x speed, you will have an opportunity to stop the play and go back a bit to see if something visually unusual is merely a special effect, flashing lights on SG-1 machines, focal/quick cut shifts, or an actual defect such as pixilation or skipping.  I left my DVD player timer status showing on the screen and dropped to straight play at 40 minutes to the end of the episode.

IF disc quality is ACCEPTABLE to you, place the disc in its pre-labeled jewel box and drop it in your desired container, with each successive box placed behind the previous one.  IF the disc is DAMAGED, set the disc aside (I put the rejects in the deep lid from set of DVD blanks) and put the empty pre-labeled jewel box in your container, so you can go back later to locate it and fill in with a disc from the next set you will receive by immediately advising Amazon of the problem; set two will arrive by expedited shipping.  The rejects will also stay (fairly ) in order (given duplicate defective discs) when it comes time to repackage and return them.  Amazon provides a return label you can print off your computer; they are apparently very aware of the problems with this particular product, and extremely helpful to those of us who are willing to go through the effort to weed out the defective discs.  Repeat this process through every episode (and special features, if you desire) on all 54 discs in number order.  Use set two  from Amazon to fill  the empty jewel cases from set one; you may need a set three (which, I believe, is as far as Amazon will go) to get a complete set.  Even using three sets from Amazon, I never managed to form one complete set, but compromised with the defects I found acceptable.  Hopefully, when I play my set through at normal speed I will find I didn't miss anything important to me.

You will need to reassemble the sets you are returning in the proper order.  The remaining disc packaging will be partially full with the discs you did not examine because the you found an acceptable copy in an earlier set.  Reassembling is a real chore, and you may need to find  the proper order to insert the defective discs only by working backward from the discs still in the packaging.  If returned within 30 days of each order, Amazon WILL NOT BILL your credit card for the extra sets, DOES PROVIDE return postage labels,  DOES SEND REMINDERS of needed return, and WILL NOTIFY YOU of receipt of the returned merchandise.  REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR ORIGINAL SHIPPING CONTAINERS AND PACKING MATERIAL FOR EASIER RETURNS.

PARENTAL WARNINGS:  1)  The first episode, Children of the Gods, contains FULL female frontal nudity throughout the scene where Sha're is being examined for selection by Apophis; you may have some explaining to do about both the nudity and the violence toward women; violence toward men tends to be a commonplace of war rather than gender exploitation--male frontal nudity is not a feature of this series.  2) Among the special features, a director  discusses his fascination with constipation and euphemisms for excrement and excretion, while two of the show's top stars sit sniggering next to him.  In another feature, the same director escorts you to his urinal and describes its problems at some length.  Private bodily functions are clearly part of his personal focus, however irrelevant this is to any plot or process of the series; by season (7?) there are actual viewer warnings that commentaries are not attributable to anyone but the speaker.  3) Finally, remember parents, the morality tales your children are seeing also come with a great deal of explicit violence and death from beginning to end without evident Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, lasting physical consequence, or emotional distress beyond the episode in which these problems arise--with exceptions for the death of an SG-1 spouse or child and perhaps Teal'c's apparently irreversible aging in the final episode.  Take the Parental Warnings and Ratings seriously for both the  ""inherent scariness factor"" and the desensitizing effect of repeated violent images given  the maturity level of your child(ren).  Although older children may appreciate this material as simply  Sci-Fi entertainment, we have come a long way from playing cowboys with cap pistols and squirt guns; cinematically and as ""breaking news!"", we blow huge numbers of people away daily;  even children occasionally suffer/die as part of this series:  enough said.

The PROs for buying this product:  If you really, really enjoy this series and its stars, you will put in the hours of work and schlep returns to UPS in order to have the complete series without the irritating pop-up promos repeatedly forced upon you in the midst of the program by commercial TV stations.  Some of the special features are worth watching (such as Rick Anderson's efforts to document great rivers of the world,  or the way in which the particular type of martial arts was discovered and utilized in ""The Warrior"" episode, and anything to do with the late actor (and excellent painter) Don S. Davis, as General  George Hammond.  Some of the special features are juvenile, others are fascinating, and the choice is yours.

The CONS are obvious, so I bid you careful shopping.

I'm a retired Deputy DA, so I have no connection to any company or product mentioned.  I hope this review helps you fully anticipate and overcome the difficulties of a purchase connected with this product.  I likely will never buy another MGM  or FOX series again because of my experience with this product.",1268870400,2,10397,4.736227045075125

2905378,5,B000TJBNHQ,"This is a great deal. Admittedly the packaging leaves a lot to be desired but the content is where it's at. Over 200 episodes of one of the best sci-fi shows ever created for only 100 bucks. It took a while but I watched through all 54 discs and none of them skipped or had issues. I would recommend visually inspecting it on arrival and make sure no discs came loose and possibly got scratched. This way you can avoid being disappointed when you're totally engrossed in the show and on disc 30-something and suddenly you find a scratched disc and can't continue.

It took three tries before we got a fully playable set of DVDs.  THREE!!!

The packaging leaves a lot to be desired.  I mean, really!  DVDs sliding into cardboard slots?  That's just asking for scratches!  They could have at least lined the slots with some kind of slick plastic coating ... Once we finally got a usable set, the second thing we did (after checking ALL the discs) was put them in individual thin-packs; and they didn't take up much more space than the original packaging.  54 thin-packs - how much more would that have cost them?

Some of the problem was obviously manufacturing, though.  Several of the won't-play discs had no scratches that we could see.

All in all, the manufacturer (MGM?) needs to seriously invest in better quality control ...",1267833600,,844,4.751724137931035

And as far as i can tell its cause by the packaging granted its a really cool idea how to get all these CD's in such a small box but as it ships its scratching the cds. there placed in these cardboard sleeve and the paper smooth side it whats holding the cd. Any Major Bumping will loosen the cd having them rub against other cd's and the packaging. lucky for me only a few in the first few seasons had major scratches to where they would not play and since i already owned the first two season i didn't bother returning because all the rest was fine. few more had minor scratches but they played all the way through.

Classy? Yes! Clean? Sassy but squeaky. Well worth owning.",1266192000,,388,5.377049180327869
2905396,3,B000TJBNHQ,"Like other reviewers' ""Complete Series Collection Set"" quality issues, mine had many DVDs that were scratched as well. I know this wasn't my doing because I NEVER handle any CDs or DVDs with my fingers. Come to think of it, the DVDs are really hard to remove from their cardboard slots. What idiot had the moronic idea of sliding DVDs into a tight cardboard disk space? He/she needs to be fired. I recommend removing the DVDs and placing them in CD binders, like I do with the rest of my DVD collection. For one thing, they'll be protected. Second, it saves a lot of space. I'm afraid that sliding the DVDs in and out of the cardboard slots could permanently damage the DVDs. I paid $97.99 with free shipping. I guess I got what I paid for.

On the positive side, I gotta give them credit for the design of the exterior part of the box set, with the Stargate protruding from the front. The set also comes with a well-organized booklet that lists all the episode by season, and each episode lists a brief synopsis. It also shows what special features are contained in the discs, as well as some photo snapshots of the episodes, which are printed horizontally across the top of the pages.

When I consider the fact that I paid $9.80 for each season, I'm not too disappointed with this product. I really don't know where else you could get this series for that cheap. However, if you don't really care to have the fancy Stargate decoration on the box, I recommend buying each season separately because you might get better quality DVDs. It might take you a little while longer to acquire the entire series, but it's a good bet the DVDs will have much better quality.",1266105600,2,1663,4.503311258278146

2905421,3,B000TJBNHQ,"It's great to have all of the season's together in one box at your finger tips. But the packaging of all of the seasons causes a few problems, primarily in the quality of the discs. Because they use carboard sleeves instead of plastic slots (flexible buttons to secure the middle of the disc) 50-75% of the discs are damaged which causes you potentially only able to watch 1 full episode out of 4 on any disc. I received the set 3 weeks ago and i've missed about half of seasons 1-6's episodes due to scratching. If the complete series arrived in slim-line packs (similiar to individual seasons) this would've been better.
Scratches aside, the special features are great! Seeing Children of the Gods in it's original make-up was nostalgic and the interviews from some of the discs are brilliant.

I found one disc with minor scratches which still works fine. Granted I have watched only Seasons 1 and 2 so far. Nevertheless I am enjoying the set, it's a great buy. The reruns on SyFy are not in chronological order which is quite confusing. Now I finally understand all the story lines. Sorry Trekkies but Stargate is better thought through and innovative.

2905426,5,B000TJBNHQ,To get a ten year series set for under $100 is perfect.  Disks are stuck in paper cut outs and not well protected from wear over time.  Box is decorative but you may want to transplant into plastic multidisk boxes for better protection if you are going to be taking disks in and out alot over time.  I know I will.  If you have never seen the show on DVD some seasons have comment tracks and there are a few other special features.  The show is the reason we buy a set like this.,1264377600,,479,4.053191489361702
2905427,4,B000TJBNHQ,"About half of the discs did indeed have varying degrees of the scratching that I'd read about in other reviews, but they all test-loaded fine on my player. I've only watched a handful all the way through, but they are playing without mishap so far. As I pulled the discs from the cardboard sleeves and visually examined them, I noticed an interesting pattern: The discs in the bottom slots tended to be the scratchiest; the discs in the top slots generally were the best condition; and the middle slots held discs that usually were about midway--condition-wise-- between the other two. I don't know why that was, but it was a definite pattern.
  And yes, the packaging is a lovely eye-grabber. Looks nice on the shelf.

2905430,5,B000TJBNHQ,A lot of the more recent reviews (though several years old now) complain about poor packaging.  I ordered this set through Amazon for Christmas 2009 and there are no scratched disks nor is there an issue getting the disks back into the packaging without scratching them.  The packaging is actually of higher quality than I expected reading the reviews and I had decided to take a chance and hope that I didn't have problems.  I may just be one of the lucky ones but I should add that I have several box sets and this is actually not all that bad for packaging.  It is also nice that they get 10 seasons (plus extras) in a box that isn't too too big.,1264032000,,649,4.295081967213115

2905434,4,B000TJBNHQ,"I saw an episode or two of SG1 on TV years ago and was not that interested. I recently picked up season one of SG Atlantis  in Wmart because it was only about $13. I really liked Atlantis so I eventually bought all seasons.  After that I thought maybe I would take another look  at SG1. So I found this deal ($102 including shipping) and thought that's a lot of entertainment for the money.  I am now about midway through Season 2 and I am hoping they got some hope they got better writers on the job by 3rd  season. SG1 is just comic book hoaky compared to Atlantis.  There seems to be NO scientific minds OR military in SG1.  The only character that is a plausable Sci Fi character to me is Tealc (sp)  The other three members of SG1 are more like the 3 Stooges than explorers. Not the actors faults though, I have seen them do other stuff. I have not even looked to see who the writers on Atlantis and SG1 are but they cannot be the same .

Atlantis is right on par with Star trek, and they absolutely copied many things from Star Trek DS-9 , but that is fine by me they copied good stuff.

In Atlantis their military tactics are very good and the Sci Fi is plausible but so far (Midway through second season.) SG1 is pathetic on both counts.",1263513600,,1245,4.171548117154812

The box is awesome but when you start checking out the discs, seriously something is wrong. Out of the 50 discs or so I had 5 that were scratched up and one that won't even work it's so bad scratched. This is just sad that you pay so much for this awesome series and they can't even get the discs in without messing them up. It looks like from reading below everyone is having the same problems with the discs. Great series but beware of the packaging on this one.

I sent the first set back to Amazon and the replaced it without any problems. But the second set had similar problems.
The trouble is that unless you replace each individual disk you will have similar problems on other disk. It is a Quality problem with MGM. Why they do not have better Quality Control is beyond my comprehension. But they obviously do not care, I have tried to contact MGM directly and cannot find a way to reach them. This is very poor customer relations, and people need to speak out to MGM.
This is not an Amazon problem, they have been very good about replacing the product, but it does no good.",1263081600,,781,4.430555555555555

Had the new one at my door the same day i returned the old one  {gotta love returns with amazon}
the new one is in perfect condition { they started to put a micro dot of glue in the bottom to hold the discs in } there are some discs with discoloration on the data side but they still play!!! however if you buy and do get a good set i suggest a brick of jewel cases to put the discs in cause they will scratch if you keep moving them in and out of the holders!!!!!!

I finally ordered it, and I have to say, that every disk is perfect, every label as it should be and the box is in perfect shape.  All in all this is an amazing deal.  I am not sure if I just lucked out, or if they have fixed the problems that are so prevalent with the other reviews.",1262995200,,424,3.9069767441860463
2905453,3,B000TJBNHQ,"I read many other negative reviews regarding DVD quality, but I took the chance that manufacturing had improved and ordered a set for myself.  Please note the date of this review, Jan 7, 2010.  I'm pointing out the date to say that the problem has been reported since 2007, but is still happening in 2010.  Manufacturer beware, you are about to loose the ability to continue selling this DVD set through Amazon.

We have watched through disk 2 of Season 4. Once attempting playback of disks 3 and 4 of Season 4, I too have been bit by the bug of poor manufacturing. These 2 disks will not play in any of my 3 consumer DVD players. I have been able to get them to play on my computer (a MacBook Pro). I will now test all other DVDs in the box set to determine their playback ability. The problem I experienced is not while watching the episodes, rather, the disks can not be loaded at all for playback. Upon insert, a loud and abnormal sound emits from the player. It sounds as if something is misaligned in the tray, and eventually the disk either auto-ejects, or simply stops. This behavior is repeatable and consistent with the specific DVDs mentioned above.  I highly suspect that more DVDs in the box set will exhibit similar behavior.

Regarding Amazon customer service, they were a big help. They agreed to send another set, and extended the time to return my current set. This should provide the opportunity to find all the bad DVDs in the current set, exchange them for good DVDs from the replacement set, then place all the bad DVDs together for the final product return. Hopefully this will leave me with a full working set of DVDs. Of course, there is still a chance that the exact same disks are bad from each complete set. We'll see.

If you're considering purchasing this product, Stargate SG-1 is a lot of fun to watch. No need to review that further, others had said it well. Just know that you might be in for some work to have in your possession a complete set of DVDs that can actually be played on your DVD player.",1262822400,,2034,4.451612903225806

Many of the episodes exhibited repeated pixellation and/or freezes and several disks sounded like they were unbalanced.  I was able to ""work thru"" all of this except for Disk 5 of Season 9 which produced very bad vibrations in my DVD player before it declared it to be unplayable.

Overall, for the price, I am satisfied with the product and was happy to be able to experience the series episodes in order.",1262217600,,649,4.758928571428571

2905457,4,B000TJBNHQ,"Stargate.. one of the largest franchises I have known, and one of the most enjoyed. Since the beginning Stargate has been productive, starting out with a simple film and then moving on to three shows, 15+ combined series, and 3+ films. Supposedly they are making an interactive online game as well, set in a galaxy where the power to travel is at your hands in the form of a DHD.

I rate the collection, all 10 seasons, as a 10/10. Nothing could compel me to believe that it is not worth watching or owning.

However this is a poor form to own it in. The box is actually pretty cool: I'd love to stash it away in my entertainment room for guests and my viewing pleasure, were it a vessel capable of holding discs without destroying them. I am severely disappointed with the packaging that this beautiful set came in. In short, a cardboard piece of crap that should be thrown away.

The list:
+Scratched disks - Nearly every single disc was scratched. Some appeared to be scratched into oblivion, but all the discs I checked worked.
+Cardboard packaging - Get rid of it ASAP. Your discs will not survive, find a Disc organizer and put all of your discs in there.
+No Play? - I have found two discs so far that my DVD player will not recognize out of 4 seasons so far. The solution? I played them on my computer.

Fortunately the scratches have not resulted in viewing problems, all of the episodes have played with next to no pausing due to damage.

_____A bottom line: If you love Stargate, this is probably for you. If you do not love Stargate, walk away now. Either way, for less than 1/3rd of the original price this is a great deal for ten seasons of Stargate SG-1. Just make sure to buy a separate CD organizer for your discs._____",1261958400,,1736,4.4125

I love all of the characters individually - their strengths their weaknesses and of course, it's just great fantasy that's set within our real world, which is great too.  Love it!  Well worth watching if you've never sampled Stargate before.  I hadn't - and was hooked just like all the original fans were. *grins*",1261180800,,533,4.463917525773196
2905460,1,B000TJBNHQ,"There were no labeling errors on my set.  We'll see if all of the discs play, but I inspected them all and there are no visible defects aside from some minor scratches I couldn't avoid when removing the discs.

The packaging is terrible, nothing more needs to be said -- just look at all the negative reviews.  The show is mediocre sci-fi, but it was special to me as a kid and it's cool to have all 10 season.  I've transferred the discs to plastic cases to prevent further damage to the discs.

The box is a bit large but would have been fine if it wasn't for the stupid raised plastic stargate on the side.  Where do publishers think people will be storing these sets -- as a centrepiece on the dining room table or something?  It's not as egregious as the BSG collection, and it's more forgivable considering the huge number of discs in this set, but I still would have preferred individual slim boxes for each season.

The series is split into 2 sets, which fold out accordion-style.  It's very annoying to take apart and put back together, if you want to store it in the original packaging.

What strikes me about this set, and others like it, is the obvious amount of work that went into designing and executing such atrocious packaging.  What the hell is wrong with the standard plastic dvd cases?  Or if you insist on cardboard, at least use digipak.

See the Farscape complete series for an example of perfection in TV series box set packaging.  It's also a better show to boot.

*** I've actually gotten around to spot checking a few discs.  For the first couple of seasons, the quality is BAD.  I mean, it looks like a bad VHS Rip.",1261008000,2,1643,4.423333333333333

Stargate went through ten years of a great cast proving their talent by taking on newcomers and continuing the thread without missing a beat.  Richard Dean Anderson and Amanda Tapping were able to bring to life along with Michael Shanks and Christopher Judge as well as others the quest of man to find answers to where we came from and where we are going. They pulled this off easily portraying a current situation where the Air Force explores new worlds with the aid of an ancient stargate that creates a wormhole to preset coordinates.  The cast is well picked and developed very well over the years in a believable Sci fi Special series.  There are many underlying issues brought to light through the writers that are important to society today, it is a great credit to the writers that the series continued for ten years and that there were two feature films and two series spinoff's from the original idea.

After getting through all 54 discs in this set, I have to say I'm somewhere between ""terribly unhappy"" and ""extremely disappointed"" with the packaging. 40 or more of the discs were visibly affected by the tight cardboard sleeves, and after just ONE insertion (at the factory) and removal (by me) there was obvious scuffing and scratching on the discs. About 10 of the scuffed discs needed some sort of cleaning to get to read fully, which would be bad by itself. One of the episodes (Season 2 episode 17) would not fully read, and one disc (Season 9 disc 4) would not load at all no matter how much I tried to clean them.

The packaging is terrible and I can completely understand the issues that caused many to rate this set low.  I was fortunate. My disks arrived in great shape and play perfectly. Both my Mom and sister have played the entire series without mishap.  However, the package is awkward and doesn't fit my DVD shelf. Having just cardboard to hold the disks also subjects it to the potential of scratches, something you don't get with other kinds of packaging.

If you are willing to risk having to ship it back to Amazon and have them send you another copy (which may have the same issue), go for it.

2905515,1,B000TJBNHQ,"Summary: Check all discs immediately. The probability of receiving damaged discs is high.

Unfortunately, several of the discs had clear scratches, and though some were tolerable for the DVD player after a lot of trial and error, I eventually reached the last disc for season nine only to discover it was completely unplayable, as in scratched beyond repair, and also that the returns policy had expired, meaning I have to pay some percentage for handling for an exchange--but--based on all the occurences of bad discs reported, the probability of receiving a damaged set again seems too high to ""risk it.""

At first I thought the scratches were due to how the discs were stored; they are stored in two books with slots for the DVDs. Although the discs could easily fall in and out of the slots during transport, it wouldn't explain the circular scratches, leading me to assume that there was no quality control, just mindless drones stuffing the books with discs.

I suggest contacting MGM about this, if you live in Canada or the US.

""FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMPLAINTS REGARDING MGM DVD RELEASES,
CUSTOMERS (IN THE U.S. and CANADA) MAY CALL 888-223-2369.""

My set is basically useless.",1254009600,24,1186,4.91
2905516,3,B000TJBNHQ,"MGM and Fox dropped the ball on this set.  The first nine seasons lack a ""Play all"" feature.  The first 2 seasons bump you back out to the main episode list to select the next episode, but then seasons 3-9 only take you back to the episode menu, forcing you to go back to the list before selecting the next episode.  Not a big deal for one episode, but after about 100 eps, you get really sick of it.

Another gripe?  The DVD authoring ad shows at the end of EVERY episode for the first 6 or so seasons.  Every one!  Most TV shows on DVD manage to put that at the end of the final ep on the disc.  It took MGM/Fox about 6 or 7 years to figure that one out.

Lastly, the title sequence is nearly a full minute long.  After you've seen it about a dozen times, you just want to skip over it.  Tough luck.  If you hit Next Chapter, it skips over the Title Sequence *and* the first act!  You have to scan through it, possible overshooting and having to back up.  It stays that way for seasons 1 through 9.

Season 10 finally included a ""play all"" feature, and finally allowed us to easily skip the title sequence with ""Next Chapter.""

None of these by themselves are enough to make me unhappy with this set, but combined altogether?  Crappy.

As for the show itself, the first 8 seasons are fairly solid.  It's a better show in many respects than most other sci-fi out there.  For example, in Star Trek: TNG, if a new way of doing something was discovered in an episode (such as using a strand of hair from when you were 25 to make the transporter turn you young again?), it was never again spoken of.  Not so in SG-1!  If they learned something useful, expect that they *will* use it!  And if they don't, you can be sure that there will be an explanation.

Unfortunately, the show makes a turn for the worst in 9th and 10th seasons.  I will not put any spoilers here; suffice to say that the team ends up trying to solve their newest crisis, but-- ooooo, shiny!!  It's as if the writers just couldn't fill the last two seasons with enough substance so we end up with more throw-away episodes than there should be (especially 4 of the last *5* episodes of the entire series!!).  At the end of the last episode, I found myself wanting those 30 hours of watching seasons 9 and 10 back.  And no, that's not a math error.  There are only 20 episodes each in 9th and 10th season.  Also, if you have not seen Stargate: Atlantis, there are a lot of spoilers for that show in these last 2 seasons (including a real doozy!).

Last complaint?  The ""Stargate: SG-1"" logo in my ""gate"" on my box?  It's at a 10-degree list.  (Means it's crooked.)  And it's noticeable, too!  I wrote to MGM to see if I could get a replacement box cover and the jerks never wrote back.

Overall, I was pleased with the series.  But I strongly suggest you stop at the end of 8th Season.  You will be better off for it.",1253577600,11,2881,4.21651376146789

This is by far the best thing since the classic Star Trek. And for current SciFi there is no better. Even after ten years it could have continued to run successfully. Even the Stargate Atlantis spin-off could have went longer. Stargate Universe coming up now on the SyFy channel has big shoes to fill. When this series first came out on DVD each season ran as much as seventy-five dollars in some stores. The lowest I think I got it then was around fifty-two dollars so you can see getting ten seasons for only a little over one hundred dollars is a bargain. The series has something for everyone young to old. I highly recommend the series, but I am not sure the price warrants celebration as several viewers indicated problems with the discs. The quality of the DVDs may only be fair but the replayability of the series is excellent. I would imagine if Richard Dean Anderson and MGM had anything to say about the DVD disc and box quality this would be another matter and it wouldn't be piece worked out to some dirty third world slave shop.

2905545,5,B000TJBNHQ,"Most TV shows spun off from movies are uninvolving and uninteresting (""Blade,"" anyone?), and utterly fail to embody whatever made the original story interesting.

But such wasn't the case with ""Stargate SG-1,"" spun off from one of the few good movies Roland Emmerich ever made, about a massive alien ring that allowed instant interstellar travel. Starting as a simple exploration series, the series expanded into a brilliant tangle of politics, aliens, and Earth's spirit and guts -- excellent writing, acting, and a sense of humor about itself and its characters.

The Stargate has been inactive for a year... until a bunch of Egyptian-styled warriors come through and kidnap an officer. General Hammond (Don S. Davis) pulls Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) out of retirement, and sends him to Abydos to find out what happened. O'Neill is reunited with Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) -- only to have Daniel's wife and brother-in-law abducted by the evil Apophis. A rescue attempt sparks off a war with the Goa'uld -- aliens who have been impersonating human gods for many centuries.

So the team SG-1 -- made up of O'Neill, Jackson, scientist/pilot Sam Carter (Amanda Tapping) and Apophis' ex-slave Teal'c (Christopher Judge) -- explore through the Stargate, finding plenty of hostile aliens, strange allies (the Unas, the Asgard), and humans scattered all over. Not to mention the gate-builders, who have ascended to another plane. Frst they battle the arrogant Apophis, then the devil-imitating So'kar, and the malignant half-energy Anubis and his army of undead warriors. The Goa'uld power structure starts to splinter, and new secret organizations make power plays on Earth, as SG-1 uncovers the hidden legacies of humanity's ancestors.

Even after the Goa'uld storyline ends, things haven't ended for SG-1. Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder) is given command of SG-1, and manages to gather the disbanded team back together, with the help of a quirky alien mercenary, Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black). Together, they find that the Milky Way faces its most deadly threat ever -- the Ori, evil ascended beings who demand that everyone worship them... or else.

Previously all ""exploration"" sci-fi focused on people on ships. ""Stargate"" avoids the usual space opera approach -- even when ships are introduced, the main focus is on walking through a big stone ring that instantly zaps a person to another planet. It's also full of real military, political battles (both on and off Earth), and a very plausible reason why everybody in the galaxy (more or less) looks just like us.

It's graced with elaborate, opulant sets, solid special effects, shoot-'em-up action from Marines and Air Force, and some truly kinetic space battles (including one that resembles the climax of ""Star Wars IV""). The storyline stumbles somewhat in the last two seasons, with the sudden switch in villains and cast. But all ten seasons are sprinkled with very warm human moments -- Daniel's farewell to his wife, Sam bonding with a doomed little girl, and Teal'c's struggle for freedom.

Best of all is the snappy script. Some of it comes from Teal'c (""Undomesticated equines could not remove me""), but mostly from the tart-tongued O'Neill (""Well, I guess we all start shooting. There's blood, death, hard feelings... it'd suck""). Other characters get great lines too ("" I think the circle means 'the place of our legacy'...or it could be 'a piece of our leg', but the first seems to make more sense"").

The cast is nothing short of brilliant -- Anderson does a quirky, disrespectful, pop culture-lovin' guy with a hidden tragic past, while Tapping and Shanks are great as an enthusiastic geek and a smart, capable military woman. And Judge is absolutely astounding as Teal'c, who slowly turns from a stoic, tragic warrior to a warm legendary hero. Corin Nemec had a one-season stint as Daniel's ""replacement,"" and he makes a nice, eager young newbie, while Ben Browder channels much of O'Neill's quirkiness when Anderson left. Black is kind of annoying at times, but she's admittedly quite funny and quirky, with a tragic past of her own.

""Stargate SG-1"" is undeniably the best TV spinoff, and one of the best ""exploration"" shows to make it onto the air... and stay there for a whole decade. Definitely worth seeing, from beginning to end.",1242518400,27,4319,5.106232294617564

It's a great blend of Action, Drama and Sci-Fi with great small Comedic aspects via the characters and the sometimes hilarious situations they get into.

The box comes with two cardboard volumes containing the 50+ discs.

Step 1. Keep the box upright at all times. This is the only way to ensure that none of the discs will slide out of their holder and bounce around inside the box. As long as the box is kept upright during shipment, your discs will be fine. I'll let you figure out what the probability is of that really happening.

Step 2. Carefully remove all the DVD's and put them in a large CD/DVD wallet.

Step 3. Hide the shame of a poorly planned box in the back of a closet or an attic.

3 or 4 of my discs looked like rental discs from sliding around in the box, but fortunately they all played fine. The labeling seemed a bit odd, though. As I stated earlier, there are two volumes contained within the box. Then why are the volume numbers printed on the discs not in order. Even more curious is that some of the discs are labeled volume 3. Not that this matters in of itself, but it screams ""enough talk, this stuff is due out now. Just use that design over there and lets get it done.""

What I love is the continuity of owning the complete series. The 112 episodes have a continuity in the story line that goes from one episode to the next and I can`t wait to get home to watch a couple more episodes that pick up from the previous ones I`ve watched. It`s just wonderful. I thought I'd seen all of the episodes on TV but evidently I have not. When I get thru all 112 episodes, which will probably take a few months, I'll probably watch the special features on many of the disc and then start from Episode 1 Season 1 and view the 112 episodes all over again; it's that good!!

The discs were not scratched, but I can see how they might become so, the compartments are not exactly ""disc friendly"".  I sort of wish that the entire collection was different than the normal season dvd releases, and I wish that they would relabel the disc numbers, they go by the individual season numbers, so it can get complicated.

I wanted to share this with my nephew and it was difficult because he's only learning basic english right now. The other thing is the package.

The first eight seasons are better than the last two, when they start introducing new characters.

2905562,5,B000TJBNHQ,"This is the longest running science fiction series of all time.  They originally made a movie based on this premise with Kurt Russell playing Col O'neil&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Ultimate-Edition/dp/B0000844I8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate (Ultimate Edition)</a>.

The premise for the movie was simple, during the 1930s a group of archaeologists discover a ring shaped artifact buried in the Egyptian sands under rubble from the times of the Pharohs.  Fast forwarding 60 years or so, the gate is now in Cheyene mountain (a giant military complex under a mountain) and a group of scientists working for the government figure out that there's a way to activate the device by decyphering the symbols written around the ring and that a certain combination of symbols opens a gateway between Earth and another planet that looks like Egypt.  I won't spoil the movie but a team goes through and finds aliens and all kinds of adventure.  This was very much the premise for the original movie.  Its worth watching.

The TV series was originally made for HBO and featured the Mcguyver himself Richard Dean Anderson playing Col Jack O'neil.  The series features a great cast of supporting characters like Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge, and Michael Shanks.  The series also had the great plus of featuring Don S. Davis whom I consider to be a phenomenal actor  Beau Bridges succeeds Don S. Davis in the latter part of the series and Ben Browder takes over for Richard Dean Anderson in the later seasons when Richard Dean Anderson becomes so obscenely wealthy (partially owning the franchise) that he doesn't need to work much.  Overall, the series is made wonderful by the spectactular chemistry and interraction of this case of characters mentioned above along with some of the minor characters that over the series become very memorable like the gate technician Master Sergeant Walter played by Gary Jones.

Overall, the premise of stargate is that about a year after the events of the theatrical movie, gate experts like Amanda Tapping and Michael Shanks figure out that the gate doesn't just lead to one planet (the original planet visited by the characters of the movie) but rather the stargate can be used to ""dial out to"" and is connected to  tens of thousands (perhaps millions or tens of millions) of gates located on planets throughout our galaxy.  Stargate teams SG-1 thru SG-XX are formed to go out into the galaxy.

The series follows the exploits of the Flagship team SG-1 headed by Col O'neil.  Needless to say, the possibilities for the show were tremendous and the premise also lends itself very nicely to television because our heros don't need spaceships to go places, they just dial to another world and viola! they're in some beautiful Vancouver forest.  This leads to a series that can be kept in budget rather easily.  However, since this series was originally HBO they had some great budgets to begin with and they did start to dabble with spaceships and the like early on.  As the series became more and more popular the special effects became much better particularly by seasons 5 - 10.

Over the course of 10 seasons and 10 years, over 200 episodes are filmed with multiple complex story arcs and numerous standalone adventures.  The series holds extremely well together.  It has action, adventure, drama, a dash of comedy and a dash of romance - great formula.

I must say that I never watches this series at the beginning because it was on HBO and I didn't have HBO so sometime around season 5 they began releasing DVD sets of the series and I got entirely hooked on it.  I must say that I might never had been hooked if not for the sets which allow you to see the entire series back to back which makes it much easier for you to follow the great story arcs.  Sad to say, I spent many an hour watching this series.

The Stargate series spun off a sister series Stargate Atlantis&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Atlantis-Seasons-1-4/dp/B0018SLGG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate Atlantis Seasons 1-4</a>&nbsp;which ran for 5 seasons although I haven't found a complete set yet.  Atlantis was based a team which heads off to another galaxy because they discover that the stargate can be used to dial gates in another galaxy (albeit using a ton of power) so they can't just go back and forth between galaxies easily.  So a team goes off to another galaxy and sets off a base.  The premise is very similar to Stargate SG-1 and focuses heavily on the chemistry and interraction by the team.

The Stargate series also spun off a couple of movies&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-The-Ark-of-Truth/dp/B0010YSD7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate - The Ark of Truth</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Continuum/dp/B0017MO10U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate: Continuum</a>&nbsp;which I found to be nice capstones to the series.

The Stargate franchise also launched Stargate Infiniti (an animated series based on the show)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Infinity-The-Complete-Series/dp/B0015LPS1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate Infinity: The Complete Series</a>.

Finally, there's a new television series planned called Stargate Universe.

I can't say enough good things about the series but it is definitely larger than life and very grand in scope but homey in its own set of ways.  I love the SG1 series the best followed closely by Atlantis.

Regarding the packaging for this series, I love the fact that its so compact - it takes up a lot less space than the packaging for the individual series.  I've never had any problems that some have reported (I might have been lucky or they fixed whatever problems they had).

Enjoy watching the longest running and most successful TV series out there.  This stands up there with the Star Trek franchise.",1235260800,3,6058,5.481162540365985
2905563,5,B000TJBNHQ,"So I bought this series knowing full by reading other reviews what I might be getting myself into. I must say over all I am extremely pleased with the quality that the discs were in when I received them.  There was minor damage to the discs due to the packaging. After the tedious process of taking out all 54 discs and inspecting them for damage I found that only the discs at the top of each ""page"" were left unscathed.  But like I said minor damage to all the others that hasn't interfered with playback in anyway so far.

I would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of the Stargate series, but make sure to inspect all the discs before deciding to keep it. MGM should give the designer of the innards of this box set a good swift kick to the junk. Happy viewing all!!!",1235174400,3,781,4.228187919463087
2905564,3,B000TJBNHQ,"The collection's presentation is quirky and fun, but it is not disc-friendly. We have watched most of the discs now and have found several episodes we can't watch at all due to damage to the discs. We either scratched them ourselves when taking them out from between the glossy paper flaps, or they were damaged when they were put in (or even before then) by the manufacturer. If the manufacturer had used paper without the glossy finish I imagine it wouldn't be as hard on the discs. Disappointing for something that wasn't cheap to purchase.

Due to packaging, specifically the cardboard insert slots provided for the discs, there really is little hope of keeping the discs from being damaged.  That being said, while my discs did arive in rather bad shape (which I was expecting because I also read the reviews), none of the discs were beyond repair.  The purchase of a Dr. Skip dvd auto repair system, a set of 11 (5-disc) dvd cases from digital innovations, and the time necessary to print out season covers (available at cdcovers.com) and you are good to go.  If you can pick the series up for under $150 I think it is worth the purchase (With the understanding that you will likely want to buy dvd cases and the dvd repair system that I spoke about above).  Otherwise I would probably buy the individual seasons to avoid the hassle.  Hope that this was helpful to others considering this purchase.",1233878400,3,1025,4.698324022346369

I'm not going to lie to you. The packaging is horrible. BUT, with care and luck, it doesn't have to ruin the set.

I took the warnings of other reviewers to heart. When the package arrived, I immediately and very carefully took out every single disk. Some disks had flecks of plastic stuck to them, and most of them had a haze on them. Some of the disks were already scratched, but none severely. I cleaned each one, played the scratched ones immediately to see if they were OK, and then put them all away in good-quality storage sleeves. I will never reuse the original packaging.

I have not yet played every single disk, but I have played many of them and they were all fine.

If I had not gotten this on the day in December when it was on sale for $90.oo I would have returned it. It appears that around 20 to 20 percent of the boxes contain unplayable disks, so as mine all were playable (only one disk was blurry...and it has no episodes that are favorites) I kept them. I would also warn new purchasers to check every disk carefully for errors (play 'em on fast forward stopping to check every so often worked for me). It also seems that the quality is getting worse as time goes on, according to a rough survey I did reading fan sites and places that post reviews, so if you want a copy just be aware. It's really sad that they are making these so bad of a place.

Also on some of mine I had places where the disk label was sloppily put on and was also had spots on the information side of the disk- so watch out for that as well as incorrectly labeled disks, scratched disks, glue, and whatever new sloppy disk mishandling errors that company burning the disks and packaging them makes. I suspect many of the problems are being caused in the burning process (i.e. packaging or mishandling the disks when they have just been burned and/or labeled). I wish you luck getting a playable copy, much less a copy without some kind of damage or defect to it.

2905584,5,B000TJBNHQ,"I received this set 3 weeks ago and have gone through 22 discs so far (of the 54 in this boxset). It still feels like I have a long way to go before I finish the series, but that's okay! Anywho, I just wanted to comment on the packaging and quality of the contents of this boxset. This was my first major boxset purchase. With the big price tag and with some of the reviews on discs arriving in damaged/poor condition, I thought I was taking a gamble, but remembering how great Amazon's customer service was from all my past experiences with them, I put my fears aside and placed the order.

Having had only a taste of a few episodes here and there on television, spread out across multiple seasons, I couldn't wait to get the whole collection on DVD. When the package arrived, the boxset was shrink-wrapped and cushioned with airbags. The case on the outside looked like it was in perfect condition.  When I opened it up, I couldn't believe how many discs they managed to fit into such a small area. There was a complete series guide and two large foldable binders that contain 27 discs each.

Before I popped any discs into my DVD player, I carefully checked each and every disc for any problems. To my surprise, nearly every disc of the 54 discs were in pristine condition. I only found 4 discs in the lot that had a little bit of debris that were impossible to take off with air alone (giottos rocket). I had to go an extra step. Using a clean microfiber coth sprayed with ""Klear Screen"" solution, I gently wiped the undersides of the DVD's that contained debris. I was afraid that I would eventually scratch the DVDs doing this, but the cloth and solution managed to take off all the little spots without leaving any scratch marks! The discs were as clean as new.

Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. I think the packaging is pretty nice. Its quite sturdy and the discs are snug in place (they're not loose). If I ever decide to spend some extra money I might go the route of buying some disc sleeves or envelopes as some other customers have suggested. Even if one or two discs contain a scratch or two, it generally wouldn't affect the image quality at all unless the scratches were severe. Well, I can't wait, I'm going to watch another episode of SG-1 now! I hope you can have the pleasure of experiencing this set too! Its an offworld experience!",1231891200,,2364,4.452655889145497

I've gotten through the first two seasons and most of the third, and have found absolutely no problem with any of the disks playing.

I personally thought this a great way to get all ten seasons of stargate SG-1, as I now have trouble finding any of them before season eight at the stores.  And I really enjoyed the fact that four of the disks are extras I would not have been able to get any other way, to the best of my knowledge.",1231632000,,655,4.023076923076923

When I saw this for $99 I bought it again (heck of a price) Then I gave it to her again for Christmas.  (she laughed!) This time though - EVERY DISC was scratched BADLY.  Unbelievable! I have submitted for a replacement hoping to get one of the 'mystery sets' with no scratches.

2905588,4,B000TJBNHQ,"I will try to not make this a review of the show, since there are plenty of other reviews out there for SG-1 with all its pros and cons.

The box set is beautifully packaged with the Stargate device a truly excellent centerpiece. The DVD cards are not what I would have preferred and lack efficiency. I fear that if I choose to watch a particular season or episode with any regularity, the card case will start to scratch the disk face. The disks are sequenced intuitively, though the act of flipping from front to back and fully extending the card can be a bit of pain until you get the hang of it (similar to folding a map for the first time). The disk cards are separated into two folders, which, again, doesn't seem very efficient. The disks use an alternating color code with season and disk number on the face. Artwork on the disk face is attractive but simple. Overall internal setup is, in my opinion, below expectations (especially considering the beauty of the outer casing).

Disk setup is my most significant dissatisfaction. The open MGM sequence is not sound leveled to the rest of the disk, and can be extremely loud if you have a good sound system. You are taken to a screen that includes two choices (only 1 on some disks), Episodes or Special Features. You are then taken to a sub-menu for each choice. I have yet to watch very many of the special features, so cannot comment on those, but the following concerns are a bit annoying. There is no play all feature and it requires no less than three commands to get to the episode. The episode title screens are poor and often contain spoilers. The seasons all contain different episode selection requirements. In fact, it is my impression that they simply transplanted the disks from the single season sets into one without any attempt to standardize. I, personally, don't appreciate the shortcut. Two things about navigation also annoyed me. First, the way the chapters are separated seems more based on time hacks rather than logical breaks. For instance, rather than making the opening credit sequence a chapter, it is mixed in with the first chapter based on time. Secondly, after the first disk, navigation after the credits start rolling requires a disk menu override (in other words, you can't fast forward or chapter skip the credits). Fortunately disk menu override works, otherwise you would be stuck sitting through the 5 or 6 minutes of credits, MGM trademarks and FBI warnings (for every episode). Fortunately, sound and picture quality are as expected and the setup distractions are soon forgotten. Unfortunately, it almost appears as if marathon watching is greatly discouraged.

The set includes a nice episode booklet that is tastefully done. It contains a decent synopsis for each episode and special feature and will eventually become invaluable should I wish to seek something specific.

Overall, I am really glad that I got this set. If you liked the show and haven't started collecting the DVDs yet, this is a great way to go. But if you already own a few disk sets, its my opinion that you stick with the season sets instead.",1231200000,2,3114,4.750462107208873
2905589,5,B000TJBNHQ,"I simply wanted to say that I bought this set in December of 08 when it was on the Goldbox deal, and it was worth it. My boxset came in perfect condition. It looked as if it had been ""Webbed"" (ala Spider-man) into the shipping box, so none of the discs were loose upon opening. I inspected each disk carefully. There were a few micro scratches on the discs, but considering how many were shipped and how they were held in cardboard sleeves this was acceptable.

Only one disc had what I would have considered (for a one or 2 disc set) an unacceptable amount of scratching, however it played perfectly on my 8 year old finicky Pioneer DVD player -- so I kept it -- it was one of the bonus discs with exclusive featurettes on it, and since I didn't want to return the other 53 good discs and the perfect condition Box, I feel that it was an acceptable compromise.

Anyway, content wise this set is a treat! I have already watched Season 1 and am working through them as fast as I can. One thing I wanted to mention were the Director's Series episodes on the exclusive discs listed as special features -- I was under the impression they were normal episodes with director's commentary -- better still they are indepth making of episode shows -- and really interesting.

2905608,2,B000TJBNHQ,"Stargate SG-1 the tv show itself gets five stars.  Because of MGM's packaging, this product gets only two.

I ordered this item while it was offered at a deep discount.  Before reading any of the reviews, I completed my order.  A day after I placed the order, as an afterthought, I went back and read the reviews.  To my horror, I read complaint after complaint about the way the item was packaged by MGM.  I was anxious and nervous about receiving my order.  Would it be fine?

The discs are contained in two cardboard cases.  Each case accordions/folds out.  Each ""page"" contains three cardboard pockets in a vertical row which hold the discs.  The discs are pushed into the cardboard sleeve, leaving half the disc exposed.

Following the advice from the other reviews, I inspected every disc.  Every single one of the discs in the set I received had minor surface scratches.  Three of the discs were scratched in a circular pattern.  Luckily, the scratches weren't deep.  The three discs I was most concerned about were playable.  One disc had dried glue residue from the glue used to hold the cardboard together.

If my box had been handled any more rough during shipment... If my box had one less bit of packaging...If while on my doorstep a squirrel decided to climb on the box... those three discs would have rattled around just enough to have been completely ruined.

Buying a brand new DVD set, I expect mint condition DVD's.  Any customer would.  If I had any confidence that a replacement set would arrive in any better condition, I would have requested it.

If you do decide to purchase this set, upon delivery immediately inspect every disc.  Test any disc you feel may not play properly.  Purchase a DVD/CD wallet, and transfer the discs to it. Do not store your discs in the OEM packaging.

Some MGM product designer should have their head examined for conceiving such a complicated, cardboard, oragami-esque, contraption instead of using a standard plastic multi DVD case.  Why look for a complex solution, when a simple solution will suffice?",1229385600,2,2059,4.778409090909091

The packaging for this particular series, however, stinks out loud.

The rating is an average of the 5 stars I give the show, and the -4 stars I give the packaging.

Episode after episode of the disks in this boxed set are scratched beyond repair. I feel I've utterly wasted my money, and hope that the company will be able to replace the damaged disks. (Because I bought them so long ago, and just finally got around to watching it, I can't return it.)

If you're interested in buying this show, I highly recommend it, but go for the individual seasons, not for this abomination of a package. (Only Seasons 1 and 2 of ""Sliders"" were worse than this. Great looks, horrendous function.)",1229385600,3,940,4.783950617283951

Before I purchased the set I read the issues and assumed it was isolated.  So I rolled the dice, and my set also had the scratches.  One disc, Season 5 disc 5, was mostly unwatchable.  Other discs had skips and lockups.  So rather than return to Amazon and get another damaged set I returned it to Fox Home Video and arranged a swap.  After 5 weeks I got my replacement and it too had the same problem, just not as severe. Customer service does not know of the problem or they do not acknowledge it.  So be warned -- you might have a few episodes you cannot watch due to the scratches.
For my .2c on the show, I wasn't a watcher when it was running weekly.

2905626,5,B000TJBNHQ,"Stargate SG-1 is by far the best show out there. The creativity that went into it is almost unmatched. What is unique about Stargate SG-1 is that it takes the idea of inter-planetary travel to a level never-before-seen in sci-fi.

The storyline is about a special branch of the U.S. Air Force that travels to distant planets through a stargate, a device that creates wormholes to other stargates. The series focuses on four main character: Jack O'Neill, Samantha Carter, Daniel Jackson, and an alien friend named Teal'c.

What is amazing is that the show never gets old, even after 10 seasons.

However, I was a bit disappointed when Richard Dean Anderson, who plays Jack O'Neill, was replaced in Season 9-10 by Ben Browder, who plays the character Cameron Mitchell.

Another warning: The packaging for The Complete Series Collection is rough on the DVDs. Some of mine were scratched, but they still played. However, I read that some other recipients were not as lucky.

Anyway, the show is a great addition to any DVD collection.",1226707200,,1030,4.896551724137931
2905627,5,B000TJBNHQ,"During it's extraordinary 10-year run, ""Stargate SG-1"" was never taken seriously by either it's critics, or by many in the industry, itself. The concensus opinion was that it lacked the nostalgic value of ""Star Trek"", off-beat imagination of ""Farscape"", or gritty drama of the updated ""Battlestar Galactica"" or even it's own spin-off, ""Stargate Atlantis"", and that it was little more than lightweight weekly silliness. This is a shame, and completely unwarranted; after viewing the entire series, in ""Stargate SG-1 - The Complete Series Collection"", I can honestly say I've seldom enjoyed myself more!

It's hard to keep a review of a ten-season collection brief, but allow me to single out praise to Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright, who took the framework of the original ""Stargate"" movie, and actually improved upon it, adding terrific characters (Amanda Tapping as brilliant Air Force officer Samantha Carter, and Christopher Judge as stoic alien warrior, Teal'c), finding an actor equally as gifted as the film's James Spader, for the role of Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks), and, best of all, allowing Richard Dean Anderson to cut loose in the Kurt Russell role of Jack O'Neill (""Two 'L's...there's another guy who spells it with one 'L'...too serious, no fun at all...""). In enlarging the premise, through the introduction of a system of Stargates, the series opened a rich vein of story opportunities, with our heroes battling a pantheon of advanced aliens posing as false 'gods', in a multitude of cultures. Episodes ranged from somber drama, to edgy suspense, and swashbuckling adventure, with even an occasional near-slapstick comedy tossed in (although the comic interludes could be a bit self-serving, at times). Making things even better was the series' present-day setting, giving viewers an increased sense of involvement, as well as the dramatic possibilities of current global politics (wonderfully personified by guest appearances by Ronny Cox and William Devane). The special effects were extraordinary (that the series was never honored for them in America is beyond comprehension!), and the score, by Joel Goldsmith, frequently enchanting.

Most remarkably, the series never lost a beat when Anderson, and key supporting star Don S. Davis, left the series (other than occasional 'guest' appearances). Anderson's replacement, ""Farscape's"" Ben Browder, proved every bit as funny, physical, and charismatic, and Beau Bridges, as the new boss, combined Davis' authority with a warmth uniquely his own. The addition of another ""Farscape"" alum, Claudia Black, increased both the humor and sexiness of the proceedings, as a fast-talking alien con woman, wrapped up in both the storyline, and Daniel Jackson's life. These last two seasons, with the near-omnipotent Ori, Arthurian legends, and intergalactic battles, is heady stuff, indeed, despite a few 'clunker' episodes!

Tons of Special Features, fascinating episode commentaries, even fan convention footage with cast members, all enrich the collection, lifting it far above nearly every other series compilation you can buy. I should warn you, however, if you plan on viewing this with small children, the pilot episode does have full-frontal female nudity (I believe Showtime, where it first aired, hoped to market the series as more 'adult'...a decision which, thankfully, never went any further than the pilot).

This collection isn't cheap, but is worth every penny if you love a great adventure series with an outstanding cast.

2905630,3,B000TJBNHQ,"That I'm a fan of the show should come as no surprise, considering that I bought the complete series.
The 50-odd disks come in a nice embossed cardboard box, with an extruded 'Stargate' on the front. From there, the presentation jumps the rails in a hurry. Once inside the box, you'll discover 2 cardboard books of disks. Rather than set the books up with conventional pages, the books unfold in a cumbersome, multi-folded, gate fold. Each facet of this double-sided arrangement holds 3 disks in tight fitting pockets. It's here that the scratched disk phenomenon arises. (So far, my set has escaped the problem.)

The double-sided, multi-folded booklets make searching for a specific disk awkward, but they haven't completely turned the set into a mockery of common organizational principles - yet. That comes when you realize that the colors of the disks are randomly assigned, not by season, episode, nor any other rationale. They're just random colors. So to select say, Disk 5 of Season 3, you have to pull disks from their pockets and read the smallish print to find the area of the book that has Season 3, then keep pulling until you find Disk 5. I have no doubt that this unnecessary handling leads to many a scratched disk. Just as confusing, is the icon in between the season number and disk number. It consists of a pentangle of 5 'blocks', with one highlighted, and a number in the middle. Nowhere is it explained what this signifies. It obviously has nothing to do with season, disk or episode.

The shame of it is, with just a little bit of thought, or even basic organizing principles, this could have been a great boxed set. As it stands, it belongs in the Hall of Fame for Ridiculously Bad Marketing Presentation.",1225411200,8,1730,4.744186046511628

My set arrived with no loose disks and the sleeves that each disk fits into I just cant see scratching up the DVDs badly if at all.
That being said some of the disks were so badly scratched I was pleasantly surprised they booted up in the DVD player. Since I don't know if later on Ill run into a skipping problem as Im going through the seasons Ill go out and by a DVD Dr just in case. The manufacturer should be ashamed , these DVDs look like the were thrashed before being put into these boxes. Perhaps some are rejects from season sets I don't know, but to ask fans to drop 200 or more dollars for no less than  20 scratched disk (as was my case) is pretty balzy.

  The first thing I noticed when I opened the set was that the Stargate logo on the outside of the cardboard (not metal) box was upside down.  It was not a good first impression but certainly representative of what waited inside.

  The disks were in two large cardboard ""binders"" with the booklet between them.  Each ""binder"" held 9 sets of 3 disks in fold-out pouches.  I began examining the disks in the first ""binder"" and found a few of them were indeed scratched.  I tested them and they were still playable so I continued with my examinations.

  The first ""binder"" held the disks for Seasons 1-5 and the first two disks of Season 6.  All was well until I looked in the second ""binder.""  It was an exact match of the first!  There were two sets of Seasons 1-5 and two sets of the first two disks of Season 6.  So much for quality control...

I could almost wish - due to there being four discs of extras - that these had been released on their own as a separate set.  I mean how far is this marketing going to go?  A new release every time a new movie comes out?  This could get unnecessarily expensive for fans.  I think on this score, the next boxed set of Stargate SG1 I buy will be the Thirtieth anniversary edition - if I live that long and it's still going strong.

Also, many of the disks scratched and rubbed due to being allowed to move about in the box during handling and transit - this happens because the discs are inserted unprotected into the cardboard storage slips which are positioned one above the other in each of the columns.  This is potentially a bit of a collector's item and considering how long the Stargate DVD's have been going, I would have thought that the packaging would have been a bit better than this, by default.

On the plus side, the extras are great and I am enjoying those for their own sake - after all it's why I first started buying the SG1 dvd's rather than the videos in the first place - so not a total flop of a purchase.

Personally, I would say that if I were you and you haven't got the episodes yet - hope that with enough complaints to the dvd producers the packaging will get better, and buy this set then.",1218931200,,1635,4.316993464052287

Inside the DVDs are kept in ""hard paper"" sleeves and that could scratch the discs.  Luckily I haven't had this problem, but I'm only 2 seasons in.

Second order - just like first order.  3 disks either totally or partially unplayable in first 5 seasons.  Didn't bother checking rest.

There are dozens of light scratches on discs we've only watched once or twice (I have DVDs that I've owned for years and have watched tens of times that are as new!).

I recommend the product but I also advise that you do what I've done and get some protective sleeves to store your discs in and leave the cardboard rubbish in the back of the DVD cupboard.

2905717,4,B000TJBNHQ,"If you're thinking about buying this, you probably already like the series and don't need me to tell you how great it is. So, instead, I'll tell you about the thing that was a real sticking point for me before I finally just decided to take the plunge: Packaging. Just how useful was it?

First and foremost, this is an amazing space-saver. Width-wise, it's about like setting two regular-sized seasons next to two slim-pack seasons. It's about a quarter-inch taller than the big boxes and about half-inch deeper. The actual measurements, if that's easier are 8 1/4"" wide x 6 1/4"" deep x 8"" high.

The top easily lifts off the box and inside is the booklet telling what's on each disc and two sleeves with all 54 discs.

The sleeves easily lift in and out of the box, so you don't have to worry about tugging and pulling on them, but they're also not exactly user-friendly.

The both look exactly the same, so it's kind of a crap shoot as to whether or not you have the one with seasons 1-5 or the one with seasons 6-10. I suppose there are ways around that either by marking them or just by remembering how you returned them after each use, and I wouldn't complain about it all except the sleeves themselves are a little unwieldly.

They don't turn like pages of a book, and they don't just straighten out -- you practically have to unfurl them like giant sails or something. It's awkward and once everything's unfolded you still have to flip this string of cardboard panels over to get to half of them. And of the three times I tried the whole thing, a disc fell out of its sleeve twice. Granted, I was sitting cross-legged on my bed, so perhaps if I were at a table, desk or even the floor it might have gone easier.

As for the discs, some slide out easily and others stayed quite firm. I'm kind of nervous about scratching, because each panel has three pockets with one disc in each pocket, and they overlap. You can generally see the season of at least one disc, so it stands to reason that the surrounding discs will be the same season, but you still have to slide them partway out to figure out what disc you're looking at. And sometimes it can be kind of confusing because the discs are all labeled just like they were as sold individually -- with season, disc number and volume (when bought individually, each box comprises a number of cases or 'volumes' and each case/volume has two discs). It's really easy to accidentally grab the wrong disc.

But I've heard other people comment about the wacky sleeves, and they say you get used to them -- I haven't watched enough to make a decision yet -- and I've also heard people say they've just gotten some CD-wallets that fit in the box and tossed the sleeves if they were worried about scratches.

So, there are some good things and some less good things about this boxed set, but if you ask me, it's all worth it, if for no other reason than the enormous space-saving capabilities. I had nine seasons (which I've since sold to recoup part of the cost) and they filled my entertainment unit. This pretty box fits nicely as a centerpiece on one shelf, leaving plenty of room for other things.",1210809600,4,3148,4.453125

The character interaction and the way they challenge each other is wonderful and the humor especially of Richard Dean Anderson is CLASSIC. I laugh from every episode, and on many more than one occasions have gotten just a wee bit teary eyed.

One word of caution however, I bought the full set and as others have said in their reviews, there are plenty of scratches on the disks from the poor packaging. The only good thing is that my DVD player is veryu new and can pretty much play over gouges if it needs to. I've been through at least half of the disks now with only one small stutter.

Being able to watch this as a continuous adventure, I can understand and appreciate the stories and characters so much better.  I bought this during one of Amazon's good sales, knowing that I could rely on them if I had to return this.  With so many negative reviews about damage, I wondered what the condition of the disks would be.  The first set had a duplicate and a missing disk, so when I contacted them, Amazon quickly sent out another (much thanks), and I held onto the first set for a couple days so I could hopefully come up with one good set with the least amount of scratches.  So far, so good...I've watched about 3 seasons and only had one temporary problem...the first five mins of one episode kept breaking up, but after I cleaned the disk with glass cleaner, it played just fine.  I did keep the disks out of the orginal ""books"" these came in, and I put them in individual soft plastic ""envelopes"" meant to hold CDs/DVDs, and then stored these in the large box.  The price was great, as was Amazon's service, and the series is well worth watching now and in the future!",1208908800,,1196,4.409090909090909
2905752,4,B000TJBNHQ,"Let me start by saying that, initially, I had a hard time getting into the ""Stargate"" franchise. I grew up on the films of Lucas and Spielberg. I watched the original ""Battlestar Galactica"" as well as its sister series ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century."" Later, I became a fan of the various ""Star Trek"" television series. I had given ""Stargate"" a shot a couple of times- mainly because I was a huge fan of Richard Dean Anderson and ""MacGyver."" I thought sci-fi + MacGyver, how can it miss? However, I could never seem to immerse myself in the mythology of the ""Stargate"" universe. Eventually, I realized that I was unfairly comparing it to all the other things that I had loved as a ten-year-old boy. Nostalgia is a powerful force. In this case, I was unwilling to accept anything new- after all, the things you see as a kid are very formative. After this realization, I purchased the first season of ""SG-1"" on DVD and watched without an agenda. I found that I had been missing out on something that, once I gave it a chance, was a worthy successor to the adventures I enjoyed in my youth. ""Stargate"" has adventure, humor, imagination and excitement and, in fact, I now find it difficult to watch any of the Star Treks (it seems I never learn!) In any case, this series has completely drawn me in and I quickly devoured each season. As I was watching it, a funny thing happened- I realized that this series and its spinoff (""Stargate Atlantis"") contain the very same raw materials that I loved in all those other shows: great characters, interesting stories, imaginative hardware (does the Odyssey resemble the original Galactica?) and amazing effects. That is not to say that it is in any way derivative- ""Stargate"" has a mythology all its own, but it is that combination of the familiar and the new that has placed ""Stargate"" in my personal pantheon of great storytelling.",1208822400,3,1874,4.647590361445783

Unfortunately, I got to season 1 disk 3 and hit a bad disk. I decided to check the rest of the disks to see if that was the only one and what my options were for getting one replacement disk. I hit yet another bad disk with season 3 disk 1. That was when I decided not to check the rest and just return the item.

The big decision was going to be whether to get a refund or try again. I decided to try again. Did I mention I was a big SG fan? Luckily I got a good set the second time around. I checked each and every disk for scratches and made sure the menus came up.

Beside the horrible packaging I really don't like the menu system of the DVDs either. The highlighted item is ice blue while the unselected ones are white. Not much of a difference there. And the special feature items are in yellow. Obviously whoever came up with color scheme never watched a DVD before.

I gave three stars on content alone. I'm a big SG fan.

Also, I am so glad I ordered this from Amazon. They cross shipped me the replacement no questions asked. I got the second set two days after requesting a return. The whole ordeal was only about 5 days total. Kudos to Amazon again.",1207612800,5,1385,4.095940959409594

This was a special gift to my husband for our 33 years together and I was so displeased. The item came from Lexington in a big box that was handled well, but when he took the beautiful and exquisite box of Stargate out of the box it was bent down the middle of the box and the stargate symbol in the middle was turned upside down. He just smiled and said Wow honey it's beautiful. I felt so bad because after spending as much as I did and of course the way it looked sold me right away so much so that I ordered it without a second thought. Unfortunately, I am stuck with it because he has waited so long for us to get the finances to order it that he would not let me send it back wanting to watch it right now right this minute. The Series is truly awesome and I'm sure that mine is just one of a few that didn't come right, but no matter what it still disappointed me no say it likes it is It made me lose a little faith in how something that goes through at least 100 persons hands could still after all the processing was said and done not one person cared enough to pull it aside and say hey this is damaged and I wouldn't want to receive that. Would You? But amazingly no one did because here it is with the shipping box all in tacked just not the beautiful package that gets displayed. Live and learn especially you girls if you buy this for your man who has waited along time to receive such a beautiful item Please unwrap it before you give it to him and if it's alright then tape it back up and lavish him with your gift of love, if it's not send it back quick or you'll have to be reminded every minute of what a horrible gift you gave him as you stare at it setting on the TV stand as he proudly displays a bent up box with the stargate picture in the middle turned upside down.

PLEASE NOTE: THIS box was dropped prior to it being shipped since the corner of the DECORATIVE box was dented; however,the manner in which this set of DVDs is being packaged from the manufacturer is the primary reasons for the defects. This replacement order had MANY of the cardboard pockets holding the disks damaged and scratched themselves and when the disks are slammed into those cardboard sleeves, apparently done by monkeys and perhaps while the disks are still warm from pressing, because I have NEVER seen so many disks so scratched and pitted straight out of a shrink-wrapped box. I truly DO want to purchase this entire set, but as long as they are packaged as they are, you run the risk that the majority of the disks will be damaged. Since there are 10 years worth, one can not check to see that all play without issues. My recommendation is that Amazon should stop carrying this set.

2905800,5,B000TJBNHQ,"I purchased this product without ever seeing Stargate SG-1 before. Some friends had told me it was a good show, and I felt like splurging on a box set so I could watch the series from beginning to end. I figured if I did not enjoy it, I could give the set to one of my friends. Lucky for me, Stargate SG-1 has now become possibly my most favourite series. I have now finished the series about 2 months after starting it from the very beginning, and am currently viewing the bonus content to hold me over until the movie (Ark of Truth) comes out.

Box Set Quality: Despite the fact that others had problems with mislabeled or damaged disks, I had no such problems. The disks were all in good condition, and none were mislabeled. The set includes 54 disks: 5 for each season, and 4 of bonus content. The amount of features on the season disks varies by season, with some including a large set of features while others don't include many. From what I understand, the season disks are the same as used in the individual season box sets. The bonus disks include a fair number of TV specials, behind the scenese features, and other content related to various seasons and episodes of SG-1.

Series Quality: Stargate SG-1 is an excellent television show. It is based off of the movie ""Stargate."" When I first saw the movie as a child, I disliked it. I later watched it again before starting the series, and at that point I warmed up to a bit more, but I didn't think it to be worthy of a spin-off. I was wrong. The television show had some considerable differences from the movie right away. Nearly every character was recast, and a few things regarding the backstory were changed a bit. If you did not enjoy the movie, I still suggest giving the series a chance, it really is very good.

When I first started watching Season 1, my first impressions were that Stargate was an average television series, nothing spectacular. It was perhaps about halfway through Season 2 that Stargate really started to feel great to me. I often watched several episodes in a day, just wondering what trouble SG-1 would get into next. By the time I completed the series, I was deeply saddened that the show was over. Luckily, a movie wrapping up some of the series hanging plotlines is about to be released, with a second movie in the works.

The series is not without it flaws, but I consider it one of the best television shows (or at least Sci-fi shows) out there, right up with Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, and Farscape. By the way, I suppose it may be worth noting that several actors from each of the aforementioned series have appeared in Stargate, with roles ranging from cameos to the main cast in the later seasons. If you enjoy any of the shows I listed, I think checking out Stargate SG-1 is definitely a good idea.

Overall Product Value: I would recommend this product to any fans of SG-1. If you already own a large portion of the show on DVD, it may be worth waiting for a price drop before buying the entire set. I bought mine when it was on sale for around $170

As for those who have not seen SG-1 before, I can't guarantee you will like the show, but I most certainly did.",1204675200,7,3168,4.444061962134251

Amazon were great and replaced the set immediately, but the second set also had numerous damaged disks.

I read a couple of people here say their discs didn't play or were damaged but all mine were fine.  The box is very nice with the 3d gate on the front and embossed design on the box.  The slide in cardboard slots are probably not the best for regularly taking the discs in and out but it's a compromise for the cost of the product that I think is worthwhile.  I'd rather pay less than $300 for the whole set and put up with slightly imperfect packaging than pay a LOT more for packaging that might protect your discs a fraction more.

As for the series itself, I really enjoyed watching them, Richard Dean Anderson is just amazing - his humour is spot on and I'm sure everyone was glad that when signing on he said his only condition was for him to be allowed to have some control over the character - best move ever.  RDA brings something unique and hugely entertaining to the character.  The rest of the regular cast are also spectacular.

I was very concerned after reading other reviews that the disks would be damaged.  I inpected them all quite carefully.  Some did have minor scratches on them.  The cardboard sleeves are not very protective - but when I played them, they were fine.  Less than once a disk there's a little pause when the episodes play - not sure if I should blame that on scratches - or just my cheap DVD player.  Even after these very rare pauses, all I had to do was back it up and rewatch.  The puases didn't reoccur on second play (one reason I think my player is to blame.)

Obviously this series is fantastic - I already was a fan before dropping this kind of money.  Speaking of cost - the collection is now $100 bucks more than it was durning Christmas 2007 - that seems deceptive.  If I was a buyer, I'd wait for them to bring the price down again.

I wish every show would package the entire thing together like this.  I'm not usually a DVD buyer, but putting it all together like this makes it worth it.",1203206400,,1138,4.208333333333333

MGM spent a lot of time with the box the discs go in to but none on protecting the discs themselves. Placed in cardboard slots the discs frequently fall out in transit and get scratched in the process. Dudes, haven't you ever heard of plastic sleeves? Anyway, way to go MGM. Presumably you assume that consumers care only about the cover and not the discs. Sadly your assumption is almost certainly true.

There are only two things that I found disconcerting about the disks.
No play all feature(I am lazy and would have preferred to stay lazy) so you have to hit menu twice after every episode, and than find the next.
The other thing is no subtitles.
Now I don't need subtitles, but I am used to watching foreign films and have become addicted to subtitles.
Not to mention some of my friends are deaf, and I could never invite any of them over to watch SG-1 even though I know some of them would love the series.

2905878,2,B000TJBNHQ,"Firstly, I would like to start by saying that the Stargate show is excellent and the Amazon customer service representatives have been very helpful and supportive so far. Way to go Stargate and Amazon.

Based on the units that have been sent to me so far, the manufacturing quality control on this product has been questionable. All the units sent to me have had one or more obvious manufacturing defect that should of been caught at the manufacturing facility. The defects are as follows:
- Cracked discs
- Badly scratched discs that would not play properly
- Discs that would not play properly due to a glue-like substance on them
- Discs that would not play properly for unknown reasons
- Duplicate discs which results in missing discs
- Discs with dark marks on the playing surfaces
- Blurry disc labels as compared to the same disc from another set
- The Stargate logo in the ring on the case is installed with the lettering roughly perpendicular to the bottom of the case and not parallel like that in the marketing pictures.

I hope this review helps the manufacturing facility sort out these quality control issues.

As for future and current customers, check the product over for obvious defects and verify that each and every disc plays properly. As I have indicated, I have come across discs that would not play properly for unknown reasons.

Update ..
I was reading some of the comments from other people. Although some of the scratching could of occured during shipment, I have a hard time believing that all of it was from shipping. The cracked disc I experienced was very likely a facrory defect and one disc was so badly scratched that it looked like it was keyed or something.

Even if they are scratched but still play, be warned that you may have difficulty selling it at a later date. I went down to a few stores that deal in used goods and showed them a couple of the discs that played but were scratched. They will not touch the set if it cotains discs that are that scratched.",1200873600,8,1999,4.588235294117647

It took a long time (with other members of the family opening presents all around me) but I was very pleased with the condition my discs were in. None of my discs were warped or scratched in the least, so it is possible to get a pristine set with new discs, despite the complaints!

The packaging is slightly less than ... efficient. There are two large fold out 'books' of DVDs that unfold with the discs on both sides. With 54 discs, that's a lot to handle when they're completely unfolded! Paying a little attention is all it takes to keep from scratching the discs when retrieving it or replacing it in the book, however. As long as you don't start flipping the whole box end over end, everything should stay in place. If you're really careless enough that you would scratch the discs as you're replacing them, I highly recommend some slim cases, which are dirt cheap anyway.

The outside of the box looks great, but the cardboard slots let the dvd's fall out.  No scratched dvd's on mine yet but I put the dvd's directly into slim cd/dvd cases after opening the box.  Also, the four extra disks are nothing new either.  They are just the specials that aired on Sci-fi, and maybe Showtime.  Sure, now you got them on dvd, but nothing new like advertised.  Also, the stand out stargate on the box has 10 chevrons instead of 7 like on the gate.  My guess is for 10 seasons.  Just looks wrong though.

I noticed about 7 discs with light scratching and one of the bonus discs had this odd white dot on it. I tested each one in my laptop's dvd player and encountered no playback issues.

I was hoping for a more professional standard plastic dvd casings with maybe dual layer dvds holding 10 episodes at least per disc, (note: I knew before I purchased the collection that each dvd would only have 5 or so episodes per disc because of the amount of discs included) it just would have been nicer to have fewer discs with better looking cases/storage for the dvds.

I was lucky enough to purchase this from Amazon through one of their Daily Deals Emails. I believe I purchased this for $180, 45% off retail price at the time. DEFINETLY WORTH IT!!!!!!!!

There are two things that are a little bit annoying about this release:

The dvds don't have an option to play all episodes on a disc, so you have to use the skip button

The other thing is the physical presentation of the DVDs which makes it quite hard to get them out of the case without getting greasy fingers all over the DVD's surface",1197331200,5,510,4.28125
2905944,5,B000TJBNHQ,"I'm going to assume, if you are thinking of buying this collection, you are a fan of stargate.  So it goes without saying, it is one of the best shows ever. To say this is my favorite series of all time, would be a vast understatement.

Now on to what most people are here to know.  Previously, I bought the stargate disc sets when they first started coming out (remember the big boxes, they were a real pain to get to fit anywhere!).  I paid full retail for them, and watched them countless times.  These dvd's got a heavy workout.  And cost quite a bit.  I own season 1-9 in the original box.  I didn't buy ten because of this coming out (and I had a season pass on itunes).  With that said, buying this set was still a no brainer for me.

The 4 discs that are included in this package are very indepth. They contain many video features that are 45 minutes in length (discs 1 and 2), and 20 minutes for the other features.  Some, like the directors series run 8 to 10 minutes.  I would guess their is approximately 8 hours of bonus features.  My only complaint is the first disc is letterboxed opposed to widescreen, and disc 2 only has 1 (mythology) in widescreen, the rest are also 4:3 letterboxed.

The other complaint I have about this purchase, are the containers that house the discs.  Several of my discs arrived in bad shape. On my first batch I got 26 discs that had a good amount of scratches on them, 4 of those had glue or some other white mass attached to the discs.  I was able to rid them from the discs using a cleaner, but this is still very bad.

I own both the buffy and angel collectors sets, and I think all collectors sets should use a similar style. Buffy takes up as much room as 2-3 of my other tv show cases, and all of the discs arrived scratch free because they use cd holders opposed to cardboard.  I cannot forget my horrible experience with Alias, I could not find one disc without a serious scratch.  The stargate discs with scratches were small, light, surface scratches.  They were able to play through (just finished a marathon session) with only a few discs exhibiting slight problems.  Thanks to amazon's amazing customer service, a replacement set is on it's way, and with luck, I will be able to replace the ones with flaws for those without. (I would recommend only buying this set from amazon, if you buy from other places the discs could be horribly damaged, and you would be unable to request another set)

On my small shelf, I can fit the whole Stargate Collection as well as 2 seasons of another show, on the same small shelf.  (opposed to 3 of my original stargate boxes only), so economy wise, you cannot get any better.

The box is beautiful, it is more muted compared to the image you see in the description, and the Stargate water does not glow as it does in the image.  I love this set, the care and attention that went into designing it is fantastic.  You also get a small book, that shows you the episodes, tv guide line, and any special feature that is located on each disc.

I cannot wait for the future movies (coming in march and july), and I truly hope MGM will release this show in a High Def format.

I highly recommend purchasing this set, and I eagerly look forward to a blu-ray or hd-dvd release of this in the future.

---------edit 12/04/07--------

I mentioned in my review Amazon sent me a replacement because of the badly scratched discs (overnighted even, wow, way to go amazon!), sadly this brought new attention to details I did not notice prior.

First, the new box I got, most every disc was perfect, the packaging arrived pristine (minus the fact that the box seems to be of lesser quality (coloring wise) and the logo is on sideways).  The part about the case stinks, because my original box was smashed on the sides thanks to UPS, so I either keep it (damage is minimal) or go with the box with the cockeyed logo (no thanks).

On to another problem.  As I said, this new box set, almost every disc was pristine. There were disc's with scratches, but very very few (maybe 5, and those were very light surface scratches, most every other disc was mint!).  What I noticed upon replacing damaged discs with those that were not, was the new discs (and my old) had different printing.  Some had that cheap hong kong bootleg copy coloring going on, while other were perfect, deeply saturated, and sharp.  What is sad is many of my damaged discs from my first batch where sharp, and the replacements seemed to be incredibly dull and blurry (not the picture quality, I have yet to check that on these new discs, but I doubt those are changed).

It seems the studio is using different companies to produce these box sets.  Discs in each set are both faded, and sharp (different discs throughout the set),  on their own, they are un-noticeable.  but when you stack them up with a duplicate set, or your older disc's, it becomes increasingly obvious.

Shame on this company for not having better quality control and using the same printing throughout!",1196640000,59,5017,4.450164293537788
2905945,4,B000TJBNHQ,"I've been enjoying the Stargate universe since the movie that started it off first aired. I already own the first seven seasons but they are in the big box sets and take up way too much room so they'll be going to a friend or sold.

Plenty of extras including all of the Atlantis/spin-off specials (not the episodes but the introduction and coming features type stuff), interviews and behind the scenes specials SciFi channel did through the decade that the show aired. A nice little booklet that lists the contents for all the discs with a synopsis of each episode and whatever special content is on the disc.

The packaging is decent enough but nothing special. I've never cared much for storing discs in cardboard pockets when they could've done with spindles or at least envelopes or lined pockets. This is better than most that use flat unsurfaced cardboard instead this is a glossy cardboard that has been folded to help separate the discs from each other and the packaging. Even though this is an improvement I removed a star for the packaging since some already show scratching/scuffing (not enough to stop them from playing but a sign of things to come).

I also purchased MASH which is UNFORTUNATELY packaged in slide in sleeves like SG 1.  The first thing I did was to buy a 50 pack of DVD sleeves, and remove the disks from the package.  Even pre-use the disks had lots of tiny scratches, but fortunately they played.  NO DISK SHOULD BE PACKAGED THIS WAY.  For hundreds of dollars, you'd think they could put together a package that wasn't going to DESTROY the disks.

Well, guess what, I am not playing.

2905977,5,B000TJBNHQ,"Just got my set, and I thought I'd write a review incase some people are still deciding whether or not they should buy it. To start off with, the packaging is really cool, and compact(as you can see in the picture). The problem here is with the cardboard sleeves. If you're not careful removing the discs and replacing them, you could scratch them. After inspecting all of my discs, I found that a few already had some minor scratches. I've read other reviews saying that some discs were all scratched to hell and had fingerprints all over them, thankfully none of mine were like this. The collectible book has the same descriptions of the episodes that were included in each individual set. It also lists all of the special features, old and new. The first 50 discs, seasons 1-10, are the exact same discs that they've been selling in the individual season sets. All the episodes are the same, and the special features are all the same. Seasons 1-3 still have no commentaries, and nothing is remastered. Any sets that did not have subtitles to begin with still do not. The four extra discs, have a lot of new material, and some that was released elsewhere. For example, the three-part featurette on disc 53, ""Timeline to the future"" was previously released on the region 2 set of season 3. ""From Stargate to Atlantis: The Lowdown"" was also previously released. There are also a lot of ""director's series"" featurettes that were left off of the original sets. I watched the first bonus disc hoping for something new about the upcoming movies, but they only had the same promos that were on Season 10 of SG-1 and Season 3 of Atlantis. The bottom line, if you already have the previous 1-10 sets and are thinking about selling them to buy the complete set, all you are getting that's new are the four bonus discs. My advice would be to find someone who already has the complete set, and copy their bonus discs.

Richard Dean Anderson's character, Brig General (originaly he started out as Col.) Jack O'Neill, had a cool, funny personality. Michael Shanks character, Dr. Daniel Jackson, was the good hearted guy with a love of ancient history. Christopher Judge's character, Teal'c, was the warrior. Amanda Tapping's character, Lt. Col (started out as Captain) Samantha Carter, was the very intelligent and amazing soldier. I admired her character, she is the type of woman that all women would want to become. A few other cast members came along after the first few years, but I loved the original team. I looked forward to watching this show every Friday evening. I can't wait to get my whole collection of this show on DVD. I still love watching the reruns and will continue to enjoy them!",1192147200,4,1083,4.616580310880829
2905980,2,B000TJBNHQ,"I hope this was a one-time error (and I'm certainly going to be returning my copy of this set), but almost every single disc in the collection came through dirty, scratched, or both.  Not all of them are unplayable, but I was ""lucky"" enough to discover that the very first one of them I attempted to play was indeed unplayable.  Maybe it's because of the packaging, which is a bunch of cardboard sleeves that don't provide any safety to the disc whatever.

The set itself is exciting -- but no DVD is exciting if you can't play it.  (And I tried four different DVD players, computer and standalone.)

ETA: My replacement copy is much, much better.  Every disc I've looked at has been in perfect condition, and the unplayable disc from the first time around is just fine this time.  Thanks to Amazon for a swift and painless replacement!",1192147200,453,836,4.570469798657718
2905981,5,B000TJBNHQ,"Whether you have already been a loyal watcher and purchased all the seasons already or not, its worth buying as a diehard fan. This is by far the best sci-fi series to come out. This collectors set will be a must have for anyone who stuck with the series for the past 10 years. If you already have all the seasons, sell them on ebay and use that money to get this collectors set.",1191196800,5,379,4.135135135135135
2905982,5,B000TJBNHQ,"I purchased this set waiting for something that would include all 10 seasons. There is a bonus of never before seen footage, interviews and other extras that I believe make this set worth the price I put down on it. My only hope of course is that once they release this ""collectors set"" that they don't come out with the ""super duper shoulda waited to buy this remastered masterpiece with hidden extra extras"" like they do when they are trying to bleed everyone after ""platinum"" edition remasters. What a joke.
Nevertheless, my wife and I both enjoy SG-1 and it is something I can show my kids without having to worry about language, or other non family oriented programming.
After receiving my package, I too have experienced some of the dvd's had scratches and wouldn't play on all of my dvd players. In fact, while I am happy about getting this complete package, it could have been packaged better keeping in mind the care in storing them in packaging that won't produce scratches.

Perhaps I will contact Amazon for an exchange.",1191024000,8,1032,4.701657458563536
