8654890,3,B00K0M3MWG,I enjoyed the movie for being a European movie well done,1524009600,,56,4.181818181818182
8654891,2,B00K0M3MWG,"This film has without a doubt the worst English subtitling I have ever experienced. Forget the syntax, most of the time they made little or no sense whatsoever, especially when some words were left in phonetic Russian. The movie is carried forward by the fact that the German sniper inexplicably fails to take at least 2-3 clear shots at his Russian opponent. One other thing I found not to ring true is that the German residents of the East Prussian town seem friendly and delighted with their Russian occupiers. I am afraid that the reality was the polar opposite.",1508198400,,566,4.7272727272727275
8654892,2,B00K0M3MWG,"I'll give all the Actors 5 stars . I have to admit this was the first Russian movie I was disappointed in. This could easily have been an American war movie. None of the characters were believable. When the Russian snipers were aiming with there rifles they were not cocked and ready to fire.  This was an American war love story through and through. If you want to see a good Russian type war movie then get ""The Star"". Another good movie is ""Come and See"". Because this movie was a DVD R it froze up on me several time  but continued playing. There are no Chapters in this movie. The Russian translation subtitles were the worst I've ever seen. I'd say this was a real Russian budget movie.",1458518400,3,692,4.3565891472868215
