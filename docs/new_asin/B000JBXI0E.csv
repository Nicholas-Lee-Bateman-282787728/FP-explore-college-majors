They don't 'dumb' down to kids and their music is lively and full of fun for all ages.  We have not seen them on TV but have seen them live and the kids can't stop talking about them, singing their songs and want to listen to their CD's in the car all the time. (and we own ALL of them) Their Christmas album is a must have if you have not heard ""I left out bad sushi for Santa"" !  Another of my favorite songs is about the scarecrow who is ""stuffed with hay and allergic to hay""!  It's good, clean fun kids music that educates kids and exposes them to the love of music by incorporating many different instruments and styles......a must have, really!  Enjoy!",1272326400,3,762,4.184931506849315

Biscuit Brothes is a kids pogam on PBS about making music and general citical thinking, set on a farm.  The emphasis is on making music as a community and family, and how music works.  This CD includes three half-hour episodes ""The Musical Fam"" ""Rythm"" and ""Pitch"".  A wide fariety of musical styles are presented, including folk, barbershop, chamber music, etc. (Willie Nelson provides naration), and most of the selections are simple enough for children to sing along with.  Series website: [...]
I don't have children and I still enjoy watching it.  It has the old-school sesame street format with educational segments, humorous segments, animation, puppets, etc.  The pace is not as frenetic as some other newer childrens programs. It's a new show and not in many PBS markets yet.  DVD vol. III has their 3 Emmy-winning episodes.",1241308800,3,897,4.94
