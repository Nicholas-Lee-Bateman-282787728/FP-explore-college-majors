8261744,5,B001690X3S,"There's an excellent documentary out there about Black opera singers.  My little sister once sat glued to the TV because it showed a documentary about Black cheerleaders and their white coach said, ""These girls didn't grow up with gymnastics and ballet classes.  They lack training that many whites have.""  This documentary was about the first and only Black lacrosse team at an historically-Black college.  If you are interested in Blacks who do things not typically associated with their group, then you will enjoy this.

This documentary won't ""intimidate"" white viewers either.  A huge chunk of the interviewees are white.  The coach is white and the Black players were in awe of him.  White players recruited for the team also spoke.  Many viewers may be reminded of Cougar from ""A Diff'rent World"" or Affirmative Action from ""Drumline"" in seeing this.  The work also tries to break the Black-white paradigm by repeating that lacrosse was invented by Native Americans.  One interviewee may have been a member of the Iroquois Nation.

This work differs as Black players admitted their shortcomings.  They knew they weren't as experienced as white teams.  Also they said they chose to use fear-of-Blacks to their advantage onthe field.  Whether in baseball, the Congress, or most institutions, rather than staying away from pioneering Blacks, white teams wanted to play them.  However, this was because they assumed they could beat them.

The work never addresses the issue of authenticity.  The aforementioned opera documentary had singers addressing Blacks who would deem singing opera as selling out.  In ""Black Is, Black Ain't,"" Dr. Angela Davis remembered that Blacks criticized her for studying German and pursuing a doctorate.  The question, ""Why would you want to play lacrosse, rather than basketball or something else beloved in the Black community?"" never comes up here.  The answer may lie in the regional specificity of lacrosse.  The documentary covers Baltimore and says the sport is big there.  Perhaps Black students and community leaders were familiar with the sport and didn't deem it as foreign to the culture.

Politics aside, just visually this'll be a hoot for many viewers.  This was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, so players have huge Afros and long sideburns.  Even the white coach was covered in 1970s hair; he looked a lot like the main character in ""Welcome Back, Kotter.""  Back to politics, unfortunately, we Black Americans don't receive college degrees at the rate of white counterparts.  Further, Black women achieve this accomplishment at higher rates than the brothers, so seeing so many smart, degreed, yet still athletic, Black men will be inspiring to many viewers.  It is something you may want your young sons especially to see.

I was in a college organization that was one of the first of its kind (The Next Thing at Brown University) and being in a club that I loved at a school that I love was double the pleasure.  Seeing so many college graduates being nostalgic about their lacrosse team will remind people of fraternity life or student protests or being with any niche that they loved during their college years; it doesn't have to be a sports team for you to start reminiscing here.

This documentary reminded me a lot of ""Tuskegee Airmen"" by showing talented Black men who had to prove themselves to white peers.  However, if you like films or documentaries on Black athletes, period (""Hoop Dreams, "" ""Ali,"" ""When We Were Kings,"" ""Love & Basketball."" etc.), then you will be sure to love this.",1270080000,9,3550,5.023972602739726
