With software developing and being upgraded so rapidly, it's difficult to finish a book on an application before the next version or two are released, rendering the book obsolete!

This is easily the most approachable and informative video for beginning to intermediate Lightwave users that I have ever encountered. It is broken into easy-to-digest chapters, and includes object, scene and image files as well as hours of tutorials (in Quicktime video format, meaning that it contains far more than a standard DVD).

I look forward to more releases from author Layne Smith and from producer Kurve studios. (Look up their website for tons of free stuff!)",1173312000,,775,5.094488188976378

When yes, this is a must have for you!

You get a close look of the most used basic tools in Lightwave for modeling,texturing,lighting!

I think I'm not a beginner in Lightwave, I ordered this DVD anyway to take a closer look on this 10 hour Learning stuff!

I found it very usefull to work through this Tutorial (Building a 50's TV), all the simple tools using in this tutorial comes back in my brain!

On this way, Thanks to Layne Smith and Wes Beckwith
