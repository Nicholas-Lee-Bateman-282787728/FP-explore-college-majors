8338631,4,B001RPZE3K,"I was shopping for a movie in the foreign movie section at my local library the other day, and noticed this movie, which I immediately picked up, for one since it is a Dutch movie (I'm from the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium).

""Johan"" (97 min,; originally released in 2006 in the Netherlands) has an intruiging promise. Born as the 11th son in a soccer-crazy family (and hence 'completing' the team), it turns out that Johan actually hates soccer. Johan eventually quits the family soccer team, and tries to find his own way as a singer-songwriter (the actor playing Johan is an up-and-coming singer-songwriter in real life). Meanwhile Johan falls in love with a local girl, who (for reasons never made clear in the movie) eventually bags Johan for one of his brothers, a soccer-star in the making, and even marries him. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

This was a pleasant movie, nothing more, nothing less. There are tons of scenes and references in the movie relating to Dutch soccer (and its national team) that will go straight over your head if you are not familiar with them. Very strangely, the DVD box proclaims this to be the ""male"" version of ""Bend It Like Beckham"", the pleasant little movie about an Indian London girl who finds joy in soccer, despite her family. This movie is in fact the exact opposite: how a guy fins joy outside of soccer and his soccer-mad family. Wow.",1310601600,,1415,4.678714859437751
8338632,3,B001RPZE3K,"My review contains spoiler information.  Please don't continue to read if this will bother you.

This movie has all the right elements for a great story: family, conflict, sports and romance.  The portrayal of a large family is very positive, which I appreciate, even though the plot depends upon one brother being a bit misunderstood by the others. The dialogue is witty, the acting is believable, the characters are winsome.  I thoroughly enjoyed it until the title character, Johan, sleeps with his brother Johnny's wife, Evy.  (She was his somewhat-casual-but-possibly-wanting-to-be-more girlfriend until Johnny used deceit to get her to forget about Johan; she later marries Johnny but still pines after Johan.)  In the end, the conflict between the brothers is resolved in a completely believable way, but Evy leaves Johnny to get back together with Johan.  Hmmm.  Adultery and divorce.  Those two elements ruined the movie for me.  If that part of the story doesn't bother you, then you will probably truly enjoy the movie.",1307145600,,1030,5.1878787878787875
8338633,4,B001RPZE3K,"I bought this for my Dutch husband, and as we watched it with the english subtitles, you did not even have to read them. You get it, by just watching the acting and situations. A very nice love of sport and love story for one brother who does not fit the mold that father wanted. You will smile many times watching this movie.",1267747200,,326,4.190476190476191
