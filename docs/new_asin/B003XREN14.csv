8408487,3,B003XREN14,I bought this to use in my healthcare reimbursement class .  It is uncut documentary but the passion of those who know we needna chage is heard.  The clips of Obama were added in 2010.  Great movie to start conversation on healthcare reform !,1317859200,,242,4.454545454545454
8408488,5,B003XREN14,"This film speaks the truth that the tea partiers don't want to hear. The Pasadena tea party shown in this film think they own the hospitals, as we see by Mrs. Foster speaking as though she is entitled to everything just because she pays for (and can afford to pay for) corporate health care insurance. That woman is pure hatred.

The film is very informative. The nurses speak out on things I never knew, like the fact that dental care is also health care; yet many children have never seen a dentist. Maureen Cruise, RN is fantastic when she speaks out about health care and all the injustices and death we see in America due to denial of care by insurance companies.",1296777600,3,668,4.475409836065574
8408489,1,B003XREN14,First the use of the term Tea Bagger is a derogatory term with oral sex connotations -- just one more way the left is smearing the tea party movement.  These people use doublespeak -- putting out propaganda while accusing the other side of propoganda at the same time.,1282435200,,268,4.583333333333333
