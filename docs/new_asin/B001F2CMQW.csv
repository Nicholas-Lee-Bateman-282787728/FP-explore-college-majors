8300609,5,B001F2CMQW,"This is a collection of classic grindhouse cinema.  Strange, thin plots portrayed by actors with an over-dramatic flair.  The video quality is good; wide-screen restorations that are, considering the age of the film, surprisingly clean.  The audio track is actually very clean.  The restorers obviously expended some effort in smoothing out the bumps and hisses that so often accompany old film, especially when it's not in mainstream distribution.

""Millie's Homecoming"" is the story of Lord and Lady Zazu, two neurotic aristocrats (living in a small apartment in Manhattan).  The story is an excuse for the actors to ham it up horribly, playing up the adultery for a few scenes until it forgets it.  The taboo nature of Lord Zazu's encounter with his daughter is almost lost in the surreal play-acting.

""Weirdos and the Oddballs"" is a funny reflection on the cynicism about unlicensed therapy and sex therapists in particular.  The plot is a thinly-veiled excuse for the characters to frolic together.  It's hilariously telling when halfway through the picture Zora, the supposed therapist, asks a couple to remind her why they were there.

In addition to the two features, there are interviews with the director and several of the actors, as well as quite a few short loops of the actors involved with both features.

It would be unfair to judge these films by modern cinematic values (they haven't aged particularly well).  As a time capsule of 1970s grindhouse, experimental film, and blue movies, this is a very good look.",1249171200,19,1529,5.068
