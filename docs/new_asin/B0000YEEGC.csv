8004644,5,B0000YEEGC,Another great set of episodes from a awesome anime series.,1480377600,,58,4.9
8004645,5,B0000YEEGC,"this volume really picks up after the slow paced epidsodes from vol. 3 (sins of the city)hidden fangs focuses on revenge (arrow) and other plot twists (shooter). heat guy gets ""terminated"" or does he? under the ""influence"" daisuke struggles with his dark past and Vampire clair leonetti finds himself ousted from the family via trechary (can you guess who turns him in? hee hee.)
which leads to a mini cliffhanger thus leading to the next and final chapter of this fast paced series. NOT TO BE MISSED!
P.S. once you insert the dvd in your player your'e ""forced"" to hear this WARNING of copyright violation which is voiced by the english dubbed daisuke who then snickers after mentioning ""..violators will be subjected to 5 years in prison and a $250.00 fine."" i take it that pioneer/geneon isn't happy about all the bootlegging that's taking place in china,us,etc.
i just hope that the anime industry will lower their prices thus making it easier for otakus to purchase more volumes/discs of their favorite series. prices like $29.99 for 100 minutes is a bit too steep. thank god amazon sells  this dvd for less.",1075852800,3,1112,4.821989528795812
