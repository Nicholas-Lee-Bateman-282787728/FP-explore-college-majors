The author had fun writing the story, and the producer had fun making the film, and I knew it wasn't meant to be anything more than a B movie. If I had been expecting more, I would have been disappointed. Okay, it isn't a good Vietnam movie, and it isn't a good representation of an MP movie, and the acting was awful. The sets were awful. The dialogue was bad. But that's probably what makes it a cult classic.

7808636,4,6300987760,"Cain's Saigon Commandos series ran 12 books and was a fictionalized account of his own Tour of Duty with the 716th MP Bn. in ""The 'Nam,"" (circa 1972-73, although the series takes place beginning in 1967).  Not only are the characters, (Sgt. Mark Stryker, Specialist Tim Bryant, Private Nick Uhernik and all the rest), courageous and highly believable, they add an odd touch of comedy when you least expect it.  Roger Corman, (movie maker of so many of the horror movies of the 1960's), was so impressed with Saigon Commandos that he sent the entire set of 12 installments to Screenwriter Tom McElvery Cleaver and told him to squeeze them into a screenplay.  Tom settled on Book 9 in the series, (""Mad Minute""), from which the 1987 cult classic, Saigon Commandos, eventually evolved. One Hollywood producer called Saigon Commandos the Hill Street Blues of Vietnam.  It was definitely the military police procedural of the 80's - with its tried and true formula of sex and violence every 15 pages or so - based on those crazy 60's many of us who were there will never forget!

Richard Young stars as ex-Green Beret-turned MP sergeant Mark Stryker.  Blonde bombshell P.J. Soles is Lady Journalist Jean Lassiter.  John Allen Nelson is Tim Bryant, who goes on an M-16-blazing vendetta against both VC and politicians after his Vietnamese girlfriend, Lang, has her throat cut by drug runners.  Richard Young is probably best known as the villain in Indiana Jones #3.  John Allen Nelson went on to bigger fame and more aclaim as the hunk love interest to Sheena, Queen of the Jungle (TV series of 2003-2005).  P.J. Soles has been in everything from Carrie and Rock 'N Roll High School to The Devil's Rejects.

Jonathan Cain and his wife were flown to the set of Saigon Commandos when it was being filmed in The Philippines in 1986.  Although Cain was upset by some of the MP uniform and vehicle inaccuracies, and (Director Clark Henderson's) liberal use of theatrical license to change the race of some of the fans' most favorite characters in the series of books, the author nonetheless felt the back alleys and rooftops of metro-Manila provided a worthy backdrop for the film, quite reminiscent of the locale he'd once policed as a 19-year-old Saigon Commando 13 years earlier.  Cain also had a problem with the main character, MP Sgt. Mark Stryker, wearing a green beret from time to time while performing his law enforcement duties, but Henderson felt the beret added a bit of comedy to the otherwise bloody saga - and the green beret stayed.  Cain was quoted as saying he was also upset all the ""Vietnamese"" characters had obvious Filipino accents, but Henderson assuaged the Vietnam vet-turned-pulp-paperback-writer's angst by letting him ride in one of the Huey gunships that were used in the jungle combat scenes, (filmed south of Manila in the Makiling rain forest).  Henderson actually has a cameo in the movie, (as the bearded door-gunner), and the military-style wristwatch he is wearing in the gunship scene was actually borrowed from Cain moments before filming began, (Cain was crouched behind Henderson, out of sight, when the chopper was airborne and the cameras were rolling!)

All in all, Saigon Commandos is one of the more under-praised Vietnam movies of considerable merit - definitely a cult classic - that despite some hokey acting fights right alongside Platoon and The Deerhunter (the former was filmed at the same location the year before; the latter was the stimulas that inspired Cain to begin writing while still a street cop in north metro-Denver) when it comes to the sex-and-violence formula that made Jonathan Cain's Saigon Commandos series so popular in the 1980's.

Lastly, here's a secret revealed: Jonathan Cain was a pseudonym used by Nicholas Cain, who wrote over 30 books before shooting his computer in 1990 and becoming a private investigator in Little Saigon, (Orange County, California).",1146009600,3,3925,4.96793893129771
