6261007,5,B00IEBAN6S,"Over the last decade, Toto has put together a handful of live DVDs. One might think this is a band past its prime simply seeking to cash in on its middle-aged fan base who've got the cash to buy multiple DVDs from the favorite bands of their youth (i.e...I'm looking at you, Chicago). So when I got the new ""Live in Poland,"" I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The lineup with Joseph Williams (featured on ""Fahrenheit"" and ""The Seventh One"") was, in my view, the best version of the band because it featured a variety of contrasting voices. The Bobby Kimball concerts of recent years were good, but Kimball's vocal was sometimes overpowering or just a bit over-the-top in its delivery. This DVD, featuring Joseph Williams as the lead vocalist on many songs, is truly excellent. J-Will's voice is still in top form. Even with the passage of time, he seems to understand the limits that may come with age and doesn't push where he can't go when he was in his 20's...but you won't miss those few notes. The songs are thoughtfully crafted with new touches, truly enjoyable.

David Paich (exclusively on piano) and Steve Lukather are still the driving musical forces behind the band. You can tell that these guys were all friends from high school who've been playing together for 35 years.

Highlights include ""Going Home"" (with its original writer, Williams, delivering the vocal the way it always should have been). On many of the songs that originally featured Bobby Kimball, Williams' voice is truly at home. He's not trying to do a Kimball imitation at all, yet he owns the songs, something Jason Scheff of Chicago could never say when singing Peter Cetera's songs.  In many cases, these live versions are better than the originals. ""It's a Feeling"" never stood out to me on its original studio track, but it's now a new favorite. ""White Sister"" really rocks with Williams on the mic.

Steve Lukather still sounds the same on his vocals. Paich's jazzy piano puts a nice twist is put on ""99,"" breathing some life into one of Toto's early hits that otherwise might not stand the test of time that well.

Too many concert DVDs of bands from the 80's end up disappointing...either reminding us of how much time has passed or how much the skills of the musicians have declined. That is definitely NOT the case here. This lineup is at the top of its game. I can't imagine their live shows in 1988 improving upon this performance. This band is still tight AND showing us sides we haven't seen before. If you enjoyed Toto in the 80's, this concert is a MUST-HAVE!",1398729600,78,2561,4.644591611479028
6261008,5,B00IEBAN6S,"There are a few shows from TOTO available on DVD or BluRay. This one is without any doubt then best ever released so far. 35 Years later, TOTO is the most talented set of professional musicians. These guys survived the lost of Jeff Porcaro, the legendary drummer, They survived missing Mike porcara, a brillant bass player. But the magic and the energy are still here. All i can say, is that 35 is a bit too small to stop right now. So i will patiently for their new album which has been anounced and hopefully TOTO will celebrate their 40 years of career. God Bless you TOTO guys :-) Last, but not least, Joseph williams is back and confirm he's allways been the best lead vocal in TOTO history.",1398729600,15,696,4.403100775193798

6261017,5,B00IEBAN6S,"I have never been a fan of Toto. I knew they did Africa and had forgot about Rosanna, until I heard it on this Blu-ray, but now I have a great respect for this band. It is a rare thing to see talent executed near flawlessly as I did here. Is it possible they hit their prime after 35 years together or were they always this good? I was very impressed and many of the songs I have never heard before. I own about 30 concert blu-rays and this one is arguably the best.
The performance and sound quality are key. I watched this in DTS 5.1. The two songs I mentioned above sounded better than I've ever heard them. Video filming and editing is also among the best I've seen. It was a delight to behold.",1475280000,2,698,4.102189781021898
6261018,5,B00IEBAN6S,"Excellent performance.  Although I did like the 25th Anniversary tour in Amsterdam better, this was a great performance that showcases the great talent of the core of the group.  Steve Lukather on guitar was just amazing.  Now that I am older, I appreciate the blues a bit more and he is one guitarist I sadly overlooked in the 80's, and feel is very underrated.  He should be up there with the Eddie VanHalen, Dave Gilmore, and Billy Gibbons in my humble opinion.  David Paich on keybaords shows off his Moxy and experience after years of playing with not only Toto but studio sessions on some of the greatest classic rock bands. (Steely Dan, Bozz Scags, Seals and Crofts, Ringo Starr, Michael Jackson....).  Face it the guy can play.

Any Toto fan will love this performance for sure, or if you are like me and was only lukewarm about Toto, you may rediscover some songs I never realized were their hits.  After rediscovering them however I must say I do like the 25th Anniversary Tour from Amsterdam better, since it features more of the original lineup including Bobby Kimble and the late Mike Pocharo on Bass.  But Joseph Williams doing lead vocals does a fine job and can handle the range of Bobby Kimble very well.",1474761600,,1221,4.641860465116279

They are all in ""good voice"" and get better as the concert goes along.  Joseph Williams just got better and better as he ""warmed up"" and was fantastic and recording studio ready by the end of the concert.  When most singers' voices are worn out by the end of the concert, Joseph sounded as if he was just getting started and could go on singing for a few more hours!  Vocals and instrumentations are very tight and the mix is really good.  SOOOO much better than the 25th Anniversary!",1466640000,,628,4.408695652173913

6261045,3,B00IEBAN6S,"Not as good as Falling.  Drum mix lacks any punch in the kick drum and sounds thin and somewhat harsh on the cymbals.  Mix is more ambient which is neat for surround sound, but that also tends to muddy the low end.

Video style is a bit too ADD for me, but some may like the constant cuts.

I didn't get to catch their tour with Yes this past summer but I don't believe that it could have been much better than watching this awesome concert in the comfort of my own home! The Steve's, David and Joseph and the other incredible musicians with them perform an expansive set in front of an enthusiastic crowd. I do not know all of Toto's catalog so it was a pleasure to hear some deeper cuts as well as most of the hits you would want to hear. Great camera work and good pacing of the songs that leads to a thrilling crescendo ending. If you are any kind of Toto fan you will enjoy this. Even the Behind the Scenes bonus doc was well done and made me like the band even more. Highly Recommended.",1446163200,,781,4.178807947019868
6261058,5,B00IEBAN6S,Some of the most talented musicians out there!  Stellar production and entertaining extras - BUY THIS!!!,1446163200,,104,5.5
6261059,3,B00IEBAN6S,"If you're a Toto fan, you must buy this Blu-ray. However, with that said, I don't believe its as good as it should be.

Toto and Video Director Blue Leach set the bar very high with their last Blu-ray concert release, Falling In Between. The sound and picture quality of that concert is among the best that I own (and I have many!). I bought the Falling Blu-ray based strictly on the Amazon reviews that I read that spoke about how phenomenal the audio/video quality was. I found this to be the absolute truth and it rekindled my passion for this band and its music. So, I eagerly awaited the 35th Anniversary release.

The 35th Anniversary Live in Poland concert has a comprehensive set list that, as you would expect, covers songs from throughout their career. This show also welcomes back founding member David Paich (missing from the Falling show). His presence is unmistakable on songs like Africa (vocal) and his sensitive piano on I Wont Hold You Back (one of the best songs on this show). The other band member changes are well documented on other reviews. I don't enjoy the vocals of Joseph Williams as much as I enjoyed Bobby Kimball on Falling, but thats strictly a personal preference.

The big issues on this Blu-ray are the sound/picture quality and the concert coverage. The sound and picture quality on 35th Anniversary are very good, but nowhere near the amazing quality of Falling In Between. As a concert Video Director myself, my biggest disappointment is in the camera coverage. What appeals to me is tasteful coverage that allows the viewer to see the musicians play. Im not a fan of excessive cutting or video tricks that attempt to create an experience that the band can create on its own. That said, Director Blue Leach cant keep his hands off the effects buttons. This video has split screens, colored split screens, and blur effects that do nothing but interfere with my desire to watch the band play. I don't understand it, unless theres a conscious attempt to hide inferior camera coverage. He even repeatedly cuts to a GoPro camera mounted on Simon Phillips drums that fell out of its proper position on the first song. In any event, its hard to believe that the same team that gave us the phenomenal Falling In Between Blu-ray is responsible for this mess.

For me, Im thankful for a stellar setlist from a fantastic band. However, I simply put the Blu-ray on in the background and listen to the music rather than watch the screen.",1444953600,,2462,4.69212962962963

6261104,5,B00IEBAN6S,"I have the DVD ""Greatest Hits Live And More (ToTo Live Concert Le Zenith, Paris October 1990)"" and ""Falling In Between Live"". Set aside the audio/video quality, I like the ""Greatest Hits"" most with simple reason - you get to see all the original members, especially the late Jeff on the drum and how nice it would be if the either Bobby or Joseph is on vocal but that's still OK because the band is authentic. As I follow through to the ""Falling In Between"", a little disappointment as there's only 3 members Steve/Bobby/Simon (who take on the drum after Jeff Porcaro). I didn't buy the ""Toto - Live in Amsterdam: 25th Anniversary"" (but borrowed from my friends) and arrive at this ""Live from Poland"".

The line up in this ""Live from Poland"" is great. We have Simon Phillips on drum, Steve Lukather on guitar, David Paich/Steve Porcaro on keyboards, Nathan East fill in for Mike Porcaro on bass and last but not least Joseph Williams on vocal. If you know ToTo, you probably know it has the root from the Porcaro family and the presence of Steve Porcaro brings back the missing link. Having Joseph Williams on vocal is really something I would say is a correct move because in my opinion (bare with me) his voice still remain powerhouse, especially on the track ""Rosanna"" he sing more effortlessly than Bobby (Live in Amsterdam: 25th Anniversary) as you'll notice Bobby needs a bit stretch on the high notes. The ballade ""I'll Be Over You"" where the video in black/white is something interesting and somehow give me nostalgic feeling. Nathan East also add some fun with his vocal on ""Africa"".

The audio/video quality of this ""Live From Poland"" is pristine as per Blu-ray spec. For audio, I'm using 2.1 setup (same as all other concert Blu-Ray/DVD feedback that I've shared). This align to my practice of listening to music in a conventional stereo sound ( or 2.1 channel at most)  because you know 5.1/7.1 setup in actual concert is hard to find (or is there any at all??). So unlike you're watching movies where you want flying bullet effect, helicopter attack from behind etc. the surround-mix mar the music, at least in my opinion. So here's my humble gears:-
TV- 50"" LG full HD plasma
BD Player-  Philipe BDP9700
Amplifier- Unison Research Unico Secondo
Speakers- Magneplanar MG1.6
Sub-woofer- Yamaha YST-FSW150
Speaker cable- Kimber 8TC
Interconnect- Kimber Hero
Sub-woofer cable- SUPRA Sublink
Accessories: SUPRA power conditional and LoRad power cords

If you're interested to know more about ToTo, you can read the AOR- May 2011 Isue2 (it has some write-up on Peter Frampton as well), At the end of the day, I can easily recommend ""Live from Poland"" to be inserted in your library. Enjoy.",1426032000,,2697,4.803879310344827

6261110,3,B00IEBAN6S,"I have a few other TOTO concert DVDs in my collection, and compared to those (Falling in Between Live, LiveFields), this one leaves me wanting so much more.

Performances by the musicians - flawless, as is customary for the members of TOTO; it's why they've endured so long, and have played on so many other people's records.

Sonic quality - about average, or what I'd expect from concert footage

Visual production - I don't know who was behind the editing reels, but there are some really terrible ""artsy"" effects that detract from the production (jarring camera jerky motion, digital filtering effects, etc.). I was hoping - as a musician and a long-time TOTO fan - that they would show more of the musicianship of the performers, but I think someone got bored doing that during editing, and threw in a bunch of ""Look what I learned at Video Production School today!"" type of effects.

Other things that made me cringe:

- Joseph Williams doing what looked like calisthenics during the show, for lack of an instrument to play (at least Tony Spinner could shred with Luke, and Bobby Kimball could work the crowd like the pro he is), and at times grinding at the camera - bleah
- Nathan East doing a vocal/bass solo in the middle of ""Africa"" that was rather tepid/lame in the least
- The entire band looking at times like they were cueing the crowd to applaud or something to generate excitement for the video
- Steve Porcaro doing some sort of white-guy moshing/dancing while playing the keyboard one-handed (sigh - white guys can't dance)

It's in my collection because I'm a fan, but it probably won't see much replay time compared to my other TOTO discs.

I can only hope that the newest release coming this month (TOTO XIV) will be much better...",1425600000,4,1753,4.672077922077922

If you are a Simon Philiips fan get this. It was his last (at this time) as Toto's Drummer, thus ending the era after the Jeff Porcaro 1.0 ""original"" era. Although I am a ""Jeffie"" Simon 2.0 was a monster force the owned the spot for about the next 20 years. Don't miss his last big DVD. I need it for the Toto archives.

This was filmed before Simon Phillips decided to leave the band but  you would never be able to tell leaving was on his mind because his performance is awesome! Fantastic drum sound as well. Nathan East holding down the bass chair = world class as even Luke says during the behind-the-scenes part.

Vocals by Joe Williams were flawless and keyboards by both David Paich and Steve Pocaro were perfect as well.  The overall feel of this Blu-Ray made you feel as if you were attending the concert where you had a front row seat.  One of the small annoyances of this concert / blu-ray were the shots of the crowd.  I don't know why the directors of this Blu-Ray insisted on showing close ups of various people's iPhones who were recording the concert.  I know that everyone records live performances on their smart phones but why make a constant habit of showing these people in the crowd?

6261146,5,B00IEBAN6S,"This has jumped to the very top of my favorite concert DVD list, and I have over 100 of them in my inventory.
Video quality is magnificent, the sound quality is way - WAY - clear and pristine, and the group itself is at the top of their game.
Even the camerawork is top notch. Please do NOT listen to this concert with a soundbar. Use a good DAC with good headphones or a decent quality stereo to get the full benefit of the spectacular sound of this DVD.

UPDATE: After a few weeks now, this remains as the number one concert in my inventory. The sound quality of the Bluray is better than the standard DVD, so if you were putting off getting a Bluray player, let this concert be your excuse to get one. And let me add that the engineering and sound mixing for this concert are off the charts. I have listened to this DVD on my Sennheiser and Audio Technica headphones, as well as my Martin Logan Motion and Klipsch Reference II speakers... and I am always amazed at the sound clarity, imaging, and depth and width of the soundstage. In fact, two songs were mixed at times to blend in the audience clapping their hands to the music and it sounds stunning, adding a whole new dimension.

This is one of those concert Blurays that you see (and hear) new things each time you play it. I'm still trying to figure out how many cameras were used. There's even a Gopro attached to the front of drummer Simon Phillips which sees what he sees while playing, and one that aims up through a tom at him, but it's not overdone. Even with all those cameras, there is no MTV-style rapid-fire editing, so you can actually watch what the band is doing.

And it's one of those rare concerts where the band feeds off the fans, and vice versa, to make this a truly enjoyable experience.

There is one peculiarity though, and it has nothing to do with the actual concert, and that is.. the ratio of males to females in the audience is very lopsided. Where are all the hot Polish chicks hiding? Weird. Still, all in all, a SOLID five star Bluray. It's music heaven for Toto fans and will make new fans for the casual Toto listener. And don't forget to use QUALITY audio gear for this concert, or you will be really missing stuff.

UPDATE II: After repeated viewings of this Bluray, I have to say that Simon Phillips gives one of the greatest performances I have ever seen by any drummer. Ever.

UPDATE III: After 4 months, it's still at the top of my DVD list. Still seeing new things and listening for musical sounds in the mix that I hadn't already heard... and these things keep coming. I must comment about the backup singers, especially Mabvuto.... he has a superb voice if you can pick him out of the mix. In my opinion this is the best Bluray concert ever made.
Until something else comes along. But I seriously doubt it.

UPDATE IV: I am beginning to hate this DVD. It has me addicted to the point that I listen to parts of it nearly every day and I can't get some of the songs out of my head. Yikes!

UPDATE V: The band's performance of ""Africa"" on this DVD is simply stunning. At the end of the song it will have you saying ""Wow!""
Also, in the final song ""Home Of The Brave"", towards the end of that song, Simon does a brief drum roll on a tom that reaches so low that it will test the bass limits of your headphones or speakers to the max. When ""Home Of The Brave "" ends and the concert is over, it will leave you musically exhausted. Simply incredible.

UPDATE VI: I have been watching for many months now and the biggest thing that emerged from this concert, besides the outstanding performances by everyone involved, is guitarist Steve Lukather. Each and every song has him doing things, whether up front or in the background, that are simply amazing, especially in the background doing tiny riffs and fills and god-knows-what-else... constantly. When the focus is off of him, if you listen carefully you can hear his guitar poking and peeking all over the map. This is one VERY talented dude.",1413936000,4,3986,4.382949932341002

6261156,5,B00IEBAN6S,"I saw Toto about the time that they recorded this performance when they too a wrong turn at Albuquerque and ended up in Wilmington, Delaware. The band is known to have heaps of talent and always tight as an ensemble but what turned me into a fanatic was the perfection of sound. Though loud, everything was where it belonged in the spectrum. Vocals rang out clearly, solos commanded your attention and the rhythm section held its proper place, moving in and around it all.

This Blu-Ray captures that sound. In addition, the video mix is one of the best I've seen. despite a variety of shots and camera angles, every note can be seen being executed. No delay between the snare hit and the sound. You can follow David Paich's fingers as he hits each note perfectly.

It's a delightful experience if you love the band and could open your eyes if you simply see them as an 80's dinosaur of pop tunes. They go far beyond that, a fusion of jazz-rock, pop, progressive rock and funk. If you're a musician, each player in the band is someone you will learn from and want to emulate. Simon Phillips on the drums is mesmerizing and effortless in his execution. Nathan East on bass makes it look easy until you realize that he's holding it all together. Steve Lukather, David Paich and Steve Porcaro are already known as masters but they certainly show why in this performance.

Enjoy this show and go see the band live when they roll into your town.",1411862400,,1440,4.530769230769231
6261157,5,B00IEBAN6S,"Toto deserves to be inducted in The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. This institution loves to play politics. What proof do they need more to meet the criteria? They may be overqualified but after 35 years, they still got the edge compared to other aging bands who either lost it or just about losing it. Their music is as fresh as ever. Their ability to execute the music is as strong as it ever was. A bunch of session artists put together and voila, sheer perfection.

The highlight is having Joseph Williams back in the fold doing lead vocals for the band. He was right on the money. Could have been great with Bobby Kimball on stage with him but sometimes you can't ask too much. Another highlight is having the master top hatter David Paich back and most of all, Steve Porcaro, the band's synth wizard. The iconic Simon Philips, the wonder boy of drums, can still beat your heart out. Legendary Nathan East from Fourplay, amazing presence and performance. Stellar back up singers, Amy Keys and Mabvuto Carpenter, love them both. After watching and hearing the live set, I suddenly reminisced and it came to mind that Jeff and Mike Porcaro, Fergie Frederiksen, David Hungate and Bobby Kimball were all surely missed by yours truly but yet, it was comforting enough to hear and watch my guitar hero, Steve Lukather, once again. The agility and prowess of the man with his guitar is awe inspiring. A true musician's musician. IMO, he's a survivor and a major catalyst in the band. Martini, anyone?

This numbered deluxe edition box set is truly a work of art. The audio recording and video production are par excellence. It downplays everything else that's out there. It marks the band's commemorative 35th anniversary celebration (not to mention David Paich's 60th birthday) done in live format at Atlas Arena in Lodz, Poland. You have a two CD set, a DVD disc and a Blu-ray disc all packed in one 60-page hardcover book containing concert photos, insights, commentaries and production liner notes of the band. Truly awesome!

Not everything Toto have released over the years was stellar ...  but this is a top notch lineup with the very best rock/pop musicians in the world (short of Jeff and Mike Porcaro, who are dearly missed), playing a unique selection of their songs with heart, passion and incredible mastery of their instruments.

6261196,5,B00IEBAN6S,"As the end of the glorious seventies came into view and gave way to the eighties, a new band took the world by a storm.  The band was Toto and few ensembles in the history of recorded music have individually or collectively had a larger imprint on pop culture than the members of Toto.  As individuals, the band members can be heard on an astonishing 5000 albums that together amass a sales history of a half a billion albums.  Amongst these recordings, NARAS applauded the performances with more than 200 Grammy nominations.

Toto and Eagle Rock Entertainment have released the band's 35th Anniversary Tour  Live In Poland.  The title is available in configurations that include 2CD, DVD, Blu-ray, and a deluxe edition featuring all formats with a 60-page book.

Filmed on June 25, 2013 in Lodz, Poland, the offering captures the band in the midst of a standing-room-only European tour. The two-hour plus performance features Toto's hit stocked repertoire alongside other favorites.  The release captures Toto's  European tour that hit 29 cities staging successful concerts Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, France, Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland.

Toto World Tour 2013 featured Luke, David Paich, Steve Porcaro on keyboards, and singer Joseph Williams, who sang the hits Pamela and Stop Loving You on the worldwide platinum release The Seventh One (1988).  Williams is also featured on the platinum certified Fahrenheit (1986), Toto XX (1998), the track Bottom of Your Soul on Falling In Between (2006), and the multi-platinum release Past to Present 1977-1990 issued in 1990.

With over 35 years together and thousands of credits and accolades to their names, Toto remains one of the top selling tour and recording acts in the world. They are the benchmark by which many artists base their sound and production, and they continue to transcend the standards set by the entire music community, being simply synonymous with musical credibility.

Band members have been South Park characters, while recently Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake offered a light-hearted homage via a comedy sketch around the band's hit  ""Africa.""  They are pop culture, and are one of the few 70s bands that have endured the changing trends and styles, and more than 35 years in to a career enjoy a multi-generational fan base.

Toto has revealed plans for 2014 that deliver what fans have been waiting years for.  The band will record a new studio album planned for release in 2015, their first since Falling In Between (2006).  Keyboardist and founding member David Paich recently shared, ""The repertoire is coming together so naturally it is as though we never took a break from creating as Toto in the studio. For the fans who have been waiting patiently and continually showing the band support and love over the last decade or so, this one's for you. Collectively we can't wait to share these recordings with The World.""

Toto also continues to raise awareness for ALS, for their brother and friend, Mike Porcaro, who has been diagnosed with ALS, Lou Gehrig's Disease.  The band commits energies towards fundraising for Police and Fire Departments of California and the Fallen Heroes initiative [...], and help the United Nations in their humanitarian endeavors through music.

They are in ""Prime Form"", and deliver an amazing show. Steve Lukather displays all his talents with his excellent guitar playing and amazing riffs along with his vocals that after 35 years still holds up well. David Paich is strong on keys as he always is, his vocals have lost a little but are still better than adequate. Joseph Williams back at lead vocals does an incredible job and it is refreshing to see and hear him sing again with Toto. Nathan East was steady on the bass.
Last but not least Simon Phillips on drums is truly amazing. His talents are endless and he is a driving force. His limitless abilities and approach standout as usual on this performance.  Toto is so talented and their music holds up so well after all these years.
The sound quality and visuals are excellent with a lot of good camera angles to see all the band members up close.
In 5.1 this DVD is awesome.

The band is amazing! There are a couple of original members missing but that does not affect how good these guys (and gal) are!

Yes Jeff Porcaro was a great drummer. However, Simon Phillips fits this group like a glove! Man, his approach to Toto's music is out of this world. Someone commented that Bobby Kimball was sorely missed. Maybe so but, again, Joe Williams lacks nothing when singing Toto's material.

To sum up: This is one of the best concerts I have purchased on Blu Ray! The excitement this band creates has you coming right out of your chair! I mean it! It is one helluva performance! Don't miss it!",1402358400,,806,4.661971830985915

In addition, proceeds from this tour and the subsequent DVD and CD sales are being used to assist original Toto bassist Mike Porcaro as he battles ALS.

I've been a fan for a long time and this DVD didn't dissapoint.  If you haven't checked Toto out for a while, or you think all they ever did was Rosanna and Africa, pick this up, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1402358400,,684,4.271317829457364
6261210,4,B00IEBAN6S,"This review is similar to the other 4 star reviews. I am a huge fan who last saw the band in the mid-80s during the Toto IV tour. Luke played out of his mind that night. As for Live in Poland, I share the criticism that, except for a few moments here and there, Simon's drum mix isn't as strong as the previously two live releases. I especially enjoyed that half the Hydra album is performed in this show; a great tribute to a timeless album. I did have a problem with the video machinations during Luke's solos with weird angles and looks and the bouncy camera. Please, give me some continuity so I can take it in as if I were in the first couple of rows.

Much of the best of Toto's deep cuts are featured between the 3 video releases with a couple of exceptions from Mindfields that I'll bet Luke would enjoy playing, such as The High Price of Hate, when Luke and Paich do this deft interplay between a Beckesque guitar groove and some bluesy B3 action. A 10 minute hit of that would be off-the-charts phenomenal. The guitar licks on Wings of Time were very cool and I love How Many Times and was thrilled to see and hear it on this live set.

I would probably prefer Bobby Kimball on lead vocal as well but J. Williams was very good (except for the air guitar stuff... I hate when singers do that). BK can be over the top at times.

While the drums were a bit weak in the mix, I did appreciate the guitar and keyboard mix. I never like it when the guitar is off to the left or to the right in the mix, and I am very pleased that this is not the case here. Luke's mix is full and meaty for the most part (filling the soundstage as it would in the arena) and I didn't feel it needed to be louder or bigger in the mix, though I would not complain if it was a few dBs higher.

I love this band and am happy they are back together, for the most part, with a couple of key losses. I hope before they release their next live performance in the next 5 years or so, that Toto consults with me about the set list for a few suggestions.",1402099200,,2029,4.052369077306733

Between them, this group of musicians has made thousands of albums for other artists and written hundreds of hits that have sculpted the musical landscape for decades. As a group, Toto has continued to improve over the years and now the band is a strong unit that can perform any style and take their music anywhere they want to go. The interplay between the band members is amazing and their individual command of their instruments is just killer to watch. This is a band of musicians that all can sing, write, and play so when they combine their talents on stage with great songs the result is pure class. This version comes with a DVD of the show, a BluRay of the show, 2 CDs of the show plus a gorgeous 60 page hard cover booklet with photos, tour information, and detailed liner notes making it an essential purchase for hardcore fans of this band. The behind the scenes documentary is a nice bonus featuring interviews with all the band members who talk about the history of the band, how they have achieved all the success up to this point, and the magic that happens when Toto fires on all cylinders. This package is highly recommended to all Toto fans and makes for a great fan pleaser until the new album comes out sometime next year.",1400803200,,1550,4.559139784946237
6261221,5,B00IEBAN6S,Toto live Blu Ray. I saw the 35th year concert. This blu ray captures the concert. The audio and video are fantastic. Classic Toto. If you are a Toto fan you will not be disappointed.,1400371200,,183,4.257142857142857
6261222,5,B00IEBAN6S,This quite simply is the best live DVD/Bluray I've ever seen or heard. From the live show to the behind the scenes content I'm struggling to think of another band that comes close who can deliver such a magnificent performance both musically and visually in this day and age.,1400198400,,275,4.63265306122449
6261223,5,B00IEBAN6S,"I'm a long time fan and have all their previous concert DVD's/Blu Rays. This is simply outstanding in terms of video & audio quality. As always the performances are 1st class and it's nice to see Joseph Williams on vocals, what a voice! Every one of the 21 songs are memorable. Don't hesitate, just buy this you will be very happy.",1400198400,,331,4.442622950819672

6261225,5,B00IEBAN6S,"There are a lot of long, detailed, and articulate reviews here, so I'll keep mine short and note a few points:

- This Blu-Ray DVD did a particularly good job of making me feel like I was at a concert, with the positive energy of the band and audience coming through really well.  Much of the credit goes to the excellent video and sound quality.

- I like the set list and the arrangements.  Even if you have the prior Toto concert DVDs, this one is ""new"" enough and is worth getting.

- With the continual changes in Toto's lineup, it seems to me that Steve Lukather is the heart of the band.  You can apparently replace anyone else in the band and it can still be Toto, but not so with Luke.

Overall, for me, this is a great DVD, of a great performance, by a great band of great musicians, playing great songs for a great audience.  Get my point?  :-)",1400112000,2,855,4.196319018404908
6261226,5,B00IEBAN6S,"I saw Toto live in Tours, France on June 12, 2013, and it was an amazing experience. I also saw them last summer when they toured the US in Wilmington DE. So, as you have figured out, I am a huge fan of the band. Throw out any misconceptions of the band and watch this DVD or listen to the CDs of this concert and you will discover that these guys are top notch musicians who are passionate about the music they make. There are a lot of older rock groups touring these days, but this is the only one that not only has the magic they once had, but dare I say better than they've ever been.",1400025600,,588,3.9915254237288136
6261227,5,B00IEBAN6S,"First, I am not a Toto die hard fan where anything they do, I would love and I love this concert.  I only know only a handful of their hits but as a musician, I believe these guys are the absolute BEST of the BEST musicians out there.  I have all three blu-rays concerts and this one is the best of the three in terms of sound, song list and everything else.  Probably the best concert BD I have and I have lots.

Technical:
DTS-MA audio track is just insanely great.  The drums, especially the kick, bass, keys and vocals were nicely recorded and mixed.  Goodness, the kick you can feel and just stunningly mastered.  Bet you, Simon Philips, their great drummer, had a hand in mixing this BD.  For those with DTS-MA enabled receivers, get this BD and it will be the show off BD to your idiot friends that still don't know what DTS-MA, high res audio is all about .

Songs to check out first:
Hydra - especially toward the end
I'll Be Over You
99
Africa - a great new arrangement

I bow to these guys, Steve Lukather, Simon Philips, Nathan East, David P and Steve Porcaro.  Toto is the king.  Apple quality and I mean the fruit company that makes that crazily nice phone ",1400025600,3,1171,4.292237442922374
6261228,5,B00IEBAN6S,"It's great to see to Steve Lukather, Steve Porcaro and David Paitch in a good shape.

6261229,4,B00IEBAN6S,"I like this recording a lot, but I must say compare to ""Falling in Between Live"" and ""Live in Amsterdam"" the ultimate Simon Phillips sound is missing. Simon Phillips (super drummer with a kick-ass sound) was responsible for the engineering part the last couple of years which was great. Also i'm not really happy Bobby Kimball is not participating on this album, however Joseph Williams is great too. Nevertheless I highly recommend this recording. When it comes to rock music; it doesn't get any better than this! It would have been perfect when both Bobby Kimball and Joseph Williams were lead singers and Simon Phillips was the audio producer. Maybe the get the next one right...",1399852800,,682,4.887931034482759
6261230,5,B00IEBAN6S,I have every concert released on DVD and Blue Ray by these guys. I remember buying the original release on LP. And have been a die hard fan since. I have every release and still keep going back to listen to the albums released over the past 35 years. Firstly it is clear that these guys love and respect each other. Luke loves what he does and it shows every second. Secondly the playing is letter perfect but still they have fun. I know of no band on this planet who are tighter? A friend of mine a guitar player for 30 years and a fan of toto met Luke a few years ago after playing in Ontario Canada. Spent some time over a few beers. Besides being stocked he says one of the nicest guys there is. When you watch this Blue Ray and see how he connects with the crowd that comes through in spades. Oh the concert fantastic watched it twice in a row and it will stay in my Oppo player for awhile yet.,1399766400,,899,4.056179775280899
6261231,5,B00IEBAN6S,"Just a perfect concert; great all around. The band sounds and looks great in this concert DVD. Joseph Williams is magnificent as the lead singer as is Steve Lukather and David Paich. Toto has mixed in professional musicians over the years to compliment their sound in studio and live concerts and the result is pure perfection. Grab this DVD and purchase the CD album as well for the car. The entire concert is covered on the CD as well; a lot of groups usually leave a couple of tracks off the CD, but not Toto. Looking forward to seeing them in concert this year as well as the new album. Music perfection= Toto.",1399680000,,614,4.442477876106195
6261232,4,B00IEBAN6S,"This show is for the most part absolutely fantastic. The band is tight. Playing very good. Song selection great. They are happy and enjoying themselves. Video quality is excellent. My only nitpick is with the sound. The 5.1 HD has the opportunity to absolutely shine here. And for the most part it is really good. But all too often Lukather and Phillips are way too low in the mix. Had they engineered this with just a bit less audience noise and turned them up just a few db's each this would be a top 5 reference blu-ray concert. IMO opinion Falling In Between Live was not as good a show as this but the audio was slightly...only slightly better. But don't let that keep you from this. It's real good. Some of the older songs here have completely new life. If you have a good system buy it and crank it up. If for no other reason than ""White Sister"" This version absolutely kicks ass! 35 years old and rocks harder and better than 99% of the mass market crap out there today.",1399593600,4,978,4.3497267759562845
6261233,5,B00IEBAN6S,This is an update from the 2001 Amsterdam 25th reunion tour.  Nathan East plays bass as Mike Pocaro has chronic health condition.  The stand out is  Steve Lukather on vocals and guitar.  Satisfying,1399507200,,197,4.878787878787879
6261234,5,B00IEBAN6S,"With every concert release TOTO gives new reasons to their fan base to buy their excellent Blu-rays/DVDs.

This time we have the pleasure to hear Joseph Williams in lead vocals and he does an excellent job on his own Toto material as well as those in which he fills in for Bobby Kimball.

Another area in which this new Blu-ray wins big points is in the addition of fan favorites such as Hydra and St. George and The Dragon, and performing ballads like I Won't Hold You Back Now and I'll Be Over You in similar arrangements to those from the records rather than the medley/acoustic version of previous Blu-ray releases.

The sound and images are top-notch as we have got used to, due to TOTO's penchant for great production.

For the next release I will cross my fingers that TOTO will make a concert encompassing music from all their excellent albums and add other fan favorites to their setlist like Stranger in Town, Girl Goodbye, Lovers in the Night, Good for you, Georgy Porgy, I Will Remember, Endless ...  (pun  intended) with both Bobby and Joseph at lead vocals, unfortunately Fergie passed away and we will miss the opportunity to hear him singing his classics from Isolation.

TOTO's body of work makes them one of the most deserving bands for the honor to grace the R&R Hall of Fame. If only the powers that be recognize this undeniably truth.",1399507200,,1355,4.620833333333334
6261235,5,B00IEBAN6S,This book and DVD/CD collection is fantastic in that it has DVD's and CD's as well as a book with pics and highlights,1399420800,,117,4.130434782608695
6261236,5,B00IEBAN6S,"This review is for the deluxe edition of Toto 35th Anniversary Tour Live from Poland which includes a commemorative hardcover book, Blu-ray, DVD, and two CDs.

Steve Lukather seemed pretty adamant back in 2008 when he announced there is no more Toto, so it was very exciting for a Toto fan when the band got back together in 2010 to do a brief tour to support Mike Porcaro, who is ill with ALS. Also exciting was the fact that David Paich, a founding member, had returned to tour, as he had stopped touring with the band in 2005.

Unfortunately, unless you lived in Europe, there was little chance to see the guys live. Fast forward to 2013 and it was announced that the show in Lodz, Poland would be recorded for a live DVD on June 25, 2013.  Doubly exciting, Toto announced their first US tour in many years. I was lucky enough to see Toto about two months later in New York, but it was an abridged version of this show as they were co-headlining with Michael McDonald. Ive been anxiously awaiting being able to see the full show.

Obviously, Im a huge Toto fan. The Joseph Williams era of Toto (i.e., Fahrenheit and The Seventh One) is simply my favorite. In fact, Fahrenheit is one of my favorite albums ever. Suffice it to say, I was very excited that Joseph was taking over lead from Bobby Kimball. No disrespect to Bobby, as hes done great stuff with the band, but he has a tendency (IMO) to go too far on his concert vocals. Joseph nails it in this show, he sounds absolutely fantastic. Having followed the band forever, this is how Joseph sounded back in the Fahrenheit days, before getting into drugs and performing poorly during the tour to support Seventh One.  Naturally, he does a great job with his own stuff (Pamela, Stop Loving You, and Home of the Brave) but he also brings vocals previously performed by Bobby to a new level. White Sister, in particular, is a show stopper.

I also have no complaints about the rest of the band.  Lukather is great on guitar, as always, though his vocals are not nearly as strong as they have been in the past. It is great to see David Paich (piano/keyboards/vocals) and Steve Porcaro (keyboards) back. Davids voice is in excellent form and he really got into the show. Simon Phillips continues to be an excellent drummer for the band, though Jeff Porcaro is still missed.  Unfortunately, Simon will now be missed as well, as he has left the band. Nathan East is great on bass and some vocals on Africa, though obviously no one can replace Mike Porcaro.  Nathan has plans to leave the band and is rumored to be replaced by original Toto bass player, David Hungate (very exciting!).

The show itself is really excellent. The audio and video are superb (at least on the Blu-ray). I disagree with some other reviewers who have stated they preferred the Falling in Between show (though it is very, very good). I simply think the vocals by Joseph here are so much better than Bobbys.  I also felt that the FiB show was over-balanced in favor of new material. This was understandable, as it was in support of Falling in Between. The fact the band is not currently supporting a new album allows them to open up the setlist.  I loved hearing the older stuff:  Hydra; Its a Feeling; St George and The Dragon ; 99; and White Sister. It was also great to hear some of Josephs stuff: Pamela, Stop Loving You, and Home of the Brave. However, I would have liked to have seen a few more tracks from his two albums, for example Till the End, I Cant Stand it Any Longer, or Straight for the Heart, would have all gone down very well.

Although the setlist on Live in Poland  is very good, it isn't great.  In many ways it has a greatest hits feel, but then you have tracks like Wings of Time, Better World, and How Many Times, which I don't believe are among Totos best.  Of course, this is a matter of opinion.

Overall, I believe this is Totos best live set, when you consider performance, audio and video. As far as the deluxe set, it is beautifully designed with all the discs placed in the front cover of a great hardcover book of photos and an essay.",1399420800,4,4091,4.446524064171123
6261237,5,B00IEBAN6S,"This is a masterpiece - great production, great pictures and AWESOME sound ! TOTO has never been better, and it shows very well on this DVD.

6261238,5,B00IEBAN6S,If you are a TOTO fan you will love this!!  As good as I knew it would be it exceeded my expectations.  It's a high quality video and  the guys sound great!!!!  You won't be disappointed.  35 years and they still have it and then some!!  The Behind the Scenes at the end of the disc is an added treat of the guys talking about the history of the group.  I love this video!!,1399248000,2,373,3.9594594594594597
6261239,4,B00IEBAN6S,"Falling in Between Live and Live in Amsterdam are far superior to Live in Poland, music and band. The actual sound of LiP (the finished product itself) could be better too. It's still Toto with Luke, Steve, Dave, and Simon, and Toto will always be one of the greatest bands of all time. BUT.... the voice of Toto was, is, and always will be Bobby Kimball. Joe Williams is good....in fact, very good. BUT.... BK is much better, especially for Toto. Nathan East, Amy Keys, and Mabyuto Carpenter are all very good. To be honest, I've never had the pleasure of seeing Toto live. I'm going by only the three discs I've mentioned above. And this is ONLY a review of Live in Poland. The two glaring differences between LiP and FiBL/LiA are Bobby Kimball and Tony Spinner (2nd guitar/vocals). Bobby Kimball.....enough said. I'm not sure if Tony Spinner ever played on a Toto studio recording but his guitar work on FiBL and LiA  gives the band a sound that is so good and so unique....... The original Toto back in '77 was a 2- keyboard, 1-guitar band and 35 years later (LiP) and into 2014 this hasn't changed. I'm not sure if Toto toured with 2 guitarists before Tony Spinner, and in reality Luke does not ""need"" a 2nd guitar. But do yourself a favor and purchase at least one of the other discs while purchasing Live at Poland. It will be like night and day, in every way.  Live in Poland: video is a 10. Sound....6.5-7.",1399161600,,1415,4.48062015503876
6261240,4,B00IEBAN6S,"Not as good as Falling In Between Live.....one of the best concerts ever. Lacks the sound quality and outright SOUL of Falling In Between Live. Still not bad, mind you, but I was a little disappointed.",1399161600,,201,4.611111111111111
6261241,5,B00IEBAN6S,"Great concert, wish I had been there! As a long-standing fan of Toto, I was excited for this to get released and could not wait to see it. I was NOT disappointed. Video and sound are high quality and at over 2 hours in length, it's worth every penny. Great to see David Paich and Steve Porcaro back with the band. Toto have a catalog of superbly written and performed songs and these live versions are outstanding. I know of no better rock musicians - every one on stage is a master in their field. These guys are the best!

The only minor criticism I would have is the presence of some shaky vocals from Steve Lukather during ""I'll Be Over You"". He did not seem to have his normal vocal range and missed a few notes. I stress that this is very unusual, he is normally dead on.

If you own previous live performances by Toto, there is still plenty of material in this concert to get excited about. I am unaware of some of these songs being released as live versions before (Goin' Home, 99, Wings of Time, Its a Feeling, St. George and the Dragon and the full version of Hydra) and others are new versions for the concert. Track 14, ""The Muse"", was a great surprise. I have not heard it before and cannot find it on any studio release. Mostly just David on piano and Steve on classical guitar. Beautiful piece. If they released an album of music in that style, I would buy it too.

If you are a fan of Toto, great music or first class musicianship, I would HIGHLY recommend this.",1399161600,6,1478,4.290322580645161
6261242,5,B00IEBAN6S,"I Have been following this band  for years and I can honestly say that they only get better!  I hope that they plan on touring in the Bay Area California.

6261243,5,B00IEBAN6S,This is such a great lineup. Nathan East on bass is one of my favorites. Fantastic set list too. The video and sound is second to none. If your are a Toto fan you must buy this bluray. Can't wait to see Toto live again this summer.,1398988800,6,231,3.9361702127659575

6261245,5,B00IEBAN6S,"The live show was just awesone, and the DVD does offer almost all of the emotions. For some reason, the inter-song talking is cut from the disc, which is something I miss, but that also made the disc a non-stop music source.
Mastering is really good, all the instruments are audible.
All the voices rock, just like they were all those years. You won't find any signs of guys' actual ages.
Some songs there has a new interpretation, more acoustic a bit. It's nice to hear a difference from the Album version.",1398902400,9,507,4.521739130434782
6261246,5,B00IEBAN6S,"Been a fan of these guys ever since Toto 4 came out in '82 and was crushed when I heard that they had broke up in 2008.  I consoled myself by thinking (Well, at least they had a nice 30 year run & a bunch of great albums).  I also had the pleasure of seeing them in 2006 during their ""Falling In Between"" tour.  They were good but just like Steve Lukather said in '08, ""If there isn't a David Paich or at least one Porcaro brother (in the band) how can we even call it Toto?""  But in 2010, the band reformed and reunited for a brief tour of Europe in the summer to benefit longtime bassist Mike Porcaro, who had ALS.  Lukather & Paich came back, Steve Porcaro was back after a long absence and the great Nathan East also filled in for Mike. But the biggest surprise of all was that singer Joseph Williams, who had been gone since 1989, was back too. He was always my fav vocalist for the band & as good as Bobby Kimball is, it's just not the same hearing great late 80's songs like ""Pamela"", ""Stop Loving You"" & ""Home Of The Brave"" by someone else.  Apparently Lukather thought the same about Joe returning to the band.  He said in 2010....

""People want to hear the hits played the way they were recorded.  Joe has his voice back 100% and I loved having that power back in front again with all those REAL, BIG vocals again strong.  And seeing Paich AND Steve Porcaro with THOSE real keyboard sounds, Simon back and as Lee (Sklar) was busy having old pal Nathan East step in.. it was so much fun and so successful we thought "" Hmm, maybe a few gigs once in awhile would be fun"" and we can make some money etc.. please some of the hardcore fans.""

Well this is one hardcore fan who is pleased and after watching this fantastic show, I was grinning like a possum eating a sweet potato. Good setlist, great picture & sound, nice camera angles and a cool behind the scenes segment as well. I can also confirm that despite 35 yrs & many bumps in the road, these guys haven't sounded this good on stage in years.  So make sure to check this terrific concert out.  You won't regret it.

P.S. On November 5, 2013, it was confirmed both on Toto's and David Paich's official Facebook pages that a new studio album is in the works. The band plans to go into the studio early 2014.  Can't wait!",1398816000,12,2282,4.213793103448276
6261247,5,B00IEBAN6S,"I have loved this band since 1983. And this is one of the best DVD shows I have seen. I personally saw them in 1999 when the guys played in Reno, for their "" Minefields "" tour. But this DVD sounds and looks AMAZING! Their last DVD ( "" Falling In Between "" live ) is really good but lacks the more cohesive sound that this one brings. It helps to have Joe Williams and Steve Porcaro back in the band as well. The sound is crystal clear with a nice balance of highs and lows. Don't hesitate: Get it! 5 stars!",1398816000,24,506,3.9705882352941178
