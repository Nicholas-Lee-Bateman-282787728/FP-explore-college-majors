8305005,5,B001GCVK00,"This is a fantastic documentary about how prisons impact the community overall.  The vast prison expansion and prison building has lead to many impacts, both positive and negative.  This documentary shows how the lives in a town are impacted when a prison opens in their community.  Told from many points of view.  Worth watching!",1362182400,,330,5.055555555555555
8305006,3,B001GCVK00,"Interesting, but very slanted.  Accually, Susanville is a widespot on a major route between Reno, Nevada, and Oregonian highlifers.  Susanville is a town of Protestant churches, bars, and government employees.  Such as the famed T & A saloon - you can guess what the T and the A sbreviates.",1282262400,,290,4.877551020408164
8305007,5,B001GCVK00,"The only dispute I have with this documentary is the number of people they say are in America's prisons (the information I have shows it to be much higher). But the film has many, many merits.  Most especially it describes what prisons do to the people OUTSIDE the bars.",1262304000,2,270,4.510204081632653

8305009,5,B001GCVK00,"Kate and Po did an excellent job in the making of the documentary.  It is a MUST SEE for anyone that has any involvement in the prison system or the town of Susanville, CA.  Depicting the trials and tribulations of those that are incarcerated there and the people that work and live there. Excellent film !!  Well done ladies, kudos to you both !!",1222387200,4,347,4.390625
