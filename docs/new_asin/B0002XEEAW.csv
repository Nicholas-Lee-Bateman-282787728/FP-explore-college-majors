8155719,1,B0002XEEAW,"I was so enthused when I purchased this for my husband; it was hard to locate any of them.  But when we sat down to watch the video, it froze so much and so many times that we didn't get past the first 3-5 minutes.  We never even got to the game!

I cleaned my laser and inserted a different video I'd never opened before, and then I put this one back in; same result.

Very poor quality dvd.  I'm very disappointed.  (Not as much as my husband, however-ha.)",1303430400,3,458,4.089887640449438
8155720,2,B0002XEEAW,"Pretty girls in their underwear playing a game of football.  Sounds pretty idiot-proof, but somehow the makers screwed this up.  I understand this is a pure cheesecake factory, but bringing in former football players as their ""coaches"" and to hear them praise the girls' athleticism during their ""practice sessions"" was taking this just a little too seriously.  Come on, get the girls in their underwear and play the game already!",1212883200,6,430,5.114285714285714
