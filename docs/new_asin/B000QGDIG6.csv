8196205,1,B000QGDIG6,"shot with a camcorder. greenscreen  tomb walls. I've seen better acting in a porno. turned it off after 15 minutes. if  bruno is really mr hunt, I now know why he kept his good (?) name off of this ""floater"" of a movie. also the trailers shown are NOT this dvd!",1475452800,,261,4.098039215686274
8196206,5,B000QGDIG6,im sure this good film would sell 1000's more copies if the dumb studio would advertise it with the legendery directors real name bruno mattei not some made up name to sound american,1458086400,,182,4.545454545454546
8196207,5,B000QGDIG6,"This is a film by the famous Italian director Bruno Mattei under the name David Hunt. I found the film to be a decent addition to his filmography. It's not up there with Hell Of The Living Dead but still a decent flick. If you've enjoyed any of his other films you will probably enjoy this film too. It was filmed in Italian and dubbed into English. The DVD its self is bare bones. There are no extras,interviews,subtitles,and sadly the Italian language version is not included. If you're a fan of Mr. Mattei's or enjoy Italian horror films then give this a try. If you are looking for a big budget Hollywood blockbuster than this film's not for you.",1422748800,,650,4.470588235294118
8196208,5,B000QGDIG6,"The late Bruno Mattei directed this turd and borrowed footage from the Universal remake of THE MUMMY without their permission (along with some other films). I have a lot of patience when it comes to films (especially bad ones), but this one had me looking at the clock every five minutes waiting for it to end.",1359504000,,310,4.553571428571429
8196209,1,B000QGDIG6,"IMDB does not list this under The Tomb, but as La Tomba - it's Bruno Mattei directed Italian name.  The reviewer in imdb finds it not good (being kind).  I do not plan finding out even for $1.xx + shipping.",1199059200,,206,4.125
