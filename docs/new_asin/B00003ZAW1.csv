8278010,3,B00003ZAW1,"I purchased this video in order to expose my children (ages 4 and 6) to the Russian language.  They watched this video many times and seemed to enjoy it.  This is a collection of several older animations.  One of the animations has some Soviet propaganda but, otherwise, they seem okay.  There is very little violence in this story about three children resisting the German occupation of their town. The Red Army then comes to save the day.  The German soldiers are portrayed as comical and inept.  The other stories seem fairly apolitical, however.",992995200,,549,4.849462365591398
