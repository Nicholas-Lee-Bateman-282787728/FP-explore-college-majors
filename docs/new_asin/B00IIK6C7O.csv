6265421,5,B00IIK6C7O,"Totally blown away by this one.  I say this all the time and I will say it one more time: Thank goodness for English cinema, if it was not for the UK made films European action cinema would be in trouble.  He Who Dares (2014) has joined my top 10 best hostage-action films.  The film practically takes place entirely in one place, which is urban underground parking lot.  A maniac by name of Holt together with his terrorist group first kidnaps British prime minister's daughter from a nigh club and than barricades himself with other hostages in a underground parking lot where he sets up explosives and demands money to be transferred to his account.  At the same time a group of SAS commandos break inside and begins the rescue mission...

What I really like about this film is that it is very realistic...(POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!!!) both terrorists and commandos die in the battle.  Unlike for example in Die Hard (1988) Bruce Wills (one guy) takes down entire terrorist group in a building, now that is Hollywood made-fantasy film
Also, the bad guy Holt is terrific at playing the bad-ass group leader, he is very menacing and psychotic. Amazing portrayal of a bad ass guy with a somewhat funny English type of attitude/humor.  At certain point in the film I actually thought that he and the kidnapped daughter of the Prime Minster were on this together, and that she was only pretending to be a victim.

NONE-STOP ACTION GUARANTEED !!!

Folks on IMDB rated this film at 2.9 stars....please be silent and go back to watching How I Met Your Mother or Harry Potter...bunch of !@#$%",1450742400,,1585,4.7101449275362315
6265422,4,B00IIK6C7O,Tom benedict knight is a bruce willis wannabe in this enjoyable action flick he is badass as he and his team go up against simon phillips over the top bad guy if you enjoy die hard clones and action you will enjoy this followed by a sequel which also is very highly recommended,1447977600,,277,4.245283018867925

6265426,2,B00IIK6C7O,"He who dares to watch this, gets what's deserved. A grade ""D"" movie with crazed sound effects five times louder than needed. The acting was not much better. The villain over-played it - and the heroin was less than a Bambi. The only good of it all was some work for the actors and crew.",1504483200,3,286,4.218181818181818
6265427,1,B00IIK6C7O,I gave it one star because they do not have zero stars or negative stars.  Another story about the smartest people acting the dumbest.,1504483200,,134,4.583333333333333
6265428,4,B00IIK6C7O,"Overall it was a well made movie. Lots of action, and a fast moving movie. The actors did a pretty good job overall. I truly enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it to people who like action films.",1504310400,3,199,4.2631578947368425
6265429,5,B00IIK6C7O,The picture wasn't 16:9 but the presentation was theater quality. It was 5.1 surround and was an unusual use of this feature. There was way more violence that I wanted and I liked that. There was an extraordinary use of guns. Again: more than I require but I was glad. If you haven't noticed this was the most spectacular movie that I have ever experienced. Amazon Prime just provided me with a superior movie so I think I realize that Amazon will provide me with superior product in all aspects of my shopping experience.,1503100800,4,522,4.5638297872340425
6265430,2,B00IIK6C7O,"a grade b English action movie, diehard inspired. Shot mostly in a parking garage to save money, I would guess. Pretty predictable. Some OK action. The English accents help give it a bit of class over a similar USA flick. I have seen worse on amazon, but I think this is probably the worst amazon movie I watched all the way through.",1502668800,2,333,4.387096774193548
6265431,1,B00IIK6C7O,"I am now about half way through the movie and it is the worst depiction of the SAS I have ever seen.  No weapons control, no communication, no team tactics; no wonder the bad guys wiped most of them out to this point.  It is painfully clear that the Brits have no idea how to make this type of movie.  They should have at least had some professional consultants.  I would not recommend this movie.",1502409600,3,397,4.253333333333333
6265432,4,B00IIK6C7O,"On Christmas Eve, the prime ministers daughter (Christina Bellavia) is kidnapped, along with some of her friends. They are taken to an underground parking/office complex which is made secured. A team of SAS go into the facility to confront the bad guys, who are every bit as proficient as them. Tom Benedict Knight leads the SAS group. However the reason to watch the film is the dark comedy of sociopath Simon Phillips who holds people hostage, gives them hope, then a bullet.

There are grindhouse moments in the film with few slow scenes. The downfall of the film is the reason for the whole operation and the generic class warfare speeches spewed by Phillips toward the end.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity. 3 1/2 stars on the strength of Phillips' performance.",1477958400,,776,4.827067669172933
8642353,4,B00IIK6C7O,"Insane, dramatic plot with lots of action and extreme brutality. Yes, it is unrealistic, but most movies are. If you want an action movie with good actors, this is it. If you want an accurate SAS movie, look elsewhere.",1532390400,,218,4.615384615384615
8642354,1,B00IIK6C7O,"What did I just watch?  The SAS, one of the premier anti-terrorist organizations on the planet, were apparently never taught ""Hey, look behind you!""  Supposedly highly trained experts are constantly surprised from behind by thugs, and seem unable to hit a target at anything beyond contact range.  Worse, their leader seems to want to regularly forget that he has weapons on him and, instead, must engage in kung fu battles with various baddies (one of whom is a 100 pound supermodel, who manages to toss him around like a ragdoll.)  The final indignity is that the ""hero"" has to be saved by a teenage waif.  Ghastly.",1510272000,,617,4.783018867924528
8642355,2,B00IIK6C7O,"Not a peer for either movie its related too, just watch the Raid again.
The shuttery, acid trip fades between scenes were unnecessary, fight scenes were rare and not very in depth.",1507420800,,180,4.65625

8642358,3,B00IIK6C7O,"The musical director must have had a good time. 3 stars for the musical support. 2 stars for the movie is about right.
The movie was offered through Amazon Prime.",1506556800,,162,4.433333333333334

8642360,1,B00IIK6C7O,Made it about half way and could not take it anymore. This movie needs to be taken off Amazon. Disgraceful and disrespectful to a great organization.,1505520000,,149,4.769230769230769

Their are no special ops guys who could ever be this crappy and so easy to get killed because of lack of planning and or execution of a mission.  The British SAS, king of special ops bad asses who have trained the world how to do it.  That is the unit this movie makes look like bunch of boy scouts playing soldier.
