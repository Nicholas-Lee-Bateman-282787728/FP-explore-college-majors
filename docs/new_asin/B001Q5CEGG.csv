3762689,4,B001Q5CEGG,"In 2007, the French-Tunisian film ""La graine et le mulet"" (translation - ""The Grain and the Mulet"") from the award-winning director Abdellatif Kechiche would become an award winning film and would also introduce the world to a young actress named Hafsia Herzi.

According to the Criterion Collection, the high-definition master was converted directly from the Digital Intermediate color space to SMPTE Rec. 709 24fps 1080p and approved by director Abdellatif Kechiche.

This film sports amazing detail.  The colors are vibrant and contrast and blacks are consistent through the film.  Closeup shots look fantastic as you can see the skin pores especially the tears flowing down the face of Rym.  I was very pleased with the colors and overall picture quality of this film.  The outdoor scenes were just beautiful and really showcasing plenty of colors while the nighttime scenes did have some noise but overall, I was quite pleased with the film and its PQ.

""The Secret of the Grain"" is presented in French DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  According to the Criterion Collection, the audio for this release was mastered at 24-bit from the original digital audio master files using Pro Tools HD.

Dialogue is clear and understandable, good amount of surround usage during a few scenes sporting crowd ambiance and a few scenes featuring bulldozers and claws ripping out metal fixtures in the shipyard but for the most part, this is a dialogue-driven film in which I detected no audio problems whatsoever.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to film that seem realistic by nature, verbose as if we are watching conversations with a perfect flow and for the most part, realism and conversation on the big screen done right, I'm a big supporter of those films.

Eric Rohmer's 1969 film ""My Night at Maud's"" is a perfect example of how it's done right.  It may have been too intelligent for some but I found it fascinating, real and for each time I see films that are championed by many viewers as films that showcase ""realism"", I can't help but raise an eyebrow to skepticism and the feeling of wanting a film to prove to me they can do it effectively.

""The Secret of the Grain"" is one of those films that does it with near-efficacy.

The film showcases a French-Tunisian family.  There is no didactic approach, if anything, with such scenes as the family eating couscous and you are engaged in the conversation, you are treated like one who is sitting at the table alongside the family.

As you hear a couple discussing the use of Arab in their home, what words we learned, to genuine moments of when someone shows up or if someone is in a bad mood, you literally forget that you are in a movie and sometimes think you are actually watching a digital video of a family get-together.

We also learn about the identity of Arabs in French society and how have some carried on their culture's tradition and some who don't through this dinner.  But even in certain scenes as Slimane tries to get a loan or even when the local businesses are sitting at the restaurant and we see how their attitude is towards Slimane and bringing their culture and food to the area.  Although subtle, we do sense the racism that permeates society towards the Arabs in French society.

Director Abdel Kichiche manages to capture this setting quite perfectly with a handheld camera as we see the emotions on the faces of these characters and it's done so well.

But then the film leaves the family and returns back to the main character Slimane.  An older man who lives away from his ex-wife and family and now lives in a hotel with his girlfriend and her daughter that looks up to him like a father.  Slimane loves his family, despite being a man who tries to not get wrapped up with their personal affairs and typically the old fashioned father who worked for a living to support the family.  His facial expressions rarely change but this is where his girlfriend's daughter Rym (played by Hafsia Herzi) just shines.

To think that Hafsia Herzi has no theatrical background, she was a teenager from Marseilles who dreamed of becoming an actress, lied in her audition that she loves Eastern dancing and gets the role of a lifetime.  But what is amazing is that Kichiche has discovered a rare starlet that is able to convey genuine emotions of an angsty and emotional teenager magnificently.  She gained the weight, her belly dancing scene was challenging but she pulled it off.

The character of Rym loves Slimane like a father and is disgusted by his son's who want him to move out to the country.  She knows he is not talkative and so, she does all the talking during the business meetings.  She gets the ball rolling for him and is a rare breed of a teenager being an adult.  From her conversations with Slimane's friends (who are musicians) to the conversations to Slimane and her mother Latifa of what ticks her off, you can't believe this is acting from a newcomer with no acting experience.  Herzi was fantastic in this role and is deserving of her Cesar and Venice Film Festival awards.

I can easily go on and on about how I enjoyed the realistic approach, the pacing of the film and also the vibrancy of the colors but I will caution the viewer that the final minute of the film may leave some people feeling content or disenchanted.  I've read many reviews of people who loved the film but the ending was too abrupt and shocking for them.  Many who felt it was an appropriate ending and I can say that I watched many French films let alone other films from foreign countries to not be shocked by last minute endings that come from nowhere.

In the case of ""The Secret of the Grain"", the ending doesn't come from nowhere but you sense that what happens is a possibility.  But at the same time, depending on your optimism or negativity will help determine how one feels about the overall film.

""The Secret of the Grain"" is a film that takes ""realism"" to a different level and you can easily sympathize with the characters.  I've watched many films with many dinners and conversations and aside from Louis Malle's 1981 film ""My Dinner with Andre"", ""The Secret of the Grain"" is just so effective that you feel comfortable, you feel that the emotions are genuine and in the end, you feel fortunate that you had a chance to experience such a wonderful film.

The performance from its ensemble cast is well done.  I'm not sure how much of it was scripted versus how much of it was improvised but somehow, director Abdellatif Kechiche was able to bring out the best in his talent.  First time or not, the overall flow of these characters was well-done!

I know there are some people who may polemicize the portrayals of Arabs in the film.  The fact that the director doesn't focus too much on the culture and traditional/cultural garb but wanting to bridge his Arab culture with French culture and showcase universal themes.  I felt that film scholar Ludovic Cortade did an excellent job in touching upon these issues through his featurette and really dissecting the film and the meaning of the film's title in 20 minutes.

If anything, there is nothing I can say negative about this film but if I had to get nitpicky, it would have to be the film's duration at 154 minutes and the length of certain scenes.  Some may feel that the final 20 minutes could have been trimmed and edited but I believe the intention of the filmmaker was to keep the viewer engrossed...nearly impatient as the people who are at the restaurant waiting for their couscous, the same can be said for the viewer.  Especially to see how things dramatically change for Slimane and his family members.  But I was not looking at my clock to see how much time has elapsed, so that's a good thing.

If anything, I felt that the director made a wise choice of what he included in the final cut of the film especially now knowing how the re-edit of the final scene (included in the special features) could have have been.

Overall, the Blu-ray release of the film is fantastic as you get a great sense of what director Abdellatif Kechiche was trying to accomplish but also to learn more about the cast, especially the talents Hafsia Herzi and Bouraouia Marzouk.  The Criterion Collection really did a fantastic job with this release and it's a very well-done Blu-ray release.

""The Secret of the Grain (La Graine et le Mulet) - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #527' is highly recommended!",1282003200,7,11045,4.723759791122715
3762690,4,B001Q5CEGG,"""The Secret of the Grain"" (La graine et le mulet) is an example of cinema verit in which most of its subject is revealed in conversations. This is a talkative cast, and the conversations are often among groups of people. The drama takes place in the fishing port and resort town of Ste, in southern France. Slimane Beiji (Habib Boufares) is 61 years old and has worked in the shipyard for 35 years. Now his hours are being cut, and his employer is trying to replace the workers with migrants. With alimony payments to ever-critical ex-wife Souad (Bouraouia Marzouk) and a small apartment in a run-down hotel run by fellow North African migr Latifa (Hatika Karaoui), Slimane can barely make ends meet as it is. With the encouragement of Rym (Hafsia Herzi), Latifa's plain-spoken daughter, he plans to open a couscous restaurant on a boat.

For a while, ""The Secret of the Grain"" looks like it might be a gritty social conscience film about the plight of working class immigrants whose livelihoods come under economic pressure. They spend a great deal of time worrying about money and nagging each other, which sets this film apart from others I've seen in the social conscience-cinema verit mold. These people are not doormats; there is not a shrinking violet among them. Slimane is reticent, but his family always say what's on their mind. The sheer amount of conversation is striking; it's what makes the film run 2 hours and 25 minutes. And they're not all Mahgrebi immigrants. One French fisherman, married to a North African, is a close friend of the Beiji family. One of Slimane's sons is married to a Russian woman.

At some point, the balance between social commentary and family drama shifts, and family issues, such as the philandering of Slimane's son Majid (Sami Zitouni), the status of Slimane's mistress and step-daughter, and the efforts to open the restaurant dominate. That isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'm not sure how much one could say about the economic situation beyond, ""that's life,"" which is what the characters say. Although they chatter too much for my taste, the strong personalities and unconcealed friction made me want to watch. These seem like real people, edited just enough to make them interesting. And it's nice to see modern Muslim women acting like they really do, rather than veiled or scarved, which is practiced by a minority. Typical of Mediterranean women, they are pushy and family-oriented, not submissive. In French with optional English subtitles.",1280707200,,2495,4.952267303102626
3762691,2,B001Q5CEGG,"Abdel Kechiche's heartfelt attempt to render the difficulties and vicissitudes of the Arab minority experience in contemporary France is an admirable and engaging one, at least initially. For the first half of what transpires to be an overlong engagement (at two and a half hours), he's quite adept at delineating the minute emotional and psychological registers of his characters in a style reminiscent of Cassavettes. There's a strong pull in the way the predominance of close-ups and streams of rambling, continuous and naturalistic dialogue propel the viewer into an almost claustrophobic intimacy with the lives of Slimane's immediate and extended family members. One very good payoff inherent in this approach are the numerous suggestions of deeper emotional interests barely withheld even while words are ostensibly offered as honest indicators between people, which does much to contribute a charged and vibrant texture to their various interactions.

Unfortunately, this rather heightened naturalism is drastically compromised by Kechiche's shift into unsuccessful melodrama, by way of crudely manipulating plot mechanics to forcibly generate suspense and push the emotional temperature, convincingly delineated up to now through ample character development, in a cliched and much less satisfying direction for the film's remainder. It's a shame, as it has the effect of belittling so many of the outstanding performances his wonderful cast contributes to make the film memorable, and which not least earn much of our sympathies along the way. The complexities of the relationships which he so carefully orchestrated and which served to move us legitimately, get sadly displaced by contrived events which eclipse this previously far richer focus by substituting a suspense thriller gambit: will things end in total disaster... or can they be saved?

This seems like dishonest filmmaking since throughout the film, Kechiche has readily suggested some of the ways which could possibly work against Slimane's plans to successfully operate his restaurant boat, and some of these are presented quite clearly as tantalizing possibilities. However (and without revealing the ultimate fate of the restaurant's inaugural evening party), what appears as impending failure is entirely due, not to contingencies of personal, social or political elements in conflict with his plans, but sadly an unnecessary creative interference imposed by nothing more than a scriptwriter's decree: an artificially generated happenstance which derails everything.

As if this weren't enough, Kechiche additionally forces the pathos needlessly by introducing yet a second incident, which not only further dashes Slimane's hopes, but unfortunately marks the film's entry into an unsubtle realm of allegory, with the action suddenly taking on obvious metaphorical meanings, an approach that has been heavily (and heavy-handedly) favored in films by Makhmalbaf, and which make his films relentlessly unsatisfying. And so the film quickly devolves even further into one in which the diminishing returns are painfully drawn out for the remaining hour or so, with fully predictable results.

By forcing a symbolic dimension on his character's plight rather than maintaining his earlier naturalism, Kechiche effectively eradicates the conviction previously established in his efforts to raise our consciousness about the human condition, through a fair range of many foibles and attributes of character generously displayed. To be fair, there is some last-moment evidence (on the part of some of the characters) of the lengths which the human spirit willingly contributes whatever efforts possible to salvage an impending disaster, but an ability to come across as genuinely moving has already been undone.

Considering the personal cost for Slimane in realizing his project, Kechiche's ill-judged narrative choices aren't just a major disappointment merely because he opted to apply the kind of cheap plot devices all too typical of the dramatic expediency found in Hollywood films. In this light, it appears an act of disregard for his earlier humanism and hard-won truths, so it's an especially ethical disappointment as well.",1270857600,15,4202,5.674085850556438
3762692,2,B001Q5CEGG,"A 61 year man, facing forced retirement from the shipyard, decides to open up a restaurant. The story meanders around his relationships with his ex-wife and their kids, and his girlfriend and their one daughter. The story is engaging and reaches a crescendo with the opening of the restaurant and then just ends. There is no denouement, which makes the story pointless.",1253318400,3,369,4.967741935483871
3762693,3,B001Q5CEGG,"The French have a habit of making movies that start off very slow, and then capture your attention, not with action, but with emotion and story. This is the case with this story about a shipyard worker that is getting laid off. The tensions that emerge, with his nagging ex-wife, his children and their families, with whom he keeps as close as he can, and his girlfriend and her daughter who thinks of him as a father, combine with his efforts to open a restaurant on a boat that he bought.
What could have been a testament to tenacity, the power of love, friendship, community and family however becomes a moral tale where the morale is: ""Why bother?""
The belly dance scene by the girlfriend's daughter Rym (Hafsia Herzi) trying to save the restaurant is outstanding. At the end, just as everyone, friends and enemies, are pitching in to save the day, the director decides to finish the story, not as an elegy, or an inspiring tale, but as a mockery to the power of human effort.
It reminded me of ""The Bicycle Thief"" Only in color.",1242691200,15,1033,4.529411764705882
3762694,5,B001Q5CEGG,"Is there a secret to the grain?

Not really, its like good lasagna to a second/third/fourth generation Southern Italian American family gathered around a dinner table somewhere in a bedroom community of New York City. The wonderful earthy kitchen aromas of tomato sauce, perfectly spiced meatballs and Parmigiana Reggiano lend a sensual ambiance that lulls these assimilated would-have-been peasants from the Old World into a cultural time capsule that transcends all the homogenization (education/refinement/development) that the New World has to offer.

Director Abdel Kechiche understands this need for Old World familiar. In his film ""La Graine et le Mulet"" (The Grain and the Mullet) his characters savor the Tunisian dish of couscous and fish as the one universal crowd pleaser that sensually nourishes and positively unites all the film's characters (North African immigrants and the ensuing Beur generation of French-born, Verlan-speaking, traditionally Arabic albeit French citizens) otherwise burdened in varying degrees dependent on age and generation by simple survival in an adopted country (France) where assimilation flounders on culturally diverse ground.

Kechiche exquisitely renders the lives of 61 year-old Slimane (Habib Boufares and his large family with a deft pointillist's love of detail that seems so natural as to be unscripted and unedited. Mundane slices of everyday life are studied almost to the audience's saturation point--Kechiche's camera shifts with a tremulous vibrato as it picks up facial details and seemingly meaningless gesticulations during family conversations revolving around potty training and marital life. Astonishingly, these segments immerse the audience with their living and breathing authenticity--one cannot help being a part of all those dinners as the tongue-tied guest assimilating into a world of family that becomes easier to know as the platters progressively move around the table. After two and a half hours of watching and listening the actual storyline does not seem to matter as much as becoming an honorary member of the family and steadfastly interloping on vignettes that reveal not only character but also a wider universal theme of when what was once called multiculturalism ironically morphs unbeknownst to its observers as `the' culture of the country.

The plot vehicle that allows us our voyeuristic adventure is the plight of Slimane. After working for over thirty-five years in the shipyards, a taciturnly distraught Slimane finds his hours cut and his construction of a better life in France fraught with the holes of regret and invalidated by suggestions from his sons to return to a mother country that in the hopeful temptation of dream could offer him untold riches. Divorced from the mother of his children, Souad (Bouraoua Marzouk), he lives in a small room that is part of the hotel owned by his girlfriend, Latifa (Hatika Karaoui), and her 20-something daughter, Rym (Hafsia Herzi) with whom he has a close relationship that exceeds that which he has with his own children. To alleviate his financial woes, he decides rather cavalierly to renovate an old boat and convert it into a restaurant where he will serve Souad's marvelous couscous and fish to the music of a hypothetical cash register ringing.

Amidst the interferences of family life in which the audience discovers the interplay between Souad's daughters and Latifa and Rym, the film plays out its final act on opening night aboard the new floating restaurant with all the passion of a Greek tragedy. Complete with a chase scene that leaves one white knuckled with both frustration and exasperation (the scene seems to go on and on), we are treated to food, drink, belly dancing and a fly in the ointment that eventually ends with a gasp and double take as the credits roll.

Bottom line: ""The Secret of the Grain"" is fascinating. Highly recommended it engulfs one in its reverence for family minutia where we sympathize with the plight of Slimane but also remember the dreams of other immigrants in other places as they assimilate into countries that are both benevolent and haughty in their expectations. Actress Hafsia Herzi hums with an intensity that acts as the perfect loquacious foil for the quiet lead, Slimane.

The story is fairly straightforward (despite the fact that it takes 2 1/2 hours to tell!): in the Southern France port city of Ste, populated with many French-speaking Arab immigrants who eke out a living repairing boats and fishing, lives senior citizen Slimane Beiji (Habib Boufares) and his friends and family - an ex-wife chronically angry about missed alimony payments, an adulterer son, and girlfriend who satisfies him and also has a daughter Rym (Hafsia Herzl) who adores him.  Slimane struggles with his job, has his hours cut back severely, and together with his friends who also are suffering economically, bond more strongly.  Eventually Slimane comes upon the idea of establishing a restaurant  housed in a deserted old ship that he purchases and with the help from his family and his friends (especially supported by Rym) he opens his restaurant that features the fish with couscous recipe of his ex-wife.

The reason this too-long film ultimately satisfies is the completely spontaneous atmosphere created by director Kechiche: the dialogue feels completely improvised, as though we happen to be passing by  Ste and overheard a colony of down and out immigrants from North Africa transform their fates.  It may take a lot of patience to sit through the first half of the film, but the end result is rewarding.  Grady Harp, September 10",1283990400,7,1900,4.949685534591195

But this excellent film also makes clear the common ground of human beings no matter the family or origin. Our hopes and concerns are pretty much the same.  This exuberant and bittersweet movie almost reads as a documentary.  I liked the carefully observed interplay between the cultures and a very different angle of being Muslim.  Religion is not the story but an element.

The story centers on the large, loud, belligerent family of Slimane (Habib Boufares), his ex-wife, and their assorted children and grandchildren.  They all live in a ramshackle high-raise housing project.  Slimane lives with his lover and her amazing 20-year-old daughter (Hafsia Herzi), upon whom he dotes.

Slimane works in the shipyards of Ste, a tough French seaport on the Mediterranean.  After decades of toil, he decides to turn an abandoned boat into a dockside restaurant.  It is a quixotic dream at best.  He seems tough, but is fragile.  He thinks his family depends on him and although the reality is opposite, they maintain the deception and dignity of his feelings.
Food abounds in this celebration of family, couscous and fish.  It is messy, despairing, poignant, exhilarating and a feast for the eye and heart.
I loved the explosion of family issues in this engrossing drama and was held in suspense through the climax

Winner of four Csar awards, including best picture and director.  Abdellatif Kechiche's film is a magnificent drama about the everyday joys and hardships of a spirited French-Arab family and a celebration of the role food plays in the immigrant experience.",1283731200,,1676,5.062043795620438

8335038,3,B001Q5CEGG,"Film director Abdel Kechiche  became so involved with the footage for the picture  La Graine et le Mulet (The Secret of the Grain)  which tells the story of a big dysfunctional family of Tunisian immigrants in the southern French port town of Sete that he could not part with a smallest parts of it.  He dedicated the film to his father, and I would not be surprised  to find out that  the film characters  with their traditions, everyday problems,  struggles, hopes, and losses  were written by Abdel Kechiche from his own family, and the story he tells was inspired by his own growing up.  The Secret of the Grain is compelling and personal  movie but Kechiche  either should have taken another editor or let them use the scissors without reservation. The movie is long with many  scenes practically begging  of being significantly trimmed. It does not apply to all scenes. Some are amazingly acted, and I would not miss a second of the scene where young  Rym (Hafsia Herzi)  is trying to convince  her mother Lilia to go to the big party in the final part of the film. A newcomer Hafsia Herzi is a born actress, and a good one. She is without a doubt a very promising talent with huge potential but her endless belly-dancing in the final was just that - endless and boring. I get the purpose of the scene but its length and the camera peering at Hafsia's belly for what seems hours, totally kills it.

Kechiche shot the film in Cinma vrit style, and while it works  and lets us actually get to know the characters, overlong monologues and conversations often made me feel like watching a reality talk show which  is a completely different genre altogether. The emotional and powerful monologue of Julia, the long-suffering wife of one of a male characters, would have been  ten times more powerful had it been twice or even trice shorter. Yes, perhaps in reality the neglected young wife and mother would cry and complain even longer than the scene in the film lasts but we the viewers are grownups, we understand, we get it - don't hit us over the head.

The film is a recipient of many Awards including four Csar Awards (Best Film, Best Directing, Best Writing, and Most Promising Actress for Herzi) and it was nominated for Best Editing which really surprised me. I think Kechiche deserved to be recognized and rewarded but I hope that he will be more critical with  his future films. The film creator  should not be afraid of cutting of  all unnecessary parts of his work to let  a hidden  masterpiece inside it breathe freely.",1422576000,,2534,4.610738255033557
