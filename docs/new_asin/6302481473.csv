Hope springs eternal that it will someday appear on DVD or be streamed somehow somewhere for the enjoyment of others. Beautifully acted by Saskia Reeves and Imelda Staunton (and look for the great Bill Nighy in a supporting roll) and cleverly directed, it is effective well beyond it small scale and intimacy. It's funny too. An ideal finishing touch is the apt use of Stephen Sondheim's wonderful song ""Old Friends"" at the end.",1464566400,,605,4.688679245283019

7826713,5,6302481473,"A marvelous study of contrasts, two best friends with an uneven relationship, one fabulous, the other, well, not.  If you like British film and maybe character study, this is the film for you.  There's numerous scenes that are quite memorable.  I had to track the film down based on seeing the one actress in the Harry Potter films.  It's truly a film that sticks to the mental ribs so to speak.  How can two great friends have such a relationship and, indeed, they do.  A wonder really.  You don't see any films with this premise and it's acted very nicely, with a real feel that these are real people.  I'm surprised it's not on DVD but, that's the breaks I guess.  Take a chance, you'll be pleased.  I'll admit, it's not for everyone but somehow this film carries you into their world in modern day England and the travils they endure and the friendship that is their emotional glue.  That, really, is what's quite striking about it.  This is friendship.  Regardless.  God bless you, since, after death, we'll all know if it's heaven, hell or just nothing won't we.  ciao bella-",1365206400,,1081,4.5863874345549736
7826714,5,6302481473,"Here's a witty English comedy with some universal & serious truths, exploring the lives of two mismatched women, longtime friends who are each convinced that the other enjoys the happier life. Saskia Reeves is the sophisticated & sexy Antonia, Imelda Staunton the style-challenged misfit Jane -- and, in an early role, the charmingly dissolute Bill Nighy is Jane's first love, who winds up marrying Antonia.

The story is told in alternating strands, as each of the two women meets with her therapist -- who, unbeknownst to either of them, is actually the same person. We follow them from college days to the present, in a series of hilarious & painful episodes, as they struggle to work out their lives & their friendship. Their annual dinner is approaching shortly, and they both mean to come to some life-changing insights & conclusions in time for this increasingly important meeting.

Let's not spoil what happens, because this underrated little gem is an absolute delight that should be experienced as it unfolds. Veering quite comfortably between the absurd & the poignant, it covers emotional territory that'll be very familiar to most of us ... and just might make us stop & reconsider where we actually stand in life.

Unfortunately, it's only available in an out-of-print VHS edition at the moment -- a DVD is urgently & promptly needed! But if you can find a VHS copy in the meantime, I don't think you'll be disappointed. Highly recommended!",1239667200,3,1454,4.9753086419753085
