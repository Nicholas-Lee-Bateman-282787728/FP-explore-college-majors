8204721,5,B000S7UTGK,"This video captures ABC at the start of their career with the release of now classic Lexicon of Love album.

Mercury surely believed in the band to shoot this video-film of ABC to accompany their Lexicon Of Love album. A fictional story serves as the backdrop for introducing ABC's music including the lounge song, 'Mantrap"".  What is rare is that these are not Promo Videos -- rather the songs are live versions of their songs which are not available on CD or DVD. Captures ABC and their orchestral ensemble performing some of their best songs.  Note: some of the songs are not captured complete, rather faded in and out of the story.  Very rare given the material has not seen the light of day on CD or DVD. A must have for ABC fans.
