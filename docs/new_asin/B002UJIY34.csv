3990997,5,B002UJIY34,"This is the best DVD, I have learned so much and taught my dogs so quickly! Cesar Millan is the best!",1297123200,,101,3.857142857142857
3990998,5,B002UJIY34,"Excellent value. I watch all of Cesar's DVD's many times and pick up something new every time. It's great to be able to watch the episodes right through without any interruptions for adverts. I would recommend getting as many of Cesar's DVD's as possible for anyone with dogs. If you are looking for a 'how to' DVD on training, this isn't it. Cesar is not a trainer, as he has told people many times. He is a dog psychologist; he evaluates the dog then trains the people to be the dog's leader. Each dog is different and he points this out often. What works like a dream with one dog may not be effective with another, but he is able to pinpoint with incredible accuracy, exactly how to approach any problems with any dog.",1295481600,,722,4.395522388059701
3990999,5,B002UJIY34,"Cesar Millan is my hero.  He definitely has a gift, and his techniques work with any dog, any breed.  You can make your dog, no matter how ""bad"" his/her behavior is, into a wonderful companion that gets along with people and other dogs.  Most dogs have ""issues"" because of lack of training, discipline, (the wrong kind, or inconsistent), not enough exercise, or all of the above. Cesar always addresses the causes of unwanted behavior and then shows the ""cure"". Works every time.

I found the series invaluable in training my own dogs out of some of their ""quirks"".  I have Chihuahuas, and they can be a challenge. However, they are dogs, and have all the instincts of the big boys, so the techniques work with them too!  Life with dogs can be good when they aren't spoiled and running the household...that's the great thing about instruction....thank you Cesar!

I marvel at how easily some problem cases that Cesar deals with are resolved....it is usually the owners who are the problem, not the dog. The dog is the easy fix, the owners are another story!",1276646400,2,1057,4.711956521739131
3991000,5,B002UJIY34,"I started watching Caesar's shows and videos and reading his books when I bought a puppy that turned into a total red-zone the day I brought him home at 8 weeks.  No one could work with him.  I had trained all my own dogs and nothing I did was working.  He was like Cujo.  He looked like he had rabies at the groomers.  Anyone else probably would have sent him back BUT I watched Caesar's shows and saw the confidence he dislpayed that all dogs could be helped.  I started trying his methods and saw an immediate result.  I watched every show (even the ones that seemed to have nothing to do with my problem) and learned from all of them.  Not only did my dog improve (he is wonderful now at 1 year 8 months) but I became a much better person.  Caesar's caring and balance come through like a magic potion when you watch him.  I even just put them on and watch when I am stressed to balance me.  I love the sets of the TV show so I can look through quickly to see all the shows and keep them organized for quick review(much more efficient than trying to tape all the shows myself and try to figure out what's what).  Everytime I look at them, I learn something new. Thanks for the love and expertise.  Cesar is like a gift from God to me.",1276300800,14,1238,4.129707112970712
3991001,5,B002UJIY34,"Just when you think you have become a Pack Leader and learned just about everything you could from Cesar.....you find in Session 4, Vol 1 you haven't.
  What is most unique about Cesar is  his ability to re-train DOG OWNERS to be the best they can be (and their dogs loving it!)Talk about your moneys worth---17 Episodes in one package of 5 CDs and a Bonus CD (loved the Bloopers, too)
  Loved this one so much, I can't wait for Season 5 to see how Cesar is ever going to beat Season 4's excellence!  Definitely another Season that has covered all problem areas in ways that are going to provide answers for owner/dog happier than they were before CESAR MIllAN-Dog Whisperer.  Bravo Cesar, and thank you.",1270512000,9,704,4.5396825396825395
3991002,5,B002UJIY34,"Cesar's way as effective as always. Same tips, new dog issues. Cesar increases its own habilities to manage extreme dog mental unbalance. This is a must and we're waiting the second part of this Season.",1270425600,3,202,4.8
3991003,5,B002UJIY34,"This five-disc series continues with the wonderful stories of rehabilitation.

There are several celebrities in this Volume 1 edition:
Mike White (director)
Ed McMahon (Johnny Carson's show)
Jennifer Lee Pryor (Richard Pryor's widow)
Eden Espinoza (broadway actress in ""Wizard"")

The stories in this volume are just as great as the other seasons and am looking forward to future releases.
Cesar, you are absolutely amazing with your exceptional knowledge and skills in dog psychology.  Keep up the great work!",1270425600,6,509,5.5
3991004,5,B002UJIY34,"I did some research at the [...] site on the Dog Whisperer show.  It contains all of the episodes by season.  I assume that season 4 is divided into two volumes since there were 37 episodes.  Looks like season 5 will be heading in that same direction.  37 episodes in a season is impressive!

Season 1: 26 episodes
Season 2: 20 episodes
Season 3: 18 episodes
Season 4: 37 episodes
Season 5: 33 episodes as of 03/12/2010",1267920000,42,419,4.3896103896103895
3991005,1,B002UJIY34,"First off I'm a huge fan of the Dog Whisperer.  I the first 3 complete seasons of the show and every book the Cesar has written.  That being said I think it a totally rip-off the way season 4 is being released.  I don't want volume one, I want the complete season.  I don't know who came up with this idea, but it's a bad one.  Get back to me when the complete season is released.",1267660800,18,380,3.9473684210526314
3991006,5,B002UJIY34,"The title from Amazon says: ""Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan: Season 4, Vol. 1""

Is this just a typo and it's actually the Entire Season 4?

The other complete seasons have 6 DVDs in them, but this one is only showing 5 DVDs.

I'm eager to purchase, but would like the entire season as a box set.

Thanks for your assistance.",1267228800,6,325,4.278688524590164
3991019,5,B002UJIY34,"Love, love, love this season of the Dog Whisperer!  All seasons actually!  But Cesar gets more polished with his message delivery with each season.  Should be required watching for anyone that ever owns a dog.",1438819200,,209,4.914285714285715
3991020,5,B002UJIY34,"As always, I learn a lot every time I watch an episode of the Dog Whisperer. Cesar Millan shows how being calm has so much to do with how our dogs will relate to us; and, being assertive, by  using the rules, boundaries, and limitations makes so much difference. We have three dogs, and if they weren't all well behaved, we'd have a madhouse! I've learned to make them behave, and they do. They all sit at the door, before they eat, and calmly, too. We make sure they go on walks; and when they do, it's on a slack leash. It makes the walk so much nicer for all of us. We love our dogs.  And, we have a lot of fun with them, too :).",1428537600,,632,3.968503937007874

3991026,5,B002UJIY34,"I will always recommend Cesar Millan for behaviour issues or just plain understanding dogs and what dogs need.  This isn't dog training, by the way and I'm not to saying he's the only one out there that can help you, just saying to take what you can with anyone who is offering and do what works for you.  He is a very valuable resource.",1389312000,,337,4.25
3991027,5,B002UJIY34,"I definitely would recommend this Season to anyone. The Dog Whisperer, definitely has a way with dogs, and understands them. I wish I did as well as he does. Anyone who wants to own a dog, or has dogs whether or not they are having trouble or not, should watch his shows to help them.

DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE!!!",1377648000,2,311,4.271186440677966
3991028,5,B002UJIY34,Always learn something new when viewing Ceasar's DVD's.  I like the way Ceasar explains why dogs do what they do.  He points out behaviors the the majority of pet owners would not notice.  Ceasar seems to improve with each season and tackles more and more unique problems.,1372032000,,272,4.74468085106383
3991029,4,B002UJIY34,"I like Cesar Millan for many reasons. I don't, however, agree with everything he teaches. This video is very informational and entertaining. The DVD was in great condition. I would recommend this! : )",1369267200,,200,4.911764705882353

3991031,5,B002UJIY34,"I love Cesar Millan. He is truely a good person with a gift from God to reach out and help people and their dogs. At the end of each program not only has he taught the ownner how to have a balanced dog, but the owner learns how to maintain balance in their life.  I highly recommend everything ""Cesar"" to anyone with dogs,  anyone considering getting a dog and anyone with a fear of dogs. Believe me, this good, wholesome educational programming for the whole family.",1358726400,,467,4.4186046511627906
3991032,4,B002UJIY34,I am a big fan of the Dog Whisperer Series and had purchased the previous 3 seasons.  I was disappointed to see that they have spit the 4th season into 2 volumes.  Seems to me the producers are taking advantage of its popularity to gouge the fans. Each season has about the same number of episodes so there is no reason to spit it into two and charge double- except greed.,1355788800,3,372,4.225352112676056

3991035,5,B002UJIY34,"A must for anyone interested in learning about how dogs behave and interact. Sensible common sense information on dogs and case reports on dogs Cesar works on.  Worth watching more than once. Look beyond the human/dog interaction and really hear what Cesar has to say about energy, calmness etc.  Great learning tool",1349395200,,316,5.0576923076923075
3991036,5,B002UJIY34,As always Cesar's videos are loaded with helpful information about training your pets. I always enjoy all of his teaching material!,1347408000,,131,5.285714285714286
3991037,5,B002UJIY34,"Cesar Milan is a true Guru, his knowledge and experience is explained in his own words and actions, there is no pretence, just good solid advice most of which, if applied with care, can be accomplished by an amateur although some techniques shouldn't be tried without advice or by a professional, this is clearly stated where it is applicable and if you don't feel confident in applying these methods, again you should call in some-one who is, but I would check first that that person is sympathetic to the `Dog Whisperer' and his methods, simply because they work and they are sustainable without unnecessary apparatus or cruelty.

Cesar Milan is not going to teach you how to train your dog to sit and stay, he is dealing with dogs that, through no fault of their own, have gone beyond everyday acceptable behaviour and turned into various sized monsters with issues and phobias. Without exception, these animals have been brought back to be useful loving pets and working dogs, and he will show you how this was achieved.

A truly miraculous transformation can be attained with kindness and hard work.
I am honestly in awe of this man and his work and the videos in these series are a real testament to his ability. I have owned and trained Rottweilers for over 40 years

Do your dog and your family a huge favor and watch all of these.  All the Dog Whisperer episodes and seasons make it very clear that you need to exercise your dog, respect it, and give it what it needs to be a stable and happy family member. If you do not meet it's needs it can develop all sorts of problems. If it has problems you can correct them by understanding your dog better via these shows and giving it what it needs to help it be the happy dog it deserves to be.
