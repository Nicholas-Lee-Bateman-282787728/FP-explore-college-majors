8159016,1,6305074313,"No one has reviewed this yet, so I'll stick my neck out.  This dull, lame take on the mad scientist theme adds nothing of value to the genre.  A brain surgeon offers a wealthy old woman a chance to relive her youth by transplanting her brain into the body of a captured young woman (Cynthia Chase, in her only movie role.  The lovely Chase and former Playmate Bekki Armstrong spend nearly the whole film unconscious and strapped on gurneys in a suburban house with a secret operating room and a basement full of cannibalistic zombies who eat the ""evidence"" (yeah, that should be OK with the zoning board).  Our bland hero (Chris Crone)enlists the help of nosy neighbor Agnes (Elmarie Wendel, in the best, but sadly short, acting job) in an attempt to rescue his girlfriend (Armstrong), his brother, and his brother's girlfriend (Chase).  Aging former ""F-Troop"" cutie Melody Patterson plays the nurse, and two other surgeons and a few thuglike assistants round out the cast. But the script, acting, FX, editing, lighting, hell even the sound, are sub-par.  The result is 96 minutes of tedium that I only sat through so I could hand out accurate advice: Do not rent, buy or even steal this movie.  You'll be sorry.",1216166400,3,1212,4.742857142857143
