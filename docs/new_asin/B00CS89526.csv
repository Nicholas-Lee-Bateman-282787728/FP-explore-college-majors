8585662,4,B00CS89526,Golf instruction that I felt made real sense and is very doable.  This is the first time I understood how to compress a golf ball.,1457308800,,130,4.2

8585664,5,B00CS89526,"Just finished the 4 dvds.  I'm very encouraged, because I struck the ball very very well a number of times during today's round. Better than I had in over two years.  I have to actually take the Clampett challenge and do the tic tac toe drill (practice) for a couple of hours, but even just watching the dvds, it has helped me a great deal.  For the past 1-1/2 years, I've been really struggling after spending $1,300 with a high tech golf instructional company that truly didn't work for me.  Clampett's instruction is unique because it focuses on impact and because it actually helps.",1454457600,,586,4.605769230769231

8585667,5,B00CS89526,"This is an excellent training system for golf: beginner, mid-handicapper or better. It's a perfect compliment to the book, which I bought first and started putting the method into practice. I'm a convert, I admit, but don't deny yourself the luxury of this great system. This really ought to be the way that golf is taught.",1386806400,10,323,4.785714285714286
