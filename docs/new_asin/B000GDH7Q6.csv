2605108,5,B000GDH7Q6,"I've been a life-long A&C fan, and I own every one of their films, not to mention their Colgate Comedy appearances. For some strange reason, I never really bothered to pick up their TV show on either VHS or DVD, thinking that it was largely a rehash of the same classic bits I'd seen again and again in their films. While my assessment is partially true I am happy to say that these shows are VERY funny and arguably better than their films because the bits come at a faster pace (no slow, intrusive musical numbers to interfere with the pace, and the 1/2 hour show length helps), the plots are simple and silly, and the supporting cast is strong and endearing (Let's give some credit to Sydney Fields, who not only wrote many of these shows but also exhibits versatility as a great comic in his own right). Yes, most of their classic bits are rehashed, but they don't feel tired, as the performances feel fresh and renewed. I'd even argue that these old routines are better performed and funnier than some of their film appearances (the Niagra Falls bit, for example, is much better here).",1166659200,7,1090,4.538071065989848
2605109,5,B000GDH7Q6,"To the most laudatory reviews here, I can only add my appreciation to Passport Video for releasing all 52 episodes of the show on two box sets.  I had been thinking about buying the earlier collection, but at what price glory?  It's true that several shows on discs one and two of Season One are flawed, but you may call Nick at Passport and he'll send you two corrected copies.  How many companies are willing to do that?  So let's be grateful rather than so negative about these collections.  I find the quality high enough for viewing without undue attention to the remastering and how about those bonus interviews and home movies?  Wow!  My 13-year-old grandson is writing a paper for his class about Abbott and Costello and he's studying Chris Costello's biography, which is essential reading for you A&C fans.  These bonus features are something Universal hasn't added to their collections and so thank you, Passport.",1165017600,4,923,4.834394904458598

2605111,5,B000GDH7Q6,THIS DVD IS GREAT. I REMEMBER THESE SHOWS LIKE I SAW THEM YESTERDAY AND NOT 50 YEARS AGO. THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURE IS PRETTY GOOD CONSIDERING THE AGE OF THE SHOWS.

2605112,5,B000GDH7Q6,"Passport Video presents ""The Abbott & Costello Show: 100th Anniversary Collection Season One"" (1952-1953) (26 episodes of 30 mins shows), --- (Dolby digitally remastered)... Abbott and Costello were an American comedy duo whose work in radio, film, and television made them one of the most popular and respected teams in comedy history --- Their ""Who's on First?"" routine, developed during their years in burlesque, is widely considered to be one of the greatest comedy sketches of all time --- The two comedians first worked together in 1935 at the Eltinge burlesque theater on 42nd Street in New York. Costello became a burlesque comic in 1928 after failing to break into films as an actor and working as a stunt double and extra --- Abbott had been in burlesque since about 1914, as a ticket seller, producer, and finally a performer --- Abbott and Costello made their partnership formal in 1936, building an act by adapting and improving numerous old burlesque sketches into their own style --- Abbott was the arch, often scheming straight man and Costello the confused, always the fall guy.

By 1951, the twosome had moved to television--first as one of the rotating hosts of The Colgate Comedy Hour (Eddie Cantor and Bob Hope were among the others) and then, the following year, in their own situation comedy --- The Abbott and Costello Show, the half-hour series was loosely adapted from their radio show, but cast the duo as unemployed citizens --- One of the show's running gags involved Abbott perpetually nagging Costello to get a job to pay their rent, while Abbott barely lifted a finger himself in that direction --- as a regular Sidney Fields as their landlord and Hillary Brooke as a friendly neighbor who sometimes got involved in the duos schemes --- while semi-regular was Joe Besser, who played Stinky, a 40-year-old sissy dressed in a Little Lord Fauntleroy suit was good for a laugh or two --- ""The Abbott and Costello Show"" ran from 1952 to 1954, but the show found a new life in syndicated rerun broadcast in the late 1960s and early-to-mid 1970s, and the episodes were probably seen by more viewers this time around than when the show was actually produced --- the recently restored short ""10,000 Kids and a Cop"" from 1948, and appears in this collection --- this is a must have for fans around the world of this classic comedy team.

This collection of the comedy duo still has the magic that we remember from those bygone years --- but as long as we have the labels and networks who play and show these wonderful films of yesteryear, they will never be forgotten --- hats off to Steve Stoliar (Producer) and Dante J.

2605113,5,B000GDH7Q6,"Do not be put off by the Passport label for this release, this is unlike all other Passport releases, it is excellent! And no logo branded on screen durning the shows.

These are the same restored quality 35mm film transfers that were on the SHANACHIE individual 4 episoded DVDs, but at a fraction of the price. Better yet, disc 5 is almost all bonus material supplied by the Costello Family.  Their involvement in this DVD release is the reason for the high quality.

I already had the older releases and almost passed this up.  But the 107 minutes of bonus material not available anywhere else was enough for me to invest the money again.  Lou's Daughters supply interviews & narration over the home movies that adds insight to the Lou Costello persona.  There is also footage of Lou & Bud promoting Lou's Boys Club.

Season one was, without question, the better season for The Abbott & Costello show.  In addition to vaudeville veteran Sid Fields, the boys are joined by lovely Hillary Brook and soon-to-be stooge Joe Besser as Stinky.  Mike the Cop also makes regular appearances to try and keep Lou in line.
Season one also features all of Bud & Lou's classic routines from their stage appearances & movies. You will see ""Who's On First"" in the ""Old Actors Home"" episode.  These routines were all used up by the time the second season went into production.

If you never bought the older release, this is a MUST BUY.  If you own the previous set, you may want to get this to learn more about the boys.

FYI, the 100th Anniversary is not for the television show, it is only 50 years old.  The 100th Anniversary is actually for Lou Costello's day of birth.",1159747200,43,1659,4.579661016949153

2605115,5,B000GDH7Q6,"What a cool collection! It's very handy being able to have all 26 episodes of the first season on five DVDs. And the quality of the shows is as good as I think I've seen. The stuff in the special bonus features is really great. I think clips from some of the home movies were in that Jerry Seinfeld TV special awhile ago, but it's great to see them uncut. I didn't realize people made home movies with sound and in color back in the 40s (long before the camcorder was even on the drawing board). The interviews with Costello's daughters are interesting (where are Abbott's relatives???). And I'd never heard of that short film from 1948 before. That was interesting too. If you're into Abbott and Costello and vintage comedy, this is pretty worthwhile.",1157414400,,752,4.5777777777777775

2605129,5,B000GDH7Q6,"For all you fans of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello who were disappointed in the defective discs of their franchise movie collections made a few years back, here is the real answer to Abbott and Costello DVDs.  The makers of these discs took their time and energy to make them with impeccable quality, great sound, amusing classic episodes, and Lou's two surviving children, Paddy and Chris, in extra footage pay sentimental tribute to their father and their ""Uncle Bud.""  Their classic routines in the TV show are basically the same from the movies, where in one episode, for instance, has Lou calling a phone operator trying to collect a grand prize, and the operator scoffs at him, telling him ""The line is busy.""  That routine can be found in the movie ""Who Done It.""  And of course, there will never, ever an Abbott and Costello collection complete without the immortal ""Who's on First?,"" their national anthem.

  Hopefully in the future, the makers of this 100th Anniversary Collection Season will take time and energy to make their movies the same way so fans won't feel like their missing anything on the movies.  It was such a shame that the makers of the Franchise Collection did a haphazard job with too many skips and glitches.  Not here in this special anniverary, commemorating Lou's 100th birthday and making him Paterson, New Jersey's favorite son.  Watch this collection as well as the second set, and you will never be disappointed.  For relaxing times, when you can't find anything good on TV and you need a episode to wind down and laugh before bedtime, watch anything from both sets of this special DVD collection.",1200614400,4,1632,4.813620071684587
2605130,5,B000GDH7Q6,"All my Dad wanted for Christmas was a dvd with their ""rent skit"". This dvd has all the classics. He has watched it over and over.",1200355200,,129,4.0
2605131,5,B000GDH7Q6,"Over the years, we've seen these First Season shows mixed together with the lesser Second Season shows and it seemed that those tired, plot-driven episodes were not elevated by their predecessors but did serve the purpose of showing fans and historians what could be done when the stars have a say in the creative process. Those earlier, loose-jointed but free-wheeling and funny (oftentimes, hilarious) used updated vaudeville material and an excellent troupe of veterans. Everything fell into place. Most of the time, it made no sense. In one episode, Hillary Brooke is Lou'\s girlfriend. In another, she's Stinky's (Joe Besser's) Mother. Abnbott may have a mustache in one scene and not the next. The ad-libs were flying (and had 15 years of honing behind them).
Lou appears to have ""bounced back"" from a devastating personal loss and Bud was never better.
And that's what is here: that great first season, when acting, writing, directing, and editing worked together, and the Team led the charge.
A fascinating feature for the deep fan is an interview with Lou's daughters and home movies, most of which has Lou as Producer and Narrator. More often than not, he's  actually out-of-character, and at one point he drops his voice when the subject of drunkenness comes up and it has relevance in his Professional life. Yes, it's been written that his partner had a problem, probably stemming from an Epileptic condition, which, in 1950, was said to be misunderstood, especially by those afflicted, who resorted to ""self-medication"". Anyway, his voice resonates with weary disappointment, almost total resignation.
The European Vacation narrative runs very long and is not a strong selling-point for the casual fan, in this Reviwer's opinion.
Might have been interesting to use less vacation clips and include some interviews/comments from the Abbott family.
THe historian might enjoy taking note of some material also associated with The Three Stooges (particularly evident in the episode ""Television""); and some looking forward to the ""Seinfeld"" series.",1200268800,3,2055,5.265243902439025
