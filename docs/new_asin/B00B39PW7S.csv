8562082,5,B00B39PW7S,"Patrick Smith did an awesome job explaining the fundamentals of heeling. The most important part of the DVD to me was the mental game. How he broke it down, how he learned that year from the NFR. I could on but I would recommend it for a great use of reference on the heeling side or as a roper in general.",1502668800,,306,4.032786885245901

8562089,5,B00B39PW7S,"I'll bet I've got 75+ roping videos. About 30 years worth of learning to rope better, one steer at a time. From Walts video in 1980 on ""sticks and flys"" to Driven in 2013. I love the fact that these great teachers are willing to share what they know with the rest of us.
This video is awesome. Some of the best filming ever is demonstated in Driven.
I'm a #8 heeler and I have watched hours and hours of video to help sharpen my technique. My 2 all-time favorites are The Journey and Driven. Both are cheap at twice the price.",1361836800,3,526,4.166666666666667
