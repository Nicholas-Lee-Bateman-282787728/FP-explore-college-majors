3911462,5,B002DKGWV6,"This a good starter collection for those interested in Zombies. What collection would be complete without the original Night of the Living Dead. My favorite is White Zombie starring Bela Lugosi. White Zombie was one of Bela's greatest movies, Bela also did some directing on this film. The interesting part of this set is it has both the modern conception of flesh eating zombies as in Night of the Living Dead and the classic style of voodoo zombies as seen in White Zombie. Zombie Classics is a good overview of the zombie phenomenon.",1355270400,2,536,4.774193548387097
3911463,4,B002DKGWV6,My sister loves zombies and horror comedies. This was perfect for her. It has everything you would want. From the horrible special effects to the cheesy scenes its so wonderful. Definitely something to add to your cheesy horror collection.,1327881600,,239,5.153846153846154
3911464,5,B002DKGWV6,"Got the box set and it was in perfect condition. Watched Oasis of the Living Dead that night. Considering the quality of the original work and what technology it used, this is a fair copy. A great addition to any collection for any Zombie Apocalypse Defense Specialist such as myself. The tin is awesome. This was exactly what it represented itself to be and I'm very pleased with it overall.",1311552000,7,392,4.614285714285714
3911465,4,B002DKGWV6,wonderful box and the movies are great! If I remember correctly an excellent copy of White Zombie. Heck that is old like me. Enjoy this all you Zombie lovers and Lock Your doors. Remember you must shoot them in the head....,1301443200,7,223,4.463414634146342
3911466,1,B002DKGWV6,"The tin is great! The quality of the transfers isn't. The gain on WHITE ZOMBIE was boosted so much the picture washes out in light areas and there is no black to be found. Just gray.
The OASIS OF THE ZOMBIES just might be one of the very worst movies ever filmed. Production values, script (if there was one), acting, photography, EVERYTHING is so bad it was a real effort to watch the film to its end. And the ending sucked too. The only redeeming moments were quick glipses of a couple of the actresses bare breasts. But the women weren't very good lookers. Probably cast from a topless bar somewhere.
All in all, you can get these films in most of the big 50 or 100 movie box sets for about 50 cents each. Unless you just nood a cool tin to store your stash, save your money.",1295395200,4,778,4.228187919463087
3911467,5,B002DKGWV6,"Zombie Classics comes in a cool collectors metal tin, that holds two regular sized dvd cases inside. Th tin itself is very well done with ""3d"" writing and pictures, meaning they are raised metal. It says zombie classics on both sides,the top and bottom, as well as the front and back so you can put it on any dvd shelf and see what it is. The back has a full description of all the movies. 4 Movies Included:

Dvd 1:

Movie 1. -George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead - the 1968 classic in B/W no description necessary! Rating : 10/10

8365344,3,B002DKGWV6,"There are two classic movies in this collection -- White Zombie and Night of the Living Dead -- and two that I hadn't seen, which is why I picked up the set.  I figured since the description described it as a joint release with Shout Factory, the quality would be very good.

Sad to say, the quality of the prints is not so great.  They look like transfers off of VHS tape.  Nor do any of them have chapter breaks.  That's right, each film is one long chapter.  There are no extras.  (And there is no indication Shout Factory actually worked on this box.  Oops, Amazon!)  Here's a breakdown:

NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD -- Print looks very washed out, and I have better copies, so I didn't watch it and don't know if it's complete or not.
WHITE ZOMBIE -- Again, print is very faded.  Audio may have been marginally better than the usual public domain copies, but there were at least 2 breaks (not in the usual copies) with a few seconds missing.  Can't recommend this print for collectors.
OASIS OF THE ZOMBIES -- Print looks okay, but it's letterboxed within a 4/3 frame (not anamorphic) -- which adds to my perception that these are merely tape transfers.  I'm watching it now, and if it's good, I may have to seek another source with a better print.  It did seem to skip a bit during the nudity/gore scenes.  Not sure how much may be missing.
REVENGE OF THE ZOMBIES -- Probably the best print of the bunch, and it seemed complete.  Since this doesn't seem widely available, I guess it was worth picking up the set to have it, but only because I'm a Monster Kid and B-Movie nut, and it has John Carradine and Mantan Moreland.

The tin is a very nice thing, and the movies themselves are good.  Too bad the quality of the transfers is not better.  Might be a nice ""starter kit"" for these films, if you can find a cheap copy (or if you really need to have Revenge of the Zombies).",1380067200,4,1878,4.329512893982808
