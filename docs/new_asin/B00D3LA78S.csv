The beginning starts like a DVD I burned myself with a date and time recorded mode. I've seen pirate films made better. The ""film"" is narrated by a drone named Travis who has a hard time with the lines he wrote for himself. He tells us films have a lot of sex and violence a few times during the feature, but other than that, there was really no discussion about it.

The film shows some topless screen tests and the filming of a low budget slasher (?) film, The claim was made they couldn't get the actresses they needed to get naked so they hired local strippers. The women in the film were on the full figured/ chunky side. Unless you can't get enough BBW into your life this is something you can pass on.",1422576000,,726,4.253623188405797
8589075,1,B00D3LA78S,"I have commented before about this film to no avail. It is absolutely incompetent trash. I have suggested that amazon stop selling it, but evidently my solicited comments (""review"") have been ignored.",1382659200,,200,5.28125
8589076,1,B00D3LA78S,I really don't see any entertainment value in any part of this.  I should not be for sale on your site.,1381881600,,103,3.9047619047619047
8589077,1,B00D3LA78S,"This ""movie"" has the production values of eight-year olds playing with a camcorder. it's narration, when it can be heard, is moronic, and It's pretence to be a film documentary is laughable. STOP SELLING IT!",1381104000,,207,4.942857142857143
8589078,1,B00D3LA78S,"Worse piece of junk I have ever watched. It went straight to the garbage can. Boring, cheap quality and just plain trash.",1377993600,,121,4.545454545454546
