Eddie is a monkey, the adventurous one of the group. Trevor is a parrot capable of mimicking peoples voices, but he also can read and speak to them. Sasha the Cheetah is the action member of the team. They travel by rail, plane, hot air balloon, you name it. Their destinations include the cold of Siberia to the streets of Paris to the shores of mysterious Easter Island. They are searching for an animal utopia,and run into many interesting animals along the way. Great for kids age 3 to pre-teen, good moral lessons about friendship, trust and loyalty. Even though there is a hunter, I did not find anything violent is the story. Great for any kids that like animal stories. It was released in 2002 and runs 73 minutes long. The same company, ""DIC"", has released other titles to video and TV, such as a version of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Treasure Island, Zorro, and Dinosaur Island. The last 2 titles are really good. They also have the Archie's movies and animated Inspector Gadget.",1262649600,,1400,4.695121951219512
