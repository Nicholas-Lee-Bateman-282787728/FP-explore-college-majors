2554868,1,B000F8O454,This movie and it's actors were so laughably bad that I had to watch the whole thing!  It was unbelievable.,1184630400,,107,4.35
2554869,1,B000F8O454,"Oh my God!  Now, I'm a major horror buff and I appreciate cheesy B films, even C films!  But this one, like someone else said, was just plain awful.  The actors were no good, you can tell that it was really low budget 'cause you can hear the echo when they spoke (think porn movies).  I gave it 1 star because I had no choice.

Too put it in short, I would suggest NOT buying any Maverick films, Creepyflix films, and some (NOT ALL) Anchorbay and Lionsgate films.  Oy!",1165449600,5,468,4.202247191011236
2554870,1,B000F8O454,"This movie is flat-out horrifying.  No, it's not the ghosts that make it so scary, it's the acting.  This has to be one of the worst acted and mind numbingly boring movies to have ever entered into my home.  The makers of this film should issue an apology to everyone who has ever actually sat down and watched this waste of time.  Avoid it at all costs, even if it means gouging out your eyes and sticking a screwdriver in your ears.",1164758400,9,434,4.2560975609756095
2554871,1,B000F8O454,"I got this movie for my son because it was PG, but when we popped it in the player, the first trailer had VERY R rated NUDITY and the second trailer had VERY R rated language!

The movie itself was awful in terms of acting, style and story, but it did not have any offensive content.  DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR KIDS!",1154822400,2,315,3.984126984126984
2554872,1,B000F8O454,"Do you remember in school when you were asked to write out a skit about a lesson, or perhaps make a movie? The students were terrible actors, either over doing or under doing everything they said or did...the dialogue was unbelievable pathetic, and the camera work (if there was any) was shaky and hard to watch. This movie shows like a bad high school attempt at movie making. The movie begins with a long dialogue about women who allow their husbands to take care of them. (Housewives are apparently an evil thing to this director.) After nearly fifteen minutes of simply staring up at a married couple from the floor of their car, we begin to enter into the meat of the movie...not that there is any. The only scary thing about this motion picture is its complete lack of imagination, its terrifyingly bad actors, and the camera work that is so shoddy...it had to be filmed using an old VHS tape JVC camcorder. Spare yourself this nightmare. I doubt the CIA would even use this movie to torture terrorists into admitting their darkest secrets...it would just be too cruel.",1153612800,3,1075,4.663157894736842
2554873,1,B000F8O454,"Pick any house on any street.

Pick any random two people(Man and Woman), give them a script and let them go wild.

I promise you could make this movie work better than the producers.

Nothing in this movie stood out and everything about it was boring.

The acting and settings in this movie are just horrible. By the end you WANT everyone to die just to become interested.

Now, I don't usually give bad ratings and I really like ""B"" horror films, but the lack of effort here is unbelievable.

Just nothing to interest me.",1153094400,11,523,4.4526315789473685
2554874,1,B000F8O454,"I wish there was a way to give this a rating below one star, because this movie certainly doesn't deserve any. I'm a sixteen-year-old highschool junior and i know for a fact that I could write a better script than this. PLEASE don't waste your money. As the person who reveiwed this before me said, watch this only to make fun of the bad acting.

Oh, and for the record, you can actually hear the director yelling ""Cut!"" at the end of one of the scenes.",1151884800,5,453,4.267441860465116
2554875,1,B000F8O454,"What the heck WAS that? I just watched this and . . . what the heck WAS that?! The cover looked good, but I think they spent 90% of their budget on the cover and didn't have anything left to actually shoot the film.

This looked like a junior high school production shot at a sleepover! By the way, there is no house like the one on the cover, there is no little boy on a tricycle . . . there is no reason to watch this.

Unless you just want to laugh at the corny lines and bad acting :)",1149552000,7,488,3.8217821782178216
2554876,5,B000F8O454,"Ignore the five stars.  For some reason they won't go away when I edit this review.  This movie looks interesting from the cover but who can buy a movie based on the cover alone? Since there is no movie summary listed here, I searched the net and was able to find this:  When the Cromiers, a young married couple, move into their gorgeous new home in rural Lousiana, they feel like they've died and gone to heaven.  Unfortunately, the ghosts that haunt the house threaten to make t his a reality and as the number of inexplicable incidents rise, the family realizes they'll be lucky to get out alive. Horror. Not Rated. 85 minutes long.",1147219200,11,636,4.504347826086956

8118989,4,B000F8O454,"I find this movie to be okay.  It's definitely an independent film!  I don't think previous reviewers were considering that fact when they wrote their reviews. I think the story line is wonderful. Yes, the acting is not that great and yes, they could have edited it a little more.  For this reason, I have given four stars instead of five.  If this was a high school project or something, I could see the student(s) getting an A on this.  If you haven't seen this yet, I recommend renting it before you buy so you can determine what a good price is for you on the DVD if you decide to own it after watching.  Have fun!",1428710400,,618,4.239316239316239
8118990,1,B000F8O454,"OMG this has got to be the worst movie EVER MADE. Why anyone would have taken the time to record this on film is a mystery in its self. I could get a better performance out of a class full of kindergardners. This thing will STINK up your house. DO NOT waste your time and money getting anywhere near this stink bomb. What a joke. I am not sure why it was made. The story line, if you can call it that was even less than weak, dialogue was hysterical, acting if you can call it that.. well a dog licking its butt would have been more entertaining. I am still in shock after watching this disaster!! Don't, I repeat, Don't go anywhere this thing.",1331769600,,644,4.16
8118991,1,B000F8O454,"I bought this movie thinking it would be good, but it drags, and didn't appeal to a really good horror movie.  It was played up t be scary but didn't follow through.",1301356800,,165,4.15625
8118992,1,B000F8O454,"This movie is so bad that I couldn't even watch the whole thing and as soon as it was over I felt the urge to write this review so that other are not fooled to watch it as well. The front cover looks amazing, and I was expecting something similar to it or that it had some resemblance to it... But I was dissapointed. This movie actually deserves a 5 NEGATIVE stars if that was possible. It is a SHAME for Amazon.com to sell this kind of crap, I bet my dog makes a more interesting movie.
 Everything is terrible, including acting, landscape, the house and even the cat!! The director should be ashamed of participating in this garbage. PLEASE, DON'T WATCH OR BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!! IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH 5 CENTS!! BEWARE... AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS!! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO FOR A WALK INSTEAD!!!",1289952000,,797,4.3133333333333335
8118993,1,B000F8O454,"The plot was good, but the people couldn't act at all. The ending was stupid and actually an anti-climax. Do not buy or rent this movie!",1285977600,,136,4.269230769230769
8118994,3,B000F8O454,"I am not a big fan of horror movies, and this one I would say is ok. I had the chance to see it, and I think that it could have been done better. The drama is good overall in my opinion.

8118995,1,B000F8O454,This by far is the worst film in the history of cinema. Run away as fast as you can when you see this movie. It is a shame to label it a horror film. It is a shame to label it movie period. I actually heard the director say cut after one of the scenes.,1238371200,,252,3.6
8118996,1,B000F8O454,"This was not the movie I thought it was.  It was some half wit production where the editor couldn't even edit out the ""cut"" at the end of one scene.  I think this movie was presented as though it was the 1970s original movie which was good.  Isn't there some law against using the same name in 2 movies or books?  Please subtract the 1 star I had to give this POS in order to post this comment.",1237075200,,394,4.012820512820513
8118997,1,B000F8O454,"I wish I could rate this movie 0 stars.  Or better yet, a negative star rating.  I couldn't even watch the whole thing because it was so terribly put together.  About 45 minutes into the film I found my self looking for a pencil so I could shove it in my ear!  Why?  Because if I'm going to be in such pain, I might as well inflict it on myself.  The acting is terrible, the cinematography is just as bad and because of the lack of extras, you get the idea that the only people that exist in the entire world are the main characters.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go dig graphite out of my ears.",1200441600,2,601,3.9583333333333335
