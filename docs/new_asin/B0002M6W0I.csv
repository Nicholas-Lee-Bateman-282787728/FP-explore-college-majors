8451779,5,B0002M6W0I,"I whole heartedly recommend this DVD for all pregnant women and new breastfeeding mothers to watch.  ""Breastfeeding: The Real Deal"" is by far the best breastfeeding teaching DVD I have ever seen in the last 30 years of practice as a RN, Lamaze instructor and Certified Lactation Consultant.  The DVD is hip, fast-paced and extremely factual.",1246320000,,341,5.071428571428571
8451780,5,B0002M6W0I,"This is  an excellent educational material for new moms that plan to breastfeed.  When I gave birth to my first daughter, I did not know how to breastfeed at all.  At the begining, this was a painful experience until I saw this DVD and I started breastfeeding the correct way.  Breastfeeding became the most exciting and lovely experience of my life. I recommend this DVD to new mothers and to experienced mothers who would like to learn new techniques.

Thanks to the producers of ""The Real Deal On Breastfeeding"" for helping me learn how to breastfeed.",1158192000,,554,4.729166666666667
8451781,5,B0002M6W0I,"As an expectant -- and anxious about nursing -- mom, I recently watched this video with my sister (a mother of one).  We both thought it was very well done and helpful.  The video is short and intelligent - giving the quick primer you need to feel comfortable with the basics of nursing.  (Its also a lot less expensive than the other videos on the market.) Overall, it was entertaining, engaging, and very easy to watch. I feel so much more prepared for what's to come.",1154908800,,470,4.441860465116279
8451782,1,B0002M6W0I,"I bought this DVD midway through my pregnancy in order to prepare for breadstfeeding in any way I could. I was incredibly disappointed though. While the video did have clips of women having discussions on breastfeeding topics, they were not very indepth. Also, there was very little actual video of mothers breastfeeding and illustrating actual techniques, a huge upset to me as this was my main reason for buying a DVD. I wanted to see( and not just READ from books)exactly the kinds of things I would need to know.",1149379200,7,516,4.7444444444444445
8451783,5,B0002M6W0I,"The DVD has high marks from my wife.  The instructional DVD is very informational and comprehensive.  The show has real mothers and experts discussing the topic. (...)  Guys don't have to watch the video, but you'll help your wife feed your baby.

8451784,5,B0002M6W0I,"I found this video to be both instructional and inspirational and a true cause for optimism.  The ""everyday"" moms featured on the video offered realistic concerns and solutions to many of the common breastfeeding myths and challenges.  For a user-friendly and comforting look at how to breastfeed your baby, watch this video!",1100649600,2,325,5.230769230769231
8451785,5,B0002M6W0I,"I have already breastfed two children, but not without problems.  I was happy to view this dvd and pick up some pointers to make the third time easier.  I was particularly impressed with the demonstration of latching on and the explanation for why the various holds are so important for proper latching on.  It is difficult to really appreciate these techniques from books and even with assistance from a lactation specialist the view is rather awkward looking down at yourself.  There really is no substitute for seeing another woman correctly hold and position a newborn for nursing.  Due to my schedule and obligations I was never able to attend a support group and I don't anticipate being able to this time around.  Therefore, the Real Deal has been exactly what I need to prepare and to feel like I have a readily available resource for those 2am feedings when things don't seem to be going exactly right.  I have suggested the Real Deal to my sister-in- law and plan to tell my pediatrician about it -- I am too reluctant to give up my copy until feeding is well established!",1100476800,5,1082,4.663157894736842
8451786,5,B0002M6W0I,"In 25 minutes this video takes you through the how-tos of breast feeding. It was clearer, cheaper and faster than the 2 hour class I took because it actually demonstrates up-close how to effectively breast feed, something you can't really get from diagrams and descriptions in classes or books. The question & answer section asks & answers everything you want to know but wouldn't have time (or would be too embarrassed) to ask in a class. Most importantly, if I forget something I can replay the video and remind myself. Great shower gift!",1100476800,2,540,4.817204301075269
8451787,5,B0002M6W0I,"Since experts agree that there is no better gift to give your baby than breast milk, there is really no better present to give your expecting friend than The REAL DEAL on Breastfeeding.  As a mother of two, who had her share of ups and downs with the breastfeeding process, I found this video to be an extremely informative and thoughtfully presented introduction to the miracle of breastfeeding.  It discusses not only the range of emotions tied to breastfeeding, but very practically demonstrates the physical 'how-to's' of the process. I found the frames of a woman actually putting her child to her breast with the guidance of a mid-wife particularly powerful and instructive.  I know breastfeeding is supposed to be a 'natural' process, but as I and so many moms will attest, in the beginning it does not always feel so easy or natural. It's reassuring to listen to the experiences of other moms, not to mention the advice of experts that this video provides.  A new mom with whom I recently shared The REAL DEAL, said it answered so many of her questions about breastfeeding and the physical demonstrations helped to speed and ease the process of feeding her son.  It's really a must for all expectant mothers who plan to breastfeed!",1096848000,3,1239,4.7981220657277
8451788,5,B0002M6W0I,"This DVD is great!  Before my son was born I read numerous books and articles on breastfeeding, but it was the Real Deal on Breastfeeding video that brought it all together.  I strongly urge purchasing the video for anyone who is a first time breastfeeder or for anyone who had a tough time and gave up sooner than planned in the past.

I received the Real Deal on Breastfeeding DVD about a week before I gave birth.  As mentioned above, although I read a lot on breastfeeding this DVD really pulled it together for me. The zoomed in demonstrations truly helped me to understand what the books and articles were describing. When I watched the video I literally said,",1095379200,3,666,4.571428571428571
