8522444,1,B007WB5CT4,"Would have to agree with another reviewer who indicated this DVD isn't worth viewing or listening to it. Some of the costumes are nice, but pink capes are quite awful. Soundtrack, the reason most people probably listen to operettas, is abominable. Strident, tiny sounds. Voices might be good or adequate but this is not evident. Unfortunately this appears the only DVD available for this work. I'd have loved to have seen the entire work done with Ingeborg Hallstein and Peter Andrews that is briefly shown on YouTube.",1502841600,,518,4.9655172413793105
8522445,4,B007WB5CT4,"Pretty much the sole survivor of Heuberger's small operetta output, ""Opernball"" may not boast one of the great theatre scores, but it's certainly pleasant enough, and it does have the famous waltz ""Im Chambre spare"". The plot is like ""Die Fledermaus,"" only more so: here three women run about in disguise to befuddle their menfolk at the Paris ball of the title. (You probably won't need to be told that all ends well.) For reasons best known to the director--perhaps to justify the cheap-looking sets--framing scenes have been added, in which the painter Toulouse-Lautrec and a model discuss the events of the story. (There are also some anachronistic gags in the dialogue, typical with these 1970s tv productions.) As usual, the singing has been pre-recorded--which would be less noticeable if the acoustic were not so different during the spoken passages. However, the performers are all good, especially Uwe Friedrichsen and Christiane Schroeder as the juvenile couple, and there doesn't seem to be another complete version of this piece in any format. Clear subtitles, stereo sound, nice booklet.",1367884800,4,1101,5.2259887005649714
