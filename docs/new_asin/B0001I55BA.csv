8012930,3,B0001I55BA,"Started as interesting story of UFO, movies collapsed into something spiritual (scientological?) of aliens telling stuff from a screen like in kid fairtales.

The first part is the most OK.",1253145600,2,189,5.3
8012931,5,B0001I55BA,Unlike much that is written or displayed about UFO's this movie explores the spiritual dimensions without which UFO phenomena are just disconnected events. While the explanations may not be right they are both plausible and quite inspirational. Well worth serious consideration.,1211155200,2,278,5.804878048780488
