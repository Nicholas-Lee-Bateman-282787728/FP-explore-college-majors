8264350,1,B0017093QO,It's supposed to be IC safe but I hurt my bladder doing it without the first 7 minutes. I sent it back,1456012800,,102,3.6818181818181817
8264351,5,B0017093QO,"I have IC & have had horrible issues with finding the right exercise routine for myself.  my bladder & pelvic area is in constant pain & tenseness.  this dvd truly caters to people who deal with these issues.  so happy to have found it.  very well put together, with good exercises.  only complaint...wish it was a bit less expensive, kind of pricey for a dvd.",1401148800,,360,4.476923076923077
8264352,4,B0017093QO,"I have pelvis pain so this cd is great.  I do find Jennifer's voice hard to listen too, cuz it is monotone! but i suppose she wants to be soothing!",1361145600,,147,3.9
8264353,4,B0017093QO,"I have chronic pelvic pain and have been warned off Pilates and vigorous forms of yoga, so I bought this DVD with a bit of skepticism as to wether I could do the exercises. The first time I did the video I could do 90% of them without pain. It's great to have a workout that is safe and challenging - often traditional workouts like running or weights can aggravate and worsen pelvic pain. I worked up a sweat with this video but I felt pain relief rather than increase post workout.

My only complaint is the video quality - not that great. Video is a bit blurry and shaky. Would be great to have a digital download on iTunes or amazon.

Highly recommended for those of us with chronic pelvic pain.",1329609600,2,699,4.287878787878788
8264354,2,B0017093QO,I know this is supposed to be for people with pelvic pain (which I have) but it was a little too simple for me. I had high hopes but maybe I will like it more if I get worse. Let's hope that never happens.,1313452800,,205,3.6818181818181817
8264355,3,B0017093QO,"I don't have IC too bad, but I just survived my first flare up about 8 months ago & finally felt capable of exercising, so I got this dvd hoping it would ease me back into things. The work outs probably won't send the average person into a sweat but because Im so weak at this point it was a nice warm up for me. However, sadly, about a half hour after I stopped the work out, my bladder was pissed for a few days....I guess I'll just stick to the tredmill & recumbent bike. Seems to work best for me...But I seemed doomed to have a flabby tummy since I cant work it out...",1312934400,,573,3.991304347826087
8264356,4,B0017093QO,"It is nice to see a video available for those with interstitial cystitis.  The stretching makes you feel great.  I also like how you can select what area of your body you want to work on.  If you are looking for an intense workout, this is not the DVD to get. I would like to see the price a little cheaper.",1294617600,2,307,4.0
8264357,5,B0017093QO,The New Dawn Pilates is a ground breaking DVD for patients suffering with painful bladder syndrome and chronic pelvic pain. I have been working out to the New Dawn Pilates video for the last several months and it works. The New Dawns Pilates is  originate and a sate of the art video that has several different exercise programs which are perfectly tailor to meet my individuals needs. This DVD is yet another tool that I use to help maintain my chronic pelvic pain.,1281484800,,466,4.614457831325301
8264358,5,B0017093QO,"I am an IC sufferer and after performing this workout, my breathing feels so strong and my body renewed. I only wish more pilates or yoga workouts were available in the same series for IC/pelvic pain patients!",1259712000,7,209,4.675675675675675
8264359,5,B0017093QO,"As slow and easy as this DVD seems, it is what is really needed for pelvic pain sufferers. It's been hard to accept the fact that I can't work out like I used to, but this DVD will get me headed back in the right direction without causing any flares or discomfort. And it's always better knowing your work out routine is coming from someone who actually experiences pelvic pain and knows what is needed.",1231200000,5,403,4.386666666666667
