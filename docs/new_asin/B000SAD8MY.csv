8204894,4,B000SAD8MY,Nice transfer including some good extras with Paul Naschy introducing the film and discussing his career. Too bad it's only the fullscreen version. I would definitely get this in a widescreen release as well.,1361577600,,208,5.147058823529412
8204895,4,B000SAD8MY,"Paul Naschy is a kindly, wise priest in this psycho-demonic thriller. Plenty of nods to THE EXORCIST without being a complete rip-off thereof. The girl is possessed by her eeevil, dead father, rather than the typical hell-dweller. I actually like EXORCISM, and would place it up there w/ other european possession movies of the same era. The final is decent, though far too short! The girl's hideously transformed eyes are well done. I also enjoyed the devil dog attack! Oh yeah, and since it's a Naschy film, we get loads of wonderfully naked devil-gals running around in a satanic ritual scene! It must be the camera angles or superior lighting style that makes me watch this particular sequence over and over. See if you don't agree...",1250208000,4,738,4.865079365079365
8204896,4,B000SAD8MY,"Exorcism is actually not bad for being a low budget movie with sub-standard special effects. The actors are good. This is the type of movie that is worth seeing. While it is not as good as the original Exorcist, this is entertaining. While it is not at all scarry, it is unique.
I give this movie a four star rating-",1217462400,4,316,4.283333333333333
8204897,2,B000SAD8MY,"Well this film certainly rates a mixed bag. On the plus side BCI did an outstanding job with the transfer the picture quality is A+.And given that you'd expect that this film was going to be a total Exorcist rip-off and it's not that's good too. Now for the bad news Exorcism is quite dull and is more of a dysfunctional family drama than a horror film. Yes there are horror elements but at it's core the film examines the fallacy of the ""perfect family"" .You know the sitcom ones like on 8 is Enough or The Cosby Show. The effects are VERY low budget but it's kinda neat seeing stop motion photography like they used in the 70's unlike todays endless CGI effects. There are a few neat surprises and Paul Naschy is fine as he usually is as the priest. The actress who plays the bratty girl that get's possessed was good too. If you like euro horror and 70's cinema in general you might enjoy this film. It certainly is tons better than The Antichrist which was utter fecal material.",1202428800,6,982,4.371584699453552
