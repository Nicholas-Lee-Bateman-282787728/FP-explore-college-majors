7941548,5,B00005JOY1,"How much would it take to convince the company to release this on DVD?  If humour is good medicine, then imagine how many sick people would be cured once they got this on DVD!!",1191196800,35,176,4.176470588235294

Greg and kim too) but its beer chugglin, pick up drivin, lawn mower racin, ""Jimmy"" and his high school sweet heart ""Cristine"" who make the show funny, but of course WIMPY Greg and his funny ways make the show great too! But this is NOT that show,this is a movie called ""yes dear"", with Nataly Hartman. I just saw her picture, there WAS NO Nataly Hartman in the ""yes dear"" I know.  BE CARFULL!! 300 BUCKS!!!!

7941550,5,B00005JOY1,"I am so happy that this show is coming out on dvd.  I just started watching it not too long ago and they never show it in order, so there are many things i have missed. Now i can see it all.  Thanks",1164499200,6,198,3.5813953488372094
7941551,5,B00005JOY1,WHEN WHEN WHEN are they ever going to release this DVD??  There are tv's shows that recently started that are already on DVD and they suck!! Why won't they release one of the funniest shows on tv?  All 4 of these main characters are great and the show wouldn't be the same without them.  Greg is my favorite.  He's so funny with his sarcasim. So get busy putting this on DVD people!!!,1163116800,50,384,4.291666666666667
7941552,5,B00005JOY1,"it is a cute show to just have on in the background....

anyway I was watching it and Jimmy pitches a movie about a futuristic

world where clones are made and matured so they can donate body parts

to their real counterparts- well one escapes and a true love story

ensues---> okay so I think that the people who the movie The Island a

year ago must have been watching- wow!

but it is a super cute show and has a lot of heat- pretty good family

values and has sweet plots... i like it- i admit it!  I did not really watch it when it was on originally but i like it now- it is pretty rare to fnd family comedy that actually involves kids instead of using them as props!",1157760000,5,672,4.037878787878788
