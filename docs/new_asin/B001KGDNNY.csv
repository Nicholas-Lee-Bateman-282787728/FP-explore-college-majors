8314985,3,B001KGDNNY,"An entertaining watch, but at the end of the day try to borrow this if you can. Production quality is low, a lot of material is repeated throughout the video, and the people protrayed seem fake or unrealistic. One guy looks like a straight up crackhead.",1353456000,,253,4.521739130434782
8314986,1,B001KGDNNY,"i watched this video one time, and i'm pretty sure that i'll never watch it again. it wasn't effectively directed at all. it's almost as if they asked everyone to just say whatever comes to mind, and then recorded their responses in one take. it's painfully amateurish.

also, the sound quality is uneven. sometimes you can hardly understand what some of the people are saying.

i know who T. Rogers & Jiwe are, but i don't know the rest of these dudes, and the video doesn't offer any info on who they are or why they are relevant.

this isn't really a documentary. i can find better clarity on these issues on youtube. in fact, that's what this dvd feels like: something that should have been published on youtube. no real introduction, no real framing of the issues, and no real structure in general. it's just a difficult video to watch. so far this is the worst gang video that i have seen.",1263945600,3,895,4.478527607361963
