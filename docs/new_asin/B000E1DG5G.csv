8103827,3,B000E1DG5G,"This video would be a great keepsake for someone who works for the Cable Car division, but it's just not very interesting to the average person.  I gave my copy to the local library.

It was fun, when we went to San Francisco, to see some of the guys in the movie working the cable cars.  Not enough fun to justify the cost of the video, but fun, none the less.",1217635200,,361,4.056338028169014
8103828,5,B000E1DG5G,"The Feel of the Rope weaves a portrait of workers and technology. The technology is that of San Francisco's famous cable cars. The workers are those of the San Francisco's Municipal Railway's Washington-Mason Cable Car Division. The setting is contemporary.

The Feel of the Rope skillfully blends the anecdotes from the interviewees with each other, combines them with the outdoor cable car operational scenes which are coupled with musical scores that result in an engrossing presentation both for the cable car buff and the non cable car buff.  The subject matter is treated with a high degree of sensitivity and competence. Uniquely, in this age which is too often characterized by indifference and cynicism, the workers, who are from a variety of backgrounds, present a portrait community, family and pride.

Yes, cable car operational technology is treated.  But, the prime strength of The Feel of the Rope is the special feeling that one comes away with from the personal gratification the workers have from their jobs, as being San Francisco ""ambassadors"" on this world famous icon.  Production standards are highly professional. Anyone interested in cable cars, even marginally, and employee attitudes and interaction will find The Feel of the Rope a highly worthwhile experience.
