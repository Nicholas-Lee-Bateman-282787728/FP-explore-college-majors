2790928,5,B000O5B4EM,"This is VCIs third My Little Margie release.  The show features Gale Storm and Charles Farrell. As some one mentioned , these are 10 well chosen funny episodes in good quality. We now have 34 of 126 episodes released on DVD. Let's hope VCI will continue to release further volumes of this show until every episode is released .Same goes for VCIs I Married Joan Series. Maybe in the future VCI can look into other  1950s and 1960s shows like Oh Sussanna ,  Topper, December Bride,  and the People's Choice.",1408060800,7,505,4.5777777777777775

2790931,5,B000O5B4EM,"Kudos to VCI for bringing out a third collection of this classic, early-'50s sitcom for which audiences remember Gale Storm so fondly. There are 10 episodes on this disc, and they are all in excellent quality--visually and audio-wise. They are from 1953, 1954, and 1955. They are some of the best I've seen. Highlights for me include ""The Big Telecast,"" in which Margie and her dad ('Vern') get their wires crossed with different business deals that end up in a hilarious sort of ""reality TV"" segment to be filmed at their home with screwball antics involving a bearded circus lady and two seals; ""Margie's New Boyfriend,"" in which she plots to convince her dad that her 'no-good' boyfriend Freddie isn't so bad after all by bringing home instead a powerful marine who gives Vern a run for his money; and ""Hypochondriac,"" one of a number of episodes featuring the ever-so-charming Gertrude Hoffmann as the hilarious elderly neighbor, 'Miss Odetts.'

I highly recommend this collection for fans of Gale Storm and early comedy TV. The combination of highly clever writing, superb physical comedy, and top-rate actors make it a most charming viewing experience.",1403395200,13,1158,5.03125
2790932,5,B000O5B4EM,"I got this for a friend and ordered a few more for myself. I remember this show when I was a kid,just good programs back in the 50s and 60s,I injoyed going back in time ,it was fun to see these old shows again,thanks to who ever got these redone ,they did a pretty good job.",1387152000,,274,3.9107142857142856
2790933,5,B000O5B4EM,Fun to watch. Brings back memories. Rather watch these old shows than current reality TV! Look forward to other shows from the era being released.,1363392000,,146,4.88
2790934,2,B000O5B4EM,"Volume 3 contains 6 episodes that are also on Volume 2, so if you purchase Volume 2 you will also have Volume 3. It is not presented that way however. I ended up giving Volume 3 to a friend but I still felt ripped off because I bought the same thing twice, which I feel is irresponsible of Amazon. I wonder how many others this has happened to.",1252454400,23,344,4.073529411764706
2790935,1,B000O5B4EM,"When I purchased My Little Margie DVD Collection, there were no other DVDs on ""My Little Margie.  When I purchased THIS ""Volume 3,"" Vol. 1 & 2 were not advertised as yet. It was only after I had made the purchase that they were put up. I assumed that it was Vol III of the DVD Collection. So, I was very upset when I received ""Vol 3"" and everything on it was on the DVD Collection. Just wanted to point that out.

If you buy the DVD Collection AND ""My Little Margie"" Vols 1, 2 and 3, you might be wasting your money.",1180396800,32,516,4.0
8183048,5,B000O5B4EM,"Reviewers have mentioned a duplication of episodes with the 2nd and 3rd series sharing 6 identical episodes. I don't know why the Collections would make them that way. Each new series you would assume to be new episodes. Regardless my review is to inform purchasers there are other formats to buy My Little Margie as well as Ms Storms follow-up series, The Gale Storm Show, Oh Suzannah!. They're currently available on a site called Nostalgia Merchant that has tons of old TV and movies. The NM series have 24 episodes on 6 discs each. The Margie series episodes correspond to Series 1 and 2 on Amazon. I purchased this 3rd series since I compared episode titles and found all 10 on this series are episodes not included anywhere else, yet. Just compare episode titles if you have episodes now and make sure you don't duplicate episodes.  I do enjoy all the fun!",1495152000,,862,4.671052631578948

8183052,5,B000O5B4EM,"I am such a fan of the classic TV sitcom shows.  My family immigrate to the USA from Sicily in the late 50's and I was mesmerized with watching television. In those days we did not have a variety of shows to watch but what was available to us was just so funny, wholesome and oozing with clean humor. I practically learned English from watching shows like The Honeymooners, I love Lucy, Father Knows Best, leave it To Beaver, My Little Margie and Ozzie and Harriet.  I am so glad that I was fortunate to witness the Golden Age of TV. God bless the USA.",1453852800,3,552,4.247619047619048
