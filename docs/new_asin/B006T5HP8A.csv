There are strong performances by well-known dancers and some by dancers I didn't recognize but found every bit as enjoyable.  I found the dances all lively and engaging - you don't see any dancers who are just going through the motions.  In my opinion, there is not a wasted moment in the DVD - all great, entertaining belly dance.  This is a good companion DVD to ""The Sensual Art of Bellydance"" - production values are very good and the dancers are displayed well with a minimum of background distraction.  I found the quality of both the dancing and filming to be excellent and even throughout.

Some highlights for me:

Another dance by Rahana.  I have only one other dance on another DVD and I really enjoy it.  She turns out a solid performance without too much drama, but she connects well with the audience.  She obviously enjoys what she's doing and she also has beautiful, expressive eyes - all of which help in connecting with the audience.  You can't help but love her.

Nathalie  dance - a really well done drum solo  - lots of good moves packed into a small space.  I thought it was well paced, complex and fun to watch.

Another dance by Jayna.  Like Rahana, one you don't see as often but really fun to watch.  She has a crisp, elegant style - full of feeling but not too dramatic.  Also, she's one of the only dancers I've seen whose facial expressions are almost as fun to watch as the dance itself - not many faces are so beautiful and entertaining at the same time.

And top of the list, the gorgeous Desert Sunrise dance by Katia.  If you like slow moves, this is one you'll want to see.  I don't think I've seen a dance before in which the whole thing is done slow.  It's probably a good thing that the dance isn't too long - those slow hip moves can drive you crazy.

All in all, an excellent buy for anybody who loves belly dance.
