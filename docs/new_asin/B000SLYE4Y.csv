2887490,5,B000SLYE4Y,I attended this event live and it was one of the best PPV events I have ever attended. Those fools below are talking about crap that has nothing to do with this exact show so their reviews are pointless. Abyss vs Tomko was brutal and the main event was 4 1/2 stars easy.,1186444800,,270,4.113207547169812
2887491,2,B000SLYE4Y,"My first review was how I thought TNA was going into the dumps because off all the former WWE stars they signed and how TNA ignored the X-division. Well I watched this PPV and it sucked. Heres a run down

Rhino & Senshi VS LAX: A weird mix of Senshi and Rhino. I like how Tenay summed up the match in the beginning. The match itself was good.

Note: Does Rhino have the worst luck in wrestling? He is given a spotlight for awhile and then its taken away from him. Then he is stuck in hardcore matches and is always beaten. Poor Rhino.

Chris Sabin VS ""Black Machismo"" Jay Lethal: The ONLY reason to watch TNA.

Wycheck & Jerry Lynn VS Jason Storm & Ron Killings: Why does TNA bring in football players to wreslte? Right because WCW did so. I don't think it ever got them ratings though.

Bob Backlund VS Alex Shelley: Ive been liking Alex Shelley more lately, he is a great wrestler. Backlund can still go but I disagree with the reviewer who said he is more fit and stronger then Flair. I didn't like the ending to the match.

VKM VS Basham & Damaja: Ah, VKM. Wishing it was 1999 all over again so they can get so love. Well they way TNA is heading, they'll probably have there wish sooner or later.

Robert Roode VS Eric Young: Never liked Eric Young or the woman beater. There feud had a good story line if I actully cared about the wreslters in the match.

Team 3D VS Rick Steiner & Animal: Short match but I did enjoy it. Isn't Animal under WWE contract as a road agent or something?

Sting VS Christopher Daniels: A short match and very pointless. Daniels needs more to do in TNA then jobbing to Sting.

Abyss VS Tomko: One reason why I got this PPV and I was disappointed. It was a typical hardcore match and the edited a scene. The ending were Tomoko got the Black Hole Slam on the glass was stupid. The glass looked very fake but good job to Tomko for selling it.

King of the Mountain Match- Kurt Angle VS Christian VS Samoa Joe VS Chris Harris VS AJ Styles: One of the dumbest matches in the history of wrestling. Yes, it did have alot of cool spots but I thought the match and how it played out sucked.

Overall, anther TNA disappointment. Ive watched alot of TNA PPV and I really cant find one that doesnt have a two matches I skip over. The matches that are always good are x-division and the tag team matches from 2005. The main events are usual always bad.",1185753600,,2372,4.235033259423504
2887492,5,B000SLYE4Y,"Okay so Dustin Rhodes is someone that nobody is kicking down the door to see but, to make stars you have to bring in wrestlers that people already know. Dustin Rhodes a former WWF Intercontinental Champion! A title once held in high esteem...is set to battle ""Wildcat"" Chris Harris and now we've set a feud that will help carry Chris Harris over...not take him over but help carry him over. Oh Wait! This doesn't even happen at Slammiversary does it! That was Victory Road...So let's talk Slammiversary 2007. AWESOME EVENT! Rhino & Senshi vs. The Latin American Exchange, Eric Young vs. Robert Roode, Tomko vs. Abyss and The ""King of the Mountain"" Main Event...all 5 star matches! Sting vs. Christopher Daniels and Rick Steiner & Road Warrior Animal vs. Team 3D were old school reminders not to mention ""Black Machismo"" Jay Lethal vs. Chris Sabin in that category! Frank Wychek & Jerry Lynn vs. ""Cowboy"" James Storm & Ron ""The Truth"" Killings great entertaining filler. Alex Shelley vs. Bob Backlund, if your not a fan of Alex Shelley then you can't say you liked Ricky Steamboat & The Dynamite Kid. Dynamite, Steamboat and now, Shelley, have a style in the ring that can only be claimed by them. There is something that makes you want to see them wrestle. Now I said a review from a true wrestling fan. One thing I will agree on is that TNA needs to stay away from renewing stars like Dustin Rhodes, like Chris Jericho and even RVD for 15 minutes of fame. Because even through some would like to see them, these wrestlers are past their prime and there is nothing like creating a wrestling superstar within the company. Who was Edge when Stone Cold was headlining events, who was Umaga before becoming a force, who was John Cena before the urban gimmick and who was Samoa Joe before TNA signed him. Now I know who they were before all this but now the world knows.",1185321600,3,1865,4.603603603603603

8205916,2,B000SLYE4Y,"TNA subtitled their annual anniversary show ""Massacre in the Music City"" because Slammiversary was not only a five year celebration for the promotion, it was also a return home to Nashville where everything started. Jeff Jarrett, TNA founder, was present after being absent while his wife struggled with cancer. Jeff received a respectful tribute from fans that night, and that contributed to the big event feel that TNA shows have rarely achieved. Unfortunately, the wrestling content of the show wasn't very good.

Not Worth Watching: most of the card was filled with short, seemingly meaningless bouts, but specifically disappointing were the Tag Team Championship match (which suffered from an injured Scott Steiner being absent from the show) and the Sting/Daniels match that reminded me of Sting's later WCW contests: short and filled with just enough work to get a reaction from the crowd.

Worth Watching: the X-Division Title match was solid, as was the opener. The main event King of the Mountain Ladder match for the new TNA Championship was a giant, over-complicated cluster that succeeded by having a lot of impressive spots and a gallery of the promotion's top workers putting out A+ performances.

Match of the Night: I'm not a big fan of hardcore matches, but Abyss and Tomko surprised everybody, I think, with their well-worked, brutal encounter that had everything from thumbtacks, glass and other plunder. There was one cheesy spot (jarringly cut from the DVD!) with Abyss falling into an obvious dummied bump, but the match still stands as an impressive encounter for both guys.

I still think this is one of the weaker Slammiversary events TNA has done, which is a shame since everything surrounding the matches was so well-done. It's a shame the wrestling couldn't live up to it.",1405814400,,1801,5.094915254237288
8205917,4,B000SLYE4Y,"The LAX(Homicide & Hernandez)-Rhino/Senshi tag team match was a great opener. The Chris Sabin-Jay Lethal-X Division title match was also great. The James Storm/Ron Killings-Frank Wycheck/Jerry Lynn tag team match was surprisingly good. The Alex Shelly-Bob Backlund match was  short but not that bad. The Vooddo Kin Mafia(BG James & Kip James)-Basham/Damaja tag team match was short but not sweet. The Robert Roode-Eric Young-Free or Fired match was not great but pretty good. The Team 3D(Brother Ray & Brother Devon)-Rick Steiner/Road Warrior Animal-Tag Team title match was watchable at best. The Christopher Daniels-Sting match while not a bad match,it was too rushed for it's own good. The No DQ match between Tomko & Abyss was smash-mouth,hardcore,extreme brawl. The King of the Mountain match to crown the first ever TNA champion(Kurt Angle vs Samoa Joe vs Christian Cage vs AJ Styles vs Chris Harris) was a hard-hitting,smash-mouth,awesome brawl. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1354060800,,983,5.301282051282051
8205918,5,B000SLYE4Y,"I like the cover art on this DVD. It's a take off on the Johnny Cash ""Walk The Line"" poster. Instead of Johnny Cash we've got Jeff Jarrett on the poster now. Jeff didn't actually wrestle at Slammiversary however.

I was at this event in Nashville, TN. It was a good pro wrestling pay-per-view.

I got a kick out of watching the DVD extra that showed the fans at the T.N.A. Fanfest standing in line and then later meeting the wrestlers. I met Kevin Nash and Kurt Angle there. WWE should do the same thing before every PPV.

Hard to believe that this PPV marked the five-year anniversary of TNA. I loved it when they ran a PPV every Wednesday night at the Nashville Fairgrounds.",1280275200,,676,4.392

This is TNA Wrestling's fifth anniversary show, and it takes place in Nashville, Tennessee it is the 3rd TNA pay per view to take place outside of the impact zone at universal studios in Orlando, Florida.

""The War Machine"" Rhino & Senshi Vs. The Latin American Xchange
This match was a great way to start off a pay per view, I pick homicide as the stand out wrestler in this match but all the wrestlers worked well together. They told a good story and Hector Guerrero provided a good balance to the match. Rating 4/5

Chris Sabin (C) Vs. ""Black Machismo"" Jay Lethal X Division Championship
This was a good match but it was too short for me i think they deserved at least 5 to 10 more minutes. Lethal was the standout performer for this match and he was way over with the crowd this guy is gonna be a big star in the future. Rating 4/5

James Storm & Ron Killings Vs. Frank Wycheck & Jerry Lynn
This was an average match not really a good ""wrestling"" match but it was entertaining at moments. It served it's purpose to get the Tennessee Titans involved in their home city. Rating 3/5

Mr. Backlund Vs. Alex Shelley
This match was way too short for me with unnecessary interference, I am disappointed because I believe Shelley is way better than this and at a big stage like slammiversary they should showcase his talent. Plus after the match it was like a big circus with everybody and their mother coming out and getting involved. Rating 2/5

VKM Vs. Basham & Damaja w/ Christy Hemme
This match was way too short for a pay per view, this type of stuff should be on impact leading up to the big pay per view. I am again very disappointed with this one. Rating 2/5

""E.Y."" Eric Young Vs. Robert Roode W/ Ms. Brooks
Eric Young made this match, he is a very entertaining person. This match was a breath of fresh air after the 2 previous disappointing matches. A great plus is when you get to see Ms. Brooks bare [...] now that's what I call in demand. Rating 3.5/5

Team 3D Vs. Rick Steiner & Animal  TNA Tag Team Championship
It was good to see Animal back in the ring but this was way too short for any kind of a title match on a Pay Per View, again this is stuff that should've been on impact instead. Rating 2/5

""The Fallen Angel"" Christopher Daniels Vs. ""The Icon"" Sting
I am a huge fan of both of these wrestlers, so this match was a huge disappointment to me as it was way too short. Again this is stuff that should've been on impact not on pay per view. Rating 2/5

Abyss Vs. Tomko No Disqualification Match
This was a pretty good match, Tomko took an amazing fall and a blackhole slam on some shattered glass. Tomko was also hitting Abyss with a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire. These guys put on a good show. Rating 3.5/5

King Of The Mountain Match For The TNA World Championship
Christian Cage Vs. Kurt Angle Vs. AJ Styles Vs. Samoa Joe Vs. Chris Harris
This was an awesome match it totally saved the pay per view. It was without a shadow of a doubt the best match of the night. This one is full of excitement and will keep you entertained until the very end. The dvd is worth buying for this match alone. Rating 5/5

This was a good show but there were way too many matches on the card which caused most of the matches to be way too short and alot of these matches were TV quality stuff and should not have been on pay per view. It is worth buying for the main event alone TNA collectors should buy it but if you are new to TNA I would buy Bound For Glory Or Genesis from 2007.",1201219200,,3534,4.25820895522388

1. Rhino and Senshi vs. LAX- I thought this was a good way to start off the ppv. I really liked both teams as I liked the power game by LAX and the speed by Senshi really worked well in this match. The one thing that I wish would have happened is I wish they would have gave it more time but it was a solid tag match with some near falls which made it entertaining. Winners Rhino and Senshi. Match Rating 7.5/10.
2. Chris Sabin vs. Black Machismo Jay Lethal for the X-Division Title- I really enjoyed this X-Division match. Sabin has had a long reign with that title so it added to the hype of this match. Not everyone really liked the new character of Lethal but I thought it was pretty cool. These two really worked well together as there was even a suplex on the outside of the ring. Lots of near falls lead to a great title match. Winner and new X-Division Champ Black Machismo Jay Lethal. Match Rating 8/10.
3. Frank Wycheck and Jerry Lynn vs. James Storm and Ron the Truth Killings- Now going into this match there was a lot of question of if this was going to be a bad match cause a football player was in it and not a wrestler well let me say I thought Wycheck did a great job for his first time. Jerry Lynn was the perfect partner as he worked really weel as storm match up with Wycheck's strength and killings matched up with lynn's speed. Pretty good match with back and forth action. Winner Frank Wycheck and Jerry Lynn. Match Rating 7/10.
4. Mr. Backlund vs. Alex Shelly- This to me was a awful match. I was not expecting a lot going into this match and that was not because of shelly that was because of backlund as I did not know why a almost 60 year old was in the ring. This was a 3 minute match at best and a total blow off. Winner Alex Shelly. Match Rating 2/10.
5. The Voodoo Kin Mafia vs. Basham and Damaja with Christy Hemme- This was yet another match that could have been kept off the card as it was another awful match and the crowd did not care about this match. This was kept short which was a good thing. Not much to say. Winners The Voodoo Kin Mafia. Match Rating 3/10.
6. Erie Young vs. Robert Roode with Mrs. Brooks in a Freedom Match- This was accualty a pretty good match even though these two have had a feud going on forever. I really liked the way Eric Young looked in this match as he had some high flying moves including a cross body off the top rope to the outside,. There were some funny parts in the match to including Eric pantsing Mrs. Brooks. The match restarted after Roode hit young with the chair and got the pin. Winner Eric Young. Match Rating 7.5/10.
7. Sting vs. Christopher Daniels- This was set up very well with a very good storyline and I was really excited for this match as they had a good feud going into it. The problem here is this match only got 7 minutes at best that is because they had the crap like VKM and Backlund on the card. Thes two did the best they could with there time and put on a solid match. Winner Sting. Match Rating 6.5/10.
8. Team 3D vs. Rick Stiner and Animal for the TNA Tag Team Championships- This was supposed to be stiner's vs. 3D but Scott got hurt and could not wrestle. These two teams really tried here but I think that age played a big part in the match as these two teams looked slow. An okay match but its to bad Scott got hurt. Winners and still TNA Tag Team Champs Team 3D. Match Rating 5/10.
9. Abyss vs. Tomko in a No DQ Match- Here is the surprise on the card. This match was not even booked for the ppv except a couple days before and it turned out to be the second best match on the show. This was a brutal match and it fit both men's style which is hardcore. There were so many sweet parts in the match including a blackhole slam into the glass and even a powerbomb type move into the tumbtacks. A great match put on by both men. Winner Abyss. Match Rating 9/10.
10. Christian Cage vs. Kurt Angle vs. A.J. Styles vs. Samoa Joe  vs. Chris Harris in a King Of The Mountain Match for the TNA World Heavywieght Title- Wow was this a great way to close the show. The crowd had been hot alnight but this is the hottest that they had ever been. This was set up a lot better than last years. The match was non stop action all the way thorugh. The best part of the match to me was Joe and Styles were on the tope of the cage and joe through him off the cage through a table below. There was also a sick spear by Chris Harris taking Christian off the ladder. Very good main event. Winner and new TNA World Heavywieght Champ Kurt Angle. Match Rating 10/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give TNA Slammiversary 2007 a grade of 65.5/100 which is a 66% which means this is a good ppv. It just makes that grade by a percent and this could have been a lot better of a ppv if they had left a couple matches off the card. Still a solid event and I think that you should pick it up. IF you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1188086400,3,5036,4.136734693877551
