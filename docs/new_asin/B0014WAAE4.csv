Although not their best season (3+4) it is a great and satisfying send off to a truly excellent television phenomenon. The only missing element is a live performance of ""Liquor And Whores"" but still remains a must see for any fan of the series. Every bit a legitimate part of modern North American folklaw.

3135871,5,B0014WAAE4,TPB always makes me laugh.  I love the off the wall twisted humor.  I just bought Season 6 & 7 from Amazon.ca for less than the price of one season on Amazon in the U.S.  The U.S. and Canada are the same region so why the big price difference?  Crazy........,1228694400,6,258,4.1
3135872,5,B0014WAAE4,This season is great too. Cory and Trevor are missed but they still made a good season. Phil and his burps are great and Bubbles is in rare form. I was happy with it. Now if they'd only do another season!,1223164800,6,204,4.0

3135874,4,B0014WAAE4,"TPB is so awesome! I gotta nail this for a star deduction due to the lack of Corey and Trevor, and this can be a little too 'scripted' at times, but Sebastian Bach's cameo saved it from becoming too stiff. ""Holy s**t I love model railroading! Rock and f***ing roll!"" Just hilarious!",1219536000,,282,4.4423076923076925
3135875,4,B0014WAAE4,"Can the trailer park boys get better that what they already have made ?
The answer is yes...and this season is great.
The whole season can be viewed in 1 night...so i extended my viewing for
2 nights and by the end of the show i was very pleased.
Lots of smoking and lots of drinking and lots of laugh.
.....for Bubble fans........Corky is back.....with a vengeance.....

3135876,4,B0014WAAE4,"The 7th and possibly final season of Trailer Park Boys has some bizarre moments that top anything that has come before. The presence of Sebastian Bach alone signals hilarious trouble. The loss of Trevor and Cory is handled well enough (Twiggy Alien Cory does an admirable job, but it's Philadelphia Collins that really creates some laughs with his huge belly and love of greasy burgers).

Bubbles loses his mind bit by bit and some episodes end with great ""what the heck??!!"" moments. All in all, it's a shame this could be the end of the show, but only because they were still capable of creating consistently funny episodes leading to a great closing episode.",1211932800,7,661,4.798245614035087

3135888,3,B0014WAAE4,"First off, I am a huge Trailer Park Boys fan and I am absolutely addicted to the show. Now that Netflix doesn't stream them here in the US, and the YouTube uploads aren't the best of quality, I went and bought some of the DVDs. I was disappointed to see that the episodes on the Season 7 DVD are letterboxed! Basically what Alliance did is take the original widescreen footage, and lazily put it into a 4:3 frame with black bars on the top and bottom. This isn't a problem if you watch it on a 4:3 TV, but if you want to watch them on a widescreen TV or monitor, you are stuck between having the image windowboxed with black bars on all sides, or to zoom the image in, reducing the quality. I don't know why Alliance couldn't have just made these DVDs in proper 16:9.

Also, I just want everyone to know, this is the only season affected by this. Seasons 1-6 were originally shot in 4:3, so the DVD releases of those seasons are un-altered.",1373932800,,940,4.251396648044692

3135890,5,B0014WAAE4,"You really have to start watching from the beginning to appreciate this show.  Its always been insanely funny.  The start was rough as far as the video quality and what not but thats what made the show even better.
I've fell in love with the main characters right away so I think thats what makes the show special for me.  I could watch Ricky, Julian and Bubbles do just about anything and enjoy it.  All they really do is drink, smoke dope and get into trouble but its always hilarious.
By far the best Canadian TV show I've ever seen and its right up there(behind UCB) in my all time favorite TV shows.",1334534400,,604,4.31858407079646

3135893,2,B0014WAAE4,"I did a search to find out why season 7 was not very funny..!! I am a new fan and found myself so entertained by the series that I bought the entire 7 seasons on DVD.
Everything changed after season 6 and the movie.
The whole style and dynamic of the show went flat. No Cory and Trevor...and no explanation...
Everybody looked like they were just going through the motions..
The series had a linear style.. and didn't jump around to different situations like it used to do. BORING..!!
Jim Lehey ? Where was the old funny guy? No friction between him and the three main guys... That was a major part of the dynamic.
Ricky wasn't as stupid any more.. Yesterday I saw the skinny son of Philadelphia Collin reached up and grab Julian's face... and Julian didn't hardly react..!! Julian punked..?? Who let that non response in..??
The stupid part of Ricky all of a sudden having a trailer of his own... loaded with weed... stupid..!! Too much centering on weed... like it was supposed to be funny in of itself.
All of a sudden they were centering on other people... Like at the model train convention. Some fat kid gets a big part... and the long haired rocker guy...

I cannot explain why there is just something about them that you just cannot get enough of, when you are watching different episodes where the movie. You almost feel like you actually do live in the trailer park yourself and that you are just one of the neighbors to see what is going on. My favorite character is bubbles, then, Ricky and Julian, but the guy that plays Mr. Leahy hopefully I spelled that right. I think he is one of the best actors I have ever seen to betray an alcoholic or drunk, then anybody I have ever seen. I have been watching the trailer Park boys from day one, but I must admit at the first time I myself do not know what to make of them in their form of comedy. But after the first episode. I was hooked, and I will always be one of their biggest fans and am 59 years old",1428537600,,848,4.114457831325301
