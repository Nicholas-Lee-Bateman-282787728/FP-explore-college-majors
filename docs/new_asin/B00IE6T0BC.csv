It provides the viewer an experience that can not be obtained in any other way, and in a sense to me that is pure art. The marriage between image and music, thanks to the geniuses who gave us this experience, is complete. It is a gift to us not to be missed.",1399939200,4,433,4.105882352941176

6260448,4,B00IE6T0BC,"A very engaging and almost hypnotic visual montage set to the music of Philip Glass. It reminded me of the film Koyaanisqatsi that I saw many years ago. Unlike that film which primarily showed time-lapsed photography of the frenetic pace of city life, this one focuses on human individuals looking directly into the camera and exhibiting their incredible range of emotional expression, expressions that you had to infer visually since the entire film had no dialogue. But there are also other shots involving urban and natural landscapes (I've never seen a Louisiana swamp shot so beautifully in black and white) and pictures of the moon. But the focus was mainly on the people looking directly at the camera (and the viewer) . I'm not exactly sure of the overarching theme (if there was one) but if you're in the right mood (which I was) and like the music of Philip Glass (which I do), you can be sucked right into the film and be mesmerized for an hour and a half. But it's definitely not for everybody.",1438819200,2,1006,4.6892655367231635

6260451,3,B00IE6T0BC,"Like Reggio's best-known work Koyaanisqatsi, this is abstract cinema: but (relatively speaking) not nearly as engaging. I am reminded of ""transitional"" images in the films of Tarkovsky: both in their painterly beauty, and the tremendous demands on the viewer's patience.

Reggio stresses that the film is ""aimed at the solar plexus, at the appetite within us all, the atmosphere of our soul. I see the film as a meditation, as a transcendental event."" More concisely: this is not entertainment. If, when watching films which run at a slow pace, you find yourself losing interest? If you need to know, ""What does it all mean?"" Expect to find Visitors frustrating; choose something else.

Despite having appreciated films as non-linear as the works of Stan Brakhage and Bill Morrison? My attention wandered. Several times.

It's not like anything I've ever seen before; I respect that kind of ambitious, singular vision. Even when the results can be frustrating and opaque. (Words which could, as well, describe this review?)

Much of the visual subject matter is--depending on one's opinion--hypnotic or monotonous. Most prominently: one shot after another of the human face (on a black background) changing expression at an agonizingly slow rate, if at all. Fertile ground for overinterpretation, as in the phenomenon of pareidolia. Think of the Man in the Moon, or the reputed appearance of the Virgin Mary on a grilled-cheese sandwich.

Visitors--with its apparent dearth of thematic material--cannot be summarized in a few simple words. (One might argue: if it could, there'd be no reason for it to exist in cinematic form). I did however find myself thinking of the bumper-sticker platitude, ""We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.""",1432857600,2,1803,5.246527777777778
6260452,1,B00IE6T0BC,"Horrible waste of time. If you like movies, this is not the one to waste your time on. No plot, no acting, just a bunch of losers posing with lousy music in the background. This is not art but garbage. I wish I could get my 3 dollars back.",1431820800,,239,3.8979591836734695

6260454,5,B00IE6T0BC,"Quick tip: Watch the interviews before you watch the movie.

For me, conventional movies work best if I know almost nothing going in. Visitors is the exact opposite. Godfrey and Phillip explain why. The purpose of Visitors is to allow each person in the audience to provide their own individual meaning to the film. The images are remote, the music is the bridge to access the images. Those are almost direct quotes. For me, Visitors achieves maybe 90% of its purpose.

Maybe another way to describe Visitors is like this: Imagine you are trying to do the very first painting in your life. The most important thing is that you want your painting to mean something. So first you try to start with a blank canvas. But that's too hard, its too empty, there's too many possibilities. So then you try with a paint-by-numbers kit. But that's too simple, it's too inflexible, it already has a meaning different from yours. Visitors is at the middle point, between a blank canvas and a paint-by-numbers kit.

My first thought with the images in Visitors was ""This *really* needs to be in color."" But that's wrong. In fact, my idea about color came from the extraordinary beauty of the B/W images. Several of the outdoor scenes were shot in infrared, which gives them an other-worldly beauty. The portraits are as beautiful as any portraits in the Koyaanisqatsi line, or the Baraka line. Visitors seems unique in the way a portrait first begins as a static picture, and is then transformed by slow motion into eloquent human expression. Words can't really describe it.

The music is another aspect of Visitors which is a lot different from most films. The interviews say it best. Basically, the music doesn't interpret the images. The music doesn't lead the audience around by the hand. The music invites and enables the audience to provide meaning. The music is like a collection of paints and paint brushes. It gets the audience involved by speaking to the heart, not the mind. It doesn't ask for thinking, just listening. The audience chooses what to think. That works, for me.

Visitors is the kind of movie I can explore. I look forward to going back into it again, maybe 6 months from now.",1422921600,11,2186,4.742105263157895

6260457,4,B00IE6T0BC,"In Visitors Reggio continues exploring the issue of the impact of technology in our lives. Unlike the Qatsi trilogy, this film is slow and leisurely, but no less shocking.  The edition of the DVD is excellent, as it was expected.",1405123200,,229,4.725

Visitors just is; An unexplainable conjuring of breathtaking compositions. The crash course to find the empathic value in the expressions of others. The life of many through the eyes of another. A decadent facade of unoriginal thoughts which is prone for rediscover.

6260460,5,B00IE6T0BC,"I won't go into the background of this film, either you are familiar with Godfrey Reggio or you're not.  Suffice to say, while Visitors carries a lot of the recognizable DNA of his previous works like the Qatsi trilogy, it is a wholly different artistic experience.  Visitors is meditative, slow, and far more of a focused experience.  The thing that will instantly blow away anyone who has seen Reggio's previous works is the attention to the visuals.  An insane amount of CGI is used in this movie to not only balance every image to look like traditional silver black-and-white film, but to also enhance the similarity between shots (especially the shots involving people).  We're used to seeing CGI in movies to make giant monsters and explosions and all that, but this level of work to create uniform visuals is pretty mindblowing when you see it on screen.  As something of a photography buff, I have to say each shot in this movie is utterly gorgeous.
The movie is, of course, not for everyone.  Much slower than the Qatsi films and with an inner meaning that is not entirely obvious.  Anyone familiar with Reggio's work already knows that he is often sometimes bleakly critical of modern society and its dependence on technology.  Visitors is making some comment on that, but the film's larger meaning is mostly vague and mysterious, which I think personally adds to its charm.  The word ""pretentious"" has been thrown around in reviews both here and in the media, but there's nothing remotely pretentious about the movie...it's just obviously a very specific work of art that demands more attention than what normally passes for cinema these days.  Initially, the film kinda baffled me, but then it slowly began to work it's magic on me and I realized how truly masterful it was.",1404691200,23,1786,4.842105263157895
6260461,4,B00IE6T0BC,"Visitors is the fourth collaboration of director Godfrey Reggio and composer Philip Glass, advancing the film form pioneered by The Qatsi Trilogy, the non-spoken narrative experience where each viewers response is radically different yet extremely visceral. In Visitors, the focus is less on landscapes, more on the human face. There are close-ups of individuals and groups, children and adults, against a black background, staring straight into the camera, sometimes with glimmers of expression. The series of faces is occasionally broken with shots reminiscent of the trilogy  a ferris wheel, a moonscape, trees growing in water.

This odd documentary is hardly for everyone. Though it is only 80 minutes long, director Reggios decision to limit the number of shots to 74 gives the film a much longer feel. The editing isn't exactly action flick speed. The staring faces and Glass music provide an almost trance-like feel. I can see how viewers would have to fight off sleep if they attempt to watch the film in one sitting. In 1964, Andy Warhol made Empire, a film slightly longer than eight hours, in which the camera focuses solely on the Empire State Building. Visitors isn't quite that static, but it does challenge the viewers patience.

Blu-ray bonus extras include interviews with Godfrey Reggio and Philip Glass, making-of featurette, and behind-the-scenes footage.",1404086400,,1376,5.302752293577981
6260462,5,B00IE6T0BC,"Five stars not so much as compared to the entirety of cinema, but because it is a must see.  This is gallery art, that is, it has no real story line, but is more of an audio-visual experience.  People who state it ""fails"" as a movie in the traditional sense are absolutely right but, I think, miss the point of this work.

On the visuals: The vast majority of the scenes are super-slow motion of people and time lapse of the landscape, they are both exceptionally fine detailed and beautifully rendered in black and white--Ansel Adams would be proud.  Prolific use of apparent infrared sensors on trees (making green leaves pure white) and ultra high contrast on the outdoor scenes gives a striking effect, but it's strangeness compared to the faithfully reproduced images of people's faces was a little puzzling to me.  We are given lots of time to examine the expressions of the people, especially the children, in a way that is rare in cinema.  The scenes are akin to the ""slow people"" candid street scenes in Koyannisqatsi and Baraka, but here we have studio shots, professionally set up and staged.  So they lose a context and force the viewer to create one.  I think that's what Reggio had in mind.  It forces the audience to create their own story line, if they feel a need for one.

On the audio: Philip Glass has created some of his finest work here.  He has tempered his minimalist style with Richard Strauss-like lush orchestration, transitions similar to Wagner opera and harmony reminding us of Anton Bruckner.  In fact, 2 or 3 minutes of the score seemed like it could have been written by Bruckner.  The result is coherent, a symphony related to but not a slave to the visuals.  The edge of the maddening repetition Glass is known for has been mitigated, and as a result this music is not as ""memorable"" as some of his other work.  The style and content remain intact, though, gloriously dressed up and beautifully performed and recorded with ultimate precision.  At times I found the music holding my attention more than the visuals, thinking ""what's going to happen next?"" with the soundtrack, not the ""story"".

On the concept:  There will never be another Koyannisqatsi.  Viewers looking here will not find some deeper insight based on that film's formula.  That said, Reggio's vision which Ron Fricke made happen in the 1970s is here, if you look for it.  His pessimistic view of our life on this world, quoted as follows
We are on a treadmill, he says, were all pursuing our technological happiness without realizing that the price we pay for that is the plummeting of our humanity and the planet we live on.
is reflected in the juxtaposition of human actions and emotions, those of other living things on this world (portrayed by a female gorilla), and the passage of time on the surface of the earth.  But so can an examination of what is possible in the human spirit.  My interpretation, for what it's worth, is that while we actively participate in our ""program"" of life every day in an almost manic way, we need to stand back and realize we are just visitors to a time period on this world.  Such a perspective can certainly help us at least keep our sanity.",1403827200,12,3183,4.652951699463327
6260463,4,B00IE6T0BC,"Visitors is Godfrey Reggio's fourth feature length film, and it is quite different from the 3 movies before that make up the Qatsi Trilogy. This film is comprised of just 74 shots, meaning that the average shot length in the movie is over 1 minute long. In today's media frenzied world, that is somewhat of an accomplishment, and it is certainly part of Reggio's schtick this time around. He is insisting that we take the time to actually observe the world around us, rather than experience it in fragmented flashes. In Visitors, the viewer certainly gets a chance to take a deep look into the moving portraits that are presented before their eyes.

I had a chance to see this at the NYC premier (where I was able to meet with Reggio personally and also listen to a panel with Reggio, Kane, Glass, and Soderbergh), and now that I've had a chance to see it again on disc, I feel I can actually give it an honest review. Though this film is quite slow, it demands that you give it your full attention. It wants you to see every subtle movement (and they are very subtle at times). The film presents many, many close-up portrait shots of people either staring into the camera (which was placed behind a mirror according to the panel discussion), or has them reacting to something on a screen. One of the stars of the film is a female gorilla, who is positioned in front of the camera just like the human close-up shots, which draws an interesting parallel, and allows you to see and compare the subtle emotional shifts between the humans and the gorilla. The film is shot in color, but was digitally reduced to black & white. The black & white gives the images a particular sharpness that I really enjoy. It also allowed for them to completely black out the background (what Reggio referred to as the 'blackground'), which gives the portrait shots a real depth and richness, which are wonderfully enhanced by Philip Glass' beautiful and at times quite haunting score. One of my favorite parts of the entire film is when the shot consist of only a hand using some kind of touch screen device, but all you can see if the hand, interacting with complete darkness. I found it to be brilliantly entertaining to watch such actions in slow motion and completely isolated from reality. The only speck of color you receive is watching the Earth rise from the surface of the moon, which then leads to the ending of the film, placing the audience as just that, mere observers of the world, and not actual participants in it.

In the end, I believe fans of Reggio's work will appreciate this movie for what it is. I just warn viewers, don't go into this movie expecting the high energy madness you'd get from Koyaanisqatsi or Naqoyqatsi. This movie is slow and methodical, and it's presented that way with purpose from the director.",1402358400,3,2817,4.598409542743539
6260464,1,B00IE6T0BC,"Friedrich Nietzsche said, ""The truth is ugly: we have art so as not to perish from the truth.""  It's a great quote.  A version of that phrase is on some of the poster art for director Godfrey Reggio's latest movie.  But it alone does not elevate the movie to the level of art.  In fact, I'm not sure that calling this strange, arty, pretentious conceit a ""movie"" is fair because the popular use of that term conjures up the notion that there's some kind of flow to the images that connect to a greater meaning or story.  I loved Reggio's KOYAANISQATSI -- his brilliant 1982 non-narrative film about ""life out of balance.""  It was at the time avant-garde, experimental and powerful with images that were beautiful and sometimes searing.  The final effect was an emotional and spiritual epiphany that made real what we somehow already suspected but had not yet widely defined.  And Phillip Glass' great score was a perfect fit to the stunning cinematography of Ron Fricke.

I had high hopes for Reggio's newest film and had read glowing reports of how it offered ""the audience an experience beyond information about the moment in which we live.""  Don't all films in some nebulous way do the same thing or at least strive to tap into some facet of the zeitgeist?

The sad truth is that VISITORS is a major fail.  Yes, the black and white cinematography is stunning in a 4K digital projection, but the final result is 80 tedious minutes composed of only 74 shots where nothing really happens in the near motionless images.  The term ""motion picture"" is not really applicable here as there's not much in motion the picture.  There are a number of not particularly interesting close-ups of barely moving facial portraits, starting with an impressive gorilla head shot.  There are some landscapes and ""dancing"" fingers.  Glass' score is effective but delivers no meaning or meditative enhancement to the obtuse mages.  I discovered later that the ""dancing"" fingers represented hands on a smart phone or computer although there is no such device in the frame.  The final shot of a tiny, full-color earth rising from the desolate moon's pale horizon is, at this stage of our collective image consciousness, rather obvious and decidedly trite.  This Stephen Soderbergh presentation is a meditation aimed, according to director Reggio, at the ""atmosphere of the soul.""  Good luck with that.  What is obviously meant to be spellbinding and transcendent was for me a test of my tolerance.  But please don't take my word for it.  As with any art (if this is indeed art), meaning is in the eye of eye beholder.  You have been warned.",1401580800,14,2618,4.805369127516778

8641457,2,B00IE6T0BC,"I don't usually post reviews but I felt compelled to write this one. I was/am a huge fan of the Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka films from my college days and those films have had a profound impact on how I view cinema and how I view the state of humanity. That said, I can't say i feel the same way upon viewing this film (at least as much as I could stand, which was only so much). The camera work and music were top notch, some of the best hi fidelity film/portraiture I've seen in B&W and Glass's music has always been recognizable and hauntingly pleasing to listen to, though I don't actively seek it out. I'll probably be labeled as one of those viewers who just ""don't get it,"" but oh I get it, and can appreciate the technical quality of the production, but I feel what was missing from the whole movie, if it can be even called that, is a story.

The problem with this piece is once a viewer does ""get it,"" which can happen 10-20 mins into the film, there's not much substance in the revelation of subsequent images for the viewer to keep getting. The chronological order in which these scenes are presented have no major impact on the overall story, or lack there of, for whatever message the filmmaker is trying to convey. Meaning all these scenes could be flipped and interchanged and you'd still have the same damn movie, save maybe the ending, which I did not get to, which makes for a monotonous viewing. Compared to Koyaanisqatsi or Baraka, which tend to show the beauty of nature in timelapse, then the destruction of nature, followed by the hecticness/horror of mankind's behavior in timelapse, the lack of any semblance of a plot keeps the viewer from being engaged enough to wonder what's next, which I feel is a very important aspect of a non-verbal film.

One can argue that many music/image films that don't have a plot have been quite successful, such as timelapses of night skies and the Milky Way set to music, and yes, those are striking, which leads me to my next point, and that's just how utterly mundane and slightly uncomfortable looking into a stranger's face in B&W for over a minute in superslow motion can be. I don't know too many who find staring into the eyes of 50 individual strangers throughout the day in silent repose as they do normal activities enjoyable. I feel that level of intimacy is usually saved for loved ones or a significant other, and the act in itself carries with it a certain level of trust, understanding and comfort of the individual, yet the filmmaker starts off the bat with this and mostly only this. Pretty unnerving and just really weird. That said, I know of many a people who just stare at clouds, mountains, ocean waves, and find that activity enjoyable and something to seek out. That with the fact that there is no background or context to tie this face staring into, which I also feel is needed to give some platform for the message being conveyed, and it becomes to me some sort of face fetish exercise (first time I've used that word). Which in turn can be a commentary of how narcissistic our modern technological world has become. But how can one tie this film to the present world when its lack of context makes it so that, aside from the hi-fidelity photography and clothing, the audience (in the past or future) doesn't really know when this whole deal takes place. It could be fifty years ago or a hundred years from now. Does the filmmaker suggest that we've been in the this trance since the industrial revolution or is it the current technology that has gotten us this way?

That previous argument does have it holes but my last one is just how bleak and pessimistic this film is. Black and white helps to encourage that. At least with previous films (such as Koyaanisqatsi), there is beautiful nature to look at to juxtapose our destructive ways, and make one think, ""hey, maybe we shouldn't destroy nature because its beautiful and gives us joy, etc. etc."" This film just shows people and hands and monkeys and buildings and hey, I get it, the filmmaker must be sad and depressed and ashamed and embarassed at the state of humanity, but the way he portrays our habits on camera feels very alienating, and unfortunately shows a lack of faith and hope. But isn't that what the previous films were about, albeit interjected with indigenous people and religious individuals living the old way of the tribal community. This just shows alienated individuals who may or may not actually have happy lives, but the way its portrayed suggests the latter. Anyways, I just had to let some of that out because I felt very strongly about Koyaanisqatsi and the disappointment was too much to bare. That said, I found the hands much more interesting to view for some reason. I feel this is more of an art piece that belongs in something like The Hirschorn that only very artsy avante guard people like Yoko Ono would thoroughly enjoy. I mean, primal screaming has its place in the world, but as I've said, or not said, it definitely is not for everyone. Oh well, off to lunch.",1463529600,,5039,4.571902654867257
8641458,3,B00IE6T0BC,"It may be too strong of a word, but I liked KOYAANISQATSI and, to a lesser degree, NAQOYQATSI. Maybe I shouldn't use ""like,"" when ""appreciate"" would be a more accurate description. For what it's worth, Godfrey Reggio has a distinct style of ""documentary"" filmmaking that combines images and music in interesting ways, and VISITORS is no different in that regard. Where this particular film failed for me is its extreme obliqueness and refusal to contextualize anything or even hint at a possible meaning. Perhaps it's my fault and I ""just don't get it,"" but film appreciation goes both ways, and I shouldn't have to do all of the work. Still, however boring or unengaging I found it, the photography was nothing less than stunning and Philip Glass' music was excellent as usual. As for what's in the film, there was a lot of slow-motion close-ups of people's faces expressing a range of emotions, time-lapse photography of natural elements and man-made structures, a close-up of a gorilla, and aerial photography of the moon's surface. I suppose I could conjecture, based on what is shown and the title, that humanity is interconnected in our emotional expression as well as being ""visitors"" to Earth (in that we aren't here forever). There was also some juxtaposition between natural and artificial things, but that element was common in both of the previous Reggio films I watched. To be honest, I don't know quite what to make of VISITORS. It looks pretty and has a great score, but its meaning eludes me, and that's why I found it frustrating.",1460592000,,1547,4.885931558935361
