4098382,4,B0039UU3OQ,"Very good Gordon Scott Tarzan film.  Not the best one but very entertaining.  Tarzan has to help a bunch of over-privileged Brits and Americans who have crash-landed their private plane in the jungle.  Along for the trek is a traitorous big game hunter and a hostile local tribe that is into human sacrifice.  Some exteriors filmed in Africa, but a lot of it filmed on a soundstage.  Unfortunately Scott talks in the me Tarzan you Cheeta patois.  Other than that one of the better ones.  The quality of the DVD is very good.  Highly recommended.",1437868800,,545,4.663157894736842
4098383,3,B0039UU3OQ,"Released in 1957, Tarzan and the Lost Safari stars Gordon Scott as the ape man who assists five survivors of a plane crash near the Opar tribe, savage Africans known for sacrificing white people. A great white hunter enters the picture and seems to want to help the survivors, but Tarzan smells something fishy. This incidentally was the first Tarzan film in color.

The plots great and the movie features many positives. For one, Scotts one of the best actors to play Tarzan and went on to star in a couple of the best Tarzan films, 1959s Tarzans Greatest Adventure and 1960s Tarzan the Magnificent. The African locations are meshed well with the studio work and the studio sets look great, considering the time period. Its sometimes hard to distinguish between authentic Africa and studio Africa. Theres quite a bit of action, numerous shots of animals and I enjoy the scenes where Tarzan interacts with the wildlife, like the lion (which isn't faked).

Unfortunately, there are some bad elements. For instance, the eye-rolling way a vine is always conveniently nearby for Tarzan to easily swing/climb to where he needs to go. Why sure! Then theres this kiddie vibe thats hard to explain, like the producers were trying to appeal to five year-olds, which is strange because there are quite a few adult-oriented elements. What couldve been a quality Tarzan flick is sunk for these two reasons.

While Scotts interpretation of the ape man is good the writers have him speaking limited English in the manner of Weissmuller, which is in contrast to Burroughs book version where Tarzan can speak several languages fluently. I can live with this, however, as its a movie interpretation of the character. This changed with Scotts two last films as the ape man, noted above, where his portrayal was more faithful to Burroughs.

The film runs 86 minutes and was shot in the Congo, Africa, as well as Iverson Ranch, CA, and studio sets in England; plus stock African footage.

4098389,4,B0039UU3OQ,"This happens to be one of my favorite Tarzan movies starring Gordon Scott who looks the part. The plot is simple, about a small group of wealthy American tourists taking an airborne safari tour of the dark continent and who naturally experience the adventure of a lifetime when they crash and are lost in Opar country.
Gordon Scott has the looks and physique described by Edgar Rice Burroughs in his Tarzan novels and the filmakers have made an attempt to refer to the books more. Here Tarzan speaks pretty good English and we get to see Opar tribesmen which is based on an ancient African mountain tribe who practice human sacrifice from the classic novels.
I've only given this 4 stars outta 5 coz the dvd release is alittle crap.

A. It doesn't play so well in either of my 3 dvd players. In fact it refuses to play in one of them at all!!!
B. it has NO special features, No Subtitles and NO scene selection.

Hope Warner will release a better set of Tarzan dvds in the near future like the Johnny Weissmuller boxed set releases which were better quality and play very well on all my dvd players.

Plus am begging Warner or whoever has the filmrights to please release the classic 1960s Ron Ely Tarzan TV series on dvd fully restored and upgraded with English subtitles to those with hard of hearing like my dad who grew up on the Gordon Scott and Ron Ely classic movie and Tv Series.",1323302400,2,1387,4.452755905511811
4098390,4,B0039UU3OQ,"I was very exited to find that the color Tarzan films are finally available on home video. I saw this when I was a kid and have been waiting years to watch it again. Gordon Scott sure looks like Tarzan should, and the color and filming hold up quite well. The only drawback to thes films is the Weismuller like speech pattern for Tarzan and they can be a bit dated in social relevance. But the main bad guy is white and he uses the natives to work his evil plan for him, so boo on him! I think ERB might have liked this. Tarzan explains his origin briefly to the safari members he's leading, and he makes it sound so normal. I liked seeing it again and hope in time to buy the Jock Mahoney and Mike Henry films, also.",1317427200,4,717,4.092198581560283
4098391,4,B0039UU3OQ,"This 1957 Tarzan film is the first Tarzan film that is in color since the series of Tarzan films began in 1932 with sound. It is the second film in which the body builder Gordon Scott plays Tarzan. The producers of the film take many opportunities to show Scott's developed body and muscles. They even have the women in the film admiring him.

 An airplane crashes with two women and three men in the area where Tarzan lives. It is about to topple over a cliff and Tarzan saves all five people. The five also meet a white hunter who, unbeknownst to them, promised the natives of a cruel tribe that he would give them four of the survivors so that they can sacrifice them to their god. He wants to retain one of the women, who is married to one of the men, for himself. He also promises to deliver Tarzan in place of the woman. Tarzan suspects this hunter from the first time that they meet. Both the hunter and Tarzan say they will to take the survivors out of the jungle to civilization.

 Viewers will enjoy watching to find out if the hunter is able to keep his promise to the natives in whole or in part, what Tarzan does, and who survives this adventure.",1315699200,5,1159,4.302752293577981
8392407,4,B0039UU3OQ,"If Gordon Scott's best Tarzan pictures were Tarzan's Greatest Adventure (1959) and Tarzan the Magnificent (1960), then Tarzan and the Lost Safari (1957) will just have to settle for third best. Gordon Scott had an interesting film career. He was picked out by a talent scout as he was working as a lifeguard at the Sahara Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. RKO producer Sol Lesser didn't waste time hiring him to replace Lex Barker as the ape-man. Scott did five Tarzan movies from 1956 to 1960 before he beat feet, concerned of being typecast. He then went overseas and starred in a string of sword & sandal pictures. The thing I remember most about Gordon Scott when he was playing Tarzan was how he would suck in his gut all the time, never mind how fit and muscled he was. It just looked weird.

Tarzan and the Lost Safari is Scott's third time playing the ape-man. One of the notable things about this movie is that Jane isn't here, thus no need for scenes of domestic bliss  la Ozzie & Harriet (or Rob & Laura) caught in the wilderness. No tricked-out tree condo in this one. Jane's absence also allows Tarzan to play the part of a, er, swinging bachelor. This is also the first time that a Tarzan movie was released in color, to be specific, in Eastman Color. By this time, MGM had regained the rights to the Tarzan franchise, so this is the first MGM production of a Tarzan film since 1942.

The plot concerns five well-heeled, spoiled-rotten snobs on a flight bound for Cairo, and - spoilers - it never gets to Cairo. There's ""Noodles,"" the society columnist; Carl, new father-in-law to a prince whose daughter's wedding they'd all just attended; Camidge Tate, who'd gone thru four husbands; and the feuding couple, Dick and Diana Penrod, who mean to separate once they get back home.

From jump Dick Penrod comes off as a class-A jerk. He's also the pilot, and you can blame him for the plane going down. On a whim, he dips the plane for a lower pass to get a closer look at the wildlife roaming below. He never saw the migrating flamingos until it was too late. Cue the plummeting plane.

This is where Tarzan comes in. He rescues the passengers off the plane and sets out to guide them to civilization. Obstacles include all manner of predators ranging from four-footed beasties, a tribe of Opar savages, and a sinister great white hunter in the shape of ""Tusker"" Hawkins (Robert Beatty). Hawkins offers to take the survivors to the coast, except Tarzan right away gives him the suspicious side eye. Maybe because Hawkins' intended path would take them thru dangerous Opar territory, and Hawkins doesn't seem too worried about it.

If you'd read Burroughs' volumes about Tarzan, then you're familiar with the lost city of Opar, and, so, you're clued in soon enough that this movie's take on Opar diminishes Burroughs' original glorious vision of a magnificent city and a massive trove of gold. You'll note that this movie came out during the 1950s, a period in which traces of colonialism yet lingered and racism so much more in your face, so, no surprise that the movie reduces Opar to a shabby native village. And, sorry to say, no La, the beautiful princess of Opar.

MGM's production values always were streets ahead of RKO's. Here, we're treated to actual location footage shot in Africa, in Nairobi, and it looks marvelous in color. In fact, at times, it's as if the movie takes a detour into National Geographics documentary territory.

Other nice touches. We get a scene in which Tarzan informs Diana of his origin of being raised by apes. There's a scene in which he repurposes a mink coat into something more practical. Later, he plays the bongos. Tarzan, by the way, makes a crap tour guide. Hear his patter as he guides the survivors thru the jungle: ""Watch bushes for snake. Watch high grass for leopard. Watch tree for leopard. Watch plenty for Opar men. Watch for bad ants. Kill quick with hot needle. They eat your eyes, eat your tongue, eat your meat. No eat bone."" I hope someone took notes.

The movie also revives the tradition of Tarzan having a romantic swim with a beautiful dame. This time, it's Betta St. John's turn to get in the water with the ape-man who just may be crushing on her character of Diana.

Disappointingly, the franchise continues the tradition of Tarzan's getting bashed on the back of his skull. I guess Lex Barker didn't have the monopoly on this, after all.

4 out of 5 stars for Tarzan and the Lost Safari. It's a terrific jungle adventure. And while this incarnation of Tarzan falls below Burroughs' depiction of him as an indomitable, intelligent, articulate specimen of man, he still exhibits substantial reserves of resource and intuition, auguring the impending arrival of a Tarzan that more closely resembles Burroughs' mighty Lord Greystoke than the barbarous simpleton popularized thus far in cinema. For triviaheads, Gordon Scott is the only actor to have portrayed Tarzan in both fashions.

Also, Cheta finds the booze. How does she keep doing this?",1527465600,,5012,4.708904109589041
8392408,4,B0039UU3OQ,This was the first Tarzan movie I ever saw when it came out and I was 7 years old and the perfect age to be in awe of the romance and excitement of this jungle adventure. From the opening theme music and the African photography one gets the feeling one is in store for high adventure. The story tends to be a bit cliched in Tarzan helping the stranded people. But to a 7 year old it was the grandest time ever. Watching him actually in Africa and swinging through the trees and defeating all the bad guys was everything a young boy could want. It is number 3 for me behind Tarzan's Greatest Adventure and Tarzan the Magnificent and even 61 years later it still holds up really well as a great adventure film.,1512518400,,708,4.2518518518518515
