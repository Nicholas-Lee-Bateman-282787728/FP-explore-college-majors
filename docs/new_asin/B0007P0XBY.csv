2224900,2,B0007P0XBY,"It's a waste of money and time because 90 percent of the time, this DVD shows the interviews of Tsunami survivors from all over the world. It spends about 10 minutes talking about the cause of the tsunamis and the measures taken by some countries to look out for the arrival of the next ones. However, it also states nobody knows these measures will save lives.

Also, as reviewer, Himanshu Shangari, said it missed recent ones that hit Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia and Japan in March 2011. It's because this DVD was released in 2005.

If I just wanted to know tsunami disasters happened in the past, I could have searched the Web for free.",1332460800,4,642,4.573913043478261

2224902,4,B0007P0XBY,"This movie tells about the origin and creation of killer Tsunami waves and about the destruction caused by them in the past on Hawai, Japan and some places of U.S. It tells about the cause of Tsunami i.e an under sea earthquake due to collision of tactonic plates and thus displacing a great amount of water that runs to the shores with superspeeds and causes destructions on coastal areas. The concept is good and well picturised. The only thing missing is that it does not have the coverage of latest Tsunami that hit Sri Lanka, India Etc.",1111708800,65,541,4.587628865979381

8049788,2,B0007P0XBY,"As many have mentioned, this release date was 1997 and the information is informative, but the interviews were not what I wanted.  I wanted scientific information, which I found on other DVD's.  At one point they mentioned 25,000 dead was the highest death toll ever in a Tsunami ... this has to be very old information ....  The number of people presumed dead Dec 26 2004 in Asian tsunamis rose to more than 283,000, with Indonesian authorities announcing a further increase in the number of dead and missing.
For the price it's ok  ... for the scientific information it needs a lot of more information.",1472428800,,604,4.723809523809524
