8013576,5,B0001KL4QI,"I had bought the movie ""He's a Woman She's a Man"" thinking that it would focus on a romantic story plot, but instead it had my family and I laughing throughout the movie.  The pacing was light and quick, on contrary to regular Hong Kong movies.  The jokes were very funny as well, so if you're looking for something to make you laugh and wrench your heart, then this movie is definitely for you.",1152489600,2,395,4.324324324324325
8013577,5,B0001KL4QI,"Easily one of the best chinese romantic comedies of the era. There's just something very cute about a woman dressing up as a guy to try to win the heart of a guy. Okay, maybe that's just me...

In either case, it's a good movie, funny with lots of cameos of a few chinese acting legends. If you got a chinese girlfriend

and you rent this movie, you'll be getting some tonight. (laughs that is - get your filthy mind out of the gutter!)

Good movie for couples.

Anita Yuen, who plays the lead, got an award for her role. RIGHTLY SO!",1135728000,4,533,4.196078431372549

Also in the story is, Wing, a big fan of Rose.  Wing's big dream is to see Sam and Rose live happily together, if even from heaven.
  One day, Sam and his co-worker decide to try to make an ordinary boy a superstar and he announces the plan.  Many eager applicants swarm around them, Wing also gives it a shot, posing as a man and actually wins the role.  So, Wing begins to live with Sam and the story starts from here...

Rose begins to feel heartbreak and Wing do not make Rose unhappy though Wing also begins to love Sam.  The relationship becomes even more complicated....  You will enjoy the singing of Leslie Cheung in the movie.  If you like this, be sure to catch the second movie, 'Who's the woman, who's the man.' when it comes out.",986169600,6,1221,4.392857142857143
