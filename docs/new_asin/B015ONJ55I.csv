7445440,5,B015ONJ55I,"This recording of the 2015 revival of Ashtons La Fille Mal Garde was a box office triumph and it is easy to see why. The ballet has long been a great favourite with the public who have found the feel-good nature of the plot coupled with Ashtons choreography that underpins the relationships, or lack of them, between the various characters to be utterly beguiling. This entire production clearly gives the whole cast an enjoyable and rewarding occasion to share and demanding rehearsals have brought the complete presentation to a very high standard of technical and artistic excellence.

The lead roles of Lise and Colas, danced by Natalia Osipova and Steven McRae, impress with flawless technical assurance and their relationship on stage is seamlessly delivered. Seamless delivery also applies to other key character roles as well as the entire corps de ballet. This is a fluent and also sophisticated performance throughout and that description would equally apply to the episodes of the hens and cockerel, the maypole and storm scenes. All goes very smoothly and this is a first class stage presentation. The orchestral playing, excellently lead by Barry Wordsworth, is equally flawless with much telling musical detail brought out to be relished.

Curiously, this is the second HD recording to be made available of this ballet from the Royal Ballet by Opus Arte. The earlier version was made in 2005 and still looks and sounds well even if the newer version has the detectable edge as a result of ten years improvement in audio and video technology. Nevertheless, no-one is likely to choose one or the other on the basis of differences between two fine recordings.

Where the two differ is in the emphasis upon individuality and individual characterisation on the one hand and corporate sophistication and perfection on the other. Carlos Acosta and Marianela Nunez are delightfully unsophisticated in their characterisation thus producing a matching strong sense of spontaneity and this description could be applied to Widow Simone, Alain and the hens and cockerels. It also applies to the maypole and storm sequences and is a general impression throughout. The clog dance has a more clearly differentiated rhythmical grip with clearer tap steps and that is the only point where one might prefer the earlier version on technical matters alone. The newer version is just that bit slicker and gives the impression of greater sophistication as a presentation. That sophistication comes at the cost of the sort of straightforward joie de vivre which permeates the whole of the earlier performance in a way so often associated with Acostas own personality.

In summary, Opus Arte has delivered two equally superb choices of this ballet and preference will almost certainly come down to individual preferences of cast members. There is a strong case for collecting both versions as both give enormous satisfaction but in subtly different ways. More is not necessarily better but in this case it is!

This disc comes with the usual Opus Arte bonus of cast images. There is also a short introduction including rehearsal sequences and a fascinating discussion between Darcey Bussell and Lesley Collier who, based on her experiences of working with Frederick Ashton, worked with Natalia Osipova for this production.

This is a superb new recording and makes a perfect complement to the 2005 recording with Nunez and Acosta.",1448928000,13,3419,5.162454873646209

7445442,5,B015ONJ55I,"This is a pure delight.  Natalia Osipova is a brilliant and endearing Lise and Stephen McCrae a superb Colas.  The pastoral world that the ballet creates is perfect, and Osipova's impeccable sense of genre keeps Lise's joys and sorrows within it. Employing rather limited locales -- the farmyard and the house's one lower room -- a splendid variety is created by ribbons, sheaves of wheat, and other props.  The ensemble of rustics is a joy to watch, and Lise's hopeless suitor, stock type though he is (cf. ""Don Quixote"") is a marvellous comic dancer.  Even the greatest choreographers have their weak points, and Ashton's is dancers in drag doing clog dances, as Lise's mother is made to do.  This doesn't detract from a magnificent ballet, magnificently performed.",1448409600,,767,5.0078740157480315
7445443,5,B015ONJ55I,"This is a live performance of the Royal Ballet just released, and it is a gem. Radiating happiness, overflowing with joy, and beautifully choreographed by the immortal Frederick Ashton, this performance has the distinct advantage of extraordinary principal dancers.

Steven McRae as Colas has what I call ""watchability"". Many equally virtuosic dancers do not capture the eye as he does. Every extension of his arm to his beloved exudes longing. His expressions are loving and appear to come from within. It is as if he truly loves his ballerina, Natalya Osipova as Lise. She is every bit his equal, mastering the high jumps and tiny steps on pointe with artistry and finesse. On pointe, however, she is barely one inch higher than Steven, who does not seem very tall. But when he dances close to her as she's on pointe, he casts his head back so he can be seen, and seem to be taller. But his fine classicism and brilliant technique overcomes any height difference.

The production values are marvelous, with a sprightly corps de ballet and complex, wondrous dance scenes. Pink ribbon plays a large role in this ballet. Especially to be noted is the pas de deux with ribbon, lovely, creative, and again, complex. There is much to love about this ballet. Not to be forgotten is the Alain of Paul Kay, the laughable would-be suitor of Lise. He is adorably inept, clinging to his beloved red umbrella, and prancing about in vaudeville style. He's even been given Boris Johnson hair! Philip Mosley as the Widow Simone dispatches the memorable clog dance with verve and aplomb.
And the climax of the Maypole dance is a thunderstorm whose music must have been inspired by the thunderstorm scene in Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony. The brief prayer sequence at the end of the storm is taken literally from the last movement of the Pastoral Symphony, which is a prayer of thanksgiving for deliverance from the storm.
A treat, as they say, for the whole family.",1448064000,,1950,4.835329341317365
7445444,5,B015ONJ55I,"I'm growing to love Steven McRae, especially after seeing him perform live when the company performed at the Kennedy Center.  I expected him to be good in this as his talents seem well suited to Ashton choreography.  I've like Osipova in both Giselle and Swan Lake but wondered how her wonderful flair for drama would translate into this fun, light, Ashton ballet.  Answer is that she is great.  Her flashy, speedy foot work is a natural for the Ashton steps and she seems to really enjoy the fun aspect.  I have all the releases the Royal Ballet has put out for this ballet and this one may be the best.",1448064000,6,604,4.454545454545454
7445445,5,B015ONJ55I,"I was lucky enough to see this ballet at my local movie theatre earlier this year and could not wait until it was released on DVD.  It was the first time I have ever seen a ballet in a movie theatre when the audience applauded as though they were sitting front row at the Royal Opera House.  Charming, charming, charming describes the entire performance.  Steven McRae and Natalia Osipova were amazing and made you believe you were in the middle of a very happy and funny love story.  Paul Kay was the finest Alain I have ever seen dance this part.  You could almost see the devilish (as in funny) sparkle in his eyes as he danced.  Although I have seen this ballet danced several times by very fine artists, this performance was absolutely the most charming.  You do not need to love ballet to love this performance.  It will make you laugh and make you sigh.  Highly recommend!",1447891200,5,879,4.477987421383648

8734162,4,B015ONJ55I,"In 1961 Sir Frederick Ashton created perhaps his most ageless masterpiece. La fille mal gardee was a hit from day one and has remained popular in the international repertoire even as his other ballets have suffered in popularity. This is now the fourth commercial video release of this ballet -- the question is, how does it stack up against the others?

The most idiomatic and interesting video is probably the one available on ICA Classics that stars much of the original cast (Nadia Nerina, David Blair, Stanley Holden, and Alexander Grant). There you can see the mid-century British style, as well as the character dancing and vivid acting skills for which the Royal Ballet was so famous. However, video and sound quality are inferior, and the performance was filmed in a tiny TV studio. The best overall version is probably the 2005 release with Marianela Nunez and Carlos Acosta as Lise and Colas. Nunez is at her most charming, and Acosta adapts his bravura style very well to the gentle pastoral comedy. The two have wonderful chemistry.

The newest version stars Russian superstar Natalia Osipova and Steven McRae. Both of them are excellent dancers but they make an odd pairing. Osipova is a powerhouse -- she is famous for the height of her jumps and the speed of her turns. Her natural stage disposition is that of a spitfire -- her Lise is a lot like her Kitri and Coppelia. Feisty and fun. She's toned down some of the power in this gentler role but she needs a very strong personality onstage with her to be well-paired. Steven McRae on the other hand is all about elegant lines and an understated style. Some of his mannerisms can almost seem foppish. As I said, both great dancers, just not together. In fact, McRae had a telecast of Fille with Roberta Marquez which was never released commercially but was a much better pairing in terms of dancing temperament and style.

Phillip Mosley is a fine Widow Simone, and Paul Kay is a funny Alain. The corps de ballet is quite fine, dancing chickens and all. Video and audio quality are superb, although there is an over-reliance on close-ups.",1451952000,12,2105,4.745901639344262
8734163,5,B015ONJ55I,"This is probably the happiest ballet ever created! It will crack you up every couple minutes. There's not a single dull moment. The entire 120 minutes are all energetic and uplifting.  Natalia has impressive jumps and footwork as usual and demonstrates excellent acting skills in act 2. Steven is virtuosic, crisp, swift and light as a feather. Their on stage chemistry is extraordinary! They look so in love and make a very sweet couple. Barry Wordsworth's conducting is charming and vibrant. The choreography is very creative as well, such as Widow Simone's clog dance, Alain's funny moves, the entire crew's circle ribbon dance, Lise hugging and dancing with Colas over the locked door...Fantastic job by everybody in the company.",1450569600,2,733,5.159663865546219
