3129327,5,B0014CSNDY,"Shiva Rea's Flow Yoga For Beginners is a work of mastery.  She is one of the most creative yoginis teaching today. If you can connect with her at Exhale Studios in the LA area or at a Yoga Journal Conference, don't miss the opportunity to study with her.

This DVD emphasizes ""No yoga experience necessary.""  It is the first creative flow DVD truly appropriate for beginners.

This beautifully filmed video features Shiva's unique flowing style presented in such a way anyone can do it.

One of the nicest parts of training with Shiva and witnessed on this DVD is her non-stop awareness of exactly who she is teaching.

She constantly offers modifications for people with challenges in different parts of their body.

In a exercise program dominated by women, this DVD offers ""equal opportunity to men"".  It's going to be one of the DVDs I travel with
for those times I'm a road warrior and unable to hook up with a yoga class.

This DVD is the finest introduction to where the creativity of Shiva Rea is today.

I would give it 10 stars if they were available.

Namaste Shiva!

3129328,5,B0014CSNDY,Shiva is just wonderful in this breathtaking program. A solid beginner's workout--Shiva really breaks down the movements in flow yoga.  A solid workout for beginners but also challenging enough for Shiva fans.,1208304000,4,209,5.53125
3129329,5,B0014CSNDY,This is one of the most beautifully shot dvds I have ever seen.  Shiva's voice is calming and helpful as I learn this yoga practice.  I have been doing this almost every morning before work and what a great way to start my day.,1208304000,4,227,4.136363636363637
3129330,5,B0014CSNDY,"I think Shiva is the best yoga instructor around! Her voice is soothing & instruction is easy to follow. And what a beautiful production!

I've also purchased a couple of her other titles, Creative Core Abs & Fluid Power. They're also fantastic and the results are even better!",1208304000,3,277,4.770833333333333
3129331,5,B0014CSNDY,"I've done yoga before, but not for many years, so this DVD is the perfect way for me to get back into it. I can do the poses, so I don't feel like I'm missing out on half the DVD, but it shows me how to improve as well. Shiva is a truly amazing, inspirational instructor. The stunningly gorgeous scenery really helps me get into the spirit mentally as well.",1208304000,3,357,4.114285714285714
3129332,5,B0014CSNDY,"I'm sort of a newbie to yoga, but I've heard great things about Shiva Rea programs. While they look amazing, I found the poses in some of her programs a little bit out of my league and, ultimately, frustrating. I look forward to mastering these poses and then moving on to her other DVDs.",1208304000,3,288,4.351851851851852
3129333,5,B0014CSNDY,"I've taken classes with Shiva Rea and she's one of the best yoga instructors out there, so I'm really excited that she now has a program specifically for beginners. It's gorgeous to watch - shot in Hawaii - and, while still challenging, it is a great introduction to flow yoga.",1208304000,2,277,4.56
3129334,5,B0014CSNDY,"I was so glad to get another new Shiva DVD less than 5 months since her last one. This DVD was filmed in  Kauai , Hawaii as well as her next DVD's to be released this year and next year. This practice is aimed for beginners but everyone can enjoy it , the whole DVD is 70 minutes and has 4 segments (and savasana) that can be done seperately:
1. Foundation Flow - approx 14 min, Shiva starts with some breathing exercises on a rock near a beautiful waterfall and continues with simple poses like cat , cobra and some variations.
2. Beginner's Backbend Flow -approx. 20 min, there is a change of scenery and Shiva is in a beautiful garden with a lot of trees near a lake.
It is actually mainly standing poses - she prepares you for backbends in this practice with some lunge variations , chair with twists ,side bends, half splits and cobra variations and finally bow and camel. This segment might be quite challenging for true beginners but she shows easier modifications for most of the poses so it's definitely doable.
3. Relaxing Flexibility Flow - approx. 10 min , Shiva does simple stretches on the back , very similar to ""supine poses"" segment in Yoga Shakti it ends with a forward bend (badhakonasana) , it was very relaxing.
4. Beginner's Standing Pose Flow - approx 23 min . now she's at the beach , the clip from Amazon is taken from this segment and it is dark here too not just in the clip , it was probably shot at dusk. This is really a seperate practice cuz there is no sense of getting up for another energizing practice after the relaxing segment. It is a more challenging vinyasa that includes warrior 2 variations and some more backbends.
Too bad there is no matrix , because this segment is just stuck between the previous segments and the savasana ,it would be nice to do it before or after the second segment but since there are only a few chapters I guess it's not such a big deal to skip between them with the remote.
This segment also ends with a very short savasana , barely 2 minutes, which is another minor complaint but all in all I really enjoyed this practice and felt really stretched out , I can't wait for her next DVD's to come out.",1208304000,103,2167,4.3638613861386135
3129335,5,B0014CSNDY,It was the exact item I was looking for. Love the way she makes yoga flow.,1448323200,,74,3.6875
3129336,5,B0014CSNDY,These DVD's are a present for someone who loves Shiva Rea. She will be elated once she receives them. Thank you for the efficient delivery,1445904000,,138,4.56
3129337,4,B0014CSNDY,very good for beginners==she needs to use the regular terms for the yoga positions and not the hindu nam es,1444953600,,107,4.4

3129339,5,B0014CSNDY,I am excited to have learned about Shiva Rea as I have been looking for a yoga DVD for beginners.  The pace is great!  I am looking forward to practicing three to five times per week and advancing to the next level when I feel like I am ready.  Thank you Shiva Rea!,1442448000,,265,3.9622641509433962

3129341,2,B0014CSNDY,Booooring! unless you are a total beginner this video is useless,1440979200,,64,4.909090909090909
3129342,5,B0014CSNDY,It does not get better than Shiva Rae for slow flow Vinyasa style yoga. This disc allows for you to condition your body for the flow or to do the full practice. Excellent!,1439683200,,171,4.212121212121212
3129343,1,B0014CSNDY,"I have several ""beginner"" yoga DVDs in my collection. This one is my least favourite.  The poses are difficult to follow without repeatedly looking at the screen.  Shiva moves from one pose to another quite quickly and often without an advanced verbal cue.  The quick transitions do not allow the body time to completely settle into some poses. There are several instances where the sound track is not aligned with the video.  The whole thing feels disjointed and lacks flow in my mind.  Every once and a while I come back to this video thinking that now that I am advancing in my practice that I will be able to enjoy this more:  this has not been the case.  It's time for me to get rid of this.

I would highly recommend any DVD's with Elaine Brower or other videos in the ""Element Yoga""'series.",1437436800,4,797,4.486111111111111

3129346,5,B0014CSNDY,"This is a long practice, but very good in helping you feel better. I have been out of the workout loop for awhile and got this to limber up again. I love doing her yoga sessions. I have her prenatal yoga dvd, and since I am finished having babies, I wanted one or two of her non pregnant yoga videos. I love this instructor. She is very good at her instruction and craft. I enjoy doing this yoga session.",1430784000,,404,4.1265822784810124
3129347,3,B0014CSNDY,"I like how intense the work out is, but this is not what I was expecting. Completely different from her pre/post natal and mommy and baby yoga formats. A little to eccentric for my personal taste.",1429315200,,196,4.472222222222222

3129350,5,B0014CSNDY,"I like this video and the workout, a more ""workout"" type of yoga in terms of speed and poses.  Good cuing on the moves so it was easy to follow along.

I am a beginner and did not find it too difficult.  Like other videos I have used, it is a good idea to watch it, even if fast fowarding a bit, to get an idea ahead of time.

Highly recommened if you want a workout type of yoga.",1420243200,,380,3.7721518987341773

3129353,2,B0014CSNDY,"I'm a typical guy that is trying to build flexibility as I get older (36 now), so I don't get injured and wanted to take up yoga more regularly. This is not a well instructed beginner DVD because she has you doing fairly difficult poses for the beginner with little instruction or modification. What I mean by little instruction is she barely tell you how to get to your next move or what to what out for as a beginner. I found myself having to look up @ the screen more often to try to figure out what she was doing versus having a good instructional audio track. Didn't really feel good about the DVD or how I felt afterward",1411084800,2,626,4.225

3129357,5,B0014CSNDY,"I really wanted to try a DVD focused on flow yoga and shiva rea seemed to be the master. While I am not a beginner I was unfamiliar with this style of yoga. I also recently developed some lower back problems and unfortunately a lot of my other yoga DVDs would irritate it. This is the only yoga DVD thus far that has actually HELPED my back instead of strain it. While it was a little slow for me, it is a beginners DVD and that's what my back needed. Great instructions with different variations and a good yoga DVD for beginners and beyond. Can't wait to try out some of her more challenging DVDs!",1407715200,,599,4.217391304347826
3129358,3,B0014CSNDY,"I did not think this dvd was suited for beginners, I had a very hard time doing some of the moves, even the alternative ""easier"" ones. If you're already flexible, it may be beginner status for you. For me, it was difficult and the yoga class at my gym far outshines this dvd as far as beginner readiness.

Nice backgrounds though.",1407542400,,330,4.409836065573771
3129359,5,B0014CSNDY,Great for beginners! I love this style of yoga. She gives a lot of options for different levels as well.,1403568000,,104,4.25
3129360,5,B0014CSNDY,"This video was given to me by a friend.  I have a number of Shiva Rea's DVDs and have practiced with her live so I am familiar with how challenging and utterly creative she can be.  I have to say I am very surprised at how good this is for a DVD marketed for beginners.  I think it is a wonderful foundation practice for beginners, but for also experienced yogis as well.  I have done this three times and it is really really good and sooo relaxing.  There is a saying in yoga that each pose is endless, and often times I get in robot mode, but this DVD really is done with such great intention at slowing things down and remembering the nuances and lines of energy of each pose. I don't want to describe the sequences because I think this will take away from the experience of the DVD.  This is not your typical sequenced DVD ""ok now we are going into downward facing dog"" it really has a flow and intelligence to it.  The setting in Hawaii is of course stunning and her voice is very soothing.  I think this is a great DVD for both beginners at advanced practitioners.",1402272000,,1070,4.236453201970443
3129361,5,B0014CSNDY,"Clear instructions and the teacher's movements are easy to follow.

Listen, learn, and be open to the vast experience Shiva Rae brings to us in her unique and inspiring style.",1396137600,,394,4.764705882352941

3129364,5,B0014CSNDY,"Absolutely the best yoga teach that has ever existed. I might be biased, because I've taken classes with her, but I think her style is the best.",1393200000,,144,4.37037037037037
3129365,5,B0014CSNDY,Great for beginners and beyond.  I enjoy the subtle peacefulness of Shiva Rea and her presentation.  This is my 2nd copy of this DVD since passing the first to family.,1391558400,,167,4.533333333333333
3129366,5,B0014CSNDY,"I wait a while to write reviews in order to make them accurate.
Shiva does a great job explaining thoroughly what each position means and how to exactly place your body. I was a NON yoga person until I gave this a shot. She is great and I feel so much stronger I do this dvd about 3 times a week on my ""easy"" exercise nights. This isn't easy by any means but its great for beginning she gives you other options if one position isn't working for you as a beginner. I really am more flexible after having this product and using it for a few weeks now.
Hope this helps you and I encourage your body to try this for mental rest and calming of the body!

3129368,2,B0014CSNDY,I wanted to love this because I like Shiva Rea's videos. I think she needs to fire her producers because they were clearly 'beginners'. I love the arrangement of 10 min foundation and 4 20 mins sessions so you can mix and match what you want to do. The most annoying part though is this weird tantric music that makes it seem like you are in some horror movie. The worst part? There is no way to turn it off. As a result I don't use it as much as I wanted to. One can mute the sound but then you can't follow her instructions. lost opportunity.,1389744000,,544,4.093457943925234
3129369,4,B0014CSNDY,"Easy to follow, good yoga practice. The flow makes sense, She works your core and uses yoga form, not a makeshift style.",1389571200,,120,4.5

3129372,5,B0014CSNDY,Her instructions are easy to follow and not at all intimidating for beginners.  She never makes you feel self conscious because you can't do what she is doing - yet.,1386374400,,165,4.5

3129375,5,B0014CSNDY,"I read the other reviews that said they didn't like this video because it was more like a movie than an instructional video.

This is amazing and I love listing to Shiva Rea.  I have always been a walker, and unable to reach my toes, now I can. I am amazed in such a short time how good I feel.

3129377,5,B0014CSNDY,It says it's for beginners but I think beginners might have a need to be experienced in other styles of yoga first. I really do enjoy this video and was very happy to get it.,1382140800,,174,4.0
3129378,5,B0014CSNDY,"I'm brand new to yoga and been looking to yoga as a way to relax and become more flexible. I have some flexibility and this provided just the right amount of time between poses, explanation, and challenge for me. This always makes me feel better when I complete the sections.

3129379,5,B0014CSNDY,"I love this video and she is very specific about breathing and noticing your breath throughout the video.  I would say it's more of an intermediate video, not straight beginner, but Shiva gives plenty of modifications for beginners.

3129381,1,B0014CSNDY,"I know that Shiva Rea is considered one of the top teachers of yoga, but I found her to be way too melodramatic for my taste. I found her cueing to be rather poor at points and the set was just a bit over the top for me (flowers, candles, corny music). I prefer a more minimalist approach to yoga instruction, so this was not my cup of tea.  YJ for Strength and Toning is way better.",1379548800,8,383,3.9740259740259742
3129382,4,B0014CSNDY,I love it. The only thing is you have to really want to do the yoga because it's a challenge. I wouldn't rate it for beginners.,1377907200,,127,3.923076923076923
3129383,4,B0014CSNDY,"I like the segments so I could do as much as I wanted.  She keeps the flow moving.  It is a good DVD for an ""old"" beginner like myself.",1377820800,,135,3.6206896551724137
3129384,2,B0014CSNDY,"I have several of Shiva Rea's videos and bought this one for what I thought would be a relaxing workout when I want to unwind without working too hard. The huge dealbreaker for me is that of the four sections the standing flow poses are last.  Right after a section of more relaxing poses that should prepare you for the Savasana. This is the most difficult section so why in the world would it be placed after you're already relaxed and feeling all ooey goody yoga good?  That is not flow.  It's a jolt to the system!

There are too many other yoga dvds in my collection that don't have this problem so I will not be using this much if ever.  It's actually a shame because if not for this issue it would have been an excellent dvd.  One that challenges beginners both new to yoga and exercise in general yet offers the more advanced a nice relaxing change of pace.  Sadly the order of the sequences really ruins it for me and stopping to fiddle with a dvd remote mid session is not something I should have to do.",1377648000,3,1013,4.272251308900524
3129385,4,B0014CSNDY,"I used to go to yoga classes 2-3 x's/week but then life happened and my practice was the first to go. Now that things are settling down again, I'm ready to get back on this horse, but unfortunately I've lost some of the strength and flexibility tat comes with regular practice. So, while I am attending classes locally, they don't always fit with my schedule and as a result I decided to order some new yoga DVDs to round things out.

This is a good DVD, not too challenging, easy to follow, excellent form to follow. While I prefer a bit more of a challenge I think I can integrate parts of this into my training, perhaps even as light strength & flexibility training on cardio days.

The instructor is easy to follow, has a pleasant voice, and does a good job of cueing moves and transitions. I would suggest this for beginners and those of us who are returning & need to build back up to full practice.",1374969600,,905,4.349112426035503

3129387,5,B0014CSNDY,"Shiva Rea is my favorite yoga instructor.  I enjoy the flow yoga that she does as there is constant movement.  So many other yoga styles are too close to isometrics for me.  If I've had a stressful week-end or feeling really tight, I go back to this video for my morning stretch, even though I have been doing yoga for years.  I bought this DVD for my daughter who is just beginning yoga - mainly for relaxation.

However, it has been a while and I've lost a lot of muscle tone and this is great to give me a chance to build back up. There are plenty of breaks and she seems to grasp how difficult it is to start a new workout routine.  I felt her expectations of my ability to keep up were pretty accurate.  I am happy that she thoroughly explains each pose -- great refresher for things I have forgotten.  If you are a true beginner (never tried yoga before) start with a basic approach to yoga and when you get at least a general idea, progress to this one.

I also enjoyed that it was broken into 3 segments.  I was a bit tired after the second one, took a little break and then finished the third section.",1368835200,,763,4.087248322147651

3129393,5,B0014CSNDY,Shiva Rea's yoga style is so fluid and graceful that it looks like dance. This beginners video has a easy to follow segments that can be done separately or combined. It's pretty easy to follow just be mindful of breath which might take a little time to master. I'm returning to yoga practice as my intention is to become a certified yoga instructor.

It's horrible, very blurry & pixelated, the voice and mouth are completely off, it's like a BAD Kung Fu movie or Japanese monster movie except the visual on those is better!!  I should have just bought the DVD instead, but I wanted to use it now.  It also said I could download it, but after purchase I found out it doesn't offer a download only ""Watch Now""  I purchase from Amazon quite frequently, and have been very happy with my purchases, but this is really sub par Amazon, I'm extremely disappointed!!

I have followed this DVD for several sessions and have not been let down.  It is basic, beginner level at a slow pace and well instructed. Vinyasa can be difficult for a beginner, but this DVD is a very good sample of what a beginner Vinyasa class would be like. I follow at my pace with my limited ability (due to injury) and find that I get a very well rounded practice.

My initial thought was: This is for beginners?...I could easily follow along, but I think that could be because I'm not really a ""beginner"". I'm just haven't done yoga in a while. It seemed like it was harder than it should be. But then again, it might just be because I'm out of shape.

Overall I do like the video a lot.  I would have given it 5 stars just as a yoga video, but gave it 4 because I thought it was a little bit challenging for a beginner.",1361059200,,627,3.9682539682539684

I made the mistake of assuming that a DVD with ""for beginners"" would target people like me.  Instead, it apparently targets people who are familiar with most of the yoga poses and know how to do them properly...but are beginners to ""flow"" yoga.  I guess ""Flow Yoga"" is a particular kind of yoga...I'm beginner enough that I don't know there are different kinds

I tried yoga 2 years ago as part of P90X, but at that time I wasn't really interested in doing yoga.  I assumed that there would be better dvd's out there that made yoga 100% of their focus.  I think I'll try and dig up a copy of the yoga disc that came with it as that was very detailed in comparison to ""Flow Yoga for Beginners"".  Or maybe I'll buy ""Yoga for Dummies"" and work my way up to this one.

I'm keeping this disc and the other one by Shiva Rea that I bought (based on the glowing recommendations)as they seem like they'd be good once I had a clue what I was doing.  If I get to that point I'll adjust this rating to properly reflect my opinion at that point.

I knew from tv that if this was titled 'beginner', it would be a little more challenging than others.  If you can't find her on tv, buy the dvd and watch it a few times before you try it.

You have to be a 'committed' beginner in order to get the most out of this dvd.  If you're afraid to try, or easily put off, this may not be the one for you.  Be patient with yourself if you're a true beginner.  Do a little each time and you'll see how fast you catch on and you'll see yourself improve.

I found this video to be wonderful for beginners as Shiva Rea's demonstrations give us a perfect example of how these poses can be accomplished.  She frequently advises and cautions us to be aware of what our bodies are telling us, that in time that perfect posture will be attained. That gentle guidance prevents discouragement.

Her encouraging words of ""be patient"" and to let the body attain the pose naturally, allows us to accept the fact that each of us has our own abilities, and the purpose of this practice is to enjoy the ""flow"" of yoga, not just perfect posturing, as I had originally understood it.

I find her guiding words for visually grounding and centering the flow very helpful for me as a beginner and would recommend this highly for anyone who shares
an understanding of beginning yoga practice. I believe that in time its benefits will reward greatly.",1324512000,3,974,4.81437125748503

Like that DVD,  Shiva Rea's Flow Yoga for Beginners has beautiful scenery. The flow yoga in this program is broken into smaller segments, which is appropriate for beginners. As always, it is helpful to watch the program before trying it, particularly because some of the vocal instructions are overwhelmed by the music.

Just remember that if you feel overwhelmed, you should take a step back and watch what is happening on the screen. The idea with yoga is to build your strength and flexibility gradually, not to push yourself beyond your limits. If you practice consistently, you will find that each time, you will be able to stretch farther or hold the position for a longer period of time.",1303257600,3,906,5.605839416058394
3129419,3,B0014CSNDY,"Let's just start by saying any person hoping to buy this had better be a very good mimic, or else they should try a few yoga classes to get a feel for some of the asanas. Also, Shiva has a funny way of confusing her inhale/exhale commands. Like during the flexibility flow, (when stretching the leg while holding the calf with the hands) she commands an exhale a few times in a row. Just a mix-up, but seeing as how this is a voice-over and not live-action, it could have been easily corrected in the editing process.
-The standing pose flow was shot at sunset, and as others have said, it's very dark and sometimes hard to see what she's doing.
-Shavasana is very, very short. I feel like I'm just about to really relax, and then that drumming for the credits interrupts the quiet music.
-Shiva really knows her stuff, and it's easy to see. She has a great way of leading a flow and providing modifications, stresses knowing one's own boundaries, etc.

I've taken yoga classes before, and now I'm in the process of becoming a serious student, practicing most days out of the week.  I am 5'8, 120 lbs, exercise regularly, in my 20s...I'm not some huge weakling.  But I feel like these poses were very advanced, and I needed more guidance and explanation than was offered.

3129421,4,B0014CSNDY,"I like this DVD. Before doing this workout, I had only a small amount of yoga experience and I found this DVD to be very helpful. I would definitely say that it is for beginners. Many of the poses that she does are modified to accommodate the beginner and are meant to open up the back and hips and to stretch out tight muscles and limbs. I have been doing it for a few weeks and am now ready for something more challenging. Only two of the four segments raise my heart rate, but just a little at that. But I have felt my body slowly becoming more and more stretched out and stronger. Also, she is very supportive of starting out slow with small movements and very slowly moving towards flexibility. I felt like it was a really good program to start with, because again, many of the exercises are meant to simply get the body opened up and stretched out so that you can do more advanced poses later. Overall, a good introduction to yoga for a beginner. If you are looking to simply become more flexible in order to move on to something more challenging later, I suggest starting with this DVD.",1297641600,,1093,4.336585365853659
3129422,3,B0014CSNDY,"Why I enjoy this video:
My favorite yoga class was taught by a student of Shiva Rea, but I moved away and haven't found a replacement class yet.  This video met my expectations well -- fitting breath with movement, fitting both with music, etc.

I was in 2 car accidents in the last 14 months, and while rehabbing I fell completely out of the habit of practicing yoga.  This is a gentle re-introduction.

Why I would not recommend this to others:
My #1 pet peeve is that Shiva Rea skips the half split on the right side in one of the sequences.  Every single time I do this video I have to pause it and add the half split in.  It drives me crazy!!!

As others have mentioned, this video does not contain much in the way of explanations.  If you're new, I suggest you either go to a class in person, or, if that's impossible, get one of Barbara Benagh's videos -- they're much more clear.",1296864000,,887,4.269461077844311
3129423,2,B0014CSNDY,"I bought this DVD back in Jan 2009. I just recently got it out again and tried it. Now I know why it sat unused for a year and a half. It KILLS my knees during lunge poses.

I also find it very advanced for being a beginner's DVD. She holds poses for a long period of time, which I am unable to do. Yet! Granted, I hope to work up to that strength with repeated use, but considering it states it's for beginners, I would think there would be more consideration for the length of time poses are held in that regard.

Another point is that I found myself having to repeatedly look at the TV since she uses Sanskrit terms for poses. What's that you say, Shiva? I'm a beginner, remember? I have no problem learning the correct terms, but at least give me some instruction first. So there was a lot of stopping and starting of the video and of my poses. I actually just stopped altogether and just watched the whole program without doing any of it so I could at least familiarize myself first. However, that will take a number of viewings and not ""doings"" to get comfortable doing her routines without having to stop and look at her.

Her pace is slow, which is good, but with the unfamiliar terms, having to stop and start again, and the time held holding some of the poses (that require a lot of strength), I cannot recommend it for beginners. And I am not completely a beginner. I have done some yoga for a little bit over the years, but not regularly because I just can't seem to find the one that fits me best.....recommendations are welcome. :)",1288310400,8,1545,4.302405498281787

I especially LOVE the modified warrior 1 posture - I really felt a change in my hips after the first time.  I love the way Sheava Rea teaches, very in the moment and in-tune with the body.  The DVD helps me learn how to breath and integrate.  Even at this basic level, I am noticing better posture, breathig and body awareness.

I have heard so much about Shiva Rea, but this DVD was much to fast and complicated for me. She went from move to move without even explaining what she was doing & how she did it. It was almost like she was physically saying ""You know these poses, so now do them"". I was also expecting her to slowly move into the more difficult poses,but NO..she didnt.
I ultimately had to quit on her.

3129427,3,B0014CSNDY,"I consider myself a beginner and this was my first Shiva Rea DVD. Even as a beginner, I found that the routine was too slow. I was looking for a routine that moved more quickly from one pose to another. I skipped the first warm up section completely (which is very long for a warm up) since it was mostly breathing. The following sections I'd classify more as slow stretching routines for flexibility. The Standing Poses routine is the only one I kind of enjoyed. The rest I found rather boring. On a positive note the cinematography is slick, scenery is beautiful and new-agey music is enjoyable. It has not turned me off Shiva Rea at all, I just wish I'd started with a different DVD.

I also have Eoin Finn's Pure and Simple Yoga and actually ended up liking this video a lot more for the routine alone. It throws you right into flowing, challenging sequences and could easily double as an instructor-led class. Shiva Rea's DVD is lot more feminine and stylized than Eoin's but the workout factor in his DVD was higher.

I plan on trying Eoin's Power Yoga for Happiness 2 Surf Edition at the same time as Shiva Rea's Daily Energy Flow. We'll see which I enjoy more out of those two.",1275264000,,1185,4.456221198156682

I am so excited, I will have it in my DVD player for tomorrow!!",1262995200,2,379,3.691358024691358
3129434,5,B0014CSNDY,"I am not a big yoga fan. In fact, most yoga DVDs bore me.  But something about Shiva in the video clips always intrigued me.  She is really an awesome instructor. I wish I had paid less attention to the reviewers that said this DVD was not for beginners, as I wasted time and money on some really boring beginner DVDs.

I look at yoga as a way to enhance the other fitness activities I already do.  I completed the first three flows today after doing the elliptical trainer and strength exercises, in replacement of my regular stretching & flexibility routine.  I would not normally complete 45 minutes of yoga in one sitting, so I do appreciate that each of these flows can be performed individually.

I have hip dysplasia on my right side, a bad knee (left side), and a posterior innominate rotation on my left (this means when my back rotates my right leg becomes shorter than my left). Thanks to physical therapy and a focus on core strength & flexibility the rotation is now mostly stable. I continue to work through the other issues.  While I may comment on these limitations in my review, I would not deduct points in my rating because this DVD does not claim to be therapeutic for any of these.  I simply include the notes in case they are of help to someone else who may have some similar limitations.

These are the flows I completed today:
1) Foundation flow:  This was a very relaxing and simple flow, starting with breathing and going through some basic flexibility poses. The breathing would be something that if presented wrong would really bore me, but Shiva did a great job.
2) Beginner's Backbend Flow:  I had completed part of this flow as a bonus on another DVD and it convinced me to order this DVD. This is such a relaxing flow. I can see completing this flow many times in the future.  With hip dysplasia on one side and a bad knee on the other, I find balance when doing lunges on one side is not as good as it should be.  At times I did place one hand on a table for balance.  I look forward to my balance improving as I repeat this flow.  Also, I did not squat down as low as Shiva did when doing the chair pose with twist, but found my own variation.  The only pose I did not perform was the bow pose (for fear of pulling on my knee), so I did cobra instead. With some slight modifications, I feel this flow can be adjusted for beginners, and Shiva also mentions some modifications during the flow.
3) Relaxing Flexibility Flow: Coming from a non-yoga background, I recognize variations on standard priformis and hamstring stretches.  (I do use a stretch strap for the hamstring stretches.)  This is followed by a great hip/inner thigh stretch that was new for me, and then a sitting forward bend. This flow is very relaxing and I think most people would be able to complete it.

I agree with other reviewers that it would have been nice to have a matrix as the fourth flow appears to be quite different than the other ones, and the shivasana is at the end.

I have not yet tried the Beginner's Standing Pose Flow, and will likely update my review once I have.  I think this is the most challenging flow on the DVD, and gives me something to work into. I have also ordered Shiva's newest DVD (Daily Energy - Vinyasa Flow Yoga) and can't wait to receive it.

UPDATE:  I've used the first three flows many times times now and love them.  I've already worked past the minor limitations I mentioned from the backbending flow.  I can see using these flows, in particular the backbending flow over and over again.

I finally did get to the standing flow today.  I did flows in this order: Standing, Backbend, Flexibility.  I felt so relaxed when I was done. These are nice, gentle, soothing flows for me.  This DVD continues to be a favorite that I expect I will use over and over again.

It's interesting as I look back at the review because yoga has now become a regular part of my routine - this DVD was the starting point for that.",1262390400,8,3956,4.409090909090909
3129435,5,B0014CSNDY,"I started my yoga journey with Kundalini, and then this DVD was recommended to me. WOW! This DVD moves quickly, but you do each set multiple times (as is standard in vinyasa flow). My entire body was sore after this workout. In fact, the first time I did this DVD I absolutely had to take breaks because my arms, legs, and core were shaking. Mind you, I am an avid long-distance runner and am in pretty good shape. From that moment on I was hooked. It's fairly tradition, but the instructions Shiva Rea gives are so amazing. She explains moves in a manner that allow me to open up to them in entirely new ways. The background on this entire video is all filmed on location and it is just breath-taking. I have watched this DVD just to relax after work before, not even doing the yoga set itself. Highly recommended, whether a beginner or an advanced student!",1254960000,2,858,4.436708860759493
3129436,5,B0014CSNDY,"I was overwhelmed as a beginner so I can understand the complaints some other reviewers have with this DVD.  However I would like to add that vinyasa, or flow yoga, is a quite challenging form of yoga, not usually recommended for beginners.  I think that Shiva Rea does very well in introducing this form of yoga to those unfamiliar with it.  I really love the DVD, music and presentation, so I went back to it after using the Giam beginner yoga DVDs for a few weeks.  At that point it was not completely unreasonable to attempt the flows in this program- especially with all the variations she introduces to make it less physically challenging.  I have favorite moments in the program and find it very easy to navigate to them because the DVD is broken down into 5 sections.  I have Rhumatoid Arthritis and yoga practice has helped me with my pain, but some days are better than others, on bad days I just do one flow.  I like that this DVD gives you the option to do that.  I would recommend this to a beginner as long as you try this as maybe your second DVD, and the real ""beginner"" ones get old fast.",1247702400,4,1105,4.35609756097561
3129437,5,B0014CSNDY,"Shiva Rea defines flow as, ""a natural state of yoga that we've known since birth  from artists to athletes the state of flow is defined as the ability to move freely in an unbroken stream of awareness uniting your mind, body, breath with your creative intelligence.""  Moving freely in yoga is not something that beginners really can do, but this is still a worthwhile DVD for people starting out in yoga who are in resonable shape and serious about doing more.

It looks glorious on my big screen TV, images of Hawaii with just the instructor working out (no big class in the background).  It is a peacful relaxing vive.  But while you can select music-only or music-and-voice there is no voice only selection for beginners who may have problems hearing all the instructions. However this is a small quibble.  If you are looking for a restful yoga DVD taught by someone who really knows what they are doing, Shiva Rea's flow yoga is a great DVD",1243036800,2,944,4.622754491017964

I'm also surprised at how short this dvd is compared to other Shiva Rea dvds.",1239235200,2,259,4.2
3129439,4,B0014CSNDY,"I've done yoga off and on for about 8 years now.  I enjoy this DVD.  My only complaint is that it is broken up into individual segments, so it only ""flows"" sporadically, but I suppose that is appropriate since this is for beginners.  Flow yoga is physically challenging (that's why I got this ""beginner"" DVD), so the breaks between each flow are nice for those who may not be able to make it through the whole routine.  Shiva Rea is an amazingly youthful and energetic instructor, and I find her style very easy to follow and motivating.  I will likely purchase another DVD of hers in the future.",1238803200,2,596,4.481481481481482

3129441,5,B0014CSNDY,"Just received my order! :) This afternoon I had my 1st 70min workout with this DVD. I have to say that this is really great! I've done yoga on and off for about 1yr with YogaZone's DVD ""Gentle Yoga"" - it includes two basic, well explained workouts that really prepared me for Shiva Rea. Compared to ""Gentle Yoga"", this DVD's workouts actually increased my heart rate for quite a bit! Though I'm not very athletic, I know most of the poses already, so I was able to follow all her instructions. But I agree with some of the reviews here - there are poses that require a bit of familiarity and endurance, so they may be a bit too advanced for absolute beginners.
But then again... Shiva is a great instructor. Her voice is very calming yet lifting. The workouts are professionally filmed with beautiful sceneries, and the background drumming music is subtle yet energetic.
Though some reviewers commented rather negatively on some of Shiva's ambiguous instructions such as ""temple of heart"", ""open heart"", ""root your feet"" etc., I found them to be interesting and at times helpful. Those are abstract, conceptual ideas that are not meant to be scrutinized and taken literally. When the music starts, I get into the mindset and know what to do with my body, everything falls into the right places, and I'd be good to go.
The workouts could be a bit more varied though. In the third section Shiva introduces a routine that combines Chataronga, Cobra with Warrior Poses (etc...). I'm pretty sure that she means to go through it a couple of times so the routine becomes familiar and begins to flow. But still it's a tiny bit too much repetition for me.
However I did bought Yoga Shakti, Shiva's highest ranked DVD with 3.5 hrs of routines... So i've got nothing to complain :)",1224028800,2,1770,4.65814696485623
3129442,3,B0014CSNDY,"'No yoga experience necessary' proclaims the box.  'Score!' I think.  'I know squat about yoga, so this should be perfect!'

What they don't mention is that this isn't necessarily for people not already rather fit.  Each segment requires a certain level of endurance and strength that many rank beginners just don't have.  She does make some modifications, but the moves remain difficult, sometimes prohibitively so.  Also, despite the proclamation on the box, it seems as though some foreknowledge of yoga is in fact necessary.  Some moves are cued by name rather than by description, which makes the first few viewings difficult to follow.

Overall, I can't really say that I recommend this to beginners in general.  Fit beginners, maybe.  Advanced beginners in yoga, sure.  Not so much everyone else.  I wish I could like this DVD, as the scenery is lovely and Ms. Rea obviously knows her stuff, but I just can't get far enough into it to make it worth my while.",1223942400,18,965,4.852760736196319
3129443,5,B0014CSNDY,"I figured this would be a good DVD to start with before I immersed myself into Yoga Shakti. I'm glad I did! I think this is not only a nice introduction to Flow Yoga, but to the instructor herself. I had heard many great reviews about Shiva Rea so I couldn't wait to get my first DVD from her.

First of all, she does an excellent job in breaking down the various poses little by little so you are not overwhelmed. Also, I really appreciated the fact that she introduced gentle variations throughout so you could work up to the more complex poses. The voice over and cuing for the most part are very good and the scenery is gorgeous.

I'll agree with other reviewers in saying that the Savasana at the end is very brief, but other than that, this DVD is a great intro to her style and technique. For the anyone else who may consider purchasing this DVD, getting a book that references the English and Sanskrit names for the poses may be helpful as well.

I hope to buy more of her DVD's soon after I've done this routine for awhile.",1220400000,,1032,4.282051282051282
3129444,4,B0014CSNDY,"Flow yoga is a bit different from the style I usally practice (Bikram), but I found it enjoyable and challenging.

Shiva Rea is a good instructor and it was very enjoyable to watch her fit physique perform these yoga flows in the lush Hawaiian scenery accompanied by pleasant if a bit repetititve music.  Actually performing the flows  myself was a bit more difficult.  I would label this DVD as intermediate rather than beginner.  Poses are not explained and things move along at a decent clip.  If you don't know the poses by name already, then you will be a bit lost, at least until the 4th or 5th viewing.  Also, some of the moves require poses that take your eyes off the screen and it is easy to fall behind at these times.  I would have liked the DVD to close with a more relaxing flow, but that is a minor quibble as you can watch it in a different order if you wish.

The production values are top notch like a movie. Camera, editing, lighting, sound, set design is all gorgeous... you can see that in the videos. All instruction from her is given in voice over. She gives great information both in a spiritual manner & which specific anatomy muscles you are using as well as which are being stretched & how it benefits the body as a whole physically.
Foundation Flow:  14 min
By a waterfall, Deep breathing/Prana & moving hands w/the breath. Table/cat with 1 need to nose & repeated several times. Practicing plank & chaturanga (low staff/plank pose), child's pose, mild push ups while on  knees to build upper body strength & practice getting into chaturanga, cobra, 1 leg up locust with arms down, going between table & downward dog several times, full downward dog & ends w/child's.
Beginner's Back bend Flow: 21 min
See Video Below to see backdrop of her by a lily pond. Light side stretches w/outstretched hand like dvd cover. Standing fwd bends mild & then held a long time, mountain pose w/mild back bend/stretch a couple of times. Low lunge w/back knee on the floor. She calls half splits but also  similar to pyramid but lower. Mild chaturanga, cobra, locust w/just the arms up, child's, table w/knee to nose, other side lunge again w/o pyramid, standing fwd bend, mountain, simple standing side bend stretch,  mountain w/mild back bend, chair pose, chair w/prayer twist (she explains how to get more twist using the lower hand to push the top one up) (this is held for a very long time so it will be challenging to leg muscles) standing fwd bend, chair twist to the other side, standing fwd bend, lunge w/prayer twist (also held a long time), pyramid, downward dog on the knees which is much easier to do & opens up the shoulders as well),  lung w/prayer twist on other side, pyramid, bow, lay on stomach/rest, mild camel, hero's pose (she doesn't say it's name, it is very hard to do unless flexible & VERY bad on the knees if you have any issues, she only does it & says just sits back & stays sit cross legged if you have issues), sit & breathe deeply w/hands. Laying on back, both knees to chest, then both knees to one side then the other, then one knee to chest only, then other, then lay back to rest. This is very challenging for beginners as she holds the poses for much longer then most instructors & longer in one pose can really tax muscles.
Relaxing Flexibility Flow: 10 min
Same lily pond. Laying on back, one knee to chest only, then other, then one ankle crossed on one knee & pulled to the chest (held for over a minute), one knee bent & the other leg straight pulled toward the head. Repeat on other side, ankle crossed on knee (only held 45 seconds), leg to head. Both knees to chest, happy baby pose (on back with bent knees each knee to respective shoulder) & then slightly turn hips back/forth (very mild) & ends in butterfly. This is very mild & very relaxing, this is not a workout as more as light stretching. I found it too slow a pace & not enough poses for this length of time. This style is more yin yoga where poses are held a long time.
Beginner's Standing Pose Flow: 22 min
Beach scene you see on trailer. Table, child's, table, downward dog, 3 legged down dog w/one straight leg in sky, high lunge (back leg up), slow chaturanga on knees, mild cobra, child's, table, downward dog. Other side 3 legged down dog, high lunge (back leg up), faster chaturanga on knees, cobra, child's, downward dog. 3 legged down dog, mild warrior 2 (w/back leg resting on knee, not foot like full), mild side angle (same leg placement as previous pose & arm resting on knee only which is easier), chaturanga, mild locust w/arms & 1 leg,  child's, down dog. Same thing on the other side. 3 legged down dog, full warrior 2 (she does pelvic tilt here to teach you to pull hips toward the belly butt to lengthen the spine), reverse/revolved warrior, side angle (arm on knee still), warrior 2, pyramid (back knee on ground),chaturanga, half bow, child's, down dog. At faster speed, warrior 2, revolved warrior, side angle (hand on knee),  warrior 2, pyramid, chaturanga, full bow, child's & down dog.  Repeat again w/cobra instead of bow 4 more times. Rest in child's for a full minute. I did not like how this harder standing poses comes after relaxing laying back poses, it makes no sense after heating up with the back bend flow & cooling off with the flexibility flow.
Shavasana: 2 min
Laying down & her guiding you to relax 1/2 of it & silence the rest.

Shiva Rea is very advanced yogini & I believe this is her first beginner DVD. She seems to be new at teaching beginners & is very tough almsot like the drill sargent of yoga. She has a lovely voice but there is a stiffness to it. I did not like how it flowed, nor something about her teaching. I found all her other yoga DVDs too advanced for me though I'd been practicing semi-regularly for over 6 years. I've had no problem & LOVE Rodney Yee, Rainbeau Mars, Sean Corn, Ateeka, Yoga for Sex (excuse the title, but it's normal yoga in fun format), The Firm's Power Yoga,  I also LIKE Susan Deason, Max Strom, Kristen Mcgee, Kabbalah Yoga, Yoga Radiance & a couple of others.

3129447,4,B0014CSNDY,"I give this video four stars instead of five, only because the yoga was a little less intense than what I prefer (i.e. power yoga).  Otherwise, it's a great video.

The scenery is stunning - definitely the best looking exercise video I've ever seen.  Backgrounds include a waterfall, a jungle, and a beach at sunset.  The sound track was also very good.

The yoga itself is low-intensity, beginning very slowly and working up to slightly more difficult poses, but nothing a beginner can't handle.  No crazy pretzel poses or transitions into handstands or anything like that.  I do think it would be a pretty good low-intensity workout if you did the whole thing - for me, it moved a little slowly though, and like most yoga videos it's a long, long workout from start to finish.  I just ran out of patience, but I don't blame the video for that.

It was also a very graceful kind of yoga, at times looking like a slow dance.

I think this is a great video for anyone looking for a low-intensity, low-impact, calming yoga workout with really nice visual and sound.  Also a good video for beginners.",1216857600,,1097,4.574358974358974

I believe what the Yoga session here is for someone who has not advanced into this style, or more like the style of Shiva Rea, who has several different yoga style DVDs.

This DVD instruction is set up in segments, which indicate to the beginner that you can be selective on what you might want to focus on.  It is a lengthy program, over 70 minutes, much to much for a beginner.  What the beginner can do is  workout to a chapter segment at a time.  The poses move fast and you must be very flexible already!

What is beautiful is the setting and the soft unobtrusive music.  An expert would be safe without the instruction.  If you choose to listen to the music while instruction, keep in mind that instruction moves quickly also.  Language may be unfamiliar to a beginner.  And, what I also like is that the poses are doable, without any extremely difficult poses, but again, you must be somewhat flexible.  And, be flexible enough to poke your head various challenging ways, to SEE the instruction.

The teacher, Shiva Rea, is calming and also very intelligent and has a great ability to explain what we are doing succinctly as she guides us further and further into holistically styled workouts. This style of yoga is called ""flow yoga"". Indeed you do flow from one movement to the next, and your mind flows meditatively as well from one peaceful calming thought to the next while Shiva leads the way.

Of course a person cannot expect to climb a mountain in one day if one has never done any sort of movement for a while...but for beginner yoga, if you are the kind of person who likes to work out at home, quietly and thoughfully, sensing the movements of your body as this fine teacher, Shiva Rea, explains them, this is the DVD for you.

Maybe her idea of ""beginner"" is different from mine but I came at this program having no idea what even the basics are.  I was actually hoping for something that would really truly be for beginners and would slowly explain the moves rather than go quickly from one position to another.

Having said that I do find that the program is getting easier as I stick with it so if you are not easily scared off then this may not be a bad choice.  I guess I'd suggest that you not be afraid to hit pause over and over as you try to get each position right.

The settings of waterfalls and a grassy knoll are visually calming and the sounds of nature will help you to bliss out.

I receommend before purchasing any yoga DVD, know what type of yoga you are interested in, educate yourself so you won't be disappointed or overwhelmed. Vinyasa Flow is not your basic yoga stretching. It is creative movement and yes, you are constantly moving it seems, it is considered part of the Astanga family.

I was a bit hesitant to get this DVD since I could never get into her popular Yoga Shakti Complete Practice workout.  One of my biggest pet peeves with that one was the lack of time listings for the workout segments.  I like knowing how long a DVD workout is going to run so I can make an informed purchase and subsequently manage my workout time.  Unfortunately, this program also lacks segment durations on the packaging.  Yes, the back of the box states there is approximately 70 minutes on the DVD.  But there are five routines with unknown and differing durations.  Therefore, I had to go in blind and hope that the routines were a suitable length.  Thankfully they are.  But I shouldn't have to take such a leap of faith.  What's so hard about adding an individual workout routine time stamp to the packaging for buyer convenience?  I even checked Shiva Rea's self-named website hoping to get time info, but no such luck.  I went ahead and used the counter in my PC's DVD software to estimate the routine lengths:

1. Foundation Flow.  Set by a waterfall.  Poses include Downward Dog (with interesting variations) and Wisdom Pose.  About 14 minutes.
2. Beginner's Backbend Flow. Set next to a lily pond, on a small lawn with a pad surrounded by pots with burning wicks.  Lots of standing back work.  About 20 minutes.
3. Relaxing Flexibility Flow.  Setting is the same as #2.  Lots of leg stretches done while lying on the back.  Nice hip opener towards the end.  About 10 minutes.
4. Beginner's Standing Pose Flow. Set on the beach during sunset.  Includes Downward Dog w/leg raises and Half Warrior 2 pose.  About 20 minutes.
5. Shavasana. Set on the beach close to the end of sunset.  A quick relaxation routine done while lying on one's back.  About 2 minutes.

I worked my way through routines 2-4 and found them to be a good supplement to my cardio workout (I watched routines 1 and 5 while timing the routines on my PC).  Overall, I enjoyed the practices.  For example, I was impressed at how my body opened up and felt stronger just when she said it would during the Beginner's Standing Pose Flow routine.  In addition, I liked the pose variations that Ms. Rea demonstrated, such as the hip opener in routine #3 and the Half Warrior Two in routine #4.  As for Ms. Rea, she's a good teacher and yoga role model.  Her voice and physicality are perfectly suited to yoga: restful and serene, yet powerful and confident.  The background music added to the soothing ambiance and helped me relax.  Finally, the workout scenery is peaceful and beautiful - especially the beach at sunset.

However, along with the lack of time listings, I had some issues with the routines.  First, I'm not sure if this is really the best workout for a yoga newbie, especially an older person or someone with physical issues.  Ms. Rea leads this workout in voice-over, and sometimes things don't sync as well as they would have if she was calling in real time.  In addition, despite my decent level of fitness and yoga experience, my efforts to keep pace caused some problems with an old injury.  Ten years ago I had an ACL recon on my left knee using tissue from my hamstring.  Even after warming up, the Lunge in routine #2 tweaked my kneecap, and Half Warrior Two in routine #4 cramped my hamstring.  I'm hoping that these issues are aberrations, especially since I don't normally have that issue in Lunge pose.  Finally, even though I liked the beach scenery in routine #4, the filming took place too close to nightfall.  In some angles Ms. Rea's dark pants blended in with the sand so that it was hard to see her leg position.

Thankfully, these issues aren't showstoppers.  As Ms. Rea recommends, watching the DVD before diving in will familiarize you with the workout's intricacies, and a large-screen newer model TV will help with the video (I used a 13"" CRT TV with integrated DVD player).  I consider ""Shiva Rea - Flow Yoga For Beginners"" to be a good addition to my yoga workout routine.  It would be a fine introduction to Shiva Rea for young and daring yoga neophytes, but older yoga newbies and those with health issues should be careful and take time getting used to this workout.  Recommended - and I might even give ""Yoga Shakti"" another try...",1210982400,4,4814,4.635502958579882
3129462,4,B0014CSNDY,"I am more of a Yoga fan then I am an active practitioner. My fitness room is nearing completion, complete with a DVD playing PC that I can pump into the ceiling mounted TV. So I have been acquiring some Yoga DVDs in order to actually get into the practice. Weight lifting and running are more my forte, but I realize that blending that with Yoga for flexibility is the important 3rd part of the equation. So for expert commentary on Yoga, you will have to look elsewhere, but I hope that I can be helpful to others, who also are Yoga beginners.
First off the idea of flow Yoga attracted me. I am an avid woodworker, and when I get into flow, everything starts to come together very efficiently. My mind and body/motions become one. Without distractions my best work is done in that state of mind. Much has been written on the subject of ""flow"". Shiva Rea starts out the DVD with a walk on the beach in Hawaii, where this DVD is filmed, and says the following words about flow.
""Flow is the natural state of Yoga that we've known since birth. From artists to athletes, the state of flow is defined as the ability to move freely, in an unbroken stream of awareness, uniting your mind, body, and breath, with your creative intelligence. The essence of this program is to support that state of flow in your body, and life through Yoga.""
This DVD has a unique feature; you have 2 music options. You can play the music only as a background to your own routine, or you can play the music with the video instruction, including the voice.
There is some beautiful footage of the surf, winds, birds, and waves with appealing music playing in the background.
For the novice, some of the poses she gets into may be a bit of a stretch.( No pun intended :-) Nevertheless, her fluidity and ease will inspire you.
The instructional part of the DVD is in 4 sections, including foundation flow with some breathing exercises, beginning backbend, relaxing and flexibility, and finally the beginners standing pose flow.
Like I said I am not an expert on Yoga, but I have several DVD's and this one is done expertly, with excellent video, audio, and appealing background, and honestly, I do feel inspired to begin to practice after seeing this one. It is definitely one of my favorites.",1210896000,,2263,4.5354523227383865
3129463,4,B0014CSNDY,"The cover of this DVD proclaims, ""No yoga experience necessary"", but I don't believe it.  Someone new to yoga couldn't possibly keep up with the moves; nor would they know the ""lingo"" to understand what some of the instructions are.

The scenes are filmed in some amazing places, and the soundtracks that go along with the instructions are wonderful.  You have the choice to hear just the soundtrack, or the soundtrack and the instruction.  The video editing leaves a lot to be desired though.  Too many cuts make an otherwise relaxing experience seem jarring.

Two strikes against it, but I'll still give it four out of five stars.  As I said, I like the music, and I love the background scenery.  It doesn't have the ""workout"" feel that a lot of yoga DVDs have.  There is almost no repetition; just move after move showing you lots of flow yoga moves.  It makes yoga look relaxing and calm, where a lot of DVDs make it seem like a training video for a yoga army.",1210809600,,964,4.520231213872832
3129464,3,B0014CSNDY,"I have only done the Flow Yoga once, so I will be back to edit this review when I have done the workout several times.  For now, here are my initial thoughts on it:

Visually, it is beautiful (filmed on Kauai, Hawaii, my favorite of the Hawaiian islands).

Production values seem very good on what I've seen so far.

The instructor has a calming, pleasant voice and seems very experienced.

*I* would not consider this a beginner's workout.  I was not even able to get into many of the poses in this workout much less to hold them for an extended period of time as is illustrated.  So that you can make a comparison, here is a little about me.  I'm 55 years old.  I'm about 40 pounds overweight.  My flexibility level is poor (I have osteoarthritis in my spine), but my fitness level is good.  For the past several years, I have been working out an average of 3-5 times per week and my workouts include cardio kickboxing, fast walking, tai chi, weight training and Pilates.  I have only taken 1 Yoga class and 1 Qijong class (both several years ago) previous to doing this DVD.

A DVD workout that I have used many times (and love) that I WOULD consider appropriate for a beginner (though in Pilates, not yoga) is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilates-Conditioning-for-Weight-Loss/dp/B00006473D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilates Conditioning for Weight Loss</a>.  It shows 3 different women doing the same workout at the beginner, intermediate and advanced levels, so that you can follow whichever one suits your fitness level and experience best.",1210809600,21,1593,5.100386100386101
3129465,5,B0014CSNDY,"The creators of this CD really got it right. Having only ever done yoga from book diagrams and descriptions, I found this venture into yoga on DVD quite refreshing. I was sort of concerned that the verbal instruction would detract from the routine or that the instructor would move from one thing to another too quickly for me to look up to follow. However, the way that the DVD is set up is that you see a video of Shiva Rea doing the yoga routine in beautiful relaxing settings such as in front of a waterfall, in the middle of a forest, or on the beach. However, she's not talking during the yoga routine. Instead, the instruction and music is all tastefully added as separate tracks. You can choose to just watch the routine, watch it with just the music, or watch it with an off-camera narrator of the various movements. I also like how the camera pans at just the right moment so that you can get a different view of Shiva Rea to make sure that you've got the pose right. Another great feature of the CD is that the different parts of the yoga routine are divided into separate chapters so that you can start wherever you would like.

The poses themselves are fairly simple and basic. There's no standing on your head or doing ridiculous things that the beginner couldn't join in with. Despite the slow nature of the routines, your heart and muscles get a nice work out. There were only a few times that I found myself unable to stretch my legs out quite like she could, but I'm sure practice will get me there.

The only thing I think could be a little better would be the explanation of when to inhale and when to exhale. With a very slow yoga routine, I tend to forget which one I'm supposed to be doing, so I wish the narrator would have mentioned it more often. Also, I'd hoped the DVD would contain more than one routine so that I wouldn't get bored doing the exact same thing over and over again.

Overall, I found the DVD to be quite enjoyable. I'll definitely prefer it to following instructions from a book.",1210809600,2,2023,4.375
3129466,3,B0014CSNDY,"I wanted to like this DVD more, I really did, because I really want and need to take advantage of all of yoga's benefits.  But I grew up in the era of Jane Fonda's 20 minute workouts.  I'm used to a complete workout in 20 minutes, not DVDs that break out different exercises for you to use in combination.

If you already take yoga lessons and are trained in slowing down, and breathing properly, and moving through poses for an hour, then you'll love this beautifully produced DVD with its incredibly supple and peaceful guide talking you through the poses and moves.

Or, if you are already a more meditative type of person who is familiar with yoga, this DVD would also be a good introduction.

But if you are a harried mom juggling a ton of activities who struggles to find 10 minutes every day to take a shower, then while you may need this DVD very much, it probably will irritate you more than help you.  The yoga DVD that I still love the most is ""Stress Relief Yoga"" by Suzanne Deason.  Note that real yoga guru types disparage the DVD I recommend because it doesn't hold poses long enough, it moves too fast, etc...  But for my purposes at this stage of my life, that DVD really does it for me.

This DVD, however, will have to wait until I am at a different point in my life.  From my perspective, this DVD is a 3.  Beautiful and inspirational but I just don't want to do it.  However, if you already practice yoga, I bet this DVD would be a 5.",1210809600,,1455,4.2700729927007295
3129467,4,B0014CSNDY,"I agree with others who argue that this isn't for beginners. While it might be considered beginning material for a yoga veteran, it would take a newbie several passes through the four sessions to grasp how the movements are performed. Even then a raw beginner might have problems since there is little explanation as to the nuances and elements of each posture.

I'm in good shape: weight training, martial arts for four decades, and occasionally yoga. While I didn't find the poses particularly difficult, I did have trouble keeping up from time to time because the changes were so quick and done without a how-to-do explanation.

Now, if you have practiced yoga in the past but have been away from it for awhile, this would be a good DVD to get you back into the groove. You could begin with one session a day, progress to two a day and continue until you're doing all four in one day for a good, relatively easy yoga workout.",1210636800,,928,4.5843373493975905
3129468,5,B0014CSNDY,"The best way to know if your yoga class/dvd is good is to ask yourself a question:
  - Do you feel relaxed and calm after the yoga class ?
  - Does your body feel light and breath fuild and calm after the class ?

This Yoga DVD does both of these and they compound each day with every practise.

Even though I do not have a very flexible body, I never felt that I am being too pressurized and hard to do yoga poses in this DVD - it was smooth, flowing and almost effortless.  Depending on your age and body condition, you may feel varying difficulties, but neverthless it is a beginners program and a very good way to start your yoga practise.

The other Yoga DVD which I have been following before I got into Shiva Rea is Bryan Kest's Power Yoga series, in which I have just been doing the video 1 (Beginner's series) - there are both +ves and -ves when I compare these DVDs
  - In comparison to Shiva Rea, I find Bryan's narration to be more information and more helpful - he makes certain  basics of yoga very clear such as (1) Make breath your priority, breath is the priority and the asans come after (2) Do not push or jam yourself into doing a pose and make yourself uncomfortable, if you are feeling uncomofortable, you are defeating the very purpose of doing yoga .... and may other such small tips and general overview of the basics which are very important for a beginner.  But Bryan kests poses are a bit more difficult to do.

Shiva Rea makes the yoga poses very easy and doable effortlessly.

Overall, if you are new to yoga, try Shiva Rea Yoga first and then you can move to Bryan kest's yoga series.",1210636800,,1615,4.269736842105263
3129469,5,B0014CSNDY,"While the DVD is advertised for beginners, I recommend a working knowledge of yoga to get the full benefit. The ""for beginners"" part obviously refers to vinyasa yoga. I am a semi-regular yoga practitioner, but I had no idea some of these poses, such as the backbends and lunges, could increase flexibility.

Shiva Rea is an excellent teacher and the backdrop scenery of Kauai is simply stunning. (Depending on who you talk to, Hawai'i is one of the healthiest states in the U.S.). I give her high praise for using the real names of the asanas (pronounced AHS-annas). I also like the way she calls Child's Pose the Wisdom Pose. ""No pain, no gain"" doesn't apply to pushing your body beyond its tolerance. The whole point of most yoga practice is to make you aware of your breath so you can achieve greater consciousness in meditation, which you can't do if you're constantly obsessing about how 73 minutes seems like an eternity with your aching back/hip/shoulders. The great thing about the DVD is that you can perform the routines in chapters, so you can work at your own pace. And remember to rest in wisdom pose if you need to! There's a marvelous relaxation sequence at the end.

I plan to make this DVD part of my fitness practice. The music and the rhythm is soothing and the exercises, true to the name of the yoga specialty, flow.",1210550400,2,1337,4.61344537815126
3129470,3,B0014CSNDY,"I have never done anything Yoga related in my life, so I decided to give it a try.  I am an avid road and mountain biker and I also lift weights several times a week and I was looking to try to add some flexibility and relaxation into my routine.

My initial thought after reading the outside of the box when it showed up was that 70 minutes of Yoga is way too much to do at one time!  It turns out that it is actually broken up into 5 different sections that can be watched all together or you can skip with scene selections to whichever one you want to do, so that was a nice feature.  The scenery was pretty nice, I don't really like the music all that much, and I really couldn't get into the whole yoga part.  I'm sure if I had some previous experience, this would be a little easier, but some of these moves and positions are a little beyond ""beginners"" in my mind despite the title.  So, if you are already into yoga and are looking for something new, this might work out for you, but if you have never done it before and want something with a lot of instruction, then there must be some better choices out there.",1210464000,,1120,4.114678899082569
3129471,3,B0014CSNDY,"Shiva Rea's Flow Yoga for Beginners is meant to be an introduction to this form of yoga. The DVD has several menu options including an Introduction which explains Flow Yoga and the essence of the program; play the entire workout; a chapter index; a biography of Shiva Rea; and music options (you can choose to just have music or have music and instructions). The chapter index also has several options: Foundation Flow; Beginner's Backward Flow; Beginner's Flexibility Flow; Shavagena; and the closing credits.

While it is labeled ""beginners"" and the box to the DVD says no yoga experience is necessary, this is a tough workout and I wouldn't recommend it for newcomers to yoga. It starts off slowly enough with a seated meditation that is meant to teach you how to link breath with movement, although it never really helped me get into the zone. After a few easy minutes, the yoga quickly became more difficult, although there are plenty of rest breaks built into the routine. Shiva Rea doesn't always explain what to do next, instead she just goes into the next move, which is frustrating for a beginner like me. It also broke the flow of yoga for me, as I constantly had to focus on the TV to see what she was doing instead of concentrating on the yoga. The DVD was filmed in Hawaii, a beautiful setting, but the camera sometimes focused too much on the scenery instead of the yoga. I also had a hard time positioning the yoga mat in order to see the TV, which made doing the yoga awkward.

While the yoga seemed to be good, it was not for beginners as advertised and you need to be quite flexible to do it. I'm not very flexible and I was very sore afterwards.",1210464000,,1665,4.528239202657807
3129472,4,B0014CSNDY,"This is 70 minute DVD of Flow yoga (vinysa) demonstrated by yoga master Shiva Rea.
Vinyasa is a simple form of asana that is easy to follow and no prior yoga experience is necessary. This is a variant of Surya Namaskara (Sun salutation), which is defined by a series of six specific postures with a breathing pattern. The narrator guides the viewers with instructions to practice the yoga postures, which is helpful for a beginner. The esoteric intention of vinysa is to facilitate the flow of prana (vital energy) to balance the koshs (sheaths) of the physical and metaphysical body. In a less esoteric language, the body heat increases circulation, contribute to muscle flexibility and strengthen the tissue and tendons. The last few minutes of the DVD is dedicated to Shavasana or Sarvasana that is performed to either begin or conclude a yoga session. It is a relaxing posture intended to rejuvenate the body, mind and spirit.

The background music is set the drum beats of Hawaiian music; the producers could have considered using Hindustani classical music, especially instrumental music such as, sitar or violin using a morning or an evening raga as appropriate.

3129473,2,B0014CSNDY,"Don't waste your time and money on this 70 minute non-flowing ""workout.""

""For Beginners,"" when applied to a workout means it's either for people with no prior experience or it's for people with a lower level of physical ability(my category).  This workout doesn't fit either description.  It moves slowly--which is often a pretense for a beginning level workout--but it goes nowhere.  You'll be saying, ""Are we there yet?"" but you'll never arrive.

Because I am not physically strong but still like to work out, I buy a lot of beginner workouts.  Usually there is something to enjoy in all of them, but I found this one annoying.

You must be very, very strong in your arms and legs.  Shiva Rea holds plank or other strenth-based poses for a long time.  She has you pulse in some poses which actually reduces flexibility rather than increasing it.  She has you twist in lunge and chair pose--unsupported--in order to warm up the spine for backbends.  Hello, if you want to warm up the spine with twists why not sit down?  I wasn't getting a warm-up while my thighs were burning and my balance was challenged.  It would be OK as a standing pose, but don't call it a warm-up and maybe don't hold it quite so long.

Shiva Rea uses a lot of yoga terminology and there are no captions showing you the names or their English translations, so if you don't already know the names of the poses, you may never figure them out.

Shiva Rea talks very slowly; it's hard to keep paying attention to her and keep focused.  The workout goes slowly.  I couldn't stay interested or enjoy it.

And for those who care about such things, could she have worn modest shirts?  They were fine while she was standing up, but we spend forever doing plank pose or forward bending poses and the shots were often focused head-on.  Puh-lease, that's NOT what I want to be looking at when I do yoga; shots like that don't show me what the pose looks like.  I have a number of yoga videos that are much less offensive, so I know you don't have to wear stuff like that.",1210118400,19,2036,4.493188010899183
3363824,5,B0014CSNDY,"Shiva Rea's Flow Yoga For Beginners is a work of mastery.  She is one of the most creative yoginis teaching today. If you can connect with her at Exhale Studios in the LA area or at a Yoga Journal Conference, don't miss the opportunity to study with her.

This DVD emphasizes ""No yoga experience necessary.""  It is the first creative flow DVD truly appropriate for beginners.

This beautifully filmed video features Shiva's unique flowing style presented in such a way anyone can do it.

One of the nicest parts of training with Shiva and witnessed on this DVD is her non-stop awareness of exactly who she is teaching.

She constantly offers modifications for people with challenges in different parts of their body.

In a exercise program dominated by women, this DVD offers ""equal opportunity to men"".  It's going to be one of the DVDs I travel with
for those times I'm a road warrior and unable to hook up with a yoga class.

This DVD is the finest introduction to where the creativity of Shiva Rea is today.

I would give it 10 stars if they were available.

This DVD was filmed in  Kauai , Hawaii as well as her next DVD's to be released this year and next year. This practice is aimed for beginners but everyone can enjoy it , the whole DVD is 70 minutes and has 4 segments (and savasana) that can be done seperately:
1. Foundation Flow - approx 14 min, Shiva starts with some breathing exercises on a rock near a beautiful waterfall and continues with simple poses like cat , cobra and some variations.
2. Beginner's Backbend Flow -approx. 20 min, there is a change of scenery and Shiva is in a beautiful garden with a lot of trees near a lake.
It is actually mainly standing poses - she prepares you for backbends in this practice with some lunge variations , chair with twists ,side bends, half splits and cobra variations and finally bow and camel. This segment might be quite challenging for true beginners but she shows easier modifications for most of the poses so it's definitely doable.
3. Relaxing Flexibility Flow - approx. 10 min , Shiva does simple stretches on the back , very similar to ""supine poses"" segment in Yoga Shakti it ends with a forward bend (badhakonasana) , it was very relaxing.
4. Beginner's Standing Pose Flow - approx 23 min . now she's at the beach , the clip from Amazon is taken from this segment and it is dark here too not just in the clip , it was probably shot at dusk. This is really a seperate practice cuz there is no sense of getting up for another energizing practice after the relaxing segment. It is a more challenging vinyasa that includes warrior 2 variations and some more backbends.
Too bad there is no matrix , because this segment is just stuck between the previous segments and the savasana ,it would be nice to do it before or after the second segment but since there are only a few chapters I guess it's not such a big deal to skip between them with the remote.
This segment also ends with a very short savasana , barely 2 minutes, which is another minor complaint but all in all I really enjoyed this practice and felt really stretched out , I can't wait for her next DVD's to come out.",1208304000,103,2167,4.3638613861386135

3363840,1,B0014CSNDY,"I have several ""beginner"" yoga DVDs in my collection. This one is my least favourite.  The poses are difficult to follow without repeatedly looking at the screen.  Shiva moves from one pose to another quite quickly and often without an advanced verbal cue.  The quick transitions do not allow the body time to completely settle into some poses. There are several instances where the sound track is not aligned with the video.  The whole thing feels disjointed and lacks flow in my mind.  Every once and a while I come back to this video thinking that now that I am advancing in my practice that I will be able to enjoy this more:  this has not been the case.  It's time for me to get rid of this.

I would highly recommend any DVD's with Elaine Brower or other videos in the ""Element Yoga""'series.",1437436800,4,797,4.486111111111111

This is not a well instructed beginner DVD because she has you doing fairly difficult poses for the beginner with little instruction or modification. What I mean by little instruction is she barely tell you how to get to your next move or what to what out for as a beginner.

This is the only yoga DVD thus far that has actually HELPED my back instead of strain it. While it was a little slow for me, it is a beginners DVD and that's what my back needed.

I have a number of Shiva Rea's DVDs and have practiced with her live so I am familiar with how challenging and utterly creative she can be.  I have to say I am very surprised at how good this is for a DVD marketed for beginners.  I think it is a wonderful foundation practice for beginners, but for also experienced yogis as well.  I have done this three times and it is really really good and sooo relaxing.  There is a saying in yoga that each pose is endless, and often times I get in robot mode, but this DVD really is done with such great intention at slowing things down and remembering the nuances and lines of energy of each pose. I don't want to describe the sequences because I think this will take away from the experience of the DVD.  This is not your typical sequenced DVD ""ok now we are going into downward facing dog"" it really has a flow and intelligence to it.  The setting in Hawaii is of course stunning and her voice is very soothing.  I think this is a great DVD for both beginners at advanced practitioners.",1402272000,,1070,4.236453201970443

Shiva does a great job explaining thoroughly what each position means and how to exactly place your body. I was a NON yoga person until I gave this a shot. She is great and I feel so much stronger I do this dvd about 3 times a week on my ""easy"" exercise nights. This isn't easy by any means but its great for beginning she gives you other options if one position isn't working for you as a beginner. I really am more flexible after having this product and using it for a few weeks now.

3363865,2,B0014CSNDY,I wanted to love this because I like Shiva Rea's videos. I think she needs to fire her producers because they were clearly 'beginners'. I love the arrangement of 10 min foundation and 4 20 mins sessions so you can mix and match what you want to do. The most annoying part though is this weird tantric music that makes it seem like you are in some horror movie. The worst part? There is no way to turn it off. As a result I don't use it as much as I wanted to. One can mute the sound but then you can't follow her instructions. lost opportunity.,1389744000,,544,4.093457943925234

3363881,2,B0014CSNDY,"I have several of Shiva Rea's videos and bought this one for what I thought would be a relaxing workout when I want to unwind without working too hard. The huge dealbreaker for me is that of the four sections the standing flow poses are last.  Right after a section of more relaxing poses that should prepare you for the Savasana. This is the most difficult section so why in the world would it be placed after you're already relaxed and feeling all ooey goody yoga good?  That is not flow.  It's a jolt to the system!

There are too many other yoga dvds in my collection that don't have this problem so I will not be using this much if ever.  It's actually a shame because if not for this issue it would have been an excellent dvd.  One that challenges beginners both new to yoga and exercise in general yet offers the more advanced a nice relaxing change of pace.  Sadly the order of the sequences really ruins it for me and stopping to fiddle with a dvd remote mid session is not something I should have to do.",1377648000,3,1013,4.272251308900524

So, while I am attending classes locally, they don't always fit with my schedule and as a result I decided to order some new yoga DVDs to round things out.

This is a good DVD, not too challenging, easy to follow, excellent form to follow. While I prefer a bit more of a challenge I think I can integrate parts of this into my training, perhaps even as light strength & flexibility training on cardio days.

I made the mistake of assuming that a DVD with ""for beginners"" would target people like me.  Instead, it apparently targets people who are familiar with most of the yoga poses and know how to do them properly...but are beginners to ""flow"" yoga.  I guess ""Flow Yoga"" is a particular kind of yoga...I'm beginner enough that I don't know there are different kinds

I tried yoga 2 years ago as part of P90X, but at that time I wasn't really interested in doing yoga.  I assumed that there would be better dvd's out there that made yoga 100% of their focus.  I think I'll try and dig up a copy of the yoga disc that came with it as that was very detailed in comparison to ""Flow Yoga for Beginners"".  Or maybe I'll buy ""Yoga for Dummies"" and work my way up to this one.

I'm keeping this disc and the other one by Shiva Rea that I bought (based on the glowing recommendations)as they seem like they'd be good once I had a clue what I was doing.  If I get to that point I'll adjust this rating to properly reflect my opinion at that point.

And if anyone who reads this knows of a good beginners yoga dvd for a weightlifter who's getting too old for the game, please send some recommendations my way.  THANKS!",1357603200,3,1297,4.2317073170731705

You have to be a 'committed' beginner in order to get the most out of this dvd.  If you're afraid to try, or easily put off, this may not be the one for you.  Be patient with yourself if you're a true beginner.  Do a little each time and you'll see how fast you catch on and you'll see yourself improve.

I found this video to be wonderful for beginners as Shiva Rea's demonstrations give us a perfect example of how these poses can be accomplished.  She frequently advises and cautions us to be aware of what our bodies are telling us, that in time that perfect posture will be attained. That gentle guidance prevents discouragement.

Her encouraging words of ""be patient"" and to let the body attain the pose naturally, allows us to accept the fact that each of us has our own abilities, and the purpose of this practice is to enjoy the ""flow"" of yoga, not just perfect posturing, as I had originally understood it.

I find her guiding words for visually grounding and centering the flow very helpful for me as a beginner and would recommend this highly for anyone who shares

Like that DVD,  Shiva Rea's Flow Yoga for Beginners has beautiful scenery. The flow yoga in this program is broken into smaller segments, which is appropriate for beginners. As always, it is helpful to watch the program before trying it, particularly because some of the vocal instructions are overwhelmed by the music.

Just remember that if you feel overwhelmed, you should take a step back and watch what is happening on the screen. The idea with yoga is to build your strength and flexibility gradually, not to push yourself beyond your limits. If you practice consistently, you will find that each time, you will be able to stretch farther or hold the position for a longer period of time.",1303257600,3,906,5.605839416058394
3363916,3,B0014CSNDY,"Let's just start by saying any person hoping to buy this had better be a very good mimic, or else they should try a few yoga classes to get a feel for some of the asanas. Also, Shiva has a funny way of confusing her inhale/exhale commands. Like during the flexibility flow, (when stretching the leg while holding the calf with the hands) she commands an exhale a few times in a row. Just a mix-up, but seeing as how this is a voice-over and not live-action, it could have been easily corrected in the editing process.
-The standing pose flow was shot at sunset, and as others have said, it's very dark and sometimes hard to see what she's doing.
-Shavasana is very, very short. I feel like I'm just about to really relax, and then that drumming for the credits interrupts the quiet music.
-Shiva really knows her stuff, and it's easy to see. She has a great way of leading a flow and providing modifications, stresses knowing one's own boundaries, etc.

I've taken yoga classes before, and now I'm in the process of becoming a serious student, practicing most days out of the week.  I am 5'8, 120 lbs, exercise regularly, in my 20s...I'm not some huge weakling.  But I feel like these poses were very advanced, and I needed more guidance and explanation than was offered.

3363918,4,B0014CSNDY,"I like this DVD. Before doing this workout, I had only a small amount of yoga experience and I found this DVD to be very helpful. I would definitely say that it is for beginners. Many of the poses that she does are modified to accommodate the beginner and are meant to open up the back and hips and to stretch out tight muscles and limbs. I have been doing it for a few weeks and am now ready for something more challenging. Only two of the four segments raise my heart rate, but just a little at that. But I have felt my body slowly becoming more and more stretched out and stronger. Also, she is very supportive of starting out slow with small movements and very slowly moving towards flexibility. I felt like it was a really good program to start with, because again, many of the exercises are meant to simply get the body opened up and stretched out so that you can do more advanced poses later. Overall, a good introduction to yoga for a beginner. If you are looking to simply become more flexible in order to move on to something more challenging later, I suggest starting with this DVD.",1297641600,,1093,4.336585365853659
3363919,3,B0014CSNDY,"Why I enjoy this video:
My favorite yoga class was taught by a student of Shiva Rea, but I moved away and haven't found a replacement class yet.  This video met my expectations well -- fitting breath with movement, fitting both with music, etc.

I was in 2 car accidents in the last 14 months, and while rehabbing I fell completely out of the habit of practicing yoga.  This is a gentle re-introduction.

Why I would not recommend this to others:
My #1 pet peeve is that Shiva Rea skips the half split on the right side in one of the sequences.  Every single time I do this video I have to pause it and add the half split in.  It drives me crazy!!!

As others have mentioned, this video does not contain much in the way of explanations.  If you're new, I suggest you either go to a class in person, or, if that's impossible, get one of Barbara Benagh's videos -- they're much more clear.",1296864000,,887,4.269461077844311
3363920,2,B0014CSNDY,"I bought this DVD back in Jan 2009. I just recently got it out again and tried it. Now I know why it sat unused for a year and a half. It KILLS my knees during lunge poses.

I also find it very advanced for being a beginner's DVD. She holds poses for a long period of time, which I am unable to do. Yet! Granted, I hope to work up to that strength with repeated use, but considering it states it's for beginners, I would think there would be more consideration for the length of time poses are held in that regard.

Another point is that I found myself having to repeatedly look at the TV since she uses Sanskrit terms for poses. What's that you say, Shiva? I'm a beginner, remember? I have no problem learning the correct terms, but at least give me some instruction first. So there was a lot of stopping and starting of the video and of my poses. I actually just stopped altogether and just watched the whole program without doing any of it so I could at least familiarize myself first. However, that will take a number of viewings and not ""doings"" to get comfortable doing her routines without having to stop and look at her.

Her pace is slow, which is good, but with the unfamiliar terms, having to stop and start again, and the time held holding some of the poses (that require a lot of strength), I cannot recommend it for beginners. And I am not completely a beginner. I have done some yoga for a little bit over the years, but not regularly because I just can't seem to find the one that fits me best.....recommendations are welcome. :)",1288310400,8,1545,4.302405498281787
3363921,5,B0014CSNDY,"I've tried several beginner yoga videos, and this is by far the best.  Shiva Rea's instructions are very thorough, and I had no problems following them.

When this becomes easy, I will definitely be looking at her other videos.",1287532800,,331,4.306451612903226

I especially LOVE the modified warrior 1 posture - I really felt a change in my hips after the first time.  I love the way Sheava Rea teaches, very in the moment and in-tune with the body.  The DVD helps me learn how to breath and integrate.  Even at this basic level, I am noticing better posture, breathig and body awareness.

I have heard so much about Shiva Rea, but this DVD was much to fast and complicated for me. She went from move to move without even explaining what she was doing & how she did it. It was almost like she was physically saying ""You know these poses, so now do them"". I was also expecting her to slowly move into the more difficult poses,but NO..she didnt.
I ultimately had to quit on her.

3363924,3,B0014CSNDY,"I consider myself a beginner and this was my first Shiva Rea DVD. Even as a beginner, I found that the routine was too slow. I was looking for a routine that moved more quickly from one pose to another. I skipped the first warm up section completely (which is very long for a warm up) since it was mostly breathing. The following sections I'd classify more as slow stretching routines for flexibility. The Standing Poses routine is the only one I kind of enjoyed. The rest I found rather boring. On a positive note the cinematography is slick, scenery is beautiful and new-agey music is enjoyable. It has not turned me off Shiva Rea at all, I just wish I'd started with a different DVD.

I also have Eoin Finn's Pure and Simple Yoga and actually ended up liking this video a lot more for the routine alone. It throws you right into flowing, challenging sequences and could easily double as an instructor-led class. Shiva Rea's DVD is lot more feminine and stylized than Eoin's but the workout factor in his DVD was higher.

I plan on trying Eoin's Power Yoga for Happiness 2 Surf Edition at the same time as Shiva Rea's Daily Energy Flow. We'll see which I enjoy more out of those two.",1275264000,,1185,4.456221198156682

I am so excited, I will have it in my DVD player for tomorrow!!",1262995200,2,379,3.691358024691358
3363931,5,B0014CSNDY,"I am not a big yoga fan. In fact, most yoga DVDs bore me.  But something about Shiva in the video clips always intrigued me.  She is really an awesome instructor. I wish I had paid less attention to the reviewers that said this DVD was not for beginners, as I wasted time and money on some really boring beginner DVDs.

I look at yoga as a way to enhance the other fitness activities I already do.  I completed the first three flows today after doing the elliptical trainer and strength exercises, in replacement of my regular stretching & flexibility routine.  I would not normally complete 45 minutes of yoga in one sitting, so I do appreciate that each of these flows can be performed individually.

I have hip dysplasia on my right side, a bad knee (left side), and a posterior innominate rotation on my left (this means when my back rotates my right leg becomes shorter than my left). Thanks to physical therapy and a focus on core strength & flexibility the rotation is now mostly stable. I continue to work through the other issues.  While I may comment on these limitations in my review, I would not deduct points in my rating because this DVD does not claim to be therapeutic for any of these.  I simply include the notes in case they are of help to someone else who may have some similar limitations.

These are the flows I completed today:
1) Foundation flow:  This was a very relaxing and simple flow, starting with breathing and going through some basic flexibility poses. The breathing would be something that if presented wrong would really bore me, but Shiva did a great job.
2) Beginner's Backbend Flow:  I had completed part of this flow as a bonus on another DVD and it convinced me to order this DVD. This is such a relaxing flow. I can see completing this flow many times in the future.  With hip dysplasia on one side and a bad knee on the other, I find balance when doing lunges on one side is not as good as it should be.  At times I did place one hand on a table for balance.  I look forward to my balance improving as I repeat this flow.  Also, I did not squat down as low as Shiva did when doing the chair pose with twist, but found my own variation.  The only pose I did not perform was the bow pose (for fear of pulling on my knee), so I did cobra instead. With some slight modifications, I feel this flow can be adjusted for beginners, and Shiva also mentions some modifications during the flow.
3) Relaxing Flexibility Flow: Coming from a non-yoga background, I recognize variations on standard priformis and hamstring stretches.  (I do use a stretch strap for the hamstring stretches.)  This is followed by a great hip/inner thigh stretch that was new for me, and then a sitting forward bend. This flow is very relaxing and I think most people would be able to complete it.

I agree with other reviewers that it would have been nice to have a matrix as the fourth flow appears to be quite different than the other ones, and the shivasana is at the end.

I have not yet tried the Beginner's Standing Pose Flow, and will likely update my review once I have.  I think this is the most challenging flow on the DVD, and gives me something to work into. I have also ordered Shiva's newest DVD (Daily Energy - Vinyasa Flow Yoga) and can't wait to receive it.

UPDATE:  I've used the first three flows many times times now and love them.  I've already worked past the minor limitations I mentioned from the backbending flow.  I can see using these flows, in particular the backbending flow over and over again.

I finally did get to the standing flow today.  I did flows in this order: Standing, Backbend, Flexibility.  I felt so relaxed when I was done. These are nice, gentle, soothing flows for me.  This DVD continues to be a favorite that I expect I will use over and over again.

It's interesting as I look back at the review because yoga has now become a regular part of my routine - this DVD was the starting point for that.",1262390400,8,3956,4.409090909090909
3363932,5,B0014CSNDY,"I started my yoga journey with Kundalini, and then this DVD was recommended to me. WOW! This DVD moves quickly, but you do each set multiple times (as is standard in vinyasa flow). My entire body was sore after this workout. In fact, the first time I did this DVD I absolutely had to take breaks because my arms, legs, and core were shaking. Mind you, I am an avid long-distance runner and am in pretty good shape. From that moment on I was hooked. It's fairly tradition, but the instructions Shiva Rea gives are so amazing. She explains moves in a manner that allow me to open up to them in entirely new ways. The background on this entire video is all filmed on location and it is just breath-taking. I have watched this DVD just to relax after work before, not even doing the yoga set itself.

However I would like to add that vinyasa, or flow yoga, is a quite challenging form of yoga, not usually recommended for beginners.  I think that Shiva Rea does very well in introducing this form of yoga to those unfamiliar with it.  I really love the DVD, music and presentation, so I went back to it after using the Giam beginner yoga DVDs for a few weeks.  At that point it was not completely unreasonable to attempt the flows in this program- especially with all the variations she introduces to make it less physically challenging.  I have favorite moments in the program and find it very easy to navigate to them because the DVD is broken down into 5 sections.  I have Rhumatoid Arthritis and yoga practice has helped me with my pain, but some days are better than others, on bad days I just do one flow.  I like that this DVD gives you the option to do that.  I would recommend this to a beginner as long as you try this as maybe your second DVD, and the real ""beginner"" ones get old fast.",1247702400,4,1105,4.35609756097561
3363934,5,B0014CSNDY,"Shiva Rea defines flow as, ""a natural state of yoga that we've known since birth  from artists to athletes the state of flow is defined as the ability to move freely in an unbroken stream of awareness uniting your mind, body, breath with your creative intelligence.""  Moving freely in yoga is not something that beginners really can do, but this is still a worthwhile DVD for people starting out in yoga who are in resonable shape and serious about doing more.

It looks glorious on my big screen TV, images of Hawaii with just the instructor working out (no big class in the background).  It is a peacful relaxing vive.  But while you can select music-only or music-and-voice there is no voice only selection for beginners who may have problems hearing all the instructions. However this is a small quibble.

My only complaint is that it is broken up into individual segments, so it only ""flows"" sporadically, but I suppose that is appropriate since this is for beginners.  Flow yoga is physically challenging (that's why I got this ""beginner"" DVD), so the breaks between each flow are nice for those who may not be able to make it through the whole routine.  Shiva Rea is an amazingly youthful and energetic instructor, and I find her style very easy to follow and motivating.  I will likely purchase another DVD of hers in the future.",1238803200,2,596,4.481481481481482

3363938,5,B0014CSNDY,"Just received my order! :) This afternoon I had my 1st 70min workout with this DVD. I have to say that this is really great! I've done yoga on and off for about 1yr with YogaZone's DVD ""Gentle Yoga"" - it includes two basic, well explained workouts that really prepared me for Shiva Rea. Compared to ""Gentle Yoga"", this DVD's workouts actually increased my heart rate for quite a bit! Though I'm not very athletic, I know most of the poses already, so I was able to follow all her instructions. But I agree with some of the reviews here - there are poses that require a bit of familiarity and endurance, so they may be a bit too advanced for absolute beginners.
But then again... Shiva is a great instructor. Her voice is very calming yet lifting. The workouts are professionally filmed with beautiful sceneries, and the background drumming music is subtle yet energetic.
Though some reviewers commented rather negatively on some of Shiva's ambiguous instructions such as ""temple of heart"", ""open heart"", ""root your feet"" etc., I found them to be interesting and at times helpful. Those are abstract, conceptual ideas that are not meant to be scrutinized and taken literally. When the music starts, I get into the mindset and know what to do with my body, everything falls into the right places, and I'd be good to go.
The workouts could be a bit more varied though. In the third section Shiva introduces a routine that combines Chataronga, Cobra with Warrior Poses (etc...). I'm pretty sure that she means to go through it a couple of times so the routine becomes familiar and begins to flow. But still it's a tiny bit too much repetition for me.
However I did bought Yoga Shakti, Shiva's highest ranked DVD with 3.5 hrs of routines... So i've got nothing to complain :)",1224028800,2,1770,4.65814696485623
3363939,3,B0014CSNDY,"'No yoga experience necessary' proclaims the box.  'Score!' I think.  'I know squat about yoga, so this should be perfect!'

What they don't mention is that this isn't necessarily for people not already rather fit.  Each segment requires a certain level of endurance and strength that many rank beginners just don't have.  She does make some modifications, but the moves remain difficult, sometimes prohibitively so.  Also, despite the proclamation on the box, it seems as though some foreknowledge of yoga is in fact necessary.  Some moves are cued by name rather than by description, which makes the first few viewings difficult to follow.

Overall, I can't really say that I recommend this to beginners in general.  Fit beginners, maybe.  Advanced beginners in yoga, sure.  Not so much everyone else.  I wish I could like this DVD, as the scenery is lovely and Ms. Rea obviously knows her stuff, but I just can't get far enough into it to make it worth my while.",1223942400,18,965,4.852760736196319
3363940,5,B0014CSNDY,"I figured this would be a good DVD to start with before I immersed myself into Yoga Shakti. I'm glad I did! I think this is not only a nice introduction to Flow Yoga, but to the instructor herself. I had heard many great reviews about Shiva Rea so I couldn't wait to get my first DVD from her.

First of all, she does an excellent job in breaking down the various poses little by little so you are not overwhelmed. Also, I really appreciated the fact that she introduced gentle variations throughout so you could work up to the more complex poses. The voice over and cuing for the most part are very good and the scenery is gorgeous.

I'll agree with other reviewers in saying that the Savasana at the end is very brief, but other than that, this DVD is a great intro to her style and technique. For the anyone else who may consider purchasing this DVD, getting a book that references the English and Sanskrit names for the poses may be helpful as well.

I hope to buy more of her DVD's soon after I've done this routine for awhile.",1220400000,,1032,4.282051282051282
3363941,4,B0014CSNDY,"Flow yoga is a bit different from the style I usally practice (Bikram), but I found it enjoyable and challenging.

Shiva Rea is a good instructor and it was very enjoyable to watch her fit physique perform these yoga flows in the lush Hawaiian scenery accompanied by pleasant if a bit repetititve music.  Actually performing the flows  myself was a bit more difficult.  I would label this DVD as intermediate rather than beginner.  Poses are not explained and things move along at a decent clip.  If you don't know the poses by name already, then you will be a bit lost, at least until the 4th or 5th viewing.  Also, some of the moves require poses that take your eyes off the screen and it is easy to fall behind at these times.  I would have liked the DVD to close with a more relaxing flow, but that is a minor quibble as you can watch it in a different order if you wish.

The production values are top notch like a movie. Camera, editing, lighting, sound, set design is all gorgeous... you can see that in the videos. All instruction from her is given in voice over. She gives great information both in a spiritual manner & which specific anatomy muscles you are using as well as which are being stretched & how it benefits the body as a whole physically.
Foundation Flow:  14 min
By a waterfall, Deep breathing/Prana & moving hands w/the breath. Table/cat with 1 need to nose & repeated several times. Practicing plank & chaturanga (low staff/plank pose), child's pose, mild push ups while on  knees to build upper body strength & practice getting into chaturanga, cobra, 1 leg up locust with arms down, going between table & downward dog several times, full downward dog & ends w/child's.
Beginner's Back bend Flow: 21 min
See Video Below to see backdrop of her by a lily pond. Light side stretches w/outstretched hand like dvd cover. Standing fwd bends mild & then held a long time, mountain pose w/mild back bend/stretch a couple of times. Low lunge w/back knee on the floor. She calls half splits but also  similar to pyramid but lower. Mild chaturanga, cobra, locust w/just the arms up, child's, table w/knee to nose, other side lunge again w/o pyramid, standing fwd bend, mountain, simple standing side bend stretch,  mountain w/mild back bend, chair pose, chair w/prayer twist (she explains how to get more twist using the lower hand to push the top one up) (this is held for a very long time so it will be challenging to leg muscles) standing fwd bend, chair twist to the other side, standing fwd bend, lunge w/prayer twist (also held a long time), pyramid, downward dog on the knees which is much easier to do & opens up the shoulders as well),  lung w/prayer twist on other side, pyramid, bow, lay on stomach/rest, mild camel, hero's pose (she doesn't say it's name, it is very hard to do unless flexible & VERY bad on the knees if you have any issues, she only does it & says just sits back & stays sit cross legged if you have issues), sit & breathe deeply w/hands. Laying on back, both knees to chest, then both knees to one side then the other, then one knee to chest only, then other, then lay back to rest. This is very challenging for beginners as she holds the poses for much longer then most instructors & longer in one pose can really tax muscles.
Relaxing Flexibility Flow: 10 min
Same lily pond. Laying on back, one knee to chest only, then other, then one ankle crossed on one knee & pulled to the chest (held for over a minute), one knee bent & the other leg straight pulled toward the head. Repeat on other side, ankle crossed on knee (only held 45 seconds), leg to head. Both knees to chest, happy baby pose (on back with bent knees each knee to respective shoulder) & then slightly turn hips back/forth (very mild) & ends in butterfly. This is very mild & very relaxing, this is not a workout as more as light stretching. I found it too slow a pace & not enough poses for this length of time. This style is more yin yoga where poses are held a long time.
Beginner's Standing Pose Flow: 22 min
Beach scene you see on trailer. Table, child's, table, downward dog, 3 legged down dog w/one straight leg in sky, high lunge (back leg up), slow chaturanga on knees, mild cobra, child's, table, downward dog. Other side 3 legged down dog, high lunge (back leg up), faster chaturanga on knees, cobra, child's, downward dog. 3 legged down dog, mild warrior 2 (w/back leg resting on knee, not foot like full), mild side angle (same leg placement as previous pose & arm resting on knee only which is easier), chaturanga, mild locust w/arms & 1 leg,  child's, down dog. Same thing on the other side. 3 legged down dog, full warrior 2 (she does pelvic tilt here to teach you to pull hips toward the belly butt to lengthen the spine), reverse/revolved warrior, side angle (arm on knee still), warrior 2, pyramid (back knee on ground),chaturanga, half bow, child's, down dog. At faster speed, warrior 2, revolved warrior, side angle (hand on knee),  warrior 2, pyramid, chaturanga, full bow, child's & down dog.  Repeat again w/cobra instead of bow 4 more times. Rest in child's for a full minute. I did not like how this harder standing poses comes after relaxing laying back poses, it makes no sense after heating up with the back bend flow & cooling off with the flexibility flow.
Shavasana: 2 min
Laying down & her guiding you to relax 1/2 of it & silence the rest.

Shiva Rea is very advanced yogini & I believe this is her first beginner DVD. She seems to be new at teaching beginners & is very tough almsot like the drill sargent of yoga. She has a lovely voice but there is a stiffness to it. I did not like how it flowed, nor something about her teaching. I found all her other yoga DVDs too advanced for me though I'd been practicing semi-regularly for over 6 years. I've had no problem & LOVE Rodney Yee, Rainbeau Mars, Sean Corn, Ateeka, Yoga for Sex (excuse the title, but it's normal yoga in fun format), The Firm's Power Yoga,  I also LIKE Susan Deason, Max Strom, Kristen Mcgee, Kabbalah Yoga, Yoga Radiance & a couple of others.

3363944,4,B0014CSNDY,"I give this video four stars instead of five, only because the yoga was a little less intense than what I prefer (i.e. power yoga).  Otherwise, it's a great video.

The scenery is stunning - definitely the best looking exercise video I've ever seen.  Backgrounds include a waterfall, a jungle, and a beach at sunset.  The sound track was also very good.

The yoga itself is low-intensity, beginning very slowly and working up to slightly more difficult poses, but nothing a beginner can't handle.  No crazy pretzel poses or transitions into handstands or anything like that.  I do think it would be a pretty good low-intensity workout if you did the whole thing - for me, it moved a little slowly though, and like most yoga videos it's a long, long workout from start to finish.  I just ran out of patience, but I don't blame the video for that.

It was also a very graceful kind of yoga, at times looking like a slow dance.

I think this is a great video for anyone looking for a low-intensity, low-impact, calming yoga workout with really nice visual and sound.  Also a good video for beginners.",1216857600,,1097,4.574358974358974

I believe what the Yoga session here is for someone who has not advanced into this style, or more like the style of Shiva Rea, who has several different yoga style DVDs.

This DVD instruction is set up in segments, which indicate to the beginner that you can be selective on what you might want to focus on.  It is a lengthy program, over 70 minutes, much to much for a beginner.  What the beginner can do is  workout to a chapter segment at a time.  The poses move fast and you must be very flexible already!

What is beautiful is the setting and the soft unobtrusive music.  An expert would be safe without the instruction.  If you choose to listen to the music while instruction, keep in mind that instruction moves quickly also.  Language may be unfamiliar to a beginner.  And, what I also like is that the poses are doable, without any extremely difficult poses, but again, you must be somewhat flexible.  And, be flexible enough to poke your head various challenging ways, to SEE the instruction.

The teacher, Shiva Rea, is calming and also very intelligent and has a great ability to explain what we are doing succinctly as she guides us further and further into holistically styled workouts. This style of yoga is called ""flow yoga"". Indeed you do flow from one movement to the next, and your mind flows meditatively as well from one peaceful calming thought to the next while Shiva leads the way.

Of course a person cannot expect to climb a mountain in one day if one has never done any sort of movement for a while...but for beginner yoga, if you are the kind of person who likes to work out at home, quietly and thoughfully, sensing the movements of your body as this fine teacher, Shiva Rea, explains them, this is the DVD for you.

Maybe her idea of ""beginner"" is different from mine but I came at this program having no idea what even the basics are.  I was actually hoping for something that would really truly be for beginners and would slowly explain the moves rather than go quickly from one position to another.

Having said that I do find that the program is getting easier as I stick with it so if you are not easily scared off then this may not be a bad choice.  I guess I'd suggest that you not be afraid to hit pause over and over as you try to get each position right.

The settings of waterfalls and a grassy knoll are visually calming and the sounds of nature will help you to bliss out.

I receommend before purchasing any yoga DVD, know what type of yoga you are interested in, educate yourself so you won't be disappointed or overwhelmed. Vinyasa Flow is not your basic yoga stretching. It is creative movement and yes, you are constantly moving it seems, it is considered part of the Astanga family.

3363958,4,B0014CSNDY,"I enjoy yoga, but I usually prefer it in twenty to thirty-minute doses after cardio.  I find yoga valuable for maintaining flexibility and enhancing muscular control as I enter middle age.  My longtime favorite yoga practice on DVD has been Sara Ivanhoe's Yoga Makeover set of five 20-minute yoga workouts.  However, I've been using them for quite a while and I'm ready for a change-up.  With that goal in mind I got ""Shiva Rea - Flow Yoga for Beginners.""  Although Ms. Ivanhoe's videos are still my favorite, this Shiva Rea workout will add the spice of variety.

I was a bit hesitant to get this DVD since I could never get into her popular Yoga Shakti Complete Practice workout.  One of my biggest pet peeves with that one was the lack of time listings for the workout segments.  I like knowing how long a DVD workout is going to run so I can make an informed purchase and subsequently manage my workout time.  Unfortunately, this program also lacks segment durations on the packaging.  Yes, the back of the box states there is approximately 70 minutes on the DVD.  But there are five routines with unknown and differing durations.  Therefore, I had to go in blind and hope that the routines were a suitable length.  Thankfully they are.  But I shouldn't have to take such a leap of faith.  What's so hard about adding an individual workout routine time stamp to the packaging for buyer convenience?  I even checked Shiva Rea's self-named website hoping to get time info, but no such luck.  I went ahead and used the counter in my PC's DVD software to estimate the routine lengths:

1. Foundation Flow.  Set by a waterfall.  Poses include Downward Dog (with interesting variations) and Wisdom Pose.  About 14 minutes.
2. Beginner's Backbend Flow. Set next to a lily pond, on a small lawn with a pad surrounded by pots with burning wicks.  Lots of standing back work.  About 20 minutes.
3. Relaxing Flexibility Flow.  Setting is the same as #2.  Lots of leg stretches done while lying on the back.  Nice hip opener towards the end.  About 10 minutes.
4. Beginner's Standing Pose Flow. Set on the beach during sunset.  Includes Downward Dog w/leg raises and Half Warrior 2 pose.  About 20 minutes.
5. Shavasana. Set on the beach close to the end of sunset.  A quick relaxation routine done while lying on one's back.  About 2 minutes.

I worked my way through routines 2-4 and found them to be a good supplement to my cardio workout (I watched routines 1 and 5 while timing the routines on my PC).  Overall, I enjoyed the practices.  For example, I was impressed at how my body opened up and felt stronger just when she said it would during the Beginner's Standing Pose Flow routine.  In addition, I liked the pose variations that Ms. Rea demonstrated, such as the hip opener in routine #3 and the Half Warrior Two in routine #4.  As for Ms. Rea, she's a good teacher and yoga role model.  Her voice and physicality are perfectly suited to yoga: restful and serene, yet powerful and confident.  The background music added to the soothing ambiance and helped me relax.  Finally, the workout scenery is peaceful and beautiful - especially the beach at sunset.

However, along with the lack of time listings, I had some issues with the routines.  First, I'm not sure if this is really the best workout for a yoga newbie, especially an older person or someone with physical issues.  Ms. Rea leads this workout in voice-over, and sometimes things don't sync as well as they would have if she was calling in real time.  In addition, despite my decent level of fitness and yoga experience, my efforts to keep pace caused some problems with an old injury.  Ten years ago I had an ACL recon on my left knee using tissue from my hamstring.  Even after warming up, the Lunge in routine #2 tweaked my kneecap, and Half Warrior Two in routine #4 cramped my hamstring.  I'm hoping that these issues are aberrations, especially since I don't normally have that issue in Lunge pose.  Finally, even though I liked the beach scenery in routine #4, the filming took place too close to nightfall.  In some angles Ms. Rea's dark pants blended in with the sand so that it was hard to see her leg position.

Thankfully, these issues aren't showstoppers.  As Ms. Rea recommends, watching the DVD before diving in will familiarize you with the workout's intricacies, and a large-screen newer model TV will help with the video (I used a 13"" CRT TV with integrated DVD player).  I consider ""Shiva Rea - Flow Yoga For Beginners"" to be a good addition to my yoga workout routine.  It would be a fine introduction to Shiva Rea for young and daring yoga neophytes, but older yoga newbies and those with health issues should be careful and take time getting used to this workout.  Recommended - and I might even give ""Yoga Shakti"" another try...",1210982400,4,4814,4.635502958579882

So for expert commentary on Yoga, you will have to look elsewhere, but I hope that I can be helpful to others, who also are Yoga beginners.
First off the idea of flow Yoga attracted me. I am an avid woodworker, and when I get into flow, everything starts to come together very efficiently. My mind and body/motions become one. Without distractions my best work is done in that state of mind. Much has been written on the subject of ""flow"". Shiva Rea starts out the DVD with a walk on the beach in Hawaii, where this DVD is filmed, and says the following words about flow.
""Flow is the natural state of Yoga that we've known since birth. From artists to athletes, the state of flow is defined as the ability to move freely, in an unbroken stream of awareness, uniting your mind, body, and breath, with your creative intelligence. The essence of this program is to support that state of flow in your body, and life through Yoga.""
This DVD has a unique feature; you have 2 music options. You can play the music only as a background to your own routine, or you can play the music with the video instruction, including the voice.
There is some beautiful footage of the surf, winds, birds, and waves with appealing music playing in the background.
For the novice, some of the poses she gets into may be a bit of a stretch.( No pun intended :-) Nevertheless, her fluidity and ease will inspire you.
The instructional part of the DVD is in 4 sections, including foundation flow with some breathing exercises, beginning backbend, relaxing and flexibility, and finally the beginners standing pose flow.
Like I said I am not an expert on Yoga, but I have several DVD's and this one is done expertly, with excellent video, audio, and appealing background, and honestly, I do feel inspired to begin to practice after seeing this one. It is definitely one of my favorites.",1210896000,,2263,4.5354523227383865
3363960,4,B0014CSNDY,"The cover of this DVD proclaims, ""No yoga experience necessary"", but I don't believe it.  Someone new to yoga couldn't possibly keep up with the moves; nor would they know the ""lingo"" to understand what some of the instructions are.

The scenes are filmed in some amazing places, and the soundtracks that go along with the instructions are wonderful.  You have the choice to hear just the soundtrack, or the soundtrack and the instruction.  The video editing leaves a lot to be desired though.  Too many cuts make an otherwise relaxing experience seem jarring.

Two strikes against it, but I'll still give it four out of five stars.  As I said, I like the music, and I love the background scenery.  It doesn't have the ""workout"" feel that a lot of yoga DVDs have.  There is almost no repetition; just move after move showing you lots of flow yoga moves.  It makes yoga look relaxing and calm, where a lot of DVDs make it seem like a training video for a yoga army.",1210809600,,964,4.520231213872832
3363961,3,B0014CSNDY,"I have only done the Flow Yoga once, so I will be back to edit this review when I have done the workout several times.  For now, here are my initial thoughts on it:

Visually, it is beautiful (filmed on Kauai, Hawaii, my favorite of the Hawaiian islands).

Production values seem very good on what I've seen so far.

The instructor has a calming, pleasant voice and seems very experienced.

*I* would not consider this a beginner's workout.  I was not even able to get into many of the poses in this workout much less to hold them for an extended period of time as is illustrated.  So that you can make a comparison, here is a little about me.  I'm 55 years old.  I'm about 40 pounds overweight.  My flexibility level is poor (I have osteoarthritis in my spine), but my fitness level is good.  For the past several years, I have been working out an average of 3-5 times per week and my workouts include cardio kickboxing, fast walking, tai chi, weight training and Pilates.  I have only taken 1 Yoga class and 1 Qijong class (both several years ago) previous to doing this DVD.

A DVD workout that I have used many times (and love) that I WOULD consider appropriate for a beginner (though in Pilates, not yoga) is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilates-Conditioning-for-Weight-Loss/dp/B00006473D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilates Conditioning for Weight Loss</a>.  It shows 3 different women doing the same workout at the beginner, intermediate and advanced levels, so that you can follow whichever one suits your fitness level and experience best.",1210809600,21,1593,5.100386100386101
3363962,5,B0014CSNDY,"The creators of this CD really got it right. Having only ever done yoga from book diagrams and descriptions, I found this venture into yoga on DVD quite refreshing. I was sort of concerned that the verbal instruction would detract from the routine or that the instructor would move from one thing to another too quickly for me to look up to follow. However, the way that the DVD is set up is that you see a video of Shiva Rea doing the yoga routine in beautiful relaxing settings such as in front of a waterfall, in the middle of a forest, or on the beach. However, she's not talking during the yoga routine. Instead, the instruction and music is all tastefully added as separate tracks. You can choose to just watch the routine, watch it with just the music, or watch it with an off-camera narrator of the various movements. I also like how the camera pans at just the right moment so that you can get a different view of Shiva Rea to make sure that you've got the pose right. Another great feature of the CD is that the different parts of the yoga routine are divided into separate chapters so that you can start wherever you would like.

The poses themselves are fairly simple and basic. There's no standing on your head or doing ridiculous things that the beginner couldn't join in with. Despite the slow nature of the routines, your heart and muscles get a nice work out. There were only a few times that I found myself unable to stretch my legs out quite like she could, but I'm sure practice will get me there.

The only thing I think could be a little better would be the explanation of when to inhale and when to exhale. With a very slow yoga routine, I tend to forget which one I'm supposed to be doing, so I wish the narrator would have mentioned it more often. Also, I'd hoped the DVD would contain more than one routine so that I wouldn't get bored doing the exact same thing over and over again.

Overall, I found the DVD to be quite enjoyable. I'll definitely prefer it to following instructions from a book.",1210809600,2,2023,4.375
3363963,3,B0014CSNDY,"I wanted to like this DVD more, I really did, because I really want and need to take advantage of all of yoga's benefits.  But I grew up in the era of Jane Fonda's 20 minute workouts.  I'm used to a complete workout in 20 minutes, not DVDs that break out different exercises for you to use in combination.

If you already take yoga lessons and are trained in slowing down, and breathing properly, and moving through poses for an hour, then you'll love this beautifully produced DVD with its incredibly supple and peaceful guide talking you through the poses and moves.

Or, if you are already a more meditative type of person who is familiar with yoga, this DVD would also be a good introduction.

But if you are a harried mom juggling a ton of activities who struggles to find 10 minutes every day to take a shower, then while you may need this DVD very much, it probably will irritate you more than help you.  The yoga DVD that I still love the most is ""Stress Relief Yoga"" by Suzanne Deason.  Note that real yoga guru types disparage the DVD I recommend because it doesn't hold poses long enough, it moves too fast, etc...  But for my purposes at this stage of my life, that DVD really does it for me.

This DVD, however, will have to wait until I am at a different point in my life.  From my perspective, this DVD is a 3.  Beautiful and inspirational but I just don't want to do it.  However, if you already practice yoga, I bet this DVD would be a 5.",1210809600,,1455,4.2700729927007295
3363964,4,B0014CSNDY,"I agree with others who argue that this isn't for beginners. While it might be considered beginning material for a yoga veteran, it would take a newbie several passes through the four sessions to grasp how the movements are performed. Even then a raw beginner might have problems since there is little explanation as to the nuances and elements of each posture.

I'm in good shape: weight training, martial arts for four decades, and occasionally yoga. While I didn't find the poses particularly difficult, I did have trouble keeping up from time to time because the changes were so quick and done without a how-to-do explanation.

Now, if you have practiced yoga in the past but have been away from it for awhile, this would be a good DVD to get you back into the groove. You could begin with one session a day, progress to two a day and continue until you're doing all four in one day for a good, relatively easy yoga workout.",1210636800,,928,4.5843373493975905
3363965,5,B0014CSNDY,"The best way to know if your yoga class/dvd is good is to ask yourself a question:
  - Do you feel relaxed and calm after the yoga class ?
  - Does your body feel light and breath fuild and calm after the class ?

This Yoga DVD does both of these and they compound each day with every practise.

Even though I do not have a very flexible body, I never felt that I am being too pressurized and hard to do yoga poses in this DVD - it was smooth, flowing and almost effortless.  Depending on your age and body condition, you may feel varying difficulties, but neverthless it is a beginners program and a very good way to start your yoga practise.

The other Yoga DVD which I have been following before I got into Shiva Rea is Bryan Kest's Power Yoga series, in which I have just been doing the video 1 (Beginner's series) - there are both +ves and -ves when I compare these DVDs
  - In comparison to Shiva Rea, I find Bryan's narration to be more information and more helpful - he makes certain  basics of yoga very clear such as (1) Make breath your priority, breath is the priority and the asans come after (2) Do not push or jam yourself into doing a pose and make yourself uncomfortable, if you are feeling uncomofortable, you are defeating the very purpose of doing yoga .... and may other such small tips and general overview of the basics which are very important for a beginner.  But Bryan kests poses are a bit more difficult to do.

Shiva Rea makes the yoga poses very easy and doable effortlessly.

Overall, if you are new to yoga, try Shiva Rea Yoga first and then you can move to Bryan kest's yoga series.",1210636800,,1615,4.269736842105263
3363966,5,B0014CSNDY,"While the DVD is advertised for beginners, I recommend a working knowledge of yoga to get the full benefit. The ""for beginners"" part obviously refers to vinyasa yoga. I am a semi-regular yoga practitioner, but I had no idea some of these poses, such as the backbends and lunges, could increase flexibility.

Shiva Rea is an excellent teacher and the backdrop scenery of Kauai is simply stunning. (Depending on who you talk to, Hawai'i is one of the healthiest states in the U.S.). I give her high praise for using the real names of the asanas (pronounced AHS-annas). I also like the way she calls Child's Pose the Wisdom Pose. ""No pain, no gain"" doesn't apply to pushing your body beyond its tolerance. The whole point of most yoga practice is to make you aware of your breath so you can achieve greater consciousness in meditation, which you can't do if you're constantly obsessing about how 73 minutes seems like an eternity with your aching back/hip/shoulders. The great thing about the DVD is that you can perform the routines in chapters, so you can work at your own pace. And remember to rest in wisdom pose if you need to! There's a marvelous relaxation sequence at the end.

I plan to make this DVD part of my fitness practice. The music and the rhythm is soothing and the exercises, true to the name of the yoga specialty, flow.",1210550400,2,1337,4.61344537815126
3363967,3,B0014CSNDY,"I have never done anything Yoga related in my life, so I decided to give it a try.  I am an avid road and mountain biker and I also lift weights several times a week and I was looking to try to add some flexibility and relaxation into my routine.

My initial thought after reading the outside of the box when it showed up was that 70 minutes of Yoga is way too much to do at one time!  It turns out that it is actually broken up into 5 different sections that can be watched all together or you can skip with scene selections to whichever one you want to do, so that was a nice feature.  The scenery was pretty nice, I don't really like the music all that much, and I really couldn't get into the whole yoga part.  I'm sure if I had some previous experience, this would be a little easier, but some of these moves and positions are a little beyond ""beginners"" in my mind despite the title.  So, if you are already into yoga and are looking for something new, this might work out for you, but if you have never done it before and want something with a lot of instruction, then there must be some better choices out there.",1210464000,,1120,4.114678899082569
3363968,3,B0014CSNDY,"Shiva Rea's Flow Yoga for Beginners is meant to be an introduction to this form of yoga. The DVD has several menu options including an Introduction which explains Flow Yoga and the essence of the program; play the entire workout; a chapter index; a biography of Shiva Rea; and music options (you can choose to just have music or have music and instructions). The chapter index also has several options: Foundation Flow; Beginner's Backward Flow; Beginner's Flexibility Flow; Shavagena; and the closing credits.

While it is labeled ""beginners"" and the box to the DVD says no yoga experience is necessary, this is a tough workout and I wouldn't recommend it for newcomers to yoga. It starts off slowly enough with a seated meditation that is meant to teach you how to link breath with movement, although it never really helped me get into the zone. After a few easy minutes, the yoga quickly became more difficult, although there are plenty of rest breaks built into the routine. Shiva Rea doesn't always explain what to do next, instead she just goes into the next move, which is frustrating for a beginner like me. It also broke the flow of yoga for me, as I constantly had to focus on the TV to see what she was doing instead of concentrating on the yoga. The DVD was filmed in Hawaii, a beautiful setting, but the camera sometimes focused too much on the scenery instead of the yoga. I also had a hard time positioning the yoga mat in order to see the TV, which made doing the yoga awkward.

While the yoga seemed to be good, it was not for beginners as advertised and you need to be quite flexible to do it. I'm not very flexible and I was very sore afterwards.",1210464000,,1665,4.528239202657807
3363969,4,B0014CSNDY,"This is 70 minute DVD of Flow yoga (vinysa) demonstrated by yoga master Shiva Rea.
Vinyasa is a simple form of asana that is easy to follow and no prior yoga experience is necessary. This is a variant of Surya Namaskara (Sun salutation), which is defined by a series of six specific postures with a breathing pattern. The narrator guides the viewers with instructions to practice the yoga postures, which is helpful for a beginner. The esoteric intention of vinysa is to facilitate the flow of prana (vital energy) to balance the koshs (sheaths) of the physical and metaphysical body. In a less esoteric language, the body heat increases circulation, contribute to muscle flexibility and strengthen the tissue and tendons. The last few minutes of the DVD is dedicated to Shavasana or Sarvasana that is performed to either begin or conclude a yoga session. It is a relaxing posture intended to rejuvenate the body, mind and spirit.

The background music is set the drum beats of Hawaiian music; the producers could have considered using Hindustani classical music, especially instrumental music such as, sitar or violin using a morning or an evening raga as appropriate.

3363970,2,B0014CSNDY,"Don't waste your time and money on this 70 minute non-flowing ""workout.""

""For Beginners,"" when applied to a workout means it's either for people with no prior experience or it's for people with a lower level of physical ability(my category).  This workout doesn't fit either description.  It moves slowly--which is often a pretense for a beginning level workout--but it goes nowhere.  You'll be saying, ""Are we there yet?"" but you'll never arrive.

Because I am not physically strong but still like to work out, I buy a lot of beginner workouts.  Usually there is something to enjoy in all of them, but I found this one annoying.

You must be very, very strong in your arms and legs.  Shiva Rea holds plank or other strenth-based poses for a long time.  She has you pulse in some poses which actually reduces flexibility rather than increasing it.  She has you twist in lunge and chair pose--unsupported--in order to warm up the spine for backbends.  Hello, if you want to warm up the spine with twists why not sit down?  I wasn't getting a warm-up while my thighs were burning and my balance was challenged.  It would be OK as a standing pose, but don't call it a warm-up and maybe don't hold it quite so long.

Shiva Rea uses a lot of yoga terminology and there are no captions showing you the names or their English translations, so if you don't already know the names of the poses, you may never figure them out.

Shiva Rea talks very slowly; it's hard to keep paying attention to her and keep focused.  The workout goes slowly.  I couldn't stay interested or enjoy it.

And for those who care about such things, could she have worn modest shirts?  They were fine while she was standing up, but we spend forever doing plank pose or forward bending poses and the shots were often focused head-on.  Puh-lease, that's NOT what I want to be looking at when I do yoga; shots like that don't show me what the pose looks like.  I have a number of yoga videos that are much less offensive, so I know you don't have to wear stuff like that.",1210118400,19,2036,4.493188010899183

8255127,3,B0014CSNDY,"If you are a beginner you will have wasted your money if you buy this DVD. There are some very difficult poses that will stop your flow often. Shiva Rea is obviously an excellent yoga instructor but she has done yoga so long that she doesn't know what a ""beginner"" is NOT capable of doing.  It's a good DVD for an ""almost intermediate"" though.  I think that the production company that shot the video was more interested in video aesthetics and artsy shots than Shiva Rea's yoga instruction.  There is not enough alternate pose instruction for beginners in any of the sessions that should be there for the beginner.  Her voice is soft and monotone as if it is a meditation so is hard to hear her words in most of the sessions, but,  in the first session, Foundation Flow, the drum beat music with the waterfall is so loud and annoying that you can barely hear her pose instructions at all and a beginner needs to hear this.  Besides, drum beat music isn't very yoga-ish and didn't really fit the session.  The second session ""Beginner's Backbend Flow"" is in my opinion impossible for a beginner.  A semi-backbend, really?  With no alternate pose for the beginner? You could really hurt yourself even trying the poses she does here. The third session,  Flexibility Flow is good although again, she should spend more time in a beginner video giving you beginner alternate poses until you can do more.  The 4th session is Beginner's Standing Pose Flow, and is easily doable for a beginner but they were so fascinated by shooting this one in the sunset that you can barely make out her moves in the dark, even after they put a small spotlight on her.  It's so hard to see her and the poses she is doing.  She should at least have been wearing light colored yoga pants (like the top) so we could see her lower body moves in the dark.  Then finally there was Shavasana.  Sure that one is easy and had beautiful music...until she says ""stay here as long as you need"",  then immediately the beautiful music stops and fast, loud, heavy drumming starts up while the credits run.  They could've run credits while the good soft music was still playing so you could spend a few minutes more in quiet shavasana.  That would've helped.  All in all I give it a 3 at best and that's only if you have had basic yoga for 6 months to a year already.  p.s. I'm not sure if it is my system or this DVD but I had to turn the TV volume up almost to maximum to hear her talk on the entire video (and remember to turn it back down before stopping the DVD).
