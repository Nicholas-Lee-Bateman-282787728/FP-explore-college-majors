2625665,4,B000H1RFHI,"I just bought this DVD and I think it is a fun workout.  I found it pretty easy to follow and I also like the variety of the 3 different sections (latin grooves, kickboxing, sweatshop).  I also appreciate the fact that they have some ""normal"" size people in the video.  The only negative comment I have is the latin grooves section is not as challenging as the other 2 sections.",1169337600,7,378,4.371428571428571
2625666,3,B000H1RFHI,"I've come to realise that Crunch dvds vary from excellent to average.  They aren't consistant at all.  This workout is average at best.  It's fun in parts but it's not challenging and it's not intense enough if you want a true fat burning workout.  I am totally surprised that the instructor (Lizbeth Garcia) doesn't move a lot.  She and the other exercisers don't use a lot of space and maximise the workout potential.  When they do knee lifts in the boxing segment, they barely lift their leg.  It's certainly not the best Crunch workout out there, although for beginners, this might be perfect.  It's alright for the days where you feel like taking it very easy.  (I also would have thought that a crunch workout dvd done in 2006 would use a new set instead of the same tired set they've used since forever).",1169337600,4,811,4.576388888888889
2625667,4,B000H1RFHI,"I just bought this dvd  recently, it is a really good dvd. It gives you a lot of variety. i especially like the kick boxing part. i ve been doing cardio kickboxing for a while. it's my fave type of workout. i realy wish they had a crunch gym by me ,but the colest one is all the way in NYC. it's good they put the acutal classes on dvd for people who can't go to the gym. I also reccomend Crunch : cardio dance blast and Crunch : Cardio salsa.  if u like dance and want a good workout too ,these are the best.",1168992000,4,509,3.8380952380952382
2625668,3,B000H1RFHI,"This is a fun workout; I was smiling as I was trying it out for the first time. That said, this is not a very challenging video at all. It's great for beginners and for intermediate exercisers who want an easy day, but if you can run a ten minute mile, you will find this video pretty easy to do. I barely broke a sweat, but it DID get my heart rate up somewhat, and I felt like I did something, although it didn't feel like much.

Again, fun workout, especially for the lazy days, or just for the sake of variety.",1168905600,4,514,4.03921568627451
2625669,4,B000H1RFHI,"I enjoy this workout and it definitely gets my heartrate going!  I don't really enjoy the latin section though.  Honestly, it didn't challenge me as much physically as the other sections did and, admittedly I am not the world's most coordinated person, but I couldn't really follow it.  If you were a better dancer I think that you may enjoy it but for me it was just frustrating.  The way the video is set up is that the ab section is after the cool down.  I just do the abs either before my workout or right before the cooldown, because by the time I do the cooldown I just want to be done.  I started exercising again with this video and the cooldown/stretching is very short but when I do it I am never uncomfortably sore the next day so it is very worth it.  I have a really weak upper body so I felt the workout in my arms and shoulders but for more of a challenge you could add some light hand weights and really increase the intensity level.  The instructor is upbeat and positive without being over the top, and I really like how she will tell you what is coming up next since it makes it go by so much faster for me.  Also, she does 60 second power bursts at the end of the sections that will really get your heart rate up.  Overall, it is a solid workout that you could easily divide into smaller segments if you were pressed for time and is enjoyable to do.",1166832000,10,1369,4.171102661596958
2625670,3,B000H1RFHI,"It's an okay DVD.  It was not what I expected.  If you want a low key workout, this is it",1341360000,,89,3.4
2625671,4,B000H1RFHI,"I found it to be a pretty good workout. It's broken up into 3 sections with a ""power move"" in each section. The first is a dance section. I cannot dance but I found the moves easy to follow after the second workout. The 2nd section is kickboxing which I was highly disappointed with. I've done kickboxing workouts off and on for years. This was not it. Mainly it was bob and weaves ans shuffles with some kicks and a knee strike that involved you leg and knee barely coming off the ground. Section 3 was my favorite and to me the toughest. It was cardio basic aerobics. But it was done at a fast clip and I felt a good burn by the end. There's. A really nice warm up but I would have liked a longer cool down. I just did my own stretches after the cool down was over. Overall I would recommend this Dvd to beginners that are ready to try something a little harder.",1337731200,,864,4.118343195266272
2625672,4,B000H1RFHI,"I'm just getting back into aerobic workouts after many years ... so I'm renting/borrowing a lot of different DVDs to figure out where my older bod is at ... this one made me smile.  It reminded me of classes I took back in the 90's ... basic and adjustable.  I wasn't left huffing and puffing, but my heart rate did get up.  Some of the sequences could be easily adapted to a step box to add intensity, which I might try in a few more weeks.  There is a nice variety, never staying too long on any one thing.  The pace was good for me, and a more fit person could do a high knee lift/lower lunge for more intensity.  At least, that's what I'm thinking for myself as I ""make my comeback.""  I don't think the abdominal section is anything special, but what can I say, it's abs ... bleah ...

But the very best thing about this DVD is the fantastic cueing.  The instructor explained new moves concisely and it was easy for me to stay with the sequences.  Even when I got off, I knew where I needed to be -- it was just my older, less coodinated bod that got off step, not the instructor.  Best cueing of the workouts I've seen so far.",1305676800,,1131,4.1422018348623855
2625673,3,B000H1RFHI,"Having enjoyed a lot of Crunch fitness DVDs, I was very hopeful that I would enjoy this one, as well.  Unfortunately the fitness moves used were so extremely basic, boring, and low impact that I found myself eagerly anticipating the end of the routine.

The instructor, Lizbeth Garcia, was a good instructor.  She would often preview what she wanted the viewer to do so that there would be no confusion, and she was pleasantly motivatng.  She starts out with a good warm up, teaching mambos, squats, and V-steps before finishing the warm up with some stretching.  After the warm up, the workout is divided into 6 sections:

Latin Dance 1 - This is very, very basic dancing with some easy mambos and triple steps.  My heart rate did not get up much at all, and I was very bored since just 2-3 steps were taught.

Latin Dance 2 - This added 1-2 more moves onto the first moves that you learned, creating a short dance routine.  It was just more mambos and triple steps, which did not get my heart rate up any more, nor did it make me have any more fun.  At the end of this section you do your first ""cardio burst"" which is 60 seconds of one move that is supposed to really burn fat.  It was simply a lunge and triple step that finally got my heart rate up.

Thai Boxing 1 - My heart rate quickly went down again as I started this section which only taught a bob and weave, a heel tap, and a knee thrust.

Thai Boxing 2 - You finally start to box in this section as you learn an uppercut, a hook punch, and a boxer's shuffle.  This got my heart rate up, and my heart rate stayed up through the cardio burst, which were some knee thrusts and runs.

Sweatshop 1 - My heart rate continued to remain high into this section where the grapevine, hamstring curls, and V-step were introduced.

Sweatshop 2 - Then, like the Latin Dance section, more moves were added onto the first moves, making this like a routine.  Lunges, kicks, and step touches were the moves that were added before finishing the cardio workout with the last power burst, which was made up of skates and step touches.

After the workout, you finish off with a cool-down and ab workout.  I really liked the cool-down; I found it to be sufficient with some back and leg stretches.  I would have enjoyed some arm stretches thrown in there, though.  The ab workout was on a mat and consisted of basic crunches that didn't work me out too much.  After the crunches, you do more stretching on the mat.

Overall, it was a decent workout for beginners, but if you are experienced with fitness at all, give this one a pass.",1292976000,,2574,4.361344537815126
2625674,4,B000H1RFHI,"I enjoyed this workout even though it doesn't have the ""BURN"" factor I was hoping for. The first couple of times through it was somewhat challenging, but after that it just became my hour of easy working out. Its the kind of workout that when I don't know what to do or I'm maybe a little sore from weight training it fits the bill.

I wear a heart rate monitor for every workout and that's how I tend to gauge my cardio DVD's intensity. After learning this DVD I can easily get through it with my heart rate averaging 145-150bpm. The warm up is very basic, but easy to navigate through. The Latin section is placed perfectly in this DVD as others have mentioned its very easy to do and doesn't overwork you in the beginning. By the end of it you'll be breaking a sweat, but by no means out of breath. The Kickboxing is not as much Kickboxing as I expected, more in the way of bob & weave's and some squats. I would have liked more arm work here. The Sweatshop section reminds me of some old school aerobics, easy to follow and kind of catchy after a few times through. Pretty quick ab segment, but for beginners or intermediate exercisers this it a must finish. I would say that the majority of people looking for a fun workout will find this DVD to their liking. The instructor is easy to follow and not overly peppy which can sometimes drive me nuts especially those early morning workouts :)If the price is right add this one to your collection!
Enjoy...",1254787200,,1458,4.360294117647059
2625675,3,B000H1RFHI,"The workout on this DVD looks very challenging, but the instructor is very obnoxious.  I didn't even finish the workout because the instructor is so annoying.",1234828800,,158,5.076923076923077
2625676,4,B000H1RFHI,"Crunch fitness videos are my favorites.  Well, its really a tie between these and ANYTHING Tamilee Webb puts out on video.  But this workout keeps you moving, but never gets boring.  I LOVE dance and the cardio PLUS the latin flair the instructor adds to it gets you through the work out and wanting to do it again.  I tested it out with my 18 year old daughter and she loved it too!  It was a lot of fun to do together. B+",1234483200,,423,4.048192771084337
2625677,4,B000H1RFHI,"I like the varied styles in this workout dvd.  She starts out with some latin style dancing, one of my favorite.  Then, its on to kickboxing which is another fav of mine. I especially love her moves on this section because they aren't comprised of difficult moves.  Finally, she does some classic cardio which I remember doing back in the eighties.  She does some grapevines and kickbacks among others that bring back memories.  I would recommend this one to anyone who wants a varied and fun workout.",1230681600,,501,4.712643678160919
2625678,1,B000H1RFHI,"I did this work out once, that was plenty. I was not at all impressed by it. The only thing I actually enjoyed were the power bursts. The rest is fine if you're just starting out. I've been working out for ten years. I like a work out that challenges me and this one didn't even come close.",1211846400,,290,4.017241379310345
2625679,4,B000H1RFHI,"I LOVE Crunch DVDs.  This one is one of my favorites too.
I do many forms of workouts (I am a plus sized FIT woman), including mountain biking, Tae-Bo, and hardcore hiking/bushwacking (lol).  I find that this video gets my heart rate up, and is a fun way to burn some calories.
I haven't worked out in quite a long time, so I put this video in because I knew it would be a great way to get back into the swing of things.
I highly recommend this video for beginners of all shapes and sizes.
I also enjoyed Lizbeth's instruction.  I have yet to see a Crunch instructor I don't like (Ellen Barrett being my favorite).
Definitely worth the money.",1208476800,,642,4.289256198347108
2625680,4,B000H1RFHI,"I own several Crunch Fitness DVD's and this one kinda mimics all of the others that I own. It puts all these moves I already know into this DVD. It still gets me sweating but it's not one that I grab first!
Overall, it's a good workout DVD but it's just not one of my favorites.",1203033600,,278,3.982142857142857
2625681,4,B000H1RFHI,I use this DVD for light days (I am high intermediate/low advanced level).  The cardio routines are fun and the one minute blasts do get my heart rate up nicely.  Lizbeth is not grating or irritating to me and suprisingly most of the background exercisers are tolerable (Crunch background exercisers can be very annoying).,1184889600,,322,4.944444444444445
2625682,4,B000H1RFHI,"Lizbeth Garcia (the instructor) is great because she does a move several time before she includes it. It is a 30 minute cardio with a good warmup and cool down.  Even if I don't do the full routine I still get good results except for the arm work which isn't challenging at all. I like the variety and I haven't got bored.  I have lost 20lbs since 01/07. There is a lady in the video that is so thin that you can easily see her ribs.  If the camera adds weight then this poor woman must be in bad shape.  I emailed the production crew and didn't get much of a response.  Other then this, I highly recommend it!",1183507200,,610,4.092436974789916
2625683,4,B000H1RFHI,"This video is broken down as follows: Warm up, Latin Groove 1 & 2 (with 1-minute PowerBurst), Cardio Thai Box 1 & 2 (with 1-minute PowerBurst), Sweatshop 1 & 2 (with 1-minute PowerBurst), Cooldown, and 5-minute Abs.  The routines increase in difficulty per section.

I started this video as I was getting back into the swing of cardio excerise.  I think it is a good starting point, but it gets easy fairly quickly if you do it several times a week (which I did).  I'd rate her as fair when it comes to leading.  She does break down the moves alot which helps.  Some people mentioned the routines are difficult, but it just takes some practice, then you recognize the patterns and it becomes much easier.

I like the Sweatshop section the best since it is the most challenging.  I think the routine is fun, and she is a fun instructor.  To increase the level of difficulty, I add ankle weights.  That makes it more fun and challenging!",1176940800,3,935,4.511904761904762
2625684,4,B000H1RFHI,The workout is easy to follow.  As a mother of two just getting back into the routine of working out. This workout is great.  The instructor is good with her cues and the set up of the workout is tollerabe (no annoying music or voices).  I'm able to stay within my target heart rate from beginning to end.  The fat blasting 1 minute workouts and mix of the workouts keep it interesting.,1175644800,4,386,4.319444444444445
2625685,1,B000H1RFHI,"This video is awful. Unless you are a complete beginner, you will not get anything out of this. Her routines are lame. The aerobics section isn't bad but the steps are more complicated then necessary. The dance portion is not fun and the thai boxing is in no way thai boxing. I don't like Lizabeth either. She doesn't hold a candle to the other Crunch instructors. The only good thing is the 1 min intense sections and really only the first one burns.",1174608000,5,451,4.445783132530121
2625686,2,B000H1RFHI,"I thought this workout would be very high intensity and I thought I would be challanged. I was also expecting a great varity of moves. I work out everyday, and I hardly broke a sweat.  If you are an advanced exerciser, you will be disappointed. The only time I was challanged was during the ""Power"" section, which is for a minute after every section (there are three (3) sections). This is a good DVD if you're looking for a low impact workout, that is not too intense. If you want a ""kick-butt"" workout, this is not it.

The instructor, Lizbeth Garcia, is nice enough, and I recognized several of the background people from other Crunch DVD's. This DVD does not measure up to the standard of Crunch.",1173312000,13,700,4.503937007874016
2625687,2,B000H1RFHI,"I was very diappointed with this tape. There's no way the average person with no previous latin dance or kickboxing experience can follow these moves. There isn't even any instuction prior to beginning the workout, and everyone on screen is facing the camera, which makes it even more difficult to follow.",1171929600,4,305,5.0
2625688,3,B000H1RFHI,"From the description, I thought the workout would be a bit more high intensity.  It's a good 30 minute routine, which I also thought was going to be longer.

2625689,4,B000H1RFHI,"It gets your heart pumping a bit more then other Crunch workouts (which is good). Its 45 minutes long and includes a salsa/dance, cardio kick, and ab workout sections.  Its fun and gives a great workout as well",1169769600,4,210,4.526315789473684

I chose to switch from my usual CRUNCH Cardio Salsa workout to CRUNCH Fat Burning Blast after having my fourth baby. I love how Lizbeth and her team explain the movements thoroughly and make it so much fun to follow! My abs, thighs, arms and butt have really felt this workout!

It's broken into three sections:
  Section one- Salsa
  Section two- kick boxing
  Section three- sweat shop

They area all fun and invigorating! However, my favorite is the kick boxing as it is a challenge and I feel I get the most out of that section. I hope they release a CRUNCH kick boxing video on Amazon Instant Video soon!!",1364083200,,726,4.446969696969697
