3789154,4,B001TE6PH8,"I'm a sucker for a good romance. I loved these movies. There are 4 on two discs (two are on the reverse side). They were good...exactly what I was expecting. There are a few love scenes that show nudity and are a little more intense then what you may see in a normal R rated love scene. These scenes are in a Matter for Marriage and Hard to Forget. One thing that kind of bugged me was that the cover pics of the women (except for Paula Abdul-who wasn't the main heroine in the movie) are all of different people then the ones that star in the film. Couldn't quite figure out why that is...but at least for the first movie I found myself waiting for the woman on the cover photo to appear for a while. The movies have the ""Harlequin"" elements in them. If you like those you should like these. ;o)",1340496000,7,796,4.175324675324675
3789155,5,B001TE6PH8,Enjoyed the storyline but was a little surprised with the nudity.  Guess I should get my glasses on and read the fine print.,1332115200,,124,4.391304347826087
3789156,4,B001TE6PH8,"I was expecting sex, lies, infidelity and maybe a little murder on the side... but, I wasn't expecting nudity!  One of the movies shows a couple in a glass shower showing only their naked backsides.  ""Hard to Forget"" shows total, front, top female nudity.  I didn't see anywhere on the movie descriptions or on the dvd box showing a rating.  This is a heads-up if you're planning to watch this program with a child in the room.

Typical lifetime-like movies.... enjoyable, mindless entertainment.

Update (April 10, 2011):  I had overlooked the ratings found on the dvd box.  They are as followings:

""The Waiting Game"" Not Rated - Adult Situations, Violence, Profanity (91 minutes)

""Hard to Forget"" - Not Rated - Violence, Profanity, Adult Situations, Nudity (95 minutes)

""Recipe for Revenge"" - Not Rated - Adult Situations, Violence, Profanity (92 minutes)

""This Matter of Marriage"" - Not Rated - Adult Situations, Violence, Nudity (95 minutes)",1302220800,10,949,5.090909090909091
