3963600,5,B002P3NH6E,"Great DVD for technique and the intangibles it takes to make that leap from Blue to Purple.

You think you're the man when you get that blue belt, but the difference between blue and purple competitors is vast.  This DVD will keep you on the path and give you a gameplan to help you understand how to reach that next level.

Awesome instruction and great quality DVD.",1312156800,,367,4.447761194029851
3963601,5,B002P3NH6E,"I'm a big fan of Roy Dean's DVD and I have all of them.  They are very well produced and unlike some of the other DVDs, Roy communicates his points very well.  As a beginner in BJJ, this DVD series is perfect.  I go to class, my head spins because I can't remember anything.  There is so much thrown at you.  I'd go home and review the moves at my own pace and that process has been tremendously helpful.  I trained with a Machado black belt, and the techniques are near identical, which is a big plus.  After 8 months of BJJ, I still find the DVD very helpful in reminding myself of the fundamentals.  I still learn from the DVD every time I watch it.  A great series that I can recommend without any hesitation.",1284163200,5,713,4.1838235294117645
3963602,5,B002P3NH6E,"Roy Dean's way of teaching is outstanding, clearly illustrating moves with ease. I had his blue belt DVD, and as expected, I'm impressed again with this one!

I'm looking forward to the brown belt requirements while I train with this DVD, clearly a great buy!",1279152000,,259,4.7555555555555555
3963603,5,B002P3NH6E,"I've amassed a large library of martial arts books and video materials over the years. In ""Purple Belt Requirements"" Roy Dean continues his description of the BJJ journey relating his own experiences. He demonstrates the importance of being able to link techniques to advance your BJJ game, and most importantly the mental aspect of ""What makes a purple belt"". The techniques and philosophies in this dvd is helping me on my own path to purple belt in my bjj school. This is definitely a great addition to my personal martial arts library, and I look forward to the upcoming ""No-Gi"" dvd that's coming out.",1268870400,,605,4.826923076923077
3963604,5,B002P3NH6E,"Roy Dean is very elegant, focuses on the point, this dvd is very helpful for people who wanna concentrate on practicing in their academy and moving up towards the next belt. Really basic but smooth transitions into becoming advanced, plus he throws some words of wisdom in there. very good and very good dvd quality/. i was impressed. chao, BARRO. COMBATE Fight Club.

3963605,4,B002P3NH6E,"I bought his Blue belt requirements and found it very informative and with the detail I wanted.
I bought the Purple belt expecting the same...and WASN'T Disappointed.
Not a lot of techniques...more a focus on variations and approaches...I like his ananlogy that at BLUE BELT you have a Learned a lot of WORDS...NOW at PURPLE BELT its TIME TO start making SENTENCES. I would have given it a 5 if there was more techniques but if you can walk away with the concepts then your game will surely improve.

Keep rolling",1265587200,10,513,4.637362637362638

8376594,5,B002P3NH6E,Great Price. Quick Shipping. I loved the instructional. Well worth the money. I'd buy from here again.,1425600000,,102,5.0588235294117645
8376595,5,B002P3NH6E,"Again Mr. Dean has put together another GREAT video. His video's are the right info at the right time. If your honest with your self you'll know your skill level and can use these video's well. This PPL blt vid is very well laid out. A good amount of techs but more importantly how's and why's and what we should be working on at this level. Being I have the Blue, Purple, and Brown Belt video and I know the info on the bl-ppl vids is perfect for me and the info in the Brown Blt vid is cool it is above my skill level at this time. But it gives me an idea on what to be looking for as my knowledge improves.",1399248000,3,609,3.9193548387096775
8376596,3,B002P3NH6E,"On the positive side: Roy Dean gives clear instruction and shows multiple angles for the techniques. He gives you the big picture about what is important and why at this level, before providing the techniques. His overall theme is: Discover Who You Are, which was cool. And he comes across as a very good teacher.

The first DVD has the techniques on it and is segmented well.  This DVD has approx 75 minutes of actual techniques, which are very good. The second DVD really doesn't focus on showing new/additional techniques. Instead, he has rolling examples, some seminar/competitions and some demos. These are nice, but not particularly instructional and a little self-serving.
.
For the money, I was somewhat disappointed in the limited number of techniques. These DVDs seem more like a Purple Belt Belt Framework than anything else. Just letting buyers know what to expect.",1397433600,6,877,5.041379310344827
8376597,3,B002P3NH6E,"Good overall instructional video. More of a conceptual outlook on jiu jitsu and the purple belt level in general.
Informative and helpfull and overall a high quality video
Unfortunately i do feel the price is very high for what you actually recieve.  After watching the dvds twice i could not help but feel there was very little actual worthwhile content.
I would tell someone considering buying this product that it is worth a look but its not the best product out there.",1396396800,5,472,4.7560975609756095
8376598,5,B002P3NH6E,Roy Dean explain really well...a lot of information and techniques in this DVD..and the quality is very good...if you are a blue belt this is a good dvd to have...!!!,1364860800,,166,4.566666666666666
8376599,5,B002P3NH6E,If you are learning Japanese or brazilian Jiu Jitsu you definitely want to get this dvd.  Instruction video quality is excellent.  If you don't have a training partner you should get a grappling dummy.,1358121600,,201,4.882352941176471
8376600,5,B002P3NH6E,Roy Dean has done it once again.  I think his work is great and highly endorse it. I cannot wait for other products to hit the market.,1349654400,,134,3.962962962962963
8376601,5,B002P3NH6E,"Roy as always, does a great job of ""teaching"" BJJ, not just ""telling"" you BJJ.  There are a lot of additional (realistic and doable) techniques offered in the video that are useful against advanced opponents.  And as always, Roy offers invaluable insight and strategies to incorporate into your game.  And if you're familiar with his videos, he provides very good detail on how to perform a move (and in good, clear American English:). If you have the blue belt DVD, understand that this video won't be as robust in terms of techniques and information, since the blue belt DVD was providing a wider foundation of knowledge for BJJ beginners.  However, for $45, this DVD is easily worth the cost and is worth the equivalent of many private lessons with a good BJJ black belt instructor.",1331164800,4,785,4.792592592592593
8376602,5,B002P3NH6E,"Thanks Mr. Dean for making such a great dvd.

It is exactly what I needed to progess in my training. Moving from single moves to 2-3 move combinations is the key to progression.

Watching just the intro several times, I was ble to start to connect positions and submissions together that I never really thought possible.

Thank you from a lower-level blue belt.",1328400000,2,361,4.698412698412699
