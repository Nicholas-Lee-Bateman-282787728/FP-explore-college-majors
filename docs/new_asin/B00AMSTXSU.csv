5453892,5,B00AMSTXSU,"Love the suspense and story lines of both of these movies.  Great acting by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman in All the President's men.  Also great recap of the Watergate scandal as far as a movie goes.
Three Days of the Condor is a suspensful and great movie starring Robert Redford.  I have always enjoyed this movie even tho it took me 3 times watching it years ago to understand it.  I love all of these CIA type of movies.",1376524800,6,429,4.325
5453893,5,B00AMSTXSU,"These are two incredible films whose subject matter is as current today as it was when they were both made decades ago.  Loved them then, love them even more now!",1372550400,,162,4.4
5453894,5,B00AMSTXSU,"There was a great deal of political paranoia to be found in the cinema of the 1970's. To films in particular epitomize that era. Alan J. Pakula's ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and Sydney Pollack's THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR are two films in particular that capture and preserve that moment in time. Robert Redford stars in both films and his approach to both characters in each film seems initially like one of indifference with a dash of naivet, but once drawn in he becomes very self reliant. Dustin Hoffman's character in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is more seasoned and cynical and welcomes the confrontation and must bring it to fruition. THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR is a complex suspenseful political thriller directed by Sydney Pollack. A shroud of relentless paranoia permeates the entire film from beginning to end. It is set primarily in New York City and Washington DC and this adds to the drama in a very credible way. Robert Redford is a CIA research reader. He reads books and all forms of written material essentially looking for ideas that his branch may find useful. He reads everything and reports anything pertinent with his team he is stationed with. Things go very wrong and he soon finds that he is a man on the run and he is a target. Why? That is what he has to find out and turn his situation around if he can. Besides Robert Redford, the cast includes Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson, John Houseman, Patrick Gorman and Max von Sydow. Redford's character is full of energy and once he directs that energy for his very survival, he becomes a very formidable player in the world of covert affairs. Interestingly, Max von Sydow has such a subtle yet incredibly powerful screen presence.  On screen he effortlessly puts Robert Redford's energy and daring aside with such ease that you will be amazed. Max von Sydow's performance is brilliant and he steals every frame of this film that he is in. And on another note, Sydney Pollack once more proves he was on of the cinema's best directors. ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is a very compelling movie. From a historical perspective it is still as fresh as this morning's headlines. I prefer historical films where there is some measure of morality of the participants of events of note to the American experience, and that is sure to be found in this film. At times this seems more like a film with some political message and agenda, but in reality it is simply a tale of unraveling the truth. Ironically, I do not find a strong sense of right or wrong concerning the motives of the main characters. For them, getting the story at anyone cost seems to be their objective, their motivation. The very story they wish to prove and propagate is very political, but still it is about reporting the truth. Hoffman's performance is riveting and believable. Redford is subtle and somewhat humorously stoic. Hoffman and Redford make an incredible team, visually and in every other respect. The direction, cinematography and editing are flawless. Overall, this film genre that was so prevalent in 1970s opened the door both cinematically and in the real political arena for citizens to ask the tough questions of their elected and appointed officials. But, once those questions are answered, doubt still remains it always will. Modern thinking will never return to what it was before the decade of the 1970s partly in thanks to THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.",1369872000,9,3416,4.760539629005059

5453967,4,B00AMSTXSU,"In 'All the President's Men' two newspaper reporters are on the trail of information that the President of the United States knows about a break in to locate information.

'Three Days of the Condor' is about a CIA employee who reads information. He passes information on to his boss. He goes out to lunch and his office is shot to pieces. He aspires to locate safety and that goes badly so he car jacks a woman and goes '50 Shades of Grey' on her. It too ponders the roll and behavior of government.",1464998400,,499,4.365591397849462

5454077,5,B00AMSTXSU,"""3 Days Of The Condor"" is why I purchased this DVD. Robert Redford in one of his strongest performances, on the run with Faye Dunaway, in a conspiracy thriller set at Christmastime in New York & Washington.  The late-Cliff Robertson, and, Max Von Sydow, add to the most important parts of the scenario. Pulse pounding action, and one of the greatest ""you can't trust anybody"" thrillers ever filmed.  I watched this again just the other night, and it's as exciting today as it was when I first saw it at the Esquire Theatre in St. Louis in 1975 !

""All The President's Men""...excellent in all respects !",1421107200,,602,4.607476635514018

5454084,5,B00AMSTXSU,"This double DVD was a real find! I was looking for a copy of THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, and I found this package. I hadn't watched either film since I first saw them in theaters in 1975 and '76, and they both hold up beautifully.

ATPM is just about the best film I've ever seen about working journalists--along with HIS GIRL FRIDAY, of course. But this story happens to be true. And horrifying. I lived through the actual events, and Alan J. Pakula and his screenwriter, William Goldman (who won an Oscar for this), really caught the mood of the country at that time. Redford and Hoffman are superb, and the supporting cast is wonderful.

TDOTC is a terrific suspense thriller about a CIA employee who suddenly finds himself ""out in the cold,"" with Redford once again in top form as the terrified hero. It's based on James Grady's excellent novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Days-of-the-Condor/dp/B0064T4ZPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Days of the Condor</a>, with the nonstop action made even more immediate by the subtraction of three days from the original story. Cliff Robertson, Faye Dunaway, and especially Max Von Sydow are perfect in their parts. Sidney Pollack directed several of my favorite films, and this is one of them.

This DVD set has excellent widescreen picture and clear sound. Not a lot of extras, but a great price for two great films. Highly recommended.",1412726400,15,1432,5.217391304347826

Robert Redford stars in both. In ""Condor"" he plays a CIA researcher who comes back to work from lunch only to find all of his co-workers dead. What follows is a cat and mouse game between he and the agency he thought he could trust. It also stars Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson, and Max Von Sydow.
