3067953,4,B0011U52DS,"Based upon an 19th century novel, ""The Old Fairy Tale: When the Sun was God"" is unfortunately clumsily titled.  It's loosely the historical tale of Popiel, a cruel local ruler, and Ziemowit, a hero who 'saves the day.'  Against the backdrop of Pagan Poland, with Viking mercenaries and damsels in distress, it's a good tale with very nice production qualities.  Anyone who enjoys a film with sword-swinging action will like this film, even if the hero reminds him too much of Drew Carey's friend Oswald (Diedrich Bader).",1249171200,4,520,4.954022988505747

8242364,5,B0011U52DS,"Maybe I shouldn't have liked this movie so much, but its setting fascinates me.  One thing that I didn't like was the tragic death of the little prince, but the rest of the movie was really enjoyable.  (However, I should add that I watched it without subtitles, as unbeknownst to me they don't come on automatically for this movie, and since my knowledge of Polish is not so good, some of the dialogue could have been offensive or annoying).
Also, I am not at all a feminist, but for people who are, I should add that the most evil character in the movie appears to be the queen, who seemingly goads the king into carrying out multiple murders.  This doesn't bother me at all, but I think that some ideologically-inclined people would be annoyed.",1391472000,,746,4.552238805970149
8242365,1,B0011U52DS,The DVD is not working at all. I am not sure if I can return it because it is already out of the package. I can't rate the movie because I could not see it.,1373932800,,156,3.4857142857142858
8242366,4,B0011U52DS,Good story and lots of action.  Had to use sub titles to as in Eastern European language.  Long movie but enjoyed.,1359158400,,114,4.380952380952381
8242367,1,B0011U52DS,"Ipurchased this dvd for a friend for Xmas, thinking that my friend would enjoy it as it did have on the front cover."" English Subtitles"" but my friend has recently informed me that there are NO subtitles of any sort and the whole thing is in Polish. Seeing as how my friend does not speak Polish this was a wasted gift that has caused me much concern. First for my friend, who lost a gift, and for myself who has lost money from this dvd that is useless to both of us. It seems a pity that this has happened, because I'm sure that it is a good series.",1297555200,4,551,4.064220183486238
8242368,2,B0011U52DS,"My review isn't about the film (though I wish it were), but is instead about the product received from Amazon.
The product description on Amazon's site and on the DVD case both proclaimed that the film was subtitled in English. Upon launching the DVD, the menu was in English, but only had two selection choices: Play and Chapters. Play, as expected, launched the film ... in Polish with no apparent way to select or turn subtitles on. I thought that maybe Chapters would offer an option to enter a setup utility where subtitles might be selected, but no such luck. So, unfortunately, after poking, proding and peeking in every place I could, I gave up and sent the DVD back.
Searching around some, I have seen a copy of the film presumably from a different distributor (available from a Polish history site). I'm crossing fingers that this one will offer my much needed subtitles and that Amazon rectifies the item. (This is not to blame Amazon. I'm sure this is the result of a distributor cutting a corner.)",1294444800,5,1010,4.679775280898877
8242369,5,B0011U52DS,"For anyone that liked "" Pirates of the Caribbean"" this is a film along those lines. The  title is misleading  ""The Old Fairy Tale: When the Sun was God""  but this Polish film is jam packed with action, adventure and a fine story line.  This film can be considered historical fiction since many of the characters existed in Polish History  and is set in the times before Poland became a Christian Nation.  It was a T.V. mini series  that ran in Poland and is set in three chapters. I highly recommend this film, even with the subtitles one will truly enjoy  it.",1272153600,2,560,4.421568627450981
8242370,3,B0011U52DS,"I thought this was like Braveheart after reading other reviews, on Amazon and elsewhere. My family name is Popiel and I was very interested in the story of the King Popiel. I didn't learn much. It assumes you already are familiar with the story, so not a lot of attention to detail. The film is in three segments, apparently this was broadcast on Polish TV as a mini-series. The acting is overdone, the special effects reminded me of an episode of Power Rangers. The cinematography was good and that was about it. Three stars is as high as I go, it was OK.",1259020800,6,556,4.407766990291262
8242371,5,B0011U52DS,"Appease the Gods and you shall score! Oops, I gave away the ending ;))  Seriously though, considering the fact that it's so hard to find any decent historical data about Poland's past prior to the year 956, I think this movie has portrayed the legend quite nicely.  Personally, I would have been even happier if the ancient Slavic beliefs were elaborated a bit more.

At times, the movie may seem a wee bit too graphic to sensitive viewers.  Being born and raised in Poland, I grew up on Polish cinematography, so I'm somewhat used to the bloody battle scenes in historical films.  However, I have a hunch that most viewers won't mind the other specialty of Polish film makers, the nudie scenes ;))

Its historical value aside, it's a primordial ""boy meets girl"" story, and it has a happy ending as all proper fairytales should ;))  What can I say, I love my epic sagas... Enjoy!",1249257600,10,879,4.596153846153846
