7964177,1,B0000687LY,I give credit to the creators for trying.  I also wish them well in their new endeavors.  Film-making is not one of them.  Enough said.,1379980800,,135,4.32
7964178,2,B0000687LY,"The acting wasn't horrible, but the script was.  I gave 2 stars because the actors were apparently trying to work with a horrendous script.  Shame on the director, producer, and script writer for forcing actors to try and act this out.  The story is terrible, the effects are terrible and it was obvious that everything was done in front of a green screen.",1372636800,,356,4.619047619047619
7964179,1,B0000687LY,"I cannot possibly fathom how movies like this ever make it to distribution, this has to be some form of money laundering for fake movie sales. I couldn't even sit through the 1st 45 min's... thank god",1344124800,,200,4.4324324324324325
7964180,1,B0000687LY,"Clearly the filmmaker loves 60s French and Italian films, and wants to start a trend in Texas. God help us if it succeeds.

One of those ""dreamy"" films - meaning the autofocus and color regulator probably didn't work. The washed out sepia tone of the film lost its ""innovative glimmer"" after about 11 seconds. The sound quality makes it seem like they were using tin cans instead of microphones...

As for the 'script' - I'm not sure, but I'd say it was written by hipsters who live in Texas and have French film posters on their walls... but were being funded by the Texas Farm Board, or Texas DoT or something, since they're trying to pay homage to Truffault and Fellini but have to show Texas farmland to please their patrons.  Toss in some Biblical references (most likely gained from half-reading a Wikipedia page on Revelations) - and you have 7 Angels in Eden.  Oh - and dream scenes that seem like ""hey, this would be SOOOO freakin' cool, it'll blow MINDS, dude"" ideas they couldn't fit into the ""storyline"" but they wanted in anyhow.

Happily when we watched this, we didn't have a drinking game where you take a swig when you see a ""WTF?!?"" moment, or we'd all be dead of liver failure.  It's one of those films that make you think ""wow, I'd actually rather be at the office than watching this"".",1332460800,,1305,4.531914893617022
7964181,3,B0000687LY,"This movie is an excellent attempt at telling a story that immerses the viewer in a situation as confusing for the viewer as it is for the main characters.  I like a movie that tries to make us experience what the characters are experiencing - not just show us.  We have to pay attention and think, not just passively view.

When the movie opens, a man and a woman appear to be the only two people left on earth (in a setting that looks like Texas).  Was it a global apocalypse? The Rapture?  Nightmares that mimic reality seem to suggest there is more than meets the eye.  This is not a typical post-apocalypse movie, and it is not a horror/survivor story either.  It is original in many ways, but we have seen some of it before, too.

Writer, director, and actor Marshall Mills has created a movie with striking images, ominous atmosphere, and characters that seem like people we have seen in these kinds of situations.  When we are shown things that are familiar and unfamiliar at the same time, we try to find some kind of reference with which to make sense of it as a whole.  Marshall's screen play gives us precious few hints to help us; mostly he keeps us in the confused, dreamlike/nightmare-like world of the two protagonists.

Because it is like a dream at times, uncanny things can be accepted at face value, since they almost make sense, while other things conform to normalcy. The characters (and audience) have no choice but to keep on.  This makes for a challenging experience where things are not what they seem and we are continually wondering who these people are, how they got in this situation, what will happen, and what does it all mean?

We need more movies like this.  We get plenty of movies with linear plots that go out of the way to explain what is happening and keep the audience reassured.  We get too few movies that attempt to take us out of our comfort zone, make us wonder, and put us in the characters' situations.  One movie that comes to mind which successfully accomplishes that is ""Memento"".  Audiences will accept and enjoy the ride if things develop or build, and if the payoff is good.

This movie falls short of being great for a couple reasons: the screenplay is a little heavy-handed with symbolism, there is some clunky dialog and some of the acting is journeyman-like (although Mills is excellent), its low budget contributes to some scenes feeling stagnant, and the movie's payoff is a bit familiar.  But Mills is to be commended for this attempt and I hope we get to see more from this imaginative talent.

It's a good movie, not great, and I recommend you give a viewing.",1309996800,2,2621,4.55982905982906
7964182,4,B0000687LY,a little different but a good movie.  i liked the angel characters and the dog.  good acting.,1217894400,,93,4.411764705882353
