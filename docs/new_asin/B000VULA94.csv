2953591,5,B000VULA94,"I'm 62 years old and have great memories of seeing these three films when they were first released. I was concerned about the Chroma Color especially when it came to Kenneth Tobey in IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA. I was waiting for somebody to get his hair color wrong. Surprize, they got it right. I lived three houses from Ken when I was eight years old and enjoyed speaking to him about movies. I went to the old Wiltern Theatre is Los Angeles to see the double feature of EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS and THE WEREWOLF when Columbia released them. I had my own ideas of what color the alien was and the purple hued head works for me in the colorized version. The color of Dr. Marvin's car brought back memories of my father's car in 1956. I always thought 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH was a sad film. It showed how quickly we misjudge people, because they look differant. I don't know if Ray was thinking in terms of race during the late 50's, but looking at this film today I wonder. The statue of the Ymir is great and does look menancing while guarding my collection of Ray's films on my TV center. The improvement in colorization really shows in these films even if they still have problems with facial tones. The choice of the color for the military uniforms seems to effect the facial colors at time, but all in all I was very happy to visit my old friends in this new format. You must watch the lovely Joan Taylor's, age has not deemed her beauty, memories of Hollywood. It was also interesting to note that EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS was co-written by a black listed writer, Bernard Gordon, from the McCarthy Era and his name has been restored to it's proper credit. I have an old Black and White copy with his friends name on it which means more to me now after hearing that back story. I strongly recommend everyone to these films.",1234828800,22,1840,4.36734693877551

Included in the gift set is a collectible Ymir figurine based on Ray Harryhausen's original 1957 hand-crafted design.  Very cool looking!

A double-dip is only needed if you want/need the Ymir figurine as the films and special features are the same as the currently available 2-disk releases.  It's a shame the Ymir is not available separately.",1191283200,38,2598,5.532828282828283
2953593,5,B000VULA94,HUGE Harryhausen fan so I was very pleased to find this at such a great price. And the movies colorized -- saw things I had never seen before. Very pleased!!!,1461974400,,158,4.3
2953594,5,B000VULA94,Watch these flicks in all their black and white glory back in the day on Saturday fright night tv. The colorization is well done but still can watch in glorious b/w. The figure is an added wonderful bonus. The stop motion effects are far better than the cold lifeless CGI stuff done today.  I highly recommend this set and even my young daughter enjoys the flicks.,1453420800,2,364,4.515151515151516

2953597,5,B000VULA94,An excellent collectors' set. I love the Ymir model!,1427673600,,52,4.888888888888889

2953599,5,B000VULA94,3 great harryhausen movies in color  plus the Venusian monster Ymir. All at a great price.,1421193600,,90,4.625
2953600,4,B000VULA94,"As other reviewers have noted, the figure is impressively big, heavy, and really awesome, but also very easy to chip and break.  My son had broken off a toe from the monster within an hour of having it out of the box--and he wasn't even playing with it, just showing his mom what it looked like.  The movies are a lot of fun, and I love the cheesy colorization process.  These films aren't as entertaining as Sinbad or Jason & the Argonauts, but they definitely have their B-movie charms, especially 20 Million Miles to Earth.  As a few of the negative reviews of this product have mentioned, the angle icon will stay on the screen as you watch the movie (enabling you to toggle between color and black and white); however, this is an easy fix:  Simply go to your DVD player's setup menu and turn off the icon, and it will go away.  Overall, a very big hit with my kids who love old sci-fi/monster movies.",1419724800,2,905,4.389221556886228

2953603,5,B000VULA94,"I grew up spending a lot of Saturday afternoons at the movies and couldn't wait for the next Ray Harryhausen film to come out.

2953609,5,B000VULA94,I love the old black and white version of these Harryhausen films but the colorized versions are very well done.  This process is much better than the original colorizing attempts of other films.  I can't say anything bad about this product.  The statue is icing on the top.,1401494400,2,274,4.666666666666667
2953610,5,B000VULA94,"It is really cool being able to see these three movies in color.  The colorization is first rate and was overseen by Harryhausen himself to make sure it met his desires.  If you like stop motion animation, you will love these movies.  It is also great to get a model of the Ymir as part of the package.",1400630400,2,302,4.172413793103448
2953611,5,B000VULA94,my friend is a Ray Harryhausen fan and was very happy with this dvd. I bought it as a gift for him.,1396396800,2,99,3.5454545454545454
2953612,5,B000VULA94,"As I say in the subject ""It's Ray Harryhousen need I say more?"" Well I will ""THERE IS A SIGNED AND NUMBERED YMIR FIGURE"", along with 3 of his best and earliest films. You can't go wrong with this set. Also I looked at the Blu-Ray set and not only is the picture quality the same on this DVD set, they can only enhance older films so much, you don't get the Ymir figure which comes with a signed and numbered certificate of authenticity.

2953613,5,B000VULA94,"The Best Box Set So Far, And Ray Harryhausen [Master Genius] Box Must Have For All Die Hard Collectors!!!  It's Hear At Last.",1392595200,,125,4.434782608695652
2953614,5,B000VULA94,"This is a good thing to own if you are a Harryhausen fan. The only irritation is I own these titles three times over now. First I got them on video, then separately on DVD, then in a three disc box set, then separately as colorized versions. Now all three are in a set together. I broke down and purchased this set because I needed a colorized Earth VS Flying Saucers. Also included was an amazing reproduction of the YMIR creature from 20 million miles to earth.  The discs (2 per movie) are the same as the 2 disc of these titles sold separately. The only difference is the cases are slim line. So depending what you already own by Harryhausen, this could be a bargain or a redundant purchase. If you own videos or dvds in Black and white, then this is a good purchase because the colorization process is better than the one from twenty years ago. Ray Harryhausen oversaw the dubbing, and feels these films are now finalized.. So if you brought all three colorized films separately, then you will not need this set. However, if you have to have a 9 inch statue of YWIR, then the set is worth it for that alone. The extra material on the bonus disc for each film has different things than the black and white releases bonus material. So you will get new material as well as Ray narrating for the color versions.",1392163200,6,1312,4.377049180327869
2953615,5,B000VULA94,"I bought this as a gift for a young old-movie buff.  He enjoyed the movies and the included figure.
The shipping was efficient and the box was well-wrapped.",1391385600,,156,4.571428571428571
2953616,3,B000VULA94,"My son really wanted this from Santa.  The figurine breaks VERY easily and we have had to super glue it several times as tiny pieces have broken off.  The figurines are numbered.  Allegedly they only made a limited amount of Ymir figures but be VERY careful when you open it and keep it on a high shelf away from kids, dogs, traffic.... or you will start losing tiny pieces of it.",1388793600,2,380,4.323943661971831
2953617,5,B000VULA94,"This Ray Harryhausen gift box has three movies,each two disc editions,and has a wonderfully numbered limited edition YMIR,with certificate enclosed. The movies alone are available by themselves,but if your a big Harryhausen fan,you will surely delight in this handsomely crafted and detailed YMIR that is included. The movies come in a watchable colourized version and the original B&W version. I will say it off the top,that I realize that there has been a ""problems"" with this set. Namely that the angle icon will appear either throughout all of the movies runs,or intermittently. There are two solutions:To remove the icon go into your DVD menu and look for the angle icon. You simply opt to shut it off. Or the players that do not have such an angle shut off,will definitely have a subtitle shut off. You go to that and simply press no subtitles. If it already shows it off,press it again,that way the machine gets the message. And that's that. It is too bad you have to do this to begin with. For some reason the makers have put the optical tracks side by side,instead of making each film on a separate disc. Bad/cheap planning.
The first film is""It Came from Beneath the Sea""(released July/55),starring,among others,Kenneth Tobey,Faith Domergue,and Donald Curtis. The story finds us tangling with a giant octopus,which is huge and radioactive(the characters speculate)due to Atomic bomb testing in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. It slowly makes its way across the ocean wreaking havoc along the way. Eventually it makes its merry way to San Francisco and the Golden Gate bridge area. There the beast is finally taken down. This film is most memorable for the final scenes on the bridge and the waterfront area of the city,where the tentacles feel their way through the streets destroying,crushing and killing.
The second film stars our enclosed YMIR,""20,000,000 miles to Earth""(released June/57).It stars,among others,William Hopper,Joan Taylor and Frank Puglia. The story involves a space ship of ours returning home from Venus. On it is some precious cargo,but the ship crashes off the coast of Sicily and only one man survives. A little boy finds a strange capsule and sells its contents to a professor. The contents turn out to be an ever growing bi-pedal creature from Venus. The professor tries to take his prize to Rome but the creature escapes. Initially it is not aggressive but with some run ins with farmers and animals,it becomes so. The creature,by now huge,meets its doom while scaling the Colliseum,crashing to its death. Harryhausen's YMIR is a fascinating creature to watch as it grows,and one almost develops an empathy for it,ala King Kong.
The final film is my favourite,""Earth VS The Flying Saucers""(released July/56).It stars,among others,Hugh Marlowe and Joan Taylor. This story finds its main characters working for Project Skyhook,which is sending several satellites into orbit. It seems some aliens from a dying world are here and don't like what they see,so they are destroying said satellites. The aliens try to arrange a meeting with the head of the Project,but their message is received and understood too late. One of the aliens is attacked and killed when they appear. From here on it's every man and alien for themselves,as the aliens get aggressive and start their quest for world dominance. It all comes to a screeching halt when we develop a sound ray that interrupts the drives to the alien saucers. This movie is quite iconic and has many memorable moments including the saucermen themselves,the saucers,and their famous attack on Washington.
All of these movies have a plethora of extras on the second discs,including commentary by Harryhausen,interviews with him,featurettes,and SO much more I cannot mention here. I was NOT a fan of colourization when it first came out in the 80s. It was so pasty and phony looking. This newly computerized colourization,and supervised btw by Harryhaousen himself,looks very real and quite convincing. As was mentioned,to see the B&W or colour versions you use the angle button on your remote. All films are in their original w/s a/r of 1:85:1.
All in all,all Harryhausen fans will rejoice at these films. Expect some graininess with them,but generally they look very good. Along with this you get your very own collectible;a hand crafted YMIR,which is numbered,with a certificate of authenticity. FANtastic!",1385164800,3,4395,5.148251748251749
2953618,5,B000VULA94,"I love Ray Harryhausen movies, especially 20 Million Miles to Earth. One of my all-time favorites. The Ymir figurine is very well made and is a great replica of the movie creature. This set is right down my alley! And, of course, the movies are fantastic! A set well worth having.",1365120000,,280,4.509803921568627
2953619,2,B000VULA94,"I am a huge Ray Harryhausen fan and have everything he has ever done on film, needless to say I was very excited to see these old classics colorized!!! The figurine of the Ymir is fantastic much larger than I had imagined and made of a very sturdy durable subtance. The colorization was very well done, much better than the earlier attempt at colorizing the original King Kong which was sad. I would have been happy to give this product a 5 star review except for the irratating icon of a old reel to reel movie projector that remains on the screen the entire movie long on all six movies like some fat june bug you just can't shoo away. The icon is not present on any of the special features disc's. If anyone out there knows how to get rid of this icon please post that info on this product review page. I thought that it could be removed by useing the angle button as is suggested to switch from color to black & white a feature I feel is rather useless considering most people interested in seeing these old movies probabley allready own the B&W versions and the option to watch the movies in thier B&W form are there at the begining why would you want to jump back and forth from color to B&W while watching the film? I have 4 different D.V.D. players & the icon appears when disc are played on all 4 players so i'm sure this is not a fluke, it truely is a shame that this icon is present as they did do a great job colorizing them. I can't believe 5 people have reviewed this product & failed to mention the presence of that icon? Maybe they know how to get rid of it. If you know please share that info with everyone, If I could remove the icon I will be changeing my rateing of this product & shareing the info. I must say that the figurine of the Ymir is a joy & worth what I paid for the D.V.D's there were only 10,000 made, one product review states thier Ymir's arm was broken leaving 9,999. It comes with a certificate of authenticity with Rays signature of approval and the number count of each figure from 1 to 10,000 it was made from a refurbished cast of Ray's original Ymir sculpture under Ray's personal supervision. There are other scuplture replicas of Mr. Harryhausens work available to the public but none of this quality & it comes with the certificate of authenticity. If you take good care of your Ymir it will only gain in value. So you might want to think twice before letting the grand kids have a go at him. 10,000 may sound like alot but Ray Harryhausen fans number in the million's the mans contribution to speacial effects in cinema can not be overstated. Before C.G.I. stop motion animation was the top of the game and Ray Harryhausen was the best at that game. Before ""Jurassic Park"" the gold standard for dinosaurs in film was "" The Valley of Gwangi"", a project developed by Ray's mentor & pioneer of stop motion animation Mr. Willis O'Brien who never got a chance to make the film. Mr. Harryhausen & Mr. Schneer saw it come to fruitation in 1969. It would take over two decades before dinosaurs in film could be improved. But no matter how much I love Harryhausen's work & no matter how well they colorized it, I can't 5 star this product with that icon ever present!",1363564800,5,3204,4.332778702163061
2953620,5,B000VULA94,"This gift set is a must have item for anyone who is a fan of Ray Harryhausen's films.

2953622,5,B000VULA94,"The Ymir is a man sized creature that was brought back to Earth in 1957 with our first manned mission to that planet.

In reality it was basically a moveable toy that was created by Ray Harryhausen.  It had hinged joints so it could be made to appear to move.  It had holes in its feet so they could be screwed into the board represnting the surface it was moving on.  And finally it had a bag in its chest so that Harryhausen could press a pump and create the illusion that it breathed.

Seeing 20 Million Miles to Earth (the movie which featured the Ymir) along with the other Harryhausen classics is just plain fun.

Watching the Ymir along with the 50s actors that were interacting with him (at least I think the Ymir was a him) was both intentionally and unintentionally entertaining.  It was unintentionally entertaining because the 50s actors were assigned to play parts that were largely more unbelievable than the fake creatures Harryhausen created.

The military guys were all barrell chested and bravado in the way 50s leading men could be.  And the women were ultimately irrelevant in the way 50s cinema could so happily make them.

And the best part was the audio commentary including Harryhausen.  Fifty years later, he still sounds like what you would expect from a guy who made a living creating fake creatures for 50s type sci fi movies.  He proudly discusses the realistic shadows cast by his flying saucers.  He opines on how he worked with the actors so they'd know where to look on screen for his fake creatures.  And he's pleased with how the colorization process has brought his old black and white movies (they didn't have enough money to make them in color) to life.

And if this isn't enough for you, you get an Ymir model for your very own.  I got mine on discount because the box was damaged but even if I hadn't gotten that lucky I think I'd have popped the bucks and in fact, would recommend you do so too!!!",1239235200,11,1938,4.525862068965517

3188096,5,B000VULA94,3 great harryhausen movies in color  plus the Venusian monster Ymir. All at a great price.,1421193600,,90,4.625
3188097,4,B000VULA94,"As other reviewers have noted, the figure is impressively big, heavy, and really awesome, but also very easy to chip and break.  My son had broken off a toe from the monster within an hour of having it out of the box--and he wasn't even playing with it, just showing his mom what it looked like.  The movies are a lot of fun, and I love the cheesy colorization process.  These films aren't as entertaining as Sinbad or Jason & the Argonauts, but they definitely have their B-movie charms, especially 20 Million Miles to Earth.  As a few of the negative reviews of this product have mentioned, the angle icon will stay on the screen as you watch the movie (enabling you to toggle between color and black and white); however, this is an easy fix:  Simply go to your DVD player's setup menu and turn off the icon, and it will go away.  Overall, a very big hit with my kids who love old sci-fi/monster movies.",1419724800,2,905,4.389221556886228

3188107,5,B000VULA94,"It is really cool being able to see these three movies in color.  The colorization is first rate and was overseen by Harryhausen himself to make sure it met his desires.

3188109,5,B000VULA94,"As I say in the subject ""It's Ray Harryhousen need I say more?"" Well I will ""THERE IS A SIGNED AND NUMBERED YMIR FIGURE"", along with 3 of his best and earliest films. You can't go wrong with this set. Also I looked at the Blu-Ray set and not only is the picture quality the same on this DVD set, they can only enhance older films so much, you don't get the Ymir figure which comes with a signed and numbered certificate of authenticity.

3188111,5,B000VULA94,"This is a good thing to own if you are a Harryhausen fan. The only irritation is I own these titles three times over now. First I got them on video, then separately on DVD, then in a three disc box set, then separately as colorized versions. Now all three are in a set together. I broke down and purchased this set because I needed a colorized Earth VS Flying Saucers. Also included was an amazing reproduction of the YMIR creature from 20 million miles to earth.  The discs (2 per movie) are the same as the 2 disc of these titles sold separately. The only difference is the cases are slim line. So depending what you already own by Harryhausen, this could be a bargain or a redundant purchase. If you own videos or dvds in Black and white, then this is a good purchase because the colorization process is better than the one from twenty years ago. Ray Harryhausen oversaw the dubbing, and feels these films are now finalized.. So if you brought all three colorized films separately, then you will not need this set. However, if you have to have a 9 inch statue of YWIR, then the set is worth it for that alone. The extra material on the bonus disc for each film has different things than the black and white releases bonus material. So you will get new material as well as Ray narrating for the color versions.",1392163200,6,1312,4.377049180327869
3188112,5,B000VULA94,"I bought this as a gift for a young old-movie buff.  He enjoyed the movies and the included figure.

3188113,3,B000VULA94,"My son really wanted this from Santa.  The figurine breaks VERY easily and we have had to super glue it several times as tiny pieces have broken off.  The figurines are numbered.  Allegedly they only made a limited amount of Ymir figures but be VERY careful when you open it and keep it on a high shelf away from kids, dogs, traffic.... or you will start losing tiny pieces of it.",1388793600,2,380,4.323943661971831
3188114,5,B000VULA94,"This Ray Harryhausen gift box has three movies,each two disc editions,and has a wonderfully numbered limited edition YMIR,with certificate enclosed. The movies alone are available by themselves,but if your a big Harryhausen fan,you will surely delight in this handsomely crafted and detailed YMIR that is included. The movies come in a watchable colourized version and the original B&W version. I will say it off the top,that I realize that there has been a ""problems"" with this set. Namely that the angle icon will appear either throughout all of the movies runs,or intermittently. There are two solutions:To remove the icon go into your DVD menu and look for the angle icon. You simply opt to shut it off. Or the players that do not have such an angle shut off,will definitely have a subtitle shut off. You go to that and simply press no subtitles. If it already shows it off,press it again,that way the machine gets the message. And that's that. It is too bad you have to do this to begin with. For some reason the makers have put the optical tracks side by side,instead of making each film on a separate disc. Bad/cheap planning.
The first film is""It Came from Beneath the Sea""(released July/55),starring,among others,Kenneth Tobey,Faith Domergue,and Donald Curtis. The story finds us tangling with a giant octopus,which is huge and radioactive(the characters speculate)due to Atomic bomb testing in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. It slowly makes its way across the ocean wreaking havoc along the way. Eventually it makes its merry way to San Francisco and the Golden Gate bridge area. There the beast is finally taken down. This film is most memorable for the final scenes on the bridge and the waterfront area of the city,where the tentacles feel their way through the streets destroying,crushing and killing.
The second film stars our enclosed YMIR,""20,000,000 miles to Earth""(released June/57).It stars,among others,William Hopper,Joan Taylor and Frank Puglia. The story involves a space ship of ours returning home from Venus. On it is some precious cargo,but the ship crashes off the coast of Sicily and only one man survives. A little boy finds a strange capsule and sells its contents to a professor. The contents turn out to be an ever growing bi-pedal creature from Venus. The professor tries to take his prize to Rome but the creature escapes. Initially it is not aggressive but with some run ins with farmers and animals,it becomes so. The creature,by now huge,meets its doom while scaling the Colliseum,crashing to its death. Harryhausen's YMIR is a fascinating creature to watch as it grows,and one almost develops an empathy for it,ala King Kong.
The final film is my favourite,""Earth VS The Flying Saucers""(released July/56).It stars,among others,Hugh Marlowe and Joan Taylor. This story finds its main characters working for Project Skyhook,which is sending several satellites into orbit. It seems some aliens from a dying world are here and don't like what they see,so they are destroying said satellites. The aliens try to arrange a meeting with the head of the Project,but their message is received and understood too late. One of the aliens is attacked and killed when they appear. From here on it's every man and alien for themselves,as the aliens get aggressive and start their quest for world dominance. It all comes to a screeching halt when we develop a sound ray that interrupts the drives to the alien saucers. This movie is quite iconic and has many memorable moments including the saucermen themselves,the saucers,and their famous attack on Washington.
All of these movies have a plethora of extras on the second discs,including commentary by Harryhausen,interviews with him,featurettes,and SO much more I cannot mention here. I was NOT a fan of colourization when it first came out in the 80s. It was so pasty and phony looking. This newly computerized colourization,and supervised btw by Harryhaousen himself,looks very real and quite convincing. As was mentioned,to see the B&W or colour versions you use the angle button on your remote. All films are in their original w/s a/r of 1:85:1.
All in all,all Harryhausen fans will rejoice at these films. Expect some graininess with them,but generally they look very good. Along with this you get your very own collectible;a hand crafted YMIR,which is numbered,with a certificate of authenticity. FANtastic!",1385164800,3,4395,5.148251748251749

The Ymir figurine is very well made and is a great replica of the movie creature. This set is right down my alley! And, of course, the movies are fantastic! A set well worth having.",1365120000,,280,4.509803921568627
3188116,2,B000VULA94,"I am a huge Ray Harryhausen fan and have everything he has ever done on film, needless to say I was very excited to see these old classics colorized!!! The figurine of the Ymir is fantastic much larger than I had imagined and made of a very sturdy durable subtance. The colorization was very well done, much better than the earlier attempt at colorizing the original King Kong which was sad. I would have been happy to give this product a 5 star review except for the irratating icon of a old reel to reel movie projector that remains on the screen the entire movie long on all six movies like some fat june bug you just can't shoo away. The icon is not present on any of the special features disc's. If anyone out there knows how to get rid of this icon please post that info on this product review page. I thought that it could be removed by useing the angle button as is suggested to switch from color to black & white a feature I feel is rather useless considering most people interested in seeing these old movies probabley allready own the B&W versions and the option to watch the movies in thier B&W form are there at the begining why would you want to jump back and forth from color to B&W while watching the film? I have 4 different D.V.D. players & the icon appears when disc are played on all 4 players so i'm sure this is not a fluke, it truely is a shame that this icon is present as they did do a great job colorizing them. I can't believe 5 people have reviewed this product & failed to mention the presence of that icon? Maybe they know how to get rid of it. If you know please share that info with everyone, If I could remove the icon I will be changeing my rateing of this product & shareing the info. I must say that the figurine of the Ymir is a joy & worth what I paid for the D.V.D's there were only 10,000 made, one product review states thier Ymir's arm was broken leaving 9,999. It comes with a certificate of authenticity with Rays signature of approval and the number count of each figure from 1 to 10,000 it was made from a refurbished cast of Ray's original Ymir sculpture under Ray's personal supervision. There are other scuplture replicas of Mr. Harryhausens work available to the public but none of this quality & it comes with the certificate of authenticity. If you take good care of your Ymir it will only gain in value. So you might want to think twice before letting the grand kids have a go at him. 10,000 may sound like alot but Ray Harryhausen fans number in the million's the mans contribution to speacial effects in cinema can not be overstated. Before C.G.I. stop motion animation was the top of the game and Ray Harryhausen was the best at that game. Before ""Jurassic Park"" the gold standard for dinosaurs in film was "" The Valley of Gwangi"", a project developed by Ray's mentor & pioneer of stop motion animation Mr. Willis O'Brien who never got a chance to make the film. Mr. Harryhausen & Mr. Schneer saw it come to fruitation in 1969. It would take over two decades before dinosaurs in film could be improved. But no matter how much I love Harryhausen's work & no matter how well they colorized it, I can't 5 star this product with that icon ever present!",1363564800,5,3204,4.332778702163061

3188119,5,B000VULA94,"The Ymir is a man sized creature that was brought back to Earth in 1957 with our first manned mission to that planet.

In reality it was basically a moveable toy that was created by Ray Harryhausen.  It had hinged joints so it could be made to appear to move.  It had holes in its feet so they could be screwed into the board represnting the surface it was moving on.  And finally it had a bag in its chest so that Harryhausen could press a pump and create the illusion that it breathed.

Seeing 20 Million Miles to Earth (the movie which featured the Ymir) along with the other Harryhausen classics is just plain fun.

Watching the Ymir along with the 50s actors that were interacting with him (at least I think the Ymir was a him) was both intentionally and unintentionally entertaining.  It was unintentionally entertaining because the 50s actors were assigned to play parts that were largely more unbelievable than the fake creatures Harryhausen created.

The military guys were all barrell chested and bravado in the way 50s leading men could be.  And the women were ultimately irrelevant in the way 50s cinema could so happily make them.

And the best part was the audio commentary including Harryhausen.  Fifty years later, he still sounds like what you would expect from a guy who made a living creating fake creatures for 50s type sci fi movies.  He proudly discusses the realistic shadows cast by his flying saucers.  He opines on how he worked with the actors so they'd know where to look on screen for his fake creatures.  And he's pleased with how the colorization process has brought his old black and white movies (they didn't have enough money to make them in color) to life.

And if this isn't enough for you, you get an Ymir model for your very own.  I got mine on discount because the box was damaged but even if I hadn't gotten that lucky I think I'd have popped the bucks and in fact, would recommend you do so too!!!",1239235200,11,1938,4.525862068965517
