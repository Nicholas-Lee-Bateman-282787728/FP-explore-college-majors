911283,2,6304652798,"It's so bad it is almost funny. Almost. If it cost 50 cents, it would be overpriced.",1274140800,2,84,4.0
911284,3,6304652798,"For fans of low budget films this could be entertaining to watch.
Both  films in this two DVD set are quite similar in content.  Both have quite a  bit of nudity, both are quite low budget, and both have quite similar  storylines.
Princess Warrior is about a pair of sisters.  The older one  (heir to the throne of whatever planet they are on) is evil.  The young one  represents purity and good.  When they both are at their mother's deathbed,  their mother declares the pure one as heir.  Obviously the evil one is not  impressed and vows to kill her sister.  Out pops one of the funniest but  most entertaining 'lightsaber' battles I have ever seen.  Scantily-clad  women with little lightsabers, and some cool sound effects.  Wow.
After  that though the film goes a little downhill (but not too much, it never was  too high up there in the first place).  The good sister transports herself  to a planet called 'Earth'  to escape her evil sister (who follows anyhow).  The good sister meets up with a man who falls for her and can't decide  whether it's worth all this trouble to get her in the sack.  The rest of  the movie is your tongue in cheek bimbo type film, wet t-shirt contests,  the women and men not understanding what each other mean (because they are  from different planets of course!), sex, etc.  Dang is Sharon Lee Jones hot  though.
The Eye Of The Serpent is a sword and sorcery low budgetter that  pits family against each other much the same way as the previously  mentioned film.  Sister and mother are fighting to unite two swords and to  reclaim their kingdom from an 'evil' sister.  If you've seen the first film  in this set, just change it from a sci-fi film to a fantasy film and it's  the practically the same movie.  Diana Frank whom I saw in the film Pale  Blood has a major role in this film and she's a cutie.  Just like Princess  Warrior, this one has lots of nudity and some sex scenes as well.  There's  a hero who falls for the good sister and can't decide whether she's worth  all the trouble to bed her, etc. etc.
Overall fans of lower budget  bimboish type films (i.e. Sorority Babes In The Slime Ball Bowl A-Rama,  Beach Babes From Beyond, or Slave Girls From Beyond Infinity) should enjoy  these two.  They are pretty funny and entertaining if you like this kind of  film.",968198400,19,2315,4.462650602409639
911285,1,6304652798,"This is one of the worst movies ever made. And it isn't even funny. Two sisters rules an empire (that we won't see anything from), and when teir mother dies the evil sister want to kill the nice sister.
The nice sister  escapes to earth arriving, by pure coincidence, to a topless bar. Then the  girls run around the rest of the movie, trying to be sexy, not succeeding.
The dialog is like a bad pornoflick, the set budget doesn't exist, it is  more like as if the actors are walking around a town and some guy with  videocamera runs after them. Can't have cost more than 100-200$ to make.",946339200,16,589,4.327272727272727

Eventually Curette escapes and finds Ovule and the two women fight for control of their planet.

7875743,4,6304652798,"Well, that was a truly atrocious movie, but it was kind of fun to watch. The out-of-sync sound track combined with the slightly different out-of-sync subtitles to shield the viewer somewhat from the dreadful dialog. Sharon Lee Jones arrives on Earth naked, and steals a t-shirt to cover herself.  In the one bit of artistic dedication in the film, she seems to have performed the rest of the movie without stealing underpants.  There were a few telling glimpses of places where they should have been but weren't.  I'm sure the young ladies performing in the minimally clad wet t-shirt contest put the wages earned thereby into their college funds.
