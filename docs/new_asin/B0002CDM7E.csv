2075880,5,B0002CDM7E,"I loved it from the first time I bought it. I wake up every morning to do this workout. It includes exercises for warm up, aerobics, mat work and to cool down. It makes me feel wide awake and alert when I go to work. I am also on Weight Watchers and I use this tape to do my activity and gain extra points. I also published a book and believe it or not exercising with this workout for only 29 minutes has made me lose 33 lbs good enough to have a dream of promoting my book on a TV or radio show one day.

2075881,5,B0002CDM7E,"Don't let the cover fool you. It may have been made in the 80's, I purchased my first one back then, but it will give you a work out! My tape is rather old and when I saw that Amazon sold it, I just had to purchase a back up. This workout covers everything you need and the cost is WAY cheaper then all these new, fancy named exercise tapes. The 29 minute workout does what it says, a great 29 minute warm up, exercise and cool down. LOVE this Workout!",1319587200,,452,3.978021978021978
2075882,5,B0002CDM7E,"I wrote the below review some time back.  The instructor is ""Gin Miller"" not Debbie somebody. (Original post below)
 I  have looked  everywhere for this.....I do mean everywhere.  Today while in a resale shop I scan the old VHS hopging to fine this video (as I always did).  I didn't remember the name and only remembered it was Gin Miller.  When I could not find it with her other stuff....I had almost given up.

Also jokingly I prayed to God to help me find it.....""I said something like if you love me you would""  When I saw the tape I did not think it was ""the one"" but I needed a good 30 minute workout so I brought it.  Thank God I did.  When I got home put it in,  my jaw dropped when I saw Gin's face.  Thank you, thank you God I kept saying.

This is a great tape.  If you are new to working out and want something you can easily learn and fun to do everyday....This is the ONE.

Im so glad also I got online and looked for and found it here.  I will be many if not all.",1310860800,,980,3.9690721649484537
2075883,5,B0002CDM7E,Though the setting is dated (early 90's) the workout is timeless.  It's easy to follow and it is one you will actually do.  I did it regularly at a health club in the 90's.  After the club closed I searched for it online and was so pleased to find it.  It is a workout that you can stick with.  By adding weights and step height it can be more challenging.  I switch from hand held weights to wearing a weighted vest to add variety and work different muscles.  Great workout and only takes 30 minutes start to finish.,1246924800,,517,4.214285714285714
2075884,5,B0002CDM7E,"This DVD from 1987 helps me lose many pounds.  It melted fat off me so fast.  I love the organization, thee is an announcer off camera who calls out the exercises while the cast moves.  It fast paced and the time goes buy quickly.  The standing cardio routine will be felt the next day for sure.  Great leg whittler.",1233705600,,316,4.288135593220339
2075885,5,B0002CDM7E,"This one is a real gem - ignore the cover; the woman on the cover is NOT who leads the workout - it is, in fact, none other than GIN MILLER!!!

This is a wonderful step workout that utilizes light hand weights to work the upper body while doing intermediate intensity easier choregraphy step.
Words cannot express how much I love this workout!!",1230595200,,344,4.4603174603174605
2075886,5,B0002CDM7E,Excellent workout. I lost 15 pounds the 1st three weeks. this is the original and it really works!,1223510400,,98,4.5
2075887,1,B0002CDM7E,"I guess the people who made this video were in so much of a hurry that they forget to exercise the other leg!! The pushups and other exercises are great, but I feel cheated when I buy a videotape and they neglect to exercise muscles on the opposing side of the body. The outer and inner thigh exercises for one half of the body are totally missing!! I even rewound the tape just to make sure I hadn't made a mistake. I guess they thought people would buy the tape because they figured they would get a whole body workout in only 29 minutes. That's not the case. I also can't stand the incessant and pointless laughter from the people in the background designed to make you think they're having a good time.

There are newer AND older tapes that are better than this. I've bought much, much better older cheesy videos at yard sales.",1127692800,,831,4.361290322580645

2075889,5,B0002CDM7E,I bought this after my first child was born and it really helped get me back in shape.  Two children later and I still put this video in my collection because it is do-able and effective for legs and abs!,1114473600,,204,4.1

8025901,5,B0002CDM7E,This really should be put on DVD. This is an excellent and easy routine that provides quick results.,1477440000,,100,4.611111111111111

8025903,5,B0002CDM7E,"I had this video years ago, and it was damaged. I remembered Deborah Lee nice smooth style, I work out and stretch with this video at 3:30am and at work by 5:30 am feeling wonderful and ready to work with my patients. A great way to wake up and start the day for me 7 days a week. Started working out with this video in the early 90's. searched everywhere for it. Amazon is a great place to shop.",1434758400,,396,4.025316455696203

I am over 50 and nothing seemed to thin out my middle but this did the trick.  Going to keep at it, hopefully!",1429228800,,245,3.979591836734694

8025906,5,B0002CDM7E,"I first purchased this workout on VHS in the mid-90s to help with ridding myself of post-pregnancy weight.  I have no doubt that it was effective throughout the weeks and months of daily use.  However, the tape got lost due to a video rental mishap and was I bummed.  Fast forward almost twenty years to a few weeks ago when I found this tape on Amazon.  Oh, yeah!  I snapped it up and purchased a VCR in order to be able to use it.  I am a routine practitioner of various fitness activities, but this workout never fails to induce a serious burn in my shoulders, legs, and abs.  There is no question that the various body muscle groups are being worked.  An aside: the apparel and overall vibe (hair, makeup, etc.) are totally 90s and look dated relative to newer productions, as evidenced by the cover -- a fun blast from the past.",1383091200,,833,4.363636363636363
8025907,5,B0002CDM7E,Had this tape as a teenager. Still love it as a great basic step workout that will kick your tail. Ordring was simple and it shipped and arrived fast. It was in great condition and I use it everyday.,1379030400,,199,4.128205128205129
