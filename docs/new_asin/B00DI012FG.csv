8593438,2,B00DI012FG,"I love British movies.  That being said, the first 10 minutes of this movie annoyed and offended me. The hip hop ""artist"" kkk, what is better than self-entitlement. His manager is equally annoying. I don't like hip hop, to be honest and this film lost me early on. I'm pretty sure I tuned out. Did I give this movie a fair shake? Maybe not but the kkk character and his manager totally turned me off.",1397779200,2,400,4.333333333333333
8593439,4,B00DI012FG,"I couldn't resist the sexy white guy on the cover so I ordered the dvd from Amazon. Unfortunately the vanilla rapper is far less sexy in the movie but that's ok. Exposing macho gay rappers in the hostile homophobic rap world is a hot topic to tackle...and this movie is more than over-the-top.

I sent the dvd to my friend Dale GUY Madison to share with gay teenagers at the Los angles Gay & Lesbian Center, the largest in the world. Surprisingly Dale replied by posting a Facebook picture of him taken with Rikki Beadle- Blair, the black gay writer/producer/director of BASHMENT.  I hope the LA kids enjoy the film and even learn a little something about themselves in the process.",1389744000,,682,4.628099173553719
8593440,5,B00DI012FG,"Rikki Beadle- Blair, the Director of this flick. I just love his style of movie making. The social-sexual identity that he puts in his films. Race, Sex, Class, Gender and Religion, Make you want to just get up off the your sofa and start writing a blog on one of these topic. I also own his other movie ""Kickoff"" witch is good, as well.",1384560000,,336,4.265625
8593441,5,B00DI012FG,It was great. Movie perfect condition perfect.  It's amazing the power of hate  the writer is amazing I can't wait to read the play.,1383955200,,132,4.458333333333333
