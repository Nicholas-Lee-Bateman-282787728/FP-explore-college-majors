this film is not a visual treat. There are however, some interesting  facts presented in the form of Documents, Un-retouched photos and the like. The NAZI'S were the first to use the ALIEN MYTH to evade the Allies in their search for

8012445,3,B0001GSPNW,"If you really do your homework, you will discover that the period when these discs first appear is the early 1940's and that credible people have determined the Germans were on to something beyond Newtonian Physics.

The first official sighting is claimed by two Navy Intelligence pilots over Washington State in 1947 and it's no coincidence that thousands of German scientists were spirited to safety after the war.

Obviously your mind is probably made up, and you wouldn't be investigating the phenomenon if you didn't have strong feelings about it. But before you dismiss me as a nut, read ""The Hunt For Zero Point"" by Nick Cook, aviation editor of Jane's Defense Weekly. Watch a TLC program called ""The Billion Dollar Secret"". These two sources will give you a good idea of what your seeing; a craft powered by a gravitational field that literally 'falls' in whatever direction the pilot steers. Another field inside the craft protects the occupant from G's that would kill anyone making a turn like the ones typically witnessed.

There's plenty of other source material, more than half mixed with fabrication and truth, including this video. The music is so cheesy and the production value so low that it is really not worth the price, however as I said, there is sadly a grain or two of truth here.",1117238400,7,1305,4.84304932735426
8012446,4,B0001GSPNW,"Makes you wonder why these types of UFO's haven't been seen since the post war period.

Makes you also wonder why lots of German scientists moved over to the US after the war, what else did they bring with them?

Though the quality of the DVD is about as good as an old VHS tape, the content is pretty unique and gives the view some new perspectives to consider.

The end of the DVD focuses less on fact and more on speculation, but overall - an intresting perspective.",1109548800,5,469,4.306818181818182

8012448,1,B0001GSPNW,"Oh Jeez, what a load of hogwash. It appears as though someone has cut and pasted images of the past, and created an unbelievable story line to it.

All the credible images are clear (Such as the German V-2, V-1 rockets) and all non-credible images (The Honey Bell UFO) nothing but blurred tacky images, which the narrator then makes something out of. ""Conspiracy!"" What the.....!!!

If you believe in this, then you surely believe in pigs can fly!

Can't believe that this is able to be purchased on Amazon!

Thank you for ruining my buying experience from Amazon, as I will never again trust, or buy a DVD that I can not physically handle.

The Disc has been burnt (copied at home by some clown, the cover, photo copied by some five-year-old.

The only person, who benefited out of this, is my dog! The Disc and Cover makes an awesome frizbi.",1095120000,8,843,4.549668874172186
8012449,3,B0001GSPNW,"I bought this DVD out of curiosity. Werner von Braun helped put us on the moon with rocketry explored in the Nazi era and later proved to be right on the mark. An interplanetary vehicle. That the Nazi's explored anti-gravity saucer vehicles and with success is unproven. Even if true, there is no way anything credible will be released. Thus, as a Knight Templar myself, I had to find out about these ""secrets revealed"" by the German Knights Templars. The creators of this hand-made disc, with its apparent marking pen jacket has bootleg written all over it. Except a bootleg of what? The secret drawings of UFO's are so sketchy it must have been drawn by a Grade school student certainly not a draftsman. The photos are likewise bogus. All in all, if you enjoy absurd tabloid material this DVD is a trip into fantasy-land. Worth the price for a diversion from reality. As for a Knight Templar connection, forget it. They should have made a DVD on the location of the Ark of the Covenant, The living descendants of Christ's family, the Illumanati etc.",1092614400,6,1051,4.686486486486486
8012450,5,B0001GSPNW,"""Nazi UFO Secrets of World War II"" offers a fascinating alternative to the more commonly accepted extraterrestrial explanation for the UFO phenomenon. According to this excellent little documentary, the enormous proliferation of UFO sightings during and after World War II can be traced back to the German weapons makers and their amazing use of electro-gravity to power their own manmade ships.
The documentary makes skillful use of a tremendous wealth of very authentic looking photos, some of them never before seen, that are matched against detailed blueprints taken directly from the drawing boards of Nazi scientists. While much of this kind of information has been rumored to exist for a long time, the case has never been so convincingly and credibly made before.
The opening narration of ""Nazi UFO Secrets of World War II"" claims that most of the photos and technical diagrams were a secret gift to the filmmakers from the Knights Templar, who had guarded the proof of the legends about Nazi UFO technology for many years. Whatever the source was, the documentary offers the most concrete proof to date that the many thousands of sightings reported over the last sixty years may have been of home-grown flying machines that far exceed what the public has been told about the level of human technological achievements thus far.
Many of the ships appear to bear the sign of the Nazi cross on their outer skin, which is shown in several of the more dramatic photos, in the same way that an airplane would bear insignia on its wings and fuselage. This is further borne out by actual newsclippings from ""The New York Times"" in which U.S. soldiers in Europe reported seeing colored spheres flying both singly and in clusters during the latter part of the war. The documentary also credits the famous ""foo-fighters"" to the Germans, which flies in the face of the more familiar theory that neither the Allies nor the Axis powers knew their real origin.
The idea that the Germans were using a secret base in Antarctica to house and maintain their so-called UFOs is examined, and Admiral Byrd's famous exploratory trip to the frozen south is explained as a military attack on the Nazi stronghold disguised as a scientific mission. Apparently, our forces were no match for the Nazi airships, which shot down several of our planes and forced Byrd's troops to retreat.
The documentary even claims that a German UFO went on a one-way Kamikaze trip to Mars, which was reportedly easily within the ship's ability. However, it was not possible for the ship to make the long trip home, and it is assumed that the crew simply died on the Red Planet, having found no one there to welcome them.
To their credit, the makers of ""Nazi UFO Secrets of World War II"" also acknowledge the fact that UFOs have been seen since ancient times, usually accompanied by the Ufonauts promise that they would return someday. There is no easy way to dismiss one theory in favor of the other, and the complete explanation for UFOs remains a true mystery. Whether the UFOs are indeed extraterrestrial or are instead something manmade is a question that will continue to haunt believers for some time to come.
Be that as it may, though, this DVD is undeniably fascinating, some of the most engrossing 50 minutes you're likely to spend any time soon, mostly because of the photographic evidence and the way it is linked to actual drawings made by Nazi draftsmen years before Kenneth Arnold's 1947 watershed sighting over the mountains of Washington. If you've neglected this part of your UFO education up to this point, watching ""Nazi UFO Secrets of World War II"" is a great way to be brought up to speed.",1084320000,13,3672,4.839427662957075
