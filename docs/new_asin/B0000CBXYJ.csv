1918235,1,B0000CBXYJ,"most disappointing. bought this movie thinking it was the original ""Jock of the Bushveld"" but instead got an absolute botch up.  editing was probably done by a 2 year old.  this movie is a mockery of the orignal and the book.  don't make the same mistake I did and get this movie thinking it was ""jock of the Bushveld"" African version. Just shows how mainstream movie makers think that by throwing in a big name actor (Robert Urich) they'll make it better than the original.  In my opinion the original vs. this movie are not even in the same league.",1115510400,26,550,4.47
1918236,1,B0000CBXYJ,"I remember loving the original SA version of this movie, and thought prehaps I was buying that one. When it arrived I realised that it was the USA version, and I thought, well, why not give it a try. What an awful movie. Everything was implied, nothing shown on screen, it was boring and pointless, and meandered aimlessly through the countryside. They managed to ruin a wonderful story and a legend all in one go. My husband after watching asked if the dogs were meant to be potrayed as totally dumb animals! Jock was a hero, a wonderful dog and there is a monument to him in the Kruger Park. This movie ruins the whole idea of Jock, and all I can do is urge you to try and find the South African Version, or read the book Jock of the Bushveld by Sir Percy Fitspatrick, to get the real story! I fear that some of the reviews stating that it is a wonderful movie, are by people who have watched the SA version and confused it with this one, as I don't understand how anyone could endorse this movie.",1097971200,37,999,4.2631578947368425
1918237,1,B0000CBXYJ,"After having seen the original ""Jock of the bushveld"" which was a South African production, this version seems rather sparse and condensed. The acting in this version seems rather awkward at times and this version was rather disappointing.

I cannot recommend this version.",1093910400,11,273,5.348837209302325

7998851,5,B0000CBXYJ,This is just a sweet movie of a man and his dog. I just loved it and I wish the dog didn't loose his hearing but still a great movie,1392076800,,132,3.433333333333333
7998852,5,B0000CBXYJ,"From the playground, to the Boss' office, to the hospital; all of us have faced a giant while we're standing before him with just a sling and a stone. That's what makes this movie so great. YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF IN THIS MOVIE. There are no Rambos here. Which underdog is YOU?
And in the end, rejoyce in everybody's victories!
This is also an excellent tool to teach young people that sometimes it takes years of blood sweat and tears to break down a door.",1377475200,,456,4.376470588235295

7998854,4,B0000CBXYJ,This is a classic South African story that takes place in the late 1800's about a young man who is goes to find gold and along the way rescues the runt of a litter who becomes his constant companion.  It tells of his adventures in the bush and many encounters with  wild animals and Jock's courage.  This is an amazing story that is sure to elicit an emotional response.,1200614400,,370,4.333333333333333
7998855,1,B0000CBXYJ,"I too was really dissappointed in the remake of this film, I honestly thought I was buying the original I saw in South Africa as a child. The whole film just seems so unenthusiastic, even the ending is not as it was in the book or original film. Alot of the scenes do not match the book as the original film did. Im sending the film back as I am now purchasing the original from ebay. what a waste of time and money!",1150243200,10,416,4.024096385542169
7998856,3,B0000CBXYJ,"I am a South African and very dissapointed that 2 whole scenes were just cut out of this movie, possibly to make it ""politically correct"". Though the scenes are disturbing it is part of the movie and must be seen in that light.  Please warn your buyers that they are buying a watered down movie and not the original.",1120953600,23,316,4.3559322033898304
7998857,1,B0000CBXYJ,"Gray Hofmeyr's 1986 version of this film was true to the book and gave your hearts some major tugs, especially at the end of the film when Jock dies. In this one, the only bright light is the late Robert Urich, who endeared himself to everyone here when he arrived to shoot his scenes.

An awful film (with a wimpy hero and an even more wimpish heroine, the actress playing the role of Lilian complained that ""South Africa is so dusty, I'm glad I don't lay bricks when I go to the toilet"") one that should be missed by all.
