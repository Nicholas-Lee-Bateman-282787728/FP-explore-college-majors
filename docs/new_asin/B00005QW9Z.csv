A catalog of the world's greatest martial arts talent is presented as a nonstop series of highlights from their videos with animated sequences and narration to explain the background to the Oriental martial arts and the many, many masters that are featured in this presentation.
According to the notes I have, it was conceived originally as a way of showcasing the quality of the studio's products (Tsunami Productions), but has grown into something of a tradition to the extent that it now includes excerpts from over 30 shows by almost as many masters.
If you have even a passing interest in genuine martial arts, or know someone who does, you should get a copy of this show. For less than the cost of a trip to your favorite fast food outlet you will get almost an hour of nonstop action highlights from the world's best fighters. Don't miss it!",1006473600,2,1043,4.673913043478261
