6333666,3,B00J5JSV3A,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

My teenage son, also a lover of movies, was bugging me to go with him to see this purported sci-fi thriller the week-end it opened. Events precluded that from happening but I finally gave in and off we went the next week. Something about the trailer, which I had seen numerous times, just put me off.

After seeing it, I think it was the Johnny Depp out of his comfort zone playing a brilliant researcher on the cutting edge of sentient science. My son, with his high expectations was disappointed. I, with my initial misgivings combined with poor reviews, was pleasantly surprised. Well pleasantly is perhaps too strong a word. I thought the film was pretty much OK, even if I shared my son's opinion that the film often dragged. It did and I believe first time director, Wally Pfister, just went overboard loading up the film with gobs of techno-babble.

My biggest issue however had to do with the illogical time jumps. After Will Castor (Depp) is shot by a member of a secret group of anti-artificial intelligence activists, his consciousness is uploaded into a giant computer that he created with the help of his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) and his best friend, Max Waters (Paul Bettany). So here's what I don't get. Will's body is turned to ash and his now widow is in charge of the company. She goes off the grid and relocates to some broken down town in the desert. Her company gets flush with cash thanks to Will's brain hacking into the stock market. She uses the money to convert the town into a huge underground laboratory. This all happens over two years and yet no one can figure out where she went. Huh? And the logistics of the construction is, well, illogical.

Putting that aside, Max is kidnapped by the A-I terrorists and over time converts to their way of thinking. Without the terrorist aspect. Putting logic aside, I found the film titillating in the ideas being offered. Certainly not anything necessarily new, the ideas of the human brain merging with a computer is always interesting. Aside from Depp, the acting is very good as is the photography. And some of the special effects were mind boggling. If the subject matter interests you, it's worth a look.",1399161600,4,2225,4.694871794871795
6333667,2,B00J5JSV3A,"This is a spoiler-free review of the theatrical release.

What begins as a plausible story spirals further out of control with each passing minute, to the point where you can no longer suspend your disbelief. In sum, it is an unsuccessful blend of several genres, mainly sci-fi, action, and romance. It was either pitched to the studios as having ""a little bit of everything for everyone,"" or it was revised from a great script into what somebody at the studio thought would draw in an audience (with Depp thrown in for good measure). A little bit of everything for everyone means that very few will be fully satisfied after viewing.

PROs
+ brings up ponderous philosophical questions relevant to the 21st century
+ Rebecca Hall was absolutely the right pick for the central character she portrays
+ as you might expect, the CGI is excellent

CONs
- technology aside, it is one unlikely scenario after another
- switches gears from philosophical sci-fi to action/adventure and back again
- tries appealing to too many crowds: Jack of a few trades, master of none
- what could have been a reasonable and potentially outstanding plot took too many liberties
- where have I seen this before?

The defining feature of Transcendence (its redeeming quality?) is its capacity to stir the intellect. It brings up questions curious minds will latch on to, and in this respect it stands out among its peers. That said, the studio obviously didn't think you'd be clever enough to see through the film's absurdity. I suppose in an age where outlandish superhero flicks are king, it's somewhat difficult to blame the studios for accepting an ""anything goes"" attitude. Problem is, this film did not take place in a Matrix or ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."" I'm a sci-fi fan if ever there was one, but I expect the possibilities of what can happen on the silver screen to match the setting and other contextual factors.",1399075200,4,2577,5.994565217391305
6333668,3,B00J5JSV3A,"The film starts out in Berkley and there is no electrical power...anywhere, perhaps. It then flashes back 5 years as there is a clash between ""neo-Luddites"" and those that want to create artificial intelligence. Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp) has the last project that wasn't destroyed...although he himself took a bullet laced with radioactive polonium and is now dying.

Will's wife and colleague Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) has the idea of sticking an electrode in Will's brain and uploading him to the computer. Will connects to the Internet and unlocks secrets of nanotechnology. He wants to use the knowledge to cure the sick, clean the air, clean the water, regrow forests, and create an army of followers with brain implants. He would become a ""God"" which scares a whole bunch of people.

The special effects were decent, but not overwhelming. Johnny Depp was lifeless in his role, as are too many science fiction characters. The film asks several questions to ponder, such as how will we know when a computer has consciousness? What are the limits we will allow robots to control our lives?

The film utilizes nanotechnology, perhaps beyond its limits. There is a new generation of devices coming out using new substances such as graphene which will make everything we own obsolete. BTW, Government facilities such as depicted in the film utilizes iris scans in Top Secret areas and not simple card swipes.

This is a slow paced cerebral science fiction film that is not for everyone.

My mom and I went to see this today, neither of us really having any idea what it was about.  I knew it had great actors in it.  I also knew it had a sci-fi type of story.  So, we decided to check it out.

It starts out interesting.  Something happens to a man that ends his life.  The lady he is with decided to put his mind into a machine.  The man, or at least his mind loose control and things start going bad.  That is it, the story as it were.

Now, this could have been a very interesting movie.  But, it was not.  The way they did it, it just drug on and on.  There seemed to be so many things happening that were not important.  I do not think anything that happened had a chance to really get into your mind, before they started adding other stuff.  Maybe the things had a purpose.  They just did not get a chance to fully develop.  I kind of liked the movie.  But, when the guy started taking over peoples bodies and there voices sounded like his, on top of there mouths not even syncing right to the speech, that was it for me.  I almost asked my mom if she wanted to leave, but to much time had gone by for us to get our $16.50 back.

They just took the story to far.  I mean, imagine if such a thing existed.  Your thoughts could be completely put into a machine.  Well, while the lady he was with was still in love with the man, though he now in a machine, it would simply be a machine, software or whatever else that was programmed to react to things and do things the way that man would have.  Not the man.  The fact that the system sounded like him when it talked seems a bit odd.  There is something even more ridiculous that happens later on.  It has to do with the man.  I will not tell you what it is.  This was one of the worst movies I've never seen.  I will never again watch it.  Awful.  Nothing went anywhere.  Just seems like a bunch of ideas put into two hours.",1399075200,12,1919,3.992063492063492

6333671,2,B00J5JSV3A,"The script had such potential to be brilliant but...
How did they get Morgan Freeman to take a part
That made him look so stupid as the scientist he
Began as? Even the FBI guy seemed more open minded to it. And Paul Bettany had only an excuse to be brainwashed by torture but jumps to the conclusion with Freeman that it needed to be destroyed.?? Making both go from Scientist to terrorist themselves with only one visit and no
Chance as colleagues to give him a chance.
Bettany guesses only it is bad or dangerous and they began to destroy with little to no evidence only fear and disbelief. Ignoring its brilliance and joining with terrorist made them both look so stupid as scientist without any research to back up their fear!!! Only Bettany seems to have lost his
Scientific mind by brainwashing and jumping to only the worse conclusion making the only two people the casters worthy of the gift reached by their sacrifice. Making the potential scientist who could have helped impossible. Ignorant and careless for human life. Might as well have made their reaction and fears no smarter than a monkey!!  Ruining any chance to consider the brilliance of him as a good human being while he races to save his lover. Never possible yet nothing he did was with bad intent and ruins the whole story by fear and ignorance only jumping to conclusions from a microscope to make them so full of fear about their theory. So he never got to find out about the soul that may have been his whole existence. Even risking Evelyns life by killing her. As was said in the beginning about the terriost and so far from scientist as they could be.
Becoming the terrorist themselves without any proof. I think their actions ruined the movie
And that became unbelievable. Shameful even.
They all were racing to get an AI and when it happened they instantly thought only the worse.
And acted the worse. Making no sense and turning them all into terrorist without any facts or proof so by the end they destroyed what they had
Wanted to achieve. Making them ridiculous.
Cause only the most brilliant and good two human beings in love get destroyed after their sacrifice
And I did not get it? Fear they turned out to be worse than the terrorist. As closed minded and
Hateful as the terrorist without any proof.
Instead of ever helping attain what they were supposed to believe and supposed to want more than anything. Made the whole movie sideways!
Ridiculous and stupid for scientist. Cause they New he was the most advanced after terrorist killed the scientist that succeeded in proving
It could be done. The only reason to watch became Johnny Depps character and his wifes
Brilliance and the rest without helping them
Made all of them look just scared and stupid.
With only bad intents and giving no scientific
Help. He seemed so willing to let them but instead
They only believed dangerous and without any research only fear and evil guesses by Bettany
Who jumps only at a worse scenario they destroy again what I said they all were trying to do.
All their actions made them as bad or worse than terrorists  cause they were scientist!  All of which
Became terrorists. Unbelievable! Could have been good if they had at least explored his outcomes
Like scientists I believe would have. Where was the champagne ? And scientists destroying the
The thing they all had worked toward?
Shameful as they knew the type man he was.
And they all were trying to do what he did?
What about life? They killed her!!!
And that ridiculous fear of Martin they killed!!
Was it their egos?  To destroy such potential
And of course he needed more power which Bettany has issue with??? They are in a deserted
Building. With only a few cores from his genius penn. How did they get Freeman to play such a
Stupid character? The fearful scientist and supposed friend of Will.
Made no sense!
Personally I wish he blew them up when they hit her!
Sadly he raced alone to get back to her.
At their surprise and still destroy was all they
Wanted to do though shocked he did make it back out of love. I could never believe scientists who worked so hard for an AI would still want to destroy such a breakthrough. Imagine if they
Worked together?
That could of been interesting and had put those terrorists nuts in jail!!!

6333683,3,B00J5JSV3A,There are some great visuals and a very interesting plot but someone decided it needed to be an action movie and that just doesnt work and thats why I think its about 2.5 stars. The romance also doesnt work because Rebecca Hall as the wife was just not the best casting choice and I have no idea why Morgan Freeman is in it. the premise is fascinating and if they had stayed the course with it and dropped off about 30-minutes it would have been a taunt little movie. Throwing in the attack scenes late in the movie didn't work and literally didn't accomplish much since they were armed with a vintage cannon and that was more comic relief than action. It seems many movies now suffer from the 2-hours+ syndrome that more often than not hurts the movie more than it helps and is likely there just so movie goers feel they got their moneys worth.

6333700,5,B00J5JSV3A,"written by Jack Paglen and directed by Wally Pfister, Transcendence tells the story of  how a quantum computer gains sentience and the collision  and conflict that results when machine and man merge. Johnny Depp plays Dr. Castor, a scientist looking for funding to back his research project to develop a thinking computer. The ""Strong Artificial Intelliegence"" as it is called, is engineered to problem solve, and with extreme programing, with neuronal engineering is said to be poised to surpass and overcome human biology. The scieintist are hoping to unlock the nature of consciousness, discover where the soul resides, and replicate it via a super quantum computer. This is called the ""singularity"".  Dr. Castor and his wife Evelyn Castor, have hopes of curing cancer, eliminating poverty, disease, hunger, all manor of ills that plague the planet and humanity.. thereby healing the planet. . The Castors present their hypothesis to a symposium filled with mathematicians, engineers, neuro-scientist, with hopes of garnering funds to further their research.
However, there is a radical  group of students and onlookers, poised to stop the researchers from any further development. The group is steeped in
fear and the ""terrorist"" group called  ""Rift"" revolutionary independence from technology,  do not accept a world with quantum technology that becomes merched with biology, no matter  how altruistic the intent.  Rebecca Hall plays Evie Castor, Paul Bettany plays Max Waters lead programmer ushering in the ""soulful element "" of ""Pinn"" the independent Neuronal network invented by Dr. Will Castor. Morgan Freeman plays the researcher and Cryptologist  Dr. Joseph Taggert, Cillian Murphy plays Donald Buchwald, FBI agent in charge of investing the bombing, the terrorist, the research, and finding out why the terrorist are trying to kill Dr. Castor, and destroy years of reseach.
The development of Strong AI has ignited deep seated fear and resentment , that manifest in the simultaneous bombing of  multiple labs across the country, killing many people, scientist and civilians.  One of the terrorist shoots Will Castor with a ""Polonium dipped isotope, radioactive radiation poisoning and the affects are irreversible. He will be dead in 5 weeks.  With the time he has left, Will decides to spend it with his wife and not in the laboratory. Since the co-ordinated attack left the bulk of the reseach in ruins, Evie decides to shut down the lab, but stumbles onto key concepts that link and click in her mind that her husband was close to the ""singularity"". Will is dying, she attempts to build the lab at home. They download Wills' conscienousness into the quantum computer. His physical body dies during the research. But is consciousness lives in the quantum computer and grows.. expands so much they all must relocate to further the work, and  Dr. Castor comes alive again to lead the research.. It starts to get really ""Supernatural"" when the environment and Will Castor become one and people from all over the desert who want treatment for ills, derive supernatural powers and this really sends RIFT into overdrive... I did not like the extreme measures the terrorist used to block the research, kidnapping Max and turning him into their ""Patsy"" , and the scene where Will Castor, in an effort to quell and calm his wifes' feelings, reads  her neuronal impulses, blood analytes, vital signs, blood chemistry and projects it all on the big screen in the lab. His power had become so immense, he could not see he crossed the line and not only had he not given it a second thought to penetrate her thoughts  he took it another step and invaded her body chemistry, physiology, brain chemistry and  mapped her anatomy and showed her. Fortunately, she knew when she  and Will got deeper and deeper into the research, anything was possible. The unthinkable happened, she was afraid of what he'd become and the only alternative was now,  for Max to create a virus, give it to Evie to trap Will and infect him, thereby infected the entire internet, threatening to throw civilization backward into the stoneage, total darkness..no more technology.  While, Dr. Castors'  comment during the synposium, before all the violence ensued, that man has always, though out time, as attempted to create God, or become a God, this is where man always gets it wrong. It may be true that the universe has a way of stoping all attempts at man overreaching .

6333716,1,B00J5JSV3A,"1.5/5  TRANSCENDENCE fails on almost every level, due to a poorly developed, leaden script. The terrorists agenda is utterly unconvincing, as is the casting of Kate Mara as their leader. Rebecca Halls character behaves irrationally, especially given that she is obviously meant to be a very intelligent woman. In fact none of the characters motivations are remotely convincing and the basic premise of the film also fails to convince mainly due to the fact that its not actually about artificial intelligence at all but is in fact about human intelligence run amok. The movie boasts a fine cast but not one of the actors seems convinced by the movie either, and they all phone in their performances accordingly. Not even the always likeable Johnny Depp can save this dour piece of nonsense. To sum up then, this is one unconvincing movie!",1500768000,,838,4.943262411347518

While I was shut down by an influenza I saw  this movie, and then, because I was curious, I looked to the early reviews. Incredible, mostly very negative statements. How can this be?

Clearly, it depends often from the point of view of the observer, from her  expectations.  And for me I was looking to a good science fiction, one, which is putting a story on the screen which is scientifically sound, which looks some years ahead, and is a good story. And there are not too much good science fiction films around; many are loaded with nice pictures but a bad science story. This film is exceptional!

It tackles the actual deep question of the future of mankind faced with the new upcoming intelligent machines, being part of a global network, enhanced with many new technologies in biotec, nano, and robotics. A huge potential to change the whole world completely in a not too far future. Who knows the real discussions of the scientist and the leading tech labs, who knows what real companies are doing, right now, for those people the film tells the story of what is going on right now.

And the film is telling a story which makes you curious, gives continuous excitement, presents you with execellent characters, deep emotions and a real deep philosophy.

I often thought for myself to write a story about these topics which are starting to change the story of the whole of mankind; for a moment I can relax; this is a damned good story.

I will tell it all my friends and to my students, to have a look to this film  and then invite a discussion: what is our view of the future to come? Have we as humans a sound opinion what we should do and what we could do?

The problem today is, that most people have no idea how far  technology actually really is and these options illustrated in the film are by far not impossible; to regenerate cells is nearby, to have nano particles is partially already reality, to have learning programs working in networks is there....

This film needs a new marketing.",1488758400,,2049,4.565573770491803

All in all, it was fantastic story about what we all would do for true love and how we all would help the world, if we had the power. It's a beautiful piece of work, and let's face it: Johnny Depp and Paul Bettany and Morgan Freeman? It's kind of a dramatic-thriller-scifi-romance, and it's very pleasant.

6333814,1,B00J5JSV3A,"I keep a loaded .380 next to me in the living room. I have never wanted to shoot my TV more than I wanted to when I sat through this blight on humanity. I owe Kevin Costner an apology for calling The Postman a phlegm-covered waste of celluloid completely devoid of logic. I mean, it's true, but I shouldn't have thought it was the worst movie I would ever see. Things can ALWAYS get worse.

I'm no expert, but I know enough about computers to know that the tech doesn't work like this. That alone would usually stop me from watching it, but it was already on and I had no place to go. There was no reason for anyone to react to Depp's character the way they did. He cured a bunch of people of their illnesses and injuries, then wanted to go on to build better computers. Suddenly everyone was gathering grenade launchers because HE MUST BE STOPPED.

If he can keep the internet from crashing when a celebrity dies AND cure blindness, WHAT IS THE DEAL? It's not like he was aggressive. He had lots of intelligent conversations, and he wasn't irrational or angry. He was open to new ideas and would have listened to their concerns. There was nothing to fear from him, but it all had to be destroyed. No one cared about the people who had been cured and saved by this guy, or that they might like be be able to hold on to things like their eyesight and their LIVES in some cases.

Depp's character may have had actual consciousness, but like the number of licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop, the world may never know. Remember that if your PC ever comes up with a cure for cancer, tell NO ONE, and blow that sucker up with heavy artillery. That's what I should have done to my TV after this piece of crap contaminated it.",1462233600,,1741,4.253776435045317

6333818,5,B00J5JSV3A,"As though it were necessary, ""Transcendence"" is another example of why reviews by film critics should be taken with a grain of salt. This movie was well done and has an intriguing premise that makes you think about what it truly means to be human and, just as importantly, humane. The topics it deals with are fairly involved, but it's worth taking the time to let what's happening in the story sink in. I think people can draw a variety of conclusions after seeing this movie, which is often the hallmark of a great film. For example, it's interesting to observe that it's often the humans in the film who behave like ruthless, plodding, goal-seeking robots and the AI who behaves like a well-intentioned soul. Do bones, blood and skin define humanity or is it something else? Can something without real bones, blood and skin have that something else? Also, is our consciousness really just a collection of physical phenomena that can be replicated? Do those phenomena define us? It's something to think about if you're into that kind of thing.

What I appreciated about this movie was how it portrayed both the potential good and the bad. The Super AI, portrayed by Depp, appeared sympathetic and deeply human, peaceful and paternalistic, and yet the threat was there. The humans arrayed against him ranged from reluctantly concerned to the fanatically opposed. You could never really develop a TV series to explore this as a fiction series because in the event that super AI does become a reality, and that it is not isolated to fulfill the function of an oracle, the evolution would proceed so rapidly and the changes it would  affect would be deployed so quickly that the series would be over before the season was half done.

We get platitudes like machines can only be logical while irrational humans will always be superior. I wish the writers in the project had looked more deeply into current brain science and AI research. I also found the dramatic presentation to come up short.

6333926,4,B00J5JSV3A,"Human emotion can contain illogical conflict, can love someone, yet hate the things that they've done. Machine can't reconcile that.
Highly regarded Cinematographer Wally Pfister makes his directing debut with a fascinating story by Jack Paglen and a splendid cast. What this film did not register with the public is unsure  perhaps because it is less an action film (though there is plenty of that) than a thought provoking one.
A quote by the main character summarizes this challenging and intelligent film well: For 130,000 years, our capacity to reason has remained unchanged. The combined intellect of the neuroscientists, mathematicians and...hackers... in this auditorium pales in comparison to the most basic A.I. Once online, a sentient machine will quickly overcome the limits of biology. And in a short time, its analytic power will become greater than the collective intelligence of every person born in the history of the world. So imagine such an entity with a full range of human emotion. Even self-awareness. Some scientists refer to this as ""the Singularity."" I call it ""Transcendence.""

Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp) is the foremost researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence, working to create a sentient machine that combines the collective intelligence of everything ever known with the full range of human emotions. His highly controversial experiments have made him famous, but they have also made him the prime target of anti-technology extremists who will do whatever it takes to stop him. However, in their attempt to destroy Will, they inadvertently become the catalyst for him to succeed-to be a participant in his own transcendence. For his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) and best friend Max Waters (Paul Bettany), both fellow researchers, the question is not if they can...but if they should. Their worst fears are realized as Will's thirst for knowledge evolves into a seemingly omnipresent quest for power, to what end is unknown. The only thing that is becoming terrifyingly clear is there may be no way to stop him.

The cast is top notch and in addition to the three mentioned above, includes Cillian Murphy, Kate Mara, Morgan Freeman, Clifton Collins, Jr., Cole Houser, Chris Garten and many others. But one star of the film that is difficult to honor adequately is the ingenious special effects genius who makes this very strange film work wonderfully.

6333928,2,B00J5JSV3A,"What starts out as an always entertaining (if far from original) premise, (dying man is uploaded to computer and becomes an AI .. well, not really an AI but a digital copy of a real guy .... and the villagers start running with the torches) quickly abandons all intelligence, artificial or otherwise, and turns into, well some people say a reboot of Watermelon Man (more like the even worse Watermelon Man II), but more like a reboot of Colossus: The Forbin Project, about a mad computer taking over the world For Our Own Good.

It's no secret that science fiction movies are still about 50 years behind science fiction literature. There have been lots of great novels written about people who have Gone Online and become ""transcendental."" My favorite is Frederik Pohl's Gateway trilogy, where in the last book his wife digitizes him and installs him in a computer system so that he won't miss all the excitement of his contributions bearing fruit ... she even provides him with a digitial copy of herself for company!

It's a very sparkly and elaborately produced movie, with lots of eye candy and it is pretty to look at. But no matter how forgiving you are, by the second act you are going to start getting angry at just how much potential was not just thrown away, but actually betrayed, by turning a potentially mind-bending movie into just another Luddite rant against the ""dehumanization"" of Big Bad Science, which is finally defeated by the guns and fists of the heroic Good Ole Boys.

If you're a fan of real science fiction, you're going to feel betrayed, too, just like with that other recent cop-out offering, Ex Machina.",1438128000,,1633,4.742957746478873

6333948,3,B00J5JSV3A,"This is a movie which could have been great but turned out to be 'pretty good' instead. You could see what they were trying to do, but It was all over the place. With more focus and more content which allowed for emotional responses instead of constantly spouting ideas it would have been much more involving. But when those moments came in which an awe inspiring idea was to be presented, there was a resounding 'clunk' instead of a piece of clear, moving dialog. I could see a scene being set up for a remarkable mind boggling statement of some sort-but the actual dialog when 'thump'!  ""We are afriad of what we don't understand'-Was the only really meaningful quote from the movie.

Also it didn't make sense to assume that an artificial intelligence with sentinence (read with a soul) would necessarily want to grow or have more and more power. Those are human characteristics, and I suppose what the AI wanted to do would depend exclusively on it's programming. With an AI there is NO connection to those things which make up the intricacies of our lives. It would have no impulse to grow or become more powerful UNLESS that were part of it's program.

I don't believe such a thing as AI is possible-it's a personification. Machines can mimic, but they aren't alive. We don't understand how awareness, self awareness, the 'soul', the 'being' came into existence or if there really IS such a thing or not. We feel it is true. To say we are a collection of biological impulses and the result of our experiences etc. really turns us into machines. Perhaps that is the true dilema, the true underlying question. Are we just machines? Or are we actual beings?

The other question is about immortality. Religion and science try to cope with these questions, science has become the new 'magic' that can somehow keep death at bay. I think it is really magical thinking, as much as some may say hopes of an afterlife are magical thinking. I hope there is an afterlife, but I hold no illusions about being immortal in this universe. That's just not possible. Even if you could become a machine with a soul, or become somehow pure energy-the universe will not last forever. The Earth will not always be inhabitable-we just don't have that kind of power.

With more careful shaping of the film and attention to what did or didn't make sense within the 'rules' of the film, this could have been a really exciting movie.",1436572800,,2412,4.652582159624413

on the money.
'Dr Will Carter'(Johnny Depp) is a leader in the field of Artificial Intelligence' when gunned down by 'Technology Extremists'
he is left with just weeks to live, the bullet had been contaminated.
He doesn't want his work to be lost, he has his mind, thoughts and emotions uploaded into a super-computer system his
intention is to achieve 'Transcendence'
He's gone, or is he, the transfer of his mind has been successful, he can again communicate with his wife 'Evelyn' (Rebecca
Hall)
The results are of concern to his long-time friend 'Max Waters' (Paul Bettany) wants to shut 'Will' down, 'Evelyn' won't allow it
she's delighted to have communication with her lost husband, it's of comfort.
The extremists led by 'Bree' (Kate Mara) attempt to shut 'Will' down, they fail, they now turn to 'Max' by taking him by force,
hoping he'll assist them in-time.
'Will' instructs 'Evelyn' to build a hi-tech complex in the outskirts of a remote town nestled in the 'New Mexico' desert, 'Brightwood'
where he hopes with 'Evelyn's' help he can continue and indeed expand his work.
'Will's' prime intention is to help mankind however he also wants to reach out beyond the screens he is now locked behind.
Former associates of 'Will' - 'Joseph Tagger' (Morgan Freeman) and Agent 'Buchanan' (Cillian Murphy) visit the complex to see
'Will's' work in action, what they see troubles them.
There is a need to shut 'Will' down, before his power is absolute, will he let those who are trying do so, can what has been created be stopped.
This is a superior and clever film that explores the boundaries, mesmerizingly brilliant.
Great cast line-up, great picture and sound quality throughout.

With experimental technology already in place, he uploads his own consciousness to the system and sparks an explosive debate when his thoughts begin to influence the internet at large. The concept is a special one, and it takes care to really look at the issue from both perspectives, which is admirable. On one side we've got Depp, who may be doing irreparable damage despite a noble goal, while on the other he's opposed by violent, kneejerking extremists who may have legitimate fears. That core argument gets a bit watered-down and oversimplified as we build to an overly neat, tidy climax, but the journey to get there is plenty rewarding and the debate itself is endlessly thought-provoking.

6334035,4,B00J5JSV3A,"Transcendence is the directorial debut of cinematographer Wally Pfister ,who normally works in collaboration with one of the great Hollywood directors,Christopher Nolan. This film presents the premise of the possibility of human beings being capable of having artificial intelligence. It stars Johnny Depp together with Rebecca Hall, Paul Bettany and Morgan Freeman.

Dr. Will Caster is a scientist motivated by curiosity about the nature of consciousness and the foremost researcher on the field of artificial intelligence. He works together with a team that includes his wife and fellow scientist,Evelyn. They are working to create a sentient machine that combines collective intelligence that is capable of human emotion as well. Unfortunately,their experiments have made them targets of anti-technology terrorists. One day,Will was shot with polonium that give him only one month to live. In the process,Evelyn and his fellow researcher,Dr. Max Waters made Will the catalyst that enabled them to succeed in their research as they were able to use Will as a participant in his own transcendence in their artificial intelligence project. Events follow as they face threats from the terrorists;Will manages to obtain omnipresence and power similar to God; and soon the morality issue as they question themselves as to whether continue with it or not.

In his first directorial debut,Pfister has succeeded in making it a visually stunning film. The visual effects are definitely wonderful and marvelous. Too bad that the screenplay written by Jack Paglen came up empty especially with the questions regarding the issues about technology that were presented in the movie. It also was boring in some parts as it fails to tackle the issues about technology due to its simplistic and somehow incoherent dialogues and it fails to provide answers with conviction about it. What's worse,it also added implausible events in the plot that would somehow confuse the viewer. Too bad that the talented cast that included Depp,Hall,Bettany and Freeman have to do with everything that the screenplay provides as their performances were limited by it.

There is too much inconsistency between the adroid-like computer consciousness that is suppose to be him and the ""him"" who was him, and you never see the human side again, in my view. The screen-play provides a moment, something that is supposed to be a sort of reveal, but the problem was if it had been him all along he'd not have to say as much, it would have shown a long time before it became a question. The ""if this weren't me I wouldn't make the decision I am making"" is quickly negated by the ""I've really been an ass for the last hour."" issue. I don't think that will spoil it for you either, the movie is an American movie - of course there is going to be a reclamation - you knew it was coming long before I said anything about it. There is the implication of a sequel, its hardly there, but there is the tiny shadow of a promise, they drop it in. Literally. That could be done better.",1427155200,2,1271,4.273858921161826
6334038,2,B00J5JSV3A,"Transcendence, the new Johnny Depp Sci-Fi flick, looks to be the first enormous $100 box office disaster of the year.  The prideful producers who include Christopher Nolan and his wife Emma Thomas stand to lose a bundle.
 The idea seems like it might work, and it might work as a much smaller budgeted film.  In the story, a world level scientist (Depp) is engaged in work that might lead to a fully functioning Artificial Intelligence.  The AI in mind would be as powerful as all the minds of all the humans that have ever lived.  That certainly is an ambitious goal and some might applaud it as a worthy goal as well.  But not all is peaches and cream in the future.  A band of Neo-Luddites (The term comes from early 19th century English workers who destroyed labor saving machines as a way to preserve their livelihood.  Movies teach us even history!)  shoot him with a polonium poisoned bullet.  In the month he has left his wife-nicely played by Rebecca Hall-and his friend and fellow scientist-played by the always interesting Paul Bettany-decide to put his brain impulses into a computer to preserve his life.
 Well, we have seen both Frankenstein and Lawnmower Man.  We know this cannot end well.  The unlikely experiment is successful.  Depp the scientist becomes one with the heretofore theoretical uber powerful AI.  For a while all seems to go well.  The Depp/AI being does good work.  It rapidly advances the science of nanotechnology to the level of magic.  It cures the blind, the halt and the ill.
 In the mean time the Neo-Luddites scheme to destroy the beast that the rest of the world thinks is benign if they know of it at all.  Kate Mara plays the leader of the anti-science underground with a kind of bland fanaticism that failed to convince.
 Eventually some CIA types join the Luddites in a final attack on the Depp/AI stronghold.  They are thwarted by the man/machine.  It turns out that the people cured of various maladies also fell under the control of the un-natural entity.  They can be directly controlled by the super brain of the entity and have super powers.  The super brain suffuses the planet with his nanos.  The world is on the brink of eliminating old fashioned biological life and replacing it with more efficient electronic forms of life.
 The good guys win in the end.  This seems like a nice little sci-fi film, doesnt it?  It might have been if they had left it alone.  The makers tacked on a superfluous extra ending which only confused the story, a plot element that floats alone at the end of the picture which is unconnected to anything that went before.  They took a nice little $20 million fantasy and wrecked it at the end.  Oh, they also squandered $100 to make this mistake.  Oops.
 Morgan Freeman and Cillian Murphy also appear.  Cillian Murphy plays a more or less conventional role as an FBI agent instead of his usual creepy, chilling characters.  Freeman as always graces the screen with his presence.  However the efforts of all these actors cannot save the film.
 Director Wally Pfister comes out for his first gig with Transcendence.  He is widely known and widely regarded for his long career as a cinematographer.  He grabbed the golden statue with his Academy Award in Cinematography for the magical film Inception.  He has 43 other credits as a cinematographer.  I must say that the film has many examples of magnificent photographic beauty.  Visual beauty cannot save the film either.
 First time writer Jack Paglen wrote the script.  This is his first chance at the Hollywood brass ring and he missed it.  In the last third of the film the grim logic of the first two thirds collapses into absurdity and finally at the very end into incoherence.  Perhaps the producers messed around with Paglens words.
 You can safely miss this two saw blade sci-fi failure.  The PG-13 film wasted money that came all the way from China to make the movie.  It runs exactly two hours, two hours that can be better spent elsewhere.",1427068800,,3982,4.7082728592162555

6334111,5,B00J5JSV3A,"Every now and again the Hollywood machine does something exceptional; instead of churning out formulaic flash-bang blockbusters somebody actually puts some effort into producing a clever and thought-provoking sci-fi movie. This last occurred with the mind boggling Cloud Atlas and has mostly happened again with Transcendence with its interesting take on the age-old is technology a threat to humanity? question.

There is, of course, a huge helping of suspension of disbelief to swallow. Once you accept the central premise that a human consciousness can be uploaded to a computer and can then proliferate to every computer on the internet, becoming hyper intelligent in the process, then everything else that follows is entirely plausible, even the nano-tech stem cell stuff.

The scene opens with coordinated attacks on AI research teams by anti-technology luddites. AI research poster boy, Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp) is given a fatal dose of polonium so has only weeks to live. His co-researcher and wife (Evelyn - Rebecca Hall) and close friend (Max - Paul Bettany) accelerate Wills research, uploading his consciousness into a computer. Max, however, is unsure that the computer entity is a complete human consciousness and mistrusts its motivations.

Ever since Frenchmen started throwing shoes into looms there have been people that cannot accept progress, choosing to ignore its benefits, focussing only on the risks. The movie subtly (perhaps) manipulates the viewers sympathies; firstly siding with the upload efforts, then with the luddites, then with the digital Wills altruism, then with the ludditesand so on. The writing is clever in this respect; there are no intrusive special effects or action sequences to distract the viewer, just an even paced narrative that allows time for the viewer to actually think about what is being presented, so when the sympathy switches occur they feel intuitive rather than clumsy plot devices.

We really enjoyed this film, all the way through to the suitably enigmatic ending, but it won't be for everybody. If you're expecting the aforementioned flash-bang blockbuster you could be disappointed, but if you like to give the little grey cells a bit of a work-out on the sofa from time to time then this reworking of an ancient theme could be for you.",1421539200,,2306,5.258152173913044

6334113,2,B00J5JSV3A,"I don't know what it is about Johnny Depp, but I can't follow any of his movies except Pirates of the Caribbean (and that film series stinks anyway because it's just a bunch of exaggerated play-like dancing and unconstructive sword slicing).

Transcendence is beyond weird.  It's a whole other category of weird.  Hard to follow?  Oh yeah, BIG time.  Unquestionably due to the plot being unlike anything else I've ever seen.  Comparing the movie to anything else isn't a possibility.  A scientist kicks the bucket and returns inside a computer much to the pleasure of his wife who's at least happy he's returned in another form because that's better than the man being gone forever, right?  Played by the gorgeous Rebecca Hall, her attractive eyes is reason enough to watch this movie.  However this crucial part of the story doesn't even occur until 30 minutes in- the first 30 minutes of the film is pathetically dreadful fluff material that's a complete waste of our precious time because nothing worthy of storyline potential occurs.  Typical Johnny Depp film- very little depth involved but likes to play lead role of a big Hollywood produced movie to disguise this fact.

While it may seem like the attention is going to focus on Rebecca Hall having a newfound relationship with her dead lover scientist who's now part of a computer program capable of processing information at amazing speeds and even comes equipped with the ability to actually see Rebecca from the computer monitor, this aspect of the story is surprisingly short-lived.  The plot then goes in a different direction that totally loses me.  Now suddenly the attention is all about fixing up a rundown town in the middle of a desert for the purpose of an even greater creation, that being to make the entire planet (I think) extremely intelligent by eliminating everything that's unintelligent (I guess).  A perfect world with beautiful trees flourishing with life everywhere, clean drinkable water and all the smart cookies walking around healthy and advanced. Sounds like a wonderful thought.

Somehow making everyone super smart involves a revolutionary technology that allows struggling people with their own personal shortcomings to be completely healthy such as the blind man who can now see after a computer shoots a laser beam into his eyes, and the people fixing up the town are not your ordinary construction crew because upon being shot by several bullets, they're able to stand up again a moment later and get their revenge by running towards the gunmen inside a jeep travelling across the desert sand.  Oh and it gets even more bizarre- sometimes millions of misty black particles float up towards the sky after a rainfall and magically rebuild any piece of outdoor equipment that was part of an explosion or gun shooting just a short time earlier.  Visually beautiful, but logically puzzling.  At least occasionally the man reborn inside the computer remains part of the story as he evolves and advances his skills, just in time for Rebecca Hall to conclude he's now totally out of line because he's developed the ability to obtain her deepest most personal thoughts.  Yeah I wouldn't continue dating someone who can do that either!

I can appreciate this film for being fascinatingly weird, but storyline-wise it's sure not fascinatingly interesting.  Like I said earlier, the first 30 minutes are just downright flat, uninspiring and accomplish extremely little.  The weirdness of the plot just about seals the deal that not only does Johnny Depp take pleasure in being the weirdest movie star in Hollywood with the strongest desire to participate in bloated storytelling films, but that Transcendence is too bizarre for its own good.  If you're able to make sense of at least half of the things taking place in Transcendence, you've accomplished more than the average person without question.

At the end of the day, the storyline is just awful despite its attempt to be original and creative due to the confusion factor and a noticeable lack of excitement.  The lack of excitement is mostly due to the unusual pacing where things just happen spontaneously, but I suppose not all science fiction films have to make total sense to be memorable which explains the high ratings here on amazon.  I wouldn't go so far as to say I hate this movie.  More like I just find it bafflingly strange.  If the first 30 minutes weren't so boring I might've considered re-watching this movie just based on the storyline weirdness alone.",1421366400,,4509,4.976

6334118,3,B00J5JSV3A,"We've all seen ""Transcendence"" before, well, any of us who have watched ""Frankenstein"" or mad scientist- robot movies. Because that is what this film is. Nothing new to see here, except how they work out the plot which they simply want to repeat while seeming to be relevant. If you can take that, read on to see how they work it out.

Some Spoilers:

The film follows the questions of ""Frankenstein"" (in all its reincarnations) while adding the twist first seen in Hammer's ""Revenge of Frankenstein"", where Dr. Frankenstein becomes his own monster. In that film (highly recommended, BTW) the last scene shows us the resurrected ""Dr. Frank"" fastidiously washing hands while preparing to meet with a patient, presumably having overcome the earlier mob and cheating death to continue living his dream of creating everlasting life.

So too, in this film, likable but too head-in-the-clouds computer scientist Will (akin to Dr. Frankenstien in Frankenstein movies) played by Johnny Depp, becomes his own experiment, thanks to the aid of his wife, likable and really mad scientist, Evelyn (akin to Lady Frankenstein -- when the Doctor has a wife-- of the Frankenstein movies), played by Rebecca Hall.

They are a love pair, and love is eternal in sci-fi-horror. Hence, their side of the plot. But, we can't have all the blood and gore of a mad surgery, so it is replaced with the clean and crisp advance of digital tech, and man becomes machine, or marries one, or blends with one... well you get the idea -- to cheat death, Rebecca downloads Will's consciousness into a supercomputer. Of course you knew THAT from the trailers, so it isn't much of a spoiler... and it isn't a new concept either. Star Trek did it over 40 years ago to Mr. Spock -- with equally disastrous results for civilization. Which is the goal of this film as well, minus the sermon from Captain Kirk.

Depp and Hall are good actors, but their characters -- fitting in with the machines -- computers, AI whatever -- they work with, have extremely downplayed emotions. It's hard to relate to them, and the only reason to like them is because of how they got into their mad experiment. While like Frankenstein, they want to create a new race (this time of machines), they are content to discuss it and experiment while not actually accomplishing anything. So to move them along, a handy-dandy group of cyber terrorists -- who resent the advancement of technology --  kill a bunch of techs, and give Will radiation poisoning. You can guess the next part of the film, well, the whole thing really... Lady Frankenstein, in her effort to save hubby, downloads his consciousness into a super computer and our monster is born. Or is it? Is the new creation Will, or a super computer, or the birth of ""Sky Net"" from ""The Terminator"", or perhaps, the creation of God?

The problem is, we don't know. Like the original novel ""Frankenstein"" the definitions of what constitutes a monster and who IS the monster are very blurred. Early ""Frankenstein"" movies managed that by making the monster totally defective (usually with a defective brain) so it was easy to figure out.

But today's audience can handle the problems that faced Mary Shelly's audience almost 200  years ago so the movie presents the conflict between two unacceptable alternatives. Either Depp and Hall's vision cyber AI will succeed, or the terrorist-mob will succeed. As is so characteristic of the 21st century American film products, we only have black and white. there is no gray and no compromise. Many people might like to see the world this way, but it really is a Technicolor place, not a lo res fax. However, the film seems to pander to those who are in the only B&W us-vs-them camp.

And thus this move plods along (it is very slow) presenting us with reasons to like and hate both sides of the argument, until one of them wins. The problem is that no matter which side wins in this move, humanity is screwed. If the Depp-Hall creation wins, we might have something like ""Sky-Net"" and the Terminator. And if the terrorists win, we will have an end of civilization as we know it because all at once, our technology will fail - Y2K and Armageddon-Rapture style.

I'll let you watch the movie to see which of the two happens.

Overall:

The film is well acted, well costumed and has good scenery. It triggers our emotions, mostly negative ones. Of course there are the required bloody assaults and explosions (you simply HAVE to blow things up in movies these days!). But in spite of this, perhaps because the script is so down, or the emotions are so underacted, the film isn't very satisfying. You'd have a better time watching an old Frankenstein film.",1421107200,,4684,4.767901234567901

6334122,2,B00J5JSV3A,"This is very much a movie for people who think that SpongeBob SquarePants is ""deep."" It's basically Mary Wollstonecraft Shelly's Frankenstein mixed in with the most recent version of The Day The Earth Stood Still. The ""science"" is hilariously inept and best skipped over as it's really just magic dressed up with some inept quasi-computer jargon necessary to force the characters forward in what passes (barely...) for a plot. The writers must have thought that they were cleverly avoiding the ultimate clich with their ending (the computer consciousness is trying to save the world by shutting down all modern technology so the Earth can be healed) but even a fraction of a second's thought is enough for any audience member not yet comatose to think, ""wait a moment, that means 90% of people in the developed world will be dead within 90 days..."" so in fact it turns out, accidentally, to be just another ""fear of technology"" movie after all, albeit unintentionally because the writers didn't bother to think it through.

As for the cast's performances, the word ""wooden"" would be charitable. But with such a tedious script to work from it's amazing they bothered to show up on set at all, so we can't blame them for marching through their lines with no enthusiasm and no effort.

I don't know why Hollywood movies always assume the audience is so brain-dead that no coherence, consistency, or logical progression is required - but that's the bottom line and so we get tripe like this atrociously pointless piece of silliness. I've really got to tell my friends that life is too short for me to indulge them by watching stuff like this.",1420934400,,1638,4.8464285714285715
6334123,5,B00J5JSV3A,"""Transcendence"" is great! This is how the story goes: Dr. Will Caster is the foremost researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence, working to create a sentient machine that combines the collective intelligence of everything ever known with the full range of human emotions. His highly controversial experiments have made him famous, but they have also made him the prime target of anti-technology extremists who will do whatever it takes to stop him. However, in their attempt to destroy Will, they inadvertently become the catalyst for him to succeed-to be a participant in his own transcendence. For his wife Evelyn and best friend Max Waters, both fellow researchers, the question is not if they can...but if they should. Their worst fears are realized as Will's thirst for knowledge evolves into a seemingly omnipresent quest for power, to what end is unknown. The only thing that is becoming terrifyingly clear is there may be no way to stop him.

The cast led by Johnny Depp (solid as Dr. Will Caster) is great. The directing by Wally Pfister is great. The story & screenplay by Jack Paglen is great.

The music by Mychael Danna is great. The cinematography by Jess Hall is great. The film editing by David Rosenbloom is great. The casting by John Papsidera is great. The production design by Chris Seagers is great. The art direction by Tom Frohling, Gregory S. Hooper, Bjarne Sletteland, Dawn Swiderski & Clint Wallace is great. The set decoration by Gene Serdena, set designs by Aric Cheng, Nancy Deren, Timothy M. Earls, Ricardo Guillermo, Scott Herbertson, Sally Thornton, Ron Yates & Siobhan Roome, set dressings by Katie Childs, Derek Dean, Brian DeNike, David Holowach, Adam Montoya, Jesse Oliver, Darren Patnode, George Brenner, Vincent Busecma, Jr., Gary Eilan, Lonam R. Fogleman III, Michael Garcia, Miguel A. Garcia, Graham Griswold, Nikki Kris, Paul Matthews, Kevin M. Pierce, James A. Fleming, Ray Garcia, Alfonso Lima, Erasmo Lima, Robert Pollard & Joshua Towers are great. The costume design by George L. Little is great. The special effects coordinated by Scott R. Fisher are great. The visual effects coordinated by Genevieve Claire, Sze Jia Eng, Eunice Khoo & Katie Stetson and supervised by Nathan McGuinness are great. The stunts coordinated by Wade Allen & Darrin Prescott are great. The make-up effects by Luisa Abel are great.

This is a great and different sci-fi film that is intriguing and interesting. This is a great directorial debut from Wally Pfister, the cinematographer behind ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""The Prestige"" & ""Memento"". Johnny Depp gives another solid performance as Dr. Will Caster & Rebecca Hall (as Evelyn Caster), Paul Bettany (as Max Waters) & Morgan Freeman (as Joseph Tagger) are also solid in a supporting cast that is also solid, as well, too. This was one of the best sci-fi films of last year.",1420934400,,2876,5.076109936575053

Is the human person, gasp, scratch head, could it be ..... a synergistic composite of biology and something else truly wondrous that we might never fully understand? And then there were those cringy bit, you know, sappy moments with saccharine music that seemed to do nothing more than get the oxytocin flowing. And then there was that ending.

Most folks fail to realize that vicarious movie/propaganda videos dump ALMOST as much horrid chemicals like cortisol in one's blood stream as the real event would if one were there in the midst of it. No thanks.

Anyway--this movie--I didn't skip or fast forward much at all. The relationship stuff, interactions, dialogue, characters etc. captured and maintained my interest way above average.

The ending seemed to be muffled or bungled a bit but it was still a thought-provoking movie.

Certainly TPTB and various scientists in their demonized control are playing with worse than the fires of hell . . . for REAL . . . in our era . . .

6334144,4,B00J5JSV3A,"Johnny Depp (as well as a few other actors) has been one of my favorite actors for many years. But despite his acclaimed Public Enemies performance, his filmography has not been as impressive as it once was. And after my disappointment in last year's The Lone Ranger, I was beginning to lose faith in Johnny Depp as an actor. So naturally when I heard about this year's movie Transcendence, it was released in April as expected, and as I initially expected, got mostly bad reviews. So therefore, I had no interest in the movie. But just a few days ago, I decided to take a chance with the movie. And much to my astonishment, I like Transcendence A LOT more than I thought I would.

When we meet Will and Evelyn Caster, Will is at a sort of seminar. He has this idea-this theory behind technology/ AI(artificial intelligence). Not long after a shocking mishap, Will's wife Evelyn decides to take matters into her own hands thus beginning the story of Transcendence.

This may not be a highlight in Johnny Depp's career, but I found myself enjoying his performance as Will Caster throughout the course of the movie. It is really fulfilling to see Johnny Depp to transition to character. I admire the intelligence and the mysterious tone he brings to the character of Will. Equally impressive here is Rebecca Hall who portrays Evelyn. In my opinion, she has the better performance of the movie. And the chemistry between these two helps to drive the movie's plot. Paul Bettany and Morgan Freeman star as Max and Joseph, and I liked both their performances.

The story in Transcendence is what makes this movie so interesting. The 2nd act is occasionally slow, but the intrigue and thought of Transcendence is something that sticks with you. Some have called the plot unfocused and I quote""tries to do more than it should"" but I politely disagree. Transcendence not only left me with the ""what if"" questions and ""you never know"" type thoughts- but the movie itself  makes a serious statement that is ""people fear what they don't understand."" Transcendence works best as a movie due primarily to the acting, the direction, and the thought provoking storyline.

I realize that Transcendence has received a great deal of dislike, and I am not saying ""go buy this movie"", but I do consider Transcendence to be a much better movie than some would give it credit for in my opinion. I myself would even call it underrated. Transcendence may not be groundbreaking or the best movie of 2014, but I will say give Transcendence a watch and my sincere hope is that you enjoy it.

6334168,3,B00J5JSV3A,"Irony it is that the title to this slow boil science fiction yarn is more likely to make the viewer yawn and check their watch than it is to thrill and make one dream of the possibilities.  But oh, well.  The movie is okay, grounded by Evelyn Caster (actress Rebecca Hall) who is the wife of Will Caster (actor Johnny Depp, walking through this movie like he was in some sort of daze after being hit by a stun gun or something) who holds onto her husband as he slips coldly away into the soulless omniscience of a computerized god.  Rebecca Hall is good, and her acting and emotion raises the movie's bar just a bit to make this all the more tolerable.

As many Sci Fi movies are this movie is good to generate discussion.  I find it interesting that in mankind's search for transcendence (becoming something greater than we are) in the movies we always lose our ""humanity"", that trait of emotional and spiritual connectedness to one another, and thus become godlike monsters who have to be overcome and destroyed (nowadays, unplugged).  It's like going back to the garden of Eden and biting into that apple thinking we are to become more and finding that, though we do, we also become far, far less in the process.  At least there's some comfort in the biblical narrative where there is a Creator God who loves His creation and continues to try and woo them back despite that which they have become.  The Master molder who continues to reshape and strengthen his clay.  The shepherd who seeks after his lost sheep.  Now there's transcendence.",1419724800,,1543,4.598540145985401

6334195,5,B00J5JSV3A,"What if one day our technological advances reached a point where the boundary between ""artificial intelligence"" (AI) and ""human consciousness"" disappeared?

That is the premise of this ""AWESOME"" movie!

I must admit that at first I was a little weary due to reviews that suggested that this is a movie intended for the ""intelligent"" and therefore requires close attention to dialogue. I feared that its ""entertainment value"" would be compromised by the weight of the subject matter. I took the chance and was VERY glad that I did!

This movie had everything mixed into it! The magic of Hollywood in its amazing special effects, a deep plot, romance, and a ""perfect"" reflection of the human condition!

The movie starts off with everything going well for Will Caster (Johnny Depp)and his beautiful wife. He doesn't seem to care much for the fame and fortune that are the byproducts of true genius, but he goes through the motions simply out of his love for his wife, who is his research sidekick.

As in real life, anything can happen at anytime and this unexpected derailment is represented by a religious fundamentalist who does something to Mr. Will Caster. A perfect depiction--in my humble view--of the closed minded, religious fanaticism that cares not about any form of advancement (development) whether technological or psychological. Such immature level of development is the ""real"" and ""actual"" toxic poison to the human mind (many minds) in real life. This tragedy is depicted in the movie as an object that poisons Will, challenging his ""will"" to live, as the doctor tells him he has but a few days.

I love how Johnny Depp's character says: ""It just doesn't make sense. They are afraid of technology because it is a threat to humanity, yet they don't flinch at taking a life.""

Our human fear of what we ""don't"" understand is further reflected through a group that would be comparable to our Green Peace ethnocentrists. They are staunch separatists that want to save humanity from being overtaken by the infiltration of a ""collective consciousness"" on the ""individual.""

The human fear of ""Transcendence"" is so strong that even Will's wife begins to doubt and fear her own husband's mind, now that it has merged with the collective. At one point Will's wife learns that Will can see even her most subtle mood shifts. He knows when she is sad, afraid, excited--all by the changes in her internal biochemistry. When she finds this out, she yells out at him ""you are NOT allowed!"" and walks away. Echoing our egocentric resistance and fear to loosing a boundary that in ""Reality"" never actually existed to begin with!

After this scene, I thought to myself ""wouldn't some wives 'want' their husbands to be keenly aware of their most subtle mood chances? Isn't this very 'disconnect' what most women complain about? That we don't understand them? That we don't know how they feel as women? For me, this scene depicted our different perceptions ""dependent"" on our own level of psychological maturity. Our own technological advancement, if you will.

I don't want to say too much more, for fear of spoiling this great adventure for you. This movie was very well done, it had a perfect cast of characters and it was very well acted.

I watched three movies this weekend and this one was ""definitely"" the one that left an indelible imprint in my psyche. For me, it perfectly represented our own psychological development towards the realization of the underlying ""no-boundary"" Reality, and our resistance to this most natural ""transcendental"" linear flow. A serious, intelligent matter, executed in an exciting, spellbinding format!

Enjoy!",1418774400,,3644,4.9950495049504955

6334207,4,B00J5JSV3A,"This movie has an issue.  I don't mean there's an issue with the movie but there's an issue within the movie.  Transcendence asks us, ""When is enough enough?""  This movie raises a great moral issue.  If the ability existed, would it be right to ""upload"" one's mind into a computer?

Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp), a brilliant man of science has figured a way to upload his mind/being into a computer.  His wife, Evelyn (Rebecca Hall), another great scientist, is at first thrilled with the fact that her deceased husband is now with her.  Two things the new Will need are power in the electrical form and power in the ability to influence or control.  As one progresses, the other does as well.  Soon Will's needs must be met by fields upon fields of solar panels.  Actually, there are three issues with this movie.  (1)  Is this really Will?  (2)  Is this PINN gone out of control?  (3)  Is this moral?

The acting is actually less an issue than the dilemma.  The first part of the movie is truly engaging.  However, as the movie progresses, the engagement lessens and lessens.  It is up to each viewer to decide.",1418428800,,1114,4.53030303030303

6334225,2,B00J5JSV3A,"As a big Christopher Nolan fan, I've long been a fan of his cinematographer, Wally Pfister's work, so I was excited to hear he was working on his directorial debut, and even more excited when I heard about its subject matter, as I'm fascinated by futurism and speculations on transhumanism. Some reviewers found the movie's premise ridiculously far fetched, but many credible futurists (such as Ray Kurzweil) contend these events are not only possible but probable, and in the relatively near future, so what I heard of the story pushed all the right buttons for me.

To my great disappointment, it turns out my beef with the movie is not its premise - which could have been fascinating, handled more deftly - but rather with its execution, which is crushingly unconvincing. It doesn't help that Johnny Depp's performance is near catatonic, or that he is ludicrously unbelievable as a genius renegade scientist. Neither does the movie's central love story between Rebecca Hall and Johnny Depp's characters work, as there's zero chemistry between the two and the dissonance between the actors' performance styles (hers: earnestly emotive, his: wooden but faintly ironic, which chafes against the movie's attempts at emotional resonance) creates a tonal problem that makes the whole film ring false.

The lesson of this failure for Pfister is that being a brilliant cinematographer - having the eye for telling someone else's story visually - doesn't make you a storyteller yourself. Pfister needs to stick to what he's good at and leave storytelling to those who understand an audience cannot be made to care about characters and the situations in which they are put if the characters do not ring true.",1417910400,,1701,5.071428571428571

6334296,2,B00J5JSV3A,"The story contains very interesting ideas, is very thought provoking and attempts to tackle some issues surrounding Artificial Intelligence and nano-technology. The story is presented in is essentially one long flashback. The main ideas that the story attempts to tackle are subjects that can be somewhat frightening when you take them to the logical end, but they are worth considering. I don't know if this was a film adaptation or an original story. I will say that the story is depressing.

There are some plot holes as big as the Grand Canyon in this film, but some will not be noticeable to a non-techie or someone not familiar with the ramifications of AI and nano-tech. The big problem is that the author(s) took these ideas into a interesting direction, and then sort of stop their development. Without spoiling anything, it's at the point when the author stops carrying the  ideas further along that the plot holes open up and and swallow the story whole. I'm not sure it could have been done any other way, and I'm not routing for a happy ending, but I want truthful story telling. It feels like the author(s) grabbed a Hollywood cliche and ended the film the way they did and basically chose the cop-out route. It feels cheap.

Would I recommend the film to friends? No, not really. The acting overall was okay, not spectacular, most of the characters were very wooden and the story is so gloomy. Very few people I know would dig it. Techies or anyone familiar with AI will pull it apart and expose the flaws real quick.",1415836800,,1532,4.687732342007435

Or just, ""What's going on with that?""

Overall it gives me the impression of a movie based on a really good book, but in turning it into a movie the director had to leave so much of the background of the plot out, the movie audience has to ""fill in the blank"" way too often.

The movie starts out where the entire world or at least the entire U.S is without power and you start asking ""what in the world happened to the power? Someone explain.""

But it would have been at the expense of our individuality, our privacy and our freedom.  And if you ask me, that's a price that's too high.

The special effects were good, and the acting wasn't bad.  Frankly the best performance of the whole movie was given by Morgan Freeman.  Johnny Depp just seemed like he was phoning in his performance.  And honestly he was just a 2D image on a screen for most of the movie, so if you'll excuse the saying, his acting fell flat.

This is worse than ""Prometheus"" and that's saying something.
If you know ANYTHING about anything, especially computers and the internet in general, than this is even worse than I could describe. I suppose if it was 1968 and this came out it might be good, but I doubt it. This is really just a ham fisted, blunt movie.
If the director is bucking for Roland Emmerich's crown as the King Of Crap, he's got a looooong way to go.
Even Morgan Freeman, who I love, is wasted in this piece of garbage.
This movie could be one of the reasons people stop going to movies. It's so awful, behind the times, and just loaded with buzz phrases that it should be permanently removed from the human record.
There are so many hackneyed cliches it's hard to even discuss.
I hated it the minute I started it, but when the main actress, who, come on, she looks like Scarlett Johannson..when she checks into the hotel under the name ""Turing, I guess"" it pretty much destroys the entire film.
She's working with her douchebag husband on computer intelligence and she's never heard of the Turing test?
Is this supposed to be nerd bait from 1979?
This movie just blows. AND sucks.
I actually feel like I know less from watching it.
""Archer"" is better than this.
In fact, I would even dare to say that Shakespeare is more entertaining than this. And that's not entertaining at all.
One of the worst films I've ever seen, and I watched part of one of the recent ""Star Wars"" prequels. Those were practically ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" compared to this steaming pile.
Avoid this movie at all costs. Pure garbage. This movie is so bad I don't think one could even watch it ironically.
I tried giving this ""zero"" stars, but Amazon wouldn't let me. This does not deserve anyone's attention. Ever.

6334389,4,B00J5JSV3A,"AI, Artificial Intelligence, yes or no.  The movie is aptly titled, Transcendence, which most viewers will not understand what that term means.  It is most commonly used in Theology to describe God as a being who is not limited by time and space or any other limitations living, organic beings like humans experience.  The movie is based on the idea that a human mind, once downloaded into multiple gigantic, latest and best computers will be able to do, see and learn and manipulate so much more than any human could do regardless how brilliant and knowledgeable they are.  This downloaded brain will transcend all the limitations of time, space, knowledge and human needs like sleep and food, because the mind will exist in these super computers and across the worldwide internet and all the computers attached to the internet.

AI has been a concept for some time now in the computer world.  It is like the Holy Grail or the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  The idea in AI is can man produce a computer/machine that can be creative and solve problems on its own like a human does without a programmer producing new software for every new task/problem the computer/machine has to perform.  In this movie, the downloaded brain of a brilliant guy in computers and AI becomes like God in transcending all the limitations of a human being.

Surprisingly I only realized at the end the movie becomes a futuristic, high tech Romeo and Juliet movie.  This movie could be a great guy and chick thought provoking movie where a lot of discussion would be generated about all kinds of issues; like is AI good or bad, could any human mind with all its knowledge, memories, ideas, theology, personality and finally creativity ever be downloaded into a giant computer system and could it solved problems of all kinds like fantastic healing of the human body, etc.?  Could any computer systems or connected systems with a brilliant human mind with all the mind has ever be like God?  Can a woman still be in love with her man even though he is now in a lot of computers connected to each other?  What is relationship really based on? And other questions.  The discussion could spin off into philosophy and/or theology or religion.

An unusual movie for science fiction and big budget movies.  I could not give it 5 stars because I was not impressed with the actors and it required a lot of background information that the normal person will not have, which is why I wrote the above about AI and transcendence.  I think the actors only had to look sad or surprised most of the time and the downloaded brain guy spoke with the same voice all the time.  Maybe this last criticism is unfair because he is just supposed to be a huge computer software program in giant, connected, superfast, connected computers.

Transcendence is by far what many of futurists in us believe we will get to as an evolution of our minds outside biological constraints to be one with our ecology and universe as God or beside it with total enlightenment. Pure conscience no emotional constraints but just positive ones. Transcendence is a force that pushes a somple idea we are at this moment working together tirelessly. I would trade eternity with all what ales our planet and our inhabitant. Transcendence is a intellectual view most don't have the curiosities to understand or care deep so you get low turn on tickets which if you wated harry or vamire or lord or starwars or treck or transformers you see where tickets go and how it directly reflects our societies tastes in genres in film. If you are a deep scifi or tech futuist this is for u. Transcendence is not for you if you didn't like the jody foster movie which drew on similiar themes of human emotions continuing to styfle progress to benefit all of us and not the few at the top.

I honestly don't care what the critics are saying. I though this film was brilliant. It's a question as old as time, is it worth giving up our autonomy as human beings in order to solve all of our problems; disease, deformity, environmental detriment, war, perhaps even overcoming death itself? When a man merges his consciousness with that of an artificial intelligence he (it?) is able to through nanotechnology regenerate damaged cells on a molecular level---releasing ""a positive virus."" But the cost of benefiting from this technology is joining a collective mind. The man/computer says we remain autonomous, but those still unconnected are understandably dubious. We also doubt whether the man still exists within the AI. Seen through the eyes of his wife, we long for it, but even she doubts.  In the end humanity chooses autonomy and a new Dark Age.

6334452,1,B00J5JSV3A,"Most of this movie makes no sense, and the rest is poorly executed.

I was really interested in this movie for many reasons.  I love conceptual sci-fi films, and Wally Pfister (the director) has a track record for doing great work (though not as a director, actually).  Maybe I'm being too harsh on it, but Chris Nolan put his name on it, which made me think that he'd at least make sure the script makes sense.

 These were the biggest offenses to me:  There are plot holes every step of the way, the dialogue is awkward and vague, the pacing is weird, and I found myself constantly asking ""why are they doing that?"" and ""how did <some character> know that was happening?"".  It also bears mentioning that the science behind the plot was AMAZINGLY DUMB.

I know that you have to go into any sci fi film with a suspension of disbelief.  At some point you have to just accept things like ""Unobtanium"" and ""Warp Factors"" and ""everything that happened in Event Horizon"".  The main idea behind Transcendence's science is actually pretty cool, and has enough plausibility behind it to make it interesting.  The problem was that all the script does with that neat concept is use it to make what's basically a crappy monster movie.

 By the start of the third act, the movie had devolved into nothing more than a generic ""kill the big scary evil technology before it kills us"" movie, and it's just so pointless.  In the last 30 minutes of the film there is, of course, a completely gratuitous battle scene where three vans full of some kind of solders attack a field full of technology for no real apparent reason.  The big star-spangled finish is a rather oddly anticlimactic scene in which the terrorists (whom I was never really sure whether they were supposed to be the good guys or the bad guys) defeat the evil machine by ""shutting off the internet"" and ""uploading a virus"".

The subject of this movie is transhumanism, which is a subject that touches on some really important questions; questions about things like the nature of the soul, and what it means to be human.  It's a cool idea.  It was done by the man who shot The Dark Knight, had some amazing actors, and clearly a half-decent VFX budget.  This movie should have been smart and interesting and insightful.  Instead it was flat, confusing, quite poorly written, and generic.

I'd really like to think that this film started with a smart, intelligent script with a thought provoking narrative, and actual characters with real motivations that made sense, but someone in Hollywood with more money and influence than common sense or artistic integrity decided it was too ""high minded"" and forced Pfister to dumb it down to fit the Hollywood mold.

6334488,3,B00J5JSV3A,"Transcendence is a film that will defiantly mess with your mind.  You have a scientist's drive for artificial intelligence and when his consciousness must be uploaded into one of the programs it takes a turn for the worse.  This film was written by Jack Paglen and it was directed by Wally Pfister in which this is his directing debut.

It starts in New York where we have Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp) who is one the three most brilliant scientists working on creating Artificial Intelligence, A.I.  He works with his wife, Evelyn Caster (Rebecca Hall) who is also a very intelligent scientist as well as his best friend Dr. Max Waters (Paul Bettany). Dr. Caster goes to a lecture to raise money for their research but anti-technology terrorists had planned a large-scale attack and destroy facilities and shoot Dr. Caster in attempts to assassinate him.

The bullet doesn't do any serious damage but was laced with poison and hit him just enough to poison him.  This causes Will to only have one month to live and when he is near death Evelyn and Max consider the possibility of putting Will into the A.I.  They decide to try but while they are trying they are attacked by the same terrorists that tried to murder Dr. Caster.  With no choice Evelyn uploads Will into the Internet to save him.  This gives Will control of everything in the world and he is able increase his knowledge and he becomes even more powerful.  People do not like change and they are afraid of.

This film as interesting as the concept was just seemed a little over the top and far-fetched for me.  Now granted I always love a good science fiction film but I just wasn't feeling this one.  It wasn't the acting because I think Paul Bettany and Rebecca Hall worked together they did a good job.  Maybe it was the concept of taking the conscious of a person and putting them into a computer that just didn't feel right to me.  I don't think that anyone truly knows enough about the human brain to be able to do what is necessary to transfer everything from a human to a computer.  Think about it, we only use 10% of our brain, so that is 90% that scientist don't understand the true capacity function.

Overall I would have to give Transcendence a C.  It was a good idea in theory but I think it fell flat on delivery.  There are some aspects of the film I just didn't believe at all and with them being close to the ending I won't spoil that if you want to see it.",1411948800,,2439,4.440449438202247

6334501,1,B00J5JSV3A,"Alright; we were all warnedexplicitly.  The reviews were not kind, at all.  The people we all know who are supposed to love this kind of stuff walked away baffled that anyone would like it, and in that we had our answer; right?  If the target audience couldn't even appreciate this, then why would anyone else?  In fact, of everyone that Ive talked to that has seen this; Ive only come across two people who had anything nice to say about it.

And yet, I still decided that I needed to see it for myself.

Its so weird to me, because I feel like the best point of comparison for a film like this (film/expectations) would be Drive, and yet, that was a good movie.  Transcendence tries to be this thinking mans action film, and yet it winds up being this sluggish bore of a film that never reaches the potential it had and never really identifies itself past some skeletal framing of ideas.  These huge themes of love, science, god and faith feel rusted in writer Jack Paglens script, and almost dead inside Wally Pfisters direction.  It doesnt help that none of the relationships feel remotely believable.  This apparent love between Will Caster and Evelyn Caster, his wife, feels stale and never truly developed, so when she starts sacrificing her own sanity to be alongside him it makes no sense.

I feel like Im getting ahead of myself.

Transcendence tells the story of a scientist intent on perfecting artificial intelligence, at any cost, even his own life.  Sure, he doesnt want to die, but then again, hes not really dead, even when the lesser Mara shows up with her clan of The East inspired rebels (just far less interesting) and actually shots him dead (well, they drag that out a lot, but eventually he dies, sort of).  Yes, the very intelligence that Caster was working to perfect takes hold of him, uploads his consciousness into the computer and soon hes able to pretty much rule the world.  Yup, he becomes God because when computer intelligence combines with human intelligence you're able to heal wounds and regrow limbs and become immortal.

So, the plot makes no sense really, but its the execution of the plot that makes this all the worse.  For a guy who framed such intensly created films like Inception and The Dark Knight, this film is such an incredible bore.  First, it takes forever for anything to really happen (like, can Johnny Depp die already?), but once it does actually kick off, its so contrived and senseless that it becomes numbing to actually watch.  Outside of a few really cool visual effects, the film is just flaccid.

Yes, I just said that.

The finale also feels like a ridiculous cop out, sacrificing any real themes it could have developed and creating an ending that reads false and lazy, like everything Pfister and Paglen thought they wanted to say was completely scraped for this love lives on type ending that felt so uninspired and dumb.

Puke.

And lets not forget that the acting here is so dreadfully mundane.  Everyone is literally sleepwalking through this one.  Depp has been doing that for years, so thats to be expected, but all of those Nolan regulars that pop up here (Freeman, Murphy, Hall) are just phoning it in so hard here.  What happened to Paul Bettany?  He had such promise back in the early aughts, when he was working with Russell Crowe.  Now hes just drained of all that promise.  Hes like a blank canvas, with nothing interesting painted on it.  Hall also had such promise.  She should be a star.  Does anyone know who she is?  Kate Mara is embarrassing and Clifton Collins Jr. is utterly ridiculous here (as is his stupid character and sub-plot).

Oh god, Im feeling dumber just talking about this movie.",1411603200,7,3680,4.663043478260869

6334549,2,B00J5JSV3A,"While it has some interesting ideas, Transcendence is mired by a weak script, poor directing and worse editing. With good editing, this film would have been tauter and 40 minutes shorter. There is a lot of filler here.

The real problem is the script. It overlooks what would have been done rather than what the movie presented  security. The obvious target of terrorism simply ignores that there is any threat whatsoever. However far-fetched the sci-fi may be, that the geniuses behind it (in the movie) couldn't be bothered to do the slightest thing to protect themselves makes this movie stupidly unrealistic.

Someone at the studio should have insisted on a script rewrite. This could have been a very good movie in the hands of a writer with some talent.

If you want to see Morgan Freeman do his patented schtick of not act, watch Oblivion. It too was poorly received, but is actually a very good film.",1410912000,,908,4.764331210191083

6334571,5,B00J5JSV3A,"Transcendence is, in a nutshell, the age old story of humanity's quest for perfection and the desire to overcome the flaws, weaknesses and imperfections of nature.

We seem obsessed with curing every disease, healing every infirmity, becoming better than we were born. Our eternal quest to overcome and transcend our basic nature is the common theme of the film. With every progress we humans make, there will always be those who are too afraid of the unknown to give cautionary pause to progress. Fearful of what might go wrong, we plod along at a glacial pace.

The film, to me, seems to struggle with this sudden transformation that takes place (far to rapidly for many to accept) over a brief span of about five years. This is a movie based on real current scientific research and development. Much of what they represent here are technological advances that are in their infancy now but are soon to be upon us before we know it. It plays at our deepest fears and brings our strongest emotions forcefully into play. Many will see this as a fanciful fairy tales, but it is wise to think that once upon a time our forebears thought the telephone, automobile, airplane and other technologies were viewed as magic or sorcery or evil. Technology is what we decide to make of it. Nothing more, nothing less.

The movie is a thought piece that seeks to provoke the answers we all have on our minds but often don't want to think about: will computers, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) make humans obsolete and lead to our own self-imposed extinction? Will it make us into soulless, emotionless machines? The point this movie (in an artful but struggling way) seems to be saying, well, it all depends on the individual's point of view.

I don't know if this would be considered a spoiler but one thing that gnaws at me in the back of my mind. All those people who voluntarily are 'cured' appear to become connected to Dr. Caster's 'AI' mind. So, are they still humans with feelings and independent thought or are they mindless machines controlled by the AI? Their actions seemed to be purely defensive in nature, not mindless aggression towards the 'enemy'. Perhaps that was the point the filmmakers were trying to make. If we all knew what everyone else was thinking, would we not be more collectively protective of one another and seek to find more peaceful solutions to conflict rather than just 'jump the gun' and start shooting at everything?

It is interesting that the Luddites chose to destroy (bombs, guns, destructive weapons) while the AI used restraint and disarming. You can see the fear and disbelief in their eyes when they find their conventional military tactics are meaningless against such advanced technology. Their solution to end the problem seemed trite and simplistic to me. That is where this movie falls short.

Still, I gave it five stars for some great performances and awesome special effects. Few movies today make statements about where we are headed as a society and technologically with such poignancy as does this. Not much action, no big testosterone laden displays of machismo. Something that does not appeal to the masses.

The theme is an old idea. Many films and books have been made in the past that tell the same basic story. Colossus: The Forbin Project springs to mind. Both stories end in the same basic way. It would have been interesting to see how things might have turned out if the story had gone the other way. (We get hints that it might have been a better outcome and it certainly would have been more original over past efforts to tell the same story.) But then we would have been deprived of Morgan Freeman giving his spiel with religious overtones about how precious our humanity is and how we must strive against evil forces that seek to take that from us. Again we are left with, there is no right or wrong, only different results.",1410566400,,3892,4.7485207100591715

6334607,1,B00J5JSV3A,"This is an excellent example of the importance of why many Sci-Fi films fail time and time again. When telling such imaginatively strange stories they must be, even in the most minor way, believable to the mainstream. Whether driven by a conceptual prophecy, political dissent, morality play or futuristic warning, if the propaganda eclipses the storytelling, depth or authenticity of the characters, or relate-ability of the plot itself it will fail. If the scientific exploration, spiritual, psychological and/or philosophical expression, Avant-garde presentation, or explanation of the technology introduced or examined moves from intriguing & engaging to overbearing sermon, self-indulgent art-show, or outright lecture, no matter how talented the actors are or how well the script is written & performed, a possible extraordinary cinematic journey becomes a tedious, burdensome dead end. Unfortunately, despite possessing two of my favorite thespians, top notch character players; this feature is immediately crippled thanks to the aforementioned Achilles heel. It starts strong, a bit of a logical stretch, but soon the intellectual fabric of the story begins to fully unravel, trying too much to be an abstract metaphor about dissecting religion, justifying terrorism, government corruption, & the dangers of technological dependence. None of which stick because the recipe never cohesively evolves thanks to an over indulgence of disconnected ingredients. his is director Wally Pfister's first outing, and with the disastrous box office returns, it may be his last. In this, as in many other cases of Hollywood of late, proves that high priced star power is never a solution to save a poor production, sometimes studios need to pull the proverbial plug and transcend to another more potential successful project.

It's not really well-directed movie. It loses sight almost immediately. He stays pretty consistent throughout but it's consistently boring.

As in House of Cards, Mara has that unique ability to rivet your attention with an intense sensuality even if she's wearing a gunny sack. The movie offers a different slant on sci-fi-philosophical  situations, and keeps going up until (SPOILER) their para-military gets involved in an attack that the director must have consulted with some girl-scouts on how they might attack. It was a total lack of creativity + no understanding of current military technology or tactics on the director's part that annoyed me. To me that's simply LAZINESS on the director's part. .

This movie has gorgeous special effects and yet is so much more than that.  The soundtrack is scored to match the beauty of the visuals without taking away from the story. The casting is loaded with super performances and near spot on perfectly directed characters that leave you wondering at each turn whether they are good or bad or both.

6334784,3,B00J5JSV3A,"Three stars--just barely; 1-2 stars--without Johnny Depp (and Morgan Freeman).  Writers have recently noted in the pixel and printed presses that traditional creativity/originality in TV programs contrasted with that in theater motion pictures has been turned on its head.  TV now supplies the most original concepts and films the least.  TRANSCENDENCE, sadly,  helps to drive this point home.  It is a boring mashup that recycles what you have already seen in many Sci-Fi films and, especially, on Sci-Fi TV over the past half dozen years or so.  Right down to copying the techno-jargon.  It could easily be trimmed to fit into a 50-60 minute TV slot.  Johnny Depp delivers another chameleon-like performance (you may want to check the credits to make sure its really him!) as a virtual-reality mad scientist, err, mad technologist.  Although the script does not provide much to work with, Mr. Depp makes more than the best of things.  Almost always a  pure pleasure to see him in action.  As for the rest of the film, the movie looks and sounds cheap in just about all departments.  The CGI looks cheap and cheesy.  Real and virtual sets (except for some on-location shots) are mostly minimalistic (and look cheap).  The surround sound field is subpar (staring with the applause from an auditorium audience early in the film).  (The best surround field seems to occur during the opening Warner Bros. logo sequence!  And you won't need to turn on your subwoofer[s] this time.)  The score is pitiful and seems to have been cobbled together over a few days with slivers from other film/TV scores.  So park your brain (no pun) at the door, sit back, and enjoy another acting romp with Mr. Depp.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1408752000,,1716,4.912891986062718

6334825,3,B00J5JSV3A,"this one is a tough sell for me - the pursuit for ""the singularity"" in AI development is up there with stem cell research in terms of ethical and moral conflict. In this particular story, I feel like the writers sensed that there needed to be an action component since it might be too intellectual a question to base 90-120 minutes of cinematic effort on - but I really believe they sold their audience short as a result. If you were to compare the struggle HAL9000 had in dealing with being a sentient creature and compare it to this story 1:1 - Stanley Kubrick attached the importance and the proper context for the same concerns that are being raised in this movie without huge explosions or really expensive CG. As a modern simulation of what could happen when a machine discovers that it's a far more efficient and effective manager of its' sphere of influence - this was pretty heavy handed but predominantly accurate. The ending was lame but the film ultimately is supposed to make money so ambiguous endings are unacceptable. Should you watch this movie? Yea I guess - there's enough meat from a really large and ultimately unanswerable question to at least provoke thought - but if you really want to dig into this further I would suggest 2001 A Space Odyssey as a superior treatment of the same extrapolation.",1408406400,,1319,4.665236051502146

Absolutely zero resources are put in to finding Depp's character, who happens to be able to build an underground fortress which is apparently the size of several football fields, with a solar array above it to match, completely and entirely in secret.

6334849,4,B00J5JSV3A,"I love, love, love science fiction stories.  With science fiction my imagination is allowed to soar beyond the confines of my mind and I can ask not what is...but what...can be.  Unfortunately, Mary Shelley, author of the book, ""Frankenstein"" had a lot more imaginative stories to tell than this movie.  Transcendence, is a modern day ""Frankenstein"" story of sorts, about man giving a digital computer ""life"" skills, but it falls short of invoking anything new, or ""life-like.""  In the movie Johnny Depp plays a ""brilliant"" scientist who is fully involved in an artificial intelligence experiment with his wife, who is played by Rebecca Hall.  He is injured by a ""techno-hate"" group and in a desperate move to save his life is down-loaded by his wife into his experimental computations.  Remember that story?  Perhaps ten years ago Depp would have been great in this role, but now days seem to be sleepwalking through most of his movie roles of late, and one cannot help but feel he hasn't bothered memorizing his lines.  Each time he is on screen it is almost as if he pauses before speaking...like he's distracted, or searching for his cue cards.  Morgan Freeman, who plays...""Morgan Freeman,"" never deviates from his concerned, ""fatherly"" role throughout the movie.  Just once, I would like to see him out of character.  The special effects in the film leave quite a bit to the imagination, but the photography is nice; perhaps due to the fact the director was once a photographer.  My main gripe about the film is difficult to pin point, or describe, but something in the movie was ""missing.""  I can only explain it as one would explain the lost of intensity in any ""action,"" or ""force.""  Many would call it the lost of ""crescendo,"" or the climax of the movie is missing, or it is so small...it's just not seen.  When Rebecca Hall (Johnny Depp's wife in movie) discovers he is finally able to reproduce himself in the flesh, she simply reacts as if he has just come back from a three-day vacation with a tan.  I would suggest those rich, executive movie producers stop making these types of films for awhile...or, at least until they can gather a larger group of ""believers.""  Artificial Intelligence may one day be possible, but the dire ramifications and consequences to our human DNA is what horror movies are made of...perhaps that was the kind of movie I was hoping to see.  I would have given this movie only three stars had it not been for the ""Romeo and Juliet"" ending. I love sentimental endings...""throughout tragedy there is love and a bit of hope on the side.""  This  A.I. movie is worth watching, if just as a reminder of what could be...if we are not careful.",1408233600,,2677,4.740820734341253

The movie plays out the argument of which is better technological advancement vs natural progression of the world and mankind.  And throughout the movie, the pros and cons of both sides are played out  with neither side looking like the better choice in a clear black and white way.  The movie presents itself in more of a gray answer and lets the viewer themselves decide which they think would have been the better choice for the movie.

Although this is a good makes you think kind of movie, the pacing of the movie was a bit uneven and had a bit of a familiar tone to it.  Throughout the movie, I kept thinking that I had seen something similar before but couldn't figure out if I was thinking of several different movies in years past or one that was very similar to this one.  And the plot has a few illogical turns and holes that keep it from being as good as it could have been.

The special effects are well done and Depp who excels at playing the unusual role does well here as the scientist turned computer program.  In addition there is a strong supporting cast that includes one of my favorite actors in Morgan Freeman.

With all that said,  Transcendence  is  good sci-fi type thriller that brings into question the advancement of technology and the human race.

The science of nanotechnology is in it's infancy at the present time but the potential that it could have to benefit humanity exists. The movie does a good job of showing the potential medical benefits of such technology but also the potential drawbacks of having nanotech humans become drones to a controlling intelligence. I am reminded of the AI exhibit demonstration I  crashed in St, Louis by asking the computer the probing questions until I found the right one to involve it in a logical dilemma. AI on the level shown in the movie is still a ways off. The idea of uploading a human's consciousness into a computer is an intriguing paradigm, which the movie expands into the question of what makes a being human. Is it self awareness ? If so what exactly is self awareness ?  If we ever find a non destructive way to couple a human brain with a computer the result will possibly be something like this movie. I believe that the ability to be creative is one of our defining human attributes. Art, Music, poetry are things I believe no mere machine will ever be capable of. This is a movie I will watch again.

6334957,5,B00J5JSV3A,"You might want to know what this film is REALLY about...Like so many Hollywood movies, it's actually about ""The All-Seeing Eye"". The 'Eye' is a totally real alien entity that controls our planet. It has the ability to invade the human mind and project a digital copy of a Reptilian alien into each host body it possesses. These human hosts become 'Reptilian Shapeshifters' who can display the super-imposed image of the Reptilian over their own faces and eyes. I call these adorable rascals 'BioDigitals' because they are biologically human but with a digital 'Overmind' inside them that allows them to act as One conspiracy. (We see The 'Eye' on the dollar bill and the phrase 'E Pluribus Unum' which means: ""Out Of Many, One"".) This conspiracy has been running the planet for a very long time in a clandestine fashion...However, the time seems to have come for the BioDigital conspiracy to reveal itself to the guileless humans of Earth...At the 2012 Olympics, we saw the ""All Seeing Eye"" looming ominously over the Olympic stadium boldly undisguised as the stadium lights. In the recent film ""Now You See Me"", the 'Eye reveals itself as the controller of a 'Theater of the Real' - which orchestrates huge pranks and hoaxes to demonstrate the conspiratorial power of the 'Eye's' BioDigital meat-puppets, who can all keep in secret collusion in a way that is totally impossible for ordinary humans to do.
 Case in point: The 'Sandy Hook school shootings' - that was a total BioDigital hoax if ever there was one. Everyone was an actor just pretending that this tragedy had occurred: All of the media and the 'grieving' parents and even our BioDigital president, Barack Obama. But if you doubt this, simply examine the comparison photos of the Sandy Hook child 'victims' to the faces of the 'Sandy Hook Choir' which sang at the Super Bowl shortly after the supposed tragedy occurred...The 'dead' children were in the choir singing ""America The Beautiful"". (The 'Boston Marathon Bombing' was another BioDigital hoax with amazingly obvious clues provided by the 'Eye' to allow any curious human to recognize the phony nature of the event.)
 In ""Transcendence"", we see Johnny Depp become a digital Overmind which can project his own identity into a vast contingent of human host-bodies - just like the 'Eye' does in real life. We also see how deliriously happy all of the humans are to become inter-connected and guided by their benevolent digital 'god'...such is the way of the real life 'BioDigitals', who couldn't be more pleased that ""The All-Seeing Eye"" is there to guide and control them. (For example, I was watching the closing ceremonies of the 2012 Olympics when I noticed that many of the athletes were using their medals to cover one of their eyes as they laughed and cheered. This is known as 'One Eye' symbolism and is how the BioDigitals subliminally reveal that they are controlled by ""The All-Seeing Eye"". Even the most dim-witted of humans must by now have started to wonder about these constant displays of 'One Eye' symbolism that occur throughout popular culture.)
 In the science fiction classic ""Childhood's End"", BioDigital author Arthur C. Clarke lightly fictionalized the real-world conspiracy that he was a part of: He told a tale of Reptilian aliens coming to Earth to assimilate the younger generation of humans into an 'Overmind' which would replace their identities with it's own. (The first edition paperback of the novel depicts a looming EYE as the 'Overmind'.) And the great sci-fi BioDigital prophet Philip K. Dick also very lightly fictionalized the conspiracy in ""The Three Stigmata Of Palmer Eldritch"": An alien invades the solar system by psychologically assimilating humans and converting them into host bodies for a copy of itself...These human hosts then display 'stigmata' - which is to say, the super-imposed features of the alien over their own individual features.
 The BioDigital Reptilian shapeshifters will continue to reveal themselves through fiction and subliminalism...""Transcendence"" is certainly an awesomely revealing film.

6335012,3,B00J5JSV3A,"It's so rare for Hollywood to make anything other than popcorn flicks, so I guess it should come as no surprise when they routinely fail to deliver on truly thought provoking movies.  The movie attempts to deal with the topic of Artificial Intelligence and something that approximates the Kurzweilian notion of the ""singularity"" or the uploading of the mind onto a computer.  Also, thrown in for good dramatic measure, is a rather hackneyed antagonist (turned protagonist) Luddite terrorist group that ""fights the machine.""  [Spoiler Warning] Depp's character, Dr. Caster, get shot with a polonium bullet (no doubt a reference to Alexander Litvinenko) which slowly kills him but not before his wife scans his brain and uploads him into the server.  From here Depp can access the internet and do things like play the financial markets and make massive cha-ching in a matter of days.  I will skip through the rest rather hand-wavily.  He and his wife form a company that revs up nano tech production that turn people into machine hybrids.  The townsfolk think this is fishy and eventually the Luddite resistance group swoops in and tries to take over Depp's data center.  They succeed in implanting a ""virus"" that takes down Depp's global WiFi grip and somehow also takes down all electronic technology leading to a post-electronic dystopic world (see Dilbert episode S1E9 ""The Knack"").

First, it must be said, these topics have been explored far better in Star Trek.  ST:TNG The Schizoid Man was written with exactly this idea of uploading one's brain into the a computer/android.  There are numerous episodes of Star Trek, (in TOS and all spin offs) dealing with various issues of AI and brain/consciousness switcheroo.  If Star Trek doesn't do it for you then I would point you to many 50's/60's era sci-fi flicks such as ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" or the 1992 film ""Lawnmower Man"" although I think Star Trek deals with these matters with far better scientific sophistication.  Point being: there have been far better explorations of these topics in entertainment before.  It really seemed as if this movie was wholly uniformed by any of it, as it made no attempt to be better or substantively different.

One point that seemed to go unobserved in the movie, was the quantum computer named PINN (physically independent neural network).  This quantum computer is insinuated as being self aware and sentient.  However PINN plays almost no role in the film.  Other than some vacuously pithy throwaway lines PINN is given none of the spotlight.  However if it was the case that PINN was a truly sentient being, then (in my view) that is the greater achievement.  Uploading one's brain into a computer is certainly cool, but it's not beyond the scope of what is at least conceivable of how to do (see the EU's Human Brain Project).  A truly sentient AI on the other hand is a bit more Holy Grailish.  It's also worth pointing out that ""Physically Independent Neural Network"" sounds all very techie but is (at least on its face) somewhat meaningless.  How can it be physically independent if it's software (presumably) running on a physical machine?  The ""neural network"" part is all well and good but we already know about neural networks, what I ask, makes PINN special in this regard?  None of these answers are given as the movie is more concerned with extolling it's ""cautionary tale"" theme.  There are numerous other groan/eye-roll areas in the film (like Depp's ham-handed attempt at building a Faraday cage) but despite this I think it's still worth the watch.",1407369600,,3567,4.942953020134228

6335015,4,B00J5JSV3A,"Interesting to see other reviews and how differently I see the idea of the film. To me it wasn't about artificial intelligence at all. Perhaps it was a far out way to portray it, at time felt like the film makers were a bit confused themselves, but it was about the essence of being - the universal consciousness behind out perception of reality.
It was about what you can learn from Integral yoga of Sri Aurobindo or even works of Bruce Lipton and Joe Dispenza: the gradual descending of higher consciousness and us, humans, adjusting to that descent. It is something most human minds cannot understand, it is an evolution which gradually speeds up but only gradually. It is about our small-mindedness and inability to see beyond our perceptions, yet, it is not our fault because we have to learn to walk before we fly.
Hence, the ending of the film, where a drop of higher consciousness dissolves in a small puddle of water: yes, it has to be slow to protect us from destroying ourselves in fear of our own potentiality.
I feel that was the true message and all the rest were just Hollywood effects. And yes, that's a message most of us would not get.",1407283200,,1153,4.548076923076923

Its about a hapless genius scientist studying AI, who winds up becoming the very subject he had been studying. The central idea of Transcendence has great potential, I admit, but the producers (including Christopher Nolan) seem to have forgotten one thing; they needed a good storyteller.

Johnny Depp is Dr. Will Caster, whose consciousness is uploaded when he gets fatally wounded. Oh, but before that, there are some radical activists trying to stop his research. Also, Dr. Carter has a supportive wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall). And don't forget his best friend Max Waters (Paul Bettany), himself a scientist, too. And.

The story goes on and on like this. We are not allowed to know these unengaging characters, who are just ciphers. There is no suspense, no tension here. The only thing I find impressive is the stylish visuals and production design. As to the star Johnny Depps performance, well, he seems pretty much bored.

Johnny Depp's character seemed cold-hearted and distant always and I never believed he loved her which made the ending unbelievable.  Also, the plot drags a lot making it kinda wishy-washy in the middle.  For the first half of the film it seems like nothing really exciting is going on and the group of terrorists in the film also seem unmotivated.  Their motivation for believing that the computers are going to take over the world seems lame.  I suppose all terrorism is lame but for whatever reason, (the acting or the writing), I was not buying it.  In our real modern world, corporations and the wealthy are robbing the country blind and very few people even care.  It is hard to believe that Americans would be so concerned about computers taking over the world when they can allow children and adults to live in the streets, go without food and medical care.

I like Depp's work and he did not disappoint here. Curmudgeonly when alive and eery when dead, and pixilated. The rest of the cast carried their own water. Direction was solid and there were only little misses at the ensemble level. The production values fell into two courts.

The CGI was inspiring but the far-background shots included a number of slips.

Now, to the story.

The story was, how should I put it, complex! As in so complex that we plan on watching the film again in order to try to ferret out all of the nuances that the writer was attempting to capture.

6335095,2,B00J5JSV3A,"If you know anything about computers or AI this movie might make you want to bash your head on the screen.  Weird plot that constantly changes without making sense of things before moving on.

I read one review about great special effects and I beg to differ.  Most of the effects involve nano-particles.  Hence the effects were rather rudimentary because they involve things that look like black sand taking shape.  The Mummy,  the Matrix, and Terminator 2  mastered this level of particle effect decades ago.  I wasn't impressed since many of the non-gritty effects were of items that involved little grandeur or artistry (making human hands etc).  Sure a hand might be really neat but it lacks the awe inspired by grander topics and sets.  The subject matter involving the human mind and body lends itself better to great acting and a really snappy plot.  Transcendence's plot could have gone so many great places but the writers chose to make it rather narrow focused and shallow (terrorists vs good doctors).

The idea of singularity gets lost with all the switcheroos in the plot line.  It feels like several people wrote the script in segments then copy-pasted them together rather than collaborating.  The resulting seams in the story are distracting.  Depp spends most of the movie on a computer screen so much of his acting is made 2d.  :(  Disappointing.",1407024000,3,1365,4.890829694323144
6335096,5,B00J5JSV3A,"This is one of those thought-provoking films that doesn't try to tell you what to think. The question arises - if ""the singularity"" becomes a reality, what would YOU choose?  And what if there are cultish factions that don't want to let YOU choose at all?  The idea here is that technology is rapidly progressing to a point where it may soon be possible to upload our consciousness into a computer rather than face the possibility that there really isn't any so-called life-after-death.  This is a fact - in fact, it's estimated that the ""singularity"" will become a reality by the year 2045.

The dichotomy in TRANSCENDENCE centers around the moral and philosophical questions of whether or not we ""should"" be permitted to transfer our awareness from a dying organic body into an essentially immortal (and omniscient) inorganic computer program.  Whatever you may believe for yourself, this is a movie that makes you think - often to the point that it may even become uncomfortable.  But don't worry - that feeling of discomfort is usually what we feel when our minds are expanding beyond their comfort zones, which is one major reason I'm giving TRANSCENDENCE a 5-star review.

The cinematography here is gorgeous, and though there are a couple of places where I felt the film may have benefited from some minor editing, overall I found it to be an artfully done exploration of man's limitations as well as his infinite possibilities.",1407024000,,1435,4.904958677685951

Your questions are mostly answered in the end. And as tragic as it is, it is probably right on the money. I feel like that's the message (if the writer intended for there to be one). Man is his own worst enemy.

6335115,1,B00J5JSV3A,"I have been quite surprised to recognize in Transcendence the plot, subplots, many scenes and other characteristics of the sci-fi novel C.A.S.P.E.R., published early 2011 by sci-fi author Dominique Raymond Poirier.

http://www.amazon.com/S-P-E-R-French-Dominique-Raymond-Poirier/dp/1461143454/ref=la_B004H5VY04_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1406990433&sr=1-3

Even the name of the AI program, Casper in this book, becomes Will Caster in Transcendence. Even the last minutes of Transcendence picture exactly the last lines of the book (how come!).  Beyond these two particularly stinking similar features, you can find countless other similarities between the two stories, subplots, scenes; even the romance. As this novel is available in French only, few will be able to see all this by their own, regretfully.
Screenwriter Mr Jack Paglen introduced few fantasies of his own in C.A.S.P.E.R.,  whose plot and everything else are entirely based upon true scientific facts. There is no such evolution in nanotechnology and the dream of copying human soul to make it a computer program in this book. Indeed, C.A.S.P.E.R. author wrote an introduction about the dream of scientists to make AI computer programs as omniscient and omnipotent as God (again, a matter that is featured under the form of a recurrent Will Caters statement in Transcencence). The chronology of C.A.S.P.E.R.is a bit different, when compared to Transcendence, however, since the scientist who created the AI program Casper is shot dead by an activist toward the end of the plot in the book. But the choice of a small unknown town to make a headquarter for virtual Will Caster happens at about the same time in both stories; the same for the collaboration between the computer scientist and the agent of the FBI.
Considering that screenwriter Mr Jack Paglen has near to no previous experience in sci-fi writing, as in screenwriting overall, the amazing number of perfect similarities in both stories seems a bit (too) odd to me.",1406937600,3,1989,5.554455445544554

To make short a tedious explanation, the human race is on the very cusp of being able to potentially turn this entire planet into a mass of ""Strange matter"" using nano technology. If we were to ever actually reach true AI, and Nano technology to a level to convert matter, it is by no means unreasonable that this new live force could and would do anything to survive, even wipe out its creators. As we begin to bridge the gap between Human contentiousness and artificial intelligence, I believe it will be for a large part our maturity as a race and our ability to control our hubris that will form the outcome of the future of AI and nano technology and its usage; I thought this film brilliantly  conveyed one potential  possibility for our future. The thing I find ridiculous, is that some believe this will be the only future of this technology is developed.

You have to realize that the danger suggested in the movie is very real because one needs to be aware that the research is funded by DARPA, the advanced research arm of the military-industrial complex and they are not driven by altruistic thought; their mission is to keep the USA on the cutting edge of technology; but, there is a fine line between ""Deterrence"" and ""Subjugation"" as history confirms; they want the ""perfect soldier"":  without remorse, without conscience, obeying without question.

[PS - Hollywood's model of the quantum computer is inaccurate but understandable because they had to use a model that the audience could relate to:  Binary Computers with the bandwidth limitation and power requirements like that of the Cray computer of old.  Computation at the subatomic level is quite different than the 3 dimensional world to which one is accustomed.  A quantum crystal can fit in the palm of your hand, gathers energy from it's environment, and is able to move a Zeta unit (1E21) of data/information/knowledge instantaneously, operating at a Yoda flop equivalent (1E27) and is not bandwidth limited.

6335156,5,B00J5JSV3A,"Dr Will Caster: ""For one hundred and thirty thousand years, our capacity to reason has remained unchanged. The combined intellect of the neuroscientists, mathematicians and engineers pales in comparison to the most basic A.I. Once online, a sentient machine will quickly overcome the limits of biology; in a short time, its analytic power will become greater than the collective intelligence of every person born in the history of the world. Some scientists refer to this as the Singularity. I call it Transcendence."" And that quote about sums up what Dr Will Caster and his wife, Evelyn have been working on...the development of a sentient computer, the ultimate in artificial intelligence. But shortly after making this speech, Dr Caster is fatally wounded by a gang of Luddite terrorists, who oppose artificial intelligence. It is then up to Evelyn and a close associate, Max Waters, to finish the project...and they come up with an interesting alternate solution that involves connecting Dr Caster's consciousness to the quantum computer. That will set the stage for what I found to be an intriguing science fiction film. Johnny Depp in a good performance is Will Caster; and Rebecca Hall, wins the nod for best performance as Evelyn. The fine actor, Paul Bettany, adds another excellent performance to his resume as Max. Also look for the ubiquitous Morgan Freeman as a government scientist, Cillian Murphy as an FBI Agent; and Kate Mara, as the leader of the terrorist group. Be advised this film is a bit on the cerebral side, so you will need to pay attention to keep up with what is going on.

It also tackles our abject failure, as a species, to make long term plans that could relieve cruelty, suffering and deprivation - not to mention the wholesale destruction of our habitat.

The problem with this film is that it takes on too much and as a result the message is muddied and under-developed. I would guess that maybe 10% of the audience understood Transcendence in its entirety. This film should've been developed as a mini-series.

So why 5 stars? Because this is a brave film that bucks the trend of catering to the wooly minded majority who think almost exclusively with their emotions rather than their intellects.

6335231,3,B00J5JSV3A,"Good sci-fi has always been about ideas, and TRANSCENDENCE does have some. Still, visuals end up trumping the compelling questions which it could have at least attempted to answer. The story is about Will Caster, an AI researcher who is attacked by an anti-technology group known as RIFT (Radical Independence From Technology). They only graze him with a bullet, but the bullet was laced with a lethal substance and now he only has a month to live. Desperate to save his life by any means possible, his wife (and research partner) tests an experimental procedure which uploads his consciousness to a computer. From there he evolves and grows to a point practically beyond human comprehension, all with RIFT on his trail.

 Watching this, at least for the first two thirds, I kept wondering why on earth this flopped so hard. It might not be the smartest sci-fi out there, having a decent amount of logical issues and extraordinary suspense of disbelief towards the end, but at its core is a compelling relationship and the age-old question of whether humans can create something as, or more, intelligent than ourselves. However by the end, with its typical action climax and really failing to probe the issues at its heart, I can understand why it might turn some people off. For my money, it was a good, well-intentioned effort by first-time director Wally Pfister (Christopher Nolan's longtime DP, who also has a producing credit). None of what is wrong with the film can really be laid on his shoulders. That would be first-time writer Jack Paglen. At times, it isn't clear what he intended the message of the film to be, since the results are a bit mixed. Is it anti-technology or not? Who are the real villains supposed to be? The answers to these questions seem to change as the film progresses.

 Another major weakness I found was the footage that bookends the narrative. Set five years after the events of the film, it essentially gives away the endgame and removes any and all questions as to how the film might turn out. Still, the journey there is interesting and extremely cool to watch. Speaking of things that are cool to watch, I must say that the film is very well designed and filmed, and has some awesome visual effects. Granted, these don't really make up for the faults in the writing, but at least it was pretty to look at. One minor issue I will point out is the pacing, as there is a two-year jump in the middle of the film which not only throws off the narrative thrust (as slow as it might be), but also raises a lot of additional questions that the writers probably don't want viewers to be asking, the least of which is given how powerful that Will becomes in terms of the things he can do, how this didn't revolutionize the technology and medical fields anywhere else. Also, are we supposed to believe that RIFT or the FBI didn't make much of any headway in the intervening time period?

 Anyway, I digress. Despite a lot of these questions periodically coming up after I started to think about what I was watching, I still enjoyed myself. Why? Mainly because it wasn't boring, which is the worst crime a film can commit. Even though the tough questions aren't really given their due, the cast did a good job and the film was visually pleasing (although I kind of wish that some of the supporting cast had been given more screen time). Overall, as long as you lower your expectations a bit I see no reason why this wouldn't be a good way to pass two hours.",1406678400,20,3485,4.612903225806452

Also, Johnny Depp's acting was so deadpan, which is really too bad because I am a fan of many of the movies in which he has starred and I enjoy his abilities immensely. In this movie there is no development that makes one connect with the characters and though it makes its point concerning the proliferation of technology with no thought of consequences, it does so in a very predictable and disconnected way.

Sadly, this movie has failed in the box-office and will not be seen by many who might just love it because they listen to those reviewers.

This movie was under-appreciated in the theaters.

This movie is very idea driven. One reviewer titled her piece ""I think, therefore I am"", a famous quote from the philosopher Rene Descartes. (I loved it... and I wish I had thought of that title first). That is a perfect review title for this movie. This movie really examines Descartes philosophy by applying it to Artificial Intelligence (A.I.), and then the movie blurs the line between human intelligence and A.I. because Johnny Depp's character has his ""thoughts"" transferred. (Is it him, or just a copy? Is it conscious?) GREAT STUFF.

To top it all off, we must grapple with the question of ""Cogito ergo Sum"" (I think therefore I am) through the perspective of Johnny Depp's character's WIFE. We must see him and his A.I. version as a loved entity. (We feel for her, but should she love him? Is it real? We want it to be good and real, but we are skeptical. What will happen).

This is a movie that would be completely appropriate for young teens and tweens, in my opinion, and it has a great cast with good acting and a moving story.

Definitely watch this movie.",1406505600,2,1218,4.6465116279069765
6335263,5,B00J5JSV3A,"This is a great sci fi on an emergent singularity. Its a bit clunky in its approach to how this event materializes even if the idea of the singularity is a possibility. This is a film about human evolution and how human beings, as we presently exist, will fight any advancement it cannot wrap its monkey brain around and, crippled with fear, lash out in violence. The singularity is personified by the character Will; the pun in this characters name wasn't lost to me.  The humans who do not understand what has happened to 'Will' decide to do what humans do best, destroy. It wants to destroy what was created. Throwing all scientific inquiry out the window the humans don't bother to ask Will the real pertinent philosophical and moral questions and since inquiry isn't pursued with Will, the humans just mistrusts and fears the entity that had done nothing more than improve, save and evolve the conditions of mankind for a new kind of human kind. In genuine monkey fashion the humans try and preserve their imperfections through the murder of anything surrounding the entity Will. In the end the Luddites win and the earth improved through Will's efforts continues but without the benefit of contemporary technology, thus going back to the only state an un-evolved human can exist, that world of pre-existing emergence. I guess they were too content with the world of poverty, sickness, war and ignorance.

6335306,4,B00J5JSV3A,"Transcendence is a very non-mainstream Sci-Fi film.  The majority of big Sci-Fi films that come out are generally action-packed blockbusters or post-apocalyptic features, especially ones with a premise of technology getting out-of-hand.  If people go into this expecting either of those things from this film they will be very disappointed, which is evident in the reviews this film has received.  The trailer does give an impression that it was going to be one or both of those types of films, so the trailer is a bit misleading.  I was not even going to see this film seeing the reviews saying how boring the film was.  However, one of my favorite reviewers really liked the film and recommended it so I gave it a shot.  I saw the film and I actually think it is quite good.  I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  Transcendence is not a Sci-Fi film like The Terminator or The Matrix.  It is more like the film Oblivion that came out last year which I think is also an underrated film.  Oddly enough, both films had Morgan Freeman in them.

The story is as follows.  Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp) is a researcher in Artificial Intelligence and is working to create a sentient computer capable of unlimited intelligence but also with the ability to have emotion.  However, he is gunned down and poisoned by someone involved in a terrorist organization that is against the very idea of Artificial Intelligence.  When he is on the verge of death his wife, Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) and their friend Max Waters (Paul Bettany), decide to upload his mind to a computer.  It is a success.  They then upload Will to the Internet in which he has gained unimaginable knowledge and power.  However, he wants more.  They all begin to question if the intelligence is really Will at all.

This film has many things going for it.  Firstly, the cast is excellent.  Johnny Depp, in my opinion, gives his best performance in a long time.  For the first time in years (as far as I know) he is not playing a character or trying to channel is Jack Sparrow performance.  Morgan Freeman gives a good performance like always; as does Cillian Murphy who is most known for his role as Crane (Scarecrow) from Batman Begins.  The effects were good, but the movie surprisingly did not use many effects which is surprising for a Sci-Fi movie.  Best of all, the films got me engrossed by its premise and good execution.

A great Sci-Fi film should do three things: have great effects and present a great looking world, be entertaining, and raise thought-provoking questions about humanity and our society today and do it without sounding overly preachy (cough*Avatar*cough) .  Transcendence did all of those things for me.  It is a very thought-provoking film that raises many questions like: Will our over dependence on technology eventually cause our downfall?; Can machines truly have a soul?; Should someone be given so much power?  Best of all, the film does this without falling back on action, explosion, or any of those common movie tropes.  There is hardly any action, but it did not need any action.

There are some issues with the film, however.  First of all, some characters are pretty useless.  I like Morgan Freeman and Cillian Murphys performances, but I felt their characters were almost useless to the story.  They are barely in the film and when they are just standing around most of the time.  Secondly, the pacing was a bit slow in places.  The beginning could have been faster and the ending could have been quicker.  I felt that some things were a little too dragged out.  Also the two year time jump really bothered me.  Why did they have to jump forward two years?  It makes no sense.  You could have jumped forward two months, two weeks, or even two days and it would have made no difference.

Overall, Transcendence is a very enjoyable and thought-provoking Sci-Fi film if viewed with the right mind set.  I know people wished this could be more of an apocalyptic movie where it is the A.I. vs. humanity with action and explosions, but we already got that with The Matrix, The Terminator, and to a lesser extent 2001: A Space Odyssey.  I find it weird that 2001 gets almost nothing but praise but this movie gets hated on so much.  That film is very similar Transcendence, especially the parts with Hal 3000.  If you a fan of Sci-Fi films like Blade Runner, Oblivion, and 2001: A Space Odyssey then I think you should give this a shot.",1406332800,5,4453,4.687741935483871

6335351,4,B00J5JSV3A,"Unfortunately, this movie has received a lot of negative reviews.  Reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes are crushing it. The thing I have tended to find with the negative reviews is the authors failed to understand the movie, or they were parroting the unsupported claims of others in the group. That often happens when movies use prestidigitaton or slight-of-hand as a part of the plot structure (e.g., The Sixth Sense). As with written satire (e.g., A Modest Proposal), many fail to understand the story.

DYNAMICS
As some have noted among these (largely better) reviews, there is a complicated dynamic between two groups. The first and larger and more aggressive group coalesces for a variety of reasons that include extremism, jealousy, fear, inflexibility, and unfounded assumptions -- component parts of many fundamental religions, by the way. The second group is made up of Johnny Depp and a few people he has helped -- though it should be noted that as a part of the process, he has connected with them mentally and can have zombie-like control over them (that terrifies group 1, who assume he is building an army).

The dynamic is, ""who, if anybody, are the good guys. Clues abound, but Depp is portrayed so creepily that it is hard to see him as anything but a soulless computer program building limitless power. He even introduces into the world an apparent plague of self-replicating nanobots that are also under his power (the slight-of-hand). On the other hand, while group 1 advances their agenda with violence, killing a bunch of people, even in battle he never hurts anyone. Still, given Depp's performance (and the fact that virtually everybody in the movie calls him ""it""), viewers will tend to side with the terrorists.

ENDING--Though I do not give it away, I point to indicators that it is not what it seems.
Some have complained about the ending. It is bittersweet to say the least, but it is not really the ending. At the very beginning of the movie we see a delightful image of water dripping off a sunflower. The camera focuses on two drops (one slightly smaller than the other) and follows them to a pool where the merge with the rest of the water. That scene, knowledge of what is in the water, and the word ""Transcendence"" explains the movie, and the ending becomes the most beautiful and uplifting part of the entire plot.

ACTING
I felt like the acting was spotty. One critic claimed that Depp ""Skyped"" his performance in. I suggest that he still did an excellent job. On the one hand, he was barely in focus and difficult to see, while successfully portraying a creepy, soulless program deeply in love with Rebecca Hall. I was not so impressed with Hall's performance. The problem might not have been hers, however. It might have been that her character was so shallow. Morgan Freeman had to play Morgan Freeman, because his character had no depth at all. I hated Kate Mara, but only because she made such a believable terrorist. I was confident she would cut my throat in an instant if she needed to -- of course that is a testament to great acting. Paul Bettany did a beautiful job of playing the most complex part in the movie. He was a jealous and spiteful man with strong opinions that invariably turned out wrong but always sounded important, and true, yet he always seemed the only reasonable person in the group. I gave the movie 4-stars because there were weakness in this area.

I have see the movie twice. It is one I will add to my collection. I will watch it whenever I want to see a complicated idea well presented. In my humble opinion, this is the best movie I have seen so far this year and among the most interesting love stories I have seen since ""What Dreams May Come.""",1406073600,6,3713,4.6871165644171775
6335352,5,B00J5JSV3A,"This is the best science fiction that I have ever seen. As film, it was beautifully made. I watched the movie more than ten times now, and will probably watch it another ten times. Every time I watched, I found a new segment that made more sense in cinematographic, performance and artistic sense. In terms of the science and base knowledge depth, it is quite interesting, however, it does not address some of the non-mainstream scientific and philosophical questions and views. It assumes that quantum computers are the way to better AI, and nano-technology is the ultimate solution to all our problems. This claims are not yet scientifically conclusive, and there are non-technology based solutions that are more advanced than these. However, the story has an extremely good philosophical point, that when intelligence (in any form) gets to a critical point, unlike many AI scientists predictions, it must become a benevolent being, because it will transcend. Intelligence to the extreme implies benevolence, and not destruction.
Many AI followers assume Turing's point of view of an almighty intelligent machine, that when becomes conscious, it will obliterate human kind. The fact is that such a conclusion is contradiction in terms. Such a machine cannot clearly be intelligent enough, otherwise it wouldn't care about destroying other beings. Intelligence dictates constructive and creative action, and behave in the same way as mother nature is. Moreover, if people are waiting for the day that an AI takes over the planet. I suggest that such has already occurred a thousand times now. for an AI need not be a machine, it could very well be humans that have artificial intelligence, what I call: mechanized/fake intelligence, which tends to assume the behavior of machines. A bug in a program is not actually a bug in the computer or machine, it is a bug in our way of thinking and perhaps our brains. So, in essence we ourselves are trying to become AI-s, never mind the concern about the machines becoming AI-s. The Turing test and question of self consciousness, is yet another question, that one must put to human fake intelligence. People, who think they know but in actuality their knowledge is sequence of imitations and parot-ic verses (at the best). We have proved many times over that we are more dangerous than any imaginable AI machine, and hence if there is any thought of a future AI obliterating us, rest assured, that we will not give such a machine a first hand chance, for we will obliterate ourselves before an AI acquires consciousness,
In conclusion, when one asks the question about AI being conscious, my answer (in lines with Dr. Caster) is: ""I am still trying to understand whether I am self aware and conscious..."". The problem is that this question in itself is wrong, A question that has no well-defined meaning, cannot have a well-defined answer. Such a question is an example of humanity's artificial ""knowledge"" or ""intelligence"". So, stop worrying about AI machines, start worrying about human brain entanglement into artificial thoughts. Explore why we are on this beautiful planet, and TRANSCEND YOURSELF...",1406073600,5,3149,5.069364161849711

Transcendence brilliantly fused the two seemingly opposing fields, and raises the age old philosophical question: is it the body or the mind that constitutes a person?

The augment for ""body"" is feeble as our physical properties are constantly changing (i.e. the you today look very different from when you were just a baby), propelling ""mind"" proponents to make movies such as Freaky Friday, in which a spell causes the mom and the daughter to switch their ""minds"". The majority of the audiences clearly agree that the mom is now the daughter and vice versa, and therefore accepting that it's the mind that makes up a person's identity.

But what is the mind? Our society as a whole makes the assumption that we all have a mind of our own because we all have a brain of our own, thus, identical brains produce identical minds. For instance, when characters in Star Trek travel in the speed of light, which requires the atoms of their bodies to be broken up during the ""journey"" then put back together upon arrival of the destination, their memories and ""minds"" continue as if they had just gotten in and out of a cab ride. But can we really guarantee that one will retain the same ""mind"" after breaking up a brain and putting it back together? Yet, the better question would be, even if we can completely reconstruct a person, can we consider him/her the same person? i.e. if we had the technology to not only clone people, but also insert their memories into the clone, would you consider your clone you just becuase you are composed of same DNA and have the same set of memories? Before you jump to no as your answer, think about what the real differece is between the mind of your clone and yours when waking up from a long night of sleep. What makes you, you?

While there is no way to answer such question with our understanding of the world today, Transcendence presents a fascinating take on the subject. This is a must see if you are someone who appreciates movies that make you think.",1405900800,7,2264,4.582716049382716

6335367,2,B00J5JSV3A,"""I think we have an opportunity to do something great here."" Will Caster (Depp) is the leading scientist when it comes to artificial intelligence. His aim is to make a machine that has the same feelings and emotions as a human. This goal puts him on a collision course with activists that winds up with Will getting seriously wounded. Knowing what is going to happen to him Will decides to ""upload"" himself into a computer. Will becomes ""reborn"" and has the ability to connect to anything he wants. This new power he has soon begins to worry his wife and friends and they start to question if he and they did the right thing. This is a movie that can be summed up as disappointing. I didn't have very high expectations going in and to be fair the movie was about as good as I was expecting. The disappointing aspect to me is because this is such a neat idea that hasn't been overdone (yet) yet they seemed to not do it justice. The first hour or so of the movie really dragged on and it was hard to stay focused on. The end picked up a little but not really enough to make up for the rest of the movie.

Once more humanity is under attack in a way, and although this sounds
like a typical blockbuster summer theme, there are two main differences.
No special effects and destruction of major cities in this film.
And no fast action against vicious aliens or multiple rocket carrying robots.

Here the enemy is human intelligence itself, when it is upload onto the internet.
Depp is the great scientist that wants to help the human race progress through
a powerful Artificial Intelligence system. But after an attack by anti technology terrorists against all the AI
labs, the scientist's brain is uploaded to a server and then to the internet by his lover, Rebecca Hall.
And then things become even more weird, and the entity that Depp has become by existing in the internet
tries to expand its power and create another humanity.

If what I have written above seems confusing then it's OK. As I said this is a movie to
stimulate the brain, and make you think about technology, the internet, ethics, etc.
Great food for though for endless conversations with your friends!

an all powerful weapon, that makes even AI do stupid things.

In Act 1 of this absurdly conflicted screed, Luddite terrorists use a radioactive bullet to murder a scientist (Johnny Depp) who's in the process of inventing strong AI. Before he dies, the scientist succeeds in uploading his mind into his computer. This is where things get really confused.

In Act 2, the scientist builds an underground lair where he begins to cure disease, heal the environment, invent fast growing nanotechnology, and generally save the world. But wait!! We can't have some solar-powered maniac going around curing people, giving them superhuman strength and intelligence, and healing the environment, dammit!

Since the future of continued war, pollution, and human folly is at stake, suddenly the Luddite terrorists become the ""good guys,"" trying to stop the evil cyborg.

With his life at stake, Dr. Caster's mind is downloaded into a computer (with the assistance of his wife and best friend). Now fully uploaded, Dr. Caster's consciousness expands across the globe and begins to make some amazing advancements and discoveries. But is it really Doctor Caster in that computer? Or is it something that is more mind than heart?

This movie tries to ask a lot of complicated questions, but it fails to ask them very well. Filmed with an incompetent sense of dramatics, both sides of the conflict -- our grubby anti-techies and the nano-roboticized techno-hippies -- come across as equally vacuous and just as devoid of emotion. Not a whole lot of ideas are explored in the debate, either through dialogue or action, as the terrorists take it as a given that this new computer consciousness is bad, and the Computerized Caster -- a dry-as-dirt Depp shown mostly on computer screens -- takes progress and world-wide unification as a given good. There are a few tiny cases to be made on either side -- Caster develops some amazing regenerative abilities to heal both humans and the world; there is a sense (not completely explored or explained), though, that they require the sublimation of a human's personality or self -- but the movie isn't concerned about any of the fine points here. All it wants is a long, loopy plot of people versus machine, and it gives you two hours of it without once giving you any real reason to care about either side.

The closest you get to a sympathetic character is Caster's wife, who rejoices through his research, struggles through his death, perseveres through his rebirth, and then agonizes through life as the wife to a computer program. She's probably the best part of this film, although she constantly seems as bewildered and unmoored as the audience. And since she's got the only emotional heartstrings worth holding onto for the movie, that means any right-thinking viewer is going to be left equally alienated by this philosophical mess of a movie. By refusing to take a stance -- heck, by refusing to even show the passionate arguments to be made on both sides of the issue, instead just showing how dehumanizing they both can be -- the movie turns the possible death and/or evolution of all of humankind into one of the most muddled and uninteresting things since jumbled software code.",1404691200,3,2816,4.913865546218488
6335437,5,B00J5JSV3A,"Like many, I did not see this movie when it was in the theaters.  I was under the impression it would be another ""Skynet"" themed excursion.  I was wrong.

I do not want to add any spoilers but In its essence, this is a movie about ideology and faith.

On the one side you have a group of radicals that believe mankind would be better without technological advancement.  Their faith in their ideology leads to them using extreme measures to get their point across.

On the other, you have some who believe no matter how far technological advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI) goes, it will still lack the capacity to feel, to love.

Both groups tend to view AI as a threat as its influence becomes manifest.

Then there are some who believe in the potential of AI to be something more. They seek to develop it in the hope of healing the sick and saving the planet.  They also believe AI can help man reach a higher plain of existence through a process they call transcendence.

How these differing views play out is the focus of the movie.  The viewer will be influenced by his or her own belief system into choosing a side.

It is only at the end we begin to comprehend the message.  The film's score is muted and sometimes melancholy, but it is appropriate for the mood.

At least with that first experiment there are plausible possibilities for reunion. Not only that, but a human in digital form could theoretically process information at the same speed as the fastest computers, plus utilize human-style reasoning and problem-solving skills - which computers have not previously achieved. The inevitable and shockingly fast jumps in technologies, including physical human evolution - and the fears and doubts that accompany it - are explored emotionally and intellectually with engaging performances by the actors. The performance that stands out most in my mind is that of Rebecca Hall who plays Evelyn, the wife of main character, Will (Johnny Depp's character). It was easy to feel what seemed like her genuine emotions - conflict, relief, love, grief, fear, uncertainty - you name it. Her performance reminds me of the enthralling work of Olivia Williams as Anna in The Sixth Sense.

An unpredictable plot and logical characterization make this film a winner.  You will change your mind about characters more than once during the film.

Nice and logical twists await you.  Whose side will you end up on?

From the ominous soundtrack of the beginning scenes to the horror of violence displayed by seemingly ""nutjob"" anti-technology terrorists to the mystery of what Will has become, Transcendence drags you by the throat, enthralled till its very last scene!  And yet it ends in a way that provokes such profound thought in viewers!!!

You will not walk away from this movie and soon forget it.  Beautifully done.  Incredible effects.  Transcendence highlights ""science fiction"" ideas which WE are just now beginning to incorporate into our current lives and warns us of an inevitable future.

Will we create new gods?  Is Will a weak reflection of our current source/god/gods (depending on what you believe)?  Will we fix the world and humanity at a cost?  Is the cost worth it?  What is consciousness?  When freed from the flesh, what are we capable of?  Is transcended Will all an illusion, a deft and convincing program mimicking its human starting point?  Is Transcendence where we are headed?  Can humans and A.I. coexist?

Let me tell you something, THIS film will have you rehashing and contemplating every thing you know about technology and its possible applications.  From Star Trek's the Borg to Blade Runner to Wall-E to I Robot to the Terminator series--aspects of all of these beloved stories are now inching their way into our REAL WORLD.

6335477,4,B00J5JSV3A,"Warning: spoilers down below

First time Director Wally Pfister, best known for his collaborative work as Christopher Nolan's Cinematographer, delivers a solid, gorgeous meditation on the potential benefits and dangers of melding man and machine together. When Will Caster (Johnny Depp) is shot with an irradiated bullet by a member of R.I.F.T., a radical anti tech group lead by Bree (Kate Mara), Will's wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) decides to try and save him by uploading his consciousness into a super computer. While Max (Paul Bettany) has his doubts and reservations about this, he helps his long time friends out. They ultimately do succeed in uploading Will before Max becomes too scared and leaves, getting abducted by Bree and her followers shortly after. Will then guides Evelyn to a rundown town in the middle of nowhere, where over the next 2 years Will becomes stronger while Evelyn helps him build an underground lab. I'll try not to divulge too much of what happens after all this but I do believe the film gets more right than wrong and is better than most people give it credit for.

I can think of several potential reasons why people either disliked or simply weren't interested in seeing it. Captain America was/is still in theaters, Transcendence was released on Good Friday and most people took the day off for religious reasons, the idea that a consciousness can be uploaded into a computer suggests that the body does not have a soul and is thus atheist, alienating several religious groups, the film was marketed as an action type thriller, the film was too slow, too many plot holes and/or leaps of logic, people just simply thought it wasn't a very good movie etc.

As I mentioned in the title of this piece, I think the film is a counterpoint to The Terminator, much in the same vein as M. Night Shyamalan's film Unbreakable, (still his best in my not so humble opinion) which could be viewed as a viable counterpoint to the comic book films of today. Instead of the machine becoming sentient and attempting to wipe out humanity because they have been deemed inferior, we get the machine with a, ahem, human soul who wants to help humanity out by bettering them and the world at large (ecologically speaking). The price for this of course is the potential to lose one's individuality and become part of a singular consciousness (like the Borg from Star Trek). Whether or not that's a better or worse alternative to being wiped out by a nuclear holocaust I'll leave open for debate. I will admit it did feel refreshing to not see one over the top action sequence piled on top of another, although I'm sure most people who went in to see the movie before me would heartily disagree.

Granted, the film does have its short comings. The fact that Will rewrote his source code after being uploaded would render the virus Max created later in the film ineffective would be the biggest (as pointed out by the film's Goof section on imdb). And the fact that virtually no press or news reporters were involved was rather vexing. But any of these could be comparable to any of the huge plot holes/errors found in Christopher Nolan's Inception or the Fascist ideology that makes up his Dark Knight Trilogy. Unfortunately Mr. Pfister did not have Batman or the enormous, memorable action set pieces Mr. Nolan is best remembered by his audiences for to back him up and ensure boxoffice glory. Transcendence is basically an art film with a Hollywood budget.

I'll only pause briefly at the end here to applaud Mr. Pfister's wonderful decision to shoot on anamorphic 35mm film with no digital intermediate. The results speak for themselves visually. Sometimes the old ways simply are the best. Technology should not replace that which has come before it until it has surpassed all previous limitations.

As for the ending of the film, it looks like Bree and R.I.F.T. got their wish when all the tech in the world got virtually (no pun intended) destroyed by Max's plot hole virus. But is that really a good thing? Mr. Pfister only pauses to show us the lights going off in one or two cities and no airplanes crashing into them, although I must say I've had more than my fill of those types of images in the past 12 or 13 years. We get the sense that things have descended into Martial Law and possibly chaos, but I wish there could have been some character resolution for Bree in this regard, given the part she played in helping bring it all about. I guess, since there won't be a sequel to this particular Spring/Summer film (remarkably) I'll just have to ponder what a future world without any tech (but with some of Will's water nanites) would be like. Or I could just start getting into NBC's Revolution TV show. But I think I'll pass.

Then the ""runaway technology"" theme gives this a familiar feel even when the specific technology is not one of the usual suspects. People lining up to have their flaws and ailments fixed - and, incidentally, to be turned into loyal minions - adds a strong element. After all, don't people grasp at the flimsiest straws when faced with death or illness, consequences be damned?

Then there was that sudden jump, where Evelyn's loyalties shifted abruptly, a magical virus, and a few other bits that seemed thrown together, just so the story would wind down. Great effects, strong beginning, then not much.

6335482,4,B00J5JSV3A,"From the trailers, critical panning and instant death at the box office, I was expecting something along the lines of Jack Sparrow meets The Lawnmower Man. With such low expectations, I was surprised at the relatively thoughtful and unusual film that unfolds, despite its many flaws and problems. It's the sort of movie that's going to leave everybody slightly unhappy from Johnny Depp fans to action movie junkies and technophiles, like it's the committee result of a great concept trying not to offend anyone.

Drawing on many popular science ideas especially those in The Singularity Is Near, Transcendence is neither a technology nor an action film and treads a difficult line between technobabble and trying to engage the audience with a concept that's hard to portray on film. The lead into the topic with Depp's character getting shot by a anti-AI terrorist probably isn't the best way to get the story started and the first 20 minutes is full of voiceover and exposition just to get the thing moving. As it continues, it struggles the find the heart of a story in a compelling idea, playing more to the dramatic cords of Frankenstein's monster than  finding something new.

For anyone with more of a passing interest in the transcendence idea, the leap between Depp's physical death and his conscience reemerging in a machine is horribly glossed over. It's simply assumed that once Depp has downloaded his brain and engaged in a couple of days of language training that his mind magically appears in the computer when he passes. This is a shame since perhaps the biggest question of our time gets swept under the carpet for the convenience of having enough screen time left to show the audience some neat CG tricks.

On the plus side, visually it's excellent, with Pfister's background helping enormously in framing each shot. Thrown into the director's chair no doubt with Christopher Nolan's help, it would be easy to mistake this for a Nolan film from the look though the weaker storytelling belies who's calling the shots. Surprisingly the usual Nolan cast don't add much here (Rebecca Hall is flat and Morgan Freeman and Cillian Murphy misused). Johnny Depp is a surprisingly weak casting choice too and isn't convincing as the brilliant computer scientist behind the software.

Transcendence eventually has to ditch the story of the benevolent God-like force and tread familiar territory in act 3 when Depp gets taken down. His downfall will have eyes rolling throughout the theater, especially as it starts to work in some vague environmental message way too late into the flick, and the ending will be confusing for many. As summer blockbusters go it's smarter than most but can't quite find its rhythm in what might have been ultimately better as a TV series.",1402272000,,2776,4.961290322580645

If you could save the love of your life, who happens to be one of the greatest minds in history, do you? Should you?

What did I think?

A visually sumptuous film with huge philosophical questions tied up in the not-so-impossible science-fiction theme of digitising a human brain. There are some obvious plot holes, but as a what if to spark conversation about the future of humanity it is an equal to Blade Runner (from the opening shot the tears in the rain quote ran through my head regularly).

Unlike The Lawnmower Man, which this has been unfairly compared to, the deep love between the two lead characters is the crux of this story  driving it towards its devastating conclusion.",1401580800,4,703,4.682926829268292
6335484,5,B00J5JSV3A,As I have only seen different trailers for it as it has not been released as of yet I know I am going to love it and Depp is one of the best actors around.,1401321600,2,155,3.4571428571428573
6335485,4,B00J5JSV3A,"Transcendence is the directorial debut from acclaimed cinematographer Wally Pfister about what would happen if a human mind were to be transferred into a supercomputer, and in this case, the consciousness of Dr. Will Caster, after he is shot by a member of the radical group RIFT (Revolutionary Independence From Technology).

The film really isn't bad, and I think many mistake the bad reviews as critics actually panning the film. Most critics didn't hate the film, but the majority of them (as well as myself) hated the story's pacing and structure. The thing was, if you split the film in half, the first half jumps all over the place. Now, i wouldn't have minded this if they gave us a timeline to work with, but they didn't. They jumped a full year without even saying, and then when two years went by, they decided ""what the heck."" But, the second half was pure brilliance. It ended the way it should have, and the questions it raised were both creepy and intriguing. Now i would say the best part of the film was not the visuals, but Wally Pfister's direction. After working with Christopher Nolan for so long, I was pretty sure he picked up some tricks, and he did. His eye for visuals, the eye-popping scenery and flow of the film was grand and glorious. There's even a scene where slow motion is used on something as insignificant as a truck driving through a puddle of water, but the way it was captured, the sparkling liquid thrown into the air; breath-taking. The acting was good, but sadly nothing award-winning. Johnny Depp was good, and played his character well, going from a normal person to a lifeless AI, but in the third act, he was suddenly filled with emotion and life. Rebecca Hall was great as Will's wife, Evelyn Caster. A researcher who wanted to change the world, but is torn between caring for her husband or seeing what he's becoming. But it's Paul Bettany who steals the show as Max, Will's and Evelyn's best friend, as well as a fellow researcher. He knows there's something wrong with this ""thing"" that Will became, but he also sees his friend, and it creates a deeply personal conflict. I did a review for the musical score separately on the official page, but on other parts of the film, the cinematography was beautifully haunting (and award-worthy), the editing was good, and the visual effects were great. But, if anything in this movie were to win an award, I'd say the production deserves it, or at least a nomination. It was truly impressive, and happily not overlooked.

Overall, Transcendence is a really good thriller with some very intelligent inquiries about human life and technology, but sadly due to poor pacing and structure, the film falls short from greatness. Still, a must-see; a must-own if you love Christopher Nolan's style (Pfister really brought it here). But don't let the critics keep you from seeing it, because most of them liked the movie, but despised the uneven script.",1400198400,89,2936,4.743639921722114
6335486,5,B00J5JSV3A,"This was a good movie, from start to finish. And the best thing about the movie was they wrapped it up in one movie, 2 hours long. I do NOT know why that Johnny Depp gets a bad rap from the critics. The only bad one I basically seen him star in was The Lone Ranger and that was 2 1/2 of my life I'll never get back.

However The Matrix was ""widely regarded as one of the greatest science fiction films of all time"" produced by The Wachowski Brothers and the Warner Sister Dot. ""The Matrix belongs to the cyberpunk genre of science fiction."" Folks, did all of you cyberpunks see The Matrix 2 & 3??? One sequel took down everything they created and they made a third one. Impressive.

I enjoyed this movie because (a) I am a network technician and (b) I have wondered at times how much do we push technology. Just look at cell phones and what they are now; iPads; we went from modems (and if you were cooking at 48K, that was incredible) to cable modems at home that can give you 50 gb per second. The point of this is the point of this movie; how far to we push? How much is too much?

Just for the record I loved the Matrix. I still do. 2 & 3? Now there's 5 hours of me life gone! No more!

The bottom line here is: just enjoy the movie for what it is and you people that want to go on about the plot of this movie was ridiculous and unbelievable; hmmm? And the Matrix wasn't?

6335488,4,B00J5JSV3A,"If you're reading this review, you probably skipped this in theaters and wonder if it's worth a buy on Blu-Ray.  It is.  This is the most under-rated movie I am aware of ... I suspect it will become a quiet cult classic and I look forward to watching it again.

After watching the movie, I read a handful of critical reviews to see what the problems were.  Mostly, critics panned ""plot holes"" and ""logical errors,"" but every specific complaint I read was actually addressed within the movie.  (Explicitly even, through dialogue.)

I suspect the problem is this: the movie is a slow-burn drama and open to several channels of interpretation.  One of the central questions of the story is whether or not Dr. Caster was successfully ""uploaded,"" or if the machine is something else altogether.  The movie provides a couple of suggestions, and it does favor one over the other, but it allows you to draw your own conclusions.

Such is the nature of a lot of the plot points.  You get to decide who the villains are and who the good guys are (if there are any).  You get to decide how a machine can (or can't) reconcile love.  You get to decide the meaning of the ""religious"" imagery that enters the movie partway through.  The film is brilliantly nuanced, and it seems to have compelling arguments for both sides on pretty much every issue it presents -- which bothered a lot of the people in the theatre.  My interpretation of the movie was satisfying, yours may not be.  I've read a lot of comments on the internet as to why someone hated the ""message"" or the ""plot"" and almost every single time I find myself thinking, ""But that's not the way I saw it.""

Even if you go into this movie not caring so much about the philosophical aspects, it functions as a beautiful, yet oh-so-messed-up, love story that brought a tear to my eyes.

The movie does have a couple of failings ... there are exactly two moments that come across as cheesy.  One of these moments is at the beginning (this won't spoil anything): a student asks Dr. Caster if he's basically trying to create his own ""god"" through technology.  The line itself was a bit cheesy, but the acting was so over-the-top, I don't understand why the studio didn't mandate a re-shoot.

Some of the technology may seem a bit ""fantastic"" to those who have never picked up the tech section of the New York Times, and I'm hoping that a second viewing will answer a question I had about the nature of an injection that happens in the third act of the film.  Be warned: this is NOT an action film, and you will have to pay attention to the dialogue and form your own opinions as you go along to have a pleasant viewing experience.  Even then, your opinions will be continually challenged, and it's a fun back-and-forth if you like that sort of thing.  (I do.)

UPDATE: The quality of the Blu-Ray itself is a disappointment.  It appears they've applied a fair amount of DNR to the image, which *does* affect the level of detail, contrary to what you may read elsewhere, and it affects it drastically.  It's especially disappointing, because the detail and grain were part of what made the image so intriguing in theatres.

The audio mix is excellent, so no complaints there.  But the special features are essentially non-existent -- you'll get through everything in 15 minutes.  (Literally.)  The ""viral"" videos are included, which is nice.  A commentary with the writer would have been a fantastic addition, but I suppose you can't fault Warner for not wanting to spend time/money on a film that flopped in the box office.

With that in mind, I'll step down the recommendation to ""worth a buy, but make sure you get a good price for it.""",1399248000,316,3677,4.583460949464012
6335489,2,B00J5JSV3A,"Transcendence is a film that might be worth seeing once it gets to a discounted DVD, but viewers should expect a fairly low-key movie rather than a blockbuster. The poor script - specifically its free-floating cardboard cut-out characters - proves to be the movie's main problem. The script also fails in terms of conveying the science involved.  Scientist characters say stuff that sounds-like-science but is actually really dumb (if you known anything about science). The script gives no one - not the scientists, the lone FBI guy, or the terrorists - any real believability.  These are all supposed to be intelligent highly educated people, driven by passions and ideas.  Pitted against a super-intelligent AI. Instead we get a script that seems like some third-rate romance writer's idea of a thriller, but put on the screen at the cost of $100m. Everything is made to come a poor third to the central love story, with the huge cracks in the science pasted over with the occasional nice special effect and some mumbo-jumbo dialogue.  It's just about bearable until half way through.  Then the movie just gets really silly, and it tails off into a ludicrous and disappointing ending.  Maybe that doesn't matter. Maybe all the movie-going public wants is a rather crude mix of three ideas vaguely explained in 'pop science' terms, and predictably presented in the context of a fairly standard-issue love story. But I don't believe that - there's now a proven and huge market for really intelligent and challenging movies. This certainly isn't one of those movies, and doesn't even come close to its obvious inspirations (2001 and Contact).  The central actors all do their job well, the set design and lighting is strong, the cinematography and sound is all workmanlike.  The music stays well in the background, but does its job.  But the weak script, with its uniformly wooden characterisation and its dumb science, just drags the whole movie down.",1399161600,11,1951,5.015479876160991
