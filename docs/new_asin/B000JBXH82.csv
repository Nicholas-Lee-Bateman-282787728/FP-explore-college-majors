2669191,5,B000JBXH82,Anyone who enjoys comedy and is somewhat of a liberal will love this.,1168300800,,69,4.384615384615385
2669192,5,B000JBXH82,"My rather abrupt introduction to comedian Sacha Baron Cohen was in the ""Borat"" movie. I read an interesting review and went to see it. It was a bit of a shock, to say the least. I was laughing at the opening credits and it just got better and better. Cohen must be a comic genius to create a character simultaneously appealing and appalling and funny, funny, funny. My companion and I were laughing about the movie for weeks thereafter. Then, on Christmas Eve a present of  ""Da Ali G Show - Da Compleet Seereez"" appeared as a present under the tree. We watched it over the next several nights. It was outrageous, offensive, and funny, much along the same line as the ""Borat"" movie.

Cohen appears as three alter egos: Borat, Bruno and Ali G. In each character he interviews or otherwise reacts with people, some quite prominent, who apparently don't know the situation. Some come off quite well. Some come off as complete fools. Some of the interviews are just embarrassing. How Cohen can get people to step into this kind of situation is a mystery to me but the results can be hilarious and it's fun to see such prominent people set up as a joke. I might add that a lot of people find much of the humor to be juvenile and offensive. Personally, I thought it very funny in that it gets you to laugh at the whole ridiculous human situation and, in the broad sense, you're laughing at yourself. Some people derive deep political meanings out of the humor. I don't. It's just good fun. Relax and have a good laugh.

A comparison between the ""Borat"" movie and ""Da Ali G Show"" seems to be in order. Well, I liked the ""Borat"" movie best. First of all, Borat (the character) is the most engaging of the three Cohen characters. Second, the movie has more of a story to it rather than being a series of unrelated vignettes. But, take you choice. Both are first-rate entertainment from a comic genious. Hilarious!

2669193,5,B000JBXH82,"Big ups for Sacha Baron Cohen's overwhelming success.  Unfortunately, it bookends his brilliant series Da Ali G Show on HBO.

The show is fantastic, and having Da Compleet Seereez in one set is phenomenal, and addictive.

Buy this. Watch it one thousand times, then track down the original English series on vhs.

Regardless of your politics or point of view, you'll find something redeeming and genuine in Ali G, Borat and Bruno.

This is a must have in the comedy collection.  Truly groundbreaking work.",1166313600,9,505,4.9523809523809526
2669194,5,B000JBXH82,"I discovered Sacha from watching Borat, but Ali G is freaking hilarious!  I think I actually prefer his Ali G character more than Borat.  It's amazing how he convinces professionals in highly respected fields (the police force, CIA, religious figures, congressmen, politicians, and so on) to go on interviews.  He asks them the dumbest questions which is what makes it all so hilarious.  If you have any hesitations of purchasing it, just go to the youtube website and watch a clip of the skit called  ""ice cream glove"" in which he pitches an idea to Donald Trump and a plethora of other highly influential business leaders about the importance of gloves when eating ice cream. There is also a skit in which he is trying to publish a book, and he tells the publishers that he wrote a book on the film ""The Lord of the Ring"" without realizing that the film is based on a book.

In all seriousness, the skits when Borat goes to America hold a deeper meaning for me.  I believe that Borat is trying to bring to light the conservative views and values of the Southern United States, kind of telling and explaining to the rest of the world why Bush was reelected.  He wants to demonstrate how conservative our country really is, and how the older generations are still pretty ignorant about their views on race, homosexuals and other minority groups or groups with opposing views.  Even in his major US film release, he stopped at a church in Texas where there were judges and congressmen preaching in a church.  I believe in the seperation of church and state.

Anyway...the DVD is excellent, and in case you are wondering it does work in the US region.  Also the packaging is pretty nifty.",1164672000,16,1686,4.620805369127517

These are solid dvd's that will make you and your friends laugh to the point of almost crying.  The popularity of this show in HBO is what spawned Borat and Bruno being big US movies (I believe Ali G Indahouse was a British Production that occurred before this show in the US, but not 100% there.)

2669325,5,B000JBXH82,"After seeing the individual releases of the first and second seasons of Da Ali G Show on sale here at Amazon for a total of about 17 bucks, I immediately added them to my cart. So think about comparing the price of the individual first and second season releases to this combo pack before you buy. The DVDs arrived earlier this week, my older son and I watched all 12 episodes in two nights, and we laughed out loud like it was the first time we ever saw the show. Well, actually it was the first time my son saw the show, and he got his first lessons in Socratic Irony.

The Ali G character is funny, and remember it is this series that also introduced the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borat/dp/B002M4CEZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Br-uuml-no/dp/B002P7UCJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Br&uuml;no</a>&nbsp;characters to the US as well. Sacha Baron Cohen takes his characters, puts them in interview mode with unassuming real people--often famous people--that believe they are actually participating in some kind of talk show. And the result is usually hilarity. The funniest part being the reaction to each character by the people that he is duping. Cohen's Ali G character (a stereotypical hip-hop, British ghetto banger TV host), Borat (a Kazakhstani reporter naive to US culture), and Br&uuml;no (a stereotypical gay mannerismed TV host) have the same modus operandi....And that modus operandi is Socratic Irony; Cohen's characters deliberately feign ignorance in order to expose weakness in the commitment that people have to being so politically correct that they almost always seriously (attempt to) answer the ridiculous opinions and questions that Cohen's characters come up with. Hence, his victims look equally stupid.

The only victim that I ever saw that had enough intelligence to quickly walk out of the situation without any regard to whether or not he was offending a Cohen character (Ali G) was Donald Trump.

Even if you were a fan of this show almost 10 years ago now, trust me when I say that if the last time you saw the show (like me) was when it was on HBO, you will enjoy watching these episodes again today just as if it were the first time you were seeing them.

If you've never seen this show: Check. It. Out. But don't be fooled into being offended by any of the Cohen characters. They are not real; the man behind the mask really isn't that stupid. He's trying to make YOU look stupid. And if you take Cohen's characters seriously, you will indeed look stupid. You see? Socratic Irony.

2669374,5,B000JBXH82,"For real! There are no other DVDs in my collection that I've watched as often as the Ali G show. Some of those interviews I've seen over a dozen times or more, but they still crack me up every time. The comic genius of the twenty first century, Ali G is THE comic force of our times, combining an incredibly sharp wit with exposure of various social issues, as well as giving an insight to some of the greats (or so-called) who have graced the world's political or social stage. Those interviewees who arrogantly thought they were dealing with some brainless hip-hopper, often revealing a dark racism lying not very deep in their own characters, are shown up to be the brainless ones, while in pulling off such a feat Sacha Baron Cohen proves to have a vast intellect and razor-sharp wit. The fact that the same man can play the roles of Ali G, Borat and Bruno equally well is frankly mind-boggling. Playing just one of those characters would indicate a man of unique talent, but all three? Sacha Baron Cohen, I bow down to you - the greatest comic genius ever to come out of Britain!",1308528000,2,1084,4.47979797979798
2669375,5,B000JBXH82,A ridiculous show that pretends to be a serious interview show while Ali G just makes a mockery of whoever the subject of the interview is while making them thing that he is the crazy one. Good summary? Perhaps. Good show? Definitely.,1308268800,2,234,4.595238095238095
2669376,5,B000JBXH82,"The movie Ali G wasn't very funny but this HBO box set of the Da Ali G show is easily as funny as either movie ""Borat"" or ""Bruno"", which were true tear-jerkers.  Da Ali G Show, less than a half hour per episode, divides into one part Ali G, one part Borat, and one part Bruno.  So actually if you're just getting into Sacha Baron Cohen this is a good place to start.  Special features include some unreleased stuff, mostly hilarious, a Harvard guest speech at graduation, and a commentary over the first show of the first season with one of the crew and Cohen himself.  I would've liked to have heard how they finally got license to put this stuff on the show - I suppose it's a journalistic right to publish anything if an interviewee grants you an interview?  I wonder if the ""guests"" on his show receive any royalties from HBO or the DVD, etc...

There are only 6 shows per season, so that's around 3 hours total per season.  The box set is obviously a good deal for a total of 6 hours.  Both seasons are rivitingly hilarious, though if I had to choose perhaps I'd choose the second as better than the first, though there were lots of good stuff in both and it's very easy to watch a whole season in one sitting.  You don't want to stop.  And it's amazing the guests he gets on his show - Sam Donaldson from ABC news, Andy Rooney from 60 minutes (he doesn't take too much of Ali G's crap), ministers, men of science, women in all walks of life, Darryl Gates LAPD police cheif, a guy from the DEA, former presidential advisors, Noam Chomsky, fashion gurus, club owners, all variety of everyday people - he's relentless.  It's almost surreal to see these distinguished personages being interviewed by the likes of Ali G.

I've just ordered a few sets of the British stuff which was made prior to this HBO production and is shot in England.  I'm assuming I won't recognize many of the interviewees on that show.  Yes, I have a 'region-free' DVD player which will make this viewing possible (UK = PAL region 2 discs that don't play on standard US players).  Reading customer reviews on those discs (on Amazon.uk) I recall one reviewer comparing the UK stuff to the later HBO stuff shot in America, and she said something like 'perhaps we don't take ourselves quite as seriously as those in America..""  I haven't seen the UK stuff yet, so I can't really compare yet, but it just seems to me it would be easier to victimize Americans more easily than British, because Ali G is British, so first of all, no one in England is going to be looking at him as a ""foreigner"" to begin with.  He accent, while obviously tripped out to the rastafarian umpth degree is still British so it seems like it would still be a little harder to put over on your own people.  Whereas in the States, Ali G's British accent alone makes him slightly exotic - add to that all the other stuff and these poor interviewees are really just trying to comprehend how ""different"" the world is beyond our borders.  And this is not even bringing up Borat.  Anyway, it's a good expirament and a fun one to watch.  It's truly unique in the annals of comedy that someone could pull this off.  If you haven't seen the Ali G Show yet and you liked ""Borat"" or ""Bruno"" the movies, don't hesitate.  You'll hurt from laughing so much.",1303862400,3,3289,4.408940397350993

2669413,5,B000JBXH82,"I had a great political science professor as an undergraduate, Jim Ranchino, a student of William Appleman Williams.  Nothing angered Ranchino so much as lightly examined or passively accepted ideas.  His goal as a professor, he said, was to raise our ""B.S. quotient.""  To this end, he would try to make us challenge him.  On occasion he would do his best to make his students challenge him, to force us to refuse to accept him as an authority, even intentionally lying for the entire class period, making up increasingly outrageous ""facts"" about, say, the war in the Pacific in WW II or the beliefs of some political philosopher.  His goal was not to get us to ingest a certain body of ""facts,"" but to get us to question, to challenge, and confront.

I think Jim Ranchino would have appreciated Sascha Baron Cohen's humor.  His three alter egos - Ali G., Borat, and Brno - are among the most challenging comic characters to have appeared in the past couple of decades.  They are challenging both because Cohen uses them to challenge and satirize our almost limitless gullibility.  Ali G. is a brilliant caricature of wannabes, people who are so fake that they themselves are unaware of it.  We don't know what Ali G.'s real name is, but we know that he is a white, upper-class twit.  He talks of ""Keeping it real,"" yet he is so self-deceived that he can confront his viewers by asking, ""Haven't you ever seen a black man before?""  So on one level we laugh at Ali G. because he is a self-deceived idiot, but on another we laugh at the people who are taken in by his fraud.  And since many of the people Ali G. deceives are people that we look up to in our culture, the joke is on us as well.  Cohen's strategy is perhaps best seen in a skit where Brno interviews a man in charge of a fashion show and asks him a string of questions that directly contradict one another, such as ""Why was everything so light?"" follows by ""Why was everything so heavy?""  His final question in the interview is, ""Is consistency important to you?""

Of course, this constant puncturing of the pretensions of our culture would be merely an intellectual exercise if the series wasn't also hysterically funny.  There are times in DA ALI G. SHOW when I laugh about as hard as it is possible for me to laugh.  There are also times when I merely winch.  Cohen is almost always on the edge in his humor, which how he likes it.  Much of the time when I watch him, I'm extremely uncomfortable; the rest of the time I'm laughing my head off.  In one scene I might be dying as Ali G. asks Buzz Aldrin, ""Will man ever set foot on the sun?""  (After Aldrin assures him that we will not, ever, because it is too hot, Ali G. asks, ""What if we were to go during the winter?"")  In another I might feel uneasy compassion for some poor soul as Borat shows pornographic Polaroids of him and his sister.  Sometimes his skits show us at our worse, such as the glee with which patrons in a country western bar join Borat in singing ""Throw the Jew Down the Well.""  Are we, we wonder, really that racist beneath the surface?  Or are the people in the bar oblivious as to the meaning of the lyrics?

Cohen has a longstanding interest in prejudice and hatred of otherness.  At Cambridge University his studies were centered on the American civil rights movement in the sixties (I've wondered if his frequent visits to Mississippi on his shows are related to his academic background).  I'm not saying that everything on Cohen's shows has an elevated purpose or is high-minded, but I do believe that it is part of the mix.  Obviously he is first and foremost an entertainer more than willing to take the low road for a laugh, but it is also obvious that his questions often have other purposes.",1248048000,22,3742,4.4602941176470585

BTW - Bruno was my favorite and I'm looking forward to the movie in mid July 2009. I've never seen ""Borat"" and never will now after seeing this DVD set. The best thing about Ali G was the opening sequence of each episode - the suit up. The whip snapping sound of the waist band on his Tommy H shorts was priceless. Still cracks me up.

Quote from another reviewer:
""You end up feeling sorry for the people he interviews instead of laughing at them, and at the same time respecting them for tolerating Mr. Cohen..."" That about sums it ALL up. One segment (repeated twice during the seasons) comes to mind is when Borat has a room full of people stand up and have 10 minutes of silence (for whatever). If someone made a noise he would start the 10 minutes over. Stupid and cruel.

2669416,5,B000JBXH82,"Hilarious. Do you like those uncomfortable situations in Borat and The Office?, where you have to laugh because of how awkward you feel, even as a viewer. That is the comedy in the Da Ali G show.",1222992000,,195,4.297297297297297
2669427,5,B000JBXH82,"A friend of mine made me sit down and watch this show when it was on HBO years ago. At first I didn't understand where this guy was coming from, but then I got it and had to watch every episode she had on tape. This is without a doubt the best in ""cringe television"".

Some of my favorite parts include: an interview with Andy Rooney (60 Minutes) that just goes horribly wrong when Ali G accuses Andy of being ""racialist"", a drunk Borat learns how to become a wine taster and then tearfully tells his hosts that ""his mother didn't love him and said she wishes she had been raped by somebody else"", or when Bruno is talking to a seller at a gun show and asks if it's OK to put the barrel of the gun ""up the poopenshaften"", and keeps referring to the seller as gay...to which the seller makes it very clear to Bruno that ""I'm not gay, and if you ask me another question about being gay, I'm gonna every tooth down your throat"".

Simply put this is one of the funniest shows ever, mostly because a lot of it is made up on the spot depending on what the hapless person being interviewed says as does. As Jim Norton says ""Put on your laughing hat"".

2669428,5,B000JBXH82,"This series is just hilarious - If I ever am in need of a laugh, I know that these are the DVDs to go to.  There is nothing on TV now that makes me laugh this hard!  It's great to see some of the earlier appearances of Borat, and Ali G is such a great platform for awkward interviews.  Love it!!",1212883200,,295,3.80327868852459
2669429,1,B000JBXH82,"I ordered this awhile ago, and never watched it until today. The second season disc has the correct ""Ali G"" label on it, but when you put it in the DVD player, you get an hour-long cartoon called ""Boz the Green Bear."" Extremely un-funny. It's been more than 30 days since it was ordered, so Amazon will not replace it.",1208822400,3,318,4.316666666666666

2669431,3,B000JBXH82,"The british comedian Sacha baron cohen disguises as three different  tv reporters , a hip hop reporter Ali G , a reporter from Kazakhstan Borat and a fashion reporter from Austria Bruno , and interviews people . taking advantage of their hospitality and good will by acting silly and stupid infront of them ,to see how far would they tolerate him . Ali G asks stupid questions from a gangsta point of view , Borat questions comes from an extreme consevative and right wing point of veiw and Bruno is left with gay jokes .

Some times it's funny , some times smart , but most of the time it's just being rude . Sacha never gets out of his disguise at all , which takes away the fun from his  different version of candid camera . You end up feeling sorry for the people he interviews instead of laughing at them , and at the same time respecting them for tolerating Mr. Cohen and not kicking him out of the room . what shocked me the most is that he thinks the reason for their tolerance is their disregard for todays youth , as he said in the commentary for the first episode . by the way  , it's a commentary for one episode only , the first one  , and no more.

A set of four cd's , three episode each , plus extra footage from season one and two .

And yes , Borat is the favorite character .",1196640000,4,1294,4.111111111111111

2669433,5,B000JBXH82,"This DVD was a gift for my dad.... then it was so funny I had to borrow it for myself :P  His characters are each funny in their own way, but the funniest stuff comes from how people react to his characters. In one interview, Bruno is asking a fashion designer questions, but they are all conflicting!!! First he says ""I thought your collection seemed heavy, do you agree?"" and the guy he interviewing agrees and explains that he wanted that, then Bruno says ""You know I thought you collection felt very light, and i felt like I was floating, do you agree?"" and AGAIN the guy aghrees and explains it. Absolutely priceless!",1181174400,3,622,4.504424778761062
2669434,5,B000JBXH82,"This is without a doubt one of the best DVDs sets I own. Yes it is juvenille humor, offensive and embarrassing to watch at times, but my biggest question is HOW DOES HE DO IT???

When Ali G is in his Oprah style talk show setting, complete with chalk drawing of a body under the coffee table, how does hedo these interviews and keep a straight face? How does he keep himself from busting a gut? And his subjects (or victims) more like it. Why do they not catch on to the joke? Do they ever realize this cannot be a serious interview?

ANd what about his other interviews? How does the great buffoon Ali G get to interview Newt Gingrich or stand in the main hall of the UN? It is totally unbelievable who he gets to be on his show. And every interview starts off with ""This is my main man......"" and usually ends with ""You need to listen and learn to my main main here.""

The Borat scenes are as unbelievable as the movie itself. Some of the skits were recycled for the movie, but hey, good material is good material.

The gay Austrian is funny, but my least favorite character. Sure he's funny like when he goes to Alabama (the gayest place in America according to him), he just doesn't make me laugh as much as Borat or Ali G.

Borat will make you laugh as much as Ali G will make you drop your jaw. Great shock value entertainment and worth every penny.",1179532800,2,1355,4.236434108527132
2669435,5,B000JBXH82,"If you like the movie ""Borat - Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"", this is for you. Sacha Baron Cohen makes an outstanding performance at all 3 characters he portrays. Laugh out loud funny.",1175817600,,232,4.9743589743589745

2669457,5,B000JBXH82,"This seereez as he would say is one of the funniest things I have ever seen.  With this in mind, you have to ask your self is this kind of humor for me?  It is a mix of Borat, Ali G, and him as a Fashion Designer (can't remember the name) along with some other characters that are truely ammusing.  Well, if you enjoyed Borat or the Ali G Movie... i am sure this will not disappoint!",1173312000,,383,3.948051948051948
2669458,5,B000JBXH82,"What I enjoyed about buying this series is that you not only get Ali G, but you get Borat and Bruno. At the end of the series there are deleted episodes, that I am suprised they never aired. There is also some fun special features like Ali G speaking to a graduating class at Harvard. If you are a fan of these characters,it's worth buying, especially for all the episodes that you would not have seen on HBO.",1173312000,2,409,4.256410256410256

Cohen does a great job really becoming the characters on the show and as a result gets some hilarious responses from people in his fake interviews.
