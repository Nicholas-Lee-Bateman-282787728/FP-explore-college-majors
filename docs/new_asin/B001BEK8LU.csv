3490093,5,B001BEK8LU,"This is an excellent teenage comedy.  Director T. Sean Shannon  captures teenage life from both genders.  He understands the pressure they face from their peers so well.  Spencer Breslin stars in the title role.  He is the new kid in school who suffers from male pattern baldness.  Harold is teased because of his baldness.  Yet, he is a likeable person who manages to make allies.  Nikki Blonsky does good supporting work as one of Harold's friends.  Stella Maeve is superbly cast as Harold's older sister.  Cuba Gooding Jr is perfectly cast as a janitor who befriends Harold.  I love Harold's oversexed elderly neighbor Maude in the movie.  She is so funny here.  This is such an entertaining movie.  I really enjoyed it.",1221177600,4,723,4.819672131147541
3490094,4,B001BEK8LU,"Most would agree that high school is a hellish experience that one does their best to survive. Anything that makes you stand out from the crowd can leave you open to ridicule and physical and mental torment from others. In the pleasant, independent film Harold, our titular protagonist (Breslin) is faced with a particularly challenging problem: he's a 13-year-old suffering from male-pattern baldness.

Spencer Breslin does a good job playing the sarcastic Harold who eventually learns to live with his affliction. It's hard to believe that this is the same kid who starred in forgettable cinematic dreck like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disney-s-The-Kid/dp/B0000524E4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disney's The Kid</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Santa-Clause-2-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JLQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Santa Clause 2 (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Seuss-The-Cat-In-The-Hat-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JM7T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Seuss' The Cat In The Hat (Widescreen Edition)</a>. In Harold, Breslin demonstrates an aptitude for comedy, delivering his clever quips with the right amount of weary cynicism and a touch of optimism that makes us root for him to succeed.

Harold answers the question, what do the lesser known Saturday Night Live alumni do in their spare time? Rachel Dratch, Chris Parnell and Colin Quinn have small parts as characters that play a role in Harold's life. This is due in large part to director T. Sean Shannon, who got his start as a writer for Saturday Night Live. Obviously, he cashed in a few favours for this film. Harold has a gentle sense of humour that is refreshing because it is never mean-spirited and doesn't resort to nasty gross-out humour. And that, in this day and age, is becoming increasing rare.

""Red Carpet Premiere"" features the cast and crew on the red carpet answering questions about the film.

""Harold"" provides more laughs per minute than any comedy in recent memory.

The premise of Greg Fields' and director T. Sean Shannon's script provides us with a veritable gold mine of sparkling comedy nuggets.  13-year-old Harold has virtually nothing in the world going for him - for not only is he an eternally put-upon, socially awkward nerd, but his early-onset male-pattern-baldness makes people assume he's a middle-age man.  This, of course, leads to a great deal of humiliation and social rejection for the kid - but countless moments of awkward-situation and mistaken-identity hilarity for the audience.  But Harold does have at least two things in his favor: a rapier wit that allows him to hold his own in any situation - no matter how surrealistic and bizarre in nature - and a mature enough understanding of how the world actually works to help him navigate through life's rough waters and emerge a stronger person in the end (at times he seems like Woody Allen as we imagine he might have been right at the onset of puberty).  And it's that spirit of knowing optimism, more than anything else, that purges ""Harold"" of cruelty and makes us laugh WITH rather than AT the character.

I don't know where these guys Fields and Shannon came from, but their script for this film is a gem of originality, tonal balance and understated satire.  In addition, the movie is blessed with an array of outstanding performances, starting with Spenser Breslin, who makes of Harold a thoroughly likeable and wholly relatable figure.  Ditto for the rest of the cast, which includes Ally Sheedy, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Rachel Dratch, Chris Parnell, Stella Maeve, Suzanne Shepherd, Elizabeth Gilles and Robert Gorry.

Together they've made an endearing, hilarious comedy that grinds the over-priced and overpaid Hollywood big boys of the business into the dust.",1327276800,,1859,5.026058631921824
8282882,4,B001BEK8LU,"The cover picture alone inspired me to rent this movie.  The basic premise of a 14-year-old boy with premature male pattern baldness sounded funny, but I wasn't sure if it had enough ""legs"" to fill a 2 hour movie.  In terms of writing and comedic value, ""Harold"" delivers in spades!

The actor who plays Harold (I forget his name) does a great job at capturing a kid's frustration in this type of predicament. He basically is an old man trapped in a kid's body and it's just hilarious to have such a visual contrast.  This contrast sets up most of the jokes in this comedy.

Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the ""creepy"" janitor who becomes a mentor to Harold and helps him adjust to life in a new town. Cuba is surprisingly good in this offbeat role.

The story is well-written and acted by the ensemble cast. It's an independent film with quite a few notable actors but one of the funnier comedies I've seen in the last year. It's not a typical teenage comedy, obviously, but will keep you laughing the whole time.",1231804800,,1006,4.469945355191257
8282883,5,B001BEK8LU,"This comedy is a great way to spend a Saturday night.  A funny indie film that has several laughs throughout.  With many familiar faces from Saturday Nite Live and a great performance by Cuba Gooding, Jr., this movie is a must-have for any DVD collection.

My only criticism of this movie is right at the end - I don't know why the writer(s) needed to make Nikki Blonsky's character's father so flamboyantly gay - it really didn't fit in with the rest of the movie.  Otherwise, I highly recommend it!",1225670400,,500,4.522222222222222
8282884,4,B001BEK8LU,"This indie movie runs like an extended skit from Saturday Night Live, and no wonder - it's directed by T. Sean Shannon (a former SNL writer) and features Chris Parnell, Rachel Dratch and Colin Quinn.  Other familiar names are main characters Spencer Breslin (big bro of Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail); Cuba Gooding Jnr. (in a seriously messed up `fro and a role he's probably already taken off his resume); Ally Sheedy (who nearly has a ""Short Circuit"" playing a ""Maid to Order"" role) and Nikki Blonsky (minus the hairspray)

 Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Harold (Breslin) has a serious problem, or maybe two or three, perhaps even four
2. He's a newbie in a new town, and has to navigate the deadly minefield of High School
3. He suffers from male pattern baldness, and he's just on the brink of his fourteenth birthday
4. He behaves, dresses, walks, talks and gripes like a geezer
5. Everybody from liquor store owners to randy old ladies to strippers think he's an adult.
6. You can see where we're going with this
7. Big-mouthed, big-hearted, sneaky and insubordinate janitor Cromer (Gooding) takes him under his wing, and together they try to clean up Harold's act (or at least plot defense and revenge strategies)
8. Typical h0rny high school comedy storyline (complete with cool kids, bullies and nerds) provides back-up for underlying moral and ethical issues
9. You're not watching this for moral and ethical issues, so watch it for the nerd revenge scenes
10. Reasonably intelligent comedy manages to get laughs without getting overly gross or explicit. (Even with strippers and randy old ladies)

This movie has a simple story line and a cast of easily identifiable actors, but the real draw is Breslin in the title role.  I'd recommend it for ages 14 and up.

Rated: 3.5 stars
