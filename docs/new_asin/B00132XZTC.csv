8554572,3,B00132XZTC,"This is a set of Highland Games Throws Training (2 DVDs - 2x 2h) and Highland Games Weight Training (1 DVD - 30min.)!

Good for learn techniques.
Footage is from old competitions (1995-1997) in very bad video quality in 4:3!
There is nothing about how long to train, how much to train, how many days higland games training and how many weight training... Nothing about workout routins of profis!

Weight Training is newer footage in good DVD quality!
Learn how to train in the weight room for highland games, this is good but again nothing about training routines...

I think this price is expensive for 3 DVD-Rs in not good quality! But this is the only Highland Games Training Video you can find.

For people like me in Europe this is very expensive! Price + shipping + customs duty - toll = 60,-!

The next is very bad package by amazon.com, both DVD boxes are totaly broken with lose DVDs in the box!

Very quick shipping, i got it in few days from USA!",1331510400,2,957,4.471264367816092
8554573,3,B00132XZTC,"Good examples of lifting and throwing techniques, although very poor quality video. The weight training video is much better quality. My main complaint is that there is no advise on how to train, when to train, how much to train. If all you need are videos on how to perform the movements then these are great, but I think most people who feel they need these videos could use some advise on training regiments and some basic workout routines.",1257465600,5,443,4.620253164556962
