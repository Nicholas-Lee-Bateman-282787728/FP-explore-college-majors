474609,5,6302503515,"This is a wonderful bio pic of silver screen great,  Lon Chaney, a character actor of great renown during the silent film epoch. All but one of his films were silent. Due to his ability to alter his appearance and play many roles, he eventually became known as ""the man of a thousand faces"". It is ironic that this man who would forge a meteoric rise in the silent film industry was born to deaf mute parents in 1883.

The film shows the impact that being the son of deaf mute parents would have on his life in those unenlightened times. Lon Chaney (James Cagney)started his acting career as a stage performer in vaudeville, where he was a popular pantomime. His first wife, the beautiful Cleva Creighton (Dorothy Malone), was a chanteuse who had dreams of her own.

 Unfortunately, once Lon Chaney and she discovered that she was to have a baby, their happiness would turn to bitterness and anger, due to Cleva's  shock at discovering that his parents were deaf mutes. Cleva and Lon Chaney would go on to have a son named Creighton, but she later caused a great scandal early in their son's life with a very public attempt at suicide that would change all their lives forever.

This scandal was to end Lon Chaney's stage career, and it sounded the death knell of his marriage. He ultimately divorced Cleva, who had abandoned both him and their son. The divorce resulted, for a time, in his tragic and heartbreaking separation from his beloved, young son. Chaney was to go on to reclaim his career, as well as his son, but would do so on film, rather than on stage, becoming an extremely popular silent film actor.

Lon Chaney was also a doting father who remarried in order to provide a suitable home for his son. His second wife was a former chorus girl named Hazel (Janet Greer). She was a woman who was to prove to be a loving step-mother to Creighton and a devoted wife to Lon Chaney. Always in the background, however, was the specter of Cleva, who was never to regain any of her former glory as a chanteuse and would live a life reduced in circumstances, as a result. She would live to regret her abandonment of their son.

Meanwhile, Lon Chaney was getting ready to take talking pictures by storm.  While still in the prime of his life and at the peak of his film career, he was struck by a terminal illness that was to bring down the curtain for the last time. Bequeathing his acting legacy to his son, Creighton, who would later make his mark in film, renamed as Lon Chaney, Jr., Lon Chaney  would leave the world at the relatively young age of forty-seven.

James Cagney is terrific in the role of Lon Chaney, creating a three dimensional portrait of a man whose childhood was to influence him is so positive a way. A veritable chameleon that was able to change his appearance at will,  Lon Chaney would infuse the characters that he played with much feeling and emotion. His powerful performances would transcend the silence of the films, making him one of the great character actors of the silent film era. James Cagney sums it up best when he performs a bit of the Chaney role in the silent film, ""The Miracle"". If Lon Chaney played it half so well, it is little wonder that he was so popular.

Dorothy Malone is excellent as the beautiful but shallow Cleva, a woman who would inflict much suffering on those who loved her,  but who would also, as a result,  endure much suffering herself, eventually realizing all that she had lost. Janet Greer is perfect in the role of Hazel, Lon Chaney's warm and loving second wife, who would love and raise Creighton as if he were her own son, thereby changing  all their lives for the better.

The supporting cast is also excellent with good performances by Jim Backus as Lon Chaney's agent and publicist. A very young Robert Evans, a real life future film mogul,  plays the role of studio head Irving Thalberg, a man with whom Lon Chaney would have a long term professional relationship. Evans is surprisingly engaging in the small role.  Overall, this is simply a film that those with an interest in Lon Chaney will enjoy, as will those who simply love a good, well-acted film.",1127001600,22,4133,4.53835800807537
474610,5,6302503515,"This film is highly entertaining and stands as an accurate portrayal (as far as I know) of the life of Lon Chaney. It follows his life from when he was a young boy trying to cope with the children making fun of his deaf parents, to when he was a man on the stage with a pregnant wife who could not accept the fact that her son could be born deaf, to when he became a famous screen actor in order to support his son and a second wife.

James Cagney plays the role sympathetically and strongly. His actions are always motivated by something which is a credit to the good script. Cagney looks nothing like the real Chaney, so sketches of the various makeups used for his roles included a wider face, often making them look sillier (especially with The Hunchback of Notre Dame). However, this is no fault to the man himself, just to the casting director. Thankfully, Cagney IS an actor and succeeded in the film at bringing the audience into the life of Lon Chaney and making a worthwhile tribute.",1120694400,4,993,4.396739130434782
474611,5,6302503515,"Truly one of the greatest of all movie stars and a very underated actor this movie glows with Cagney's talent in his depiciton of the life of Lon Chayney.  Unlike so many hollywood bios of the time this move tends to steer away from the usual sanitization of a character and instead confronts the darker side of Chaney, a man beset by torments. Poignant, powerful in it's day with the head on look at how deaf people were treated, and indeed with the tragic aspects of Chayney's first marriage. For me this movie stands the test of time exceptionally well, thanks in no small measure to the performances, notably the conflict between Chaney and his first wife wonderfully played by Dorothy Malone.  This is one of the great ones!",1049414400,25,729,4.6434108527131785
474612,5,6302503515,No actor of our time comes close to james cagney or bogie of course. Cagney shows his versitily in this drama of the life of Lon Chaney. Cagney is GREAT and this movie will hold your interest through the entire 2 hours nothing drags. You will feel such compassion for lon chaney as the age old truth that money and fame can not bring you happiness is still true today. You will see such suffering from a bad marriage and a wife who didn't even want to bear his son because chaney's parents were deaf and dumb she was afraid that her child would be as well. Later she wants to act again and when that doesnt work out she tries to commit suicide. Obviously she is not fit to be a mother and chaney files for divorce and of course gets it but to his shock the court takes his child away from him since he has no wife. Later a female co-worker and friend who was secretly in love with chaney offers to marry him and he accepts they then get the child back. Of course later in life the mother shows up wanting to see her kid who thought she was dead. This is such a touching and realistic story that is all too common now adays you couldn't write a ficton this dramatic. Watch this movie it deserves 10 stars but don't expect gangsters and action this is a drama.,1046390400,4,1258,4.159836065573771
474613,4,6302503515,"""Man of a Thousand Faces"" is a melodramatic vehicle, which allows Cagney to soft-shoe his way through the life and roles of Lon Chaney, famous silent movie actor.
Chaney was born to profoundly deaf parents and this was a major contributor to his success as a silent screen star.  His wordless ability to express great and subtle emotions was legendary.  Chaney's is best remembered today for his portrayals of grotesquely disfigured humans.  He was able to evoke a sympathetic reaction from the audience in his original presentations of Quasimodo and the Phantom of the Opera.
This movie gives Cagney an opportunity to relieve the glory days of vaudeville.  Numerous dance numbers find their way into the picture.  As well as recreating scenes from many of the movies that Chaney was famous for.  Still I can't help but notice that Cagney seems to act like Cagney throughout the picture.  The typical tough-guy loner whose motto is ""my way or the highway"" that we see in so many other films.
The film spends no small amount of time covering Chaney's turbulent first marriage.  The main contention between Chaney and his wife in this movie is anger at his not revealing the dark secret about his parents (their deafness).  Her anger at this secret and his anger at her rejection of his roots leads to a downward spiral in the marriage.  Eventually, Chaney is able to find happiness with an ex-chorus girl and provide the stable home for his son he has always dreamed of.
I enjoyed the movie but would caution you that it is not likely to be taken as a serious biography of this legendary film star.",1010966400,2,1597,4.7328519855595665
474614,5,6302503515,"Lon Chaney made over 150 films from 1913 - 1930.  99.9% of them were silent.  He died in 1930 before he could play Universal's ""Dracula"".  Can you imagine that.  Instead we had Bela Lugosi get the role and will always be remembered as The Count Dracula.
""Man of a Thousands Faces"" is about this remarkable man who was born of deaf parents.  From them he learned sign and the unique ability to communicate with great panomimic skills (visual effects for the silent screen).
Summary;  This is the life of Lon Chaney (James Cagney) and his Silent Screen genius at work.  This movie is considered to be one of the best screen-bios ever produced.  Cagney does an amazing job portraying Chaney from using sign, to dance (Cagney won an Oscar in 1940 (Yankee Doodle Dandy) about song and dance man George M. Cohen), acting, master of disguise and his remarkabe contortionistic skills. This films covers his silent film career and his private life.  A very enlightening and emotion journey with the ""Man of a Thousand Faces"".  (NOTE - His only son Lon Chaney Jr. became Universal Pictures famous ""Wolfman"" (1940)).
Chaney was such a Master of Disguise the general public hardly recognized him when ventured out amongst them.
See Lon Chaney is his most famous silent horror classic role as the ""Phantom of the Opera"" - 1925/1929.  (Read my review).  Now on remastered DVD.
Good Dvd quality picture and shown in Widescreen (Letterbox) format.  This a great film about a great Hollywood talent.",1007078400,10,1482,4.833333333333333
474615,5,6302503515,"Jim Cagney shows all his talents in this well-made bio pic. As Lon Chaney on Vaudeville in his early years, he stages two wonderful dance numbers as a clown -- one dancing with a mannequin, the next a competition with a  dancing shadow.
His sense of pantomime and command of sign language is  wonderful (Chaney being born to deaf parents), and his performance of the  tragedy-stricken Chaney is a real tear jerker.
Especially to be seen is  the recreation of Chaney's film ""The Miracle Worker."" A scene  shows Chaney portraying a cripple whose twisted limbs magically unfurl in a  traveling scam show.
Dorothy Malone kicks bootie as the insensitive wife  and incapable mother who doesn't want to bear Chaney's child because  Chaney's parents are deaf and so genetically inferior in her eyes. Chaney  had been made fun of all his life due to his parents' deafness, and it's  wrenching to see his wife's betrayal. At one point she screams to Chaney,  ""I don't want to give birth to a dumb thing!"" Cagney's pained  reaction is amazing.
Cagney's portrayal of a dedicated father to his son  is gripping as well. The wife is hateful to the newborn until she learns  that he can hear. (Cagney in a great scene hesitates to clap his hands  above the baby's crib to see if the noise will register.) The wife rejoices  and sweeps the baby from the crib -- her love obviously is conditional. But  Cagney subtley wrests the baby from her and coos to the squalling infant  that ""No one will scare you again."" He turns a cold shoulder to  her and effectively muscles her out of the relationship in one move. The  course of their marriage is set by her previous attitudes and his inability  to forgive her.  The drama continues.
This film makes one want to see  Chaney's silent flicks. It's a good catalyst to jump back into the silent  era.
Cagney and rest of cast are magnificent!",944524800,10,1867,4.63914373088685

474724,1,6302503515,"This is a wasted opportunity. As others have pointed out Chaney's life, particularly his upbringing, was fascinating and clearly played a very significant role in the development of his craft years later in films. It would probably make a good film. This isn't that film.

Instead, its a banal, sanitised, bog standard Hollywood biopic at its worst (a similarly misguided Keaton biopic from the same era looks like Citizen Kane compared to this!). The direction aspires to being pedestrian - when it aspires to anything at all. 1950s TV sit-coms had more imaginative direction than this film. When an onstage suicide attempt plays with all the drama associated to watching a weather report you know things are going very very wrong. You get the strong impression that no one, with the possible exception of Cagney (and I'm not even sure about him), had any interest in being involved in this film at all. And even Cagney isn't really particularly good (certainly not as good as the character he's playing; compare the original Chaney scenes with their pitiful recreations here). Oddly enough, according to this film, Chaney's main theatrical skill/interest was tap dancing! Of course, and purely coincidentally, those scenes are the only times in the film Cagney looks vaguely interested in what he's doing. So we get a lot of them....

There's an interesting story in there somewhere, but any hint of it is almost instantly smothered and replaced by cliche and platitudes. (I wonder what Lon Chaney Jr thought of it?)

A disappointing, extremely dull movie of no depth or interest whatsoever. Chaney fans will learn nothing, and fans of 'classic Hollywood' movie-making will be wasting their time.

P.S. The only small moments of interest are distractions - a brief cameo from Snub Pollard, and women's costumes and stylings that appear to be uncertain as to whether they should be correct period or (1950s) contemporary. Which is probably indicative of how much care anyone involved had in this program filler.",1443139200,,2012,5.069486404833837

Ironically this bio-pic was filmed by the studio in which Lon Chaney (Sr.) scored his most iconic hits---and the studio which he liked the least.  James Cagney successfully captures the enigmatic, private, brooding figure that was Lon Chaney (Sr.) .  It plays a bit fast -and - loose with the facts---but then, Lon Chaney(Sr.) would have it no other way.  In reality, Lon Chaney (Sr.) was an extremely-private man who shunned interviews.

474819,5,6302503515,"Ok, so I don't always devote a review to an Ammy friend.  I think I've done this three times in my well over 2,000 reviews.  But every once in a while, I come across a gem of a film that I truly feel NEEDS TO BE SEEN by a particular person.  Reviewing on Amazon and following other reviewers, you get to know their taste and their interest and sometimes you feel compelled to let them know about something you really think they'll wholly enjoy.

So, Mr. Know It All, my Ammy twin; this is for you.

Lon Chaney, the man of a thousand faces, is largely considered one of the most influential of all Hollywood giants.  He was never your typical leading man, but his range was undeniable and he left behind him a beautiful legacy of rapturous performances in some of the greatest films ever made.  Before motion pictures recorded sound, Chaney gave depth to silent films and became a staple in some of the more important films of their time.  Whether you know him by name only or have had the privilege of watching his more profound performances (I highly recommend `The Phantom of the Opera' and `The Hunchback of Notre Dame'), you at least know who he is.  What can be said about Chaney can probably be said for James Cagney as well.  Cagney is, in my eyes, one of the greatest actors who ever lived.  Sadly, Cagney is often taken for granted.  He is considered one-note and mostly remembered for his tough guy act and those gangster movies he made in the 30's.  Many don't think of the more tender and layered performances he gave throughout his career.  That isn't to say that his gangster films and the performances he gave within them were weak (he's been marvelous many times) but one should never write him off as one-trick.

He proves his range in this marvelous biopic where he channels all his charm, charisma and depth of emotion as the mysterious Lon Chaney.

Now, I don't know how much of this is accurate, but the synopsis does say that it is a loose biography, and we all know how Hollywood likes to exaggerate things for maximum effect, but regardless, `Man of a Thousand Faces' is outstanding.  Telling Chaney's story from birth to death is quite a task, because biopics that lack focus on a particular time or event in a person's life can feel stuffy and even pretentious.  Instead, `Man of a Thousand Faces' manages to flow with ease and tell just enough to keep us glued to Lon's life.  From his early childhood, growing up with deaf and dumb parents, to his early career juggling his vaudeville act with home life (ever so complicated by a resentful wife and a young son) and then moving on to his fame as a big Hollywood player, Chaney's life was never dull.

Thanks to sharp direction, beautiful cinematography, a heart-tugging score, a smart script and some very impressive performances (Cagney, Malone, Greer and Lovsky should have all been in contention for Oscars), this is a breathtaking look at one of the most memorable faces in cinema...all one thousand of them.",1339027200,2,2990,4.584586466165414
474820,4,6302503515,"James Cagney delivers a strong performance in this intermittently-accurate screen biography of Lon Chaney Sr. - the MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES.  Universal released the film in 1957 as part of their Silver Jubilee celebration.  Chaney had been one of Universal's greatest silent stars, earning fame for his unforgettable gallery of characters - everything from the tormented Quasimodo of ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", to the terrifying ""Phantom of the Opera"" - yet his private life contained more drama than any of his film roles.

Born to deaf-mute parents (Nolan Leary and Celia Lovsky), Lon Chaney grows up with exceptional skills in the art of pantomime and performance.  Soon landing a job with the successful Kolb and Dill vaudeville show, Lon marries singer Cleva (Dorothy Malone), but keeps his parents' affliction a secret from his bride.  When Lon brings Cleva home to meet the family over Christmas, her disgust is readily apparent.  Fearing that their eventual baby will inherit the family's deafness, Cleva spirals into paranoia, creating a rift in their marriage and driving Lon to despair.  Little Creighton (soon to be Lon Jr.) is born healthy, yet Cleva can't be satisfied.  Suspecting that Lon is carrying on with Hazel (Jane Greer), one of the showgirls from the vaudeville show, Cleva takes off with ambitions to become a nightclub singer, a career which Lon soon crushes.  After swallowing a bottle of acid during Lon's act onstage, Cleva's showbiz dream comes to a crashing end, Creighton is removed into state custody; and Lon moves to Los Angeles, where he'll launch his incredible film career...

Whilst it glosses over many facts from Chaney's life, MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES still presents a reasonable fascimile of the personal demons that shaped and molded one of the cinema's greatest silent stars.  As it had also done in ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", James Cagney's early musical training came in good stead in his performance as Chaney.  His clowning and pantomiming in the early vaudeville scenes is truly something to see; however the later recreations from ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" and especially ""Phantom of the Opera"" border on cartoonish.

Riding high on the success of her Academy Award-winning role as the outrageous nympho Marylee in ""Written on the Wind"", Dorothy Malone supplies the story's early histrionics as Cleva, Chaney's troubled first wife.  Knashing her teeth and looking stunning in Bill Thomas's costumes, Malone's performance is truly amongst her best.  On the flipside, Jane Greer quietly underplays her role of Hazel, the woman who gives Lon and his son their first stable home.  Greer's career is known primarily for her incredible gallery of noir heroines (in such films as ""Out of the Past"", and my personal favourite, ""The Big Steal"").  MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES isn't one of her better films, but she gives out a lovely, warm glow as the antithesis to Malone's scene-chewing hijinks.

Fans of Chaney will instantly know where fact leaves off and fiction begins, but MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES is still an entertaining and dramatic remembrance of one of the most influential figures of the early cinema.",1302825600,3,3149,5.081553398058253
474821,5,6302503515,James Cagney did a remarkable job in capturing Lon's early life and everything that made him one of the great silent film actors!,1292284800,,129,4.6521739130434785

474823,4,6302503515,"MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES is ostensibly a bio about famed horror actor Lon Chaney, but it delivers more about the acting dedication of James Cagney to his craft. The film is impossibly melodramatic & even corny. So why the 4 stars? I love it anyway!

At the center of the story is Lon Chaney (of course) whose parents were both deaf & mute. He grew up feeling not shame, but a whole lot of anger & pain, mostly inflicted by ignorant outsiders. So what does he do? He marries a woman who has a phobia about ""abnormalities"" & who spends her entire pregnancy completely wigged out that her baby will be born deaf. Dorothy Malone plays the wife. A B-List actress, Malone at least plays a self-destructive character which seems to have been her main acting schtick, so she's not too bad.

The other actors are less than stellar as well, but James Cagney trumps them all. He conveys what must have been true about Chaney, that he was absolutely driven by both talent & inner demons. I've seen Chaney in the silent version of THE UNHOLY 3 and the ""talking"" version as well. His presence is powerful, but you can see a lot of pain in his face. Despite all its flaws, thanks to Cagney, MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES conveys the power and the pain.

NOTE: According to the film Chaney was diagnosed with throat cancer during the making of THE UNHOLY 3 & was rendered unable to speak before he died. A very sad & uncanny irony.",1290470400,3,1408,4.3869731800766285

474845,4,6302503515,"As Cagney films go, it's great. As a Chaney biopic, it's good. I'm not entirely comfortable with the casting of Cagney as Chaney (the raw power of Chaney's make-up is lost) but given the time it was made there's no one else I could think of that could have  portrayed him any better. The problem lies in the depiction of Chaney's wife, Cleva. Lon and Cleva's heated disagreements did eventually lead to divorce but I've looked through bio material and found nothing that reveals her as self-centered, callous, and prejudice against Lon's deaf mute parents. There is little doubt of her mental stability, attempting public suicide, for example. Dorothy Malone does a fine job as Cleva but the question is in the production itself. It's unusual to see a slick piece of cinema portray a real life character with such a lack of empathy. Later in the film her character is redeemed a bit but she still comes out as the bad guy. As I stated earlier, this is one film that really needs a good commentary track but the disc is sadly lacking extras. A Chaney Scholar and a member of the family  (great grandson Ron Chaney for example) would have been ideal. The quality of the print is excellent though. The film pretty much sticks to the facts but a less dramatized account of Chaney's career can be found in TCM's ""Lon Chaney: A Thousand Faces"", a document included in the film set ""TCM Archives: The Lon Chaney Collection"". It would be interesting to know what Lon Chaney Jr. thought of this film.

One final thought: A glaring omission stands out. There is no mention of Chaney's collaboration with director Todd Browning, the man behind some of Chaney most memorable and lasting performances. This dynamic duo may have been the first of its kind and echoed in the seventies with partnerships such as Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese.",1273363200,4,1831,4.697819314641745

474847,5,6302503515,"Man Of A Thousand Faces tells the story of the life and times of Lon Chaney, one of the greatest actors of the silent movie era and one of the very few major silent screen stars to ever make a ""talkie"" as well. The acting is very convincing; and Jimmy Cagney got the opportunity to dance and portray a person who wasn't a gangster for a change! This film also showcases a tour de force by Jimmy Cagney who was truly at the top of his game. The cinematography is excellent and I like the way they organized the crowd scenes for the movie takes.

When the action starts, we see young Lon Chaney (Jimmy Cagney) quitting a vaudeville style show after his overemotional, unstable and even selfish wife Cleva Creighton Chaney (Dorothy Malone) was late for the third time in just one week. Lon quits to show his support for Cleva who then announces to him that she's expecting a baby. At first Lon and Cleva are happy; but trouble starts in quickly. When Lon takes Cleva home to meet his parents at Christmastime, Cleva overreacts--to say the least. Cleva is mortified that Lon's parents are deaf and she's terrified that her unborn child will be deaf, too. She's against having the baby but she goes through with it; and for a while tensions between Lon and Cleva ease after they know that their son can hear normally.

But happiness is elusive. Cleva resents staying home with her son out in the country where Lon could enjoy the peace and quiet; she wants the city life and she has her own desires about stardom. After a few years she decides to take a job as a singer--and Lon begins to notice that she's spending some time with other men, too. Lon wants Cleva home but Cleva wants out--and after a horrible and very public attempt at suicide, Lon and Cleva move to California for a fresh start. Unfortunately, their marriage ends in divorce anyway. Lon wants custody of his son but the court mandates that Lon Chaney, Jr. be placed in a foster home until Lon can prove he has a stable home with gainful employment. Meanwhile, Lon begins to reestablish a friendship with a chorus girl named Hazel Bennett (Jane Greer).

You guessed it! Lon and Hazel marry; they get custody of Lon's son and Lon takes off big time in the movie industry after working like a dog as an extra. Bigger and bigger pictures come his way including projects that were created specifically with Lon Cheney in mind.

Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere--and being that this is a Hollywood biopic, what we get in the way of the story line isn't always truthful, regrettably. Will Lon Chaney, Jr. ever connect with his mother Cleva again? Will he stay with his father or his mother if he does find his mom? What about Lon's marriage to Hazel--how do things work out and what are their issues? Watch and find out!

The DVD comes without extras; that disappoints me but the movie is so well done that I can overlook it.

I highly recommend this for film buffs and especially for people who enjoy silent horror flicks. Of course, people who like biopics and Lon Chaney films will consider this a ""must-have"" for their collections.",1236988800,,3105,4.52584670231729

A man answered the door and went inside to tell the woman her son was at the door.  Chaney overheard her telling the man to let her son know she wasn't home as a means of getting rid of him.  The hurt stayed with Chaney for the rest of his life and since Chaney was still alive when the picture was made, none of that could be included in the film.

474888,5,6302503515,"Cagney plays Lon Chaney in this film about the great imitator's life. Chaney himself was a very private person, prefering the quiet of hearth and home to the wild Hollywood night life. Hollywood was where he worked, not a way of life. In this way both he and the man who plays him (James Cagney) have much in common.

Cagney and Chaney looked totally different, yet Cagney makes this role work. In Cagney's biography ""Cagney on Cagney"", he admits that the story takes certain liberties with Chaney's life as most biopics do, but there are many actual events in Chaney's life that are in the movie. Chaney was indeed the child of two deaf mute parents - he got his gift for pantomime in communicating with them. His first marriage was a rocky one, just as the film portrays. Whether the trouble started over his first wife believing that their child would be deaf and being horrified by the possibility as is portrayed in the film I don't know, but given early 20th century attitudes toward disability it is entirely possible.

The film whether accurate or not, was a loving tribute to Chaney that was instrumental in a revival of interest in his films. I consider this to be possibly Cagney's best performance in a mature role with maybe the exception of 1956's ""These Wilder Years"", also not on DVD, or VHS for that matter.

If this was his only asset he would still be remembered today but, Mr. Chaney was also an incredible make-up artist and designed some of the greatest make-ups that are still unsurpassed to this day. His imagination and ingenuity were remarkable and I'm sure my favorite make-up artist Jack Pierce was in awe of this fellow artist.

This film starring James Cagney is very good, but it centers too much on Chaney's private life and no where near enough time on the man's talent as an actor and make-up atrist.
