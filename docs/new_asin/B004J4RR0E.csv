4390539,3,B004J4RR0E,"This movie reminded me a bit of Scream and Carrie...and a mixed bag of other teen-party-gone-enormously-wrong films. This low budget movie has everything in it, from the social outcast and popular kids, to naked girls and a creepy house holding them hostage. At the center of all the screaming and mayhem is the strained romance between two of the characters. I really would have liked to have seen more of this. Maybe there will be an Almost Invisible 2. Throughout the movie you wonder what the heck happens to some of these kids. Are they dead, alive, hiding, or what? It all makes sense in the end. There was enough gore and plot twists to keep me well entertained.",1314489600,6,669,4.630252100840337
4390540,4,B004J4RR0E,"A couple of nifty aspects to this film sets it above the standard teens-get-slaughtered horror fare: the abundance of female nudity (and bikini-wear) and the special effects.  And in fact, the film opts more for surrealism than gore, which is a nice change.  The story has a bunch of young people gathering at a house for an end-of-summer bash.  One by one they fall victim to bizarre hallucinations, then actual violence.  Is the house haunted or is the weird goth hostess messing with their (admittedly puny) minds using her super goth-powers in revenge for their juvenile cruelty?  I'm not telling, but the answer's a solid double, if not a home-run.  Along the way, some very seriously scary and creepy stuff happens.  Favorite line: ""Sex is everything.""  Second favorite line: ""This party's getting a little out of hand.""  Third favorite line: ""Dude, there's some crazy s--- going on in here.""",1313884800,6,898,4.973154362416107
4390541,4,B004J4RR0E,I loved the concept!! I am a sucker for good gory thriller's and I would definitely recommend this one.  It was a lot of fun!!,1307145600,,126,4.04
4390542,3,B004J4RR0E,"This film is kind of scary !
You might try to write it off as a direct to dvd release with no budget,But WAIT .
So its a wild party at `the girl who nobody likes' house.
There is alot of pretty people doing bad things and the haunted house may take exception to their subversive ways.
Effects seem to be all computer originated,But very welcome sights.",1303689600,,352,4.268656716417911
4390543,4,B004J4RR0E,"I thought this film was a great addition to my library, being a collector of slasher films, This was great and a must for my collection, i wanna watch it again loved it.",1303171200,,169,4.151515151515151
8431629,1,B004J4RR0E,Really? This movie was totally lame and made absolutely no sense. Someone had really bad hallucinogenic trip when they made this movie.,1524700800,,135,5.181818181818182
8431630,1,B004J4RR0E,"Someone who thinks he/she can act/direct has a rich daddy/mommy or sugar daddy/sugar mama. Then he/she read one book, the first book he/she ever read, and watched ten minutes of a Fellini film whilst stoned and went to Best Buy and purchased My Lil Filmmakers Action Starter Kit. I can report that not much money was spent on writers or actors",1523750400,,343,4.639344262295082
8431631,5,B004J4RR0E,totally trippy and psychedelic ... with totally hot chicks ... and lots of blood ... i loved it! :),1522368000,,99,4.2631578947368425
8431632,1,B004J4RR0E,"Oh no we ran out of money, who can we get rid of to save money and still make this movie? The editor. Don't need 'em.",1522195200,,117,3.5384615384615383
8431633,1,B004J4RR0E,"I'd give this no stars if I could and that's saying something. The story is so disjointed it's near impossible to follow. Booze and bikinis and only one dude passes out. I didn't count the number of dancing & drinking scenes but it seemed excessive.

The premise was promising; the implementation not so much.

And it is sooooo looooong!",1521244800,,337,4.694915254237288
8431634,1,B004J4RR0E,"Um...  yeah...  I normally award bonus points for indie / low budget, but I can't on this one...  So bunch of friends throw a party at a goth girls house and ""spooky"" stuff starts to happen...

The good - I actually liked the soundtrack...  some of those songs were pretty good

The bad - just about everything else
Acting - ummm, were they acting?
Camera work - I'm pretty sure this was the camera guys first try at anything...  This goes for the editor too...  Pretty sure they went out the day of filming and got a camera and some software and made the movie to try to figure out how everything works...
Audio - Bad...  just bad...
Special Effects - looked like the FX I used making a short film back in high school in like 1994...
I'm gonna stop...  no point in beating this up any more...

If I really had to guess...  I think these guys actually did throw a party and everyone did get wasted...  and someone filmed the whole thing and they decided to turn it into a ""horror"" movie through some really bad editing work...

Seriously...  just pass on this one...  how I sat through the whole thing is beyond me...",1520294400,,1117,4.323671497584541
8431635,1,B004J4RR0E,"In many low budget films like this you can not expect much.  You hope for a decent story, decent acting or just something entertaining.  You will get none of that here.  Bland characters that you can not tell apart, nonsensical plot, terrible audio, terrible acting and to make it all worse some of the worse editing I have ever seen in a film.  Just people talking at a table had so many jump cuts, some clearly from other locations, that it was impossible to even follow what was going on.  The film is basically unwatchable.",1519171200,,527,4.505263157894737
8431636,1,B004J4RR0E,"I'm not prone to superlatives--check my other reviews  if you doubt it--but this is the worst move that I've ever seen, and I feel ripped off by other reviewers who have suggested that it even is watchable, much less a positive entertainment experience.

I watched an hour of it in standard time before I simply had had enough and started fast forwarding. Anybody who watches this thing start to finish without doing that deserves a freaking medal. The script must have been written by an 11th-grade emo girl. I never actually even figured out the storyline; I felt no more recognition for the characters, setting, plot or themes by the end that I had before I put this piece of crap into the DVD player.

Therefore it would be pretty pointless for me to summarize this movie; best I can tell it's got something to do with an emaciated goth girl and her (actually very upper-middle-class) house, and a party, and a lot of weird stuff, and that's about all that I can tell you. Oh, I also can tell you that there isn't nearly as much nudity in this as some would have you believe. In fact there are only two true nude scenes and even one of them is ruined with FX and dumb cropping.

That's a natural lead-in for the criticism of this movie's production values. The audio is as bad  as anything I've ever experienced in a newly-produced film. The whole thing had to have been shot with one on-board microphone; part of the reason why I never could figure out what was going on is because I couldn't HEAR THE LINES. And the director must  have gotten a Johnny Editor Do-It-Yourself Home Kit for Christmas that year or something--there was so many nonsense technical effects like  running scenes in reverse, or in slow-motion, or making the characters simply instantly not be there in one scene then reappear later in another part of the frame. Even had the audio been of significant volume, it was so muddled up with garbage like reverb and other stupid effects that I  doubt that anybody could interpret it correctly anyway; to top it off, the score blasts you away with death metal. What a wonderful experience.

I'm not sure what else I need to say to keep you away from this one. I'll never be fooled by this production company again.",1389052800,2,2236,4.556109725685785
8431637,5,B004J4RR0E,"Teen hijinx gone terribly wrong...a house party gets very entertaining when the house itself turns on the (often naked) teens. Lots of gore, lots of screams.  The stuff dreams are made of.",1370390400,2,188,4.875
8431638,4,B004J4RR0E,"Naked chicks, blood, gore, an evil house, a house party...all the elements of a horror classic are in this film.  This is sure to become a cult classic.  It has re-watch value, too...I could watch it over again, and again...it's just a fun ride.  Get your friends, some popcorn, turn out the lights, and revel in the horror of a teenage house party.",1368316800,,349,4.507936507936508
