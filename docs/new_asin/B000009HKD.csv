It's more of a film about what happens to girls  when they hang with the wrong crowd. Pimps, for instance. Girl Gang is a  Category III film (that means R rated)with a fair amount of nudity &  sex, cute women, simple plot, really annoying bad/tough guys and that's  about it. If you love B-movies, especially Hong Kong B-movies (like I do)  then give this one a try. However, if you don't then you better stay away  from this one.",963619200,,601,4.36936936936937
