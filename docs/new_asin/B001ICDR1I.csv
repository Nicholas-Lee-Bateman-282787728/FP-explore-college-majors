This is a very well documented film. What could not be cleared up for the elections of 1988, about the ballots, in which the majority of Mexicans agree that a fraud was committed back then, and that it was obvious as for how things were handled; in this film there is a lot of evidence that ballots were altered while the President of Mexico for 2006 was still not declared or recognized as such; there are videos showing that ballot boxes were opened and seals broken while there was still a dispute as to whom was the victor of these elections: Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador or Felipe Caldern. The film also shows how Vicente Fox and company wanted to discredit Lpez Obrador's political image and obstruct his way to not let him run as a Presidential Candidate. They opted for video scandals in which the sole intention was to discredit Lpez Obrador, but they couldn't as Lpez Obrador was not implicated. Such videos, and what came after them when everything was clarified, just show, up to this day, how his adversaries wanted to do whatever possible to discredit him. However, another move was prepared, the ""Desafuero."" And even though, this one was a success for them, the purpose of this was not, as it was very obvious to the public that it was just a dirty political move by  Lpez Obrador's adversaries. Since social instability was possible, Fox and company had to pull back and let  Lpez Obrador run for presidency. But AMLO's adversaries didn't give up, they continued their war during the Presidential Campaign, discrediting  him through scam TV commercials, comparing him to Chavez and other dictators or communist leaders. And even though this type of publicity was  not permitted by Mexican laws, the IFE, which is the arbitrator on the elections, did not get involved or sanctioned such material. All of these statements are not my opinions, but facts very well documented in this film.  There are also opinions by reporters, critics, experts and common people, backed up by very trusted material.

The film should have added more material about how the largest media companies handled political information before, during, and after the Mexican elections of 2006, manipulating everything to their convenience to benefit Calderon and the political party PAN, as there are a lot of external videos showing this. Even after all the attempts to discredit Lpez Obrador, his adversaries did not convince the people to vote against him. After opening ballot boxes and altering results in favor of PAN's candidate Felipe Caldern, Caldern was declared victorious by a margin of 0.56%. Of the 130,000 ballot stations, only 42,000 were correct, the other 88,000 were evidently altered. That makes 68%, more than half, of the ballots to be changed in many ways, possibly and most probable, favoring Caldern. And only 32% to be correct, only 32% accrediting a 0.56% victory margin.

I don't share some of Lpez Obrador's ideas, and I believe that by declaring himself president in El Zcalo, was a type of a radical measure by Lpez Obrador. But when history repeats itself, and another fraud is made, such as the one, or even worst than that of 1988, and nothing happened to change all of these anomalies, it is understandable that Lpez Obrador decided for such moves and protests. And it is worth to say that his decision to never opt for violence, and to try to avoid it at all cause, is a worthy one.

I've been looking for the other side of the story. I've been looking for a book or a film that credits Caldern as the legitimate president or winner of the 2006 elections, but haven't found anything. Instead, on my way looking, I've only found more evidence that it was indeed a fraud the results of the Mexican Elections of 2006. Even the declarations of Caldern regarding his legitimacy sound as accrediting what is said in this film, and the declarations of different Mexican institutions do as well.

The film makes it very clear that all moves against Lpez Obrador were evidently orchestrated, and to my eyes they were orchestrated real brainless. And it makes them real brainless, because there is information that makes this evident, and with information is easier for people  to see what is going on around them. All these dull decisions, seen on the film, by top political leaders to discredit an opponent, just make provable the quote that says: ""Do you know my son with what little understanding the world is ruled.""

If all the fairy tales and rumors invented against Obrador were to be true, that Obrador was a threat to Democracy, because he was similar to Chavez (Although, I believe, Lpez Obrador's ideas are similar and closer to those of Lula Da Silva in matters of how to govern his country), in my opinion there was a worst blow to democracy in Mxico by declaring president a person who did not win the majority of the popular vote, declaring victorious a person who supposedly won with only 0.56% of advantage, but with all kinds of irregularities in 68% of the ballots. Declaring President a person that way is closer to a Communist or even an Authoritarian state, than to a Democratic one. Because the main purpose of Democracy is to respect the will of the people.",1338163200,,5195,4.792178770949721

8310772,5,B001ICDR1I,"What is so amazing about the film is how deftly it weaves a very serious topic, yet does not overly burden the watcher with the overly morbid feeling that might accompany an American version of the same thing. The sense of hope is palpable despite the sad reality of political corruption. The usage of personal interviews interspersed with footage from various sources is expertly done. Lus Mandoki is an excellent artist and I look forward to future films and documentaries that he will create.",1270684800,2,495,4.904761904761905
