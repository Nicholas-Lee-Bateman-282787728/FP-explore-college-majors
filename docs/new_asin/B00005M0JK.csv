7944857,4,B00005M0JK,"This third volume in Series 2 takes a step backward as far as sustaining my interest, but there are still plenty of good moments throughout the four episodes.  I am going to break down my review in to four parts, each concerning a specific episode.  My primary complaint here is that the through-story created during the first two volumes is completely ignored for the first three episodes of this part.  They seemed to be more concerned with attempts at parody and double-entendres than continuing the legacy.  These are the episodes:
2.9 791--The crew receives a distress signal and they go down to investigate.  The robot head, 790, tags along and they discover a cyborg with a missing head.  790 considers this the Holy Grail in his pursuit of bedding Xev, and while left alone attempts to connect himself to the hunky cyborg...with disastrous results.  The most disastrous being the cyborg's overriding desire to experience intimacy with Stanley Tweedle.  This episode, and all that it entails, has some disturbing moments.  Just wait for the final line of the teleplay and prepare to laugh heartily.
2.10 Wake the Dead--This is a failed attempt at a parody of Teen Slasher flicks.  While there are some campy moments courtesy of Michael McManus hamming it up, there is no real tension and the direction is extremely poor.  Some tighter editing may have helped, as well.  Overall, this was pretty boring.
2.11 Nook--This is easily my favorite episode on this particular DVD.  They discover a ""waterworld"" with a single continent home to a colony of men.  Only men.  The culture they possess is actually believable considering the Sci-fi behind it.  This is an interesting look at alien influence on a seeming Utopia.  Of course, Xev wants to stay and sleep with all of the inhabitants.  She even joins in the Summer Solstice Masquerade, dressing up as an alluring feline.  Meow!
2.12 Norb--The character of Norb, first introduced in episode 2.8 ""White Trash,"" makes an appearance.  But he is not what he seems.  This starting point leads to a fluid segue return to the story of Mantrid, and his diabolical need for destruction.  It was good to see the story get back in line here, although the seperate stories were entertaining at times.
This is some crazy stuff!",1084233600,,2269,4.900262467191601
7944858,4,B00005M0JK,"it took a while for the story arc to get going in season 2 but i guess that is cause they had to space it out over twenty eps. Any way it gets moving along here and is just fantastic. Even the stand alone eps are great as well. the most fun on tv ever.  it starts out with 791.  Not my favorite Lexx episode but it has its moments.  Then a classic.  Wake the DEAD.  One of the episodes where Kia goes completely bonkers and tries to kill every one.  He is absolutly convincing as a dead assasin who has recovered his memory and then reprogrammed by a meddling kid who told him to kill every one on the Lexx.  Then there is Nook.  The episode that Xev had been waiting for ever since she was transformed into a love slave with a personality.  She lost her verginity.  It is wacky and fun but also disterbing in a sexual way.  You'll see what I mean.  And finally we look at Norb.  The return of Norb, the little kid from White Trash, and the return of Mantrid.  This is the episode where all the eaten planets finally gets explaned.  The story arc is pushed full steam ahead here without any flaws.  We also learn something about 790 which makes his day more enjoyable than if he saw Stan get chopped in half by Kia's brace and fed to the Lexx.  Oh and by the way, has anyone else ever noticed that every person on the show has been killed at least once.  All the main characters have all died at least twice.  Just thought that I would point that out.  Hope you enjoy.",1024790400,2,1468,4.120141342756184
7944859,3,B00005M0JK,"You will just laugh like crazey when you see what happen to 790
in the episode 2.9 791 (i'd hat to spoil it)
Episode 2.10 ""Wake the Dead"" I love the way kai acts in this episode because it just really cool on how he looks.
Five teenagers are carousing around the universe when they decide it's time to take a nap. They oversleep by about 300 years. The Lexx comes across their shaggin' wagon and Xev can't help but go for a look. The teens are brought on board and, once roused, are determined to party. But jealousies and tempers flare and Kai is woken up in a most unpleasant fashion. What happens next is straight out of a slasher flick, as the dead man walking demonstrates why he was such a good assassin for His Shadow.
Episode 2.11 ""Nook"" This is another of my favorite LEXX shows because stan has some pretty bad luck you'll see if you getthe DVD.
The Lexx and its crew discover Nook, a planet covered by water with the exception of one island, which is inhabited by a religious order of men who haven't seen a woman in 100 years. They follow strict rules and roles: scribes, for example, are only ever allowed to copy dislocated passages from disparate books, ensuring that no one Brother ever learns too much. Kai, however, suspects there is something he can learn from the archives of this seemingly perfect society, and intends to find out all he can ... and Xev learns what she's been biologically designed for ...
Episode 2.12 ""Norb""
The strange young boy who appeared on the Lexx with the family of hillbillies is encountered again - this time floating through space. He is brought aboard the ship, and Kai observes he lacks ""a certain vitality"" - indeed, because Norb is no longer a little boy, but is composed of vicious drone arms - Mantrid's creations. These drones process everything they touch into more drone arms, and are impossible to contain.

7944860,5,B00005M0JK,"The long-awaited dvd releases of this season 2 series kicks into high gear with the release of #4, which includes one of my personal favorite episodes,""Wake the Dead"" and a journey into some space-kink with ""791"" and ""Nook"", and wraps it up nicely with ""Norb"", which showcases the arch-enemy Mantrid's return to the series for a climactic finish to the series down the line. ""Wake the Dead"" allows Michael McManus to release all that pent-up aggression suppressed by being dead and gives one of the funniest serial killer/slasher movie parodies in recent memory, and serves as his all-time favorite episode as well. ""791"" lets 'Lyekka',(man-eating plant person) and 790 to realize some suppressed desires, but not necessarily with each other.  Lyekka wants food,(people type food) and 790 wants Xev, and gets himself a body to prove it, with dire results. ""Nook"" serves as the episode where Xev finally gets what she wants, but the  price may be too high. The subplot with Stanley and the monk hilariously delves into the realm of innuendo in the form of bisexuality, again a welcome sideview of desires left unrealized. ""Norb"" sees the return of Mantrid and the youngster from ""White Trash"", both of which turn in excellent performances. The tension during the chase scenes with the drone arms were especially spine-tingling and left me with a distinct sense of dread for the coming episodes, which is exactly what they were supposed to do. All in all, a great combo, and the picture quality was far superior to the first two dvds previously  released, the interviews and extra goodies also were a delightful bonus..A must-have for the Lexx fan..",998265600,4,1647,4.9818181818181815
7944861,5,B00005M0JK,"Season 2 didn't hit its peak until the episodes on this disc.  While 791 is genuinely weird, I think it's a fun Alien spoof.  Wake the Dead is still thought of as one of the best episodes, featuring a deranged Kai.  Nook is a good stand-alone episode and benefits from an uncut version.  And Norb really introduces the nemesis of Season 2, Mantrid.  The video quality is better than the first two, with less grain and good color saturation.  The menus are also simplified, and continue to keep cool extra content.  Highly recommended for all you LEXX fans!",997056000,4,556,4.612244897959184
