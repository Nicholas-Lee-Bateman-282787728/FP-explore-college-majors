3070714,5,B0011Z5NK0,teaches basic massage techniques...good for learning..babies definitely love massage time..my now 5 month old has been enjoying this every day since the day he was born..recommend this to every one.. it is long..but i just do few basic moves with me every day..total time varying from 5 to 20 min depending on his mood and my mood.. we both love it,1354579200,2,348,4.721311475409836
3070715,5,B0011Z5NK0,"I started this DVD when my son was about a month old, and he loved it right from the start! It isn't a big commitment bc you don't need to give the baby a full body massage all in one sitting (and actually, they recommend against that bc it is too long). It is surprisingly easy to fit into the daily routine, even though I have a toddler at home to keep me busy too! For example, during a diaper change when you have spare time, you can give baby a leg and foot massage. Then a back massage before bed. I am very glad that I bought this DVD..and so is my baby!!!",1354320000,4,563,3.9473684210526314
3070716,5,B0011Z5NK0,"DVD was great!  Showed a lot of techniques for massaging baby.  Was very informative and showed different methods of massage as well as how to massage all of the different parts of the infant's body, even a technique for relieving gas.",1344902400,,235,4.7073170731707314
3070717,2,B0011Z5NK0,"This DVD is well done and nice to watch, but the massage technique is just too long and involved for they typical baby in my opinion. I bought it when my baby was just a few weeks old and she couldn't tolerate a 40 minute massage, nor do I have the time to give her a 40 minute massage every day. I was also a little but put off by all the oil they used on the babies in this DVD. Now my baby is three months and I just purchased Aimee's Babies Baby Massage DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aimee-s-Babies-Developmental-DVD-with-Baby-Massage/dp/B000MTFY0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aimee's Babies Developmental DVD with Baby Massage</a>and I really like it. The massage is exactly what I was looking for, very practical and simple. Aimee's Babies also includes baby stretches and other tips for reaching milestones that are really relevant to my three month old. I wish I had it when she was a newborn because it talks a lot about vision too. I got it on the Aimee's Babies site and it is a little cheeper. The Gaiam DVD is nice, but not at all practical.",1310947200,3,1102,4.962162162162162
3070718,5,B0011Z5NK0,"I am a first time mom with limited experience with babies. I also really believe in the benefit of massage for myself. So I thought this video would be a great idea and it was. This video gives great basics for massage, pressure points, stretching and gas/colic massage. My little guy had a lot of gas issues and we used various techniques shown in this video and it made a huge difference. The moves are easy to follow and can be tailored to fit your time and baby's likes. We use some of the techniques and not others depending on what he enjoys.

Although the video describes starting massage as soon as possible all the babies in the video are a little older. We started around week two and my baby would only let me message his legs for a short time. We just kept at it and now at four months he lets me message him all over like the video. Message has become part of our daily bedtime routine and he seems to really relax.",1308009600,9,928,4.242937853107344
3070719,5,B0011Z5NK0,"I can't wait to use the massage techniques demonstrated on this video.  As I watched it, I was amazed at how the babies just hung out and thoroughly enjoyed getting a massage, who wouldn't right?  It really impressed me at the importance of touch and massage, even as early as an infant.  What a gift we can give to our little ones physically and emotionally.  I just recently watched a video called ""Birth Without Violence"" and they had an Indian woman doing a lot of similar techniques with her son, something she had been taught by her mother who had been taught by her mother.  I can't help but think that these babies who recieve such hands on attention are more secure in there environment, feeling loved and treasured.",1270166400,8,725,4.589147286821706

8243107,5,B0011Z5NK0,As a massage therapist I bought that book as a gift for a friend and client to learn how to massage her baby. She likes it and told me it is a good book and helpful to learn the basics.,1478390400,,185,3.65
8243108,2,B0011Z5NK0,Compared to some other baby massage videos this one is pretty bland,1449619200,,67,4.666666666666667
8243109,2,B0011Z5NK0,"We found that these DVD's are too limiting and difficult to learn the first traditional communication and healthy, nurturing touch
for babies.  This ancient tradition, lost in many cultures today, is too important to take lightly.
Even if one has missed it with their parents, everyone can learn well and remember with hands-on instruction
beside us. The strength of our future generations depends on bringing this tradition back. Babies are smarter,
and healthier for the rest of their lives.  Too many misunderstandings with DVDs...I hear parents say it's a 40 min. massage
for a baby instead of 5 - 15 min, or baby is too young or doesn't like it at all or ""it's not for them"" or they don't continue to do
for their babies?  Nurturing touch is how baby's learn respect, trust and care for themselves and others...there is no other substitute for that
60% of learning that touch teaches, words are also too limiting and come along too late...
The future of our human beings is in our hands. Learn now please! Learn with someone who knows how.",1434931200,,1044,4.7569060773480665
8243110,5,B0011Z5NK0,"Love everything about this video. The instructor gives clear directions and is respectful. My 3 month old baby has colic, reflux, and a milk protein allergy and she was finally able to relax with this video,even put her to sleep! I've been giving her a massage once-twice a day last couple of days and I've noticed she is crying less and overall happier. The only part she doesn't care for is the chest massage, but that could be due to her reflux issues. I'll just skip that part next time. Also, I use organic virgin coconut oil for the massage. I normally don't write reviews, but I loved this video so much I had to.",1417996800,3,620,4.4
8243111,5,B0011Z5NK0,Bought as a gift. The baby mommy loves it.,1414108800,,42,3.7777777777777777
8243112,5,B0011Z5NK0,Easy to follow instructions. Great for an intro to massage. I used it several times a week and my baby loved it.,1401580800,,112,4.136363636363637
8243113,3,B0011Z5NK0,Video is long and very informative. They need a shorter massage demonstration so that I can copy their method quicker and easier.,1393718400,,129,4.909090909090909
8243114,5,B0011Z5NK0,"As a massage therapist, I give this video to my pregnant clients as a gift.  Searching through many and even returning some, I think this is one of the best.  It is very informative, easy to follow, enjoyable and 'esthetic' to watch.  It gives great bits of information about how to help your baby in soothing 'tummy' issues', or helping to relax the baby before sleep, increase circulation over all.  It is about 40mins, informative, but not overwhelming information for new parents.  And massage therapy is a wonderful way to increase trust and 'bonding' between baby and parent.",1376784000,5,581,4.887755102040816
8243115,5,B0011Z5NK0,"My son is too young to really enjoy the full body massage (he's two months) and actually hold himself up to allow me to give him the full massage... But -- I do the leg massage on him, and when he's fussy I do the colic one also. Seems to enjoy it, I mean, he never cries as I'm doing it :-)",1367020800,2,291,3.7096774193548385
8243116,5,B0011Z5NK0,"I bought this item because, we recently had our first baby and it was a good choice because it is really helpful specially at night when it is time to go to bed, massage relaxes the baby.",1357257600,,187,4.081081081081081
