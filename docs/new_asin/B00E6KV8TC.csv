5893498,4,B00E6KV8TC,"This documentary by Stephanie Argerich was made over a period of two years and also draws on earlier footage taken by Stephanie as a child growing up in unusual circumstances. Stephanie Argerich has clearly had an interest in videography since childhood and this documentary is intended to be a serious step on the way to establishing such film making as a career.

Martha Argerich herself came from a family where she did not attend any schooling. At home she described her mother as a distant figure emotionally. This educational situation is a feature that has applied to Stephanie and also to her older sister who described her own wish to go to school when growing up as her own form of rebellion.

Martha Argerich's first child was initially placed in an orphanage for eight months after which she was 'kidnapped' by Martha's mother and brought to Martha. Subsequently the child was taken back by the authorities and placed in foster care. Only at a much later stage did she become known to Stephanie and also to join the other two daughters. Men did not figure in any of this and Stephanie's own father, Stephen Kovacevich, although having an amicable relationship with Stephanie at present has still to recognise her officially on any paperwork. This failure to comply with Stephanie's desire reduces her to tears in the film. The film's title, 'Bloody Daughter' relates to Stephen's own description of Stephanie which he describes as a term of endearment.

Martha Argerich herself is asked various questions about her feelings throughout the film but does not actually answer any of them. Instead we hear comments along the lines of it being difficult to express such things and crucially, towards the end of the film, Martha describes her relationship with Stephanie as 'non verbal' preferring to just watch her daughter/s.

It becomes clear that Martha's only really true sustained relationship is the one with her music making where we see fleeting expressions of pleasure cross her face as she plays. Even there she expresses her dissatisfactions without ever being able to explain this in words. Every family relationship at any level has been compromised or sacrificed to this end. Human relationships are fragmentary at best and the lack of traditional education and social communications during growing up have probably contributed to the immense difficulties experienced between all of these people. The basically itinerant life of Marthas's profession has further exacerbated any development of communication and family relationships in any traditionally recognisable grouping.

What this film shows is a group of related people who live a severely compromised life that is fragmentary at best and which has resulted in crucially damaged inter-personal communication skills. The film also demonstrates as a side product, the musical talents of and over-riding musical demands upon, Martha Argerich herself. In a way, this is a film desperately looking for answers to broken or unmade relationships but finding no real answers upon which to improve the future.

The 'bonus' concert features a scintillating concert performance of Martha playing the Chopin first concerto in Warsaw plus a couple of short but exquisite encores. It will be this part of the disc that will be played most often and it contains a memorable document in its own right as to what all the previous and current social compromises have been devoted to.

The imaging is of a good standard and the soundtrack is clear although the DTS 5.1 option only applies to the documentary with the bonus concert being in stereo. This seems a strange situation as the concert would probably have benefited most from surround sound. The concert section was produced by Ideal Audience which seems wedded to stereo sound as experienced in other productions of theirs that I own.

I would suggest that this somewhat fragmentary documentary clearly illustrates a fragmentary group of related people, offering no answers sadly for Stephanie. It is unlikely to add or detract from Martha Argerich's enviable status as a musician and may not be a film much watched after the first viewing. The concert is another matter. It delivers an exceptionally satisfying concert performance with encores which will very likely be watched repeatedly despite the soundtrack playing only in stereo.

Ultimately this disc could be summarised as essentially a documentary searching for answers which are suggested by the 'bonus' feature.

5893501,5,B00E6KV8TC,"""Bloody Daughter"", the documentary film about pianist Martha Argerich made by her daughter, Stphanie Argerich, attains a goal most biographers would like to achieve. It reveals, most convincingly, the real person behind the legendary musician. Stphanie, given a video camera at a young age, photographed her mother almost obsessively: asleep, eating, practicing, fretting backstage, holding forth, whistling to the unborn grandchild, ear to the daughter's belly.

The biographical DVD comes with a second video: Martha playing Chopin's first piano concerto and two encores in Warsaw in 2010.

The documentary deserves a wider circulation than it has had. Besides being the only first-hand biography of one of the greatest pianists of our time, it is full of surprises, drama, contradictions, smiles and tears. ""Bloody Daughter"" is apparently what Stphanie's father, Stephen Kovacevich, called her, though he insists it is a term of affection. Kovacevich, despite the affectionate daughter's best efforts, does not come off particularly well in the film, refusing to perform, unable or unwilling to acknowledge his paternity.

Martha, on the other hand, despite being so clumsy with speech and clumsy, in fact, with almost everything except the piano, comes through as the most extraordinarily human you can imagine. As Stphanie says, ""I am the daughter of a goddess.""",1429228800,8,1367,5.5311004784688995

5893510,5,B00E6KV8TC,"Stphanie Argerichs  film Bloody Daughter is a sympathetic inquiry into her emotionally distant relationship with her parents, the celebrated pianists Stephen Kovacevich and Martha Argerich. Both artists are notoriously private, and their cooperation in this revealing film, which was shot over more than a year, is remarkable. Both might be said  to have intimacy issues; they never lived together; if I remember correctly Ms. Argerich says her father never lived with any of the several women who bore him children. Martha Argerichs relationships with the three men who fathered her daughters were likewise limited. Both Kovacevich and Martha Argerich  have lived foremost, but not always comfortably, with the demands of extraordinary talent. In scene after scene, Martha Argerich fends off questions about her lifeits bizarre, she says, or beyond explanation, or . . . her mouth twists and she shrugs. Yet the closing line, as she faces her daughters camera, is lovely and touching. This is as intimate a glimpse as Ive had of the inner lives of artists who simply cannot do other than what they do.",1401926400,7,1102,5.179775280898877
5893511,4,B00E6KV8TC,"BLOODY DAUGHTER
A film by Stphanie Argerich
(idaleaudience 2 DVDs distributed by EuroArts)

Some time ago I reviewed the DVD MARTHA ARGERICH: EVENING TALKS. A FILM BY GEORGE GASHOT made in 2002 and concluded: ""At the end I wanted to know more about this fascinating person I had just met, and I shall quickly move on to a documentary that Argerich's daughter made recently.  Bloody Daughter was released in 2013, and I can't wait to get my hands on it.""

Well, I finally got hold of this film and watched it a couple of times both with fascination and a sense of exasperation.  The film is made by Martha Argerich's younger daughter Stphanie, and is a mix of home movies, interviews with mother and father (pianist Stephen Kovacevich), performance clips, family photos, etc.  The fascination comes in seeing Argerich interacting with her extended family, former lovers and husbands, sensing her restlessness, her love of family, constant travel for concerts around the world, and also her moments of repose as well as her sense of fun.  She doesn't talk much about music and music making other than to mention those composers with whom she has the greatest affinity (Schumann and Chopin); her feeling about them is all in her playing, which has continued unabatedly brilliant for the 70 years she has been playing the piano, more than 60 of them before the public.  Yet for all these intimate glimpses, Argerich, for me remains elusive.  For all her candor with her daughters, there are closed areas, mysteries that she doesn't want to uncover (""I don't want to be defined"" she says at one point) or maybe can't.  She is so fascinating a person - we see her from vibrant teenager with a huge mane of black shoulder-length hair, a hairstyle that never changes but gradually becomes greyer and greyer as she moves into her sixties and early 70s.  Her face remains strong and beautiful and she carries herself with grace and purpose.  Her standard dress seems to be some shapeless black dress and informally she is a jeans and loose sweater person.  There is not an ounce of pretension or air of grand diva.  When she sits down to play she is all business, totally concentrating on the work, and you watch her face with its shifting emotions with a sense of admiration and awe, while your ears pick up her extraordinary pianism and musicality.  I think of that last word all the time as I listen to her playing, for phrase after phrase just sounds right, no matter what the work is.

The film is essentially Stphanie's journey to understand her mother (as well as her father, also a famous pianist, whose obsession is late Beethoven) and to come to grips with being the offspring of two unique, peripatetic musical geniuses who have or have had relationships together but who can't really live together.  We learn about Martha's first daughter Lyda Cheng who Stphanie did not see until Lyda was a teenager but who is now a part of the extended family.  We see the family as pretty close-knit even though they live in different countries.  But clearly they get together frequently and have fun as well as serious moments.

(There is one hilarious sequence in the film where Martha, daughters and assorted friends and family, are all dancing a wild Hassidic dance along with one shown on a large tv screen in the background.  The scene is from a marvelous and very funny French film from the 1970s, The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob.  This sequence tells you more about how the family interacts and plays than a thousand words could.)

All through the film are brief clips of her playing various works at different times in her career - very tantalizing as you want to hear more.  The musical payoff comes in the second DVD of the set, which is comprised of a complete performance of the Chopin Concerto No. 1 in e-minor at a concert in Warsaw in August 2010.  She plays to a packed house with the Sinfonia Warsovia Orchestra conducted by Jacek Kaspszyk, and her remarkable technical and musical powers are completely undiminished at the age of 69.  The performance is riveting and she actually looks pleased with what she has done - there is that slight smile of satisfaction to be seen.  Of course the audience goes berserk and starts that hypnotic rhythmic clapping that won't stop until the artist sits down to play two encores - a Chopin mazurka and Schumann's Traumeswirren.  The filming is excellent as is the sound and I continue to marvel as I watch such musical films how wonderful it is to live in this age when one can participate in a live musical event that happened far away and at a different time.  And also to get such intimate glimpses of Martha's personal and family life, but always realizing that there are layers of her personality that we are not privy to seeing and knowing about.  As she says, ""I don't want to be defined.""  That is her privilege and I respect that.  What an engrossing release!",1399420800,16,4916,4.694638694638694

5893514,5,B00E6KV8TC,"This is a 2 DVD set made up of a documentary about Martha Argerich (told from the perspective of daughter Stephanie Argerich), as well as a concert DVD filmed in Warsaw in 2010.  Stephanies father, pianist Stephan Kovacevich, is also featured in the film which Stephanie shot over two decades  there is lots of footage here from home movies, as well as tender exploration of the relationships that her mother has had and, to a degree, the nature of the travelling life of a gifted musician like Martha.  It is fascinating to see the interpersonal interactions, and how Martha lights up when she is in front of a keyboard.

One of the most interesting sections of the documentary involves Martha talking about the works of various composers and trying to put into words what they mean to her  but the words fail her from an emotional standpoint, and as she says, you just have to listen.  Particularly poignant is the portion of the film where Stephanie is trying to get her father to add his name to her birth certificate and he does not understand why this is so important to her and why this is worth all of the effort.  Stephanies sister Lyda is also present in the film, and their recollections of their mother are also captivating.

The concert, though, is delightful.  It features Chopin Piano Concert No. 1, as well as Mazurka Op. 24, No. 7, and Schumanns Traumeswirren Op. 12, No. 7.  This is virtuoso stuff, start to finish, and Martha brings to life all of the emotional content (both thoughtful, strident, and playful) that is there at the core of the music.  The combination of these two DVDs makes this set a winner for me.  Enjoyable, and very much recommended.",1388534400,11,1675,4.640677966101695

5893517,5,B00E6KV8TC,"This is an excellent documentary that offers a rare glimpse into the private life of an artist infamous for avoiding the spotlight - indeed, the ""Argerich mystique"" has probably helped make her extraordinary playing all the more intriguing. Listen to her recording of Prokofiev's 3rd Piano Concerto, or watch one of her performances; one can't help but seek to learn more about her. In this intimate documentary emerges a deeply private account that could have only been made by her daughter. It is a complicated story of a daughter seeking to learn more about a mother who is in some ways as mysterious to her own family as she is to her fans. We see Argerich - an invincible giant of the piano - at her most vulnerable moments: backstage, pacing nervously before a performance, outside her daughter's hospital room and in the privacy of her home. This film reveals what is likely true about all great artists: they are most happy, they are the most comfortable, when deeply immersed in their craft.",1386547200,21,1000,4.786127167630058

8602104,2,B00E6KV8TC,"Two stars because of the (mesmerizing) 2nd DVD, which shows Argerich in concert. The documentary itself (first DVD) seems to be, if I may be short and necessarily simplify things, a bit of video therapy for one of Argerich's daughters. I am very willing to believe that Argerich is a complicated mother figure (the movie is full of anecdotes about this, for instance when the daughter says that she would travel with her mother by train going to her mother's concerts in faraway towns when she was little, and Argerich would get off the train to smoke and come back on at the last minute, always worrying her young daughter her mother had been left behind; also, there is a moment toward the end when Argerich stares at the camera, meaning to stare at her daughter behind the camera, and says something that made me really ill at ease). So while I tend to side with the daughter, overall I think the movie would have been more powerful if it had been done by a third party with a bit more distance from the subject. But it was clearly difficult to grow up with Argerich as a mother and it is all to her three daughters' credit to have turned out as well as they did.",1448496000,5,1166,4.402777777777778
