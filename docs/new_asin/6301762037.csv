My Recommendation is to buy it only if you are a hardcore wrestling buff (like me) if you are looking for intense action, look elsewhere.",1377043200,,718,4.446969696969697

This is the most complete and accurate review of this VHS you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful. (Note-Each VHS I review has a ""Match of the VHS"" award somewhere in it.)

Hulk Hogan The Missing Matches
If a title for a movie could ever be more deceiving, I have yet to hear of it. Hulk Hogan The Missing Matches was supposed to show the world some little known Hogan matches. This however is not the case. You get clips of one Hogan match and two other matches not even featuring Hulk Hogan. This is Bait and Switch at its worst. Still, despite the crappy Bait and Switch, this has at least one good match. The video only runs thirty minutes, which is very disappointing. These matches are from random territories in the late 70s/early 80s.

Hulk Hogan w/Jimmy Hart VS Jerry Lawler
In my eyes, this is a dream match. These two were both territory leaders in the early 80s, and a battle between them would have been awesome. This is a horribly hacked up version of a match. The match originally went for around fourteen minutes; what you see is around two minutes. You never even see a clip longer then ten seconds before it clips again. I cannot give this one a rating.
RATING- No Rating

Nick Bockwinkle VS Manny Fernandez
This is a pretty average match. Nick Bockwinkle was a big star in AWA before it folded. Manny Fernandez dominates most of this match. The ending is good. It appears that Manny had won the match with a sleeper hold, but time had actually expired.
RATING- 6/10

Loser Leaves Town Match (Match of the VHS)
United States Heavyweight Championship
The Sheik VS Mark Lewin(c)
If you've never watched the Original Sheik fight, his style is very violent and barbaric for the time. Sheik controls most of the match by hitting Lewin with a spike. Lewin gets busted open early in the match and stays in the crowd for a bit to regain his bearings. The rest of the match sees Lewin getting beat down. Eventually, Lewin gains possession of the spike and rams it into Shiek's head. Both men are bleeding considerably. The ending comes when Sheik blasts a fireball into Lewin's face. I actually enjoyed this match a good bit.
