3101237,5,B00131VL7Q,"So often, filmmakers have tried to turn Austen's life into one of her novels, and only succeed in making a pale imitation of them. This film, on the other hand, is brilliant. It examines Jane Austen's life and choices in a way that both deepens our understanding of the author herself and her works. I don't mean to make the film sound dry or boring. It isn't. It is deeply moving. It's simply wonderful. And for a brief time it satisfies our desire to know the woman herself.",1502496000,5,476,4.420454545454546

8248737,5,B00131VL7Q,"This is a great movie, some of my favorite actors in it, the costumes are pretty close to being correct, and it was well done. Better than most. This was taken from her letters, which academics today think may be taken with a grain of salt. She was a very articulate woman with a sharp tongue and loved to make fun of the social mores of the time. She was ""ironic"". Much of what is in her letters is not necessarily the truth, but a parody of actual events in her life.
She died very young, at 41, of Addisons disease, a horrid way to die, so her last years were spent very ill.

If you really like this era there are many many books on the Georgian and Regency period, dictionaries, ect that will give you the right idea of what life was really like for these people.

This was a horrible time to live, esp for women and those of the lower classes. The lower classes lived in filth and disease, starved to death in the streets. Think of the country of India today...that was England during the Georgian and Regency period.

Women had zero rights, could not own property, could not hold money, they didn't even own the clothes on their backs! it all belonged to her husband or father or brother or uncle. The children belonged to their husbands and if the woman left an abusive marriage she was not allowed to take the children and she would end up on the street if the family didn't take her in. Rape of the wife was legal. No medicine, nothing for a toothache, nothing for a virus or bacterial infection. If you broke your leg you might well die. These movies romanticize these different time periods as do books. The British had a caste system, like India still has, with white and black slaves. The servants were born into service and had no way out. In Indian nowadays they are actually bought and paid for slaves.",1518220800,2,1819,4.359882005899705
8248738,4,B00131VL7Q,"I liked it as a whole. Good acting, but these period pieces  seem to be always so dark in appearance and  so are the scripts..
Hugh Bonneville has aged with grace. He always has a slight smile even in the sad parts. He is fun to watch. Greta  is doing well even after  all these years. Her acting is good. It was worth the watch..",1515456000,,330,4.030769230769231
8248739,4,B00131VL7Q,"A most delightful film. I believed they were the actual people in Jane Austen's life. Would've been better had it been a little longer and a little deeper. But all in all, totally worth it. I do so love films of this era. Life was less complicated and people made do. The costumes were brilliant. The scenery made me feel as if I were watching the actually happenings of Miss Austen's life and time period. Bravo for a film well done.",1509840000,3,434,4.37037037037037
8248740,5,B00131VL7Q,"So many reviews that were not reviews of the film, but of describing the disappointment with technical snafus that prohibited people from viewing it.  Hoping that those who want to see this will choose the streaming option for seeing it because it has great merit.  Jane Austin and her novels explained so well.  The plight of women who were poor in her era, and in Austin's case, the plight of a woman with immense talent and wit who was poor.",1504569600,5,444,4.525
8248741,5,B00131VL7Q,"Excellent period drama detailing the life of Jane Austen.  Acting, costumes, and cinematography are excellent. I'm a huge fan of all things Hugh Bonneville and I wasn't disappointed.",1502582400,3,182,5.5
