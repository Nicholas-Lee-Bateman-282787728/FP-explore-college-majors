2225875,3,B0007P0XJ6,"I hadn't exercised (other than walking) in years until recently when I started a weight loss program, so am definitely a ""beginner"".  The tape has 5 10-minute sessions on it, 3 of which are bellydancing, which sounds a lot easier than it actually is especially for someone who has a hard time concentrating on on their feet at the same time as other body parts.  Here's my take on each individual segment:

Parts 1 and 5 - MaDonna: these basic cardio workouts are definitely my favourites.  They are easy to follow, fun, and give your muscles a workout.  A beginner can do these and learn all the exercises pretty quickly.  For a 20 minute workout, do one after the other. Excellent.

Part 2 - Suhaila:  This is NOT NOT NOT for beginners unless you have bellydancing experience.  I felt this segment was more of a showcase for what Suhaila can do.  How many ""beginners"" can move each of their buttocks separately?!  Poor.

Part 3 - Jayna:  Sinous, slower movements - good for flexibility and toning.  More relaxing workout.  Good.

Part 4 - Rania:  This is mostly a chest workout, good for toning - she repeated the movements a number of times, but I find it very hard to move my feet while moving my chest.  This may improve with practice.  Fair.",1151712000,41,1247,4.5610859728506785
2225876,2,B0007P0XJ6,I purchased this DVD mainly for the Hip Hop sections.  I was very disappointed to find out there is no Hip Hop dancing on this DVD.  Madonna Grimes is the instructor for the Hip Hop section but it is basic aerobics and floor exercises.,1140220800,20,235,4.318181818181818
2225877,5,B0007P0XJ6,"I have both Madonna Grimes workouts DVD's and fell in love with her 10 minute workouts.  It was a great way to start my day, I was hoping that this tape included two new workouts alas they were the same, but with disapointment comes satisfaction.  The other 10 minute workouts give me a chance to change my early morning workouts, and learn a workout that I never thought that I would learn and enjoy doing.  Jayna's bellydance helps you to feel sexy and still enjoy the feeling you get from her low impact toning,  also great moves you can use for other reasons.  Rania's upper body is really fun, some of the steps are a little harder to do on carpet since you do this barefoot.  Suhaila workout I am intimidated by. I have not been able to watch it long enough to complete it.  I have a little trouble getting past the control that she has on her butt cheeks.  She can contract them one at a time.  Some mornings I get enough energy and do multiple workouts from this tape. They are really fun. This tape has a bonus YOGA, I had never tried YOGA and this gave me an opportunity to try it.

I highly recommeded this DVD/VHS. I love the 10 minute workouts.  With this DVD/VHS there are no excuses you can always find 10 minutes in a day.",1126224000,56,1238,4.2703862660944205
2225936,5,B0007P0XJ6,Delivery was prompt.  Merchandise was in great condition.,1288051200,,57,6.125
2225937,3,B0007P0XJ6,"Very fast shipping and good price; but the workouts are very intense! I have never done belly dancing before so it was really hard to keep up; they do a poor job of teaching you.  Unless you are good at belly dancing, I wouldn't suggest this workout dvd.",1269993600,,254,4.291666666666667
2225938,3,B0007P0XJ6,"I read the reviews extensively before I bought this, and basically they are right.  If you are into bellydance, I suppose this would be more fun.  The bellydance segments are strenuous.  The first time I watched the video I laughed my head off.  If I ever learned to do all those moves, it would be a miracle.  Not saying they are bad, just way beyond my interest level.  However, the redeeming quality of this video is MaDonna Grimes.  She is precious.  Her personality is totally endearing and her workouts (the first and last of the video, and the only two that aren't bellydancing) are good.  They only last 10 minutes, but you will work out your legs and get your heartrate up.  Basically it's just squats, but I have to say it works.  I can feel myself getting stronger every time I do them.  Her great personality prompted me to order another one of her videos - African Beat, Latin Heat.  It is so much fun.  I'm not sorry I bought this video, and I do use it, but, had I known what was on it, I probably wouldn't have bought it.  So, in conclusion, if you like bellydancing, go for it.",1262822400,,1094,4.346534653465347
2225939,4,B0007P0XJ6,thank you for your quick response.  item was received in great condition.  would buy again,1261785600,,90,4.933333333333334
2225940,1,B0007P0XJ6,"I had really looked forward to receiving this item - even with the delayed shipping - but was incredily diappointed with the product! The segments don't really seem to stand alone - it's as if they were cut and pasted from other videos. While MaDonna's segments were the best in terms of instruction, I really don't understand how they could call them Hip Hop workouts; it was just a series of squats, floorwork, etc. I had really gotten the DVD for the bellydance sections, thinking they would show me a few techniques that would help get me started and just plain get me moving. However, the segments by Suhaila and Raina are just jerky, unattractive and incredibly repetitive. Jayna's segment is much smoother with a nice flow, but there's absolutely no instruction. ""Do the camel."" Excuse me?? Watching this DVD has left me really UNinspired! Overall, I have to agree with other reviewers that this was a real rip-off. I would think the performers would be pretty embarrassed to be associated with this DVD!!",1256515200,2,1012,4.82183908045977
2225941,1,B0007P0XJ6,This video is terrible. It doesn't teach how to really move like they do you have to learn how to move that way on your own at the risk of looking rediculous!,1245801600,,158,3.96875
2225942,2,B0007P0XJ6,I think I should have researched this better. Too hard and not what I was looking for.,1245628800,,86,4.117647058823529
2225943,2,B0007P0XJ6,"I was so excited when I recieved this DVD but not too happy when I played it.  The workouts were far beyond my experience.  When I saw ""beginners,"" I expected it to go step by step and slowly.  I was not expected to jump right into the moves and expected to be able to move like that!  I was wondering was there a begining tape for the beginners?!?  I saw a bunch of women just moving to music at their own beat.  It was like, ""look at me and what I can do and you can't!""  If you are younger, then you probably can handle it.",1240099200,,526,3.9056603773584904
2225944,5,B0007P0XJ6,"I'm 52 & have been exercising for 30 years, but in the past 10 years I've found that certain exercises are now injuring me. These exercises are great! (Except for #2 - it's too difficult, so I skip it!) I do one a day & it's kept me in shape for the past few years. They are strenuous enough to be a good workout, but not so strenuous that I get hurt. I highly recommend this video for everyone!",1233100800,,395,4.012658227848101
2225945,1,B0007P0XJ6,I would not recommend this product to anyone.  The hip hop dance workouts were a joke.  It was just MaDonna Grimes repeating squats.  Last I heard dancing involved a little more than that.  I also perused through some of the belldance routines.  If you can do isolated buttocks sqeezes your good to go.  I'm not familiar with bellydance and did not find this to be very instructional for beginners.  The routines were boring.  I guess I'm not the best reviewer because I didn't watch the DVD all the way through.  I was enraged after the first 20 minutes and had to turn it off before I punched something.  WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!,1232841600,,639,4.526315789473684
2225966,4,B0007P0XJ6,Just leaves it in the DVD player and when she feels like a quick workout she plays it.  A great fun way to get a quick workout.,1231718400,2,127,3.7037037037037037
2225967,2,B0007P0XJ6,"If you want to move for 50 mins, then this is for you.  If you are looking for bellydance instruction of any sort - absolutely NOT.

The two MaDonna Grimes workouts are not hip hop, but do work your lower body and abs (in the 2nd of her workouts) quite well.

Suhaila - yes a totally amazing dancer but the individual glute squeezes?  C'mon, I've been bellydancing for 8 years and teaching for 3, and that is certainly not for beginners.

Jayna's segment is lovely but I do have a comment about the Jayna and Rania segments.  A beginner picking this dvd up and hoping it will give adequate bellydance instruction risks injury - movements like camels and chest isolations require a breakdown of the individual moves, not just ""do this"" - Rania's camels are ENORMOUS and I can imagine a few strained backs at the very least.  Thank the gods for a the disclaimer!

As I say, if you want 50 minutes of movement go for it, but please do not rely on this for bellydance instruction of any sort.",1230940800,2,988,4.419889502762431
2225968,5,B0007P0XJ6,This video will give you a sample of a few different kinds of dance for fitness.  I'm not a fan of hip-hop music so I wasn't too disappointed that the hip-hop section wasn't more dance oriented.  It was a decent cardio workout.  The belly dance sections were enough to show me that this might be something that I would like to learn more about.  I like Rania and Jayna and will look at their DVDs.,1223856000,,397,4.253333333333333
2225969,4,B0007P0XJ6,"This dvd is the best, I see an improvement already in movement and my shape.  It is easy to follow and quick to do, but you are really working your muscles and building a foundation... I recommend this belly dancing dvd to everyone",1174003200,2,231,4.372093023255814
2225970,4,B0007P0XJ6,"Love the format, you can do it all or pick & choose.  Some routines are more demanding than other, all are doable and lots of fun!",1173398400,4,130,4.0
2225971,1,B0007P0XJ6,"First of all, there is nothing ""hip-hop"" about the hip hop workouts.  There are two by the same woman and they are essentially the same.  There is no dancing and no dance moves incorporated into the boring routine which is done to a grating rhythm and not to hip hop music.  The other three workouts are all belly dancing.  I bought this for myself but was hoping I could use it in my junior high aerobics class.  It is so boring my students would not enjoy it and I certainly won't use it.  I've come up with more interesting routines on my own.  This was a total waste of money and a complete rip off.",1170374400,8,603,4.191304347826087
2225972,5,B0007P0XJ6,"Buy it, it's great and it'll take off the pounds and shape the body.  Plus it's loads of fun.",1168473600,4,93,3.8947368421052633
2225973,2,B0007P0XJ6,"I bought this because I thought it'd be great to have some 10-minute workouts, if I feel lazy, that'd be enough to get motivated. Unfortunately I wouldn't call these mini-workouts, but most likely they're scraps from other videos these ladies have done, or maybe they're even outtakes. I really don't know.

I hoped to get a bit of a dance on with MaDonna Grimes, but the first workout is just a lot of squats and

floor work, with Grimes going, 'Aaaaah! I know you're hurtin' now! Aaaah!."" Okay .... Her next workout is a bit more energetic, but it never really gets dancy, just a few back and forth steps, knees up a couple of times, and more floor work. I did, however, like the standing abs moves, working the obliques, but I still wanted to dance a bit. MaDonna, Natural Journeys: Didn't you have at least 5 minutes of boogie for me?

Suhaila is an awesome bellydancer, but so far her stuff with Natural Journeys has been a letdown. A lot of this is squatting and squeezing butt cheeks alternately, which if you're a butt freak, this is your workout to watch, but I didn't really enjoy it. Again, I'd have liked a few dance moves instead of squatting and squeezing, then standing and squeezing the butt cheeks while stepping to punctuate lower body movements. It's valid in bellydance, but it didn't make me want to do it again.

The Rania workout was more standing and tippy-toeing stuff, some moving the upper body, a bit of work on the abs and back, too, which wasn't bad, but I wasn't crazy about it.

My favorite was Jayna's bellydance workout, which had a bit of variety and the stretch felt good, and it felt sort of graceful and pretty to do, and I felt it in my shoulders and around my waist the next morning. It wasn't enough to break a sweat, but it felt feminine and fluid and I enjoyed it the most, and that's another 10 minutes I'll gladly go back to.

There's a bonus yoga workout too, which is pretty nice. I think Jayna does that one, too, and it's for the whole body and a nice series of stretches, too.

Not a horrible DVD, and the quality is good, but for 6 workouts, I'd really only want to do 2 of them again. I wish I could get two-thirds of my money back, but oh well. Next time, though, if it's marketed as dance fitness, how about making you feel like you're shaking it a bit for your money's worth?",1165881600,10,2330,4.3672055427251735
2225974,4,B0007P0XJ6,"These are all the bonus 10 min workouts from each of the mentioned DVDs. DVD has option of regular or letterbox screen & 2.0 or 5.1 dolby sound. Some workoutse may seem like they need more instruction because these are only bonus versions:

She has a great personality & a great dancer.

8049918,3,B0007P0XJ6,"This DVD consists of 6 ten-minute workouts (including the ""bonus"" yoga workout).  I love these 10-minute workouts because it's easier to squeeze in some exercise if you tell yourself ""well, just 10 minutes...""--that's what I did and I ended up doing the whole DVD.  None of the workouts on here are very dance-y and if you came here to learn some new moves, you will NOT learn any here unless you are an absolute beginner--and if you ARE a beginner, you will likely be lost through most of this DVD.  Overall, I am giving it 3.5 stars because if you do the whole DVD you will get a decent workout, (not a super-sweatfest, but I don't always want that anyway) the production quality was good, for ONCE the music wasn't glaringly awful--such a rarity in workout DVDs, and I really like the 10-minute format with a variety of instructors.

1st workout: MaDonna Grimes is an amazing physical specimen and if you do her workouts, you WILL get in shape, however I would have preferred some more variety of moves and not half the time spent on 9 million squat variations.  No dance moves really though, just aerobics.  2nd: Suhaila is a big name in the belly dance world, her mother is belly dance royalty, and she gave a good workout of mostly shimmies but again, beginners will be lost.  3rd: When Jayna Kouzouyan opens her piece by saying, ""Ready for a little sweat?  We'll begin by sliding our head side to side..."" I groaned because how many calories do head-slides burn?  Chewing a stick of gum probably burns more. Her moves are slow and beginner appropriate. 4th:  Rania is another name I know from the belly dance world, I have done another one of her DVDs in the past.  Her moves would be good as drills for a more-experienced belly dancer, but a beginner will NOT get a feel for belly dance from this.  Rania gets extra points though for doing the ONE dance move from this whole DVD I will take with me--chest figure 8's while lowering your body--not that I didn't know how to do those before, but it was a good reminder, ""oh yeah, I should incorporate some of those in my next routine...""  5th:  When the 2nd MaDonna Grimes piece came on I thought the DVD was just repeating--the moves and even her outfit seemed similar at first.  6th--Rainbow's bonus yoga workout made up for the lack of stretching in the rest of this DVD--a generic, standard yoga routine.

This is worth renting, but not buying.  I probably will check out some of MaDonna Grimes', Suhaila's, and Raina's other titles.",1341705600,,2493,4.578828828828829

The ten minute quickies start out with no warmup - very dangerous.  The hip hop seems like regular exercise and the belly dance is not good.  If you don't know how to bellydance it wouldn't help you and if you do, you would know to warm up first and would be better off just playing music and dancing your own steps for 10 minutes.",1339718400,,506,3.9215686274509802
