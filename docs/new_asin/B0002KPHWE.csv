2100029,3,B0002KPHWE,"I never thought Species was a great film back in 1995 but it was fun. Watching it for the first time in many years it hasn't aged all that well. The CGI looks even worst than I remember. The practical effects although not all that convincing still best the digital effects. The films cast are great despite the cheesy dialogue. You can't go wrong with acting talents such as Ben Kingsley, Forrest Whitaker, Alfred Molina and Michael Madsen. Marge Helgenburger is also a delight in her pre CSI role. Species is fun watch despite it's shortcoming it has plenty of thrills and action ... Recommended.",1500249600,,597,4.695238095238095

2100057,2,B0002KPHWE,"Revisited this cheese fest from 1995 (and just like that year's other bomb Virtuosity, it seems like it was shot in 1986) only to discover it was just as bad then as it is now. The only saving grace is the astounding Natasha Henstridge, who like Mathilda May in 1985's Lifeforce, parades around in the buff for half the film. The question I had back then still stands: why on Earth is Ben Kingsley is this slop? The Academy should had demanded his Oscar back for his performance in this. If you want to have a laugh at Gandhi toting a machine gun, Michael Madsen looking like he has a bad case of diarrhea and Forrest Whitaker babling nonsense along with Alfred Molena, this is the movie for you.  Still can't fathom the same director did ""No Way Out"", ""The Bounty"", ""Thirteen Days"" and ""Smash Palace"". Terrible film. Did I mention the naked chick?

2100070,2,B0002KPHWE,"A waste of Kingsley's talent.  Fair creature effects but the story line was weak.  Terrific early Alfred Molina showing his acting chops.  Unnecessary love interest that added diddly squat to the story line.  Predictable ending.  Why is it that horror films have to have an underground scary and dark segment? - so that crappy up close creature details can be hidden by poor camera angles, poor lighting, and FIRE.  It became a comedy when the alien/human composite ended up with absolutely hilarious breasts with even more hilarious nipples.  If you are a teenage boy the shots of Henstridge nude will give a few thrills.",1472515200,,622,4.923076923076923
2100071,4,B0002KPHWE,"Circa 1995 'scary' film. I enjoyed it. Reminds me of films I'd see at the drive-in with my buddies back in high school. You get to see Natasha Henstridge topless several times and her well-proportioned all natural form instantly makes any scene interesting. Hey, I'm just a dude, after all! I thought it interesting too that the little girl version of Sil at the beginning of the movie looks just like Kate Upton. Turns out this actress' name is Michelle Williams but the resemblance is profound. I also enjoyed seeing the likes of Ben Kingsley, Alfred Molina and Forest Whitaker from that long ago. Michael Madsen plays the exact same kind of guy he is in every film I've seen him in.",1472515200,,685,4.622950819672131

2100120,3,B0002KPHWE,Dated and a little hard to follow at times but it was entertaining and suspenseful enough that we watched it all the way through.  It was a bit formulaic for my tastes and the characters really did not get to make much use of the talents that got them picked for the job - so that was a bit strange.  The very last scene was dumb and did not match the explanations that stayed true through the rest of the show - it would have been just fine to end the movie without that last scene and it could have been a bit more believable and conceivable - but whoever threw that in there just ruined the whole story line.,1471392000,,611,4.083333333333333

2100147,5,B0002KPHWE,"I originally saw Species in the mid 90's when a teen and upon re-watching it today around twenty years later I was still entertained, although I did remember most of the key scenes outcomes as they began. But a memorable film isn't a bad thing. I think is interesting as a movie in that traditionally we'd be rooting for the protectors of life on earth (government agency) to capture or kill the threat (well it's pretty obvious Kingley's character is a kill just in case kind of guy). But because the threat starts off in the form of a young human girl, and we see her plead for her life as she's about to be gassed before escaping, we kind of don't want her to get captured. Then of course as she quickly transforms into an adult woman, she's (Natasha Henstridge) got the smoking hot factor going, which makes our minds sort of stick with the I hope she gets away angle, even though we are told through other characters that she is here to wipe out us weeds (humans) from this planet.

It's also an entertaining film, most of the victims are people who deserve to get their comeuppance from the way they treat what they think is a human woman. There are some innocents though as well. There are 90's haircuts and other aspects that remind you this isn't a modern day film but overall Species has more than stood the test of time. If you want a fun sci-fi alien threat film, you won't go wrong with Species. Most of the chasing her cast members have gone onto lengthy acting careers too, so you'll instantly recognise the faces of most of them.",1459382400,,1545,4.421052631578948

2100149,3,B0002KPHWE,"Man this one is hard to rate, so I'll settle in the middle with 3 stars. The cast is quite respectable, given the material: Ben Kingsley (a Sir, no less), Alfred Molina (162 acting credits so far in his career), Academy Award winner Forest Whitaker (a personal favorite), Marg Helgenberger (her haircut is sooo bad in this), Michael Madsen (what hasn't he been in? 247 acting credits), and of course, Natasha Henstridge as Sil the alienette.

The script, music, and general vibe are distinctly 1990s, but if you can get past that then there's some okay material underneath. Generally poor dialogue with flat humor, but somebody wasn't asleep at the wheel: attention to detail made the difference between a mediocre film and an unwatchable one. For example, the young Sil (who had no concept of human culture) in a 3-second scene of a man trying not to fall off a bucking bronc at a rodeo and her laughing about it (you often don't realize how ridiculous something is until you see it through the eyes of an alien), and her biting into a banana with the skin still on (matters because it tells us what looks like a little girl is not!) Also of note is how Sil learns about human culture through television commercials, which when you think about it is downright terrifying given her intent (and at once a serious indictment of our own species).

A few nice gory scenes if that's your thing (Sil's literal kiss of death was given to a worthy recipient), but I was in it for the sci-fi, which is unfortunately devoid of science other than a brief discussion of DNA base pairs. The whole searching for a mate trope seems like a stupid idea to build an alien movie around, but I can't be the only one who feels the writers were making some poignant statements about human dating culture through it. And let's not forget to mention the elephant in the room: Natasha Henstridge spends so much of the movie topless that it feels strange when she puts a shirt on.

 Blu-ray details 
I can't imagine the DVD would look much worse than the Species Blu-ray transfer, but apparently the top review for this item states the Blu-ray is ""much better."" Unless the price is nearly equivalent, though, I say don't buy the Blu-ray in hopes of superior visuals. Here's the Extras / Bonus Features:

Here you have action, suspense, some really scary moments and (pay attention, guys) nudity.  If you have never seen an alien naked, you'll want to see this one, believe me.

2100164,3,B0002KPHWE,"Roger Donaldson simply isn't a very good movie director.  Let's take the final sequence when the team pursues Sil into Los Angeles' sewer system.  For some strange reason Forest Whitaker's psychic abilities fail him for the first time after a good track record up to that point.  No explanation for this.  And for some strange reason Ben Kingsley has a snit fit and goes off chasing Sil, expecting Whitaker to follow him.  Whitaker acts like he's in a daze and does not follow.  Hence Kingsley gets killed by Sil.  This behavior on the part of both men makes no sense.

Another thing that makes no sense is why is Sil hanging around Los Angeles?  Everyone thinks she's dead and she ought to be relocating elsewhere.  But instead she actually visits the team in their hotel - why?  Who know?  and this leads to her death.

2100166,5,B0002KPHWE,"Released in 1995, ""Species"" chronicles events after SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) receives a transmission from outer space detailing alien DNA structure, along with instructions on how to splice it with human DNA. This gives birth to Sil, a girl (Michele Williams) who escapes and rapidly grows into a statuesque blond obsessed with mating (Natasha Henstridge). Government agent Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) assembles a team to locate and destroy Sil before she finds a mate and breeds. The team includes a tough mercenary (Michael Madsen), an anthropologist (Alfred Molina), a molecular biologist (Marg Helgenberger) and an empath (Forest Whitaker).

I saw Species years ago and, for some reason, developed an eye-rolling attitude toward it; maybe it was due to Roger Eberts negative review, I don't know. In any case, Im glad I gave it a fresh viewing because this is a top-of-the-line sci-fi/adventure/horror flick. People look down on it because of the nudity and mild sex scenes, which prompts them to disdain it as exploitive and trashy. While Natasha Henstridge is a good-lookin woman, she doesnt do anything for me (I prefer shorter, rounder women) so I was able to totally overlook this element and focus on the films other attributes.

For one, the score by Christopher Young is excellent. Secondly, the A-list cast is a highlight and their characters are increasingly fleshed-out in the story. Lastly, while people understandably write-off the movie as a Grade B plot with Grade A production, theres more here than meets the eye. For instance, Sil is the innocent pawn of the extraterrestrials who sent the DNA (more on this below). Another example is the excellent character of Dan (Whitaker) whom whiners complain about as always pointing out the obvious when the movie shows over and over that he DOES know things the others don't and they ignore him to their own peril. Dan is necessary so that the team knows what direction the creature takes on repeated occasions; without Dan wed see them pursue one boring dead-end after another.

While snobby film critics love to hate Species its a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi adventure with an interesting moral and a great cast of characters. If you like films like Alien, Aliens, Terminator, Terminator 2 and Predator youll probably appreciate it. It may not be as good as Aliens, Terminator and Terminator 2, but its on par with Alien (and marginally better IMHO) and superior to Predator. Then again, it depends on what you want in a sci-fi blockbuster. As far as Im concerned, Species delivers the goods.

The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in the areas of Los Angeles and Brigham City, Utah.

GRADE: A-

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Dont read further unless youve seen the movie)

The theory is postulated by the mercenary and biologist that the alien DNA was sent as a biological weapon, a weed killer from outer space to wipe out the galactic weed of earth or, more accurately, the human race that inhabits it. Its a fascinating concept and the film compellingly realizes it.",1446681600,,3055,5.025691699604743

2100173,4,B0002KPHWE,"I love sci-fi. This is an inventive fiction about how  contact with aliens may play out. It does, however, fuel our collective paranoia re contact. The higher technology always absorbs those unprepared for it. A prime example would be the destruction of American Indian culture by virtue of exposure to European culture. We would do equally poorly, in the face of alien technology, against which we haven't any hope of anything even resembling a viable defense. We can only hope, once contact has been made, that they are, and remain, benevolent. For example, look up ""The Battle of Los Angeles"" in which we were, are, and remain unable to do battle (defenseless). Forget aliens. Do we have any defense against our own species? Bloody unlikely!! We have a long history of wittingly, or unwittingly, destroying everything in our path. Maybe aliens could teach us a well deserved lesson in humility.

2100179,2,B0002KPHWE,"Time-wasting enterprise features a nifty little sf premise about extraterrestrial life on Earth, a premise that unfortunately lacks any plot or story to follow up its rather threadbare antics with. Sadly, what plot there is seems to have had a great amount of potential but it has been reduced to a mere skin-fest (not that I'm complaining about Natasha) that has little to redeem its potentially intriguing setup. It appears to me that Dennis Feldman's original story began life with some tremendous ideas, and then thanks to so much rewriting and tinkering (probably by the studio geniuses who got involved) his concepts became so watered down that there was little vitality left to any of the ones that survived these revisions. While Henstridge is a glorious visual treat, the only other aspect of the film that registers is the awe-inspiring designs of the phantasmagorical H. R. Giger, whose ""train"" design is the stuff of pure nightmare. Still, his ""Alien""-clone model at the film's end doesn't redeem a script featuring such trite and imbecilic characters, such thin storytelling, and such poor cinematic drive--plus, the alien is a bit too CGI-enhanced for my judgment, something that the original 1979 ""Alien"" creature certainly was not. It could have been a new addition to the science fiction movie canon, but as it stands now ""Species"" is merely a dud that never hatched. Of all the potential big money dollar Hollywood remakes that are on deck, this is the number one title that deserves to be first in line (alongside rewrites of Larry Cohen's ""Q: the Winged Serpent"", and the original German version of ""Horrors of Spider Island"", which could actually be intensely sexy if done correctly). Visually, ""Species"" is not completely devoid of interest, but it is a major disappointment overall. In fact, if you are interested in the story itself, I suggest you get hold of a copy of Yvonne Navarro's novelization; apparently it was written with Feldman's close cooperation, and it contains more content and details than this incomplete screenplay version.
The extras on the disc are worth seeing--especially the one featuring the making of Giger's alien designs for the movie in which we are given a virtual tour of his creative workshop (now this guy has one of the most operative minds working in the arena of fantasy art and film), but the others are only moderately interesting depending upon how much you actually enjoy the film. There are intriguing things to look for, but if you are a genre enthusiast, you'll most likely find something else to watch soon enough. D+",1424304000,,2585,5.0

2100217,5,B0002KPHWE,"I saw this film in a theater back in July of 1995.  I liked it; I thought it was goofy and exciting.  I've lost track of the number of times I've watched it since.  But every time I watch it, I am still enthralled by its unique brand of absurdity.  The premise has to do with a group of scientists sending transmissions into space.  Like idiots giving out passwords and bank account numbers, they include human DNA in their friendly transmissions, here's what we're made of.  Surprisingly, they receive a response that tells them how to splice alien DNA with ours.  Before you can say holly Hanna, we're got a monster on our hands; they've got a monster on their hands.  It's a rapidly growing, human looking girl they name Sil (it never pays to name your experiments).  They try to kill the poor kid with  cyanide gas but apparently forgot the part about her being half alien.  She escapes and rapidly evolves into a buxom beauty (Natasha Henstridge) with the alarming need to bare her breasts every two seconds, to all and sundry.  Have a look at these!  And mate with me.  (What a pickup line.)  Naturally, a crack team of problem solvers is assembled to deal with the problem.  There's the idiot who set all of this in motion (Ben Kingsley as Xavier Fitch), his gun toting henchman (Michael Madsen as Preston Press Lennox), an anthropologist (Alfred Molina as Dr. Arden), the beauteous molecular biologist (Marg Helgenberger as Dr. Baker), last and least, there's an empath (Forest Whitaker as Dan the empath.....like that's a real job).  Of course, they're always a step behind and pumped full of dumb ideas.  Hey, let's just fiddle with the alien part of the DNA and see what we get!  It isn't long before Sil is calling all the shots.  It ends pretty much as you expect it to but it's fun all the way.  A glorious mishmash of stupidity and audacity.",1401062400,,1856,4.580547112462006

There is nothing in this movie that is not meant to stimulate the average male in one way shape or form, from the gratuitous violence to the nudity to the humor, and while the whole affair is a giant heap of OBVIOUS, it is also kind of fun, and I was stimulated so I guess it worked.

2100246,3,B0002KPHWE,"As is the the case with many directors, Roger Donaldson has had a peppered career. Species wasn't one of his better efforts, but the fault might have been more due to his not slapping writer Dennis Feldman around for a better script.

Here's the scoop. Some scientists have found some alien DNA and infused it into a human egg. The resulting child is growing at an impossibly quick rate. When they realize things are getting out of hand they try to kill her. She manages to escape and soon becomes a gorgeous woman looking to procreate. The scientists hire a mixed team of specialists (one is an enforcer) to try and find her and rub her out before she breeds any alien spawn and endangers the planet.

This sports a really good cast. Ben Kingsley, Mike Madsen, Al Molina, Forest Whitaker, Marg Helgenberger and a very young Michelle Williams are all veterans. They generally do a stand up job save for Forest. I just didn't like the way he played the 'empath.' But, as well as this started out, it just began to fall apart. Somehow I just don't think you're going to put heavy duty automatic weapons in the hands of people who've never used them and  have them chase a dangerous alien down a sewer. And of course they had to leave the sequel door open at the end in the case they needed to drain more money out of it (which they did). H.R. Giger designed the alien and it looks like his work. It's one of the better aspects of the movie. This was a decent enough idea that suffered under a poor script.

2100266,3,B0002KPHWE,"Any movie with an HR Giger alien is automatically worth investigating -- the man has an ongoing nightmare for an imagination.

And sadly that is the biggest innovation of ""Species,"" an interesting but deeply flawed sci-fi movie that tries to inject some sex appeal into tentacled reptilian horrors. It's an entertaining story about a baby-crazed alien woman and the group who is trying to stop her, but the story falls apart at the end.

An alien civilization sent SETI a formula for combining their DNA with ours.  Scientists created a half-alien child named Sil (Michelle Williams) -- and when they try to kill her to ""terminate"" the experiment, she breaks out.  So Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) calls on a bounty hunter (Michael Madsen), two scientists (Alfred Molina, Marg Helgenberger) and an empath (Forest Whitaker) to find her.

The problem is, Sil has rapidly matured into a beautiful woman (Natasha Henstridge) and is driven by an incredibly strong reproductive drive. Unfortunately, she's also leaving a trail of corpses behind her. The team are playing a wild cat-and-mouse game with the sensual alien, hoping to stop her before she pops out a kid.

There are two major things you will remember about ""Species"": HR Giger's elegantly nightmarish design for Sil's true form... and boobies. Lots of boobies. It's basically your standard people-hunting-an-alien story, but with the addition of some steamy sex scenes and lots of nude/semi-nude Natasha Henstridge.

And for the first 3/4ths, it works fairly well. The story is split between Sil's adventures in L.A. and the team's attempts to track her, and there's a healthy dose of gore, sex, and nightmarish surrealism (GNASHING SKULL TRAIN!). But things unravel in the last act when Sil transforms into a hilariously awful CGI model, and the sillness is amped up to 11 -- seriously, nipple tentacles?!

As for the characters... well, none of them are very fleshed out. Michael Madsen is interesting as a bounty hunter for the government, and Molina and Helgenberger are pretty standard ""good scientist"" types. Ben Kingsley looks vaguely disinterested, as if he doesn't really want to be here.

Oh, and Forest Whitaker is UTTERLY WASTED as the Deanna Troi ""empath."" Seriously, the dude never says anything that either hasn't been revealed already, or isn't glaringly obvious. If Sil had stolen a fridge filled with food, his brilliant revelation would be, ""She's hungry."" He could have been cut from the movie without any impact.

But Natasha Henstridge is really brilliant as Sil. She's an enigmatic, childlike creature with a child's cruelty and curiosity -- she's as likely to smash another woman's spine as she is to buy a frilly dress, and Henstridge really gives it life.

""Species"" is burdened with flimsy characters and a silly climax, but it is a fairly entertaining ""killer alien"" story nonetheless. Too bad they didn't stop here.",1340496000,,2898,5.105708245243129

""Species"" probably isn't one of Forest Whittaker's proudest moments either, although he does a competent turn as the psychic and ""empath"" who can read the alien's mind and sometimes anticipate her moves.

Bottom line: If you like women, Henstridge in the starring role is worth the price of admission by herself.  She's almost as beautiful as Grace Kelly in ""Rear Window"" and every bit as sexy as Elisha Cuthbert in ""Girl Next Door,"" even during the approximately half of Natasha's screen time where the script calls for her to have her clothes on (hint, hint).

2100275,3,B0002KPHWE,"""Species"" (1995) is directed by Roger Donaldson (The Recruit, The Bank Job). This sci-fi horror film stars a notable cast from Ben Kingsley to Forest Whitaker, Michael Madsen and Alfred Molina. Natasha Henstridge plays an alien who is a product of science. An alien transmission gives information about alien DNA which earth scientists use to splice with human DNA. The movie is primarily a chase to track down the alien which escapes from the lab before it can mate and reproduce. The movie was a lot more fun to watch than I originally remembered it being when I first saw it in 1995. The creature itself is a creation of H.R.Giger.

The movie has unfortunately not been remastered, and I was surprised to see how many instances of dust are on this relatively recent film, particularly at the front end of the film. This however didn't spoil my enjoyment of the film once the action got started. Perhaps one of the biggest pluses with this set is that the blu-ray version has a featurette (in standard definition) with H.R. Giger working in his studio/house on the skull-train that appears in the dream sequences.

2100278,4,B0002KPHWE,"A science fiction based adventure with a fresh premise, Species (1995) is still probably most remembered for Natasha Henstridge's provocative performance in her feature film debut.  With a background in fashion and modeling, the shapely twenty one year old was very comfortable with her body, and had few inhibitions about nudity.  These factors would prove to be quite helpful, in the role of a sexy looking alien, seeking to reproduce.  In addition to Henstridge, the film directed by Roger Donaldson (Thirteen Days), features a stellar cast that includes Ben Kingsley (Ghandi), Michael Madsen (Kill Bill), Marg Helgenberger (CSI), Forest Whittaker (The Last King of Scotland), Alfred Molina (Spider-Man 2), and Michelle Williams (Dawson's Creek).

As part of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) program, the US Government receives information from an alien race about how to create a new form of life.  A research team headed by Xavier Finch (Kingsley) successfully produces a female alien named Sil, who escapes from a lab in Utah, when an attempt is made to terminate her life.  Looking like a teenager, young Sil (Michelle Williams) escapes aboard a freight train, and then switches to a passenger train bound for Los Angeles.  Aboard the train, Sil transforms into an adult (Henstridge), and hits LA eager to find a mate.

The Government organizes a team to hunt down the alien.  Biologist Laura Baker (Helgenberger), anthropologist Stephen Arden (Molina), expediter Preston Lennox (Madsen), and empath Dan Smithson (Whitaker), are recruited to join the team led by Fitch.  Tracking Sil, the team finds a bloody trail of those she has rejected as mates.  As the group closes in, Smithson emerges as one of the keys to being able to locate Sil.  The alien is quickly learning skills that help her to survive, and she does eventually find a mate, before escaping into the sewer system to give birth.

Although the film features special effects at key points, there isn't an overreliance on CGI.  The affects are generally done pretty well, and Species does not appear too dated.  Sil doesn't have a lot of dialog, and the character is heavily defined by her actions, as well as Natasha Henstridge's physical attributes.  Her naked body is amply exposed at various times, but the nudity is tasteful, and appropriate to the story, which is constructed better than your average monster flick.  Henstridge's performance has an uninhibited innocence, and makes for an impressive debut.  Madsen, Helgenberger, and Whitaker also assume lead roles, and help to bring the film to an exciting climax.

Recorded some ten years after completion, a commentary track featuring director Donaldson, and stars Madsen and Henstridge, is informative, lively, and entertaining.  Everyone is on good terms, and seems to be in a candid mood.  Henstridge seems to have no regrets about making the film, and recalls how she was robbed while out on a date with one of the cast.

The success of Species has inspired as least three sequels, with Henstridge starring in Species II (1998), and making a cameo in Species III (2004).  The franchise may have finally run its course with Species: The Awakening (2007).  Well written, with sharp dialog, the original film is far and away regarded by most, as the best of the series, and strongly recommended to fans of science fiction and action movies.",1279324800,,3390,5.1107078039927405

This blech-gak-ptooey sci-fi thriller is in fact mostly ptooey - sillier than it is frightening. The movie puts the definitive '90s twist on the old alien-is-loose scenario: she's a six-foot blonde goddess, and all she wants to do is copulate. If you decided to pass on this load of goosey nonsense while it was in the theaters, it's easy to see why: its biggest star was Ben Kingsley, and it reeked heavily of Alien rip-off. But SPECIES had one thing all three Alien movies didn't have -- sex.

In short, the movie details what a beautiful alien/human (spawned by dark and stupid government forces from alien DNA received via radar) must go through to spawn in L.A. Sil (glassy-eyed model Natasha Henstridge) is a guileless, Nordic, man-hungry mating machine whose life cycles are commemorated by a trail of male corpses. Sil's F/X designs were indeed mustered up by H.R. Giger, the depressive Swiss artist behind that distinctive rib-cage-and-womb vibe that anyone who's seen Alien will instantly recognize. Sil is pursued through L.A.'s worst nightclubs and bachelor pads by head honcho Kingsley, sleepy manhunter Michael Madsen, blubbering ""empath"" Forest Whitaker, scientific Brit Alfred Molina and hot-to-trot biologist Marg Helgenberger.

SPECIES gets its snarkiest thrills from Sil's nightmarish physical changes, though they're less shocking than cool, like watching a blister rash spread on your own arm. In fact, the scare factor is dwarfed by the movie's bumper crop of outrageous Freudian subtext. It's the winner of this year's What This Movie's Really About Award: there's really no way to ignore the film's horrified view of feminine body rites, from puberty to childbirth. (The sequel should have taken on menopause.) The film practically shudders with fear: fear of sex, of menstruation, of dating, of female orgasms, of impotence, of fatherhood, of pregnancy, of birth, of statuesque blondes who undress in front of you without your having to so much as buy them a cocktail first.

Well, the last one might be a legit source of dread, but wouldn't it have been more interesting, though significantly less hilarious, if Sil hadn't been gorgeous - can you imagine the drama of a homely alien trying to get laid in L.A.? But it's not our fear we're writing about, anyway - it's the filmmakers'. Their apparent horror outpaces ours by a mile. Giger, director Roger Donaldson, writer Dennis Feldman, co-producer Frank Mancuso Jr.- these guys must have some super dating stories. We can't help picturing them dissolving into quaking, bug-eyed panic whenever their wives complain of mid-month bloat. In the movie, catch Sil's tentacle-filled cocoon-transformation from girl to woman - it's the wackiest first period ever captured on film. Every time she gets aroused after that, it's time for some poor sucker to get mauled. You'd imagine that somebody might have noticed that the film boils down to a bunch of nervous guys covering their testicles. But apparently no one did; maybe it is all just subconscious terrors worming their way to the surface.

Which is even better, frankly; it's a timeless joy when Hollywood unknowingly unleashes its own neuroses on the world. We laughed so hard we nearly popped a blood vessel in our eye when Sil aggressively tries to mount one guy in a pool and the luckless dope promptly loses his ...erm... drive. She turns into a cat-eyed alien thing and kills him. And there's plenty of incidental fun to be had: Helgenberger is charming, the computerized effects are startling, and there's even the infrequent, authentically frightening scene.

Though it's far more polished, SPECIES reminded us most of HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP, a Doug McClure piece of crap in which rangy reptilian creatures rape and impregnate human women. Real sweet stuff.

This is one generic, zero-effort transfer and I hope to never see this bland of a transfer again on Blu.

I have to admit that even though this flick is pretty dumb, I actually found it entertaining. What it lacked in intelligence was compensated in gore. The movie doesn't have the creepiness of Alien nor does it have the action of predator, but somehow it managed to keep my attention for the whole length of the picture. The movie starts in a top secret laboratory where scientists have found an alien life form that can be genetically mutated with our human DNA. The result is a beautiful female alien named Sill; who looks human on the outside but in fact is tentacle/ugly looking alien in the inside. Anyway this alien manages to escape her compound and run away. Now the government and a group of scientist are looking for her before she mates and creates the ultimate species. The movie isn't that realistic... But hey it's science fiction so it is excusable. If you are looking for a movie to watch over the weekend where you don't need that many brain cells to comprehend the thin plot go an rent SPECIES.

2100294,3,B0002KPHWE,"1995's Species was a studio's attempt to replicate the start of a new sci-fi/horror franchise like the one begun by Ridley Scott's Alien. Roger Donaldson was tapped to direct this attempt with a cast that included Sir Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Marge Helgenberger, Forrest Whitaker and Alfred Molina. The lucky gal who gets to play the role of Sil --- the half-alien, half-human hybrid --- fell on the stunning and gorgeous shoulders of Natasha Henstridge.

Species pulls from so many different sci-fi/horror films and shows from the past that it's hard to find anything original in the story. There's stuff from Alien, The Hidden, and even some episodes of The X-Files. The one original twist in this derivate film was the plot of an alien race sending over the genetic markers of its race and instructions on how to recombine it with human DNA to create a form of hybrid. Why the scientists decided to go through with such a seemingly dangerous task is known only to the writer who put pen to paper to create the screenplay. The acting by the select group of experts (Madsen, Helgenberger, Molina, Kingsley and Whitaker) are ok enough and none embarrass themselves in the end. Henstridge does a fine job of being sexy and hot. It helped that she pretty much was naked through most of the film, or at least put herself in situations to be naked.

The art design of Sil as the evolved alien hybrid came courtesy of the great Swiss surrealist, H.R. Giger who also did the design for the alien creature in Alien. Giger's biomechanical designs have always been disturbing and beautiful at the same time and he didn't disappoint with his design of Sil. If there was a quibble on Sil's final design it was that it still resembled abit too much of the alien design in Ridley Scott's Alien. But it was still great to see H.R. Giger still creating such wonderful artwork and designs for people to see. His popularity has always been mostly composed of the elite circles of the artworld and those small, loyal art groups with a penchant for the surreal, weird and disturbing.

In the end, Species was a good sci-fi/horror that didn't bore too much and for those who enjoy their gore this film had its equal share of the red stuff. Gratuitious nudity and sex from Natasha Henstridge as Sil the alien hybrid and the excellent designs from H.R. Giger gives this film enough good things to look at. It doesn't bring anything new and pretty much reuses alot of other things from other movies, but Species was good enough albeit derivative of better past films and shows.",1154822400,,2559,4.694877505567929

2100297,2,B0002KPHWE,"Species (Roger Donaldson, 1995)

I commented recently in my review for The Italian Job: ""But then, how bad can a movie be when your cast list includes...."" Species is one of the films that provides my answer.

Species takes a four-time Academy Award nominee (with one win), a five-time Emmy nominee (with one win), a BAFTA nominee (who should have been nominated for more than one Academy Award over the years), and Michael Madsen, one of the most brilliant underrated actors of his generation, combines them with a creature designed by another Academy Award winner, and turns them loose on a script that would have been laughed out of studios in the fifties when horror movies were made with villains who were things like big plants or fifty-foot-long praying mantises. It would've been at least worthwhile if it had been meant as a send-up of bad ""combine things with radiation and get a sci-fi film"" fifties Z-grade movies, but it's unfortunately obvious that Donaldson, who's been responsible for other such cinematic classics as Cadillac Man and Cocktail (though, in his defense, he was also responsible for a really fun indie flick in the early eighties called Smash Palace seen by far too few Americans), took his subject matter all too seriously.

In case you need a description of the rail-thin plot, thus: a scientist (Kingsley, Oscar winner for Gandhi) receives a message from outer space that gives mankind the necessary knowledge to alter human DNA for reasons unknown. Of course, he decides on an experiment, named Sil (played as an adult by Natasha Henstridge in her first feature film) which gets out of hand. When that happens, he hand-picks a team of specialists in various fields to come in, find, and neutralize Sil: Preston Lennox (Kill Bill's Madsen), Stephen Arden (Frida's Alfred Molina), Dan Smithson (Forest Whitaker of Good Morning Vietnam and Bird fame), and Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger of CSI). Together with the scientist, they go looking for Sil. Which takes the rest of the movie, more or less, and results in a lot of gore, stuff blowing up, and really, really stupid remarks from the cast.

The movie is horrifying, but certainly not in the way its director seems to have intended. * ",1126742400,,2221,4.912

2100301,3,B0002KPHWE,"The thing that amazes me about ""Species"" isn't the story, special effects, or musical score, it's the cast.  You'd think that a movie with a fairly average sci-fi plot like this one couldn't muster the A-list actors that it did.  However, ""Species"" comes with a solid cast that includes the wonderful Ben Kingsley(Ghandi), Michael Madsen(Reservoir Dogs), Marg Helgenberger(CSI, China Beach), Alfred Molina(Boogie Nights, Spiderman 2), and Forrest Whittaker(Phenomenon).  It also introduces us to the lovely Natasha Henstridge, who is probably the main catalyst for so many men who love this film.

As stated earlier, the storyline is fairly standard.  Man gets a message from space containing information on a DNA strand.  It's mingled with human DNA and the result is a creature hellbent on destroying mankind by breeding with any man it can get its hands on in order to produce more alien offspring.  In a nutshell, it's the end of the world as we know it thanks to a bunch of randy aliens.

The alien is a young child at the beginning of the film(Michelle Williams of Dawson's Creek).  When the scientist(Kingsley) leading the team responsible for the alien child sees that it is not worth researching anymore, he decides to have her destroyed.  But of course, she escapes, hitches a train ride, cocoons herself and rises out of the metamorphisizing goo as Natasha Henstridge minus clothing.  She kills a train worker for clothes, then sets out to breed.

Kingsley gathers a group of professionals to help him hunt down the alien, who goes by the name of Sil. Sil manages to stay just one step ahead of the team as they trace her steps from body after body of men and predatory women.  The ending is pretty stock, though it does leave a slightly silly window for a sequel(I haven't viewed either of the sequels).

The movie is fun to watch.  The story is just interesting enough to keep you intrigued.  You know what is going to happen in the end, but you still want to see how the team is going to finally catch up to and destroy Sil.  The special effects are pretty good.  H.R. Giger had a hand in designing the Sil creature, so expect something similar to the ""Alien"" creature here.  There is plenty of eye-candy, but the nudity seems to work pretty good in this flick.  Naturally, Henstridge's character spends a lot of time naked, but not so much that the film comes across as a late-night flick on Showtime or Cinemax.  Only one of the nude scenes came across as awkward, and it involved a brief glimpse of Marg Helgenberger while she's having a fling with Madsen's character.  The whole sequence seemed unnecessary.  You'd have to be an idiot to not understand what was going on between the two.

I'd rent this flick before purchasing it.  If you like somewhat cheesey sci-fi, then you'll probably enjoy this flick.  If you just want a little titillation, there are plenty of films out there that can satisfy your cravings better than this movie.",1104710400,,2956,4.758349705304519

2100303,5,B0002KPHWE,"The idea of an alien invasion being carried out by a lone creature looking to mate so as to give birth to a whole new race of its kind has, I believe, been done in a few movies before ""Species"" but probably not with such effective horror, intelligence, high-caliber performances, realistic special effects and scorching sexiness.  Easily one of the best horror/science fiction crosses, with Natasha Henstridge playing the alien Sil in her humanlike form and some colossal effects handling the far more frightening but also impressive alien form.  One possible angle on the whole movie that I'm not sure if anybody else got or if I'm just seeing things in a weird way again is - and this isn't a spoiler because the idea isn't explored here or in Species 2, and as far as I know it doesn't come up in the 3rd one (although I haven't yet seen it) - if I remember correctly, the movie in its beginning was quite clear that the transmission where they got the code for the alien DNA to create Sil was an INCOMPLETE transmission, and they had to fill in the gaps on their own.  The 'incomplete' bit seems to me to suggest an intriguing possibility that something went wrong in the creation, even that maybe the original senders of the code never meant for the lifeform to be vicious?  This would tie right in with how Sil seems to enter a state of some confusion when not in 'Mate-And-Destroy' mode.

  Fine cast of performers and characters, scores very high on action, horror, and science fiction meters, with some questions left unanswered for further exploration or thought.  And as for the 'sex appeal' element, hinging on Henstridge's turn as Sil?  Natasha is beautiful And pretty, stunning, hot and breathtaking (and that's just BEFORE she takes her clothes off, let alone after!!)

Followed by two lesser sequels, the original Species offers plenty of sci-fi/horror thrills and nudity as well, with Henstridge, as sad as it may sound, in the role she was born to play.

2100307,4,B0002KPHWE,"For years we humans have been looking for signs of life other than what's on this great, greasy mud ball we affectionately know as Earth.  We've sent probes, satellites, and signals out into that vast darkness...we've searched the heavens with powerful telescopes and listened with highly sophisticated equipment design to detect anything that could point to the possibility of intelligence other than our own...and for all our efforts we got...squat...that is, until now...

Directed by Roger Donaldson (I was a bit wary here, as this was the man responsible for awful films Cocktail and Cadillac Man, but he did a really good film in that of No Way Out, so I'm torn...), Species (1995) stars certainly an interesting cast including the very busy Ben Kingsley (Ghandi), who slated to appear in a whopping seven films in 2005 (I think he's trying to compete with Gene Hackman and Michael Caine for the title of most prolific actor), Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill Vol's 1 and 2), Alfred Molina (Doc Ock in a little film called Spider-Man 2), Forest Whitaker (I'm still highly annoyed with this guy, who I generally like as an actor, for appearing in John Travolta's ego stroking pet project Battlefield Earth...damn you John Travolta!), Marg Helgenberger (CSI), and introducing every sci-fi nerd's wet dream, the highly curvaceous and infinitely squeezalicious Natasha Henstridge (I can't help wonder if this film would have done as well had they chosen another actress, say Rosie O'Donnell?  I suppose not...)

Anyway, it seems all of our efforts to find intelligent life in space has finally paid off, as a message was received, one detailing plans regarding re-sequencing human DNA to create a human/alien hybrid.  The gooberment project, headed by Xaiver Fitch (Kingsley) has succeeded, creating a new life form in that of girl known as Sil (who later becomes Henstridge, due to a rapid, internal development process).  Now, I would have thought it unwise to screw around with space DNA, as who knows what you'll get, but they also received instructions for a limitless energy supply from the same source, so they assumed the aliens who sent the message were friendly...gullible fools.  After it's decided that Sil is progressing too quickly, and may become dangerous, the secret group agrees the best course is termination, but Sil disagrees, and escapes.  Since it's not feasible to announce to the general public that there's a dangerous human/alien hybrid on the loose, one created by our own gooberment, in the newspapers and on TV, Fitch assembles a specialized team to track and kill Sil before she reaches her full potential, something they are still unsure of...but here's a hint...it involves making with the boom boom and the pitter patter of tiny little feet...or claws, or whatever...

I saw this film with a married couple when first released, and my friend and I thought it was pretty darn good, but his wife felt different.  When asked why she didn't like the movie, she said ""There was too much nudity.""  At that point I left well enough alone rather than try to explain how, since Sil was unfamiliar with our customs, clothing, at times, was optional for her.  I will agree there was a whole lot of nekkidness, but hey, I'm a guy, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't like to see beautiful nekkid women.  Obviously Henstridge was chosen for her assets, and her willingness to display them, but she did say much later that the role opened many doors for her...I'm sure it did...the plot, a group of diverse specialists gathered together to deal with an unusual problem, smacks of any number of Michael Crichton stories, as they all play out this way, but it's not done quite as well here as it is in a Crichton story.  The actors do well enough with what they're given, but there was shallowness in each of their characters.  I suppose this matters little, as the film is meant to be just fun and exciting, and not an in depth character study.  I did find Whitaker as Dan the empathic character a bit annoying at times, as his abilities seemed to work with pinpoint accuracy at times, but conveniently fail at critical moments.  Madsen, as the gooberment `liquidator' brings nothing we haven't seen in a handful of his other roles, making me think he graduated from The Keanu Reeves School of Acting with honors.  The plot has its problems, but it seems to care little as it rolls along at a fairly speedy pace, and does keep the audience engaged.  I thought some of the characters were a bit too `hands on', specifically Fitch, especially since he seemed to have a whole lot of resources available to him (as we all know, the gooberment has the deep pockets, and seem to care little for how they throw our tax dollars around).  The special effects do look really good, and the distinctive H.R. Giger (Alien) influences are very apparent (he actually design the human/alien hybrid creature) and entirely worth any fan of Swiss auteur's surrealistic work to check this film out.

The wide screen picture on this DVD looks really good, and the audio is available in three formats DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround.  I'm not entirely sure what qualifies this as a `special edition', other than two separate commentary tracks, one featuring director Roger Donaldson and actors Michael Madsen and Natasha Henstridge, and a second with director Roger Donaldson, producer Frank Mancuso Jr., visual effects supervisor Richard Edlund, and creature and special makeup effects creator Steve Johnson.  There is a trailer for this film, along with a few others for other MGM releases, and a sneak peek into Species 3 (which I think is going to be a direct to video release), but not a whole heck of a lot else.  I just thought the popularity of the film would have meant more...like a Giger video sketchbook or something...oh well...

Although the action stalls a little in some places, sci-fi and action fans should still find this to be a worthwhile film.",1096329600,,1291,5.163461538461538
2100310,3,B0002KPHWE,"Okay, face it.  This is not a great movie.  It can be enjoyable to watch, and Natasha Henstridge is ... and fun.  Having said that, there is no doubt that the plot tends to be silly at times, and there are more than a few holes in the script.
The odd thing about this film is how little ""blood and gore"" it really shows.  So many movies go overboard in that department.  And although there are a lot of uncomfortable scenes in the film, without exception they do not linger any longer than absolutely necessary.  Lighting, camera angles, and cuts are designed to leave much to the imagination rather than parading body parts until you want to -- well, you get the idea.  An awful lot of moviemakers could learn something from this ""little"" film.
I must admit -- I enjoy this film.  (I also admit that I don't always watch the last scene.)  But most of all, I have a list of movies that I wish showed the kind of (don't laugh) subtlety in cinematography that this one does.  Think about it.
And enjoy the film.  It is supposed to be fun.  And it is.",1070841600,,1048,4.290816326530612
2100311,3,B0002KPHWE,"In this B-grade Sci-fi flick, the government combines alien DNA with human eggs resulting in a female alien/human hybrid dubbed Sil.  The alien, played by Natashia Henstridge, has an insatiable urge to procreate.  It's basically a big master plan by the aliens who sent the DNA to colonize earth.  Sil escapes her captivity and goes on the prowl for unsuspecting men to impregnate her.  Meanwhile the government dispatches a handpicked team to find Sil.  Led by the sarcastic Michael Masden and the compassionate Marg Hellenberger, the team tracks Sil to Los Angeles.  Here the body count rises as the team races to find Sil before she can mate.
The concept is a good one and the acting/dialog is on par with what you would expect from B-grade Sci-fi.  Sil's alien persona is based on creatures created by artist H.R. Giger (Giger also created the designs for the creatures in the Aliens movies).  Giger's biomechanical aliens often take on sexual overtones, a concept that is carried through in this movie.  The movie plays like a X-Files episode at times as Masden and Helenberger take center stage in the hunt for Sil.  The computer generated FX in the closing scenes are dated, but effective.  The DVD is a budget version from MGM offering very little in the way of extras.  The movie is presented in both widescreen and full screen formats.  The picture is crisp a clear with excellent detail.  Sound is good and presented in Dolby 5.1.  Species is a definite asset to the sci-fi buffs DVD library and a must for ""creature feature"" fans.  Helenberger, Masden, and Henstridge returned a couple of years later for the inferior but entertaining sequel Species II.",1053388800,,1665,4.851063829787234

Amazon graciously replaced it but the 2nd DVD did the same thing.

Species was okay. The nudity, as I've read from a bunch of reviewers, must be the only part of this movie that makes it good, right? Wrong.
The best thing about this movie was its premise, and sadly, it wasn't made to the standard that it should've. The next best thing is the cast, minus Natasha Hendstridge. Forest Whitaker does a fairly good job as some kind of psychic, and the assassin guy (forgot his name) is good. Natasha is pure eye candy in this, and it gets boring after a while. Ben Kingsley does a sub-par job, but with the way his character was written, you have no choice.

They are dangerous and agressive and they have to be destroyed. The aliens are the creation of the famous Giger, the creator of the other and world-famous aliens from the series Alien-etc. Great animals.

2100321,2,B0002KPHWE,"Part of this is ripped-off from ""Alien"" and part of it is a corruption of a very fine sci-fi idea now probably forty-years old.  Premise: a message from outside our solar system gives the DNA code for an alien species to grow within a human reproductive cell or embryo.  Not able to resist such juicy stuff, scientist Ben Kingsley (as wooden as you'll ever see him) follows the recipe and lo and behold a beautiful monster is reared.  And escapes.  Naturally.
So far so cute.  She leaps over fences and crashes through windows and grows from pre-adolescent Michelle Williams to fully ovulating adult Natasha Henstride in days.  She has one thing on her mind: reproduction.  Anything that gets in her way she kills.  She can give a mean lingual kiss that goes out through the back of your head should she feel threatened.
Well, if this is a metaphor for the urgency of the feminine reproductive imperative I think they should have played the Power Station (?) song with the lyric, ""She wants to multiple/Are you gonna do it?"" in the background.
Anyway, as usual the plot deteriorates into a drawn-out chase scene that Hollywood thinks the mass mind craves along with the usual stupidities.  I could watch only because Henstride is sexy enough to forgive a few bad alien genes.",973728000,,1275,4.733031674208145

2100333,1,B0002KPHWE,"Species is a gory sci-fi/horror thriller that also has a lot of sex and nudity in it.  Instead of trying to be intelligent or maintain some form suspense or tension, the filmmakers decide to just bare Natasha Henstridge  fully nude every twenty minutes or so.
The plot?  Well, it starts out  interestingly enough with some government agents trying to kill a girl they  call Sil inside a complex.  She escapes and a team is quickly formed to  find her.  Apparently, Sil is a human/alien hybrid, and she's growing to a  young woman at a faster rate (and then stops once she reaches age 20 or  so).  What she wants is to breed by mating with a man and the rest of the  movie deals with the team trying to prevent this from happening (they  mostly succeed until the end).
Let's discuss the basics of this film  first.  Scriptwise, it's far from original as it closely resembles  Lifeforce, a similar (and far better) fim about an extraterrestrial  seductress that arrives on earth.  Species has some bad dialogue, the worst  of which is a scene where Michael Madsen walks past a man's gory entrails  and says ""she must have come through here.""
The movie features  some action sequences but none of them are particularly memorable, with the  exception of the one scene in which Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger  are trapped in a room that has alien DNA growing at an extremely rapid  rate.  Had the rest of the action sequences maintained that form of  suspense Species would have been fine.  Instead, the film is relegated to  some boring chase scenes along with an extremely bad finale that has some  very bad and cheesy special effects.
As for acting, it's actually decent  as the actors do an all right job though they are fed some truly inane  dialogue that could make a person cringe.  Most people watch this film for  Natasha Henstridge of course and she's nude quite a bit in the movie but  does almost absolutely nothing else.

For a film to  start so well, and end up so badly (it becomes high camp, really), is a  mystery to me.
