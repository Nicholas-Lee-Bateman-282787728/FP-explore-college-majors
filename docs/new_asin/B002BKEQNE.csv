8361572,5,B002BKEQNE,"The title of this is very appropriate, as are all of the Cheeky Girls DVD's. Start with the price. Not like IAMED( who charge $40 something a pop), and frankly I am glad that Michelle J and crew are giving them a run for their money. We need to save that extra twenty for our costumes...:)Secondly these DVD's are well produced and have plenty of bang for the buck. Great material, talented dancers,lots of variety, all around awesome. And FYI this was my first By Dancers for Dancers purchase and WON'T be my last!! ( my only concern before purchasing was that even though I dance cabaret I was worried that this would be hours of strictly cabaret performances. I do like variety. This DVD was varied enough even in the cabaret performances to be very interesting. So YAY! )",1255305600,,775,4.542857142857143
8361573,5,B002BKEQNE,"I discovered this series just this past spring, and have loved every one of them (except the first, which is no longer available, so I haven't seen it).  Each has had a variety of dancers, styles, music, and costumes.  They showcase a wide range of bellydance (and have directed me to some music I otherwise might not have discovered).  Who better to know how a dance is meant to be seen, than the one dancing?

Vol 5 lives up the advertising.  All of these women are talented and graceful, and their dances are distinctive and demonstrate each woman's strengths and talents.  A simple menu makes it easy to go straight to a favorite dancer, and the music is identified with the dancer at the beginning of the dance, along with websites if you want more information, which I feel is very useful.  Mostly, though, I just love to watch these dancers.",1254528000,2,848,4.576158940397351
8361574,5,B002BKEQNE,In this DVD of the series they branch out to find even more new talent.  I love seeing so many fantastic dancers that I have never heard of!,1253318400,2,140,4.0
8361575,5,B002BKEQNE,"Wow, that is a very rude comment! I have to say, it made me very sad. Do you think that bellydancers only come in one size and look? Michelle Joyce produces dvd's that showcase beautiful women of all shapes and sizes who love this art form and so far, everyone presented on her dvd's have been also very skillful. You really shouldn't buy into society's expectations about what beauty is. I happen to to think a confident women who happens to have fat around her abdomen is very beautiful! In fact, in many women, fat around the abdomen is very natural (childbirth, etc) and has NOTHING to do with being obese. If you prefer the bellydance superstar's series, that is fine; they are great dvd's. However, keep in mind these are produced by Miles Copeland (a man) who probably recruits mostly women who fit a certain idea of beauty. Please do not post negative comments about women and a dance form that actually liberates women from these types of societal expectations. This is a great dvd and Michelle Joyce and the dancers did an awesome job. PLEASE IGNORE HELENA LI's review.",1253232000,7,1079,4.654450261780105
8361576,5,B002BKEQNE,"So funny to see that the discussion of this dvd has turned into a debate about fat belly dancers.  None of these dancers are fat, in my opinion.  Look at the trailer if you need to see for yourself.

I love all the DVDs in the By Dancers For Dancers series.  They always feature a range of excellent dancers and have great production quality.  Whoot!  Go Michelle, your family is proud!",1252627200,4,386,4.366197183098592
8361577,1,B002BKEQNE,"I also bought this one after viewing the video clipping by M. J. Dance. It shows a fabulous dance by a beautiufl dancer. Unfortunately in the DVD, there aren't many dancers like that. Most, in my memory, are obese with digusting fat hanging round their waist, and with not very inviting looks. So bad that I don't want to view it again. Anyone can have it from me for free!

However, the one called ""Live from Paris"" or some title similar is a very good one. I kept watching it and never get bored. Every one of the dancers are very beautiful and have perfect body shapes. The dances are varied and never boring to view time and again. Music is excellent too!",1252454400,2,659,4.357723577235772
