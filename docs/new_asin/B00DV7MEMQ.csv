8598206,1,B00DV7MEMQ,"WARNING: THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS HAZZARDOUS MATERIAL!

Now you see me apparently did quite well at the box-office due to its draw-card casting. (a very Hollywood manoeuvre.) unfortunately for people with a brain the size of an atom the whole premise is as ridiculous as a Hollywood movie. it's about four (horsemen) magicians who think they're modern robin hoods. Michael cain and morgan freeman obviously needed some cash otherwise they wouldn't be in this (or would they...).
the premise is silly and from there the foundational silliness is built upon. the car crash near the end was the cherry on the botulism-cake for me. so implausible and thus so stupid.
so much computer generated graphics is doused throughout this film it seems natural. the 'acting' in it is as camp as a row of soldiers waiting for weekend at Bernie's. research revealed one was in an Australian soap opera (!)
if you can borrow this from a library or such you're free to - but DO NOT waste money on this WASTE of time and MONEY.",1524700800,,1005,4.742857142857143
