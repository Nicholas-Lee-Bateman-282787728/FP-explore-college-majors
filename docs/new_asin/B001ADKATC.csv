3499554,5,B001ADKATC,"I have been involved and trained Brazilian Jiu Jitsu since 1993. I was interested in this set due to being down from a car accident and wanted to brush back up on the fundamentals. Hands down this is the BEST investment a student of BJJ can make! Roy covers the techniques in great detail, there is no filler or fluff..just GREAT techniques with excellent instructions. All techniques are HIGH PERCENTAGE. If you haven't seen Mr. Dean's Youtube videos of his students, I suggest you check them out asap..they will show you how technical and smooth his students are!

White belt through Black Belt, it is usually the Fundamental Techniques that win a match or a fight...this is why it's important for ANYONE to review and study this set and work to master these techniques..you WILL be a beast on the mat once you understand and are able to perform these moves. There are no short cuts, what makes a person good is his mastery of the fundamentals contained in this set.

If you've been sitting on the fence about this..JUMP OFF!!! You will NOT be disappointed in this set!

Read the above review I posted, it should give you a good overview of what is contained!",1244592000,5,1168,4.628019323671498
3499555,5,B001ADKATC,"Truly outstanding! I own numerous books and DVD's on BJJ and this is, by far, truly one of the best I've seen. Well done with great techniques, insight, and tips in a concise, simple, easy to follow and execute format.  The Demonstrations on Disc 2 are an added bonus. After watching Roy Dean's BJJ Blue Belt requirements, I purchased his other products as well.  I agree with an earlier reviewer, I can't wait for a series on Purple Belt Requirements.",1242432000,,452,4.6375
3499556,5,B001ADKATC,"I have had other BJJ dvds before. None inspired me as much as those put out by Roy Dean. So much so that I put together a BJJ experiment. With only using one teachers dvd how much skill can we acquire. I have corresponded with Mr. Dean and found him as encouraging and as inspiring as his products. I hope to visit him later this year. He really has produced a quality offering.

3499557,5,B001ADKATC,"Well, i like the way R.DEAN teach his art. He makes it understandable and clear, even for a french guy like me.

3499560,5,B001ADKATC,This is a must have for any white belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  It goes over the fundamental elements of virtually every technique that one would use on the journey to blue belt.  I watched these over and over prior to my test.  It truly was the best resource other than the instructor himself.  Various views are used and the techniques are described in such a way that one can really use these to fine tune or even learn these fundamental skills.  I can't wait for the Purple Belt Requirements dvds.,1225670400,10,501,4.522222222222222

3499562,1,B001ADKATC,"Very little coverage of various positions.  Nothing on back position, side control, half guard, turtle position.  The throws/takedowns section is terribly inadequate.  And finally, the DVD should not be called Blue belt requirements.  There is NOTHING reguarding ""requirements"".  Save your money and get Saulo Ribero DVD.  It is worth the extra money.  Much better position explanations and concepts from Saulo.",1461974400,2,411,5.75

3499566,5,B001ADKATC,I love it. Roy breaks the techniques down in a detail manner for me to understand. Other instructional Brazilian Jiu Jitsu dvd's on U-TUBE  are not detailed like Roy Dean. I practice and compete in Judo and Roy methods helps elevate my newaza. Next I will purchase the Purple Belt Requirement in the Future.  I attend Brazilian Jiu Jitsu class once a week after Judo to work on my techniques from Roy's DVD. I also have a grappling dummy at home to practice and apply the techniques from the DVD.,1433635200,,496,4.5

3499574,2,B001ADKATC,"Roy Dean is a very boring narrator and sometimes scary looking throughout this dvd. The dvd's user interface was poorly designed and in many of the demo fights he actually lost. The filmography is mediocre and sort of cliche. There is an okay/good overview of the techniques with different angle's and point of view. All-in-all I would not be purchasing any of his dvd's, as a matter of fact most of the BJJ dvds are no good and it seems as though the style is all about profit making with the big names like Gracie cashing in big time.",1406332800,,536,4.424242424242424

3499578,5,B001ADKATC,Really great.  Clear and thorough.  Many angles so you can see every vital part of the move and set up.

3499583,5,B001ADKATC,"I highly recommend this title for all white Belt BJJ and Judo players to master the basics of the ground game.
What separates this video from the rest is the Instructional style is focused on mastering simplicity as opposed
to overwhelming the viewer with many tricks of the trade that are too advanced for novice BJJ players.

This title helps my progression and overall BJJ game outside of the gym because it reinforces exactly what I need to know
despite all the additional learning that may be acquired during classes at the gym and rolling with training partners.

There is a tendency to overwhelm the mind with multiple BJJ training DVDs. This title should be the 1st that any white
belt should purchase as it compliments other instructional DVDs.

Learning BJJ is similar to the overwhelming challenge of swimming in an ocean. This DVD is your life raft.",1363564800,,861,4.804054054054054
3499584,3,B001ADKATC,"The video and audio quality are very good, but there are only a handful of techniques. Most blue belts in Jiu Jitsu I know have a ton more techniques in their repertoire.  I was seriously disappointed by how few techniques Roy has in this dvd set. It's shameful.

I hope he does a better blue belt version in the near future and offers a discount to those who bought this one.",1361059200,3,376,4.28169014084507
3499585,2,B001ADKATC,"I was reading the reviews for different bjj videos and one reviewer said that this was the best. I disagree. The things it taught were good fundamentals, but it was very short and only went over a few things. That being said, it was well produced and taught, but it was not worth what I paid. this is worth maybe $12.99 and I paid $40 plus",1355097600,4,339,4.151515151515151
3499586,3,B001ADKATC,Liked the concept and the idea however the processes could be better explained and how they apply or build upon each other. It's still a very good series and can give new perspective on your game.,1355097600,,196,4.472222222222222
3499587,5,B001ADKATC,"This is a very nicely done well thought out instructional DVD.  All techniques are clearly explained, repeated multiple times and  shown from different view points.
All explanations are precise, moves broken down, pitfalls shown as well.
Dean speaks clearly and intelligently.  There are actually 2 discs, one is instructional and second one mostly motivational but showing some nice takedowns combinations as well.
One minor critique concerns filming-  the light seems to be coming mainly from behind the camera causing flattened perspective and washed  appearance of the speaking instructor.  Nevertheless all details and techniques are clearly visible.
Highly recommended.",1344211200,,675,5.836734693877551
3499588,5,B001ADKATC,"Roy Dean does an excellent job of teaching the basic arm locks, chokes, how to position and defend, transitional moves and etc. I bought this to build a concrete foundation on my bjj knowledge as a white belt and always find myself watching this to remember the basics. His explanations are very easy to understand and provides multiple views when demonstrating each move.",1343865600,,372,4.920634920634921
3499589,5,B001ADKATC,"I bought this video because of the detailed review by ""Dr. Zeus"" here on Amazon. He/she was absolutly correct. The reason for my purchase is to allow my sons to use a ""Watch, Explain and Do"" learning principal along the lines of the ""See, Say and Write"" method of learning. This video takes care of the ""see and Explain"" part. I also have them teach other kids and I watch to insure they teach correctly and not leave out the details. Roy Dean has followed the same ""BASIC"" path I did by training in Aikido and Japanese Jui-Jitsu. His training and being an Instructor in Aikido and BJJ has had a very good influence on his ability to make such a consise and detailed video. If ever there was a way to learn the basic technics for Blue Belt via video instructions, this is it. May I say that he has a video for Purple Belt, and I would be surprised if it was not of the same high standerds as this one.  For those living where there is no school of BJJ or someone like me, who had to drive 300 miles one way to study, this could be your ticket to learning BJJ. I would suggest, however that you also join an association such as Rickson Gracia's or Carlos Machado or any other such associations and attend any BJJ seminars that come close to you. Foe r that matter, I would also try to find someone local who could car pool with you and make the long trip to class at least once per week or month. I haven't said much about Roy Deans video because it has been said in detail by ""Dr. Zeus"" in his/her review. All I can add is that Roy Deans calm approch to teaching reminds me of Carlos Machido, my instructor. This video is worth every penny! I hope this helps someone on their path.

3499595,5,B001ADKATC,"When you are a white belt, you are often so caught up in not getting your ass kicked, you try to learn everything to survive, but end up mastering nothing.

Roy Dean's Blue Belt Requirements helps keep you focused on exactly what you need to work towards achieving the blue belt.  There are so many advanced technique DVD's out there for higher ranks, but this is exactly what you need when you're building the foundation.  I use the techniques Roy shows in class all the time.",1312070400,,477,4.523255813953488
3499596,4,B001ADKATC,Great introduction to basic BJJ.  The section for escapes are literally impossible to pull off (at least in my judo practice) when the opponent is really trying (his partner's loose mounts on him in the video is almost laughable).  I've never done any BJJ in real life but I have done judo for 3 years and nobody in newaza sessions would mount me so loosely as demonstrated in the video.  Never the less it's still a great introduction DVD to BJJ.,1301184000,3,447,4.493827160493828
3499597,5,B001ADKATC,"[Broad Introduction of ""the Roy Dean Academy DVD Collection"":]
There is one primary question you should ask yourself before making a purchase: is it worth it? In relation to the review at hand the question is ""what separates this DVD collection from the free lessons I'm able to YouTube?"" That answer is found in Roy Dean's unique teaching methods. From the introducing the world of BJJ to the uninitiated in comprehensible metaphors to his systematic and philosophical breakdowns of techniques, Roy Dean shines as a teacher in his DVD series, ""The Roy Dean Academy DVD Collection."" Roy's explanations are wrapped in experience, a calming philosophy of patience, and an overall focus on technique over strength and speed, providing a unique value from the YouTube experience.

_[Four Quick Points About Blue Belt Requirements:]

1. About the DVD: Focuses on arming his students with the proper tools to be an effective blue belt. Nothing fancy here, just solid, effective techniques broken down into simple, understandable examples, including additional drills to practice solo or with a partner. Hitting the ""Next"" button skips to the next technique in the category, no ""Play-All"" option, easy to navigate.

2. How This Influenced My Game: I train in a mixed martial arts gym where the focus is boxing and Muay Thai. Yeah, there's some BJJ and wrestling, but they really push the strategy of devastating from the feet. And that's why I appreciate Roy's DVD's so much, because I supplement what ground game I'm missing from my local gym and fill it with the personable, thorough methods of Roy. I know strong ground game is required in the cage and Roy Dean's awesome teaching skills fill that void. And while the Purple Belt DVD has expanded my philosphy on BJJ it's the blue belt DVD in particular has directly advanced my ground game. Roy Dean's setups for technique transitions makes these DVD's worth purchasing alone.
I practice with friends in my home MMA gym and we review these DVD's weekly. We take each session one by one and apply them to our drills (for example, time is set aside for kimura's this session, and another session is triangles). My guillotine (gillo-teen as he pronounces it) gets quicker taps, and my triangles have become more effective. While certain aspects of Roy's lessons do utilize the gi there were adjustments we made for a seemless nogi transition. HOWEVER, there are certain techniques that I am unable to translate -specifically the sweeps and collar chokes. Therefore, even as a strict nogi practitioner, I recommend this DVD as nogi friendly.

3. About Roy's Teaching Style: Roy Dean is a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Judo, and his experience is immediately apparent. Every little move -dropping the elbow, switching the hips, hand placement on opponents body, ""combing the hair,"" keeping postured, etc etc-- is all verbally detailed by Roy. Each category includes an introductory theory, the verbal walk through of the individual technique, and visual examples performed at comprehensible speeds from different angles for your viewing pleasure. With relevant concepts that display knowledge of the game and understanding of his audience, Roy Dean breaks down the basics into understandable concepts and examples. So any given technique is organized into the following:
DVD>Section>Category>Broad Introduction of Category>Individual Technique Verbal Walk through>Key points of the technique>Examples from varying angles

4. The Quality of the DVD: Clear, the sound has slight echo effects from being shot inside the dojo, but nothing hindering. Average quality for the teaching DVD category.

_[DVD Outline:]

------DVD ONE (88 Minutes)-----
-Welcome (6:53)
Introduces the newbs into the world of BJJ: explains what he knows, the frustrations of BJJ, the dedication required, and subtle life lessons for becoming a stronger minded person. In these few minutes Roy's light as an extraordinary teacher really shines forth. His patience, his insight into the advanced, and his understanding of the difficulties are all marks of a great character. This is a fantastic introduction to show any of your friends who just joined BJJ.

The Demonstrations section is exactly what is sounds like: demonstrating everything that Roy provided examples of during the DVD. The ""BJJ Combinations"" is something I'll study in the future, because as stated earlier, submission transitions are a current focus of mine. The US Open segment is short, low quality, but shows full speed grappling.

_[Closing Comments:]
If you're looking for specifics on a certain technique and that's all you need, then honestly, just stick to the resources of YouTube. However, if you're like me and crave more than the simple aspects of technique explanation, if you desire a teacher who knows, feels, and explains the game with wisdom and passion to motivate you to further absorb the concepts of BJJ, then Roy Dean is your guy. You're immersed into his teachings as a student into a class. His explanation of the nuances in BJJ, the patient breakdowns of technique, and his philosophies all make ""the Roy Dean Academy DVD Collection"" the perfect asset if you want to become a better artist on the mat and in the cage.",1298851200,27,6393,5.423967774420946
3499598,5,B001ADKATC,"The reviews here on Amazon that precede mine are very accurate and detailed. I would agree with all the positives and offer nothing negative. This set was bought to help refine my technique, solidify my basics, and assist me in becoming a better coach. I have to say I feel it lived up to the hype & my expectations. Already having my blue belt, I knew most of the material, but Roy is such a great instructor and so technical that I was still able to learn new material from a new perspective.  Every teacher has their own method, so if you are open to at least a comparison you are able to learn & this set has several small details that are there in each section. I like how he always explains the ""why"" behind things, right when you are usually asking yourself! There are pieces here and there ( intentionally, I feel) that segue the path to purple belt and set you up successfully.

One question I had was whether or not his method was equally transferable to no gi and the answer is yes, for anyone wondering.  I practice almost entirely no gi & with a little knowledge of clinchwork, it's been no problem.  I'm highly interested in his no gi set to see how Sensei Roy made his transitions there, but I wouldn't say it's a prerequisite to get everything out of these DVDs.

The production value is much better than average and the angles/repetitions are spot on. I found the construction of the DVDs to be a non-issue. They loaded fine in both my laptop and PlayStation 3.

Don't hesitate to purchase these instructionals. Roy Dean is the real deal and his material provides a fantastic, strong set of fundamentals that any martial artist would be better off having learned,  especially a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu student.",1294790400,3,1723,4.520900321543408
3499599,5,B001ADKATC,"I've only grappled for about 6 months so I am not an expert but Roy Dean has an excellent way of instructing. He discusses philosophy first then demonstrates the techniques from many different vantage points. He wasn't stingy on techniques and tried to save them for another disc. There are a lot of techniques for each position covered.

I am going to use this DVD to brush up on my fundamentals and I give it 5 thumbs up!",1294012800,,423,4.423076923076923
3499600,5,B001ADKATC,"I'm a big fan of Roy Dean's DVD and I have all of them.  They are very well produced and unlike some of the other DVDs, Roy communicates his points very well.  As a beginner in BJJ, this DVD series is perfect.  I go to class, my head spins because I can't remember anything.  There is so much thrown at you.  I'd go home and review the moves at my own pace and that process has been tremendously helpful.  I trained with a Machado black belt, and the techniques are near identical, which is a big plus.  After 8 months of BJJ, I still find the DVD very helpful in reminding myself of the fundamentals.  I still learn from the DVD every time I watch it.  A great series that I can recommend without any hesitation.",1284163200,2,713,4.1838235294117645
3499601,5,B001ADKATC,"I have been studying Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for about a month and a half. I got the Blue Belt Requirements 2 weeks after I started to help accelerate my training. Almost all of the core techniques presented so far are on the DVD. It makes for a great review and it provides techniques that we haven't covered yet so I have a few more things to try when we're doing live drills.

I strongly recommend these DVDs for folks who are new to BJJ. I think they would be even more valuable if you go to a school with a limited class schedule. The only drawback is that the DVDs are pretty thin as some of the other reviewers have stated. That being said, I contacted the Dean Academy about something else and mentioned that I loved the DVDs except for that. I got a prompt (same day) reply to my inquiry and learned that the DVDs were some sort of eco friendly design that many people were unfamiliar with. They're switching back to the normal DVDs from what I was told. Not sure how long it will take them to trickle out to Amazon but you may be able to order from the academy.",1280188800,,1067,4.230392156862745
3499602,4,B001ADKATC,"I like this DVD.  I will mention, as some other reviewers have, that the physical disk itself is very thin.  I've never come across a DVD this thin before, which made me worry a bit about breaking it as I was removing it from the case and putting it in and out of my DVD player (hence the reason for 4 versus 5 stars).  But it plays just fine and I haven't broken it yet.

The physical disk aside, the content of the DVD is excellent.  I'm a newcomer to BJJ (a white belt) but have studied other martial arts (black belt level).  What I liked about Roy Dean's approach to presenting the material is that he clearly explained the concepts and then clearly showed how to implement the concepts.

Many DVDs of this type will show a bunch of techniques, which is fine, but then it becomes an exercise in attempting to memorize some or all of the techniques.  BJJ is so technical and has so many techniques, that it can quickly become overwhelming.

Roy Dean, on the other hand, first spent some time talking about the concept of position in BJJ, and then showed techniques specific to improving or maintaining your position.  And this was great because improving or maintaining your position is your primary goal at the beginning.  From there you move on to other defenses and attacks (armbars, chokes, and the like), but first it's all about position.  You can neutralize much of what your opponent can do just by getting to and maintaining a superior position.

Overall (at least in my impression), there are far fewer concepts in BJJ than there are techniques.  The techniques can be grouped according to concept.  Just this mental construct for approaching BJJ helped me a great deal in digesting and retaining the material.

On top of that, Roy Dean's skill level is very evident.  He moves very smoothly from position to position.  That was inspiring to me in thinking about improving my own skill level.

Some of the extras on the DVD were also very useful.  The videos of various individuals testing for their blue belts were instructive in terms of just being able to see where their skill level was relative to some of the more advanced students and to Roy Dean himself.  I think these test segments helped put the instructional material from the DVD into perspective.

So, overall, the presentation seemed very well thought out and organized.  The techniques shown were very relevant to the target audience (BJJ white belts).  The instructions given (both verbally and visually) were very clear, precise, and thorough.  The production quality of the DVD is first rate.

The only thing I didn't like was the very thin physical material of the disk itself.  It may be just fine, maybe this is a new thing in DVDs. I've just never encountered a DVD as physically thin as this one. So far though, it's played just fine.

A highly recommended DVD for anyone interested in BJJ!",1276128000,4,2878,4.667992047713717
3499603,5,B001ADKATC,"I'm just starting with BJJ and while searching for training material to supplement my class lesson, I found Roy Dean's DVD on a local DVD store and bought it. The illustrations of techniques are great with varying degrees of difficulty (well, for a beginner like me) and by watching and training it with a dummy, I quickly learned all the tricks.

I would highly recommend this to all white belt BJJ practitioners like me. Roy Dean is a great teacher and speaker and I would definitely buy his other BJJ DVDs to supplement my training.

Keep making instructional DVDs, Roy.

Thanks!",1275350400,,582,4.742574257425742

3499605,5,B001ADKATC,I am an entry level jiu jitsu practitional who has found this video invaluable over my first couple of months.  Most beneficial in learning things to do in positions prior to being taught them.  It has given me a 'one up' on those who started training at the same time as me.,1271289600,,275,4.269230769230769

I don't know if there are different versions, but my first set was so flimsy, it go caught in my laptop drive and I had to get it replaced.  5 stars for Amazon service and content of the disk.  THe info is well organized and gets right into the basics of submissions, escapes, and chokes.  Nothing complicated.  Just pure technique.

3499607,5,B001ADKATC,"I've amassed a large library of martial arts books and video materials over the years. Roy Dean does a great job of presenting BJJ techniques for the blue belt level. I wish that I had purchased this item as a white belt because it could've saved me a lot of time and effort. However, I'm glad to have the dvd and find myself reviewing it every now and then to brush up on techniques or possible little missed details. Overall, worth while purchase for me.",1268870400,,456,4.376470588235295
3499608,4,B001ADKATC,This DVD covers a wide variety of basic movements that are essential to all Jiu Jitsu players. Roy Dean does an excellent job of thoroughly explaining the movements and the competitive mentality of basic BJJ. My only gripe about this DVD is that it does not cover basic submissions and escapes from the back; which any BJJ student knows is extremely important.,1264723200,6,360,4.82258064516129
3499609,5,B001ADKATC,Great DVD for learning BJJ. Helps prepare you for class. Easy to follow instructions. Multiple camera shots of same moves from different angles. Would buy another DVD on BJJ by Roy Dean. Worth the $.,1256688000,,199,4.714285714285714
3499610,5,B001ADKATC,"Roy Dean gives concise, easy-to-follow instruction. The techniques are clearly shown and always from multiple camera angles.

There is no filler on this DVD so you can watch it over and over again to absorb all of the little details. Highly recommended.",1254096000,,253,5.023809523809524
3499611,5,B001ADKATC,"Roy Dean has done a commendable job with this set, and the production level of the video is unsurpassed. This is an excellent, excellent instructional set. The DVD covers many of the most common ""basic"" (do not confuse ""basic"" with ""low-percentage"") BJJ techniques one would learn at any BJJ Academy. Each technique is covered in a very basic step-by-step manner, with Roy explaining very clearly what is going on in the technique, then applied at a faster and more realistic speed from 4 different camera angles.
Perhaps the greatest thing about this set is that its focus is on helping students understand both the journey from white to blue belt, and getting them along the right path and mindset to learn BJJ. Roy deliberately includes the why of doing a technique a specific way (and includes some variants for good measure) instead of just stating ""do it this way."" A great set if you're either starting out in BJJ or want to brush up on your basics to make your ground game airtight.
For those interested, some of the techniques included in this set: Escapes (mount, sidemount, sweeps), Guard passing, Submissions (numerous Gi chokes, 4 different armlocks, and 4 leglocks), and takedowns. Also included are commentaries on BJJ, basic skillsets (where to grab, positioning, etc), along with some discussion on breakfalls and some video demonstrations.
I cannot rave highly enough about this set to anyone practicing BJJ, whether a novice white belt or higher belt levels looking to improve their technical game. I train at an American Top Team gym in South Florida, and say again this is an OUTSTANDING DVD set for ANY practitioner! Excellent job!",1247788800,33,1653,4.971119133574007

8284927,5,B001ADKATC,"I just started training jiu-jitsu a month ago.  I have world-class instructors (all multiple-time IBJJF medalists), but the pace of learning is slow (which is good, of course... slow and steady teaching ingrains proper technique in new students).  Nevertheless, I wanted to learn a bit on my own, just to try a few new techniques (I am impatient and have been watching the UFC for years, so I am very eager to learn as much as possible).  I bought this DVD based on all the excellent Amazon reviews here.  Let me just say that it is exactly what I was looking for.  Roy Dean is a natural teacher who is clearly very passionate about jiu-jitsu.  Although the production value isn't exactly Warner Brothers, it is perfectly adequate (good sound, good picture quality, etc.)  Roy Dean takes special care to show techniques from multiple angles so you see (and understand) exactly what he is doing and why.  He also does an excellent job of explaining what is going on and what to look out for.  This goes far in eliminating confusion for a new jiu-jitsu practitioner like me.

But the proof, as they say, is in the pudding.  I watched the guard passing section again today before class, and what do you know?  Our instructor let us free roll for a bit, working only on guard passing.  I used the first guard pass technique in the DVD SUCCESSFULLY!  My plan now is to watch one technique every night and review throughout the week.  When I have the opportunity, I will use the new techniques in class.  This DVD is exactly what I was looking for.",1471910400,4,1542,4.572992700729927
