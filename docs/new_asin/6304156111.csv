8220591,5,6304156111,"Okay, why do I say this? How about brilliant acting, stunning visuals, exciting fight sequences, incredible lighting,and a haunting soundtrack. And I'm only scratching the surface. Even if you are not into H.K. films  normally, SEE THIS ONE!  I also would kill to get a sound track of this  film on CD. While TBWWH 2 does provide closure, only the two scenes with  Leslie Cheung are even close (emotionally) to the original. But I'm telling  you, SEE THIS MOVIE!  It is the closest thing I have ever seen to  cinematic perfection.",944784000,2,530,4.758241758241758
