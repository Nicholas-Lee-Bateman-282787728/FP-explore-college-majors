7830918,4,6302775175,The movie was actually shot in Brazil. I think this is a straight-to-video release. Looks like it was shot on a shoestring budget but the scenery looks great. The movie really picks up when the unbelievably gorgeous Rae Dawn Chong appears. She doesn't appear until 50 minutes into the movie. If you are a fan of Rae's you will love this movie. She has a deep dark skin tan in this movie.,1069804800,3,387,4.388888888888889
