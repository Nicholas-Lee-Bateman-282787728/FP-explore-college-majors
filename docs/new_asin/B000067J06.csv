1715606,2,B000067J06,"First of all I have to say, I am a HUGE fan of ""The Method"" philosophy.  I was first introduced (and subsequently, hooked!) to The Method ways in ""Precision Toning"".  Thinking this All-In-One  Workout would be similar to the toning tape, I was surprisingly  disappointed.  As evidenced by the numerous reviews oozing with adoration,  this tape is for dancers, former dancers, and the like.  If you have no  formal dance background, you will become frustrated in attempting to follow  the dance-based moves.  Not all the tape is danced based, but two of the  three sections are, and that's too much for this non-dancer to  handle.
The tape claims to be broken down into four sessions, but it is  really three, as the last two of the claimed four are blended into one  session.  The Warm-Up Conditioning (15 minutes) is an okay segment.  There  are some simple ballet-inspired moves which are not difficult to master  after 3-4 run thrus (that's provided you don't get frustrated!) This  session can be used as a quick warm-up to start your day, or to start your  other workout, let's say if you were to go running for example, you can  start out with this.
The second segment of aerobic cross training lasting  for 30 minutes was the most frustrating.  Now this is where all those dance  classes come in handy.  If you haven't taken any dance classes, well then,  you're S.O.L.!  Within the first 60 seconds, I kid you not, I was lost in  uncoordination land with no hope of ever being found.  Even after rewinding  the tape and running in slo-mo, I STILL couldn't get what she was doing.  So I faked it for most of the workout, which I found to be most  unsatisfying.  There are some decent toning/sculpting moves with free  weights that are interlaced with the dance stuff, but after awhile, it  became annoying to fast forward thru the dance segments to get to these  toning segments.
The last 40 minutes of the tape is Jennifer Kries  herself....aaaaaah, finally relief.  This is the classic Method, abdominal  based workout, it's very similar to Precision Toning, although there are  some slight variations.  You use a bar in this one (a broomstick or  mopstick will suffice) which gives you incredible deep stretching.  At this  point, this is the only part of the tape that I use, hence the two  stars.
As stated in my title, if you like Jennifer Kries, this is not the  tape for you.  You're better off doing precision toning.
Now if you're a  dancer, this is probably more up your alley and according to what others  are saying, it will probably be helpful for you.",957225600,39,2573,4.674157303370786
1715657,5,B000067J06,"As workouts seem to get shorter and shorter in response to everyone's increasingly chaotic lives, it is a real pleasure to do this workout on a rare day when there is time.  Nice, mostly simple (not necessarily easy) stuff, heart rate steadily high through the middle section, good simple upper body section.  My living room is too cramped to do justice to the dance intervals unfortunately but they are a pleasure to do anyway.  Using a weighted bar in the final section meant I finally for the first time managed to do Pilates rollups and Teasers in decent form, very satisfying.",1326153600,,581,4.732673267326732
1715658,4,B000067J06,"I love this workout because this program divided into 3 different segments by 3 different insructors so that you won't get bored with it. In one and a half hours you'll get yoga,a cross training of dance movement aerobic, weight lifting, and abdominal excersize. It is a ONE COMPLETE WORKOUT. I highly recommend especially to anyone who plays Golf, Baseball, Rowing or Tennis. I am sure it works well with any other sport too. It supports and repairs your body. There are a couple errors the instructors make, but it is still the best workout DVD I've had. A big thank you to all at The Method.",1292630400,2,594,4.5607476635514015
1715659,5,B000067J06,"This is my ""go to"" workout that really did help me lose 30 pounds over several months back in 2000.  At first, I could not even get through the warm-up (seriously!).  I just did as much as I could, and each day I got stronger and was able to finish more of the workout.  Once I had the warm-up mastered, I began adding the cardio segment (it was sooooo hard for me at first).  I did not use the weights for the first couple of weeks...I just did the motions without them!  I began adding weights as I got stronger, and I ended up with nice muscle definition in my arms.  The ending pilates segment is hard...but it gives great results.

I love using my Wii to workout, and I mix it up with other videos as well.  However, I always come back to this workout because it is fun to do and gives me results!

I reveiwed this years ago when I still used this workout on my VHS tape!  Here was my review then:
This tape lives up to its name...You get a stretching/warm up segment that uses ballet movement and other basic stretching. Followed by a cardio routine that mixes in weights (great for toning arms...regular pilates sometimes misses the arms), followed by an EXCELLENT pilates segment. You can even break the segments up and just do the warm up/cardio one day and the warm up/pilates the next day. Try this video! You won't be dissapointed!",1263859200,,1343,4.357429718875502
1715660,4,B000067J06,"Give this one a chance!

Even if you're in good shape, if you're not used to dancing, this workout video can be tough, but it's worth it! A graceful, total-body, interval training that involves light weights to challenge the muscles, combined with dance segments that enhance flexibility and build coordination.

As with all videos, and especially with dance workouts, it's a good idea to watch it all the way through one time, then try it casually once before committing to the workout all-out.

I'm schooled in the ""old"" style technique of weight lifting that concentrates on one muscle group at a time, but the newest sculpting trend is to multi-task. This workout does that! I've done this workout every other day this week, alternating the warm-up and cross-training segments and the Pilates segment on non-consecutive days, to allow the muscles to have a day of rest in-between.

WARM-UP SEGMENT: The complaint that the warm-up is long is valid - it is. But it also gets the body ready for the weight/dance segment.
CROSS-TRAINING SEGMENT: The interval workout will, as mentioned above, develop coordination and stamina, as well as challenging the muscles with light weights, that use gravity to force you to control the movement. Starting off with weights early in the workout gets the metabolism to fire up faster, according to new studies.
CENTERING SEGMENT: This is a great Pilates workout! They suggests using a Method weight bar, but you can use a broom, as they suggest, or a rope. Helpful modifications are included for beginner, intermediate and advanced levels of fitness and core strength.

All segments work on strengthening the back to better support the rest of the body, improve posture and, again, coordination, build lean muscle, and burn fat & calories. The instructors are pretty good about explaining what they're doing, and how to perform the moves properly, to reduce the risk of injury.

The only thing missing? A good stretch at the end that relaxes all the muscles, especially the hard-working ones in the arms!",1257292800,,2042,5.0266272189349115
1715661,3,B000067J06,"I did this video for years before I got into Rael Pilates, it is good, but if you are going to spend your money for Pilates buy Rael pilates.",1228089600,,141,3.896551724137931
1715662,1,B000067J06,"The instruction for the cardio of this workout is poor, poor, poor! The instructor first tells you how to do a very simple move, then says, ""Let's pick up the pace, now we're going to change the feet a little,"" changing the move to something completely different, at a higher tempo, with arms, kicks, etc. put in, then suddenly, when you think you've got the hang of it, she stops. I just stopped IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS WORKOUT to type this review, because it was that frustrating. Perhaps people with a dance background will like this video as they use dance terms ""first position,"" ""second position,"" ""plie,"" etc. all over the place, very quickly. I agree with other reviewers saying there is no warning on when the movements will change, they just suddenly do as you're in the middle of it...I found myself pausing to figure out the moves, only to have them change twenty seconds later, which would result in pausing again - this is not a continuous workout stopping any benefit I would have from a continuous workout. This starting/stopping is due to the confusing nature of the instruction - really, if you want a pilates workout, go with somebody else - Maggie Rhoade's pilates or Denise Austin's - anything but this. What a waste. Now I'm going to go back and do another workout that was actually made for people follow.",1218931200,3,1326,4.646808510638298
1715663,4,B000067J06,"The Warm Up is okay and the Pilates section is challenging in a good way.

I have to disagree with the other reviewers who did not like the Cross Training segment. In fact, it's the part of the video that I use the most. Of course, during my first viewing of the entire video, I didn't try to *do* anything. I watched and tried to remember exactly what was going on, the moves, etc. This is what I do with all of my workout videos. The first few times of actually trying the aerobics segments were a bit hard and it took some rewinding and redoing to get the moves down pat, but I now have no problems with it. I have a space that is an approximate 5-6 foot square. I have no formal dance training. And I'm quite frankly surprised by the reviews here.",1190851200,,751,4.1438356164383565
1715664,1,B000067J06,"Despite some really good core-strengthening moves, the choreography in this video just makes you feel ridiculous.  They ruined what could have been a good workout with boring, repetitive bongos and moves that just make you fling yourself around the room.  If you don't have lots of space, forget it.",1177459200,2,299,5.081632653061225
1715665,3,B000067J06,"The warm-up segment of this video is fun and effective. The mat work, while I found it difficult at first, by sticking with it, did really strengthen my abdominal core and yield results.

HOWEVER, I have to agree with the other reviewers regarding the aerobics segment. I also found it incredibly frustrating; I tried over and over again to ""catch on,"" but I never did. Now I do the warm-up and mat work, and skip over the cross-training section and instead, do some other video or exercise for my aerobic workout.",1155600000,2,514,4.648351648351649
1715666,2,B000067J06,"Like some of the other reviewers, I found this DVD frustrating & disappointing.

Warm-up: Pretty basic; nothing special but does what it intends to do.

Cross-training: This part consists of both dance moves & weight training segments.  I agree with others who said the dance part is nuts!  It is so frustrating - just when I think I have the hang of a move, it changes.  The instructor is not helpful; I have to concentrate so hard keeping up with the moves that I don't feel I get a good workout at all.  I have tried this several times & only made it through the whole thing about 3 times...I usually end up turning it off & switching to another video out of frustration.

On the other hand, the weight training segments are pretty good & the only reason I ever attempt this section.

Pilates matwork: Jennifer Kries is a great instructor & this is a challenging workout.  However, it gets repetitious because the routine is run through once, and then repeated with the bar.

If you're looking for an effective and unique pilates workout, I recommend Jennifer Kries' ""New Method: 3 Dimensional Toning"" instead, which incorporates dance, yoga, and Pilates.",1151020800,4,1158,4.7164179104477615
1715699,4,B000067J06,"I got this one for so cheap that it doesn't matter to me how great it is, but it really was surprisingly a good workout. I like the length of it.  It is a little tough to follow the dance routine in the middle, but you just have to be brave enough to keep trying and to keep doing the workout video.  I love the last pilates section.  The stretching segment is a great way to end a workout...I just like how this video actually includes everything you SHOULD do for a well-rounded workout.",1127520000,2,489,4.180851063829787
1715700,1,B000067J06,"I love working out to videos, but as has been said by other reviewers, the cardio portion (which is a major part of my workouts) is terrible: there is no time taken to instruct on the dance moves, the steps change without warning.  I get irritated within the first 3 minutes of the cardio and turn the video off in disgust, with only the 15 minute warmup under my belt for a work out.  I have come back to this video every year, to determine whether I just gave up too easily, and the same outcome occurs.  The warmup is good, the pilates part is pretty challenging, and the stretch at the end is nice, but without the cardio, I just don't feel like I've had a workout.",1125878400,4,669,4.2109375
1715701,2,B000067J06,"I bought this video thinking I was going to get a killer workout that emphasized all the thing I enjoyed dance,streching, weights. This was not it, the tempo of the video was slow, the instructers were not engaging.  This video just did not hold my interest enough to want to do it on a regular basis. In fact I traded this video in at a local video trade store.  However I would recommend THE METHOD DANCE TO FITNESS.",1120780800,,418,4.346153846153846
1715702,2,B000067J06,"I love to work out; I enjoy dance and pilates. BUT--

this video was not for me.

I liked the weight segments but the dance ones are only good if you have a LOT of room in your living room to travel (otherwise you must compromise the moves). Also, the dance moves are awkward and dorky, not fun or fluid.",1108684800,4,304,4.05
1715703,2,B000067J06,"As a special education teacher, I really appreciate when workout videos demonstrate quality instruction.  If you have never had any formal dance training, skip this video.  Not only are the steps complicated and hard to follow, but the cueing is poor.  The instructors offer little guidance on how to perform the steps properly, nor do they warn viewers when the steps change.  I am not the most coordinated person on the planet, but I like to challenge myself.  However, I gave up on the cardio portion of the workout after 3 or 4 attempts.  It's hard to get through without falling down!  Negatives aside, I do enjoy the warm-up portion of the tape, which is only 15 minutes long.  I do that on days when I don't want to do a heavy workout or to add some stretching after jogging or a session on the elliptical trainer.  During the warm-up section, the moves are not complicated and are quite fun. The live drummers in the background are a refreshing change from most generic workout video music.  For me, this video is not worth the price given that I find only the first 15 minutes are actually useful.",1106006400,8,1106,4.568527918781726
1715704,5,B000067J06,"In-between whipping up magic in the kitchen (cooking), keeping your life organized (cleaning, errands), securing a paycheck (work), and making everyone happy (family responsibilities), it may sometimes feel like you are much less than an exercise goddess. After all, who has 90 minutes to exercise?

My solution has been to make time to escape to the workout room. I've found that I can get more done because of the increase in energy. So, technically, I don't have time ""not"" to exercise.

Once I start the ""All in One"" workout, I know I am going to feel like a goddess, move like a dancer and feel like I really did work every muscle group in my entire body.

The precise movements in this video do take time to master, yet are fun and creative. With three instructors and constantly changing exercises, you will never be bored. You will in fact experience a new dimension in total physical conditioning. A combination of yoga, T'AI Chi, classical and aerobic dance, and exercises inspired by Joseph Pilates will encourage the integration of the entire body.

You will also find yourself feeling more balanced. Of all the workout videos I have tried, this one excels in developing balance. Improving strength, endurance, suppleness and flexibility are also included in the game plan.

There are three sections or if you add ""lengthening,"" there are four sections.

1. Warm-Up Conditioning is an innovative variety of dance-based movements to firm every major muscle group. This is one of my favorite segments and is 15 minutes.

2. Aerobic Cross-Training (30 minutes) warms your body to fat burning intensity. You alternate between aerobic dance and weight exercises which are not overly challenging, but seem to work well.

3. Centering Makeover (35 minutes) helps you to become more aware of your body's center of energy, balance and strength. It encourages good posture, balance and poise. The anti-gravity techniques help to defy aging.

4. Lengthening (10 minutes) is a cool-down segment, which is reminiscent of yoga. I would have enjoyed another 10 minutes in this section if it had included more yoga stretching. At this point, I was not going anywhere and was flat on the floor anyway! This is a tough workout, but you will love the challenge.

Overall, you will enjoy the variety. The dance segments evoke a ""from the beginning of the earth"" tribal feel (drums alternate with a more Jazzy track) and make you feel centered. The footwork is challenging at first.

If you keep your feet moving you can work your way past the more complex routines which are not that complex on your third use of this video. They are actually quite fun and the dance is alternated with weights so you get a break from the dance segment to catch your breath. The dance steps do demand your full attention.

I rate this an intermediate to advanced workout. If you have been walking on a treadmill a few times a week, you will have no problem completing the 90 minutes.

Jennifer Kries makes her appearance in the beginning and end of this video. If anyone is a fitness goddess, she is! Soon after she begins instructing you in the Method Techniques, you will realize why. She also seems to have a subtle humor and enjoys encouraging you to push your limits. I especially enjoy the Method workouts when she is the instructor. All the instructors in this video are easy to listen to and inspire you to keep going.

I give this my highest recommendation for all over body conditioning and enjoyment. I am very picky about workout videos, so you know this one is going to be good! The dancing in this video will really make you feel like a goddess and you don't have to have a perfect figure. Dance away and enjoy life, that is what is important!

1715706,4,B000067J06,"AFter I gave birth to my daughter I had some extra weight to lose. I have been going to yoga classes on and off for two years but I had never tried pilates before, so I got this workout dvd and decided to give it a try.
Starts off with 15 minutes of warm-up conditioning (basic stretch movements).
Next is 30 minutes of aerobic cross training to burn fat and firm major muscle groups.
Centering Makeover - 35 minutes of abdominal and back exercises that I think really do work.
Lengthening - a 10 minute cool down to stretch all the muscles out again to keep you from cramping and from bulking up.
I thought the warm-up was very basic and as extensive as it should have been for the exercises that follow.
I hate aerobic exercise, but realize that it's part of losing weight... the 30 minutes of dancing around isn't exactly my favorite, but it's not bad. Every once in a while I have to walk in place to take a breather.
The Centering work out is difficult. Luckily I've had the yoga training, but even I wasn't able to do everything so I don't know how someone with no dance/pilates/yoga experience would be able to pull this off. NOT for beginners! You will be discouraged and annoyed -or even hurt yourself!- with this and never use it again if you are not in good shape.
I kept up with it, though, and gradually got better. I lost 13 pounds and three and a half inches by doing pilates and barely cutting down my calorie intake in about three months time (I did the pilates work out 4-5 times a week). So it definitely does work. It's just extremely difficult. Even after three months of doing it almost daily, I still have trouble with the moves.
The strength training part with 3-5 lb weights is pretty good if you're looking to tone but not bulk up. I don't like looking bulky, I just like not having that extra flap of skin hanging under my arms!! So this workout is pretty good for that.
I'm giving it four stars because it succeeded in helping me lose the weight that I wanted to lose. It's great for your abs and back strengthening. Picking my daughter up all the time really does a job on my back, so these exercises help with it a lot. I didn't give it five stars because of how difficult it is and it can get boring if you're planning on doing this video all the time.",1069718400,13,2283,4.299303944315545

BOO - Its an okay tape, kind of fun and different but if you are expecting PILATES this is not it.  There is a ""pilates"" section which is kind of lacking but it over its a decent workout.  I'm all left feet but the dance segment is fun.  DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE TITLE.  Its supposed to be a cross training total body but there is too much focus on the arms and not enough on the legs.

They seem to have stuck pilates in the title because they thought it would help sell the tape. It's basically a series of dance routines intermingled with weight work (the weight work was actually the only part of the tape I enjoyed), followed by some exceptionally easy abdominal pilates. Which is fine if that's what you are after, but don't think this will give you ANY idea of what pilates actually is. I am an avid pilates fan and since my instructor takes a break during the summer I thought I would purchase a video to get me through the next three months. I didn't mind the thought of some aerobics to spice things up, but even that was a great disappointment. I felt like I was at a dance class and if you've never taken any dance classes you will be flailing wildly throughout half the tape. There is no instruction on the dance moves. They quickly show you the first portion and then fly into a series of moves you might see at a dance tryout. To make matters worse, the 35 minutes of Abdonminal Centering (pilates) and the 10 minutes of Lengthening was actually joined together for a total of only 30 minutes. Also, I hate tapes that plug other equipment (for sale separately of course) to be incorporated into the routine. You don't need bars or any other gimicks for a true workout. It's just extra money in the pockets of the video makers. They don't even mention you will need the bar until you're 45 minutes into the tape. For that matter, they never mention you will need weights either. All in all there are far better tapes out there for aerobics and judging by the reviews I've read, much better pilates tapes as well.

I admit the weight interval segments will challenge you if you use a relative amount of resistance, but I don't think it will be what you're expecting. Keep in mind that in order for videos to sell they have to appeal to the average American. If you're into relaxing and deep breathing you will like it. If you're into an intense, muscle toning workout I doubt you will.",1051315200,,630,4.3474576271186445
1715741,5,B000067J06,"I like workouts that include the abdomen, because there is nothing better than the feeling, later, of being able to perform daily tasks with the centered energy that comes from the abdomen.  Currently I am responsible for taking care of an aged parent and when one is able to respond with vigor to at times querulous demands this maintains one's mood and center.
However, those workouts that include the abdomen usually are extremely difficult.  The best tape on this I used before this DVD was the old Jane Challenge workout and the ab section of Jane's tape is beastly hard.
By incorporating stress on the center of the body throughout the workout, The Method Pilates avoids the problem of Jane Challenge, which for me is that you spend the entire workout before the ab section wondering if you're going to make it through the ""crunch"" time.
The only downside about The Method Pilates is the absence of hard aerobic training and for best results I think you should keep on running if you indeed run while using this tape.
Do not be discouraged if you cannot, the first time, accomplish the flagship pose of Pilates, which is legs and arms straight up with the tummy doing all the work.  Be amused instead of you end up arse over tip.  Either counsel your loved ones to treat your workout space as private and to consider you, when working out, to be as the dancing elephant in Africa, a sight not fit for mortal eyes.
Or, as I did when residing with my ex-wife and son, counsel them that you look stupid when you work out and ask their permission.
Men should dance.  A network administrator at the World Trade Center who died was profiled in the New York Times was studying ballet because he and his wife expected grandchildren and he wanted to be able to chase after them and pick them up (ab work really helps in herding children, at Disneyland or in the park.)

She could never teach anyone to dance with her instructions. Its also not too challenging and what is up with her always looking down at the cuers who obviously are off. I hate it when someone says the last something or other and then its not also. I also agree that the ab section is good but is wasted in this video.

1715743,4,B000067J06,"As a newcomer to Pilates, I found this DVD to be entertaining as well as a good workout.  I also found that Pilates is helping strengthen my easily-injured back.  On this DVD (my first and only Pilates DVD), the instructions, when combined with the video, are usually quite good, though some better verbal descriptions of some of the movements would have been helpful. There are times when the instructor tells you to make sure to look straight ahead for a movement, or at your belly button, but doesn't provide enough verbal cuing for you to continue the excercise as she does.  There are also several segments where the demonstrators are confused about how to do a movement, and until the camera shifts back to the instructor, it's unclear how to do that movement.  Once you've been through the dvd a few times you figure it out, but one would wish for more careful editing and more practice from the producers before they release the dvd.
The dance segments are fun and the weights introduced in the cross-training segment a nice change (and a good introduction to using light weights). I've found that doing the warmup + cross-training one day and warmup + centering the alternating day makes it very easy to fit excercise into my busy schedule, and the variety is welcome too.",1042243200,11,1281,4.7309417040358746
1715744,5,B000067J06,"This should banish any perception that all ThePageTurner does is sit on her patootie and read. I look forward to doing this tape--so much, in fact, that I have bought the whole Method series and mix and match workouts every day. I have never found any workout I enjoy as much, or which provides such nice results.
Therefore you can imagine my surprise at all the negative reviews for this tape. Yes, there are several miscues that should have been re-shot. However, they will not throw anyone doing the routine off after the first time through. Although there is no yoga in this series, the workout reminds me of yoga in that the more you do it, the more you realize have to learn.
The first part, the warm-up, is easy to follow with excellent concentration on expanding and contracting your center. The second section is a dance segment with weight training interspersed. It will take you several times to get the routine down, but I stuck with it because it is just plain fun to do and you feel great afterward. The last part is abdominal work-the first abdominal routine I have been able to do without hurting my neck.
There's a draped, faux-classical set and these hip drums accompanying the dancers. The instructors are likeable, and you will walk taller and feel more elegant in your movements after a few go-rounds with the All-in-One Workout. I also like the Method Target Specifics tape, but I must confess that some of the sinuous movements in the All-in-One make this tape my favorite.",1037750400,3,1496,4.692015209125476
1715745,4,B000067J06,"This is a great DVD for those who are looking for a combination of cardiovascular, strength-training, and flexibility.  There are three segments, each working a different area.  It's vigorous, and hard to keep up with the first time through.  But, as your strength and flexibility improve, you'll find it easier with time.  I've tried several of the videos featuring Jennifer Kreis, and they are a great step up from the easier videos if you're wanting more of a challenge.  I would highly recommend this video.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I had some difficultly keeping up with everything, and the drummers in the background are kinda cheesy!",1025136000,2,669,4.876106194690266
1715746,1,B000067J06,"I have several of The Method videos and have been very happy with their overall content, instruction and quality. This All in One video, on the other hand, is the worst video I've ever seen in my life.  I can't believe that all reviewers didn't give this  a low rating.  The warm-up is long and reasonably delivered but the second segment's instructor is horrible.  She (I don't remember her name) continually miscues and misguides both the viewer and the video participants.  I'm quite co-ordinated and the steps weren't difficult but I found following this instructor to be very annoying.  What I found most annoying was the fact this video has so many production errors in it and it was still released. I've done the video twice and really do think it's the worst one I have seen. I felt cheated to be honest - I wasted 90 minutes and still didn't get much of a workout.  Jennifer Kries's segment is fine but you can get the same work out in one of her other tapes.

1715747,1,B000067J06,"I'm not sure why the word ""Pilates"" is in the title as this video has very little to do with Pilates.  I am not familiar with the terminology and movements used in yoga, ballet and classical dance so I had a hard time following the instructor and there is very little instruction on correct form.  The abs section is the only slightly redeeming portion of the tape.

I  was too busy trying to follow (keep up!) with the steps to enjoy the workout. And its sooooo long. I usually have 30 minutes a day to workout, and this video has no shortcuts, or at least a quick routine for every other day.

1715829,1,B000067J06,"I have been working out for 7 years.  In that time I have never found a exercise video so poorly made as this one.  The instruction is almost non-existent.  The tape is catered to people with ""hard"" bodies.  Many of the moves required for the toning segment require that you be extremely flexible and in excellent shape to perform the moves.  The modifications given for beginners are NOT for beginners but for people in A- shape.  I have never felt so inadequate doing a tape before.  They should take a lesson from Kathy Smith.",994982400,4,529,4.5638297872340425
1715830,5,B000067J06,"I have needed to add some cardio to my current pilates and yoga routine for quite some time.  Having tried all of the Method Precision tapes ( and enjoyed them immensely ) I was thrilled when I saw this for sale at my local video store.
The Method workouts will appeal to you if, like me, you are annoyed to the point of distraction by yelping side dancers, bad 80's synth versions of disco classics, and instructors that chirp happily like chipmunks throughout. ( Considering how many complaints of this sort I read in reviews of exercise tapes, it's downright shocking that nothing appears to change in this area of production.  I can only assume it's genetic. )
This particular tape is everything it represents.  When the music began, it was acoustic guitar, with sort of a poppy, flamenco thing happening, and I thought ""Cool!  Gypsy Kings!""  Alas, it was not, but rather some folks with drums and a guitar, awkwardly assembled at the back of the room.  That is the largest complaint I have about this video.  It was just a bit too world beat for my taste.  Still a great improvement over the norm.
The instructor in the first segment is marvelous, detailed and takes you through a warm up stage, carefully explaining movement along the way.  I wish I could say the same about the second instructor, but what she lacks in teaching ability she makes up for with some truly phenomenal, highly unusual weight work. As far as the Jennifer Kries section went, the focus is clearly on that famous Pilates core strenghtening.  I was rather surprised that certain basic ( leg circles, etc. ) exercises were not included here, but they probably felt that hip work had already been sufficiently addressed during the initial warm up and subsequent dance routines.  WARNING: the uncoordinated will have a tough time during section two, as there is little instruction, and hardcore aerobics folks won't find it challenging.  Also, if you are a Yoga fan, and hope to find that here, you will be disappointed.  Other than a variation on the Warrior in the dance segment, a few lunge variations and the obligatory Child's Pose to stretch out the lower back in the Pilates one - there is no Yoga on this tape.
That being said, If you are looking for a well-rounded, sophisticated tape to balance out an intermediate level program, this is a nice choice.",985824000,8,2340,4.705882352941177
1715831,2,B000067J06,"I have heard so much about pilates and was very excited about buying this tape.  My excitement was short lived.  I found the routines extremely hard to follow. There were several times in the second segment that the instructor did moves that were never properly explained. If you are not a dancer and don't aspire to be one, consider another pilates tape.",985478400,3,355,4.709677419354839
1715832,5,B000067J06,"My first experience with The Method workouts was Dance to Fitness, which dealt solely with dance and dance techniques.  This video incorporates the full bodied workout of classic dancing and adds integral weight toning and an abs workout.
As with most of The Method workouts I've seen, All in One Workout works more muscles without jolting or jarring of the joints than most aerobic videos out there.  I've tried various aerobic, toning and isolation (buns, abs, arms) videos and The Method videos, in general, are more fun and work more muscles, especially in the torso, including lower and upper back, the whole abdominal range from lower to upper to obloquies, and upper chest muscles.
The warm up is a combination of basic dance exercises and stretches.  It warms up most muscles in the body, from toes to neck, and becomes more intense with greater flexibility.
The dance section combines small basic movements together to form larger patterns of dance, and the weight portion does basic exercises with slightly different positions than typical for a greater workout.
The centering section is a good intense abs workout with a lot of attention placed on the often overlooked lower abs.  The instructors use a stick for the second half of the workout, but use is optional.  This section requires more strength and flexibility that the first two sections, but it is easier over time.
I'd definitely recommend the warm up section to a beginner thinking of using more of The Method videos.  The instructor explains all of the exercises and details correct posture during them.
The second section is more complicated, requiring more muscular strength and coordination, but barring weird camera angles during a couple of exercises was easily got through on the 3rd or 4th time using the tape (I've had limited dance training, so that may have assisted me in the following along).  It is not as aerobically intense as most aerobic videos, but it does work through more muscles than the average video, with less jolting and jarring.
The final section (since they apparently left off the lengthening on my copy) is down right hard for me, not because it is confusing or complicated, but because it is very intense.  I would recommend this section anyone who wants a flat stomach, regardless of how in shape they are.  It will be more difficult to beginners, but there are some lower intensity options included, and even advanced people will benefit, especially the lower abdominal exercises.
It is a long tape, and I usually do the warm up followed by one of the other sections.  If you like dancing, try Dance to Fitness, and if you liked the sculpting try Precision Sculpting or Toning, but if you want both in one tape, this is a nice tape.",983491200,13,2739,4.870967741935484
1715833,5,B000067J06,"In-between whipping up magic in the kitchen (cooking), keeping your life organized (cleaning, errands), securing a paycheck (work), and making everyone happy (family responsibilities), it may sometimes feel like you are much less than an exercise goddess. After all, who has an extra hour, let alone 90 minutes to exercise?

My solution has been to wake up at 6am, make my husband breakfast and then while the world is still nice and quite, I escape to the workout room. Once I start the ""All in One"" workout, I know I am going to feel like a goddess, move like a dancer and feel like I really did work every muscle group in my entire body.

The precise movements in this video do take time to master, yet are fun and creative. With three instructors and constantly changing exercises, you will never be bored. You will in fact experience a new dimension in total physical conditioning. A combination of yoga, T'AI Chi, classical and aerobic dance, and exercises inspired by Joseph Pilates will encourage the integration of the entire body.

You will also find yourself feeling more balanced. Of all the workout videos I have tried, this one excels in developing balance. Improving strength, endurance, suppleness and flexibility are also included in the game plan.

There are three sections or if you add ""lengthening,"" there are four sections. Warm-Up Conditioning is an innovative variety of dance-based movements to firm every major muscle group. This is one of my favorite segments and is 15 minutes. Aerobic Cross-Training (30 minutes) warms your body to fat burning intensity. You alternate between aerobic dance and weight exercises which are not overly challenging, but seem to work well. Centering Makeover (35 minutes) helps you to become more aware of your body's center of energy, balance and strength. It encourages good posture, balance and poise. The anti-gravity techniques help to defy aging. Lengthening (10 minutes) is a cool-down segment, which is reminiscent of yoga. I would have enjoyed another 10 minutes in this section if it had included more yoga stretching. At this point, I was not going anywhere and was flat on the floor anyway! This is a tough workout, but you will love the challenge.

Overall, you will enjoy the variety. The dance segments evoke a ""from the beginning of the earth"" tribal feel (music is unique..drums alternate with a more Jazzy track) and make you feel centered. The footwork is challenging at first. If you keep your feet moving you can work your way past the more complex routines which are not that complex on your third use of this video. They are actually quite fun and the dance is alternated with weights so you get a break from the dance segment to catch your breath. The dance steps do demand your full attention. I rate this a medium to advanced workout. If you have been walking on a treadmill a few times a week, you will have no problem completing the 90 minutes.

Jennifer Kries makes her appearance in the beginning and end of this video. If anyone is a fitness goddess, she it! Soon after she begins instructing you in the Method Techniques, you will realize why. She also seems to have a subtle humor and enjoys encouraging you to push your limits. I especially enjoy the Method workouts when she is the instructor. All the instructors in this video are easy to listen to and inspire you to keep going.

I give this my highest recommendation for all over body conditioning and enjoyment. I am very picky about workout videos, so you know this one is going to be good! The dancing in this video will really make you feel like a goddess and you don't have to have a perfect figure. Dance away and enjoy life, that is what is important!

1715834,4,B000067J06,"This is a great workout.  After doing this workout, I naturally move with  grace, my posture is excellent and comfortable.  It is more significant  than with any other workout I have done besides Yoga.  This tape includes a  comparatively long warm-up - a workout in itself that will challenge your  balance!  It is a dancer's warm-up, significant time is allotted to warming  up the feet and ankles.
I love the music - those drums are so soothing  and they make you want to move!
After the warm-up, you begin to move  through several dance segments.  The steps may be challenging at first, but  they are easy to learn, and fun.  The movement tends to be more fluid than  in your standard workout videos.
Interspersed with this are several  weight-training segments.  In these segments, the leader is very effective  in encouraging me to lift and lower the weights to the greatest benefit.  Some of these movements are challenging, and I have to admit I haven't  still been strong enough by the end of the video to do the last  weight-training segment - my arms get tired!
The final segment is  probably the best for your posture - the abdominals and centering segment.  Man that's super!  I HATE doing crunches with a passion, but I love doing  these movements and I think they work better.
To do this workout, you  will need handweights - standard 3-5 pounds.  There is also some moves in  the abdominal section that encourage the use of a stick (a broomhandle is  suggested) but I have never used one yet, it's optional.  The dance  segments require some space, but not more than the standard cardio video.
It is low-impact (fine for those ailing bodies!) and can be moderately  modified to fit your own needs.
I highly recommend this video to people  looking for a graceful, almost ballet-ish approach to exercise and toning,  with use of Pilates and yoga and mental focus.  This tape is definitely  more ""nomads, indians, and saints"" than hip-hop or rock-n-roll.",969148800,46,1967,4.75

It may take them  a bit longer to learn, but I think that the effort will be worth the  results. This exercise video is among my favorites along with The Method:  Dance to Fitness. The only reason I gave it four stars is that it is a bit  too long to fit into a busy day.",967507200,6,615,4.033057851239669
1715836,2,B000067J06,"I personally cannot stand this tape.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because the arms and abs workouts are decent.  The cover of this video says ""All in One Workout for Fat Reduction.""  Very misleading.  I  expected a really good mix of routines and intensities...and while,  admittedly, there IS variety in this tape [it'd be hard NOT to include  variety in a video as long as this!]...the cardio absolutely fell FLAT.  I  didn't even come near breaking a sweat.  I work out frequently [4-7 days a  week] and HARD and I will be the first to confess I'm awkward and  uncoordinated...But this video leads you to believe it's for everyone and  it AIN'T, folks!  I find it intimidating and for the flexibility-elite.  Not for the gracefully-challenged like moi!  The music was so quiet you  could snooze for an hour and a half, and the instructors so mellow as to be  totally uninspiring [I don't need a cheerleading section to motivate me but  this was ridiculous], ...The ab routine at the end was extraordinarily  difficult, if done correctly, and Jennifer Kries [a very likeable  personality, I'll give her that] expects you to already have a certain  flexibility level to get the full benefits.  This sounds weird but the ab  routine in this always leaves me mildly nauseated so I've pretty much quit  doing this workout altogether, although I will do it once in a blue moon to  add variety into my already diverse routines.  Good, I suppose, for  dancers, coordinated people, and flexible folks who like artsy over  routine...But this one's not for me.",960508800,27,1563,4.7706766917293235
1715837,4,B000067J06,"Not your ususual workout, and MUCH more difficult than it appears at first!  The workout's length is probably too daunting for the time challenged (90 minutes!). I do the warm up and then alternate sections 2  and 3 on different days.  The set looks great, and the drummed music is a  wonderfully refreshing alternative to cheesy ""disco"" workout  music. The instructors give clear directions, but if you're like me and you  can't dance, it will take you several tries to master some of the dance  moves.  Keep trying, it's fun when you finally ""get it"".  The  abdominal ""centering"" is quite difficult - there were exercises  like the ""Teaser"", where Jennifer Kries and the incredibly fit  people around her were happily lifting their torsos off the floor while I  lay there like a turtle on its back, unable to sit up. You can do crunches  from now 'til next year and think you're working your abs, but this workout  is using muscles you won't touch doing crunches.  Very cool.",959126400,88,977,4.726190476190476
