He does so in the hope of meeting the guest-of-honor, a writer named Brigit O'Donnell whose work has meant a great deal to him.  Vincent and Brigit hit it off quite  well, ""escape"" the party, and movingly communicate about the  things that are very important to them.  They do run into Catherine along  the way.  Some bad folks are after Brigit, and the episode mixes gritty  violence with romantic elements.  It is a powerful episode, and Brigit  O'Donnell is one of the most compelling guest characters the series ever  created.  There is a beautiful romantic finish between Vincent and  Catherine.
In 1998 I conducted a poll among Beauty and the Beast fans  asking them to rate the 44 episodes of the first two seasons on a 1-to-10  scale.  31 fans participated.  ""Masques"" finished 5th out of the  44 episodes.
I placed ""Masques"" 6th in my own personal  1-through-44 rank-ordering of the episodes.",916531200,24,958,4.875

There, Catherine sees  him, and follows he and Bridgit when they leave, which sets in motion a  chain of events both despairing and enheartening.",915408000,4,324,4.8545454545454545
