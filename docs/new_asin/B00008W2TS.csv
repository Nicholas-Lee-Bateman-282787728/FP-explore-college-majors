7987465,5,B00008W2TS,"Bulldog Drummond movies are almost as good as the old Charlie Chan movies and I have them all. This one is close to the best one I have ever seen. There are only three Bulldog Drummond movies I didn't care for. The rest are very good and it is sometimes difficult to say which is the best, but that is a good problem to have when there are so many bad pictures out there. This one is full of great action and has a wonderful plot. The acting is the best and the picture and sound is very good. If you like Bulldog Drummond you will want this one to add to your collectin.",1415232000,4,571,4.017543859649122
7987466,3,B00008W2TS,"Bulldog Drummond in Africa, 1938 film

The story begins with a view of Parliament and Big Ben in London at night. Hugh Drummond inspects a stamp. Hugh and Tenny are confined to their home to keep them out of trouble. Hugh calls Algy about the tickets and trousers. ""What'll I do?"" No telephone calls either. Richard Lane visits Colonel Neilson, he asks for secret information about a radio wave disintegrator. Phyllis Clavering sees Neilson carried out to a car! The butler gives a name: Richard Lane. Can they get to Hampton Heath to stop the airplane? No. The police order Hugh against flying. Will there be a trick? Yes. ""Welcome to Arbi"" in Spanish Morocco.

Recognize those people at the British Embassy? Mistaken identification? No, we see the villains. Will they plant a bomb on Hugh's airplane? Hugh returns to land, after this the bomb explodes! Tenny has a hidden pistol. ""Be careful!"" Lane questions Neilson. Is Neilson lying? Can he trust Lane? Hugh and Algy prowl around Lane's house. The threat from the lion is interrupted by gun shots. There is a struggle on the porch. One man falls, and the lion attacks him! A gruesome death. The last scene shows the heroes returning on an airplane flying home.

This low-budget drama seems more serious and better than the others. Will Hugh and Phyllis ever get married, or is that just a running joke?",1332028800,,1356,4.761702127659574
7987467,5,B00008W2TS,"Though H.C. Snapper McNeil's Bulldog Drummond can be traced all the way back to nitrate film of the silent era, certainly the most fun is derived from the ""B"" series, of which, ""Bulldog Drummond in Africa"" offers plenty. All the regulars fans of this series love return in this one, and it has tons of atmosphere augmented by humor and some nice pacing from director Louis King.

This incredibly entertaining outing has Bulldog (John Howard) once again being sidetracked on the eve of his wedding to Phyllis Clavering. Heather Angel gets ample screen time as Hugh's cute and fabulous girlfriend and shines like the African sun during midsummer.

The solid and stalwart Tenny (E.E. Clive) is at Bulldog's side while bumbling but loyal pal Algy (Reginald Denny) runs last second errands, desperately hoping no new adventure will arise to interfere with the nuptials. When Phyllis sees Colonel Nielson being kidnapped from Greystoke Manor by spy Richard Lane (J. Carrol Naish), however, the chase is on!

Just missing them as their plane takes off for Africa, an undaunted Bulldog, finally with pants Algy has been trying to deliver, grabs his own plane and takes to the skies. Phyllis has to stow away because Bulldog is trying to keep her out of harm's way; a cute circumstance which happens often in the film.

Once in Africa, our gang gets tangled up with crooked cops, most notably Lane's henchman, Deone Fordine, winningly portrayed by a young and dashing Anthony Quinn. Barely escaping a bomb planted on his plane, they race to rescue the Colonel from a lion in an exciting finish.

A fun tone, pleasant finale, and plenty of atmosphere make for one of the best entries in the series, and everything a good ""B"" is supposed to be. A must for Bulldog fans.",1270166400,3,1758,4.827242524916944
7987468,3,B00008W2TS,"This one is okay for it's genre. Nothing special but a good supporting cast including J. Carrol Naish, H.B. Warner and Anthony Quinn helps. A short running time of 58 minutes won't put you to sleep either. Originally a Paramount release, this is a Congress Films reissue or TV print (probably a dupe at that!)  and like most of Alpha's product, it leaves something to be desired. At least it looks like the source material was film rather than VHS tape. If you like the Bulldog Drummond series, you'll probably find this one entertaining.",1122076800,,538,4.723404255319149
7987469,5,B00008W2TS,"I enjoy all the Bulldog Drummond movies, no matter who is playing the lead, no matter who is playing the chief of police, Drummond's family friend.  His butler Tenny is worth the price of any of these films.
This particular film shocked me in that it takes Drummond and his crew to Morocco, which is portrayed as a sophisticated locale, and very European.  The European feel surprised me especially in comparison to other films made at this time which portray jungles with pitch black savages and rampaging wild animals.
If you are a fan of old black and white films, then you have probably heard of this series.  I recommend this film for collectors.",1075766400,10,651,4.692982456140351
