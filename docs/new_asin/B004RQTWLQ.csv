8439193,1,B004RQTWLQ,"I downloaded this video from my TiVo so I didn't have the benefit of Michael Cerda's review, but he hit all the right points, so I won't repeat them here.  Just that this video is terrible.  I would rate it negative ten stars if I could.

My primary impression was that it was a poorly produced video to show in class.  However, this video is so bad it will suck out any interest a student might have in science.  None of the content is memorable.  I just wanted the video to end.

This video is not of publishable quality and should be pulled from Amazon.",1338854400,2,556,4.238095238095238
8439194,1,B004RQTWLQ,"I was excited to see a video about bird evolution that covered discoveries of the last 10 years. However, this video looks like it was recorded by a cell phone inside public museums. The audio sounds like a text-to-speech program reading some high school student's term paper.
While the content is accurate and covers new theories the presentation leaves a lot to be desired.",1308873600,4,375,4.875
