1199446,5,B00000F06S,"I watched this movie when I was 21 years old while fighting in the war in Indonesia in 1946. A very moving experience, as a young man myself who was away from home ; fighting for my country. I had watched the film 3 times  and cried 2 of the times. My friends in my tank bergade called me  ""Foppe"".",940118400,,298,3.95
1199447,5,B00000F06S,"I was 11 years old when I saw this in a movie theater. I was so affected by these movie I vowed that I would go in the Navy as soon as they would have me. When I was 16, the Korean war broke out, and when I turned 17 that  fall, I did join the Navy. It was the best thing I ever did to prepare me  for the future, and I still thank the Sullivan family for setting a fine  example to a youngster.",932947200,3,395,3.5697674418604652
1199448,5,B00000F06S,"""The Fighting Sullivans"" is a moving tribute and true story of five brothers who served together on the same ship in WWII.  The story begins with the birth of each child (including one daughter) and then  continues on showing the close and loving relationships in the family  through the years.  There's one great scene where the father (Thomas  Mitchell, who was Scarlet's father in ""Gone With the Wind) teaches  some of the sons a lesson about smoking -- very funny! One of the sons  marries prior to the war and the movie shows some good old-fashioned  ""courting"" (kids today should see what courting is all about!).  This is a great movie for the whole family to see (as most movies were back  then) with great examples of family togetherness, wholesome values, and the  willingness of honorable men to do what is right even if this means that  they must ""pay the price"" as well. Even my daughters, when they  were young girls, loved this movie and still quote the line of the brother  who tells his family of the girl he wants them to meet and adds,  ""She's swell!"" This would be a great movie to see any time, but  especially on Memorial Day or Veterans Day when we remember those who  served and gave their all to protect and defend the United States of  America.",911865600,8,1270,4.54424778761062

1199482,4,B00000F06S,"This movie is based on a true story about one family with five brothers who served together on one ship in World War II.  I suppose the average viewer will be familiar with the story, but I do not wish to risk spoiling anything for a viewer.  All I can say is that World War II was very difficult time.

The movie was made during World War II and of course is very patriotic.  This is a movie wherein the story is more important than the cast.  Although based on a true story, the details of actual story is not completely accurately represented in the movie.  The movie is well made and is capable of evoking emotion.  I have watched it more than once and am very glad to know the story and have seen the movie.  Thank You...",1493078400,,726,4.172661870503597

1199542,5,B00000F06S,"This is one of those movies everyone should see.  It's a typical 1940's/1050's movie...lots of corny acting...""golly gee pa..."" and typical white picket fence family interactions.  But the ending, no matter how many times I see it, makes me tear up.  The way the director filmed the last few scenes makes it hard not to feel exactly what the parents, sister and wife are going through.  It's absolutely heart wrenching.  Something I don't believe I've ever experienced in a movie of that era.  I liked this movie so much that I went out of my way to visit the USS The Sullivans in Buffalo, NY.",1469577600,,593,4.6

It wasn't all about the war-it showed brothers growing up together and pranks that they pulled on each other and closeness that they shared, which is ultimately why they wanted to serve together.

I loved it, First because I could so easily relate to the boyhood activities of the Sullivan boys, and second, I found two scenes near the end of the movie so moving and heart wrenching that I never forgot them, and they explain why,so many years later, I have bought the DVD of the The Fighting Sullivans (always just The Sullivans in Australia). The scene in which Ward Bond as a naval officer, visits the Sullivan family home to break the tragic news has stood the test of time. To Mrs Sullivan's question ""Which one?"" the naval officer replies, &Auml;ll five."" A shattered Mr Sullivan then says he has to go to work;he has not missed a day in his job over many years as a freight conductor(In Australia he would have been a railway guard).  We know that the train he gets on will pass the tank stand where his five young children used to stand to wave to their father as the train passed by. This time, in 1942,the tank stand is empty, and the five Sullivan brothers are all dead, all dying after the USS Juneau was sunk by a Japanese submarine in the South Pacific.

1199782,2,B00000F06S,"This two-disc commemorative edition of 'The Fighting Sullivans' contains on its Disc One a decent print/transfer of the title film, and on its Disc Two a fine selection of special features, including speeches by and interviews with some of the last survivors of the sinking of the USS Juneau. The problem is the quality of the DVD's, which is poor.

Let's begin with the DVD sleeve cover image, which shows in sailor uniforms five men who are NOT in the film - I don't know why the producers of this set didn't simply do a screen capture of the scene from the film for this sleeve cover image, instead of substituting an image of five anonymous men who do not appear in the film.

Then comes Disc One, whose subtitles would not switch off when I pressed my remote control to switch them off; and I found that all the other controls on the remote - pause, fast-forward, reverse, and even STOP (!) - did not work, and so  the movie just kept on playing through; and even when the film ended and the disc reverted to display the DVD menu, none of my remote's controls activated, or even navigated to, any of the options on the menu screen - and the STOP button on my remote would not stop the disc from menu display, so that I had to switch off the power to my disc player to get the disc to stop playing its menu display. Also, the film's subtitles suffer from several misspelling howlers, including, but not limited to, ""Road Island Red"" for the Sullivan family's Rhode Island Red hen, and ""Kathryn Mary"" for Al Sullivan's wife Katherine Mary.

Then there's Disc Two, whose special featurs contain a great deal of fine pictorial and video historical material on the Sullivan brothers, their sister Genevieve, their mother and father, their life in Waterloo, Iowa, on their descendents, and on the museum devoted to the Sullivans in their Iowa hometown. The problem with the special feature videos is that they appear to have been taped originally with a videocassette recorder, and the video thus suffers from the limitation of that earlier technology, and suffers again from its transfer to the DVD medium: images are grainy, audio is muddy. The quality of the still images of old photos of the Sullivans and other special feature subjects is only fair.

I don't know that the historical material in this two-disc set is available elsewhere on DVD, but it's all pretty muddy on this set, and yet it contains a great deal of information pertinent to the real Sullivans, so I have mixed feelings about this paradox purely because of the slapdash DVD production and because of the unresponsiveness of the DVD to my player's remote controls.",1370649600,7,2637,4.662365591397849

1199862,2,B00000F06S,"I was expecting a war movie, so I was disappointed. The first 1 hour and 35 minutes were about the family (from marriage through birth of 6 kids and the kids growing-up to their 20s). The first hour was like the ""little rascals"" (it was about the kids growing up). The next 35 minutes were about the life of the kids when they were aged in their 20s. The last 17 minutes had to do with WWII (12 minutes of war footage, 5 minutes back home dealing with the death of the 5 men). I also disliked the catholic religious theme throughout the story.

I watched this movie very long time ago but in French title that means ""I had five sons"" (J'avais cinq fils). I was deeply impressed by the scenes at the beginning of the movie (the five kids saluted the father from the height) when the train passed the water tower; and at the end of film (the hallucinatory images in the sky of the five sons killed in war). And now, I know that film was one of the sources that inspired the movie ""Saving Private Ryan)",1331078400,,661,5.895833333333333
1199865,1,B00000F06S,"While I admire the fact that all five sons went to war for their country and I feel sorry for such a tragic loss for the family, I found this movie incredibly difficult to sit through.  The opening is cute as we are shown one baptism after another.  Those Irish Catholic families sure had the children back in the day.  But the movie focuses heavily on the antics of the boys when they are little.  Basically, they are a band of wild ruffians who had little supervision and got into fights and all kinds of predicaments.  The girl is stuck at home doing all the household chores like a slave, which is quite an eye opener and makes us women appreciate our improved lot nowadays.  And finally when they grow up we learn most of them didn't finish school (go figure, they ran around wild as youngsters) and they tease the youngest son mercilessly when he brings home his girlfriend.  She leaves the house crying and eventually the family is able to convince her that they were not telling the truth.  Their wedding and love story is a sweet one and one of the highlights of the film.  When the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor the boys all go down to the Navy office and try to enlist, with the requirement that they all be together.  The officer doesn't guarantee it so they walk out.  But they return later with a letter from the top brass giving them permission to all be together and so they join the Navy on the same boat.  They get hit and have to abandon ship and in a touching a moment the boys all go back to get their brother who is in sick bay.  Thankfully, the scene goes black and we are spared any gore.  As the film closes with the Christening of a new ship as ""The Sullivans"" we are treated to the boys walking on clouds.  It is very touching and I'm sure meaningful to many who have lost any loved ones in war.  I just had a hard time getting past all the wildness of their youth.",1329177600,,1889,4.264044943820225

1199893,4,B00000F06S,"As one of eight children growing up in Michigan, I was mesmerized in 1962 when I first saw ""The Fighting Sullivans,"" by that time already an 18-year old black & white movie. Like my Dad (a WWII veteran wounded in Europe while with the 103rd Infantry Div) and my two older brothers, I entered into the military service during the Vietnam War, married a WAF (the daughter of a Navy WWII vet aboard the USS Sigourney and USS Duluth), and have now watched five of our own eight children enter the Army and Air Force.  As a Catholic, I strongly identify with the large family of the Sullivans, their religion, and their commitment to military service.  While I enjoyed the 20th Century Fox movie, I also especially appreciated the even-handed and fair treatment that Commander John Satterfield used while writing his book, ""We Band of Brothers: The Sullivans & World War II.""  It's the only book I know of which comprehensively covers the family. It is well-researched from both a military documents viewpoint and that based upon newspaper articles and family and friend interviews. Cmdr Satterfield presents the family as they were--- not saints, just ordinary Americans growing up in the midwest with common family problems.  Both the author and the Mayor of Waterloo, IA(a nephew of Katherine Mary Rooff Sullivan) were receptive to email inquiries I sent. I heartily recommend this book to all but especially to those whose interests center on family military service.  There is a section at the National Museum of the Pacific War, Fredericksburg, TX, which honors and focuses upon the Sullivan brothers.",1298851200,2,1602,4.962686567164179

1199917,5,B00000F06S,"Amazingly, only the last 20 minutes of an almost 2-hour movie are sad, yet the whole movie builds up to that final dreadful situation, and you can't help but get emotional (that's a good thing, by the way. Everyone should get emotional every now and then.)

The bulk of the movie is spent letting you ""get to know"" the Sullivan family--an Irish family full of scrappers. It's really quite cheesy and fluffy for the most part--until all five brothers determine they are going to help put a quick end to the war after Pearl Harbor. Of course, being a family that has always done everything together, they refused to enlist *unless* they could be guaranteed the same ship to serve aboard.

The Sullivans got their wish, of course, and this resulted in one of the singular most tragic episodes of WW2 with all five brothers being lost aboard the same ship. The cover of the DVD points out how the movie almost depends on the fact that the audience knows the ending before the movie starts. I must admit it makes movies like this hard to watch, but it's worth it. Actually, my most emotional moment was after the news was given and everyone had left the room except for the mother and the Navy man (Ward Bond) who had to deliver the news. The man made a comment to the mother that was clearly made only for her benefit, and seeing her response brought tears to my eyes.

Ultimately, the story should be told, and this film does a good job. The fact that it triumphantly ends was really somewhat of a surprise. I will leave the very end just in case there are people like me who didn't know that...! I recommend this movie!",1250208000,3,1617,4.456081081081081

I have to be honest, since I was looking at this film for use in my class I was hoping for more story of them on the ship but that part takes all of about 10 minutes.

1199966,4,B00000F06S,"One little war propaganda film that has a certain charm. The charm comes from the five brothers that can never do anything separately. By insisting on being the five of them on the same ship they were all killed at the same time. That is no heroism in itself. That is just slightly sad and moving. Never put all your eggs in the same basket. If that basket gets run over you lose all your eggs. Yet the film has a charm beyond that and the charm comes from the number five, for one, and the reversal of age order for two. Five is a strange number. The Sullivans are a good Catholic Irish family. So six should be a better number and actually it is reached with the daughter and that brings the family to eight, Christ in his glory. Note when the five boys are dead, if we take into account the wife of the youngest son and their son that makes five again. Five is a deeply pagan number associated with life, the enjoyment of life and here it is inverted by the tragic death of the five sons leaving five people behind them. That is also surprising because of the satanic dimension of this number in a catholic dimension, and this inversion is typically American: the revisiting and de-diabolizing of this number, especially since they become heroes and their name is given to a war ship. Note the last vision of them is a dream when the ship is christened: four sons at first in two groups of two and the fifth one, the only married one, the youngest one coming running after. And then this number five becomes the basic symbol of the western civilization, the five fingers of a hand, the five senses and so many other things that come in five, especially the five cent nickel. Apart from that the film is nothing but propaganda, even when showing the suffering of the survivors, parents, sister and wife: very soft suffering indeed.

It was a little hokey, as was most movies made back then, but this is a very touching story because of the tight-knit relationship between the five brothers. It is ever more touching because it is true. It does take some liberties with the truth, such as the oldest boy did survive the bombing initially, only to die in the shark infested waters before he could be rescued.

1200023,5,B00000F06S,"This excellent film tells the story of the five Sullivan brothers Al, Frank, George, Matt, and Joe from Waterloo, Iowa who signed up for the Navy after the attack on Pearl Harbor and requested to be assigned to the same ship.  The film encompasses their life from young children to their time in the service.
Thomas Mitchell and Selena Royle star as Tom and Mrs. Sullivan; strong parents with a deep Irish heritage and great love for their five sons and one daughter Genevieve.  Tom ruled with a strong hand, but was always fair with his sons, and he let them learn from their mistakes.  One of the boys' great joys was running down to the water tower near the railroad tracks where Tom worked and waving to him as his train pulled away each day.  The Sullivans were typical young boys; getting into fights, bringing home a stray dog, or fixing an old boat and sailing it on the river.
The film then proceeds to show the Sullivans in their late teens and early twenties.  They enjoyed racing motorcycles or working at the town's factory.  Al, the youngest of the boys, falls in love and eventually gets married and has a child.  After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the boys go down to the local recruiting station and enlist in the Navy.  George, the oldest, wrote a letter to the Navy Department receiving permission for all of the brothers to serve together on the same ship.
Time passes, and one fateful day, the Navy sends a spokesman to the Sullivan's home to deliver the tragic news that all five boys have been lost when their ship, the USS Juneau, was sunk off of Guadalcanal.  After this tragic accident, the navy forbid any siblings from serving on the same vessel.
The last ten minutes are the most touching of the movie. After hearing the news, Tom Sullivan heads off to work just like any other day, but when he passes the water tower where his beloved sons gathered and waved to him every day, he stands at attention and, with tears in his eyes, delivers a snappy salute.  The end scene shows the five brothers dressed in their class A uniforms surrounded by clouds waving from the afterworld.  These two scenes are the most touching scenes that I can ever remember seeing in a movie.
This movie is excellent from beginning to end.  I enjoyed watching the boys grow from young rowdy children to responsible young men who go away to fight for their country.  The acting is absolutely excellent as well. Today, there is a guided missile destroyer that proudly serves the United States Navy.  Its name: USS The Sullivans.  Watch this excellent movie and see how five ordinary boys from Iowa grew up to become heroes.",1043712000,11,2626,4.581196581196581
1200024,4,B00000F06S,"THE FIGHTING SULLIVANS
[The Sullivans]

(USA - 1944 - black and white)

Aspect ratio: 1.37:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Following America's entry into the Second World War in December 1941, Winston Churchill advised President Roosevelt to prohibit members of the same family from serving together on active duty. Though Roosevelt took the Prime Minister's warning under advisement, it came too late to prevent the devastating tragedy which befell a devout Irish-American family from Waterloo, Iowa, an incident which made headlines around the world in 1942.

Lloyd Bacon's flag-waving melodrama THE SULLIVANS (1944) - released on DVD under its theatrical re-release title THE FIGHTING SULLIVANS - tells the true story of six children (five boys and a girl) who were raised by hard-working parents (played here by Thomas Mitchell and Selena Royle) and imbued with the kind of traditional values that audiences craved during wartime. Mary C. McCall Jr.'s episodic screenplay (based on an Oscar-nominated story by Jules Schermer and Edward Doherty) follows the children from birth to adolescence and young adulthood, recreating notable - and not so notable! - events in their lives as a means of illustrating their individual personalities. As children, they get into scrapes with other kids from the surrounding neighborhood, and as young adults they form relationships outside their close-knit family which are rudely interrupted by the bombing of Pearl Harbor. When the five boys go off to war and the inevitable tragedy strikes, unprepared viewers might feel like they've just been hit by an express train. In fact, the last fifteen minutes of the film are so utterly heartbreaking (particularly the 'water tower' sequence), many theater owners refused to screen the movie until after the war was over, believing it would be too painful for families who had lost loved ones on the front line. Half a century later, Steven Spielberg would pay tribute to the Sullivan family by using their experience as a springboard for his own wartime melodrama, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998).

Nevertheless, THE SULLIVANS was a modest success in its day, thanks to its stirring patriotism and heartfelt emotion. Director Bacon (a veteran craftsman who had begun his career in silent films before making a name for himself during the sound era with the likes of 42nd STREET [1933]) tells the story in straightforward fashion, spurning flashy camera tricks in favor of a low-key visual style, employing close-ups and tracking shots purely for dramatic emphasis at key points in the narrative. Bacon also uses an instrumental version of the old military standard 'Anchors Away' to particularly memorable effect during the latter stages of the film - some will find it corny, others will be deeply moved; either response is valid.

Production values are economical but solid, and the cast is a mixed bag, spearheaded by veterans Royle (THE HEIRESS [1949]) and Mitchell (one of Hollywood's most celebrated character actors, usually a supporting player in A-list productions like GONE WITH THE WIND [1939] and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE [1946]), while Anne Baxter - so memorable in Orson Welles' THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS [1942] - toplines the younger cast in a thankless minor role. The five Sullivan boys are played by relative unknowns and their performances are pretty variable, though the young actors who play them as children aren't even credited on-screen! Chief amongst them is Bobby Driscoll (as the youngest Sullivan boy), a hugely talented child star who won an Oscar for his role in Ted Tetzlaff's superb thriller THE WINDOW (1949) and later provided the voice of the title character in Disney's PETER PAN (1953) before his life was tragically cut short by a drugs overdose in 1968. Further down the cast list in a small but crucial role is Ward Bond, playing a navy officer who utters the single most wrenching line of dialogue in the entire film (""All five""). Though virtually forgotten today, Bond appeared in almost 300 movies during the course of his long career, lending an element of quiet dignity to every role he ever played.

NB. Shortly after the events described in this film, President Roosevelt finally decreed that family members would no longer be allowed to serve together in the US military. This rule has been in force ever since.",1035158400,4,4336,5.168091168091168

1200060,5,B00000F06S,"""The Fighting Sullivans"" is the true story of five brothers who died together when their Navy ship, the Juneau, was sunk in the South Pacific during World War II.  But only the last act of this 1944 film, directed by Lloyd Bacon, shows the Sullivans at war.  Most of this film is pure Americana, following the lives of the boys from their childhood in Waterloo, Iowa.  Thomas Mitchell and the marvelous Selena Royle are the loving parents, while the five boys are played by unknown actors: Edward Ryan (Al), John Campbell (Frank), James Cardwell (George), John Alvin (Matt), and George Offerman (Joe).  Trudy Marshall plays their only sister, Genevieve.  Top billing actually goes to Anne Baxter as the young girl who marries into the family and will be left a widow with a baby in arms.  Ward Bond plays the Navy lieutenant who befriends the family when the Sullivans insist that they will only join up if they can serve together.  Eventually the Navy relents and the boys get their wish.
Audiences knew the tragic fate of the Sullivans, although the film was originally released as ""The Sullivans"" and pretty much bombed at the box office.  Retitled ""The Fighting Sullivans"" and re-released, it became a smash hit.  The use of unknown actors made the film all the more effective, especially since it refrained from the sort of cliches you would expect.  If the scene where the parents learn all five boys have died does not get you, the next scene will: Mr. Sullivan goes off to his job on the railroad and as the train passes the water tower where his boys waved to him as kids, he salutes them.  Actually, this film works so well that the final shot, of the Sullivans in uniform striding across the clouds of the afterlife does not seem one whit hokey.  There is a documentary available on the Sullivans, which tells how one of the boys survived the sinking before dying in the waters off of Guadacanal.  I would not have thought anything could have made this story more tragic, but that bit of information certainly made it worse for me.",994464000,122,2042,4.670391061452514
1200061,5,B00000F06S,"One of the all-time great movies to come out of Hollywood. Superb family entertainment for all ages. Only one item defies analysis. With attention to detail about the Sullivan history, why would Hollywood producers opt to change the ending? Four of the five brothers did die in the explosions that wracked the Juneau. However, sharks killed a wounded George Sullivan shortly after he abandoned ship. Although the Hollywood ending to the story is more heart rending, it sheds doubt on the historical accuracy of the movie. Nonetheless, the cast did the Sullivan brothers and their surviving family members proud. The Fighting Sullivans earns its place as a classic and enduring masterpiece.",986601600,3,689,5.216216216216216

It just grabbed me immediately, and I stuck with it until the bitter end. The  scene of the father slowly getting ready to go to work right after hearing  of his son's deaths, is something you would never see in today's movies.  Wow, what can I say?  Any movie that affects me so much that I start  researching it over the web is 5 stars in my book...",950832000,4,497,3.92
1200064,5,B00000F06S,"(Note. This review and every other one on this page gives away the ending of this movie. It does not necessarily ruin the movie, but if you don't want to know, don't read on).
There are so many criteria for what makes a  film good that to try to say universally that any one is one of the best is  asking for argument. But in my book anyway, this movie has all it needs to  make it one of the greatest movies of the century.
It approaches its  subject from a unique and brilliant perspective, one which is actually the  most realistic. People do not start their lives going to war, so it is  impossible to see what war really is by just seeing a movie that starts  with a young man (or woman) ""going off to war"". (There is a place  for movies like that, of course). Instead, soldiers are persons with lives  behind and possibly ahead of them, and this movie makes that point with  more than usual strength.
Also, as others pointed out, the first part as  well makes it an excellent family movie. The portrait of the young  Sullivans, while adding pathos to the finale, is a fine view of a loving,  close-knit family.
It is not an anti-war movie, but merely a movie to  show one how great a sacrifice was made by so many for the continuing  freedom with which we are blessed. (Even thought that sort of thing is said  so often that we get cynical.)
I highly recommend it.",945475200,16,1370,4.272373540856031
1200065,5,B00000F06S,"This is a wonderful, nostalgic look at a time in which values seem to have been simpler and more clear-cut.  There was right and there was wrong and good people did what had to be done.  Perhaps this black-and-white world  never really existed, but I sure hope it did.
""The Fighting  Sullivans,"" like ""The Best Years of Our Lives,"" is a tribute  to the best generation that this century has known; a generation that  survived the Great Depression and not only survived but prevailed in the  most horrible war this world has yet known.
The film is beautifully  acted, especially by Thomas Mitchell and Selena Royle as the parents.  The  most moving scene is the one in which Mitchell and Royle are notified by  naval officer Ward Bond that their sons have been lost. This never fails to  move me to tears.
A note about the DVD version of this film: the DVD  features a secondary soundtrack which contains an audio essay by Jack  Bilello, author of ""Bonds of War.""  This essay is a deeply moving  and personal eulogy for the Sullivan brothers and is itself worth the cost  of admission.",943401600,17,1084,4.591623036649215

Mind you I am a seasoned Viet Nam veteran...and this movie is  so realistic as to what life was and should be, that it will affect anyone  who views it in a favorable light. I now insist that my two adult children  view this movie, and will purchase it for each of them as a reminder as to  family values, and the sacrifice that past American's have made for our  freedoms. This is a film that should be viewed by every American. This is a  film which should be included as required viewing for any immigrant  entering and enjoying the freedoms of the USA.
