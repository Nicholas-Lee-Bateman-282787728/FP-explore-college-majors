There's not really a lot out there (online or print) for this style of music. I was happy to see a dvd set/course dedicated to surf guitar, but unfortunately this is pretty underwhelming. There aren't many lessons here at all (I thought I was missing some but I went through all the menus), and the lessons that are here are very basic and short (I realize it has ""beginner"" in the title, but I wasn't expecting this). I'm sure Jason is a good instructor, but there's just not a lot of content in the few lessons on the disc. I'm usually not too picky about video quality and presentation, but this was pretty bad. I think it's about 6 years old but if you're offering a product like this with a flashy sales page and lots of promises, you'd better deliver. You'd be better off checking out their YouTube channel for free stuff!",1501718400,,967,4.407821229050279
8515670,1,B007FFQPIE,It was not worth the money. The examples kinda sucked. The information was shallow. They could have at least gone into some ball park ideas for amp settings (I realize they change with venue etc. ) to get a good tone. There really wasn't anything here that you could not get online for free and better. I think the dude spent more time on his hair than thinking about solid lessons.
