831229,4,6304293437,If you ever saw the movie Bonnie and Clyde with Faye Dunaway and Warren Batty you will know what I'm taliking about.  This is a more up to date version and the charaters have switched.  Judd being more like Clyde really in to guns and the thrill of the bad life and Perry being more like Bonnie excited but wants a normal life.  I would have given the movie 5 stars but Judd doesn't seem to like shirts in the movie and being a girl I'm not really intrested.  But a great movie.,995932800,,478,4.10752688172043
831230,4,6304293437,"Ashley Judd plays Pam, a young woman on the edge of madness and Luke Perry is Chris, her husband. The film is loosely based on real events.
The storyline is very basic indeed. Chris and Pam meet and, despite their  differences, they marry. They stay together despite Pam's increasingly deep  and hurtful bouts of insanity. The marriage finally costs Chris his job as  a cop and, in a last attempt to make ends meet, he takes to robbing  banks.
His background as a cop means that he is pretty good at this and  soon, he and Pam are benefitting from the fruits of his labours. Then, one  day Pam finds out about the bank robberies and this changes their  relationship forever but with destructive consequences.
It's not much of  a plot but it is only there as a platform for the film to explore the  relationship between Pam and Chris.
Pam desperately wants a man who will  care for her and so she wants a man like Chis but she cannot respond to  him. She is emotionally and sexually frigid. Chris wants to take care of  Pam in the way that he thinks he should but he is unable to get through to  her.
It turns out the what Pam really needs is a tough, all action strong  guy who will care for her emotional needs as well. When she realises that  her man has become a bank robber, suddenly, he is the man of her dreams and  she bursts open with a new joy for life.
This scenario depends very much  on the performaces from the two leads. Judd did her job well, you could  really feel the troubles inside the mind of her character and without this,  the film would have been poor indeed. Luke Perry was not so good. As far as  I could see, his character was only staying with Pam because that's what it  said in the script. There was no sense of why Chris needed Pam so much that  he sat through all of the pain. Only in the closing moments did you see a  sign of how much she was to him.
It was a very hard roll to play but I'm  afraid that he was not really up to it.",961459200,4,1965,4.137566137566138
831231,1,6304293437,"More often than not, an early title card that reads ""inspired by a true story"" translates to a film maker's apology for what is going to be an embarrassing work. And electronic titles as well, the cheapest  possible-cheap like they use for the late-night cable movies suggests this  project was scrapped-pieces pasted together into something presentable, but  hardly watchable.
And when you're right, you're right.
Good, lonely boy  meets bad, bad girl, in a bad, bad, bad, movie
It seems inappropriate to  criticize the actors, as I can't imagine there was even a script. Every  scene seems to be a series of bad improvs, almost amateurish audition  pieces. I was a John McNaughton fan based on his first feature:  ""Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer"", a low budget, but high-energy,  inventive piece of film making. But this mess is only familiar to that film  as regards overall production value.
By my count this makes 5 movies in a  row where the high point of Ashley Judd's performance seems to be her  undressing and /or use of dirty language. This list includes her role as  the young Norma Jean Baker (Marilyn Monroe). Maybe a case of life imitates  art?",953856000,3,1162,4.83248730964467

Self mutilation is a clear and present sign of insanity! She threatened to commit a suicide every time he scolded her, disagreed with her or even had a little normal marriage spat. Good grief!

831339,4,6304293437,"This is a very solid ""little"" film in which Ashley Judd and Luke Perry play Pam and Chris, two very outwardly normal looking people.

But Pam is very much a borderline personality and bipolar to boot. Chris is a young cop who is willing to sacrifice everything due to his codependency with Pam. While Chris is at work, Pam drugs and drinks and plays with Chris' gun collection in her panties, and cuts herself. She can't deal with Chris' normal family and runs away from them whenever she's forced to be social.

Chris is willing to do anything---ANYTHING---to help Pam, and so he ends up with a mountain of debt, no friends, and no job. In desperation, he turns to robbing banks. When Pam finds out, she wants to play too, and that's literally how she sees it---as a game. All they really both want is a house with a white picket fence and the requisite middle-class toys, a normal life, but there's nothing ""normal"" to build on.

NORMAL LIFE questions modern American values and it questions the viewer. What do you want? How badly do you want it? What are you willing to do to get it? Will you sacrifice?",1237852800,,1107,4.497512437810945

831420,5,6304293437,this movie was the most touching and brilliant portrayal of a thick moustache that i have ever seen.  It really touched me on a very deep and emotional level.  i cant get the vision of luke perry's moustache out of my head and its something i never want to forget about.  That moustache is this sexiest thing i have ever seen and the biggest turn on.  Throughout the movie you grow more and more fond of how beautiful that hairy thing above his lip truly is.  The moustache takes on a life of its own and really the director could have written a whole movie all about the moustache and nothing more...im really looking foraward to seeing if there will be a sequal focused only on the life of luke perry's brilliant moustache.,1189209600,3,725,4.421052631578948
831421,4,6304293437,"Perhaps, in NORMAL LIFE, director John McNaughton never

realized his luck in combining the right timing,

assembling the right actors and actresses and the right

story, all wrapped into one movie, considering his other

boring one, Lansky, that was a sleeper, for example.

NORMAL LIFE is quite skeletal in its complexity (or in

other words, is not unnecessarily convoluted), telling a

dynamite story, hitting viewers not unlike a hammer hits a

nail on the head, such is the shock of seeing the

progression of a upstanding, law-abiding police officer

mutate into a hidious, stickup artist, on the word of a

hot, crazed, libido-filled, drugged, delinquent young

chick, played incredibly well by Ashley Judd, known to not

shy away from controversial, shocking and out-of-the-norm

roles.

A Christian friend of mine, having seen this movie,

admitted having cried from having seen it, in dispair of

the damage borne by the man, in an attempt to preserve

that monogamous relationship with Judd, satisfying her

many wants and needs, to the point of sacrificing  his own

line of work, and putting his life on the line in criminal

enterprises for profit. Other people loved this movie,

from its originality, all praised Judd's natural feel in

playing the role that she did, and the maturity of Luke

Perry, who very well conveyed to the audience the anguish

and emotional torture  endured from this wild ride of

a relationship.

Of course, NORMAL LIFE's ending, condemns the entire

behavior, as it obviously had to, considering the movie is

taken from a real life story, from almost 40 years ago,

in USA.",1168041600,4,1620,5.018939393939394

831423,4,6304293437,"Question: What can you do when you fall in love with a manic-depressive?

Answer: Why, rob banks of course!

Normal Life, ostensibly based on a true story, is a film about two social misfits, opposites in a way, who find each other and start living a life that is anything but normal.

Chris Anderson (Luke Perry), a straight laced policeman in a small Illinois town near Chicago, while having a drink with his brother in a a local bar, can't help but notice a lovely creature (Ashley Judd) sitting in a booth with two guys. All of a sudden she blows up arguing yelling at her companions and as they walk out on her, she smashes a beer glass, cutting her hand in the process. Our chivalrous knight, Chris goes to help and Pam is impressed. So starts a torrid courtship which doesn't slow down until marriage and the drudgery of making a living.

There is something wrong with Pam but Chris either doesn't see it or he's not willing to face it. Pam has short attention span and seems to be ambivalent about sex but nevertheless craves excitement for which Chris's answer is to buy her things on credit. Pam seems to be fighting a never ending battle with her inner demons. She drinks to excess and enjoys humiliating Chris. When visiting his family she ignore them and showed up at his father's funeral on roller skates. She fixes dinner for herself and forgets Chris, tears up the apartment, mutilates herself, threatens suicide. She is a disturbed, self destructive, manic-depressive, .

In the meantime Chris is starting to make enemies on the force and eventually is forced out. Pam works in a factory but they were having trouble with two paychecks and they certainly can't make it on one. Pam flips out and leaves reminding Chris that he promised to take care of her. When he finds her, he tells her that she doesn't have to worry because he will handle things.

That's when Chris starts robbing banks. Being an ex-cop helps if you're going to rob banks and Chris is successful for quite a while. Eventually Pam finds out and she is thrilled. She insists on helping him and he reluctantly agrees but the police and FBI are setting a trap.

CONCLUSION

First, I rented the un-rated CD version. I'm not sure what the difference was versus the R version but this version was fairly explicit and showed both Perry and Judd in the nude but Judd much more as she seemed to lounge around the apartment naked when she was depressed, which was a lot.

Since Ashley Judd is probably my favorite actress this was a pleasant bonus, seeing my favorite actress in the buff. But Ashley didn't just show off her physical attributes she really got into the part. This was some of her best acting if not her best. It's a shame that it was wasted on what is essentially a `B' movie.

The movie itself seemed hokey at times and except for the nudity, I would have thought it to be a low budget TV movie. The sets and the cinematography resembled a TV movie and I would say that most of that would probably fall on the director, McNaughton.

Perry's acting was also good but supporting actors seemed a little tentative. I thought the story was good and it was portrayed well, if cheaply. I thought the film was entertaining, though it is not one I'd like to watch more than once. I give Normal Life 31/2 stars rounded up because I like Ashley Judd.",1124928000,24,3332,4.51827242524917
831424,4,6304293437,"Ashley Judd--Pam--is a certified nutcase, a combination sociopath and manic depressive.  Luke Perry--Chris--is a gun-obsessed cop.  They meet--NOT cute at all--and get married.  He feeds off his need for her. She feeds off every next minute of thrills.  No thrills, no connection.  No connection, no hope.

She's in despair, she's ecstatic, she's drugged out half the time, she plays with her husband's guns.  They have sex and she doesn't feel anything, but shows off her great body a lot.  She freaks when she's around other people Chris values (his parents, his friends).  He doesn't know what to do with her.

The title is obviously ironic and the violence--brutal and sudden--is not the cookie-cutter variety seen in most Hollywood movies but tragic and senseless and awful.  The thing is, what does Pam really want?  What does Chris really want?

What do you really want?  That's the real question here.  And because this movie asks that question in such an upfront way it's a solid piece of work.  Most people don't really know what they want; they hang onto little pieces of dreams or illusions, hoping life will bring them more than what they have now.

Here's a film that slams home that question right between the eyes.  Do you want a telescope?  Do you want a lot of money and a new house?  A new motorcycle?  OK.  You get those.

Then what?",1110240000,37,1353,4.761904761904762
