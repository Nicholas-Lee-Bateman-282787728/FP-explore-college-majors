539715,5,6303049117,"I am new to Yoga.  I had always belonged to a gym where I used weights and the treadmill.  I started getting bored with my routine and with 2 small kids, couldn't always fit my workout in.  Because of the great reviews she received, I purchased Molly Fox's DVD.  Thank goodness I am flexible! This would be extremely challenging for someone who is not.  I feel like this DVD is challenging enough where I will not master it right away but will not get frustrated trying.  For a relatively short workout, it does target the entire body.  After following Molly's workout every other day for a month, I have definitely noticed more definition in my waistline and I feel overall leaner and better.",1043280000,11,693,4.585365853658536
539716,5,6303049117,"I ordered this DVD after reading reviews of several others on Amazon.com. The reviews all said this video was great and I have to admit I was surprised because I'd never heard of Molly Fox. I took the chance and ordered it because unlike some of the more well known videos this one had no bad reviews. When I first started the dvd I thought it looked kind of low budget but I quickly realized that what it lacked in budget it definately made up for in content,good camera work, excellent audio and simple but appealing backgrounds. The music was relaxing but not overpowering, the background was simple but soothing. Molly was so reassuring and obviously well skilled. She had a good pace to the video and described all the moves well. At first you'll probably feel she's moving quickly but this is actually the way the Sun Salutations are supposed to be done from what I hear. Also she does some more difficult moves but takes it slow enough that I was able to make it through them. One of the most important aspects of a good yoga dvd is the audio and the instructions. If you cannot follow the instructor based solely on their voice and instructions you will find yourself confused in some poses. Molly definately had this down. You can actually see that Molly really enjoyed making this video and that she is very much inspired by Yoga. This is a good dvd for an experienced person or a beginner. It's about 36 minutes which is perfect for before or after work. Believe me, you will love this video! Thanks Molly!",1028937600,22,1517,4.52
7835304,5,6303049117,The tape works great. Brand new in the wrapping when I got it.,1407888000,,62,3.8461538461538463
7835305,1,6303049117,Of course it has a skip in the middle of the exercise video so I have to stop and fast forward every time....not fun!!,1393027200,,118,3.9583333333333335
7835306,5,6303049117,Molly Fox's instructions are clear and easy to follow.  I forget that I'm actually exercising; it's so relaxing and it really works every muscle that you didn't know you had.  My flexibility has increased dramatically and I can feel my body toning and I have only been working with this video for two weeks now. I plan to purchase more of her yoga videos!,1367452800,,355,4.53125
7835307,5,6303049117,Great yoga video for someone on the run that wants to regulate breathing and break a sweat. The routine gives equal weight to strengthening and stretching.,1318032000,,155,5.0
7835308,5,6303049117,"I have done other Yoga videos, but if you are looking for a good work out with the benefits of yoga this is a great choice!",1283990400,,123,3.769230769230769
7835309,4,6303049117,"Since this came out in the 1990s, expect the sparse set w/a couple of lit triangle props & the instructor in a dark green leotard that goes to the ankles like you see in the photo. Molly's alone & she talks w/wireless mic strapped to her leotard as she goes. There seems to be no breaks as she perspires as time wears on. She tells you the English name of the pose as you go into usually. She gives the usual basic cues, move the quads off the knees, send energy to the feet, ground your feet, etc. Not enough for a total beginner. She holds all poses besides the sun salutations for 5-6 ful breaths & always tells you when to breath in/out when going in/out of each pose & reminders during which is relaxing. The music is played really low, it's not great, it's not bad, it's ok. I think it's Molly's good intention & good presence that keeps me going.
Sun Salutations: 8 min
done 7x, only mountain, back bend, standing fwd bend, lunge, plank, up dog, down dog, mountain basic ones. She moves in a clipped pace, 1 breath for each pose. On the 6th & 7th time, she adds bending the elbows a few times & longer up dog to work the upper body.
Standing Poses: 17 min
No more sun salutations, each pose held for 5-6 breaths & each on done on one side, then the other, then repeated on each side again. Triangle, standing fwd bend, side angle, wide angle fwd bend, warrior series (warrior 1 & 2, child's (2 breaths), down dog, chair (2 breaths) in between.
Balancing Poses: 4 min
These are only done 1x each side: Frog, warrior 3, squatting down & balancing on toes, crow & as you ease to sitting staff pose, try to hold body up with hands for a second.
Sitting Poses: 4 min
modified boat, boat, sitting fwd bend, bridge
Savasana/Relaxation: 2 min
Molly verbally guides throughout & is mostly sitting up herself.

Overall I like she holds the poses a while, she seems to know what she's doing & has good presence overall to keep you from getting bored. If you have trouble finding yoga dvd like this is described & like the style, get it, otherwise you're not missing that much.",1206662400,2,2072,4.34020618556701
7835310,5,6303049117,"I've had this video for a few years now. It's a great DVD with the basic yoga postures. Good for beginners who need to learn proper form, but challenging enough for the more experienced, because it's real yoga not fluffy ""yoga-inspired aerobics."" The cueing is great and you don't have to get a sore neck looking at the screen, because the instructor cues all the movements. Really great overall!",1191542400,,396,4.753623188405797
7835311,5,6303049117,"I have been using this DVD for a few years now, and I'm continually surprised at what a great work out it provides. I have been practicing yoga for several years and I found her instruction to be clear and her tips for the poses helpful in intensifying the workout. While this may not be the best for beginners, this DVD is a good one for intermediate level yoga.",1102723200,2,363,4.27536231884058
7835312,1,6303049117,"If you would like a recycled aerobics, sports trainer person teaching yoga, then this is the DVD for you. I wasn't looking for a spiritual journey, but I object to the repackaging and marketing approach.  I know this will sound disrespectful, take this as one person's opinion, I found the entire format a farce.",1056758400,6,312,4.777777777777778
7835313,1,6303049117,"After reading all the reviews, I decided to branch out and try this....I was extremely disappointed.  Molly doesn't use the names of the poses very often and will move without sharing what she is doing in detail.  Therefore, you will be left in a pose waiting to move.  She also does a lot of ""jumping"" - I found this obnoxious.  Not at all the flowing Yoga I enjoy - beginners - this isn't for you.  Try ""Crunch - The perfect Yoga Workout.""  It's worth your money.",1050451200,7,465,4.348837209302325
