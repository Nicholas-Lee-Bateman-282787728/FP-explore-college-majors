562261,5,6303042562,"This is a fantastic series, both set 1 and 2. The story and characters appeal to both men and women. Most people will watch it all the way through the first time. Period details are great. I read all the books after  watching the series and was not disappointed in any way. The casting was  absolutely true to the books. Jed is a character that just has to be seen  to be believed. You will find yourself watching these multiple times. A  very good investment.",963878400,19,460,4.376470588235295
562262,5,6303042562,"This excellent series was first broadcast on Masterpiece Theater back in 1975 and is based on the novels by Winston Graham.  It plays out much like an 18th Century soap opera.  Ross Poldark (Robin Ellis) is the story's  central character; after being injured during the Revolutionary War, he  returns to his home in England (Cornwall).  What he discovers ignites a  chain of events that is brilliantly designed to grab and hold the viewer's  attention until the very end.  You do not need an elaborate understanding  of England's history during this time-period to follow or enjoy the Poldark  series...it is no more than an countless string of captivating subplots  complete with daring rescues and dangerous liaisons, each carefully woven  to support but never overshadow the story's crux: a complex, intricate love  triangle that would stupefy Pythagoras himself.
Overall, I found the  series to be more entertaining than Graham's books, which at times were  slow and uninvolving.  However, the story does not end with Poldark 2:  Graham continues the saga with several more books (including ""The Loving  Cup,"" which is currently out of print), but alas, except for ""Stranger from  the Sea,"" these were never adapted to the small screen.  If nothing else, I  suggest you watch the series to get to know Demelza (Angharad Rees), one of  the most stunningly beautiful women I have ever seen.",963792000,29,1392,5.093333333333334

562264,4,6303042562,"The Poldark series is vastly under-rated and in my opinion is easily the best Masterpiece Theatre series ever produced.  The time period is 1780's to 1790's set in Cornwall.  The scenery is magnificent and the acting is  very well accomplished - with social stratification for the period intact.  Capt Poldark is returning to Britain after being captured and reported to  be killed in the ""Colonial Wars"" in America. He returns ""as  if from the dead"" to find his former fiance now married to another  man, his father dead, and sole inheritor of a family estate in great  disrepair.
To make some sort of life is the task set before him.  I  assume that his experience with the ""freedoms"" in the colonies  has embued him with a certain desire to try to provide a sense of social  justice in his dealings with the tenants on his land and others of  different social strata.
The whole story is a marvelous window back in  time to a previous era in Britain, prior to the Napoleonic Wars.  It is  truely well worth the price for this series.",919209600,46,1035,4.573770491803279
562335,5,6303042562,"The Poldark miniseries is an excellent BBC adaptation of the first four novels by Winston Graham, published in the 1950's.

Created for the BBC in mid-1970, it was clearly made for television.  The production budget was adequate but not lavish.  Interiors were obviously video taped on a sound stage.  But, despite those drawbacks it remains a compelling story.

Winston Graham set his novel just a bit earlier than the writing of Jane Austen, the late eighteenth century.  As the story opens the protagonist, Ross Poldark, from a prominent Cornish family, has just returned from fighting the colonists in America.  But reports that he has died proceeded his return and Ross learns, his father has, in fact, died leaving the family estate in near financial ruin.  Finally, believing that Ross, has died in the war, Elizabeth, the woman he had courted before his departure, has engaged herself to a cousin of Ross Poldark.  All of that in the opening minutes of the first episode.

This is an excellent miniseries for fans of the genre.  Unfortunately, it is no longer available new but you can still buy the VHS version used on Amazon.com or borrow it from the library.  I don't believe that it has ever been released in DVD format for North America.

Although I haven't seen the series on PBS in years, I immediatedly noticed many of the scenes were trimmed.  Even though I was happy to see the Poldark saga again, I was disappointed by the editing.  The episodes are 1 hour with 2 episodes per tape.  The TV network style editing was unwarranted.  I hope when Poldark comes out on DVD, there will be no edits.",1066089600,10,441,4.265060240963855
562340,5,6303042562,"My sister has always raved about the Poldark series that was shown on Masterpiece Theatre in the mid nineteen seventies. When it first became available on video, though it was expensive, she promptly bought the first set of six tapes and has yet to tire of watching them. Knowing how much I love period pieces, she urged me to watch it, telling me that she was sure that I, too, would love it. Well, she was right.
This is a first rate period piece, set in late eighteenth century Cornwall. It focuses on Ross Poldark, scion of a well known Cornish family. He is a member of the established gentry and a gentleman. Having been gone from Cornwall for a time to fight against the colonists, he returns battle scarred only to find that his father has died and left the family estate in ruins and in debt. He also finds that the love of his life, Elizabeth, believing that Ross had been killed in battle, has become engaged to his first cousin, Francis Poldark. He also discovers to his dismay  that the upstart but wealthy Warleggan family, for whom Poldark has no love, is trying to buy the Poldark family mine. This mightily upsets Ross, as the Poldarks represent old money and the established gentry, while the Warleggans represent new money and are social upstarts.
As Ross Poldark tries to rebuild his estate and family fortune, he takes in a red headed, feisty, young street urchin who turns out to be a hoyden with the unlikely name of Demelza. Firmly ensconcing herself on the Poldark estate, she helps Poldark rebuild his estate, scrubbing. cleaning, all while falling in love with the brooding Ross, as he moons for Elizabeth and fends off the Warleggans who appear to conspire to ruin Poldark at every turn. A night of passion, however, finally finds Poldark  looking at Demelza with new eyes, and his sense of honor compels him to marry her, little knowing that he would be getting the bargain of his life in doing so.
This is the story of Ross Poldark and Demelza, their families and friends, their loves and enemies. It is a story of sweeping proportions and  a fine dynastic saga. It is also a story of the intense rivalry  between the Poldarks and the Warleggans, a rivalry that would pit the scions of each of these families, Ross Poldark and George Warleggan, in a life long personal battle that nearly destroys them both. Based upon a series of books by Winston Graham, the Poldark series does honor to the author's work.
Robin Ellis is outstanding as the honorable, though brooding, Ross Poldark. When the viewer first sees him, the viewer wonders what on earth all the fuss is about. Within minutes, however, the viewer finds oneself half falling in love with his character. Angharad Rees is delightful as the feisty, impish little red head and is guaranteed to win the heart of every viewer.  Robert Bates gives an affecting performance as Poldark's enemy, George Warleggan, a despicable yet, at the same time, curiously touching, individual. Jill Townsend is appropriately cool and aloof as the ever unattainable Elizabeth of Ross' dreams. Richard Morant gives a stellar performance as the kind and compassionate Dr. Enys, a close friend of Ross Poldark. The rest of the supporting cast is also quite strong and contributes to the success of this tale of romance and adventure in the Cornish countryside.
This is a video set well worth having in one's personal collection. Bravo!",1050969600,71,3399,4.754237288135593
562341,5,6303042562,"Poldark is an adaptation of the first four of Winston Graham's novels set in Cornwall in the late eighteenth century.  This is a great story of love and loss.  Ross Poldark arrives home after years in the British army in the America (How often do we Americans see a redcoat as a hero?) to find his father dead and his beloved Elizabeth engaged to his cousin Francis.  Ross endures intense depression, then finds two new loves, his future wife Demelza and his copper mines.  He defends both and comes close to losing both in one scheme after another.  All the time his unrequited love for Elizabeth hangs over him and his family.
The Poldark story is a good picture of late eighteenth century England as the old gentry, represented by the Poldarks, struggles for control against the up and coming new commercial elite, represented here by the Warleggan family. It is a grand story of romance and adventure.",1032739200,17,905,4.7025316455696204

I watched this series in 1975 when it was first broadcast on PBS.  I was 13.  Unlike some of the other BBC productions of that time, this one holds up amazingly well.  It's just as wonderful as I remember.  The acting is suberb, the story strong and intriguing and the viewer is never bored. The details aid in geting the feeling of the period. The main thread of the story, along with many of the subplots, will stay with you for a long time.  I was amazed at how much of the series I remembered after 25 years!

562343,4,6303042562,"I enjoyed this series when it first played on Masterpiece Theater and finally decided a year ago to try the books.  After reading the first few, my husband and I began watching the videos.  Here's the deal--the acting is wonderful, but the adaptation, especially in the first half of the first series, is infuriating.  Many things were changed, all to make the story more melodramatic than in the books--changes that insult the viewer's intelligence.  But hang with it--the adapters start to trust the original as they go, and Graham's story comes through intact.  I'm not complaining on the mere basis of change--the first series covers about 1300 pages of novels, and changes had to be made.  But the changes were stupid ones. . . And try the books.  They are absolutely marvelous.",1004832000,8,783,4.886363636363637

I can't be objective writing a review for this show because I love it so much.  But I had not seen it for 30 years and now my local PBS station has started to reshow it.  Believing it may not have aged as well as I remembered, I started watching with trepidation.  I was absolutely amazed at the first episode.  The characters were just as charming as I remembered.  The dialogue just as crisp, and the anticipation of the next episode just as excruciating as I remember.  I finally did it, I bought a used copy of the series.  I devoured it in just a few days.
