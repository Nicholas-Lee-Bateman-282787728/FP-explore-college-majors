Baron Tanaka wrote a secret plan on world conquest. An American newspaperman in Tokyo exposed it. It starts by showing a man falling in front of the ""Tokyo Chronicle"" while a crowd gathers. The police drive them away with staves. A Japanese official complains to the newspaper publisher. Where is Nick Condon? At a judo school. His article is a lie! But it came from New York newspapers. [Does that make it true?] Circulation and profits are up under Condon's leadership. Was that story a rumor? No matter. Nick visits a bar, two men join him. Was that story designed as a distraction? [Is one reporter too nosy?] Another reporter, Ollie Miller and his wife, are returning to America. Where did he get that money? A woman in black escapes from the ship! Nick calls his newspaper office, then goes home. There are shots! Ollie is wounded. He has a sealed envelope with a secret.

The Japanese police arrive to search for a criminal. Nick is invited to make a report. There were false charges to justify his arrest. Does he have proof of his charges? When he returns home he finds the damage was repaired! Then he gets an invitation to visit Baron Tanaka at home. The Jap Militarists have chose a policy. Nick meets Tanaka and Colonel Tojo. There is political division in Japan. The captain of that ship said Ollie and his wife were on board. Can Nick send a radiogram to get that ""forged document""? He names his price. No deal? Nick will return to America, he has a plan to get that document. A couple joins him at that bar. Nick notices the ring on Iris' left hand. Iris mentions a name from Shanghai. Iris has friends in high places; she reports to them. Can she find that document? Nick knows a fact about Joe Cassell. Nick spends time with Iris. They shake a tail.

Nick and Iris dine and talk. Iris is studying the problems of Japanese women; they are oppressed. Iris has a large and luxurious apartment. Her maid is Chinese. The next day there is an article about Joe Cassell. [Does this end his usefulness?] Joe talks to Nick and says too much. Nick goes to Iris and accuses her of working for the Japanese! [No recording devices then.] Iris took that letter and gives it to Nick. Can the signature be authenticated? Yes, says Iris. Later Iris gets a visitor who gives her a gift of silver coins. His failure also has consequences. Nick gets a message from Iris. A US Embassy official will take Nick to an American boat. But Nick goes to that wharf to meet Iris. A Japanese official signs that document as proof. It may prevent the Militarists' policy from succeeding. A small fishing boat will take them away. Nick will stall their pursuers. Nick challenges Oshima to a fight. [Wasn't that a stunt double who takes the falls?] Nick wins. He avoids the secret police (Kem-Pei-Tai). Can he reach the American Embassy? A sniper fires at him, he falls and is searched - no papers! A US Embassy official brings him in.

This 1943 propaganda movie also has pre-war intrigue. Can a secret document be published to reveal the policy of the Militarist? Its no secret that Japan had Imperial plans to conquer and occupy China, Siam, French Indo-China, and British Malaya. Could a newspaper report alone stop them? Only if it swayed public opinion in the targeted countries so they became allies. Most people are snowed in today by entertainment news or scandals",1454371200,,3411,4.605263157894737
