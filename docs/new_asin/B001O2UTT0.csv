3726331,4,B001O2UTT0,"With a lower budget, no big name actors and only an hour, these small movies are better than the last ten blockbusters I've seen. Not so much documentaries as dramatic depictions of the decision making and consequences of these leaders giving a believable version of what made them ""tick."" The acting, writing and direction are startlingly good with only the least intrusive narration. Think low-budbet David Lean. I deducted one star only because they should have been given more time and resourses. I only hope a second series is given exactly that.",1247616000,23,551,5.0

3726343,5,B001O2UTT0,"This is an excellent series that puts these figures in the context of their time. For example, many people forget the connection between Napoleon and the French Revolution due to the way the subjects are typically presented. In the Napoleon episode you see the psychological portrait of a man who has the possibility of greatness ahead of him, but only if he is willing to take it. While the Revolution is what opens this opportunity to him, it also threatens to derail his ambitions due to political considerations. Love it. The Cortes, Richard the Lionheart and Attila episodes are just as good. Haven't watched the others yet.",1357344000,,629,4.88785046728972
3726344,5,B001O2UTT0,"Each 'Warrior""  is given roughly a 60 minute segment.  These mini movies are like historical drama but with the facts and information done right for a change.  Each individual is dealt with at a critical moment in the developement of their military careers.

With Napoleon, the only non Ancients or Middle Ages persona shown here we meet him at a critical moment during the siege of Toulon where he must prove himself for the first time. I have a little problem in referring to him as a warrior as Nappy was so much more than that, but here at least he was just a minor officers and he did lead from the front early on.  Richard the Lion Heart tries to secure The Holy Land against Saladin.  Attila must face the challenge of Aetius at the battle of Chalons.  Cortez must conquer the mighty, fearsome, and savage Aztec Empire at their Capital.

I could go on but the reader gets the general idea.  These are expertly done and well acted.  The production value while not big Hollywood budget, is still decent as these are BBC productions.  I would always prefer good acting and decent screen writing over big budget and historical innaccuracies which is often what we get from Hollywood these days.  This production goes to prove that just showing the historical facts as they are known to be makes for great drama.  You don't need to chnage history in order to make a good story.  One can only hope that some movie producers might take inspiration from this excellent series.  Hopefully there will be a second volume soon.",1355356800,,1522,4.605947955390334
3726345,5,B001O2UTT0,"I watched this series when it oringally aired. The Napoleon short was absoultely amazing... it is not only very well directed, but the acting blew average out of the water. I enjoyed the other shorts too, but seriously -- $30 bucks for the Napoleon piece is just a small, small price to pay for such quality.

Anyone who loves this character from history will be very moved by it.

Kudos to the max. Life is too short to review things that don't rock your world, and this one certainly did.",1334275200,2,490,4.433333333333334

3726348,3,B001O2UTT0,"Quite frankly, if it weren't for the sheer number of movies included in this pack, it would be a great disappointment.

""Hannibal: Rome's Worst Nightmare"" starring Alexander Siddig is without a doubt the best film included in this bunch, and it's not even ""officially"" included, but a bonus film.  It is perhaps the single most historically accurate TV/movie portrayal of ancient Rome I've ever seen, bested only by HBO's Rome in terms of aesthetics, and at 89 minutes, aside from a pointless one-off scene involving Imilce, Hannibal Barca's wife, in Hispania before they begin the campaign, is intensely crisp and fast-paced, while giving most events proper brevity and impact, complete with fitting music for dramatic effect and cut-aways giving information as to important historical figures, such as Hanno the Great, Quintus Fabius Maximus, Publius Scipio and his son, the future Scipio Africanus, Gaius Terentius Varro, Hasdrubal, Mago, Maharbal, etcetera.

Similarly, the film on the Shogun, following Tokugawa Ieyasu, is excellent, taut, and perfectly paced.  My only complaint is that it was done in English.  Despite the fact that pretty much all the others (except the one on Genghis Khan) are in English, I felt that this film could have benefitted far more from being in Japanese than not, though some of the lines spoken by the actor portraying Tokugawa Ieyasu, despite being in flawless English, sound as though they were truly Japanese.

The film on Genghis Khan is another rushed affair, which is done in Mongolian (or else some other Asian language) but is much less of a narrative like the others and more like a documentary, with the primary story being told by the narrator rather than the characters.  It's more accurate than the totally unrelated movie ""Mongol"", but not nearly as enjoyable.

The other ones are very disappointing, varying in quality, but none coming close to the level of excellence of the aforementioned three.  The film on Spartacus is horribly done, incredibly sparse on historical detail and accuracy, and pretty much just a vacant, pale re-creation of every other Spartacus production already done, with a far lower budget.

The Napoleon Bonaparte film was extraordinary in its concept of only portraying Napoleon's initial rise to significance in the military (and also, I feel, could have benefitted from being in French rather than English) but was too muddied, unclear, and scattershot.  We see and hear a lot of odd things reflective of the Great Terror and the political mood and climate of early Republican France, but very little expansion of this as to HOW it affects the events in the story or WHY, and ultimately suffering the same problem as in the French-Canadian 2002 miniseries ""Napoleon""---it doesn't show us anything special about Napoleon Bonaparte, but portrays him as ambitious, but average.

The Cortez film had such great potential, but (again, should have been in Spanish rather than English) was in my opinion overly rushed, and some questionable decisions made with the shooting (such as when Moctezuma and Cortez first meet, Moctezuma initially speaks his native language, but then BOTH start speaking English, while acting as if they cannot understand each other, using a native woman as interpreter.  The rest of it suffers from lack of details, and total lack of understanding as to context---why stuff is happening in what context is unknown, and situations treated with gravity are completely lost on the viewer because there is no context given as to WHY it has gravity.

The film on Attila was an utter catastrophe in my opinion.  We don't know anything about the Huns ethnically, and the only description would make them of apparent Asian descent.  Speculation places them to be Turkic, Indo-European, or Steppe nomads from modern-day east Russia.  Here, they are thickly, deeply Celtic, with Attila portrayed by Crateros!  As in, Rory McCann, the guy who played Crateros in the 2004 movie ""Alexander"", and Marcus Agrippa as Edeco!  As in, Allen Leech, the guy who played Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa in the second season of HBO's Rome.

While their portrayals were competent, Attila comes across not as a cunning genius or butcher here, but more a drunken oaf with an utterly arbitrary streak of cruelty that comes around the middle of the film.  He is thoroughly unremarkable.  He seems like a generic Hollywood-style leader who, after the fact, the writers remembered is supposed to be a feared figure, and so superficially added instances or dialogue showing him as brutal and vicious.  He's less like Attila and more like a greedy Robin Hood.

Making the film even more disastrous, aside from Attila coming across so dim and incompetent, is the story, or lack of one.  Almost nothing really happens beyond ideas that are executed and only sparsely tied together.

The filmmakers also seem to have completely forgotten that the Huns are essentially cavalry soldiers. They're said to be on horseback all the time, urinate on horseback, eat on horseback, fight on horseback and so on.

The Huns are NEVER on horseback in this ENTIRE film except for the opening sequence involving a diplomatic meeting.

The film on Richard I was unremarkable as well.",1306368000,3,5227,5.103286384976526

Much better acted than most documentaries, and the narrative voice-overs are kept to the absolute minimum.  The only thing slightly jarring is the inconsistency of the language barriers; sometimes characters will be speaking in their own language and having their words translated, while other times they'll both be speaking plain English.",1461888000,2,514,4.818181818181818

8329124,5,B001O2UTT0,"I'm a big history buff so I'm constantly watching documentaries on pretty much any historical period I can find. The episodes in this series, however, are a little bit different than the average documentary. The episodes aren't documentaries so much as they are little movies outlining a very specific event in the life of the portrayed historical character. The events actually happened, of course, so these aren't fictionalized accounts. I enjoyed this approach a great deal. There is a bit of narration at the beginning that introduces things but then it is pretty much a little movie or tv episode portraying the event. It's kind of hard to describe properly but if you like historical documentaries (and I LOVE them) and/or you like the stuff that the BBC puts out, you'll definitely like this.

The one on Napoleon is my favorite because it dramatized only the very early part of his life about how he got his start in the army as opposed to later on when he is emperor. I didn't have a lot of knowledge on his early life so it was interesting to see how Napoleon was actually shunned quite a bit for his novel ideas on artillery. The documentaries aren't all-encompassing of the historical figure's life but are very specific to one event.

You may recognize several of these actors from other BBC productions (i.e. the guy that plays Napoleon, Tom Burke, is also Athos on The Musketeers on the BBC and the actor who plays Richard the Lionheart was on The Tudors on Showtime).",1428278400,,1483,4.722007722007722
