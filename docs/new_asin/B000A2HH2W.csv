8611177,5,B000A2HH2W,This is an outstanding romantic comedy featuring Hero Angeles and Sandara Park.  They did a superb job in this film.  It is very light hearted and the story flows well.  It is a great film to escape with for a short while.  I hope to see them working together again in the future.,1127692800,,280,4.226415094339623
