4331106,5,B004CYVZ22,"This video was very easy to follow and apply to every day life. Additionally, I was blown away with the proven medical benefits that he speaks about that I know to be true as I once had a blood pressure of 210/138 and without knowing about Mr. Chopra, I have made some similar life changing attitude adjustments and have recently recorded readings of 110/80.",1357430400,4,358,4.609375
4331107,1,B004CYVZ22,"I hate to write a bad review of a Deepak Chopra title, but this is the third time I've ordered this DVD (from two different sellers, one on Amazon and two copies from someone on Ebay) and every copy has been defective. The DVD is split into four volumes and only the first volume will play. Can anyone tell me if they have a completely working copy that plays all four volumes? If so, which seller did you buy it from? I'd also just like to warn people that there must be a whole bunch of defective copies of this DVD floating around.",1338940800,5,534,4.194174757281553

8424449,4,B004CYVZ22,"Grow Younger, Live Longer in its recording form takes about two plus hours to listen to. The format involves Deepak Chopra talking to a live audience and then the head of his medical team covering the same idea from a more medical, scientific perspective. Chopra's program consists of ten steps, many of which are common to other health recommendations, such as eat a healthy diet, exercise and use some supplements. The place where Chopra differs largely is in his emphasis on the mind-body connection. He begins by saying that your expectations create your realities. Your mind is in every cell of your body.  There are three kinds of aging:  Chronological (based on when you were born), biological (based on the condition of your body, which can be evaluated by some 15 measurements such as bone density, aerobic capacity and body fat percentage) and pshchological aging (how old you feel). Of the three both biological and psychological aging can be changed. The first and most important step is to change your perceptions. Your reality is a result of your perceptions of reality. The medical model treats symptoms, not the underlying causes of illness. If you say you are younger you will be younger.

Meditation and getting sufficient and deep rest is also important. You should cultivate flexibility and creativity--embrace what happens to you and find creative ways to solve problems. Love is also important and is maintaining a youthful mind by asking questions and trying new things.

The most important point Chopra makes, in my view, is the need to change your perception of your reality. Think of yourself as a youthful, healthy person. In that way you will change your behaviors and your perception will become your reality.",1437091200,3,1738,5.024305555555555
8424450,5,B004CYVZ22,"This is a fun format, where first Deepak Chopra is inside, speaking to a small group of people about a particular facet of say physiology, or mental, spiritual, emotional health, etc., and then we see David Simon who is seated outside on a sunny day, speaking directly to the camera about whatever it is we just heard from Dr. Chopra.  David Simon, is the doctor on staff at The Chopra Center. His manner of speaking makes the delivery of valuable information so easy to take in, I could listen to him all day. He does not lose his train of thought, and is able to convey several ideas and examples in an easy manner that is short, concise, and totally understandable. Then we switch back to Dr. Chopra for the next bit of info. Then to Dr. Simon for HIS explanation of it. This DVD is so comprehensive that most people will not be able to remember everything from one viewing.  I wish I could buy the actual audio from this very DVD, with both speakers exactly as presented here, so I could listen to it in my car. The information presented here covers every area of health & well-being in a way that is easy to process, and I haven't ever heard anyone so  compelling as Dr. Simon.",1434412800,,1182,4.3881278538812785
8424451,5,B004CYVZ22,"Unfortunately my DVD only plays on my computer. On my Blu-ray player, I could only watch Volume 1.

Dr. Chopra is a pleasure to listen to.
I have long known that the mind is the master of our lives. That is the reason why I don't see conventional doctors and see my B.E.S.T. doctor instead. This DVD provides a large amount of information. It is a great DVD by a remarkable man. Thank you Deepak, it is an honor and a blessing to share this world with someone like you.

(For those who don't know, B.E.S.T. stands for Bio Energetic Synchronization Technique, and is said to be the medicine of the future)",1423699200,,604,4.383928571428571
