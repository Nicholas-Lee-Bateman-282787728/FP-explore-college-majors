1845981,4,B00008G8X5,"Although he is famous for creating some of the most memorable ""monster"" characters in movie history, people forget Boris Karloff was nothing like his movie image. he was born in England and very kindly. He was also an extremely versatile actor who could play any role. The Mr. Wong series is a good example. There is a 7 pack that is up for auction all the time. This contains only 4 of the 5 Karloff movies. But if you are a fan of the genre (which includes, Charlie Chan, Mr. Moto, Sherlock Holmes), this is a must have despite the fact it is an incomplete series. A good starter set and too pricey.",1176595200,5,601,4.327433628318584
1845982,5,B00008G8X5,Mr Wong was always a fave of mine. Karloff played him and so did Keye Luke. It's so nice to see this movie in print and at a good price! Thanks Alpha!,1088467200,3,150,3.71875

1846228,3,B00008G8X5,"These old movies should be put in perspective. the era that they were made was a growth and learning period. there were many small studios that put out a lot of movies.low budget mill movie studios. so! having said that this series, with ""BORIS KARLOFF"", AS ""MR  WONG"",is very entertaining to a fan of early detective series. i enjoyed all these old features films",1395964800,,364,4.6875
1846229,3,B00008G8X5,As a dedicated vintage movie buff of the mystery genra this black and white movie was a delight to watch. It is so campy it almost funny but by no means was this movie meant to be a comedy. Made during the era of the 1930's this B movie reflects the Hoillywood version of the venerated Asian detective style. It a 'hoot'.,1394928000,,321,4.193548387096774
1846230,4,B00008G8X5,Boris Karloff is the quintessential 'kill em with kindness' detective.  Always a step or two ahead of the law. I'd much rather watch an old movie than TV,1394582400,4,153,4.464285714285714
1846231,5,B00008G8X5,Very good B mystery thriller starring the fantastic Boris Karloff. There are three more Mr. Wong mystery movies. I suggest you watch them all.,1393113600,,142,4.958333333333333
1846232,4,B00008G8X5,"The big treat here is seeing Boris Karloff in a non-thriller role, getting to see him in another character.  Karloff works very smoothly in character.  No real surprises as far as story goes, you could probably switch in and out with any of the other ""detectives"" in the genre and Mr. Wongs ethnic background is barely a factor in the story. What made the character a little richer are the references he make to his schooling in Heidelburg and other colleges. Good film for a rainy/snowy Saturday afternoon.",1392940800,,507,4.75

1846235,4,B00008G8X5,"Although somewhat predictable in story line, it is still a pleasure to watch Boris Karloff as a character other than ""horror"" based. I enjoyed the classic  whodunit with my 8yr.old grandson and he also enjoyed it. Black and ehite movies are my favorites and this is no exception. I will watch it again.",1376784000,,302,4.69811320754717
1846244,5,B00008G8X5,Boris Karloff was a great actor in all his movies and shows.  In his Mr. Wong series he was great as this detective and reminded me of another great detective Charlie Chan.

Right up there with the top dectives of early t.v., such as Charlie Chan, and Sherlock Holmes. A great movie if your in to the old mystery, private eye movies. Even if your not, watch this movie and become Fan. Great movie, very entertaining.",1363305600,,389,4.492957746478873
1846249,2,B00008G8X5,"The Mystery of Mr. Wong, 1939 film

The movie starts with a view of a foggy bay. A man throws a package from a ship, another man in a boat retrieves it and then lands on a dock. He goes to a mansion and commands the maid. Does the maid have a secret? There is conflict in this house. That jewel has a curse on it. There is a party that night, Mr. Wong arrives. The owner was threatened with death! They play a game of charades. A man fires a gun, another man falls. But this is not play acting, Brendan is dead! The police are called, but they received the call twenty minutes before! Who tampered with the gun? The detective questions Harrison about his quarrel with Edwards. He won't talk. That letter in the safe is gone! Mr. Wong tests that letter, it has an unusual paper. The fatal bullet did not come from Harrison's pistol. It is a murder not an accident. Edwards was changing his will to disinherit his wife.

Detective Street questions the people while they are in a group. [Not realistic?] Wong questions the lawyer. Does Sing know something? A man and a woman talk in the garden. Will the maid send a letter to Wong? Smoking isn't healthy for one person. Who put a ladder by a window? Wong borrows a cigarette. The killer is in the house! Sing can't talk to Wong. Wong talks to Detective Street, who goes to the Edwards home. Where is that letter? Mrs. Edwards goes to see Wong, so does Harrison. Wong knows the facts about Stroganoff. Wong questions the gathered people and names the murderer. Was it the result of family revenge? Detective Street arrives to arrest the guilty. [Note the handshake with Wong.] ""Goodnight Mr. Wong!"" Then Wong explains how he solved the crime.

Can a stolen national treasure be returned to its rightful owner? This story follows the convention where a powerful and crooked or nasty man ends up as the murder victim. [An argument for good manners?] Followers of the ""Mr. Wong"" series will want to see this, but its not the best of the series.",1342828800,,1987,4.4532967032967035
1846250,5,B00008G8X5,"Whether you're looking for a taster of the Mr Wong Films OR the complete set, both of the six film versions are a better deal than this four film set.

By the way, only 5 (five) of the six films starred Boris Karloff.  For the sixth film Mr Wong apparently found the fountain of life and turned into the much younger Keye Luke - Charlie Chan's ""number one son"" in the Warner Oland series.",1291680000,2,388,4.22972972972973

1846253,1,B00008G8X5,"This very enjoyable flick featuring Boris Karloff as the crackerjack Chinese detective has certainly withstood the test of time, but this cheapjack release from Reel Enterprises will not. This is not even a factory pressed disc; it is a dvd-r with terrible picture & sound. They even have the company logo in lower corner of screen during film! This makes the Alpha version look like a Criterion release. I must advise all Wong fans to look elsewhere.",1182729600,2,451,4.87012987012987

If Peter Lorre (Rosenberg, Austria-Hungary [now Ruzomberok, Slovakia]) can be Mr. Moto ""Mr. Moto's Last Warning (1939),"" then Boris Karloff (Camberwell, London, England, UK) can be Mr. Wong.

Actually these six films are quite entertaining. I paid a little less, but they were on VHS. The DVDs being a set will save on shipping. They may last a little longer also. So put on your thinking hat and buy the set.",1504483200,,551,4.445544554455446

7983630,4,B00008G8X5,"Yes, Boris Karloff isn't remotely Asian, and they would have been much better off morally using an Asian actor, but the reality is that in that time and place, had the producers insisted, the movie would not have been made.  As it is, it's great fun.  Karloff IS (or was) a great actor, and a period mystery like this is huge fun.  Also of interest is the appearance of Lotus Long, an actual Asian actor.  She's gorgeous, a competent actress, and should have been given a larger part.  Born Lotus Pearl Shibata in New Jersey (according to that unimpeachable source, Wikipedia), she avoided internment in WW II by sticking to her stage name and passing as Chinese.",1483401600,,663,4.632478632478633

7983632,3,B00008G8X5,"Monogram Pictures was as racist as other studios of the day, casting British actors in the lead roles of Asian protagonists. These pictures aren't jewels and the stories are almost interchangeable with other detective movies and serials. However, I had never seen any of the Wong or Moto movies before and only remember Chan from movies broken up with commercials on television and the Fu Manchu tv series when I was home sick from elementary school.  So, I have liked getting a wider context.",1482883200,,493,4.869047619047619
