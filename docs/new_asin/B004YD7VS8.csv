4498975,5,B004YD7VS8,"Released years ago on DVD as ""Christmas Present"", this movie is an excellent portrait of a Christmas family reunion- warts and all.  Highly reccomended!

Note: Movie was filmed in about 1990.  I bought it at a 99 cent store in about 2004",1313971200,,237,4.595238095238095

4498977,1,B004YD7VS8,"Boring, trite, unimaginative and once again, boring.  Lame dialogue, monochromatic characters and missing anything resembling a plot.  Irritating kids and spoiled grandkids arrive at the house of grumpy grampa and overbearing catholic grandma.  Lots of bickering and petty insults.  One or two bedroom scandals are revealed.  It's all terribly ....boring.  I forced myself to finish this thing and later regretted wasting my 1 1/2 hours on this rubbish.",1483920000,,453,5.588235294117647

4498996,5,B004YD7VS8,Down to earth movie. Here things happen all year long but are blown out of proportion when this family gets together. We can all related.

4499014,1,B004YD7VS8,"... but I just couldn't.  This movie may have been ""released"" in 2011, but it was clearly shot in 1986, hitting every sour note from the '80s from the bad hair and fashion to the horrible decor (if I never see the color ""mauve"" again, it will be too soon).  The producers couldn't spare a can of paint to at least paint one of those dreadful ""super white"" walls a different color?  It would have gone a long way towards assuaging the viewer fatigue.  Some proper studio lighting would have been great, too; this whole film looks like it was shot under fluorescent ""shop"" lights.  As far as the story itself -- meh.  Very predictable and formulaic: a ""dysfunctional"" family comes together for the holidays, coincidentally just as every cliched family member's personal crisis hits its arc:  the ""perfect"" son about to hit burnout; the idealistic son who hasn't yet hit his stride; the daughter who started out well but was led astray; the other daughter who was a disappointment from the start; the bitchy rebellious daughter who has her come-to-Jesus moment.  How does it end?  I have no idea.  I stopped watching because these characters were so flat and boring I really couldn't care less.",1481932800,5,1191,4.737864077669903

4499025,4,B004YD7VS8,"After reading reviews I watched with expectations of bad acting and poor film quality. One reviewer recommended giving the film 30 minutes. I didn't need 30 minutes to decide I enjoyed watching the mother and father dynamics. This cute, little, low budget Christmas film was much better than some big budget movies I've seen with so-called well-known actors. I prefer the realism of the interaction between family members rather than special effects and perfectly decorated sets. The mother is a hoot and the father is well matched. It was like peeking through a window into a family's holiday weekend. I would recommend this movie if purely as a reminder there is some good in everyone's family, including your own.",1481068800,2,716,5.025210084033613
4499026,4,B004YD7VS8,"IMO the negative reviews here are unfair. This is NOT a sentimental feel-good Christmas movie. Thus, I understand that many people may not like this movie, because of its style. Not liking a movie's style/subject matter does not make it a bad movie.

I enjoyed this movie and consider it above average, although it seems to be a low-budget film with mediocre production quality.",1480982400,6,378,4.90625

The sibling bickering, the parent/child issues, all of it is pretty typical of larger families. The best parts of the movie come later, as people begin to accept each other, or at least come to terms. Essentially, the film equates to one of those horrible family reunions you imagine, but it actually turns out well in the end, and fairly realistically.

4499081,3,B004YD7VS8,"Even though this movie is low budget,the writing touched on several levels of dysfunction as well as love in a family.

Anyway, poor acting, very poor acting, but the arguing reminded me of most Catholic families over the holidays.  What's a holiday without drinking too much and at least one argument? The kids table cracked up me up. Watch if you have insomnia at 4:00 am and need a time waste until 6:00.",1387065600,,398,4.351351351351352

4499089,2,B004YD7VS8,Movie wasn't that great. Also an unknown cast. Hard to follow what was going on. Very disappointing movie. Not going to be a holiday classic.,1385683200,,141,4.68
4499090,3,B004YD7VS8,The movie has a good message about families with secrets and dysfunction but it was not a grade a movie.  I still enjoyed it - just because it was a Christmas movie.,1384905600,,165,4.15625
4499091,4,B004YD7VS8,"It is not bad acting at all. It's not full of action or peppy one liners, no one is seen using the lavatory and there isn't any scene changing music either.
It is a lot like what real families go through. I, am one who avoided exactly what this family exhibits in their holiday gathering. Angst, ire, jealousy....sibling rivalry, parental embarrassment I felt the actors performed remarkably believable characters, yep people in general are boring. So usually we watch movies that make us question ""does art mimic reality or vice versa?"" This one is too real to entertain the masses who actually live it. It did entertain me.",1383436800,4,625,4.796296296296297

4499095,1,B004YD7VS8,"For me, it started out badly within the first few minutes, and got increasingly worse. None of the characters were even remotely Irish, nor were they able to play the part convincingly. I say this being part Irish myself, and having lived through more than a few holiday dinner scenarios. I think there were more authentic Irish in the production staff.

This didn't *feel* authentic, either. It didn't feel like a 2011 film, more like the 80's or so. Like early-on when, what appeared to be a doctor, a man at the dinner table, got a notification on his PAGER, and had to go to the kitchen, to call it in by land line PHONE. In an age when even kids have their own cell phones, who does that any more???

Honestly, Although I watched it for free, through Amazon Prime, I couldn't watch it to the end, it was that bad. If I could give it ZERO stars, I would have, and that's time I won't ever get back. I certainly wouldn't pay money to rent it.",1356134400,2,945,4.303370786516854

I admit I was expecting a comedy not typical family relations, so I kind of liked it.
That said it was a low budget film, the acting was fair, the quality of the work was good & sets were well shot.
However it was shot in the 90's not the 80's - hence the reference to Kurt Cobain & the tree bark cure for cancer.
If you are going to hate on something or someone at least know why.
The divesting from South Africa that was more of a 70's & 80's thing,  Barclay's divested in 86.",1498435200,,557,3.8859649122807016
