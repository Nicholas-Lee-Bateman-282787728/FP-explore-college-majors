6380950,5,B00JLJ0B78,"Drones does not have anything to do with the image used for this movie. The movie itself is a good drama about the concerns and worries a drone crew might have while searching for an striking at terrorists using unmanned flying vehicles (drones). Eloise Mumford is excellent. There is not a lot of action, the drama takes place in a small trailer sized control room for the UAV. The psychological tension of deciding to strike at a suspected terrorist and knowing it was cause noncombatant fatalities is the core of the film. The sound quality did cause some problems, as the machinery noises were louder than the dialogue, but other than that it was a solid film.",1409961600,3,664,4.683760683760684

6380952,1,B00JLJ0B78,"Lord what a snore fest! No action at all in this flop, however we did get lot's of ""moral"" chit chat...which about sums up this movie.",1407196800,4,134,4.1923076923076925
6380953,3,B00JLJ0B78,"I am not sure what the DVD cover has to do with the movie. The story is basically a two man play. Airman Jack (Matt O'Leary) and Lt. Sue Lawson (Eloise Mumford) are stationed together in a remote Nevada site where they monitor Al Qaida activity and take out targets. Lawson is new and doesn't have her first kill while the airman is no stranger to killing.

The film evolves into a discussion of the morality of using drones to kill people, especially when they are surrounded by their family. It is basically a moral play that takes place in a hot desert metal hut with high tech equipment. The film holdS your interest as you anticipate them ""pushing the button."" Yes, a couple people drinking coffee, ordering pizza, joking around can take you and your family out without spilling a drop. Now that is technology.

F-bombs. Covered sex scene from 5 miles up. No nudity.",1405641600,8,871,4.576923076923077
6380954,5,B00JLJ0B78,very well done drama.  Really brings the emotions to life  ----that it isn't just a video game.,1509321600,,95,4.529411764705882
6380955,1,B00JLJ0B78,Pure anti-American propaganda..Took me half way through to see it. Liberal bs.,1507852800,7,78,5.583333333333333

6380957,1,B00JLJ0B78,"This movie was bad. Simple as that. No action and drama was predictable. Some moments the acting was cringe worthy. You can clearly see what the director's opinion is on drone warefare, and it is a very uninformed one at that. The way the Air Force is portrayed in this movie as haphazard, trigger happy baby killers would fit the viewpoint of a radical left wing conspiracy theorist who believes in chem-trails and lives down by the river in a van. Inaccuracies aside, if you are familiar with the RPA community I recommend you watch this film for a good laugh.",1477785600,2,562,4.574257425742574
6380958,4,B00JLJ0B78,"While a little contrived at times, this movie does a good job of showcasing a single drone mission.  The protagonists discuss, argue and persuade each other regarding the validity of the mission, and in so doing lay out for the audience the kind of choices that must be made any time these seemingly impersonal weapons are brought into play.",1474761600,,341,4.779661016949152
6380959,2,B00JLJ0B78,"Not at all what I expected...although it does deal with some psychological issues surrounding the use of drones, I found it overdone and depressing.",1462233600,,148,5.208333333333333
6380960,1,B00JLJ0B78,"This film is, in my opinion a total waste of money. The plot was very boring and even though I persisted and watched it all the second time around I can find NOTHING good to say about it. Absolute rubbish!",1433116800,,205,4.15

6380962,3,B00JLJ0B78,kinda boring I would not buy if I could go back. it's just 2 people in a little trailer pressing buttons and having hardship with dropping a bomb on people,1422057600,,155,4.2
6380963,1,B00JLJ0B78,"One of the most absurd movies I hve ever seen! What bothers me the most is how this portrays how the military operates, especially the RPA program. This movie is an embarrassment. Please do not waste your time on this one. Its 1 1/2 hours of your life you will never get back if you watch this movie.",1417824000,4,300,4.189655172413793

8652166,1,B00JLJ0B78,This is the worse movie.  The volume is horrible.  You can't hear the dialog because of the Erie music.  This is not how our military works.  This is simply ridiculous.,1519084800,,168,4.5

8652169,1,B00JLJ0B78,"Poor acting, improbable sequence in the ""kill chain"", improper rank of personnel for positions supposedly held. Obviously no actual military advisors consulted in this third rate production. Don't  waste your time on it!!",1513555200,,221,5.696969696969697
8652170,1,B00JLJ0B78,Horrible!  Terrible acting from 2 B list actors.  After listing to the airmen run his gums for an hour you get to see her fake crying instead of doing her job... To far fetched to believe.  Even in the movies.  Don't waste your time.,1513468800,5,233,4.2272727272727275

8652173,3,B00JLJ0B78,"It gives you something to think about.  Where so we draw the line with morality?  We have a suspected AL Qaeda leader leader attending a birthday party.  The order is to take him out regardless of the  collateral damage...children and wives.  By taking out the alleged leader without proof, are we protecting our interests or doing the bidding of a foreign government.  I'm sure that those who are responsible for pushing the button today are faced with the same decision as fighter pilots or door gunners in the Vietnam war.  We would see a flash in the foliage and once we retaliated and the flash was no more, we assumed a kill but it was quite antiseptic...much different than being up close and personal.  Following orders, or refusing to follow orders, comes with a price and that was the main struggle in this movie.  For some, it's an internal struggle, for others it's a blip on the screen.  This is by no means an endorsement for Al Qaeda or Isis but some discretion needs to be considered or we are no better than they are and that's what the movie prompts us to think about..",1510444800,,1087,4.528205128205128
