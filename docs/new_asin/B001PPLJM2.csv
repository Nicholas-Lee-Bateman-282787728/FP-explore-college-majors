8334220,4,B001PPLJM2,"The HD video quality of this DVD is absolutely superb!! The only thing I didn't like was some of the ""Hollywood"" effects. This knocked it down to 4 stars.
Would have like to seen more of the natural environment rather then ""Hollywood effects of over drama.
There was no reason to have people in this show at all,  the woman being put in the scenes for over drama was really disappointing to me.
One of my favorite shots was a full grown King Cobra swimming across a beautiful blue and white pool.
I was mesmerized by the grace of the snake forgetting momentarily about the devastating affects of its venom.
Another great scene was a camera mounted on a snake and watching how the snake moves on the ground.
I highly recommend this DVD the footage is worth it.",1437782400,,759,4.460431654676259

8334222,4,B001PPLJM2,"This is a nice Snake Blu-ray DVD, good information on different snakes  and nice picture quality shows the snakes in colorful detail  close up of scale and face of snakes. Details on different types of snakes how they live and more.",1397692800,,232,4.634146341463414
8334223,5,B001PPLJM2,"The Beauty of Snakes seems to generate either love or hate. If you're expecting to learn a lot about snakes, this is not the video for you. In fact, you're better off reading a book for that.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-Encyclopedia-of-Snakes/dp/069113295X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New Encyclopedia of Snakes</a>&nbsp;would be a good starting point. Chris Mattison, the author, is a master of photographing snakes, so it's almost as pretty as the video, and far more informative. And he is meticulous in verifying the information he passes along, rather than simply repeating the old nonsense as so many books do.

That said, this is one of the most beautiful videos you are likely to see about snakes. As others have said, the videography is stunning. If you're just looking to appreciate snakes for their visual appeal, you'll love The Beauty of Snakes. Tastes vary, but I find the narration non-intrusive and appropriate, where some apparently find it dull. On the positive side, there is no incorrect information being passed along, that I can recall. That makes this video almost unique, since most nature shows are even worse than most books, when it comes to being riddled with nonsense and false information, especially when it comes to snakes.

I have to say, though.. as much as I like this video, you'd have to be out of your mind to pay the prices these non-Amazon vendors are asking for new copies of this disc. At the moment, there is one new copy listed for $1,871.38, while you can pick up a used copy from $3.69. I guess some people REEEEEALLY love this video!",1374192000,,1638,5.1773584905660375
8334224,5,B001PPLJM2,"If your into snakes, want to learn more about snake or look for an introduction to Blu ray this is the Blu ray for you. The carity is wonderful and the colors are rich. I have handle snakes for over 20 years and the information is on point. They focus on snakes in the wild. Snakes make good pets but this doent highlight snakes in captivity.",1360627200,,342,4.196969696969697
8334225,5,B001PPLJM2,"If you have a grandson obsessed with reptiles as I do, this video will satisfy even the strongest cravings for information about and viewing of all types of snakes.  Really, after the tenth viewing, we are still learning things that we missed while mesmerized by the photography.  I highly recommend this for the NOT faint of heart as it is graphic, just right for young boys who like prey being chased and consumed.",1331251200,2,416,4.684931506849315
8334226,2,B001PPLJM2,"There's no denying that the hi-def footage here is gorgeous, but The Beauty of Snakes has some of the worst narration I have ever heard on a documentary. The robotic woman's voice is completely emotionless and entirely in monotone. She conveys no interest, no enthusiasm, no emotion at all. It sounds like she is utterly bored with what she is saying. As a result, the viewer also feels weighed down by boredom. It is hard to stay interested in this doco because of this.",1287100800,2,471,4.619047619047619
8334227,2,B001PPLJM2,"This is ridiculous, the narrator didn't mention anything worthwhile, the quality - although stunning...doesn't make up for the lack of information present here. This is a documentary for 10 year olds.",1261180800,,200,5.483870967741935
8334228,5,B001PPLJM2,"I was lucky enough to have seen this show in high def via Dish Network. I loved it and copied it onto a DVD. My DVD recorder only records in low definition however... This is a show that, to be truly appreciated, must be seen in high definition. Seeing the incredible detail of their skin and eyes is just incredible. So, as soon as I realized it was available in the Blu-Ray format I didn't hesitate to order it.

Snakes are among the most feared and misunderstood animals we share this planet with. As this documentary shows, they really can be quite beautiful creatures! The footage is awe-inspiring and educational.

I highly recommend it!!!",1259625600,6,645,4.649122807017544
8334229,5,B001PPLJM2,"I like this documentary.  It shows how intriguing snakes are.  They're so beautiful.  People have fear of those things, they should really understand they're just animals.  God created any animals, including snakes.",1259280000,,215,5.625
