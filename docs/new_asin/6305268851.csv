1002983,5,6305268851,"I got a chance to preview Ray Bradbury's ""The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit"" here in Chicago in early March ('99).  I had no idea this picture would have been so remarkable!  There's more pure joy...(that's the  best word to describe it)...in this film than a lot of folks experience in  an entire month!  I can't reccommend it enough.  Get it!  Devour it!  Stuart Gordon out did himself! Not to mention it's as entertaining for a  seven year old as it is for someone who's seventy.  (I mean that as a  compliment!)  It's thoroughly entertaining.  No wonder Hollywood neglected  to give this film a proper run at the box office.  I was lucky enough to  catch it on the big screen and I'll definitely add it my collection and  turn as many people on to it that I can!",924220800,2,761,4.398550724637682

1003181,5,6305268851,"I had been looking for this DVD for years: unfortunate that Disney had made the film available only through the Movie Club. I thank the seller for providing me with a movie with many of my favorite actors!

The classic Ray Bradbury story was released in 1998 with Edward James Olmos, Esai Morales, Clifton Gonzalez Gonzales, Joe Mantegna and the venerable actor Gregory Sierra (who was replaced by Olmos in Miami Vice, coincidentally).
 The cast is stellar in film of good clean fun as five men find a suit that makes their dreams come true one summer night in East L.A. Each actor shines in his role: I won't tell you who they portray, just enjoy these masters at work.

I applaud Disney for making a film that shows Hispanic Americans in a positive light without any gang, drug nonsense and negativity: just a movie that coiluld take place anywhere with anyone playing these characters. It's another feel-good Disney classic that chases the blues away! Magic!!!",1369612800,2,963,4.789156626506024

I think the fact that it had been fashioned after a play that ran for many years is what gives this film that extra richness common to movies based on plays: all the bugs are worked out.

Anyone who wants to watch a film that is like the GOOD old-fashioned films of by-gone years will enjoy THE WONDERFUL ICE CREAM SUIT.  This is my favorite movie, one that I would not feel ashamed to share with any.",1276128000,,667,4.1796875

1003260,5,6305268851,"This film is truly one of those sleepers that you never hear about and stumble upon.  I stumbled when I found the VHS in a bargain bin for $5.00.  It was one of the best $5.00 purchases I've ever made!

It's visually beautiful and colorful, the acting is great, the music fantastic, the story is sweet, yet it makes a statement.  And my boys love it!

I've always been a Ray Bradbury fan and this just shows how well his vision can be translated to film IF you stay true to it. I only hope that someone puts it on DVD, so that they can restore the brilliance to the film that fades a little with VHS.

And if you don't laugh during the bar scene, then you have no sense of humor! I must say that my favorite character is Edward James Olmos' Vamanos.  He amazes me with his range and ability as an actor.

Watch it with your family and enjoy.

1003261,4,6305268851,"and of all the movies that have been made from his fiction, this one is closest to his own real voice. Goofy, exuberant, surreal, naive, humane and affirmative...quintessential Ray.",1145923200,,181,5.275862068965517
1003262,5,6305268851,"I love this dumb movie.  It's goofy.  It's silly. It's over-acted.  It's unreal.  It's so positive!  It's downright affirmative.  It's fantastic.  It's not like any other movie I've seen.  I laughed out loud in the first scene, and kept smiling all the way through.

The story involves five guys who have nothing in common except their bad fortunes and their size.  They pool their meagre money and buy a suit that turns out to have the magical effect of making each man's fantasy come true while he wears it.  As they eagerly take turns wearing the suit, they see and celebrate the miraculous transformation in each of their new friends.  The point being that they really have become friends -- in just one evening, they develop a profound and uplifting camaraderie by witnessing and affirming each others dreams.  It has definitely got a message, but this movie is so quirky and lighthearted that it's about as preachy as a cream puff.

Some of my favorite features of this movie are those that give it its surreal flavor:  the mariachi band that appears in scene after scene;  the weird light that illuminates the dark nighttime scenes;  the exaggerated acting; the exaggerated slow-motion fist fight (It's a hoot!); the youngest man's ardent desire for the beautiful girl, expressed as a wish to meet her parents;  the psychadelic opening credits.  Other things I like just because I like them:  that one guy's dream really is just to have a good time;  that the bum has more money than any of the others;  that mariachi makes a great soundtrack.

Many of the movies I like most play with the theme of the empowering effect of fantasy:  ""They Might Be Giants"", ""The Fisher King"", even ""The Music Man"".  Add ""The Wonderful Ice Ceam Suit"" to that list.",1138147200,7,1754,4.728476821192053
1003263,5,6305268851,Man I loved watching this movie on television a few years back and I've been searching for it on DVD and then I found it but it was on VHS so I guess I'll have to go out and by a VCR but I feel like Im going back in time to bad this wasn't a block buster hit then I would find it at Wal-Mart,1110153600,,291,3.4242424242424243
1003264,5,6305268851,"This is one of those films that you could enjoy with your children, with your friends or on a date.  I know, some of you guys might be thinking, ""Why would I want to watch a film about a suit made out of ice cream?""  Well, first of all, the suit isn't actually made of ice cream.  It is so perfectly white y bien suave (smooth) looking that it is comparable to vanilla ice cream.  Also, this suit possesses magical powers.  Whoever wears it, their deepest dreams will be realized.  First, five men, who are definitely not made of money must pool their funds ($20 each) to purchase it from the clothing shop.  Little do they know, how their luck can change in only a day's time!!!!!  Also, they must share it--each only allowed to wear it for a short time.

This film has a wonderful musical score, the acting is strong and it is great to see a movie with such a positive and triumphant spirit.  Also, the lead characters are all well known and well respected Latino actors.  How wonderful to see such a positive film where none of them are drug dealers or hustlers.  This film crosses the boundaries of race, ethnicity and generation to appeal to the young and the young of heart.  Check it out!!",1107561600,11,1196,4.381818181818182
1003265,5,6305268851,"The premise of this movie is quite unusual, five men pool their last few dollars to purchase a brilliant ""ice cream"" white suit that will empower them. Humorous, heartful, musical, silliness and action!

The men, Bien Azul, Martinez, Dominguez, Gomez and Daminos schedule the suit for an hour on the first night. Each takes his turn at wearing the suit, and reluctantly share it with the very filthy, smelly street urchin, as he contributed also.
They take extreme pride in the suit and the urchin must be bathed, hair cut, and he needs specific instructions: He is not to fall down, no standing under trees with birds in it, no drinking wine, no smoking, don't eat juicy tacos. One other request: don't go to the Red Rooster where the fat one, Ruby Escadrillo is because she would sit on his lap and crush the suit, put powder and lipstick on it and most of all she has a mean boyfriend ""El Toro"", the monster.

Well, the fun begins when he goes to the Red Rooster and does everything they told him not to do! The battle begins as they try to ""protect"" the beloved suit.

There are clever slow motion shots during the action and fighting at the Red Rooster. Entertaining, fun, clean movie!
This is an all star cast of talented Hispanic actors, Esai Morales, best known for ""La Bamba"", Edward James Olmos, Liz Torres, and Italian actor, Joe Mantegna, etc. There is plenty of music to fill this humorous movie. It's great for the entire family because it is clean and decent ...Rizzo",1024963200,17,1482,4.584905660377358
1003266,5,6305268851,"I refuse to even contemplate living in a world in which Ray Bradbury does not exist.  For within Bradbury's mind resides an entire universe filled with metaphor and dreams; galaxies teeming with life and love and poetry, with tales told and untold of such things as this world has never known and would never know, except for that magic that flows from his heart, through his brain and out through his fingertips, where they are born on the keys of his typewriter.  And within that very same, ever fertile imagination, that wellspring of creativity, the words were formed, in a rush! and a swirl!, then tempered on Bradbury's mental forge of the fantastic, that ultimately came together and burst! forth as ""The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit,"" a transporting film directed by Stuart Gordon.
Gomez (Joe Mantegna) lives in the barrio; a poor man, except in spirit, for Gomez has dreams, ah, such dreams! of something better, of a better life, of the magic that can happen if you but want it badly enough and will it to!  And Gomez knows how to make that magic happen.  There is a store, a certain clothing store, and in the window there is a suit; not just any suit, but a magnificent white suit, as white as the clouds, as white as the snow that falls in the mountains.  Oh, such a suit!  The kind of a suit that can make the man who wears it anything he wants to be.  And the price?  The cost of this bottle holding a genie who can grant your every wish, your every desire?  $100.00!
Gomez has $20.00...
But, he has a plan!  If he can only find four others like himself-- others with dreams but no means-- and of equal size and weight (and, of course, $20.00), they could buy the suit together, and share the magic!  Ah, such a plan for such a suit!  For one day at a time, taking turns, they could each wear the magnificent suit that's as shiny and bright and as white as ice cream; and for a time be able to realize their dreams.  And so, very quickly, or even sooner, at that very moment! Gomez puts his plan into action, driven on by the vision he holds in his mind's eye of himself, wearing that wonderful ice cream suit.
Ray Bradbury wrote the screenplay for this film, which he adapted from his own play of the same title, and this is vintage Bradbury.  Under the auspices of director Gordon, the film successfully captures the very essence of Bradbury the writer, Bradbury the poet, Bradbury the genius, Bradbury the beautiful dreamer; this man from Illinois, who walks with kings and dines with gods, and dares to dream such dreams.  More than a film, this is a celebration of life; an acknowledgement of the joys of living, captured exuberantly in music and song, poetry, performance and, of course, in Bradbury's words-- those exquisite, noble, transcendent words, born of some special, personal, inner muse-- that flow so splendidly in time with the rhythm of his heart and conjure up the images of his singular vision.  All of which Gordon manages to grasp, grab hold of and transfer so resplendently to the silver screen.
The performances are first rate, beginning with Mantegna as the indomitable Gomez, who believes he can rule the world when wearing that wonderful suit; Esai Morales, as Dominguez, who dreams of enchanting beautiful women with his music and songs, and knows he can with the suit; Gregory Sierra, as Villanazul, who looks to the suit for the words of hope and encouragement he can take to his people; Clifton Gonzalez-Gonzalez, as Martinez, hoping that the suit will attract the girl of his dreams; and Edward James Olmos, as Vamanos, who just wants to have a good time!  Respectively, their portrayals are alive, and with their collective breath, they bring this film to life, as well.
The supporting cast includes Liz Torres (Ruby Escadrillo), Sid Caesar (Sid), Howard Morris (Leo), Lisa Vidal (Ramona), Mike Moroff (Toro) and Mercedes Ortega as the beautiful Celia Obregon.  From the opening credits, awash with dazzling color and brilliant imagery, ""The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit"" is an exhilarating, unique treasure to be embraced with the heart; a masterpiece of delights to be watched again and again.  And most importantly, it honors the man who created it all, Ray Bradbury; a man who is, himself, invested with the same kind of life and joy his film brings to the screen.  It's a fitting tribute to the inimitable Bradbury, Purveyor of Happiness, Magistrate of Joy.
--Then through an open window blew
the winds of night, and creatures,
dark they were and golden-eyed;
and calling to the Son of Kong they whispered
""Something wicked this way comes!""
And then, a sound of thunder!
She rises!  She rises!
And from twenty thousand fathoms came
the dragon,
as if summoned by his master from the deeps;
and the Man from Illinois
held his sword above the crowd,
the blue flame cracked and sparked
and leapt into our bodies! then,
""Farewell, my friends,"" said he
as on the dragon's back he mounted,
""Live forever!""
""Live forever!""
Live forever...

I know, it's not your typical film, and the conflicts aren't your typical angst-driven film fare, but it's fun,  and it's not ashamed of the fact that it's fun.
