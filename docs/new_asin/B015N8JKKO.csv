7443969,5,B015N8JKKO,"Amazing! This film is a must for a Cristiano Ronaldo fan. It exceeded all my expectations. The filmmakers did a great job of completely staying out of the narrative. There are no interview-style shots; nothing scripted. You completely forget there is a camera crew involved. The pace of the film and tight editing make you lose track of time. There are no slow moments or changes in the flow. The content is very clear and, even with numerous flashbacks, there is no confusion. It is a very personal film without being awkward. ""Real and honest"" is the best description. You can't help but go through the same emotions as people involved. Any CR7 fan would already know all the factual information in the film, but watching it makes you feel as if you've now lived through all those events yourself.",1468022400,3,799,4.714285714285714
7443970,4,B015N8JKKO,I enjoyed it but expected more football.  Very interesting person.  This was more about his life and family.,1467849600,,108,4.944444444444445

7443979,3,B015N8JKKO,"This is an homage to Ronaldo. Don't expect anything controversial or revealing. This is a sanitized biography. There's go to be a lot more to his story that is not revealed here.

That said, it was enjoyable to watch. Ronaldo is a world-class athlete.",1461542400,,251,4.704545454545454

7443986,5,B015N8JKKO,"Awesome. Shows the struggles of being a pro athlete and the relationship Ronaldo has with his family, friends, fans, players (including Messi which was dope) and especially his Son. The love he has for his son is the definition of a great father. Nothing but respect for the man.",1455321600,,279,4.714285714285714
7443987,3,B015N8JKKO,"The more interesting story is buried under the sport:  A young man returns from service in Portugal's Angolan war and tries to raise a family under the influence of alcohol.  His abused wife laments a fifth pregnancy and doesn't know how she and her family can survive poverty, neglect and abuse.  The fifth child takes an interest at age 12 in football, finds he's good at it, and perhaps uses the sport as a way to escape his family's miserable life and fill the empty feelings he has for an inebriated father he can never really know.  All the energy he turns to football in the end turns him into one of the world's highest paid and most respected players, resources he uses to try to save his father and now similarly drunken brother, and to create for himself the father-son relationship he never had through sole custodianship of the offspring of a one-night stand.  Instead we get Ronaldo vs Messi for best footballer of the year.",1454976000,6,938,4.592814371257485

7443994,5,B015N8JKKO,One of the best parts is when his son gets really shy when he gets the chance to say hello to Messi. It would be funny to see what his son thinks of that encounter when he is old enough to know that his own father is just as great as Messi!,1451174400,,240,3.6346153846153846
