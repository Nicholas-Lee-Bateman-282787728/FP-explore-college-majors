1722308,3,B0000687CY,"Interesting how a mafia hitman can just openly confess to all this sort of thing...

Overall if you like these sorts of documentaries you will enjoy it....",1140652800,,155,4.7407407407407405
1722309,5,B0000687CY,"Quite interesting documentary about Richard Kuklinski, who whacked people for the Gambino Crime family and killed anyone who could testify against him & also set up his own ""kill for money"" operation. Although I was sympathetic to his ""wanting to take care of his family"", but truly the guy was sick & should have been given the death penalty.

The stories of him doing contract hits are really interesting & it was even funny to know that one of his accomplices (who he later killed) used a ""Mr. Softee"" Ice Cream truck while going out on contract hits.

It's a good documentary although a bit shocking.

I recommend it.",1093305600,15,621,4.678899082568807
1722310,5,B0000687CY,"I first picked up this title when I was browsing through the ""new movie"" section at blockbuster about a year ago.  I was looking for a mafia-type movie and I ended up leaving the video place pleasantly suprised.  The title gives an in-depth look into the life or Richard Kuklinski, a family man on one side, and heartless mafioso on the other.  Kuklinski is featured almost the whole time in the documentary; only a few other people (like the agent that brought him down) are interviewed.  He gives the viewers a sense of motivation for why he went into a life of crime, which stemmed from an abusive, heartless and non-loving family.  He also goes into his different methods of murder (poison was his favorite; non-messy and hard to trace).  We also see a side of him in which he regrets a handful of the murders.  It really moved me when he talked about how he gave one man an hour to pray before he killed him and how he regrets going through with it.  If you want a documentary that will move you and inform you at the same time, The Iceman is what you should be watching tonight.",1084752000,25,1084,4.385
1722311,5,B0000687CY,"This is a must have dvd, if your a fan of the mafia or hitmen then you'll love this. I didn't find it chilling like the other fellow reviewers did, instead I found it to be highly entertaining and very interesting. A great buy!",1060041600,3,227,4.181818181818182
1722312,5,B0000687CY,"There are moments in this video that are truly bone chilling.
One of them being when the doctor questions Mr. Kuklinski about weather or not some people he encountered in Georgia really deserved to die. By the end of his reply,I felt like the temprature in my livingroom had dropped below freezing.

I have no idea why I would want this forever on a DVD, because I got chills up my spine during each story. As you watch this man speak about his ""past"", you see he just doesn't think it's wrong or he was wrong with what he did. In a way, maybe he's right.
It scares you to think there's more of ""him"" out there like this, but then you remember, ""Oh yeah, I pay all my debts! Whew, I'm okay!""

Oddly he had heart for his family and children and not in a overtly creepy creepy way. His methods of killing and disposal are horrifying.

1722343,5,B0000687CY,My husband likes to watch movies or TV shows about the Mafia. The Iceman was excellent .........to see a person confess to all the killings he did.

1722344,3,B0000687CY,"Kuklinsky's life started out unpromisingly. Physically abused by both parents and sibling to a young murderer he seemed to be at the mercy of his environment until he developed the strength to beat a neighborhood tormentor to death with a cue stick.
Crime operations had a use for him and it turned out he had it in him to become possibly the most celebrated known contract killer.
If there was any job related stress, he was unable to relieve it with shop talk at home.
Long about retirement age he made a few moves that put himself at risk.  Maybe on some level he saw himself coming out of the cold this way.
We can thank HBO in part for giving him the opportunity to talk about the old days.",1380153600,,695,4.346153846153846

1722361,4,B0000687CY,"I got interested in the DVD because of an article in my home-town paper, the Bergen Record. The DVD gives an in-depth look into the life of Richard Kuklinski, aka the ""Iceman"". It was scary to think someone so heartless & cold-blooded could have been living so close to me. On one hand he was a family man, but on the other hand it showed why he went into life of crime & the methods he used for murder, such as poison, guns, and other weapons. His parents were abusive & non-loving.
The agent who brought him down is a friend of my family.
One ironic thing was that the ""Iceman"" & I have one thing in common--the same birthay, April 11.

The guy you can actually like - intelligent, and he has a great sense of humor.
The story itself is frightening.
But after the documentary was released - it turns out that he, or the producers
were exaggerating a bit. I don't mind this...the story and the way it was put together

One wonders how  a person can be so totally devoted to his family and yet carry out the murderous acts without a second thoughts.  A lot of viewer's questions are answered but many remain, also others are added.  You will want to read more about Richard Kuklinski and his role in the mafia and his facinating life.

1722373,5,B0000687CY,"This is the HBO home video DVD- 'Confessions of a Mafia Hitman'. It's a documentary that features different people interviewing Richard Kuklinski as he describes his life and crimes. Part 1 is from 1992 and part 2 is from 2001. Both are very interesting and a firsthand look at anti-social personality disorder...

 Over the span of these years between interviews Richard seemed to have gotten worse. He talks so matter of factly about his crimes and seems pretty honest about everything he's done though he claims most were just for business purposes. We get to see there is more to this story and hear from him about his dysfunctional early home life, his murders, his family and his life with the mafia. We also get to hear about the one friend Kuklinski trusted who ended up setting him up and turning him in.

There's 2 iceman DVD's available and this one has about the same information in it as the other one. Slightly different camera angles between them but for the most part they were pretty much the same material other than the other DVD having some extra information with a psychiatrist which was better in my opinion. The other DVD 'The Iceman Interviews' has the one with the psychiatrist which is the only reason I prefer it to this DVD. Other than that these were good interviews and a truly interesting and disturbing look into the mind of Richard Kuklinski. 4.5 stars.",1198972800,6,1386,4.695473251028806

1722375,5,B0000687CY,"This is a pretty amazing DVD.  I first caught this back in the early nineties when it was on HBO.  This guy had it rough growing up.  It transformed him into a non-feeling monster of a human being.  Although he's not a serial killer, he's able to kill without a care in the world, no feeling's what so ever.

Had this information been contained in the 'description' of the DVD comprising only two interviews then I could have avoided the clear waste of money of buying them twice.  The second DVD was all I needed and I could then have purchased something else with the money saved.  In short the DVD ""the iceman : Confessions of a Mafia Hitman"" ought to be removed from publication entirely and only the second DVD ""the iceman interviews"" (comprising both the interviews of the former DVD together with the third interview of 'The Iceman and the Psychiatrist') remain available for sale.",1193270400,13,957,4.823170731707317

However, I strongly recommend that you read ""The Iceman, Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer.""  This will give you insight to his childhood and explain the reasons why he has little to no feelings.

Personally, I have great sympathy for the man and the way he was raised.  In summary, I don't see how he could have been any different that he is; given his childhood.",1174348800,,656,4.470588235294118

1722384,4,B0000687CY,"Richard Kuklinski, also known as The Iceman, has killed over 125 people in his time as a mafia contract killer. In this documentary he talks about getting started with the mafia and several hits that he carried out. Listening to him tell the stories you can't help but think of things you've seen on television like The Sopranos... but this stuff actually happened. (Find out why they call him the ""iceman"".)

Kuklinski talks about his childhood and his abusive parents. He talks about his theory that ""nice guys finish last"". He says that when he was younger he wanted to be left alone and to leave people alone but they kept bothering him. So he got a metal pipe and beat up a group of 6 guys. From then on he'd established his motto ""If you hurt someone first, they'll leave you alone.""

Listening to Kuklinski talk is a bit mesmerizing. He's very deadpan and entirely unemotional. When asked how he felt about killing someone he says ""I don't."" and it's easy to believe after listening to him talk. This is definitely a DVD to rent, unless you're really interested in listening to descriptions of murders over and over.

Kuclinski, just as with all psychopaths, was born without the feelings the rest of us possess. When asked how he felt about murdering people, he said, ""I don't."" We should not doubt him as he is a moral and emotional void. Predictably, his childhood was harsh and brutal. He was bullied by others, and it only stopped once he began beating them back. The retaliation never ended until he was finally incarcerated. As an adult, violence never bothered him and became an acceptable part of his life. Killing was his root to power and control. As a hit man, he went from the gutter to economically fulfilling the American dream. His motto was ""good guys will finish last,"" but, luckily for us all, he was wrong as soon he will die in prison. He refuses to repent or apologize, and there is no doubt that he will be welcomed warmly below once his time on earth is finished.",1152662400,8,1044,4.558510638297872

I have an interest in Mob/Mafia fiction (film) and non-fiction (book), but was disappointed with these documentaries.

The killer is not much of a talker, and the interviewers don't really get much out of him.

Yes, he killed people im shocking ways, but this could have been established in 10 minutes.

The 'films' contain a handful of photographs of real crime scenes, and some poor reconstructions.

It was interesting to see a killer talk about his job, and also interesting tha one of the first things he said is that he was beaten by his father (so are we meant, therefore, to now think that it's not his fault that he turned out as he did?!).

When i received my order of The Iceman Confessions of a Maffia Hitman this morning from Stephs Closet i couldn't wait to pop it in. The packaging was great, a box and even bubble wrap. Unfortunately, there was a 2 inch strip of security film running top to bottom on the right side of the jacket along with 1 running left to right on the top. Now, i am a master at peeling that stuff off after all these years but this wadnt film. It was basically scotch tape. After doing the very best i could to remove it, knowing it was going to peel the case, i got it off and sure enough now there are white spots all over the jacket where its been ripped. I am very upset to say the least. I think that its absolutely ridiculous that i can order something brand new, have it shipped to my residence, boxed and bubble wrapped and i cant even guarantee that it will be flawless before i even play it.

7963645,3,B0000687CY,"Serving multiple life sentences for the murder of over a hundred people, mafia enforcer and contract killer Richard Kuklinski recounts his life in two HBO specials. Serving almost as a biography, the documentaries cover his life, but the highlight is two extended interviews that Kuklinski, absent of any remorse, recounts in graphic detail his various methods of murder. Would have worked better as one full length feature since both of the specials seem to cover the same ground with some obvious discrepancies. Still, a mesmerizing portrait of a dangerously alluring killer.
