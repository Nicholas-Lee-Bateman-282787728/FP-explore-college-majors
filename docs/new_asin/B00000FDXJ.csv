1213712,5,B00000FDXJ,"Together with ""Honor Among Thieves"", this one is usually considered the weakest of his Euro-ones, but I like them both a lot. Bronson's good as the bewildered man falling into the hands of Perkins'  scheming doctor. Now, Charlie's often been accused of sleepwalking through  his movies, but that's certainly not the case here. -On the contrary; his  character must have been a very interesting one for him to play, I'm sure.  Perkins on the other hand looks bored. This is an oldfashioned, rather  talky thriller, so don't expect much in the violent action department. -And  that's partly why it's so good; more acting, less fighting. The whole film  is pretty much set in one house; once they get there from the hospital they  stay there. This is what makes it fun to be a Bronson fan; so many  different movies and styles.",949622400,2,824,4.746478873239437

1213787,2,B00000FDXJ,"This is an odd story. Anthony Perkins is a neurosurgeon who doesn't have time to take care of his wife Jill Ireland. She gets herself a lover. Charles Bronson is a psychotic with amnesia who has escaped and is now under Perkin's care. The solution to everyone's problems is to convince Bronson that Jill is his own wife and she is cheating on him and let the psycho do what comes natural.

This film is practically a three man play. The thriller aspect of the film doesn't translate well into the 21st century. I was bored with the roles and performance of the leading stars. One worth missing.

1213791,5,B00000FDXJ,"A thriller that is a little different, also know as 2 Minds for a Murder, this is a different role for Mr. Bronson & he certainly shows his ability to show diversification.

The print is a nice wide screen copy, which does not show it's age or the fact that there are some pretty awful cheap versions of this movie out there.  Go with this 1 you won't be disappointed",1255651200,2,367,4.228571428571429

However, the actual dvd is presented in a letterboxed 1.85:1 format without anamorphic enhancement.

1213836,5,B00000FDXJ,"Wow!  What an unusual and oftentimes disturbing film this is with excellent performances all around from Perkins, Bronson, and Ireland in this tale about a twisted neurologist (Perkins)whose wife's infidelity prompts him to manipulate an amenesiac (Bronson), into killing his wife and her lover.

Perkins is well-cast in this role as the doctor who takes Bronson both into his care and confidence later managing to convince him that Ireland is his wife and is having an affair with a French journalist.  An unusual role for Bronson, typically regulated to B pictures and action roles, this film showcases his tremendous range where the director has successfully cast him against type. In this case, the victim.
Like ""Lola"" with Susan George filmed a year earlier and directed by Richard Donner, Bronson played a 38 year old author of ""adult literature"" who marries the 16 year old Susan George--a stretch for an actor of mostly B action pictures like ""Death Wish"" and ""The Evil That Men Do.""

This film shot on the southern coast of England, as did ""Lola,"" captures another facet of this actor's gifts.  This would be one of many pictures where he would collaborate with his wife, Jill Ireland.

Perkins is superb as the disturbed neurologist who finds solace in the opening bars of Dvorak's ""New World Symphony"" and toy puzzles.  Perkins always brings a neurotic intensity to any role, and this is no exception. The ending is one that is shocking as well as unexpected.

The quality of this DVD is excellent for a film over 30 years old. The transfers from the 16mm print are remarkably clean, and the audio is remastered to Dolby standards. Beware of cheaper versions of this DVD that look like they were taken from a VHS tape.",1152316800,10,1729,4.857142857142857
1213837,5,B00000FDXJ,"Just because Charles Bronson was known for action pack movies, he wasn't giving the opportunity, as many other actors, to play suspense roles with style. This movie, has a good Plot, with Actors that made the storyline pop...The movie industry,during that era, needed a change of pace on how Films were produced. Plus,this movie reminds me of another Action Star, Clint Eastwood, in the suspense thriller ""Play Misty For Me"", with the same effect, but different approach. I have always been very pleased to watch Mr. Bronson entertain me for several years, and will deeply missed him, but with a combination of new technology to re-master old films, and the open doorway to purchase these rare movies on [...], I can now watch the Past with the Stars again, again and again........",1127606400,2,781,4.924242424242424

UNLIKE MANY OTHER CHARLES BRONSON MOVIES, IT MAKES YOU WANNA THINK. THE ACTING IS GREAT AND THE STORY IS INTRIGUING.

1213839,4,B00000FDXJ,"I actually originally picked up Someone Behind The Door on VHS for 99 cents. I was a huge Bronson fan and said ""what the hell"" and got it. The title and cover did not make the film too appealing, but I was actually taken by total surprise by the film. Fans of Bronson's action films, don't expect the same here. This is more of a thought provoking thriller. What got me the most is the great performances by Bronson, Perkins, and Bronson's then wife . The story centers on brain sergon Anthony Perkins finding amnesia victim Bronson. Perkins takes him in for care and somehow convices him to murder his wife. The ending is spactacular. Smartly written and moves at a brisk pace. Though this is one of Bronson's more obsecure films, it well worth for fans to check out. This one his rarities that he made while in Italy. The DVD itself is also of very high quality, which is a surprise for such a rare movie.",1075248000,19,907,4.404761904761905
1213840,5,B00000FDXJ,"I am writing this review mainly for someone who might be wondering if the quality of this DVD is good or not. Evidently, the quality of two other older Bronson films,specifically Honor Among Thieves and Cold Sweat, is very poor on DVD. This is not the case with Someone Behind the Door. The DVD quality is excellent and the packaging is top of the line with photos from the film itself on front and back of the DVD case. Someone put alot of work into this DVD and it is well worth purchasing. After a dismal experience with another seller, I ordered my copy from Amazon.com and received it within three days and in perfect condition. I hope this review helps you.",1046217600,49,663,4.442622950819672
1213841,2,B00000FDXJ,"I just watched Somebody Behind the Door for the second time. The first time was about 12 years ago. This movie has a good story and is worth seeing. It is a bit dated now. You can tell it was shot on a low budget. But it is an interesting concept. Anthony Perkins is his usual creepy self with a twist as he manipulates a mental patient under his ""care"". Jill Ireland is beautiful and Bronson is... well Bronson (menacing). This is a stretch for Bronson from his usual macho revenge rolls but he holds up well. Its worth a look.",1023580800,,528,4.237623762376238
1213842,3,B00000FDXJ,"Someone Behind The Door is an excellent minimalist drama set on the English coast of Cornwall. A mysterious stranger, Charles Bronson, turns up on a foggy beach, unaware of his name or how he got there. He is brought to the local hospital where he is referred to doctor Anthony Perkins. The Doctor takes a shine to this amnesiac, even going as far as to let him stay in his house whilst he conducts further tests on the patient, in the hope that he may help him piece together his memory.  The film continues with Perkins creating possible explanations from the evidence available- a scratch on Bronson's face, a photograph, love letters. The Doctor slowly starts to convince the patient that he has been the victim of a Wife who has left him for a faraway lover, and that he must seek revenge as soon as possible.  Bronson and Perkins are excellent in this clearly theatrical film, holding there own in movie which stands or falls on the strength of it's performances. Bronson's then Wife, Jill Ireland, also provides solid support in the role of the Wife.  The film, although shot predominately in one internal location, manages to hold the viewers attention through intricate plotting and a weaving, red herring filled narrative, which has you guessing through to the end",991353600,2,1274,4.781818181818182

7908682,5,B00000FDXJ,Anthony Perkins gives a great performance in this movie. The movie takes place inside of one house. Only a few actors in the story. Charles Bronson also gives a good performance in this movie. A brain doctor (Anthony Perkins) with an unfaithful wife (Jill Ireland) brings home an amnesiac (Charles Bronson) and gets him to take action against his wife. The neurosurgeon convinces the amnesiac that his cheating wife is his own and to commit murder.

7908686,5,B00000FDXJ,"This is a solid psychological Italian thriller, at a time when very stylish movies were being made in Italy....  The late 1960s to the early 1970s witnessed the height of the production, and it was not merely the Westerns, but these type of films, too.  Bronson got involved in both, mostly the latter, and he worked well in them.  They are often quite violent and graphic, and certainly not for all tastes.  This particular film does involve some of the violence and sexual themes as many, but is actually more subdued than most.

  Very fine performances as usual from Perkins and Bronson himself, the latter doing his usual thing, playing 'The Man"".  This is a role typical of Italian films, being an ""anti-hero"", or a hero with serious problems and issues of his own.  This element was true and characteristic of the Westerns made in Italy at the time.  I therefore recommend this film... as an excellent starting point not only for Bronson's Italian films, but the whole genre of the Italian thriller.",1440028800,3,1006,4.763005780346821
7908687,3,B00000FDXJ,"A highly-regarded doctor in coastal England (Anthony Perkins) takes a great interest in an amnesiac man (Charles Bronson) who shows up at his hospital. He goes so far as to take the confused, possibly violent man home with him for ""treatment."" This is a set-up, of course--the surgeon has a complicated plan to avenge himself on his cheating wife (Jill Ireland) and her lover. And Bronson--who may or may not be a serial killer on the loose--is the key to Perkins' plan.

I love a good suspense thriller, but this odd film from 1971 (a British movie with American stars) looks and sounds like a filmed play. I'm willing to bet that this was an unproduced theatrical play someone handed to a film producer, and the producer saw a way to make a reasonably entertaining, inexpensive movie out of it with one set and four actors. 90% of the action takes place in one room! I think it would have made a better play than a film. But the cast is very good, and there's a neat, sardonic twist at the end. It's okay--and a must for Bronson fans. You've never seen him in a part like this before!",1433894400,2,1086,4.457286432160804
7908688,1,B00000FDXJ,I enjoy the actors in the film very much. I find that the pace of the film is too slow. The film seems to be experimental. With more movement of the dialog would have helped the movement of the actors.,1431043200,,201,4.05
