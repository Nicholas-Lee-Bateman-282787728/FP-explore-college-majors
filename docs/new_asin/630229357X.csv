My mom said I would go around singing the song, well, not the whole song, just a lot of ""Snoo-oo-oo-oo-py"" again and again. I bought the VHS, but lost it after a hurricane. I WILL be buying this DVD. This movies shows the love the whole Peanuts gang (and audience) feels for Snoopy. Even Lucy. While there is some cartoon violence, I think people's reviews overplay that way too much. This movie is a great addition to the Peanuts DVD collection.

This show has a lot of things in it. From the Beach to the Red Baron, there are just a lot of key Snoopy features. The voice acting is excellent. The music and songs are catchy and fun!

I will not go into details about the main story. Suffice to say that Snoopy gets a second home offer and has a chance to leave Charlie Brown and the Gang.

This story also stars Woodstock. I think this is Woodstock's first film. He is really cute!

The show can be emotional at times. Everything works out in the end. It also has a lot of funny scenes. I laughed a lot!

Overall, this is the best Snoopy Film. It is excellent in every way. Very good purchase. Very much recommended!",1339632000,,714,4.182481751824818
449257,5,630229357X,"As a child I grew up on the Peanuts characters. My parents used to let me read the comic strip, and every year we would all sit down together to watch the holiday specials that came on television. My father, who is an AVID peanuts fan, has random characters around his house which peaked my 3 year old's interest. She was fixated on snoopy! So when I saw 'Snoopy Come Home' on cable a few months ago I allowed her to watch it. Both her and her 2 year old little sister absolutely adored the movie. I had to purchase it because they were requesting to see it on a daily basis. It's truly amazing to me how the things I grew up on are so fascinating to my children as well. And I'm so thankful that Amazon.com makes them available to us!",1327449600,2,735,4.146853146853147
449258,3,630229357X,"Neither my 11-year old son nor I liked this cartoon very much.  After being really excited about watching a Charlie Brown movie together -- he had even taken the time to search it out and DVR it -- he asked if we could stop watching halfway through. It's a long film...or maybe it just seemed long...a seemingly endless parade of sadness, anger, fighting and mistreatment.  A few chuckles were interspersed here and there, but most of all it seemed really heavy.

I found myself wondering about Charles Schultz as I watched.  Could it be that he was really a mean & miserable man?  It sure looked like it.  This truly felt like a passive-aggressive revenge piece to me...revenge at some unknown person or circumstance.  Charlie Brown in this movie is an exaggerated case study of woe, unluckiness and helplesness.  He was not even endearingly unlucky as he is in other films.  Snoopy is mistreated and unappreciated, rather than celebrated.

Peppermint Patty is the bossy, self-absorbed, female archetype. Charlie Brown's attempts to get away from her are a bit too obvious.  It was clearly a swipe at women.

Snoopy falls in the hands of a temporary owner, again a bossy girl who mistreats him, tries to over-control him, and who Snoopy makes snide faces at and does nothing but run away from.  Some of the dialog sounds more like a marital spat than a doggie tale.

Lucy is unusually mean and haggard looking in this film, especially during their boxing scene.

Linus and Snoopy have a knock-down, drag-out fight over Linus' blanket.  I found myself thinking that Schultz was portraying himself in the characters of Snoopy and Charlie Brown, who were both antagonized and mistreated by everyone else.  Both of them display an unhealthy resignation and passive anger to the people around them.

Charlie Brown's speech to Snoopy that ""everything you are is because of me"" really jumped out like a red hot poker.  I had the same thought as another reviewer; that either Schultz's wife had nagged him with this line, or that he was revealing a core issue of his own marriage.  Sure enough, the other reviewier researched it and discovered that Schultz had divorced the year before this film came out.

To me, it was a study in depression, separation, helpessness and meanness -- really nothing redeeming at all.  Even the drawings seemed crude and hard compared to the more soft and pleasing art of later Charlie Brown movies.  Of course, it could be that they just hadn't found their artistic style yet.  But the drawings, music and tone of the movie were much harsher than the more popular Charlie Brown movies.

The fighting seemed way too intense and graphic for a children's film, IMO.  I kept wondering what the producers must have thought of it once they saw the finished product.  I guess that once the film was done they had invested so much that they felt there was nothing to do but go ahead and release the film, despite its mean tone and inappropriateness for children.

I would recommend that parents pre-view this cartoon to see if they feel it is appropriate and even desirable for their children before watching together.",1322265600,3,3136,4.811214953271028
449279,3,630229357X,"On the plus side it's the Peanuts gang with the voices we all know and love giving life to the characters. On the downside, the Vince Guaraldi piano music so associated with the Peanuts specials is missing in action. In its place we get a parade of songs, one after another after another as though this was a really bad musical.

Seriously, schlocky songs take over the whole special as though this was a showcase for the songwriters rather than for the Peanuts characters. Songwriters Richard and Robert Sherman are better known for some of their work with Disney but the choruses and arrangements that tend to these pieces are on the level of some of the DePatie-Freleng Dr. Seuss cartoons (e.g. Sneetches) or perhaps some TV commercials. You might recognize singer Shelby Flint, whose solo vocal is a respite from the group vocals that make up most of the soundtrack. She had some popularity in the sixties with ""Angel on My Shoulder"" and in Disney's ""The Rescuers"" with the Academy Award nominated song ""Someone's Waiting For You"".

One viewing of this 1972 feature and you get a strong impression that this was written in the aftermath of either a death or divorce in Charles Schulz's family. So I looked it up and sure enough, Schulz's first marriage ended in 1972, which helps one understand the deep undercurrent of sadness throughout ""Snoopy Come Home"". This might be therapeutic for children who are struggling with their parents' divorce, or it may rub salt in their wounds with lines like, ""I wish everybody I love could be in one place at the same time"". Even the humor echoes the sadness of divorce:

Lucy (playing Monopoly): BEEP. A beep on the nose is a sign of great affection.
Schroeder: I'd rather have the twelve hundred and seventy-five dollars, please. PAY UP!

*****

Charlie Brown (to Snoopy): Without me, you'd be nothing! Everything you have, you have because of me. Even that collar around your neck. Why, I remember the day I went out and bought that collar with money I have worked for and have saved and...",1322179200,,2036,4.740112994350283
449280,1,630229357X,"I showed this to my preschooler thinking it would be like the specials we've come to love, but I watched in shock as Snoopy has a knock-down drag-out fight with Linus over his blanket, kicking and hitting each other, then a boxing match between Lucy and Snoopy for no apparent reason whereby they knock each other into oblivion.  Then Snoopy is picked up as a stray by a girl who ties him to a rope and drags him around by the neck choking him.  On top of all that is a very weak story, lots of crying by the Peanuts gang, and just really - nothing good to come from watching this at all.

Brilliant, moving and funny sequel to the surprise hit ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"".

449310,5,630229357X,"This Peanuts special has always been way up there on my list of super-influential childhood experiences. Seen when I was around 5 or 6, I often wonder how strong an effect this movie had on my world-view.  A truly moving Peanuts special that to this day, is still my all time favorite.  Yes, it'll pull those heart-strings, and has its violent moments as well (hey, this was 1972 - there never WAS a more violent time in cinema!).  Snoopy beats the #$@! out of Lucy, who, many have thought, long had it coming.  In my book, this show is hands down THE most entertaining and funny Peanuts episode, with a depth of character and subject matter that had never been reached in a Charlie Brown special before.  Let's face it, the Charlie Brown specials have the kind of substance that has always been half for adults anyway, though not all will entertain adults.  This one works for older as well as younger people but is probably best not shown to kids of too tender an age, though I survived (with my grief).  Of course, I'd been through 'Pufnstuf, the Movie' several years before that, which provided memorable nightmares (out for a night of fun at the movies - how could my parents know watching Witchipoo roast Pufnstuf alive on that spit would later haunt me?).  Other influential TV shows would include The Bionic Man, Battlestar Galactica, and Land of the Lost.

""Snoopy Come Home"" is a bare-bones package without any subtitles or special features and was the second full length Charlie Brown movie (at 80 minutes).",1264118400,,1518,4.676691729323308
449311,1,630229357X,"Parents beware of this ultra-serious, somewhat dark Peanuts feature-length movie.  Unlike the first Peanuts movie which had many light moments augmented by the joyous and classic Vince Guaraldi jazz scores usually employed in Peanuts animation, this one is full of conflict and sadness, and uses an incredibly hokey score by the Sherman Brothers (who wrote pop hits back in the day).  My five year-old, who is pretty tough, broke down several times during this movie, worried about Snoopy getting KIDNAPPED at one point, and leaving Charlie Brown at another point (not to mention the brutality of Snoopy's lengthy boxing match with Lucy).  Schulz's Peanuts always had an adult tone to it, but the Peanuts specials managed to reach out to kids with many purely joyous moments.  Not so here.  The plot isn't even that well-executed and the resolution is not emotionally satisfying.  I don't recommend this to anyone.  The first Peanuts movie is great (A Boy Named Charlie Brown) by comparison.  No wonder this particular film was a big flop at the box office at the time.

The viewer will also get to experience Snoopy's relationship with the children that occupy his world and how he relates to them on his own terms.
This is a wonderful family film and a film that can introduce millions of new fans who have never heard of or paid much attention to the Peanuts comics. Although Snoopy doesn't do much pretending (Flying Ace, Joe Cool, etc.) he does show why he thinks he's human based on Schulz subplot of Snoopy's feelings about being discriminated against by the circumstances he faces when dealing with the children.",1245628800,2,872,4.596153846153846

Schulz, creator of the Peanuts strip went through a divorce around 1972 when this film was released and I wonder how much it colored Schulz while making this dark little film.  Snoopy searches for greener pastures and leaves poor Charlie Brown and his gang for a former owner, Lila.  I cried buckets when I saw it in theaters in 1972 and it's not much easier to take now.  Few laughs and constructed more like a mystery, it can be hard to take if you are old enough to understand what is going on.  Even the songs have lyrics like, ""Why must we pay for hellos that we say?""  If you are a child and just like to watch Snoopy and the gang, then it's fine but watching someone lose their pet is pretty rough and even the happy ending barely redeems what we went through in the first half.

Younger kids may be influenced by Snoopy's fights with Linus and Lucy, others will just find them funny (doesn't get better than Snoopy with a boxing glove on his nose).

449362,5,630229357X,"I don't even remember seeing this one when I was growing up, but I used to have it on videotape for my oldest daughter.  I recently got it on dvd and my youngest daughter was mesmerized (her first intro to Peanuts), my older daughter was thrilled to see it again, and even my husband stopped what he was doing and stood in the doorway for a bit before reluctantly sitting down to watch the rest.

It is done so well, and it's such a good movie!

It starts off with great scenes of Snoopy playing with the Peanuts gang (and Woodstock-- his first appearance anywhere).  Snoopy surfing, helping Peppermint Patty build a grand sand castle, just enjoying life as only Snoopy does!  But, then he finds himself excluded from the beach the next day as a ""No Dogs Allowed"" sign appears.  And then it seems there are ""No Dogs Allowed"" signs just about everywhere.  Charlie Brown gets angry at Snoopy and Snoopy is a bit unhappy.  Just about this time, we meet Lila-- a sweet lonely little girl in a far away hospital.  Remembering when Snoopy belonged to her, she writes Snoopy a letter.

When Snoopy receives the letter, he becomes all teary eyed and, with Woodstock, begins the journey to visit Lila.

Though Charlie Brown is sad to see Snoopy go, Snoopy must leave and he and Woodstock find the journey itself to be quite an adventure.  And, once he finds Lila, Snoopy has a difficult decision to make.  This one is a definite tear-jerker!

Vince Guaraldi's music is absent here-- all the songs are written by Richard Sherman and Robert Sherman.  As I remember finding fault in this while watching it on videotape years ago, I was completely happy with the music now.  Vince Guaraldi's jazzy piano might be more fun, but the Sherman tunes were truly delightful.

This isn't a lighthearted, fun romp with the gang. I picked this one up recently since I've begun collecting my beloved Peanuts holiday specials on DVD and thought this would be a nice addition. I recalled seeing it as a kid but very little about the actual story. I guess I was too young to really get anything out of it beyond the fun of my favorite cartoon characters come to life on my TV screen. Watching it as an adult, I was shocked at how utterly depressing most of it is. Everyone cries through about half the movie. Snoopy is torn between two people he loves and devastated at having to leave either of them. There's animosity between Snoopy and the kids, and two rather violent fights, between Snoopy and Linus and Snoopy and Lucy. The bit where Snoopy and Woodstock are trapped by that creepy little girl who wants them as pets is disturbing - I cringed watching Snoopy choke and gag as the kid tied a rope around his neck and dragged him along behind her. Hardly entertaining! Of course, it ends on an upbeat note with Snoopy coming home to Charlie Brown where he belongs, but by that time I was mostly just glad it was over. I'm going to have to watch ""A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving"" now to shake my downer!

Two stars because I can't give a Peanuts story one star! Oh, and the music is pretty good too. Especially the song that Snoopy and Woodstock whistle and dance to while camping.",1194739200,4,1604,4.382550335570469

Snoopy is the true lead of this movie, and he pulls it off nicely--from the long ""hiking"" footage, to the classic scene in the library with ""The Bunnies"". It gets me laughing every time.

But, viewer beware. This film just might be a bit too heavy for a little kid. They really went for the hanky-factor here, and you'd better have a box of them by your side.

While this movie does indeed have its downer moments, on the whole it is just a gem. The Sherman Brothers soundtrack has stuck with me all of these years since I was a wee little kid sitting on the floor in front of the TV with the VHS playing over and over. Hunt down the Soundtrack LP (Columbia Masterworks) to hear the music in beautiful W-I-D-E stereo.

Which brings us to some technical mumbo-jumbo. The DVD soundtrack leaves a little to be desired. OK....there really isn't that much that warrants a 5.0 mix, but they should have just given us the original mono track instead of the newly-yet-poorly-produced (IMHO) Stereo mix that we are presented with. The new stereo track is indeed stereo, but it consisted of a front-up-center voice/singing/dialog track with the music track ""chorused"" into a stereo effect. It's not bad and far from unlistenable, but when you actually get the chance to hear the original soundtrack LP, you only begin to wish that CBS/Paramount put a little more effort into this and hunted down some of the stereo music.

We don't even get a trailer! This is truly a bare bones disc.

The picture clarity is there, though. As far as colors go, this DVD looks SHARP. Some of the picture is so clear that at times you can actually see some shadowing of the actual animation cells against the background artwork. It looks vivid. They either used a beautiful condition print, or they did some GREAT restoration. Either way, it looks VERY good.

However, with the compliment comes the complaint. While I have not confirmed it yet as of this writing with my packed-away VHS dub, I seem to recall that the original VHS issue was Full Frame, and there are scenes on this DVD which I could swear are missing some picture at the top and bottom. The credit sequences are presented in side-masked Full-Frame, yet the film goes ""widescreen"" between the beginning and the end.

This movie would get an instant ""5"" rating, but the sound and the uncalled-for Letterboxing drop it down a notch.

Still.....this is probably all we're ever gonna get on DVD, so buy it anyway. The movie is a must-own....even with the technical blahs.",1150934400,8,2739,4.654244306418219
449393,4,630229357X,"The second ""Peanuts"" feature film carries a true emotional punch that the first (""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"") did not and benefits hugely from the musical stylings of the Sherman Bros. team.  This may not be saying much, but I rank it second amongst all theatrical feature films of the 1970s, behind only ""Watership Down"".  Unfortunately, you won't learn anything about the story behind the film, as there are ZERO extras -- this release is about as bare-bones as it can get.  There's really no excuse for such an oversight, as many of the principals (including the now-adult voice actors) are undoubtedly still alive.

But the latter aspect of this story hit home for me as a child being that I was adopted myself. Snoopy's violent enounter with Linus will upset the mamby-pamby Barney loving PC types (ooh, too bad! Let 'em watch New Zoo Revue). But my only complaint with this film is that the music is a bit on the sappy side, compared to Vince Guiraldi's usual peppy standard.

Not ony is there NO more picture on the sides, but the Full Frame Laserdisc actually has more picture on the right side than this Letterboxed DVD!

Enough complaining, there are positives about this DVD.  The picture quality is 100 times better than the old, yellowed & grainy Laserdisc.  The colors look true and the image is smooth & clean.  Even the soundtrack is punched up.

It may not have Vince Guaraldi's jazzy score but the songs by the Shermann Brothers (also known for the musical score for Mary Poppins and Charlotte's Web) are charming (""The Best of Buddies,"" ""Snoopy Come Home""), funny (""No Dogs Allowed"" sung by Thurl Ravenscroft) and even heartbreaking (""It Changes"").  The going away party theme sounds a little like something Guaraldi would have come up with.  Also, Woodstock makes his animation debut.

The movie starts out with Peppermint Patty promising a little beach picnic for Snoopy and the only thing standing in the way is a No Dogs Allowed sign which appears the next day (those construction workers worked a lot quicker back then than they do these days!).  Charlie Brown gets mad at his dog when he cuts his finger with the can opener (what a klutz!) and tries demanding a little appreciation (you can imagine how much he gets back from Snoopy, who just hands over the dog collar!).  Snoopy also gets in a boxing match with Lucy and a tug-of-war with Linus over his blanket.  Not long after those incidents, Snoopy gets a letter from a girl named Lila (who probably got his address from the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm) asking him to visit him while she's in the hospital.

449409,4,630229357X,"I don't know, I remember watching this Peanuts full-length feature when I was younger, but I was disappointed to find out it was nothing like I remembered it. Originally released in 1972, ""Snoopy Come Home"" is the second in a series of four full-length Peanuts features and although not the worst, it isn't the best either.  It is certainly an improvement over ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"" which I found to be rather disappointing, perhaps this is due to the inclusion of one of the greatest Peanuts characters, Peppermint Patty.

The story begins when Snoopy spends a day at the beach with Peppermint Patty and returns home hours later to find Charlie Brown upset over Snoopy's abuse of independence, Charlie tells Snoopy that he feels he deserves a little bit more of respect since it is because of him Snoopy is who he is, but the beagle refuses to listen.  Shortly afterwards, Snoopy receives a mysterious letter from an old friend in the hospital and quickly rushes to go see her taking Woodstock along.  Charlie Brown stays behind, wondering where Snoopy ran off to and feeling both depressed and confused.  Linus does some research and finds out that Charlie Brown is not Snoopy's original owner, that he had previously belonged to a little girl named Lila who is now undergoing special care at the city hospital.  Tough times follow for Snoopy as he must make the hard decission of who to stay with, his friend Charlie Brown or his previous owner, Lila.

Although the film features many crazy sequences that take away from flow of the film, I felt the flow of them go more evenly along that in the previous film.  These sequences are quite funny, such as when Snoopy is ""adopted"" by a crazy girl in his way to the hospital.  Songs include ""Snoopy Come Home"", ""No Dogs Allowed"", ""Do You Remember Me?"", ""You and Me"", ""Fundamental Friend Dependability"" and ""It Changes"", all of which are quite nice and memorable.  The biggest problem I had with this feature was that it wasn't as sad or heart-breaking as I remembered it, this time around, I found it a comedy film rather than a drama and I even remember one or two scenes that I didn't see this time around.  Still, like I said, this movie is definitely above ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"", but it isn't as fun or exciting as ""Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown!"" and ""Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and don't come back!).""",1140307200,,2372,4.664268585131895

But there is a few things that I don't like, one there are all these scenes of Snoopy/with or without Woodstock, getting throssed of of trains, bus, beach, hospital and the library, and then we hear ""no dogs allowed, and the only place that birds aren't allowed is in the hospital, but yet he is getting thrown off the same places that Snoopy goes in or on, expect for the beach and library. And there is another scene where a girl (Linda Ercoli) assumes that Snoopy and Woody are lost animals, and just adopts them, without checking any id, nor does she check on any lost posters, or even checks Snoopy's tag, and names him ""Rex"", and then all we pretty much hear is here Rex, here Rex, here Rex, and in which she goes in a song rotuine, which the only songs, that you see the character singing, and then the others were they are thinking, but you don't see there lips movie, and then tapes of other tunes, including when Snoppy and Woodstock are on the trip searching for the hospital. The movie opens, with some of the peanuts gang on the beach, we see Charlie Brown (Chad Webber), Linus Van Pelt (Stephen Shea), and Peppermint Patty (Chris De Faria), and Snoopy (Bill Melendez who also does the sounds of Woodstock) surfing on the beach, before he digs a tunnel around Patty's sandcastle, and haviong a great time with her, while Charlie Brown is at home, playing monopoly with the gang, along with Lucy Van Pelt (Robin Kohn) and Schroeder (David Carey), and Charlie Brown is wondering where is Snoopy, intil he comes hjome, and when he fixes Snoopy's supper, when he hurts his thumb while openning Snoopy's dog food. And then ww meet Lila, who we later learn that was Snoopy's orginal owner (Johanna Baer) who is sick in the hospital, writes to him, and then when he reads her letter, he packs his bag, and signals to Woodstock, and then they begin the journey, while leaving Charlie Brown confused of what is going on, and then keeps asking who is Lila, I bet he didn't even stop to think that she was Snoopy's orginal owner. There is another scene in which Charlie, Linus, Patty, and Lucy walking around in circles, while Snoopy Come Home plays, and each believes that they were the reason why Snoopy left.

My family sat down together today to watch with the anticipation of seeing the normal Peanuts humor and wit.  Their descriptions half-way through the movie were ""wierd"" and ""boring"".  The movie is incredibly long for a Peanuts film at about 90 minutes.  Much of this time is filled with unnecessary songs attempting to make this video some type of '70s musical.

Snoopy is rude, mean, and even ungrateful to Charlie Brown in the first part of the movie.  He spends days hanging out at the beach with Peppermint Patty for totally unexplained reasons.  It makes you wonder why everyone is so glad to see him when he comes back in the end (Oops! I gave away the ending!)  The ending is mercifully short, but predictable after being painfully dragged through the first 90% of the video.

This should have been a 30 minute video.  It seems that the creators tried to add to much ""filler"" to drag it out to a full-length film but they neglected to add anything meaningful to the story.

It deals with the fact that Snoopy has gotten a letter from his former owner, a little girl named Lila.  She is sick in the hospital and asks him to come see her (how did she get Charlie's addresss?  Maybe the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm kept the Brown's address, and she asked them for it).  He goes to see her, and then comes back.  He then tells the rest of the gang (by typing out that he is leaving some of his worldly possessions to them, since he can't speak) that he must return to her.  Here's where the sad part comes in--the going away party, and one of the saddest songs you'll ever hear in your whole life.  It really hit me hard because my best friend at the time had moved away, and it always makes me think of that.  This movie to me deals with losing a best friend, and then them coming back to you, which is what happened with me in real life.  Also, you get to learn the story of how Charlie Brown got Snoopy in the first place (an incident on a playground resulted in Charlie's parents going to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm and picking out Snoopy a their dog).

449458,5,630229357X,"What is it about this ""children's film"" that has repeatedly moved me so deeply over the years?  Is it the amusing sight gags embedded into a wonderful production?  Is it one of the finest musical score efforts by the Sherman brothers, with their masterpieces of clever lyrics and haunting harmonies?  Is it the perfect translation of the Peanuts characters from strip to screen (to video)?
I think the real treasure and power of ""Snoopy Come Home"" lies in the fact that it touches on a number of psychological issues that are relevant to children.  Charles Schulz's usual introspection (he's the writer here, thank God) plumbs the depths of some deep issues -- independence, separation from a familiar environment, loss of a close friend, uncertainty over the welfare of a loved one, encountering the ""threat"" of a stranger (the aggressively happy girl who captures Snoopy and Woodstock), the renewal of long-forgotten relationships, and loyal dedication to those we too often take for granted.
