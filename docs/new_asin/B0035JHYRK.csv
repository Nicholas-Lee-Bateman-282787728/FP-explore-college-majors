4071056,4,B0035JHYRK,Bought it as a family movie and it was a good movie. I passed it on to more family members.,1354320000,,91,3.6
4071057,5,B0035JHYRK,"What a wonderful movie.  You can never go wrong with movies made by Faith and Family Entertainment.  I truly believe in miracles and this movie shows that miracles do happen.  In this movie a man realizes he has a gift and helps others who are troubled and in pain. He wants to help everyone.  After a while he realizes that the ability of healing that he has, is taking him away from the people he loves the most.  This story shows how faith, family and love can bring miracles. If you like heartwarming movies, this is a must.",1338336000,13,528,4.346938775510204
4071058,5,B0035JHYRK,"This is a fantastic, inspiring movie, and it's a must see for everyone. The world needs more movies like this : )",1334361600,,113,4.181818181818182
4071059,5,B0035JHYRK,"This is a beautifully inspiring film about good simple people living ordinary lives and then something extraordinary happens. Eddie Cibrian is excellent in his portrayal of a regular guy who has been blessed with a miraculous gift and we follow him on his path as he tries to do good. He has the love of his life at his side and a loving family that tries to be supportive. This is a film with real feelings with a nice story, without all the ugly gore and violence you see in most films today.",1286496000,27,494,4.32258064516129

4071061,4,B0035JHYRK,Great story line and the acting was good.  It was so revealing when someone has a gift how others try to abuse or discredit someone.  It's a great movie.,1464825600,,153,4.241379310344827

4071064,5,B0035JHYRK,"A man finds he his the ability to heal, but it costs him his own health......but he wants to help others.  The character Leah is interesting and after I bought the DVD was surprised to find a little more about her. (but this was not shown when aired on Hallmark channel.)  Anyway I personally love this movie and have watched many times.  Now I find out the title is changed to Healing Hands, hmm wonder why?  Either way is still a good one!",1458000000,,441,4.27710843373494
4071065,2,B0035JHYRK,"I don't know what it was about this movie, but it just didn't click with me.  It was an interesting concept for a movie, the acting wasn't bad, and the chemistry between all the actors worked.  But for some reason I was left with a ""bland"" feeling after watching it.  It had nothing to do with the religious theme because I've seen other religious movies and enjoyed them.  All I can say is that this one left me feeling nothing.  For me, I usually either love a movie or I hate it.  This one I felt neither.  I think the reason is because it wasn't boring, but it was bland.  It wasn't a terrible movie, but there was nothing that made me want to watch it again.  A movie has to make me feel something, whether I smile, laugh, cry, or put me on the edge of my seat.  Like I said, this one made me feel nothing.",1455494400,,811,4.075949367088608

4071072,2,B0035JHYRK,"It was a nice story, but conflicted with my religious beliefs.  The story of the miracles focused on the man and not on God as the one causing them.",1447027200,,148,4.103448275862069
4071073,1,B0035JHYRK,"Not based in scripture, this movie comes close to inspiring on several occasions, but is a major disappointment in the end.",1447027200,,123,4.904761904761905

4071084,5,B0035JHYRK,"Viewed it on Hallmark and knew I had to have it. Was Healing Hands on Hallmark. Working Miracles is the real name of the movie. Good movie for those who are into fluffy movies. No huge violence, sex or nasty slang. You will enjoy it.",1432684800,,233,4.2

4071095,5,B0035JHYRK,This movie really spoke to me as I was healed of cancer and found it interesting to watch a person with the gift of healing give out to others. I'm still processing the part that healing others brought pearle to himself. But a great move that held my attention all the way through to the end.,1376092800,5,292,4.232142857142857

4071098,5,B0035JHYRK,I found this movie very honest & refreshing knowing that if in fact it were based on true facts it would be close to how some healers in fact do feel,1362873600,,149,3.838709677419355
4071099,5,B0035JHYRK,"I saw the movie before, when it was called Healing Hands. It shows how caring and helping others can lead to large problems. As Buddy tries to make a difference, he is caught up in the moment by all needing his gift. He himself becomes a victim and after he is cured, he has to lead a life of knowing he still has the gift, but keeping it on a non-existent level.",1357776000,9,363,4.055555555555555
