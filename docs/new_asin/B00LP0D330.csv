8667526,1,B00LP0D330,"There was once a play titled ""Six Characters in Search of An Author"". This movie could just as easily have been titled ""Eight People in Search of a Life"".  That title may even be too charitable for a film such as this. If you dared to plumb the depths of this hodgepodge of a movie, a more appropriate title might even have been: ""Eight People in Search of An Orgasm"". Just because this was a French film that supposedly hearkens back to the earlier work of Ozon, Argento, and Anger does not give it a pass when, after all is said and done, it is nothing more than a veritable melange of unfulfilled and empty lives whose stories and pace are about as exciting as watching grass grow. While the DVD was released in 2014, the film feels as though it dates from a decades earlier period. Indeed, the presence of a very youthful Alain Fabian Delon, the son of Alain Delon - one of France's most cinematic beauties - is probably the only redeeming feature. If it weren't for the fact that this was a French film, one might even think that the sudden and ambiguous ending
was going to lead to a sequel. Forget it!  The way the film opened should have been its ending. And please don't call it an ""Art Film"". That's a cop out title for something that nobody understands or cares to. ""You And The  Night"" (I don't even get the title) is probably one of the reasons why French films seem to be stuck in a time warp by remaining so confined (dare I say ""claustrophobic"") and focused on character development for better or worse more than anything else.",1463875200,2,1543,4.388111888111888

8667529,5,B00LP0D330,"Matthius and Ali are young lovers, together with their transvestite maid - Udo, they are planning an orgy after midnight - hence the original French title of `Les rencontres d'aprs minuit'. They have invited a cross section of society each with their single issue description. So we have the star, the stud, the teen and the slut (le chienne).

They all arrive and each appears to have their own peccadilloes and a story to tell. What starts as a tentative experiment in stranger sex soon becomes a compelling group `share and tell'. They all have their crosses to bear and in turn each reveals their past and their secrets and their passions.

This is a sublime piece of film making; it has a rolling poetry that can become almost hypnotic as the players lay their souls bare. It is a shared need for love, warmth, understanding and emotion that seems to act as the glue for all concerned - even though this was only meant to be a fleeting experience.

Everyone is superb in this and we have Eric Cantona being really good as the well endowed man of words. It is both stylish and stylised and whilst some shots seem overly contrived (and they are) it does not matter as this is a tightly woven tale that pulses beauty, warmth and love. I absolutely loved it - every second and can not recommend highly enough - this is unmissable.",1419033600,4,1331,4.5375
8667530,5,B00LP0D330,"I really loved this film. From the interesting references to the works of Kenneth Anger and Jean Cocteau, to the beautiful soundtrack by M83. I didn't have any expectations when viewing the film, and perhaps that is what made the cinematic experience stronger. Very emotional and fragile.",1416096000,5,288,5.148936170212766
