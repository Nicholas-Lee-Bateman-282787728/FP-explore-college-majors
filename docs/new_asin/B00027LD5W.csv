2065265,5,B00027LD5W,"This is an outstanding performance of a divine opera. The coloratur performance of Mariella Devia (Lucia) in the third act (mad scene) is standing out as subleme, at some stage actually echoing the instruments sound. Truely unbelievable. I can point out minor glitches but the essential point is that this is a 5 stars performance.",1188950400,8,331,5.036363636363636
2065266,3,B00027LD5W,".... but I've had it since it came out in 2004. I rather like Devia - I mean, she's so non-diva-ish. While her voice isn't what I'd call pretty, at least she gets the job done without giving me sweaty palms (sorry about the damned faint praise, to paraphrase).

What is most startling is that Bruson is off-pitch most of the time. This gives us a sextette which has to be the worst heard this side of a high school auditorium. Donizetti... well, who knows what Donizetti is doing these days?

I do have a Dame Joan/Kraus DVD which is fine, although it's never bowled me over. I'd rather the Riccarelli or the Moffo.",1169769600,9,615,4.385964912280702
2065267,5,B00027LD5W,"Excellently staged in an ""orthodox"" manner and superbly sung. This is one of the 10 operas in the ""La Scalla"" DVD collection -  each a bargain if bought individually but if bought as a collection they are a ""STEAL"". I have 5 and all are excellent. A great way to begin a DVD opera collection and a wonderful gift for a friend who doesn't have most of the operas included in the set.",1160870400,9,382,4.232876712328767
2065268,3,B00027LD5W,"This is an opera I know very well.  To be frank, I got 1/3 through this recording and it's been on the shelf ever since.  Not impressed by the singers.  Orchestra OK.

2065269,5,B00027LD5W,"This Lucia comes straight out of a dark 19th century oil-painting in a museum. Because of this, don't expect to find it lovely or romantic. Awe-inspiring is the word that comes to my mind and if you pay attention you can almost feel the chilly halls of Lammermoor Castle.

La Scola was a great surprise as Edgardo. A VERY fine Italian tenor with good squillo and well balanced acting. His top notes are particularly impressive. Bruson's lyric baritone has lost some of its opulence but it's still a great voice for this role. Colombara in one of his many Raimondos is noble but determined and his firm top notes come in handy.

Devia was in her 40s but she sounds as fresh as any soprano who had just made her debut. Her petite figure also ensures she looks the part. She was at the peak of her powers in 1992 and offers some of the finest singing on video of any vocal era. The mad scene, a scene I usually can't stand because of its lenght, is the highlight of the entire performance and both vocally and dramatically she took my breath away. Her perfect high notes and especially the staccati become expressive, natural sounds unlike any I've heard before and I'm aware of the stiff competition. All this spectacular singing is complimented with a balanced stage presence that is graceful overall and haunting in the mad scene.

Especially effective is the team work of the entire cast who bring the beauty of Donizetti's music forward. At any price, this is a performance that will honour your music library.",1140220800,29,1512,4.613382899628252
2065270,5,B00027LD5W,"I can only second earlier comments about this splendid 1992 La Scala production: traditional settings, glorious costumes and spectacular singing.  Devia is note-perfect throughout - a lovely instrument.  Tenor La Scola partners with her effortlessly, with a great italianate ""squilo"" sound. Conductor Ranzani leads the Scala forces in a competent, if not entirely thrilling reading of the score.",1115510400,20,395,5.793103448275862
2065271,5,B00027LD5W,"Donizetti and Bellini's, uncut, operas run about as long as Wagner's - and approximate the same heft.  If you love this opera, get this dvd; study it, live with it.  If you're into singers showing off, then get one of the others - you'll save a lot of time but of course you'll be missing the Donizetti boat.

I already revered La Scala but this production really blew me away - and I could compare the feeling of being in the tradition only by remembering performances of Swan Lake at the Maryinski.  Even the productions featuring Mme (...)(at whose shrine I daily bow) seem a bit silly in relation to this one, full blooded and complete.",1114214400,15,640,4.491379310344827
2065272,5,B00027LD5W,"Lucia di Lammermoor is the most popular opera by Gaetano Donizetti. The prolific composer of the nineteenth century is spot on in this drama. Beautiful melodies supported a libretto homogeneous lead to arias for soprano, tenor and baritone showcase their vocal talents. It is no coincidence that the opera is one of the most represented since its debut. Lucia is challenging and attractive role desired by many sopranos and immortalized in the voice of Callas, Sutherland, Caballe, Sills and Gruberova among others.
The version re-released on DVD back clear images and good sound quality. The Scala is well known for conservatism in relation to modern versions of opera. In Lucia have a classic reading, while being modern. Scenarios clean, clear and without exaggeration. Lighting correct, though the dark times, satisfactory direction and costumes are impeccable some of the features of the Scala standard of quality. If you like modern reading, where directors of ""cutting edge"" borders, cut and reshape, do not buy that version. In fact we do not recommend anything that theater for those who enjoy modern conveniences.
Can not praise the orchestra, with a baggage of hundreds of operas to his credit, the musicians and conductor Stefano Ranzani take the letter. Featured in all suits, smooth and vibrant sound are some of the qualities that we can cite. The chorus follows the same line, always in tune, surely one of the best in the world.
The soloists are old acquaintances of opera lovers. Renato Bruson who has sung several times in Sao Paulo is one Lord Enrico dour, static and interpenetrated. His voice stands out for power and brightness, one of the best baritones of his generation. Mariela Devia soprano is a right, following the score almost perfectly. But does not impress, nothing ventured, nothing. Bureaucracy, especially in the mad scene. In his main aria could take some risks, more excited, playing a crazy, her voice was as Callas, Sutherland. Okay! It would be too much to ask her voice as did the great divas of the past century. Vincenzo La Scola possess beautiful tenor tone, design, clear highs, effective for the role of Edgardo. It makes a presentation memorable. As your colleague is on the basics, got the job done.
Some details are a little lacking in production, but nothing to discredit this dvd. When Lucia comes out of the marriage bed in the third act, just killed her husband and is possessed by madness. The costumes and the representation should show this tragic moment and crucial. In the assembly presented the character seems to have come from a dance, all dressed, well combed hair that does not remember killing a girl and crazy. The chaplain Raimondo is someone belonging to the cleric, it seems obvious to say, but his costume is incorrect. It takes little imagination to see a cleric in character.
Lucia di Lammermoor is an opera that summarizes the entire first phase the Romantic period. All the cliches of the period are represented. Mad scene, exotic and distant, death of the protagonists are some of them. For excellence in the orchestration and production, good soloists and reasonable price for a DVD imported, it is worth having this opera on your bookshelf. Among those available in the market we think is the most cost-effective there

Lucia di Lammermoor  a pera mais popular de Gaetano Donizetti. O prolfico compositor do sculo XIX acertou em cheio nesse drama. Belas melodias apoiadas a um libreto homogneo levam a rias para soprano , tenor e bartono exibirem seus dotes vocais. No  por acaso que a pera  uma das mais representadas desde sua estria. Lucia  desafiadora e atraente, papel desejado por muitos sopranos e imortalizado na voz de Callas, Sutherland, Caball, Gruberova e Sills entre outras.
A verso re-lanada em dvd trs imagens ntidas e som de boa qualidade. O Scala se destaca pelo conservadorismo em relao a verses modernas de pera. Nessa Lucia temos uma leitura clssica, sem deixar de ser moderna. Cenrios limpos , claros e sem exageros. Iluminao correta,embora escura as vezes , direo satisfatria e figurinos impecveis so algumas das caractersticas do padro Scala de qualidade. Se voc gosta de leituras modernas, onde diretores de ""vanguarda"" transpe, cortam e remodelam, no compre essa verso. Alis no recomendamos nada desse teatro para quem gosta de modernidades.
Impossvel no elogiar a orquestra, com uma bagagem de centenas de peras em seu currculo, os msicos e o regente Stefano Ranzani tiram de letra. Destaque em todos os naipes, som harmonioso e vibrante so algumas das qualidades que podemos citar. O coro segue a mesma linha, sempre afinado, com certeza um dos melhores do mundo.
Os solistas so velhos conhecidos dos amantes da pera. Renato Bruson que j cantou vrias vezes em So Paulo faz um lorde Enrico sisudo, esttico e compenetrado. Sua voz se destaca pela potencia e brilho, um dos melhores bartonos de sua gerao. Mariela Devia  uma soprano correta, segue a partitura quase com perfeio. Mas no empolga, no arrisca nada. Burocrtica ,principalmente na cena da loucura. Na sua principal ria poderia assumir alguns riscos, empolgar mais, interpretar uma louca, soltar a voz como fazia Callas, Sutherland. Tudo bem ! Seria pedir muito soltar a voz como faziam as grandes divas do sculo passado. Vincenzo La Scola possu belo timbre de tenor, projeta agudos claros , eficientes para o papel de Edgardo. No faz uma apresentao inesquecvel. Como sua colega fica no bsico, dando conta do recado.
Alguns detalhes deixam a desejar na produo, mas nada que desabone esse dvd. Quando Lucia sai do leito nupcial no terceiro ato , acaba de matar o marido e esta possuda pela loucura. O figurino e a representao devem mostrar esse momento trgico e crucial. Na montagem apresentada a personagem parece ter sado de um baile, toda arrumada, cabelo muito bem penteado que em nada lembra uma moa assassina e louca. O capelo Raimondo  algum pertencente ao clrigo, parece bvio falar isso , mas seu figurino est incorreto.  preciso muita imaginao para ver um clrigo nesse personagem.
Lucia di Lammermoor  uma pera que sintetiza toda a primeira fase perodo romntico. Todos os clichs do perodo esto representados. Cena de loucura, lugares exticos e distantes, morte dos protagonistas so alguns deles. Pela excelncia na orquestrao e produo, bons solistas e preo razovel para um dvd importado , vale a pena ter essa pera em sua estante. Entre as disponveis no mercado pensamos ser a melhor custo-benefcio que existe atualmente.

The characters don't move much, and they don't seem to relate to each other, so that no matter how well they sing -- and Devia and Bruson sing very well and Vincenzo La Scola sings agreeably -- they are hamstrung by the production.  In the mad scene, Devia is marvelous vocally, but she looks choreographed, and the impression of craziness doesn't come across.  In the Sutherland/Kraus Met performance, these veteran singers communicate a sense that Lucia and Edgardo are crazy from the get-go, and that homicide and suicide are credibly in their futures.  La Scola and Devia look mildly annoyed, even when singing well.  I think that the director has made serious misjudgments here -- after all this is an opera about crazy people.  ALL the three leading roles are crazy, and here it's just too low-key.  The conductor, Stefano Ranzani,  is also at fault.  The musical performance is tidy, and tidy isn't enough.  When Bonynge by contrast sounds like Toscanini, you know there's a problem.  The camerawork is also a problem -- there are too many distant shots, and that contributes to the sense of the whole thing being choreographed rather than lived that is one of my main objections to this production.  In ""Lucia"" one can't whip up the music to a verismo-style frenzy, but bel canto and energy aren't incompatible.  Bonynge knows that, and Ranzani doesn't.  So . . . some good singing wasted here.",1356739200,2,1486,4.772549019607843
8023249,5,B00027LD5W,"I've owned this performance now for several years and am only now writing my review.

I first discovered Lucia as a music student in college and found the music of the love duet at the end of the first act to be so hauntingly beautiful that I never forgot it. Years went by without hearing this music again but it was never far from my mind.

I found this recording on Amazon and decided to buy it and hope for the best. I must confess that I do not watch the entire opera all that often, but generally skip to the love duet at the close of Act 1 and enjoy that beautiful music all over again. I may have watched the entire opera two or three times but have watched the love duet more times than I can remember; and I'm happy to report that I'm still charmed by this beautiful music.

In operatic literature I am particularly fond of three love duets, this one at the end of Act 1, the love duet from the first act of La Boheme, and the love duet from Il Pagliacci. I admit I have not heard all of the other recordings of Lucia and cannot compare them to this one; but even without that advantage I have found this recording to be a joy. I have found the performances by Mariella Devia and Vincenzo La Scola to be delightful and have enjoyed this scene many times.

I would have paid the price of the DVD for this scene alone but have also fully enjoyed Davia's impressive performance of the mad scene. Her performance leaves me feeling rewarded with artistry that fully satisfies all my expectations.

I have found this recording to be a welcome adddition to my collection.",1264809600,2,1574,4.286195286195286
8023250,3,B00027LD5W,"The lighting ruined this beautiful opera!  Throughout the whole performance, the scenes were immersed in hellish darkness.  The net results are disgustingly unfair to the singers and choreographers.  How can La Scala permit this unprofessional shortcoming to happen?

I love Devia's performance, as well as her earlier dvd.  La Scola was in too much of a hurry to finish the final scene, losing critical impact provided by Donizetti.  He could learn from Carreras.",1261872000,7,464,5.287671232876712
8023251,5,B00027LD5W,"On a light note, the list price for this disc, probably, makes it the best Lucia per dollar of any commercial DVD on the market right now. More seriously, anyone seeking a traditional performance of Lucia with wonderfully supportive scenic design and voices suitable for the parts played, will find this disc suitable for his or her needs. That doesn't mean that other versions will not exceed it in interpretive power of star singers, directors or conductors. It does mean that you will always be able to approach these with the background of one who has heard it in what might be called the standard way and with over-all quality that only the best will exceed. It is difficult to judge to what extent something not quite as one would like is due to the composer or to those putting on a particular production. For example, would that the tenor singing Edgar's role have sounded as well earlier as he does in his final scene; yet, clearly that final scene was intended by Donizetti to be the tenors great moment, something he would be remembered for, and it is. I suppose each singer must learn to pace himself or herself to be ready to command that given moment, certainly Lucia's and Edgar's high spots are here given the elan called for while some other arias by the same singers might have benefited from somewhat greater ""presence"".
These are quibbles, this is a fine Lucia.",1254009600,,1381,4.663934426229508
8023252,5,B00027LD5W,"Searching for any opera with La Scola I found this gem. This is an early La Scala production and the ""mad"" scene"" is somewhat restrained but the cast is superb - I am pleased to own this DVD - go on buy it whilst you can!",1232150400,,221,3.8260869565217392
8023253,3,B00027LD5W,"Mariella Devia's acting is thoroughly stilted until the Act 3 ""Mad Scene.""  In Acts 1 and 2, she seems almost bored. For example, when Lucia's horrible brother demands that she marries someone other than the man she loves, Devia looks completely nonchalant.  However, she's brilliant musically and very convincing dramatically when it comes to her final scene.  The DVD is worth buying for the mad scene alone.

On the whole, it's hard to say who is the worst actress, Mariella Devia or Joan Sutherland?  Anna Moffo captures the tragedy of the fragile, mentally-unstable Lucia beautifully. So, if you demand drama with your bel canto, I suggest you turn to Moffo for the most complete interpretation currently available on dvd.  It's a pity that we have no video recording of either Sills or Callas.  Those two divas both combined fantastic acting with brilliant singing!

This particular production is fine.  The conductor is competent.  Musically, this performance is first rate.  It's disappointment, though, in terms of the overall dramatic portrayal of the main character.",1216166400,9,1077,5.203488372093023
8023254,5,B00027LD5W,"This is a really great traditional production of Lucia di Lammermoor, with beautiful sets and lavish costumes and the music and singing is superb!  I've seen this opera before, but this production of it made the deepest impression on me.

The entire cast is good but Mariella Devia as Lucia and Vincenzo La Scola as Edgardo were simply outstanding!  Why both of them are not better known or more often seen and heard is beyond me.  Mariella Devia's voice is perfection.  She sang the mad scene without blood or histrionics, just simple, straight from the heart-wrenching beauty.  La Scola's condemnation of Lucia sent a chill up my spine and his Act III arias brought tears.

This is definitely worth seeing and I recommend it highly!",1205884800,4,734,4.824
8023255,5,B00027LD5W,"This is a visually beautiful production with a classic Lucia from Devia, and a very good supporting cast, including Vincenzo La Scola, a tenor who should be better known.  The only flaw is some serious distortion on high notes.  Engineers never did learn to record Devia's voice very well.",1199232000,5,289,4.877551020408164
