3495328,4,B001BN25YO,"After about half an hour, the viewer can predict the outcome. What is not so transparent is the development of the two central, and one or two peripheral, characters.

Note of a moral nature: this movie (like numerous others that primarily aim to shock in order to motivate a kind of moral reflection that is valuable in itself, films such as 'American Beauty', 'Magnolia', 'Bad Education', '13 Tzametti', 'Perdita Durango' and 'Natural Born Killers') raises the question: ""Will its release encourage morally reprehensible behavior?"" My answer would be ""Maybe."" Not much of an answer, but perhaps this is something troubling, and perhaps public debates on such subject matter as one encounters in this film wouldn't be a bad idea. I can understand some peoples' less-than-favourable response to this film. After all, teen prostitution isn't the world's healthiest practice, both physically AND psychologically. Anyway. What about the non-normative aspects of the film (which warrant discussion in themselves)?

Leguizamo is versatile, and this movie provides further evidence of said trait. Nixon fans might be disappointed insofar as her role is a minor one, with little investigation of the character she plays. But Leguizamo, his love interest (Waterston), and the other 'babysitters' (esp. 'Brenda') are given some serious attention. Of special mention are a few aspects of Waterston's character that make for a more interesting story than would otherwise have been the case.

Not an easy film to watch. Makes one wonder how exaggerated the story actually is. Overall, entertaining, superior acting, interesting plot. But note moral caveat above.",1230854400,4,1650,5.4375
3495329,4,B001BN25YO,"It could be said that this movie is a lesson on considering every angle before embarking on a new endeavor.  In this case, the girls realized they could make money by having sex under the guise of baby-sitting, but eventually things get out of control in ways that make it not worth even the good money.  What seems like it is going to be easy money turns difficult and dangerous.  Avarice and typical teen girl rivalry among the group turns life into a treacherous nightmare for Shirley.  The movie gets four stars instead of five because I am not sure a girl as 'innocent' as Shirley could turn into such a ruthless Madame in such a short time.  There is nudity (teen breasts) and some bad language and drugs, but less than one would expect in such a movie.",1229817600,3,759,4.431654676258993
3495330,3,B001BN25YO,"Initially when I heard about The Babysitters, I thought of Risky Business with Tom Cruise in it, but upon watching it, I realised the two movies are very different. Risky Business was tinged with humor throughout but The Babysitters takes a very dark look at teens, sex, drugs and middle-aged men, a combustible combination indeed.

The movie begins with a bunch of nubile teen girls in compromising positions with middle-aged men, and a commentary by the lead actress [Katherine Waterston] who plays Shirley. We know the movie is going to be rather dark when Shirley casually makes the observance that ""paid fellatio"" is not much different than flipping burgers.

Turns out Shirley is a financially-challenged honors student who babysits to earn extra money and meets a couple Gail [ Cynthia Nixon] and Mike [John Leguizamo] who have two children. Mike is a middle-aged executive who finds his wife rather boring and unadventurous, and whilst driving Shirley home one night, they 'bond'. A kiss results in a heavy tip for Shirley, and soon the pair are engaged in a hot affair, the first encounter netting Shirley $200. The bright young woman decides this is the path to financial freedom, and is soon not only making money hooking on the side with Mike and other like-minded guys but also pimping out her similar-minded classmates, charging a 20%  levy on each of her 'girls' transaction.

What appears to be an easy ride turns difficult and dangerous when greed and rivalry amongst the girls turns life into a spiralling nightmare for Shirley.

Katherine Waterston [daughter of Sam Waterston of Law & Order] does an amazing job in her role as the enterprising teen Shirley, though I did find her sudden chameleon-like change from virginal teen to teen nymphet and madam hard to swallow [pun intended]. John Leguizamo's performance as Mike was well-done, though his sex scenes with Waterston were unconvincing. Cynthia Nixon's dumpy wife role truly wasted her talents and didn't elicit much sympathy for her character. Another stand-out performance was by Halley Wegryn Gross who plays Nadine, another of Shriley's girls.

Overall, I found the movie an above-average attempt at addressing the darker side of high school students' lives, the pressures they face etc, but I felt the movie did not truly spend time on character development and plot cohesion. Final verdict: a dark drama dealing with teen vice and angst.",1217462400,87,2419,5.065326633165829

3495345,3,B001BN25YO,"To those who find the ""sexualization of teenage girls"" distasteful, I agree, but do you know how many girls between the ages of 13 and 17 are runaways, living on the streets and earning a living by selling sexual favors to complete strangers? That doesn't make what these girls did right or moral by any means, but at least they were relatively safe in suburbia and they had a very limited list of ""clients."" I liked the moral at the end. There comes a time when we find out that everyone is flawed, even those we hold in the highest esteem. At least this movie ends as a cautionary tale rather than glorifying what these girls were doing. *********WARNING: SPOILERS******** The fact that they ended up almost killing one of the girls and then Shirley, the ringleader, found out that her father was a client - talk about a wakeup call!

The plot takes you into the world of a high school girl but also into the world of the married family man and the interactions between these two as they quickly escalate.  But then as the business starts to grow, things grow more and more intense.  There were a few moments where I was wondering why I was watching this movie, especially when they were trashing the school.

After they have sex while he's supposed to be taking her home, he awkwardly pays her, and they say their goodbyes. She's heartbroken, and becomes numb to the whole ordeal. Soon, she is essentially pimping a small group of friends as ""babysitters."" The situation goes from bad to worse, and she learns a sort of lesson. She can't change what she did, no matter how hard she wishes she could. An interesting concept, and in my opinion well executed.",1476835200,,652,4.629310344827586
3495462,4,B001BN25YO,Katherine Waterston is a star!,1473638400,,30,5.2
3495463,5,B001BN25YO,"Shirley (Katherine Waterston) is a 17 year old high school student who wants to make a little extra $$ to save up for college.  She stumbles upon a rather unconventional idea:  combine being a legitimate babysitter with being an escort girl for when the father gives her a ride home afterward.  This ends up being lucrative, but the entrepreneur in her takes it one step further:  she gets her girlfriends involved in the scheme and becomes a sort of ""madam"" for the most unconventional babysitting company ever!!

Of course, teenage girls being teenage girls, eventually some of ""her"" girls want to do business just for themselves & cut Shirley out of the loop.  Adam Smith economics meets up with naughty babysitters.  Uh oh!  Therein lies the plot outline of the story.  Oh, and it is supposed to take place in my home state of Michigan so that's a big + too (not sure where they actually filmed it, though).

For those who are curious, most of the movie is a teaser flick.  However, there is one scene that is an exception to this rule in which the viewer gets to see Katherine Waterston topless in jeans.  Boy oh BOY do I ever like the topless-in-jeans look and Katherine has an impeccable body;  that 1 scene alone is worth the price of admission.  She is built like a college dance team girl ~ tall,  slender, amazingly beautiful.  She actually reminds me of Juliette Lewis when she was Katherine's age.  OK, I guess I'm starting to ramble here....but watch this movie & you might be obliged to do the same if you're a straight male!

All in all, this is much like many French films where teenage girls have a sexual awakening that intersects with the world of prostitution.  There are times in life where it's just not worth it to sacrifice your self respect ~ no matter how good the $$ is.  But, of course, we all have to make our own decisions in these matters.",1471305600,17,1871,4.528358208955224

3495467,5,B001BN25YO,"Well, first, the storyline doesn't tells you everything.
Second, it is the charactors and how the story flows that are really make this movie something not the main idea or tagline.
When I saw Katherine Waterston's face, my initial thought about this film was all changed.
I thought this will be another stupid sex comedy but when I saw her face, everyting changed.
Her face was pure, well educated, pretty girl who will never do anything wrong who will stay in school type.

Well that made this movie really interesting.
Then there was John Leguizamo.
I saw him from movies like <Romeo + Juliet><Carlito's Way>.
He usually acted  bad guys but in a very charming way. He got all the charisma and in this movie, he is very lovable who happens to fall in love with a teenager Katherine Waterston.
After a few times of hesitation, he finally had a sexual relationship with her.
The thing is because he felt gulity that he has a family and all, because she is babysitting his son, whenever he has sex with her, he pays the girl just like a hooker.
After her first experience with a man officially and beeing paid, Katherine decides to expand the experience to other men to earn money.

But since, as I told you, she is totally innocent looking, we cannot hate her at all. She still is an innocent girl.
She gathers some of her friends from school to join the force and name them babysitters. They even make businesscards.
The business goes well till one by one becomes torned apart thinking they cannot do this anymore. They are school girls after all. They ain't hookers.
The thing is Katherine's friends are more look like half baked wicked I hate to say this but ugly girls and the audience will probably won't pitty on them. They will probably will feel protective for Katherine only.

When all this thing went bad and Katherine goes back to her early times and becomes a good good student again,  we all feel relieved.

This movie is a coming of age film after all although it is a little bit extreme.

I saw some girls  who graduated from the University and happen to sell their own body to earn easy money. Most of them because of lack of family education. When I saw the mother, I can see why the daughter acted that way.

But the girl Katherine was an exception. Her parents seemed normal and it was John Leguizamo who was responsible for her behavior.
He loved her but then again he corrupeted her by paying her money for continue the relationship and getting rid of her guiltiness.
Man are man. They are stupid. What can I say.

Anyway, if you see this movie, you will feel how indie movie can be great without a huge budget.
Finding good actors, making good story flew well. That's the secret.

3495501,2,B001BN25YO,"The Babysitters movie is a below average film that really does not accomplish very much of anything.  The film tries to be dark and act like an R rated movie without any real skin scenes.  If your looking for any T&A you won't find it here.  The surprise shocker near the ending you could see coming from a mile away.  I felt the film really under delivered what it was trying to aim for.

Doubtless many of the girls in the school would have noticed their classmates' sudden splurge in luxury items.  In reality it probably would have extended to cars, concert tickets, and tattoo's things that most normal teenagers cannot afford on their own without working.  It seemed to me that even these actresses seemed older than normal high school age girls.

The husbands wives could not be that dumb, one of them would have suspected something fairly soon, especially if the wives were the ones handling the finances from the cheating spouses.  A missing $200 to $400 here or there would certainly draw some red flags.  All 4 of the main girls hooking seem shallow and are hard to root for in any capacity.  They hardly seem to be desperate or down on their luck with no way to get into a decent college.

I am sure one of the weak willed spouses would have broke down and confessed to their wife about what was going on and the whole business would blow up.  If not that a jealous classmate that was snubbed trying to ask one of the girls out would have blown the whistle.  I was surprised it was not the long haired boy who had a crush on the lead actress.  I bet the Leguizamo character would have come to his senses and mend his relationship with his wife and realize the relationship would never work.

It seemed like the film had a lot of loose ends that were not tied up.  Leguizamo's boss could have easily blackmailed his employee to do a better job or break the news to his wife about his affairs.  Did the Katherine girls parents stay together?  The film is no way near as good as Risky Business with Tom Cruise.  That film was smart and had a lot more humor and substance, where this film feels like a Debbie downer.  The film does not even mention if the money she made even helped her get into college so what was the point.  I would rate this movie 2 stars and I feel like that is being kind.

This story of 16-year old Shirley starting a high school prostitution ring may not be as salacious as it sounds, but it still does the trick.

Enjoying both, she soon recruits her friends into the business, taking her cut for the action.  Along the way, she has to deal with scheduling, rivals and keeping her girls in line, tasks that she performs with ruthless efficiency.

3495545,4,B001BN25YO,"This movie is rather average, characters forgettable, director's work - let's call it unobtrusive, so at best it should be given 3 stars, so why did I give it four?

Precisely because it's so average and normal.

In this movie Shirley, a student in a nice clean high school in a nice clean American suburb organizes her classmates into a prostitution ring, well functioning, smooth and efficient American business.

The movie starts with Shirley, actually a honors student, babysitting for a neighboring family. When the husband, Mike [John Leguizamo], gives her a ride back home, they kiss, and he gives her a rather heavy tip.

Soon we find him giving her tips for very different services, which she offers without much ado. Money is very prominent in the film from the very beginning to the very end, because Shirley, while her family is far from poor, doesn't have much money herself, and needs some income of her own - that's why she is babysitting in the first place.

But for her sexual services she, apparently, gets paid much better than for babysitting, and, as she says herself in the movie, ""paid fellatio is not much more humiliating than flipping burgers"". Amazingly, this is talking a nice clean girl from nice, clean American suburbia, not an underclass, deprived girl from some inner city slums.

But the film gives us much more than this. Once Shirley is established in her new role, one day she tells her friend, her classmate, about this small business she has on a side, and her classmate becomes interested, she needs extra money too. Shirley asks her ""customer"" Mike if any of his friends might be interested in similar kind of service. Or maybe it's Mike who asks her if she has any classmates who could ""babysit"" for his buddies.

Soon Shirley's business is growing, she adds new customers, and her classmates willingly provide them with quality service. There're some conflicts, but those are of purely business nature: Shirley charges classmates a fee for providing them with clients, and some girls don't want to pay, or they don't want to pay enough - this kind of conflict, nothing personal. No moral torments.

Girls counting money are shown in this film more than once, and it is pretty much as sexually explicit as this film goes.

Lord Of the Flies, where a group of boys is left without adults on an island, shows how easy human morals are going away when children are left unsupervised.

No remote uninhabited islands in Babysitters.",1359158400,12,2469,4.815602836879433

3495565,3,B001BN25YO,"The movie is about a shy girl with OCD who almost literally overnight turns into a whore, and a pimpette for her entire circle of friends. Her cover is an after-school babysitting business, and her clients are all middle-aged men.

It has potential on a lot of different levels but doesn't realize a drop of it. As a psychological drama, with the exception of the rather stunning climax (really the only thing that this movie has going for it), it misses the mark. Lead character Shirley's turnaround is so decisive and so swift that we never have time to relate to her, much less feel sorry for her. In fact all of the girls go from being fairly typical American teens to raging, spunk-soaked dregs in an instant, without looking back, without so much as a minute of moral dilemma.

So, this could be sexy, right? Except that it isn't. The girls aren't particularly attractive and certainly are not sexy (Shirley is somewhat reminiscent of a taller Daria, except that she doesn't even wear skirts). There is just one nude scene--a good one, but it is just the one. The sex scenes drive the story along and are not gratuitous enough to elevate (or lower) this to the level of erotica.

It's not a thriller either. I kept waiting on the hints of death or permanent destruction to become reality, but no...nothing. Basically a handful of teenaged girls screw around with a handful of older family men and nobody ends up the worse off for it, at least as far as we know.

Which brings me to the biggest hangup that I have with the movie, and that's the completely unsatisfying conclusion. Lots of plot lines left unresolved, lots of dangling ends, no real conclusion in the classic sense. We don't find out what happens with ANY of these people, for good or ill. I found myself wondering why I just wasted the time.

Three stars really is a bit generous for this production, but since there is no option for two and a half, that's what it gets from me.",1336262400,23,1949,4.5413105413105415

I love fact that main fear of the lead actress is that of people finding out about her prostitution ring rather than the fact that the clients are fully grown men. The director's blueprint for this film is definitely modeled around personal perspective and personal agreements we have made with ourselves of what is moral vs. unmoral. The ending was a unexpected and unpredictable for I thought everyone was going to go to jail, not the case. This movie is due for a sequel. That is the only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5.

3495570,4,B001BN25YO,"The well-acted indie drama ""The Babysitters"" takes what appears on the surface to be fairly salacious and distasteful material and turns into a scathing attack on contemporary mores and values.

Shirley (Katherine Waterston) is an attractive suburban high school student who decides to make a little extra money babysitting for the young son of a local couple.  When the husband, Michael (John Leguizamo), who is clearly unhappy in his marriage, pays to have sex with her at the end of the night, Shirley comes up with a scheme to parlay that into a full-fledged teen-prostitution ring, with Michael lining up other clients among his married buddies and Shirley setting herself up as a sort of ""madam,"" ""hiring"" her friends from school to serve as under-aged ""call girls.""  But the folks involved soon discover that, when it comes to affairs of the heart and of the loins, one can't always dictate how things will turn out.

Writer/director David Ross aims at a wide range of targets, from the sterility of suburbia and middle class marriage to middle-aged men who refuse to grow up - and who, instead of serving as moral guides for the girls, are willing to exploit them for their own perverted needs - to the capitalist system itself, at least as embodied by the ""enterprising"" young entrepreneur, Shirley, who often has to stoop to ruthless and dictatorial tactics to ensure the viability and survival of her business.

But always, beneath it all, there is the intense sadness and emotional emptiness of the situation, as these attractive young ladies - who are really just confused and insecure kids under all the makeup, sexy clothing and alluring bravado - find themselves getting into something they can neither fully understand nor fully control.  Even Michael seems unable to separate the sex from his own more romantic feelings for Shirley as he battles with jealousy thinking about her with other men.  Perhaps, the most indicting line of dialogue comes from one of the creepier gents who cluelessly proclaims that one day, when these girls are all grown up, they will look back on this time as one of the greatest of their lives.  Yet, paradoxically, the exploitation goes both ways, as these ""nave"" girls, particularly Shirley, wrap a bunch of immature middle-aged men around their little fingers, ultimately using the men's uncontrollable libido against them.

It is this complicated twist that gives the film its darkly humorous tone and makes ""The Babysitters"" more than just a titillating and exploitative exercise in finger-wagging moral umbrage.",1319155200,,2564,5.056872037914692
3495571,4,B001BN25YO,"This film has many ingredients which could have made a really interesting story - stellar performances by newcomer Katherine Waterson, daughter of well known actor Sam Waterson, among other excellent actors - but falls apart quickly into a sort of soft porn / teen comedy due to a stupid writer-director, who allows promising assets to fall through his fingers. For example, the character of Shirley played by Waterson, is portrayed as suffering from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. But it was never made clear what connection this might have to her emotional manipulation by older men. Or, the vulnerability of the older men themselves is sometimes on display, but never developed. Instead we get the absurd hypothesis that comfortable suburban teen girls from good families would transition in one day from virginity to cash-accounting for sex at $200-300 a pop. With old guys from the neighborhood well known to their friends and parents. I don't think so.

Bottom line: Could have been a classy film but instead, deteriorated into teen sex-ploitation. The director Ross has a long way to go before he is a skilled filmaker. At least let's hope for more in the future from Katherine Waterson.

I'm curious about a legal point. There is no doubt about the depiction of sexual activity of mid teen girls here, even if the actual actors were over 18; doesn't that violate the federal child pornography law?? I mean, if a cartoon violates the law, if a comic violates the law, why not this movie?",1318809600,,1494,4.972
3495572,2,B001BN25YO,"""The Babysitters"" drowns in its own implausibility from the first moment. There's no reason clean-cut high school girls would suddenly start a prostitution ring. There's no reason that all the dads in town would patronize them instead of adult escorts. Once things in this movie get going, there's no reason anybody would behave anything like they do, including John Leguizamo's character, a middle-aged mensch trapped in a sexless marriage (to a shrewish Cynthia Nixon, channeling Miranda) who sets it all in motion. His character is a checklist of mid-life crisis clichs, but whenever Leguizamo is on the screen he projects a sweet soulfulness that makes you believe in and care for the guy. His uncharacteristically low-key performance hits every stupid note just right. He's like a figure skater performing a brilliant routine with lead weights strapped to his legs.

3495576,3,B001BN25YO,"The good:  The acting was very good.  The teen madame was particularly well portrayed.  The story was interesting and engaging.  The story was no holds barred in its presentation and where it was allowed to go, likely thanks to its small time, independent production.  It was also very well done given what I expect was a small budget.

The bad:  Consequences... there were no obvious consequences for anyone in this movie despite the ludicrously risky and depraved actions of so many.  I know that sometimes people get away with all sorts of bad behavior in life, I'm as cynical as the next guy, but the amount of raw evil involved in this story from so many of the characters is begging for at least one of them to end up with their life seriously ruined.  But the worst we see is a couple of people getting beaten up, in both cases not for doing wrong in a cosmic sense, but as enforcement actions for wronging the twisted ethics of the main character, the teenage madame.  The ending had great potential, and was semi-effective, but the lack of grand or even minor consequence for anyone involved was deeply disturbing and left me hanging more than this kind of movie usually does.  I also questioned the motives and psychologies at work that lead to the various kids getting involved in the prostitution ring, making the premise unsold and forcing the viewer to suspend disbelief throughout a large portion of the movie.

If you liked Kids, Thirteen or any of the other ""glimpse into the life of modern children run amok"" movies then this is worth watching as I think it is the best of the genre so far.  But if those movies left you feeling uneasy then stay away from this as it lacks any attempt at homily or closing the circle of cosmic justice and the place the children (and adults) end up is perhaps more disturbing than in those prior movies.",1283126400,4,1854,4.564954682779456

3495591,1,B001BN25YO,"WARNING!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!
  This movie is stupid. John must have needed the money when he did this. I like Leguizamo in movies, but who wrote this crap? It was interesting and believable at first until his girlfriend(waterston) started a escort service with her high-school friends. Like that would happen in real life USA. Except for the husbands paying 18 YO girls for sex I would definitely believe that. The acting is fine though by all the actors. Then the story degenerates into outrageousness. Like when the teen madame gets her johns to assault and batter the teenage brother of one of her escorts. In reality, the johns would be afraid of getting caught by their wives, the teen escort's parents, and finally the police. In the end of the movie the teen madame and her girlfriends try to murder one of her former teen escorts, for escorting on the side without paying the teenage madame her cut, while her client johns beat up the john, the rogue escort was servicing. Whom the madame later finds out to be her own father who is cheating on her mother.
  What a joke. Whoever wrote this s@%t must have a negative view of escorts and cheating husbands. The writer needs to read about why husbands commit infidelity. It's not simplified by saying that they are creeps. Even infidelous husbands have a valid reason whether its sex addiction, a deteriorating marriage, which shouldn't of have happened in the first place, etc.
 Avoid this movie and see Empire, Wild Things 3, the Take, Paraiso Travel, Zigzag, Carlito's way, Casualties of war instead.",1261094400,3,1558,4.820224719101123
3495592,2,B001BN25YO,"This movie had so much going for it. I liked the choices for just about every character. The subject is very crazy, yet important. But the one thing missing is consequence!

As you watch this movie unfold you keep waiting for the fall! One of the girls is going to talk? One of the girls is going to end up pregnant? Someone is going to end up getting killed? One of the wives is going to catch on? The police are going to be tipped off and the girls are going to get busted? Something? Anything? Yet the movie ends with a big ""oh well, ain't life funny. You are a normal girl one minute and a call girl the next. Just another episode in the life and times of a normal teen girl?"" Say what? There is no way you can have that many people all in on the crime and someone not talk! These girls trashed the high school. You mean there were no security cameras in the school? No alarm systems? They do every middle aged man in town! They beat the crap out of anyone who goes against them. They almost drop one of the girls off the side of the bridge! Yet no police, no one talks and everything is great. I'm sure the main character got back in time for her S.A.T. test and made an A+.

Sad, because this could have been so much more! This movie was like having sex. You kept building and building waiting for the big POP! Yet in the end we got the big ""lets just be friends.""",1258934400,2,1370,4.07037037037037

Capable of sleeping around with older men in order to make some quick money (not just a few dollars either- *serious* money).

That's not all- these girls actually developed an official gathering-type club dealing with sleeping with older guys.

There's an important lesson to be learned here- as a young adult, seriously think about what you're doing.  If you think it's wrong, don't go around doing things like this.  It will only lead to a life down the gutter.  Think rationally and don't make any serious mistakes or you will regret them later.

As for the storyline, well, it was shocking to me.  Young girls sleeping with older men and not even believing there was anything wrong with it... until the regret part kicks in.  A normal reaction.",1248652800,5,1018,4.64245810055866

3495596,5,B001BN25YO,"I enjoy films which present the viewer with multiple threads to consider and this is certainly one of those.

1. All Men Are Pigs - Every male character in the film is portrayed in the least flattering light possible.  John Leguizamo's character, arguably the most understandable, if not likeable, is an indifferent father who floats along in his marriage and his affaire choosing paths of least resistance every time.  Even Brenda's teen brother Scott, who starts out as a shy and endearing character quickly becomes a judgmental little creep.

2. To Cheat or Not To Cheat - Michael and Gail Beltran do a poor job in addressing the problems in their marriage.  Michael seems to be the partner who makes the attempt to confront their issues but it's a halfhearted attempt at best and is easily swept aside by Gail running off to an unscheduled NA meeting.  No wonder when Michael strays!

3. Women Are Greedy and Backstabbing - Nadine certainly is but she's the primary one with this foible and she already seemed to present as a pampered spoiled bitch anyway! Hardly deserving of elevation to a central theme in the film!

4. If they're Old Enough To Die For their Country - How old is old enough?  To me, this is the central theme of the film. Justice vs. the Rule of Law.  Our society has established an often arbitrary and almost always capricious series of numerical boundaries to substitute for common sense and fairness under our law-based system.  Its okay to enlist and die for one's country at 17 but you can't have a legal drink at 20.  Practically every county had its own BAC limit until the federal statute forced the .080 limit. It's illegal to photograph the bare buttocks of a 17-year-old but a flesh colored thong is okay on a 10-year-old. We've executed teens at 16, 17, and 18, but whether you were eligible for the death penalty depended on where you committed your crime. You can hire an 18-year-old to shoot a porn movie in your garage but pick up a 17-year-old in a bar drinking on an illegal ID and you go to prison.  While I disagree with Shirley about the similarities between paid fellatio and burger flipping, I find I am loathe to condemn her efforts at earning extra college money if I am forced to use as my only basis the potential legal consequences for her clients.

5. Don't Do Drugs - Hmmm... Maybe this is an anti-drug movie since they're portrayed as being at the root of the Beltran's marital problems as well as a primary precipitant in Brenda's breakdown and the decline and fall of the babysitters company.",1238976000,10,2549,4.635555555555555

One by one her friends join her in providing sitting services fro the married men of the community, a risky business sitter's club. As always things get too big and too emotional or else there wouldn't be any conflict and all we would have to watch is teen girls having sex.

The film looks like it would be soft porn, but it is not. There is one nude scene with Katherine Waterston that is the extension of the DVD cover. The sex was watered down also. The drama of teen girls was on the boring side. This was clearly a missed opportunity.

There was a theme of everything and everyone in their place, and when one thing gets out of place it causes a domino effect. They should have gone back to it. Or a clip of a ketchup bottle placed wrong.",1524787200,,840,4.276729559748428

But I will say in The Babysitters the sex isn't two teens, but between teens and middle-aged men, which makes a big difference. The creep factor is definitely up there in this movie. But it's just a bad movie. The acting isn't great. The ending is weird. Even if you aren't weirded out by the plot, the plot is outlandish.",1524441600,2,625,4.6909090909090905

8283690,5,B001BN25YO,"really more like 4 out of 4 possible stars so I gave a 5 star to boost in overall. Well done as for what they give you, IT needed more of ""something"" to be a great movie but it could UNLIKELY ever be a great movie simply due to the content and premise etc it really isn't bad. Especially if you do percentage side by side. If the sexually deviant genre (in my mind) cannot ever qualify for 5 stars then overall as a a best out of 4 stars this would be like 3.69 stars out of 4... so goes from a c+/b- (3.4) to a b+/a-... that said you won't be disappointed. For a film dated 10 years ago its got staying power in that its just dark enough, just sexy enough and has that borderline wrongness mixed with compassion and empathy. More a man film; but, may arouse the love or sex addict/avoidance active or dormant in all of us. Makes you think... What if your wife or daughter are keeping big secrets. Also should it stay that way? What if the experiences responsible for those secrets have become one of the most important things that could ever happen to them. Ignorant bliss? or eating from the tree of knowledge? Humanity will always fall from grace no matter how many times god reboots us. Hope this review can add some missing depth. Have to ask though... what would the woman you live with think about you watching this much less giving a positive review. It meant more to me though I guess. I was a bi-product of a similar tragedy. No prostitution ring (that I know of) but my father did marry my far to regular babysitter. No joke there. He was 45 and she was 15 when they first had sex... he was also a high school teacher at Dundulk High near Baltimore MD back in the 80's and Sandy was not the only girl. Sandy was her name his name was Tommy. He Died of Louis Body Disease back in 2010. Surviving him was Sandy and my half (bout 24 by now) sister, Leighann. Whom I have not met but would like to. Many years I had baggage...and likely emotionally enmeshed by my mother as my father did not support her. I did discover Neil Strauss's book: The Truth - An uncomfortable book about relationships and it became 50% of why I have experienced sooo much rebirth lately. Check that book out if you cant keep a relationship or get yourself (or both) together it WILL help if you let it.  Back to the movie... although missing some important additional dimension it should not be taken lightly... Wish it would have been a 2 part film or just an extra 45 minutes for supporting role development and even wife and parent drama, conflicts etc, that would have arisen etc but the acting was GREAT... Had a lot of opportunity to lose its sincerity and the director asked himself exactly what would this moment or that situation look like to the audience if they were the ones having similar experiences.
