4570649,5,B0054QZ8PM,"This production of Boris Godunov from 2010 attempts to make sense of the muddled situation as to which version to perform. There are detailed notes about the somewhat confused situation but to summarise there are no less than 8 existing versions to consider. This is a further solution which brings the choice up to 9 for the next attempt!

Essentially there was an original opera submitted to and rejected by the Mariinsky Theatre in 1869. It seems that the main problem was Mussorgsky's unconventional approach to orchestration which favoured the darker timbres of instruments rather than the usual, more conventional, brighter and easier playing ranges of the instruments. Mussorgsky substantially re-wrote the opera and this version was the one accepted as the 1872 version. Other versions then appeared such as the one by Rimsky Korsakov which attempted to `correct' or improve the orchestration. Further versions tried to re-instate more of the original, now compromised, concept. The current version is an attempt, to my mind successful, to make performing sense of the situation.

The opera is conceived as an historical survey of the reign of Boris Godunov from the murder of the previous child Tsar, through Boris' mental degeneration through to his final death. This is told in a sequence of tableaux grouped in two sets. The first group consists of 4 scenes and the second group consists of the remaining 4 scenes and a concluding epilogue.

This production is completely involving despite the unremitting gloom of the subject matter. I found the orchestration, here performed as originally intended, to be completely effective in setting the moods for all the scenes. The solo singers, of whom there are too many to list separately, are nearly all either Russian or of Eastern European origin and this gives great authority to their delivery of the Russian libretto.  There are some stand-out performances which must be mentioned though. The title role given by Orlin Anastassov gives a totally believable picture of the declining Boris with an acting speciality of madly staring eyes. Prince Shuisky is a convincing and devious aide. Boris' son Fyodor is well portrayed and sung by Pavel Zubov. The pretender Grigory, the monk Pimen, and the Holy Fool are all strongly cast and portrayed by Ian Storey, Vladimir Vaneef and Evgeny Akimov respectively.

The Turin chorus is very convincing too and benefits from some very effective make-up and costuming which makes it quite clear how downtrodden the population was at that time. The scenery is minimalist but sufficient to set the scene for each tableau. It serves to underline the effectiveness of the characterisation and the costumes of the main characters and to bring them out in full relief.

The orchestra under the expert and committed direction of Gianandrea Noseda delivers excellent support and both Noseda and director Andrei Konchalovsky provide their comments during the interviews provided as a bonus. Both of these two men were responsible for this adaptation.

The camera work and imaging is of the usual high standard that we have come to expect of Opus Arte and the equally excellent sound is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo.

This is an intriguing and compelling set and is unlikely to be challenged for a very long time. It should prove to be both satisfying and thought-provoking for most future purchasers and for those reasons it seems reasonable to suggest an encouraging 5 star rating.",1350864000,14,3474,5.125441696113074
4570650,4,B0054QZ8PM,"A previous reviwer has described the history of the various versions of Boris Goduvov. Yes, this is the original version as composed by Mussorgsky, the 1869 version and is the one rejected by the censors because there were no women in it. This is the way it was conceived by him before the ""improvements"" and ""recomposing corrections"" by Rimsky-Korsakov, Shostakovitch, Stravinsky and others. I and most people my age grew up on the Rimsky-Korsakov version used by Shalyapin in Paris 1908. It had all those strange haunting Eastern harmonies and plush, smooth dream-like orchestration (yes, I miss them). My first Boris was George London and I was captivated by his Boris and this opera as a great artistic achievement. Many others followed as Boris Christoff who had a command of this part that was almost a religious experience, his low notes were so clear and beautiful as to be coming from an organ. Then there were artists as Nicolai Ghiaurov, Martti Talvela, a great favorite Robert Loyd and recently Yevgeni Nesterenko again an organ like voice and skilled as an actor. Robert Loyd sang a somewhat authentic version with scenes from several other editions. The present recording is the original of 1869 with a scene from the 1872 version. So there is no vamp Marina, no evil Jesuit Rongoni and no ""westernized"" Tschaikovsky-like Polish dances. This is the raw, rough hewn native peasant music of the people of ""Mother Russia"". And I love it; it is magnificent. The hero of this performance is the chorus. This chorus represents the people of Russia; good people, poor people, bad people, devout people, drunks and thieves. The Turin Chorus is to be congradulated on their great achievement. In the past they have taken on difficult assignments and have succeeded brilliantly as they do here. I don't understand the Russian language but they seemed to be fluent in it  and all the charachters in the opera are native Russian speakers so I assume all is authentic.
The sets are sparce but fine; the orchestra sounds great due to the absolute perfection of the conductor Gianandrea Noseda. I loved all the furry coats of the nobles and the rags of the peasants. An altogether great effort with a ""yes"" for everything except a ""no"" for the Boris. Anastassov has a big fine voice that needs training and time. He sang the notes and he sang them well but he did not inhabit the part of Boris. Sympathy goes to the simpleton (the ""tin hat"" that did not wear a tin hat) sympathy did not go to this Boris. After the Boris of Christoff and Nesterenko, this Boris is still a work in progress. Anastassov needs maturity and time.",1331337600,15,2624,4.792494481236203
4570651,5,B0054QZ8PM,"Modest Mussorgsky's opera, Boris Godunov, exists in many diiferent forms.  For most of the twentieth century Boris was performed in the version that was reorchestrated by Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov.  This was the Boris with which most of us grew up.  It featured Rimsky-Korsakov's rich, dark, exotic- sounding harmonies and the stage productions emphasized the awesome pomp and splendor of the imperial tsarist court in sharp contrast to the wretched squalor of the downtrodden Russian masses.  For vivid examples  of this ""traditional"" approach look to Soviet- era productions such as director Vera Stroyeva's 1954 film (which displays the strong influence of Sergei Eisenstein and features the greatest af all Russian tenors, Ivan Kozlovsky, as the Holy Fool) or the 1978 video of the Bolshoi Opera showcasing the towering bass Yevgeny Nesterenko as Boris.  Both of these are fine productions.  Rimsky-Korsakov's Boris Godunov was magnificent in its own right.

In this Opus Arte video under review, however, director Andrei Konchalovsky and conductor Gianandrea Noseda have utilized Mussorgsky's original orchestration.  To make the matter more confusing, Mussorgsky himself actually composed two different versions of the work.  The original 1869 score had been rejected by the music comittee of the Imperial Theater so Mussorgsky rewrote and expanded the opera in 1872.  (An abbreviated production of Mussorgsky's 1872 version is available on DVD in the 1990 video from the Mariinsky theater featuring the English bass, Robert Lloyd Jones as Boris under the baton of a young Valery Gergiev.)  Konchalovsky and Noseda, on the other hand, chose the bare and monumental original 1869 version which Noseda calls ""the Ur-Boris.""  They do add one scene from the composer's 1872 revision and that is the scene which takes place in the Kromy forest.

Mussorgsky, who composed the music and wrote the libretto, chose as his sources Pushkin's literary drama, Boris Godunov, augmented by court historian Nicolai Karamzin's History of the Russian State.  The action in the opera takes place from 1598 to 1604.  This is during the Time of Troubles, an unstable interregnum between the end of the Ryurik dynasty which had ruled Muskovy for 700 years and the beginning of the Romanov dynasty which lasted until the Russian Revolution of 1917.

Ivan the Terrible had been succeeded by his son, Fyodor, a weak ruler who cared only about spiritual matters and left important affairs of state to his brother-in-law, Boris Godunov, who became the de facto regent.  In 1591 Ivan's other son, the eight-year-old Tsarevich Dmitriy, died under mysterious circumstances.  In 1598 Tsar Fyodor died.  Nominated by the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Boris Godunov was then unanimously elected tsar by the assembly of the Boyars.

Although modern historians now believe that the actual Boris Godunov had probably not been involved in the death of the Tsarevich Dmitriy, in the opera Boris seems to have played a role in facilitating the assasination.  Meanwhile, an ambitious and unscrupulous young monk passes himself off  as the living embodiment of the murdered Tsarevich and organizes a popular insurrection.  Boris becomes haunted by his own conscience.  Driven mad by remorse, he is ultimately undone.

Now, back to the video.  By utilizing Mussorgsky's original stripped-down score in combination with stark minimalist stage settings, Konchalovsky and Noseda present us with a rougher, less polished, less refined, more primitive, violent, and raw version of the work than we have ever seen before.  The emphasis here is on the nexus of terror that exists between a ruler and his people.  This sense of terror extends both ways between the despot and the masses.  It is a graphic portrayal of the seemingly eternal tragedy of the Russian people but also has far-reaching universal and contemporary ramifications.  Witness recent events in Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, and Libya.  Look at the cellphone video footage of a Libyan mob tormenting the tyrant Muammar Ghaddafi prior to executing him.

This production demonstrates both the drawbacks and advantages of state-of-the-art Blu-ray high definition home video versus attending a live performance in the opera house.  On the one hand tight close-ups reveal details of makeup that we really ought not to see such as the patently fake strapped-on beards and plastic warts of some of the chorus members.  This is balanced by the opportunity to see the main characters up close--in particular bass Orlin Anastassov's Boris who vividly conveys his fear of the people with his rich facial expressiveness.

Another highlight of this production is that many of the main roles are given to native Russian speakers: Boris, Pimen, Varlaam, and particularly the simpleton or ""Holy Fool"" (the Russian word is Yurodivy) who is the only character in the entire opera who can speak truth to power.

The quality of the picture and sound on this Blu-ray video disc are superb.  Viewing it is a dramatically compelling experience.  This powerful and gripping performance is a definitive Boris for our time.",1321056000,38,5125,5.30359355638166
4570652,5,B0054QZ8PM,"This version is Mussorgsky's original (1869), plus one scene taken from the 1872 version.
The picture and sound quality are pristine and the production is traditional and faithful. Everything is visually perfect - no Eurotrash, no strange costumes and props. Everyone interested in Russian opera should get this one! I can't recommend it highly enough.",1320451200,17,352,5.418181818181818
8456918,2,B0054QZ8PM,"This Anastassov/Noseda Boris Godunov is a musical triumph, and I also very much appreciate the original costumes.  In my opinion the composer would be very happy with it.  The only downside with the production itself is the minimalist set decoration.  (Of course, I'd rather have minimalist, than weird.)

The reason for the low rating is that I just can't watch it.  One would think, one should be able to watch an opera video.

The video director seems to consider him or herself an artist on the level of the composer and conductor.  So the camera pans around, closeups, switching to wide shot and back, scene changing every few seconds.  I can't take it.  That's not the way opera is viewed in the theater, and it gives me a headache.  I tried five minutes, I tried 15.  Sorry, I regret having to give up.

The teeny-tiny unreadable subtitles, much smaller than other opera videos, were also not much of an enticement.",1529366400,,922,4.69375

The production itself was merely okay--I'm not a fan of many of the production decisions, particularly pertaining to the relationship between Boris and his son. Also, this is the cut-rate 1869 version that is missing the Polish Act and Kromy Forest scene. I am generally not pleased that so many productions are reverting to this objectively inferior version of the opera in order to save money. It reduces what should be an epic night at the opera into a rather dry character study with virtually no plot.",1445385600,,578,4.838383838383838

8456923,5,B0054QZ8PM,"Based on the original Boris of Mussorgskyor rather, several original sourcesthis production follows the structure of neither the first 1869 version of Boris, nor the second, 1872 version. Instead it combines scenes from both, in the order presumably preferred by the production team. For those who know the various versions and scenes, this production omits the Polish scenes, written for the 1872 version, but includes the scene for Boris and the fool before St. Basil's Cathedral, dropped for the 1872 version, then includes the Kromy Forest scene, which replaced the St. Basil's scene in 1872. As is often done, it reverses the final two scenes of the 1872 version, in order to end with Boris' death. There are a couple of problems with these choices, one being that the song of the holy fool is sung twice, once to Boris before St. Basil's and once on an empty stage at the end of the scene at Kromy. The impact of that song, which Mussorgsky clearly chose to end the opera in the 1872 version, is thus lessened.
The choice of which scene to end the opera is a matter of personal preference, but I find that having the blind fool appear in Moscow, and then one scene later miles away at Kromy, is not only logically unlikely but also less effective.
If you are used to hearing the Polish scenes, this will seem like an abbreviated Boris. There were both dramatic and operatic reasons that Mussorgsky added the Polish scenesbreaking up the succession of gloomy scenes placed in Russia, more brilliant music, a genuine female lead role and love musicbut they have not always met with approval. I go back and forth on that personally, because there is some lovely music in the Polish scenes, and some genuine drama in the form of the slippery Jesuit Rangoni. At the same time, it is so different from the rest of Boris that it can seem out of place. There are other versions of Boris with the Polish scenes, if you want to have them.
All that said, it must be noted that every production of Boris is a compromise among versions,  as chosen by the presenters. There is no such thing as a definitive Boris, but this once is unquestionably superb, with outstanding voices, great acting and singing, good sound and excellent visual quality. It uses a unit set, giving it a dark and brooding quality throughout that matches Mussorgsky's score. If you prefer a more realistic and brilliant production, you can find that, too, but this is certainly effective.
A word on the Mussorgsky scoring: The problem with the well known Rimsky-Korsakov version is NOT that it is not effective, or brilliant, or beautiful; it is that it is not as dark and heavy, not as Russian as the Mussorgsky. Rimsky's brilliant scoring is much brighter and smoother, and thus it can be very pleasing indeed. But for those that prefer the more Russian qualities of Mussorgsky's original scoring, this will be an excellent choice. The outstanding performances by the leading singers, especially Boris and Pimen, make this a worthy addition to any opera collection.",1396569600,,3032,4.7752380952380955

8456925,3,B0054QZ8PM,"Boris and E. Onegin are perhaps the best Russian 19th Century operas.  We have many versions of Boris, the most used being R-Korsakov's .
  There are many respectable attempts to restore original and intermediary conceptions. The magnificent  V.Gergiev-R.Lloyd DVD in Mariinsky , St Petersburg environment and orchestra is directed by the great Tarkovsky.
  This interesting production by Konchalovsky in Regio di Torino has several merits.
 As Boris , Orlin Anastassov may be a handsome tsar, though he has never the deep voice of Nesterenko, Ghiaurov or Lloyd.
  The main problem is the conductor G. Noseda.  I don t believe we can have density in Rimsky`s orchestration only. We know original Mussorgsky's orchestra is different. Although, it doesn`t mean you cannot get WEIGHT in agogic and accent as a conductor.  Instrumental  strenght shines here in loud moments but never with the tension required by  every morbid scenes.
  The highlights of this opera are Boris himself , particularly his death.  If we have not a perfect bass, we would expect the conductor to get depth  and expression through orchestra, which here sounds too soft in some dramatic""adagios"".
  When Boris dies, we are unable to forget Karajan's CD, with Ghiaurov on Rimsky's orchestration,or Gergiev's DVD with LLoyd.

  PORTUGUES: Boris e E. Onegin so provavelmente as melhores &oacute;peras russas do S&eacute;culo 19. N&oacute;s temos diversas verses do  Boris , sendo a revisada por Rimsky a mais usada em teatros e gravaes. H&aacute; muitas tentativas de restaurar a verso mais original  poss&iacute;vel,bem como as ""intermedi&aacute;rias"". A magn&iacute;fica interpretao de Gergiev no Mariinsky de S Petersburgo ,com Robert Lloyd, tem direo do grande cineasta Tarkovsky. A presente verso de Konchalovsky, no Reggio de Turim tem v&aacute;rios m&eacute;ritos. Anastassov pode ser um czar bonito, mas nunca ter&aacute;  a voz profunda de Ghiaurov, Nesterenko ou Lloyd. O pior problema &eacute; o regente G. Noseda. No creio que possamos conseguir densidade apenas na orquestrao de R-Korsakov.
 Sabemos que a orquestra original de Mussorgsky era diferente. Entretanto, isso no significa que no se possa ter peso na ag&oacute;gica e no idioma, como um regente que deseja renovar pelo passado.. Fora instrumental brilha aqui em momentos fortes, mas nunca com a tenso requerida pelas diversas cenas m&oacute;rbidas.
Os pontos altos aqui so de Boris ele mesmo, particularmente sua morte.
Se no temos um baixo perfeito, esperar&iacute;amos ao menos que o regente tomasse profundidade e expresso pela orquestra, que aqui soa suave demais em alguns ad&aacute;gios dram&aacute;ticos.
 Quando Boris morre, no conseguimos esquecer Karajan-Ghiaurov na verso Rimsky, ou o DVD de Gergev com Lloyd
