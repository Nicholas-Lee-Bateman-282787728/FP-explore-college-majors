1655209,3,B00005RFI2,I had higher expectations for this movie.  Probably because I'm a John Schneider fan.  I found the writing and direction a little weak but it is a good movie to watch when you don't have anything to do on a rainy afternoon.,1418083200,,223,4.285714285714286
1655210,1,B00005RFI2,"One word describes this movie, poor. Poorly written, poorly acted,, poorly produced. I cannot find a single feature above poor.

1655211,1,B00005RFI2,The storyline was weak and uninteresting and the acting was below average.  The characters were not believable and the action was too contrived.  It also appeared to be 'low' budget movie.,1395705600,,188,5.032258064516129

1655214,5,B00005RFI2,John Schneider did a wonderful job as a man who suffered through the murder of his wife and child. He struggled with life and with his faith. A deep thinking movie.,1383264000,,164,4.32258064516129

1655219,1,B00005RFI2,"When i baught this film and saw the low class of the company advetising their company through out the film,I thaught I was watchig a cheap USA or TNT film. When you buy a dvd there should be no advertising of your company on the bottom of the film. TASTLESS!!!!!By the way the movie itself is just ok the action sequences low budget and the acting barely ok.",1061078400,,358,4.279411764705882
7952213,2,B00005RFI2,"This is a grade B- film with most, but not all, of the actors seeming to have not finished the acting course. The plot seems to have been stitched from several B- films. There is nothing new in the film. A soldier turns into a minister (even though some symbols in his church are of the Roman Catholic Church). His wife and child are killed by a terrorist and he is determined to go and kill the head terrorist whom he recognizes. He gets help from a man he fought with in Vietnam who is now a Lieutenant Coronel (who surprisingly is teaching recruits how to shoot, a job LTCs do not have). As in other films, the CIA does not want him to go to Lebanon after this man because the CIA has an asset there that they do not want harmed. The Lieutenant Colonel works for the CIA and is told by his superiors that if the reverend gets too close to their asset, the LTC should kill him. Among many strange things, when the reverend tells his congregation that he is leaving the church, at least for a while, because he has lost his faith, they all stand and clap. (If they feel this way, why do they go to church?)",1468972800,,1107,4.177570093457944
7952214,5,B00005RFI2,I don t think John did the movie for the quality. I have a strong inkling he did it to simply bring forward an in your face reminder of what REALLY goes on in this country. And he's right. There is more to his motives and thought process than meets the average eye.,1459641600,,265,4.018867924528302
7952215,2,B00005RFI2,"I expected bad.  It was, but the actors weren't the issue. The story was just a dead horse, which I expected too, but it just didn't have that horrible cheesy, magic goodness that makes these movies funny to watch.  It's hard to say what exactly makes a bad movie good, but this one didn't have it for me.",1455408000,,305,4.241379310344827
